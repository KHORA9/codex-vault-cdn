Though my visit was\r\na short one, I enjoyed many advantages, from immediate and constant\r\nintercourse with the various authorities and the most friendly\r\nreception by the natives of every class.\r\n\r\nThe information I sought was invariably communicated with courtesy\r\nand readiness; and by this publication something will, I hope, be\r\ncontributed to the store of useful knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe mighty \"tide of tendency\" is giving more and more importance to\r\nthe Oriental world. Its resources, as they become better known, will be\r\nmore rapidly developed. They are promising fields, which will encourage\r\nand reward adventure; inviting receptacles for the superfluities of\r\nEuropean wealth, activity, and intelligence, whose streams will flow\r\nback upon their sources with ever-augmenting contributions. Commerce\r\nwill complete the work in peace and prosperity, which conquest began\r\nin perturbation and peril. Whatever clouds may hang over portions\r\nof the globe, there is a brighter dawning, a wider sunrise, over\r\nthe whole; and the flights of time, and the explorings of space,\r\nare alike helping the \"infinite progression\" of good.\r\n\r\n\r\n    J.

The conditions of the contract were signed at Zaragoza, and,\r\nwith a fleet of six vessels, the largest of which was only 130 tons\r\nburden, and the whole number of the crews two hundred and thirty-four\r\nmen, Magalhães passed the straits which bear his name in November,\r\n1520; in the middle of March of the following year he discovered\r\nthe Mariana Islands, and a few days afterwards landed on the eastern\r\ncoast of the island of Mindanao, where he was well received by the\r\nnative population. He afterwards visited the island of Zebu, where,\r\nnotwithstanding a menaced resistance from more than two thousand\r\narmed men, he succeeded in conciliating the king and his court,\r\nwho were not only baptized into the Catholic faith, but recognised\r\nthe supreme sovereignty of the crown of Spain, and took the oaths of\r\nsubjection and vassalage. The king being engaged in hostilities with\r\nhis neighbours, Magalhães took part therein, and died in Mactan, on\r\nthe 26th April, 1521, in consequence of the wounds he received. This\r\ndisaster was followed by the murder of all the leading persons of\r\nthe expedition, who, being invited to a feast by their new ally,\r\nwere treacherously assassinated. Guillen de Porceleto alone escaped\r\nof the twenty-six guests who formed the company. Three of the fleet\r\nhad been lost before they reached the Philippines; one only returned\r\nto Spain--the Vitoria--the first that had ever made the voyage round\r\nthe world, and the Spanish king conferred on her commander, Elcano,\r\na Biscayan, an escutcheon bearing a globe, with the inscription,\r\n\"Primus circumdedit me.\" A second expedition, also composed of six\r\nvessels and a trader, left Spain in 1524. The whole fleet miserably\r\nperished in storms and contests with the Portuguese in the Moluccas,\r\nand the trader alone returned to the Spanish possessions in New Spain.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and twenty of the expedition landed in Tidore,\r\nwhere they built themselves a fortress, and were relieved by a third\r\nfleet sent by Hernan Cortes, in 1528, to prosecute the discoveries\r\nof which Magalhães had had the initiative. This third adventure was\r\nas disastrous as those which had preceded it. It consisted of three\r\nships and one hundred and ten men, bearing large supplies and costly\r\npresents. They took possession of the Marianas (Ladrone Islands) in the\r\nname of the king of Spain, reached Mindanao and other of the southern\r\nislands, failed twice in the attempt to reach New Spain, and finally\r\nwere all victims of the climate and of the hostility of the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nBut the Spanish court determined to persevere, and the Viceroy\r\n(Mendoza) of New Spain was ordered to prepare a fourth expedition,\r\nwhich was to avoid the Molucca Islands, where so many misfortunes had\r\nattended the Spaniards. The fleet consisted of three ships and two\r\ntraders, and the commander was Villalobos. He reached the Archipelago,\r\nand gave to the islands the name of the Philippines, in honour of\r\nthe Prince of Asturias, afterwards Philip the Second. Contrary winds\r\n(in spite of the royal prohibition) drove them into the Moluccas,\r\nwhere they were ill received by the Portuguese, and ordered to return\r\nto Spain. Villalobos died in Amboyna, where he was attended by the\r\nfamous missionary, St. Francisco Xavier. Death swept away many of the\r\nSpaniards, and the few who remained were removed from the Moluccas\r\nin Portuguese vessels.\r\n\r\nA fifth expedition on a larger scale was ordered by Philip the\r\nSecond to \"conquer, pacify, and people\" the islands which bore\r\nhis name. They consisted of five ships and four hundred seamen and\r\nsoldiers, and sailed from La Natividad (Mexico) in 1564, under the\r\norders of Legaspi, who was nominated Governor of the Philippines,\r\nwith ample powers. He reached Tandaya in February, 1565, proceeded\r\nto Cabalian, where the heir of the native king aided his views. In\r\nBojol, he secured the aid and allegiance of the petty sovereigns\r\nof the island, and afterwards fixed himself on the island of Zebu,\r\nwhich for some time was the central seat of Spanish authority. [1]\r\n\r\nManila was founded in 1581.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllness and the despotism of the doctors, who ordered me to throw off\r\nthe cares of my colonial government and to undertake a sea voyage of\r\nsix or seven weeks' duration, induced me to avail myself of one of the\r\nmany courtesies and kindnesses for which I am indebted to the naval\r\ncommander-in-chief, Sir Michael Seymour, and to accept his friendly\r\noffer of a steamer to convey me whither I might desire. The relations\r\nof China with the Eastern Spanish Archipelago are not unimportant, and\r\nwere likely to be extended in consequence of the stipulations of Lord\r\nElgin's Tientsin Treaty. Moreover, the slowly advancing commercial\r\nliberalism of the Spaniards has opened three additional ports to\r\nforeign trade, of which, till lately, Manila had the monopoly. I\r\ndecided, therefore, after calling at the capital in order to obtain\r\nthe facilities with which I doubted not the courtesy of my friend\r\nDon Francisco Norzagaray, the Captain-General of the Philippines,\r\nwould favour me, to visit Zamboanga, Iloilo, and Sual. I had already\r\nexperienced many attentions from him in connection with the government\r\nof Hong Kong. It will be seen that my anticipations were more than\r\nresponded to by the Governor, and as I enjoyed rare advantages in\r\nobtaining the information I sought, I feel encouraged to record the\r\nimpressions I received, and to give publicity to those facts which\r\nI gathered together in the course of my inquiries, assisted by such\r\npublications as have been accessible to me.\r\n\r\nSir Michael Seymour placed her Majesty's ship Magicienne at my\r\ndisposal. The selection was in all respects admirable. Nothing that\r\nforesight could suggest or care provide was wanting to my comfort,\r\nand I owe a great deal to Captain Vansittart, whose urbanities and\r\nattentions were followed up by all his officers and men. We left Hong\r\nKong on the 29th of November, 1858. The China seas are, perhaps, the\r\nmost tempestuous in the world, and the voyage to Manila is frequently\r\na very disagreeable one. So it proved to us. The wild cross waves,\r\nbreaking upon the bows, tossed us about with great violence; and\r\ndamage to furniture, destruction of glass and earthenware, and much\r\npersonal inconvenience, were among the varieties which accompanied us.\r\n\r\nBut on the fifth day we sighted the lighthouse at the entrance of the\r\nmagnificent harbour of Manila, and some hours' steaming brought us\r\nto an anchorage at about a mile distant from the city. There began\r\nthe attentions which were associated with the whole of our visit to\r\nthese beautiful regions. The Magicienne was visited by the various\r\nauthorities, and arrangements were made for my landing and conveyance\r\nto the palace of the Governor-General. Through the capital runs a river\r\n(the Pasig), up which we rowed, till we reached, on the left bank,\r\na handsome flight of steps, near the fortifications and close to\r\nthe column which has been erected to the memory of Magellanes, the\r\ndiscoverer of, or, at all events, the founder of Spanish authority\r\nin, these islands. This illustrious name arrested our attention. The\r\nmemorial is not worthy of that great reputation. It is a somewhat\r\nrude column of stone, crowned with a bronze armillary sphere,\r\nand decorated midway with golden dolphins and anchors wreathed in\r\nlaurels: it stands upon a pedestal of marble, bearing the name of\r\nthe honoured navigator, and is surrounded by an iron railing. It\r\nwas originally intended to be erected in the island of Zebu, but,\r\nafter a correspondence of several years with the Court of Madrid,\r\nthe present site was chosen by royal authority in 1847. There was\r\na very handsome display of cavalry and infantry, and a fine band of\r\nmusic played \"God save the Queen.\" Several carriages and four were\r\nin waiting to escort our party to the government palace, where I was\r\nmost cordially received by the captain-general and the ladies of his\r\nfamily. A fine suite of apartments had been prepared for my occupation,\r\nand servants, under the orders of a major-domo, were ordered to attend\r\nto our requirements, while one of the Governor's aides-de-camp was\r\nconstantly at hand to aid us.\r\n\r\nThough the name of Manila is given to the capital of the Philippine\r\nIslands, it is only the fort and garrison occupied by the authorities\r\nto which the designation was originally applied. Manila is on the\r\nleft bank of the river, while, on the right, the district of Binondo\r\nis the site inhabited by almost all the merchants, and in which their\r\nbusiness is conducted and their warehouses built. The palace fills\r\none side of a public plaza in the fortress, the cathedral another of\r\nthe same locality, resembling the squares of London, but with the\r\nadvantage of having its centre adorned by the glorious vegetation\r\nof the tropics, whose leaves present all varieties of colour, from\r\nthe brightest yellow to the deepest green, and whose flowers are\r\nremarkable for their splendour and beauty. There is a statue of\r\nCharles the Fourth in the centre of the garden.\r\n\r\nThe most populous and prosperous province of the Philippines takes\r\nits name from the fortification [2] of Manila; and the port of Manila\r\nis among the best known and most frequented of the harbours of the\r\nEastern world. The capital is renowned for the splendour of its\r\nreligious processions; for the excellence of its cheroots, which,\r\nto the east of the Cape of Good Hope, are generally preferred to the\r\ncigars of the Havana; while the less honourable characteristics of\r\nthe people are known to be a universal love of gambling, which is\r\nexhibited among the Indian races by a passion for cock-fighting, an\r\namusement made a productive source of revenue to the State. Artists\r\nusually introduce a Philippine Indian with a game-cock under his arm,\r\nto which he seems as much attached as a Bedouin Arab to his horse. It\r\nis said that many a time an Indian has allowed his wife and children\r\nto perish in the flames when his house has taken fire, but never was\r\nknown to fail in securing his favourite gallo from danger.\r\n\r\nOn anchoring off the city, Captain Vansittart despatched one of his\r\nlieutenants, accompanied by my private secretary, to the British\r\nconsulate, in order to announce our arrival, and to offer any\r\nfacilities for consular communication with the Magicienne. They had\r\nsome difficulty in discovering the consulate, which has no flag-staff,\r\nnor flag, nor other designation. The Consul was gone to his ferme\r\nmodèle, where he principally passes his time among outcast Indians,\r\nin an almost inaccessible place, at some distance from Manila. The\r\nVice-Consul said it was too hot for him to come on board, though during\r\na great part of the day we were receiving the representatives of the\r\nhighest authorities of Manila. The Consul wrote (I am bound to do him\r\nthis justice) that it would \"put him out\" of his routine of habit and\r\neconomy if he were expected to fête and entertain with formality \"his\r\nExcellency the Plenipotentiary and Governor of Hong Kong.\" I hastened\r\nto assure the Consul that my presence should cause him no expense,\r\nbut that the absence of anything which becomingly represented consular\r\nauthority on the arrival of one of Her Majesty's large ships of war\r\ncould hardly be passed unnoticed by the commander of that vessel.\r\n\r\nCrowds of visitors honoured our arrival; among them the archbishop\r\nand the principal ecclesiastical dignitaries; deputations from the\r\ncivilians, army and navy, and the various heads of departments, who\r\ninvited us to visit their establishments, exhibited in their personal\r\nattentions the characteristics of ancient Castilian courtesy. A\r\nreport had spread among the officers that I was a veteran warrior\r\nwho had served in the Peninsular campaign, and helped to liberate\r\nSpain from the yoke of the French invaders. I had to explain that,\r\nthough witness to many of the events of that exciting time, and in\r\nthat romantic land, I was a peaceful spectator, and not a busy actor\r\nthere. The bay of Manila, one of the finest in the world, and the river\r\nPasig which flows into it, were, no doubt, the great recommendations\r\nof the position chosen for the capital of the Philippines. During\r\nthe four months of March, April, May, and June, the heat and dust\r\nare very oppressive, and the mosquitos a fearful annoyance. To these\r\nmonths succeed heavy rains, but on the whole the climate is good,\r\nand the general mortality not great. The average temperature through\r\nthe year is 81° 97' Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe quarantine station is at Cavite, a town of considerable importance\r\non the southern side of the harbour. It has a large manufacturing\r\nestablishment of cigars, and gives its name to the surrounding\r\nprovince, which has about 57,000 inhabitants, among whom are about\r\n7,000 mestizos (mixed race). From its adjacency to the capital, the\r\nnumerical proportion of persons paying tribute is larger than in any\r\nother province.\r\n\r\nThe city, which is surrounded by ramparts, consists of seventeen\r\nstreets, spacious and crossing at right angles. As there is little\r\nbusiness in this part of the capital (the trade being carried on on\r\nthe other side of the river), few people are seen in the streets, and\r\nthe general character of the place is dull and monotonous, and forms\r\na remarkable contrast to the activity and crowding of the commercial\r\nquarters. The cathedral, begun in 1654, and completed in 1672, is 240\r\nfeet in length and 60 in breadth. It boasts of its fourteen bells,\r\nwhich have little repose; and of the carvings of the fifty-two\r\nseats which are set apart for the aristocracy. The archiepiscopal\r\npalace, though sufficiently large, did not appear to me to have any\r\narchitectural beauty. The apartments are furnished with simplicity,\r\nand though the archbishop is privileged, like the governor, to appear\r\nin some state, it was only on the occasion of religious ceremonies that\r\nI observed anything like display. His reception of me was that of a\r\ncourteous old gentleman. He was dressed with great simplicity, and our\r\nconversation was confined to inquiries connected with ecclesiastical\r\nadministration. He had been a barefooted Augustin friar (Recoleto),\r\nand was raised to the archiepiscopal dignity in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe palacio in which I was so kindly accommodated was originally built\r\nby an opulent but unfortunate protégé of one of the captains-general;\r\nit was reconstructed in 1690 by Governor Gongora. It fills a\r\nconsiderable space, and on the south-west side has a beautiful view\r\nof the bay and the surrounding headlands. There is a handsome Hall\r\nof Audience, and many of the departments of the government have their\r\nprincipal offices within its walls. The patio forms a pretty garden,\r\nand is crowded with tropical plants. It has two principal stone\r\nstaircases, one leading to the private apartments, and the other to\r\nthe public offices. Like all the houses at Manila, it has for windows\r\nsliding frames fitted with concha, or plates of semi-transparent\r\noysters, which admit an imperfect light, but are impervious to the\r\nsunbeams. I do not recollect to have seen any glass windows in the\r\nPhilippines. Many of the apartments are large and well furnished, but\r\nnot, as often in England, over-crowded with superfluities. The courtesy\r\nof the Governor provided every day at his table seats for two officers\r\nof the Magicienne at dinner, after retiring from which there was a\r\ntertulia, or evening reception, where the notabilities of the capital\r\nafforded me many opportunities for enjoying that agreeable and lively\r\nconversation in which Spanish ladies excel. A few mestizos are among\r\nthe visitors. Nothing, however, is seen but the Parisian costume;\r\nno vestiges of the recollections of my youth--the velo, the saya,\r\nand the basquiña; nor the tortoiseshell combs, high towering over the\r\nbeautiful black cabellera; the fan alone remains, then, as now, the\r\ndexterously displayed weapon of womanhood. After a few complimentary\r\nsalutations, most of the gentlemen gather round the card-tables.\r\n\r\nThe Calzada, a broad road a little beyond the walls of the fortress,\r\nis to Manila what Hyde Park is to London, the Champs Elysées to Paris,\r\nand the Meidan to Calcutta. It is the gathering place of the opulent\r\nclasses, and from five o'clock P.M. to the nightfall is crowded with\r\ncarriages, equestrians and pedestrians, whose mutual salutations\r\nseem principally to occupy their attention: the taking off hats\r\nand the responses to greetings and recognitions are sufficiently\r\nwearisome. Twice a week a band of music plays on a raised way near\r\nthe extremity of the patio. Soon after sunset there is a sudden and\r\ngeneral stoppage. Every one uncovers his head; it is the time of the\r\noracion announced by the church bells: universal silence prevails\r\nfor a few minutes, after which the promenades are resumed. There is a\r\ngood deal of solemnity in the instant and accordant suspension of all\r\nlocomotion, and it reminded me of the prostration of the Mussulmans\r\nwhen the voice of the Muezzim calls, \"To prayer, to prayer.\" A fine\r\nevening walk which is found on the esplanade of the fortifications,\r\nis only frequented on Sundays. It has an extensive view of the harbour\r\nand the river, and its freedom from the dust and dirt of the Calzada\r\ngives it an additional recommendation; but fashion despotically decides\r\nall such matters, and the crowds will assemble where everybody expects\r\nto meet with everybody. In visiting the fine scenery of the rivers,\r\nroads, and villages in the neighbourhood of Manila, we seldom met\r\nwith a carriage, or a traveller seeking to enjoy these beauties. And\r\nin a harbour so magnificent as that of Manila one would expect to see\r\nskiffs and pleasure-boats without number, and yachts and other craft\r\nministering to the enjoyment and adding to the variety of life; but\r\nthere are none. Nobody seems to like sporting with the elements. There\r\nare no yacht regattas on the sea, as there are no horseraces on the\r\nshore. I have heard the life of Manila called intolerably monotonous;\r\nin my short stay it appeared to me full of interest and animation,\r\nbut I was perhaps privileged. The city is certainly not lively,\r\nand the Spaniard is generally grave, but he is warm-hearted and\r\nhospitable, and must not be studied at a distance, nor condemned\r\nwith precipitancy. He is, no doubt, susceptible and pundonoroso, but\r\nis rich in noble qualities. Confined as is the population of Manila\r\nwithin the fortification walls, the neighbouring country is full of\r\nattractions. To me the villages, the beautiful tropical vegetation,\r\nthe banks of the rivers, and the streams adorned with scenery so\r\npicturesque and pleasing, were more inviting than the gaiety of\r\nthe public parade. Every day afforded some variety, and most of the\r\npueblos have their characteristic distinctions. Malate is filled with\r\npublic offices, and women employed in ornamenting slippers with gold\r\nand silver embroidery. Santa Ana is a favourite Villagiatura for\r\nthe merchants and opulent inhabitants. Near Paco is the cemetery,\r\n\"where dwell the multitude,\" in which are interred the remains of\r\nmany of the once distinguished who have ceased to be. Guadalupe\r\nis illustrious for its miraculous image, and Paco for that of the\r\nSaviour. The Lake of Arroceros (as its name implies) is one of the\r\nprincipal gathering places for boats loaded with rice; near it, too,\r\nare large manufactories of paper cigars. Sampaloc is the paradise\r\nof washermen and washerwomen. La Ermita and other villages are\r\nremarkable for their bordadoras, who produce those exquisite piña\r\nhandkerchiefs for which such large sums are paid. Pasay is renowned\r\nfor its cultivation of the betel. Almost every house has a garden with\r\nits bamboos, plantains and cocoa-nut trees, and some with a greater\r\nvariety of fruits. Nature has decorated them with spontaneous flowers,\r\nwhich hang from the branches or the fences, or creep up around the\r\nsimple dwellings of the Indians. Edifices of superior construction\r\nare generally the abodes of the mestizos, or of the gobernadorcillos\r\nbelonging to the different pueblos.\r\n\r\nPhilip the Third gave armorial bearings to the capital, and conferred\r\non it the title of the \"Very Noble City of Manila\" (La mui noble\r\nCiudad), and attached the dignity of Excellency to the Ayuntamiento\r\n(municipality).\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Manila, every afternoon, at five or six o'clock,\r\nthe Governor-General called for me in my apartments, and escorted by\r\ncavalry lancers we were conveyed in a carriage and four to different\r\nparts of the neighbourhood, the rides lasting from one to two hours. We\r\nseldom took the same road, and thus visited not only nearly all the\r\nvillages in the vicinity, but passed through much beautiful country in\r\nwhich the attention was constantly arrested by the groups of graceful\r\nbamboos, the tall cocoa-nut trees, the large-leafed plantains, the\r\nsugar-cane, the papaya, the green paddy fields (in which many people\r\nwere fishing--and who knows, when the fields are dry, what becomes\r\nof the fish, for they never fail to appear again when irrigation has\r\ntaken place?), and that wonderful variety and magnificence of tropical\r\nvegetation,--leaves and flowers so rich and gorgeous, on which one\r\nis never tired to gaze. Much of the river scenery is such as a Claude\r\nwould revel in, and high indeed would be the artist's merit who could\r\ngive perpetuity to such colouring. And then the sunset skies--such as\r\nare never seen in temperate zones,--so grand, so glowing, and at times\r\nso awful! Almost every pueblo has some dwellings larger and better\r\nthan the rest, occupied by the native authorities or the mixed races\r\n(mostly, however, of Chinese descent), who link the Indian to the\r\nEuropean population. The first floor of the house is generally raised\r\nfrom the ground and reached by a ladder. Bamboos form the scaffolding,\r\nthe floors, and principal wood-work; the nipa palm makes the walls and\r\ncovers the roof. A few mats, a table, a rude chair or two, some pots\r\nand crockery, pictures of saints, a lamp, and some trifling utensils,\r\ncomprise the domestic belongings, and while the children are crawling\r\nabout the house or garden, and the women engaged in household cares,\r\nthe master will most probably be seen with his game-cock under his\r\narm, or meditating on the prowess of the gallo while in attendance\r\non the gallinas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\nFIGURE\r\n\r\nVIEW FROM MY WINDOW SAN MIGUEL.\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe better class of houses in Manila are usually rectangular, having\r\na court in the centre, round which are shops, warehouses, stables\r\nand other offices, the families occupying the first floor. Towards\r\nthe street there is a corridor which communicates with the various\r\napartments, and generally a gallery in the interior looking into\r\nthe patio (court). The rooms have all sliding windows, whose small\r\npanes admit the light of day through semi-transparent oyster-shells:\r\nthere are also Venetians, to help the ventilation and to exclude the\r\nsun. The kitchen is generally separated from the dwelling. A large\r\ncistern in the patio holds the water which is conveyed from the roofs\r\nin the rainy season, and the platform of the cistern is generally\r\ncovered with jars of flowering plants or fruits. The first and only\r\nfloor is built on piles, as the fear of earthquakes prevents the\r\nerection of elevated houses. The roofing is ordinarily of red tiles.\r\n\r\nThe apartments, as suited to a tropical climate, are large, and\r\nmany European fashions have been introduced: the walls covered with\r\npainted paper, many lamps hung from the ceiling, Chinese screens,\r\nporcelain jars with natural or artificial flowers, mirrors, tables,\r\nsofas, chairs, such as are seen in European capitals; but the large\r\nrooms have not the appearance of being crowded with superfluous\r\nfurniture. Carpets are rare--fire-places rarer.\r\n\r\nAmong Europeans the habits of European life are slightly modified by\r\nthe climate; but it appeared to me among the Spaniards there were more\r\nof the characteristics of old Spain than would now be found in the\r\nPeninsula itself. In my youth I often heard it said--and it was said\r\nwith truth--that neither Don Quixote nor Gil Blas were pictures of the\r\npast alone, but that they were faithful portraits of the Spain which\r\nI saw around me. Spain had then assuredly not been Europeanized; but\r\nfifty years--fifty years of increased and increasing intercourse with\r\nthe rest of the world--have blotted out the ancient nationality, and\r\nEuropean modes, usages and opinions, have pervaded and permeated all\r\nthe upper and middling classes of Spanish society--nay, have descended\r\ndeep and spread far among the people, except those of the remote and\r\nrural districts. There is little now to distinguish the aristocratical\r\nand high-bred Spaniard from his equals in other lands. In the somewhat\r\nlower grades, however, and among the whole body of clergy, the impress\r\nof the past is preserved with little change. Strangers of foreign\r\nnations, principally English and Americans, have brought with them\r\nconveniences and luxuries which have been to some extent adopted by\r\nthe opulent Spaniards of Manila; and the honourable, hospitable and\r\nliberal spirit which is found among the great merchants of the East,\r\nhas given them \"name and fame\" among Spanish colonists and native\r\ncultivators. Generally speaking, I found a kind and generous urbanity\r\nprevailing,--friendly intercourse where that intercourse had been\r\nsought,--the lines of demarcation and separation between ranks and\r\nclasses less marked and impassable than in most Oriental countries. I\r\nhave seen at the same table Spaniard, mestizo and Indian--priest,\r\ncivilian and soldier. No doubt a common religion forms a common bond;\r\nbut to him who has observed the alienations and repulsions of caste in\r\nmany parts of the Eastern world--caste, the great social curse--the\r\nblending and free intercourse of man with man in the Philippines is\r\na contrast well worth admiring. M. Mallat's enthusiasm is unbounded\r\nin speaking of Manila. \"Enchanting city!\" he exclaims; \"in thee\r\nare goodness, cordiality, a sweet, open, noble hospitality,--the\r\ngenerosity which makes our neighbour's house our own;--in thee the\r\ndifference of fortune and hierarchy disappears. Unknown to thee is\r\netiquette. O Manila! a warm heart can never forget thy inhabitants,\r\nwhose memory will be eternal for those who have known them.\"\r\n\r\nDe Mas' description of the Manila mode of life is this:--\"They rise\r\nearly, and take chocolate and tea (which is here called cha); breakfast\r\ncomposed of two or three dishes and a dessert at ten; dinner at from\r\ntwo to three; siesta (sleep) till five to six; horses harnessed, and\r\nan hour's ride to the pasco; returning from which, tea, with bread\r\nand biscuits and sweets, sometimes homewards, sometimes in visit\r\nto a neighbour; the evening passes as it may (cards frequently);\r\nhomewards for bed at 11 P.M.; the bed a fine mat, with mosquito\r\ncurtains drawn around; one narrow and one long pillow, called an\r\nabrazador (embracer), which serves as a resting-place for the arms or\r\nthe legs. It is a Chinese and a convenient appliance. No sheets--men\r\nsleep in their stockings, shirts, and loose trousers (pajamas); the\r\nladies in garments something similar. They say 'people must always\r\nbe ready to escape into the street in case of an earthquake.'\" I\r\ncertainly know of an instance where a European lady was awfully\r\nperplexed when summoned to a sudden flight in the darkness, and felt\r\nthat her toilette required adjustment before she could hurry forth.\r\n\r\nMany of the pueblos which form the suburbs of Manila are very\r\npopulous. Passing through Binondo we reach Tondo, which gives its\r\nname to the district, and has 31,000 inhabitants. These pueblos\r\nhave their Indian gobernadorcillos. Their best houses are of European\r\nconstruction, occupied by Spaniards or mestizos, but these form a small\r\nproportion of the whole compared with the Indian Cabánas. Tondo is one\r\nof the principal sources for the supply of milk, butter, and cheese\r\nto the capital; it has a small manufacturing industry of silk and\r\ncotton tissues, but most of the women are engaged in the manipulation\r\nof cigars in the great establishments of Binondo. Santa Cruz has a\r\npopulation of about 11,000 inhabitants, many of them merchants, and\r\nthere are a great number of mechanics in the pueblo. Near it is the\r\nburying-place of the Chinese, or, as they are called by the Spaniards,\r\nthe Sangleyes infieles.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz is a favourite name in the Philippines. There are in\r\nthe island of Luzon no less than four pueblos, each with a large\r\npopulation, called Santa Cruz, and several besides in others of\r\nthe Philippines. It is the name of one of the islands, of several\r\nheadlands, and of various other localities, and has been carried by\r\nthe Spaniards into every region where they have established their\r\ndominion. So fond are they of the titles they find in their Calendar,\r\nthat in the Philippines there are no less than sixteen places called\r\nSt. John and twelve which bear the name of St. Joseph; Jesus, Santa\r\nMaria, Santa Ana, Santa Caterina, Santa Barbara, and many other saints,\r\nhave given their titles to various localities, often superseding the\r\nancient Indian names. Santa Ana is a pretty village, with about 5,500\r\nsouls. It is surrounded with cultivated lands, which, being irrigated\r\nby fertilizing streams, are productive, and give their wonted charm to\r\nthe landscape--palms, mangoes, bamboos, sugar plantations, and various\r\nfruit and forest trees on every side. The district is principally\r\ndevoted to agriculture. A few European houses, with their pretty\r\ngardens, contrast well with the huts of the Indian. Its climate has\r\nthe reputation of salubrity.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable demand for horses in the capital. The\r\nimportation of the larger races from Australia has not been\r\nsuccessful. They were less suited to the climate than the ponies which\r\nare now almost universally employed. The Filipinos never give pure\r\nwater to their horses, but invariably mix it with miel (honey), the\r\nsaccharine matter of the caña dulce, and I was informed that no horse\r\nwould drink water unless it was so sweetened. This, of course, is the\r\nresult of \"education.\" The value of horses, as compared with their\r\ncost in the remoter islands, is double or treble in the capital. In\r\nfact, nothing more distinctly proves the disadvantages of imperfect\r\ncommunication than the extraordinary difference of prices for the\r\nsame articles in various parts of the Archipelago, even in parts\r\nwhich trade with one another. There have been examples of famine in\r\na maritime district while there has been a superfluity of food in\r\nadjacent islands. No doubt the monsoons are a great impediment to\r\nregular intercourse, as they cannot be mastered by ordinary shipping;\r\nbut steam has come to our aid, when commercial necessities demanded\r\nnew powers and appliances, and no regions are likely to benefit by\r\nit more than those of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe associations and recollections of my youth were revived in the\r\nhospitable entertainment of my most excellent host and the courteous\r\nand graceful ladies of his family. Nearly fifty years before I had\r\nbeen well acquainted with the Spanish peninsula--in the time of its\r\nsufferings for fidelity, and its struggles for freedom, and I found\r\nin Manila some of the veterans of the past, to whom the \"Guerra de\r\nIndependencia\" was of all topics the dearest; and it was pleasant to\r\ncompare the tablets of our various memories, as to persons, places\r\nand events. Of the actors we had known in those interesting scenes,\r\nscarcely any now remain--none, perhaps, of those who occupied the\r\nhighest position, and played the most prominent parts; but their\r\nnames still served as links to unite us in sympathizing thoughts and\r\nfeelings, and having had the advantage of an early acquaintance with\r\nSpanish, all that I had forgotten was again remembered, and I found\r\nmyself nearly as much at home as in former times when wandering among\r\nthe mountains of Biscay, dancing on the banks of the Guadalquivir,\r\nor turning over the dusty tomes at Alcalá de Henares. [3]\r\n\r\nThere was a village festival at Sampaloc (the Indian name for\r\ntamarinds), to which we were invited. Bright illuminations adorned\r\nthe houses, triumphal arches the streets; everywhere music and gaiety\r\nand bright faces. There were several balls at the houses of the more\r\nopulent mestizos or Indians, and we joined the joyous assemblies. The\r\nrooms were crowded with Indian youths and maidens. Parisian fashions\r\nhave not invaded these villages--there were no crinolines--these\r\nare confined to the capital; but in their native garments there was\r\nno small variety--the many-coloured gowns of home manufacture--the\r\nrichly embroidered kerchiefs of piña--earrings and necklaces, and\r\nother adornings; and then a vivacity strongly contrasted with the\r\ncharacteristic indolence of the Indian races. Tables were covered\r\nwith refreshments--coffee, tea, wines, fruits, cakes and sweetmeats;\r\nand there seemed just as much of flirting and coquetry as ever marked\r\nthe scenes of higher civilization. To the Europeans great attentions\r\nwere paid, and their presence was deemed a great honour. Our young\r\nmidshipmen were among the busiest and liveliest of the throng,\r\nand even made their way, without the aid of language, to the good\r\ngraces of the Zagalas. Sampaloc, inhabited principally by Indians\r\nemployed as washermen and women, is sometimes called the Pueblo de\r\nlos Lavanderos. The festivities continued to the matinal hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Captain-General (Crespo) caused sundry statistical returns\r\nto be published, which throw much light upon the social condition\r\nof the Philippine Islands, and afford such valuable materials for\r\ncomparison with the official data of other countries, that I shall\r\nextract from them various results which appear worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nThe city of Manila contains 11 churches, with 3 convents, 363\r\nprivate houses; and the other edifices, amounting in all to 88,\r\nconsist of public buildings and premises appropriated to various\r\nobjects. Of the private houses, 57 are occupied by their owners, and\r\n189 are let to private tenants, while 117 are rented for corporate or\r\npublic purposes. The population of the city in 1855 was 8,618 souls,\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        ---------------------+--------+----------+-------\r\n                ----         | Males. | Females. | Total.\r\n        ---------------------+--------+----------+-------\r\n        European Spaniards   |   503  |    87    |    590\r\n        Native ditto         |   575  |   798    |  1,373\r\n        Indians and Mestizos | 3,830  | 2,493    |  6,323\r\n        Chinese              |   525  |     7[4] |    532\r\n                             +--------+----------+-------\r\n                 Total       | 5,433  | 3,385    |  8,818\r\n        ---------------------+--------+----------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\nFar different are the proportions in another part of the capital,\r\nthe Binondo district, on the other side of the river:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        ---------------------+--------+-----------+-------\r\n                ----         | Males. |  Females. | Total.\r\n        ---------------------+--------+-----------+-------\r\n        European Spaniards   |     67 |     52    |    219\r\n        Native ditto         |    569 |    608    |  1,177\r\n        Foreigners           |     85 |     11    |     96\r\n        Indians and Mestizos | 10,317 | 10,685    | 21,002\r\n        Chinese              |  5,055 |      8[5] |  5,063\r\n                             +--------+-----------+-------\r\n                 Total       | 16,193 |  11,364   | 27,557\r\n        ---------------------+--------+-----------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these, one male and two females (Indian) were more than 100\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of births and deaths in Manila is thus given:--\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------\r\n          ----        |  Spaniards.  |   Natives.   |    Total.\r\n----------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------\r\nBirths                | 4·38 per ct. | 4·96 per ct. | 4·83 per ct.\r\nDeaths                | 1·68  ,,     | 2·72  ,,     | 2·48  ,,\r\n                      +--------------+--------------+-------------\r\nExcess of Births over |              |              |\r\n  Deaths              | 2·70 per ct. | 2·24 per ct. | 2·35 per ct.\r\n----------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Binondo the returns are much less favourable:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Births   5·12\r\n                         Deaths   4·77\r\n                                  0·35\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statistical commissioners state these discrepancies to be\r\ninexplicable; but attribute it in part to the stationary character\r\nof the population of the city, and the many fluctuations which take\r\nplace in the commercial movements of Binondo.\r\n\r\nBinondo is really the most important and most opulent pueblo of the\r\nPhilippines, and is the real commercial capital: two-thirds of the\r\nhouses are substantially built of stone, brick and tiles, and about\r\none-third are Indian wooden houses covered with the nipa palm. The\r\nplace is full of business and activity. An average was lately taken\r\nof the carriages daily passing the principal thoroughfares. Over\r\nthe Puente Grande (great bridge) their number was 1,256; through\r\nthe largest square, Plaza de S. Gabriel, 979; and through the main\r\nstreet, 915. On the Calzada, which is the great promenade of the\r\ncapital, 499 carriages were counted--these represent the aristocracy\r\nof Manila. There are eight public bridges, and a suspension bridge\r\nhas lately been constructed as a private speculation, on which a fee\r\nis levied for all passengers.\r\n\r\nBinondo has some tolerably good wharfage on the bank of the Pasig,\r\nand is well supplied with warehouses for foreign commerce. That\r\nfor the reception of tobacco is very extensive, and the size of the\r\nedifice where the state cigars are manufactured may be judged of from\r\nthe fact that nine thousand females are therein habitually employed.\r\n\r\nThe Puente Grande (which unites Manila with Binondo) was originally\r\nbuilt of wood upon foundations of masonry, with seven arches of\r\ndifferent sizes, at various distances. Two of the arches were destroyed\r\nby the earthquake of 1824, since which period it has been repaired\r\nand restored. It is 457 feet in length and 24 feet in width. The\r\nviews on all sides from the bridge are fine, whether of the wharves,\r\nwarehouses, and busy population on the right bank of the river, or\r\nthe fortifications, churches, convents, and public walks on the left.\r\n\r\nThe population of Manila and its suburbs is about 150,000.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco manufactories of Manila, being the most remarkable of\r\nthe \"public shows,\" have been frequently described. The chattering\r\nand bustling of the thousands of women, which the constantly exerted\r\nauthority of the female superintendents wholly failed to control, would\r\nhave been distracting enough from the manipulation of the tobacco leaf,\r\neven had their tongues been tied, but their tongues were not tied,\r\nand they filled the place with noise. This was strangely contrasted\r\nwith the absolute silence which prevailed in the rooms solely occupied\r\nby men. Most of the girls, whose numbers fluctuate from eight to ten\r\nthousand, are unmarried, and many seemed to be only ten or eleven\r\nyears old. Some of them inhabit pueblos at a considerable distance\r\nfrom Manila, and form quite a procession either in proceeding to or\r\nreturning from their employment. As we passed through the different\r\napartments specimens were given us of the results of their labours,\r\nand on leaving the establishment beautiful bouquets of flowers were\r\nplaced in our hands. We were accompanied throughout by the superior\r\nofficers of the administration, explaining to us all the details with\r\nthe most perfect Castilian courtesy. Of the working people I do not\r\nbelieve one in a hundred understood Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe river Pasig is the principal channel of communication with the\r\ninterior. It passes between the commercial districts and the fortress\r\nof Manila. Its average breadth is about 350 feet, and it is navigable\r\nfor about ten miles, with various depths of from 3 to 25 feet. It is\r\ncrossed by three bridges, one of which is a suspension bridge. The\r\ndaily average movement of boats, barges, and rafts passing with\r\ncargo under the principal bridge, was 277, escorted by 487 men and\r\n121 women (not including passengers). The whole number of vessels\r\nbelonging to the Philippines was, in 1852 (the last return I possess),\r\n4,053, representing 81,752 tons, and navigated by 30,485 seamen. Of\r\nthese, 1,532 vessels, of 74,148 tons, having 17,133 seamen, belong\r\nto the province of Manila alone, representing three-eighths of the\r\nships, seven-eighths of the tonnage, and seventeen-thirtieths of the\r\nmercantile marine. The value of the coasting trade in 1852 is stated to\r\nhave been about four and a-half millions of dollars, half this value\r\nbeing in abacá (Manila hemp), sugar and rice being the next articles\r\nin importance. The province of Albay, the most southern of Luzon,\r\nis represented by the largest money value, being about one-fourth of\r\nthe whole. On an average of five years, from 1850 to 1854, the coasting\r\ntrade is stated to have been of the value of 4,156,459 dollars, but the\r\nreturns are very imperfect, and do not include all the provinces. The\r\nstatistical commission reports that on an examination of all the\r\ndocuments and facts accessible to them, in 1855, the coasting trade\r\nmight be fairly estimated at 7,200,459 dollars.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of about three miles from Binondo, on the right bank\r\nof the Pasig, is the country house of the captain-general, where he\r\nis accustomed to pass some weeks of the most oppressive season of\r\nthe year: it has a nice garden, a convenient moveable bath, which\r\nis lowered into the river, an aviary, and a small collection of\r\nquadrupeds, among which I made acquaintance with a chimpanzee, who,\r\nsoon after, died of a pulmonary complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nVISIT TO LA LAGUNA AND TAYABAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving arranged for a visit to the Laguna and the surrounding\r\nhills, whose beautiful scenery has given to the island of Luzon\r\na widely-spread celebrity, we started accompanied by the Alcalde\r\nMayor, De la Herran, Colonel Trasierra, an aide-de-camp of the\r\nGovernor, appointed to be my special guide and guardian, my kind\r\nfriend and gentlemanly companion Captain Vansittart, and some other\r\ngentlemen. The inhabitants of the Laguna are called by the Indians of\r\nManila Tagasilañgan, or Orientals. As we reached the various villages,\r\nthe Principalia, or native authorities, came out to meet us, and\r\nmusical bands escorted us into and out of all the pueblos. We found\r\nthe Indian villages decorated with coloured flags and embroidered\r\nkerchiefs, and the firing of guns announced our arrival. The roads\r\nwere prettily decorated with bamboos and flowers, and everything\r\nproclaimed a hearty, however simple welcome. The thick and many-tinted\r\nfoliage of the mango--the tall bamboos shaking their feathery heads\r\naloft--the cocoa-nut loftier still--the areca and the nipa palms--the\r\nplantains, whose huge green leaves give such richness to a tropical\r\nlandscape--the bread-fruit, the papaya, and the bright-coloured\r\nwild-flowers, which stray at will over banks and branches--the\r\nriver every now and then visible, with its canoes and cottages,\r\nand Indian men, women, and children scattered along its banks. Over\r\nan excellent road, we passed through Santa Ana to Taguig, where a\r\nbamboo bridge had been somewhat precipitately erected to facilitate\r\nour passage over the stream: the first carriage got over in safety;\r\nwith the second the bridge broke down, and some delay was experienced\r\nin repairing the disaster, and enabling the other carriages to come\r\nforward. Taguig is a pretty village, with thermal baths, and about\r\n4,000 inhabitants; its fish is said to be particularly fine. Near it\r\nis Pateros, which no doubt takes its name from the enormous quantity\r\nof artificially hatched ducks (patos) which are bred there, and which\r\nare seen in incredible numbers on the banks of the river. They are\r\nfed by small shell-fish found abundantly in the neighbouring lake,\r\nand which are brought in boats to the paterias on the banks of the\r\nPasig. This duck-raising is called Itig by the Indians. Each pateria\r\nis separated from its neighbour by a bamboo enclosure on the river,\r\nand at sunset the ducks withdraw from the water to adjacent buildings,\r\nwhere they deposit their eggs during the night, and in the morning\r\nreturn in long procession to the river. The eggs being collected\r\nare placed in large receptacles containing warm paddy husks, which\r\nare kept at the same temperature; the whole is covered with cloth,\r\nand they are removed by their owners as fast as they are hatched. We\r\nsaw hundreds of the ducklings running about in shallow bamboo baskets,\r\nwaiting to be transferred to the banks of the river. The friar at Pasig\r\ncame out from his convent to receive us. It is a populous pueblo,\r\ncontaining more than 22,000 souls. There is a school for Indian\r\nwomen. It has stone quarries worked for consumption in Manila, but\r\nthe stone is soft and brittle. The neighbourhood is adorned with\r\ngardens. Our host the friar had prepared for us in the convent a\r\ncollation, which was served with much neatness and attention, and\r\nwith cordial hospitality. Having reached the limits of his alcadia,\r\nthe kind magistrate and his attendants left us, and we entered a\r\nfalua (felucca) provided for us by the Intendente de Marina, with\r\na goodly number of rowers, and furnished with a carpet, cushions,\r\ncurtains, and other comfortable appliances. In this we started for\r\nthe Laguna, heralded by a band of musicians. The rowers stand erect,\r\nand at every stroke of the oar fling themselves back upon their seats;\r\nthey thus give a great impulse to the boat; the exertion appears very\r\nlaborious, yet their work was done with admirable good-humour, and\r\nwhen they were drenched with rain there was not a murmur. In the lake\r\n(which is called Bay) is an island, between which and the main land\r\nis a deep and dangerous channel named Quinabatasan, through which\r\nwe passed. The stream rushes by with great rapidity, and vessels are\r\noften lost in the passage. The banks are covered with fine fruit trees,\r\nand the hills rise grandly on all sides. Our destination was Santa\r\nCruz, and long before we arrived a pilot boat had been despatched in\r\norder to herald our coming. The sun had set, but we perceived, as we\r\napproached, that the streets were illuminated, and we heard the wonted\r\nIndian music in the distance. Reaching the river, we were conducted\r\nto a gaily-lighted and decorated raft, which landed us,--and a suite\r\nof carriages, in one of which was the Alcalde, who had come from his\r\nCabacera, or head quarters, to take charge of us,--conducted the party\r\nto a handsome house belonging to an opulent Indian, where we found,\r\nin the course of preparation, a very handsome dinner or supper,\r\nand all the notables of the locality, the priest, as a matter of\r\ncourse, among them, assembled to welcome the strangers. We passed\r\na theatre, which appeared hastily erected and grotesquely adorned,\r\nwhere, as we were informed, it was intended to exhibit an Indian\r\nplay in the Tagál language, for our edification and amusement. I was\r\ntoo unwell to attend, but I heard there was much talk on the stage\r\n(unintelligible, of course, to our party), and brandishing of swords,\r\nand frowns and fierce fighting, and genii hunting women into wild\r\nforests, and kings and queens gaily dressed. The stage was open from\r\nthe street to the multitude, of whom many thousands were reported to\r\nbe present, showing great interest and excitement. I was told that\r\nsome of the actors had been imported from Manila. The hospitality\r\nof our host was super-abundant, and his table crowded not only with\r\nnative but with many European luxuries. He was dressed as an Indian,\r\nand exhibited his wardrobe with some pride. He himself served us\r\nat his own table, and looked and moved about as if he were greatly\r\nhonoured by the service. His name, which I gratefully record, is\r\nValentin Valenzuela, and his brother has reached the distinction of\r\nbeing an ordained priest.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz has a population of about 10,000 souls. Many of its\r\ninhabitants are said to be opulent. The church is handsome; the\r\nroads in the neighbourhood broad and in good repair. There is much\r\ngame in the adjacent forests, but there is not much devotion to\r\nthe chase. Almost every variety of tropical produce grows in the\r\nvicinity. Wild honey is collected by the natives of the interior, and\r\nstuffs of cotton and abacá are woven for domestic use. The house to\r\nwhich we were invited was well furnished, but with the usual adornings\r\nof saints' images and vessels for holy water. In the evening the Tagála\r\nladies of the town and neighbourhood were invited to a ball, and the\r\nday was closed with the accustomed light-heartedness and festivity:\r\nthe bolero and the jota seemed the favourite attractions. Dance and\r\nmusic are the Indians' delight, and very many of the evenings we passed\r\nin the Philippines were devoted to these enjoyments. Next morning\r\nthe carriages of the Alcalde, drawn by the pretty little ponies of\r\nLuzon, conducted us to the casa real at Pagsanjan, the seat of the\r\ngovernment, or Cabacera, of the province, where we met with the usual\r\nwarm reception from our escort Señor Tafalla, the Alcalde. Pagsanjan\r\nhas about 5,000 inhabitants, being less populous than Biñan and other\r\npueblos in the province. Hospitality was here, as everywhere, the order\r\nof the day and of the night, all the more to be valued as there are no\r\ninns out of the capital, and no places of reception for travellers;\r\nbut he who is recommended to the authorities and patronized by the\r\nfriars will find nothing wanting for his accommodation and comfort,\r\nand will rather be surprised at the superfluities of good living than\r\nstruck with the absence of anything necessary. I have been sometimes\r\namazed when the stores of the convent furnished wines which had been\r\nkept from twenty to twenty-five years; and to say that the cigars and\r\nchocolate provided by the good friars would satisfy the most critical\r\nof critics, is only to do justice to the gifts and the givers.\r\n\r\nWe made an excursion to the pretty village of Lumbang, having,\r\nas customary, been escorted to the banks of the river, which forms\r\nthe limit of the pueblo, by the mounted principalia of Pagsanjan. The\r\ncurrent was strong, but a barge awaited us and conveyed us to the front\r\nof the convent on the other side, where the principal ecclesiastic,\r\na friar, conducted us to the reception rooms. We walked through the\r\npueblo, whose inhabitants amount to 5,000 Indians, occupying one\r\nlong broad street, where many coloured handkerchiefs and garments\r\nwere hung out as flags from the windows, which were crowded with\r\nspectators. We returned to the Cabacera, where we slept. Early in\r\nthe morning we took our departure from Pagsanjan.\r\n\r\nWe next advanced into the more elevated regions, growing more wild\r\nand wonderful in their beauties. As we proceeded the roads became\r\nworse and worse, and our horses had some difficulty in dragging the\r\ncarriages through the deep mud. We had often to ask for assistance\r\nfrom the Indians to extricate us from the ruts, and they came to our\r\naid with patient and persevering cheerfulness. When the main road was\r\nabsolutely impassable, we deviated into the forest, and the Indians,\r\nwith large knives--their constant companions--chopped down the impeding\r\nbushes and branches, and made for us a practicable way. After some\r\nhours' journey we arrived at Majayjay, and between files of Indians,\r\nwith their flags and music, were escorted to the convent, whence the\r\ngood Franciscan friar Maximo Rico came to meet us, and led us up the\r\nwide staircase to the vast apartments above. The pueblo has about\r\n8,500 inhabitants; the climate is humid, and its effects are seen\r\nin the magnificent vegetation which surrounds the place. The church\r\nand convent are by far the most remarkable of its edifices. Here\r\nwe are surrounded by mountain scenery, and the forest trees present\r\nbeautiful and various pictures. In addition to leaves, flowers and\r\nfruits of novel shapes and colours, the grotesque forms which the\r\ntrunks and branches of tropical trees assume, as if encouraged to\r\nindulge in a thousand odd caprices, are among the characteristics\r\nof these regions. The native population availed themselves of the\r\nrude and rugged character of the region to offer a long resistance\r\nto the Spaniards on their first invasion, and its traditional means\r\nof defence were reported to be so great that the treasures of Manila\r\nwere ordered to be transported thither on the landing of the English\r\nin 1762. Fortunately, say the Spanish historians, the arrangement\r\nwas not carried out, as the English had taken their measures for the\r\nseizure of the spoils, and it was found the locality could not have\r\nbeen defended against them.\r\n\r\nWe were now about to ascend the mountains, and were obliged to abandon\r\nour carriages. Palanquins, in which we had to stretch ourselves at\r\nfull length, borne each by eight bearers, and relays of an equal\r\nnumber, were provided for our accommodation. The Alcalde of the\r\nadjacent province of Tayabas had come down to Majayjay to invite us\r\ninto his district, where, he said, the people were on the tiptoe of\r\nexpectation, had made arrangements for our reception, and would be\r\nsadly disappointed if we failed to visit Lucban. We could not resist\r\nthe kind urgency of his representations, and deposited ourselves\r\nin the palanquins, which had been got ready for us, and were indeed\r\nwell rewarded. The paths through the mountains are such as have been\r\nmade by the torrents, and are frequently almost impassable from\r\nthe masses of rock brought down by the rushing waters. Sometimes\r\nwe had to turn back from the selected road, and choose another less\r\nimpracticable. In some places the mud was so deep that our bearers\r\nwere immersed far above their knees, and nothing but long practice\r\nand the assistance of their companions could have enabled them to\r\nextricate themselves or us from so disagreeable a condition. But\r\ncheerfulness and buoyancy of spirits, exclamations of encouragement,\r\nloud laughter, and a general and brotherly co-operation surmounted\r\nevery difficulty. Around us all was solitude, all silence, but the\r\nhum of the bees and the shrieks of the birds; deep ravines below,\r\ncovered with forest trees, which no axe of the woodman would ever\r\ndisturb; heights above still more difficult to explore, crowned with\r\narboreous glories; brooks and rivulets noisily descending to larger\r\nstreams, and then making their quiet way to the ocean receptacle. At\r\nlast we reached a plain on the top of a mountain, where two grandly\r\nadorned litters, with a great number of bearers, were waiting, and we\r\nwere welcomed by a gathering of graceful young women, all on ponies,\r\nwhich they managed with admirable agility. They were clad in the gayest\r\ndresses. The Alcalde called them his Amazonas; and a pretty spokeswoman\r\ninformed us, in very pure Castilian, that they were come to escort us\r\nto Lucban, which was about a league distant. The welcome was as novel\r\nas it was unexpected. I observed the Tagálas mounted indifferently\r\non the off or near side of their horses. Excellent equestrians were\r\nthey; and they galloped and caracolled to the right and the left, and\r\nflirted with their embellished whips. A band of music headed us; and\r\nthe Indian houses which we passed bore the accustomed demonstrations\r\nof welcome. The roads had even a greater number of decorations--arches\r\nof ornamented bamboos on both sides of the way, and firing of guns\r\nannouncing our approach. The Amazonas wore bonnets adorned with ribands\r\nand flowers,--all had kerchiefs of embroidered piña on their shoulders,\r\nand variously coloured skirts and gowns of native manufacture added\r\nto the picturesque effect. So they gambolled along--before, behind,\r\nor at our sides where the roads permitted it--and seemed quite at ease\r\nin all their movements. The convent was, as usual, our destination; the\r\npresiding friar--quite a man of the world--cordial, amusing, even witty\r\nin his colloquies. He had most hospitably provided for our advent. All\r\nthe principal people were invited to dinner. Many a joke went round,\r\nto which the friar contributed more than his share. Talking of the\r\nfair (if Indian girls can be so called), Captain Vansittart said he\r\nhad thirty unmarried officers on board the Magicienne.\r\n\r\n\"A bargain,\" exclaimed the friar; \"send them hither,--I will find\r\npretty wives for all of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must convert them first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! that is my part of the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will get the marriage fees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I forgot that?\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, or supper, as it was called, the Amazonas who had\r\nescorted us in the morning, accompanied by many more, were introduced;\r\nthe tables were cleared away; and when I left the hall for my bedroom,\r\nthe dancing was going on in full energy.\r\n\r\nNewspapers and books were lying about the rooms of the convent. The\r\nfriar had more curiosity than most of his order: conversation with\r\nhim was not without interest and instruction.\r\n\r\nWe returned by a different road to Majayjay, for the purpose of\r\nvisiting a splendid waterfall, where the descent of the river is\r\nreported to be 300 feet. We approached on a ledge of rock as near as\r\nwe could to the cataract, the roar of which was awful; but the quantity\r\nof mist and steam, which soon soaked our garments, obscured the vision\r\nand made it impossible for us to form any estimate of the depth of\r\nthe fall. It is surrounded by characteristic scenery--mountains and\r\nwoods--which we had no time to explore, and of which the natives\r\ncould give us only an imperfect account: they knew there were deer,\r\nwild boars, buffaloes, and other game, but none had penetrated the\r\nwilder regions. A traveller now and then had scrambled over the rocks\r\nfrom the foot to the top of the waterfall\r\n\r\nWe returned to Majayjay again to be welcomed and entertained by our\r\nhosts at the convent with the wonted hospitality; and taking leave\r\nof our Alcalde, we proceeded to Santa Cruz, where, embarking in our\r\nfelucca, we coasted along the lake and landed at Calamba, a pueblo of\r\nabout 4,000 inhabitants; carriages were waiting to convey us to Biñan,\r\nstopping a short time at Santa Rosa, where the Dominican friars, who\r\nare the proprietors of large estates in the neighbourhood, invited us\r\nas usual to their convent. We tarried there but a short time. The roads\r\nare generally good on the borders of the Laguna, and we reached Biñan\r\nbefore sunset, the Indians having in the main street formed themselves\r\nin procession as we passed along. Flags, branches of flowering forest\r\ntrees, and other devices, were displayed. First we passed between files\r\nof youths, then of maidens; and through a triumphal arch we reached\r\nthe handsome dwelling of a rich mestizo, whom we found decorated with\r\na Spanish order, which had been granted to his father before him. He\r\nspoke English, having been educated at Calcutta, and his house--a very\r\nlarge one--gave abundant evidence that he had not studied in vain the\r\narts of domestic civilization. The furniture, the beds, the tables,\r\nthe cookery, were all in good taste, and the obvious sincerity of\r\nthe kind reception added to its agreeableness. Great crowds were\r\ngathered together in the square which fronts the house of Don José\r\nAlberto. Indians brought their game-cocks to be admired, but we did\r\nnot encourage the display of their warlike virtues. There was much\r\nfiring of guns, and a pyrotechnic display when the sun had gone down,\r\nand a large fire balloon, bearing the inscription, \"The people of\r\nBiñan to their illustrious visitors,\" was successfully inflated, and\r\nsoaring aloft, was lost sight of in the distance, but was expected to\r\ntell the tale of our arrival to the Magicienne in Manila Bay. Biñan\r\nis a place of some importance. In it many rich mestizos and Indians\r\ndwell. It has more than 10,000 inhabitants. Large estates there are\r\npossessed by the Dominican friars, and the principal of them was\r\namong our earliest visitors. There, as elsewhere, the principalia,\r\nhaving conducted us to our head-quarters, came in a body to present\r\ntheir respects, the gobernadorcillo, who usually speaks Spanish, being\r\nthe organ of the rest. Inquiries about the locality, thanks for the\r\nhonours done us, were the commonplaces of our intercourse, but the\r\nnatives were always pleased when \"the strangers from afar\" seemed to\r\ntake an interest in their concerns. Nowhere did we see any marks of\r\npoverty; nowhere was there any crowding, or rudeness, or annoyance, in\r\nany shape. Actors and spectators seemed equally pleased; in fact, our\r\npresence only gave them another holiday, making but a small addition\r\nto their regular and appointed festivals. Biñan is divided by a river,\r\nand is about a mile from the Laguna. Its streets are of considerable\r\nwidth, and the neighbouring roads excellent. Generally the houses have\r\ngardens attached to them; some on a large scale. They are abundant\r\nin fruits of great variety. Rice is largely cultivated, as the river\r\nwith its confluents affords ample means of irrigation. The lands are\r\nusually rented from the Dominicans, and the large extent of some of\r\nthe properties assists economical cultivation. Until the lands are\r\nbrought into productiveness, little rent is demanded, and when they\r\nbecome productive the friars have the reputation of being liberal\r\nlandlords and allowing their tenants to reap large profits. It is said\r\nthey are satisfied with one-tenth of the gross produce. A tenant is\r\nseldom disturbed in possession if his rent be regularly paid. Much\r\nland is held by associations or companies known by the title of\r\nCasamahanes. There is an active trade between Biñan and Manila.\r\n\r\nGreatly gratified with all we had seen, we again embarked and crossed\r\nthe Laguna to Pasig. Descending by that charming river, we reached\r\nManila in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few sketches of the personal history of some of the captains-general\r\nof Manila will be an apt illustration of the general character of the\r\ngovernment, which, with some remarkable exceptions, appears to have\r\nbeen of a mild and paternal character; while the Indians exhibit,\r\nwhen not severely dealt with, much meekness and docility, and a\r\ngenerally willing obedience. The subjugation of the wild tribes of\r\nthe interior has not made the progress which might have been fairly\r\nlooked for; but the military and naval forces at the disposal of the\r\ncaptain-general have always been small when the extent of his authority\r\nis considered. In fact, many conquests have had to be abandoned from\r\ninadequacy of strength to maintain them. The ecclesiastical influences,\r\nwhich have been established among the idolatrous tribes, are weak when\r\nthey come in contact with any of the forms of Mahomedanism, as in the\r\nisland of Mindanao, where the fanaticism of Mussulman faith is quite\r\nas strong as that among the Catholics themselves. Misunderstandings\r\nbetween the Church and State could hardly be avoided where each has\r\nasserted a predominant power, and such misunderstandings have often\r\nled to the effusion of blood and the dislocation of government. Mutual\r\njealousies exist to the present hour, and as the friars, in what\r\nthey deem the interests of the people, are sometimes hostile to the\r\nviews of the civil authority, that authority has frequently a right\r\nto complain of being thwarted, or feebly aided, by the local clergy.\r\n\r\nWhile shortly recording the names of the captains-general to whom\r\nthe government of the Philippines has been confided, I will select\r\na few episodes from the history of the islands, which will show the\r\ncharacter of the administration, and assist the better understanding\r\nof the position of the people.\r\n\r\nMiguel Lope de Legaspi, a Biscayan, upon whom the title of Conqueror\r\nof the Philippines has been conferred, was the first governor, and\r\nwas nominated in 1565. He took possession of Manila in 1571, and died,\r\nit is said, of disgust and disappointment the following year. The city\r\nwas invaded by Chinese pirates during the government of his successor\r\nGuido de Lavezares, who repulsed them, and received high honours from\r\nhis sovereign, Philip II. Francisco de Saude founded in Camarines the\r\ncity of Nueva Caceres, to which he gave the name of the place of his\r\nbirth. He was a man of great ambition, who deposed one and enthroned\r\nanother sultan of Borneo, and modestly asked from the king of Spain\r\nauthority to conquer China, but was recommended to be less ambitious,\r\nand to keep peace with surrounding nations. Rinquillo de Peñarosa\r\nrescued Cagayan from a Japanese pirate, and founded New Segovia and\r\nArévalo in Panay; his nephew succeeded him, and in doing honour to\r\nhis memory set the Church of St. Augustin on fire; it spread to the\r\ncity, of which a large part was destroyed. In 1589, during the rule of\r\nSantiago de Vera, the only two ships which carried on the trade with\r\nNew Spain were destroyed by a hurricane in the port of Cavite. The\r\nnext governor, Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, sent to Japan the missionaries\r\nwho were afterwards put to death; he headed an expedition to Moluco,\r\nbut on leaving the port of Mariveles his galley was separated from the\r\nrest of the fleet; the Chinese crew rose, murdered him, and fled in\r\nhis vessel to Cochin China. His son Luis followed him as governor. A\r\nFranciscan friar, who had accompanied the unfortunate expedition of\r\nhis father, informed him that he would find, as he did, his patent of\r\nappointment in a box which the Chinese had landed in the province of\r\nIlocos, and his title was in consequence recognised. Francisco Tello\r\nde Guzman, who entered upon the government in 1596, was unfortunate\r\nin his attempts to subdue the natives of Mindanao, as was one of his\r\ncaptains, who had been sent to drive away the Dutch from Mariveles.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1603 three mandarins arrived in Manila from China. They\r\nsaid that a Chinaman, whom they brought as a prisoner, had assured the\r\nEmperor that the island of Cavite was of gold, that the Chinaman had\r\nstaked his life upon his veracity, and that they had come to learn the\r\ntruth of his story. They soon after left, having been conducted by the\r\ngovernor to examine Cavite for themselves. A report speedily spread\r\nthat an invasion of the Philippines by a Chinese army of 100,000 was\r\nin contemplation, and a Chinese called Eng Kang, who was supposed to\r\nbe a great friend of the Europeans, was charged with a portion of the\r\ndefences. A number of Japanese, the avowed enemies of the Chinese,\r\nwere admitted to the confidence of the governor, and communicated to\r\nthe Chinese the information that the government suspected a plot. A\r\nplot there was, and it was said the Chinese determined on a rising,\r\nand a general massacre of the Spaniards on the vespers of St. Francis'\r\nday. A Philippine woman, who was living with a Chinaman, denounced the\r\nproject to the curate of Quiapo, who advised the governor. A number\r\nof the conspirators were assembled at a half-league's distance from\r\nManila, and Eng Kang was sent with some Spaniards to put down the\r\nmovement. The attempt failed, and Eng Kang was afterwards discovered to\r\nhave been one of the principal promoters of the insurrection. In the\r\nevening the Chinese attacked Quiapo and Tondo, murdering many of the\r\nnatives. They were met by a body of 130 Spaniards, nearly all of whom\r\nperished, and their heads were sent to Parian, which the insurgents\r\ncaptured, and besieged the city of Manila from Dilao. The danger led\r\nto great exertions on the part of the Spaniards, the ecclesiastics\r\ntaking a very active part. The Chinese endeavoured to scale the walls,\r\nbut were repulsed. The monks declared that St. Francis had appeared in\r\nperson to encourage them. The Chinese withdrew to their positions, but\r\nthe Spaniards sallied out from the citadel, burnt and destroyed Parian,\r\nand pursued the flying Chinese to Cabuyao. New reinforcements arrived,\r\nand the flight of the Chinese continued as far as the province of\r\nBatangas, where they were again attacked and dispersed. It is said that\r\nof 24,000 revolted Chinese only one hundred escaped, who were reserved\r\nfor the galleys. About 2,000 Chinese were left, who had not involved\r\nthemselves in the movement. Eng Kang was decapitated, and his head\r\nexposed in an iron cage. It was three years after this insurrection\r\nthat the Court of Madrid had the first knowledge of its existence.\r\n\r\nPedro de Acuña, after the suppression of this revolt, conquered\r\nTernate, and carried away the king, but died suddenly, in 1606,\r\nafter governing four years. Cristobal Tellez, during his short rule,\r\ndestroyed a settlement of the Japanese in Dilao. Juan de Silva brought\r\nwith him, in 1609, reinforcements of European troops, and in the\r\nseventh year of his government, made great preparations for attacking\r\nthe Dutch, but died after a short illness. In 1618, Alonzo Fajardo came\r\nto the Philippines, with conciliatory orders as regarded the natives,\r\nand was popular among them. He punished a revolt in Buhol, sent an\r\nunsuccessful mission to Japan, and in a fit of jealousy killed his\r\nwife. Suspecting her infidelity, he surprised her at night in a house,\r\nwhere she had been accustomed to give rendezvous to her paramour, and\r\nfound her in a dress which left no doubt of her crime. The governor\r\ncalled in a priest, commanded him to administer the sacrament, and,\r\nspite of the prayers of the ecclesiastic, he put her to death by a stab\r\nfrom his own dagger. This was in 1622. Melancholy took possession of\r\nhim, and he died in 1624. Two interim governors followed. Juan Niño\r\nde Tabera arrived in 1626. He brought with him 600 troops, drove the\r\nDutch from their holds, and sent Olaso, a soldier, celebrated for his\r\ndeeds in Flanders, against the Jolo Indians; but Olaso failed utterly,\r\nand returned to Manila upon his discomfiture.\r\n\r\nA strange event took place in 1630. The holy sacrament had been stolen\r\nin a glass vase, from the cathedral. A general supplication (rogativa)\r\nwas ordered; the archbishop issued from his palace barefooted, his\r\nhead covered with ashes, and a rope round his neck, wandering about\r\nto discover where the vase was concealed. All attempts having failed,\r\nso heavy were the penitences, and so intolerable the grief of the holy\r\nman, that he sank under the calamity, and a fierce contest between\r\nthe ecclesiastical and civil functionaries was the consequence of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 there was a large arrival of rich converted Japanese,\r\nwho fled from the fierce persecutions to which the Christians had\r\nbeen subjected in Japan; but a great many Catholic missionaries\r\nhastened to that country, in order to be honoured with the crown of\r\nmartyrdom. Another remarkable ecclesiastical quarrel took place at this\r\ntime. A commissary, lately arrived from Europe, ordered that all the\r\nfriars with beards should be charged with the missions to China and\r\nJapan; and all the shorn friars should remain in the Philippines. The\r\narchbishop opposed this, as the Pope's bulls had no regulations about\r\nbeards. Fierce debates were also excited by the exercise of the right\r\nof asylum to criminals, having committed offences, either against the\r\nmilitary or the civil authority. The archbishop excommunicated--the\r\ncommandant of artillery rebelled. The archbishop fined him--the\r\nvicar apostolic confirmed the sentence. The Audiencia annulled the\r\nproceedings--the Bishop of Camarines was called on as the arbiter,\r\nand absolved the commandant. Appeals followed, and one of the parties\r\nwas accused of slandering the Most Holy Father. The Jesuits took part\r\nagainst the archbishop, who called all the monks together, and they\r\nfined the Jesuits 4,000 dollars. The governor defended the Jesuits,\r\nand required the revocation of the sentence in six hours. The quarrel\r\ndid not end here: but there was a final compromise, each party making\r\nsome concessions to the other.\r\n\r\nThe disasters which followed the insurrection of Eng Kang did not\r\nprevent the influx of Chinese into the islands, and especially\r\ninto the province of Laguna, where another outbreak, in which it\r\nis said 30,000 Chinese took part, occurred in 1639. They divided\r\nthemselves into guerrillas, who devastated the country; but were\r\nsubdued in the following year, seven thousand having surrendered at\r\ndiscretion. Spanish historians say that the hatred of the Indians to\r\nthe Chinese awaked them from their habitual apathy, and that in the\r\ndestruction of the intruders they exhibited infinite zeal and activity.\r\n\r\nIn the struggles between the natives and the Spaniards, even the\r\nmissionaries were not always safe, and the Spaniards were often\r\nbetrayed by those in whom they placed the greatest confidence. The\r\nheavy exactions and gabelles inflicted on the Indians under Fajardo\r\nled to a rising in Palopag, when the Jesuit curate was killed and the\r\nconvent and church sacked. The movement spread through several of the\r\nislands, and many of the prisoners were delivered in Caraga to the\r\nkeeping of an Indian, called Dabao, who so well fulfilled his mission,\r\nthat when the governor came to the fortress, to claim the captives,\r\nDabao seized and beheaded his Excellency, and, with the aid of the\r\nprisoners, destroyed most of the Spaniards in the neighbourhood,\r\nincluding the priests; so that only six, among whom was an Augustine\r\nbarefooted friar, escaped, and fled to the capital. Reinforcements\r\nhaving arrived from Manila, the Indians surrendered, being promised\r\na general pardon. \"The promise,\" says the Spanish historian, \"was not\r\nkept; but the leaders of the insurrection were hanged, and multitudes\r\nof the Indians sent to prison.\" The governor-general \"did not approve\r\nof this violation of a promise made in the king's name,\" but ordered\r\nthe punishment of the Spanish chiefs, and the release of such natives\r\nas remained in prison.\r\n\r\nIn 1645, for two months there was a succession of fearful\r\nearthquakes. In Cagayan a mountain was overturned, and a whole town\r\nengulfed at its foot. Torrents of water and mud burst forth in many\r\nplaces. All the public buildings in the capital were destroyed,\r\nexcept the convent and the church of the Augustines, and that of the\r\nJesuits. Six hundred persons were buried in Manila under the ruins of\r\ntheir houses, and 3,000 altogether are said to have lost their lives.\r\n\r\nDe Lara was distinguished for his religious sentiments. On his arrival\r\nin 1653 he refused to land till the archbishop had preceded him\r\nand consecrated the ground on which he was to tread. He celebrated a\r\njubilee under the authority of the Pope, by which the country was to be\r\npurified from \"the crimes, censures, and excommunications\" with which,\r\nfor so many years, it had been afflicted. The archbishop, from an\r\nelevated platform in Manila, blessed the islands and their inhabitants\r\nin the presence of an immense concourse of people. Reconciliations,\r\nconfessions, restitutions followed these \"days of sanctity;\" but\r\nthe benedictions seem to have produced little benefit, as they\r\nwere followed by earthquakes, tempests, insurrections, unpunished\r\npiracies, and, in the words of a Spanish writer, \"a web of anxieties\r\nand calamities.\" Missionaries were sent to convert the Mahomedans,\r\nbut they were put to death, and many professed converts turned\r\ntraitors. Kung Sing, the piratical chief, who had conquered Formosa,\r\nand who had 1,000 junks and 100,000 men under his orders, had sent\r\nan envoy to Manila demanding the subjection of the islands to his\r\nauthority or threatening immediate invasion. The threat created a\r\ngeneral alarm: the Chinese were all ordered to quit the country;\r\nthey revolted, and almost all were murdered. \"It is wonderful,\" says\r\nDe Mas, \"that any Chinamen should have come to the Philippines after\r\nthe repeated slaughters\" of their countrymen at different periods,\r\nthough it is certain they have often brought down the thunderbolt\r\non their own heads. De Lara, having been accused of corruption,\r\nwas fined 60,000 dollars, pardoned, and returned to Spain, where he\r\nbecame an ecclesiastic, and died in Malaga, his native city.\r\n\r\nThe \"religiosity,\" to use a Spanish word, of De Lara was followed\r\nby a very different temper in his successor, Salcedo, a Belgian\r\nby birth, nominated in 1663. He quarrelled with the priests, fined\r\nand condemned to banishment the archbishop, kept him standing while\r\nwaiting for an audience, insulted him when he had obtained it; and on\r\nthe death of the archbishop a few months afterwards, there were royal\r\nfiestas, while the services De Profundis, in honour of the dead, were\r\nprohibited as incompatible with the civil festivities. The Inquisition\r\ninterfered in the progress of time, and its agents, assisted by an\r\nold woman servant, who held the keys, entered the palace, found the\r\nGovernor asleep, put irons upon him, and carried him a prisoner to the\r\nAugustine convent. They next shipped him off to be tried by the Holy\r\nOffice in Mexico, but he died on his way thither. The King of Spain\r\ncancelled and condemned the proceedings, confiscated the property of\r\nthose who had been concerned in them, and directed all that had been\r\nseized belonging to Salcedo to be restored to his heirs.\r\n\r\nManuel de Leon, in 1669, obtained great reputation among the\r\necclesiastics. He governed for eight years and left all his property\r\nto obras pias. His predecessor, Manuel de la Peña Bonifaz (nominated\r\nprovisionally), had refused to surrender his authority. He was declared\r\nan intruder, his goods were confiscated, and his arrest was ordered,\r\nbut he sought refuge in the convent of the Recoletos, where he died. A\r\nquarrel took place between the competitors for the provisional\r\ngovernment--the one appointed enjoyed his authority only for six\r\nmonths. He was, on his death, succeeded by his competitor, who was\r\ndisplaced by Juan de Vargas Hurtado in 1678. Great misunderstandings\r\nbetween the clergy and the civilians took place about this time. The\r\ngovernor was excommunicated, having been ordered on every holiday to\r\nappear in the cathedral and in the churches of Parcan and Binondo,\r\nbarefooted and with a rope round his neck. Refusing to submit to such a\r\ndegradation, he lived a solitary life, excluded from all intercourse,\r\non the banks of the river, until he obtained permission to embark\r\nfor New Spain; he died broken-hearted on the voyage.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in looking over the ancient records of the\r\nPhilippines, that the sole historians are the monks, and that their\r\napplause or condemnation can hardly be deemed a disinterested\r\nor equitable judgment. Hurtado is accused by them of many acts\r\nof despotism: they say that, in order to accomplish his objects,\r\nhe menaced the friars with starvation, and by guards, prevented\r\nfood reaching the convents; that he interfered with the election of\r\necclesiastics, persecuted and ordered the imprisonment of Bonifaz, his\r\nimmediate predecessor (provisionally appointed), who fled to a convent\r\nof Recoletos (barefooted Augustines), and was protected by them. The\r\nJesuits denied his claim to protection, but during the controversy\r\nBonifaz died, and the records remain to exhibit another specimen of\r\nthe bitterness of the odium theologicum and of the unity and harmony\r\nof which the Church of Rome sometimes boasts as the results of her\r\ninfallibility. The archbishop was at this time quarrelling with the\r\ncivil tribunals, to which he addressed his mandamus, and answered\r\ntheir recalcitrancy by reminding them that all secular authority\r\nwas subordinate to ecclesiastical. The archbishop was placed under\r\narrest and ordered to be banished by the Audiencia. He was conveyed by\r\nforce in his pontifical robes to the vessel which transported him to\r\nPangasinan. The Dominicans, to whose order the archbishop belonged,\r\nlaunched their excommunications and censures, and troops were sent\r\nto the convent to prevent the ringing of bells and the alarm and\r\ngathering of the people. The provincial, who had taken the active\r\npart in resistance, was, with other friars, ordered to be banished\r\nto Spain. When about to be removed, the dean commanded the soldiers\r\npresent to kiss the provincial's feet and do him all honour while he\r\npoured out his benedictions on the recalcitrant friars. In the midst\r\nof all this confusion a new governor (Curuzcalegui) arrived, in 1684,\r\nwho took part with the clergy, and declared himself in favour of the\r\nbanished archbishop, and condemned his judges to banishment. One of\r\nthem fled to the Jesuit's College, a sanctuary, but was seized by\r\nthe troops. This by no means settled the quarrel, the following out\r\nof which is too complicated and too uninteresting to invite further\r\nscrutiny here.\r\n\r\nIn 1687 the King of Spain sent out a commissioner to inquire into the\r\ntroubles that reigned in the Philippines. The Pope had taken up the\r\ncause of the more violent of the clergy, and Pardo (the archbishop),\r\nthus encouraged in his intemperance, declared the churches of the\r\nJesuits desecrated in which the bodies of the civilians had been\r\nburied, who had adjudicated against the monks. Their remains were\r\ndisinterred, but most of the judges who had defended the rights of\r\nthe State against the ecclesiastical invasions were dead before\r\nthe commissioner arrived; and, happily for the public peace, the\r\nturbulent prelate himself died in 1689. Curuzcalegui also died in\r\n1689. After a short provisional interregnum (during which Valenzuela,\r\nthe Spanish minister, who had been banished to the Philippines by\r\nCharles II., on his return homeward, was killed by the kick of a\r\nhorse in Mexico), Fausto Cruzat y Gongora, was in 1690 invested\r\nwith the government. His rule is most remarkable for its financial\r\nprosperity. It lasted for eleven years, for his successor, Domingo\r\nde Zubalburo, though nominated in 1694, did not arrive till 1701. He\r\nimproved the harbour, but was dismissed by the King of Spain in\r\nconsequence of his having admitted a Papal Legate à latere without\r\nrequiring the presentation of his credentials. The Audiencia demanded\r\nthem, and the Legate replied he was surprised at their venturing to\r\nquestion his powers. He frightened the people by this assumption,\r\nand proceeded to found a college in the name of St. Clement. The\r\nking was so exasperated that he ordered the college to be demolished,\r\nfined the Oidores (judges) a thousand dollars, and removed the dean\r\nfrom his office. Martin de Ursua y Arrimendi arrived in 1709, and died\r\nmuch regretted in 1715; he checked the influx of the Chinese, and thus\r\nconciliated popular prejudices. The interim governor, Jose Torralba,\r\nwas accused of peculation to the amount of 700,000 dollars. He was\r\ncalled on by royal order to reimburse and find security for 40,000\r\ndollars; but failing was sent to prison in fetters. He was ordered\r\nafterwards to be sent to Spain, but agreed to pay 120,000 dollars. He\r\nhad not the money, and died a beggar. Fernando Bustillo (Bustamente)\r\nlanded in 1717. He spent large sums in useless embassies, and lived\r\nostentatiously and expensively. He set about financial reforms, and\r\nimprisoned many persons indebted to the State. He seized some of the\r\nprincipal inhabitants of the capital, menaced the judges, who fled to\r\nthe convents for protection. The governor took Torralba into favour,\r\nreleasing him from prison, and using him to undermine the authority\r\nof the Audiencia, by investing him with its powers. He ordered that\r\non the discharge of a piece of artillery, all the Spaniards should\r\nrepair to the palace: he arrested the archbishop, the chapter of the\r\ncathedral, several prelates and ecclesiastics, when a tumult followed;\r\ncrowds rushed to the palace; they killed the governor and his son, who\r\nhad hurried thither to defend his father. Francisco de la Cuesta was\r\ncalled upon to take charge of the government. The remaining children\r\nof Bustillo were sent to Mexico, and the Audiencia made a report of\r\nwhat had taken place to the king, who appointed Toribio José Cosio\r\ny Campo, and directed the punishment of those who had caused the\r\nformer governor's death; but under the influence of a Franciscan monk,\r\nCosio was induced to consent to various delays, so that nothing was\r\ndone in the matter, and the government in 1729 was transferred to\r\nFernando Valdes y Tamon, who reformed the military exercises, sent\r\nan expedition to conquer the island of Palaos, failed in the attempt,\r\nand was succeeded by a Fleming, Gaspar de la Torre, in 1739. He dealt\r\nso severely with the fiscal Arroyo as to cause his death. He was\r\ndisliked, became morose and solitary, and died in 1745. The bishop\r\nelect of Ilocos, father John Arrechedera, was the next governor,\r\nand the Sultan of Jolo, who desired to be baptized, visited him in\r\nManila. The archbishop, to whom the matter was referred, declared\r\nthat the Sultan had been received into the bosom of the Church by the\r\nDominican friars of Panogui. The Marquis of Obando took possession of\r\nthe government in 1750. The archbishop, whom he displaced, had received\r\norders from the Spanish Cabinet to expel the Chinese from the islands;\r\nbut whether from the honest conviction that the execution of the order\r\nwould be pernicious to the permanent interests of the Philippines--in\r\nwhich judgment he was perfectly right--or (as the natives avow) from\r\nan unwarrantable affection for the Chinese, he, on various pretexts,\r\ndelayed the publication of the royal mandate. Obando involved himself\r\nin quarrels with the Mussulman inhabitants of Mindanao, for which he\r\nhad made no adequate preparation. He determined to restore the Sultan\r\nof Jolo, but on reaching Zamboanga he proceeded against the Sultan\r\nfor unfaithfulness (infidencia), sent him to Manila, and caused him\r\nto be put into prison. The Mahomedans revolted. Obando desired to\r\ntake the command against them. The Audiencia objected to the exposure\r\nof the person of the governor. The expedition failed, and disorders\r\nincreased. He left the government in a most unsatisfactory state,\r\nand died on his way homewards. Pedro Manuel de Arandia assumed the\r\ngovernment in 1754. He had some successes against the Mahomedans\r\n(or Moors, as they are generally called by Spanish writers). He\r\nintended to restore the Sultan of Jolo, but he involved himself in\r\nquarrels with the clergy, and his proceedings were disapproved by\r\nthe Spanish Court. His unpopularity led to a fixed melancholy, under\r\nwhose influences he died in 1759. Though he left his property for\r\ncharitable purposes, the fact of its amounting to 250,000 dollars is\r\nurged as evidence of the corrupt character of his administration. The\r\nBishop of Zebu, followed by the Archbishop of Manila, Manuel Royo,\r\nheld the government provisionally on the death of Arandia. It was Royo\r\nwho surrendered Manila, and transferred the island to the British\r\nin 1762. [6] He was made a prisoner, and died in prison in 1764,\r\nof grief and shame it was said. Simon de Anda y Salazar, one of the\r\njudges of the Royal Audiencia, was charged with the government during\r\nthe possession of the capital by the English, and established his\r\nauthority in Pampanga, where he maintained himself till the arrival of\r\nFrancisco de la Torre, who was provisionally appointed by the Crown,\r\nand who, through Anda, received back Manila from the British. José\r\nRaon took possession of the government in 1766.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan of Jolo, replaced on his throne by the English, caused\r\ngreat molestations to the island of Mindanao, against Raon, who\r\nwas unable to protect his countrymen. The expulsion of the Jesuits\r\nhaving been determined on, the secret purpose was communicated to\r\nthe Governor. He was accused of having divulged, and of concealing a\r\nwriting-desk supposed to contain important documents. He was ordered\r\nto be imprisoned in his own house, where he died.\r\n\r\nOne of the monkish historians gives the following account of the\r\nmanner in which the rebellious Indians were disposed of:--\"Arza, with\r\nthe efficacious aid of the Augustin fathers, and of the faithful (who\r\nwere many), went to Vigan, and repeated what he had done in Cagallan;\r\nfor he hanged more than a hundred, and among them Doña Gabriela,\r\nthe wife of Silang, a mestiza of malas mañas (bad tricks), not less\r\nvaliant than her husband, the notary, and a great many cabecillas\r\n(heads of groups of families), who fled to the mountains of Alva; as\r\nto the rest of the rabble of this revolted crew, he was satisfied with\r\ngiving them each two hundred lashes, while exposed on the pillory. He\r\nsent 3,000 Ilocos triumphant and rich with booty to Pangasinan. This\r\nwas in 1763.\" [7]\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Manila by the British, they were naturally\r\nsuspected and accused of fomenting and encouraging the many\r\ninsurrections which followed that event. The impetuous and despotic\r\ncharacter of Anda, who assumed the governorship of the islands, had\r\nmade him many enemies, and he seems to have considered all opposition\r\nto his arbitrary measures as evidence of treacherous confederation\r\nwith the English. No doubt their presence was welcomed, especially by\r\nthe Mussulman population of the southern islands, as affording them\r\nsome hopes of relief from Spanish oppression; but even the Philippine\r\nhistorians do justice to the British authorities, and state that they\r\npunished the piratical acts of their allies, without distinction of\r\npersons. The Spaniards, however, encouraged Tenteng, a Mahomedan dato\r\n(chieftain), to attack the British, whose garrison, in Balambangan,\r\nwas reduced by sickness from 400 men to seventy-five infantry and\r\ntwenty-eight artillery. But it was, says De Mas, \"solely in expectation\r\nof booty.\" From the woods in the night they stole down on the English\r\nwhile they were asleep, set fire to the houses, and murdered all\r\nbut six of the garrison, who escaped in a boat with the English\r\ncommandant; they then hoisted the white flag, and did not spare the\r\nlife of a single Englishman left on shore. The Mahomedans seized much\r\nspoil in arms and money. The Sultan of Jolo and the datos, fearing the\r\nvengeance of the English, disclaimed all participation in the affair;\r\nbut on Tenteng's reaching Jolo, and delivering up his plunder to the\r\nauthorities, they, \"thinking there were now arms and money enough to\r\nresist both Spaniards and English,\" declared Tenteng to be a hero,\r\nand well deserving of his country. A few months afterwards, a British\r\nship of war appeared, and obtained such reparation as the case allowed.\r\n\r\nAnda had won so much credit for resisting the English, that he\r\nwas rewarded by his sovereign with many honours, made Councillor of\r\nCastile, and returned as governor to Manila, in 1770. He imprisoned his\r\npredecessor, many of the judges, the government secretary, a colonel,\r\nand other persons. He sent some to Spain, and banished others from the\r\ncapital. He involved himself in ecclesiastical quarrels, met with many\r\nvexations, and retired to the estate of the Recoleto friars, where\r\nhe died in 1766. De Mas says, in reference to this period:--\"For\r\nmore than two centuries, the Philippines had been for the crown\r\nof Spain a hotbed of so many disputes, anxieties, and expenses,\r\nthat the abandonment of the colony was again and again proposed by\r\nthe ministers; but the Catholic monarchs could never consent to the\r\nperdition of all the souls that had been conquered, and which it was\r\nstill hoped to conquer, in these regions.\" After a short interregnum\r\ntemporarily filled by Pedro Sarrio, José Basco arrived in 1778. He\r\nestablished the tobacco monopoly, sent off to Europe three judges,\r\nand compelled other functionaries to quit the capital, but, after two\r\nyears' occupation of the gubernatorial seat, he returned to Spain,\r\nand obtained other employment from the crown. Pedro Sarrio was again\r\ninvested with the temporary authority. Felix Berenguer de Marquina\r\narrived in 1788, and ruled six years. He was accused of corruption, but\r\nabsolved by the king. Rafael Maria de Aguilar was nominated in 1793.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the governor-general having consulted the assessor on\r\nthe conduct to be observed towards the Mussulman pirates who had\r\nentered the port of Manila, received a reply which is somewhat\r\ngrandiloquent:--\"It is time all the royal wishes should be fulfilled,\r\nand that these islands cease to be tributaries to a vile and\r\ndespicable Mahomedan. Let him feel the direful visitations of a\r\nnation, whose reputation has been so often offended and outraged,\r\nbut which has tolerated and concealed its wrongs the better to\r\ninflict its vengeance; let the crown be cleansed from the tarnish,\r\nwhich in this port, and in the sight of so many European nations,\r\nit has received from the low rabble (canalla). The repeated disasters\r\nof the Indians appear to have rendered Spaniards insensible; yet is\r\nthere a man who, having witnessed the desolation, murders, ruin of\r\nfamilies, has not his soul moved with a desire of revenge against\r\nthe desolator and destroyer? Were they our wives, sons, fathers,\r\nbrothers, with what clamour should we call on the authorities to\r\npunish the criminal, and to restore our freedom.... Justice, pity,\r\nthe obligation of your consciences, upon which the royal conscience\r\nreposes, all plead together.... Eternal memory for him who shall\r\nrelease us from the yoke which has oppressed us for ages!\"\r\n\r\nA treaty was concluded between the government of Manila and the Sultan\r\nof Mindanao in 1805. The Sultan's minister of state was a Mexican\r\ndeserter; the ambassador of the Spaniards a Mexican convict. He was,\r\nin truth, hardly dealt with, for, after making the treaty, he was\r\nordered to fulfil the term of his transportation.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, a conspiracy broke out in Ilocos, where a new god was\r\nproclaimed by the Indians, under the name of Lungao. There was a\r\nhierarchy of priests appointed in his honour. They made their first\r\nattempts to convert the idolaters in Cagayan, and to engage them to\r\ntake part against the Spaniards. The Catholic missionaries were the\r\nspecial object of their dislike, but the information which these\r\necclesiastics gave to the authorities enabled them to suppress the\r\nrebellion and to punish the leaders.\r\n\r\nThe cholera invaded Manila in 1819. A massacre of foreigners and\r\nChinese was the consequence, who were accused (especially the English)\r\nof poisoning the wells. Robberies and other excesses followed the\r\nmurders. The Host was paraded in vain through the streets. The carnage\r\nceased when no more victims were to be found, but Spanish persons\r\nand property were respected.\r\n\r\nUnder the government of Martinez, in 1823, a rising took, place,\r\nheaded by Novales, a Manilaman in the Spanish service. As many as 800\r\nof the troops joined the movement. They took possession of the palace,\r\nmurdered the king's lieutenant, and, according to all appearances,\r\nwould have overthrown the government, had there been any organization\r\nor unity of purpose. But a few courageous men gathered around them\r\nnumbers faithful to the king and the royalist party. Soldiers arrived;\r\nthe insurgents faltered; the inconstant people began to distrust\r\nthe revolutionary leaders, and Novales was left with one piece of\r\nartillery, and about 300 to 400 followers. Overpowered, he fled, but\r\nwas compelled to surrender. He was brought to a drumhead court-martial,\r\ndeclared he had no accomplices, but was the sole seducer of the troops,\r\nand was shot with one of his sergeants the same day. Amnesty was\r\nproclaimed, after twenty non-commissioned officers had been executed.\r\n\r\nA serious insurrection broke out in Tayabas during the short rule of\r\nOraa (1841-43). The Spaniards say it was the work of a Tagál called\r\nApolinano, lay-brother of the convent of Lucban, not twenty years\r\nold, who established a brotherhood (Cofradia) exclusively confined\r\nto the native Indians. The object does not seem to have been known,\r\nbut the meetings of the Cofrades excited alarms and suspicions. The\r\narchbishop called on the captain-general to put down the assemblies,\r\nwhich in some places had sought legalization from the authorities. The\r\narrest of Apolinano was ordered, upon which he fled to the mountains,\r\nwhere he was joined by 3,000 Indians, and it was reported in Manila\r\nthat he had raised the cry of rebellion in Igsavan. On this the Alcalde\r\nmayor, accompanied by two Franciscan friars, a few troops, and two\r\nsmall pieces of artillery, marched upon the denounced rebels. They\r\nfired upon the Spaniards and killed the Alcalde. On the news reaching\r\nthe capital, a force of about 800 men was collected. It is said the\r\npositions held by Apolinano were impregnable, but he had not kept the\r\npromises he had made to the Indians, that sundry miracles were to be\r\nwrought in their favour. Only a few advanced to meet the Spaniards,\r\nand many of these were killed and the rest took to flight. Almost\r\nwithout loss on their own side, the Spaniards left above 240 Indians\r\ndead on the field, and shot 200 whom they made prisoners. Apolinano,\r\nin endeavouring to cross a river, was seized by two of his own people,\r\nbound, and delivered over to the authorities. He was accused of\r\naspiring to be King of the Tagálos. He averred that the objects of\r\nhis Cofradia were purely and simply religious. He was shot on the 4th\r\nof November, 1841. De Mas says he knew him, and that he was a quiet,\r\nsober, unobtrusive young man, exhibiting nothing of the hero or the\r\nadventurer. He performed menial services at the convent of Lucban;\r\nand as far as I can discover, the main ground of suspicion was, that\r\nhe admitted no Spaniards or Mestizos into his religious fraternity;\r\nbut that so many lives should have been sacrificed to a mere suspicion\r\nis a sad story.'\r\n\r\nBetween 1806 and 1844 no less than fourteen governors followed\r\none another. Among them Narciso Claveria (1844-49) is entitled\r\nto notice. He added the island of Balanguingui to the Spanish\r\npossessions. One of his declarations obtained for him great\r\napplause--that \"he had left Spain torn by civil dissensions, but that\r\nhe should make no distinctions between his countrymen on the ground of\r\npolitical differences, but forget all title except that of Español y\r\nCaballero (Spaniard and gentleman).\" Since that time Ramon Montero has\r\nbeen their Governor ad interim, viz., in 1853, 1854, and 1856. The\r\nMarquis of Novaliches took possession of the government in 1854,\r\nbut held it only for about eight months. Don Manuel Crespo arrived\r\nin November, 1854, and the present Governor-General, Don Fernando de\r\nNorzagaray, on the 9th of March, 1857.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that during the period in which there have been\r\nseventy-eight governors, there have been only twenty-two archbishops;\r\nthe average period of the civil holding being four years--that of\r\nthe ecclesiastical, eleven and a-half years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY--CLIMATE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted theory as to the formation of the Philippines\r\nis, that they all formed part of a vast primitive continent, which was\r\nbroken up by some great convulsion of nature, and that these islands\r\nare the scattered fragments of that continent. Buzeta supposes that\r\nfrom Luzon the other islands were detached. [8]\r\n\r\nThe Indians have a tradition that the earth was borne on the shoulders\r\nof a giant, who, getting tired of his heavy burden, tumbled it into\r\nthe ocean, leaving nothing above the waters but the mountains, which\r\nbecame islands for the salvation of the human race.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to give a detailed geographical description of\r\nthe Philippine Islands. Buzeta's two octavo volumes will furnish\r\nthe most accurate particulars with which I am acquainted as to the\r\nvarious localities. The facts which I collected in the course of my\r\npersonal observation refer specially to the islands of Luzon, Panay,\r\nand Mindanao. The more general information has been derived from\r\nSpanish authorities on the spot, or has been found in Spanish books\r\nwhich I have consulted. I cannot presume to consider the present\r\nvolume as complete or exhaustive, but it will contribute something\r\nto augment that knowledge which is already possessed.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Philippine Archipelago is about 300 leagues from\r\nnorth to south, and 180 leagues from east to west. The islands of\r\nwhich it is composed are innumerable, most of the larger ones having\r\nsome Spanish or mestizo population. A range of irregular mountains\r\nruns through the centre of the whole. Those known by the name of the\r\nCaraballos, in Luzon, are occupied by unsubdued races of idolatrous\r\nIndians, and extend for nearly sixty leagues. Several large rivers\r\nhave their sources in the Caraballos. At the top of Mount Cabunian,\r\nwhose ascent is very difficult, there is a tomb worshipped by the\r\npagan Igorrotes. There are large lakes in several of the islands, and\r\nduring the rainy season some of them become enormously extended. These\r\ninundations are naturally favourable to the vegetable productions by\r\nfertilizing vast tracts of land. Mindanao, which means \"Men of the\r\nlake,\" has its Indian name from the abundance of its inward waters,\r\nin the same way that La Laguna has been adopted by the Spaniards as\r\nthe designation of the province bordering on the Lake of Bay. In this\r\nlatter district are many mineral and thermal springs, which have given\r\nto one of its pueblos the name of Los Baños (the baths). One of them\r\nissues from the source at a temperature of 67° of Reaumur. They are\r\nmuch visited by the inhabitants of Manila. There are boiling springs\r\nin the pueblo of Mainit.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Philippines is little distinguished from that\r\nwhich characterizes many other tropical regions of the East. It is\r\ndescribed in a Spanish proverb as--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Seis meses de polvo,\r\n                    Seis meses de lodo,\r\n                    Seis meses de todo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Six months of dust, six months of mud, six months of\r\neverything;\"--though it may generally be stated that the rainy season\r\nlasts one half, and the dry season the other half of the year. There\r\nare, however, as the distich says, many months of uncertainty, in which\r\nhumidity invades the ordinary time of drought, and drought that of\r\nhumidity. But from June to November the country is inundated, the roads\r\nare for the most part impassable, and travelling in the interior is\r\ndifficult and disagreeable. Even in the month of December, in several\r\ndistricts of Luzon, we found, as before mentioned, places in which\r\ncarriages are necessarily abandoned, the palanquin bearers being up\r\nto their thighs in mud; and other places in which we were compelled\r\nto open a new way through the woods. The heat is too oppressive to\r\nallow much active exertion in the middle of the day, and the siesta is\r\ngenerally resorted to from 1 to 3 o'clock P.M., before and after which\r\ntime visits are paid and business transacted. The pleasant evening\r\ntime is, however, that of social enjoyment, and the principal people\r\nhave their tertulias, to which guests are welcomed from half-past 8\r\no'clock to about 11 o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nThe variations of the thermometer rarely exceed 10° of Reaumur, the\r\nmaximum heat being from 28° to 29°, the minimum 18° to 19°. Winter\r\ngarments are scarcely ever required.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the longest and shortest day is 1h. 47m. 12s. On\r\nthe 20th June, in Manila, the sun rises at 5h. 33m. 12s., and sets\r\nat 6h. 26m. 48s.; on the 20th December, it rises at 6h. 26m. 48s.,\r\nand sets at 5h. 33m. 12s.\r\n\r\nThe minimum fall of rain in Manila is 84 inches, the maximum\r\n114. Hailstorms are rare. There is no mountain sufficiently high to be\r\n\"snow-capped;\" the highest, Banaho, is between 6,000 and 7,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nLike other tropical climates, the Philippines are visited by\r\nthe usual calamities gathered by the wild elements round that\r\nline which is deemed the girdle of the world. Violent hurricanes\r\nproduce fearful devastations; typhoons cover the coasts with wrecks;\r\ninundations of rivers and excessive rains destroy the earth's produce,\r\nwhile long-continued droughts are equally fatal to the labours and\r\nthe hopes of husbandry. Earthquakes shake the land, overturn the\r\nstrongest edifices and sport destructively with the power of man;\r\nvolcanic mountains inundate the earth with their torrents of burning\r\nlava. Clouds of locusts sometimes devour all that is green upon the\r\nsurface of the ground; and epidemic diseases carry away multitudes\r\nof the human race. The ravages caused by accidental fires are often\r\nmost calamitous, as the greater part of the houses are constructed of\r\ninflammable materials. When such a disaster occurs, it spreads with\r\nwonderful rapidity, and, there being no adequate means of extinction,\r\na whole population is often rendered houseless.\r\n\r\nDuring the change of the monsoons especially, the storms are often\r\nterrific, accompanied by very violent rains, fierce lightning and\r\nloud thunder. If in the night, the darkness thickens. Many lose their\r\nlives by lightning strokes, and houses are frequently carried away\r\nby the vehemence of the torrents.\r\n\r\nBagyo is the Indian name for hurricane. These violent outbreaks\r\nare generally announced in the morning by a light smoky mist which\r\nappears on the mountains; it gathers, and darkens, and thickens into\r\nheavy clouds, and before day closes breaks out with its fearful and\r\ndestroying violence, raging from an hour and a half to two hours. M. de\r\nGentil says that in the torrid zone the clouds which bring the most\r\ndestructive tornadoes are at an elevation not exceeding 400 toises\r\nof perpendicular height.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the volcanoes is that of Mayon in Luzon. It is in the\r\nshape of a sugar-loaf, perfectly conical. Its base covers several\r\nleagues in the provinces of Albay and Camarines, and it is one of\r\nthe most prominent objects and landmarks visible from the sea;\r\nthere is a constant smoke, sometimes accompanied by flames; its\r\nsubterranean sounds are often heard at a distance of many leagues. The\r\ncountry in the neighbourhood is covered with sand and stone, which on\r\ndifferent occasions have been vomited forth from the crater. There is\r\na description by the Alcalde of an eruption in 1767, which lasted ten\r\ndays, during which a cone of flame, whose base was about forty feet\r\nin diameter, ascended, and a river of lava was poured out for two\r\nmonths, 120 feet in breadth. Great ruin was caused to the adjacent\r\nvillages. The lava torrent was followed about a month afterwards by\r\nenormous outpourings of water, which either greatly widened the beds\r\nof the existing rivers, or formed new channels in their rush towards\r\nthe sea. The town of Malinao was wholly destroyed, and a third part\r\nof that of Casana. Many other villages suffered; forests were buried\r\nin sand; which also overwhelmed houses and human beings. The ravages\r\nextended over a space of six leagues.\r\n\r\nFrom an eruption at Buhayan, sixty leagues from Zamboanga, in the\r\nisland of Mindanao, in 1640, large masses of stone were flung to\r\na distance of two leagues. The ashes fell in the Moluccas and in\r\nBorneo. Dense darkness covered Zamboanga. Ships at sea lighted their\r\nlamps at 8 A.M., but the light could not be seen through the clouds\r\nof sand. The mountain whence the explosion originated disappeared,\r\nand a lake was formed and still remains in the locality as a record of\r\nthe agitation. The waters of the lake were long white with ashes. The\r\nnoise of the eruption was heard in Manila.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty leagues from Manila is the province of Batanga. In one\r\nof the bays is an island called by the natives Binintiang Malagui,\r\nremarkable for its beauty, for the variety of its vegetation, and\r\nthe number of animals which inhabit it. The eastern part of the\r\nisland is a mountain, whose extinct volcano is seen in the form of\r\na truncated cone of enormous extent, surrounded by desolation. The\r\nflanks of the mountain have been torn by vast channels, down which the\r\nlava-streams must have flowed. The sides are covered with ferruginous\r\nand sulphurous pyrites and scoriæ, which make the ascent difficult. It\r\nis most accessible on the southern side, by which we reach the mouth\r\nof the crater, whose circumference exceeds three miles, and whose\r\ndeep and wild recesses exhibit astounding evidences of the throes\r\nand agitations which in former times must have shaken and convulsed\r\nthis portion of the earth. A Spanish writer says it looked \"like an\r\nexecrable blasphemy launched by Satan against God.\" There are still\r\nsome signs of its past history in the smoke which rises from the abyss;\r\nbut what characterizes the spot is the contrast between the gigantic\r\nwrecks and ruins of nature on one side, and the extreme loveliness\r\nand rich variety of other parts of the landscape. Descending into\r\nthe crater by the help of cords round the body, a grand platform is\r\nreached at the depth of about 600 feet, in which are four smaller\r\ncraters, one constantly and the others occasionally emitting a white\r\nsmoke, but they cannot be approached on account of the softness and\r\nheat of the soil. To the east is a lake from which a stream runs\r\nround the craters over beds of sulphur, which assume the colour of\r\nemeralds. Formerly this lake was in a state of boiling ebullition,\r\nbut is now scarcely above the natural temperature; it blackens silver\r\nimmediately. Frequent earthquakes change the character of the crater\r\nand its neighbourhood, and every new detailed description differs from\r\nthat which preceded it. The Indians have magnificent notions of the\r\nmineral riches buried in the bosom of the mountain, the sulphur mines\r\nof which were advantageously worked a few years ago, when a well-known\r\nnaturalist (Lopez, now dead) offered to the Spanish government large\r\nsums for the monopoly of the right of mining the district of Taal.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, 1716, sounds like those of heavy\r\nartillery proceeded from the Taal volcano, and the mountain seemed\r\nto be in a state of ignition over a space of three leagues towards\r\nMacolot. Gigantic towers of boiling water and ashes were thrown up,\r\nthe earth shook on all sides, the waters of the lake were agitated\r\nand overran its banks: this lasted for three days. The water was\r\nblackened, and its sulphurous smell infested the whole district. In\r\n1754 a yet more violent eruption, lasting eight days, took place,\r\nwith terrible explosions, heavings of the earth, darkness, and such\r\nclouds of dust and ashes that all the roofs of the houses at Manila,\r\nat a distance of twenty leagues, were covered. Great masses of stones,\r\nfire and smoke were thrown from the mountain. The lake boiled in\r\nbubbles. Streams of bitumen and sulphur ran over the district of\r\nBong-bong. The alligators, sharks, tunnies, and all the large fish,\r\nwere destroyed in the river and flung upon the banks, impregnating\r\nthe air with stench. It is said that subterranean and atmospheric\r\nthunders were heard at a distance of 300 leagues from the volcano,\r\nand that the winds carried the ashes to incredible distances. In\r\nPanay there was midday darkness. Many pueblos were wholly destroyed;\r\namong them Sala, Janavan, Lipa, and Taal: others bearing the same\r\nnames have been since founded at a greater distance from the mountain.\r\n\r\nLopez gives a description of his descent into the crater. He employed\r\n100 men for eight days to make a slope for his going down. He says\r\nthe crater is oval, two miles in diameter; that the lake within the\r\ncrater is surrounded by level and solid ground; that there was a deep\r\nchasm which had been recently ignited: there was sulphur enough to load\r\nmany ships. He saw a cube of porphyry 20 to 25 feet square. The crater\r\nwall is perpendicular on all sides; that on the north 1,200 feet high,\r\nthe lowest exceeding 900 feet. He says he believes the south sides to\r\nbe of porphyry. At night, midway of the descent, he saw \"thousands of\r\nmillions\" of jets, whose gas immediately inflamed on coming in contact\r\nwith the atmosphere, and he heard many small detonations. The waters\r\nof the lake were impregnated with sulphuric acid, and 12 lbs. of the\r\nwater, when distilled, left a mineral residuum weighing 2 1/2 lbs.\r\n\r\nThere are many remarkable caves in the Philippines. I translate\r\na description of one in the province of Tondo. Two stony mountains\r\nunite, and on their skirt is the road towards a branch of the main\r\nriver. On the left is a cave whose entrance fronts the south. The\r\nmouth is almost covered with tangling vegetation, but it is arched,\r\nand, being all of marble, is, particularly in the sunshine, strikingly\r\nbeautiful. You enter by a high, smooth, natural wall like the façade\r\nof a church, over which is a cavity roofed as a chapel. The interior\r\npathway is flat, about four yards in breadth and six in height, though\r\nin some places it is much loftier. The roof presents a multitude of\r\ngraceful figures, resembling pendent pineapples, which are formed\r\nby the constant filtration and petrifaction of the water. Some\r\nare nearly two yards in length, and seem sculptured into regular\r\ngrooves; others are in the shape of pyramids whose bases are against\r\nthe roof. Arches, which may be passed both from above and below,\r\nare among these wonderful works. Not far from the door is a natural\r\nstaircase, mounting which you enter a large chamber, on whose right\r\nhand is another road, which, being followed, conducts to a second\r\nstaircase, which opens on the principal communication. Suspended\r\non one wing are immense numbers of bats, who occupy the recesses of\r\nthe ceiling. Though there is mud in some of the paths, the ground is\r\ngenerally of stone, which, on being struck, gives a hollow sound as if\r\nthere were passages below. Penetrating the cave for above 200 yards,\r\na loud noise is perceived coming from a clear bright river, by the\r\nside of which the cave is continued under a semicircular roof. The\r\ngreat cave has many smaller vaults and projections of a grotesque and\r\nGothic character. The course of the stream is from the north-west to\r\nthe south-east.\r\n\r\nThe destructive ravages and changes produced by earthquakes are\r\nnowhere more remarkable than in the Philippines. They have overturned\r\nmountains, they have filled up valleys, they have desolated extensive\r\nplains; they have opened passages for the sea into the interior,\r\nand from the lakes into the sea There are many traditional stories\r\nof these territorial revolutions, but of late disasters the records\r\nare trustworthy. That of 1796 was sadly calamitous. In 1824 many\r\nchurches in Manila were destroyed, together with the principal bridge,\r\nthe barracks, great numbers of private houses; and a chasm opened of\r\nnearly four miles in length. The inhabitants all fled into the fields,\r\nand the six vessels in the port were wrecked. The number of victims was\r\nnever ascertained. In 1828, during another earthquake, the vibration of\r\nthe lamps was found to describe an arch of four and a half feet; the\r\nhuge corner-stones of the principal gate of the city were displaced;\r\nthe great bells were set ringing. It lasted between two and three\r\nminutes, rent the walls of several churches and other buildings,\r\nbut was not accompanied by subterranean noises, as is usually the case.\r\n\r\nThere are too few occasions on which scientific observations have been\r\nmade on the subject of earthquakes, which take men by surprise and\r\nordinarily create so much alarm as to prevent accurate and authentic\r\ndetails. A gentleman who had established various pendulums in Manila\r\nfor the purpose of measuring the inclination of the angles and the\r\ncourse of the agitation, states that, in the slight earthquakes\r\nof 20th and 23rd June, 1857, the thermometer being at 88°, the\r\ndirection of the first shock was from N.N.E. to S.S.E., the duration\r\n14 seconds, and the oscillation of the pendulum 1 1/2 degrees; time,\r\n2h. 0m. 40s. P.M.: 20th June. Second shock from N.E. to S.W.; duration,\r\n26 seconds; oscillation of pendulum, 2 degrees; time, 2h. 47m. P.M.:\r\n20th June. Third shock S.W. to N.; duration of the shock, 15 seconds;\r\ngreatest oscillation, 6 degrees, but slight movements continued\r\nfor a minute, and the oscillations were observed from 2 degrees to\r\nthree-quarters of a degree; time, 5 P.M.: 23rd June.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes have produced great changes in the geography of the\r\nPhilippines. In that of 1627, one of the most elevated of the mountains\r\nof Cagayan disappeared. In 1675, in the island of Mindanao, a passage\r\nwas opened to the sea, and a vast plain was emerged. Successive\r\nearthquakes have brought upon Luzon a series of calamities.\r\n\r\nEndemic diseases are rare in the Philippines. Intermittent fevers\r\nand chronic dysentery are among the most dangerous disorders. There\r\nhave been two invasions of cholera, in 1820 and 1842. Elephantiasis,\r\nleprosy, and St. Anthony's fire are the scourges of the Indians; and\r\nthe wilder races of the interior suffer from a variety of cutaneous\r\ncomplaints. The biri biri is common and fatal. Venereal diseases are\r\nwidely spread, but easily cured. Among the Indians, vegetables alone\r\nare used as medicaments. Chinese quack-doctors have much influence. In\r\nthe removal of some of the tropical pests, no European can compete\r\nwith the natives. They cure the itch with great dexterity, and are\r\nsaid to have remedies for pulmonary phthisis. Their plasters are very\r\nefficacious in external applications. They never employ the lancet\r\nor the leech. Surgical science is, of course, unknown.\r\n\r\nThere have been generally in the Philippines a few successful medical\r\npractitioners from Europe. Foreigners are allowed to exercise their\r\nprofession, having previously obtained the authority of the Spanish\r\nGovernment; but the natives seldom look beyond their own simple mode\r\nof dealing with the common diseases of the islands; and in those\r\nparts where there is little or no Spanish population, no one is to\r\nbe found to whom a surgical operation could safely be intrusted. The\r\nvegetable world furnishes a great variety of medicinal herbs, which\r\nthe instinct or the experience of the Indian has turned to account,\r\nand which are, probably, on the whole, as efficacious as the more\r\npotent mineral remedies employed by European science. Quinine, opium,\r\nmercury, and arsenic, are the wonder-workers in the field of Oriental\r\ndisease, and their early and proper application generally arrests\r\nthe progress of malady.\r\n\r\nI found practising in the island of Panay Dr. Lefevre, whom I had\r\nknown in Egypt more than twenty years before, and who was one of the\r\ncourageous men who boldly grappled with the current superstitions\r\nrespecting the contagious character of the Oriental plague, and the\r\ndelusions as to the efficacy of quarantine regulations, so really\r\nuseless, costly, and vexatious. He placed in my hand some observations\r\nwhich he had published at Bombay in 1840, where vessels from the Red\r\nSea were subjected to sanatory visitations. He asserts that plague is\r\nonly generated at particular seasons, in certain definable conditions\r\nof the atmosphere, and when miasma is created by the decomposition of\r\ndecaying matter; that endemic plague is unknown in countries where\r\nproper attention is paid to hygienic precautions; that severe cold\r\nor intense heat equally arrests the progress of the plague; that the\r\nepoch of its ravages is always one when damp and exposed animal and\r\nvegetable substances emit the greatest amount of noxious gases; and\r\nthat plague has never been known to originate or to spread where the\r\nair is in a state of purity. I was glad to rediscuss the matter with\r\nhim after so long an added experience, and to find he had been more\r\nand more confirmed in his former conclusions by prolonged residence\r\nin the tropics, where endemic and epidemic diseases partake of the\r\npestilential character, though they do not assume the forms, of the\r\nLevant plague. Dr. Lefevre affirms that quarantines have done nothing\r\nwhatever to lessen the dangers or check the ravages of the plague,\r\nbut much to encourage its propagation. He complains of the deafness and\r\nincredulity of those whom the examination of a \"thousand indisputable\r\nfacts\" will not convince, and he thus concludes:--\"If I had not with\r\npeculiar attention studied the plague in the midst of an epidemic,\r\nand without any more precautions than if the danger was nothing--if,\r\nsubsequent to the terrible visitation of 1835 in Egypt, I had not\r\nbeen frequently a witness to the scourge--if, finally, since that\r\nepoch I had not given myself up, with all the warmth of passion,\r\nto the constant study of this malady, to the perusal of histories\r\nof the plagues which have ravaged the world, and to the examination\r\nof all sorts of objections--I should not have dared to emit such a\r\ndecided opinion--an opinion respecting the soundness of which I do\r\nnot entertain the slightest doubt.\"\r\n\r\nOne cannot but be struck, in reference to the geographical character\r\nof these islands, with the awful serenity and magnificent beauty of\r\ntheir primeval forests, so seldom penetrated, and in their recesses\r\nhitherto inaccessible to the foot of man. There is nothing to disturb\r\ntheir silence but the hum of insects, the song of birds, the noises\r\nof wild animals, the rustling of the leaves, or the fall of decayed\r\nbranches. It seems as if vegetation revelled in undisturbed and\r\nuncontrolled luxuriance. Creeping plants wander from tree to tree;\r\nlovely orchids hang themselves from trunks and boughs. One asks, why\r\nis so much sweetness, so much glory, wasted? But is it wasted? To the\r\nCreator the contemplation of his works, even where unmarked by human\r\neye, must be complacent; and these half-concealed, half-developed\r\ntreasures, are but reserved storehouses for man to explore; they will\r\nfurnish supplies to awaken the curiosity and gratify the inquiry\r\nof successive ages. Rove where he may--explore as he will--tax his\r\nintellect with research, his imagination with inventions--there is,\r\nthere will be, an infinite field around and above him, inexhaustible\r\nthrough countless generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT--ADMINISTRATION, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Administration of the Philippine Archipelago has for its head\r\nand chief a captain and governor-general, who resides in Manila, the\r\ncapital of the islands, and who is not permitted to quit them without\r\nthe authority of the sovereign of Spain. Next to the government of\r\nCuba, it is the most important and the most lucrative post at the\r\ndisposal of the Cabinet of Madrid, and has unfortunately been generally\r\none of the prizes wrested from the unsuccessful, and seized by the\r\npredominant, political party. It was rather a melancholy employment\r\nfor me to look over the collection of portraits of captains-general,\r\nand many vacant frames waiting for future occupants, which ornament the\r\nwalls of the handsome apartments in which I dwelt at the palace. Since\r\n1835 there have been five provisional and eleven formal appointments to\r\nthe governor-generalship. Some of these only held their authority for\r\na few months, being superseded by ministerial changes at Madrid. Of\r\nother high functionaries, I observe that there have been only two\r\narchbishops since 1830, while it is understood that the service of\r\nheads of departments is assured for ten years. To the public interests\r\nthe mischiefs which are the results of so uncertain a hold of the\r\nsupreme authority are incalculable. The frequent and sudden removals\r\nand nominations are, indeed, little consistent with the principles\r\nof monarchical and hereditary government, however accordant with the\r\nrepublican institutions of the Western world; and among the causes\r\nof the slow development of the immense resources of these beautiful\r\nislands, the fluctuation of the superintending rule is assuredly one\r\nof the most prominent.\r\n\r\nThe titles of the captain-general occupy a page, and embrace the\r\nusual attributes of government, with the exception of authority over\r\nthe fleet, which is subject to the Ministry of Marine in Spain, and\r\na somewhat limited jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters, which is a\r\nconsequence of the exclusive establishment of the Roman Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-governor, who takes the place of the captain-general\r\nin case of his death, is called the Segundo Cabo, or second head.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands are divided into provinces, subject either to\r\npolitico-military governors or alcaldes mayores, who are generally\r\ncivilians.\r\n\r\nWhen the government is military, an assistant lieutenant-governor, who\r\nmust have graduated as a lawyer, exercises the preliminary jurisdiction\r\n(de primera instancia), but the alcaldes hold that jurisdiction in\r\ntheir own persons. Both dispose in their provinces of the military\r\nauthority, and have the controlling direction of the collection\r\nof the revenues, under responsibility to the General Administrator\r\nof Tributes.\r\n\r\nThe provinces are divided into pueblos (towns or villages), over\r\neach of which a native Indian or mestizo, called a gobernadorcillo\r\n(diminutive of governor) is placed. He is assisted in the discharge\r\nof his functions by native lieutenants and alguacils, whose number\r\ndepends upon the extent of the population. This body, which, when\r\ngathered together, is called the principalia of the pueblo, settles\r\nall minor matters of police and civil questions between the natives\r\nas to rights of persons and property. In districts where the Chinese\r\nor their descendants are sufficiently numerous (they are known by the\r\nname of Sangleyes), they are allowed, under special authority of the\r\ngovernment, to select principalia from their own body, independently\r\nof Indian jurisdiction. These principalia are really popularly chosen\r\nmunicipalities, and they are specially charged to assist the clergy\r\nin all matters connected with public worship and ecclesiastical\r\nauthority. They determine questions up to the amount of two taels of\r\ngold, or forty-four silver dollars. They collect evidence in criminal\r\ncases, which is submitted to the provincial chief; they assist in\r\nthe collection of the royal revenues, circulate the ordinances of\r\nthe government among the people, and are authorized to levy a small\r\nbut defined contribution in support of their dignity.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are in every pueblo certain functionaries who are\r\ncalled Cabezas (heads) de Barangay. A barangay is a collection of the\r\nchiefs of families, or persons paying tribute, generally amounting\r\nto forty or fifty. They are under the special charge of the cabeza,\r\nwho must dwell among them, and, under bond, collect the tribute\r\ndue to the State. He is required to settle misunderstandings and to\r\nmaintain peace and order, to apportion the various charges among the\r\nmembers of the barangay, and to collect the taxes for payment to the\r\ngobernadorcillo, or to the functionary appointed for the purpose. The\r\ncabezas are also considered the procuradores, or law advisers, of\r\nthese little communities.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times there is little doubt that the office was\r\nhereditary; and there are yet localities where the hereditary right is\r\nmaintained; but it is generally elective: and when a vacancy occurs,\r\nthe gobernadorcillo in council, with the other cabezas, presents a\r\nname for the approval of the superior authority, and the same steps\r\nare taken when the increase of population requires a new cabeza to be\r\nnominated. The cabezas, their wives and first-born, who are required to\r\nassist in the collection of the tribute, are exempted from its payment.\r\n\r\nIn some provinces the cabezas are only chosen for three years;\r\nafter which they form part of the principalia, and take the title\r\nof Don. I remember, in one locality, that the principalia who came\r\nto pay their respects consisted of more than seventy persons. The\r\ngovernment complains of the number who, under this state of things,\r\nare exempted from taxation, and I understand some measures are in\r\ncontemplation for limiting the extent of the privileges.\r\n\r\nThe elections of the gobernadorcillo are annual, and take place on\r\nthe 1st of April. An extraordinary excitement generally prevails,\r\nthe post (a really important, popular, and influential one) being\r\nan object of much ambition. Three names are selected, one of whom\r\nmust have already served as gobernadorcillo, for submission to the\r\nsuperior authority, on or before the 15th of May, and the chosen\r\ngobernadorcillo enters on his functions on the 1st of June. There is,\r\nhowever, some alteration of dates, where, as in the tobacco districts,\r\nthe period of election interferes with harvest time.\r\n\r\nThe head of the province ordinarily presides over the elections, to\r\nwhich the principal ecclesiastic is also invited. In case of their\r\nabsence, any native-born Spaniard may be nominated by the principal\r\nauthority to preside.\r\n\r\nThere are thirteen electors for each pueblo--the gobernadorcillo and\r\ntwelve inhabitants--half of whom must have been gobernadorcillos\r\nor cabezas, and the other half be in the actual exercise of those\r\nfunctions; they must also have some well-recognized means of existence:\r\ndomestic servants to the authorities are excluded; as also those who\r\nhave been punished as criminals.\r\n\r\nIt is further required that the gobernadorcillo be a native\r\nIndian or mestizo, an inhabitant of the locality where he serves,\r\nand above twenty-five years old; having passed the subordinate\r\noffices of lieutenant or cabeza, having his accounts in order,\r\nholding no land from the community, and no monopoly (estanco)\r\nfrom the government. Similar recommendations are insisted on\r\nfor the first lieutenant and the principal (native) magistrates\r\nappointed for the settlement of questions regarding seed-sowing,\r\npolice, and cattle. These magistrates must have enjoyed the rank\r\nof gobernadorcillo. As regards the minor officers of justice and\r\ntheir attendants, a list is to be made out by the gobernadorcillo\r\nbefore quitting office, which is to be presented to the authority\r\npresiding over the elections, and having heard the clergyman (cura)\r\nand the committee of election, the president approves the list for\r\ntransmission to the supreme authority; but if he finds discordance\r\nand irreconcilable opinions between the parties before him, he is\r\nauthorized himself to recommend the officers for nomination.\r\n\r\nAll the proceedings are the subjects of record, and to be signed by\r\nthe president, the curate (if present), the electors, and the public\r\nnotary, and to be remitted to the supreme authority, except in the\r\nprovinces adjacent to the capital. The president may attach to the\r\nrecord any observations of his own connected with the returns. A\r\ndecree of 1850 required the general adoption of the system which has\r\nbeen described, and which appears to me well worthy of note, showing\r\nhow many valuable elements of good government are to be found in the\r\npopular institutions of the Philippine Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese of the capital may elect Christian converts of their\r\nown body, under the presidency of the alcalde mayor of Manila,\r\nto the offices of gobernadorcillo, first lieutenant, and principal\r\nalguacil (bailiff). The dependent subordinate officers of justice\r\nare called bilangos, and are appointed by the gobernadorcillo on his\r\nelection. The recovery of the tribute or taxes from the Chinese is\r\nnot left to their principalia, but is effected by the alcalde mayor\r\nor superior chief. An officer is appointed to classify the Chinese,\r\nand apportion the quota of their contributions according to the wealth\r\nof the payer, who is charged for what is called a patente industrial.\r\n\r\nThe gobernadorcillos and officers of justice are entitled to sit\r\nin the presence of the provincial chiefs, who are to require the\r\nparochial clergy to treat them with due honour and regard.\r\n\r\nM. Mallat, whose Geographical History of the Philippines was published\r\nin 1846, remarks that, of all colonies founded by Europeans, these\r\nregions are perhaps the least known, and the most worthy of being\r\nknown. The number of islands which compose the archipelago,--their\r\nvast extent and boundless variety,--the teeming population of many of\r\nthem,--the character of the climate,--the wonderful fertility of the\r\nsoil,--the inexhaustible riches of hill, valley, and plain,--all offer\r\nto cultivation and its civilizing influences abundant rewards. But as\r\nregards the \"industrious habits\" of the natives, I cannot place that\r\nconsideration, as M. Mallat does, among the elements of hope. It is\r\nthe want of these \"industrious habits,\" among four or five millions\r\nof inhabitants, which has left the Philippines in a position so\r\nlittle advanced.\r\n\r\nJava under the government of the Dutch, and Cuba subjected to the\r\nSpanish rule, present, no doubt, far more favourable pictures than\r\ndo the Philippines; but many of the difficulties which surround the\r\ncaptain-general of Manila,--difficulties both religious and social,--do\r\nnot embarrass the governor of Batavia; the island of Java, the most\r\nproductive of Netherlands India, being peculiarly free from these\r\ndifficulties; and it cannot be said that Sumatra and Borneo are even\r\non a level with the more advanced of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nTo the character of the original conquest and of the earlier government\r\nof the Philippines may be traced many of the impediments which now\r\nstand in the way of improvement. In America and the West Indies all\r\nthe brutality of military conquerors was exhibited, and the possession\r\nand plunder of new territories were encouraged by the Spanish court,\r\nand were the main object of the Spanish invader. But far different\r\nwas the policy adopted in the Philippines, where only a small body of\r\nsoldiers was accompanied by zealous missionaries, whose purpose was\r\nrather to convert and christianize the Indians than to pillage and\r\ndestroy them. These friars gradually obtained a paramount influence\r\nover the Indians. The interests of trade have ever been the predominant\r\nconsideration among Dutch colonizers, and among British adventurers\r\nthe commercial element has always been intimately associated with\r\nthe desire for territorial occupation. To the Spaniards it must be\r\nconceded that the religious purpose--be its value what it may--has\r\nnever been abandoned or forgotten. Ecclesiastical jurisdiction and\r\nauthority are interwoven in the Philippines with the machinery of\r\ngovernment and the daily concerns of life.\r\n\r\nAnd such ecclesiastical action has been comparatively little interfered\r\nwith in the Philippines. The development which mental emancipation\r\nhas given to many Protestant countries and their dependencies has\r\nreached few Catholic colonies; nor is that emancipation, indeed,\r\nconsistent with the more rigid discipline and doctrines of Rome. But\r\nin the case of the most prosperous instances of colonization by the\r\nBritish, the native races have either wholly disappeared or are in\r\nprogress of extinction, while the infusion of Spanish and foreign\r\nblood into the colonies of Spain has not only allowed the increase\r\nof the indigenous population, but has been insufficient to change\r\nor do more than slightly modify their national characters. It has\r\nundoubtedly been the boast of the Catholics that Francis de Xavier\r\nand his followers won more for the Roman Church in the East than\r\nLuther or Calvin ever tore away from it in the West; but the value\r\nof the conquests, contrasted with that of the losses and sacrifices,\r\nif fairly estimated, would hardly be deemed unsatisfactory to the\r\nProtestant cause.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the great remoteness of the Philippines from Europe, the\r\ndifficulties and infrequency of communication, gave to the local\r\nauthorities more of independent action than would otherwise have\r\nbeen allowed to them; and in case of the death of the governor,\r\nthe archbishop was generally the functionary who filled his place;\r\nhis adjacency to the government, and frequent direction of it,\r\nnaturally led to the strengthening of his own authority and that of\r\nall ecclesiastics dependent upon him.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods of Eastern colonization, too, the Portuguese,\r\njealous of all European intercourse but their own with nations east\r\nof the Cape, did all in their power to prevent any other than the\r\nLusitanian flag from being seen in Oriental waters. But as regards\r\nmissionary objects their views were to some extent concurrent with\r\nthose of the Spanish priests, and their proceedings were in harmony\r\nwith those of the Spaniards, especially in so far as both received\r\ntheir direction from the Pontiff at Rome. It ought not, however, to be\r\nforgotten that whatever may have been the progress of Christianity in\r\nthe Philippines, the persecutions, disasters, discomfiture, and death\r\nof so many professing Christians in Japan, are probably attributable\r\nto the ill-guided zeal of the Portuguese preachers of the Gospel in\r\nthese still remoter regions. It is well for the interests of truth, as\r\nmost assuredly it is for the interests of commerce and civilization,\r\nthat a more temperate and tolerant spirit has for the last century\r\nbeen associated with the progress of European influence in the East.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively small number of Spanish settlers in the Philippines\r\nwould not allow them, even if such had been their purpose, which\r\nit does not appear to have been, unnecessarily to interfere with\r\nthe usages of the Indians, or their forms of administration and\r\ngovernment, except in so far as their conversion to Christianity\r\ncompelled the observance of the Christian rites; and the friars\r\nwillingly accommodated their action to the social habits of the people,\r\nrespecting, as to this hour are respected, most of the patriarchal\r\nforms of administration and government which had existed among them\r\nfrom immemorial time.\r\n\r\nThere have been speculations--and M. Mallat is among the sanguine\r\nanticipators of such an advent--that in process of time the Philippines\r\nmay become the dominant political power of the Eastern world,\r\nsubjecting to its paramount influence the Netherlands Archipelago,\r\nthe Pacific, Australia, and even China and Japan, and that Manila is\r\ndestined to be the great emporium for the eastern and south-eastern\r\nworld. M. Mallat even goes further, and says: \"Manila might easily\r\nbecome the centre of the exports and imports of the entire globe.\" It\r\nmust be contented with a less brilliant futurity. Certainly its\r\ncommercial relations might be greatly extended, and the Spanish\r\narchipelago be much elevated in value and in influence; but in the\r\nvast development of commercial relations in the Oriental world, the\r\nPhilippines must be contented with a moderate though a considerable\r\nshare of benefit, even under the best administration and the adoption\r\nof the wisest policy.\r\n\r\nTropical regions fail to attract permanent settlers from the West. The\r\nforeign merchant comes to realize what he deems an adequate fortune,\r\nand to withdraw; the superior public functionary is among, or above,\r\nbut never of, the people. What must be looked to is the popular\r\nelement. Of what are the millions composed, and how can the millions\r\nbe turned to account? There is no reason to apprehend that these\r\nmillions will aspire to political power or sovereignty. Their pristine\r\nhabits would permit of no general organization. The various races and\r\nclans would never unite in a national object, or recognize one native\r\nchief. All that is found of order and government among them is local;\r\nexcept through and for their masters, the different islands have little\r\nor no intercourse with one another. The Tagál and the Bisayan have\r\nno common sympathies. Dissatisfaction might produce disorder, which,\r\nif not controlled, would lead to anarchy, but not to good government.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines are free from the curse of slavery. Time will settle\r\nthe controversy as to whether the labour of the freeman can, in\r\nthe long run, be brought into competition with that of the slave,\r\nespecially in the tropics; but that the great tide of tendency\r\nflows towards the abolition of slavery, that civilizing opinion\r\nand enlightened Christian legislation must sweep the ignominy away,\r\nis a conviction which possesses the minds of all who see \"progress\"\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nAs it is, the Philippines have made, and continue to make, large\r\ncontributions to the mother country, generally in excess of the\r\nstipulated amount which is called the situado. Spain, in her extreme\r\nembarrassment, has frequently called on the Philippines to come to\r\nher aid, and it is to the credit of the successive governors-general\r\nthat, whatever may have been the financial disorders at home,\r\nthe dependants upon the Manila treasury have had little motive for\r\ncomplaint, and while the Peninsula was engaged in perilous struggles\r\nfor her independence, and even her existence as a nation, the public\r\ntranquillity of her island colonies was, on the whole, satisfactorily\r\nmaintained, and interruptions to the ordinary march of affairs of\r\nshort endurance.\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be no legislation defining the powers of the\r\nviceroy, or captain-general; but whenever any important matter is\r\nunder discussion, it is found that reference must be made to Madrid,\r\nand that the supreme rule of this vast archipelago is in the leading\r\nstrings of the Spanish Cabinet, impotent to correct any great abuses,\r\nor to introduce any important reforms. The captain-general should\r\nbe invested with a large amount of power, subject, of course, to a\r\npersonal responsibility as to its becoming exercise. As he must, if\r\nproperly selected, know more, being present, than strangers who are\r\nabsent, his government should be trusted on account of that superior\r\nknowledge. Well does the Castilian proverb say, \"Mas sabe el loco en\r\nsu casa que el cuerdo en la agena\"--\"The fool knows more about his\r\nown house than the sage about the house of another.\" He should be\r\nliberally paid, that the motives for corruption be diminished. He\r\nshould be surrounded by a council composed of the best qualified\r\nadvisers. Many objects would necessarily occupy the attention of\r\nsuch a body, and it would naturally have to create becoming local\r\nmachinery and to furnish the materials for improved administration,\r\nsuch as surveys and statistics of the land and population, which would\r\nlead to a more satisfactory distribution of provinces, districts and\r\npueblos. A simple code of civil and criminal law would be a great\r\nblessing, and should be grounded, in so far as the real interests of\r\njustice will allow, upon the customs and habits of the people, while\r\nemploying, when compatible with those interests, the administrative\r\nlocal machinery in use among the natives.\r\n\r\nNothing would be more beneficial to the interests of Manila than\r\nthe establishment of an efficient board of works, with provincial\r\nramifications, to whose attention the facilitating communications\r\nshould be specially recommended. The cost and difficulty of transport\r\nare among the principal impediments to the development of the resources\r\nof the islands, and the tardy progress of the few works which are\r\nundertaken is discouraging to those who suggest, and disappointing\r\nto those who expect to benefit by them. In many of the provinces\r\nthe bridges are in miserable condition, and the roads frequently\r\nimpassable. Even in the populous island of Panay delays the most\r\ncostly and annoying interfere with the transport of produce to the\r\ncapital and naturally impede the development of commerce. There\r\nis, no doubt, a great want of directing talent and of that special\r\nknowledge which modern science is able to furnish. The construction\r\nof bridges being generally left to the rude artists who are employed\r\nby the Spanish functionaries, or to the direction of the friars, with\r\nwhom the stare super antiquas vias is the generally received maxim,\r\nit is not wonderful that there should be so many examples of rude,\r\nunsafe and unsightly constructions. Moreover, estimates have to be\r\nsent to the capital of all the proposed outlay, and it is hardly to\r\nbe expected but that sad evidence should be found--as elsewhere--of\r\nshort-sighted and very costly economy. The expense, too, almost\r\ninvariably exceeds the estimates--a pretty general scandal; then the\r\nwork is arrested, and sometimes wholly abandoned. Funds there are none,\r\nand neither policy nor patriotism will provide them. Even when strongly\r\nimpelled, the Indian moves slowly; self-action for the promotion of\r\nthe public good he has none. There is no pressure from without to\r\nforce improvements upon the authorities, and hence little is to be\r\nhoped for as to improvement except from direct administrative action.\r\n\r\nI can hardly pass over unnoticed M. de la Gironière's romantic\r\nbook, [9] as it was the subject of frequent conversations in the\r\nPhilippines. No doubt he has dwelt there twenty years; but in the\r\nexperience of those who have lived there more than twice twenty I\r\nfound little confirmation of the strange stories which are crowded\r\ninto his strange volume. He was a resident of the Philippines at the\r\ntime of my visit, and I believe still lives on the property of which\r\nhe was formerly--but I was told is no longer--the possessor. [10]\r\nI did not visit his \"Paradise,\" but had some agreeable intercourse\r\nwith a French gentleman who is now in charge. I did not find any of\r\nthat extraordinary savagery with which M. de la Gironière represents\r\nhimself to be surrounded; and the answer to the inquiries I made of\r\nthe neighbouring authorities as to the correctness of his pictures\r\nof Indian character was generally a shrug and a smile and a reference\r\nto my own experience. But M. de la Gironière may have aspired to the\r\nhonour of a Bernardin de St. Pierre or a Defoe, and have thought a\r\nfew fanciful and tragic decorations would add to the interest of his\r\npersonal drama. \"All the world's a stage,\" and as a player thereon\r\nM. de la Gironière perhaps felt himself authorized in the indulgence\r\nof some latitude of description, especially when his chosen \"stage\"\r\nwas one meant to exhibit the wonders of travel.\r\n\r\nAs to M. de la Gironière's marvellous encounters and miraculous escapes\r\nfrom man and beast; his presence at feasts where among the delicacies\r\nwere human brains, steeped by young girls in the juice of sugar-cane,\r\nof which he did not drink, but his servant did; his discoveries\r\nof native hands in \"savory\" pots prepared for food; his narratives\r\nwhere the rude Indians tell elaborate tales in the lackadaisy style\r\nof a fantastic novel; his vast possessions; his incredible influence\r\nover ferocious bandits and cruel savages;--all this must be taken\r\nat its value. I confess I have seen with some surprise, in M. de\r\nla Gironière's book, two \"testimonies\" from M. Dumont d'Urville\r\nand Admiral La Place, in which, among other matters, they give\r\nan account of the hatching of eggs by men specially engaged for\r\nthis purpose. [11] They saw, as any one may, in the villages on the\r\nPasig River, prodigious quantities of ducks and ducklings, and were\r\n\"puzzled\" to find how such multitudes could be produced; but they\r\nlearnt the wonderful feat was accomplished by \"lazy Tagál Indians,\"\r\nwho lay themselves down upon the eggs, which are placed in ashes. The\r\npatient incubators eat, drink, smoke, and chew their betel, and while\r\nthey take care not to injure the fragile shells, they carefully remove\r\nthe ducklings as they are brought into being (pp. 358 and 362). Now it\r\nmay well be asked who takes care when the lazy Tagáls are asleep; and,\r\nif our worthy witnesses had reflected for a moment, they would have\r\nknown that, if all the inhabitants were employed in no other office\r\nthan that of egg-hatching, they would be hardly sufficient to incubate\r\nthe \"prodigious\" numbers of ducklings which disport on the banks of\r\nthe Pasig. The incubation is really produced by placing warm paddy\r\nhusks under and over the eggs; they are deposited in frames; a canvas\r\ncovering is spread over the husks; the art is to keep up the needful\r\ntemperature; and one man is sufficient to the care of a large number\r\nof frames, from which he releases the ducklings as they are hatched,\r\nand conveys them in little flocks to the water-side. The communities\r\nare separated from one another by bamboo fences, but there is scarcely\r\na cottage with a river frontage which has not its patero (or duckery).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last generation a wonderful sensation was produced by the\r\npropagation of the great Malthusian discovery--the irresistible,\r\nindisputable, inexorable truth--that the productive powers of the soil\r\nwere less and less able to compete with the consuming demands of the\r\nhuman race; that while population was increasing with the rapidity of\r\na swift geometrical progression, the means of providing food lagged\r\nwith the feebleness of a slow arithmetical advance more and more\r\nbehind; that the seats at nature's table--rich and abundant though\r\nit was--were being abundantly filled, and that there was no room\r\nfor superfluous and uninvited guests; in a word, to use the adopted\r\nformula, that population was pressing more and more upon subsistence,\r\nand that the results must be increasing want, augmenting misery,\r\nand a train of calamities boundless as the catalogue of the infinite\r\nforms of mortal wretchedness.\r\n\r\nHow often, when threading through the thousand islands of the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago, did the shadow of Malthus and the visions of\r\nhis philosophy present themselves to my thoughts. Of those unnumbered,\r\nsea-surrounded regions, how many there are that have never been trodden\r\nby European foot, how few that have been thoroughly explored, and fewer\r\nstill that are now inhabited by any civilized or foreign race! And\r\nyet they are covered with beautiful and spontaneous vegetable riches\r\nabove, and bear countless treasures of mineral wealth below; their\r\npowers of production are boundless; they have the varieties of climate\r\nwhich mountains, valleys and plains afford--rains to water--suns to\r\nripen--rivers to conduct--harbours for shipment--every recommendation\r\nto attract adventure and to reward industry; a population of only\r\nfive or six millions, when ten times that number might be supplied\r\nto satiety, and enabled to provide for millions upon millions more\r\nout of the superfluities of their means.\r\n\r\nTo what a narrow field of observation must the mind have been confined\r\nthat felt alarm at a discovery, in itself of so little importance,\r\nwhen brought into the vast sphere of the world's geography! Though\r\nthe human race has been increasing at a rapid and almost immeasurable\r\nrate, it will be probably found that famines, and plagues, and wars,\r\nand those calamitous visitations which were deemed the redressers\r\nof the balance--the restorers of the due proportions between man's\r\nwants and man's supplies--were far more disastrous in ancient than\r\nin modern times, if the smaller number of then existing human beings\r\nbe taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe nobler and higher axiom is that \"progress\" is the law of\r\nProvidence, which never fails, while the race of man proceeds in\r\never-augmenting numbers, to provide ample means for their maintenance\r\nand happiness. Neither land nor sea is exhausted nor in process\r\nof exhaustion. What myriads of acres, whether in cold, temperate,\r\nor tropical climes, remain to be appropriated! what still greater\r\namount to be improved by cultivation! And while in the more densely\r\npeopled parts of the world outlets may be required for those who are\r\nill at ease and born to no inheritance but labour, how wonderfully\r\nare locomotive facilities increased, so that the embarrassment to\r\nambulatory man is less to discover a fit place for his domicile, than\r\nto select one amid the many which offer themselves to his choice! If\r\nthe poverty-struck Irish could emigrate in such multitudes to American\r\nor Australian regions, far greater are the facilities possessed by\r\nthose better conditioned labouring masses of Europe who are still\r\nheavily pressed by the competition of neighbours more fortunate\r\nthan themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of surprise that the Spanish colonies should not have\r\nattracted a greater number of Spaniards to settle in them; but the\r\nnational spirit of the Iberian peninsula has ceased to be ambulatory\r\nor adventurous. Spain itself is thinly peopled, and offers great\r\nresources to its satisfied peasantry. \"God,\" they say, \"has given\r\neverything to Spain which He had to give. Our land is an Eden--why\r\nshould we desert it?\" Yet Spain, backward, inert and unenergetic,\r\nas she has proved herself to be in the rivalry of active nations,\r\nhas taken her part in the proud history of human advancement. The more\r\nenterprising invaders of Gothic or Anglo-Saxon blood have frequently\r\nextirpated the indigenous races of the remote countries in which they\r\nhave settled. One wave of emigration has followed another; commerce\r\nand cultivation have created a demand for, and provided a supply of,\r\nthe intrusive visitors. But Spain has never furnished such numbers\r\nas to dislodge the aboriginal tribes. Her colonists have been always\r\naccompanied by large bodies of ecclesiastics, bent upon bringing \"the\r\nheathen\" into the Christian fold. These missionaries have no doubt\r\noften stood between the cupidity of the conqueror and the weakness of\r\nthe conquered. They have preserved, by protecting the Indian clans,\r\nand it may be doubted whether ultimately the permanent interests\r\nof man will not have been served by influences, whose beneficial\r\nconsequences may remain when the most prominent evils connected with\r\nthose influences may be greatly modified or wholly pass away.\r\n\r\nMy observations and my reflections, then, lead to this\r\nconclusion--that, whatever exceptional cases there may be, the great\r\ntide of advancement rolls forward in ever-growing strength;--that\r\nthe course of the Divine government is\r\n\r\n\r\n        From seeming evil still educing good,\r\n        And BETTER thence again, and BETTER still,\r\n        In infinite progression;--\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the human family, taken as a whole, is constantly improving;--that\r\nevery generation is wiser and better than that which preceded it;--that\r\nthe savage and least improvable races will continue to be supplanted or\r\nabsorbed by those of a higher intelligence;--that the semi-civilized\r\nwill only be perpetuated by contact with a greater civilization,\r\nwhich will raise them in the scale of humanity. A middle race,\r\nsuch as China contributes in the shape of emigrating millions,\r\nis wonderfully advancing the work of civilization. The process\r\nis everywhere visible in the remoter Eastern world. The mestizo\r\ndescendants of Chinese fathers and Indian mothers form incomparably\r\nthe most promising portion of the Philippine population. In Siam,\r\nBurmah, Cochin China, profitable employments are mainly absorbed by\r\nChinese settlers. In Netherlands India they are almost invariably\r\nprosperous. To them Sumatra, Borneo, and the other islands, must look,\r\nand not to the indigenous peoples, for any considerable development\r\nof their resources. In our Straits Archipelago they have superseded\r\nthe Klings in all the most beneficial fields of labour, as the Klings\r\nhad previously superseded the less industrious Malays. The progress\r\nof the higher capabilities, and the depression of the lower, may be\r\ntraced in the extinction of so many rude languages and the spread of\r\nthose which represent civilization in its most advanced stages. It may\r\nbe foretold, I think, without presumption, that in some future time\r\nthe number of tongues spoken on the face of the globe will be reduced\r\nto a very small amount. In the course of a century many a local idiom\r\nutterly perishes, and is invariably replaced by one of more extensive\r\nrange and greater utility. When it is remembered that the written\r\nlanguage of China is understood by one-third of the human race;\r\nthat probably more than one-tenth of mankind have an acquaintance\r\nwith spoken English--the language which has far more widely planted\r\nroots, and more extensive ramifications, than any other; when the\r\ndaily decay of the provincial dialects of France, Germany, Spain, and\r\nItaly is watched, good ground will be discovered for the anticipation\r\nthat many of the existing instruments for oral communication will be\r\nextinguished, the number of dead languages will be much augmented,\r\nand of living proportionally decreased.\r\n\r\nI know not on what authority M. Mallat estimated, in 1846, the\r\npopulation of the Philippines at 7,000,000,--an augmentation, he says,\r\nof more than 50 per cent from 1816, when he states the population to\r\nhave been 4,600,000. He says that it quadrupled itself from 1774 to\r\n1816. He attributes the enormous increase from the later period to\r\nthe introduction of vaccination and the general tranquillity of the\r\ncountry; but the correctness of the data may well be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe Christian population of the Philippines is stated by Father Juan\r\nFernandez to be--\r\n\r\n\r\n    ------------------------------------+---------+-----------\r\n                     ----               |Pueblos. |   Souls.\r\n    ------------------------------------+---------+-----------\r\n    Under the Archbishopric of Manila   |  185    |   135,000\r\n       ,,     Bishopric of New Segovia  |  132    |   745,000\r\n       ,,     Bishopric of New Caceres  |  104    |   480,000\r\n       ,,     Bishopric of Zebu         |  306    | 1,200,000\r\n                                        +---------+-----------\r\n                                In all  |  727    | 3,560,000\r\n    ------------------------------------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of the Philippines is generally supposed to be about\r\nfour millions; but, as the Indians who dwell in the interior of several\r\nof the islands--those especially who occupy the unexplored forest and\r\nmountainous districts--cannot be included in any official census, any\r\ncalculations can only be deemed approximative.

There are 670 males\r\nand 119 females in the capital (Manila and Binondo). Of these there\r\nare 114 friars, all living in Manila, eight ecclesiastics, forty-six\r\nmerchants, fourteen medical practitioners, and the majority of the\r\nothers military and civil functionaries. But in none of the islands\r\ndoes the proportion of Spaniards approach that which is found in\r\nthe capital. Probably the whole number of European Spaniards in the\r\nislands does not amount to two thousand.\r\n\r\nThere are ninety-six foreigners established in Binondo--eighty-five\r\nmales and eleven females (none in Manila proper). Of these fifty\r\nare merchants or merchants' assistants. There are twenty-two British\r\nsubjects, fifteen French, fifteen South Americans, eleven citizens\r\nof the United States, nine Germans, and nine Swiss.\r\n\r\nIndependently of European Spaniards, there are many families\r\nwhich call themselves hijos del pays (children of the country),\r\ndescendants of Spanish settlers, who avoid mingling with native\r\nIndian blood. They have the reputation of being more susceptible than\r\nare even the old Castilians in matters of etiquette, and among them\r\nare many who have received a European education. They are generally\r\ncandidates for public employment, but are said to be less steady,\r\nand more addicted to play and to pleasure, than their progenitors;\r\nbut they are eminently hospitable. They dress in European style when\r\nthey appear in public, but at home both men and women use the loose\r\nand more convenient Indian costume. They complain, on their part,\r\nthat barriers are raised between them and their countrymen from the\r\nPeninsula; in a word, that the spirit of caste exercises its separating\r\nand alienating influences in the Philippines, as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe mestizos, or mixed races, form a numerous and influential portion\r\nof the Filipinos; the number settled in the islands of women of\r\nEuropean birth is small, and generally speaking they are the wives\r\nof the higher Spanish functionaries and of superior officers in the\r\narmy and navy, whose term of service is generally limited. Though\r\nthe daughters of families of pure Spanish blood generally marry in\r\nthe colony and keep up a good deal of exclusiveness and caste, it\r\nis seldom that the highest society is without a large proportion of\r\nmestiza ladies, children of Spanish fathers and native mothers. The\r\ngreat majority of the merchants and landed proprietors belong to this\r\nclass, and most of the subordinate offices of government are filled\r\nby them. There are very many descendants of Chinese by native women;\r\nbut the paternal type seems so to absorb the maternal, that the\r\nchildren for whole generations bear the strongly marked character\r\nwhich distinguishes the genuine native of the flowery land, even\r\nthrough a succession of Indian mothers. I shall have occasion to\r\nspeak of a visit I made to a district (Molo, near Iloilo), which\r\nin former times had been the seat of a large Chinese colony, where\r\nthe Chinese race had disappeared centuries ago, but the Chinese\r\nphysiognomy, and the Chinese character, had left their unmistakable\r\ntraces in the whole population. I found nowhere among the natives a\r\npeople so industrious, so persevering, so economical, and, generally,\r\nso prosperous. Almost every house had a loom, and it is the place\r\nwhere the best of the piña fabrics are woven. We were invited to a\r\nball at which the principal native ladies were present, and I had to\r\nanswer a discurso delivered in excellent Castilian by the leading\r\npersonage. I was informed that the young women were remarkable for\r\ntheir chastity, and that an erring sister obtained no forgiveness\r\namong them. Their parents object to their learning Spanish lest it\r\nshould be an instrument of seduction. Of the mestizos of Chinese\r\nor Mongolian descent, De Mas says:--\"They are called Sangley, which\r\nmeans Chinese merchant or traveller. They inherit the industrious and\r\nspeculative spirit of their forefathers. Most of them have acquired\r\nriches and lands, and the largest part of the retail trade is in their\r\nhands. They form the middle class of the Filipinos. Their prosperity\r\nand better education produce the natural results, and their moral and\r\nintellectual character is far superior to that of the Indians. They are\r\nluxuriously dressed, are more elegant and handsome than the Indians;\r\nsome of their women are decidedly beautiful. But they preserve most of\r\nthe habits of the Indians, whom they exceed in attention to religious\r\nduties because they are superior in intelligence. This race is likely\r\nto increase in numbers and in influence, and, in consequence of the\r\nlarge importation of Chinamen, to augment in the localities of their\r\nsettlements at a greater rate than the Indian population.\" [12]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the predominance of the characteristics of\r\nthe father over those of the mother has improved, through successive\r\ngenerations, the general character of the race of mestizo Chinese. They\r\nare more active and enterprising, more prudent and persevering, more\r\ndevoted to trade and commerce, than the Indios. They all preserve the\r\nblack hair, which is characteristic of China, \"the black-haired\" being\r\none of the national names by which the people of the \"middle kingdom\"\r\nare fond of designating themselves. The slanting position of the eyes,\r\nforming an angle over the nose, the beardless chin, the long and\r\ndelicate fingers (in conformity with Chinese usage they frequently\r\nallow the middle nail of the left hand to grow to a great length),\r\ntheir fondness for dress and ornament, distinguish them. They exercise\r\ngreat influence over the Indians, who believe them to be masters\r\nof the art of money-getting. The children of a Spanish mestizo by\r\na Chinese mestiza, are called Torna atras, \"going back;\" those of a\r\nChinese mestizo by an Indian woman are considered as Chinese and not\r\nIndian half-castes. The mingling of Chinese blood is observable in\r\nall the town populations. The number of mestizos of European descent\r\nis trifling compared with those of Chinese origin. Their houses are\r\ninvariably better furnished than those of the natives. Many of them\r\nadopt the European costume, but where they retain the native dress it\r\nis finer in quality, gayer in colours, and richer in ornament. Like\r\nthe natives, they wear their shirts over the trousers, but the shirt\r\nis of piña or sinamay fastened with buttons of valuable stones;\r\nand a gold chain is seldom wanting, suspended round the neck. The\r\nmen commonly wear European hats, shoes and stockings, and the sexes\r\nexhibit no small amount of dandyism and coquetry.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the indigenous population of the Philippine Islands\r\nmay be divided into two principal races--the Tagálos occupying\r\nthe north, and the Bisáyos the south. Of these, all who inhabit\r\nthe towns and villages profess Christianity, and are much under\r\nthe influence of the regular clergy, who administer the religious\r\nordinances in the various provinces, which are, for the most part,\r\nsubmitted to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of different orders of\r\nbrotherhood. There are a few instances of the Indians being invested\r\nwith the full rights of priesthood, though they generally reach\r\nno higher post than that of assistants to the friars. At the great\r\nceremony which I attended of the Purisima Conception at Manila, an\r\nIndian was chosen to deliver the sermon of the day; it was, as usual,\r\nredolent with laudations of the Virgin, and about equal to the average\r\nstyle of flowery Spanish preaching. But as we recede from the towns,\r\nreligious ordinances are neglected, and in the centre and mountainous\r\nparts of the islands Christianity ceases to be the profession of the\r\ninhabitants; the friars deplore their ignorant and abandoned state,\r\nand occupy themselves in the endeavour to bring them into their\r\nfold, and to enforce the payment of that tributo from which they,\r\nas well as the government, derive their revenues. If this be paid,\r\nif the services of the Church be duly performed, confession made,\r\nfit co-operation given to the religious processions and festivals\r\n(which are the native holidays), matters go on well between the clergy\r\nand the people. I found many of the friars objects of affection and\r\nreverence, and deservedly so, as guardians and restorers of the family\r\npeace, encouragers of the children in their studies, and otherwise\r\nassociating their efforts with the well-being of the community;\r\nbut removed, as the ecclesiastics frequently are, from the control\r\nof public opinion, there is often scandal, and good ground for it.\r\n\r\nFather Zuñiga opines that the Philippines were originally colonized by\r\nthe inhabitants of America; but he fails altogether in the proofs he\r\nseeks in the analogy of languages. The number of Malayan words in Tagal\r\nand Bisayan is greater than any to be traced to American dialects;\r\nand here I may remark, by the way, that there is no topic on which so\r\nmuch absurdity has been committed to the press as on the derivation\r\nand affinity of languages--a subject in which Spanish authority is\r\nseldom of much value. El Señor Erro, for example, in his book on the\r\nantiquity of the Bascuence, gives a description and picture of a jar\r\nfound in a well in Guipuscoa, which had on it the words \"Gott erbarme\r\ndein armes Würmchen!\" This he reports to be a Biscayan inscription\r\nin honour of the priestesses of the sun anterior to the introduction\r\nof Christianity, and he doubts not that the vase (a piece of coarse\r\nmodern German pottery) was used in the sacred services of the temple!\r\n\r\nDe Mas supposes that the Indians employed alphabetical writing anterior\r\nto the arrival of the Spanish, and gives five alphabets as used in\r\ndifferent provinces, but having some resemblance to one another. I\r\ndoubt alike the antiquity and authenticity of the records; but give\r\na specimen which he says is a contract upon Chinese paper for a sale\r\nof land in Bulacan, dated 1652.\r\n\r\nMy own inquiries led to no discoveries of old records, or written\r\ntraditions, or inscriptions of remote times, associated with Indian\r\nhistory. There is sufficient evidence that some rude authority\r\nexisted--that there were masters and slaves--that the land was\r\npartially cultivated and the sea explored by labourers and fishermen,\r\nleading necessarily to a recognition of some rights of property--that\r\nthere were wars between hostile tribes, which had their leaders and\r\ntheir laws. The early records of the missionaries give the names\r\nof some of the chiefs, and detail the character of the authority\r\nexercised by the ruling few over the subject many. They say that\r\ngold would procure the emancipation of a slave and his reception\r\namong the Mahaldicas, or privileged class. Prisoners of war, debtors,\r\nand criminals, were held in bonds. The daughter of a Mahaldica could\r\nbe obtained in marriage, where the lover was unable to pay her money\r\nvalue, by vassalage to her father for a certain number of years. If\r\na man of one tribe married the woman of another, the children were\r\nequally, or as nearly as possible, divided among the two tribes to\r\nwhich the parents belonged. Property was partitioned among the sons\r\nat the father's death, the elder enjoying no rights over the younger.\r\n\r\nLocal superstitions prevailed as to rocks, trees, and rivers. They\r\nworshipped the sun and moon; a blue bird called tigmamanoquin; a stag\r\nnamed meylupa, \"lord of the soil;\" and the crocodile, to which they\r\ngave the title of nono, or \"grandfather.\" A demon named Osuang was\r\nsupposed to torment children, to cause pains in childbirth, to live\r\non human flesh, and to have his presence announced by the tictic,\r\na bird of evil augury. Naked men brandished swords from the roof and\r\nother parts of the choza to frighten the fiend away, or the pregnant\r\nwoman was removed from the neighbourhood of the tictic. The Manacolam\r\nwas a monster enveloped in flames, which could only be extinguished by\r\nthe ordure of a human being, whose death would immediately follow. The\r\nSilagan seized and tore out the liver of persons clad in white. The\r\nMagtatangal deposited his head and entrails in the evening in some\r\nsecret place, wandered about doing mischief in the night, and resumed\r\nhis \"deposit\" at break of day. So strange and wild are the fancies of\r\ncredulity! Sacrifices were offered in deprecation of menaced evils,\r\nor in compliment to visitors, by female priestesses called Catalona,\r\nwho distributed pieces of the sacrificed animal. There were many\r\nwitches and sorcerers, exercising various functions, one of whom,\r\nthe Manyisalat, was the love inspirer and the confidant of youths\r\nand maidens.\r\n\r\nOn entering a forest the Indian supplicated the demons not to molest\r\nhim. The crackling of wood, the sight of a snake in a cottage newly\r\nbuilt, were deemed presages of evil. In the house of a fisherman it\r\nwas deemed improper to speak of a forest, in that of a huntsman of\r\nthe sea. A pregnant woman was not allowed to cut her hair, lest her\r\nchild should he horn hairless.\r\n\r\nThe price paid for a woman given in marriage was regulated by the\r\nposition of the parties. The mother had a claim, as well as the nurse\r\nwho had had charge of the childhood of the bride. Whatever expense\r\nthe daughter had caused to the father he was entitled to recover from\r\nthe bridegroom. Among opulent families there was a traditional price,\r\nsuch as the father or grandfather had paid for their wives. If the\r\nbride had no living parents, her price was paid to herself. Three days\r\nbefore the marriage the roof of the parental dwelling was extended,\r\nand an apartment, called a palapala, added for the wedding festival;\r\nthe guests brought their presents to the bride, and, whatever the\r\nvalue, it was expected that when, on future occasions, the relations\r\nof hosts and guests were changed, an offering of not less value should\r\nbe given. Among the ceremonies it was required that the lovers should\r\neat from the same plate and drink from the same cup. Mutual pledges\r\nand promises of affection were given, and the catalona pronounced\r\na benediction. Sad scenes of drunkenness and scandal are said to\r\nhave followed the ceremony in the after festivities, which lasted\r\nthree days. In the northern islands only one wife was allowed, but\r\nany number of handmaids and slaves; in the south, where, no doubt,\r\nIslamism was not without its influence, any number of legitimate\r\nwives was permitted: circumcision was also practised.\r\n\r\nHired mourners, as well as the members of the family, were\r\ngathered round the corpse, and sang hymns proclaiming the virtues\r\nof the dead. The body was washed, perfumed, dressed and sometimes\r\nembalmed. The poor were speedily buried in the silong over which their\r\nhuts were constructed. The rich were kept for several days, laid out\r\nin a coffin made of a solid trunk, the mouth covered with gold-leaf,\r\nand the place of sepulture any favourite spot which the deceased\r\nmight have selected; if on the bank of a river, the passage of boats\r\nwas interdicted for some time, lest the dead should interfere with\r\nthe concerns of the living, and a guard had charge of the tomb, near\r\nwhich the garments, usual food and arms of the departed were placed\r\nin a separate box--in the case of a woman, her loom and instruments\r\nof labour. Where a chief of distinction was interred, a building was\r\nerected, in which two goats, two deer, and two pigs were imprisoned\r\nand a fettered slave belonging to the deceased, who was ordered to\r\naccompany his master to the other world, and died a miserable death\r\nof starvation. It was supposed on the third day after the interment\r\nthat the dead man visited his family: a vase of water was placed\r\nat the door, that he might wash and free himself from the dirt of\r\nthe grave; a wax light was left burning through the day; mats were\r\nspread and covered with ashes, that the footmarks of the dead might\r\nbe traced; and the door was opened at the accustomed time of meals,\r\nand a splendid repast laid out for the expected visitor. No doubt\r\nit was disposed of by the attendants in the same way as other costly\r\nsacrifices. The Indians of the north put on black, those of the south\r\nwhite, mourning robes.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of justice the elders were consulted, but there\r\nwas no code of laws, and the missionaries affirm that the arbitrators\r\nof quarrels were generally but too well paid for their awards. Murder\r\ncommitted by a slave was punished with death--committed by a person\r\nof rank, was indemnified by payments to the injured family. When a\r\nrobbery took place, all the suspected persons were ordered to bring\r\na load of grass; these loads were mixed in a heap, and if the stolen\r\narticle was found it was restored to the owner, and no inquiry made\r\nas to the bringer of the bundle in which it was concealed. If this\r\nmethod failed, they flung all the suspected into a river, and held\r\nhim to be guilty who came first to the surface, on the theory that\r\nremorse would not allow him to keep his breath. Many are said to have\r\nbeen drowned in order to escape the ignominy of rising out of the\r\nwater. They sometimes placed candles of equal length in the hands\r\nof all the accused, and he was held to be guilty whose candle first\r\nwent out. Another mode was to gather the accused round a light, and he\r\ntowards whom the flames turned was condemned as the criminal. Adultery\r\nwas condoned for by fine to the wronged persons.\r\n\r\nGold was used by weight as the medium of exchange, but there was no\r\ncoined or stamped currency. The largest weight was called a gael, but\r\nit represented a dollar and a quarter in silver, nearly corresponding\r\nto the Chinese ounce or tael; a gael consisted of two tinga, a tinga\r\nof two sapaha; [13] a sapaha was divided into sangraga, a very small\r\nbean, which was the minimum weight. Accounts were kept by heaps of\r\nstones of different sizes. Their measures were the dipa (brace = 6\r\nfeet), the dancal (palm), tumuro (span), sangdamac (breadth of the\r\nhand), sangdati (breadth of the finger). Thus, as among many rude\r\nnations (the vestiges are still to be traced in the phraseology of\r\ncivilization) every man carried with him his standard of mensuration.\r\n\r\nTime was reckoned by suns and moons, in the Philippines as in\r\nChina. In Chinese the same words designate day and sun, moon and month,\r\nharvest and year. The morning was called \"cock-crowing,\" the evening\r\n\"sun-leaving.\"\r\n\r\nNo Indian passed another without a salutation and a bending of the\r\nleft knee. An inferior entering the house of a superior crouched\r\ndown until ordered to rise. Earrings were worn by women and sometimes\r\nby men; the chiefs had coloured turbans, scarlet if they had killed\r\nan enemy, striped if they had killed seven or more. Peace was made\r\nby the mingling blood with wine, and each drank of the blood of the\r\nother. This was the most solemn of their oaths.\r\n\r\nChastity seems to have been unknown, though a price was always exacted\r\nfor a woman's favours.\r\n\r\nMany Mahomedan superstitions and usages had found their way to the\r\ninterior, and among them the rite of circumcision.\r\n\r\nAll the Indians are born with a circular dark spot on the buttock,\r\nof the size of a shilling; as their skins darken the mark extends,\r\nbecomes lighter in colour, and in age is scarcely distinguishable.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that the Indians were formerly in the habit\r\nof punishing an unpopular person by a penalty which they called\r\nCobacolo, and which was inflicted on any who had misled them by false\r\ncounsels. The whole population assembled, went to the house of the\r\noffender, every one bearing a cudgel; some surrounded the house to\r\nprevent escape, and others entered and, by blows, drove the victim to\r\nthe balcony, from whence he was compelled to leap, and he was then\r\nchased out of the neighbourhood, after which the house was razed to\r\nthe ground, and all that it contained destroyed. The tradition is\r\npreserved in many popular proverbs and phrases, in which the Cobacolo\r\nis used as a menace to evil-doers.\r\n\r\nAmong the most celebrated books on the Philippines are the \"Cronicas\r\nFranciscanas,\" by Fr. Gaspar de S. Agustin, an Augustine monk of\r\nMadrid, who lived forty years among the Indians, and from whose\r\ndescriptions I have made a few selections; but there are remarkable\r\ncontrarieties of opinion among different writers. Their fields\r\nof observation are different, and natural temperament has much to\r\ndo with the judgment formed. Our friar does not give the natives a\r\nfavourable character. According to him they are generally \"inconstant,\r\ndistrustful, malicious, sleepy, idle, timid, and fond of travelling\r\nby rivers, lakes, and seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are great consumers of fish, which are found in immense\r\nabundance. After rains the fields and marshes and ponds are filled\r\nwith them. Fish two palms long are often pulled up from among the\r\npaddy. As the waters dry up, the fish retreat to any muddy recess, and\r\nthe Indians catch them with their hands, or kill them with sticks.\" I\r\nhave seen many Indians fishing in the paddy grounds, and what becomes\r\nof the fish in the times of drought, when no \"muddy recesses\" are\r\nto be found, it is hard to say, but where there is water fish may\r\ninvariably be sought for with success.\r\n\r\n\"They eat three meals a day, consisting principally of rice, the sweet\r\npotato, and a small quantity of fish or meat; the daily cost of the\r\nwhole being half a rial\" (= 3d. sterling). \"As labourers they get\r\nhalf a rial in addition to their food. They willingly borrow money,\r\nwhich they do not repay, and he who will not encourage ingratitude must\r\nshow them no favour; to exact a promise is to ensure a falsehood. They\r\nare the ingrates described in the 36th Psalm. They never shut the\r\ndoor they have opened; they return nothing to its place; they never\r\ndo the work they have been paid for beforehand, yet they do not fail\r\nto ask for an advance: the carpenter must have money to buy wood;\r\nthe washerman to get soap; and they even practise their devices upon\r\nthe parish priest! They have the art of blundering about everything;\r\nthey fold all garments the wrong way; turn a shirt inside out, always\r\npresent the back where the front should be.\" The father is somewhat\r\nsevere, and of my own experience I can say there was at least about as\r\nmuch chance in such matters of the Indians doing right as wrong. Alava\r\nsaid of the Indians that their brains were in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe padre continues:--\"They are envious, ill-bred, and\r\nimpertinent. They will even ask a padre, 'Whence do you come? where\r\nare you going?' If you are reading a letter, they will look over your\r\nshoulders, though not able to read themselves; and if two people are\r\ntalking in secret, the Indians will come near, though not understanding\r\na word.\" Grave charges these. \"They enter houses, and even convents,\r\nwithout leave, and seem to make themselves at home in a manner to\r\nexcite wonderment and anger; even when the padre is asleep, they make\r\na great noise in trampling the floor, though in their own houses they\r\nwalk with as much care as if treading among eggs. They use no chairs\r\nat home, but absolutely wear out those of the convents by sitting\r\nand lounging on them, particularly in the balconies, where they can\r\nget a look at the women.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts are as characteristic of the monk as of the\r\nIndian. \"They care nothing for dog, cat, horse nor cow; the game-cock\r\nis their great concern; him they visit at dawn; him they caress through\r\nthe day; they will contemplate him with eyes fixed for half an hour\r\nat a time: the passion never decays; many of them think of nothing\r\nelse. The government patronizes cock-fights. Last year they produced\r\n40,000 dollars\" (in 1859, 86,000 dollars); \"sad resource this for so\r\nmany tears, crimes, and punishments! What quarrels, what lawsuits, what\r\nappeals! And in their gambling they pass the night till sunrise. The\r\nchief of the Barangay (clan) loses the tribute-money he has collected;\r\nhis doom is the prison, or a flight to the mountains. They hate to\r\nlive in houses or convents where they would be placed beyond even the\r\nodour of women. They take care of their own plates, and exhibit in\r\ntheir dwellings some possessed before the arrival of the Spaniards,\r\nbut in convents and houses they break plates enough to ruin their\r\nmasters. This is because of their stupidity, or that they are\r\nthinking of their beloved, or of anything but what ought to occupy\r\ntheir thoughts; and if they let fall a dish, it is passed over by\r\nthe Spaniards, or they are only called 'brute! animal! savage!' In\r\ntheir own house, however, the breaking a piece of earthenware would be\r\nfollowed with a good number of cane blows, and this is of more efficacy\r\nthan all Cicero's Philippics (sic in orig.) They cannot be trusted\r\nwith a sword, mirror, glass, gun, watch, nor any delicate thing;\r\nthey are sure to spoil it. You may confide to them a bamboo, a stick,\r\na piece of timber, a palm-branch, and to a few of them a ploughshare.\r\n\r\n\"They are bold and insolent in making unreasonable requests, careless\r\nof the when or the how. They remind me in their petitions of what\r\nhappened to Sancho Panza in the island of Barataria, when troubled\r\nwith that impertinent and intrusive rustic Michael Turra. For their\r\nfour eggs they want a hundred dollars. I never see an Indian coming\r\ntowards me with a gift--something worthless, of course, and of no\r\nuse to himself--flowers or fruits, but I exclaim, in the words of\r\nLaocoon to the Trojans\" (grandiloquent friar!) \"'Timeo Danaos dona\r\nferentes.' The Bishop of Troya, Don Francisco Gines Barrientes, a most\r\ncircumspect prelate, told me that an Indian brought him a handkerchief\r\nof Guava fruit and asked him for the loan of fifty dollars. And when\r\nthe Lord Marquis de Villasierra, Don Fernando de Valenzuela, was in\r\nthe castle of Cavite, an Indian gave him a cock, for which the Marquis\r\nordered him to be paid six times its value, and the Indian said he\r\nexpected eighty cavans of rice, and this, too, was in the time of\r\nscarcity, when every cavan was worth two dollars. It matters little,\r\nhowever, for they are just as well pleased when they fail as when\r\nthey succeed, for they do not value anything given them by a Spaniard,\r\nnot even by a priest! In selling they will ask thirty and accept six;\r\nthey take the chance of cheating, and, knowing the great goodness\r\n(la suma bondad) of the Spanish character, they do not apprehend any\r\nexpression of anger in consequence of an absurd pretension.\"\r\n\r\nThe friar thus describes a negotiation between an Indian peasant\r\nand a merchant:--\"The peasant has two or three hundredweight of\r\nindigo for sale; he does not come alone, but with his relations,\r\nfriends, and sometimes the women, for the indigo belongs to several\r\nwho form the suite of the seller. Every offer has to be communicated\r\nto the party, who are crouched in a circle round the negotiator;\r\nthe offer being discussed, they agree to the reduction of a dollar\r\nin the price--the buyer requires three; this matter being settled,\r\nanother discussion begins; some of the indigo is damp and dirty,\r\nand an allowance must be made, and thus the negotiation goes on\r\nharassing and never-ending, so that very few Spaniards will tolerate\r\nsuch impertinence and importunity, and the conference ends by a\r\ndry inquiry, 'Will you? yes! or no!' If no, the Indians are angrily\r\nordered into the street, but the more patient mestizos and Chinese\r\nmake the Indians their guests, feed them and lodge them, and get these\r\ncommodities on their own terms, in Chinese style, for the Indian is\r\nvery stupid in trading matters.\" And then the father gives abundant\r\nevidence of their simplicity. \"In fine, the Indian prefers the rial\r\nof a Chinese to the dollar of a Spaniard.\" Who can wonder, then,\r\nat the prosperous condition of the Chinese in the Philippines? \"The\r\nIndians show great indifference to danger: they will not move out\r\nof the way of a restive horse, nor, if in a small boat, give place\r\nto a large one. In the river, if they see crocodiles approaching,\r\nthey take no notice and adopt no precautions. The Koran says that\r\nevery one has his fate written in the marks on his forehead; so\r\nthink the Indians, not that they have read the Koran, but because\r\nof their own folly, which exposes them to daily misfortunes.\" \"They\r\nare very credulous among themselves, yet believe nothing but what is\r\nunfavourable about the Spaniards. It is evident that the act of faith\r\nis supernatural when they acknowledge the divine mysteries taught\r\nby the Spaniards. In other matters they believe in nothing which is\r\nadverse to their interests. They do not object to rob Spaniards, not\r\neven the ministers of religion. Of this we have irresistible evidence,\r\nso that there can be no doubt, and we can only regret that no remedy\r\ncan be found.\"\r\n\r\nThe Augustine provincial friar of Ilocos, reporting on the insurrection\r\nof 1807 in that province, says:--\"Here, as elsewhere, there are\r\nabundance of robbers and pilferers; it is of no use to bring them to\r\nManila, they should be punished in the locality; but they can be no\r\nmore extirpated than can the rats and mice. Indeed there is an Indian\r\nproverb which says:--'Robbers and rats will disappear together.'\" I\r\ncannot endorse the friar's indiscriminating censures, for I have heard\r\nextraordinary evidences of extraordinary integrity. The Alcalde of\r\nCagayan told me that, though he had frequently left uncounted dollars\r\nin the care of the Indians, he had never discovered a single fraud.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that the rich and potent friars were tolerably\r\nwell protected against the Indians, yet one of them writes:--\"The\r\nIndians do not now employ lances and arrows against our ministry, but\r\npapers, pens, tales, jokes and calumnies. So much have they been taught\r\npolitics in Manila that now in all the pueblos are obscure scribblers,\r\npettifoggers, pretenders, who are clever enough in writing memorials on\r\nstamped paper, to be presented to the Royal Audiencia. So if the parish\r\npriest reprove or punish them for their evil and scandalous lives, they\r\nmeet together, drink wine, and fill a folio paper with their crosses,\r\nand march off to Manila, to the tribunal which they deem the most\r\nimpressionable, from whence great vexations are caused to the poor\r\nparish priest. And much courage is required to bear this species of\r\nmartyrdom, which is sufficiently common in the Indies.\"--(Abbé Amodea.)\r\n\r\nI do not know how lately there have been perquisitions against\r\nwitches, but in the middle of the last century I find the record of\r\na most diligent pursuit and rigorous punishment against the witches\r\nof Pampanga. The proceedings were superintended by a friar named\r\nTheodore of the Mother of God, who made a special report to the Mexican\r\nInquisition. He says:--\"There are witches in every pueblo, and in some\r\nthey form a third part of the population. These slaves of the devil\r\nare divided into sundry classes: lamias, who suck the blood of infants;\r\nstriges, who are wanderers on the face of the earth; sagas, who dwell\r\nin houses, and convey to the devil all the information he requires;\r\nlarvas, who devote themselves to carnal delights; temures, who prepare\r\nlove filtres; but all unite to do mischief to the human race.\"\r\n\r\nOf the credulity of the Indians there is no end of examples. In 1832,\r\nwhen the Santa Ana arrived with 250 soldiers, a report spread like\r\nwild-fire that the King of Spain had ordered all the children of the\r\nIndians to be collected, that their blood might be spilt upon the\r\nSpanish mines to make them more productive. The women fled to their\r\nhomes, seized their children, and sought an asylum in the houses\r\nof the Spanish ladies in Manila. The men armed themselves with\r\nspears, and rushed tumultuously through the streets. The agitation\r\nwas appeased with some difficulty. What any man reputed as a sage\r\namong the Indians avers, acquires immediate authority, and is not\r\nto be controlled by the influence of the priests; the words \"Vica\r\nng maruning,\" meaning \"The wise say so,\" is the ready answer to all\r\nimpugners. \"God preserve us,\" says the friar, \"from Indian sages! for\r\nthe Indians are proud, and will not obey the priest, nor the friar,\r\nnor the chaplain, unless obliged by fear, and they are not always\r\nafraid, though they feel thoroughly convinced of the superiority of\r\nthe Spaniard, and are governed in spite of themselves. They imitate the\r\nSpaniard in all that is evil--his love of dress, his swearing habits,\r\naddiction to gaming, and all the vicious practices of the zaramullos\r\n(fops or busy-bodies); but Spanish courtesy and urbanity and good\r\neducation they neither study nor copy; but revels and drunken bouts,\r\nand riotous weddings and burial excesses and tyrannical acts of all\r\nsorts they have inherited from their ancestors, and still preserve,\r\nso that they have Spanish vices added to their own.\"\r\n\r\nThey show much deference to everything that is aristocratic\r\namong themselves. The jacket-wearing principalia are treated with\r\ngreat deference, and their rank religiously respected. First, the\r\ngobernadorcillo; then the ex-gobernadorcillos, who are called passed\r\ncaptains, in order of seniority; then the acting lieutenant, who must\r\nbe the head of a barangay; then the heads of barangays according to\r\nage; then passed lieutenants, and so on; and their rank is recognized\r\nby the adjacent communities.\r\n\r\nBathing is universal, men and women in the same place. The men wear\r\npantaloons, the women cover themselves with a garment which they throw\r\noff when they enter the water. No scandal is caused by the habit,\r\nand several attempts of the Spanish authorities to interfere with\r\nthe ancient usage have failed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians embrace by touching noses; but lip-kissing often\r\naccompanies the act. When the nostril is contracted (as in the act\r\nof smelling), and the Indian looks towards a person at a distance,\r\nit is deemed an invitation to a closer embrace. Strange stories are\r\ntold of the exquisite sense of smell possessed by the Indians; that by\r\nit they can distinguish the dresses of their masters and mistresses,\r\nand lovers ascertain the state of each other's affections. Inner\r\ngarments are interchanged which are supposed to be impregnated with\r\nthe passions of the owners. In disregard of the monks, the Indians\r\nsecretly circumcise their children. The banian-tree (Balete, Ficus\r\nIndica) is held sacred. They burn incense under it, which they obtain\r\nfrom the friars under various pretences. How strangely are the rites\r\nof idolatry mingled with Christian observances! This is not the case\r\nalone in the Philippines. One of Dr. Gutzlaff's renowned converts\r\nin Hong Kong used to say that to please the missionary he had added\r\nanother god--the Christian's God--to those he worshipped before;\r\nand I have known of secret visits to heathen temples on the part of\r\nChinese professing Christians, when they were about to enter upon\r\nany important undertaking. \"There is no driving out of them,\" says\r\nthe padre, \"the cursed belief that the spirits of their ancestors are\r\nin the woods and among the roots of bamboos, and that they can bring\r\ngood or evil upon them. They will offer sacrifices to them; and all\r\nour books and all our preachings have failed to remove the impressions\r\nleft by any old man whom they choose to call 'a sage.'\" \"The curates,\"\r\nsays De Mas, \"profess to believe that these superstitions are passing\r\naway; no doubt the Indian conceals them as much as he can from his\r\nfather confessor, but I have on many occasions convinced myself of\r\ntheir existence and influence.\" Who, indeed, knowing anything of\r\nthe credulity of the less instructed classes, and not these alone,\r\namong ourselves, can wonder at the state of \"the religious mind\" of\r\nthe Philippine Indian? And so little are the priests themselves wholly\r\nfree from infirmity, that a Philippine curate, Mallares, committed and\r\ncaused to be committed no less than fifty-seven assassinations in the\r\ntown of Magalan, believing that he should thus save his mother from\r\nbeing bewitched. Mallares was executed in 1840; and in his report\r\nthe fiscal expresses his horror of \"the incredible and barbarous\r\nprodigality of bloodshed by this monster.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indian knows no medium,\" again to quote from the father. \"Ask for\r\ntepid water, he will bring it boiling; say it is too hot, and you will\r\nget it quite cold. He lives in a circle of extremes. He rejoices if you\r\nlose patience and give him a beating, for he goes and boasts of having\r\nput his master into a passion. To irritate the Indian, you must take no\r\nnotice of his short-comings. The sagacious men among them say that the\r\nIndian and the cane (for his correction) always grow together. They\r\nhave another proverb: 'The Spaniard is fire, and the Indian snow,\r\nand the snow puts out the fire.'\" One of the padres reports that his\r\nservant-boy said to him: \"You are a new comer, and are too indulgent:\r\nif I do amiss you ought to chastise me. Don't you know the proverb,\r\n'The Indian and the cane grow together?'\" \"They blaspheme and abuse\r\nGod when their prayers are not granted, and use language which would\r\nindeed be horrible were it not known how thoughtless they are, and how\r\nimpossible it is for them to conform themselves to the Divine will.\"\r\n\r\nThey are fond of religious dramas, especially of one in Tagál\r\nrepresenting the passion and death of Christ; but these religious\r\nrepresentations and gatherings give rise to scandal and abuse, and\r\nthe birth of many illegitimate children. The priests have generally\r\nprohibited these exhibitions at night, and sometimes disperse them,\r\nwhip in hand; at other times the singers are denounced, and get\r\nflogged for their pains--or pleasures.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to read the contradictory opinions of the friars\r\nrespecting their flocks. One says:--\"Their confessions are false;\r\nthey never own to any but three sins: first, that they have neglected\r\nchurch-going; second, that they eat meat during Lent; and third, that\r\nthey have sworn profanely.\" Another reports--\"No Spaniard can be more\r\ndevout and fervid than the Indians of Manila in their confessions. They\r\nobey the instructions they receive, and I have the same good account\r\nfrom many padres of many Indians in the provinces.\" No doubt the\r\necclesiastical statistics would be curious, if obtainable. In Lilio,\r\nthe curate reports that of 1,300 persons paying tribute in 1840,\r\n600 never confessed, and \"this pueblo is not of the most remiss.\" In\r\nVigan, of 30,000 inhabitants, the attendance at church did not exceed\r\nfrom 500 to 800 (De Mas), except on the yearly festival of the Virgin,\r\npatroness of the pueblo. Father Agustin's indignation is vehemently\r\nexpressed as regards confession:--\"The infernal Macchiavel Satan has\r\ntaught them a policy as good for their bodies as bad for their souls,\r\nwhich is that they own their errors and crimes to one another, and\r\nconceal them, however excessive, from the spiritual father, from the\r\nSpanish alcalde, notwithstanding their personal quarrels, and, as they\r\ncall them, murder-enmities; so that there is among them no greater\r\noffence than to tell the padre or the alcalde what has happened in\r\nthe pueblo, which they say is mabibig, the most abominable of sins;\r\nindeed, the only offence which they hold to be sin.\"\r\n\r\nThe friars speak in general more favourably of the women than of the\r\nmen. They are more devout, more submissive, more willing to listen\r\nto their ghostly fathers, one of whom says:--\"Did all mankind hang\r\nupon a single peg, and that peg were wanted by an Indian for his\r\nhat, he would sacrifice all mankind. They have no fear of death, but\r\nthis is an infinite mercy of the Divine Being, who knows how fragile\r\nthey are; they talk about death, even in the presence of the dying,\r\nwithout any concern. If condemned to the scaffold, they exhibit equal\r\nindifference, and smoke their cigar with wonted tranquillity. Their\r\nanswer to the attendant priest is invariably, 'I know I am going\r\nto die. I cannot help it. I have been wicked--it was the will of\r\nGod,--it was my fate,' But the approach of death neither interferes\r\nwith their sleep nor their meals.\" \"The tree must bear its fruit,\"\r\nhe continues. \"God in his wisdom has made many races of men, as He\r\nhas made many varieties of flowers, and at last I reconciled myself to\r\nseeing the Indians do everything differently from what we should do,\r\nand keeping this in view, I could mould them like wax to my purpose.\"\r\n\r\nAs a general result I have not found among these Indian races any one\r\ndistinguished for intellectual superiority. A few were not backward in\r\ntheir knowledge of the mechanical arts; one or two examples there were\r\nof genius as sculptors; a universal love and devotion to the musical\r\nart, and some appreciation even of the merits of European composers;\r\nbut, it must be added, little or nothing is done to develop such\r\ncapacities as the Indians possess; the field of public instruction is\r\nnarrowed alike by religious and official influences, and the social\r\ntone of the opulent classes, to which alone the Indian can look up,\r\nis greatly below that of the Spanish peninsula. Literature is little\r\ncultivated: the public newspapers are more occupied with the lives of\r\nsaints, and preparation for, or accounts of, religious fiestas, than\r\nwith the most stirring events of the political world. The Spaniards\r\nhave never been celebrated for very busy inquiries, or very active\r\nvirtues; but it is to be hoped that the mañana, to which everything\r\nis referred, will at last become an hoy dia.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of the Indian that he is more of a quadruped than a\r\nbiped. His hands are large, and the toes of his feet pliant, being\r\nexercised in climbing trees, and divers other active functions. He\r\nis almost amphibious, passing much of his time in the water. He\r\nis insensible alike to the burning sun and the drenching rain. The\r\nimpressions made upon him are transitory, and he retains a feeble\r\nmemory of passing or past events. Ask him his age, he will not\r\nbe able to answer: who were his ancestors? he neither knows nor\r\ncares. He receives no favours and cannot, therefore, be ungrateful;\r\nhas little ambition, and therefore little disquiet; few wants, and\r\nhence is neither jealous nor envious; does not concern himself with the\r\naffairs of his neighbour, nor indeed does he pay much regard to his\r\nown. His master vice is idleness, which is his felicity. The labour\r\nthat necessity demands he gives grudgingly. His health is generally\r\ngood, and when deranged he satisfies himself with the use of herbs,\r\nof whose astringent or laxative powers he has had experience. He uses\r\nno soap to wash, no razor to shave; the river is his bathing-place,\r\nand he pulls out the hairs in his face with the assistance of a sharp\r\nshell; he wants no clock to tell him of the flight of time--no table,\r\nnor chairs, nor plates, nor cutlery, to assist him at his meals;\r\na hacha, or large knife, and bag are generally hung at his waist;\r\nhe thinks no music equal to the crowing of his cock, and holds a shoe\r\nto be as superfluous as a glove or a neck-collar.\r\n\r\nI certainly have not discovered among the Indians that enduring\r\n\"à tout jamais\" horror of foreigners upon which M. Mallat dwells,\r\nand which he represents as specially and properly directed against\r\nEnglishmen. On the contrary, I found many Englishmen settled in\r\nthe Philippines objects of great confidence and affection; and I\r\nhave heard mestizos and Indians say that they put greater trust\r\nin English commercial probity than in that of any other nation. I\r\nhave witnessed the cordiality with which the old Spanish proverb,\r\n\"Paz con Ynglaterra y con todo el mundo guerra,\" has been quoted in\r\nlarge assemblies of the Filipinos. And assuredly there is no nation\r\nwhich has contributed more than England to the prosperity of the\r\nSpanish archipelago. Evidence enough will be found in the course of\r\nthis narrative of the kindness shown to Englishmen.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Spaniards have very discreetly and\r\nsuccessfully used the \"divide et impera\" among the Indian races as\r\na means of preserving their own authority. There is little sympathy,\r\nit is true, between the remoter races; but that their separation and\r\naberration form a part of the Spanish policy may be disproved by the\r\nfact that in Binondo nearly one-third of the resident inhabitants\r\nare Indians from distant provinces.\r\n\r\nThe numerical power of the Spaniards is small, that of the armed\r\nnatives great, were there among them a disposition to rebel against\r\ntheir rulers: I believe there is little of such disposition. Lately\r\nthe Tagál soldiers have been called into active service in a foreign\r\ncountry (Cochin China), and involved in a quarrel where the Spanish\r\ninterest is not very discernible. No complaints have been made of\r\ntheir conduct, though they have been exposed to much privation.\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty custom among the peasantry of the interior. Little\r\nbamboo frames are seen either supported by a post, or projecting from\r\na window of the choza, on which is to be found, covered with plantain\r\nleaves, a supply of food, or fruits, provided from the Indian's garden,\r\nwhich invariably surrounds his dwelling. Any passing traveller supplies\r\nhimself, paying nothing if he be poor, but otherwise leaving such\r\ncompensation as he may deem proper. No sort of reproach attaches\r\nto the person who, without the means of payment, partakes of the\r\nproffered bounty. These hospitable receptacles are most common in\r\nthe least peopled localities, and reminded me of the water and the\r\nlamp which I have found in the tombs of sainted Mussulmans, who had\r\nthemselves discharged, or required their followers thus to discharge,\r\nthe claims of humanity, and in the arid desert provided these grateful,\r\nsilent, and touching welcomes to the thirsty and weary traveller.\r\n\r\nThe tact or talent of imitation is strong among the Indians,\r\nand facilitated the efforts of the friars, but very various and\r\ncontradictory reports are found of their aptitudes. Those of Pampanga,\r\nCagayan, Pangasinan, Ilocos, and Zebu are reported to be valiant,\r\ngenerous, laborious, and frequently exhibiting artistical taste. I\r\nfound the love and the practice of music universal, and saw some\r\nremarkable specimens of sculptural ability, but of painting nothing\r\nIndian was ever presented to my attention, and the examples of\r\npersevering dedication to any sort of labour were few indeed. As\r\nservants, the Tagáls are in all respects inferior to the Chinese;\r\nas soldiers, the officers generally reported of them favourably. The\r\nIndians settled in Manila are said to be the worst of their races:\r\nno doubt great cities are the recipients of the dregs of a people,\r\nbut they attract at the same time the highest order of merit. The\r\ncourtesies which we received as their guests seemed boundless; no\r\neffort too great to do us honour: something, indeed much, could not\r\nbut be attributed to the guidance of the priests and the presence\r\nof the authorities, but there were a thousand marks of spontaneous\r\nkindness, such as no external influence could have commanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND SUPERSTITIONS OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFar more than the fair portion of domestic and social cares falls\r\nupon the Indian female, and she has far less than her becoming\r\nshare of enjoyments. Barbarous practices are frequently associated\r\nwith parturition. The Mabuting hilot, the good midwife, is called\r\nin. If the birth be delayed, witches are supposed to be the cause,\r\nand their dispersion is effected by the explosion of gunpowder from\r\na bamboo cane close to the head of the sufferer. The new-born infant\r\nis laid on a mat or pillow and exposed to the air, to facilitate the\r\nescape of evil influences from the body, which is brought about by\r\nburning three wax tapers placed on the two cheeks and chin of the\r\nbabe, often to its great peril. These practices are to some extent\r\nchecked and controlled by the priests, who provide where they can\r\nfor the baptism and registration of the infant.\r\n\r\nThe patriarchal custom of serving in the house of the father in\r\norder to obtain the hand and heart of the daughter, is by no means\r\nabolished in the Philippines; nor is the yet more intimate intercourse\r\nof plighted lovers, which is reported to be still in usage in the\r\nruder parts of Wales, and with the same perilous consequences to\r\nthe feebler sex. The domestication of the lover in the house of\r\nhis intended father-in-law leads to the birth of great numbers of\r\nillegitimate children, to frequent violations of vows and promises,\r\nto domestic quarrels and much misery. The influence of the friars\r\nis generally employed for the protection of the frail one. They are\r\nopposed both by duty and interest to these irregularities, matrimonial\r\nfees being among the most productive contributions to their revenues.\r\n\r\nI find one of the priests giving the following instructions to\r\nthe Indians as to marriage:--\"It is not right,\" he says, \"to marry\r\nheedlessly, nor to hurry the sacred ceremony as if it were to be\r\ngot rid of as soon as possible. Let the parties consult the padre,\r\nwho will learn if they are really disposed to marry. You Indians say\r\nthe male naturally runs after the female and obtains her consent\r\n(an Indian proverb); but this is not decorous; the proper mode of\r\ncourting is for the priest to say, 'Will you be the spouse of ----,\r\naccording to the arrangements of our holy mother Church?' This is first\r\nto be asked of the woman, and then an inquiry is to be made of the man\r\nwhether he will have the woman, and the ancient and immodest usages of\r\npast times must then be abandoned.\" In the same spirit is the common\r\nsaying of the Indians, \"Savangmatovir ang ihinahatol nang mañga padre\"\r\n(The counsels of the padre are always right). And again--\"There is\r\nno Christian road but through the Roman Catholic Church.\"\r\n\r\nF. de los Santos says there is no instance of a Tagála woman making\r\nadvances in the way of marriage, nor of a father or mother looking out\r\na bridegroom for their daughter; that it would be a great affront were\r\nany girl to seek the favour of the person whom she wished to be her\r\nmother-in-law in order to win the son. No woman was ever heard to say,\r\n\"Manciganguin mo aco\" (Make me thy daughter-in-law).\r\n\r\nThe same friar asserts that the Indians have learnt the meaning\r\nwhich the Europeans attach to \"horns,\" and that the corresponding\r\nTagál word sungayan (horned animal) cannot be used indiscreetly\r\nwithout giving great offence. He is very angry with the nonsense\r\n(boberias and disparates) which he says the natives address to their\r\nchildren. A mother will call her babe father, and mother, and aunt,\r\nand even king and queen, sir and madam, with other extravagant and\r\nunbecoming outbreaks of affection, which he reproves as altogether\r\nblameworthy and intolerable.\r\n\r\nThough there is some variety in the houses of the Indians, according\r\nto their opulence, they preserve a common character, having bamboo\r\nfloors, nipa roofs, and wooden pillars to support them. A speculation\r\nwas entered into near Manila to provide more comfortable domestic\r\naccommodation for the natives by introducing imported improvements;\r\nbut the houses were unoccupied, and the adventure proved a losing\r\none. I have seen handsome lamps suspended from the roofs, and pictures\r\nhung upon the walls, of some of the Indian dwellings; while among\r\nthe mestizos many aspire to all the decorations of Spanish luxury,\r\ncompeting with the richest among the European settlers. But religious\r\nornaments are never forgotten, such as images and pictures of the\r\nVirgin and her child, vessels for holy water and crucifixes.\r\n\r\nThe beds of the Indians are merely mats on which the whole family\r\nrepose indiscriminately. Here they smoke their cigars, chew their\r\nbetel, and fall asleep. The domestic utensils are \"a mortar for\r\ngrinding rice, bamboos for all purposes, cup and spoons of the\r\ncocoa-nut shell, pots and kettles, a knife called a goloc, a bench\r\nagainst the wall, a stool which serves for a table, a Chinese basin\r\nfor oil, a clay lamp, some cotton wicks, torches of the resin-cane,\r\nan image of the Virgin, a crucifix, mats, a jar of betel leaves,\r\nsome areca nuts and lime ready for use, and sometimes a flute or\r\nguitar.\"--(Buzeta.)\r\n\r\nThe Indians have a very vague idea of distance. Tahanan and\r\nBitañgan are the names given to places of rest between different\r\nlocalities. Instead of the Spanish word league, they say \"taval,\" which\r\nis the distance an ordinary burthen can be carried without stoppage.\r\n\r\nThe forty days' labour which is exacted every year from the Indians is\r\ncalled atag or bayani. This is in addition to the tributo of a dollar\r\nand one-third; but exemption from the atag may be obtained by the\r\npayment of three dollars. The tribute is called bovis or buvis. \"Buvis\r\naco sa balañgay ni covan' (I am tributary to such and such a balangay).\r\n\r\nA curious illustration of the passion for gaming, so general among\r\nthe Filipinos, is given by the statistical commission, in the report\r\non Binondo. Among the not prohibited games is that called by the\r\nnatives Panguingui. It is played with six packs of cards, and five\r\nor six persons make a party. This game is most popular among all\r\nclasses. The authorities prohibit its being played during the hours\r\nof labour, but it is permitted from twelve to two P.M., and from\r\nsunset to ten P.M., on ordinary days, and there is no restriction on\r\nfestival days. The commission determined to visit without notice the\r\ndifferent tables where the game was played; they found on an average\r\n200 tables occupied, but there were 39 ready for play unoccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Players    at the 200 tables, 867 men and 313 women.\r\n       Spectators at the 200 tables, 405 men and 353 women.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis did not include the tables in private houses, to which the\r\ncommission had no access. It is to be presumed that these visits took\r\nplace during the authorised hour of play, but this is not stated by\r\nthe commission.\r\n\r\nThough games of hazard are prohibited to the multitude, the great game\r\nof the lottery is monthly played for the profit of the government\r\nand the perdition of the people. Its existence and its temptations\r\nencourage that gambling passion which is one of the greatest plagues of\r\nthe Filipinos. The newspapers are constantly occupied with long lists\r\nof persons condemned to heavy fines and imprisonments for indulging\r\nin what may be called the besetting sin of the Indians, from which,\r\nhowever, neither mestizos, Chinese nor Europeans are by any means free.\r\n\r\nBut the passion for play is most strikingly and universally exhibited\r\nin the cock-fights, so characteristic that I can scarcely avoid\r\nentering upon some details.\r\n\r\nA writer on the Philippines, after showing the antiquity of\r\ncock-fighting, and tracing its history through most of the civilized\r\nnations of the world, thus concludes:--\"In Spain there is a notable\r\naffection for cock-fights, and great is the care with which the birds\r\nare trained to the combat. In America this amusement is a dominant\r\npassion, and the Filipinos are not a whit behind the Americans. Nay,\r\nhere the passion is a delirium, and no law can check the number or the\r\nduration of the fights, accompanied by slaughter of the combatants,\r\nwhich may be well called perfidious\" (i.e. in violation of protecting\r\nregulations). \"In other places they sharpen the spurs of the cocks. In\r\nthe Philippines they are armed with razors, and chance more than skill\r\ndecides the contest. Every day countless numbers perish, but the race\r\nis not diminished. There is hardly a locality which has not more cocks\r\nthan human inhabitants. On the Puente Grande of Manila, at between\r\nfour and five A.M., hundreds and hundreds of 'the shrill clarions' are\r\nheard on all sides, and from vast distances; it is a string of signals\r\npassed from mouth to mouth, from the port of Bangui, in North Ilocos,\r\nto Manog, the southernmost point of Albay. There are cocks in every\r\nhouse, at every corner, at the foot of every tree, along the quays\r\nand shores, on the prows of every coasting ship, and, as if the living\r\nwere not enough, they are sculptured, they are painted and charcoaled\r\n(not artistically) on every wall for public admiration, and public\r\nadmiration recognizes the portraiture, though the information is not\r\nplaced there--as by the painter of old--to announce, 'This is a cock.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of an advertisement from a Manila\r\nnewspaper:--\"Principal Cock-fight of Tondo.--The subscriber informs the\r\npublic that on all cock-fighting days a great crowd from all parts,\r\nnearly half of them Chinese, attend, so that on a single day there\r\nare from 90 to 100 combats, and this not only from the convenience of\r\nthe place, which is made of tiles, but because the doubloons (onzas)\r\nwhich circulate there are honest doubloons (son de recibo).--Dalmacio\r\nOligario.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is considered a discourtesy to touch an Indian's game-cock,\r\nand permission is always asked to examine a favourite bird. He is\r\nthe object of many a caress; he eats, crows, and sleeps in the arms\r\nof his master; and, whatever else may be forgotten, the cock is in\r\ncontinual remembrance. I have found him celebrated in verse in terms\r\nthe most affectionate. A cock that has been frequently victorious\r\nis subjected to the most minute criticism, in order to discover by\r\nexternal marks what may serve to characterize his merits. The scales\r\nof his legs are counted, their form and distribution, the bent of the\r\nrings on the spurs, and whether the two spurs resemble each other;\r\nthe shape of the toes and their nails, the number and colours of the\r\nwing-feathers (eleven being the favourite quantity); white eyes are\r\npreferred to chesnut; a short comb falling over the eye and beak is a\r\nrecommendation. Cocks of different colours bear different names--white,\r\nputi; red, pula; white with black spots, talisain; red body and black\r\ntail and wings, bulic or taguiguin; black, casilien, or maitin; black\r\nand white, binabay; ash-colour, abuen; black and white, having black\r\nlegs, tagaguin; and many others. The wild cock is called labuyo.\r\n\r\nOf cock-fighting I translate Buzeta's description:--\"The Indians have\r\nan inveterate passion for the sport, which occupies the first place in\r\ntheir amusements. The cock is the first object of their care, their\r\ngeneral companion, which accompanies them even to the church-door,\r\nand is fastened to a bamboo plug outside, when they enter for the\r\nservice of the mass. For no money will they dispose of a favourite\r\nbird. Some possess as many as half-a-dozen of these inappreciable\r\ntreasures, for whose service they seem principally to live.\r\n\r\n\"Every pueblo has its gallera, or amphitheatre, for the cock-fights,\r\nfrom which the government draws a considerable revenue. The galleras\r\nare large buildings constructed of palm-trunks, bamboo, and nipa\r\nleaves, consisting of a hall, lighted from windows in the roof. In the\r\ncentre is a stage, raised about five feet high, surrounded by bamboo\r\ngalleries, which are reached by the spectators, who pay according to\r\nthe adjacency and convenience of the seats. The gallera is generally\r\ncrowded. The Indian enters with his cock under his arm; he caresses the\r\nfavourite, places him on the ground, lifts him up again, smooths his\r\nfeathers, talks to him, blows his cigar-smoke over him, and, pressing\r\nhim to his breast, tells him to fight bravely. The cock generally crows\r\naloud in defiance and in pride. His rival appears, a sharpened spur,\r\nor rather two-edged knife, or razor, is fastened to the natural spur\r\nof the bird, and after being for some time presented to each other\r\nthe sign of combat is given, which is carried on with extraordinary\r\nexcitement, until an alguacil announces that the betting is closed. The\r\nannouncement is followed by universal silence. The owners of the\r\ncocks withdraw at another signal, and the combatants contemplate\r\neach other, their feathers agitated and erect; they bend their necks,\r\nshake their heads, and spring upon one another; the fight continues\r\nuntil one is mortally wounded and falls. The conqueror springs upon\r\nhim, and crows in token of victory; but it is not unusual for the\r\nwounded cock to rise and turn upon his victor. If the victor should\r\nfly (as is sometimes the case), he is condemned to ignominious death;\r\nhis feathers are plucked, and he is suspended almost naked on the\r\noutside of the gallera. The wounds of the living bird are staunched by\r\nan infusion of tobacco leaves in cocoa-nut wine. He becomes from that\r\nhour a favourite to be betted on, and if disabled for future frays,\r\nhe is carefully provided for by his master. There are cock-doctors\r\nand receiving-houses devoted to the healing of their wounds.\r\n\r\n\"In the neighbourhood of the gallera are stalls, where wines,\r\nsweetmeats, chocolate, and other refreshments, are sold, prepared by\r\nIndians and Chinese. A whole day is devoted to the combat, and even\r\nthe charms of the siesta are forgotten, and the Indian often returns\r\nto his home after sunset a wretched and a ruined man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were sometimes desirous that we should witness the\r\nexhibition, and brought their favourite cocks to be admired; but I\r\nhad little curiosity to witness such a display, picturesque as it\r\nwas no doubt--more picturesque than humane.\r\n\r\nDon Ildefonso de Aragon passes this severe judgment upon the\r\nsport:--\"Perpetual idlers,\" the Indians, \"they go from cockpit to\r\ncockpit, those universities of every vice, which the owners think\r\nthemselves privileged to keep constantly open and accessible; hence\r\nthey come forth consummate masters of roguery, jugglery, frauds, ready\r\nfor acts of violence in private and in public, in town and in country.\"\r\n\r\nKite-flying (introduced by the Chinese, among whom it is an amusement\r\nboth for young and old, and who have made their kites musical by\r\nday and illuminated by night) is popular in the Philippines, as are\r\nfire-balloons and other pyrotechnic displays.\r\n\r\nExcept on suitable occasions, the Indian is sober and economical,\r\nbut he makes great efforts at display when desirous of honouring\r\nhis guests. On two or three occasions we sat down to meals, which\r\na gastronomer would scarcely have ventured to criticise; a variety\r\nof wines, health-drinking, and even speech-making, music and firing\r\nof guns, accompanying the festivity. Smoking never fails to form a\r\npart of the entertainment; pure cigars of various sizes, and paper\r\ncigarritos, being always at hand. St. Andrew's day, kept in celebration\r\nof the delivery of the Philippines from piratical Chinese, is one of\r\ngreat rejoicing.\r\n\r\nIn religious ceremonies the Indian takes a busy part, and lends a\r\nvery active co-operation. When they take place after sunset, crowds\r\nattend with burning tapers. Gun-firing, music and illuminations\r\nare the general accompaniments of the great fiestas. I have more\r\nthan once mentioned the universality of the musical passion, which\r\nis easily trained to excellent performances. An Indian, we heard,\r\nwas not selected to the band unless he could play for eight hours\r\nwithout cessation. The national music of Spain is generally studied,\r\nand, in honour to us, in some places they learnt our \"God save the\r\nQueen!\" We were not hypercritical upon the first attempts, but such\r\ntributes from a race, that only sought to do our sovereign, our\r\ncountry, and ourselves all honour, could not but greatly gratify us.\r\n\r\nWhen at Guimbal (Iloilo), we were waited on at table wholly by Indian\r\nfemale children, prettily dressed; whose bright eyes expressed extreme\r\ncuriosity, and whose anxiety to understand and to administer to every\r\nwish was very charming. They were much pleased to exhibit the various\r\ngarments they wore of the piña cloth. I remarked one who went to the\r\nfriar, and whispered in his ear, \"But where are the golden garments\r\nof the general?\" meaning me, and the padre had to explain to the\r\nchildren that \"golden garments\" were only worn on State occasions,\r\nwhich did not seem satisfactory, as the occasion of our arrival in the\r\npueblo was one of unprecedented excitement and display. They crowded\r\nround me, however, and looked into my face, and expressed admiration\r\nat my long soft hair. Their associating finery with rank reminded me\r\nof a visit once paid me by a young Abyssinian prince, who was taken\r\nup the narrow staircase by some mistake of the servants, and who (his\r\ninterpreter told me) afterwards said to him, \"You told me I was to\r\nsee a great man--had ever a great man so small a staircase?\" At his\r\nnext visit, he was conducted through the principal portals up the\r\nwide marble steps of the house in which I lived, and he expressed\r\nextreme satisfaction, and said, \"Ah! this is as it should be.\"\r\n\r\nA few of the Indians reach the dignity of the priesthood, but they\r\nare generally asistentes to the friars. I have heard from the lips\r\nof Indian priests as pure Castilian as that spoken in Madrid.\r\n\r\n\"I have observed,\" says Father Diaz, \"that the word of an Indian is\r\nmore to be trusted when he uses one of the ancient forms of speech,\r\nsuch as 'totoo nang totoo' (it is as true as truth, or, it is truly\r\ntrue), than when called on to take a solemn oath in the name of God\r\nor of the cross.\" A youth always seeks to get the promise of his\r\nsweetheart made according to the old Tagál usage, and it is held as\r\nthe best security of veracity in all the relations of life.\r\n\r\nMany of the padres complain that, notwithstanding all the religious\r\ninstruction given, the taint of idolatry still exists among the\r\nconverted Indians. There is a sort of worship of ancestors which\r\nis seen in many forms. They attach to the word nono (forefather) the\r\nsame spiritual meaning which the Chinese give to Kwei. These nonos are\r\noften addressed in prayer, in order to bring down blessings or to avert\r\ncalamities. If an Indian gather a flower or fruit, he silently asks\r\nleave of the nono. Certain spots, woods and rivers, he never passes\r\nwithout an invocation to these departed genii. Pardon is asked for\r\nshort-comings or actions of doubtful character. There is a disease\r\ncalled pamoao which is attributed to the influence of the nonos,\r\nto whom petitions and sacrifices are offered to obtain relief. These\r\nidolatries, says one of the friars, are so deeply rooted and so widely\r\nspread as to demand the utmost vigilance for their extirpation.\r\n\r\nSo, again, they have their native devil, in the shape of a little black\r\nold man, a wild horse, or monster. As a protection against this fiend,\r\nhowever, they apply to their rosary, which certainly affords evidence\r\nthat he is an orthodox demon of whom the padres cannot fairly complain.\r\n\r\nWitches and witchery are called in to discover thieves and to\r\nunbewitch bewitched persons; but scapularies and saints, especially\r\nSt. Anthony of Padua, are auxiliaries in undoing the mischiefs menaced\r\nor done. The cauldrons of the weird sisters in Macbeth would find\r\ncounterparts among the people of the Philippine Islands, but there\r\nmust be a mingling of Christian texts and Catholic superstitions to\r\ncomplete the identity. One author says these incantations are used for\r\nthe attainment of riches, beautiful wives, success in battle, escape\r\nfrom justice, and other objects of desire. Father Ortiz will have it\r\nthat the secrets of these supernatural influences are treasured up in\r\nvarious manuscript works \"which ought to be burned.\" Their preservation\r\nand publication (if they exist) would be more serviceable, because\r\nmore instructive, to mankind.\r\n\r\nIndian women are seldom seen without some religious ornaments. They\r\nhave rosaries of corals or pearl beads, medals of copper or gold,\r\nhaving figures of Our Lady of Mexico or Guadalupe. The scapulary\r\nis generally found hanging by the rosary. Many of the Indians are\r\nassociated in the Cofradias, whose different emblems they preserve\r\nwith great veneration; such as St. Augustine's string, St. Francis'\r\ncord, St. Thomas's belt; but they also hang upon their children's\r\nnecks crocodiles' teeth as a preservative against disease.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Indian name for God was Bathala, to whom they attributed\r\nthe creation of the world. Remnants of the old idolatry remain among\r\nthe people, and the names of some of the idols are preserved. A few\r\nphrases are still retained, especially in the remoter parts, as,\r\nfor example, \"Magpabathala ca\" (Let the will of Bathala be done),\r\nand the priests have been generally willing to recognize the name as\r\nnot objectionable in substitution for Dios. The Tagál word adopted for\r\nidolatry is Pagaanito, but to the worship of images they give the term\r\nAnito. I find among the records reference to an idol called Lacambui,\r\nprobably the god of eating, as the Spaniards call him Abogado de\r\nla Garganta (the throat-advocate). The idol Lacanpate was the god\r\nof the harvest, and was equally male and female; \"an hermaphrodite\r\ndevil,\" he is called by one of the friars. Linga was the god who cured\r\ndiseases. Lachan bacor protected the growing crops. Aman Sinaya was the\r\nfisherman's god, and was appealed to when the nets were cast. Ama ni\r\nCaable was the protector of huntsmen. An ill-famed idol named Tumano\r\nwas believed to wander about at night among human habitations; the\r\nIndians threw ashes upon him, and calling out, \"Iri, iri,\" he fled,\r\nbeing \"a cowardly devil.\" Mancucutor was the patron of a particular\r\nclass of Indians, but the traditions are very obscure.\r\n\r\nThere is a bird called by the natives Tigmamanoquin, and if, when they\r\nare going to a festival, this bird flies from the right to the left,\r\nit is considered of auspicious augury, but disastrous if it fly from\r\nthe left to the right. The bird (I know not its classical name) is\r\nnever killed by the Indians, but if caught it is set free with the\r\nwords, \"Hayona tigmamanoquin, lunchan mo nang halinging\" (Be gone,\r\nbird! and sing sweetly for me).\r\n\r\nThe Indians believe that a guardian angel is born at the birth of\r\nevery Christian child, to whose special care through life the infant\r\nis confided. In some parts this angel is called Catotobo, in others\r\nTagatanor. But the Tagáls habitually employ the Castilian words\r\nangel and angeles in the Catholic sense. I remember to have heard\r\na clever Dutchman say that Java was well governed by knowing how to\r\nuse properly two Arabic words--Islam (faith), which was never to be\r\ninterfered with; and Kismet (fate), under whose influence Mussulmans\r\ncheerfully submit to their destiny. The Santa Iglesia madre is the\r\ncharm by which the Philippines are ruled.\r\n\r\nThe Indian women are generally cleanly in their persons, using the\r\nbath very frequently, and constantly cleaning and brightening their\r\nblack and abundant hair, which they are fond of perfuming and tying\r\nin a knot behind, called the pusód, which is kept together by a small\r\ncomb and gilded needles, and is adorned with a fragrant flower. They\r\nare proud of their small foot, which the Chinese call golden lily,\r\nand which has a slipper, often embroidered with gold or silver,\r\njust supported by the toes. Their walk is graceful and somewhat\r\ncoquettish; they smoke, eat betel, and are rather given to display\r\na languid, liquid eye, for which they have an Indian expression,\r\n\"Mapuñgay na mata.\"\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Filipinos is simple enough. It consists of a shirt\r\nworn outside a pair of pantaloons; but the shirt is sometimes of\r\nconsiderable value, woven of the piña, handsomely embroidered, and\r\nof various colours, bright red being predominant. I asked an opulent\r\nIndian to show me his wardrobe, and he brought out twenty-five shirts,\r\nexhibiting them with great pride; there were among them some which\r\nmay have been worth a hundred dollars each. It is difficult to fix a\r\nlimit to the money value of the more exquisite specimens of weaving and\r\nembroidery. A small pocket handkerchief sent to the Queen of Spain is\r\nsaid to have cost five hundred dollars. One or two doubloons (onzas) of\r\ngold are asked for the pañuelos (kerchiefs) usually sold in the shops\r\nof the capital. The finest qualities are woven in the neighbourhood of\r\nIloilo. The loom is of the rudest and simplest construction; one woman\r\nthrows the shuttle, another looks after the threads. The cloth is sent\r\nto Manila to be embroidered. The women wear gowns of the fabrics of\r\nthe country, into which, of late, the silks of China and the coloured\r\nyarns of Lancashire have been introduced. The better-conditioned wear\r\nan embroidered shawl or kerchief of piña. This is the representative\r\nof female vanity or ambition. When we passed through the towns and\r\nvillages of the interior, a handsomely adorned piña handkerchief was\r\nthe flag that often welcomed us from the windows of the native huts,\r\nand sometimes the children bore them about and waved them before us\r\nin the processions with which they were wont to show their pleasure\r\nat our presence.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Indians is nearly the same throughout the islands; the\r\npantaloons of cotton or silk, white or striped with various colours,\r\ngirded round the waist with a kerchief, whose folds serve for pockets,\r\nand a shirt over the pantaloons of cotton. Sinamay (a native cloth),\r\nor piña for the more opulent, is universally employed. Straw hat or\r\nkerchief round the head; but the favourite covering is a huge circular\r\ncap like a large inverted punch-bowl, made generally of bamboo,\r\nbut sometimes of tortoise-shell, and having a metal spike or other\r\nornament at the top; it is fitted to the head by an internal frame,\r\nand fastened by a ribbon under the chin. This salacot is used by many\r\nas a protection against sun and rain; it appeared to me too heavy to\r\nbe convenient.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indian women the opulent wear costly embroidered garments\r\nof piña, and many of them possess valuable jewels, and are decorated\r\non occasions of festivity with earrings, necklaces and bracelets\r\nof pearls, diamonds and other precious stones. A few of them speak\r\nSpanish, and during our visits became the interpreters for the others,\r\nas the Indian women generally took a part in the graceful but simple\r\nceremonials which marked our progress; sometimes forming a line\r\nthrough the towns and villages, and waving many-coloured flags\r\nover us as we passed, escorted by the native bands of music. In\r\nsome families the garments which were worn a century ago are still\r\npreserved. Many of the petty authorities are the hereditary possessors\r\nof local rank, and on grand occasions make displays of the costumes of\r\ntheir forefathers. There is some variety in the mode of dressing the\r\nhair. The Tagálas clean it with lemon juice, and employ cocoa-nut oil\r\nmade fragrant by infusions of odoriferous flowers. They clean their\r\nhands with pumice-stone. In many parts the thumbnail of the right hand\r\nis allowed by both sexes to grow to a great length, which assists\r\nplaying on the guitar, and divers domestic operations. The under\r\ngarments of the women are tightened at the waist, and their camisas\r\nhave long and wide sleeves, which are turned back upon the arms, and\r\nembroidered in more or less costly taste. They all chew the areca,\r\nand, as age advances, they blacken their eyebrows and wear false hair\r\nlike their patrician mistresses. They sometimes paint their nails\r\nwith vermilion, and to be entitled a Castila, which means European,\r\nis recognized as a great compliment.\r\n\r\nRice is the ordinary food of the Indians. It is boiled for half an\r\nhour, and then called canin. The capsicum, or chile, is used for a\r\ncondiment. They eat three meals a day, out of a large dish, helping\r\nthemselves with their fingers, and sometimes using a plantain leaf\r\nfor a plate. They also have sauces round the central dish, into which\r\nthey dip the canin. They introduce the thumb first into the mouth,\r\nand very dexterously employ the fingers to push forward the food. The\r\nluxuries of the native are pretty nearly reduced to the cigar and\r\nthe betel-nut. Indeed these can scarcely be called luxuries; they are\r\nmore necessary to him than his simple food, which consists generally\r\nof boiled rice, sometimes flavoured with fish or vegetables, and his\r\nsweetmeat the sugar-cane. As he obtains his cigarritos at the estanco\r\nfor less than two cuertos a dozen, and can make them, or buy them from\r\na contrabandista, at not even half that price, and as the cost of the\r\nareca is extremely small, his wants and his enjoyments are easily and\r\ncheaply supplied. His garments are few and economical, and such as in\r\nmost parts of the islands are supplied by the rude family loom; but\r\nthe source of his ruin is in his gallo and his passion for play, to\r\nwhich nine-tenths of the miseries of the Indian are to be traced. Out\r\nof his embarrassments the Chinaman makes his profit, buying the labour\r\nof the indebted and extorting its maximum with coarse and often cruel\r\ntyranny. The Chinese have a proverb that the Indian must be led with\r\nrice in the left hand of his master and a bamboo in the right.\r\n\r\nThere is in some of the islands abundance of deer and wild boars; they\r\nare killed by arrows of two kinds--one barbed with a clove from the\r\nwild palm, shot direct; another with an iron head, shot upwards and\r\nfalling down upon the animal. The Indians make a dry venison (called\r\ntapa) of the flesh and send it to the Manila market. Much wild fowl\r\nis found in the forest, especially of the gallinaceous species. The\r\nBisayan caves are frequented by the swallows which produce the edible\r\nbird's-nests, and which are collected by the natives for exportation\r\nto China.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of Indians get their living by the fisheries. The fish\r\nmost esteemed is the sabalo, which is only found in the Taal Lake,\r\nwhose water is fresh and flows into the sea. In the centre of the\r\nlake is an island, with its always burning volcano. At the season\r\nwhen the sabalo quit the lake for the sea, an estocade of bamboos is\r\nerected across the river, the top of which does not reach the surface\r\nof the water; three or four yards below, another estocade is placed,\r\nraised five or six feet above the surface, and the two estocades are\r\nunited by a bamboo platform. The fish leap over the first barrier,\r\nand fall on the platform, where they are caught: some of them are\r\nas large as salmon. The Bay Lake is celebrated for the curbina, an\r\nexcellent fish. By the banks of the river enormous nets are seen,\r\nwhich are sunk and raised by a machinery of bamboo, and the devices\r\nemployed for the capture of fish are various and singular. In the\r\nBisayans the Indians make faggots, which they kindle, and, walking\r\non the banks with a spear in their right hand, the fish approach the\r\nlight and are harpooned and flung upon the shore. I understand the\r\nsea-slug, which the Indians call balate, is thus captured. It is a\r\nwell-known delicacy among the Chinese. Turtle are caught by watching\r\ntheir approach (the watcher being concealed) and simply turning them on\r\ntheir backs when they are at a certain distance from the water. Native\r\ndivers bring up the mother-of-pearl oyster, but the pearl fishery\r\nis not of much importance. These divers also discover the enormous\r\nshell-fish which serve as receptacles for holy water in the churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPOPULATION--RACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the far greater number of the pagan Indians, as they are called\r\nby the Spaniards, belong to the same races as those who inhabit the\r\ntowns, there are many exceptional cases. Independent and separated\r\nfrom the pagans, there are numerous Mahomedans, especially in the\r\nisland of Mindanao, of which only a small tract along the coast has\r\nbeen subjected by the Spaniards; these, whom the Spaniards designate\r\nas Moros, a name to which traditional and national associations attach\r\ngreat abhorrence, are probably of Malayan descent. There, as in every\r\nregion where missionaries have sought to undermine or depreciate the\r\nauthority of the Koran, the attempt has wholly failed. I saw some of\r\nthese people at Zamboanga, and found them familiar with the Arabic\r\nformula of Islamism, and that many of their names, such as Abdallah,\r\nFatima, and others, were such as are common to the Mussulmans. They\r\nare understood to be in amity with the Spaniards, who have treaties\r\nwith the reigning Sultan; but I found no evidence of their recognition\r\nof Spanish authority.\r\n\r\nThe enmity between the Mahomedan races (Moros) and the Spaniards may\r\nbe deemed hereditary. The answer given by the Rajah Soliman of Tondo\r\nto Legaspi, the first governor of the Philippines, who solicited his\r\nfriendship, is characteristic:--\"Not until the sun is cut in two,\r\nnot until I seek the hatred instead of the love of woman, will I be\r\nthe friend of a Castila\" (Spaniard).\r\n\r\nLiving in the remotest mountainous regions of Mindanao, never, I\r\nbelieve, explored by European adventurers, there is a race in the\r\nvery lowest stages of barbarism, I cannot say of civilization, for\r\nof that they present no trace. They are said to wear no garments,\r\nto build no houses, to dress no food. They wander in the forest,\r\nwhose wild fruits they gather by day, and sleep among the branches\r\nof the trees by night. They have no form of government, no chief,\r\nno religious rites or usages. I saw one of the race who was brought\r\nfor sale as any wild animal might have been to the governor of\r\nZamboanga. He refused to purchase, but retained the lad, who was\r\napparently of about eight or nine years of age. At Iloilo, he was\r\nwaiting, with other native servants, at table, and he appeared to\r\nme the most sprightly and intelligent of the whole--bright-eyed,\r\nand watching eagerly every sign and mandate of his master. He was\r\nvery dark-coloured, almost black; his hair disposed to be woolly; he\r\nhad neither the high cheeks nor the thick lips of the African negro,\r\nbut resembled many specimens I have seen of the Madagascar people. I\r\nwas informed that the whole tribe--but the word is not appropriate,\r\nfor they are not gregarious--are of very small stature; that they avoid\r\nall intercourse with other races, collect nothing, barter nothing, and,\r\nin fact, want nothing. I had once occasion to examine in the prison of\r\nKandy (Ceylon) one of the real \"wild men of the woods\" of that island,\r\nwho had been convicted for murder; the moral sense was so unawakened,\r\nthat it was obvious no idea of wrong was associated with the act,\r\nand the judge most properly did not consider, him a responsible being\r\non whom he could inflict the penalties of the law. There was little\r\nresemblance between the Filipino and the Cingalese in any external\r\ncharacteristic. Ethnological science would be greatly advanced if\r\ndirected to the special study of the barbarous aboriginal races of whom\r\nspecimens yet remain, but of which so many have wholly disappeared,\r\nwho can have had no intercourse with each other. I believe there\r\nare more varieties of the human family than have hitherto been\r\nrecognized by physiologists, amongst whom no affinity of language\r\nwill be found. The theories current as to the derivation of the many\r\nvarieties of the human race from a few primitive types will not bear\r\nexamination. Civilization and education will modify the character\r\nof the skull, and the differences between the crania of the same\r\npeople are so great as to defy any general law of classification. The\r\nfarther back we are enabled to go, the greater will be the distinction\r\nof types and tongues; and it will be seen that the progress of time\r\nand commerce and knowledge and colonization, has annihilated many an\r\nindependent idiom, as it has destroyed many an aboriginal race.\r\n\r\nAgainst the wilder savages who inhabit the forests and mountains\r\nof the interior, expeditions are not unfrequently directed by the\r\ngovernment, especially when there has been any molestation to the\r\nnative Christian population. Their chiefs are subjected to various\r\npunishments, and possession is taken of their villages and strongholds;\r\nbut these are not always permanently held, from the insufficiency of\r\nmilitary force to retain them. But it is clear that these rude tribes\r\nmust ultimately be extinguished by the extension of cultivation and\r\nthe pressure of a higher civilization.\r\n\r\nDe Mas lays down as a principle that the Igorrotes of Luzon are\r\nheathens of the same race as the converted Indians, but in a savage\r\nstate. The Aetas, or Negritos, are a separate race, not indigenous, but\r\nthe descendants of invaders and conquerors. He had many opportunities\r\nof intercourse with them, and speaks favourably of his reception among\r\nthem. The men had no other covering than a belt of bark fibres, the\r\nwomen a sort of petticoat of the same texture. Unmarried girls wore\r\na species of collar made from the leaves of a mountain palm, whose\r\nends met between their naked breasts. The females played on a rude\r\nguitar, the case being a piece of bamboo, with three strings from the\r\nroots of a tree, and which they tuned by tightening or loosening with\r\ntheir left hand. When it rained, they covered themselves with large\r\npalm-leaves, which they also used as shelter from the sun. He says\r\nthey resisted all attempts upon their chastity. They brought wax,\r\nhoney and deer, and sought for tobacco and rice in exchange. For\r\nmoney they cared not. The mode of showing respect is to offer water\r\nto the superior--no son can accept it from, but must hand it to, his\r\nfather. They exhibit much fear of the evil spirits that are in the\r\nforests, but all information they gave was at secondhand. They had\r\nnot seen the spirits, but others had, and there was no doubt about\r\nthat. The friars report them to be short lived--their age seldom\r\nexceeding forty years. Father Mozo says: \"They have their localities,\r\nin which they group themselves and which they unwillingly leave:\r\nfixed abodes they have none, but shift from place to place within a\r\ncircumference of four to five leagues. They drive four rough sticks\r\ninto the ground, surround them with the flexible branches of the ylib,\r\nfling down some palm-leaves, bring in a piece of wood for a pillow,\r\nand have their house and bed ready. The game killed by one belongs\r\nto all--the head and neck being thrown to the dogs. The community\r\nordinarily consists of twenty to twenty-five persons, who select the\r\nmost courageous of their number as chief. In the summer they locate\r\nthemselves on the banks of rivers, but during the rainy and windy\r\nseasons they confine themselves to their rude huts. If a death take\r\nplace, they bury the corpse, but flee from the locality, lest others be\r\nsummoned away. When they seek wild honey in the woods, the finder of\r\na swarm marks the tree where the bees are, and the property is deemed\r\nhis own until he has time to return and remove the comb. A fire is\r\nlighted at the foot of the tree--the smoke drives away the bees--the\r\nIndian mounts, bearing a broad palm-leaf folded in the shape of a vase,\r\ninto which he turns the honey-comb, ties it over, and descends. All\r\nhis wants are supplied when, in addition to his matches for fire,\r\nhis bow and arrows, and his rude cutlass, he has a small supply of\r\ntobacco for his luxury. If food be scarce, he drinks hot water and ties\r\na cord tightly round his body; he eats also of a root called sucbao,\r\nbut in the warm weather indigenous fruits are never wanting.\" After\r\na string of quotations from the classics, illustrating the pains,\r\npenalties and passions of civilized existence, with the serenity,\r\nstupidity and satisfaction of these children of nature, the padre says:\r\n\"Finally, in admiration of their manner of life, if they were but\r\nenlightened by our holy faith--if they only suffered what they suffer\r\nfor the sake of God--I verily believe they would not be paralleled by\r\nthe austerest monk of the Thebaïd. True it is they commit the sin of\r\ndivorce--true it is that a slip before marriage is seldom heard of;\r\nbut they are cruel, they are murderers!\" Such is the consistency of\r\necclesiastical judgment.\r\n\r\nThere are many speculations as to the origin of the darker, or\r\nblack races, who now occupy the northern and central mountainous and\r\nlittle visited regions, and from whom one of the islands, Negros,\r\ntakes its name. They principally dwell in the wilder part of the\r\nprovinces of Ilocos South, Pangasinan, Cagayan, and Nueva Ecija. They\r\nare of small stature, have somewhat flattened noses, curled hair,\r\nare agile, have no other dress than a covering of bark over their\r\ngenitals, are dexterous hunters, have no fixed dwellings, but sleep\r\nwherever sunset finds them. Their whole property consists of their\r\nbow, a bamboo quiver and arrows, a strip of skin of the wild boar, and\r\nthe girdle, which the Spaniards call the tapa rabo (tail cover). The\r\nNegritos are held to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands,\r\nwhich were invaded by those now called Indios, who much resemble,\r\nthough they are a great improvement on, the Malayan race. The Negritos\r\nretired into the wilder districts as the Tagáls advanced, but between\r\nthe two races there exists a great intensity of hatred. The Negritos\r\nare the savages of the Philippines, and are divided into many tribes,\r\nand it is said every grade between cannibalism and the civilization of\r\nthe Indian is found among them. They generally live on the wild fruits\r\nand vegetables which grow spontaneously, though some cultivate rice,\r\nand attend to the irrigation of their fields. Some make iron weapons,\r\nand the Itaneg, according to the friars, only want conversion to be in\r\nall respects equal to the Indios. This race has a mixture of Chinese\r\nblood, the Ifugaos of that of the Japanese. The ruder savages ornament\r\ntheir cabins with the skulls of their enemies. The Apayos live in\r\ncomfortable houses, and employ for floors polished planks instead of\r\nthe interwoven bamboos of the Tagáls. They carry on a trade in wax,\r\ncocoa and tobacco, and deck their dwellings with China earthenware. The\r\nIsinay Negritos profess Christianity. In the island of Luzon there are\r\nestimated to be 200,000 heathens, in that of Mindanao 800,000 idolators\r\nand Mussulmans. But it is impossible to follow out the mixed races in\r\nall their ramifications and peculiarities. Among the characteristics\r\nof the wilder races is the separation of the toes, which enables them\r\nto pick up even minute objects, so if they let anything fall they use\r\nfoot or hand with equal facility; they will descend head downwards\r\nthe rigging of a ship, holding on with their feet; the great toe is\r\nmuch more separated from the others than in the white races. Their\r\nsense of smelling is exquisite, and they profess, without the aid of\r\nlanguage, to discover the state of the affections from the breath.\r\n\r\nThough they have a pantheon of gods and goddesses (for most of their\r\ndivinities have wives), they have no temples, and no rites of public\r\nworship. They consult soothsayers (usually old women) in their diseases\r\nand difficulties; and there are sacrifices, outpouring and mingling\r\nof blood, libations of fermented liquors, violent gesticulations,\r\nand invocations to Cambunian (God), the moon, and the stars, and the\r\nceremonials end with eating and drinking to excess. They sacrifice a\r\npig to pacify the Deity when it thunders, and adore the rainbow after\r\nthe storm. Before a journey they kindle a fire, and if the smoke do not\r\nblow in the direction they intend to take they delay their project. The\r\nflight of birds is watched as an important augury, and the appearance\r\nof a snake as a warning against some approaching calamity.\r\n\r\nThe mountain tribes are subject to no common ruler, but have their\r\nseparate chieftains, called barnaas, to whom a certain number of\r\ndependants is assigned. On the death of a barnaas, the intestines are\r\nextracted, examined and burnt, for the purpose of ascertaining by the\r\narts of divination the future destiny of the tribe. The body is placed\r\nin a chair, relations and friends are invited, and a great festivity\r\nof eating and drinking provided from the flocks and rice-fields\r\nof the deceased, with shouts and songs celebrating the virtues of\r\ndeparted barnaas. The banquet closes with all species of excesses,\r\nand both sexes remain drunk, exhausted or asleep on the ground about\r\nthe corpse. It is said that the flesh of the departed is distributed\r\namong the guests, and Buzeta avers that such a case lately occurred\r\nat Tagudin (Ilocos South); but as he attributes it to the poverty\r\nof the deceased who had not left behind wherewithal to provide for\r\nthe festival, the carnal distribution could hardly have been deemed\r\nan honour. The stories of the cannibalism of the natives must be\r\nreceived with distrust, there being a great disposition to represent\r\nthem as worse savages than they really are. The arms of a warrior are\r\ngathered together after his death, and his family will not part with\r\nthem. A vessel into which wine has been poured is placed at the foot\r\nof the trophies, in order that it may imbibe the virtue and valour\r\nof the departed, and obtain his auspices.\r\n\r\nIn case of the murder of an individual, the whole of the tribe unite\r\nto revenge his death. Prisoners taken in war are made slaves, and sell\r\nfor from ten to twenty-five dollars each. Old men are bought, upon whom\r\nto try the poisonous powers or sharpness of their weapons. Adultery\r\nand the third offence of robbery are punished with death. Polygamy\r\nis not allowed, but there is no difficulty about divorce.\r\n\r\nA great variety of languages is to be found among the wild people\r\nof the interior; not only are dialects of the various tribes\r\nunintelligible to each other, but sometimes a language is confined to\r\na single family group. Where there has been no intercourse there is\r\nno similitude. Words are necessary to man, and language is created by\r\nthat necessity. Hence the farther the study of idioms is pursued back\r\ninto antiquity, the greater will their number be found. Civilization\r\nhas destroyed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of idioms, and is still\r\ncarrying on the work by diminishing the number of languages in which\r\nman holds intercourse with man. It is no bold prophecy to aver that\r\nin the course of centuries the number of separate tongues will be\r\nreduced to a small amount. In France, the French; in Italy, the Tuscan;\r\nin Spain, the Castilian; in Germany, the Saxon; in Great Britain,\r\nthe English;--are becoming the predominant languages of the people,\r\nand have been gradually superseding the multitude of idioms which\r\nwere used only a few generations ago. Adelung recorded the names of\r\nnearly 4,000 spoken and existing languages, but a list of those which\r\ntime has extinguished would be far more extensive.\r\n\r\nThat such large portions of the islands should be held by independent\r\ntribes, whether heathen or Mahomedan, is not to be wondered at when\r\nthe geographical character of the country is considered. Many of\r\ntheir retreats are inaccessible to beasts of burden; the valleys are\r\nintolerably hot; the mountains unsheltered and cold. There is also\r\nmuch ignorance as to the localities, and the Spaniards are subject to\r\nbe surprised from unknown ambushes in passes and ravines. The forests,\r\nthrough which the natives glide like rabbits, are often impenetrable\r\nto Europeans. No attempts have succeeded in enticing the \"idolaters\"\r\ndown to the plains from these woods and mountains, to be tutored, taxed\r\nand tormented. Yet it is a subject of complaint that these barbarians\r\ninterfere, as no doubt they do, with the royal monopoly of tobacco,\r\nwhich they manage to smuggle into the provinces. \"Fiscal officers\r\nand troops,\" says De Mas, \"are stationed to prevent these abuses,\r\nbut these protectors practise so many extortions on the Indians,\r\nand cause so much of discontent, that commissions of inquiry become\r\nneedful, and the difficulties remain unsolved.\" In some places the\r\nidolaters molest \"the peaceful Christian population,\" and make the\r\nroads dangerous to travellers. De Mas has gathered information from\r\nvarious sources, and from him I shall select a few particulars; but it\r\nappears to me there is too much generalization as to the unsubjugated\r\ntribes, who are to be found in various stages of civilization and\r\nbarbarism. The Tinguianes of Ilocos cultivate extensive rice-fields,\r\nhave large herds of cattle and horses, and carry on a considerable\r\ntrade with the adjacent Christian population. The Chinese type is said\r\nto be traceable in this race. The women wear a number of bracelets,\r\ncovering the arm from the wrist to the elbow. The heaviest Tinguian\r\ncurse is, \"May you die while asleep,\" which is equivalent to saying,\r\n\"May your death-bed be uncelebrated.\" It is a term of contempt for\r\nan Indian to say to another, \"Malubha ang Caitiman mo\"--Great is thy\r\nblackness (negregura, Sp.). The Indians call Africans Pogot.\r\n\r\nThere are many Albinos in the Philippines. They are called by the\r\nnatives Sons of the Sun; some are white, some are spotted, and others\r\nhave stripes on their skins. They are generally of small intellectual\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nBuzeta gives the following ethnological table, descriptive of the\r\nphysical characteristics of the various races of the Philippines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n              PURE INDIANS.

The Gaddans give the name of Amanolay, meaning Creator of Man,\r\nto the object of their worship, and his goddess is Dalingay. There\r\nare no temples nor public rites, but appeals to the superior spirits\r\nin cases of urgency are generally directed by the female priest or\r\nsorceress, who sprinkles the idol with the blood of a buffalo, fowl\r\nor guinea-pig, offers libations, while the Indians lift up their hands\r\nexclaiming, \"Siggam Cabunian! Siggam Bulamaiag! Siggam aggen!\" (O thou\r\nGod! O thou beautiful moon! O thou star!) A brush is then dipped in\r\npalm wine, which is sprinkled over the attendants. (This is surely\r\nan imitation of Catholic aspersions.) A general carousing follows.\r\n\r\nThe priests give many examples of what they call Indian ignorance and\r\nstupidity, but these examples generally amount only to a disclaimer\r\nof all knowledge respecting the mysteries of creation, the origin\r\nand future destiny of man, the nature of religious obligations, and\r\nthe dogmas of the Catholic faith. It may be doubted whether the mere\r\nhabitual repetition of certain formulas affords more satisfactory\r\nevidence of Christian advancement than the openly avowed ignorance\r\nof these heathen races.\r\n\r\nIf an Indian is murdered by one of a neighbouring tribe, and the\r\noffence not condoned by some arranged payment, it is deemed an\r\nobligation on the part of the injured to retaliate by killing one of\r\nthe offending tribe.\r\n\r\nThe popular amusement is dancing; they form themselves into a circle,\r\nstretching out their hands, using their feet alternately, leaping on\r\none and lifting the other behind; so they move round and round with\r\nloud cries to the sounds of cylindrical drums struck by both hands.\r\n\r\nThe skulls of animals are frequently used for the decoration of\r\nthe houses of the Indians. Galvey says he counted in one dwelling,\r\nin Capangar, 405 heads of buffaloes and bullocks, and more than a\r\nthousand of pigs, causing an intolerable stench.\r\n\r\nThey use the bark of the Uplay in cases of intermittent fever, and have\r\nmuch knowledge of the curative qualities of certain herbs; they apply\r\nhot iron to counteract severe local pain, so that the flesh becomes\r\ncauterized; but they almost invariably have recourse to amulets or\r\ncharms, and sacrifice fowls and animals, which are distributed among\r\nthe attendants on the sick persons.\r\n\r\nPadre Mozo says of the Italons (Luzon) that he has seen them, after\r\nmurdering an enemy, drink his blood, cut up the lungs, the back of\r\nthe head, the entrails, and other parts of the body, which they eat\r\nraw, avowing that it gave them courage and spirit in war. The skulls\r\nare kept in their houses to be exhibited on great occasions. This\r\ncustom is probably of Bornean origin, for Father Quarteron, the vicar\r\napostolic of that island, told me that he once fell in with a large\r\nnumber of savages who were carrying in procession the human skulls\r\nwith which their houses were generally adorned, and which they called\r\n\"giving an airing to their enemies.\" The teeth are inserted in the\r\nhandles of their hangers. After enumerating many more of the barbarous\r\ncustoms of the islands, the good friar Mozo exclaims:--\"Fancy our\r\ntroubles and labours in rescuing such barbarians from the power\r\nof the devil!\" They sacrifice as many victims as they find fingers\r\nopened after death. If the hand be closed, none. They suffer much\r\nfrom cutaneous diseases. The Busaos paint their arms with flowers,\r\nand to carry ornaments bore their ears, which are sometimes stretched\r\ndown to their shoulders. The Ifugaos wear on a necklace pieces of\r\ncane denoting the number of enemies they have killed. Galvey says\r\nhe counted twenty-three worn by one man who fell in an affray with\r\nSpanish troops. This tribe frequently attacks travellers in the\r\nmountains for the sake of their skulls. The missionaries represent\r\nthem as the fiercest enemies of Christians. Some of the monks speak\r\nof horrible confessions made by Igorrote women after their conversion\r\nto Christianity, of their intercourse with monkeys in the woods, and\r\nthe Padre Lorenzo indulges in long details on the subject, declaring,\r\nmoreover, that a creature was once brought to him for baptism which\r\n\"filled him with suspicion.\" De Mas reports that a child with long\r\narms, covered with soft hair, and much resembling a monkey, was\r\nexhibited by his mother in Viyan, and taught to ask for alms.\r\n\r\nDe Mas recommends that the Spanish Government should buy the\r\nsaleable portion of the Mahomedan and pagan tribes, convert them,\r\nand employ them in the cultivation of land; and he gives statistics\r\nto show that there would be an accumulation of 120 per cent., while\r\ntheir removal would set the Indians together by the ears, who would\r\ndestroy one another, and relieve the islands from the plague of their\r\npresence. This would seem a new chapter in the history of slave-trade\r\nexperiments. He calculates that there are more than a million pagans\r\nand Mahomedans in the islands. Galvey's \"Diary of an Expedition to\r\nBenguet in January, 1829,\" and another to Bacun in December, 1831,\r\nare histories of personal adventures, many of a perilous character,\r\nin which many lives were lost, and many habitations destroyed. They\r\nare interesting as exhibiting the difficulties of subjugating these\r\nmountain races. Galvey conducted several other expeditions, and died\r\nin 1839.\r\n\r\nThere are few facts of more interest, in connection with the changes\r\nthat are going on in the Oriental world, than the outpouring of the\r\nsurplus Chinese population into almost every region eastwards of\r\nBengal; and in Calcutta itself there is now a considerable body of\r\nChinese, mostly shoemakers, many of whom have acquired considerable\r\nwealth, and they are banded together in that strong gregarious bond\r\nof nationality which accompanies them wherever they go, and which\r\nis not broken, scarcely even influenced, by the circumstances that\r\nsurround them. In the islands of the Philippines they have obtained\r\nalmost a monopoly of the retail trade, and the indolent habits of\r\nthe natives cannot at all compete with these industrious, frugal,\r\nand persevering intruders. Hence they are objects of great dislike\r\nto the natives; but, as their generally peaceful demeanour and\r\nobedience to the laws give no hold to their enemies, their numbers,\r\ntheir wealth, their importance increase from year to year. Yet they\r\nare but birds of passage, who return home to be succeeded by others\r\nof their race. They never bring their wives, but take to themselves\r\nwives or hand-maidens from the native tribes. Legitimate marriage,\r\nhowever, necessitates the profession of Christianity, and many of\r\nthem care little for the public avowal of subjection to the Church\r\nof Rome. They are allowed no temple to celebrate Buddhist rites,\r\nbut have cemeteries specially appropriated to them. They pay a fixed\r\ncontribution, which is regulated by the rank they hold as merchants,\r\ntraders, shopkeepers, artisans, servants, &c. Whole streets in Manila\r\nare occupied by them, and wherever we went we found them the most\r\nlaborious, the most prosperous of the working classes. Thousands upon\r\nthousands of Chinamen arrive, and are scattered over the islands, but\r\nnot a single Chinese woman accompanies them from their native country.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1857, 4,232 Chinamen landed in the port of Manila alone,\r\nand 2,592 left for China.\r\n\r\nOf the extraordinary unwillingness of the women of China to emigrate,\r\nno more remarkable evidence can be found than in the statistics of\r\nthe capital of the Philippines. In 1855, there were in the fortress\r\nof Manila 525 Chinamen, but of females only two women and five\r\nchildren. In Binondo, 5,055 Chinamen, but of females only eight, all\r\nof whom were children. Now, when it is remembered that the Philippines\r\nare, with a favourable monsoon, not more than three or four days' sail\r\nfrom China, that there are abundance of opulent Chinese settled in the\r\nisland, that the desire of having children and perpetuating a race is\r\nuniversal among the Chinese people, it may be easily conceived that\r\nthere must be an intensely popular feeling opposed to the emigration\r\nof women.\r\n\r\nAnd such is undoubtedly the fact, and it is a fact which must prove\r\na great barrier to successful coolie emigration. No women have been\r\nobtainable either for the British or Spanish colonies, though the\r\nexportation of coolies had exceeded 60,000, and except by kidnapping\r\nand direct purchase from the procuresses or the brothels, it is\r\ncertain no woman can be induced to emigrate. This certainty ought to\r\nbe seriously weighed by the advocates of the importation of Chinese\r\nlabourers into the colonies of Great Britain. In process of time,\r\nHong Kong will probably furnish some voluntary female emigrants,\r\nand the late legalization of emigration by the Canton authorities\r\nwill accelerate the advent of a result so desirable.\r\n\r\nDuring five years, ending in 1855, there were for grave crimes\r\nonly fourteen committals of Chinamen in the whole of the provinces,\r\nbeing an average of less than three per annum; no case of murder,\r\nnone of robbery with violence, none for rape. There were nine cases\r\nof larceny, two of cattle-stealing, one forgery, one coining, one\r\nincendiarism. These facts are greatly creditable to the morality of\r\nthe Chinese settlers. Petty offences are punished, as in the case of\r\nthe Indians, by their own local principalia.\r\n\r\nA great majority of the shoemakers in the Philippines are Chinese. Of\r\n784 in the capital, 633 are Chinamen, and 151 natives. Great\r\nnumbers are carpenters, blacksmiths, water-carriers, cooks, and daily\r\nlabourers, but a retail shopkeeping trade is the favourite pursuit. Of\r\nlate, however, many are merging into the rank of wholesale dealers\r\nand merchants, exporting and importing large quantities of goods\r\non their own account, and having their subordinate agents scattered\r\nover most of the islands. Where will not a Chinaman penetrate--what\r\nrisks will he not run--to what suffering will he not submit--what\r\nenterprises will he not engage in--what perseverance will he not\r\ndisplay--if money is to be made? And, in truth, this constitutes his\r\nvalue as a settler: he is economical, patient, persistent, cunning;\r\nsubmissive to the laws, respectful to authority, and seeking only\r\nfreedom from molestation while he adds dollar to dollar, and when the\r\npile is sufficient for his wants or his ambition, he returns home,\r\nto be succeeded by others, exhibiting the same qualities, and in\r\ntheir turn to be rewarded by the same success.\r\n\r\nWhen encouragement was first given to the Chinese to settle in\r\nthe Philippines, it was as agricultural labourers, and they were\r\nnot allowed to exercise any other calling. The Japanese were also\r\ninvited, of whom scarcely any are now to be found in the islands. The\r\nreputation of the Chinese as cultivators of the land no doubt\r\ndirected the attention of the Manila authorities towards them; but\r\nno Chinaman continues in any career if he can discover another more\r\nprofitable. Besides this, they were no favourites among the rural\r\npopulation, and in their gregarious nature were far more willing\r\nto band themselves together in groups and hwey (associations) than\r\nto disperse themselves among the pastoral and agricultural races,\r\nwho were jealous of them as rivals and hated them as heathens. They\r\nhave created for themselves a position in the towns, and are now too\r\nnumerous and too wealthy to be disregarded or seriously oppressed. They\r\nare mostly from the province of Fokien, and Amoy is the principal port\r\nof their embarkation. I did not find among them a single individual\r\nwho spoke the classical language of China, though a large proportion\r\nread the Chinese character.\r\n\r\nWhen a Chinese is examined on oath, the formula of cutting off the\r\nhead of a white cock is performed by the witness, who is told that,\r\nif he do not utter the truth, the blood of his family will, like\r\nthat of the cock, be spilt and perdition overtake them. My long\r\nexperience of the Chinese compels me to say that I believe no oath\r\nwhatever--nothing but the apprehension of punishment--affords any,\r\nthe least security against perjury. In our courts in China various\r\nforms have at different times been used--cock beheading; the breaking\r\nof a piece of pottery; the witness repeating imprecations on himself,\r\nand inviting the breaking up of all his felicities if he lied;\r\nthe burning of a piece of paper inscribed with a form of oath,\r\nand an engagement to be consumed in hell, as that paper on earth,\r\nif he spoke not the truth;--these and other ceremonies have utterly\r\nfailed in obtaining any security for veracity. While I was governor\r\nof Hong Kong an ordinance was passed abolishing the oath-taking, as\r\nregards the Chinese, and punishing them severely as perjurers when\r\nthey gave false testimony. The experiment has succeeded in greatly\r\nfortifying and encouraging the utterance of truth and in checking\r\nobscurity and mendacity. I inquired once of an influential person in\r\nCanton what were the ceremonies employed among themselves where they\r\nsought security for truthful evidence. He said there was one temple\r\nin which a promise made would be held more binding than if made in\r\nany other locality; but he acknowledged their tribunals had no real\r\nsecurity for veracity. There is a Chinese proverb which says, \"Puh\r\ntah, puh chaou,\" meaning \"Without blows, no truth;\" and the torture\r\nis constantly applied to witnesses in judicial cases. The Chinese\r\nreligiously respect their written, and generally their ceremonial,\r\nengagements--they \"lose face\" if these are dishonoured. But little\r\ndisgrace attends lying, especially when undetected and unpunished, and\r\nthe art of lying is one of the best understood arts of government. Lies\r\nto deceive barbarians are even recommended and encouraged in some of\r\ntheir classical books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supreme court of justice in the Philippines is the Audiencia\r\nestablished in Manila, which is the tribunal of appeal from the\r\nsubordinate jurisdiction, and the consultative council of the\r\nGovernor-General in cases of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe court is composed of seven oidores, or judges. The president takes\r\nthe title of Regent. There are two government advocates, one for\r\ncriminal, the other for civil causes, and a variety of subordinate\r\nofficers. There are no less than eighty barristers, matriculated to\r\npractise in the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nA Tribunal de Comercio, presided over by a judge nominated by the\r\nauthorities, and assisted, under the title of Consules, by gentlemen\r\nselected from the principal mercantile establishments of the capital,\r\nis charged with the settlement of commercial disputes. There is a\r\nright of appeal to the Audiencia, but scarcely any instance of its\r\nbeing exercised.\r\n\r\nThere is a censorship called the Comercia permanente de censura. It\r\nconsists of four ecclesiastics and four civilians, presided over by\r\nthe civil fiscal, and its authority extends to all books imported\r\ninto or printed in the islands.\r\n\r\nThere are fourscore lawyers (abogados) in Manila. As far as my\r\nexperience goes, lawyers are the curse of colonies. I remember one\r\nof the most intelligent of the Chinese merchants who had settled at\r\nSingapore, after having been long established at Hong Kong, telling\r\nme that all the disadvantages of Singapore were more than compensated\r\nby the absence of \"the profession,\" and all the recommendations of\r\nHong Kong more than counterbalanced by the presence of gentlemen\r\noccupied in fomenting, and recompensed for fomenting, litigations and\r\nquarrels. Many of them make large fortunes, not unfrequently at the\r\nexpense of substantial justice. A sound observer says, that in the\r\nPhilippines truth is swamped by the superfluity of law documents. The\r\ndoors opened for the protection of innocence are made entrances\r\nfor chicanery, and discussions are carried on without any regard to\r\nthe decorum which prevails in European courts. Violent invectives,\r\nrecriminations, personalities, and calumnies, are ventured upon\r\nunder the protection of professional privilege. When I compare the\r\nequitable, prompt, sensible and inexpensive judgments of the consular\r\ncourts in China with the results of the costly, tardy, unsatisfactory\r\ntechnicalities of judicial proceedings in many colonies, I would desire\r\na general proviso that no tribunal should be accessible in civil cases\r\nuntil after an examination by a court of conciliation. The extortions\r\nto which the Chinese are subjected, in Hong Kong, for example--and\r\nI speak from personal knowledge--make one blush for \"the squeezing\"\r\nto which, indeed, the corruption of their own mandarins have but too\r\nmuch accustomed them. In the Philippines there is a great mass of\r\nunwritten, or at least unprinted, law, emanating from different and\r\nindependent sources, often contradictory, introduced traditionally,\r\nquoted erroneously; a farrago, in which the \"Leyes de Indias,\" the\r\n\"Siete partidas,\" the \"Novisima recompilacion,\" the Roman code,\r\nthe ancient and the royal fueros--to say nothing of proclamations,\r\ndecrees, notifications, orders, bandos--produce all the \"toil and\r\ntrouble\" of the witches' cauldron, stirred by the evil genii of\r\ndiscord and disputation.\r\n\r\nGames of chance (juegos de azar) are strictly prohibited in the\r\nPhilippines, but the prohibition is utterly inefficient; and, as I\r\nhave mentioned before, the Manila papers are crowded with lists of\r\npersons fined or imprisoned for violation of the law; sometimes forty\r\nor fifty are cited in a single newspaper. More than one captain-general\r\nhas informed me that the severity of the penalty has not checked the\r\nuniversality of the offence, connived at and participated in by both\r\necclesiastics and civilians.\r\n\r\nThe fines are fifty dollars for the first, and one hundred dollars\r\nfor the second, offence, and for the third, the punishment which\r\nattaches to vagabondage--imprisonment and the chain-gang.\r\n\r\nBilliard-tables pay a tax of six dollars per month. There is an\r\ninferior wooden table which pays half that sum.\r\n\r\nThe criminal statistics of five years, from 1851 to 1855 present the\r\nfollowing total number of convictions for the graver offences. They\r\ncomprise the returns from all the provinces. Of the whole number of\r\ncriminals, more than one-half are from 20 to 29 years old; one-third\r\nfrom 30 to 39; one-ninth from 40 to 49; one-twentieth from 15 to 19;\r\nand one-forty-fifth above 50.\r\n\r\nThey consist of 467 married, 81 widowers, and 690 unmarried men.\r\n\r\nDuring the said period 236 had completed the terms of their sentences,\r\n217 had died, and 785 remained at the date of the returns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdultery                      1   Brought forward                   259\r\nAdultery, with homicide       1   Murder, with wounding and\r\nProhibited arms               7   robbery                           314\r\nAbandonment of post           6   Robberies                         390\r\nBigamy                        1   Robberies, with violence          120\r\nDrunkenness                   2   Robberies of Tobacco                6\r\nHorse and cattle stealing    21   Robberies on bodies (Dacoits)      36\r\nConspiracy                   17   Wounding in quarrels               44\r\nSmuggling                     1   Wounding (causing death)            7\r\nDeserters                   126   Incendiarism                        4\r\nRape                         14   Incendiarism, with robbery         16\r\nRape and incest               4   Incest                              6\r\nRape and robbery              6   Mutiny                              7\r\nPoisoning                     2   Nonpayment of fines                 3\r\nForging passports            13   False name                          1\r\nFraudulent distilling         1   Parricide                           2\r\nVagabonds                    35   Resistance to military             18\r\nCoining                       1   Escape from prison                  5\r\nCarried forward             259   Total                           1,238\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the city of Manila there was only one conviction for murder in\r\nfive years. The proportion of the graver offences in the different\r\nprovinces is nearly the same, except in the island of Negros, where\r\nof forty-four criminals, twenty-eight were convicted of murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nARMY AND NAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army of the Philippines, with the exception of two brigades of\r\nartillery and a corps of engineers which are furnished by Spain,\r\nis recruited from the Indians, and presents an appearance generally\r\nsatisfactory. They are wholly officered by Europeans.\r\n\r\nThere are nine regiments of native infantry, one of cavalry, called the\r\nLuzon Lancers, and there is a reserve corps of officers called Cuadro\r\nde Remplazos, from whom individuals are selected to fill up vacancies.\r\n\r\nThere is a small body of Alabarderos de servicio at the palace in\r\nthe special service of the captain-general. Their origin dates from\r\nA.D. 1590, and their halberds and costume add to the picturesque\r\ncharacter of the palace and the receptions there.\r\n\r\nThere are also four companies called the Urban Militia of Manila,\r\ncomposed of Spaniards, who may be called upon by the governor for\r\nspecial services or in cases of emergency.\r\n\r\nA medical board exercises a general inspection over the troops. Its\r\nsuperior functionaries are European Spaniards. Hospitals in which\r\nthe military invalids are received are subject to the authority\r\nof the medical board as far as the treatment of such invalids is\r\nconcerned. The medical board nominates an officer to each of the\r\nregiments, who is called an Ayudante.\r\n\r\nOf late a considerable body of native troops has been sent from Manila\r\nto Cochin China, in order to co-operate with the French military and\r\nmarine forces in that country. They are reported to have behaved well\r\nin a service which can have had few attractions, and in which they have\r\nbeen exposed to many sufferings, in consequence of the climate and the\r\nhostile attitude of the native inhabitants. What object the Spaniards\r\nhad in taking so important a part in this expedition to Touron remains\r\nhitherto unexplained. Territory and harbours in Oriental regions, rich\r\nand abundant, they hold in superfluity; and assuredly Cochin China\r\naffords nothing very inviting to well-informed ambition; nor are the\r\nPhilippines in a condition to sacrifice their population to distant,\r\nuncertain, perilous, and costly adventures. There is no national pride\r\nto be flattered by Annamite conquests, and the murder of a Spanish\r\nbishop may be considered as atoned for by the destruction of the forts\r\nand scattering of the people, at the price, however, of the lives of\r\nhundreds of Christians and of a heavy pecuniary outlay. France has\r\nits purposes--frankly enough disclosed--to obtain some port, some\r\npossession of her own, in or near the China seas. I do not think such\r\na step warrants distrust or jealousy on our part. The question may\r\nbe asked, whether the experiment is worth the cost? Probably not,\r\nfor France has scarcely any commercial interest in China or the\r\nneighbouring countries; nor is her colonial system, fettered as it\r\nalways has been by protections and prohibitions, likely to create\r\nsuch interest. In the remote East, France can carry on no successful\r\nrivalry with Great Britain, the United States, Holland, or Spain, each\r\nof which has points of geographical superiority and influence which\r\nto France are not accessible. One condition is a sine quâ non in these\r\ndays of trading rivalry--lowness of price, associated with cheapness of\r\ntransport. France offers neither to the foreign consumer in any of the\r\ngreat articles of supply: she will have high prices for her producers.\r\n\r\nThe maritime forces are under the orders of the commandant of the\r\nstation. They consist of four steamers and one brig-of-war, six\r\ngunboats, and a considerable number of faluas (feluccas), which are\r\nemployed in the coasting service and for the suppression of piracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic instruction is in an unsatisfactory state in the\r\nPhilippines--the provisions are little changed from those of the\r\nmonkish ages.\r\n\r\nIn the University of St. Thomas there are about a thousand\r\nstudents. The professorships are of theology, the canon and civil\r\nlaw, metaphysics and grammar; but no attention is given to the\r\nnatural sciences, to the modern languages, nor have any of the\r\neducational reforms which have penetrated most of the colleges\r\nof Europe and America found their way to the Philippines. In the\r\ncolegios and schools what is called philosophy, rhetoric and Latin\r\nare the principal objects of attention. The most numerously attended\r\nof these establishments were founded two or three centuries ago,\r\nand pursue the same course of instruction which was adopted at\r\ntheir first establishment. There are several colleges and convents\r\nfor women. That of Santa Potenciana was established under a royal\r\ndecree, dated A.D. 1589, which requires that girls (doncellas) be\r\nreceived and taught to \"live modestly\" (honestamente), and, under\r\nsound doctrine, to \"come out\" for \"marriage and propagation of the\r\nrace\" (hagan propagacion). There is a nautical school, of which I\r\nheard a favourable report, and an academy of painting, which has\r\nhitherto produced no Murillo or Velasquez. The best native works\r\nof art which I saw were two heads of the Virgin and St. Francisco,\r\ncarved by an Indian in ivory, and which adorn the convent of Lucban,\r\nin the province of Tayabas. The good friars attributed to them almost\r\nmiraculous virtues, and assured me that, though heavy rains preceded\r\nand followed the processions in which the images were introduced,\r\na bright and beautiful sunshine accompanied them in their progress.\r\n\r\nAmong the novel objects that meet the eye in Manila, especially on\r\nthe morning of religious fiestas, are groups of veiled women, wearing\r\na dark mysterious costume, who visit the different churches. Their\r\ndress is a black woollen or silken petticoat, over which is a large\r\nshining mantilla, or veil, of a deep mulberry colour; others wear\r\nthe ancient hooded Andalusian black cloak. There are the sisterhoods\r\ncalled the Colegialas de los Beaterios--religious establishments in\r\nwhich young women receive their education; some supported by \"pious\r\nfoundations,\" others by voluntary contributions. The rules of these\r\nconvents vary, as some of the nuns never quit the buildings, others\r\nvisit the churches under the guardianship of a \"mother;\" in some it\r\nis permitted to the colegiala to join her family at certain seasons,\r\nand to participate in social enjoyments at home or abroad. These pay\r\nfor their education sums varying from two to eight dollars a month,\r\naccording to the regulations of the different beaterios, which\r\nhave also their distinguishing costumes in some of the details,\r\nsuch as the colour of the lining of their dress. It is said there\r\nis scarcely a family of respectability in Manila that has not one\r\ndaughter at least in a beaterio. In that of Santa Rosa the monthly pay\r\nis five dollars. Its inmates rise at five A.M., to chant the trisagio\r\n(holy, holy, holy), to hear mass and engage in devotion for the first\r\npart of the rosary till six; then to wash and dress; breakfast at\r\nhalf-past six; instruction from seven to ten; dinner at half-past\r\neleven in the refectory; siesta and rest till half-past two P.M.;\r\ndevotion in the chapel, going through the second part of the rosary;\r\ninstruction from half-past three till half-past five; at the \"oration,\"\r\nthey return to the chapel, recite the third part of the rosary, and\r\nengage in reading or meditation for half an hour; sup at eight P.M.;\r\nenjoy themselves in the cloister or garden till nine; another prayer,\r\nand they retire to their cells. In the beaterio of St. Sebastian of\r\nCalumpang the inmates rise at four A.M.: the pay is five dollars;\r\nbut the general arrangements are the same as those described. In the\r\nbeaterio of Santa Catalina de Sena they are not allowed to leave the\r\nconvent. The pay is eight dollars: it has the reputation of superior\r\naccommodation, and less economical food. The beaterio of the Jesuits\r\nhas about 900 inmates; but this number is much exceeded in Lent, when\r\ngreat numbers enter to perform their spiritual exercises. The pay\r\nis only two dollars per month; but much sewing and washing is done\r\nwithin the convent for its support. When the Jesuits were expelled,\r\nthe direction of this beaterio passed to the vicar-general of the\r\narchbishopric.\r\n\r\nThe beaterio of Pasig is solely devoted to the reception of Indian\r\norphans, and its founder required that they should be taught \"Christian\r\ndoctrine, sewing, reading, writing, embroidery, and other instruction\r\nbecoming the sex.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many charitable institutions in Manila. The Jesuits,\r\nafterwards expelled from the Philippines by Carlos II., founded several\r\nof the most important. The Hospital of San Juan de Dios has 112 beds;\r\nthat of San José de Cavite 250, of which 104 are for soldiers, and the\r\nrest for paupers and criminals. There is an Administracion de Obras\r\nPias, under the direction of the archbishop, the regent, and some of\r\nthe superior civil authorities, which lends money to the Indians to the\r\nvalue of two-thirds of their landed property, one-half of their value\r\non plate and jewellery, and insures vessels employed in the coasting\r\ntrade. A caja de comunidad exacts half a rial (3 1/4d.) annually from\r\nthe Chinese and Indians for the payment of \"schoolmasters, vaccinators,\r\ndefence of criminals, chanters, and sacristans of churches.\" The fund\r\nis administered by the directing board of finance.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Hospital of St. Lazarus, under charge of the\r\nFranciscan friars, is not without interest. It was constructed for\r\nthe use of the natives in 1578, was enlarged, and twice consumed\r\nby fire. In the year 1632, it received 150 Christian lepers exiled\r\nfrom Japan, and thence took its present name. It was demolished\r\nby the captain-general in 1662, when the Chinese pirates menaced\r\nthe capital, as it was deemed an impediment to the defence of the\r\nplace. The inmates were removed; and another hospital was built, which\r\nwas again destroyed in 1783, in consequence of its having been useful\r\nto the English in their invasion in 1762; but a few years afterwards\r\nthe present edifice was built on lands which belonged to the Jesuits\r\nbefore the extinction of their society in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are in the Philippines one archiepiscopal and three episcopal\r\nsees. The metropolitan archbishopric of Manila was founded by Clement\r\nVII. in 1595, and endowed by Philip II. with a revenue of 500,000\r\nmaravedis (= 200l. sterling). The bishopric of New Segovia was\r\ncreated at the same time with a similar endowment. The see is now\r\n(1859) vacant. The bishopric of Cebu was established in 1567, soon\r\nafter the conquest of the island by the Spaniards. Nueva Caceres has\r\nalso a bishop. The selection of candidates for these ecclesiastical\r\nhonours has been generally left to the religious brotherhood who\r\nare most numerous in the district where there is a vacancy, and the\r\ncandidate, being approved by the sovereign of Spain, is submitted to\r\nthe Pope for confirmation. Some nominations have taken place where\r\nthe bishop elect has not been willing to quit the mother-country\r\nfor the colonies, which I was informed had caused the adoption of\r\na resolution not to install a bishop until he has taken possession\r\nof his see. Most of the ecclesiastical authority is in the hands of\r\nthe friars or regular clergy. There are proportionally few secular\r\npriests in the islands. The Dominicans and Augustine monks have large\r\npossessions, especially in the central and southern provinces; the\r\nFranciscans are most numerous in the northern. To the hospitality\r\nand kindness of the friars during the whole of my journey I bear a\r\nwilling and grateful testimony. Everywhere the convents were opened\r\nto us with cordial welcome, and I attribute much of the display of\r\nattention on the part of the Indians to the reception we everywhere\r\nexperienced from the Spanish padres. The Dominican monks have charge\r\nof the mission to Fokien, in China, and Tonquin.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical records of the Philippines overflow with evidences\r\nof the bitter, and sometimes bloody, controversies of the Church\r\nwith the civil authority, and with quarrels of the religious bodies\r\namong themselves. In the year 1710 the Dominicans declared themselves\r\nnot subject to the jurisdiction of diocesan visits. One of their\r\nresolutions says:--\"The provinces hold it for evident and certain\r\nthat such visits would lead to the perdition of religious ministers,\r\nwhich is the opinion that has been for many years held by grave\r\nand zealous ecclesiastics and superior prelates who have dwelt in\r\nthe province.\" In 1757 the Augustine friars (calzados) were menaced\r\nwith the confiscation of their property if they denied the supreme\r\nauthority and the admission of parochial curates regularly appointed;\r\nand they resolved that such submission \"would be the ruin of their\r\ninstitution and to the notable detriment of souls.\" In 1767 Benedict\r\nXIV. published a bull insisting on the recognition of the metropolitan\r\nauthority, which was still resisted by the Augustines. In 1775 a\r\nroyal mandate was issued at Madrid insisting that all regular curates\r\nbe submitted to their provincial in questions de vitâ et moribus,\r\nto the bishop, in all matters of spiritual administration, and to the\r\ncaptain-general as vice-regal patron. Whether the ecclesiastical police\r\nis better kept by the interference of the higher authorities, or by\r\nthe independent action among themselves of the different religious\r\norders, is a question much debated, but the substantive fact remains\r\nthat the friar has an enormous and little-controlled influence in the\r\nlocality of his cure, and that where abuses exist it is very difficult\r\nto collect evidence, and still more so to inflict punishment in case\r\nof his misdoings.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that, in the language of Tomas de Comyn, \"the\r\nmissionaries were the real conquerors of the Philippines; their arms\r\nwere not, indeed, those of the warrior, but they gave laws to millions,\r\nand, scattered though they were, they established by unity of purpose\r\nand of action a permanent empire over immense multitudes of men.\" Up\r\nto the present hour there are probably few parishes in which the\r\ngobernadorcillo, having received a mandate from the civil authority,\r\nfails to consult the friar, and the efficiency and activity of the\r\nIndian functionary in giving effect to the mandate will much depend\r\non the views the padre may take of the orders issued.\r\n\r\nReligious processions are the pride and the passion of the Filipinos,\r\nand on great festivals they bring together prodigious crowds both\r\nas actors and spectators. The most brilliant are those which take\r\nplace after sunset, when some thousands of persons carry lighted\r\nwax candles, and the procession is sometimes a mile long, composed\r\nof all the military and civil authorities and of the ecclesiastical\r\nfunctionaries, vying with each other in the display of their zeal and\r\ndevotion. On these occasions splendidly dressed images of the various\r\nobjects of veneration form an important part of the ceremonial. I\r\nwas assured that the jewels worn by the image of Nuestra Señora de\r\nla Imaculada Concepcion on the day of her festival exceeded 25,000\r\ndollars in value. Numerous bands of music accompany the show. One of\r\nthe most interesting parts of the exhibition is the number of little\r\ngirls prettily and fancifully dressed in white, who follow some of\r\nthe images of the saints or the palio of the archbishop. One of the\r\nprocessions witnessed was forty minutes in passing, and of immense\r\nlength, the whole way being lined with bearers of wax lights on\r\nboth sides. There seems a rivalry among the religious orders as to\r\nwhose displays shall be the most effective and imposing. The images\r\nare of the size of life, and clad in gorgeous garments encumbered\r\nwith ornaments. They are borne on the shoulders of their votaries,\r\noccupying a platform, whence they are visible to the crowd. [14]\r\n\r\nThese religious ceremonials, so dear to, and so characteristic of,\r\nthe Filipinos, are called Pentacasi. Everybody seems to take a part,\r\nwhether within or without doors. All invite or are invited, and busy\r\nhands are engaged in making sweetmeats, preparing meats, or adorning\r\napartments (with furniture borrowed from all sides, a favour to be\r\nreciprocated in turn), musicians are collected, strangers are sought\r\nfor, and universal bustle pervades the locality.\r\n\r\n\"On the eve preceding the festival,\" says a native author, describing\r\nwhat takes place in the neighbourhood of Manila, \"the pueblo exhibits\r\nall the activity of preparation. In the streets, handsome arches are\r\nconstructed of bamboo, covered with painted linen, and representing\r\nvarious orders of architecture; graceful drapery is suspended over\r\nthe arch, which has sundry openings or windows, in which variegated\r\nlanterns are placed (an art taught, no doubt, by the Chinese, who\r\npossess it in perfection). Within the lanterns ornamented figures\r\nare kept in perpetual movement by the heated atmosphere. Nosegays of\r\nartificial flowers, groups of fruits, and various devices decorate\r\nthe houses, and the local musicians serenade the priests and the\r\nauthorities; while the whole population crowd the church for the\r\nvesper service. The dalagas (girls) prepare their gayest attire to\r\ntake part in the procession, in which queens and saints and various\r\nscriptural personages are represented by the Zagalas or females of\r\nthe leading families, in garments of velvet and gold, with all the\r\njewels that can be collected--not that always the costume testifies to\r\nmuch classical or historical knowledge; it is, however, very gay and\r\ngorgeous, satisfactory to the wearers, admired and applauded by the\r\nspectators. Popular songs are sung to the music of the guitar, and the\r\ngaieties are carried on to the midnight hour. At eight o'clock on the\r\nfollowing morning mass is attended, a sermon preached, a procession\r\nfollows, and all retire to their dwellings to escape the heat of the\r\nday; but in the principal houses repasts are ready for any guests who\r\nmay call, and a considerable variety of Indian dishes are laid out\r\nupon the table. At four P.M., the military arrive with their music,\r\nand generally the village musicians and the church choir assemble near\r\nthe church, and welcome the many visitors who come from the capital. So\r\ngreat is the crowd of carriages, that they are not allowed to pass\r\nthrough the streets, but their occupiers quit them at the entrance of\r\nthe pueblo, and make their way to the hosts who have invited them. A\r\ngreat number of Spanish ladies from Manila are generally seated at the\r\nwindows to witness the busy scene. Not only are the streets crowded\r\nby the gaily dressed inhabitants, but multitudes of Indians come from\r\nthe interior to take part in the festivity. The native authorities,\r\npreceded by music, then visit the various houses to collect the\r\nZagalas, who come forth in their regal robes and crowns, with a suite\r\nof attendants. There is a great display of fireworks, rockets, and\r\nballoons, and the procession proceeds to the church. It is a grand day\r\nfor the gallera, or cockpit, which resembles the bull-fight arena in\r\nSpain: it is filled to suffocation with noisy and excited actors and\r\nspectators; immense bets are laid; booths surround the place, where\r\nfood and drink are sold, and among the delicacies roasted sucking-pigs\r\nabound. The procession usually starts at six P.M. All those who take\r\npart bear a lighted wax-candle: first, the children of the pueblo;\r\nthen the soldiers; then the image of the Virgin, with an escort\r\nof veiled women; then the image of the saint of the day or of the\r\nplace, the car drawn by a number of dalagas in white garments, bearing\r\ngarlands and crowns of flowers, followed by the authorities and by the\r\npriest in his golden cope; then a military band and cavalry soldiers;\r\nthen the principal Zagala, whose queenly train is borne by eight or\r\nten Indian girls, in white garments, adorned with flowers. Other\r\nZagalas, personifying the Christian virtues, follow--Faith, Hope,\r\nCharity, with their characteristic attributes. Sometimes there are\r\ncars in which scenes of Scripture are exhibited by living actors;\r\nothers displaying all the fancies of devotees. The procession parades\r\nthe streets till the night is far advanced; the images are then\r\nrestored to the church, and other amusements begin. The principal\r\nguests are invited to an open, but temporarily erected building,\r\nhandsomely curtained, and brilliantly lighted, in the centre of\r\nwhich is a large table, covered with delicacies, and ornamented with\r\ngroups and pyramids of flowers. The first attentions are shown to the\r\necclesiastics, and then to the other visitors, according to their rank\r\nand position. The streets and houses being illuminated as the night\r\nadvances, the principal inhabitants gather their guests together,\r\nand at ten P.M. there are displays of fireworks and balloons, in\r\nwhich the rivalry of the pyrotechnic artists of the capital have a\r\nfine field for exercise. Most of the pueblos around Manila have their\r\nfestival days, and in the competition for giving glory to their local\r\nsaints and patrons, they seek to outdo the capital itself. Santa Cruz,\r\nwhich is an opulent and populous locality, rejoices in the protection\r\nof St. Stanislaus, and outbids most of the rest for ostentatious show,\r\nin which the inhabitants of Manila take an active part. The Chinese\r\nhave their day in celebrating St. Nicholas in Guadalupe. Tondo has\r\nits distinguished festivals. Binondo is great and gorgeous on the\r\nday of \"Our Lady of the Rosary of Saint Dominic.\" Sampaloc claims\r\n\"Our Lady of Loreto.\" Santa Ana worships \"Our Lady of the abandoned\r\nones\" (de los desamparados). Pandacan has its gatherings in honour\r\nof \"The sweet name of Jesus,\" and its beautiful scenery adds to the\r\nattractions of the place. St. Sebastian processionizes its silver car,\r\nin which \"Our Lady of Carmel\" is conveyed in state. The suspensions\r\ncaused by the rainy months, Lent, and a few other interruptions,\r\nare compensated by the extra ceremonials and festivities of the holy\r\nweeks, and other seasons of Catholic gratulation. The mere list of\r\nall these fiestas would occupy pages, and it was my good fortune to\r\nvisit the islands at a time when I had an opportunity of witnessing\r\nmany of these characteristic exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe opulence of the individual monks, and of some of the monkish\r\nfraternities in the islands, has often and naturally been a subject of\r\nreproach. The revenues received by individuals are in many localities\r\nvery large, amounting in remote districts to eight or nine thousand\r\ndollars a year, and much more, it is reported, in such populous pueblos\r\nas Binondo. Some of these communities also possess large tracts of\r\nland, whose management is superintended at periodical meetings held in\r\nthe capital, when friars from the different provinces, and of the same\r\nbrotherhood, are summoned to give an account of their stewardship, and\r\nto discuss the general interests of the fraternity. The accumulations\r\nof the friars pass to the convents at their death, but they have\r\nlittle difficulty in disposing of them while living.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the policy of the friars in the Philippines\r\nis to conduct the Indian to heaven by a pathway of flowers. Little\r\nmolestation will he experience from his ghostly father, if he be strict\r\nin his religious observances, pay his regular contributions to Church\r\nand State, and exhibit those outward marks of respect and reverence\r\nwhich the representatives of the Deity claim as their lawful heritage;\r\nbut there are many thorns amidst the flowers, and drawbacks, on the\r\nheavenly road; and the time may come when higher and nobler aspirations\r\nthan those which now satisfy the poor untutored, or little tutored,\r\nIndian, will be his rule of conduct.\r\n\r\nThe personal courtesies, the kind reception and multifarious\r\nattentions which I received from the friars in every part of the\r\nPhilippines naturally dispose me to look upon them with a friendly\r\neye. I found among them men worthy of being loved and honoured, some\r\nof considerable intellectual vigour; but literary cultivation and\r\nscientific acquirements are rare. Occupied with their own concerns,\r\nthey are little acquainted with mundane affairs. Politics, geography,\r\nhistory, have no charms for those who, even had they the disposition\r\nfor study, would, in their seclusion and remoteness, have access\r\nto few of its appliances. Their convents are almost palatial, with\r\nextensive courts, grounds and gardens; their revenues frequently\r\nenormous. Though their mode of life is generally unostentatious and\r\nsimple, many of them keep handsome carriages and have the best horses\r\nin the locality; and they are surrounded generally by a prostrate and\r\nsuperstitious population, upon whose hopes and fears, thoughts and\r\nfeelings, they exercise an influence which would seem magical were\r\nit not by their devotees deemed divine. This influence, no doubt,\r\nis greatly due to the heroism, labours, sufferings and sacrifices\r\nof the early missionaries, and to the admirably organized hierarchy\r\nof the Roman Church, whose ramifications reach to the extremest\r\npoints in which any of the forms or semblances of Christianity\r\nare to be discovered. Volumes upon volumes--the folio records of\r\nthe proceedings of the different religious orders, little known\r\nto Protestant readers--fill the library shelves of these Catholic\r\nestablishments, which are the receptacles of their religious history.\r\n\r\nThe most extensively influential brotherhood in the Philippines is\r\nthat of the Augustines (Agostinos Calzados), who administer to the\r\ncure of more than a million and a half of souls. The barefooted\r\nAugustines (Agostinos Descalzos, or Recoletos) claim authority\r\nover about one-third of this number. The Dominicans occupy the\r\nnext rank, and their congregations are scarcely less numerous than\r\nthose of the barefooted Augustines. Next come the Franciscans, who\r\nare supposed to rank with the Dominicans in the extent of their\r\nauthority. Independently of the monastic orders and the superior\r\necclesiastic authorities, there are but a small number of parochial\r\nor secular clergy in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nOn occasions of installations under the \"royal seal,\" the ceremonies\r\ntake place in the church of the Augustines, the oldest in Manila,\r\nwhere also the regimental flags receive their benediction, and other\r\npublic civil festivals are celebrated. A convent is attached to\r\nthe church. Both the regular Augustines and the Recoletos receive\r\npecuniary assistance from the State. The Franciscans rank next to\r\nthe Augustines in the number of their clergy.\r\n\r\nA source of influence possessed by the friars, and from which a great\r\nmajority of civil functionaries are excluded, is the mastery of the\r\nnative languages. All the introductory studies of ecclesiastical\r\naspirants are dedicated to this object. No doubt they have great\r\nadvantages from living habitually among the Indian people, with\r\nwhom they keep up the most uninterrupted intercourse, and of whose\r\nconcerns they have an intimate knowledge. One of the most obvious\r\nmeans of increasing the power of the civil departments would be in\r\nencouragement given to their functionaries for the acquirement of\r\nthe native idioms. I believe Spanish is not employed in the pulpits\r\nanywhere beyond the capital. In many of the pueblos there is not a\r\nsingle individual Indian who understands Castilian, so that the priest\r\nis often the only link between the government and the community, and,\r\nas society is now organized, a necessary link. It must be recollected,\r\ntoo, that the different members of the religious brotherhoods are\r\nbound together by stronger bonds and a more potent and influential\r\norganization than any official hierarchy among civilians; and the\r\ngovernment can expect no co-operation from the priesthood in any\r\nmeasures which tend to the diminution of ecclesiastical authority\r\nor jurisdiction, and yet the subjection of that authority to the\r\nState, and its limitation wherever it interferes with the public\r\nwell-being, is the great necessity and the all-important problem\r\nto be solved in the Philippines. But here, too, the Catholic\r\ncharacter of the government itself presents an enormous and almost\r\ninvincible difficulty. Nothing is so dear to a Spaniard in general\r\nas his religion; his orthodoxy is his pride and glory, and upon this\r\nfoundation the Romish Church naturally builds up a political power and\r\nis able to intertwine its pervading influence with all the machinery\r\nof the civil government. The Dutch have no such embarrassment in\r\ntheir archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General has had the kindness to furnish me with the latest\r\nreturns of the ecclesiastical corporations in the Philippines (dated\r\n1859).

The more remarkable divisions\r\nare the dialects of Pampangas, Zambal, Pangasinan, Ilocos, Cagayan,\r\nCamarines, Batanes, and Chamorro, each derived from one of the two\r\nprincipal branches. But the languages of the unconverted Indians are\r\nvery various, and have little affinity. Of these I understand above\r\nthirty distinct vocabularies exist. The connection between and the\r\nconstruction of the Tagál and Bisayan will be best seen by a comparison\r\nof the Lord's Prayer in each, with a verbal rendering of the words:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTagál.\r\n\r\n Ama nanim [15]    sungma [16] sa langit ca [17],  sambahin [18]\r\nFather our (to us)     art      in heaven thou,   worshipped (be)\r\n\r\nang ngalan   mo;  mupa sa anim ang caharian   mo;   sundin   angloob\r\nthe  name  thine; come to  us  the  kingdom thine; done (be) the will\r\n\r\n mo   dito sa lupa  para na sa langit;  bigianmo  camin ngai-on nang\r\nthine here in earth  so  as in heaven; given (be)  us     now   the\r\n\r\nanim canin sa arao-arao [19] at  patauarvin-mo camis nang animg\r\nour  rice  of    day day,    and forgiven (be)  us   the   our\r\n\r\nmanga-otang, para nang   pagpasawat   nanim   sa\r\n  faults,     as   if  pardoned (are)  our   those\r\n\r\n     nangagcacaoton         sa    anim; at  huvag-mo caming\r\nwho have committed faults against  us;  and let not    us\r\n\r\nipahuintulot [20] sa   tocso;    at  yadia-mo camis sa dilan masama.\r\n      fall        in temptation; and deliver   us   in  all   ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nBisayan.\r\n\r\nAmahan namu nga itotat  ca  sa langit, ipapagdayat [21] an  imong\r\nFather our  who  art   thou in heaven,    praised be    the  thy\r\n\r\nngalun; moanhi [22] canamun an  imong pagcahadi [23]; tumancun\r\n name;     come      to us  the  thy     kingdom;     done (be)\r\n\r\nan  imong buot dinhi si yuta  maingun sa langit; ihatag mo  damsin\r\nthe  thy  will here  in earth   as    in heaven; given (be)   us\r\n\r\nan  canun namun sa matagarvlao, ug  pauadin-mo [24] canir san\r\nthe rice  our   on  every day,  and  pardoned (be)   us   the\r\n\r\nmga-sala namu, maingun ginuara [24] namun  san  mganacasala   danum;\r\n  sins   our,     as     pardoned    our  those     sin    against us;\r\n\r\nngan diri imo     tugotan     cami maholog sa manga-panulai sa amun\r\nnot  by   thee permitted (be)  us   fall   in  temptations  of our\r\n\r\nmanga caauai [25]; apan   baricun-mo   cami sa manga-maraut ngatanan.\r\n   enemies;        also delivered (be)  us  of    evil        all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table of numerals (extracted from De Mas) will show the\r\naffinities between several of the idioms of the Philippines with one\r\nanother, and with the Malay language:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       --  ILOCOS.

Domingo de los Santos,\r\nin Sampaloc (Manila), 1794. This vocabulary consists of nearly 11,000\r\nterms, the same word conveying so many meanings that the actual number\r\nof Tagal words can scarcely exceed 3,500. The examples of distinct\r\ninterpretations of each are innumerable.\r\n\r\nAnother Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, by \"various grave and learned\r\npersons,\" corrected and arranged by the Jesuit Fathers Juan de Noceda\r\nand Pedro de San Lucar, was published in Valladolid in 1832. The editor\r\nsays he would fain have got rid of the task, but the \"blind obedience\"\r\nhe owed to his superior compelled him to persevere. Rules for the\r\naccurate grammatical construction of the language cannot, he says,\r\nbe given, on account of the exceptions and counter-exceptions. The\r\nconfusion between active and passive participles is a labyrinth he\r\ncannot explore. There are more books on the language (artes), he\r\navers, than on any dead or living language! He has consulted no less\r\nthan thirty-seven, among which the first place is due to the Tagál\r\nDemosthenes (Father Francis de San José), to whose researches none have\r\nthe knowledge of adding anything valuable. He professes to have given\r\nall the roots, but not their ramifications, which it is impossible to\r\nfollow. But the Vocabulario is greatly lauded by the \"Visitador,\" as\r\n\"an eagle in its flight,\" and \"a sun in its brilliancy.\" It is reported\r\nto have added three thousand new words to the vocabulary. The editor\r\nhimself is modest enough, and declares he has brought only one drop\r\nto a whole ocean. The work, which had been in many hands, occupied\r\nFather Noceda thirty years, and he allowed no word to pass until\r\n\"twelve Indians\" agreed that he had found its true meaning. He would\r\nnot take less, for had he broken his rule and diminished the numbers,\r\nwho knows, he asks, with what a small amount of authority he might\r\nhave satisfied himself? There can be no doubt that to find absolute\r\nsynonymes between languages so unlike as the Castilian and the Tagáloc\r\nwas an utterly impossible task, and that the root of a word of which\r\nthe editor is in search is often lost in the inflections, combinations\r\nand additions, which surround and involve it, without reference to\r\nany general principle. And after all comes the question, What is the\r\nTagáloc language? That of the mountains differs much from that of\r\nthe valleys; the idiom of the Comingtang from those of the Tingues.\r\n\r\nThe word Tagála, sometimes written Tagál, Tagálo, or Tagáloc, I\r\nimagine, is derived from Taga, a native. Taga Majayjay is a native\r\nof Majayjay. A good Christian is called Ang manga taga langit, a\r\nnative of heaven; and it is a common vituperation to say to a man,\r\n\"Taga infierno,\" signifying, \"You must be a native of hell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tagál language is not easily acquired. A Spanish proverb says there\r\nmust be un año de arte y dos di bahaque--one year of grammar and two\r\nof bahaque. The bahaque is the native dress. The friars informed me\r\nthat it required several years of residence to enable them to preach\r\nin Tagál; and in many of the convents intercourse is almost confined to\r\nthe native idioms, as there are few opportunities of speaking Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe blending of nouns and verbs into a single word, and the difficulty\r\nof tracing the roots of either, is one cause of perplexity, the paucity\r\nof words requiring many meanings for the same sound. Thus ayao means,\r\nenough, passage of merchandise, dearness, and is a note of admiration;\r\nbaba signifies brace, beard, lungs, perchance, abscess; bobo, a net,\r\nto melt, to frighten, to spill; alangalang, courtesy, elevation,\r\ndignity. Hence, too, the frequent repetitions of the same word. Aboabo,\r\nmist; alaala, to remember; ñgalañgala, palate; galagala, bitumen;\r\ndilidili, doubt; hasahasa, a fish.\r\n\r\nSo a prodigious number of Tagál words are given to represent a verb\r\nin its various applications, in which it is difficult to trace any\r\ncommon root or shadow of resemblance. Noceda, for the verb give (dar,\r\nSpanish) has 140 Tagál words; for (meter) put, there are forty-one\r\nforms; for (hacer) do, one hundred and twenty-six. The age of the\r\nmoon is represented by twelve forms, in only two of which does the\r\nTagál word for moon occur.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that a language so rude as the\r\nTagál could never become the channel for communicating scientific\r\nor philosophical knowledge. Yet M. Mallat contends that it is rich,\r\nsonorous, expressive, and, if encouraged, would soon possess a\r\nliterature worthy of a place among that of European nations!\r\n\r\nA folio dictionary of the Bisayan and Spanish language, as spoken\r\nin the island of Panay, was published in 1841 (Manila), having been\r\nwritten by Father Alonzo de Mentrida. The Spanish and Bisayan, by\r\nFather Julian Martin, was published in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe letters e, f, r, and z are wanting, and the only sound not\r\nrepresented by our alphabet is the ñg. The Tagála Indians employ the\r\nletter p instead of the f, which they cannot pronounce. Parancisco\r\nfor Francisco, palso for falso, pino for fino, &c. The r is totally\r\nunutterable by the Tagálos. They convert the letter into d, and\r\nsubject themselves to much ridicule from the mistakes consequent upon\r\nthis infirmity. The z is supplanted by s, which does not convey the\r\nCastilian sound as represented by our soft th.\r\n\r\nIn many provinces, however, of Spain, the Castilian pronunciation of z\r\nis not adopted. There is in the Tagál no vowel sound between a and i,\r\nsuch as is represented in Spanish by the letter e.\r\n\r\nIn teaching the Tagal alphabet, the word yaou, being the demonstrative\r\npronoun, is inserted after the letter which is followed by the vowel a,\r\nand the letter repeated, thus:--Aa yaou (a), baba yaou (b), caca yaou\r\n(c), dada yaou (d), gaga yaou (g), haha yaou (h), lala yaou (l), mama\r\nyaou (m), nana yaou (n), ñgañga yaou (ñg), papa yaou (p), sasa yaou\r\n(s), tata yaou (t), vava yaou (v). The ñg is a combination of the\r\nSpanish ñ with g.\r\n\r\nNouns in Tagal have neither cases, numbers, nor genders. Verbs have\r\ninfinitive, present, preterite, past, future, and imperative tenses,\r\nbut they are not changed by the personal pronouns. Among other\r\nsingularities, it is noted that no active verb can begin with the\r\nletter b. Some of the interjections, and they are very numerous in\r\nthe Tagaloc, are of different genders. How sad! addressed to a man,\r\nis paetog! to a woman, paetag!\r\n\r\nThe Tagáls employ the second person singular icao, or co, in addressing\r\none another, but add the word po, which is a form of respect. In\r\naddressing a woman the word po is omitted, but is expected to be used\r\nby a female in addressing a man. The personal pronouns follow instead\r\nof preceding both verbs and nouns, as napa aco, I say; napa suja,\r\nit is good.\r\n\r\nOne characteristic of the language is that the passive is generally\r\nemployed instead of the active verb. A Tagal will not say \"Juan\r\nloves Maria,\" but \"Maria is loved by Juan.\" Fr. de los Santos says\r\nit is more elegant to employ the active than the passive verb, but I\r\nobserve in the religious books circulated by the friars the general\r\nphraseology is, \"It is said by God;\" \"it is taught by Christ,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThough the Tagál is not rich in words, the same expression having\r\noften a great variety of meanings, there is much perplexity in the\r\nconstruction. The padre Verduga, however, gives a list of several\r\nspecies of verbs, with modifications of nouns subjected to the rules\r\nof European grammar.\r\n\r\nIn adopting Spanish words the Tagals frequently simplify and curtail\r\nthem; for example, for zapato (shoe) they use only pato; Lingo for\r\nDomingo; bavay, caballo (horse). The diminutive of Maria is Mariangui;\r\nwhence Angui, the ordinary name for Mary.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the dictionary, I find in the language only\r\nthirty-five monosyllables, viz., a, ab, an, ang, at, ay, ca [with\r\nthirteen different meanings--a numeral (1), a personal pronoun (they),\r\nfour substantives (thing, companion, fright, abstract), one verb (to\r\ngo), and the rest sundry adjectival, adverbial, and other terms],\r\ncay, co, con, cun, di, din, ga, ha, i, in, is, ma (with eighteen\r\nmeanings, among which are four nouns substantive, eight verbs, and\r\nfour adjectives), man, mi, mo, na, ñga, o, oy, pa (seven meanings),\r\npo, sa, sang, si, sing, ta, ya, and yi.\r\n\r\nWatches are rare among the Indians, and time is not denoted by the\r\nhours of the clock, but by the ordinary events of the day. De Mas gives\r\nno less than twenty-three different forms of language for denoting\r\nvarious divisions, some longer, some shorter, of the twenty-four hours;\r\nsuch as--darkness departs; dawn breaks; light advances (magumagana);\r\nthe sun about to rise (sisilang na ang arao); full day (arao na);\r\nsun risen; hen laying; (sun) height of axe; height of spear (from\r\nthe horizon); midday; sun sinking; sun set (lungmonorna); Ave Maria\r\ntime; darkness; blackness; children's bed-time; animas ringing;\r\nmidnight near; midnight; midnight past (mababao sa hating gaby). And\r\nthe phraseology varies in different localities. As bell-ringing and\r\nclock-striking were introduced by the Spaniards, most of the terms\r\nnow in use must have been employed before their arrival.\r\n\r\nRepetitions of the same syllable are common both in the Tagál and\r\nBisayan languages. They are not necessarily indicative of a plural\r\nform, but frequently denote sequence or continuation, as--lavay\r\nlavay, slavery (continued work); iñgiliñgil, the growl of a dog;\r\nñgiñgiyao ñgiñgiyao, the purring of a cat; cococococan, a hen calling\r\nher chickens; pocto pocto, uneven, irregular (there is a Devonshire\r\nword, scory, having exactly the same meaning); timbon timbon, piling\r\nup; punit punit, rags; añgao añgao, an infinite number; aling aling,\r\nchangeable; caval caval, uncertain. Some Spanish words are doubled to\r\navoid being confounded with native sounds; as dondon for don. These\r\nrepetitions are a necessary consequence of the small number of\r\nprimitive words.\r\n\r\nThough the poverty of the language is remarkable, yet a great variety\r\nof designations is found for certain objects. Rice, for example,\r\nin the husk is palay (Malay, padi); before transplanting, botobor;\r\nwhen beginning to sprout, buticas; when the ear appears, basag; in a\r\nmore advanced stage, maymota; when fully ripe in ear, boñgana; when\r\nborne down by the wind or the weight of the ear, dayapa; early rice,\r\ncavato; sticky rice, lagquitan; ill-formed in the grain, popong; rice\r\ncleaned but not separated from the husks, loba; clean rice, bigas;\r\nwaste rice, binlor; ground rice, digas; roasted rice, binusa; roasted\r\nto appear like flowers, binuladac; rice paste, pilipig; fricasseed\r\nrice, sinaing; another sort of prepared rice, soman. There are no less\r\nthan nineteen words for varieties of the same object. And so with\r\nverbs:--To tie, tali; to tie round, lingquis; to tie a belt, babat;\r\nto tie the hands, gapus; to tie a person by the neck, tobong; to tie\r\nwith a noose, hasohaso; to tie round a jar, baat; to tie up a corpse,\r\nbalacas; to tie the mouth of a purse, pogong; to tie up a basket,\r\nbilit; to tie two sticks together, pangcol; to tie up a door, gacot;\r\nto tie up a bundle (as of sticks), bigquis; to tie up sheaves of grain,\r\ntangcas; to tie up a living creature, niquit; to tie the planks of a\r\nfloor together, gilaguir; a temporary tie, balaguir; to tie many times\r\nround with a knot, balaguil; tight tie, yaguis; to tie bamboos, dalin;\r\nto tie up an article lent, pañgayla. Of these twenty-one verbs the\r\nroot of scarcely any is traceable to any noun substantive. For rice\r\nthere are no less than sixty-five words in Bisayan; for bamboo, twenty.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous names for the crocodile. Buaya conveys the idea\r\nof its size from the egg to the full-grown animal, when he is called\r\nbuayang totoo, a true crocodile. For gold there are no less than\r\nfifteen native designations, which denote its various qualities.\r\n\r\nJuan de Noceda gives twenty-nine words as translations of mirar\r\n(to look); forty-two for meter (to put); seventy-five for menear (to\r\nmove); but synonymes are with difficulty found in languages having\r\nno affinity, especially when any abstract idea is to be conveyed.\r\n\r\nIn family relations the generic word for brother is colovong; elder\r\nbrother, cacang: if there be only three, the second is called colovong;\r\nthe third, bongso: but if there be more than three, the second is\r\nnamed sumonor; the third, colovong. Twin brothers are cambal. Anac\r\nis the generic name for son; an only son, bogtong; the first-born,\r\npañganay; the youngest, bongso; an adopted son, ynaanac. Magama\r\nmeans father and son united; magcunaama, father and adopted son;\r\nnagpapaama, he who falsely calls another his father; pinanamahan,\r\na falsely called father; maanac, father or mother of many children;\r\nmaganac, father, mother and family of children (of many); caanactilic,\r\nthe sons of two widowers; magca, brothers by adoption.\r\n\r\nA common ironical expression is, Catalastasan mo aya a! (How very\r\nclever!)\r\n\r\nThe Indian name for the head of a barrio, or barangay, is dato,\r\nbut the word more commonly used at present is the Castilian cabeza;\r\nso that now the Indian generally denominates this native authority\r\ncabeza sa balañgay. The Tagal word for the principal locality of a\r\ndistrict is doyo, in Castilian, cabazera.\r\n\r\nThe word cantar has been introduced for the music of the Church, but\r\nmany of the ancient Indian words have been retained, such as Pinanan\r\numbitanan ang patay.--They sing the death-song; dayao, the song of\r\nvictory; hune, the song of birds. The noise of the ghiko lizard is\r\ncalled halotictic.\r\n\r\nThe following may serve as specimens of Tagál polysyllabic words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Anagnalaláqui                   son.\r\n    Ananababai                      daughter.\r\n    Cababulaánang                   lie.\r\n    Malanuingiolog                  thunder.\r\n    Pagsisisi                     | suffering.\r\n    Paghahanducan                 |\r\n    Pagsisingsiñgan                 finger.\r\n    Pagpapahopa                     peace.\r\n    Palayanglayañgan                swallow.\r\n    Pañgañganyaya                   damage.\r\n    Sangtinacpan                    the world.\r\n    Solonmañgayao                   comet; exhalation.\r\n    Magbabaca                     | warrior, from baca to light.\r\n    Tagupagbaca                   |\r\n    Tangcastancasan                 faggot.\r\n    Masaquit angmangapilipis anco   my head aches.\r\n    Hahampasinguita                 I will flog thee (thou\r\n                                    shalt be flogged by me).\r\n    Guiguisiñgincata                I will wake thee (thou\r\n                                    shalt be waked by me).\r\n    Magpasavalabanhangan            everlasting.\r\n    Pananangpahataya                faith.\r\n    Mapagpaunbabao                  deceitful.\r\n    Mapagpalamara                   ungrateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nOdd numbers in Tagál are called gangsal, even numbers tocol.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Affirmative, Yes!               Oo; tango.\r\n    Negative, No!                   Di; dili; houag; dakan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany Malayan words are to be traced, some in their pure, others in\r\na corrupted form, not only in the Tagal and Bisayan, but in other\r\nidioms of the Philippines. [26] Such are Langit, heaven; puti, white;\r\nmata, eye; vato, stones; mura, cheap; and some others. Slightly\r\nmodified are dita for lina, language; babi, for babuy, pig; hagin\r\n(Tag.) and hangin (Bis.) for angin, wind; masaguit for sakit, sick;\r\npatay for mati (Mal.), mat (Pers.), dead; nagcasama for samasama,\r\nin company; matacut for takot, fear; ulan for udian, rain; and a\r\nfew others. The Malay word tuan, meaning honourable, and generally\r\nemployed to signify the obedience and deference of the speaker to the\r\nperson addressed, is mostly used by the Tagals in an ironical sense. Ay\r\ntouan co! Honourable man indeed! \"Do not tuan me,\" is equivalent to,\r\n\"None of your nonsense.\"\r\n\r\nThe monks have introduced most of the Castilian words of Greek and\r\nLatin origin necessary for the profession of the Catholic faith,\r\nor the celebration of its religious rites, for few of which could\r\nany representatives be found in the aboriginal tongues.\r\n\r\nConsidering the long possession of many portions of the Philippines by\r\ntribes professing Mahomedanism, the number of current Arabic words is\r\nsmall: I heard salam, salute; malim, master; arrac, wine or spirits;\r\narraes for reis, captain. And among the Mussulmans of Mindanao, Islam,\r\nkoran, rassoul (prophet), bismillah, kitab, and other words immediately\r\nconnected with the profession of Islamism, were quite familiar.\r\n\r\nThe only Chinese word that I found generally in use was sampan,\r\na small boat, meaning literally three planks.\r\n\r\nMany of the sounds in the Tagal are so thoroughly English that\r\nthey fell strangely on my ear. Toobig is water; and asin, salt, when\r\nshouted out to the Indian servants at table, somewhat startled me, and\r\nI could not immediately find out what was the excess denounced, or the\r\npeccadillo committed. Most of the friars speak the native idioms with\r\nfluency, never preach in any other, and living, as most of them do,\r\nwholly surrounded by the Indian population, and rarely using their\r\nnative Spanish tongue, it is not to be wondered at that they acquire\r\ngreat facility in the employment of the Indian idioms. Most of the\r\nexisting grammars and dictionaries were written by ecclesiastics to\r\naid in the propagation of the Christian doctrine, and small books\r\nare printed (all on religious subjects) for the instruction of the\r\npeople. I could not discover that they have any historical records\r\nor traditions brought down from a remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe more my attention has been directed to the study of the idioms\r\nof distant countries, the more I am struck by the absurd fancies\r\nand theories which have obtained so much currency with regard to\r\nthe derivation and affinities of languages. The Biscayans firmly\r\nhold their Euscaran idiom to have been the tongue of Adam and Eve in\r\nParadise, and consequently the universal language of primitive man\r\nand the fountain-head of all others. More than one Cambrian patriot\r\nhas claimed the same honour for the Welsh, insisting that all the\r\ndialects of the world have been derived from the Cymri. But it would\r\nbe hard to prove that a single word has descended to the present times\r\nfrom the antediluvian world. Intercourse and commerce seem the only\r\nchannels through which any portion of the language of any one nation\r\nor tribe has passed into the vocabulary of any other. The word sack\r\nis said to be that of the most general diffusion. A French writer\r\ncontends it was the only word preserved at the time of the Babel\r\nconfusion of languages, and it was so preserved in order that the\r\nrights of property might be respected in the general anarchy. In the\r\nlower numerals of remote dialects there are many seemingly strange\r\naffinities, which may be attributed to their frequent use in trading\r\ntransactions. Savages, having no such designations of their own, have\r\nfrequently adopted the higher decimal numbers employed by civilized\r\nnations, of which the extended use of the word lac for 10,000 is an\r\nexample. Muster, among trading nations, is, with slight variations,\r\nthe almost universally received word for pattern; so the words account,\r\ndate, and many similar. How many maritime terms are derived from the\r\nDutch, how many military from the French, how many locomotive from the\r\nEnglish! The Justinian code has impregnated all the languages of Europe\r\nwith phrases taken from the Roman law. To the Catholic missal may be\r\ntraced in the idioms of converted nations almost all their religious\r\nphraseology. In the facilities of combination which the Greek in so\r\nhigh a degree possesses science has found invaluable auxiliaries. Our\r\ncolonies are constantly adding to our stores, and happily there is not\r\n(as in France) any repugnance to the introduction of useful, still\r\nless of necessary words. Bentham used to say that purity of language\r\nand poverty of language were nearly synonymous. It is well for the\r\ninterests of knowledge that the English tongue receives without\r\ndifficulty new and needful contributions to the ancient stock. The\r\nwell of pure English undefiled is not corrupted, but invigorated,\r\nby the streams which have been poured into it from springs both\r\nadjacent and remote. Language must progress with and accommodate\r\nitself to the progress of knowledge, and it is well that a language\r\nclear, defined and emphatic as our own--derived from many sources,\r\nwhence its plasticity and variety--having much monosyllabic force\r\nand polysyllabic cadence--condensed and yet harmonious--should be\r\nthe language having now the strongest holds and the widest extension.\r\n\r\nAmong the evidences of progress which the world exhibits, not\r\nonly is the gradual extinction of the inferior by the advance of\r\nthe superior races of man a remarkable fact, but equally striking\r\nis the disappearance of the rude and imperfect idioms, and their\r\nsupplantation by the more efficient instruments of advancement and\r\ncivilization found in the languages of the cultivated nations. The\r\nattempts which have been made to introduce the phraseology of advanced\r\narts and sciences into tongues which only represent a low stage of\r\ncultivation, have been lamentably unsuccessful. No appropriate niches\r\ncan be found in barbarian temples for the beautiful productions of\r\nthe refined genius of sculpture. The coarse garments of the savage\r\ncannot be fitly repaired with the choice workmanship of the gifted\r\nartisan. And few benefits can be conceived of more importance to the\r\nwell-being of the human family than that the means of oral intercourse\r\nshould be extended, and that a few widely spread languages (if not a\r\nuniversal one, whose introduction may be deemed an utterly hopeless\r\ndream) will in process of time become the efficient instrument of\r\ncommunication for the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of the Tagals is in quantity of twelve syllables. They\r\nhave the Spanish asonante, but words are considered to rhyme if they\r\nhave the same vowel or the same consonant at a terminal, as thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        In beautiful starlight\r\n        Heaven's concave is drest,\r\n        And the clouds as they part\r\n        Make the brightness more bright.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo stick would rhyme with thing, knot with rob; and the Indian always\r\nchant their verses when they recite them, which, indeed, is a generally\r\nreceived Asiatic custom. The San tze King, or three-syllable classic,\r\nwhich is the universally employed elementary book in the schools of\r\nChina, is always sung, and the verse and music naturally aid the\r\nmemory. The music of the song sung by the Tagálas to tranquillize\r\nchildren, called the helehele, De Mas says, resembles that of the Arab.\r\n\r\nI have found a few proverbs in verse, of which these are examples:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIsda acong yaga saprap          Weak men, by the helping aid\r\nGalataliptip calapad            Of the mighty, strong are made.\r\nCaya naquiqui pagpusag\r\nAng cala goyo y apahap.\r\n\r\nAba ayá casampaga               It is a very careless hen,\r\nNang ponay na olila             Who will not stretch her pinions when\r\nUn umumbo y pagscap na          The young brood for protection fly\r\nValan magsopcop na ma.

Tolluntur in altum ut lapsu\r\n                                graviore ruant.--Claud.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.--The chapter I had written on the language of the Philippines\r\nwas, with many others of my MSS., submerged in the Red Sea by the\r\nAlma wreck, and much of their contents is utterly illegible; nor have\r\nI been able, from any materials accessible to me in this country, to\r\npresent anything like a satisfactory sketch. Under the circumstances,\r\nmy short-comings will, I doubt not, be forgiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNATIVE PRODUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leyes de Indias emphatically recognize the wrongs and injuries\r\nof which the Indians are constantly the victims, and seek to furnish\r\nremedies against them: they annul dishonest contracts--they order the\r\nauthorities rigorously to punish acts of oppression--they declare\r\nthat the transactions of the Spanish settlers have frequently been\r\n\"the ruin of the Indians\"--they point out the mischiefs produced by\r\nthe avarice in some cases, and inaction in others, of the mestizos,\r\nwho are commonly the go-betweens in bargains of colonists with\r\nnatives. The local ordenanzas, which are numerous and elaborate,\r\nhave for their object to assure to the Indian the fruits of his\r\nlabours--to protect him against his own imprudence and the usurious\r\nexactions of those to whom he applies in his difficulties; they\r\nprovide against the usurpation of his lands, declare the sovereign\r\nthe rightful owner of property which there are no heirs to claim,\r\nand insist that everywhere the Indian shall draw from the soil he\r\ncultivates the means of comfortable subsistence: the accumulation\r\nof properties acquired from the Indians by ecclesiastical bodies is\r\nprohibited, notwithstanding which prohibition enormous estates are\r\nheld by the monkish fraternities. There are also arrangements for\r\nsetting apart \"common lands\" for general use, independently of private\r\nestates. Many of the provisions are of so vague a character as to\r\ninsure their non-observance, and others so particular and special in\r\ntheir requirements as to make their enforcement impossible. The 71st\r\narticle, for example, compels the Indians \"to plant useful trees,\r\nsuited to the soil\"--to sow wheat, rice, maize, vegetables, cotton,\r\npepper, &c., in proper localities--to maintain \"every species of\r\nappropriate cattle\"--to have \"fruits growing in their gardens and\r\norchards round their houses\"--to keep \"at least twelve hens and one\r\ncock\" (a very superfluous piece of legislation), and one \"female\r\nsucking pig;\" they must be encouraged to manufacture cloths and\r\ncordage; and failing in these duties for the space of two years,\r\nthey are to lose their lands, which, by public proclamation,\r\nshall be appropriated to others. There is, in fact, no absolute\r\nterritorial right of property among the Indians. It can always be\r\nseized and reappropriated by the Spanish authorities. Lands are held\r\non condition that they are cultivated. There are lands possessed\r\nby Spaniards and by corporations of the clergy principally, which\r\npay a nominal rental to the crown, but the rental is so small as\r\nto be of no account. There is no difficulty in obtaining gratuitous\r\nconcessions of territorial surface on the sole obligation of bringing\r\nit into cultivation. Long usage and long possession have no doubt\r\ncreated supposed rights, which are able to maintain themselves even\r\nagainst competing private claims or the obvious requirements of public\r\nutility. Questions arise as to what is meant by \"cultivation,\" and\r\nthe country is full of controversies and lawsuits, of which land is\r\ngenerally the subject-matter. The larger proprietors constantly speak\r\nof the difficulty of obtaining continuous labour--of the necessity of\r\nperpetual advances to the peasant--of the robbery of the ripe harvests\r\nwhen raised. Hence they are accustomed to underlet their lands to petty\r\ncultivators, who bring small and unsatisfactory returns to the owners\r\nand to the market. They complain of the jealousy and ill-will of the\r\nIndians, their intrigues and open resistance to foreign settlers, and\r\nof the too indulgent character of the \"Law of the Indies.\" It appears\r\nto me that there is abundant field for advantageous agricultural\r\nexperiments, not perhaps so much in the immediate vicinity of large and\r\npopulous places, as on the vast tracts of uncared-for territory, which\r\ndemand nothing but attention and capital, perseverance and knowledge,\r\nto render a prodigal return. No doubt the agriculturist should have\r\npossession absolutely and irrevocably secured to him. Once installed\r\nby the government he must be protected against all molestation of his\r\ntitle. I do not believe in the invincible inertness of the Indians\r\nwhen they are properly encouraged. I heard of a native in one of the\r\nmost distant villages I visited in Pinay, who had been recommended\r\nby a friar to take to sugar-growing. He did so, and obtained five\r\nhundred dollars for the produce which he, for the first time, took\r\ndown to Iloilo. He will get a thousand the second year; and others\r\nwere following his example. A little additional labour produces\r\nso much that the smallest impulse gives great results, especially\r\nwhere employed over a vast extent. But Indian indolence is not only\r\nprejudicial from the little assistance it offers to agricultural\r\nactivity in preparing, sowing, watching and gathering the harvest;\r\nit is unable to furnish any of those greater appliances which must\r\nbe considered rather of public than of private concern. Hence the\r\nabsence of facilities for irrigation, the imperfect state of the\r\nriver navigation, the rarity of canals, the badness of the roads in\r\nso many localities. The seasons bring their floods, and the mountain\r\ntorrents create their gullies; but the water escapes into the sea,\r\nand the labourer brings his produce, as best he may, amidst the rocks\r\nand sand and mud which the cataracts have left behind them. I have\r\nseen beasts of burden struggling in vain to extricate themselves,\r\nwith their loads, from the gulf into which they had fallen, and in\r\nwhich they were finally abandoned by their conductors. I have been\r\ncarried to populous places in palanquins, whose bearers, sometimes\r\nsixteen in number, were up to their thighs amidst mire, slough,\r\ntangled roots, loose stones and fixed boulders. De Mas says that\r\nthe labourer absorbs three-fifths of the gross produce, leaving\r\ntwo-fifths to the proprietor and capitalist; but the conditions of\r\nlabour are so very various that it is difficult to reach any general\r\nconclusion, beyond the undoubted fact that neither capitalist nor\r\nlabourer receives anything like the amount of profit which, under a\r\nbetter system, would be enjoyed by both; that the cost is far greater,\r\nand the returns far smaller, than they should be; and that the common\r\nprosperity suffers from the position of each. Whatever may be said\r\nof the enervating effects of climate and the want of motive to give\r\nactivity to industry, it is probable that all nations, even the most\r\nindustrious and the most opulent, have passed through their stages of\r\nindolence and inactivity. China affords an example that climate alone\r\nis no insuperable barrier to energetic exertions in all departments\r\nof the field of production, and that the possession of much is no\r\nnecessary check upon the desire of obtaining and enjoying more. The\r\nvalue of lands is very various. De Mas says that the quiñon (of 1,000\r\nsquare fathoms), in Pangasinan, sells for from 220 to 250 dollars;\r\nin the Laguna, 250 to 300; in Ilocos Sur, 300; in the neighbourhood\r\nof Manila, 1,000. He seems to consider sugar as, on the whole,\r\nthe most profitable investment. He gives several tables of the cost\r\nand charges of sundry tropical productions, but the many elements\r\nof uncertainty, the cost of raising, the vicissitudes of climate,\r\nthe attacks of insects, the fluctuations in the amount and value of\r\naccessible labour, and all the ebbs and flows of supply and demand,\r\nmake all calculations only approximative. His apuntes, however, are\r\nwell worth consulting by those interested in detailed inquiry. He gives\r\nas a result of rice cultivation a minimum profit of 24 per cent., a\r\nmaximum profit of 76 per cent. per annum. This would seem sufficiently\r\ninviting, especially as the Spaniards are reported to be fonder of\r\nagriculture than of any other pursuit, and fonder of being owners of\r\nlands than of any other property, according to their old refrain:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"No vessel on the sea,\r\n    But the house that's mine for me,\r\n    And all the lands around which I've been used to see.\" [27]\r\n\r\n\r\nIndigo will render, according to De Mas, 100 per cent. Coffee, on the\r\nsame authority, will double its capital in four years. Cocoa returns\r\n90 per cent. Attempts to introduce mulberry cultivation for silk have\r\nhad little success, though the specimens sent to Europe have obtained\r\nprizes for their excellent quality. The worms require a more continuous\r\nattention than the Indians are willing to give, and the same may be\r\nsaid of those spices, nutmegs, cinnamon, and any produce which demands\r\nunremitting care. The spontaneous productions of the Philippines do\r\nnot easily obtain the benefit of a more enlightened mode of culture.\r\n\r\nThe rights of property require thorough investigation and recognition\r\nin a country which has not been surveyed or cadastred; where the\r\nforeign population is migratory and uncertain; where documentary titles\r\nare, for the most part, wanting, and appropriation of the soil has\r\nbeen little controlled by the supreme authorities; where there is no\r\nland-tax, and the religious bodies hold immense territories generally\r\nunderlet to the natives. The smallness of estates necessarily adds\r\nto the cost of production, and it would not be easy to induce wealthy\r\ncapitalists to settle unless facilities were given for the acquisition\r\nand cultivation of extensive properties. Such capitalists would\r\nintroduce the improvements in agricultural science which are now\r\nwholly wanting; they would bring with them able heads and hands to\r\nconduct, and better instruments to give practical effect to superior\r\nknowledge. A desire is frequently expressed for the formation of\r\nagricultural societies, but these are rather the children than the\r\nparents of progress, and the numerous and respectable body which\r\nalready exists in Manila, the \"Sociedad Economica,\" has not been\r\ninstrumental in introducing any very important changes. There is in\r\nthe Spanish mind too great a disposition to look to \"authority\" as the\r\nsource and support of all reforms; but the best service of authority\r\nin almost all cases of productive industry is non-interference and\r\ninaction; it is not the meddling with, but the leaving matters alone,\r\nthat is wanted; it is the removal of restrictions, the supersession\r\nof laws which profess to patronize and protect, but whose patronage\r\nand protection mean the sacrifice of the many to the few. Government,\r\nno doubt, can greatly assist the public weal by the knowledge it\r\ncan collect and distribute. Nothing is more desirable than that\r\nthe rich territorial capabilities of the Philippines should be\r\nthoroughly explored by efficient scientific inquiry. Geologists,\r\nchemists, mechanicians, botanists, would teach us much respecting\r\nthe raw materials of these multitudinous islands, so inviting to the\r\nexplorer, and so little explored. Mountains, forests, plains, lakes,\r\nrivers, solicit the investigation, which they could not fail to reward.\r\n\r\nOf the indigenous productions found by the Spaniards the dry mountain\r\nrice seems to have been the principal article cultivated by the\r\nIndians for food, the arts of irrigation being little known, and the\r\nmode of culture of the simplest character. The missionaries taught\r\nthe Indians to divide their lands, to improve their agriculture,\r\nto store their harvests, and generally to meliorate their condition\r\nby more knowledge and foresight. Maize and wheat were introduced from\r\nAmerica, though for a long time the use of wheaten bread was confined\r\nto the service of the mass. There is now an adequate supply for the\r\nwants of the consumer. Melons, water-melons and various fruits,\r\npeas, pumpkins, onions, cucumbers, garlic and other vegetables,\r\nsoon found their way from Mexico to the church gardens, and thence\r\nto more extensive cultivation. Coffee sprang up wild in the island\r\nof Luzon, ungathered by the natives. Tobacco was introduced under\r\nthe patronage of the government, and is become the most important\r\nsource of revenue. Pepper and cassia grew unnoticed, but the cocoa-nut\r\ntree and the plantain were among the most precious of the Indian's\r\npossessions, and the areca was not less valued. Indigo was indigenous,\r\nand the wild cotton-tree was uncared for; nor can it be other than a\r\nsubject of regret that to the present hour so inadequate an attention\r\nhas been paid to the natural production of the islands, and means so\r\nlittle efficient taken for improving their quality or extending their\r\ncultivation. At the present time there are few large estates having\r\nthe benefit of well-directed labour and sufficient capital. Of those\r\npossessed by the religious communities little can be expected in the\r\nway of agricultural improvement, but the cultivated lands are generally\r\nin the hands of small native proprietors. Where the labourer is hired,\r\nhis daily pay is from a half rial to a rial and a half (3 1/2d. to\r\n10d.), varying in the different provinces.\r\n\r\nThe quiñon is the ordinary measure of land; it is divided into 10\r\nbaletas, these into 100 loanes, which represent 31,250 Castilian\r\nvaras. Three labourers are supposed sufficient for the cultivation\r\nof a quiñon. In 1841 the Captain-General Urbiztondo published a\r\ndecree encouraging the importation of Chinese agricultural labourers\r\nby landed proprietors, and with a special view to the cultivation\r\nof sugar, indigo and hemp. The decree was expected to produce a\r\nbeneficial revolution--it has been a dead letter. Imported labour,\r\nsubject to all sorts of restrictions, cannot in the long run compete\r\nwith free indigenous labour. The question is a very grave one in its\r\nramifications and influence on colonial interests, when they come into\r\nthe field against the free trade and the free labour of the competing\r\nworld. I doubt altogether the powers of the West Indies--dependent upon\r\nimported and costly immigrants--to rival the rich fields of the East,\r\nwhen capital and activity shall turn to account their feracious soil,\r\nmore genial climate, and more economical means of production. Progress\r\nthere is but the natural development of the elements which Providence\r\nhas allotted to them, whereas in the West India colonies everything\r\nis forced and unnatural, purchased at an immense cost and maintained\r\nby constant sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe money value of the tobacco grown in the Philippines is estimated at\r\nfrom 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 of dollars, say 1,000,000l. sterling. Of\r\nthis nearly one half is consumed in the islands, one-quarter is\r\nexported in the form of cheroots (which is the Oriental word for\r\ncigars), and the remainder sent to Spain in leaves and cigars,\r\nbeing estimated as an annual average contribution exceeding 800,000\r\ndollars. The sale of tobacco is a strict government monopoly,\r\nbut the impossibility of keeping up any efficient machinery for the\r\nprotection of that monopoly is obvious even to the least observant. The\r\ncultivator, who is bound to deliver all his produce to the government,\r\nfirst takes care of himself and his neighbours, and secures the best\r\nof his growth for his own benefit. Out of the capital of Manila\r\nscarcely anything is smoked but the cigarro ilegitimo; and in the\r\ncapital you frequently get a hint that \"the weed\" is not from the\r\nestanco real. From functionaries able to obtain the best which\r\nthe government brings to market, a present is often volunteered,\r\nwhich shows that they avail themselves of something better than that\r\nbest. And in discussing the matter with the most intelligent of the\r\nempleados, they agreed that the emancipation of the producer, the\r\nmanufacturer and the seller, and the establishment of a simple duty,\r\nwould be more productive to the revenue than the present vexatious\r\nand inefficient system of privilege.\r\n\r\nThere has been an enormous increase in the revenues from tobacco. They\r\ngave nett--\r\n\r\n                                                       Annual Average.\r\n\r\n  From 1782 to 1785                  260,597 dolls.      86,865 dolls.\r\n  From 1786 to 1800   (15 years)   4,950,101 dolls.     330,006 dolls.\r\n  From 1801 to 1815   (15 years)   7,228,071 dolls.     481,871 dolls.\r\n  From 1816 to 1830   (15 years)   8,403,368 dolls.     560,225 dolls.\r\n  From 1831 to 1835    (5 years)   3,707,164 dolls.     741,433 dolls.\r\n  From 1836 to 1839    (4 years)   4,990,011 dolls.   1,247,503 dolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince when the produce has more than quadrupled in value.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the deliveries were 50,000 bales (of two arrobas), of which\r\nGapan furnished 47,000, and Cagayan 2,000. In 1841 Cagayan furnished\r\n170,000 bales; Gapan, 84,000; and New Biscay, 34,000. But the produce\r\nis enormously increased; and so large is the native consumption,\r\nof which a large proportion pays no duty, that it would not be\r\neasy to make even an approximative estimate of the extent and value\r\nof the whole tobacco harvest. Where the fiscal authorities are so\r\nscattered and so corrupt;--where communications are so imperfect\r\nand sometimes wholly interrupted;--where large tracts of territory\r\nare in the possession of tribes unsubdued or in a state of imperfect\r\nsubjection;--where even among the more civilized Indians the rights\r\nof property are rudely defined, and civil authority imperfectly\r\nmaintained;--where smuggling, though it may be attended with some\r\nrisk, is scarcely deemed by anybody an offence, and the very highest\r\nfunctionaries themselves smoke and offer to their guests contraband\r\ncigars, on account of their superior quality,--it may well be supposed\r\nthat lax laws, lax morals and lax practices, harmonize with each other,\r\nand that such a state of things as exists in the Philippines must be\r\nthe necessary, the inevitable result. It is sufficient to look at the\r\ncost of the raw material and the value of the manufactured article\r\nto perceive what an enormous margin of profit there exists. A quintal\r\nof tobacco will produce--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              Dollars.\r\n    14 cases, each containing 1,000 cigars, whose value is,\r\n    at 6 1/2 dolls. per case                                    87·50\r\n    The quintal of tobacco costs         5·00 dolls.\r\n    Manufacture                          5·25 dolls.\r\n    14 cases at 2 rials                  3·50 dolls.\r\n                                                                13·75\r\n                                                                -----\r\n                                                  Profit        73·75\r\n\r\n\r\nCheroots (cigars) are manufactured in two forms,--that of the Havana,\r\nthe smaller end being twisted to a point,--or cut at both ends, the\r\nusual Manila form. They are of sundry qualities, as follows:--Largest\r\nsize, 125 to a box--1st Regalias, 1st Caballeros and Londres; second\r\nsize, 250 to a box--2nd Regalias and 1st Cortados, 2nd Caballeros,\r\n1st Havanas (ordinary size, and such as are more commonly used,\r\nNos. 2 and 3 being those in most demand); 500 to a box--Nos. 2, 3, 4,\r\nand 5 Havanas, 2 and 3 Cortados. Besides these, enormous quantities of\r\npaper cigars (cigarillos) are consumed by the natives. They are sold\r\nin packets of twenty-five, at 5 cuartes; thirty, at 5 1/3 cuartes;\r\nthirty-six, at 5 5/7 cuartes.\r\n\r\nThe estanco prices for these cigars are, per box--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    Dollars.\r\n\r\n    Imperiales              box contains 125 cigars   3·750\r\n    Regalias and Caballeros box contains 125 cigars   3·125\r\n    1 Havanas, 1 Cortados   box contains 250 cigars   3·500\r\n    2 Havanas, 2 Cortados   box contains 500 cigars   4·000\r\n    3 Havanas, 3 Cortados   box contains 500 cigars   3·500\r\n    4 Havanas,              box contains 500 cigars   3·000\r\n    5 Havanas,              box contains 500 cigars   2·500\r\n    Londres                 box contains 125 cigars   1·875\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon these minimum prices biddings take place at the monthly public\r\nauctions. So large is the demand that it is difficult to obtain any but\r\nfresh cigars, which require to be kept for two or three years to ripen.\r\n\r\nThe collection of tobacco and the manufacture of cigars are under the\r\ncharge of an administration whose head-quarters are in Manila. The\r\nwarehouses are of immense extent, and 20,000 persons probably find\r\noccupation in the preparation of this article of luxury, to say nothing\r\nof those employed in its production. The provinces in which there are\r\nestablishments for the collection are Cagayan, La Isabela, New Ecija,\r\nLa Union, Abra and Cayan. The largest of the manufactures of cigars\r\nare in Binondo (Manila) and Cavite, in the province of the same name.\r\n\r\nFr. Blanco thus describes the Nicotiana tabacum of the Philippines:\r\n\"It is an annual, growing to the height of a fathom, and furnishes the\r\ntobacco for the estancos (licensed shops). Here, as everywhere else,\r\nits quality and taste vary. General opinion prefers the tobacco of\r\nGapan, but that of the Pasy districts, Laglag and Lambunao, in Iloilo,\r\nof Maasin or Leyte, is appreciated for its fine aroma; also that of\r\nCagayan, after being kept for some years,--for otherwise, like the\r\ntobacco of the island of Negros, it burns the mouth. It is a narcotic,\r\nand will subdue recent tumours. It is salutary when smoked, and even a\r\nnecessity in these regions; it disperses phlegm, protects from the bad\r\nconsequences of humidity and the morning dews, and is only injurious to\r\nhealth when used in excess. Snuff relieves from headaches and disperses\r\ngloomy humours. A small piece of smoked tobacco at the end of a stick\r\napplied to the nose of the lizard, which is here called the chacon\r\n(probably the ghiko), causes its instant death. A cruel practice,\"\r\n(adds the father), \"for the reptile is most useful, destroying\r\ncockroaches, centipedes, mice and other vermin; besides which its\r\nsong may cheer the timid, who believe that while that song lasts\r\nthere will be no earthquakes nor any excess of rain.\"--(Pp. 74-75.)\r\n\r\nI am informed by the alcalde mayor of Cagayan that he sent last year\r\n(1858) to Manila from that province tobacco for no less a value than\r\n2,000,000 dollars. The quality is the best of the Philippines; it is\r\nall forwarded in leaf to the capital. He speaks of the character of\r\nthe Indians with great admiration, and says acts of dishonesty are\r\nvery rare among them, and that property is conveyed in perfect safety\r\nthrough the province. The quantity of leaf transmitted was 300,000\r\nbales, divided into seven qualities, of which the prices paid were from\r\ntwo to seven rials per quintal, leaving a large margin of profit. The\r\ntobacco used by the natives is not subject to the estanco, and on\r\nmy inquiring as to the cost of a cigar in Cagayan, the answer was,\r\n\"Casi nada\" (Almost nothing). They are not so well rolled as those of\r\nthe government, but undoubtedly the raw material is of the very best.\r\n\r\nThe demand for the important article of coffee in Australia and\r\nCalifornia will probably hereafter be largely supplied from the\r\nSpanish archipelago. Of the mode of cultivation, there is nothing\r\nparticularly characteristic of the Philippines. The ground having\r\nbeen cleared (where on a large extent, by fire), it is fenced in,\r\nthe soil prepared, and after having been steeped in water for two\r\nor three days, the sprouts are stuck into the holes which had been\r\nmade for their reception, and in the following year are ready for\r\ncutting. The use of the plough largely increases the produce. The\r\ncultivation of sugar is rapidly extending. The harvest takes place\r\ngenerally from March to May. Four groups of labourers are employed:\r\nthe cutters and the carters in the field, the grinders and the boilers\r\nin the manufactory. Improvements are gradually being introduced,\r\nas larger capitalists and more intelligent cultivators come forward;\r\nand the establishment of refineries now in progress will induce many\r\nbeneficial changes. Much of the clayed sugar which I saw delivered\r\nat Manila for refining into loaves had rather the appearance of\r\ndirty mud than of a valuable commodity. Though slowly, the work of\r\nimprovement goes on, and there could be no greater evidence of it than\r\nthe presence of a number of Chinese employed in the various stages\r\nof the fabric. Nor do these Chinese labourers fail to bring with them\r\nmuch practical knowledge. They are mostly from Fokien, a province in\r\nwhich the production of sugar is great, and in which there are large\r\nsugar refineries, mostly, however, for the manufacture of sugar-candy,\r\nwhich is the form in which the Chinese usually purchase the sugar for\r\nconsumption, pounding it into powder. I visited several extensive\r\nestablishments at Chang-chow-foo, about thirty miles from Amoy,\r\na port whence the exportation is large.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of the sugar-cane. The zambales is used\r\nprincipally as food; the encarnado (red), morada (purple), blanca\r\n(white), and listada (striped), give the syrup for manufacture. The\r\nplanting of the sprouts takes place between February and May. Weeds\r\nare removed by ploughing, and the plants ripen in ten or twelve\r\nmonths. In some provinces crops are cultivated for three successive\r\nyears; in others, the soil is allowed to rest an intermediate year,\r\nand maize or other produce grown. When cut, the canes are carried\r\nto mills called by the natives cabayavan, to be crushed. The mills\r\nconsist of two cylindrical stones with teeth of the molave wood; a\r\nbuffalo turns the wheel and the juice is conveyed to the boilers. The\r\nimprovements of the West are being slowly introduced, and sundry\r\neconomical processes have been adopted. Increasing demand, extended\r\ncultivation and, above all, the application of larger capitals and\r\ngreater activity, will, undoubtedly, make the Philippines one of the\r\ngreat producing countries. A variety of tables have been printed,\r\nshowing that the average annual profits on coffee cultivation are\r\nfrom 20 to 30 per cent.; in some provinces considerably more.\r\n\r\nRice being of far more general production, is estimated to give an\r\naverage yearly profit of from 12 to 20 per cent.; sesame returns an\r\naverage of about 20 per cent.; cocoa-nuts may be considered at about\r\nequal to rice in the yearly benefits they leave, but the conditions are\r\nso various that it may be difficult to generalize. It may, however, be\r\nasserted with tolerable certainty, that money employed with ordinary\r\nprudence in agricultural investments will give an interest of from\r\n20 to 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of rice is universal, and the superfluity of the\r\nharvests is taken to the Chinese markets. The varieties of rice have\r\nbeen elsewhere spoken of, but they may be classed under the two general\r\nheads of water and mountain rice. The aquatic rice is cultivated as in\r\nEurope and America; the sowing of the dry rice usually precedes that\r\nof the water rice, and takes place at the end of May. It is usually\r\nbroadcast on the hills, requires to be hoed and weeded, and is ripened\r\nin from three to four months and a half. It is harvested ear by ear.\r\n\r\nFr. Blanco describes four species of water-cultivated (de agua),\r\nand five of mountain-produced (secano) rice. Of the first class, the\r\nlamuyo (Oryza sativa lamuyo) is principally cultivated, especially\r\nin Batangas. The barbed rice (Oryza aristata) grows in Ilocos. Of\r\nthe mountain rice, that called quinanda (Oryza sativa quinanda)\r\nis the most esteemed. The cultivation of the water rice begins\r\nby the preparation of the seed deposits (semillero), into which,\r\nat the beginning of the rainy season, the seed is thrown, after a\r\nthorough impregnation of the ground with water, of which several\r\ninches remain on the surface. Ploughing and harrowing produce a mass\r\nof humid mud. During the growth of the seed, irrigation is continued,\r\nand after six weeks the crops are ready for transplanting to the\r\nrice-fields. Men generally pull up the plants, and convey them to the\r\nfields, where women up to their knees in mire separate the plants,\r\nand place them in holes at a regular distance of about five inches\r\nfrom one another. They are left for some days to take root, when the\r\ngrounds are again irrigated. The rice grows to the height of somewhat\r\nmore than a yard, and after four months is ready for harvest. It\r\nis a common usage to cut every ear separately with an instrument\r\nwhose Indian name is yatap. In some parts a sickle called a lilit is\r\nused. The lilit has a crook by which a number of ears are collected,\r\nand being grasped with the left hand, are cut by the serrated blade\r\nof the sickle held in the right hand. The crops of aquatic rice vary\r\nfrom thirty to eightyfold.\r\n\r\nThe mountain rice is sown broadcast after ploughing and harrowing,\r\nand buffaloes are employed to trample the seed into the ground. More\r\ncare is sometimes taken, and holes made at regular distances, into\r\nwhich three or four grains of rice are dropped. Careful cultivation\r\nand great attention to the removal of weeds are said to produce\r\nhundred-fold crops.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Father Blanco that a third of the rice harvest has\r\nbeen known to perish in consequence of the dilatory and lazy way in\r\nwhich the reaping is conducted.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Philippines offer great facilities for\r\nthe cultivation of indigo, but it has been neglected and inadequate\r\nattention paid to the manufacture. The growers state that there is\r\nin Europe a prejudice against Manila indigo; but such prejudice can\r\nonly be the result of experience, and would be removed by greater care\r\non the part of the growers, manufacturers and exporters. The crops,\r\nhowever, are uncertain, and often seriously damaged or destroyed\r\nby tempestuous weather, and by invasions of caterpillars. The\r\nseed is broadcast, sown immediately after the temperate season. It\r\ngrows rapidly, but requires to have the weeds which spring up with\r\nit cleared away. It is ready for harvesting in the rainy months,\r\ngenerally in June. The fermentation, straining, beating, cleaning,\r\npressing, and final preparation are carried on, not according to the\r\nimproved processes of British India, but as they were introduced by\r\nthe Spaniards. The Indians, like the Chinese, employ the dye in its\r\nliquid state.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of the betel root is incredibly great. There are in\r\nthe city of Manila, in the courts and ground floors of the houses,\r\naltogether 898 warehouses and shops, of which 429 (or nearly half\r\nthe whole) are devoted to the sale of the prepared betel, or to the\r\nmaterials of which it is composed. There are two warehouses where the\r\nleaf in which the areca nut is wrapped is sold wholesale; there are\r\n105 retail shops for the same article, and there are 308 shops in\r\nwhich is sold for immediate use the nut mixed with shell-lime, and\r\nserved with the buyo (leaf of the piper betel), ready for conveyance\r\nto the mouth of the consumer, to whom it is from usage become an\r\narticle of necessity even more urgent than the rice he eats or the\r\nwater he drinks.\r\n\r\nOf the areca, Fr. Blanco, in his Flora de Filipinas, gives the\r\nfollowing account:--\"This species of palm, with which everybody is\r\nacquainted, and which like its fruit is called bonga by the Indians,\r\ngrows to about the average height of the cocoa-nut tree. Its trunk is\r\nsmaller at the base than the top, very straight, with many circular\r\nrings formed by the junction of the leaves before they fall, which\r\nthey do on growing to a certain size. The use of the nut, which is\r\nsomewhat smaller than a hen's egg, is well known. When the bonga is\r\nwanting, the Indians employ the bark of the guava, or of the antipolo\r\n(Artocarpus). Mixed with lime and the pepper leaf, it makes the saliva\r\nred. The Indians apply this saliva to the navel of their children\r\nas a cure for the colic and a protection from the effects of cold\r\nair. When ripe, the fruit is red and, I believe, might be used as a\r\nred dye. With copperas it makes a black dye, but inferior to that of\r\nthe aroma. The lower part of the leaves, called talupac, is very clean,\r\nbroad, white and flexible, making excellent wrappers and serving many\r\nuseful purposes. The sprouts are salted and eaten, and are agreeable\r\nto the taste, but when cut the tree perishes.\"--(P. 495.)\r\n\r\nFather Blanco says of the piper betel (Pimenta betel), whose leaves\r\nare employed as envelopes to the areca nut and lime:--\"This plant is\r\nuniversally known, in consequence of the immense consumption of the\r\nbetel, or buyo, as the betel is called by the Spaniards. The betel of\r\nPasay, near Manila, is much esteemed; that of Banang, in Batangas,\r\nis the best of that province, and probably superior to the betel\r\nof Pasay. The tree prefers a somewhat sandy soil, but if too sandy,\r\nas in Pasay, fish is used as a manure, or the rind of the Ajonjoli\r\n(sesame), or other oleaginous fruits. The tree must be frequently\r\nwatered. The roots are renovated after a year, but if left to grow old\r\nthey produce flowers like the litlit (Piper obliquum). The fruit is\r\ncalled by the natives poro. Of the Piper parvifolium, an inebriating\r\nliquor is made. The Indians use the leaves as a preservative against\r\nthe cholera. All the species of Piper are useful against the poison of\r\nsnakes. The wound is first scarified, and either the juice or bruised\r\nleaves of the plant applied and frequently changed. 'I was called,'\r\nsays the author of the Flora of the Antilles, 'to a negro whose\r\nthigh had just been bitten by a snake. The poison had made frightful\r\nprogress. All the remedies of art had been employed in vain. A negro\r\nappeared, and asked leave to apply the popular mode of cure. There\r\nwas then no hope of the recovery of the patient--human life was at\r\nstake--I did not hesitate. In a few moments the progress of the poison\r\nwas stopped by the simple application of the Piper procumbens. On\r\nthe third application the cure was completed.'\"--(Pp. 16, 17.)\r\n\r\nOf the vegetation of the Philippines, the bamboo may be deemed the\r\nmost extensive, the most useful, and the most beautiful. The graceful\r\ngroups of Cañas (the Spanish name, the Tagál is Bocaui) are among the\r\nmost charming decorations of the island scenery, and are scattered with\r\ngreat profusion and variety on the sides of the streams and rivers,\r\non hills and plains, and always to be found adjacent to the residence\r\nof the native. Waving their light branches at the smallest breeze,\r\nthey give perpetual life to the landscape, while they are of daily\r\nservice to the people. The Bambus arundo grows to a great height,\r\nand its cane is sometimes more than eight inches in diameter. In\r\nit is sometimes found a small stone, called Tabaxir, to which the\r\nIndians attribute miraculous healing virtues. The Bambus lumampao and\r\nthe lima are so hard that the wood is used for polishing brass. The\r\nbamboo serves for an infinity of uses; from the food that nourishes\r\nman or beast, to the weapons that destroy his life: for the comforts of\r\nhome; for the conveniences of travel; for the construction of bridges,\r\nseveral hundred feet in length, over which heavy artillery can safely\r\npass; for shipping and cordage; for shelter, and for dwellings and\r\ndomestic utensils of all sorts; for vessels of every size to retain,\r\nand tubes to convey, water and other fluids; for mats, palings, and\r\nscaffoldings; for musical instruments, even organs for churches; for\r\na hundred objects of amusement; and, indeed, for all the purposes of\r\nlife the bamboo is distinguished. It is the raw material on which\r\nthe rude artist makes his experiments--roots, trunks, branches,\r\nleaves, all are called into the field of utility. There is much\r\nof spontaneous production, but it may be multiplied by layers and\r\ncuttings. Some of the bamboos grow to an enormous size. That called by\r\nthe natives cauayang totoo, and by the Spaniards caña espino, reaches\r\nthe height of from forty to fifty feet, the diameter of the stalk or\r\ntrunk exceeding eight inches. One of its divisions will sometimes hold\r\ntwo pecks of wheat. An infusion of this bamboo is poisonous to deer;\r\nbut its leaves are eaten by horses and cattle and its young shoots\r\nas salad by man. The cauayang quiling (caña macho of the Spaniards)\r\ngrows to about forty feet in height, its stem being of the size of\r\na man's arm. From the thickness of the rind and the smallness of the\r\nhollow, it is the strongest of the bamboos, and is used for carrying\r\nburdens on the shoulders; a fourth part of the whole cane, of the\r\nlength of two yards, when split, will support any weight that a man\r\ncan carry. The cane has an elasticity which lightens the burden to the\r\nbearer. The varieties of the bamboo are scarcely to be counted. The\r\ninterior of the osin gives a white substance, which is used as a cure\r\nfor urinal and eye diseases.\r\n\r\nI once heard a remark that the Crystal Palace itself could have been\r\nfilled with specimens of various applications of the bamboo. Minus the\r\nglass, the palace itself might have been constructed of this material\r\nalone, and the protecting police furnished from it with garments,\r\nhats and instruments of punishment. The living trees would fill a\r\nconservatory with forms and colours of wondrous variety and beauty;\r\nand if paintings and poetry, in which the bamboo takes a prominent\r\nplace, were allowed, not the walls of the Louvre could be sufficient\r\nfor the pictures and the scrolls.\r\n\r\nThe various classes of canes, rattans and others of the Calamus family,\r\nhave a great importance and value. The palasan is frequently three\r\nhundred feet long, and in Mindanao it is said they have been found\r\nof more than treble that length. They are used for cords and cables;\r\nbut as the fibres are susceptible of divisions, down to a very fine\r\nthread, they are woven into delicate textures, some of which, as in\r\nthe case of hats and cigar-cases, are sold at enormous prices. If not\r\nexposed to damp, the fibres are very enduring, and are safe from the\r\nattacks of the weevil.\r\n\r\nThe native name for hemp is anabo, the Spanish, cañamo; but the\r\nraw material known in commerce as Manila hemp, is called in the\r\nPhilippines by its Indian name, abacá. It is become a very important\r\narticle of export, and in the year 1858 no less than 25,000 tons were\r\nshipped for foreign countries from Manila alone. Of this quantity\r\nGreat Britain received about one-fourth, and the greater portion of\r\nthe remainder went to the United States. Next to sugar and tobacco,\r\nit ranks highest in the list of exported produce. It is employed\r\nnot only for cordage, but for textile fabrics. It is the fibre of\r\none of the plantain family--the Musa trogloditarum textoria. Dampier\r\nsays that its growth is confined to the island of Mindanao; but the\r\nquantity there grown is, at the present time, trifling compared to the\r\nproduction of Luzon, Panay, and other islands of the archipelago. The\r\nfiner qualities are in considerable demand for weaving, and these\r\nare, of course, subjected to a more elaborate manipulation. It\r\nreadily receives red and blue dyes; the morinda and marsdenia,\r\nnative plants, being employed for the purpose. The fruit is said to\r\nbe edible, but I am not aware of ever having seen it introduced,\r\nnor would it be likely to compete with the best of the delicious\r\nplantains which the Philippines produce. Father Blanco says that of\r\nthese there are no less than fifty-seven varieties. The native name is\r\nsaguing. Curious traditions are connected with this fruit. The Arabs\r\nsay it was introduced into the world by Allah, when the Prophet lost\r\nhis teeth, and could no longer enjoy the date. It is sometimes called\r\nAdam's apron, on the supposition that it was the plant whose leaves\r\nhe and Eve employed to cover their nakedness. Its use is universal,\r\nboth in its natural state and cooked in various forms.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of Coffee might be largely extended. For that, and\r\nindeed for every tropical produce, there is scarcely a limit to the\r\nunappropriated lands well suited to their production. Some of the\r\ncoffee is of excellent quality, scarcely distinguishable from that\r\nof Arabia, but the general character is less favourable.\r\n\r\nIndeed there is an obvious contrast between the great improvements\r\nwhich have taken place in the Dutch archipelago, the British colonies,\r\nCeylon for example, and the stagnation created by the too stationary\r\nhabits of the Indian producer. He is little attentive to the proper\r\nselection of soil, the temperature or elevation of the ground, the\r\nchoice of the seed, the pruning of the tree, the care of the berry,\r\nthe separation of the outer coatings, and other details, which may help\r\nto account for the comparatively small extension of coffee production,\r\nespecially considering the enormously increased demand for the article,\r\nand the prodigious development of its cultivation in Netherlands India,\r\nCeylon and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Cocoa is excellent, and I have nowhere tasted better\r\nchocolate than in the Philippines, but the tree is principally planted\r\nfor the private use of its possessors. In the convents particularly,\r\nthe friars are proud of their chocolate, which is generally made\r\nunder their own superintendence, and from fruit raised in their own\r\ngrounds and gardens. A little attention is required in the selection\r\nof soil and locality; the fruit is gathered as it ripens, and after\r\nthe removal of the cuticle simply requires to be sun-dried.\r\n\r\nIt is sown in the month of November, and the shade of the banana\r\nis sought for its protection. The cocoa of Zebu is reported to be\r\nequal in excellence to that of the Caracas. In the island of Negros\r\nthere is a large spontaneous production. The Indian soaks the cocoa\r\nin sugar juice, and in many parts the beverage is taken twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe supply of Cotton is one of the most interesting of questions as\r\nregards our manufacturing population, and I have felt surprised at\r\nthe small sagacity, the parva sapientia, which has been exhibited by\r\nmany who have devoted their attention to the matter. The expectation\r\nthat Negroland Africa will be able to fill up the anticipated vacuum\r\nof supply is a vain hope originating in ignorance of the character\r\nand habits of the native races, and it will end in disappointment\r\nand vexation. The capabilities of British India are great, and the\r\nelements of success are there; but the capabilities of China are vastly\r\ngreater, and I believe that as in two or three years China was able to\r\nsend raw silk to the value of ten millions sterling into the market,\r\nand immediately to make up for the absence of the European supply,\r\nso to China we may hereafter look for a boundless supply of raw\r\ncotton; she now clothes more than three hundred and fifty millions\r\nof her people from her own cotton-fields. The prices in China are\r\nso nearly on a level with those of India that though they allow an\r\nimportation to the yearly value of two or three millions sterling in\r\nthe southern provinces of China, importations into the northern are\r\nscarcely known. The quality, the modes of cultivation, of cleaning,\r\nof packing, are all susceptible of great improvements; their interests\r\nwill make the Chinese teachable, and the Yang-tse-Kiang may be the\r\nchannel for the solution of the cotton difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere seems no sufficient reason why cotton wool should not have been\r\nmore largely exported from the Philippines. It is cheaply produced\r\nand might follow the crops of mountain rice. There is a domestic\r\ndemand, and that seems to satisfy the grower, for cotton has almost\r\nceased to be an article of foreign trade. The staple is said to be\r\nshort. The plant is an annual and produces its crop in two or three\r\nmonths after it is sown. It is gathered in the midday sun before the\r\nadvent of the rainy season, which destroys both shrub and seedpod.\r\n\r\nCocoa-nut trees (Cocos nucifera), called Nioc by the Tagals,\r\neminently contribute to the ornament, comfort, and prosperity of\r\nthe natives. Trunks, branches, leaves, fruit, all are turned to\r\naccount. Oil, wine and spirits are made from its juices. The bark is\r\nemployed for caulking and cables; the shell of the cocoa is wrought\r\nand carved in many ways for spoons, cups and domestic utensils; the\r\nburnt shell is employed for dyeing black. The trunk often forms the\r\nframe, the leaves the cover, of the Indian houses. The fibres of the\r\nleaves are manufactured into cloths for garments; the fibres of the\r\nfruit into brushes. The pulp is eaten or made into sweetmeats and the\r\nmilk is esteemed for its medicinal virtues. The root, when roasted,\r\nis used as a decoction for the cure of dysentery.\r\n\r\nA Spanish writer says that an Indian wants nothing but his Cocal\r\n(cocoa-nut palm garden) for his comfortable support. The tree will give\r\nhim water, wine, oil, vinegar, food, cords, cups, brushes, building\r\nmaterials, black paint, soap, roofing for his house, strings for his\r\nrosaries, tow, red dye, medicine, plaister for wounds, light, fire,\r\nand many other necessaries. It produces fruit after seven years'\r\ngrowth. The nipa palm is almost, though not quite as useful. These\r\nspontaneous bounties of nature may not be the allies or promoters of\r\ncivilization, but they are the compensations which make savage life\r\ntolerable and, if not of high enjoyment, not far from happy.\r\n\r\nA very small quantity of Pepper is now grown, though it was formerly\r\none of the most prized productions of the islands. It is said that\r\nthe Indians destroyed all their pepper plantations in consequence of\r\nfrauds practised on them by the Manila merchants.\r\n\r\nAttempts to introduce some of the more costly spices, such as the\r\nCinnamon and Nutmeg, have not been attended with success.\r\n\r\nFruits are abundant. There are no less than fifty-seven varieties\r\nof the banana. The fame of the Manila mango is universal in the\r\nEast. There are many sorts of oranges, pines (ananas) in great\r\nquantities, guavas, rose-apples, and the mangosteen is found in\r\nMindanao. The chico is a favourite fruit in winter, somewhat resembling\r\nthe medlar, hut I must refer those who desire more extended information\r\nto Father Blanco's Flora, imperfect though it be.\r\n\r\nAmong the riches of the Philippine Islands, the forest trees occupy an\r\nimportant place. A collection of 350 specimens was sent to the Royal\r\nExhibition in London in the form of square-based prisms. In the year\r\n1858 Colonel Valdes published a report on the character and resistance\r\nof Philippine woods for buildings (maderas de construction). The\r\nspecimens on which the experiments were made were cubes of one\r\ncentimetre and prisms of one centimetre square by one metre of\r\nbreadth. The woods were allowed one year's drying. Five experiments\r\nwere made on each, and the average results adopted.\r\n\r\nThe abbreviations employed in the following tables, which give a\r\nsynopsis of the results, are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    E   Elasticity.\r\n    F   Strength of cohesion.\r\n    f   Arc of flexion produced by a constant weight of 1 kilogram\r\n        hung from the centre.\r\n    n   Arc at which fracture took place.\r\n    P   Weight applied at the centre of the arc.\r\n    c   Distance between the supporters of the wood: in some 68\r\n        centimetres, in others 60.\r\n        Section of prisms, 1 square centimetre.\r\n        Length of the same, 1 metre.\r\n    R   Weight producing fracture at the bend.\r\n    T   Coefficient of fracture by bending, or of maximum bend.\r\n        Resistance is estimated in the direction of the fibres\r\n        (diagonally) and perpendicularly upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nScale of Resistance and Special Qualities of Woods, extracted from\r\nthe Table, pp. 266-71.\r\n\r\nThose with an asterisk are little used for building, either on account\r\nof their cost, scarcity, or unsuitableness for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------------\r\n                      1.

Immense herds of wild buffaloes are found in the interior,\r\nbut the tamed animal is employed in the labours of the fields and\r\nthe transport of commodities, whether on its back or in waggons. His\r\nenjoyment is to be merged in water or mud. Such is the attachment of\r\nthe mother to her young that she has been known to spring into the\r\nriver and furiously to pursue the crocodile that had robbed her of\r\nher calf. Wild boars and deer abound.\r\n\r\nA good deal of attention has been paid to improvement of the race of\r\nnative ponies, and their value has much increased with the increasing\r\ndemand. Till of late years the price was from forty to fifty dollars,\r\nbut the Captain-General told me that the four ponies which he was\r\naccustomed to use in his carriage cost 500 dollars.\r\n\r\nThough the accounts of the silent, concealed and rapid ravages of the\r\nwhite ants would sometimes appear incredible, credulity respecting\r\nthem will outstrip all bounds. We had a female servant at Hong Kong\r\nwho told us she had lent her savings in hard dollars to one of her\r\nrelations, and, on claiming repayment, was informed that the white\r\nants had eaten the dollars, nor did the woman's simplicity doubt the\r\nstory. In the Philippines at sunset during the rains their presence\r\nbecomes intolerable. One well-authenticated fact may serve as an\r\nillustration of the destructive powers of these insects, to whom\r\nbeautiful gauze wings have been given, as to butterflies in the\r\nlater stage of their existence, which wings drop off as they find a\r\nresting-place. In the town of Obando, province of Bulacan, on the 18th\r\nof March, 1838, the various objects destined for the services of the\r\nmass, such as robes, albs, amices, the garments of the priests, &c,\r\nwere examined and placed in a trunk made of the wood called narra\r\n(Pterocarpus palidus). On the 19th they were used in the divine\r\nservices, and in the evening were restored to the box. On the 20th\r\nsome dirt was observed near it, and on opening, every fragment of the\r\nvestments and ornaments of every sort were found to have been reduced\r\nto dust, except the gold and silver lace, which were tarnished with\r\na filthy deposit. On a thorough examination, not an ant was found in\r\nany other part of the church, nor any vestige of the presence of these\r\nvoracious destroyers; but five days afterwards they were discovered\r\nto have penetrated through a beam six inches thick.\r\n\r\nFew of the larger wild animals are found in the Philippines. The\r\nelephant must have been known in former times, as the names gadya\r\n(elephant) and nangagadya (elephant-hunting) are preserved in\r\nthe Tagal language. Oxen, swine, buffaloes, deer, goats, sheep,\r\na great variety of apes and monkeys, cats, flying squirrels, dogs,\r\nrats, mungoes and other quadrupeds, are found in various stages of\r\ndomesticity and wildness.\r\n\r\nThe great insect pests of the Philippines are the white ants (termes)\r\nand the mosquitos. Fleas, bugs and flies are less numerous and\r\ntormenting than in many temperate regions.\r\n\r\nSome of the bats measure from five to six feet from the tips of\r\ntheir wings.\r\n\r\nThere are incredible stories about a small black bird of the swallow\r\nrace, which is said to make its nest in the tail of wild horses. De Mas\r\nquotes what he calls undoubtedly trustworthy authorities [28] for his\r\narguments. There is an immense variety of gallinaceous fowls, pigeons\r\nand birds, whose Indian names would to European ornithologists bring\r\nlittle information; among which the balicyao is celebrated for its\r\nsong; the mananayom (solitary), which always dies when captured; the\r\ncoling, easily taught to talk; numerous parrots; the calao, which has\r\na large transparent bill and crows like a cock; the bocuit, or bird of\r\nseven colours, which has a singularly sweet note; the valoor, a pigeon\r\nwhose plumage is varied like that of the partridge; another called the\r\ndundunay, which is reported to be one of the most beautiful of birds.\r\n\r\nSnakes, lizards and other reptiles abound; spiders of enormous size,\r\ntarantulas, &c. The guiko is very disturbing, from its noise. I\r\nwas struck with the tenacity with which this creature held, even in\r\nthe agonies of death, to a piece of timber on which it was placed;\r\nthe soles of its feet seemed to have all the power of the sucker\r\nwith which boys amuse themselves, and the animal was detached with\r\ngreat difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe fire-flies illuminate the forests at night. There are some trees\r\nto which they attach themselves in preference to others. Few objects\r\nare more beautiful than a bush or tree lighted by these bright and\r\nglancing stars. The brilliant creatures seem to have a wonderful\r\nsympathy with one another, sometimes by the production of a sudden\r\nblaze of beautiful fire, of a light and delicate green, and sometimes\r\nby its as sudden extinction.\r\n\r\nOf aquatic creatures the tortoise is of considerable commercial\r\nimportance. The natives, who watch the time of their coming on shore,\r\nconceal themselves, and, when a certain number are marching inland,\r\nrun between the tortoises and the waves, turn them one after another\r\non their backs, and return at their leisure to remove them. The large\r\nbivalve called by the natives taclovo, and which is used much in the\r\nchurches as the receptacle for holy water, and is seen frequently\r\nat the entrance of houses, is captured by dropping a cord upon the\r\nbody of the animal when the shell is opened, the animal immediately\r\ncloses upon the cord, and is dragged to the surface with the greatest\r\nease. I am not aware of the existence of any conchological work on the\r\nPhilippines, though there is a great variety of land and water shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mining Laws, Reglamento de Minas, are of a liberal character and\r\nallow concessions to be made to any person, Spaniard, Indian, mestizo,\r\nnaturalized or established foreigner, who shall discover and report\r\nthe discovery of a mine, and undertake to work it. Sundry officials\r\nand all ecclesiastics are excluded from the privilege. The work\r\nmust be entered upon in ninety days, under certain conditions; four\r\nmonths of continued suspension, or eight months of interrupted labour,\r\nwithin the year bring the loss of the conceded privilege. There must\r\nnot be less than eight labourers employed. The mines are subjected\r\nto the inspection of the mining department The mining regulations\r\nwere published by the Captain-General Claveria in January, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe gold of the Philippines is produced by washing and digging. In\r\nseveral of the provinces it is found in the rivers, and natives are\r\nengaged in washing their deposits. The most remarkable and profitable\r\nof the gold mines worked by the Indians are those of Tulbin and\r\nSuyuc. They break the rock with hammers, and crush it between two small\r\nmillstones, dissolving the fragments in water, by which the gold is\r\nseparated. They melt it in small shells, and it produces generally\r\nfrom eight to ten dollars an ounce, but its fineness seldom exceeds\r\nsixteen carats. It is found in quartz, but the nuggets are seldom of\r\nany considerable size. The inhabitants of Caraga cut in the top of a\r\nmountain a basin of considerable size, and conduct water to it through\r\ncanals made of the wild palm; they dig up the soil while the basin\r\nis filling, which is opened suddenly, and exhibits for working any\r\nexisting stratification of gold; these operations are continued till\r\nthe pits get filled with inroads of earth, when they are abandoned;\r\ngenerally, when a depth has been reached which produces the most\r\nadvantageous returns, the rush of waters conveys away much of the metal\r\nwhich would otherwise be deposited and collected. Gold is also found\r\nin the alluvial deposits which are ground between stones, thrown into\r\nwater, and the metal sinks to the bottom. The rivers of Caraballo,\r\nCamarines, and Misamis, and the mountains of Caraga and Zebu, are the\r\nmost productive. Many Indian families support themselves by washing\r\nthe river sands, and in the times of heavy rains gold is found in the\r\nstreets of some of the pueblos when the floods have passed. There\r\ncan be no doubt of the existence of much gold in the islands, but\r\nprincipally in the parts inhabited by the independent tribes.\r\n\r\nThe Sociedad Exploradora is engaged in working gold-mines and washing\r\nauriferous sands in the province of New Ecija.\r\n\r\nGold dust is the instrument of exchange in the interior of Mindanao,\r\nand is carried about in bags for the ordinary purposes of life. The\r\npossession of California by the Spaniards for so many generations\r\nwithout the development of its riches may explain their inertness\r\nand indifference in the Philippines, notwithstanding the repeated\r\naverments of Spanish writers that the archipelago abounds in gold.\r\n\r\nIron also abounds, especially in the province of Bulacan; but it may be\r\ndoubted whether it can be produced as cheaply as it may be imported,\r\nespecially while roads are in so backward a state, and carriage\r\ncharges so heavy. Many iron-works have been entered on and abandoned.\r\n\r\nA coal-mine is being explored at Guila Guila, in the island of Zebu,\r\non the river Mananga, at a distance of about six miles from the town\r\nof San Nicolas, which has nearly 20,000 inhabitants and is by far\r\nthe largest town in the island. There are reported to be strata of\r\ncoal from one to four feet in thickness. The proprietor informs me\r\nthat he expects in the course of another year to be able to deliver\r\ncoals on the coast at a moderate rate in Tangui, which is close to\r\nthe town of Falisay.\r\n\r\nOf the various objects of speculation, mining is probably the\r\nmost attractive to the adventurer, from the high premiums which it\r\nsometimes brings to the successful. When the risk is divided among\r\nmany shareholders, it partakes of the character of a lottery, in\r\nwhich the chances are proportioned to the stakes; but where, as in\r\nmost of the mining speculations of the Philippines, the enterprises\r\nare conducted by individuals, without adequate means to overcome\r\nthe preliminary difficulties and to support the needful outlay,\r\ndisappointment, loss, ruin and the abandonment of probably valuable\r\nand promising undertakings are but of too frequent occurrence. I\r\nhave before me some details of the attempts made to work the copper\r\nores of Mancayan, in the district of Cagan (now called Lepanto), in\r\nSouth Ilocos (Luzon). They have been worked in the rudest way by the\r\nIgorrote Indians from time immemorial, and the favourable report of\r\nthe richness of the ores which were sent to Europe led to renewed but\r\ninadequate attempts for their exploitation. A good deal of money has,\r\nI understand, been lost, without providing the necessary machinery\r\nfor extracting the metal, or roads for its conveyance. A sample taken\r\nfrom a stratum ten feet in height and seven in breadth, on the side\r\nof a pit four yards deep, gave, as the results of an analysis, 44 per\r\ncent. of copper, 29 of sulphur, 18 of arsenic, and 9 of iron. The\r\nruggedness of the rocks, the thickness of the forest jungle, the\r\nindolence of the natives, and, probably more than these, the absence\r\nof an intelligent direction and sufficient pecuniary resources, have\r\nproduced much discouragement. Don Antonio Hernandez says there are 280\r\nIndian (Igorrote) families occupied in Mancayan in copper digging and\r\nmelting; that they only produce annually about 200 picos (of 137 1/2\r\nlbs. each), which they sell at from eight to nine dollars per pico\r\non the spot; to the neighbouring Christian Indians at ten to twelve,\r\nwho resell them on the coast at from thirteen to sixteen dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Ilocos and Pangasinan manufacture their own domestic\r\nutensils from the copper extracted by themselves.\r\n\r\nFinely variegated marbles exist in the province of Bataan, and some\r\nhave been used for ornamenting the churches; but their existence has\r\nexcited little attention, and no sale was found for some large blocks\r\nquarried by a patriotic adventurer.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned that there are many mineral waters in the\r\nisland--sulphurous and ferruginous--at Antipolo. In the Laguna\r\nthere is a virgin patroness, whose festival lasts eighteen days,\r\nand immense crowds of all races come to drink the waters, and join\r\nthe processions in her honour. The inhabitants of Manila attribute\r\ngreat virtues to the waters of Pagsanghan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of weaving, or that of crossing threads so as to produce\r\na wearable tissue, is one of the evidences of a transition from\r\nsavage towards civilized life. In cold countries the painting the\r\nbody, or covering it with furs and skins, or bark of trees, is the\r\nresource of a wild people; but the necessity for dress of any sort\r\nis so little felt in tropical regions that the missionaries claim the\r\ncredit of introducing the loom, and of instructing the natives in all\r\nthe matters most conducive to their comforts. For their houses they\r\ntaught them to make lime and brick and tiles--staircases, windows and\r\nchimneys--and better to protect themselves against rain and storms;\r\nchairs, tables and domestic utensils followed; carriages for conveyance\r\nof commodities; but, above all, the friars boast of the application,\r\nand devotion, and success of the Indians in decorating the Christian\r\nchurches, building and ornamenting altars, sculpturing virgins and\r\nsaints, and generally contributing to the splendours of ecclesiastical\r\nceremonials.\r\n\r\nThe science of ship-building made great advances. To the canoes\r\n(barotos is the Indian name) scooped out of a single trunk, and used\r\nonly for river navigation, succeeded well-built vessels of several\r\nhundred tons, by which a commerce along the coast and among the\r\nislands was established. At first the planks were the whole length of\r\nthe vessel, but European improvements have gradually been adopted,\r\nand the ships now built in the Philippines are not distinguishable\r\nfrom those of the mother country. We found many on the stocks on the\r\nbanks of the river Agno, and the Indian constructors were desirous of\r\nlooking into all the details of H. M.'s ship Magicienne, in which the\r\ncaptain and officers most courteously aided them, in order to avail\r\nthemselves of any improvements which our vessel exhibited. The cost\r\nof construction was reported to be about 15l. sterling per ton. The\r\nBella Bascongada, a vessel of 760 tons, built in Pangasinan, cost\r\n54,000 dollars, or about 11,000l. sterling.\r\n\r\nLittle has been done for the introduction of improved machinery for\r\nthe manufacture of tissues, which are made of silk, cotton, abacá,\r\nand, above all, the exquisitely fine fabrics produced from the fibre\r\nof the pine-apple leaf, called piñas. These are worked on the simplest\r\nlooms, made of bamboos, and of a thread so fine that it is necessary\r\nto protect it, by the use of a fine gauze, from even the agitation of\r\nthe wind. The Bisayan provinces, and especially the neighbourhood of\r\nIloilo, are most distinguished for the manufacture of this beautiful\r\ntissue, which is sent to the capital for embroidery, and prices which\r\nseem fabulous are paid for the more elaborate specimens--one or two\r\nounces of gold being frequently given for a small handkerchief. In\r\nZebu handsome cotton rugs are made, and in Panay a variety of stuffs\r\nof sundry materials.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have the art of softening and manufacturing horn. In\r\nmetals they make chains of silver and gold of great fineness, for\r\nwhich formerly there was a great demand in Mexico, but I believe\r\nEuropean jewellery has supplanted the Indian craftsman.\r\n\r\nMats are a remarkable production of the islands. Many of them are\r\nvery beautiful, of various colours, and are ornamented with gold and\r\nsilver patterns. As mattresses are never used for beds, everybody\r\nsleeps on a mat, which in some cases, but not generally, is provided\r\nwith a sheet and a long soft pillow, which is placed between the legs\r\nand deemed a needful appliance for comfortable repose.\r\n\r\nFibre-wrought hats and cigar-cases of various colours, the white,\r\nhowever, being the most costly and beautiful, compete with similar\r\nproductions of the natives of Panama.\r\n\r\nThe tools and instruments employed by the Indians in manufacture are\r\nall of the simplest and rudest character.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic beverage called vino de nipa is largely produced in the\r\nPhilippines. It was made a monopoly as early as 1712 in the provinces\r\nnear the capital, and then produced 10,000 dollars of annual revenue;\r\nthe farm was abolished in 1780, and in 1814 the collection was\r\ntransferred to the general administration. The juice is obtained by\r\ncutting a hole in a pulpy part of the palm, introducing a bamboo cane,\r\nand binding the tree over the receiving vessel. The sale of the nipa\r\nwine is a monopoly in the hands of the Government. The monopoly is much\r\nand reasonably complained of by the Indians. Excise duties leading to\r\ndomiciliary visits, and interfering with the daily concerns of life,\r\nhave been always and in all countries deemed one of the most vexatious\r\nand disagreeable forms of taxation. Man, whatever be his colour, is\r\neverywhere man, and everywhere exhibits, though in different forms,\r\nthe same general dislikes and sympathies. The heavy hand of extortion\r\nand oppression does not crush the Filipinos, but a redistribution of\r\nthe forms of taxation would be beneficial to the fiscal interest and\r\nsatisfactory to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR PROVERBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following collection of proverbs will be found curious and\r\ncharacteristic. They will serve to throw light upon the genius of\r\nthe people, and are appropriate specimens of the Tagal idiom:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAng mañga casalanan ang nacasisira sa calolova.--Sins are the diseases\r\nof the soul.\r\n\r\nValan di dungmating na dalita t' saguit cay Job ay dili y saman\r\nnagogolorhianan ang coniyang loob.--Job had many troubles, but they\r\ndid not affect the inner man.\r\n\r\nCatotohin mo ang catatoro co.--Make thyself a friend of my friend.\r\n\r\nAvatin mo angcoob mo sa quinauiuilihan niyang masama.--Separate thy\r\nwill (purpose) from him whose love has a bad object.\r\n\r\nHouag mong pitahin ang vala.--Desire not what is not (not attainable).\r\n\r\nAt cun ano caya ang pinagpipilitanan.--They dispute about what their\r\ndispute shall be (are determined to quarrel).\r\n\r\nMasamang cahuy ang dinamomoñga.--Bad tree produces no fruit.\r\n\r\nMaminsanminsan ay susulat ca at maminsanminsa y babata ca nang\r\nsulat.--Write now and then, read now and then.\r\n\r\nNang anoman at maca tomama sa olo ninyo.--Don't fling up a stone,\r\nit may fall on your own head.\r\n\r\nPaombaychan ca at napapagal ca.--Sing a lullaby at your wedding.\r\n\r\nHouag mo acong pangalatacan at dili aco hayop.--Don't drive me,\r\nfor I am not a beast.\r\n\r\nAy at linologmocan mo iyang duma?--Why seat yourself in that dirty\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nHouag mo acong galavirin niyan osap na iyan.--Don't involve me in\r\nthat quarrel.\r\n\r\nHindi matimoan, ang balat nang Buaya, nang anomang tilos.--A knife\r\nwill not enter a crocodile's back.\r\n\r\nTiguis cang nag papacalouay.--What thou doest do quietly.\r\n\r\nTiñgalen mo ang balatic.--Lift up your eyes, and you will see the\r\nstars.

Fué por lana y\r\nbolvió trasquilado.--He went for wool, and returned shorn.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have selected most of these proverbs, aphorisms and moral and\r\nreligious maxims from Fr. de los Santos' folio volume, and they would\r\nhave some interest if they represented the thoughts and feelings of a\r\ncivilized nation. That interest will hardly be less when the social\r\ncode of semi-barbarians is studied in these short sentences. The\r\ninfluence and teachings of the priests will be found in many; others\r\nwill be deemed characteristic of local usages, and some will find\r\na recommendation in their grotesqueness and originality. I have\r\nthought these examples of the language might not be without their\r\nvalue to philologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo foreign nations--to our own especially--the particular interest\r\nfelt in the state of the Philippines is naturally more of a commercial\r\nthan of a political character. They must grow in trading importance;\r\nalready enough has been done to make a retrograde or even a stationary\r\npolicy untenable. Every step taken towards emancipation from the\r\nancient fetters which ignorance and monopoly laid upon their progress\r\nhas been so successful and so productive as to promise and almost to\r\nensure continuance in a course now proved to be alike beneficial to\r\nthe public treasury and to the common weal. The statistics which I\r\nhave been able to collect are often unsatisfactory and inaccurate,\r\nbut, upon the whole, may be deemed approximative to the truth,\r\nand certainly not without value as means of comparison between the\r\nresults of that narrow-minded exclusive system which so long directed\r\nthe councils of Spain and the administration of las Indias, and the\r\nwiser and more liberal views which make their way through the dense\r\ndarkness of the past.\r\n\r\nThe caprices and mischiefs of a privileged and protected trade and\r\nthe curses which monopolies bring with them to the general interests,\r\nmay, indeed, be well studied in the ancient legislation of Spain\r\nas regards her colonies. One vessel only was formerly allowed to\r\nproceed from the Philippines to Mexico; she was to be commanded\r\nby officers of the royal navy, equipped as a ship of war, and was\r\nsubject to a variety of absurd restrictions and regulations: the\r\nadventurers were to pay 20,000 dollars for their privilege; and no\r\none was allowed to adventure unless he were a vocal de consulado,\r\nwhich required a residence of several years in the islands, and the\r\npossession of property to the extent of 8,000 dollars. The privilege\r\noften passed clandestinely, by purchase, into the hands of friars,\r\nofficials, women and other speculators--and it may well be supposed\r\nat what prices the goods had to be invoiced. Such being the licensed\r\npillage in Asia, on arriving at Acapulco, in America, to which place\r\nthe cargo was necessarily consigned, 33 1/3 per cent. was imposed upon\r\nthe valuation of the Manila invoices. And on the return of the ship\r\nsimilar or even more absurd conditions were exacted: she was only\r\nallowed to bring back double the value of the cargo she conveyed;\r\nbut, as the profits were often enormous, every species of fraud was\r\npractised to give fictitious values to the articles imported--in fact,\r\nfrom the beginning to the end of the undertaking there seems to have\r\nbeen a rivalry in roguery among all parties concerned.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Company of the Philippines, in 1785, gave\r\nto monopoly another shape, but led to some development of colonial\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely needful to follow the history of the commerce of the\r\nPhilippines through the many changes which have produced its present\r\ncomparative prosperity--a prosperity to be measured by the amount of\r\nemancipation which has been introduced. Had the Spanish authorities the\r\ncourage to utter the magic words \"Laissez faire, laissez passer!\" what\r\na cornucopia of blessings would be poured upon the archipelago!\r\n\r\nBut it could hardly be expected from a government constituted like the\r\ngovernment of Spain, that, either of its own spontaneous movement, or\r\nby licence delegated to the Captain-General, so grand a work would be\r\naccomplished as the establishment of free production, free commerce,\r\nfree settlement, and free education in the Philippines; and yet a step\r\nso bold and noble would, as I fully believe, in a few years be followed\r\nby progress and prosperity far beyond any calculations that have\r\nbeen ventured on. The little that has been hazarded for the liberty\r\nof trade, though hurriedly and imperfectly done, cannot but encourage\r\nfuture efforts; and in the meantime many beneficial reforms have been\r\npressed upon the attention of the government with such conclusive\r\nstatistics and irresistible logic, that, if it depended on these alone,\r\nthe Philippines might hope to enter upon the early enjoyment of their\r\nheritage of future advancement. The reform of the tariffs--the removal\r\nof petty vexatious fiscal interferences--improvements in the navigation\r\nof the rivers--the cleansing the harbours--lighthouse, buoys and other\r\nappliances for the security of shipping--are among the more obvious\r\nand immediate claims of commerce. In Manila the absence of docks for\r\nrepairing and harbouring vessels is much felt; the custom-house is on\r\nthe wrong side of the river--though it were better it should exist\r\non neither side; there are no means of regular postal communication\r\nwith the islands from the Peninsula; tug-steamers, life-boats, quays\r\nand piers, seamen's houses, marine hospitals, are wanting, but their\r\nintroduction has been so strongly advocated that its advent may be\r\nhoped for. In truth, it is pleasant to find in a country so remote and\r\nso long under the most discouraging and retarding influences, that\r\ninquiry, which is the pioneer and the handmaid of all improvement,\r\nis already busily at work and will not be at work in vain.\r\n\r\nA communication was made to the Chamber of Commerce by the\r\nGovernor-General in 1858, requesting that the merchants would point\r\nout to him the best possible means for developing the riches of the\r\nPhilippine Islands by extending their foreign trade. The British\r\nmerchants, after expressing a general wish that the islands should\r\nenjoy the benefits of that system of free trade and liberal commercial\r\npolicy whose \"great results\" are manifest to all, point out the\r\nspecial grievances which demand immediate reform.\r\n\r\n1. The present system of requiring permits for every cargo boat\r\nemployed, leads to many needless charges, vexations and delays.\r\n\r\n2. Reform of the tariffs which press very heavily on certain articles,\r\nfor the protection of some small manufacturing interest in the\r\nisland. This is specially the case with cotton goods intended for\r\ncommon use; those of the colours given by dyes produced in the island\r\nare selected for the heaviest impost, to give encouragement to native\r\ndyers. Many articles are estimated much beyond their real value, so\r\nthat the percentage duty becomes excessive. Lawns, for instance, are\r\ntariffed at double their market price. Iron chains worth five dollars\r\nper cwt. are tariffed at twelve dollars. A small quantity of white,\r\nblack, blue, purple and rose-coloured cotton twist being produced,\r\nthere is a duty of from 40 to 50 per cent., while red, yellow, green,\r\n&c., which the natives cannot dye, are admitted duty free. These are\r\nstriking exemplifications of the workings of a protective system.\r\n\r\nOther blue goods are prohibited because the islands produce indigo;\r\nand for the protection of the native shoemakers (who, by the way,\r\nare almost invariably Chinese and mere birds of passage in the\r\ncountry), foreign boots and shoes pay from 40 to 50 per cent., to\r\nthe great detriment of the public health, for the country-tanned\r\nleather will not keep out the rain and the mud, while the protective\r\nduty encourages the Chinese settler to become a manufacturer, who\r\nis less wanted than the agricultural labourer. In the same spirit\r\nthe tailors are protected, i.e. allowed to overcharge the consumer\r\nto the extent of 40 to 50 per cent., the duty on imported clothes,\r\nwhich goes principally to the Chinese. Foreign fruits, preserves and\r\nliquors have to bear similar burdens, for cannot the Philippines give\r\nconfectionary and sweets enough of their own? So runs the round of\r\nfolly and miscalculation. One hundred dozen of Spanish beer entered\r\nthe Philippines in 1857, and to protect and encourage so important\r\nan interest an excessive impost was levied on 350 pipes and nearly\r\n100,000 bottles of beer not Spanish.\r\n\r\n3. Then, again, the heavy differential duties in favour of Spanish\r\nships are a well-grounded subject of discontent and highly prejudicial\r\nto the general interest. The levying tonnage duties upon ships entering\r\nand departing without cargoes is a grievance of which there are just\r\ncomplaints. The adjacency of so many free ports--Hong Kong, Macao\r\nand Singapore--and the more liberal system of the Australian and\r\nPolynesian regions, place the Philippine trade in a disadvantageous\r\nposition. Among the documents which I collected is one from a native\r\nmerchant, in which he says:--\"The demonstrations of political\r\neconomists, and the practical results of free-trade legislation,\r\nestablish the fact that public credit and public prosperity are alike\r\nbenefited by the emancipation of commerce, and narrow is the view\r\nwhich, looking only to the temporary defalcation of revenue from\r\nthe diminution of imports, forgets the enormous increase of all the\r\nsources of revenue from lowering prices and extending demand.\" In\r\nthis way the great truths which have been silently and successfully\r\nrevolutionizing our commercial legislation are spread on all the\r\nwings of all the winds, and will finally encircle the world in the\r\ngreat bonds of brotherhood, with peace and prosperity for attendants.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of the 18th June, 1857, the restrictions on the trade in\r\nrice and paddy were removed, and foreign grain was allowed to enter\r\nduty free, not, only into the ports opened to foreign trade, but into\r\ndivers subordinate ports. Though the permission was then temporary,\r\nit has now become permanent, and I found that the emancipation of these\r\nimportant articles from all custom-house interference had been attended\r\nwith the best results, by regulating and assimilating prices, without\r\nany detriment to native production. The more general the principles of\r\nfree trade the more security will there be against dearth and famine\r\non the one side, and superfluity and glut on the other.\r\n\r\nRice is sold by the cavan. Its price is ordinarily double that of\r\npaddy. The average fluctuations are from one to two dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the import trade of the Philippines amounted to only 5,329,000\r\ndollars, of which more than half consisted of precious metals, sent\r\nfrom the Spanish colonies of America. From Europe and the United States\r\nthe trade was only 175,000 dollars. The exports were 4,795,000 dollars,\r\nof which one-and-a-half million consisted of silver to China, and the\r\nwhole amount of exports to Europe and the United States was 250,000\r\ndollars. The great start took place in 1834, when the monopoly of\r\nthe Philippine Company terminated, and commerce may be regarded as\r\nprogressive from that time. Of the trade with the surrounding islands,\r\nthat with Jolo, conducted principally by Chinese, is important. One of\r\nthe leading articles of export is the edible bird's-nests, of whose\r\ncollection a Spanish writer gives the following account:--\"The nests\r\nare collected twice a year; those most valued from deep and humid\r\ncaverns. Early training is needful to scale the localities where\r\nthe nests are found, and the task is always dangerous. To reach\r\nthe caves it is necessary to descend perpendicularly many hundred\r\nfeet, supported by a rope made of bamboo or junk, suspended over the\r\nsea waves as they dash against the rocks.\" There is also from Jolo\r\na considerable exportation of tortoise-shell. Trepang (sea-slug,\r\nHolothuria) and shark-fins are sent to the Chinese markets; also\r\nmother-of-pearl, wax and gold dust. The voyage from Manila to Jolo\r\nand return generally occupies seven to eight months. A trade in most\r\nrespects resembling that of Jolo is carried on between Manila and\r\nthe Moluccas. Spices are, however, added to the imports. There is a\r\nlarge trade between Singapore and Manila, and with Amoy, in China,\r\nthe transactions are very important. Vessels are generally loading\r\nfrom and to that port. Rice, paddy, cocoa-nut oil, sugar, fine woods,\r\ntable delicacies and a variety of minor articles, are exported; silks,\r\nnankins, tea, vermilion, umbrellas, earthenware and a thousand smaller\r\nmatters, make up the returns.\r\n\r\nInternal trade suffers much from the many impediments to communication\r\nand the various shiftings to which merchandise is exposed. It is\r\nsaid that in the transit from the north of Luzon to the capital there\r\nare as many as a hundred floating rafts upon which the goods must be\r\ncarried across the different streams; at each considerable delay is\r\nexperienced, as the raft (balsa) is seldom found when and where it is\r\nwanted. And during half the year inland conveyance is the only means\r\nof transport, as the monsoons make the sea voyage impossible for\r\ncoasting vessels. Indeed, in the remoter islands months frequently\r\npass without arrivals from the capital. Some of the fairs in the\r\ninterior are largely attended by the Mahomedan and heathen natives,\r\nwho will not visit the ports or larger towns. That of Yligan (Misamis,\r\nin Mindanao) is much visited by Moros, who bring thither for sale\r\npaddy, cocoa, coffee, gold dust, cotton fabrics, krises and weapons\r\nof war, with many other native articles, which they exchange mostly\r\nfor European and Chinese wares. Panaguis, in Luzon, is another market\r\nmuch frequented by the Igorrote Indians. Many of the ancient river\r\ncommunications have been stopped by inundations, which have given\r\na new direction to the stream, and by the invasion of snags, trees\r\nand rocks from the upper regions. There is a great deal of ambulatory\r\npetty trade in the interior; the Chinese especially are active pedlars\r\nand factors, and make their way to buy and to sell wherever there is\r\na profit to be gained. They are to a great extent the pioneers of\r\ncommerce, and in this way valuable auxiliaries and co-operators by\r\nopening new fields to be hereafter more extensively explored.\r\n\r\nThere are in Manila seven English, three American, two French, two\r\nSwiss and one German, commercial establishments. In the new ports\r\nthere is no European house of business except at Iloilo, where there\r\nis an English firm, of which the British vice-consul is the directing\r\npartner.\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of commercial legislation is a decree of the\r\ngovernor of the Philippines, dated only a few years ago, by which\r\nit was ordered that no vessel should be allowed to introduce a cargo\r\nfrom China or the East Indies unless an engagement was entered into by\r\nthe captain to bring to Manila five hundred living shrikes (mimas?),\r\nas the bird was reported to be most useful in destroying the insects\r\nwhich were at that time seriously damaging the harvests. I believe\r\nnot a single bird was ever brought. It would have been about as easy\r\nand as reasonable to require them to import some slices of the moon,\r\nfor the catching, and the caging, and the keeping, are scarcely\r\nwithin mortal capabilities, and 500 birds were the required minimum\r\nby every ship; nor was it the least remarkable part of the decree or\r\nrequirement that they were all to be delivered gratis.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of the revenue there is an armed body called the\r\nCarabineros de Real Hacienda. It is composed of natives under European\r\nofficers, and is charged with both land and sea service. They wear\r\na military uniform and a broad hat resembling a large punch-bowl,\r\nwhich is, however, an admirable protection from the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has a salaried consul and vice-consul in Manila and\r\nvice-consuls in Iloilo and Sual. France has also a salaried consul\r\nin the capital. The United States, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden and\r\nChili, are represented by members of commercial establishments,\r\nwho exercise consular authority in Manila. The American consul is\r\nMr. Charles Griswold, and few are the visitors to these islands who\r\nhave not enjoyed his hospitality and benefited by his experience.\r\n\r\nThe post-office establishments are imperfect and unsatisfactory and\r\nthe charges for the conveyance of letters heavy. There is a weekly\r\npostal communication from the capital with the provinces in the\r\nisland of Luzon, and southwards as far as Samar and Leyte, but all the\r\nother eastern and southern islands are left to the chances which the\r\ncoasting trade offers and are frequently many months without receiving\r\nany news from the capital or the mother country. A regular service,\r\nproviding for the wants of these important districts, Panay especially,\r\nwith its population exceeding half a million, is greatly to be desired.\r\n\r\nThere is now a fortnightly service carried on by the steamers of\r\nthe Peninsular and Oriental Company between Manila and Hong Kong,\r\ngenerally reaching forty-eight hours before the departure, and\r\nquitting forty-eight hours after the arrival, of the steamers from\r\nEurope. It is conducted with great regularity and the letters from\r\nSpain arrive in about fifty days; but many days would be saved were\r\nthere a branch steamer from Malta to Alicant. For this service an\r\nannual sum (recoverable monthly) of 120,000 dollars is paid by the\r\nManila government to the company. The steamers are freed from all\r\nport charges except pilotage.\r\n\r\nThe government has published proposals for the establishment of a\r\nsteam-packet company for the service of the islands, offering 45,000\r\ndollars annually as a State contribution, but I believe there is no\r\nimmediate prospect of the adoption of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Banco Español de Isabel II. is a joint-stock company, whose\r\ncapital is 400,000 dollars, in 1,000 shares of 400 dollars each. It\r\nwas established in the year 1855, and has generally paid to the\r\nshareholders dividends at the rate of six to eight per cent. per\r\nannum. It issues promissory notes, discounts local bills of\r\nexchange and lends money on mortgage. The general rate of interest\r\nin the Philippines fluctuates from six to nine per cent. The yearly\r\noperations of the bank exceed 2,000,000 of dollars. The value of about\r\nhalf-a-million of bills of exchange is usually under discount. Its\r\nordinary circulation does not exceed 200,000 dollars in promissory\r\nnotes and it has deposits and balances to the value of about 1,750,000\r\ndollars. The bank has afforded considerable facilities to commerce,\r\nand has answered one of its principal objects, that of bringing into\r\ncirculation some of the hoarded money of the natives. Most of the\r\nforeign houses are shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe decimal system of accounts and currency was introduced into the\r\nPhilippines by a royal decree, and an end put to all the complications\r\nof maravedis, quartos, and reales de ocho, by the simple adoption\r\nof the dollar, divided into one hundred cents. It would be, indeed,\r\na wretched compliment to the population of England (let me say it\r\nin passing) if, as certain opponents of improvement have averred,\r\nthey would never be brought to appreciate or comprehend a change to\r\ndecimal denominations which the \"untutored mind\" of the \"wild Indian\"\r\nhas already begun to adopt, using his digits as the instruments of\r\nthe new philosophy, and aided now and then probably by the simple\r\nabacus of the Chinese shopkeeper, with whom he has much to do.\r\n\r\nThe weights and measures used in the Philippines are--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arroba  (25  lbs.

[30]\r\n\r\nHe begins his report by contrasting the population and commerce\r\nof Cuba with that of the Philippines; stating that Cuba, with less\r\nthan a million of inhabitants, has a trade of 27,500,000 dollars,\r\nwhile the Philippines, which he says contained, in 1850, 4,000,000\r\nof people in a state of subjection and 1,000,000 unsubdued, had a\r\ntrade of less than 5,000,000 of dollars. He calculates the coloured\r\npopulation of Cuba at 500,000; the white population of the Philippines\r\nat from 7,000 to 8,000 persons. He deduces that, if the produce of\r\nthe Philippines were proportioned to that of Cuba, it would be of\r\nthe value of 250,000,000 dollars, and that the revenue should be\r\n48,000,000 dollars, instead of about 9,500,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nHe avers that the soil is equal in its productive powers to any in\r\nthe world; that the quality of the produce--sugar, coffee, tobacco,\r\nindigo, cocoa and cotton--is most excellent; that it possesses almost\r\na monopoly of abacá (Manila hemp); and he goes on to consider the\r\nmeans of turning these natural advantages to the best account.\r\n\r\nHe altogether repudiates any extension of the existing system,\r\nor augmentation of taxation in its present forms; and states, what\r\nis most true, that to the development of agriculture, industry and\r\ncommerce the Philippines must look for increased prosperity.\r\n\r\nHis three proposals are:--\r\n\r\n    1. Opening new ports to foreign trade.\r\n    2. Emancipating the production, manufacture and sale of tobacco.\r\n    3. Increasing the population of the islands.\r\n\r\nBy a royal decree, dated 31st March, 1855, three additional ports were\r\nopened to foreign trade--Zamboanga (Mindanao), Iloilo (Panay), and Sual\r\n(Luzon). The results have not responded to anticipations. One reason is\r\nobvious--custom-house officers, custom-house restrictions, custom-house\r\nvexations accompanied the seemingly liberal legislation. These are\r\nsufficient to check, if not to crush, the growth of intercourse. I\r\ndoubt if in either of the new ports the custom-house receipts cover\r\nthe costs of collection. The experiment should have been a free-trade\r\nexperiment, but the jealousies and fears of the capital were probably\r\ninfluential. It ought not to have been forgotten that the new ports,\r\ncharged with all the burdens which pressed upon Manila, offered none\r\nof its facilities, the creation of many generations--wharves and\r\nwarehouses, accomplished merchants, capital, foreign settlers, assured\r\nconsumption of imports and supply of exports; these counterbalanced\r\nthe cost of conveyance of goods to or from the capital, while, on\r\nthe other hand, the introduction of a custom-house has prejudiced\r\nthe trade which previously existed--as, for example, the call of\r\nwhalers at Zamboanga, unwilling to submit to the fiscal exactions now\r\nintroduced. But if every port in the Philippines were made free from\r\ncustom-houses a great impulse would be given to industry, commerce\r\nand shipping; the loss to the treasury would be inconsiderable,\r\nfor the net proceeds of the customs duties is very insignificant,\r\nwhile other sources of revenue would be undoubtedly increased by\r\nthe impulse given to the general prosperity. De Mas states that the\r\nextension of the trade of Cuba from the Havana to other ports led to\r\nan augmentation in its value from 2,000,000 to 30,000,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nTwo plans are suggested by Señor De Mas for the emancipation of\r\nthe tobacco cultivation and manufacture from the existing State\r\nmonopoly. One, the levying a heavy land tax on all lands devoted to\r\nthe produce; the other, the imposition of a duty on exportation. He\r\nestimates that a baleta of land (1,000 brazas square) gives 1,500\r\nplants, and 4 to 5 cwt. of tobacco, saleable at 4 to 5 dollars per\r\nquintal. The cost of manufacturing 14,000 cigars, which represent 1\r\ncwt., 5 1/4 dollars, and boxes for packing, 3 1/2 dollars. He says the\r\nvalue of the cigars is 6 1/2 dollars per box (it is now considerably\r\nmore), in which case the profit would be 77 1/4 dollars, and proposes\r\na duty of 70 dollars per cwt., which is more than five times the cost\r\nof the article. He gives satisfactory reasons for the conclusion that\r\ncigars would be made much more economically by the peasantry than by\r\nthe government, shows that the cost of the machinery of administration\r\nmight be greatly diminished, asserts that the Indians employed at\r\nhome would be satisfied with lower gains than the wages paid by the\r\ngovernment, and supposes that the unoccupied houses of the natives\r\nwould be dedicated to the making of cigars as a pleasant and profitable\r\ndomestic employment. It may be doubted whether he estimates at its\r\nfull value the resistance which the indolent habits of the Indian\r\noppose to voluntary or spontaneous labour; but the conclusion I have\r\nreached by not exactly the same train of reasoning is the same as\r\nthat arrived at by my friend whom I have been quoting, namely, that\r\nthe government monopoly is less productive than free cultivation,\r\nmanufacture and sale might become; that a reduction of prices would\r\nextend demand, leave larger benefits to the treasury and confer many\r\nadvantages upon the people; and that the arguments (mostly of those\r\ninterested in the monopoly) in favour of the existing system are not\r\ngrounded on sound reasoning, nor supported by statistical facts.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco monopoly (estanco) was established in 1780 by\r\nGovernor-General Basco; it was strongly opposed by the friars, and\r\nmenaces of severe punishments were held over those who sought to\r\nescape the obligations imposed. But to the present hour there are\r\nsaid to be large plantations of tobacco which escape the vigilance\r\nof government, and cigars are purchaseable in many of the islands at\r\none-fourth of the government price. The personal establishment for\r\nthe protection of the tobacco monopoly consists of nearly a thousand\r\nofficials and more than thirty revenue boats. It is, notwithstanding,\r\ncultivated largely in provinces where the cultivation is prohibited\r\nby law; and I find in a report from the Alcalde of Misamis (Mindanao)\r\nthe following phrase: \"The idea of interfering with the growth of\r\ntobacco for the benefit of the treasury must be abandoned, as the\r\nterritory where it is produced is not subject to Spanish authority.\"\r\n\r\nAttempts were made a few years ago to encourage the planting of tobacco\r\nin the province of Iloilo, by a company which made advances to the\r\nIndians; but the enterprise, discouraged by the government, failed,\r\nand I found, when I visited the locality, the warehouses abandoned\r\nand the company dissolved. There have been many expeditions for the\r\ndestruction and confiscation of illicit tobacco; and on more than one\r\noccasion insurrections, tumults, serious loss of life and very doubtful\r\nresults have followed these interferences. The statistical returns\r\nshow that the consumption of the State tobacco varies considerably\r\nin the different provinces, being influenced by the greater or less\r\ndifficulty of obtaining the contraband article.\r\n\r\nThere have been divers projects for augmenting the population of the\r\nPhilippines--from China, from Switzerland, from Borneo and even from\r\nBritish India. The friars have never looked with complacency on any\r\nof these schemes. They all present elements which would not easily he\r\nsubjected to ecclesiastical influence. The Chinese would not be willing\r\ncultivators of the soil if any other pursuit should promise greater\r\nprofits, and it is quite certain that the indolent Indian will nowhere\r\nbe able to compete with the industrious, persevering and economical\r\nChinese. Many suggestions have been made for the introduction of\r\nChinese women, with a view of attaching Chinese families to the soil;\r\nbut hitherto nothing has sufficed to conquer the abhorrence with\r\nwhich a Chinese female contemplates the abandonment of her country,\r\nnor the general resistance to such abandonment on the part of the\r\nChinese clans. Chinese female children have been frequently kidnapped\r\nfor conveyance to the Philippines, and some horrible circumstances\r\nhave come to the knowledge of British authorities in China, followed\r\nby the exposure and punishment of British subjects concerned in these\r\ncruel and barbarous deeds. An establishment of a sisterhood in China,\r\ncalled that of the Sainte Enfance, has been looked to as a means of\r\nchristianizing female children, and conveying them to the Philippines;\r\nthey have collected or purchased many orphans, but small success has\r\nattended these well-meant, but not well-directed labours. In 1855,\r\nit was stated in an official document (De Mas, p. 26) that in 1858,\r\nan annual entry of 2,500 children might be expected. The calculation\r\nhas been a total mistake; the establishments in China are in a state\r\nof embarrassment and difficulty, and I am not aware that a single\r\nChinese female has been supplied for the suggested purpose. Any\r\nnumber of orphans or abandoned children might be bought in the\r\ngreat cities of China, especially from the orphan asylums; but an\r\nincreased demand would only encourage their abandonment by their\r\nmothers. These foundling hospitals are of very doubtful utility,\r\nand produce, probably, more misery than they cure.\r\n\r\nThe greatest impediment to the progress of the Philippines, and\r\nthe development of their immense resources, is attributable to the\r\nmiserable traditional policy of the mother country, whose jealousies\r\ntie the hands of the governors they appoint to rule; so that the\r\nknowledge and experience which are acquired in the locality are wholly\r\nsubjected to the ignorance and shortsightedness of the distant, but\r\nsupreme authority. Would the Spaniard but recognize the wisdom of one\r\nof their many instructive proverbs--Mas sabe el loco en su casa que\r\ncuerdo en la agena (the fool knows more about his own home than the\r\nwise man of the home of another)--more confidence might be reposed in\r\nthose who are thoroughly cognizant of local circumstances and local\r\nwants. As it is, everything has to be referred to Madrid. A long\r\ndelay is inevitable--an erroneous decision probable; circumstances are\r\nconstantly changing, and what would have been judicious to-day may be\r\nwholly unadvisable to-morrow. Then there is the greatest unwillingness\r\nto surrender even the shadow of authority, or any of those sources\r\nof patronage which a government so enervate and corrupt as that of\r\nSpain clings to as its props and protection. Again, the uncertainty\r\nof tenure of office, which attaches to all the superior offices held\r\nunder the Spanish Government, is alike calculated to demoralize and\r\ndiscourage. Before a governor has surveyed his territory and marked\r\nout to himself a course of action, he may be superseded under one of\r\nthose multitudinous changes which grow out of the caprices of the\r\ncourt or the clamour of the people. It was a melancholy employment\r\nof mine to look round the collection of the various portraits of the\r\ncaptains-general which adorned my apartment, bearing the dates of\r\ntheir appointment and their supersession. Some of them only occupied\r\ntheir office for a few months, and were as carelessly and recklessly\r\ndismissed as a worthless weed is flung away. And there seemed no\r\nexpectation of any change in this respect, for there were many blank\r\nframes made to receive the vera effigies of future excellencies. Our\r\ncolonial system is wiser, as we appoint governors for six years, and,\r\nexcept under special circumstances, they are not dispossessed of their\r\ngovernment. Whether there may be any moral deterioration connected\r\nwith the possession of power, sufficient to counterbalance all the\r\nbenefits which are furnished by long experience and local knowledge,\r\nmay be a question for philosophy and statesmanship.\r\n\r\nBut other causes of backwardness are traceable to those very elements\r\nof wealth and prosperity, to which these islands must look for their\r\nfuture progress. A soil so feracious, a sun so bright, rains so\r\nbountiful, require so little co-operation from the aid of man that he\r\nbecomes careless, indolent, unconcerned for the morrow. He has but to\r\nstretch out his hand, and food drops into it. The fibre of the aloe,\r\nwhich the female weaves with the simplest of looms, gives her garments;\r\nthe uprights and the floors and the substantial parts of his dwelling\r\nare made of the bamboo, which he finds in superfluous abundance;\r\nwhile the nipa palm provides roofs and sides to his hut. Wants he has\r\nfew and he cares little for luxuries. His enjoyments are in religious\r\nprocessions, in music and dancing, in his gallo above all. He may take\r\npossession without rent of any quantity of land which he is willing to\r\ncultivate. There is a tendency, no doubt, to improvement. Cultivation\r\nextends and good examples are not without effect.\r\n\r\nIn times of tranquillity Spain has nothing to fear for her Philippine\r\ncolonies. So long as they are unmolested by foreign invaders and\r\nthe government is carried on with mildness and prudence, there is\r\nlittle to be apprehended from any internal agitation; but I doubt the\r\nefficiency of any means of defence at the disposal of the authorities,\r\nshould a day of trouble come. The Indian regular forces might for\r\nsome time be depended on; but whether this could be anticipated of\r\nthe militia or any of the urban auxiliaries is uncertain. The number\r\nof Spaniards is small--in most of the islands quite insignificant;\r\nindolence and indifference characterize the indigenous races; and if,\r\non the one hand, they took no part in favour of intrusive strangers,\r\non the other, they could not be looked to for any patriotic or\r\nenergetic exertions on behalf of their Spanish rulers. They have,\r\nindeed, no traditions of former independence--no descendants of famous\r\nancient chiefs or princes, to whom they look with affection, hope or\r\nreverence. There are no fragments left of hierarchies overthrown. No\r\nMontezumas, no Colocolos, are named in their songs, or perpetuated\r\nin their memories. There are no ruins of great cities or temples;\r\nin a word, no records of the remote past. There is a certain amount\r\nof dissatisfaction among the Indians, but it is more strongly felt\r\nagainst the native gobernadorcillos--the heads of barangay--the\r\nprivileged members of the local principalia--when exercising their\r\n\"petty tyrannies,\" than against the higher authorities, who are beyond\r\nthe hearing of their complaints. \"The governor-general is in Manila\r\n(far away); the king is in Spain (farther still); and God is in heaven\r\n(farthest of all).\" It is a natural complaint that the tribute or\r\ncapitation tax presses equally on all classes of Indians, rich or\r\npoor. The heads of barangay, who are charged with its collection, not\r\nunfrequently dissipate the money in gambling. One abuse has, however,\r\nbeen reformed--the tribute in many provinces was formerly collected\r\nin produce, and great were the consequent exactions practised upon\r\nthe natives, from which the treasury obtained no profit, but the petty\r\nfunctionaries much. I believe the tax is now almost universally levied\r\nin money. All Spaniards, all foreigners (excepting Chinese), and their\r\ndescendants are exempted from tribute. One of the most intelligent\r\nof the merchants of Manila (Don Juan Bautista Marcaida) has had the\r\nkindness to furnish me with sundry memoranda on the subject of the\r\ncapabilities of the Philippine Islands, and the means of developing\r\nthem. To his observations, the result of careful observation, much\r\nexperience and extensive reading, I attach great value. They are\r\nimbued with some of the national prejudices of a Spanish Catholic,\r\nin whose mind the constitution of the Romish Church is associated\r\nwith every form of authority, and who is unwilling to see in that\r\nvery constitution, and its necessary agencies, invincible impediments\r\nto the fullest progress of intellect--to the widest extension of\r\nagricultural, manufacturing and commercial prosperity--in a word,\r\nto that great agitation of the popular mind, to which Protestant\r\nnations owe their religious reforms, and their undoubted superiority\r\nin the vast field of speculation and adventure.\r\n\r\nHe says:--\"The social organization of the Philippines is the most\r\npaternal and civilizing of any known in the world; having for its\r\nbasis the doctrines of the Gospel, and the kind and fatherly spirit\r\nof the Laws of the Indies.\" It may be admitted, in reference to the\r\nlegislation of the colonies of many nations, that the Spanish code\r\nis comparatively humane and that the influence of the Romish clergy\r\nhas been frequently and successfully excited for the protection and\r\nbenefit of conquered natives, and of imported slaves; but M. Marcaida\r\ngoes on to acknowledge and point out \"the torpid and unimproving\r\ncharacter of the existing system,\" and to demand important changes\r\nfor the advancement of the public weal.\r\n\r\n\"The government moves slowly, from its complicated organization,\r\nand from the want of adequate powers to give effect to those reforms\r\nwhich are suggested by local knowledge, but which are overruled by the\r\nunteachable ignorance, or selfish interests, or political intrigues\r\nof the mother country.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the clergy, he thinks the administration generally good,\r\nbut that the progress of time and altered circumstances necessitate\r\nmany important changes in the distribution of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthority, a new arrangement of the pueblos, a better education of the\r\nchurch functionaries, a great augmentation of the number of parochial\r\npriests (many of whom have now cures varying from 3,000 to 60,000\r\nsouls). He would have the parish clergyman both the religious and\r\nsecular instructor of his community, and for this purpose requires that\r\nhe should be becomingly and highly educated--a consummation for which\r\nthe government would have some difficulty in providing the machinery,\r\nand for which assuredly the Church would not lend its co-operation.\r\n\r\n\"For the administration of justice, the Philippines have one supreme\r\nand forty-two subordinate tribunals. The number is wholly insufficient\r\nfor the necessities of 5,000,000 of inhabitants scattered over 1,200\r\nislands, and occupying so vast a territorial space.\" There can be no\r\ndoubt that justice is often inaccessible, that it is costly, that it\r\nis delayed, defeated, and associated with many vexations. Spain has\r\nnever been celebrated for the integrity of its judges, or the purity\r\nof its courts. A pleyto in the Peninsula is held to be as great a\r\ncurse as a suit in Chancery in England, with the added evil of want\r\nof confidence in the administrators of the law. Their character would\r\nhardly be improved at a distance of 10,000 miles from the Peninsula;\r\nand if Spain has some difficulty in supplying herself at home with\r\nincorruptible functionaries, that difficulty would be augmented in\r\nher remotest possessions. There seemed to me much admirable machinery\r\nin the traditional and still existing usages and institutions of the\r\nnatives. Much might, no doubt, be done to lessen the dilatory, costly\r\nand troublesome character of lawsuits, by introducing more of natural\r\nand less of technical proceedings; by facilitating the production and\r\nexamination of evidence; by the suppression of the masses of papel\r\nsellado (documents upon stamped paper); by diminishing the cost and\r\nsimplifying the process of appeal; and, above all, by the introduction\r\nof a code applicable to the ordinary circumstances of social life.\r\n\r\nHe thinks the attempts to conglomerate the population in towns\r\nand cities injurious to the agricultural interests of the country;\r\nbut assuredly this agglomeration is friendly to civilization, good\r\ngovernment and the production of wealth, and more likely than the\r\ndispersion of the inhabitants to provide for the introduction of\r\nthose larger farms to which the Philippines must look for any very\r\nconsiderable augmentation of the produce of the land.\r\n\r\n\"The natural riches of the country are incalculable. There are immense\r\ntracts of the most feracious soil; brooks, streams, rivers, lakes,\r\non all sides; mountains of minerals, metals, marbles in vast variety;\r\nforests whose woods are adapted to all the ordinary purposes of life;\r\ngums, roots, medicinals, dyes, fruits in great variety. In many of\r\nthe islands the cost of a sufficiency of food for a family of five\r\nis only a cuarto, a little more than a farthing, a day. Some of\r\nthe edible roots grow to an enormous size, weighing from 50 to 70\r\nlbs.:--gutta-percha, caoutchouc, gum-lac, gamboge, and many other\r\ngums abound. Of fibres the number is boundless; in fact, the known\r\nand the unknown wealth of the islands only requires fit aptitudes\r\nfor its enormous development.\r\n\r\n\"With a few legislative reforms,\" he concludes, \"with improved\r\ninstruction of the clergy, the islands would become a paradise of\r\ninexhaustible riches, and of a well-being approachable in no other\r\nportion of the globe. The docility and intelligence of the natives,\r\ntheir imitative virtues (wanting though they be in forethought), make\r\nthem incomparably superior to any Asiatic or African race subjected to\r\nEuropean authority. Where deep thought and calculation are required,\r\nthey will fail; but their natural dispositions and tendencies, and\r\nthe present state of civilization among them, give every hope and\r\nencouragement for the future.\" [31]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFINANCE, TAXATION, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gross revenues of the Philippines are about 10,000,000 dollars. The\r\nbudget for 1859 is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    RECEIPTS.                          EXPENDITURE.\r\n                            Dollars.

I leave\r\nhere out of sight the enormous amount of fraud and crime, and the\r\npernicious effects upon the public morals of a universal toleration\r\nof smuggling, as well as the consideration of all the vexations,\r\ndelays, checks upon improvement, corruption of officials and the\r\nthousand inconveniences of fiscal interference at every stage and\r\nstep; and only look at the acknowledged cost of the machinery--it\r\namounts to about 5,000,000 dollars--so that the net produce to the\r\nState scarcely exceeds 2,000,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe whole receipt from the tobacco monopoly is 5,097,795 dollars. The\r\nexpenses for which this department is debited are (independently of\r\nthe proportion of the general charges of administration)--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Dollars. Cents.\r\n     Personal--\r\n         Collection of Tobaccos                24,604    0\r\n         Manufacture of Cigars                 44,366    0\r\n     Materiel--\r\n         Collection of Tobacco                 66,741   75\r\n         Manufactures of Cigars                 6,888    0\r\n         Purchase of Tobacco                1,412,503   30\r\n         Paper and other charges               62,865    3\r\n         Cost of sorting Tobacco               13,200   29\r\n         Cost of manufacturing              1,171,262   73\r\n         Charges for conveyance               259,321   76\r\n         Boxes, packing, warehousing, &c.     150,000    0\r\n                                            --------------\r\n                                            3,211,752   86\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that the net rendering of this most valuable production is only\r\n1,886,042·14 dollars, or 37 per cent. upon the gross amount, 63 per\r\ncent. being expended on the production of the tobacco and manufacture\r\nof the cigars. I am of opinion that from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 dollars\r\nmight be realized with immense benefit to the public by a tax upon\r\ncultivation, or the imposition of a simple export duty, or by a union\r\nof both. Production would thus be largely extended, prices moderated\r\nto the consumer and the net revenue probably more than doubled.\r\n\r\nFrom the produce of the lottery, 253,500 dollars, there have to be\r\ndeducted--expenses of administration, 4,472 dollars; prizes paid,\r\n195,000 dollars; prizes not claimed, 1,000 dollars; commission on\r\nsales of tickets, 4,680 dollars; making in all, 205,152 dollars; so\r\nthat this fertile source of misery, disappointment, and frequently\r\nof crime, does not produce a net income of 50,000 dollars to the\r\nState. It may well be doubted if such a source of revenue should be\r\nmaintained. The revenue derived from cock-fights, 86,326·25 dollars,\r\nis to some extent subject to the same condemnation, as gambling is\r\nthe foundation of both, but in the case of the galleras the produce\r\nis paid without deduction into the treasury.\r\n\r\nIn the Bisayas palm wine has been lately made the object of a State\r\nmonopoly which produces 324,362 dollars, but is very vexatious in its\r\noperation and much complained of by the Indians. The tax on spirituous\r\nliquors gives 1,465,638 dollars. The opium monopoly brings 44,333·34\r\ndollars; that of gunpowder, 21,406 dollars. Of smaller sources of\r\nincome the most remarkable are--Papal bulls, giving 58,000 dollars;\r\nstamps, 39,600 dollars; fines, 30,550 dollars; post-office stamps,\r\n19,490 dollars; fishery in Manila harbour, 6,500 dollars.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that there are no receipts from the sale or rental of\r\nlands. Public works, roads and bridges are in charge of the locality,\r\nwhile of the whole gross revenue more than seven-tenths are the\r\nproduce of monopolies.\r\n\r\nOf the government expenditure, under the head of Grace and Justice,\r\nthe clergy receive 488,329·28 dollars, and for pious works 39,801·83;\r\nJesuit missions to Mindanao, 25,000. The cost of the Audiencia is\r\n65,556; of the alcaldes and gobernadores, 53,332 dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the war department the cost of the staff is 154,148·80 dollars;\r\nof the infantry, 857,031·17 dollars; cavalry, 52,901·73 dollars;\r\nartillery, 192,408·71 dollars; engineers, 32,173 dollars; rations,\r\n140,644·31 dollars; matériel, 149,727·10 dollars; transport, 112,000\r\ndollars; special services, 216,673·89 dollars. In the finance expenses\r\nthe sum of 310,615·75 dollars appears as pensions.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the marine department is 235,671·82 dollars; cost\r\nof building, repairing, &c., 266,813·17 dollars; salaries, &c.,\r\nare 155,294·98 dollars; rations, 190,740·84 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe governor-general receives, including the secretariat, 31,056\r\ndollars; expenses, 2,500 dollars. The heaviest charge in the section of\r\ncivil services is 120,000 dollars for the mail steamers between Hong\r\nKong and Manila, and 35,000 dollars for the service between Spain and\r\nHong Kong. There is an additional charge for the post-office of 6,852\r\ndollars. The only receipt reported on this account is for post-office\r\nstamps, 19,490 dollars.\r\n\r\nI have made no reference to the minor details of the incomings and\r\noutgoings of Philippine finance. The mother country has little cause\r\nto complain, receiving as she does a net revenue of about 5s. per head\r\nfrom the Indian population. In fact, about half of the whole amount of\r\ndirect taxation goes to Spain, independently of what Spanish subjects\r\nreceive who are employed in the public service. The Philippines\r\nhappily have no debt, and, considering that the Indian pays nothing\r\nfor his lands, it cannot be said that he is heavily taxed. But that\r\nthe revenues are susceptible of immense development--that production,\r\nagricultural and manufactured, is in a backward and unsatisfactory\r\nstate--that trade and shipping might be enormously increased--and\r\nthat great changes might be most beneficially introduced into many\r\nbranches of administration, must be obvious to the political economist\r\nand the shrewd observer. The best evidence I can give of a grateful\r\nremembrance of the kindnesses I received will be the frank expression\r\nof opinions friendly to the progress and prosperity of these fertile\r\nand improveable regions. Meliorations many and great have already made\r\ntheir way; it suffices to look back upon the state of the Philippines,\r\n\"cramped, cabined and confined\" as they were, and to compare them\r\nwith their present half-emancipated condition. No doubt Spain has\r\nmuch to learn at home before she can be expected to communicate\r\ncommercial and political wisdom to her dependencies abroad. But she\r\nmay be animated by the experience she has had, and at last discover\r\nthat intercourse with opulent nations tends not to impoverish, but\r\nto enrich those who encourage and extend that intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTAXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown to the year 1784 so unproductive were the Philippines to\r\nthe Spanish revenues, that the treasury deficit was supplied by an\r\nannual grant of 250,000 dollars provided by the Mexican government. A\r\ncapitation tax was irregularly collected from the natives; also a\r\ncustom-house duty (almojarifango) on the small trade which existed,\r\nand an excise (alcabala) on interior sales. Even to the beginning of\r\nthe present century the Spanish American colonies furnished the funds\r\nfor the military expenses of Manila. In 1829 the treasury became an\r\nindependent branch of administration. Increase of tribute-paying\r\npopulation, the tobacco and wine monopoly, permission given to\r\nforeigners to establish themselves as merchants in the capital,\r\ndemand for native and consumption of foreign productions, and a\r\ngeneral tendency towards a more liberal policy, brought about their\r\nusual beneficial results; and, though slowly moving, the Philippines\r\nhave entered upon a career of prosperity susceptible of an enormous\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nThe capitation tax, or tribute paid by the natives, is the foundation\r\nof the financial system in the Philippines. It is the only direct\r\ntax (except for special cases), makes no distinction of persons\r\nand property, has the merit of antiquity, and is collected by a\r\nmachinery provided by the Indians themselves. Originally it was\r\nlevied in produce, but compounded for by the payment of a dollar\r\n(eight reales), raised afterwards to a dollar and a quarter, and\r\nfinally the friars have managed to add to the amount an additional\r\nfifty per cent., of which four-fifths are for church, and one-fifth\r\nfor commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe tribute is now due for every grown-up individual of a family, up\r\nto the age of sixty; the local authorities (cabezas de barangay), their\r\nwives and eldest or an adopted son, excepted. A cabeza is charged with\r\nthe collection of the tribute of his cabaceria, consisting generally\r\nof about fifty persons. There are many other exceptions, such as\r\ndischarged soldiers and persons claiming exemptions on particular\r\ngrounds, to say nothing of the uncertain collections from Indians\r\nnot congregated in towns or villages, and the certain non-collections\r\nfrom the wilder races. Buzeta estimates that only five per cent. of\r\nthe whole population pay the tribute. Beyond the concentrated groups\r\nof natives there is little control; nor is the most extended of\r\nexisting influences--the ecclesiastical--at all disposed to aid the\r\nrevenue collector at the price of public discontent, especially if\r\nthe claims of the convent are recognized and the wants of the church\r\nsufficiently provided for, which they seldom fail to be. The friar\r\nfrequently stands between the fiscal authority and the Indian debtor,\r\nand, as his great object is to be popular with his flock, he, when\r\nhis own expectations are satisfied, is naturally a feeble supporter of\r\nthe tax collector. The friar has a large direct interest in the money\r\ntribute, both in the sanctorum and the tithe; but the Indian has many\r\nmeans of conciliating the padre and does not fail to employ them, and\r\nthe padre's influence is not only predominant, but it is perpetually\r\npresent, and in constant activity. There is a decree of 1835 allowing\r\nthe Indians to pay tribute in kind, but at rates so miserably low that\r\nI believe there is now scarcely an instance of other than metallic\r\npayments. The present amount levied is understood to be--\r\n\r\n\r\n     For the Government                  10 rials of plate.\r\n     For the tithe                        1   ,,  ,,   ,,\r\n     Community Fund (Caja de Comunidad)   1   ,,  ,,   ,,\r\n     Sanctorum (Church)                   3   ,,  ,,   ,,\r\n                                         --\r\n                                         15 rials, or 1 7/8 dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich at 4s. 6d. per dollar makes a capitation tax of about 8s. 6d. per\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe Sangleys (mestizos of Chinese origin) pay 20 rials government\r\ntribute, or 25 rials in all, being about 14s. sterling.\r\n\r\nThere are some special levies for local objects, but they are not\r\nheavy in amount.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have been particularly selected to be the victims of the\r\ntax-gatherer, and, considering the general lightness of taxation,\r\nand that the Chinese had been invited to the Philippines with every\r\nassurance of protection, and as a most important element for the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the country, the decree of 1828\r\nwill appear tolerably exacting. It divides Chinese settlers into\r\nthree classes:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMerchants who are to pay a monthly tax of 10 dollars   £27  0 per annum.\r\nShopkeepers who are to pay a monthly tax of 4 dollars   10 16  ,,  ,,\r\nAll others who have to pay a monthly tax of 2 dollars    5  8  ,,  ,,\r\n\r\n\r\nNot consenting to this, and if unmarried, they might quit the country\r\nin six months, or pay the value of their tribute in labour, and\r\nthey were, after a delay of three months in the payment of the tax,\r\nto be fineable at 2 rials a day. At the time of issuing the decree\r\nthere were 5,708 Chinese in the capital, of whom immediately 800 left\r\nfor China, 1,083 fled to the mountains and were kindly received and\r\nprotected by the natives, 453 were condemned to the public works,\r\nand the rest left in such a condition of discontent and misery that\r\nin 1831 the intendente made a strong representation to the government\r\nin their favour, and in 1834 authority was given to modify the whole\r\nfiscal legislation as regarded the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, on landing in Manila, whether as sailors or intending\r\nsettlers, are compelled to inhabit a public establishment called the\r\nAlcaiceria de San Fernando, for which payment is exacted, and there\r\nis a revenue resulting to the State from the profits thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nOPENING THE NEW PORTS OF ILOILO, SUAL AND ZAMBOANGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of the ports of Sual, Iloilo and Zamboanga to foreign\r\ntrade, was of course intended to give development to the local\r\ninterests of the northern, central and southern portions of the\r\narchipelago, the localities selected appearing to offer the greatest\r\nencouragements, and on the determination of the Spanish government\r\nbeing known, her Britannic Majesty's Consul at Manila recommended\r\nthe appointment of British vice-consuls at Sual and Iloilo, and\r\ncertainly no better selections could have been made than were made on\r\nthe occasion, for the most competent gentleman in each of the ports\r\nwas fixed upon.\r\n\r\nMr. Farren's report, which has been laid before Parliament, very\r\nfairly represents the claims of the new ports and their dependencies;\r\neach has its special recommendations. The population of the northern\r\ndivision, comprising Pangasinan, the two Ilocos (North and South),\r\nAbra and La Union, may be considered among the most industrious,\r\nopulent and intelligent of the Philippines. Cagayan produces the\r\nlargest quantity of the finest quality of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe central division, the most thickly peopled of the whole, has\r\nlong furnished Manila with a large proportion of its exports, which,\r\nin progress of time, will, no doubt, be sent directly from the ports\r\nof production to those of consumption; while the southern, and the\r\nleast promising at present, has every element which soil and climate\r\ncan contribute to encourage the cultivation of vast tracts hitherto\r\nunreached by the civilizing powers of commerce and colonization.\r\n\r\nThe population in the northern division is large. In Ilocos, South and\r\nNorth, there are twelve towns with from 5,000 to 8,000 inhabitants;\r\nseven with 8,000 to 12,000; seven with from 12,000 to 20,000; and\r\nthree with from 20,000 to 33,000. In Pangasinan, nine towns with from\r\n5,000 to 12,000; seven with from 12,000 to 20,000; and three with\r\nfrom 20,000 to 26,000 inhabitants. The capital (Cabazera) of Cagayan\r\nhas above 15,000 inhabitants. The middle zone presents a still greater\r\nnumber of populous places. Zebu has fourteen towns with 5,000 to 10,000\r\ninhabitants, and nine towns of from 10,000 to 12,000; and in Iloilo\r\nthere are seven towns with from 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants; fourteen\r\ntowns with from 10,000 to 20,000; seven with from 20,000 to 30,000;\r\ntwo with from 30,000 to 40,000; and one (Haro) with 46,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThese statistics for 1857 show a great increase of population since\r\nMr. Farren's returns and prove that the removal of restrictions\r\nhas acted most beneficially upon the common weal, imperfect as the\r\nemancipation has been. There cannot be a doubt that more expansive\r\nviews would lead to the extension of a liberal policy, and that\r\nmines of unexplored and undeveloped treasure are to be found in the\r\nagricultural and commercial resources of these regions. The importance\r\nof direct intercourse with foreign countries is increased by the\r\nfact that, for many months of the year, the monsoons interrupt the\r\ncommunication of the remoter districts with the capital. The old\r\nspirit of monopoly not only denied to the producer the benefit of\r\nhigh prices, and to the consumer the advantage of low prices, but\r\nthe trade itself necessarily fell into the hands of unenterprising\r\nand sluggish merchants, wholly wanting in that spirit of enterprise\r\nwhich is the primum mobile of commercial prosperity. For it is the\r\ncondition, curse and condemnation of monopoly, that while it narrows\r\nthe vision and cramps the intellect of the monopolist, it delivers the\r\ngreat interests of commerce to the guardianship of an inferior race\r\nof traders, excluding those higher qualities which are associated\r\nwith commercial enterprise when launched upon the wide ocean of\r\nadventurous and persevering energy. How is the tree to reach its full\r\ngrowth and expansion whose branches are continually lopped off lest\r\ntheir shadows should extend, and their fruit fall for the benefit of\r\nothers than its owner?\r\n\r\nBut in reference to the beneficial changes which have been introduced,\r\ntheir value has been greatly diminished by the imperfect character of\r\nthe concessions. They should have been complete; they should, while\r\nopening the ports to foreign trade, have allowed that trade full scope\r\nand liberty. The discussions which have taken place have, however,\r\nbeen eminently useful, and the part taken in favour of commercial\r\nfreedom by Mr. Bosch and Mr. Loney, both British vice-consuls, has\r\nbeen creditable to their zeal and ability. In the Philippines, the\r\ntendency of public opinion is decidedly in the right direction. The\r\nresistance which for so many years, or even centuries, opposed the\r\nadmission of strangers to colonial ports, no doubt was grounded upon\r\nthe theory that they would bring less of trade than they would carry\r\naway--that they would participate in the large profits of those who\r\nheld the monopoly, but not confer upon them any corresponding or\r\ncountervailing advantages.\r\n\r\nMr. Farren states that, in 1855, \"the British trade with the\r\nPhilippines exceeded in value that of Great Britain with several\r\nof the States of Europe, with that of any one State or port in\r\nAfrica, was greater than the British trade with Mexico, Columbia,\r\nor Guatemala, and nearly ranked in the second-class division of the\r\nnational trade with Asia, the total value of exports and imports\r\napproaching three millions sterling. The export of sugar to Great\r\nBritain and her colonies was, in 1854, 42,400 tons, that to Great\r\nBritain alone having gradually grown upon the exports of 1852, which\r\nwas 5,061 tons, to 27,254 tons, which exceeds the exports to the\r\nwhole world in 1852. The imports of British goods and manufactures,\r\nwhich was 427,020l. in value in 1845, exceeded 1,000,000l. sterling in\r\n1853.\" It still progresses, and the removal of any one restriction,\r\nthe encouragement of any one capability, will add to that progress,\r\nand infallibly augment the general prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the island of Panay for 1857 give to the province\r\nof Iloilo 527,970; to that of Capiz, 143,713; and to that of Antique,\r\n77,639; making in all 749,322, or nearly three-quarters of a million\r\nof inhabitants. The low lands of Capiz are subject to frequent\r\ninundations. It has a fine river, whose navigation is interfered with\r\nby a sandbank at its mouth. The province is productive, and gives two\r\ncrops of rice in the year. The harbours of Batan and of Capiz (the\r\ncabacera) are safe for vessels of moderate size. The inhabitants of\r\nAntique, which occupies all the western coast of Panay, are the least\r\nindustrious of the population of the island. The coast is dangerous. It\r\nhas two pueblos, Bugason and Pandan, with more than 10,000 souls. The\r\ncabacera San José has less than half that number. The roads of the\r\nprovinces are bad and communications with Iloilo difficult. The lands\r\nare naturally fertile, but have not been turned to much account by the\r\nIndians. There are only forty-two mestizos in the province. There is\r\na small pearl and turtle fishery, and some seaslugs are caught for\r\nthe Chinese market.\r\n\r\nIloilo has, no doubt, been fixed on as the seat of the government,\r\nfrom the facilities it offers to navigation; but it is much smaller,\r\nless opulent and even less active than many of the towns in its\r\nneighbourhood. The province of Iloilo is, on the whole, perhaps the\r\nmost advanced of any in the Philippines, excepting the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the capital. It has fine mountainous scenery, richly\r\nadorned with forest trees, while the plains are eminently fertile. All\r\ntropical produce appears to flourish. The manufacturing industry of\r\nthe women is characteristic, and has been referred to in other places,\r\nespecially with reference to the extreme beauty of the piña fabric. Of\r\nthe mode of preparing the fabric Mallat gives this account:--\r\n\r\n\"It is from the leaves of the pine-apple--the plant which produces\r\nsuch excellent fruits--that the white and delicate threads are drawn\r\nwhich are the raw material of the nipis or piña stuffs. The sprouts\r\nof ananas are planted, which sometimes grow under the fruit to the\r\nnumber of a dozen; they are torn off, and are set in a light soil,\r\nsheltered, if possible, and they are watered as soon as planted. After\r\nfour months the crown is removed, in order to prevent the fruiting,\r\nand that the leaves may grow broader and longer. At the age of eight\r\nmonths they are an ell in length, and six fingers in breadth, when they\r\nare torn away and stretched out on a plank, and, while held by his\r\nfoot, the Indian with a piece of broken earthenware scrapes the pulp\r\ntill the fibres appear. These are taken by the middle, and cautiously\r\nraised from one end to the other; they are washed twice or thrice in\r\nwater, dried in the air and cleaned; they are afterwards assorted\r\naccording to their lengths and qualities. Women tie the separate\r\nthreads together in packets, and they are ready for the weaver's\r\nuse. In the weaving it is desirable to avoid either too high or too\r\nlow a temperature--too much drought, or too much humidity--and the\r\nmost delicate tissues are woven under the protection of a mosquito\r\nnet. Such is the patience of the weaver, that she sometimes produces\r\nnot more than half an inch of cloth in a day. The finest are called\r\npinilian, and are only made to order. Ananas are cultivated solely\r\nfor the sake of the fibre, which is sold in the market. Most of the\r\nstuffs are very narrow; when figured with silk, they sell for about\r\n10s. per yard. The plain, intended for embroidery, go to Manila,\r\nwhere the most extravagant prices are paid for the finished work.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Vice-Consul Bosch has written an interesting report on the\r\ncapabilities of the province of Pangasinan, and of Sual, its principal\r\nport. The circumference of coast is from fifty to sixty miles on the\r\nsouth and east of the Gulf of Lingayen. The interior abounds with\r\nfacilities for water communication, and the most important river,\r\nthe Agno, enters the sea at St. Isidro, about one and a half mile\r\nfrom Sual. The Agno has about seventy to eighty miles of internal\r\nnavigation, and brings produce from the adjacent provinces of La\r\nUnion and Nueva Ecija, The exports to Manila are generally made from\r\nSual, those for China from Dagupan. Dagupan is at the mouth of a large\r\nestuary, but a bar prevents the entry of any large vessel. The want of\r\nsafe anchorage is the disadvantage of all the coast of the province,\r\nwith the exception of the harbour of Sual. This harbour, though small,\r\nis safe: it is nearly circular. It would hold from twelve to fifteen\r\nlarge vessels and thirty to forty coasters, and is well protected on\r\nevery side, but there is a somewhat dangerous bank within the port.\r\n\r\nThere are only about 400 houses in Sual: they are scattered on the\r\nplain in front of the harbour, and are of wood. There are, besides,\r\n100 Indian huts (chozas) constructed of the nipa palm. The church is\r\na poor, provisional edifice.\r\n\r\nSual is exhibiting some signs of improvement. The road to the\r\nneighbouring province of Zambales is in progress. The allied forces in\r\nCochin China have been lately drawing provisions, especially cattle,\r\nfrom Sual. The value of the exports from Sual, for 1858, is 670,095\r\ndollars; the imports of foreign goods and manufactures into the three\r\nports of the province--Dagupan, Binmaley and Lingayen--amount to\r\n464,116 dollars, all brought by coasting vessels, of which 75 belong\r\nto the province. The largest pueblo of the province is San Carlos,\r\nwith 26,376 inhabitants; the second, Binmaley, with 24,911; the third,\r\nLingayen, with 23,063; but the population of Sual is only 3,451. Rice\r\nand sugar are the leading articles of produce exported, but there\r\nis at Calasiao a considerable manufacture of hats, cigar-cases, mats\r\nand other fabrics of the various fibres of the country. There are no\r\nlarge estates, nor manufactures on an extensive scale. Everything is\r\ndone by small proprietors and domestic industry. There are many places\r\nwhere markets (called tiangues) are periodically held, and articles of\r\nall sorts brought thither for sale. It is calculated that Pangasinan\r\ncould give 20,000 tons of rice for exportation, after providing for\r\nlocal wants. The sugar, though it might be produced abundantly, is\r\ncarelessly prepared. Much wood is cut for ship-building and other\r\npurposes. On the arrival of the N. E. monsoon commercial enterprise\r\nbegins and many shipments take place; the roads are passable, the\r\nwarehouses filled with goods: this lasts till the end of June or\r\nJuly. Then come on the heavy rains: the vessels for the coasting trade\r\nare laid up for the season; the rivers overflow; most of the temporary\r\nbridges are carried away by the floods; everybody is occupied by what\r\nthe Spaniards call their \"interior life;\" they settle the accounts of\r\nthe past year and prepare for that which is to come, and the little\r\nforeign trade of Sual is the only evidence of trading activity.\r\n\r\nLabour is moderately remunerated. Taking fifty ship carpenters,\r\nemployed in one yard, the least paid had 5 rials, the highest 10 rials\r\nper week (say 3s. to 6s.). They are also allowed two measures of rice\r\nand a little meat or fish. A field labourer (or peon) has a rial a\r\nday and his food. A cart with a buffalo and leader costs 1 1/2 rial\r\nper day.\r\n\r\nAlmost all purchases are made by brokers (personeros), who, for a\r\ncommission, generally of 5 per cent., and a guarantee of 2 1/2 per\r\ncent., collect the products of the country from the cultivators, to\r\nwhom they make advances--always in silver; and it sometimes passes\r\nthrough many hands before it reaches the labouring producer.\r\n\r\nThere are few native Spaniards in Pangasinan. A good many mestizos\r\nare devoted to commerce. In Lingayen, with 23,000 inhabitants, there\r\nare more than 1,000 mestizos; in Binmaley, with 24,000 inhabitants,\r\nonly twenty-two mestizos: the first being a trading, the second\r\nan agricultural, pueblo. There are few Indians who have acquired\r\nopulence. The Chinese element has penetrated, and they obtain more\r\nand more influence as active men of business. No Oriental race can\r\ncompete with them where patience, perseverance and economy can be\r\nbrought into play. They are not liked; but they willingly suffer\r\nmuch annoyance and spread and strengthen themselves by unanimity of\r\npurpose. In Calasiao they are said in two years to have established\r\nnearly eighty shops, and were gradually insinuating themselves into\r\nall profitable occupations--attending the markets both as buyers and\r\nsellers, and establishing relations with the interior such as no native\r\nIndian would have ever contemplated. Nor in the ordinary transactions\r\nof life do they make the mistake of requiring extravagant profits. A\r\nChinaman may, indeed, ask a high price or offer a low one in his\r\ndifferent relations, but when he sees his way to a clear profit, he\r\nwill not let the bargain escape him. There is an increasing demand\r\nfor European merchandise, of which the Chinese are the principal\r\nimporters; and they, above all other men, are likely to open new\r\nchannels of trade. The current rate of interest is 10 per cent.;\r\nthough the church funds are lent at 6 per cent. to those whom the\r\nclergy are disposed to favour, which indeed is the legal rate.\r\n\r\nMr. Bosch's return for the year 1858 shows that eight large vessels,\r\nwith 7,185 tons, and 282 coasters, with 7,780 tons, entered the port\r\nof Sual. Only four of the former carried cargoes away, two having\r\ngone to repair damages, and two being Spanish government steamers\r\nfor the remittal to Manila of money which amounted to 210,000 dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nZAMBOANGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe steamed away from Manila on the 20th December. It was our first\r\npurpose to visit Labuan, which had become of some interest to me as\r\nGovernor of Hong Kong, having been made of late the penal settlement\r\nfor a certain number of Chinese convicts. Two groups of sixty each\r\nhad been sent thither, and the Governor was desirous their number\r\nshould be increased. I do not see how the settlement can be made a\r\nprosperous or productive one. The coals which it furnishes are not\r\nliked by our engineers, and seldom employed if English or Welsh coals\r\ncan be obtained. A considerable quantity was reported to me as raised\r\nand lying on the shore without demand, but I found no willingness,\r\neither on the part of the naval authorities or of the merchants, to\r\npurchase it. I expect both China and Japan will be in a condition to\r\nprovide this very important article on cheaper terms and of better\r\nquality than that of Labuan, or any part of Borneo. I should have\r\nbeen glad to have had an opportunity of forming an opinion, grounded\r\non my own observations, as to the prospects of Sarawak. I am disposed\r\nto believe the Government has acted judiciously in refusing to buy\r\nthe colony, and to encumber the treasury with the charges which its\r\nestablishments would inevitably entail. The arguments which I have\r\nseen put forward in its favour by the advocates of the purchase,\r\nhave certainly little weight. To represent the locality as of any\r\nimportance as a place of call between Europe and China, is to display\r\nextraordinary geographical and commercial ignorance: it is hundreds\r\nof miles out of the regular course, and has in itself no attraction to\r\ninduce any vessel to waste the time which must be expended in visiting\r\nit. It has a fertile soil, which may be said of the whole circumjacent\r\nregion--of almost every island in the tropical archipelagos; but it\r\nmust depend principally on imported labour, costly and capricious in\r\nits supply, and which must be directed by European machinery, still\r\nmore costly and uncertain, for the climate is, and will long continue,\r\nunfriendly to the health of European settlers. The native population\r\nis too barbarous to labour; with few wants, they have few motives\r\nto exertion. I have had the advantage of much conversation with the\r\nCatholic Vicar Apostolic of Borneo, whose knowledge of the natives\r\nis probably greater than that of any other European, as he has lived\r\nso much among them in the discharge of the duties of his mission. He\r\nrepresents the different tribes as engaged in perpetual wars with one\r\nanother, each taking any opportunity of pillaging or doing mischief to\r\nits neighbours; and our involving ourselves in the native quarrels,\r\nby ill-judged partisanship, must lead, he thinks, to much cruelty\r\nand injustice. He gave me many particulars of the savage practices\r\nof which he had been an eye-witness, particularly in the displays\r\nand processions of human heads as trophies of victory. Although\r\nI had not an opportunity of visiting Borneo and of witnessing\r\nthere the progress that has been made under European influences,\r\nI have had so many means of studying the character of the native\r\nand unsubdued races in the territories of Spain and the Netherlands,\r\nthat I feel quite justified in the conclusion, that little is to be\r\nexpected from their co-operation, either as producers of tropical,\r\nor consumers of European, articles. The great element which is\r\nnow revolutionizing these regions, is the introduction of Chinese\r\nlabour, which has received a check not easily to be surmounted in\r\nthe unfortunate outbreak at Sarawak, after the events in Canton;\r\nbut the introduction of the Chinese must be spontaneous, and not\r\nforced. The Chinese field-labourer works unwillingly for a master\r\nwho is to receive the profits of his labour; but far different are\r\nhis feelings, his activity and perseverance, when the profits are\r\nall to be his own. Then, indeed, he becomes a valuable settler,\r\nfrom whom much is to be expected. Our new treaties--the presence\r\nof British shipping in so many ports of China--the supersession of\r\nthe heavy junks by the square-rigged vessels of the West, which the\r\nhabit of insuring that the Chinese are now adopting cannot fail to\r\npromote--will all assist in the transfer of the surplus population of\r\nChina to regions where their industry will find a wider scope and a\r\nmore profitable field. The adventurous spirit in China is becoming\r\nmore and more active. The tens of thousands who have emigrated to\r\nCalifornia and Australia, and the thousands who have returned with\r\nsavings which they have deemed a sufficiency, have given an impulse to\r\nthe emigrating passion, which will act strongly and beneficially in all\r\ncountries towards which it may be directed. In process of time, and\r\nwith the co-operation of the mandarins, who are really interested in\r\nthe removal of a wretched, sometimes starving and always discontented,\r\nsocial element, the difficulties attaching to the removal of females\r\nmay in time be surmounted, and the Chinese may perpetuate, what they\r\nhave never yet done, a Chinese community in the lands where they\r\nsettle. No doubt the mestizo mixture of races--the descendants of\r\nChinese fathers and Indian mothers--is now extensively spread, and\r\nis a great improvement upon the pure Malay or Indian breed. The type\r\nof the father is more strongly preserved than that of the mother;\r\nits greater vigour has given it predominance. The Chinese mestizo\r\nis physically a being superior to the Indian--handsomer in person,\r\nstronger in limb, more active in intellect, more persevering in labour,\r\nmore economical in habits. The marvellous exodus of Chinese from their\r\ncountry is one of the most remarkable ethnological circumstances of\r\nmodern history, and is producing and will produce extraordinary and\r\nlasting results. I do not believe any of the other Oriental races\r\nable to withstand the secret and widely spreading influences of\r\nChinese competition and superiority. Dealt with justly and fairly,\r\nthe Chinese are the most manageable of men, but they will be dangerous\r\nwhere despotism drives them to despair.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of our voyage we arrived at Zamboanga. Indian\r\nhouses were visible through the plantain trees, and amidst the\r\nwoodlands of the coast, and a large fortification, with the yellow\r\nand scarlet Spanish flag, advised us of our adjacency to the seat of\r\ngovernment. We sent on shore, and found the guns and the garrison\r\nwere not in a condition to return our salute, but we received an\r\nearly and cordial communication from the governor, Colonel Navarro,\r\ninviting us to take up our abode at his residence, and we landed\r\nat a convenient wooden pier, which is carried out for some distance\r\ninto the harbour. There was a small body of soldiers to meet us on\r\nlanding. In walking about we found one street wholly occupied by\r\nChinese shopkeepers, well supplied with European and Chinese wares;\r\nthey generally appeared contented and prosperous, and will certainly\r\nfind the means of supplying whatever the population may demand; they\r\nwill leave nothing undone which is likely to extend their trade or\r\naugment their profits. There are about three hundred Chinese settled\r\nin Zamboanga, mostly men of Fokien. We walked to the fortification,\r\nand on our way met several of the Mahomedan women who had been captured\r\nin a late fray with natives; their breasts were uncovered, and they\r\nwore not the veils which almost invariably hide the faces of the\r\ndaughters of Islam. We learnt that these females were of the labouring\r\nand inferior classes; but in the fortification we saw the wives and\r\nchildren of the chiefs, who had been captured, and they presented the\r\nmost marvellous contrasts, between the extreme ugliness of the aged\r\nand the real beauty of some of the young. One mother especially, who\r\nhad a child on her haunches, appeared to me singularly graceful and\r\npleasing. Most of the captured chiefs had been sent to Manila; but\r\nin another part of the fortress there were some scores of prisoners,\r\namong whom, one seemed to exercise ascendency over the rest, and\r\nhe repeated some of the formula of the Koran in Arabic words. The\r\nSpaniards represented them as a fierce, faithless and cruel race, but\r\nthey have constantly opposed successful resistance to their invaders.\r\n\r\nNext to Luzon, Mindanao is the largest of the Philippines. Though its\r\nsurface is 3,200 square leagues in extent, the Spaniards do not occupy\r\none-tenth of the whole. The number of Mahomedans (Moros) is great\r\nin the interior, and they are the subjects of an independent Sultan,\r\nwhose capital is Selangan, and who keeps up amicable relations with the\r\nSpanish authorities. To judge by some of their native manufactures\r\nwhich I saw at Zamboanga, they are by no means to be considered\r\nas barbarians. The inland country is mountainous, but has some\r\nfine lakes and rivers little visited by strangers. There are many\r\nspacious bays. Storms and earthquakes are frequent visitants. The\r\nforests are said to be extensive, and filled with gigantic trees,\r\nbut travellers report the jungle to be impenetrable. Mines of gold,\r\nquicksilver and sulphur are said to abound. Besides Zamboanga, the\r\nSpaniards have settlements in Misamis, Caraga and New Guipuzcoa,\r\nbut they are reported to be unhealthy from the immense putrefaction\r\nof decaying vegetables produced by a most feracious soil, under the\r\ninfluence of a tropical sun. Beyond the Moros, and in the wildest\r\nparts of the mountains, are coloured races in a low state of savage\r\nexistence. Mindanao was one of the earliest conquests of Magallanes\r\n(1521). The Augustine friars were the first missionaries, and they\r\nstill retain almost a monopoly of religious instruction, but their\r\nsuccess among the Mahomedans has been small. Many attempts have been\r\nmade by the Spaniards to subdue the interior, but, however great\r\ntheir temporary success, they have never been able long to maintain\r\nthemselves against the fanaticism of the Moros, the dangers and\r\ndifficulties of the country and the climate, while supported only by\r\ninadequate military means. Misamis is used as a penal settlement. The\r\nSpaniards have not penetrated far into the interior of this part of the\r\nisland, which is peopled by a race of Indians said not to be hostile,\r\nbut, being frequently at war with the more formidable Mahomedans,\r\nthey are considered by the Spaniards as affording them some protection,\r\ntheir locality dividing the European settlements from the territory of\r\nthe Moors. But there is little development of agriculture or industry,\r\nand not one inhabitant in ten of the province pays tribute. The Jesuits\r\nhad formerly much success in these regions; on their expulsion the\r\nRecolets (barefooted Augustines) occupied their places, but it would\r\nseem with less acceptance. The settlers and the Indians recognizing\r\nthe Spanish authority have been so frequently molested by the Moors\r\nthat their numbers are far less than they were formerly, and it is\r\nbelieved the revenues are quite inadequate to pay the expenses of\r\nthe establishments; but it is said some progress is being made, and\r\nif all impediments to commercial intercourse were removed, a great\r\namelioration in the condition and prospects of the natives would\r\nresult. Caraga, from which New Guipuzcoa has been lately detached,\r\nhas Surigao for its capital, and is on the north-east corner of the\r\nisland. The dominions of the Sultan of Mindanao mark the limits of the\r\nprovince. A race of Indians remarkable for the whiteness of their skin,\r\nand supposed to be of Japanese descent, called Tago-balvoys, live on\r\nthe borders of a creek in the neighbourhood of a town bearing the name\r\nof Bisig, a station of the Recolets. Some of this race pay tribute,\r\nand live in a state of constant hostility with the Moros. They are\r\nadvanced in civilization beyond the neighbouring tribes. Butuan, in\r\nthis province, was the last landing place of Magallanes; he planted\r\na cross there, and the Indians took part in the ceremonials, and\r\nprofess Christianity to the present hour. The Moros have destroyed\r\nsome of the earlier establishments of the Spaniards. There are immense\r\ntracts of uncultivated and fertile lands. Teak is reported to abound\r\nin the forests, which are close to the habitations of the settlers. The\r\norang-utan is common, and there are many varieties of apes and monkeys,\r\nwild beasts, particularly buffaloes and deer, and several undescribed\r\nspecies of quadrupeds. The Spaniards say that the province of Caraga\r\nis the richest of the Philippines; it is certainly one of the least\r\nexplored. A Frenchman has been engaged in working the gold mines;\r\nI know not with what success. A favourite food of the natives is\r\nthe wild honey, which is collected in considerable quantities,\r\nand eaten with fruits and roots. The Butuan River is navigable\r\nfor boats. There are very many separate races of natives, among\r\nwhom the Mandayos are said to be handsome, and to bear marks of\r\nEuropean physiognomy. Some of the tribes are quite black, fierce and\r\nungovernable. Cinnamon and pepper are believed to be indigenous. Wax,\r\nmusk and tortoise-shell are procurable, but as the Spanish settlements\r\nare not much beyond the coast little is done for the encouragement\r\nof the productive powers of the interior. Gold, however, no doubt\r\nfrom the facility of its transport, is not an unimportant article\r\nof export, and the Spaniards complain that the natives attend to\r\nnothing else, so that there is often much suffering from dearth,\r\nand the insalubrity of the climate deters strangers from locating\r\nthemselves. This is little to be wondered at, as the attacks of pirates\r\nare frequent and the powers of government weak. Along the coasts are\r\ntowers provided with arms and ammunition for their defence; but the\r\npirates frequently interrupt the communications by sea, on which the\r\ninhabitants almost wholly depend, there being no passable roads. On\r\nthe approach of the piratical boats the natives generally abandon\r\ntheir own and flee to the mountains. There are many Mahomedan tribes\r\nwho take no part in these outrages, such as the Bagobos, Cuamanes\r\nand others. Even the mails are interrupted by the pirates, and often\r\ndelayed for days in localities where they seek shelter. All these\r\ndrawbacks notwithstanding, the number of tributaries is said to have\r\ngreatly increased, and the influence of the friars to have extended\r\nitself. I have compared various statistical returns, and find many\r\ncontradictions and inconsistencies. [32] Some evidence that little\r\nprogress has been made is seen in the fact that in the province of\r\nSurigao, where the census gives 18,848 Indians, there are only 148\r\nmestizos; in that of Misamis, only 266 mestizos to 46,517 Indians; in\r\nZamboanga, to 10,191 Indians, 16 mestizos; Basilan, 447 Indians and 4\r\nmestizos; Bislig, 12,718 Indians and 21 mestizos; Davao, 800 Indians,\r\nno mestizo. This state of things assuredly proves that the island of\r\nMindanao, whatever be its fertility, has few attractions for strangers,\r\notherwise the proportion of the mixed races to the population would\r\nbe very different from what it appears to be. Father Zuñiga, who,\r\nin 1799, published an account of the visit of General Alava, gives\r\nmany particulars of the then state of the island, and suggests many\r\nplans for extending Spanish influence.\r\n\r\nZamboanga is not likely to become a port of much importance unless\r\nit is wholly emancipated from fiscal restrictions. The introduction\r\nof the custom-house has driven away the whalers that formerly visited\r\nthe harbours; there is little capital, and the trading establishments\r\nare on a very small scale. The roads in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nare in very tolerable order; the villages have the general character\r\nof Indian pueblos; the country is rich in all the varieties of\r\ntropical vegetation; but the interior, even close to the cabaceras,\r\nis imperfectly known. Its produce is small in reference to the obvious\r\nfertility of the soil. Some companies of troops arrived during our\r\nstay at Zamboanga, and it is probable an effort is to be made to\r\nstrengthen and widen the authority of the Spanish government.\r\n\r\nOf the arms used by the Moros the governor had a large collection,\r\nconsisting of long spears, swords of various forms, handsomely\r\nadorned kreeses, daggers and knives displaying no small amount of\r\nmanufacturing art.\r\n\r\nConfined as the Spaniards are to a narrow strip of land along the\r\ncoast, it may be supposed there are few conveniences for locomotion,\r\nnevertheless a carriage was found, and a pair of horses, and harness\r\nsuch as it was, and an Indian driver, and thus we managed to obtain\r\na very pleasant evening ride into the country, and had an opportunity\r\nof seeing its great fertility and its varied productions, leading to\r\nnatural feelings of regret that so many of the boons of Providence\r\nshould remain unenjoyed and unimproved, accompanied with the hope that\r\nbetter days may dawn. But the world is full of undeveloped treasures,\r\nand its \"Yarrows unvisited\" promise a bright futurity.\r\n\r\nThere would seem to have been some increase in the population of\r\nZamboanga. In 1779 Zuñiga reports it to be 5,612 souls, \"including\r\nIndians, Spaniards, soldiers and convicts;\" in 1818 the number\r\nis stated to have been 8,640; in 1847, 7,190. The Guia of 1850\r\ngives 8,618; that of 1858, 10,191, of whom 16 were mestizos, and\r\ntribute-payers 3,871; but I do not think much reliance can be placed\r\non the statistical returns. The last states that the marriages were\r\n55, the births 429, the deaths 956, which represents a fearful\r\nmortality. In the province of Misamis for the same period the\r\nproportion of births to deaths was 2,155 to 845.\r\n\r\nA great value is attached to some of the canes which are found on\r\nthe island of Palawan, or Paragua, especially where they are of\r\nvariegated colours, or pure white, and without the interruption of\r\na knot, so as to serve for walking-sticks. I was informed that two\r\nhundred dollars had been given for a fine specimen.\r\n\r\nA gold-headed sticky with a silk cord and tassels, is the emblem of\r\nauthority in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nILOILO AND PANAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three ports lately opened to foreign commerce, Iloilo is the\r\nmost promising. The province of Iloilo is one of the most populous of\r\nthe Philippines. It contains more than half a million of inhabitants,\r\nand though portions of the province are very thinly peopled, there is\r\nan average exceeding 2,000 inhabitants per square league. Independently\r\nof the pueblos which I visited, and of which some description will\r\nbe given, Cabatuan has 23,000 inhabitants, Miagao 31,000, Dumangas\r\n25,000, Janiuay 22,000, Pototan 34,600, and several others more than\r\n10,000 souls. The province is not only one of the most numerously\r\npeopled, it is, perhaps, the most productive in agricultural, the\r\nmost active in manufacturing, industry, and among the best instructed\r\nof the Philippines. [33] It has extensive and cultivated plains and\r\nforest-covered mountains; its roads are among the best I have seen\r\nin the archipelago. At the entrance of the channel are a number of\r\nislands called the Seven (mortal) Sins--Los Siete Pecados. The large\r\nisland of Guimaras limits the channel on the south; it was visited\r\nby some of our party, who returned delighted with the extensive\r\nstalactite caverns which they explored, reaching them with some\r\ndifficulty over the rocks, through the woods and across the streams\r\nwhich arrested their progress. The forests are full of game and the\r\nriver Cabatuan abounds with crocodiles. There are many rivulets and\r\nrivers which greatly assist the cultivator, and we found a good supply\r\nof cattle. The ponies of Iloilo are among the best in the archipelago,\r\nand some attention is paid to the breeding of sheep. A good deal\r\nof salt is made, and there is a considerable fishery of trepang\r\n(sea-slug) and tortoises for the sake of the shells. But the island is\r\nmost renowned for the piña fabrics called nipas and sinamays, some of\r\nwhich are of exquisite fineness and beauty; they are largely exported,\r\nand their perfection has given them a vast reputation even in Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the Spaniards they found the district occupied\r\nby painted Indians, full of superstitions, which, notwithstanding\r\nthe teachings of the Augustine friars, are still found to prevail,\r\nespecially at the time of any public calamity. They are among the\r\nbest formed of the Indians, speak a dialect of the Bisayan, which\r\nthey called Hiligueyna, but in the remoter parts another idiom named\r\nthe Halayo prevails. The Augustines boast of having converted fifty\r\nthousand families in 1566, but they were not able to induce them to\r\ncultivate their lands and to store their surplus produce, and the\r\nlocusts having desolated the district, in the two following years more\r\nthan half the population perished of hunger. But the missionaries\r\nmade no progress among the Negritos who dwelt in the wilder parts\r\nof the mountainous regions, and who were joined by many desiring to\r\nescape from the authority of the invaders. These savages have not\r\nunfrequently attacked the villages of the converted Indians, but of\r\nlate years have found it more prudent and profitable to bring down\r\ntheir wax and pitch, and exchange them for rice and garments. They\r\nhave no general ruler, but each clan has its recognized head, and\r\nit is said that, when perplexed as to choice of a successor to a\r\ndeparted chief, they send deputations to the missionaries and ask\r\ntheir advice and assistance to regulate their choice. Formerly the\r\ndistrict was frequently attacked by pirates, who committed great\r\nravages and destroyed several towns. In 1716 the Dutch attacked the\r\nfortress of Iloilo, but were compelled to retire after a heavy loss\r\nboth in killed and wounded. There has been a great increase in the\r\npopulation, which in 1736 numbered 67,708 souls; in 1799, 176,901;\r\nin 1845, 277,571; and by the last census, 527,970, of whom 174,874\r\npay tribute. There is a small number of Spaniards--of mestizos many,\r\nof whom the larger proportion are sangleys, the descendants of Chinese\r\nfathers and native mothers. The increase of the population must be\r\ngreat, the census in 1857 giving 17,675 births, and only 9,231 deaths.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Iloilo is by a channel between a sandbank (which has\r\nspread nearly a mile beyond the limits given in the charts) and the\r\nisland of Guimaras. The town appears adjacent as it is approached,\r\nbut the river by which vessels enter makes a considerable bend and\r\npasses round close to the town. We observed a large fortification, but\r\nit had not the means of saluting us, and we were therefore exonerated\r\nfrom the duty of exploding H. M.'s gunpowder; but if not in the shape\r\nof noisy salutations, the courtesies of the Spanish authorities were\r\ndisplayed in every possible way towards the officers and crew of our\r\nfrigate, for whose service and entertainment everything was done. We\r\nwere soon waited on by a gentleman from the British vice-consulate. The\r\nvice-consul returned to Iloilo the day after our arrival. It would\r\nindeed be well if all British functionaries possessed as much aptitude,\r\nknowledge and disposition to be useful as we found in Mr. Loney,\r\nto whom the commerce of the Philippines generally, and the port of\r\nIloilo especially, is under great obligations. To him, more than to any\r\nother individual, the development of the trade of Panay will be due.\r\n\r\nFrom the Governor of Iloilo, Colonel José Maria Carlès,\r\nespecially I experienced great kindness. He was Buffering under a\r\nsore affliction--for affliction holds sway over every part of the\r\nworld--the loss of an only and beloved son who had preceded him\r\nas governor of the province and was an object of so much affection\r\nthat the people earnestly implored the Captain-General to allow the\r\nfather to succeed him, which was granted. It was touching to hear the\r\ntales of the various displays of popular sympathy and sorrow which\r\naccompanied the death and the interment of Don Emilio Carlès, whom no\r\nless than fifty carriages followed to his grave in Arévalo. I passed\r\nthe village more than once with the mourning father; at a time, too,\r\nwhen sorely suffering from sorrows of my own, I felt the consolation\r\nwhich is found in remembering and helping others to remember the\r\nvirtues of the dead. These are their best monuments, though not\r\nwritten on tablets of stone.\r\n\r\nThe principalia of Molo came to invite us to a ball, and very prettily\r\nthe ball was got up. It is a most industrious locality; in ancient\r\ntimes was a Chinese colony, and is now occupied by mestizos and their\r\ndescendants, most of them having a mingling of Chinese blood. The\r\npueblo has 16,428 inhabitants, of whom the mestizos are 1,106. It\r\nis one of the busiest towns in the island, and everything has a\r\nprosperous and active look. Some of the buildings have in the same\r\napartment many looms occupied in making the piña stuffs. The place was\r\ngaily illuminated on occasion of the ball, and the gobernadorcillo\r\nmade an oration in Spanish to the effect that the locality had been\r\nmuch honoured by our presence, and that the memory of the day would\r\nbe long preserved. Many of the mestizos keep their carriages, which\r\nwere placed at the disposal of our friends, and which fell into the\r\nprocession when music and firing of guns and muskets accompanied us\r\nthrough the town. Molo is an island formed by two creeks, and entered\r\nby bridges on both sides. I believe it is one of the few localities\r\nserved by a secular curate. It is about four miles from Iloilo, the\r\nroad being good, and many Indian houses are seen on both sides of the\r\nway. Almost all these have their gardens growing plantains, cocoa-nuts,\r\nbread-fruits, cocoa, betel and other vegetable productions. Sugar\r\nplanting appeared to be extending, and there are many paddy-fields\r\nand much cultivation of maize.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and British vice-consul accompanied us in our pleasant\r\nexcursions to the interior, during which we visited some of the\r\nmost populous pueblos of the provinces. We travelled in comfortable\r\ncarriages, the friars or the gobernadorcillos providing us with relays\r\nof horses, and the convents were generally the places appointed\r\nfor our reception, in which we invariably found most hospitable\r\ncheer. One day it was determined to visit Janiuay, and we first\r\nstopped at Jaro, a pueblo of more than 22,000 souls. The roads had\r\ntheir usual adornings: the Indian cottages exhibited their flags,\r\nthe equestrian principalia came out to escort us, and the native\r\nbands of music went before us when we entered and when we quitted\r\nthe populous part of the town. Jaro is deemed the most opulent place\r\nin the island of Panay. It was founded in 1584 or 1585. Cultivation\r\nextends to some distance around it. It boasts of its stone bridge,\r\nmore than 700 feet in length and 36 feet in breadth, the erection\r\nof which, as well as the excellent roads by which the pueblo is\r\napproached, are due to the munificence of a curate knighted by his\r\nsovereign for his patriotic sacrifices. Though the country is level,\r\nthe rich vegetation on the banks of the streams and by the borders\r\nof the highway make the scenery picturesque. The manufacture of fine\r\nstuffs and cotton, piña and silk, is very considerable. These fabrics\r\nare exposed for sale at a weekly market, held on Thursdays, which is\r\ncrowded by people from every part of the province, being the largest\r\nof the Iloilo marts. From Jaro we proceeded to Santa Barbara, a pueblo\r\nof 23,000 souls. Here we were received at the convent of the Augustine\r\nfriars, in whose hands are all the cures of Iloilo, to one of whom we\r\nhad the pleasure of giving a passage to Manila, whither he was bound\r\nas the delegate to the annual assembly of the fraternity. Here, too,\r\nother Augustine friars visited us, all inviting us to partake of the\r\nhospitalities of their spacious convents. Santa Barbara is a modern\r\ntown, built in 1759, and placed under the special protection of the\r\nsaint whose name it bears. It has shared in the general prosperity\r\nof the province: in 1820 it had no manufactures; but it has now a\r\nweekly market for the sale of the produce of its looms, consisting\r\nprincipally of cottons, sail-canvas, quilts, coverlets, &c. The\r\nforests furnish fine timber for building and for cabinet work, and\r\nare crowded with wild bees, whose wax and honey form a considerable\r\narticle of traffic. Excellent were the carriages and horses of the\r\nfriars. Our next resting-place was Cabatuan, somewhat larger than Santa\r\nBarbara. Cabatuan was founded in 1732. It is on the banks of the river\r\nTiguin; sometimes nearly dry, and at others deluging the country with\r\nits impetuous torrents. The numerous crocodiles make fishing unsafe;\r\nand the navigation even of small boats is often interrupted, either\r\nby the superfluity or insufficiency of its waters. There is a large\r\nproduction of rice and of cocoa-nut oil for lighting. From Cabatuan\r\nwe went to Janiuay, which was the limit of the day's journey, and of\r\nour visit to the interior. It is called Matagul in the ancient maps of\r\nthe province, and has about the same number of inhabitants as Santa\r\nBarbara. The convent and church are on a slightly elevated ground,\r\nand offer a pretty view of the pueblo and surrounding country. Many\r\nof the women are engaged in the labours of the loom, but agriculture\r\nis the principal industry of the neighbourhood. We had hoped to\r\nvisit the Dingle mountain, one of whose caves or grottos is said\r\nto present the character of a temple of fantastic architecture,\r\nadorned with rock crystal and exhibiting masses of marble and\r\nalabaster which form its walls; another cave is formed of granite,\r\nwhich abounds in the locality: but we had to return to Iloilo to\r\nmeet the principal people at a late dinner, succeeded as usual by\r\na ball. The Governor's house being at some distance from the town,\r\nwe were kindly accommodated at that of one of the native merchants,\r\nconveniently situated on the quay of the river. Several of the friars,\r\nwho had been our hosts, were the guests of the merchants; and the kind\r\nhospitality we experienced did not justify the constant expression\r\nof courteous regrets for the inadequacy of the entertainment,\r\nthe blunders of the native servants (sometimes amusing enough),\r\nand the contrasts between the accommodations of Europe and those\r\nwhich a remote Spanish settlement in the Philippines could afford;\r\nbut there was so much of courtesy, good breeding and cordiality that\r\nit was impossible to feel otherwise than grateful and contented, and,\r\nafter all, in this world to do all we can is to discharge every duty.\r\n\r\nThe next day we made our arrangements for visiting the different\r\npueblos on the coast, and, starting in our carriages soon after\r\ndaybreak, we passed through Molo and Arévalo to Oton. Arévalo has\r\nsome celebrity in the annals of the Philippines, and had a special\r\ninterest for the Governor, as here had been lately displayed\r\nthe affection of the Indians for his son, whose funeral they had\r\nhonoured with such special marks of sympathy and regret. Arévalo was\r\nformerly the residence of the governor--built by Ronquillo in 1581,\r\nwho gave it the name of his birth-place. Molested by the Indians,\r\nattacked by pirates and the government quite disorganized, it was\r\nfor a long time abandoned; and the seat of authority being removed\r\nto Iloilo, Arévalo presents few signs of activity: there are about\r\n8,000 inhabitants in this district. At Oton we saw from the Augustine\r\nconvent an interesting ceremony. It was on a Sunday; and on quitting\r\nthe church the inhabitants were summoned by beat of drum to attend\r\nthe reading of a proclamation of the government. They were all in\r\ntheir holiday garments, and men, women and children formed a circle\r\nround one of the native Indian authorities, who, in a loud voice,\r\nread in the Bisayan tongue the document which he had been ordered\r\nto communicate to the people. There was perfect silence during\r\nthe reading, and a quiet dispersion of the crowd. Fortifications\r\nare erected along the coast, and a great variety of manufactures\r\nwere brought to us for examination. A good deal of English cotton\r\ntwist is sold, which forms the warp of most of the fabrics. [34]\r\nThere were rugs of silk and cotton; varieties of coloured ginghams;\r\ntissues, in which the fibres of the abacá and the piña were mixed\r\nwith our cotton thread, whose importation is, however, confined to\r\nthe colours which the Indians are themselves not able to dye. Oton\r\nhas nearly 23,000 inhabitants. I observe the proportion of births\r\nto deaths is as nearly four to one, and that while there are five\r\nbirths to one marriage, the deaths exceed the marriages by less than\r\none-third, so that the increase of population must be very great. In\r\n1818, it was less than 9,000. Tigbauan, with its 21,000 inhabitants,\r\nwas our next halting place. Its general character resembles that of\r\nOton. Rice is the principal agricultural production, but the women\r\nare mostly employed in weaving stuffs, which find markets in Albay and\r\nCamarines. We were accompanied from the Augustine convent by a friar\r\nof Guimbal, who obviously exercised much influence over his brethren\r\nand over the whole community. His conversation was both entertaining\r\nand instructive. He had a good stud of horses, a handsome carriage, and\r\nhe certainly employs his large revenues with generous hospitality. Not\r\nto repeat what has been repeated so often, the Indians, on the whole\r\nline of our journey, made a holiday time for our reception, which\r\npartook everywhere of the character of a public festivity. After the\r\nprincipalia had accompanied us to the convents, and received their\r\nthanks from me, and their dismissal from the Governor and the friar,\r\na number of little girls were introduced, to whom the service of\r\nthe table and attendance on the guests were confided. There was a\r\nstrange mixture of curiosity, fear and respect in their deportment;\r\nbut they gathered round my arm-chair; their bright black eyes looked\r\ninquiringly into my face, and asked for orders; while one, who seemed\r\nrather a pet of the ghostly father, put her hand into the curls of my\r\nwhite hair, which she seemed to consider worthy of some admiration:\r\nbut the friar told me they were discoursing among themselves whether\r\nit was possible I could be a general and a great man, who had no gold\r\nabout my clothes; I was not dressed half as finely as the officers\r\nthey had been accustomed to see. They were very proud of some of\r\nthe piña garments they wore, and one after another came to display\r\ntheir finery. They took care to supply me with cigars, and that light\r\nshould be ready whenever the cigar was extinguished, and when we sat\r\ndown to our well-furnished repast, several of them were at hand to\r\nremove the plates, to provide others, and to see that we were well\r\nprovided with the delicacies of the day. On our way back to Iloilo,\r\nwe learnt that the principalia of Molo were to escort us in their\r\ncarriages to our domicile; they were waiting for us in the main road,\r\nso that we made together quite a procession. They had before invited\r\nCaptain Vansittart and the officers of the Magicienne to their ball,\r\nand many attended, keeping up the dance to an early morning hour.\r\n\r\nWe left Iloilo the following day. The Governor and several of the\r\nprincipal people, among whom was a large group of Augustine friars,\r\naccompanied us with music to the ship. Three loud shouts of grateful\r\nhurrah broke forth from our decks, cordially responded to by our\r\nhosts--and so farewell! and all happiness to Iloilo.\r\n\r\nI have sent to Sir William Hooker, for the museum of the Royal Gardens\r\nat Kew, sixty specimens of woods grown in the northern and western\r\ndistricts of the island of Panay and the province of Antique, of\r\nwhich the most notable are--the molave, the most useful and compact\r\nof the Philippine woods, and applied to all purposes of building;\r\nbancaluag, for fine work; duñgon, for ship-building and edifices;\r\nbago-arour, building and cabinet-work; lumati, a species of teak;\r\nguisoc, a flexible wood for ships and houses; ipil has similar\r\nmerits; naga, resembling mahogany, used for furniture; cansalod,\r\nplanks for floors; maguilomboy, for the same purpose; duca, baslayan,\r\noyacya, for ship-building; tipolo, for musical instruments; lanipga,\r\na species of cedar used for carving and sculpture; bayog, spars for\r\nmasts and yards; bancal, for internal roofs and carving; malaguibuyo,\r\nfor flooring; ogjayan, flexible for joints, &c.; lanitan, guitars,\r\nviolins, &c.; janlaatan, furniture; lauaan, spars for shipping; basa,\r\nin large blocks for building and shipping; talagtag, cabinet-work;\r\nnino, the bark used for dyeing both red and yellow; bacan, spars;\r\npanao, a medicinal wood used for sore eyes by the Indians; banate,\r\na fine and solid box-wood, used for billiard-maces, has been exported\r\nto Europe; bancolinao, ebony; casla has a fruit resembling a French\r\nbean, whose oil is used by the natives for their lamps; jaras, for\r\nconstruction of houses. It will be observed that all these bear their\r\nIndian names, which are generally applied to them by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAs regards the commercial position and prospects of the whole of the\r\ncentral and southern islands of the Philippine Archipelago, the most\r\nsatisfactory details which have reached me are those furnished in\r\n1857 by the Vice-Consul of Iloilo, Mr. Loney, to the Consul of Manila,\r\nfrom which I extract the following information.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Philippines called the Bisayas may be\r\ngenerally described as including the whole of the islands to the\r\nsouthward of Luzon, though, strictly speaking, it is understood to\r\ncomprehend only those of Samar, Leyte, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol\r\n(with their dependencies, Tablas, Romblon, Sibuyan, &c.), and four\r\nprovinces--Misamis, Caraga, Zamboanga, and Nueva Guipuzcoa--of the\r\nimportant island of Mindanao, next to Luzon the finest and largest\r\nof the archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the revenue of the Bisayas was formerly in charge\r\nof a separate Government Intendency (Gobierno Intendencia de Bisayas)\r\nestablished in the city of Cebu; but this being abolished in 1849,\r\nall the provinces, as regards revenue, are now equally under control\r\nof the Superintendencia at Manila. While, however, the provinces\r\nand districts of Luzon (with the exception of Cavite, La Isabela,\r\nNueva Viscaya, El Abra, San Mateo, and La Union) are presided over\r\nby civil functionaries (alcaldes mayores), those of the Bisayas are\r\ngoverned by military officers (gobernadores militares y politicos)\r\nof the rank of captain to that of colonel, assisted in most instances\r\nby a lieutenant-governor, a civilian, and usually a lawyer, who takes\r\ncognizance of all ordinary civil and criminal cases.\r\n\r\nThe Bisayan group is mostly inhabited by a race resembling, in all\r\nessential characteristics, the Tagálog, and other Malayan races of\r\nLuzon. Their language may be called a dialect of the Tagálog, though\r\nrather harsher in sound, and neither so copious, so refined, nor so\r\nsubjected to grammatical rules, as this latter idiom. The Bisayan\r\nhas more Malay words than have the dialects spoken in Luzon. The\r\nnatives of these islands and those of Luzon imperfectly comprehend\r\neach other, though their languages are evidently derived from the\r\nsame parent stock.\r\n\r\nThe Bisayas furnish a hardy, seafaring race; but, as a rule, the\r\ngeneral tendency to indolence, attributed to the Philippine \"Indian,\"\r\napplies, in a perhaps greater degree, to the inhabitants of the whole\r\nsouthern group, and constitutes at present, in the absence of any\r\navailable means of coercion, one of the principal obstacles to a more\r\nrapid extension of agriculture by the introduction of European capital.\r\n\r\nThe christianized population of the Bisayas may be estimated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Samar                                 118,000\r\n      Leyte                                 115,000\r\n      Romblon                                16,600\r\n      Panay:--\r\n         Capiz                              135,000\r\n         Iloilo                             450,000\r\n         Antique                             80,000\r\n      Cebu and Bohol                        385,200\r\n      Negros                                108,000\r\n      Calamianes                             18,000\r\n      Mindanao:--\r\n         Misamis                             44,500\r\n         Caraga (Surigao)                    15,300\r\n         New Guipuzcoa (Bislig and Davao)    11,200\r\n         Zamboanga                           12,000\r\n                                          ---------\r\n                                    Total 1,508,800\r\n\r\n\r\nThis estimate does not include the unsubdued tribes inhabiting the\r\nmountains in the interior, some idea of the number of which may be\r\nformed from a note of those ascertained to have existed in 1849,\r\nin the undernoted provinces:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       Misamis                     66,000\r\n       Samar                       25,964\r\n       Leyte (not ascertained).\r\n       Negros                       8,545\r\n       Panay                       13,900\r\n       Cebu                         4,903\r\n                                  -------\r\n                            Total 119,312\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest number of unsubjected tribes (principally Mahomedan)\r\ninhabit Mindanao, the total population of which is generally asserted\r\nto amount to nearly one million souls.\r\n\r\nThe island of Panay, advantageously placed towards the centre of\r\nthe Bisayas group, is distant at its nearest point--that of Potol,\r\nin lat. 11° 48´ N., long. 122° W. of Greenwich--180 miles in a\r\nright line from Manila. Its shape is nearly triangular, and it has\r\na circumference of about 300 miles. It is the fifth in size of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, coming in this respect after Luzon, which has\r\na circumference of 1,059 miles; Mindanao, 900; Paragua, 420; and\r\nSamar, 390; but, though smaller than the islands just named, it is,\r\nnext to Luzon, the most populous of the archipelago, if Mindanao,\r\nwith the doubtful population of independent tribes above-mentioned,\r\nbe left out of the question.\r\n\r\nPanay is divided into the three provinces of Capiz, Antique, and\r\nIloilo, which together contain a population of about 665,000.\r\n\r\nCapiz occupies the whole of the northern portion of the coast of Panay,\r\nfor a distance of seventy-seven miles.\r\n\r\nIts limits towards the interior may be defined by a curved line,\r\ncommencing from a little to the eastward of Point Bulacan, passing\r\nby the Pico de Arcangel, in the Siaurágan Mountains, and continued\r\nwestward to Pandan, on the coast. Its chief town is Capiz, situated\r\non the river of the same name. Though broken towards the southern\r\nand western portion by an irregular series of mountain chains, the\r\ngreater part of the territory of Capiz consists of extensive low-lying\r\nplains, which produce rice in great abundance. It possesses a few good\r\nharbours, particularly that of Batan; and Capiz itself, situated at the\r\nconfluence of the rivers Panay and Capiz, affords secure anchorage. Its\r\ntribute-paying population is officially reported to be 135,000 souls.\r\n\r\nAntique takes up the western side of the island, to an extent of 84\r\nmiles--from Point Naso on the south to Pandan on the north--is of\r\ntriangular shape, and limited on the north by the province of Capiz,\r\non the south and east by that of Iloilo, and on the west by the\r\nsea. Antique is very mountainous, and, being comparatively thinly\r\ninhabited, does not at present produce much for export, especially\r\nas the greater development of its resources is retarded by the want\r\nof good harbours, of which it does not possess one along its whole\r\nline of coast. At its chief town and port, San José de Buenavista,\r\na breakwater is in process of construction, which, if completed,\r\nwill give a great impulse to the trade of the province, by enabling\r\nvessels to load there at all seasons of the year. At San José foreign\r\nwhaling and other vessels not unfrequently call for water and fresh\r\nprovisions. The number of its inhabitants, exclusive of the remontados\r\nand monteses, who occupy the mountainous districts, is computed to\r\namount to 80,000 souls.\r\n\r\nIloilo extends over the south-eastern portion of the island, is also\r\nof triangular form, bounded on the north by Capiz, on the west by\r\nAntique, and on the south-east by the arm of the sea which separates\r\nit from the island of Negros. This, the largest, richest and most\r\npeopled of the three provinces, deserves more particular notice.\r\n\r\nIloilo, its chief town, and the residence of its governor, distant 254\r\nmiles in a direct line from Manila, and placed by Spanish hydrographers\r\nin lat. 10° 48' W. of the meridian of San Bernardino, is situated\r\nnear the south-eastern extremity of the island, close to the sea,\r\non the border of the narrow channel formed by the island of Guimarás,\r\nwhich lies opposite to it at a distance of two miles and a half from\r\nthe Panay shore.\r\n\r\nThe town is built principally on low, marshy ground, subject to tidal\r\ninfluence, partly fronting the sea, and partly along the left bank\r\nof a creek, or inlet, which runs towards Jaro, and after describing\r\na semicircle again meets the sea near Molo. Although the principal\r\nseaport and seat of the government of the province, its population\r\nis not so large as that of many of the towns in its vicinity. It\r\ndoes not at present exceed 7,500, while Jaro, Molo and Oton, towns\r\nin its immediate neighbourhood, possess 33,000, 15,000 and 20,000\r\nrespectively. This comparative scarcity of inhabitants is principally\r\nowing to the want of space for further extension on the narrow tongue\r\nof land on which the town is chiefly built. This obstacle to its\r\nfurther increase should in time cease to exist, as efficient measures\r\nare being taken to draw the population more inland; among others,\r\nthe erection of a new government house and public offices at a more\r\ncentral point; the contemplated removal of the present church to a\r\nmore advantageous and open site, beyond the tongue of land alluded\r\nto; and the convergence at this place of new and more direct roads\r\n(now in course of construction) leading to and from the adjacent\r\npopulous towns.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the drawback of limited space, the progress in size\r\nand importance of the town has of late years been very marked, while\r\nthe European residents, who, in 1840, numbered only three, now, in\r\n1857, amount to 31 in Iloilo, and 30 in the remaining towns of the\r\nprovince. A considerable portion of this number arrived during the\r\npast two years, and the effect of this increase of Europeans, though\r\ntheir number is so small, is already visible in the construction of\r\nnew buildings, and projects for the erection of many others. The rise\r\nin house property may be illustrated by the fact that the house in\r\nwhich the vice-consulate is established--constructed of wood with a\r\npalm-thatched roof--is subject to a rental of 33 dollars per month,\r\nor about 80l. per annum. The value of land for building lots has also\r\naugmented in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe population of the province is given officially as 511,066; but\r\nthere is reason to think it considerably exaggerated, and that 400,000,\r\nor at most 450,000, would be nearer the real amount.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Iloilo, though well protected and naturally good,\r\nis not without inconveniences, capable, however, of being obviated\r\nwith little trouble, and, provided with one of the excellent charts\r\nlately issued by the Comisión Hidrográfica (and, if approaching from\r\nthe north, with a pilot), large vessels may enter with safety.\r\n\r\nThe island of Guimarás, which is twenty-two miles long by three\r\nin breadth, forms in front of Iloilo a sheltered passage, running\r\nnearly north and south, of a width varying from two miles and a half\r\nto six miles, with deep water and good anchorage. The entrance to\r\nthis passage from the south is a good deal narrowed by the Oton shoal\r\n(Bajo de Oton), which stretches for a considerable distance from the\r\nPanay shore, and contracts for about a mile in length the available\r\nchannel at this part to the breadth of about two miles. This, however,\r\nwill be no obstacle for large ships during the south-west monsoon\r\n(especially when the channel is properly buoyed off), the passage being\r\nperfectly clear as far as it extends; and with a contrary north-east\r\nmonsoon they can work or drag through with the tide, keeping well over\r\ntowards Guimaras, the coast of which is clear with deep water close in,\r\nanchoring, if necessary, on the edge of the shoal, which affords good\r\nholding-ground, and, being of soft sand, may be safely approached. The\r\nwhole of this coast, protected as it is by Guimaras, the Panay shore,\r\nand, in a considerable degree, by the island of Negros, offers secure\r\nanchorage in the north-east monsoon; and situated on the south-west\r\nportion of Guimaras, the fine port of Buluanga, or Sta. Ana, of\r\neasy access and capable of admitting vessels of the largest tonnage,\r\nwill afford shelter under almost any circumstances. The approach to\r\nthe opposite or northern entrance is generally made by the coasting\r\nvessels through the chain of small islands (Gigantes, Pan de Azucar,\r\nSicógon, Apiton, &c.), called collectively the Silanga, which lie off\r\nthe north-east coast of Panay and afford an excellent refuge for a\r\nconsiderable distance to the vessels engaged in the trade with Manila\r\nand the southernmost Bisayas. But though there is good anchorage among\r\nthese islands, particularly at Pan de Azucar and Tagú, it would be\r\nmore prudent for vessels of large burden, in cases where there is no\r\npractical acquaintance with the set of the tides and currents, to take\r\nthe outside channel between the Silanga and the island of Negros. After\r\npassing the Calabazas rocks and Pepitas shoal and making the castle\r\nor blockhouse of Banate (formerly erected, like many others along the\r\nPhilippine coasts, for defence against the pirates of the Sooloo Sea),\r\nthe route is due south until sighting a group of seven remarkable\r\nrocks, called the \"Seven Sins,\" for which a direct course should then\r\nbe made, the lead being kept going to avoid the Iguana Bank (which\r\nis well marked off on the charts referred to), and on getting south\r\nof the Iloilo Fort vessels of a certain tonnage may enter the creek,\r\nor, if too large, should bring up on the east side of the fort, where\r\nthey are protected from the wind and the strength of the tides. The\r\ndepth of water on the bar at the entrance to the creek is about five\r\nfathoms at low water; but at a short distance farther inside the water\r\nshoals to fifteen feet at low water, and then deepens again. The rise\r\nand fall being six feet, a vessel of 300 tons, drawing, when loaded,\r\nsixteen to eighteen feet, can easily obtain egress with a full cargo. A\r\ndredging machine employed to clear away the mud which has been allowed\r\nto accumulate at the shallower parts near the entrance, would enable\r\nships of almost any burden to complete their cargoes inside. The\r\nSanta Justa, a Spanish ship of 700 tons, loaded, in 1851, part of a\r\ncargo of tobacco inside the creek, and finished her lading outside.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that, the banks of the creek being of soft mud,\r\nthere is little or no risk to be apprehended from grounding. Proceeding\r\nabout a mile and a half up the creek (which varies in breadth from half\r\na mile to three-quarters of a mile, and affords complete protection\r\nfrom wind and sea), the coasting crafts bring up at the jetties of\r\ntheir respective owners, and have the great advantage of discharging\r\nand loading at the stores without the necessity of employing boats.\r\n\r\nBeyond this point, the creek stretches as far as Molo. Formerly the\r\ncoasting vessels used, when necessary, to go on to Molo, but the\r\ndrawbridge through which they had to pass having got out of repair,\r\nand the present bridge (now in very bad condition) affording no means\r\nof passage, they remain at Iloilo, to which place the Molo traders\r\nhave had to transfer their warehouses.\r\n\r\nThe export trade of Iloilo, hitherto confined to the port of Manila and\r\nthe adjacent islands, is at present chiefly carried on by four Spanish\r\nfirms resident at Iloilo and owners of the better class of native craft\r\nsailing from this port; but to these are to be added a considerable\r\nnumber of mestizos, or half-castes, principally of Chinese descent,\r\nliving at the neighbouring towns of Molo and Jaro, several of whom\r\nare also owners of vessels, and employ considerable sums in the trade.\r\n\r\nThe principal products exported are leaf tobacco, sugar, sapan-wood,\r\nrice in the husk (or paddy); hemp and hides, besides other articles in\r\nlesser quantity, including horns, beche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl shell,\r\nbeeswax, canes, &c., and a considerable amount of native manufactured\r\ngoods. Leaf, or unmanufactured tobacco, is at present the article\r\nof most importance, and the one which the Spanish traders have found\r\nmost lucrative. It is purchased by them from the small native growers,\r\nand shipped to Manila for exclusive sale to the government, at prices\r\nfixed by the factory appraisers, according to the size and quality of\r\nthe leaf. From Iloilo some 30,000 quintals were shipped last year for\r\nManila, and from Capiz 20,000, giving about 50,000 as the exportable\r\nquantity of the leaf produced in Panay per annum.\r\n\r\nThe export of tobacco to Manila, until the year 1845, did not amount\r\nin this province to more than 10,000 quintals per annum; but in that\r\nyear the agent of a Manila firm having raised the usual low prices\r\ngiven by the Iloilo traders from 10 rials to an average of 20 to 21\r\nrials for the three first qualities, the export, in 1847, had rapidly\r\nreached 24,000 quintals.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the government being directed to its growing\r\nimportance, it was resolved to institute a system of \"Coleccion,\"\r\nthrough the governor and a staff of collectors, similar to those\r\n\"Collecciones\" that are established at Cagayan, La Union, and Nueva\r\nEcija. By this system, the purchase for, and export to, Manila by\r\nprivate traders, though not positively interdicted (as is the case in\r\nthe provinces just named), was so much prejudiced and interfered with\r\nby the unequal competition with the government (to which the private\r\nbuyers had ultimately to sell what they shipped), that the total export\r\nfrom Iloilo fell during the six years from 1848 to 1853 from 25,000 to\r\n18,900 quintals. In this latter year the coleccion was withdrawn. In\r\n1853 a company formed at Madrid was allowed the exclusive privilege\r\nof the manufacture and export of cigars and leaf tobacco to foreign\r\nmarkets. A large and expensive stone-built factory was erected near\r\nIloilo, the manufacture of cigars organized, and purchases of the\r\nleaf effected, and, latterly, the company's operations were extended\r\nto the cultivation of the plant in different parts of the province. A\r\nclause, however, in its charter rendered it incumbent on the company\r\nto furnish the factories at Manila, if required, with a considerable\r\nyearly amount both of leaf tobacco and cigars, equal, if necessary,\r\nto the amount annually derived in the province from other sources. As a\r\nconsequence, the requirements made for the Manila factories (purposely\r\naugmented, it is said, by the hostility of the then Intendente de\r\nHacienda to the company) were to such an extent as virtually to\r\ndeprive it of all power to act on its own account; and, after an\r\nexistence of nearly three years, its embarrassments were such as to\r\ncompel its extinction, with the loss of a considerable portion of the\r\ncapital originally sunk. Had the authorities at Manila favoured its\r\ndevelopment, the result, though necessarily cramped by the defective\r\nprinciple inherent in all monopolies, might have been favourable, as,\r\nwith the liberty to manufacture for, and ship to, foreign markets, it\r\ncould have afforded to give good prices, and might have extended the\r\nculture of the tobacco plant. It is a suggestive fact in connection\r\nwith this subject that one of the Europeans formerly in the employ of\r\nthe company has since had cigars manufactured for local consumption,\r\nwhich he has sold at 8 dollars per thousand, nearly, if not quite,\r\nequal in quality to the \"Imperiales\" occasionally manufactured at\r\nthe factory at Manila at 25 dollars per thousand.\r\n\r\nSince 1853, and coexistent with the company's operations, the purchase\r\nand shipment of tobacco by private individuals have been resumed on\r\ntheir original footing; and, while the amount so shipped has steadily,\r\nthough very gradually, increased, prices have maintained a slight\r\nupward tendency. The maximum rates, however, which the local traders\r\ncan afford to pay the native growers are not high enough to bring\r\nabout a rapid extension of planting, or induce these latter to give\r\ntime and labour enough to improve the quality of a plant, the proper\r\nculture of which requires special attention, and the application of\r\nmore capital and intelligence than they have it in their power to\r\nbestow. The Iloilo shippers complain of the arbitrary manner in which\r\nthe classification of qualities is made at Manila, and of the fact\r\nthat, even after delivery of the tobacco at the government stores, it\r\nis held entirely at their risk until examined, repacked and ready for\r\nshipment to Spain. The qualities shipped at Iloilo are classed as 1st\r\n(of which a very small quantity is produced under the present system),\r\n2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th; and any rejected by the examiners at Manila\r\nas under the 5th quality is retained and burnt, though no allowance\r\non such portion is made to the vendor. The rates given by the factory\r\nfor the above qualities are 7·75, 6·75, 5·25, 4, and 3 dollars per\r\nquintal respectively. The seedlings are planted out in January, and\r\nthe greater part of the crop comes forward in May and June. The soil\r\nof the greater part of the Bisayas is favourable to the growth of\r\ntobacco. The island of Negros formerly produced about 8,000 quintals,\r\nof very good quality, which the Iloilo traders, through their agents,\r\nwere in the habit of purchasing from the independent tribes inhabiting\r\nthe interior; but the measures taken by the present governor to bring\r\nthe latter into subjection having resulted last year in the slaughter\r\nof several hundreds and the dispersion of the rest, supplies from this\r\nsource are at present stopped. Cebú produces about 15,000 quintals,\r\nof rather inferior quality. At Leyte, particularly in the district of\r\nMoasin, tobacco of very excellent quality and colour is grown, but it\r\ndoes not pay to produce in large quantity for export to Manila, and\r\nis consequently used almost exclusively in the Bisayas, where it is\r\nmuch appreciated. Samar also grows tobacco for local consumption. The\r\nmanufacture of cigars is allowed throughout the Bisayas, but not for\r\nsale at Manila or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor the present the export of tobacco from Panay and the other islands\r\npossesses little direct interest for British or foreign merchants,\r\nthe transactions with government, as at present conducted, not being\r\nof a satisfactory nature. It is, however, almost superfluous to say,\r\nthat if the existing government monopoly of tobacco were abolished\r\n(substituted by a system of farming out lands, a direct territorial tax\r\non the quantity under cultivation, or a duty on exports), and both the\r\nfree manufacture for, and direct shipment to, a foreign market allowed,\r\nthe export from Panay would immediately become of great importance\r\nto the foreign trade. The soil of a very great portion of the island\r\nbeing well adapted for the cultivation of the plant, the export, under\r\nthe stimulus of much higher prices and the consequent employment of\r\nmore and better-directed capital, would be capable of great expansion,\r\nparticularly if, as would in all probability be the case, the culture\r\nwere undertaken by Europeans, and the present system of small patches\r\ncultivated by natives gave place to estates on a large scale, as in\r\nCuba. The benefits which would accrue to the native population by\r\nthe opening up of larger sources of industry need not be pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the suppression of the existing monopoly is a most\r\nimportant one for the Philippines; and it is to be hoped that the\r\ngovernment at Madrid, encouraged by the beneficial results of the\r\nabrogation, in 1819, of the monopoly in Cuba, will at no distant date\r\nresolve to overcome the difficulties which at present surround the\r\nquestion, particularly as its solution becomes yearly more urgent,\r\nand more called for on the part of both Europeans and natives.\r\n\r\nSugar, as an article of export, may be said to be as yet comparatively\r\nin the germ. By an abstract taken from notes of province cargoes given\r\ndaily by the Boletin Oficial of Manila, it is seen that nearly 12,000\r\npeculs went forward last year from this province to Manila, of which\r\nit may be estimated that about 3,000 were brought over from the Isla\r\nde Negros, and sent on to the capital as Iloilo sugar. So great has\r\nbeen the stimulus given by the high prices for this article which\r\nhave lately ruled, that the quantity exported from Iloilo alone will\r\nnot fall short of 20,000, or say, with contributions from Negros,\r\nabout 25,000 peculs, or nearly 1,600 tons; and, were the present\r\nrapid extension of planting to continue in the same ratio for three\r\nyears, the amount exportable would in that time, as there is no want\r\nof available land, reach about 80,000 peculs, or 5,000 tons, subject\r\nto further augmentation from other sources, should foreign vessels\r\ncommence loading at this port. [35] At the island of Negros, from\r\nwhence the voyage occupies from six to ten hours, the soil of which\r\nis eminently fertile, and which possesses immense tracts particularly\r\nadapted for the growth of sugar, a similar extension of culture is in\r\nprogress, in spite of the great drawback of the comparative sparseness\r\nof its population, which alone prevents it from yielding sugar and hemp\r\nin larger proportion than any other province in the Philippines. At\r\npresent Negros produces about 14,000 peculs, or nearly 900 tons,\r\nof sugar, of which more than two-thirds go to Manila direct, and\r\nthe remainder by way of Iloilo. There is a further available source\r\nfrom whence sugar (in the event of foreign vessels loading at Iloilo)\r\nwould be derivable at the contiguous island of Cebú, which produces\r\nupwards of 90,000 peculs, or 5,695 tons, for the Manila market,\r\nand is within easy distance of two to three days' sail from Iloilo.\r\n\r\nThe effective nature of the stimulus given by the present prices will\r\nbe comprehended when it is considered that the value of Iloilo sugar,\r\nwhich in previous years up to 1855 had generally ranged from 2 to 2·10\r\ndollars per pecul in the Manila market, is now 5·68 3/4 dollars per\r\npecul at Manila, against 3·2 to 3·3 dollars, with 25 per cent. for\r\nprem. on silver, or equal to 4·06 dollars to 4·21 1/2 dollars here,\r\nand as long as the rate obtainable at Manila does not recede below\r\n3 dollars per pecul of 140 lbs., the extension of planting will be\r\ncontinued. Of late years, owing to the disproportionally low prices\r\npaid at Manila, sugar planting had in many districts been abandoned as\r\nunremunerative, but during the past and present year it has rapidly\r\nincreased, particularly since the introduction of a more economical\r\nkind of furnace, in which the refuse cane is used to some extent in\r\nplace of the large amount of wood formerly consumed.\r\n\r\nThe very defective nature of the process employed by the native\r\nand mestizo planters does not allow of the production in Iloilo of\r\na superior class of sugar, and all that leaves for Manila may be\r\ndescribed as \"ordinary unclayed;\" but the grain is usually very good,\r\nand on undergoing the ulterior processes in England and Australia, it\r\nyields a fine strong sugar, and has been much approved of for boiling\r\npurposes at the Glasgow refineries. Were a better system of crushing\r\nand boiling introduced here, sugar of an excellent quality would\r\nbe produced, and it is greatly to be desired that a few Europeans\r\nwith sufficient capital and experience would form estates in this\r\nneighbourhood. At present there is not a single iron-mill in the\r\nisland. The unclayed sugars of the Philippines in ordinary times,\r\neven under the present defective and consequently expensive mode\r\nof production are held to be the cheapest in the world. The only\r\nEuropeans now engaged in the cultivation of sugar in this quarter\r\nare a French planter, at Negros, who produces an excellent sugar\r\n(which always commands upwards of 1 dollar a pecul more than ordinary\r\nIloilo), and a planter of the same nation, in this province, who has\r\nlately commenced on a limited scale.\r\n\r\nTaking the prices quoted above as a basis (4·21 1/2 dollars here\r\nagainst 5·68 3/4 dollars at Manila), the difference in favour of\r\nthis, the place of production, is now 1·47 1/4 dollar per pecul;\r\nbut supposing the additional 47 1/4 cents to be given here by the\r\nforeign exporter in order to secure such share of the crop as would be\r\nrequired to load a direct vessel, there would still remain an important\r\nsaving of 1 dollar per pecul, or say 17 1/2 per cent. less than the\r\nprime cost at Manila. The freight to Manila at present charged by\r\nthe coasting vessels is 50 cents per pecul. The bulk of the sugar\r\ncrop is delivered from February to March.\r\n\r\nSapan-wood is exported in considerable quantity from the province of\r\nIloilo. It is chiefly produced in the vicinity of the southern coasting\r\ntowns, Guimbal, Miagao, and San Joaquin (the farthest within twenty\r\nmiles of Iloilo), from whence the greater part is brought round by\r\nsea to Iloilo for exportation to Manila, and the rest shipped direct\r\nfrom Guimbal. Last year, as reported in the imperfect notes of the\r\nBoletin Oficial, 32,723 peculs, or 2,045 tons, were shipped to Manila,\r\nand 789 peculs from Antique.\r\n\r\nThe high prices lately obtained at Manila have led to the formation\r\nof new plantations, which will still further increase the exportable\r\namount. A large quantity is sent on yearly to Singapore and Amoy,\r\nand forms the bulk of the cargoes of such vessels as load at Manila\r\nfor the former port.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Iloilo sapan-wood would be much better were the\r\nnatives to abstain from the practice of cutting down a large portion\r\nbefore the trees are sufficiently grown. When allowed to obtain its\r\nproper development, it is said to be quite equal or superior to that\r\nof Misamis or Bolinao, at present the best qualities brought to the\r\nManila market. As both sellers and brokers endeavour to deliver the\r\nwood as soon as possible after it is cut, the loss in weight on\r\nthe voyage to Manila is said to be sometimes as much as 12 to 14\r\nper cent. The present price of sapan-wood delivered at Iloilo is,\r\nwith the addition of 25 per cent. for cost of silver, 1·08 dollar\r\nper pecul against the Manila rate of 1·75 to 1·875 dollar, leaving a\r\nconsiderable margin in favour of vessels loading here for a foreign\r\nmarket. The freight to Manila is 31·25 cents per pecul.\r\n\r\nHemp (so called, though in reality the product of a variety of the\r\nplantain) produced in Iloilo is chiefly of a long, white fibre,\r\nequal to what is known in the London market as \"Lupiz,\" used in the\r\nmanufacture of the native fabrics, and at present little attention is\r\npaid to it as an article of export. But though Iloilo produces little\r\nor no surplus hemp, the small coasting craft annually bring here some\r\n350 tons from the neighbouring islands and provinces of Leyte, Samar,\r\nNegros, Camarines, and Albay, received at those places in exchange\r\nfor the paddy and native goods of this province.\r\n\r\nBoth Leyte and Samar now produce large quantities of excellent\r\nhemp for the Manila market, particularly the former island; and the\r\nvoyage hither throughout the greater part of the year is so short\r\n(at present vessels take five to six days in going and two to return)\r\nthat were the native traders to find a ready market at Iloilo, at\r\nprices relatively equivalent to those of Manila, it is more than\r\nprobable that a considerable additional quantity would be directed\r\nto Iloilo instead of to the capital.\r\n\r\nAt the island of Negros the production is increasing very rapidly,\r\na large quantity having been planted during the past year, several\r\npueblos and districts possessing tracts of upwards of 100,000 and\r\n200,000 plants, which will come into use during the next two years,\r\nand as the plant is remarkable for its great propagative power,\r\nthe obtainable quantity should increase in duplicative ratio every\r\nyear. The export of hemp from the Isla de Negros amounts at present\r\nto 13,000 to 14,000 peculs, or about 850 tons, per annum, chiefly\r\nfrom the port of Dumaguele, on the eastern side of the island.\r\n\r\nWhen it is recollected that in 1831 the whole export of hemp from\r\nthe Philippines did not amount to more than 346 tons, and that in\r\n1837 it had already reached 3,585 tons, and that during 1856 no\r\nless than 22,000 tons left Manila for the United States and Europe,\r\nsome idea may be formed of the future of this valuable article at the\r\nfertile island of Negros, even with the drawback already alluded to\r\nof a scanty population.\r\n\r\nI am the more inclined to dwell on the facts regarding Negros, as\r\nfrom its close proximity it may almost be considered, in the event\r\nof direct exports from Iloilo, as an integral part of the island of\r\nPanay. The amount of hemp shipped from Capiz last year was 6,458\r\npeculs, or 400 tons, chiefly, however, of an inferior description\r\nmade from the fibres of the pácul, a wild variety of the plantain. As\r\nthis inferior hemp, however, commands a remunerative price, I believe\r\nthe plant producing the genuine article is now being more generally\r\ncultivated at Capiz. The rate for hemp here may be quoted at 5·375\r\ndollars, or, with 25 per cent. for cost of silver, 6·715 dollars per\r\npecul, against the Manila rate of 7·75 to 8 dollars. Freight to Manila,\r\n50 cents per pecul.\r\n\r\nRice in the husk, or Paddy, is an important item in the agriculture\r\nof Panay, though at present of little actual interest in relation to\r\nthe foreign trade. The yearly production of the province of Iloilo,\r\nthough nothing definite is ascertained regarding it, may be supposed\r\nto be 850,000 cavans, of which probably 40,000 are exported to the\r\nneighbouring islands and Manila. Capiz may produce about 900,000\r\ncavans, and export about 100,000 in the same way. Antique also\r\ncontributes a considerable quantity for the consumption of the island,\r\nand exports upwards of 15,000 cavans. These amounts, however, must be\r\nlooked upon as guesses at the actual quantities consumed and shipped.\r\n\r\nThe paddy exported is chiefly conveyed in small schooners (pancos\r\nand barotos) to the neighbouring islands of Leyte and Samar, and\r\nalso to Camarines and Albay, in exchange for hemp and cocoa-nut oil\r\n(the latter obtained at Leyte), which are either brought to Iloilo for\r\nsale or taken on to Manila. When prices at Manila leave a sufficient\r\nmargin (which they generally do throughout the year), some amount of\r\npaddy goes in that direction, forming a portion of the cargo of the\r\nvessels leaving for the capital.\r\n\r\nThe paddy shipped from Iloilo is chiefly drawn from the vast plains\r\nof Dumangas, Zarraga, Pototan, Santa Barbara and Barotac-viejo. Were a\r\nlarge portion of land brought under cultivation, the increased surplus\r\nof this grain would be available for an export to China, in which\r\nforeign vessels might be employed, as they frequently are at Sual,\r\nin Pangasinan; and it may not unreasonably be surmised that, in the\r\ncourse of time, ships frequenting the port of Iloilo, and proceeding\r\nto China, will naturally take part of their cargoes in rice, and thus\r\ngive a further impetus to its cultivation. At present, owing to the\r\nlate scarcity of rice in Camarines and Leyte, the price of paddy at\r\nIloilo has risen to 10 rials per province cavan, which is equal to\r\none and a half of the measure (cavan del rey) used at Manila. The\r\nother articles shipped from Panay likely to be of importance to the\r\ndirect export trade are:--\r\n\r\nHides--Buffalo and cow, of which the last year's exports to Manila\r\nwere 128 tons from Iloilo, 60 tons from Capiz, and 24 tons from\r\nAntique. Prices here (very high at present) may be quoted at 5 dollars\r\nto 8 dollars for buffalo, and 10 dollars to 14 dollars for cow hides,\r\nper pecul.\r\n\r\nHorns--A limited quantity from the three provinces. Price, from 2\r\ndollars to 3 dollars per pecul.\r\n\r\nCowries--430 cavans were shipped last year from Capiz, 42 from Antique,\r\n33 from Iloilo. This article, formerly worth at Manila 2·50 dollars\r\nto 3 dollars per cavan, has lately risen to 15 dollars.\r\n\r\nGum Mastick--2,359 peculs, or 147 tons, were sent last year from\r\nCapiz to Manila, where its value is usually from 1·50 dollar to 3\r\ndollars per pecul.\r\n\r\nMother-of-Pearl Shell--A small quantity is obtainable at this port,\r\nand at Capiz, chiefly brought from Sooloo, viâ Zamboanga, and from\r\nthe adjacent islands of the Silanga. Quotation here usually about 18\r\ndollars to 22 dollars per pecul.\r\n\r\nRattans or Canes--Used in packing produce at Manila; 401,000 went\r\nforward from Capiz in 1856, 104,000 from Iloilo, and 97,000 from\r\nAntique.\r\n\r\nMat Bags--Made from the leaf of the sago palm, used also for packing;\r\n155,850 were shipped to Manila, from Capiz, in 1856.\r\n\r\nBeeswax--A few peculs are annually shipped from the three provinces\r\nto Manila.\r\n\r\nGutta-Percha--Some quantity of this valuable substance has been sent\r\nfrom hence to Manila, but, either owing to adulteration, or ignorance\r\nof the proper mode of preparation, it has not obtained an encouraging\r\nprice. The tree yielding it, called by the Bisayans nato, abounds\r\nin this province, and in Guimarás, and if it prove to be the real\r\nIsonandra gutta of the Straits and Borneo, should hereafter become\r\nof considerable importance. The monopoly of shipment from Manila,\r\ngranted to Señor Elio, has an injurious effect on the production of\r\nthis article.\r\n\r\nTimber--for building, and woods, of various descriptions, for\r\nfurniture, abound in Panay, and the islands of the Silanga and\r\nGuimarás are peculiarly rich in valuable trees. From thence are\r\nobtained the supplies for Iloilo and the neighbouring towns, and\r\nfor the construction of vessels, occasionally built at Guimarás,\r\nwhere one of 350 tons is now (1857) on the stocks; but as yet little\r\nimpression has been made on the immense quantity to be obtained.\r\n\r\nOf other articles, which are either not adapted for European\r\nmarkets, or as yet produced in insignificant quantities, I will\r\nmerely enumerate--cocoa, of excellent quality; arrowroot; vegetable\r\npitch, of which a considerable quantity is sent to Manila; wheat,\r\nwhich grows freely in the elevated districts of the island, and of\r\nwhich 1,125 bags were sent from Iloilo and Antique in 1856; maize,\r\nbeche-de-mer, dried vegetables (beans, &c., a large amount), sago,\r\ncotton, tortoise-shell, deer-skins, ginger and gold-dust.\r\n\r\nGums, dyes and drugs, of various descriptions, abound in Panay,\r\nand a scientific examination of the many products of this nature,\r\nof which little or no use is made, is a great desideratum. It should\r\nbe borne in mind that most of the minor articles above-mentioned\r\nare also produced by the neighbouring islands, and may be therefore\r\nobtainable in increased quantities, should the anticipation of Iloilo\r\nbecoming in a great measure the emporium of the trade of the Bisayas\r\nbe realized in future.\r\n\r\nOf the mineral wealth of the island little or nothing definite\r\nis known. Gold is found in the bed of a river near Abacá, in this\r\nprovince, and near Dumárao, in Capiz. Iron and quicksilver are said\r\nto have been discovered, the former at various places in the island;\r\nand coal is reported to exist in Antique; but these are points which\r\nhave hitherto received little attention. In a journey to the interior,\r\nmade with the governor of Iloilo, through the Silanga, along the\r\nwhole north-eastern portion of the province, and as for as the Capiz\r\nboundary, near Dumárao, Mr. Loney was shown several specimens of ore,\r\napparently containing a large percentage of iron. With reference\r\nto this expedition, Mr. Loney adds from personal experience, his\r\ntestimony in confirmation of the accounts of the fertility of the\r\nisland, and the prosperous commercial future which seems to await\r\nit. The roads in general are tolerably good until the setting in of the\r\nheavy rains from August to October; but there is at present in many\r\ncases a want of efficient bridges, which impedes the free transit of\r\nproduce towards the coast. The island does not afford a superficies\r\nlarge enough for the formation of any considerable streams, and the\r\nprincipal and only important river in this province, the Jalaur,\r\nwhich meets the sea near Dumángas, and by which a large quantity\r\nof paddy is conveyed to the coast, and forwarded to Iloilo, is only\r\ncapable in the dry season of bearing craft of very small burden.\r\n\r\nThe system of purchases of produce at Iloilo is, as usual in nearly all\r\nthe provinces, to employ brokers, or personeros, who buy the produce\r\nfrom the native and mestizo growers and dealers at the different\r\npueblos in the interior and along the coast, and receive a commission\r\nof five per cent. on the amount delivered. It is generally necessary\r\nto make advances through these brokers against the incoming crop, in\r\norder to secure any quantity, and such payments in advance are always\r\nattended with a certain amount of risk. The price of the article to\r\nbe received is commonly fixed at the time of paying over the advance,\r\nand for any overplus of produce received from the grower the current\r\nrate at the time of delivery is generally accepted. In the event of\r\na permanent direct trade being established, it is likely that the\r\npractice will in time become more assimilated to that which obtains\r\nat Manila, i. e., shippers may be able to purchase or contract on\r\nthe spot from mestizo, Chinese or Spanish holders of produce, either\r\ndirectly or at the expense of a trifling brokerage.\r\n\r\nNearly all payments being made to the natives in silver--as they will\r\nseldom agree to receive gold--it is necessary to place funds here in\r\nthe former coin.\r\n\r\nBesides the natural products above mentioned, Panay produces a\r\nlarge quantity of manufactured goods, both for export and home\r\nconsumption. Of these the greater and more valuable portions,\r\nincluded under the native term sinamay, are made of the delicate\r\nfibres of the leaf of the pine-apple (piña), either pure or mixed\r\nwith silk imported from China, and a proportion of the finer sorts\r\nof British manufactured cotton thread. The process of separating the\r\npiña fibres and sorting them in hanks previous to manufacture, and\r\nthe manufacture itself, requiring a great deal of time and care, the\r\npure piña textures are proportionally dear. Some of the finest sorts\r\nare of exquisitely delicate texture. Those mixed with silk, though\r\nnot so durable, are cheaper, and have of late years been gradually\r\nsuperseding the pure piña fabrics, although these latter are still\r\nmuch worn by the more wealthy natives and mestizos. To such an extent,\r\nindeed, is silk from China now imported into this province, that,\r\naccording to the statement of the principal Chinese trader in this\r\narticle at Manila, fully 400,000 dollars worth is annually sent to\r\nIloilo from the capital. Latterly the price of silk has risen from\r\n40 to 45 dollars per chinanta of ten catties to 80 and 90 dollars,\r\nor say from 450 to 900 dollars per pecul.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the piña and mixed piña, silk and cotton fabrics\r\nis used for shirts for the men, and short jackets or shirts for the\r\nwomen. The price varies considerably, according to the fineness or\r\ncoarseness of the texture, and the greater or less amount of mixture,\r\nsome pieces for the men's shirts costing as much as 7 dollars (the\r\nvalue of which, elaborately embroidered at Manila, is sometimes\r\nenhanced to 50 or 100 dollars), and the inferior sorts 50 cents\r\nto 2 dollars per piece of 4 1/2 varas. The figured work of these\r\nfabrics is generally of European cotton sewing thread or coloured\r\nGerman and British yarn, and the stripes of thread, yarn or coloured\r\nand white silk. Textures of a cheaper character are also extensively\r\nmade of hemp and other fibres, costing two to four rials each. There\r\nis also an extensive manufacture of coloured silk and cotton goods\r\nfor \"sarongs\" (similar to those, principally of Bugis manufacture,\r\nused throughout the Malayan Archipelago), cambayas, and silk and\r\ncotton kerchiefs for the head. The better class of silk fabrics are\r\nexcellent both for solidity of texture and finish. Those of cotton\r\nare principally made of German and British dyed twist, and of native\r\nyarn manufactured from cotton grown in several districts in this\r\nprovince, and also imported from Luzon. The finer sorts are well\r\nand closely woven, and the ordinary kinds of a cheap description\r\nadapted for more common use. Trouserings, of cotton and mixed silk\r\nand cotton, are manufactured to some extent, but the Manchester and\r\nGlasgow printed drills and plain grandrills are fast displacing them\r\nas articles of general consumption. Among the other manufactures may\r\nbe enumerated table-cloths, napkins, towels, coverlets, cotton rugs,\r\n&c. Of embroidery work, which enters so largely into the industry of\r\nthe provinces of Bulacan and Manila, there is little done in Iloilo,\r\nwith the exception of the working of sprigs of flowers on the lace\r\nand network mantillas, which are much used by the female population\r\nin attendance at church.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the goods above mentioned, a considerable amount of\r\ncoarse fabrics is made of the leaf of the sago palm, of hemp, and of\r\nother fibres. These are known in the Manila market as Saguran, Guináras\r\nand Medrinaque, and are shipped to the United States and Spain, and\r\nin lesser quantity to England. Saguran and guináras are largely used\r\nat the government factories in packing the leaf tobacco forwarded\r\nto Spain. Price, from 25 to 37 1/2 dollars per pecul of 7 1/2 to 8\r\nvaras. Medrinaque has for some years past been exported in increasing\r\nquantity to the United States and Europe, where it is chiefly used\r\nfor stiffening dresses, linings, &c. This article is principally made\r\nat Samar, Leyte and Cebú, from whence, in case of direct export, it\r\nwill be obtainable for shipment. Present prices in the Manila market\r\nfor Cebú 20 dollars, Samar 18 dollars, per fifty pieces.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the Philippines are essentially an agricultural rather\r\nthan a manufacturing region, the textile productions of Iloilo may\r\nbe said to have reached a remarkable degree of development. Nothing\r\nstrikes the attention at the weekly fairs held at the different\r\ntowns more than the abundance of native goods offered for sale; and\r\nthe number of looms at work in most of the towns and villages also\r\naffords matter for surprise. Almost every family possesses one of\r\nthese primitive-looking machines, with a single apparatus formed of\r\npieces of bamboo, and, in the majority of the houses of the mestizos\r\nand the well-to-do Indians, from six to a dozen looms are kept at\r\nwork. The total number in this province has been computed at 60,000;\r\nand though these figures may rather over-represent the actual quantity,\r\nthey cannot be much beyond it. All the weaving is done by women,\r\nwhose wages usually amount to from 1 to 1·50 dollar per month. In\r\ngeneral--a practice unfortunately too prevalent among the natives in\r\nevery branch of labour--these wages are received for many months in\r\nadvance, and the operatives frequently spend years (become, in fact,\r\nvirtually slaves for a long period) before paying off an originally\r\ntrifling debt. There are other workwomen employed at intervals to\r\n\"set up\" the pattern in the loom, who are able to earn from 1 to 1·50\r\ndollar per day in this manner. It should be added that Capiz and\r\nAntique also produce, in a lesser degree than Iloilo, a proportion\r\nof manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the increasing introduction of European piece goods\r\ninto Panay, it is gratifying to observe that the quantity of mixed\r\npiña stuffs exported rather augments than otherwise with the gradual\r\naddition to the general population and the increased means derived\r\nby it from the rapidly progressive development of the resources of\r\nthe islands. Judging from the values of the quantities taken on in\r\nalmost every vessel leaving for the port of Manila, the annual export\r\nin that direction would not seem to be at all over-estimated if put\r\ndown at 400,000 dollars. The goods represented by this amount are not,\r\nit should be remarked, used in the city and province of Manila alone,\r\nbut enter also into the consumption of Pampanga, La Laguna, Camarines\r\nand other provinces of Luzon. In addition to the export of piña to\r\nthe capital, about 30,000 dollars worth of cotton and silk sarongs\r\nand handkerchiefs are sent yearly to Camarines. Some quantity is also\r\nexported to Leyte and Samar, but anything like an approximate value of\r\nthe goods so shipped cannot be given. In fact the subject of statistics\r\nhere has received so little attention, either from the authorities or\r\nfrom the local traders themselves, that on terminating his notice of\r\nthe principal articles exported from Panay, Mr. Loney regrets to find\r\nhimself unable to supply a reliable account of their united value. The\r\nEstadistica de Filipinas, issued in 1855, and compiled at Manila by\r\nthe Comision Central, nominated for that purpose, gives, from data\r\nprobably obtained from the very imperfect custom-house entries, the\r\nfollowing as the value of the imports into Manila from Panay in 1854:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Dollars.

These figures,\r\nif Capiz be put down at 700,000 dollars, and the Antique exports be\r\ntaken at 70,000 dollars, will give to the yearly exports from Panay\r\nan aggregate value of upwards of 1,500,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nBut even the imperfect data of the Estadistica would afford some\r\nindication of the rapid rate of increase in the exports from the\r\nthree provinces. For example--\r\n\r\n                                                              Dollars.\r\n\r\n   1852--value of products from Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique    271,335\r\n   1853    ,,  ,,    ,,     ,,    ,,      ,,    ,,    ,,      302,605\r\n   1864    ,,  ,,    ,,     ,,    ,,      ,,    ,,    ,,      648,369\r\n\r\n\r\nOr an augmentation in 1854 of considerably more than double the amount\r\ngiven in 1852. While on this subject, it may be added that the local\r\ncustom-house has unfortunately registered no complete details of the\r\nexports for 1856, though it has commenced doing so for 1857. These\r\ndetails are, however, relatively of much less importance than those\r\nof direct foreign shipments, which will demand future attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Loney thus adverts to the present state of the Iloilo import\r\ntrade:--\r\n\r\n\"Although perhaps the greater part of the clothing for the population\r\nof Panay is furnished by the native looms, still a large amount of\r\nEuropean goods is annually imported from Manila. I estimate that on the\r\naverage (as far as can be judged where anything like positive data are\r\ntotally wanting) about 30,000 dollars to 40,000 dollars per month are\r\nnow brought in goods to the port of Iloilo by the mestizo and Chinese\r\ntraders, and subsequently disposed of at the larger markets of Jaro,\r\nMolo, Oton, Mandurriao, &c., from whence a certain portion finds its\r\nway into the interior. This branch of the trade is as yet principally\r\nconducted by the mestizo dealers of Molo and Jaro, who, on completing\r\ntheir purchases of native-made goods for the Manila market, embark with\r\nthem (in numbers of from six to ten, fifteen, and sometimes twenty)\r\nin the coasting vessels leaving for the capital. The returns for\r\nthese speculations they generally bring back in foreign (principally\r\nBritish) manufactures, purchased at cheap rates from the large Chinese\r\nshopkeepers at Manila. The sale of these goods by retail here is\r\nstill conducted in the rather primitive way of conveying them from\r\nplace to place on certain fixed days. In this way goods that appear\r\nto-day at the weekly fair or market of Jaro, are subsequently offered\r\nfor sale at Molo, Mandurriao, Oton, or Arévalo. They are carried to\r\nand from the different pueblos in cumbrous, solid-wheeled vehicles,\r\ndrawn by buffaloes and oxen, a mode of conveyance which, during\r\nthe wet season, is attended with a good deal of delay and risk. The\r\nChinese dealers at Molo, and a few small traders at Iloilo, have,\r\nhowever, commenced opening permanent shops, and it is probable that\r\nthe number of these will gradually increase throughout the province,\r\nthough, as the fairs are also the central point of attraction for all\r\nthe products within a certain radius of each pueblo, and thus bring\r\ntogether a large concourse of people, the weekly transfer of piece\r\nand other goods from one place to another must still continue to a\r\ngreat extent. There are about thirty Chinese permanently established\r\nat Molo (mostly connected with others at Manila, either as partners or\r\nagents), and two or three at Jaro. A certain number are also employed\r\nin voyaging to and from Manila with goods, after realizing which here\r\nthey return for a fresh parcel, either taking the returns in money\r\nor produce. One of the Chinese traders at Molo, who is well supplied\r\nfrom the capital, sells goods to the amount of some 30,000 dollars\r\nor 40,000 dollars a-year. Owing, however, to too much competition\r\namong themselves and the other traders, I do not, judging from the\r\nprices at which they usually sell, think that their profits are in\r\ngeneral at all large. The fact that the mestizo dealers look for\r\ntheir principal profit to the piña goods which they take to Manila,\r\nand are comparatively less solicitous to obtain an advance on their\r\nreturn goods, has also a tendency to keep prices low, as compared\r\nwith Manila rates.\r\n\r\n\"As is the case in most of the provinces where the Chinese have\r\npenetrated, there exists a more or less subdued feeling of hostility\r\ntowards them on the part of the natives, and a tendency, both among the\r\nmestizos and Spanish, to regard them as interlopers. But though the\r\ngovernment at Manila has been repeatedly urged to withdraw them from\r\nthe provinces, and confine their trading operations to Manila alone, it\r\ndoes not seem inclined to adopt a measure which would prove injurious\r\nto the general trade of the colony. It is true that if a portion of the\r\nChinese were induced to become agriculturists (for which purpose alone\r\nthey were originally admitted to the provinces), great benefit would\r\naccrue in the shape of an increased outturn of produce; but as yet\r\ntheir numbers in the interior are too few to enable them to cultivate\r\nthe ground on a large scale, and in small isolated bodies they would\r\nnot have sufficient security from the ill-will of the natives.\r\n\r\n\"The principal articles of foreign manufacture imported into this\r\nprovince are--handkerchiefs (printed) of bright attractive colours,\r\nwove and printed trouserings, ginghams, fancy cambayas, plain\r\ngrandrills, white shirtings, gray shirtings and gray longcloths,\r\ngray twills (29 inches, both American and English), bleached twills,\r\nlawns, white jaco-nets, striped muslins, cotton sewing thread,\r\ncotton sarongs, cotton twist, or yarn, and woollens (not in much\r\ndemand). There is also sale for hardware, glassware and earthenware,\r\nand for other minor articles.\r\n\r\n\"Import duties are leviable at Iloilo on a valuation either by tariff,\r\nor according to the market rate at time of entry. They are the same\r\nas those charged at Manila, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           By foreign      By Spanish\r\n                                           ships.          ships.\r\n\r\n  On most descriptions of                  14 per cent.     7 per cent.\r\n  foreign goods\r\n    With the following exceptions:--\r\n    Cambayas, ginghams, handkerchiefs,\r\n    &c., entirely of black, purple, and\r\n    blue, with or without white grounds    25 per cent.    15 per cent.\r\n    Yarn of same colour                    50 per cent.    40 per cent.\r\n    Ditto, red, yellow,\r\n    rose and green                         free            free\r\n  Machinery, gold and silver,\r\n  plants and seeds                         free            free\r\n  Made-up clothing, boots, &c.             50 per cent.    40 per cent.\r\n  Bottled ale or porter                    25 per cent.    20 per cent.\r\n  Wine, liquors and vinegar                50 per cent.    40 per cent.\r\n  Spirits                                  60 per cent.    30 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tropical productions, similar to those of the Philippines, are not\r\nadmitted to consumption, nor fire-arms, without a special licence.\r\n\r\n\"All goods may be bonded on payment of 1 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"Export duties on produce of every description to foreign ports are,\r\n3 per cent. by foreign, and 1 1/2 per cent. by Spanish ships, with\r\nthe following exceptions:--Hemp, 2 per cent. by foreign, and 1 1/2\r\nper cent. by Spanish ships; tortoise-shell, mother-o'-pearl shell,\r\n1 per cent. by foreign, and 1 per cent. by Spanish ships; rice,\r\n4 1/2 per cent. by foreign, and 1 1/2 per cent. by Spanish ships.\r\n\r\n\"No duties are charged on goods arriving or departing coastwise by\r\ncoasting vessels.\r\n\r\n\"Port dues.--No special charges are yet fixed for vessels arriving\r\nat Iloilo, but they may be stated as about equivalent to those levied\r\nat Manila, viz.:--On foreign vessels arriving and leaving in ballast,\r\n18 3/4 c. per ton; with cargo inwards or outwards, 34 3/4 c. per ton;\r\nwith cargo both inward and outward, 37 1/2 c. per ton.\r\n\r\n\"Wages are moderate at Iloilo:--Labourers, 12 1/2 c. to 18 3/4 c. per\r\nday; carpenters, 18 3/4 c. to 25 c. per day; caulkers, 25 c. per day.\r\n\r\n\"Fresh provisions are obtainable at cheap rates.\r\n\r\n\"The weights and measures in use for produce are--the quintal, of 4\r\narrobas, or 100 lbs. Spanish, equal to 101 3/4 lbs. English; pecul\r\nof 100 catties, or 140 lbs. English. The cavan of rice (cavan de\r\nprovincia) is equal to one and a half of the Manila cavan, or cavan\r\ndel rey; it weighs about 190 lbs. English, and measures 8,997 cubic\r\ninches. The pesada, by which sapan-wood is sold, weighs 13 arrobas\r\n13 lbs., or nearly 2 1/2 peculs.\r\n\r\n\"The currency is nominally the same as in Manila, but silver dollars\r\nhave to be paid for nearly all purchases, gold being of difficult\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n\"From the preceding outline of the trade of this port, you will gather\r\nthat at present, with an annual export of about 1,600 tons of sugar,\r\nupwards of 2,000 tons of sapan-wood, and 350 to 400 tons of hemp,\r\nit is (considering the quantity which the foreign shippers would be\r\nable to secure) capable of furnishing cargoes for two foreign vessels\r\nof moderate tonnage; and next year, as regards sugar, which will form\r\nthe bulk of the cargoes of foreign vessels loading here, the supply\r\nwill probably be doubled. The more important question, however, as\r\nregards the foreign trade of Iloilo, is not as to the actual quantity\r\nof produce (still so very limited) which this island may furnish,\r\nbut whether the concentration of produce from the neighbouring islands\r\nand provinces will in reality be brought about.\r\n\r\n\"A review of the facts regarding the southern Philippines would seem to\r\nlead to a conclusion in the affirmative. With Leyte and Samar giving\r\na combined annual export of 4,000 tons of hemp, Cebú upwards of 5,000\r\ntons of sugar, Negros a (rapidly expanding) product of about 900 tons\r\nof sugar and 800 tons of hemp, and without taking into account the\r\npossible supply of hemp which may be drawn from South Camerines and\r\nfrom Albay (which produce by far the largest part of the existing\r\nexport of hemp from the Philippines, and are, during the north-east\r\nmonsoon, within a shorter distance of Iloilo than Manila), it seems\r\nin no way hazardous to assume that, on relatively equal prices\r\nbeing obtainable here, Iloilo will attract in the course of time a\r\ngradually augmenting proportion of the products which now go on to\r\nManila. It may be further conjectured that Misamis (which yields a\r\nconsiderable quantity of remarkably good hemp), Caraga, and the other\r\nprovinces of Mindanao, may also in time contribute their share to the\r\nproducts obtainable at a port which their traders must pass on their\r\nway to Manila, though the full development of the intercourse of the\r\nneighbouring islands with Iloilo will greatly depend on the amount of\r\nEuropean imports with which this latter port should gradually be able\r\nto supply its new customers. The opinion of the natives themselves,\r\nthough not to be taken as a guide, may still serve in some measure\r\nas an index of what may be looked for. In talking on the subject to\r\nthe owners of the small craft whose cargoes of hemp have been brought\r\nto Iloilo, they have frequently said, 'If foreign vessels come here\r\nand give higher prices, much more hemp from Leyte and Camarines will\r\ncome to Iloilo.'\r\n\r\n\"Cebú producing rice and manufactures for its own consumption, there\r\nis at present little communication between it and Iloilo; but it is\r\nencouraging to learn that one of the partners of the most enterprising\r\nSpanish firm at this place intends proceeding both to Cebú and Leyte,\r\nto establish, if practicable, a commercial connection, with the\r\nulterior view of getting both sugar and hemp sent to this quarter.\r\n\r\n\"It is also a favourable symptom that the trade of the contiguous\r\nislands is more and more attracting the attention of some of the\r\nforeign firms in Manila. The American houses (generally the first in\r\nenterprises of this kind) have already, through Spanish intermedia,\r\nestablished agencies at Negros, Leyte and Cebú, for the purchase of\r\nhemp and sugar, and it is stated from Manila, on apparently good\r\nauthority, that one of them has lately advanced a sum of 170,000\r\ndollars for this purpose, the distribution of which should have a\r\nstimulating effect on production, and thus give a collateral aid to\r\nthe future exports from Iloilo.\r\n\r\n\"Considering the great advantages which would accrue from the\r\nestablishment of lines of small merchant steamers between the islands,\r\nthe fact that the government have lately given orders to commence\r\nworking the extensive coal districts existing at Cebú is not without\r\nimportance. The subject of steam communication for the archipelago\r\nis attracting attention at Manila, and it is not improbable that in\r\na few years the islands will be connected in this way in a manner\r\nwhich will greatly tend to their advantage.\r\n\r\n\"It should have been previously mentioned that the voyage from Iloilo\r\nto Manila during the north-easterly monsoon (from November to March)\r\nusually occupies the better class of square-rigged vessels in the trade\r\nfrom ten to fifteen days, and from four to six days on the return\r\nvoyage. Owing to the protection afforded by the group of islands\r\nforming the Silanga, and by other harbours on the route, vessels do\r\nnot (as is usually the case between the ports on the northern part of\r\nthe more exposed coast of Luzon and the capital) lay up during the\r\nstormy months from September to November; and communication, though\r\nless frequent during these months, is seldom altogether suspended\r\nfor any length of time with Manila. On the average, a vessel leaves\r\nfor the capital every eight to twelve days.\"\r\n\r\nI add a few further extracts from a report on the trade of 1858,\r\nwith which Mr. Loney has favoured me, and which strongly exhibits\r\nthe growing importance of Iloilo.\r\n\r\n\"The import trade, in direct connection with British and foreign\r\nhouses, has increased during the past year to a degree which could not\r\nhave been anticipated. Formerly it did not exceed 7,000 dollars in\r\namount; but now, during a period of two years, it has reached fully\r\n140,000 dollars, and is likely to increase much more in future as\r\nthe capabilities of the market for taking off an important quantity\r\nof manufactures become more fully known.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the existence of a stock of foreign articles at Iloilo,\r\nobtainable by the native dealers as a general rule (and as a\r\nconsequence of the more direct manner in which they reach their hands)\r\nat cheaper prices than from the Chinese shops at Manila, many of the\r\nnative, and even some of the Chinese traders, find the advantage of\r\nmaking their purchases on the spot instead of in Manila, and some of\r\nthe former have ceased altogether to undergo the expense and loss of\r\ntime they formerly incurred in proceeding to Manila to lay in their\r\nstocks, while others make voyages to the capital less frequently\r\nthan before, and send on their piña goods under the care of friends\r\nor agents; consequently, the trade is beginning to be conducted in a\r\nless primitive manner than in previous years, when each small trader\r\nbrought on his goods himself, purchased at high rates from the Manila\r\nshopkeepers. Dealers from Antique, from the island of Negros and\r\nfrom Leyte now also find at Iloilo a stock of goods sufficient to\r\nsupply their wants. Another beneficial effect is, that those who buy\r\nwholesale at Iloilo are enabled to dispose of their goods to the small\r\ndealers, or to their agents, who distribute them over the interior,\r\nat lower prices than formerly. Goods are thus saleable, owing to this\r\ngreater cheapness, at places in the interior of the island, where\r\nthey were formerly rarely bought, and the natural consequence is,\r\na considerable increase of consumption. The concurrent testimony of\r\nall the older residents in the province is, that during the last few\r\nyears a very marked change has taken place in the dress and general\r\nexterior appearance of the inhabitants of the larger pueblos, owing\r\nin great measure to the comparative facility with which they obtain\r\narticles which were formerly either not imported, or the price of which\r\nplaced them beyond their reach. In the interior of the houses the same\r\nchange is also observable in the furniture and other arrangements,\r\nand the evident wish to add ornamental to the more necessary articles\r\nof household uses; and those who are aware how desirable it is, from\r\nthe peculiarly apathetic nature of the natives, to create in them an\r\nambition for bettering the condition of themselves and their families,\r\nor emulating that of others, by placing within their reach the more\r\nattractive and useful articles of European production, will at once\r\nrecognize in these facts the beneficial tendency of increased and\r\ncheaper imports.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to duties derivable from imports, we must consider the\r\nmore or less remote probability of direct imports from Europe or China\r\nto Iloilo. It needs very little acquaintance with the gradual and\r\nhesitative processes of trade to be aware of the slowness with which\r\nthey adapt themselves to new channels of communication. Especially\r\nis this the case in reference to these southern islands, from the\r\nprevious commercial seclusion in which they had been kept--a seclusion\r\nso great that it may be safely asserted that the island of Panay, with\r\nits 750,000 inhabitants, is scarcely known, by name even, in any of the\r\ncommercial marts of Europe, America, or even of Asia. Consequently, it\r\naffords no ground for surprise that no direct transactions in imports\r\nhave taken place. It must be recollected that the years 1857-58 have\r\nbeen eminently unfavourable for new commercial enterprises of any\r\nkind, owing to the depressed state of trade in all the markets of\r\nthe world. This state of depression, though still felt, is, however,\r\ndrawing to a close, and the Iloilo market, among others, will doubtless\r\nattract the attention of European manufacturers and capitalists,\r\nthough some time must necessarily elapse before a sufficient number\r\nof shippers can be found to send consignments of such a varied nature\r\nand assortment as would be required to make up a cargo to suit the\r\nwants of Panay and the neighbouring islands. Already consignments\r\nhave arrived by way of Manila, which were made up specially for the\r\nIloilo market; and this circumstance, and the fact that the Manchester\r\nmanufacturers are beginning to take an interest in the Iloilo demand,\r\nfully warrant the belief that before long consignments from Europe,\r\nby the way of Manila, will take place on an important scale, and pave\r\nthe way to direct shipments to Iloilo. Though it is almost useless to\r\nprognosticate in cases of this kind, where so many circumstances may\r\noccur to retard or accelerate the development of a new market, still\r\nI have no hesitation in affirming it to be much more than probable,\r\nthat in the course of two years from this time Spanish vessels will\r\narrive from Liverpool direct, or touching and discharging part of\r\ntheir cargoes at Manila, more particularly as by that time direct\r\nexports will have taken place, and the sugar crop be raised to a\r\npoint which will render it easy for the vessels arriving with piece\r\ngoods to obtain return cargoes of sugar, sapan-wood and hides, all of\r\nwhich products, it is unnecessary to say, can be obtained at Iloilo\r\nmuch more cheaply than in Manila.\r\n\r\n\"It is also probable that direct imports from China will take place\r\nsooner than from Europe. The employment of raw Shanghai silk is much\r\ngreater at Iloilo than in any of the other Philippine provinces,\r\nand the consumption amounts to fully 30 peculs per month, worth,\r\non an average, 600 dollars, silver, per pecul, or say 18,000 dollars\r\nper month.\r\n\r\n\"The export trade from Iloilo direct to foreign markets is, in fact,\r\nevidently the primary event on which the commercial fate, so to speak,\r\nof the Bisaya Islands depends. The chief obstacle, in addition to\r\nthose mentioned above, which has retarded its commencement has been\r\nthe extreme smallness of the yield of sugar. In 1855-56, the Iloilo\r\ncrop, including some quantity received from the island of Negros,\r\nscarcely reached 12,000 peculs, and, instead of increasing, it\r\nhad been declining in consequence of the discouraging effect of the\r\nmiserable price of 1·875 to 2 dollars per pecul of 140 lbs.; all that\r\ncould be obtained for it after incurring the expense of sending it to\r\nManila. In 1856-57, under the stimulus of higher prices, the yield\r\namounted to 35,000 to 37,000 peculs. In 1857-58, these high prices\r\nhad a still more stimulating effect on the planting of cane, and\r\nit was calculated that the crop would yield at least 50,000 peculs;\r\nbut an excess of rainy weather reduced the actual outturn to about\r\n30,000. The present crop, however, of 1858-59 has escaped the danger\r\nof rain, and it is computed that it will yield about 80,000 peculs\r\nfrom January to July next. Some estimates place it as high as 100,000\r\npeculs, but in this I think there must be exaggeration.\r\n\r\n\"The yield of sugar at Iloilo (leaving out of the question the crop\r\nof Isla de Negros, which is now computed to produce 30,000 peculs,\r\nand that of Antique, 20,000, both available for the Iloilo market)\r\nhaving fortunately reached the above amount, direct sugar exports\r\nhave now become possible, and preparations are made for shipments to\r\nAustralia direct, during the first months of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n\"'To reach the consuming markets by the most direct line, to avoid\r\ntransshipments and save double freights are objects, commercially, of\r\nthe highest importance.' [36] And there is an aspect of the matter\r\nwhich renders it still more necessary, as regards the Philippine\r\ntrade, that these objects should be kept in view. Australia is now,\r\nafter Great Britain, the most important market for the Philippine\r\nsugars, and particularly for the reclayed Bisayan sugars of Iloilo\r\nand Cebú, which are there used for refining purposes, and it will most\r\nundoubtedly be before long the largest consumer of the sugar of these\r\nislands. In 1857 the exports of Iloilo and Cebú sugar from Manila to\r\nAustralia were 18,178 and 51,519 peculs respectively, while to all\r\nthe other markets, including Great Britain, they were only 11,519\r\nand 41,699 peculs; and the same year the total export of all kinds\r\nof sugar to Australia was even more than to Great Britain, being\r\n17,847 tons, or 285,552 peculs, to the former, against 16,675 tons,\r\nor 266,800 peculs, to the latter market. In the present year (1858),\r\nthe total export from Manila to Australia, owing to a deficiency in\r\nthe Pampanga crop, and the discouragement caused to the Australian\r\nimporters by the high prices of 1857, have only reached 9,038 tons,\r\nor 145,028 peculs.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime Mauritius, Java and Bengal all supply large\r\nand increasing quantities of sugar to Australia, and Mauritius in\r\nparticular, possessing the great advantages of greater proximity (as to\r\ntime) and of machinery and other appliances far superior to those in\r\nuse in the Philippines, furnishes the Australian market with a large\r\nquantity of crystallized and yellow sugars, which are much sought for\r\nin Sydney and Melbourne, where the steady increase of population and\r\ngeneral wealth augment the demand for high-classed sugars. In 1857 the\r\nAustralian colonies took 24,000 tons, or 384,000 peculs, of sugar from\r\nMauritius; and the latest accounts anticipate that the shipments this\r\nyear to the same quarter will be 30,000 tons, or 480,000 peculs. To\r\nquote the words of the Port Louis Commercial Gazette of August 10th,\r\n1858:--'There is no doubt that the present crop will reach the figures\r\nof 240,000,000 lbs., say 120,000 tons' (nearly 2,000,000 peculs);\r\n'but as the Australian colonies took 24,000 of the last crop, we must\r\nexpect they will take at least 30,000 of this, our crystallized and\r\nyellow sugars gaining in estimation there.' The same journal, of the\r\n27th of October, adds, 'This facility of realizing produce at fair\r\nprices has given animation to business and has improved the prospects\r\nof the colony. There are now 150 vessels in our harbour, loading and\r\ndischarging for and from different parts of the world. Our marine\r\nestablishments are busily engaged in repairing vessels of different\r\nnations that have been happy to seek refuge here; our vast quays are\r\ntoo small for our commerce; the capacious new stores lately erected,\r\nand which embellish our port, are filled with goods and produce; 25,000\r\nimmigrants have been added to our population this year, whilst only\r\n6,500 have left. Our public revenue has largely increased--companies\r\nare prosperous--cultivation has been extended, sugar machinery and\r\nworks improved and increased, and private buildings throughout the\r\nprincipal part of the town enlarged and improved in appearance.'\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately for the Philippines, with respect to their\r\nbetter-appointed rivals--Mauritius, Java and Bengal--the low-graded\r\nunclayed sugars of Iloilo, Capiz and Antique, Isla de Negros and Cebú,\r\nare, in ordinary times, cheaper than those of either of the latter\r\ncolonies, and consequently more adapted for refining purposes; but\r\nnothing can place in a stronger light than the above facts regarding\r\nthe export from Mauritius the very great importance of keeping the\r\nway open for exporting the unclayed Philippine sugars to Australia\r\nat the cheapest possible cost to the importers.\r\n\r\n\"The much greater extent and more than equal fertility of the\r\nPhilippines, as compared with Mauritius, must, in the end, if no\r\nartificial obstacles are again imposed on the production of the\r\nformer, lead to the development of larger sugar crops than those of\r\nthe latter colony.\r\n\r\n\"The results of the opening of the ports of Soerabaya, Samarang,\r\nCheribon, and others in the island of Java are encouraging\r\ncircumstances, as showing, among other similar examples, of what\r\nimportance Iloilo, as the central port of the Bisayan Islands, may\r\nbecome. Soerabaya and Samarang (and especially the former), which enjoy\r\na favourable proximity to the chief points of production, now export\r\nan immense quantity of produce, and orders for the direct shipment\r\nto Europe of rice, sugar, coffee, tobacco and other Javan products\r\nare transmitted by electric telegraph by the Batavian houses to their\r\nagents at these ports over a distance exceeding 350 miles. I cannot\r\nat present do more than briefly allude to the approaching commencement\r\nof an export of timber and furniture woods from Iloilo and Antique to\r\nChina. The Spanish ship Santa Justa loaded a large cargo of wood this\r\nyear for Hong Kong, which has lately been sold at 63 1/2 cents per\r\nfoot. Since then, in anticipation of the demand for the rebuilding of\r\nCanton, the price has risen in Hong Kong, and arrangements are being\r\nmade for the charter of a large vessel, either Spanish or foreign,\r\nto convey other cargoes to China; and there is every prospect of\r\nthere being, before long, an active traffic in this article, which,\r\nas before noticed, is of excellent quality, abundant, cheap, and easily\r\naccessible near Iloilo, and at the adjoining province of Antique.\r\n\r\n\"It is recommended that vessels making the voyage to Iloilo from\r\nAustralia, or any place to the south of the Philippines, should,\r\nduring the S.W. monsoon, enter the archipelago between the islands of\r\nBasilan and Zamboanga, and, on passing Point Batalampon, keep well\r\nup to Point Gorda, and make the Murcielagos Island, so as to avoid\r\nbeing driven to the westward by the strong currents setting from off\r\nthe Mindanao coast during both monsoons.\r\n\r\n\"Pending the N.E. monsoon, the best course is to make a détour\r\nto the east of the Philippines, and enter the archipelago by the\r\nStraits of San Bernardino. The straits should be entered by Samar\r\nand Masbate. Vessels bound from Manila or northern ports may proceed\r\nthrough the Mindoro passage, but they should consult Don Claudio\r\nMontero's charts. After passing Tablas and Romblon (an excellent\r\nharbour there), make for the Silanga Islands, a good mark for which\r\nis the high conical island called Sugar Loaf (Pan de Azucar). During\r\nthe N.E. monsoon vessels should keep between the islands of Jintotolo\r\nand the larger Zapato (Shoe Island), but during the S.W. pass between\r\nOliuaya and the smaller Zapato. The best channel is between Sicogon\r\nand Calaguan, but the outer and broader passage between the groups\r\nof islands and that of Negros is preferable for large ships. There is\r\nsafe anchorage through the inner route. At Bacuan and Apiton supplies\r\nare to be found.\r\n\r\n\"The tide through the Silanga Islands and Seven Sins flows at the\r\nrate of three to four miles an hour--from the Seven Sins to Iloilo\r\noften at six to seven miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\nCommercial prosperity is so intimately connected with general\r\nimprovement and the increase of human happiness, that one cannot but\r\nlook with interest upon the results of any legislation which removes\r\nthe trammels from trade and gives encouragement to industry, and the\r\nisland of Panay may be considered a promising field for the future. The\r\nlatest accounts report that the planting of cane has been extended very\r\nrapidly in this province, owing to the continuance of high prices for\r\nsugar, and also to the fact of the direct export trade to Australia\r\nhaving commenced. Planters now see that the arrival of foreign vessels\r\nwill lead to a permanent demand for their sugars at prices which will\r\npay them better than those formerly obtainable for the Manila market,\r\nfrom whence, before the opening of the port of Iloilo to foreign trade,\r\nall the sugar of this and the neighbouring provinces had to be shipped\r\nat a great additional expense in heavy coasting freight, landing\r\nand reshipping charges, sea risk, commission, brokerage, &c., all of\r\nwhich are now avoided by direct shipment at the place of production.\r\n\r\n\"The stimulus given to planting has resulted this year in an increase\r\nin the yield to 60,000 peculs (3,750 tons), and, judging from the\r\namount of cane planted for next season's crop, it is fully anticipated\r\nthat in 1860 about 140,000 peculs (7,500 tons) will be produced,\r\nwithout counting on the quantity yielded by the neighbouring provinces\r\nof Antique (30,000 peculs) and the island of Negros (35,000 to 40,000\r\npeculs), from both of which places sugar is brought and exported.\r\n\r\n\"The difference in the cost of sugar at Iloilo and at Manila is at\r\npresent 2l. 16s. 5d. per ton, free on board; as will be seen from\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Manila, 23rd April, 1859.

Loney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the favourable prospects for commerce at Iloilo,\r\nlittle or nothing has been done for the improvement of the port or for\r\nfacilitating the extension of its trade. There is no buoy, no light,\r\nno indication of dangerous places, though the Oton shoal is extending\r\nitself, and it is of the greatest importance that the safe channel\r\nshould be pointed out to navigators. The latest Admiralty instructions\r\n(1859) are as follow:--\r\n\r\n\"Port Iloilo, situated on the southern shore of Panay Island,\r\nthough well protected and naturally good, is not without certain\r\ninconveniences, capable, however, of being easily obviated; provided\r\nwith a good chart, and if approaching from the northward with a pilot,\r\nlarge vessels may enter with safety.\r\n\r\n\"The depth of water on the bar at the entrance to the creek or river\r\nIloilo is about five fathoms at low water, but at a short distance\r\nwithin it decreases to fifteen feet, and then deepens again. The rise\r\nof tide being six feet, a vessel drawing sixteen to eighteen feet can\r\neasily enter or leave; and when, as is proposed, a dredging-machine is\r\nemployed to clear away the mud which has been allowed to accumulate at\r\nthe shallower parts near the entrance, vessels of almost any burden\r\nwill be able to complete their cargoes inside. A Spanish ship of 700\r\ntons, in 1857, loaded part of a cargo of tobacco inside the creek,\r\nand finished the lading outside.\r\n\r\n\"The banks of the creek being of soft mud, there is little or no risk\r\nto be apprehended from grounding. Proceeding about a mile and a half up\r\nthe creek, which varies in breadth from one-half to three-quarters of\r\na mile, the coasting craft bring up at the jetties of their respective\r\nowners, and have the great advantage of discharging and loading at the\r\nstores without employing boats. Beyond this point the creek reaches as\r\nfar as Molo, to which place coasting vessels formerly could proceed by\r\npassing through a drawbridge. This got out of repair, and the present\r\nbridge affording no means of passage, they remain at Iloilo, where\r\nthe Molo traders have had to transfer their storehouses. The works\r\nof a new moveable bridge, to allow vessels to pass, have, however,\r\nalready been commenced.\r\n\r\n\"The island of Guimaras forms, in front of Iloilo, a sheltered passage,\r\nrunning nearly north and south, of a breadth varying from two miles and\r\na half to six miles, with deep water and good anchorage. The southern\r\nentrance to this passage is much narrowed by the Oton Bank, which\r\nextends a considerable distance from the Panay shore, and contracts\r\nfor about a mile the available channel at this port to the breadth\r\nof about two miles. This shoal is fast becoming an island. There is,\r\nhowever, no obstacle to large vessels during the north-west monsoon\r\n(especially as the channel is to be buoyed), the passage being quite\r\nclear, and in the north-east monsoon they can work or drop through\r\nwith the tide, keeping well over towards Guimaras (the coast of which\r\nis clear, with deep waters quite close in), anchoring, if necessary,\r\non the edge of the shoal, which affords good holding-ground and may\r\nbe safely approached. The whole of this part of the coast is, in fact,\r\nsafe anchorage during the north-east monsoon.\r\n\r\n\"If blowing hard in the southern channel to Iloilo, a vessel may\r\nproceed to the port of Bulnagar, or Santa Ana, on the south-west\r\nside of Guimaras, which is of easy access, and capable of admitting\r\nvessels of the largest tonnage, and it affords good shelter under\r\nalmost any circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"The approach from the northward to the northern entrance to\r\nIloilo is generally made by the coasting craft through the small,\r\nrichly wooded islands Gigantes, Sicogon, Pan de Azucar, Apiton,\r\n&c., called collectively the Silanga, which lie off the north-east\r\ncoast of Panay, and afford an admirable refuge for a considerable\r\ndistance to the vessels engaged in the trade with Manila and the\r\nsouthernmost Bisangas. Though, however, there is excellent anchorage\r\namong these islands, particularly at Pan de Azucar and Tagal, it\r\nwould be most prudent for large ships, in cases where there is no\r\npractical acquaintance with the set of the tides, currents, &c., to\r\ntake the outside channel between the Silanga and the island of Negros.\r\n\r\n\"After passing the Calabazos rocks and Papitas shoal, and sighting the\r\nblock-house of Banate\" (erected, like many others along the Philippine\r\ncoasts, for defence against the pirates of the Sulu Sea), \"the course\r\nis due south, until sighting a group of seven remarkable rocks,\r\ncalled the Seven Sins, which lie between the north end of Guimaras\r\nand the Panay shore; a direct course for them should then be made,\r\ntaking care to keep the lead going to avoid the Iguana Bank. Vessels\r\nof proper draught may enter the creek, or, if too large, should bring\r\nup on the east side of the fort, where they are protected from the\r\nwind and strength of the tide.\r\n\r\n\"A lighthouse, for exhibiting a fixed light, is to be erected on the\r\nSeven Sins, and another on Dumangas Point. Buoys are also to be laid\r\ndown along the channel near the Iguana and Oton shoals.\" [37]\r\n\r\nThe latest report on the navigation of the port of Iloilo is given\r\nin the note below. [38]\r\n\r\n\r\nIloilo has great facilities for the introduction of wharves, piers and\r\nlanding-places, but none have been constructed. The entrance to the\r\nriver, and, indeed, the whole of its course, might be easily dredged,\r\nhut little or nothing is done for the removal of the accumulating mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSUAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe province of Pangasinan consists principally of an extensive plain,\r\nor, rather, of a very gradual descent from the mountains where the\r\nIgorrote Indians dwell, and extending to those of Zambales. The roads\r\nare generally good and have trees planted by their sides, and the\r\nlands are rich and fruitful. Many rivers descend from the hills and\r\nare used for the conveyance of timber, rattans, and other forest\r\nproductions. The Igorrotes collect gold in the mountain streams,\r\nespecially in the neighbourhood of Asingan. Large herds of wild\r\nbuffaloes, oxen, deer and pigs, are found on the hills, but little\r\nattended to by the natives. The fertility of the lands will give\r\na crop of sugar and of rice in the same year. The coast and lakes\r\nabound with fish, of which, as of salt, cocoa-nut oil and sugar,\r\nthere is a considerable exportation. Hides are tanned for the\r\nManila market. Ship-building is an important branch of industry,\r\nespecially on the Agno River. Multitudes of the women are employed\r\nin making straw hats, cigar-cases and other articles, of the fibres\r\nof various vegetables, some of great fineness and selling for high\r\nprices--a cigar-case is sometimes valued at an ounce of gold. Mats,\r\nplain and ornamented, are also manufactured for use and for sale. It\r\nis said that the Indian, with no other instrument than his knife\r\nfor all his domestic needs, and his plough for his field labours,\r\nsupplies himself with every object of desire. Women are proud of having\r\nwoven and embroidered the garments worn by their husbands and their\r\nchildren, and they present a gay appearance on days of festivity. In\r\nthe year 1755 there was a serious insurrection against Spanish rule,\r\nand again in the year 1762, when the English took Manila; but both were\r\nsubdued, though the population was diminished to the extent of 20,000\r\nby these outbreaks. Two distinct idioms are spoken in the province,\r\nthe aboriginal Pangasinan people being distinct from the races which\r\npenetrated from Ilocos. The Dominican friars exercise the principal\r\necclesiastical authority in the province.\r\n\r\nOn our leaving Iloilo, after three days' steaming, and sighting Nasog\r\nand the Isla Verde, which had been recommended to us as a preferable\r\ncourse to that of the outer passage by which we had come down, we\r\nreturned to Manila again to enjoy the hospitalities of the palace\r\nof the Governor and the attentions of my friend Colonel Trasierra,\r\nin whose hands I had been so kindly placed. We arrived on the Dia de\r\nlos Reyes (day of the kings), one of formal reception at court. In the\r\nevening we took a long ride into the country as far as the province\r\nof Bulacan, which is divided from that of Tondo by a handsome\r\nstone bridge over a branch of the Pampanga River. The question of\r\ngoing by land to Lingayen, which can in favourable circumstances\r\nbe accomplished in a day, the distance being thirty leagues, was\r\ndiscussed, but the state of the roads not being satisfactory, and the\r\ndelay consequently uncertain, I determined again to take ship, and on\r\nthe second day of our voyage we anchored at Sual. The captain of the\r\nport came out to pilot us into the harbour, in the middle of which is\r\na dangerous rock not laid down in many of the charts. The narrowness\r\nof the passage requires much precaution, but once anchored, it is a\r\nvery safe and well-sheltered, though small harbour. The appearance\r\nof Sual disappointed us; a few scattered dwellings, the church and\r\nthe custom-house, did not look very promising. On landing, however,\r\nthe musicians of the pueblo came to escort us with their band, and we\r\nlearnt that all the authorities were at Lingayen, a few miles off;\r\nbut a courier was immediately despatched to announce our arrival,\r\nand, as a specimen of the language, I give a copy of the receipt he\r\nbrought back to show that his mission had been properly fulfilled:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Recibido del Conductor de S.

Tropical fruit-trees are seen all along the\r\nline of the road, through which the Indian cabanas prettily peep;\r\nthe women and children in their gay dress giving a picturesque and\r\nvaried character to the scene. The windows and platforms before the\r\nhouses were crowded with spectators, who seemed greatly delighted\r\nas from time to time we recognized their courtesies or admired some\r\nflag more demonstrative or more decorated than the rest. We entered\r\none or two of the ship-building yards, and our naval officials\r\nexpressed their satisfaction with the state of naval architecture\r\namong the natives. One vessel on the stocks was of 350 tons. An\r\nIndian ship-builder, who was introduced to us as being remarkable\r\nfor mechanical genius, came from some distance to ask permission from\r\nCaptain Vansittart to visit the Magicienne, and to instruct himself in\r\nmatters connected with the application of steam-engines to navigation,\r\nand to discover any other improvements of which he expected a British\r\nship of war to bear about the evidence. The leave, which was very\r\nhumbly asked, was very courteously given; on obtaining which the Indian\r\nwas trotted off in his carriage without losing a moment. The abundance,\r\nadjacency, excellence and cheapness of the materials on the banks of\r\nthe Agno give it great advantages for the construction of vessels,\r\nbut the bar is a great obstacle against their getting to sea.\r\n\r\nWe were met on the road by the alcalde mayor, and I entered his\r\ncarriage. The superior Spanish officials carry a cane with a gold head\r\nand a silk tassel as a mark of their authority; and we galloped away to\r\nLingayen, the cabazera of the province. It has a population of 23,000\r\nsouls. The roads were good, except in one part where the Agno had\r\nmade itself a new channel, and there the horses had some difficulty in\r\ndragging the carriage through the sand. We came upon the coast, and the\r\nwaves were dashing with foaming impetuosity, as if tempest-vexed, upon\r\nthe shore; but joining again the principal causeway, we pursued our\r\njourney without interruption. We had been accompanied by the excellent\r\nVice-Consul Don José de Bosch and Friar Gabriel, who was everywhere\r\nour guardian and guide. The vice-consul was thoroughly cognizant of all\r\ncommercial matters, and furnished me with the information I sought. The\r\nfriar was delighted to pour out his stores of local knowledge, and\r\nthey were great, while the alcalde, Señor Combas, was in all things\r\nkind, considerate and communicative. In fact, it was impossible not\r\nto feel at home when everybody was contributing to amuse, interest\r\nand instruct. We visited several of the pueblos in the neighbourhood,\r\nand at Calasiao, which has 18,000 inhabitants, the gobernadorcillo\r\nbrought us specimens of the manufactures of the place, and pressed a\r\nfine straw hat on my acceptance, while the good Friar Gabriel insisted\r\non every one of our party carrying away a cigar-case. What we had\r\nseen elsewhere was repeated in the pueblos through which we passed,\r\nin each of which the friars and the principalia were on the qui vive,\r\nnot only for our comfort and accommodation, but to do us all honour. We\r\nreturned to Lingayen at sunset, and the good father summoned us to\r\ndine with him the following day, on which occasion he said he would\r\ndo his best to show us what his convent could produce. And certainly\r\nnothing was wanting. The tables were crowded with numerous guests,\r\nand covered with abundant supplies of substantial and decorative\r\ndishes. I imagine the father must have drawn on all the resources of\r\nthe community, for the meats and drinks, the plate and the porcelain,\r\ndecanters and glasses, and all the paraphernalia of a handsome public\r\ndinner, were there, and there was no small amount of fun and jollity,\r\nthe padre taking the lead.\r\n\r\nFather Gabriel boasted of the immense capabilities of the\r\nriver Agno. It flows through a large portion of the province\r\nof Pangasinan, and was navigable for a great distance in its\r\nwanderings. He sketched its course upon paper, and pointed out\r\nthe many pueblos which it visited. The misfortune was, it had a\r\nterrible bar, and could not be navigated from or into the sea. The\r\nriver is certainly one of considerable depth, and of great beauty,\r\nhaving its source in the Cordillera of Caraballes in the province of\r\nAbra, amidst wild mountains, and receiving, in its flowing course,\r\nmany confluent streams. Between San Isidro and Lingayen there was\r\nmuch ship-building on its banks, and a busy Indian population. On\r\nthe shores were fine forest trees ready for the hand of the woodman,\r\nmaterials for cordage, bamboos and canes, which are brought down by\r\nthe wild tribes of Igorrotes. It is said that much gold is found\r\nin the sand and mud of the river. Many attempts have been made by\r\nthe Spaniards, and especially by the friars, to conquer, civilize\r\nand christianize the wild tenants of the rough and craggy regions,\r\nbut with little success. Their numbers are increased by criminals\r\nescaping from justice, and who seek and find refuge in the least\r\naccessible parts of Luzon.\r\n\r\nFather Gabriel, who has greatly interested himself in developing the\r\ncommercial resources of Sual, which he called his \"port,\" expressed\r\na confident expectation that the establishment of foreign trade and\r\nthe visits of shipping for cargoes, would induce the natives to bring\r\ndown their produce and open the way to the influences of improvement.\r\n\r\nWe found it necessary to prepare for our departure, but our good\r\nfriends had determined, as we had come by land, we should return by\r\nwater, and an aquatic procession, with flags and music, was put in\r\nmotion. The sky lowered, the rain fell in tropical torrents, and\r\nthe musicians and other actors and spectators dispersed; nothing\r\ndiscouraged, however, after a delay of two hours, sunshine brought\r\nthem out again. The boats were put in requisition, the bands of music\r\nreassembled, and we embarked on the river Agno. All went on pleasantly\r\nand perfectly for an hour, when a drenching storm compelled me to\r\nleave the open barge in which I was, and to seek the shelter of one of\r\nthe covered boats. Many of our companions were as thoroughly wetted\r\nas if they had been dragged through the water, and we reached San\r\nIsidro as if escaped from wreck. There we sought dry garments, and the\r\nfriars' wardrobes were largely drawn on for our comforts. Grotesque,\r\nindeed, were the figures and drapery of many, and a humorous sketcher\r\nmight have made excellent capital out of the laughing groups. Some\r\ngot carriages, some horses, and some disappointment, to help us to\r\nSual, where a handsome dinner was provided at the custom-house by the\r\nvice-consul. The harbour-master broke out into poetry in honour of the\r\nBritish flag, and gloria and Victoria rhymed in to the delectation of\r\nthe guests, and to the echoes of the walls. Our captain was inspired,\r\nand harangued our hospitable hosts in answer to the warm brindis of\r\nthe company. The Indians had been studying our national song, and\r\nfor the first time the noble air of \"God save the Queen\" was heard in\r\nthe pueblo of Sual. It was late when we got on board the Magicienne,\r\nbut before our departure on the following day, the authorities,\r\nthe vice-consul and the friar, with many attendants, were on board\r\nto give us a despedida as kind as our welcome had been cordial. They\r\nbrought various presents as souvenirs, and a lilliputian midshipman,\r\nwho had excited the interest and admiration of the visitors, was\r\nspecially summoned that he might receive a cigar-case from the hands\r\nof Padre Gabriel. As soon as they left, our anchor was raised and we\r\nsteamed away from Pangasinan and the Philippines. It would be strange,\r\nindeed, if we took not with us a grateful memory of what we had seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LONDON:\r\n                   PRINTED BY SMITH, ELDER, AND CO.,\r\n              LITTLE GREEN ARBOUR COURT, OLD BAILEY, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A recent History of the Conquest of the Islands, and of the\r\nSpanish rule, is given by Buzeta, vol. i., pp. 57-98.\r\n\r\n[2] I visited some Cochin Chinese prisoners in the fortification. They\r\nhad been taken at Turon, and one of them was a mandarin, who had\r\nexercised some authority there,--said to have been the commandant\r\nof the place. They wrote the Chinese characters, but were unable to\r\nunderstand the spoken language.\r\n\r\n[3] Among my early literary efforts was an essay by which the strange\r\nstory was utterly disproved of the destruction of the MSS. which had\r\nserved Cardinal Ximenes in preparing his Polyglot Bible.\r\n\r\n[4] One woman, six children.\r\n\r\n[5] All children.\r\n\r\n[6] The account given by Spanish writers of the taking of Manila\r\nby the British forces, and here translated from Buzeta's narrative,\r\nseems given with as much fairness as could be expected.\r\n\r\n\"In 1762, the city of Manila had reached to wonderful prosperity. Its\r\ncommercial relations extended to the Moluccas, Borneo, many parts\r\nof India, Malacca, Siam, Cochin China, China, Japan--in a word, to\r\nall places between the Isthmus of Suez and Behring's Straits. But at\r\nthe end of this year a disaster visited the city which prostrated it\r\nfor many years after. The English, then at war with Spain, presented\r\nthemselves with considerable forces. The most illustrious Archbishop\r\nDon Manuel Royo, then temporarily in charge of the government,\r\nhad received no notice of any declaration of war, and had made no\r\npreparations for defence. The enemy's fleet was the bearer of the\r\nnews. The garrison was composed of the regiment del rey, which ought\r\nto have numbered 2,000 men, but was reduced to 500, by detachments,\r\ndesertion and disease. There were only 80 artillerymen, all Indians,\r\nwho knew little about the management of guns. In this state of matters,\r\nthe English fleet suddenly appeared on the 22nd September, 1762. It\r\nconsisted of thirteen ships, with 6,830 excellent troops. In total\r\nignorance of public affairs, the fleet was supposed to be one of\r\nChinese sampans. Some defensive measures were adopted, and an officer\r\nwas sent to inquire of the commander of the fleet what was his nation,\r\nand what the object of his unannounced visit. The messenger returned\r\nthe following day, accompanied by two English officers, who stated that\r\nthe conquest of the islands was the purpose of the expedition. They\r\nwere answered that the islands would defend themselves. On the night\r\nof the 23rd/24th, the enemy effected their disembarkation at the\r\nredoubt of St. Anthony Abbot. An attempt was made to dislodge them;\r\nit failed. They were fired upon in the morning of the 24th, but with\r\nlittle effect, so well were they entrenched and protected by various\r\nbuildings. In order to arrest their proceedings, it was determined\r\nto make a vigorous sally, whose arrangement was left to M. Fallu,\r\na French officer in the service of Spain; but this valiant soldier\r\nsoon found that the foreign troops were too numerous to be dealt with\r\nby his forces. He fought during the night, and did not return to the\r\ncitadel till 9 A.M. of the following day. There was a suspension of\r\nhostilities, and the invaders sent a flag of truce to the city. The\r\nbombardment continued on the 25th, and our grape-shot did much damage\r\nto the enemy. On the 28th, in the morning, the English general asked\r\nfor the head of an officer who, having been the bearer of a flag\r\nof truce two days before, had been decapitated by the Indians. He\r\ndemanded also the delivery of the persons who had committed the crime,\r\nand, if refused, threatened horrible reprisals. The requirement was\r\ncomplied with; and the Archbishop, who was exercising the functions\r\nof government, and directing the defence of the city, showed himself\r\non horseback to the camp of the enemy, but without result. On the\r\n29th, the English squadron received a reinforcement of three ships,\r\nwhich bore 350 Frenchmen from Pondicherry, who sought an opportunity\r\nto turn upon the English, and nominated two of their confidants to\r\narrange their desertion and the accomplishment of their purpose; but\r\nthe two confederates were supposed by the Indians to be Englishmen,\r\nand, instead of being welcomed, were slain. The English, being informed\r\nof what had taken place, secured themselves against further treachery\r\non the part of the French. On the 3rd of October, a large force of\r\nPampangan Indians having arrived, a sally was resolved upon: it was\r\nvery bloody, but of no benefit for the defence. The following day the\r\nbesiegers made a breach in the Fundicion bulwarks. A council of war was\r\nheld, and the military decided that a capitulation was imperative:\r\nthe citizens were for continuing the defence. Unfortunately the\r\nArchbishop was carried away from this opinion, which led to so many\r\ndisasters for Manila. On the 4th, there was a general conviction that\r\nthis city would soon be compelled to surrender; and the title of the\r\nLieutenant to the Government having been conferred on the judge (oidor)\r\nSimon de Anda y Salazar, in order that he might transfer the seat\r\nof Spanish authority to some other part of the island, and provide\r\nfor its defence, he left the same evening at 10 P.M., in a launch\r\nwith a few rowers, a Tagál servant, 500 dollars in silver, and forty\r\nsheets of official stamped paper. These were his resources against an\r\nenemy having sixteen vessels in the bay, and who were on the point of\r\nentering the city. Thus without an army or a fleet, a man of more than\r\nthreescore years reached Bulacan, determined on pertinacious opposition\r\nto those conquerors who were about to enter the capital. They did\r\nenter on the following day, leaving their entrenchments and advancing\r\nin three columns to the breach, which was scarcely practicable. Forty\r\nFrenchmen of Pondicherry led and found no resistance. The fortress was\r\ncompelled to surrender. The city was sacked for forty hours, neither\r\nthe churches nor the palace of the Archbishop or Governor finding any\r\nmercy. The loss of the Spaniards during the siege was three officers,\r\ntwo sergeants, fifty troops of the line, and thirty civilians of the\r\nmilitia, without reckoning the wounded; the Indians had 300 killed\r\nand 400 wounded. The besiegers lost about 1,000 men, of whom 16 were\r\nofficers. The fleet fired upon the city more than 5,000 bombs, and\r\nmore than 20,000 balls. It might have been hoped that a sack of forty\r\nhours and the capitulation of the garrison would have satisfied the\r\nenemy; it was not so, for during the sackage the English commander\r\ninformed the Archbishop that all the inhabitants would be massacred\r\nif two millions of dollars were not immediately paid in coin, and\r\ntwo millions more in drafts on the Spanish treasury. To this it was\r\nnecessary to accede, and the charitable funds and the silver ornaments\r\nof the churches were devoted to the payment.\r\n\r\nWhile the events of Manila had this tragic termination, Anda collected\r\nin Bulacan the Alcalde, the ecclesiastics, and other Spaniards,\r\nshowed them his authority, which was recognised with enthusiasm. On\r\nthe evening of the same day news of the fall of Manila was received,\r\nand Anda published a proclamation declaring himself Governor and\r\nCaptain-General of the Philippine Islands, and chose for the seat\r\nof his government Bacalor in Pampanga. He thus for fifteen months\r\ncarried on the war, notwithstanding the insurrections fomented by\r\nthe English, especially among the Chinese, and notwithstanding the\r\ngeneral disorganization of the provinces. In fact, he almost kept\r\nthe English blockaded in Manila, from whose walls they scarcely dared\r\nto venture. In Malenta, a property of the Augustin friars, a French\r\nsergeant, named Bretagne, who deserted from the English, and induced\r\nsome thirty of his countrymen to follow his example, was made captain,\r\nand directed operations against the invaders, to whom he appears to\r\nhave given much trouble by intercepting provisions, and attacking\r\nstragglers from the city. The English offered 5,000 dollars for the\r\ndelivery of Anda alive into their hands. But on the 3rd July, 1763, a\r\nBritish frigate arrived announcing an armistice between the belligerent\r\npowers, and directing the cessation of hostilities. In March, 1764,\r\nnews arrived of the treaty of peace; the English evacuated Manila,\r\nand Spanish authority was re-established. The mischief done by the\r\nEnglish was repaired by Governor Basco.\"\r\n\r\n[7] MS. of the Siege of Manila, by Fr. Juan de Santa Maria.\r\n\r\n[8] Diccionario geográfico, estadístico, histórico de las Islas\r\nFilipinas. 2 vols. Madrid, 1850.\r\n\r\n[9] There is an English translation--\"Twenty Years in the\r\nPhilippines.\" Vizetelly. 1853.\r\n\r\n[10] I learn from the Captain-General that Messrs. de la Gironière\r\nand Montblanc are now charged with \"a scientific mission to the\r\nPhilippines,\" under the auspices of the French government.\r\n\r\n[11] I find in Mr. Dixon's book on Domestic Poultry the merits of this\r\ndiscovery in the science of incubation attributed to an ancient couple,\r\nwhose goose having been killed while \"sitting,\" the old man transferred\r\nthe \"cooling\" eggs to their common bed, and he and the old lady taking\r\ntheir turns, safely brought the goslings into being. I ought to mention\r\nthat confirmatory proofs of M. de la Gironière's narrative are added\r\nfrom Mr. H. Lindsay; but Mr. Lindsay guards himself against endorsing\r\nthe \"strange stories\" with which M. de la Gironière's book abounds.\r\n\r\n[12] The Chinese seem everywhere to preserve the same\r\ncharacteristics. The British Consul-General of Borneo writes to\r\nme:--\"Chinese settlers cannot flourish under Malay rule. We have a\r\nfew hundreds, but the country would absorb hundreds of thousands. In\r\nthe interior I found among the aborigines a lively remembrance of\r\nthe former Chinese pepper-growers; they have been all destroyed\r\nor driven away by civil dissensions. There remain a few of their\r\ndescendants, who speak the language of their fathers, but they are\r\nnot distinguishable from the natives. A Chinese merchant was speaking\r\ndisparagingly of one of the chiefs, who turned round, and, much to\r\nthe astonishment of the Chinaman, accosted him in very tolerable\r\nFokien. The little pepper-growing that remains is partly conducted\r\nby the mixed races. The produce is slightly increasing, and a few\r\nChinese with native wives are beginning to try it again.\"\r\n\r\n[13] Both gael and sapaha are terms probably introduced by traders with\r\nChina. Tael and sapeque are the names given by Europeans to the liang\r\nand tsien of the Chinese, the silver ounce and its thousandth part.\r\n\r\n[14] There may be some interest in the following details, as a\r\nspecimen; but it is by no means one of the most distinguished.\r\n\r\nProgramme of the Procession of the Holy Interment, proceeding from\r\nthe Church of San Domingo, and returning thither through the principal\r\nstreets of Manila:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Civil guards on horseback.\r\n    Files of bearers of wax lights along the line of procession.\r\n    Military, under their several heads and colours.\r\n    Carabineers of the Hacienda,  bearing lights, 8.\r\n    Company of Engineers,              ditto,     8.\r\n    Carabineers of Public Safety,      ditto,     8.\r\n    Cavalry (Lancers),                 ditto,     32.\r\n    Infantry (Borbon),                 ditto,     32.\r\n    Ditto (Princesa),                  ditto,     32.\r\n    Ditto (Infante),                   ditto,     32.\r\n    Ditto (Fernando VII.),             ditto,     32.\r\n    Artillery Brigade, No. 1,          ditto,     32.\r\n    Ditto, No. 2,                      ditto,     32.\r\n    Infantry (Rey),                    ditto,     32.\r\n    Peasants bearing lights.\r\n    Officers of the army and marine and public functionaries.\r\n    Collegiates of St. John of Lateran.\r\n    Secular clergy.\r\n    Brotherhood of St. Domingo.\r\n    Two files of sisterhood (Beatas).\r\n    The centre of the procession to consist of\r\n    Band of music of Infantry (Rey).\r\n    Standard.\r\n    Ten representations of the Passion, carried by the clergy at\r\n    appropriate distances.\r\n    Six collegiates of St. John of Lateran with cirios (large wax\r\n    lights).\r\n    Image of St. John the Evangelist.\r\n    Eleven representations of the Passion, carried by the clergy.\r\n    Six collegiates of St. John with cirios.\r\n    Image of St. Mary of Magdalene.\r\n    Band of music of Infantry (Ferdinand VII.).\r\n    Ten representations of the Passion, as before.\r\n    Musical choir chanting the Miserere.\r\n    Eight collegiates of St. Thomas with cirios.\r\n    Car conveying The Lord.\r\n    By the side of the car, eight Halberdiers, with funeral halberds.\r\n    Music of Infantry (No. 7).\r\n    Pall (palio) carried by collegiates of St. John of Lateran.\r\n    Brotherhood of the interment, in semicircle.\r\n    Six collegiates of St. John of Lateran with cirios.\r\n    Image of Santa Maria Salomé.\r\n    Six collegiates of St. Thomas with cirios.\r\n    Image of Santa Maria Jacoba.\r\n    Choir of music, singing Stabat Mater.\r\n    Six collegiates of St. Thomas in file with cirios.\r\n    Image of our Lady de los Dolores.\r\n    Pall carried by six collegiates of St. Thomas.\r\n    Preste (celebrator of high mass) in his black cope, with two\r\n    sacristans at the right and the left.\r\n    H.

Sinibaldo de Mas (afterwards Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of Spain in China). Madrid, 1853.\r\n\r\n[31] M. Marcaida considers the best historical and descriptive\r\nauthorities to be the Fathers Blanco, Santa Maria, Zuñiga, Concepcion,\r\nand Buzeta. He speaks highly of Don Sinibaldo de Mas' Apuntes, of\r\nwhich I have largely availed myself.\r\n\r\n[32] Buzeta may be consulted, especially under the head \"Caraga,\"\r\non which he has a long article.\r\n\r\n[33] Archbishop Hilarion says:--\"There are multitudes of pueblos,\r\nsuch as Argao, Dalaguete, Boljoon in Zebu, and many in the province\r\nof Iloilo, where it would be difficult to find either a boy or girl\r\nunable to read or write, which is more than can be said for many of\r\nthe cities of the Peninsula.\"--(Answer to Manila Deputation.)\r\n\r\n[34] Among the arts by which pernicious legislation is defeated, a\r\ncurious example is presented in the Philippine Islands. White cotton\r\ntwist being prohibited in the interest of certain home producers,\r\nit is found to be more economical to import yellow and green twist,\r\nwhich is allowed to enter, and it is afterwards converted to white\r\nby extracting the colour, which is easily accomplished by steeping\r\nthe thread in a strong infusion of lime.\r\n\r\n[35] In 1859 it is likely to amount to from 3,000 to 3,500 tons.\r\n\r\n[36] Quoted from Sir J. Bowring's letter to N. Loney of Aug. 3, 1858.\r\n\r\n[37] The track of the Spanish discovery ships Atrevida and Descubierta\r\npasses over it. See Admiralty chart of St. Bernardino Strait and\r\nparts adjacent, No. 2,577; scale, degree = 6 inches.\r\n\r\n[38] Vessels bound to Iloilo by the southern passage, if in the\r\nN.E. monsoon, should, when to the northward of Point Guinad, beat up\r\nalong the coast of Guimaras. In April, 1859, in the barque Camilla,\r\nfrom Manila to Iloilo, I had soundings much farther to the S.W. than\r\nare laid down on the Spanish charts. With Point Guinad bearing south,\r\nand Point Balingasag bearing east, I had from seven to nine fathoms\r\nwater, with soft ground. Stood to the N.W., had regular soundings\r\nseven fathoms.\r\n\r\nWhen five or six miles off shore, had four fathoms, tacked inshore,\r\nand brought up for the night, Point Cabalig bearing N.E. two miles,\r\neight fathoms water; good holding-ground, soundings deepening to\r\ntwenty fathoms when one mile off shore.\r\n\r\nPoint Cabalig and Point Bondulan, when bearing N.E., form two very\r\nprominent headlands, which are not shown on the Spanish charts I\r\nhad. With common precaution there is no danger whatever in approaching\r\nthe port of Iloilo by keeping the coast of Guimaras close inboard from\r\nPoint Cabalig until nearly abreast the fort, which will clear the\r\nOton Bank. Even should a vessel ground, she will receive no damage,\r\nand can be easily got off, as the bottom is quite soft. When the fort\r\nbears S.W. by W. one mile, the channel to Iloilo is then open, and\r\nwith a flood-tide keep the N.E. point close on board. When past it,\r\nkeep more over to the other shore, where there are from three and a\r\nhalf to three fathoms water close to the shore, and two fathoms at low\r\nwater. The port of Iloilo is a perfect dock formed by nature. Vessels\r\nlay alongside the wharf, where there are two and a half fathoms at high\r\nwater, and two fathoms at low water, and every facility for discharging\r\nand loading. I discharged 200 tons of ballast and took in 300 tons of\r\nsugar within nine days. Labour and fresh provisions are very moderate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIloilo, 4th May, 1859.       (Signed) J. H.
