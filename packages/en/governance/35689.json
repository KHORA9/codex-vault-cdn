The anti-suffragists polled 295,939. Since 1896\r\nthere has been but one instance in which the voters gained a plurality\r\namounting to 110,000 votes. The anti-suffragists won by 133,447 votes.\r\nAlton B. Parker's defeat by Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 is commonly\r\nregarded as typifying political annihilation; but the suffragists in\r\n1915 did not poll as many votes as Mr. Parker, and the anti-suffragists\r\npolled 38,000 more than President Roosevelt at the height of his\r\npopularity. Such outworn words as \"overwhelming\" and \"landslide,\" which\r\nhave been regularly used to describe victories not half so great as\r\nthis, understate the actual extent of the anti-suffrage triumph. The\r\npronounced aversion which Massachusetts showed towards Horace Greeley in\r\nthe presidential campaign of 1872, and towards William J. Bryan in that\r\nof 1896, scarcely exceeded that which she feels towards the suffragists\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of this aversion are so numerous that it is difficult to\r\ndetermine which of the many causes of the anti-suffrage victory were the\r\nmost powerful. In my opinion, however, Massachusetts men defeated woman\r\nsuffrage chiefly because (1) they discovered that nine women out of ten\r\ndid not want to vote; (2) they knew that the creation of a large body of\r\nstay-at-home voters would result in bad government; and (3) they grew\r\ndisgusted with the temperament, the notions, and the methods typical of\r\nthe few women who clamored for the vote.\r\n\r\nFor at least two generations suffragists have been spending a huge\r\namount of energy and money in spreading their doctrine. Contributions,\r\nmainly drawn from a few rich women, have enabled them to send\r\nprofessional speakers into every district of the state, to distribute\r\ntons of \"literature,\" to supply the press with a constant stream of\r\n\"news\" written from their point of view, and in general to advertise\r\ntheir claims in the most lavish way. A propaganda so subsidized would\r\nhave been successful decades ago if sound principles and common sense\r\nwere on its side. But to their consternation the suffragists found that\r\nthe vast majority of Massachusetts women turned a deaf ear to their\r\nplausible appeals, and that their strongest opponents were those of\r\ntheir own sex.\r\n\r\nSuffragists continued to talk about what \"we women\" want. But men\r\npresently began to see that these women had no right to pretend to\r\nrepresent their sex. Even their own claims as to the number of women\r\nsupporting them showed that they represented only between 5% and 10% of\r\nthe women of Massachusetts. At least 90% of the women--either by open\r\nopposition, or by a marked indifference to the subject--showed that they\r\ndid not believe in woman suffrage. It became obvious that no general\r\nstatement could be more emphatically true than that Massachusetts women\r\ndid not want to vote.\r\n\r\nWhen this truth was insistently pressed upon the suffragists, they were\r\napt to call the indifferent women \"unenlightened.\" This was felt to be\r\nan insult rather than an explanation. The average Massachusetts man does\r\nnot think his mother, wife, and sister \"unenlightened\"--certainly not on\r\nthe suffrage question. She has heard and read the suffrage notions again\r\nand again. He knows that if she felt that man was her oppressor, or that\r\nthe welfare of herself or her family would be increased by her\r\nenfranchisement, she would say so. She is a sensible, observant woman,\r\nwho knows what she wants, does not hesitate to ask for it, and usually\r\ngets it. But she was not asking for the ballot. It did not take her long\r\nto see through the suffrage fallacy that \"only those women would need to\r\nvote who want to.\" She realized that the vote would mean an obligation\r\nas well as a privilege, and that she could not honorably accept the\r\nprivilege without undertaking the obligation. Her life being already\r\ncrowded with duties that only she could discharge, she would not add to\r\nthem one that her husband, brother, or son can discharge at least as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIf any man wondered whether his personal inquiries among the women of\r\nhis acquaintance gave a sufficiently broad basis for the belief that\r\nwomen did not want to vote, he became convinced of the fact when he\r\nlearned about the Drury bill of 1913. This bill would have given\r\nMassachusetts women a chance to vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" on woman suffrage.\r\nThe proposal resulted in the amazing revelation that the suffragists\r\nwere afraid to let women vote on the question. They worked against the\r\nbill because they knew that an official count would disclose how\r\npitiably small a fraction of women were on their side. They thought that\r\ntheir little group, by noisy publicity, could be made to appear a\r\nconsiderable number. But the men, when they discovered who opposed the\r\nDrury bill, were not deceived. They saw that a small minority of women\r\nwas trying to induce them to coerce the great majority. They awoke to\r\nthe fact that the suffragist's demand was not that men should grant\r\nwomen an expressed desire, but that men, contemptuously disregarding the\r\nevident wishes of women, should force upon them a heavy responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that responsibility brings us to what seems to me the\r\nsecond important cause for the suffrage defeat. Men--more than\r\npolitically inexperienced women,--know that good government depends upon\r\nthe willingness of the electorate to do its duty vigilantly and\r\nregularly. The greatest good of the greatest number of classes\r\n(including the women and children in each class) can be secured only\r\nwhen a large proportion of the eligible voters vote. Those voters who\r\nare led by bosses, or by selfish interests, go to the polls steadily.\r\nTheir influence can be offset only when the rest of the electorate goes\r\nlikewise. The results of elections in which a small proportion of the\r\neligible voters take part, are poor laws and incompetent or corrupt\r\ngovernment. The leading political issues--the tariff, trusts,\r\ntransportation, military and police force, taxation, finance, etc.--bear\r\ndirectly upon the work of men in their trades and business, and under\r\nmale suffrage a fairly large proportion of the vote is cast. The\r\nlife-work of women removes them from contact with these political\r\nquestions, and the nature of most women is not attracted by the\r\ncontentious spirit in which political warfare is conducted. As long as\r\nno more than 10% of the women took an interest in the woman suffrage\r\nquestion itself, no man could reasonably expect them to be otherwise\r\nthan indifferent to the regular subjects of political conflict. To\r\nimpose political duties upon the sex against its will was simply to\r\ncreate conditions that encouraged corrupt and feeble government. The\r\nsoundness of this principle was, furthermore, being demonstrated in\r\nwoman-suffrage territory, such cities as Seattle and such states as\r\nColorado showing that sooner or later a neglectful electorate leads to\r\nthe downfall of good government.\r\n\r\nThe third cause for the defeat of woman suffrage was the disgust which\r\nthe manners, methods, and unethical sentiments of the suffragists\r\naroused. This is not pleasant to dwell upon, but was too important an\r\ninfluence in the campaign to leave unmentioned. The suffragists\r\nprofessed to \"occupy higher moral ground,\" to uplift politics, and to\r\nelevate womanhood. The longer one observed their deeds and words, the\r\nsurer one became that they were not uplifting politics and that they\r\ntended to disgrace women in men's eyes. The tone of politics can be\r\nimproved if the contestants will avoid false assertions and unnecessary\r\npersonal attacks. The suffragists said and did things which were, like\r\nmilitancy, excusable only on the immoral ground that the end justifies\r\nthe means.\r\n\r\nAs an example of their disingenuous statements, the following may serve.\r\nThe National Woman Suffrage Association circulated a flyer entitled\r\n\"Twenty Facts About Woman Suffrage.\" \"Fact No. 15,\" under the heading,\r\n\"How Women Vote,\" read: \"Arizona, California, Colorado and Washington\r\nare the only states in the Union which have eight-hour laws for working\r\nwomen.\" Any unsuspecting reader would infer just what he was intended to\r\ninfer--namely, that it was woman suffrage that brought about all these\r\neight-hour laws, and that male suffrage had not brought about any of\r\nthem. A more nearly truthful heading for this \"fact\" would have been\r\n\"How Men Vote.\" The credit for passing the eight-hour law in California\r\nand in Washington (also in Arizona so far as laundry workers are\r\nconcerned) belongs to legislatures elected by men alone. False\r\nsuggestions of this type no doubt gained many proselytes in parlor\r\nmeetings; but when they were made in the open forum of a public\r\ncampaign, their untruth was exposed, and the voters grew indignant that\r\nwomen should thus have tried to mislead them. The suffragists only made\r\na bad matter worse by alleging that their anti-suffrage sisters were\r\ngiven to misrepresentations and to every other crime in the political\r\ncalendar; for men thereupon concluded that if this initial participation\r\nin politics had such a demoralizing effect on the women of each side, it\r\nwas best to keep both parties out of the arena altogether.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists' tendencies to make bitter personal attacks was\r\nrepeatedly shown. Not wishing to resurrect some of the venemous charges\r\nbrought against anti-suffrage women, I take leave to illustrate the\r\nbaseless characters of such attacks by one made against myself. In the\r\nspring of 1915, I gave a series of lectures on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of anti-suffrage. The audiences were gratifyingly large;\r\nthere was a demand for several repetitions of the lectures; and,\r\napparently, the suffragists felt that something must be done to destroy\r\nmy pernicious influence. Instead of answering my arguments, the\r\nPresident of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association, Miss Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, wrote an editorial in her \"Woman's Journal,\" saying:\r\n\r\n\"This young gentleman is a Dane, and he has been very fluent and\r\nsomewhat contemptuous in giving reasons why American women should not be\r\nallowed to vote.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement was, as usual, spread broadcast through the suffrage\r\ncolumns of the Massachusetts newspapers; and doubtless my opponents\r\nindulged the hope that in the wave of national feeling which was then\r\nbeginning to rise, anybody thus branded as a foreigner would be badly\r\ndiscredited. As a matter of fact, I was born in Brooklyn, N. Y. (If I\r\nhad chosen to imitate Miss Blackwell's method of controversy, I might\r\nhave retorted that my father, who was born in Denmark, but who came to\r\nAmerica in 1855, fought as a volunteer officer in the Navy of the United\r\nStates in the Civil War, at a time when Miss Blackwell's father was\r\nengaged in a safer occupation.)\r\n\r\nThe repellant impression made upon men by the suffragists' misstatements\r\nand personal abusiveness was deepened by their support of militancy and\r\nfeminism. As to the unethical character of the latter, Mrs. Foxcroft's\r\nessay in this book presents startling and irrefutable testimony. As to\r\nmilitancy, it may be said that this furnished the most glaring (though\r\nnot the only) evidence of the evil effect of political activity on\r\nwomen. Much is usually made of the fact that Mrs. Pankhurst and her\r\naccomplices in crime destroyed a large amount of valuable property.\r\nBut the greatest injury she and her American idolizers did was to lower\r\nman's ideal of woman. They tried to make the virago a heroine. They did\r\nnot succeed; but the more Mrs. Pankhurst's apologists glorified her, the\r\nmore men were determined not to endorse a party that tempted women to\r\nabandon real womanliness for mock masculinity.\r\n\r\n                                                     ERNEST BERNBAUM\r\n  CAMBRIDGE, MASS.\r\n    _February, 1916_\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

JOHN BALCH\r\n\r\n    _Katharine Torbert Balch, wife of John Balch; Treasurer of the\r\n    Summer Industrial School of Milton; member of the Executive\r\n    Committee of the Milton Branch of the Civil Service Reform\r\n    Association; director of the Ely Club of New York City; member\r\n    of the Executive Committee of the special Preparedness Committee\r\n    appointed by Governor Walsh; President of the Massachusetts\r\n    Women's Anti-Suffrage Association._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply to oft-repeated calumnies about the membership and affiliations\r\nof the Anti-Suffrage Association, I offer a plain statement of facts\r\nwhich can be verified.\r\n\r\n36,761 Massachusetts women, twenty-one years of age or over, are to-day\r\nregistered members of the Massachusetts Women's Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation. They are not confined to one section of the state, but are\r\nfound distributed among no less than 443 cities, towns, and villages.\r\nEach year the organization increases; and each year the members of the\r\n137 state branches draw closer together in their opposition to suffrage\r\nand their striving for the true progress of woman and of civilization.\r\n\r\nThese women are not of only one class or type. An examination of our\r\nenrollment reveals among our members not only the very large group of\r\nhomemakers, but also authors, doctors, lawyers, teachers, librarians,\r\nnewspaper-writers, stenographers, social service workers, cooks,\r\nhousemaids, nurses, milliners, insurance agents, restaurant-keepers,\r\nclerks, shopkeepers, private secretaries, dressmakers, seamstresses,\r\netc., etc. During the recent campaign, the co-operation, devotion, and\r\nself-sacrifice of this body of women was inspiring. From the wage-earner\r\nwho endured systematic nagging, if not persecution, from suffragists, to\r\nthe woman of wealth who gave of her vitality to the breaking point,\r\ndaily came the evidences of immovable faith in the righteousness of\r\ntheir cause.\r\n\r\nMany of our leaders are prominent in public welfare activities. The late\r\nMrs. Charles D. Homans, one of the founders of our organization, was an\r\nactive and important member of the Massachusetts Prison Commission. Mrs.\r\nJames M. Codman, our beloved ex-President, has served twenty years on\r\nthe State Board of Charities, was one of the first women overseers of\r\nthe poor ever elected in this state, and has long been one of the\r\nmanagers of a large private hospital. Miss Mary S. Ames, a former\r\nPresident, is a member of the Executive Council (New England section) of\r\nthe National Civic Federation, Chairman of the Committee on Practical\r\nTraining for Girls, a Trustee of the Boston Home for Incurables, one of\r\nthe managers of the Women's Free Hospital, a director of the Brook House\r\nHome for Working Girls, a member of the Easton Agricultural Vocational\r\nTraining Committee, a Trustee of Unity Church (Easton), and a member of\r\nthe Advisory Board of the Belgian Relief Committee. Mrs. Henry P.\r\nKidder, of our Executive Board, is President of the Woman's Educational\r\nAssociation. Mrs. Robert S. Bradley, also of our Executive Board, is\r\nChairman of the Sanitation Department of the Women's Municipal League,\r\nand has led in the fight for exterminating the typhoid fly. Were I to\r\ncontinue to enumerate the characteristic activities of our anti-suffrage\r\nwomen, I could fill pages with the record of their participation in\r\nphilanthropy, education, and all good works. The brief notes prefixed to\r\nthe essays in this book give additional evidence to the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE FALLACIES\r\n\r\nMRS. A. J. GEORGE\r\n\r\n    _Alice N. George, widow of Dr. Andrew J. George; graduated from\r\n    Wellesley in 1887; is President of the Brookline Branch of the\r\n    Ramabai Association; American Representative of the National Trust\r\n    (English) for the Preservation of Historic Places; a director\r\n    of the College Club; a member of the Research Committee of the\r\n    Educational and Industrial Union, of the Welfare Department of\r\n    the National Civic Federation of the Woman's Trade Union League,\r\n    of the American Society for Labor Legislation, etc., etc._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage must ultimately fail. It is based upon a fallacy, and no\r\nfallacy has ever made a permanent conquest over mankind.\r\n\r\nThe fallacy of woman suffrage lies in the belief that there is in our\r\nsocial order a definite sex division of interests, and that the security\r\nof woman's interests depends upon her possession of the elective\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\n\"The history of mankind,\" declared the founders of the suffrage\r\nmovement, \"is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part\r\nof man toward woman, having as the indirect object the establishment of\r\nan absolute tyranny over her.\" \"Man has endeavored in every way he\r\ncould,\" continues this arraignment of the fathers, husbands, and sons of\r\nthese self-styled _Mothers of the Revolution_, \"to destroy her\r\nconfidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect and to make her\r\nwilling to lead a dependent and abject life.\"\r\n\r\nOn this false foundation was built the votes-for-women temple. How shall\r\nit endure? The sexes do not stand in the position of master and slave,\r\nof tyrant and victim. In a healthy state of society there is no rivalry\r\nbetween men and women; they were created different, and in the economy\r\nof life have different duties, but their interests are the common\r\ninterests of humanity. Women are not a class, they are a sex; and the\r\nwomen of every social group are represented in a well-ordered\r\ngovernment, automatically and inevitably, by the men of that group. It\r\nwould be a fatal day for the race when women could obtain their rights\r\nonly by a victory wrested at the polls from reluctant men. These truths\r\nare elementary and self-evident, yet all are negatived by the\r\nvotes-for-women movement.\r\n\r\nThat the vote is not an inalienable right is affirmed by Supreme Court\r\ndecisions, the practice of nations, and the dictates of common sense. No\r\nstate can enfranchise all its citizens, and since the stability of\r\ngovernment rests ultimately upon a relentless enforcement of law, the\r\nmaintenance of a sound fiscal policy, and such adjustment of the\r\ndelicate interweaving of international relations as makes for peace and\r\nprosperity, it is right that the state should place the responsibility\r\nof government upon those who are best equipped to perform its manifold\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nWoman's citizenship is as real as man's, and no reflection upon her\r\nabilities is involved in the assertion that woman is not fitted for\r\ngovernment either by nature or by contact in daily experience with\r\naffairs akin to government. She is weak along the lines where the\r\nlawmaker must be strong. In all departments where the law is to be\r\napplied and enforced, woman's nature forbids her entrance. The casting\r\nof a ballot is the last step in a long process of political\r\norganization; it is the signing of a contract to undertake vast\r\nresponsibilities, since it is the following of the ballot to its\r\nconclusion which makes the body politic sound. Otherwise political power\r\nwithout political responsibility threatens disaster to all.\r\n\r\nThus far we have made a few crude experiments in double suffrage, but\r\nnowhere has _equal_ suffrage been tried. Equal suffrage implies a fair\r\nfield with favor to none--a field where woman, stripped of legal and\r\ncivil advantages, must take her place as man's rival in the struggle for\r\nexistence; for, in the long run, woman cannot have equal rights and\r\nretain special privileges. If the average woman is to be a voter, she\r\nmust accept jury service and aid in the protection of life and property.\r\nWhen the mob threatens, she must not shield herself behind her equal in\r\ngovernment. She must relinquish her rights and exemptions under the law\r\nand in civil life, if she is to take her place as a responsible elector\r\nand compete with man as the provider and governor of the race. Such\r\nequality would be a brutal and retrogressive view of woman's rights. It\r\nis impossible, and here we have the unanswerable answer to woman\r\nsuffrage theories.\r\n\r\nNo question of superiority or equality is involved in the opposition to\r\nvotes for women. The test of woman's worth is her ability to solve the\r\nproblems and do the work she must face as a woman if the race is not to\r\ndeteriorate and civilization perish. The woman's suffrage movement is an\r\nimitation-of-man movement, and as such merits the condemnation of every\r\nnormal man and woman.\r\n\r\nDoubtless we can live through a good deal of confusion, but it is not on\r\nany lines of functional unfitness that life is to be fulfilled. Woman\r\nmust choose with discrimination those channels of activity wherein \"what\r\nshe most highly values may be won.\" Are these values in the department\r\nof government or in the equally essential departments of education,\r\nsociety, and religion?\r\n\r\nThe attempt to interpret woman's service to the state in terms of\r\npolitical activity is a false appraisal of the contribution she has\r\nalways made to the general welfare. All this agitation for the ballot\r\ndiverts attention from the only source from which permanent relief can\r\ncome, and fastens it upon the ballot box. It is by physical,\r\nintellectual, and moral education that our citizenship is gradually\r\nimproved, and here woman's opportunities are supreme. If women are not\r\nefficient in their own dominion, then in the name of common sense let\r\nthem be trained for efficiency in that dominion and not diffuse their\r\nenergies by dragging them through the devious paths of political\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nEqual suffrage is clearly impossible; double suffrage, tried under most\r\nfavorable conditions in sparsely settled western states has made no\r\noriginal contribution to the problem of sound government. On the other\r\nside of the ledger we find that the enfranchisement of women has\r\nincreased taxes, added greatly to the menace of an indifferent\r\nelectorate, and enlarged the bulk of unenforced and unenforceable laws.\r\n\r\nWhy does double suffrage, with its train of proved evils and its false\r\nappraisal of woman's contribution to the general welfare, come knocking\r\nat our doors? Not a natural right; a failure wherever tried; demanded by\r\na small minority in defiance of all principles of true democracy; what\r\nexcuse is there for it?\r\n\r\nThe confusion of social and personal rights with political, the\r\nsubstitution of emotionalism for investigation and knowledge, the mania\r\nfor uplift by legislation, have widely advertised the suffrage\r\npropaganda. The reforms for which the founders of the suffrage movement\r\ndeclared women needed the vote have all been accomplished by the votes\r\nof men. The vote has been withheld through the indifference and\r\nopposition of women, for this is the only woman's movement which has\r\nbeen met by the organized opposition of women.\r\n\r\nSuffragists still demand the vote. Why? Perhaps the answer is found in\r\nthe cry of the younger suffragists: \"We ask the vote as a means to an\r\nend--that end being a complete social revolution!\" When we realize that\r\nthis social revolution involves the economic, social, and sexual\r\nindependence of women, we know that Gladstone had the prophet's vision\r\nwhen he called woman suffrage a \"revolutionary\" doctrine.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage is the political phase of feminism; the whole sweep of\r\nthe relation of the sexes must be revised if the woman's vote is to mean\r\nanything more than two people doing what one does now. Merely to\r\nduplicate the present vote is unsound economy. To re-enforce those who\r\nclamor for individual rights is to strike at the family as the\r\nself-governing unit upon which the state is built.\r\n\r\nThis is not a question of what some women want or do not want--it is\r\nsolely a question of how the average woman shall best contribute her\r\npart to the general welfare. Anti-suffragists contend that the average\r\nwoman can serve best by remaining a non-partisan and working for the\r\ncommon good outside the realms of political strife. To prove this\r\ncontention they point to what women have done without the ballot and\r\nwhat they have failed to do with it.\r\n\r\nAnti-suffragists are optimists. They are concerned at the attempt of an\r\norganized, aggressive, well financed minority to force its will upon the\r\nmajority of women through a false interpretation of representative\r\ndemocracy; but they know that a movement so false in its conception, so\r\nfalse in its economy, so false in its reflections upon men and its\r\nestimate of women, so utterly unnecessary and unnatural, cannot achieve\r\na permanent success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE BALLOT AND THE WOMAN IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nMRS. HENRY PRESTON WHITE\r\n\r\n    _Sara C. White, wife of Henry Preston White; educated in the Emma\r\n    Willard School of Troy, New York; a member of the Auxiliary Board\r\n    of Directors of the Brookline Day Nursery; member of the Committee\r\n    on Ventilation of Public Conveyances (Woman's Municipal League);\r\n    With Miss Mabel Stedman of Brookline, Mrs. White started the model\r\n    moving-picture show in connection with the Brookline Friendly\r\n    Society. She is a well-known speaker for the anti-suffrage cause._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument that the woman in industry needs the ballot in order to\r\nobtain fair wages and fair working conditions has undoubtedly made many\r\nconverts to the cause of woman suffrage. The sympathies of the average\r\nman, who is ever solicitous for the welfare of women, go out especially\r\nto the woman who must compete with men in the work-a-day world. And so,\r\nwhen he is told that there are 8,000,000 such women in this country, and\r\nthat their lot would be much easier if they could vote, he is apt to\r\nthink it worth a trial anyway and to give his support, without further\r\nconsideration, to the \"votes for women\" movement.\r\n\r\nNow, if it were true that there are 8,000,000 women in industry, and\r\nthat these must have the ballot in order to get fair treatment, it would\r\nbe a strong argument for woman suffrage--though by no means a conclusive\r\nargument, since the fundamental question is the greatest good of the\r\ngreatest number, and not the greatest good of any class. But it is not\r\ntrue that there are 8,000,000 women in industry, and a single sensible\r\nreason has yet to be advanced for the contention that women in industry,\r\neven if they numbered 8,000,000, could better their condition by\r\nundertaking political methods.\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States, according to the last census, 8,075,772\r\nfemales 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations. Of\r\nthese, over 3,600,000 are employed in domestic and personal service,\r\nwhere wage and working conditions are determined chiefly by women, and\r\nin \"agricultural pursuits,\" a classification including every female who\r\nsells eggs or butter on the home farm. Approximately 4,000,000 of the\r\nremaining gainfully occupied females work in store, factory, and shop,\r\nand of these nearly 1,500,000 are under twenty-one.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of 8,000,000 women in industry who are alleged to \"need\r\nthe ballot,\" we have only about 2,500,000 women of voting age employed\r\nin industries that can reasonably be said to come within the category of\r\nthose properly subject to remedial labor legislation; and of these\r\nwomen a very large percentage are aliens and would not be entitled to\r\nuse the ballot if woman suffrage were granted. By itself, of course,\r\nthis fact does not dispose of the argument that the industrial woman\r\nneeds the ballot, but it does reveal how comparatively few are the women\r\nwho could possibly try to improve their working conditions by means of\r\nthe vote, and how hopelessly outnumbered they would be if reduced to the\r\nnecessity of fighting for their rights at the ballot box.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the suffrage argument that the woman in industry needs\r\nthe ballot in order to get fair treatment is the assumption that she now\r\nfails to get as fair treatment as is given the industrial man, and that\r\nthis is due to the fact that she has no vote. This arbitrary assumption\r\nis without justification either in fact or reason. Every law placed upon\r\nthe statute-books of any state for the benefit of the working man is a\r\nblanket law and covers men and women engaged in the same industry. All\r\nthe benefits that have accrued to the working man through legislation\r\nare enjoyed equally by his sister in industry. In addition she has the\r\nadvantage of special protective laws which have been enacted simply\r\nbecause she is a woman--because she is weaker physically than man and\r\nbecause she is a potential mother and must be protected in the interest\r\nof the race.\r\n\r\nI am not arguing, of course, that the working woman has all the\r\nprotection she needs, but I am arguing that she is not unfairly treated\r\nas compared with her industrial brother, who has the ballot, and that\r\nwhatever hardships she may now suffer are as likely to be removed\r\nwithout woman suffrage as they are with it. If she is being unfairly\r\ntreated, I think it will be found that she is so treated in common with\r\nall industrial workers--simply because she is a worker and not at all\r\nbecause she is a woman.\r\n\r\nAnd in taking this ground I am by no means forced to depend upon theory;\r\nfor, after all, the best answer to the dogma that the woman in industry\r\nneeds the ballot in order to obtain fair wages and fair working\r\nconditions is the fact that in states where women have voted anywhere\r\nfrom 4 to 46 years the laws for the working woman are no better than\r\nthey are in male suffrage states. Indeed, it is pretty generally agreed\r\nthat the states which have been first and most progressive in enacting\r\nlaws for the benefit of women and children in industry are states that\r\nhave refused to give women the vote.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true, as the suffragists so constantly tell us, that the\r\nonly states having eight-hour laws for women in industry are woman\r\nsuffrage states. But it is true, too, that the eight-hour laws of\r\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington, of which so much is heard, are not\r\nto be taken at their face value, since they do not cover the canning\r\nindustry, which is the chief industry in all those states. It is true,\r\nalso, that what is considered by experts the most advanced step in\r\nprotective legislation for women in industry, the prohibition of night\r\nwork, has been taken only in male suffrage states. In Massachusetts and\r\nNebraska the laws provide for a 54-hour week for women in industry,\r\nprovide for one day's rest in seven, and prohibit night work. Will any\r\none deny that these laws are infinitely better for women in industry\r\nthan the boasted eight-hour law of Colorado, under which it is\r\npermissible for a woman to work nights and Sundays and 56 hours a week?\r\n\r\nNow as to the question of \"fair wages.\" The suffragists tell us that\r\nwomen in industry are entitled to equal pay with men, and that this will\r\nfollow upon the heels of woman suffrage. Here again we have experience\r\nto guide us, and we find upon investigation that in no state has the\r\nratio between men's and women's wages been affected by doubling the\r\nelectorate. Dr. Helen Sumner, who made a thorough investigation of this\r\npoint, says in her book entitled _Equal Suffrage:_ \"Taking the public\r\nemployment as a whole, women in Colorado receive considerably less\r\nremuneration than men. It is the old story of supply and demand in the\r\ncommercial world, and suffrage has probably nothing to do with the wages\r\nof either men or women. The wages of men and women in all fields of\r\nindustry are governed by economic conditions.\"\r\n\r\nBy tables carefully compiled, Dr. Sumner shows that in Colorado, women\r\nin private employment receive an average of only 47 per cent of the\r\naverage of men's wages, while in the United States as a whole the\r\naverage for women is 55.3 per cent of the average for men, and in\r\nMassachusetts, where woman suffrage was recently defeated by nearly two\r\nto one in the largest vote in the state's history, women receive 62\r\ncents for every 100 cents paid to men in wages.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny, of course, that the wages of women in industry average\r\nconsiderably lower than those of men. But the reasons for this are found\r\nentirely outside of politics. The average girl is a transient in\r\nindustry, going into it as a temporary expedient to tide her over until\r\nshe attains her natural desire, which is to marry, settle down, and\r\nraise a family. She is, therefore, not so good an investment for her\r\nemployer as the boy who works beside her, who has gone into the business\r\nwith the idea of making it his life work, and who has a stronger\r\nincentive to make himself more valuable.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that employers of labor do not pay for men and\r\nwomen, but for results. Samuel Gompers, an ardent suffragist, says women\r\nget less because they ask for less. That is true in part. Women do ask\r\nfor less. One reason for this is that they look upon the job as\r\nsomething temporary. Another reason is, very frequently, that they are\r\nnot entirely dependent on their own earnings, but are partly supported\r\nin their parents' home. But in the majority of cases, the industrial\r\nwoman gets less than the industrial man because she is worth less, being\r\nnot only less experienced, but physically unable to compete with him on\r\na basis of absolute equality.\r\n\r\nIf the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of woman\r\nsuffrage is in its operation; and, when we find that it has failed to\r\nfulfill its promises where longest tried, it is hard to listen patiently\r\nto pleas for its further extension. The vote has never raised the wages\r\nor shortened the hours of men. It has never done it and can never do it\r\nfor women. The industrial woman can gain nothing by it. She will lose\r\nmuch, as will other women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA BUSINESS WOMAN'S VIEW OF SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\nEDITH MELVIN\r\n\r\n    _Miss Edith Melvin, educated in the public and private schools of\r\n    Concord and by her father, James Melvin, who, by reason of service\r\n    in the Civil War was a totally helpless invalid confined to his\r\n    bed for many years before his death, when he left a widow and\r\n    an only child dependent upon themselves for support. After three\r\n    months as assistant to the advertising manager of a large medicine\r\n    producing company, she entered the law office of Judge Prescott\r\n    Keyes without business training other than in stenography and\r\n    typewriting. In this law office has had more than twenty years\r\n    practical business and legal experience, a position of ever\r\n    increasing responsibilities requiring steady and efficient study\r\n    and thought. Not a member of the Bar, never having applied for\r\n    admission because not believing in women becoming lawyers. Has\r\n    served as President of the Guild of the First Parish (Concord)\r\n    and Secretary of the South Middlesex Federation of Young People's\r\n    Religious Unions. Is an experienced public speaker. Has been an\r\n    officer and active member of Old Concord Chapter, D. A. R. For\r\n    many years a householder and taxpayer._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter more than two decades spent in active business life, I am of the\r\nopinion that members of my sex do not need the ballot, and that it would\r\nbe a distinct and unnecessary encumbrance to them. For more than twenty\r\nyears, I regret to state, my life has been more that of a man than of a\r\nwoman. A home-supporter by the actual work of my hands and my brain,\r\nrather than a home-maker; my life has been past amid the heat and\r\nturmoil of business life, working shoulder to shoulder with men, pitting\r\nmy brain against the brains of men; and having no male relative to\r\nrepresent me in the business of the government, a taxpayer \"without\r\nrepresentation.\" That business life has been satisfactory to me in many\r\nways, I admit; but in order to wrest its satisfactions from the turmoil,\r\nI have been forced to summon up the determination, the endurance, the\r\nphysical and mental labor, which by all the laws of nature belong not to\r\nthe \"female of the species\" but to the male. Its successes have been\r\napparent successes when considered as parallel with man's work in the\r\nworld, but failures when one considers that not for the sharp, insistent\r\ncontact of business life was woman created. I still feel no desire to\r\nassist the male sex in the business of government, nor do I think I am\r\nfitted so to do. I desire to be permitted to continue my present freedom\r\nfrom political activities, and I am content to leave that part of life's\r\nwork in the hands of the sex which, to my mind, has managed it hitherto\r\nexceedingly well.\r\n\r\nI have never seen any point or place where the power to cast a ballot\r\nwould have been of the slightest help to me. For myself I should regard\r\nthe duties and responsibilities of thorough, well-informed, and faithful\r\nparticipation year after year in political matters as a very great\r\nmisfortune; even more of a misfortune than the certainty of being mixed\r\nup in the bitter strife, the falsifications, and publicity often\r\nattendant upon political campaigns. Though my work has trained me to use\r\nmy mind in matters pertaining to law and to business, it would certainly\r\nbe incumbent upon me to make a thorough study of the theory and practice\r\nof government before attempting to exercise the franchise. I feel sure\r\nthat the average business woman cannot make such a study or engage in\r\npolitics without interference not merely with her physical, but with her\r\nmental business life, which should command her constant and best\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMany women are now undertaking to engage in business, not as a\r\nlife-work, but as an incidental experience. It is true, however, that of\r\nthe many thousands of women so engaged, very, very few climb up the\r\nladder of success to the top rounds. It is the rare exception rather\r\nthan the rule for women to attain marked distinction, great wealth, or\r\nfame in the business world. This is not caused by any unfairness of the\r\nmale sex, but by the nature, the physical and mental limitations, of the\r\nmembers of the female sex. The trivialities of the afternoon tea are too\r\noften present in the work of the wage-earning woman--too often she has\r\ntoo slight a regard of her duty to return full value for the pecuniary\r\nconsideration she receives. The career of too many wage earning women is\r\nnow entirely haphazard, the result of necessity rather than\r\nwell-grounded choice. It is fair to assume that political matters would\r\nreceive the same degree of smattering knowledge and thought as is too\r\noften received by the daily occupation into which many women drift.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be deplored that the trend of some modern young women is\r\nmore towards the commercial life in which her success is doubtful,\r\nrather than toward the home-keeping, child-bearing, social, religious,\r\nand philanthropic life for which she was physically and mentally\r\ndesigned. These latter duties women faithfully and successfully perform\r\nas their natural function, and through them they may rise to the\r\ngreatest distinction. Femininity should be cherished by the woman whom\r\ncircumstance or necessity drives into the wage-earning world, and she\r\ncan cherish it by retaining her hold on social, religious, and\r\ncharitable interests; but she cannot hope to do so if she attends\r\npolitical meetings, serves on political committees, canvasses districts\r\nfor votes, watches at the polls, serves on juries, and debates political\r\nquestions or records and promises of political candidates. We have seen\r\nthe loss of femininity produced by the constant campaigning for\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe instability of the female mind is beyond the comprehension of the\r\nmajority of men. The charm, the \"sweet unreasonableness,\" the lack of\r\npower of consecutive thought upon any intricate problem, which mark the\r\naverage woman are sometimes attractive and in personal or family\r\nrelations not without compensating advantages. In the business world,\r\nhowever, these attributes are wholly detrimental. Business women might\r\npossibly bring to political matters such training and experience as they\r\nacquired, but to restrict the franchise to them would be to create a\r\nclass franchise. We must remember that suffrage would bring to the\r\nelectorate not merely the small number of business women, but the great\r\nmass of women who have had little or no experience of life outside of\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nIn brief, then, the voting privilege granted to women, and particularly\r\nto business women, would be a detriment to the women, and it would not\r\nbe of sufficient value to the government to outweigh the loss to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSOME PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE QUESTION\r\n\r\nELLEN MUDGE BURRILL\r\n\r\n    _Miss Ellen Mudge Burrill, educated in the Lynn public schools,\r\n    graduated from the Lynn Classical High School; now in the employ\r\n    of the Commonwealth as Cashier in the Sergeant-at-Arms Department;\r\n    Supervisor in the First Universalist Sunday School of Lynn; a\r\n    member of the Council of the Lynn Historical Society; author of\r\n    the \"State House Guide Book,\" \"Essex Trust Company of Lynn\" (the\r\n    successor of the Lynn Mechanics Bank,) \"The Burrill Family of Lynn\r\n    During the Colonial and Provincial Periods,\" and of \"Our Church\r\n    and the People Who Made Her,\" being a history of The First\r\n    Universalist Parish, Lynn._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf suffrage were a natural right, then women should have it, and at\r\nonce, but it is not like the right to have person and property\r\nprotected, which every man, woman and child already possesses. It is not\r\na natural right, but a means of government, and therefore a matter of\r\nexpediency. The question is, will government by the votes of men and\r\nwomen together produce better results than by men alone? Suffrage means\r\nmore than casting a ballot; if it means anything effectual, it means\r\nentering the field of politics. Had the proposed amendment been\r\nratified, it would have become the duty of all women to vote\r\nsystematically in all primary and regular elections. Would they have\r\ndone it in justifiable numbers?\r\n\r\nLook at Public Document No. 43, giving the number of assessed polls and\r\nregistered voters for the Massachusetts State election of 1914:\r\n\r\n  _Assessed Polls_\r\n  1,019,063\r\n\r\n  _Registered Voters_\r\n  610,667\r\n\r\n  _Persons Voting_\r\n  466,360\r\n\r\nAlso for the City and Town elections of 1914:\r\n\r\n  _Assessed Polls, Male_\r\n  1,229,641\r\n\r\n  _Registered Voters, Male_\r\n  740,871\r\n\r\n  _Males Who Voted_\r\n  532,241\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these figures that a larger proportion of men should\r\nfulfill their duty to the State. Government being one means to the end,\r\nof making better conditions, the indifference of so many thousand is\r\nbeyond comprehension, and is a serious menace to the Commonwealth. It\r\nwas Governor Curtis Guild who said: \"I base my anti-suffrage position on\r\nthe fact that our great failures in legislation are caused not so much\r\nby a vicious element among the voters, as by abstention from voting and\r\nemotional voting.\"\r\n\r\nThat granting the ballot to women would greatly increase the proportion\r\nof those who neglect to vote, is clearly shown by the results of giving\r\nwomen the school vote. In 1879 the Massachusetts Legislature, assuming\r\nthat women were peculiarly interested in school affairs, bestowed the\r\nschool franchise upon them. See how they have accepted that charge!\r\nAccording to the United States Census of 1910, there were 1,074,485\r\nwomen of voting age in this State. Of this number there are\r\napproximately 622,000 eligible to register and vote for School\r\nCommittee. Here is the School vote for 1914:\r\n\r\n  _Women Who Registered_\r\n  101,439\r\n\r\n  _Women Who Voted_\r\n  45,820\r\n\r\nHere is the school vote of the women for the city election in Lynn,\r\n1914:\r\n\r\n  Approximate number of women of voting age in Lynn      18,000\r\n  Total registration                                      1,759\r\n  Number of women who voted                               1,070\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet entitled, \"Women and the School Vote,\" Miss Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, trying to explain away the real meaning of the situation,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"A woman's name, once placed on the register, is now kept there until\r\nshe dies, moves or marries. When a town or city shows a large\r\nregistration of women and a small vote, it means that on some occasion,\r\nperhaps ten years ago, there was an exciting contest at the school\r\nelection, and many women registered and voted. When the contest was\r\nover, many of the women ceased to vote, but their names stayed on the\r\nregister.\"\r\n\r\nHer conclusion is that this is \"the simple explanation of the lessened\r\nproportion of women's votes to registration.\" But a more striking\r\nconclusion must be drawn, namely, that it isn't enough to vote when\r\nthere is an exciting contest; that it is only well as far as it goes,\r\nbut it should be kept up. The State has a right to expect it. In view of\r\ntheir actual record in the use of the school vote, I see no reason to\r\nthink that women would vote in sufficient numbers and with sufficient\r\nregularity to improve politics or government.\r\n\r\nThe effect of woman suffrage upon the tax rate must also be considered.\r\nIf the good to be gained were to justify the expense, there would be\r\nnothing to say; but if not, then we ought to pause to give certain facts\r\nsome thought. Take the expenses for the primary and state elections. The\r\ntotal cost to the Commonwealth in 1914, merely for the preparation,\r\nprinting, and shipping of ballots, was $50,046.17 (Auditor's Report,\r\n1914, page 240). I am informed that if women were given the ballot, a\r\nconservative estimate would add 50% to this figure. If women become\r\ncandidates for public office, there would be the further expense of\r\nhandling the nomination papers. And these calculable expenses are only a\r\nfraction of the total economic loss.\r\n\r\nThe City of Lynn has the second largest voting list in the state,\r\noutside of Boston. The expense now, for the state and city election\r\nmachinery and assistants, is $9,000 a year, in round numbers. The\r\namendment would entail nearly double the expenditure. There are 53\r\ncities and 320 towns in the state. Think it over before it is too late.\r\nThe financial side must enter into the problem some time; isn't the\r\npresent a good time?\r\n\r\nThe milk question was referred to several times in the recent campaign,\r\nthe suffragists implying that the Commonwealth was ignoring the need of\r\nlegislation and inspection. Here are some of the milk laws on our\r\nstatute books, that are administered by the State Department of Health:\r\n\r\nThe Revised Laws, Chapter 56, provide:\r\n\r\nPenalties for the sale of adulterated, diseased, or skimmed milk.\r\n\r\nPenalties for sale of milk not of good standard.\r\n\r\nFor the marking of skimmed milk.\r\n\r\nFor the marking of condensed milk.\r\n\r\nPenalty for using counterfeit seal or tampering with sample.\r\n\r\nPenalty for connivance or obstruction.\r\n\r\nFor the sending of results of analysis to dealer.\r\n\r\nThat inspectors must act on information and evidence.\r\n\r\nThe following acts are also in force:\r\n\r\nTo prohibit the misuse of vessels used in the sale of milk (Acts 1906,\r\nchapter 116).\r\n\r\nTo establish a standard for cream (Acts 1907, chapter 217).\r\n\r\nTo establish the standard of milk (Acts 1908, chapter 643).\r\n\r\nTo provide for the proper marking of heated milk (Acts 1908, chapter\r\n570).\r\n\r\nRelative to licensing dealers in milk (Acts 1909, chapter 443).\r\n\r\nTo provide for the appointment of inspectors and collectors of milk by\r\nBoards of Health (Acts 1909, chapter 405).\r\n\r\nRelative to the liability of producers of milk (Acts 1910, chapter 641).\r\n\r\nTo provide for the inspection and regulation of places where neat\r\ncattle, their ruminants or swine are kept (Acts 1911, chapter 381).\r\n\r\nTo authorize the incorporation of medical milk commissions (Acts 1911,\r\nchapter 506).\r\n\r\nRelative to the establishing of milk distributing stations in cities and\r\ncertain towns (Acts 1911, chapter 278).\r\n\r\nRelative to the labelling of evaporated, concentrated, or condensed milk\r\n(Acts 1911, chapter 610).\r\n\r\nTo regulate the use of utensils for testing the composition or value of\r\nmilk and cream (Acts 1912, chapter 218).\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the public health against unclean milk containers and\r\nappliances used in the treatment and mixing of milk (Acts 1913, chapter\r\n761). Relative to the production and sale of milk (Acts 1914, chapter\r\n744).\r\n\r\nTo prohibit charges for the inspection of live stock, dairies, or farm\r\nbuildings (Acts 1915, chapter 109).\r\n\r\nThe State is divided into eight health districts, with an inspector for\r\neach in the State employ. Each city has its board of health; each town\r\nadministers the laws through its selectmen. The City of Lynn has a\r\nboard of health; also health inspectors, who do much of their work\r\nbefore we are up--from 2 to 5 o'clock. They inspect all the milk\r\nstations; take samples from milk wagons; inspect dairies that sell milk\r\nin Lynn, wherever those dairies may be, even out of the State--as, for\r\ninstance, the Turner Centre Creamery in Maine. All that doesn't look as\r\nif the milk situation was being neglected.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts is doing a great deal for the children. There are over\r\n5,800 wards in the care of the State Minor Wards Department. I do not\r\nneed to tell you what a great work is being done for the care and\r\neducation of these little ones; it speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nOur opponents do not say much about the work women are doing on State\r\nBoards. There are plenty of positions already held by women who are\r\ndoing inconspicuous and unexciting work, yet, nevertheless, most useful\r\nto the Commonwealth. Here are some of them, with the number of women on\r\neach board:\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity was organized in 1879,\r\nwith 2 women on the board.\r\n\r\nThe work is now divided among different departments.\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Education had 1 woman member as far back as 1880; it\r\nnow has 2.\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Charity has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Free Public Library Commission has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Commission for the Blind has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Homestead Commission has 1.\r\n\r\nThe Minimum Wage Commission has 1.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Registration of Nurses has 3.\r\n\r\nThe Prison Commission has 2, who also serve on the Board of Parole for\r\nthe Reformatory for Women.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trustees of the State Infirmary and State Farm has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trustees of the Hospitals for Consumptives has 1.\r\n\r\nThe State Hospitals at Worcester, Taunton, Northampton, Danvers,\r\nWestboro, Medfield, Monson, Boston, Foxboro, have 2 each.\r\n\r\nThe Gardner State Colony has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Wrentham State School has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Training School Trustees has 2.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts General Hospital has 1.\r\n\r\nThe Perkins Institution for the Blind has 1.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital Cottages for Children has 1.\r\n\r\nHere are forty-five women doing voluntary work on these Boards, all\r\nappointed by the Governor and working under laws passed by the _men_ in\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\nTake another line. The manual of the labor laws enforced by the State\r\nBoard of Labor and Industries, covers the enforcement of the laws\r\nrelative to the education of minors, employment of minors, hours of\r\nlabor, apprenticeship, hours of labor for women, health inspection,\r\nlighting, ventilation, cleanliness, guarding against dangerous\r\nmachinery, work in tenement houses, etc.\r\n\r\nThe little book entitled \"Woman Suffrage, History, Arguments, Results,\"\r\ntells all about the suffrage states and gives the good laws that have\r\nbeen enacted since women voted. It gives the impression that none such\r\nare passed in male suffrage States. It has just two words about\r\nMassachusetts; under the heading of \"School Suffrage,\" it says,\r\n\"Massachusetts--1879.\" Under California, however, it gives a list of the\r\nfollowing laws and institutions:\r\n\r\n  Mothers' Pensions.\r\n  Minimum Wage.\r\n  Juvenile Court.\r\n  State Training School for Girls.\r\n  Teachers' Pension.\r\n  Weights and Measures.\r\n  Civil Service.\r\n  State Housing Commission.\r\n  Milk Inspection.\r\n  Tuberculosis.\r\n  Workingmen's Compensation\r\n  Psychopathic Parole.\r\n\r\nBut it carefully omits to mention that Massachusetts has all of these,\r\nthat some of them are much broader in scope, and that many are of longer\r\nyears standing.\r\n\r\nYou go into the Western States, and you find that legislation is\r\nconducted on a different basis from what it is in Massachusetts.\r\nAltogether too frequently, bills are pigeon-holed; the bills can't be\r\nreported out of committee unless the chairman consents; and the result\r\nis that many bills never see the light. Here in Massachusetts\r\nlaw-making is better managed. The number of bills presented is large;\r\n3,459 were printed during the session of 1914, and 2,802 were printed\r\nduring the last session. Some of these were offered by women. A woman,\r\nas well as a man, can petition the Legislature. Every bill is referred\r\nto a committee; it is given a public hearing, is reported upon and\r\naction taken, one way or another; not one bill is pigeon-holed. The\r\nMassachusetts system of legislative procedure is not surpassed anywhere\r\nin the United States, and there are competent boards and officers who\r\ncarry out the various laws. Many of the things the suffragists agitate\r\nabout and think they need the franchise to bring to pass, they would\r\nfind are already being administered at the present time if they would\r\nonly look into the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHOW MASSACHUSETTS FOSTERS PUBLIC WELFARE\r\n\r\nMONICA FOLEY\r\n\r\n    _Miss Monica Foley, was educated in the Boston schools, graduating\r\n    from the Boston Academy of Notre Dame; is a member of the\r\n    Massachusetts Bar and Secretary of the Massachusetts Association\r\n    of Women Lawyers. She is a director of the Notre Dame Alumni\r\n    Association of Boston, and is connected with the State Commission\r\n    on Economy and Efficiency._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the suffrage campaign just closed so much was heard of the\r\ngreatness of some of our states, including Utah and Nevada, Colorado\r\nand Wyoming, that one was tempted to inquire, \"Is there no good now in\r\nMassachusetts?\" It seemed passing strange that our Commonwealth, which\r\nhad always been the leader in every great turning point of the policy of\r\nthe nation, should have so signally failed that it ceased to exist as a\r\nmodel to be extolled; it was stranger still that her worthy record was\r\nignored by her own sons and daughters. And yet the facts are that while\r\nwe may hold high in memory the examples of those who have gone before\r\nus, we may also rejoice that the men of our own time not only uphold\r\nthe best ideals and lofty purposes of our State, but are day by day\r\nworking out her problems in such a way that her position is still secure\r\nas a pioneer in sane legislation, her laws are still models for all\r\nstates (particularly woman suffrage states) her name is still cherished\r\nin the wildernesses where her sons are pioneers, still venerated on her\r\nown soil where her people stand at the gateways and welcome the\r\noppressed.\r\n\r\nProud as we are of her traditions, glorying as we do in her present\r\nachievements, we are unafraid that the future will see her fall from her\r\neminence, from the dignity which has always characterized her statehood\r\nand made her name a synonym for the best in government in the nation,\r\nour Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWhile this paper deals almost wholly with the executive functions of the\r\nstate, to make no mention of our judiciary would be to omit reference to\r\none of the brightest pages of our history. Massachusetts law and\r\nMassachusetts judiciary decisions have always been and are now quoted\r\nand respected in the greatest courts of the country. This splendid\r\nsystem is being maintained at an annual cost exceeding $600,000.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with the establishment of a great judiciary system,\r\nMassachusetts has devoted herself to the highest ideals of human\r\ncharity, and her enormous expenditures show that selfish materialism\r\nplays no part in her legislation. Year by year the calls for charity are\r\nmore insistent, and year by year the State responds more generously.\r\nThe State Board of Charity was first organized in 1863, and at the\r\npresent time is an unpaid board of nine members, two of whom are women.\r\nThe institutions under their supervision are governed by unpaid boards\r\nof seven members, two of whom are women, this latter being provided by\r\nlaw, except in the instance noted below. The institutions under the\r\nsupervision of the board are the State Infirmary for the sick poor at\r\nTewksbury, and the State Farm at Bridgewater for misdemeanants and\r\ninsane criminals, both opened in 1854 and costing the state nearly\r\n$1,000,000 annually. The training schools for delinquent children are\r\nthe Lyman School for Boys at Westborough (1848) and the Industrial\r\nSchool for Boys at Shirley (1909) and for Girls at Lancaster (1856)\r\ncosting over $300,000 annually. The hospitals for consumptives are\r\nlocated at Rutland (1898), North Reading (1909), Lakeville and\r\nWestfield, both the latter being opened in 1910. Upon these suffering\r\npoor the State spends over a half million dollars each year. The Norfolk\r\nState Hospital at Walpole was opened in 1911 for inebriates and drug\r\nhabitues. There are no women on this board of trustees, there being no\r\nwomen inmates of the hospital. There has also been located at Canton\r\nsince 1907 a Hospital School for crippled children. A hospital for\r\nlepers has been maintained at Penikese Island since 1905.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the Board of Charity, aid is given mothers with\r\ndependent children, the support of poor babies is undertaken, and the\r\ntuition of poor children is paid. The board places the children in\r\nhomes wherever possible--institutional life being approved only when\r\nnecessary. Certain suffragists (of the Socialist persuasion) would give\r\nthe children to the State under the new order. In 1914 the Board\r\ntogether with the institutions under their direction expended over three\r\nmillion dollars and cared for more than 7000 persons in the institutions\r\nalone. Is there anything here in the State's charity work which would\r\nmake any woman other than proud of its record?\r\n\r\nThe State's care of her insane is under the direction of a paid board of\r\nthree members, each hospital having a board of seven unpaid trustees,\r\nincluding two women. The hospitals for the insane are at Worcester\r\n(1833), Boston (Dorchester, 1839), Taunton (1854), Northampton (1858),\r\nDanvers (1878), Westborough (1886), Foxboro (1893) and Medford (1896),\r\nGardner (1902.) There is a hospital for epileptics at Monson with\r\nschools for the feeble-minded at Waltham (1848), with a colony at\r\nTempleton since 1900 and a school at Wrentham (1907). In 1914 the State\r\ncared for over 14,000 of these unfortunates and expended over three and\r\none-quarter millions of dollars for their maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe reformatory and correctional work of the Commonwealth (other than\r\nexercised over the training schools) is under the direction of a board\r\nof five prison commissioners (two women), only the chairman being paid.\r\nFour institutions comprise this group; the State Prison at Charlestown\r\nsince 1805, but first established in 1785; the Reformatory at Concord\r\n(1884); the Women's Reformatory at Sherborn (1877); and the Prison Camp\r\nand Hospital at West Rutland, the camp being opened in 1904, the\r\nhospital in 1907. Massachusetts has the distinction of being the first\r\nstate in the union to separate its women offenders from the men, by\r\nestablishing the Sherborn Reformatory. No child is born at this\r\ninstitution. A mere man a few years ago, realizing the needless handicap\r\nan innocent child would suffer through life if born in a prison,\r\npetitioned the legislature to prevent the possibility. A law accordingly\r\nwas passed, and these unfortunate women are placed in a state hospital\r\nuntil after their children are born. In 1914 over 1500 persons were\r\ncared for in our prisons at a cost of more than a half million dollars.\r\nTwo boards of parole now study the histories of prisoners and recommend\r\ncertain persons for parole, the men's board in addition recommends\r\npersons to be pardoned to the governor and council.\r\n\r\nIn no other sphere of the State's activities is the great throbbing\r\nheart of the Commonwealth shown with such poignant fervor as in the case\r\nof her unfortunates, and this phase of her work alone would entitle her\r\nto the homage of all our people--but she does not stop here. She\r\ndominates the educational field, and stands preeminent before the nation\r\nand the world for the superiority of her educational institutions.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts has given abundantly to the great university at Cambridge,\r\nstill endows freely the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and gives\r\nannually of her funds to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the\r\nTextile Schools at New Bedford, Lowell, and Fall River, and other\r\nindependent industrial schools. She practically maintains the\r\nAgricultural College at Amherst, and gives to other agricultural\r\nschools, and also aids certain cities and small towns.\r\n\r\nIn aiding the deaf, dumb, and blind in 1914, Massachusetts spent over\r\n$200,000. In 1891 she opened a nautical school to train her young men in\r\nseamanship, navigation, and marine engineering. In 1839 Massachusetts\r\nfounded the first Normal school in this country, and today ten of these\r\nschools are open throughout the State. In this line of endeavor in 1914\r\nthe State expended over one and one-half millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth maintains a Department of Health, established in 1869,\r\nexpending in 1914 over $350,000. In Massachusetts also was passed the\r\nfirst pure food law in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Water Works have cost the State since 1901 over\r\n$50,000,000. Our park system is one of the finest in the world, and is\r\nmaintained at an annual cost of over half a million dollars. In addition\r\nto the parks in the Metropolitan District, there are six other\r\nreservations throughout the State. These parks represent an outlay of\r\nover $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nOur Homestead Commission was established to investigate defective\r\nhousing conditions and study building and tenement house laws. Its\r\nmembers are unpaid, though the labor representative is reimbursed for\r\nany loss he may suffer from absence from his regular occupation.\r\n\r\nIt can truly be said that no State in the union shows such grateful and\r\nworthy appreciation to its veterans as does Massachusetts. In 1914 over\r\n$700,000 was given to the veterans of our Civil War and to certain of\r\ntheir dependent relatives, and to women army nurses. Under a special\r\ngratuities act of 1912 she gave each living veteran of the war the sum\r\nof $125, this one act alone costing over $500,000.\r\n\r\nAmong other of her good works, she appropriates each year $15,000 for\r\nthe relief of injured firemen and families of firemen killed in the\r\nperformance of their duty, and since the fund was established has\r\nexpended $270,000 for this work. The State also provides under a\r\ncontributory system for its employes.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the country are the people's savings and insurance more\r\nzealously guarded than by Massachusetts, and here again she is leading\r\nthe way in the savings bank life insurance legislation. The bank\r\ncommission was established in 1838, the insurance commission in 1855,\r\nthe savings bank life insurance board in 1907, these three departments\r\ncosting in 1914 almost $200,000.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with her labor problems Massachusetts maintains a Department\r\nof Labor and Industries (1913) which investigates industrial conditions\r\nand enforces the labor laws; an Industrial Accident Board (1912) which\r\nenforces law compensating injured employes. These two boards together\r\nconstitute a joint board for the prevention of industrial accidents and\r\ndiseases. There is also a Board of Conciliation and Arbitration (1886)\r\nwhich mediates and arbitrates industrial disputes, and a Minimum Wage\r\nCommission (the first in the country), which investigates the wages of\r\nwomen and minors, and forms boards to recommend scales of wages in low\r\npaid industries. Over $200,000 was expended by these boards in 1914.\r\n\r\nOn encouraging farming and caring for her forests, fisheries, and game,\r\nwas spent over $600,000 in 1914. This was distributed in many ways, some\r\nbeing in form of bounties to children and youths, to agricultural\r\nsocieties to encourage orcharding, poultry raising, for the purchase of\r\nforest lands, the prevention of forest fires, the propagation of wild\r\nbirds and animals.\r\n\r\nPreparedness was not overlooked, over half a million dollars being\r\nexpended on the militia in 1914. On highways and harbors nearly a\r\nmillion dollars was spent.\r\n\r\nOver a million and a quarter dollars was spent on public buildings, the\r\ntotal valuation of state properties being over $8,300,000, the State\r\ncapitol and land itself being valued at over five and one-half million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThis is the record of Massachusetts. The suffragists have shown wisdom\r\nin avoiding reference to these facts. They could not well do otherwise,\r\nhowever, since they are allied with those detestable groups in our midst\r\nwho are preaching anarchy and revolution as a means to better\r\ngovernment. Better government where? This record is one that the men of\r\nthe State may well be proud of; it is a record that its women will\r\ncontinue to make possible by their non-partisan influence in government,\r\nby the training of its future citizens, by the teaching of those lessons\r\nof civic honesty and uprightness that make for national integrity as\r\nexemplified in the history of our Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS COMPARED WITH SUFFRAGE STATES\r\n\r\nCATHERINE ROBINSON\r\n\r\n    _Miss Catherine Robinson was a student at Radcliffe in 1911;\r\n    graduated from Miss Wheelock's Kindergarten Training School in\r\n    1915; has worked two winters among the children in the cotton\r\n    mills of Georgia, and has been affiliated with Neighborhood\r\n    House in East Boston, and with the Associated Charities in the\r\n    Co-operative Workrooms. She is now connected with the Social\r\n    Service Department of the Massachusetts General Hospital, her work\r\n    being in the Orthopaedic Clinic for Children. Miss Robinson was\r\n    formerly a suffragist, but after studying the question decided\r\n    that the suffragists' claims are illusions which never become\r\n    realities. She says: \"Everything I do along these lines (Social\r\n    Service) convinces me more than ever what a detriment the vote\r\n    would be to our sex.\"_\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long ago I heard Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, the President of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, say at Springfield:\r\n\r\n\"Laws have nothing to do with this question of woman suffrage; facts\r\nhave nothing to do with it. I shall not answer facts. We do not promise\r\nto do great things for women; why should we? All we ask is the right to\r\nvote.\"\r\n\r\nAll suffrage speakers are not so frank about their inability to answer\r\nfacts as Dr. Shaw is, nor do they cease from claiming that good laws for\r\nwomen exist chiefly in suffrage states.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts gives to her women the best protection of any state in the\r\nUnion. In January, 1915, New York ranked first, but since our\r\nlegislative enactments of 1915, Massachusetts is again in the lead. We\r\nhave, in the first place, the Maternity Act. Then we have the law\r\nprohibiting women in industry from working more than fifty-four hours\r\nper week. We have the absolute prohibition of night-work for our women\r\nin textile, mercantile, and manufacturing establishments. We are one of\r\nthe five states in the Union to have such a law. All the five states are\r\nmale suffrage states. Not a single woman suffrage state prohibits the\r\nnight employment of its women; and yet among the laws safeguarding the\r\nhealth of women workers, the prohibition of night work is of the most\r\nfundamental importance.\r\n\r\nSome women suffrage states do not even set a limit to the hours a woman\r\nmay work. In Wyoming, Nevada, and Kansas--all woman suffrage states, you\r\nnote--there is no limitation of hours of labor and no prohibition of\r\nnight work. Some one may say that Colorado, California, Oregon and\r\nWashington have an eight-hour limitation. They have; but in each case\r\nthe canneries are excepted, so that in those states where the cannery\r\nbusiness is of vast importance, the women therein employed may work any\r\nnumber of hours and any time of the day or night. Not long ago in New\r\nYork a similar law was proposed, allowing women and children to work\r\nseventy-two hours a week in canneries, but the bill was defeated.\r\nColorado, to be sure, has the eight-hour law, but it does not prohibit\r\nnight work for women, so that the eight hours can be at night; neither\r\ndoes Colorado require one day of rest in every seven. In Massachusetts\r\nand New York there is a law specifically requiring one day of rest in\r\nevery seven for employees in factories, workshops, and all mercantile\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which we can protect women is by early closing hours, and\r\nprohibition of work before a certain hour in the morning. Again we find\r\nthat it is in the male suffrage states that women have acquired such\r\nprotection, for New York sets an early closing hour of 5 p. m. for her\r\nwomen in factories, mercantile, and manufacturing establishments, and\r\nMassachusetts sets 6 p. m. Fourteen other male suffrage states set 10\r\np. m. as the closing hour; and all these states prohibit work before 6\r\na. m. What do we find in the woman suffrage states? Simply that out of\r\nthe eleven suffrage states, one state, California, sets a 10 p. m.\r\nlimit, but it does not apply to canneries.\r\n\r\nAs women enter further into the industrial field, more and more laws are\r\nmade for their protection. The men have done wonderfully for our women.\r\nWhenever the public conscience is aroused to the need of a law, that\r\nlaw is passed. Women do much, in fact, nearly everything, towards\r\narousing that public conscience, but we find when we study the laws as\r\nthey exist in our state that our men have made better laws for the\r\nprotection of our women than the men and women have made together in any\r\nsuffrage state. Let me add some of the other good laws we have in\r\nMassachusetts. We have the Mothers' Pension Bill. This law was\r\noriginated by a man in a male suffrage state. We have the Equal\r\nGuardianship Law. There are suffrage states where neither of these laws\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nNot long ago Mrs. Maud Wood Park, asserted that I was misstating the\r\nlaws in suffrage states. She said I did not know the happenings in the\r\nlegislature this year. I have made a careful study of the laws proposed\r\nand the action taken upon them in the eleven suffrage states and the\r\nfour big \"campaign states\" in the legislative year of 1915. I find that\r\nwhile in Massachusetts we enacted _five_ new laws relating to our women\r\nand children assuring them of still greater protection and better public\r\nhealth regulations, Arizona turned down five laws for women which\r\nalready exist here in our own state. I was unable to find any suffrage\r\nstate which could compare in any favorable way with the progress\r\nMassachusetts has made. Wyoming turned down a bill regulating the\r\nemployment of children and a bill limiting the hours a woman may work.\r\nAs long as I have mentioned Arizona, let me continue the comparison one\r\nstep further and point out that on the 16th of February, 1915, Mrs.\r\nBerry, an Arizona suffragist, introduced a bill regulating and granting\r\nteachers' pensions. The bill was indefinitely postponed. In the same\r\nyear Massachusetts women teachers introduced a bill asking to have their\r\nformer pensions granted again to them. At the same time the men teachers\r\nintroduced a similar bill; and it is an interesting fact that the men\r\nwere turned down, while the women's bill was signed by the Governor. For\r\nour suffrage friends who say that women must have the ballot to be\r\nlistened to, this is rather a stumbling block. I happened to be up at\r\nthe State House the day the bill went through, and heard one of the\r\nwomen who was interested say: \"It's a mighty lucky thing we women did\r\n_not_ have the vote.\" This is the latest example of what Massachusetts\r\nmen are interested in doing for Massachusetts women. Let us voice our\r\njust pride that Massachusetts touches the high water mark of protective\r\nlegislation and stands as an example to all other states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE AND WAR\r\n\r\nMRS.

They remind me of the mad\r\nphilosopher who suggested it would be well to profit by an eruption of\r\nVesuvius in order to boil an egg.\r\n\r\nThe incongruity of suffragists attempting to pose as a peace party is\r\nobvious to anyone with a memory and a sense of humor. Before the war\r\nbroke out, American suffrage leaders were applauding, feasting, and\r\nsubsidizing the British virago who instigated the setting on fire of 146\r\npublic buildings, churches, and houses, the explosion of 43 bombs, the\r\ndestruction of property valued at nearly two million dollars (not\r\nincluding priceless works of arts), and many cases of personal assault.\r\nIn 1912 they justified the destruction of the Rokeby Venus; in 1914 they\r\nprofessed horror at the bombardment of the Cathedral of Rheims. Is this\r\ninsincerity or hypocrisy, or mere aberration of mind?\r\n\r\nThe best time to work for peace is before war breaks out. The suffrage\r\norganization was not conspicuous in seizing the many opportunities for\r\nfurthering the cause of peace before it was too late. In 1911 Mrs.\r\nFrederick Nathan, a prominent suffragist, was asked to contribute to the\r\nAmerican Society for the Judicial Settlement of Disputes. She sent the\r\nfollowing characteristic refusal:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Frederick Nathan prefers to give her money to the Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.... She has no faith in Courts of Law and Equity which deny\r\njustice to women.\"\r\n\r\nWas this boycotting of the peace movement condemned by the suffragists?\r\nNot at all; Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, President of the Massachusetts\r\nSuffrage Association, was glad to print the refusal in the official\r\norgan of the National Woman Suffrage Association. Miss Blackwell, in\r\nholding up this example to its members, scornfully declared that several\r\nof the peace society were \"prominent opponents of equal rights for\r\nwomen.\" In those days, the suffragists were not hitching their wagon to\r\nthe quiet star of peace; it has been their constant practice to attach\r\nthemselves, for publicity's sake, to whatever movement is conspicuous on\r\nthe front pages of the newspapers--eugenics, or sex drama, or red-light\r\nabatement, or what not--and to abandon that ephemeral interest whenever\r\nit has ceased to serve the purpose of advertisement.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when the war broke out, the boycotters of peace societies, and\r\ncolleagues of militants, made a rapid shift of costumes, and tried to\r\nplay roles in the Woman's Peace Party. So hurried was their change of\r\nmental attitude that their thoughts on the subject were splendid\r\ninstances of snap judgment.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the breaking out of the war was most embarassing to them. Like\r\na bull in a china shop, the rush of brutal fact destroyed many of their\r\npretty theories. The stereotyped suffrage answer, when anti-suffragists\r\npointed out that physical force was the fundamental basis of government,\r\nhad been that this was no longer true. For example, Dr. Mary Putnam\r\nJacobs, speaking of women's demand for the ballot, said, about 1895:\r\n\"Women could not claim the ballot while it was necessary to defend\r\nopinions by arms, but this is no longer necessary or expected.\" And Mrs.\r\nSusan Fitzgerald in 1912 declared: \"The age of the fighting man is\r\npassing. The world is coming to be ruled by intellect.\" When will the\r\nsuffragists learn Lowell's maxim: \"Don't never prophesy--onless ye\r\nknow!\" It is, however, a characteristic of professional false prophets\r\nnot to lose their imperturbality and effrontery, but to trust that their\r\nfollowers will forget their mistaken guesses and listen open-mouthed to\r\na new dispensation.\r\n\r\nThe essential dogma of the Woman's Peace Party (none but suffragists\r\nadmitted!) was that the adoption of woman suffrage was a necessary and\r\neffectual step toward abolishing war. \"If women had had the vote in all\r\ncountries now at war,\" said Mrs. Catt, \"the conflict would have been\r\nprevented.\" History shows women at least as much inclined to war as\r\nmen--a fact illustrated in the French Revolution, in our Civil War, in\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, and in other instances too numerous\r\nto mention. The suffragists, ignorant of that fact, or ignoring it,\r\nadvanced in support of their proposition a series of specious arguments\r\ndesigned to catch popular opinion. Of these arguments two were at the\r\noutset of the movement especially harped upon: (1) the alleged\r\n\"international solidarity of women,\" and (2) the supposed likelihood of\r\nwoman's opposition to militarism.\r\n\r\nWhat was meant by the \"solidarity of women\" is explained in Mrs. Pethick\r\nLawrence's words: \"The interests of women, being fundamentally the same,\r\nare so universal that no national distinctions can cut deeply into them,\r\nas may possibly sometimes happen with the national distinctions between\r\nmen.\" Following that notion, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw issued an appeal to\r\nthe women's organizations in the belligerent countries, urging them to\r\nput a stop to the war. The replies received showed that the expected\r\n\"international solidarity of women\" was imaginary. The Association of\r\nAustrian Women's Clubs, for example, replied that nobody understanding\r\nthe causes of the war, would have addressed such a request to them.\r\n\"Being women of those countries,\" ran this reply, \"where our husbands,\r\nbrothers, and sons are fighting for the existence or non-existence of\r\nour state, for our homes, for their wives and children, we cannot say:\r\n'Do not fight'!\" Similarly, the women's societies of France refused to\r\naccept any invitations to peace palavers. In short, the real\r\n\"solidarity\" was discovered to exist, not between women of different\r\nnations, but between the women and the men of each nation.\r\n\r\nThe falsity of the other argument--that woman suffrage would tend\r\nagainst militarism--was crushingly refuted when Dr. Ernest Bernbaum drew\r\nattention to the recent history of militaristic policies in England and\r\nAustralia. In male suffrage England, Lord Roberts, despite his personal\r\npopularity and strong arguments, was unable to get sufficient support\r\nfor his program of universal military service. In woman suffrage\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, on the other hand, the same line of arguments\r\nwas completely successful by 1911. There, boys from their twelfth year\r\nare required to be enrolled for instruction in drill and the rudiments\r\nof military science. The penalties for failure are severe, and public\r\nopinion supports their enforcement; in New Zealand a boy was sent to\r\njail for refusing service, on ground of conscientious scruples; another\r\nwas fined and went into exile. The electorate was determined that New\r\nZealand and Australia should be nations in arms; indeed they were more\r\ndrastic than Germany, where many exemptions from military service on\r\nvarious grounds are allowed. It is instructive to recall that when in\r\nMarch, 1914, Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admiralty, advised Australia\r\nthat, in view of the Japanese alliance, it did not need to spend as much\r\nmoney on warships, the Australian statesmen frankly intimating their\r\ndistrust in alliances, declared they would proceed with their expensive\r\nnaval program, which was supported by both political parties. I do not\r\nsay that what is termed \"militarism\" is a bad policy; I do say that when\r\nthe suffragists state that woman suffrage tends against militarism they\r\nstate what is diametrically opposed to the real truth of history. In\r\nthis case, as usual, they draw their principles not from observation of\r\nwhat is happening but from what they wish and fancy would happen.\r\n\r\nThe theories of the Suffrage Woman's Peace Party being false, it is not\r\nsurprising that their actions prove bewilderingly futile. They brought\r\ntogether a group of \"hand-picked\" delegates, quite unrepresentative of\r\nthe real sentiment of the nations they were nominally representing, and\r\nforgathered in a so-called Woman's Peace Conference at the Hague. Miss\r\nJane Addams supplied the American press with rose-colored accounts of\r\nits proceedings. Her reports were justly condemned by the New York Times\r\nas bad journalism, because they did not \"tell the whole of the truth.\"\r\nThey were calculated to give the impression that the Conference was\r\nharmonious, and that its deliberations led to really practicable\r\nconclusions. Not to conceal the truth, it must be said, that these\r\npacific ladies, who surely ought in their own circle to have exhibited\r\nthat \"international solidarity\" which the sex as a whole had failed to\r\nmanifest, soon developed sharp antipathies. One of the few British\r\ndelegates who went to the conference (need it be said she was not Mrs.\r\nPankhurst?) disturbed its complacency by reminding those present that\r\nthey really did not represent the sentiments of the warring nations.\r\nWhen it came to discussing the actual situation and specific terms of\r\npeace, there arose strong differences of opinion--along national lines.\r\nThe chief resolution offered,--that peace should be made without\r\ndelay,--could not be passed until an amendment, adding the words \"with\r\njustice,\" was accepted,--words which each belligerent would interpret in\r\na different manner. Needless to say, the amendment rendered the\r\nhigh-sounding resolution a useless mass of ambiguous words.\r\n\r\nEqually futile were the subsequent travels of the delegates of the\r\nWoman's Peace Party. At a time when the energy and money of every woman\r\nshould have been whole-heartedly devoted to practical deeds of charity,\r\nthese misguided women wasted their means and strength in fool's journeys\r\nto the capitals of all the great nations. They made proposals for\r\nimmediate peace negotiations, which were listened to with more patience\r\nand politeness than their amateurish character deserved, but which were\r\nof course without exception pigeon-holed.\r\n\r\nHaving moved the nations to mirth by one modern version of \"Innocents\r\nAbroad,\" the suffragists appear to have thought it a good advertisement\r\nto send forth a second. This time they attempted to screen themselves\r\nbehind the figure of Mr. Henry Ford, wearing a celluloid button, \"Out of\r\nthe Trenches by Christmas!\" But when a man acts with apparently\r\ninexplicable foolishness, it is generally safe to say, \"_Cherchez la\r\nfemme!_\" In this case, the truth presently came out: the unfortunate Mr.\r\nFord was merely the \"angel\" of the new travelling troupe. It was Mme.\r\nSchimmer, professional suffragist-pacificist, who had persuaded him to\r\nlaunch his argosy. As Mr. Ford himself confessed on his ignominious\r\nreturn, he was \"simply backing up and financing the plans of the Woman's\r\nPeace Congress.\" The second expedition, like the first, developed an\r\nastounding fighting spirit among the peace delegates, and accomplished\r\nnothing. (It is worth noting that woman-suffrage Denmark prohibited the\r\nparty from holding any public meetings.)\r\n\r\nThere is a lamentable as well as ridiculous aspect of the suffragists'\r\nactivity in connection with the peace movement. Their intrusion into the\r\npacificist camp has brought discredit not only upon themselves, but upon\r\nevery pacificist. If the word \"pacificist\" today suggests to most men an\r\necstatic, irresponsible dreamer, it is they who are to blame. The sane\r\npacificist, whose patient labors are directed toward unsensational and\r\nunspectacular, slow but sure, organization of friendly relations to be\r\ngradually made closer and closer, realizes that his task is a\r\ncomplicated one, not to be solved by emotionalism, but by calm\r\nreasoning and patient adjustment. He realizes that many different\r\nfunctions must be brought into co-operation before the likelihood of war\r\ncan be reduced. His noble work is in danger of being thought ridiculous\r\nbecause of the meddling of suffrage fanatics.\r\n\r\nThe present war, instead of justifying the suffragist theory, has\r\nrefuted it. It has vindicated the position of the anti-suffragists.\r\n\r\nWhat is the chief lesson of the great war? It has shown that\r\ninternational law and treaties are so weak as to be useless, unless\r\nthere is physical force to ensure their not being violated. What\r\nanti-suffragists have always maintained in national government has\r\nproved true in international relations. Any law that is made by those\r\nunable to support it through force of arms will sooner or later become a\r\n\"scrap of paper.\" Consequently the most sanely progressive step in the\r\npeace movement is the formation by men like Mr. Taft, and Mr. A.\r\nLawrence Lowell, (both anti-suffragists, by the way) of a league to\r\nenforce peace, which aims to give international law the sanction not\r\nonly of world-wide opinion, but of the irresistible power of the united\r\narmed forces of the great nations. That is the work of men toward world\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nWhat is the work of women? In this field as in all others, it is not to\r\ntry to compel, but to educate and civilize, to create in the children\r\ncommitted to her care an intelligent love for fair play, justice, and\r\nself-control. The suffragist is an enemy to the diffusion of the peace\r\nspirit, because she would force women into political warfare, where\r\ncontention is bred. She closes her eyes to woman's greatest opportunity\r\nfor diminishing the spirit of belligerency--that of keeping one of the\r\nsexes out of the bitter strife of partisan politics. The\r\nanti-suffragist, asking that the mothers of men may be left free to\r\ndevelop the milder attributes of character, has the true vision of the\r\nroad that leads to lasting peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE VS. WOMANLINESS\r\n\r\nMRS. THOMAS ALLEN\r\n\r\n    _Alice Ranney Allen, wife of Thomas Allen; member of the\r\n    Woman's Municipal League, in which she was the organizer of the\r\n    Department of Streets and Alleys; member of the Woman's Education\r\n    Association; reader of the Committee on Selection of Fiction for\r\n    Libraries; Chairman of Boston Committee on the work of District\r\n    Nursing in the mountains of North Carolina; a well-known speaker\r\n    against woman suffrage._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me the chief reason why political duties should not be imposed on\r\nwomen is the effect that this preliminary dip into politics, this\r\nstruggle for votes-for-women, is having on the women themselves. It is\r\nsurely not making them any more lovely, or pleasant in their lives. They\r\ngrow bitter, aggressive, and antagonistic, liking the excitement of\r\ncampaigning and finding their natural, proper duties \"flat, stale, and\r\nunprofitable.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking from platforms and being constantly in the public eye, does not\r\nimprove women. We anti-suffragists have taken part in a political\r\ncampaign to keep ourselves out of politics for the rest of our lives,\r\nand to keep our daughters out of politics, but we know that in a proper\r\ndivision of duty we have better work to do along civic, sanitary, and\r\nphilanthropic lines, and in our homes, than to be, as our Western\r\nsisters are, out campaigning for candidates, and engaged in struggles\r\nfor political supremacy.\r\n\r\nAnyone may gauge the bitterness of the recent campaign if he remembers\r\nthe abuse heaped on the anti-suffragists by the President of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association; and we must judge every movement by its\r\nleaders. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, at a hearing before the Senate Committee\r\nat Washington, said:\r\n\r\n\"We are not afraid of the body of women who are going up and down the\r\nland opposing suffrage. They are just enough in number so that by\r\nholding out their skirts they can make a screen for the men operating\r\ndens of vice and iniquity and prostitution to hide behind.\"\r\n\r\nIn an interview printed in the New York Sun, Dr. Shaw referred to the\r\nanti-suffrage leaders as \"vultures looking for carrion.\"\r\n\r\nAs important a person as Dean Thomas, of Bryn Mawr College, in an appeal\r\nfor funds for the National American Woman Suffrage Association in\r\nFebruary, 1913, said:\r\n\r\n\"The ballot for women is the greatest of all the modern reforms. We urge\r\nthose who are today contributing to other causes to _withdraw_ or\r\n_curtail_ their contributions until the ballot for woman is secured.\"\r\nThis seems to us anti-suffragists extremely narrow, as we know that\r\nwoman suffrage is not a reform, but an experiment in legislation only.\r\n\r\nIn a public resolution passed by the New England Women's Suffrage\r\nAssociation at its forty-seventh annual meeting, the anti-suffragists\r\nwere referred to as using \"pole-cat\" tactics--why, we do not know. These\r\nare only a few of the many evidences of the bitterness of feeling in\r\nthis political campaign.\r\n\r\nThe whole ideal of womanhood seems to be changing. The wife of an editor\r\nof our most important New England magazine said to me:\r\n\r\n\"What use is it for you to oppose the suffrage movement, when it is only\r\nthe first step in this larger movement for the emancipation of women\r\nthat is sweeping over the world?\" And I said: \"Then we will do our best\r\nto stop the first step,\" for I remembered the doctrines of the suffrage\r\nleaders preached from their platforms. Mrs. Ida Husted Harper has said:\r\n\"There is not a single forward step of woman that has not been blocked\r\nby the words 'wifehood' and 'motherhood'.\"\r\n\r\nDean Thomas, in an address to women at Mount Holyoke College, is quoted\r\nin Mr. Martin's book, _The Unrest of Women_, as saying: \"Women may have\r\nspent half a lifetime in fitting themselves for a scholar's work, and\r\nthen may be asked to choose between it and marriage. No one can estimate\r\nthe number of women who remain unmarried in revolt before such a\r\nhorrible alternative.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Stanton Coit is reported as saying from a suffrage platform:\r\n\"Wifehood has all the characteristics of slavery--work without wage; no\r\nspecified hours; no right to change employers.\"\r\n\r\nWe find constantly the evil influence that this first step of suffrage\r\nis having on the young women of our day; and, to me, the gist of the\r\nwhole matter seems summed up in a paragraph from a pamphlet written by\r\nMr. Joseph Pyle:\r\n\r\n\"With Christianity there came into the world a new example and a new\r\nthought. To woman's whole nature appealed that life of self-sacrifice,\r\nof love, and of willing service that has created a new Heaven and a new\r\nearth. From the foot of the Cross there arose and went out into the\r\nworld a womanhood that did not demand, or claim, or threaten, or\r\narrogate; a womanhood renouncing, yielding, loving, and, therefore,\r\nconquering. For twenty centuries that has been the law of woman's life.\r\nIt is sneered at and rejected today by the clamorous, but it has made of\r\nwoman what we now find her. You see it in your mothers, your daughters,\r\nyour wives. Do you wish to have that ideal changed? Woman has become to\r\nman not only a companion, but an inspiration. Out of the crucible of the\r\ncenturies has come what we not only love but adore; before which, in\r\ncertain hours, we bow with a reverence that links us unconsciously with\r\nthe Divine. It is Christian civilization that is in the balance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nARE SUFFRAGISTS SINCERE REFORMERS?\r\n\r\nMRS. AUGUSTINE H. PARKER\r\n\r\n    _Caroline M. Parker, wife of Augustin H. Parker; was educated\r\n    in the Boston schools; is a member of the Dover Grange;\r\n    Vice-President of the Unitarian Alliance of Dover; for five\r\n    years President of the Vincent Club._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the energy and vast sums of money squandered to promote suffrage in\r\nthis country had been expended to bring about the reforms which the\r\nsuffragists claim will be at once brought about by their votes, the\r\nreforms would all have been accomplished long ago. But do the suffragist\r\nleaders care a jot about the reforms? We hear of a Seattle woman who,\r\nnow that she can vote in her own city, leaves home and husband to come\r\nEast and agitate for suffrage. Little does she care that her husband\r\nsues for divorce on the ground of desertion. It is the excitement of\r\nagitation that she craves--the duties and responsibilities of the ballot\r\nare of no interest whatsoever to her.\r\n\r\nA mayor in a city near Boston appointed a suffragist on the city\r\nplanning board. Did she eagerly grasp the chance to plan the city so\r\nthat it should be a joy and a blessing to its inhabitants for all time?\r\nNot at all. She said that the mayor did not consult her, that she had\r\nnot even known there was a city planning board, and that she would not\r\nthink of serving on it in any case.\r\n\r\nThrough the Civic Federation, the Municipal Leagues, and the Women's\r\nClubs, an enormous amount of work for the good of all has been\r\nundertaken; but the suffrage members of these associations far from\r\nwelcoming all public spirited workers, attempt to make the belief in\r\nwoman suffrage the test of a worker's value, and introduce party\r\npolitics and petty strife into these great, non-partisan bodies of\r\nwomen, thereby impairing their services to the Commonwealth to such an\r\nextent that the eyes of many women have been opened to what the state of\r\naffairs would be if all women were in politics. It is not too much to\r\nsay that many women, hitherto indifferent on the suffrage question, have\r\nbeen aroused by such interested and partisan methods into joining the\r\nanti-suffrage cause.\r\n\r\nThere is more work waiting to be done than there are workers to do it.\r\nMinisters are constantly asking from the pulpit for workers. There are\r\nmore offices open to women now than there are women to fill them, but\r\nthey are the offices that mean hard work and no notoriety, and these are\r\nnot what most of the feminist-suffrage leaders are looking for. These\r\nfeminists tell you constantly how badly the men manage the country; the\r\nidea being how much better the women would govern it. But would they?\r\nThe anti-suffragists think that, on the whole, the men are doing well,\r\nand that a government ought to be in the hands of those who have the\r\npower to enforce the laws they make. To have responsibility without\r\npower is to be in a very uncomfortable and ignominious position. To the\r\nobserver it seems that the professional suffrage agitator is _not_ out\r\nfor service or the good of her town, state, and country, but for her own\r\ngood. This is so obvious that her self-assertion is not convincing. It\r\nis through service and not by self-assertion that true women contribute\r\ntheir best work to their country.\r\n\r\nBecause they are unconvinced by the feminist's protestations, few women\r\ncare to be represented by other women. Approximately half the stock of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad is owned by women. They could elect several\r\nwomen directors if they wished to do so, but the board is composed\r\nentirely of men. Women do not as a rule, employ other women to take care\r\nof their business affairs.\r\n\r\nWe anti-suffragists ask to be left free from the useless turmoil of\r\npartisan politics so that we may employ what time and strength we have\r\nin the service of those who need them most. We do not care to waste them\r\nin the petty personal struggles of the political arena--we can well\r\nafford to let the men fight the battles and crowd the polling booths\r\nbecause we in our own places and to the full extent of our power, have\r\nan equally valuable contribution to make to the welfare of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe help of all good women is now at the service of the men who have the\r\nnations' welfare at heart, nor are they hampered by the interference of\r\nthe less good as they must be when the vote of the best might be\r\nnullified by the vote of the worst.\r\n\r\nWe beg the men not to be deceived by the noise and clatter of a few paid\r\nprofessional agitators, supported by misguided enthusiasts whose hearts\r\nare larger than their heads; and we ask the men to help us to uphold the\r\nwomanhood of woman with all its responsibilities, its ideals, and its\r\nspiritual endowment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE AND THE SCHOOL TEACHER\r\n\r\nELIZABETH JACKSON\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth Jackson graduated from the Bridgewater High School\r\n    in 1908, from the Bridgewater State Normal School in 1910, from\r\n    Radcliffe College A. B. (Summa cum laude) 1913, A. M. 1914; is a\r\n    candidate for the degree of Ph. D.; treasurer of Radcliffe Chapter\r\n    of Phi Beta Kappa 1914-16; President of the Radcliffe Graduates'\r\n    Club, 1915-16._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn essential weakness in the suffrage argument is the failure to\r\ndistinguish between government and culture, the functions and the\r\ninstruments of each. Government is an organization for compelling one\r\nportion of the community to do the will of another portion. In a\r\ndemocracy, the minority is forced to obey the majority. The fundamental\r\nidea is compulsion, a thing not lovely in theory and frequently unlovely\r\nin practice. The golden haze that surrounds the dream of ideal democracy\r\nis dissipated by contact with any given city ward. The machinery of\r\ngovernment is a matter of stress and strain; of selfishness, cruelty,\r\nand hate, at the worst; at best, of conflicting interest, mutual\r\nincomprehension, and maddening friction. When we refer to good\r\ngovernment, we may mean either of two things. We may perhaps describe a\r\ncommunity where the majority is notably successful in imposing its will\r\non the minority so that laws are strictly enforced and scrupulously\r\nobeyed. In my experience, this is not the sense in which the suffragist\r\nuses the phrase. Woman suffrage is not advertised as a means of\r\nproducing a more tractable minority. On the contrary, as Mr. Taft has\r\npointed out, the suffrage movement is a conspicuous instance of one\r\ngreat menace of the age, the unwillingness of minorities to abide by the\r\nbest judgment of the state as a whole. Again, the campaign orator does\r\nnot assure the Maine audience that under equal suffrage statewide\r\nprohibition, instituted by male voters, will become a fact instead of a\r\njoke; no speaker in our home town has informed us that woman's vote will\r\nwipe out the saloons that defy the \"no\" of the March meeting. Rather, as\r\nI understand it, the \"good government\" which the suffragist promises to\r\ninaugurate consists of improved legislation along certain specific\r\nlines. That is to say, she promises not that the laws will be better\r\nenforced, but that they will be different. A community's predilection\r\nfor good laws or bad, however, depends not on government but on\r\ncivilization. Public opinion is moulded by innumerable forces, of which\r\nthe home, the church, the newspaper, and the public school are merely\r\nillustrations. In most if not all of these, women already play a\r\nconspicuous part; through them they wield an incalculable power. The\r\nconfusion, unconscious or otherwise, of these forces of culture and the\r\nforces of government, is one of the prime fallacies of the suffrage\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nTo make the true state of the case more clear, take a single\r\ninstitution, the public school, with its various bearings on the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage. Pass over the school committee vote which\r\nonly about two per cent of Massachusetts women regularly use, and\r\nconsider merely the power which the very nature of our school system\r\nputs in women's hands. All the children in our primary grades, and all\r\nbut an infinitesimal fraction of those in the grammar grades, are taught\r\nby women. The preponderance of woman teachers is nearly as great in the\r\nhigh schools where, except in a few cities, men are employed for\r\nadministration and discipline and only secondarily for instruction. That\r\nis to say, women and not men are shaping the minds of future voters\r\nduring the formative and decisive years. From women rather than men, our\r\nchildren learn the elements of good citizenship,--respect for public\r\nproperty, obedience to law, and the power of independent thought.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which the lesson is learned, depends upon two things;\r\nnamely, the quality of the teacher and the extent of her influence.\r\nAccordingly, two questions arise. Would woman suffrage give us better\r\nteachers? Would it increase the power which they already hold? One may\r\nget some light on the first point by studying the placing of normal\r\nschool graduats. The connection between the schools and politics is\r\nalready lamentably close. Many districts, with administrations\r\npredominantly of one party or religious sect choose first teachers of\r\nthat sect, good or bad, and sisters and daughters of voters of that\r\nparty; then enough women to complete the necessary number. Suppose that\r\nthe teacher, instead of being the daughter of the voter, holds the vote\r\nherself. The evil would become universal. There is no indication that a\r\nwoman's salary and position under such circumstances be more directly\r\nconditioned upon her abilities as a teacher. The chances are that woman\r\nsuffrage would tend to make the school more truly the servant of the\r\nparty in power than of the general good. Moreover, a vote can be used as\r\na commodity of exchange; and the woman-voter who amid the fluctuations\r\nof city politics would protect her position by a shrewd use of her\r\nballot would hardly be the best school mistress of American youth.\r\n\r\nThe effect of suffrage upon the teacher's influence in the schoolroom\r\nwould not be beneficial. Her treatment of some subjects, like grammar,\r\nnature study, and raffia work, would of course remain unchanged. It has,\r\nhowever, been said by suffragists that her discussion of civic problems\r\nwould be more intelligent. Would her judgments be cooler because she is\r\nin the thick of the fight, and her statements more convincing because\r\nshe is in direct conflict with the fathers and mothers of half her\r\nclass? It is of the utmost importance that the child shall look upon the\r\nteacher as impartial. He may consider her in some respects his natural\r\nenemy, but he must none the less regard her as one of the immutable\r\nthings of the universe. For this reason public commotions over school\r\naffairs, however well intentioned, injure the institutions they design\r\nto benefit. Anything which tends to increase the possibility of\r\nopposition between the teacher and the child's family, and makes the\r\nchild's attitude partisan is a menace. Suffrage in this field as in so\r\nmany others, offers no compensation for the increased friction and\r\nunrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE AND THE SOCIAL WORKER\r\n\r\nDOROTHY GODFREY WAYMAN.\r\n\r\n    _Dorothy Godfrey Wayman, wife of C. S. Wayman; was educated at\r\n    Bryn Mawr and at the School for Social Workers in Boston; has\r\n    done organized charity and settlement work in Fitchburg and Boston;\r\n    was for one year state organizer of the Massachusetts Womans'\r\n    Anti-Suffrage Association; is a member of Massachusetts Civic\r\n    League._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong people who have what has been called \"the sheep type of\r\nmentality,\" it is frequently asserted that since Miss Jane Addams, Miss\r\nJulia Lathrop, Dr. Katherine Davis, and other \"servants of humanity\" are\r\nsuffragists, it follows that all women should become suffragists. Such\r\npeople do not, however, carry this line of thought to its logical\r\nconclusion; for even they do not consider themselves bound to become\r\nProgressives because that is Miss Addams's political party, nor to\r\nbecome members of her church.\r\n\r\nThis _argumentum ad hominem_ has great weight in the suffrage\r\npropaganda, and it is high time that it should be considered less\r\nsuperficially. Having been a social worker myself in a large city, I\r\nhave been much interested in the history and career of such workers, and\r\nfind therein one of the most positive anti-suffrage arguments.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact that the very women whom suffragists use as\r\npersonal exhibits accomplished the social work that won them fame, under\r\nmale suffrage. Conversely, in the long list of women's names honored for\r\ntheir social service, not one of national reputation earned that\r\nreputation in a woman suffrage state.\r\n\r\nThe National Institute of Social Science awards a gold medal for\r\ndistinction in social service. Men like William H. Taft and Charles W.\r\nEliot have been thus decorated. Miss Jane Addams, Miss Lillian D. Wald\r\nof the Henry Street Nurses' Settlement in New York, Miss Mabel Boardman\r\nof the National Red Cross, and Miss Anne Morgan of New York are the\r\nwomen who have been presented with this medal in past years.\r\n\r\nOn February 25, 1915, the National Institute of Social Sciences\r\nconferred this medal for distinction in social service upon Miss Louisa\r\nSchuyler of New York City. In a long life of useful citizenship, though\r\nunblessed by the ballot, Miss Schuyler has contrived to inaugurate\r\nseveral undertakings and lived to see them grow, till from radical\r\ninnovations, they have become the groundwork of much of our modern\r\ncharity. Miss Schuyler discovered the shocking conditions prevailing in\r\nalmshouses fifty years ago, and organized a series of volunteer visiting\r\ncommittees which eventually became the N. Y. State Charities' Aid\r\nAssociation, with headquarters in New York City. Miss Schuyler was the\r\norganizing genius of the Bellevue Visiting Committee, which from\r\nvisiting the poorhouses of Westchester County, progressed to the\r\nestablishment of the first training school for nurses in this country.\r\nTrained nurses have come to be such a necessity today, that I imagine\r\nfew suffragists realize that they are indebted to one woman's initiative\r\nfor the ministrations of skilled hands that so often may mean the\r\ndifference between life and death. Today there are 1100 training schools\r\nfor nurses, whose existence can be traced to the ideas of a woman living\r\nand working in a male suffrage state. Another feat, more political in\r\nits aspects, accomplished by Miss Schuyler was the inauguration of the\r\nsystem now in force of State care for the insane, and of the removal of\r\ninsane persons and children from the physically and morally degrading\r\natmosphere of the almshouse where they were formerly cared for. In 1908,\r\nMiss Schuyler grappled with another of our great modern problems and\r\norganized the first committee in this country, composed of physicians\r\nand laymen, for the prevention of blindness. What a long way behind the\r\nworld would be today if Miss Schuyler had done as Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nand devoted her great organizing genius to suffrage propaganda!\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Addams' achievements in Chicago at Hull House, are too widely\r\nknown to require any enumeration, but I would emphasize the fact that\r\nher work was done while Illinois was still a male suffrage state. In\r\n_Twenty Years at Hull House_, which was published in 1910, three years\r\nbefore women attained partial enfranchisement in Illinois, Miss Addams\r\ngives her estimate of the field of a settlement in social work for a\r\ncommunity: \"It seems impossible to set any bounds to the moral\r\ncapabilities which might unfold under ideal civic and educational\r\nconditions. But, in order to obtain these conditions, the Settlement\r\nrecognizes the need of cooperation, both with the radical and the\r\nconservative, and from the very nature of the case, the Settlement\r\ncannot limit its friends to any one political party or economic school.\"\r\nSince these words were written, Miss Addams has allied herself\r\ndefinitely with a political party, at great loss of personal prestige,\r\nbut that does not alter the truth of her written opinion. The end of\r\nevery public spirited woman is identical with that of the Settlement,\r\n\"to obtain ideal civic and educational conditions\" for her community;\r\nand \"the very nature of the case,\" as Miss Addams says, demands that\r\nthey be not obliged to limit their friends to any one political party,\r\nbut remain free from political affiliations in order that their\r\ndisinterestedness may not be cavilled at.\r\n\r\nMiss Lillian D. Wald's work as a district nurse at the Henry Street\r\ntenement she chose to occupy on graduating from her training course as a\r\nnurse showed the way to the efficient Visiting Nurses' Associations that\r\nare being organized today all over the country, and also to the public\r\nrecognition of the value of instruction in health which is finding\r\nexpression in the staffs of nurses maintained in many cities by the\r\nBoard of Health and School Departments whose services are free to the\r\npeople. This humanitarian work manifestly had no connection with the\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate Barnard, the \"Girl Commissioner of Charities\" in Oklahoma, is\r\na striking figure of our day. The neighboring state of Kansas is a woman\r\nsuffrage state, yet Miss Barnard seems to prefer residence in the male\r\nsuffrage state of Oklahoma and has done great things there. When\r\nOklahoma was admitted to statehood, it was Miss Barnard who wrote the\r\nchild labor, prison reform, and other humanitarian measures into the\r\nState constitution; and she was made State Commissioner of Charities,\r\nwhich position she holds today. Miss Barnard, too, recognizes the power\r\nfor evil of partisan politics. She is at present waging a bitter fight\r\nfor the property rights of the Indian wards of her state, and writing in\r\nthe _Survey_, says: \"I want the people of the U.S. to stand by me until\r\nthe hand of _partisan politics_ is wrested from the control of Indian\r\naffairs in Oklahoma and in the nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1912, when the Children's Bureau was established at Washington, we\r\nmight have expected that one of the women constituents of the\r\npetticoated West would be placed at its head. Instead, President Taft\r\nappointed Miss Julia C. Lathrop, a resident of Hull House in Chicago,\r\nand a former member of the Illinois State Board of Charities, where she\r\nwas credited with the enlargement of the Illinois State charitable\r\ninstitutions and their thorough reorganization, though, of course,\r\nobliged to work without the ballot. Time has proved the wisdom of Mr.\r\nTaft's appointment and also borne witness to the peculiar advantage\r\nenjoyed by women in politics, provided they are not shackled with the\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nOne of the thought-inspiring books of 1914 was also a splendid argument\r\nfor the anti-suffragists. It was _Beauty for Ashes_, Mrs. Albion\r\nFellowes Bacon's account of the securing of the Indiana Model Housing\r\nAct, which was accomplished through the initiative and leadership of\r\nthis one woman, mother, and home-maker, with no political prestige, with\r\nno previous reputation built by long publicity, without the all-powerful\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bacon was supported by the Federated Woman's Clubs of her State,\r\nand enlisted the aid of earnest men and women citizens throughout the\r\nState. Her bill was bitterly contested by the worst class of landlords,\r\nbut after three sessions of the Legislature, at which Mrs. Bacon was\r\nobliged to appear in person and explain her bill, it was passed. She\r\nsays of that day: \"The women, the homes of Indiana, were honored that\r\nday by the men of the Legislature, and we had won a law for the 101\r\ncities of our State. No wonder the women applauded as some of the men\r\nwho gave their reasons, added 'and because the women wanted it'.\" Her\r\nconclusion is: \"Most strongly have I desired to show how much can be\r\ndone by women's organizations by simply demanding right legislation, and\r\nto show their equally important part of helping to enforce legislation\r\nafter they get it.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of her own work, she says: \"Having no hand in the management of\r\npolitical affairs, I may leave to the various political parties the care\r\nof reaping the thorns in each other's fields. It has been my pleasand\r\ntask to gather only the grapes.... I have encountered more figs than\r\nthistles, and fewer thistles than what seems to be a sort of cacti,\r\nthat, I firmly believe, might be Burbankized for human good. Would that\r\nthey might be, and that we might include in the conservation of vital\r\nresources those great powers for good that are now so wasted by constant\r\nwarring for political supremacy.\"\r\n\r\nThat last sentence forms a scathing indictment of the shortsightedness\r\nof suffrage policy. It is pitiful to think of the energy and ability\r\nwhich today is diverted from channels of human helpfulness to this\r\nsensational struggle for a mistaken cause. It is not to be thought of\r\nthat we can permit woman's energy to be permanently dissipated in\r\npolitical warfare or handicapped by party vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nThese examples of achievements by women of our own day, in our own\r\ncountry, should convince the clear thinker that woman's contribution to\r\ncommunity organization and progress is best accomplished as a\r\nnon-partisan. The stories of Miss Schuyler and Mrs. Bacon prove that\r\nwhenever a woman has a righteous cause or a sane ideal, she will be\r\nsuccessful in its realization without the ballot. The three women cited\r\nabove whose work most depended on legislation for its accomplishment,\r\nMiss Addams, Miss Barnard and Mrs. Bacon, have all in their penned words\r\nlauded the power of non-partisanship.\r\n\r\nAnd, borrowing from Miss Barnard, the anti-suffragist may say to the\r\nwoman who seeks to enfranchise her sister, thus destroying the power of\r\nthat great, womanly contribution towards the solving of the vexed\r\nquestions of the day made by the disinterested, because disfranchised\r\ncitizenness: \"Stand by me till the hand of partisan politics is wrested\r\nfrom the control of society's charities, till prisons, almshouses,\r\nchildren's homes, public hospitals, are administered for the public good\r\nrather than private profit; till decent housing, progressive education,\r\nadequate recreation, pure food, living wages have been made a matter of\r\npublic, rather than political, concern.\" Let us not dissipate our\r\nenergies in internecine warfare, nor yet seek to perpetuate the\r\ndrawbacks of our partisan system of government by enfranchising the\r\nwomen who now stand outside politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE A MENACE TO SOCIAL REFORM\r\n\r\nMARGARET C. ROBINSON\r\n\r\n    _Margaret Casson Robinson, wife of Professor Benjamin L. Robinson\r\n    of Harvard University; President of the Public Interests League\r\n    of Massachusetts; President of the Jaffrey Village Improvement\r\n    Society; Vice-President of the Cambridge Hospital League;\r\n    Vice-President of the Friends of Poland; member of the Executive\r\n    Board of the Cambridge Anti-Tuberculosis Association; Editor of\r\n    the \"Anti-Suffrage Notes,\" and a frequent contributor to the\r\n    press._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth of our anti-suffrage doctrine that woman suffrage will destroy\r\nthe present non-partisan power of women and give us nothing worth having\r\nin its place is constantly confirmed by the current happenings in\r\nsuffrage states. We have now, in the eastern and middle states, a body\r\nof non-political women workers of incomparable value, and one is amazed\r\nat the wrong-headedness which would deprive society of their influence.\r\nUnder present conditions the intelligent woman interested in public\r\naffairs brings the full force of her influence to bear upon legislation;\r\nher influence is a moral influence--it is direct and can be used with\r\nmen of all political parties. The possession of this unprejudiced,\r\nunrestricted power is something which anti-suffragists value so highly\r\nthat the threat of the suffragists to destroy it is a very serious\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that social workers and club women in larger numbers\r\nare not awake to this danger; but, as has well been said, deciding\r\nwisely on this question is not a matter of intelligence but of\r\ninformation; and it is easier to accept suffrage theories and the\r\n_mis_information which suffrage orators generously supply as to how\r\nsuffrage _will_ work than to study the happenings in suffrage states and\r\nlearn for oneself how it _does_ work.\r\n\r\nSocial workers and club women know their present strength and how many\r\ngood laws they have helped to put on the statute books. What they\r\nseemingly do not realize is how quickly this power will be gone when\r\nthey divide into political parties. Many of them are apparently too\r\nignorant of politics to understand that _as voters_ it is only those men\r\nfor whom they will vote that they can influence.\r\n\r\nA despatch from Topeka, Kansas, describing the recent campaign in that\r\nstate says that three years ago the Kansas Federation of Women's Clubs\r\nlined up solidly for suffrage, and won it--and that they have not been\r\nlined up solidly for anything since! Instead of throwing their influence\r\nas a unit for good legislation, as women's clubs are wont to do in male\r\nsuffrage states, these women are divided into Republicans, Democrats,\r\nProgressives, and Socialists, and the friction among them is greater\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\nAt the time Jane Addams joined the Progressive party it was very\r\nstriking that such ardent suffragists as Ida Husted Harper and Edward\r\nDevine, editor of \"The Survey,\" should have protested publicly in the\r\nstrongest terms against her action. They realized perfectly that\r\npolitical partisanship narrows a woman's sphere of influence, and that\r\nMiss Addams as a member of the Progressive party could exercise much\r\nless influence upon Democrats and Republicans. She had before been able\r\nto reach men of all parties, but now her field had suddenly become\r\nimmensely restricted in its scope. And while Mrs. Harper and Mr. Devine\r\nwere perfectly willing, even eager, that other women should enter\r\npolitics and ally themselves with political parties, Miss Addams was too\r\nvaluable to the causes they had at heart, namely, suffrage and social\r\nservice, for them to view with equanimity such a narrowing of her field\r\nof influence.\r\n\r\nIn an article on the \"Legislative Influence of Unenfranchised Women,\" by\r\nMary R. Beard, which appeared in the \"Annals of the American Academy of\r\nPolitical and Social Science,\" for November, 1914, Mrs. Beard, although\r\nan ardent suffragist, admits that women without the vote have been a\r\nstrong influence toward good legislation. She says:\r\n\r\n\"National as well as state legislation has been affected by women, if\r\nthe testimony of men like Harvey W. Wiley is accepted. In his campaign\r\nfor pure food laws, he stated repeatedly that his strongest support\r\ncame from women's organizations. That support was not passive and moral,\r\nmerely expressed to him privately, but these women inundated congress\r\nwith letters, telegrams, petitions, pleading for the passage of the laws\r\nin question. These communications were presented to congress by their\r\nrecipients who often urged as their reason for supporting pure food laws\r\nthe appeals of women whose interests in food should not be ignored.\r\n\r\n\"The Consumers' League of New York helped the national food committee to\r\ndefeat a mischievous amendment to the Gould bill, which requires that\r\nall package goods should be labelled as to the amount of their contents.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Albion Fellowes Bacon, of Indiana, practically single-handed,\r\nsecured the first tenement house laws of value for Evansville and\r\nIndianapolis. She did this before the National Housing Association, of\r\nwhich she is now a director, was formed. The recent improvements in the\r\nIndiana housing legislation are due apparently to her continued\r\nleadership and to the public opinion which she has helped to create. In\r\nher case it was personal initiative and moral persuasion.\r\n\r\n\"Another example of personal influence on legislation exerted by women\r\nis that of Frances Perkins, of New York, in her fight for the fifty-hour\r\nbill for the women workers of her state. Unlike Mrs. Bacon, Miss Perkins\r\nrepresented a society--the Consumers' League--which asked for this\r\nmeasure, and she was supported in her demand by the Women's Trade Union\r\nLeague and other organizations. The measure would have been defeated, as\r\nis widely known and acknowledged in New York, had it not been for the\r\npersonal sagacity and watchfulness of Miss Perkins.\r\n\r\n\"The social service committee of the 'American Club Woman' states that\r\nin the first year of its existence it has done important and effective\r\nwork. It was largely responsible for the passage of an ordinance by city\r\ncouncils regulating dance halls.\r\n\r\n\"Similar activities, both positive and negative, can be discovered in\r\nthe records of practically every woman's association not organized for\r\npurely literary purposes.\"\r\n\r\nWe all know that this is true. Mrs. Beard also says:\r\n\r\n\"The woman's influence lies not in physical force, but in the occasional\r\nsubservience of the mind of man to the actual presence of a moral\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of this moral force is so strong and has come to be so\r\nwell recognized that certain types of politicians and commercial\r\ninterests rebel against it. They wish to destroy it, and as the best\r\nmeans to that end they advocate--woman suffrage! That is not at all in\r\nline with what one is told at suffrage meetings. We are told that women\r\nneed the ballot in order that they may improve the conditions in the\r\nhome, that they may help the working girl, and put through good\r\nlegislation. But the rank and file of suffragists are being deceived in\r\nthese matters, for suffrage works, and will work directly the other\r\nway. The New York World has committed a great indiscretion and has let\r\nthis cat out of the bag. The World recently came out for suffrage and\r\ngave its reasons. One of them is that a few women, representing perhaps\r\nten per cent of the sex, have under present conditions too much\r\ninfluence. These women, the World says, \"have maintained at times a\r\nreign of terror over legislative bodies, in consequence of which half\r\nthe country is now bedeviled by some form or other of harem government,\r\nand legislators are forever making ridiculous concessions to women\r\nagitators.\" These \"women agitators\" are, of course, the club women,\r\nsocial workers, and others interested in social welfare. In order to\r\nmake it unnecessary for legislators to make \"ridiculous concessions\" to\r\nthis type of woman, the World advocates--what? Giving the vote to all\r\nwomen! It has certainly hit upon the most effective expedient, and it is\r\nbecause the vote will do exactly what the World claims for it, that\r\nanti-suffragists are so opposed to it. The World says that most of the\r\nreasons urged in favor of suffrage are fantastic and unreal, that women\r\nare not purer and more noble than men, and that they are not so wise as\r\nmen in general affairs. It admits that they will not purify\r\npolitics--indeed, that they will confuse and disorganize government,\r\nwithout reforming it; but nevertheless it believes in woman suffrage\r\nbecause it will destroy the power of the ten per cent of women whose\r\ninfluence is now so strong!\r\n\r\nThe question for intelligent women to decide is whether or not they\r\n_want_ this influence destroyed. If they wish to give up the moral\r\ninfluence which a body of women, educated, public-spirited,\r\nnon-partisan, can wield--an influence so strong that legislators feel\r\nobliged to make what the World calls \"ridiculous concessions\" to it--if\r\nin its stead they wish to depend on political influence gained through\r\nthe ballot, which can be applied only to one party, which can be\r\nentirely offset by the votes of women who are ignorant, boss-controlled,\r\nand whose votes are purchasable--if they prefer that, they will get\r\ntheir wish if woman suffrage wins. That is exactly how it is working out\r\nin the suffrage states. In Wyoming the politicians were clever enough to\r\nforesee this. Woman suffrage was granted by one of the most corrupt\r\nlegislatures Wyoming ever had. These men knew that at that time good\r\nwomen were few in that sparsely settled State, and they knew they could\r\n\"manage the others.\"\r\n\r\nNevada is offering us a most perfect example of the good woman's loss of\r\ninfluence by entering politics. The easy divorce laws of that state, in\r\nforce until three years ago, were a national scandal. This was realized\r\nby certain women of the state, who in consequence brought their moral\r\ninfluence to bear upon the legislature for the repeal of these laws.\r\nTheir efforts were successful and the laws were repealed. Woman suffrage\r\nwas granted in Nevada last fall, and one of the very first acts of the\r\nlegislature was to re-enact the easy divorce laws! These women again\r\nprotested, but with no success. They were now voters, and the\r\nlegislature knew perfectly well that plenty of women's votes could be\r\nsecured to offset those of the protesting women. The moral influence of\r\nthis minority of Nevada women who cared for social betterment was gone\r\nsince the vote had been given to all women.\r\n\r\nIn her admirable anti-suffrage address before the Maine legislature at\r\nthe recent hearing on suffrage, Mrs. J. F. A. Merrill said:\r\n\r\n\"What do men do when they want to bring about a reform?\r\n\r\n\"They do as the men of Portland did a short time ago, when a number of\r\ncitizens became convinced that the moral conditions in Portland were not\r\nwhat they should be. And what did they do? Did they vote about it? Did\r\nthey form party organizations? No; they resorted as nearly as they\r\ncould, to what is known as 'women's methods,' and formed a non-partisan\r\ncitizen's committee, just as detached as possible from politics. And why\r\ndid they resort to women's methods? Simply because they had all had the\r\nvote since coming of age, and they all knew how useless it is as a means\r\nof accomplishing reform work.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, in every community there are a handful of women who can be\r\nrelied upon to carry on church and philanthropic and reform work; but we\r\nall know that the vast majority are indifferent, and that they neither\r\nhelp nor hinder. And then there is a third class, of women--the\r\nwrongminded. They do not hinder reform work now, because they cannot.\r\n\r\n\"But, gentlemen, when you give the ballot to all women your handful of\r\nearnest women in each community, who are willing to give their time and\r\nthought to reform work, will have only their handful of ballots to cast\r\nfor reform measures; your great mass of indifferent women will be\r\nindifferent still, and will omit to cast their ballots, and your very\r\nconsiderable number of wrongminded women will have had a weapon put into\r\ntheir hands which they will not omit to use against your reform\r\nmeasures, because it is of importance to them to see to it that their\r\nway of life is not interfered with.\r\n\r\n\"So for the sake of reform which women have done in the past, and ought\r\nto be able to do in the future, we beg of you not to tie their hands and\r\nhamper them by giving suffrage to women!\"\r\n\r\nThat is the matter in a nutshell--and proofs of the correctness of this\r\nstatement are constantly multiplying. In an attempt to prove that woman\r\nsuffrage will not lead women to neglect their homes, a writer signing\r\nherself \"Annie Laurie\" says in the San Francisco Examiner:\r\n\r\n\"I've been in Denver when a good man was being maligned and almost\r\nrobbed by political enemies, and he needed the vote of every good woman\r\nin town to keep the good work he had done from being stultified. And do\r\nyou think you could get a single woman out to vote for that man if she\r\nwanted to go to a 'tea' or to stay at home and knit socks for the new\r\nbaby? You could not.\"\r\n\r\nThis is just what anti-suffragists maintain--that the great body of\r\nhome-making women will not vote.\r\n\r\nThe Woman Citizen, a suffrage publication of California, in its July\r\nissue, bears testimony on this question as follows:\r\n\r\n\"There are today many women in California and other States of the union\r\nwho, being enfranchised, are too indifferent to vote. We are loath to\r\nbelieve that these women--thousands of them in the United States--are\r\naware of the wrong they are doing. We do not think they know they are\r\nshirking a fundamental duty of citizenship. Too many ballots are cast in\r\nthe cause of dishonesty and corruption. Honest and law-abiding citizens\r\nmust exert their united strength at the polls to uphold honesty and good\r\ngovernment. There are too many women today who are priviliged to vote,\r\nyet refrain from doing so either because they do not believe a woman\r\nshould go to the polls, or because for some inexcusable reason they have\r\nneglected to register. They regard their franchise as an invitation to a\r\nbridge party, something they can accept or reject as their fancy\r\ndictates.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of testimony that the wrongminded women do vote. On\r\nNovember 4, the day after election, the San Francisco Examiner said:\r\n\"McDonough Brothers had several automobiles busy all day long hauling\r\nBarbary coast dance hall girls and the inmates of houses on Commercial\r\nstreet to the different booths, and always the women were supplied with\r\nmarked sample ballots.\"\r\n\r\nThey were outvoting the women reformers!\r\n\r\nWhat is the result? What is happening to moral conditions in San\r\nFrancisco since women vote? The American Social Hygiene Association\r\npointed out last spring that there had been an _increase_ in the number\r\nof questionable dance halls, and the \"Survey\" of April 10 stated that\r\ndanger signals were being flashed all over the country to young people\r\nbound for the exposition, as there was much unemployment, and the city's\r\nmoral condition gave cause for anxiety.\r\n\r\nA later report, by Bascom Johnson, counsel of the Social Hygiene\r\nAssociation, who was sent to San Francisco for further investigation,\r\nappears in full in the September issue of \"Social Hygiene.\" It is far\r\nmore serious than previous reports. Within the exposition are several\r\nconcessions, maintained despite protests specifically against them,\r\nwhich are deplorably vicious. In the city itself conditions are\r\nappalling, the policemen being there apparently to prevent anything from\r\ninterfering with the orderly and profitable traffic in vice.\r\n\r\nSumming up his report, Mr. Johnston says, \"_in spite of announcements of\r\nofficials to the contrary_, San Francisco remains one of the few large\r\ncities of this country where prostitution is frankly and openly\r\ntolerated. The natural and inevitable result has been that San Francisco\r\nhas become the Mecca of the underworld, and that for every such addition\r\nto her population the problem is rendered that much more difficult.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the conditions in a city where women vote! Mr. Johnson says\r\nthat the Y. W. C. A., the W. C. T. U. and other organizations of the\r\nkind have tried to improve these conditions, but have failed, as they\r\nreceived \"_little or no support from the city officials_.\" This fact is\r\ndirectly in opposition to the suffrage theory that women must have the\r\nvote in order that city and state officials shall pay heed to their\r\nwishes. If California were still under male suffrage--if the thousands\r\nof dissolute women in San Francisco who will vote as the party in power\r\ndictates did not have the vote--the moral influence of the ladies of the\r\nY. W. C. A. and the W. C. T. U. would be much more likely to be a factor\r\nin the situation. If these ladies vote at all, their vote is divided\r\nbetween the Democrats, Republicans, Progressives, and Socialists, and is\r\ntherefore of much less importance than the big vote which can be\r\ncontrolled. Dr. Helen Sumner, sent by the suffragists to study\r\nconditions in Denver several years ago, states that \"the vote of these\r\nwomen to whom the police protection is essential is regarded as one of\r\nthe perquisites of the party in power.\"\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind it is very clear that the statement constantly\r\nmade by suffragists that after women are enfranchised they need not vote\r\nif they do not want to, is shallow and unprincipled, and the woman who\r\nmakes it proves herself an unsafe person to be enfranchised. The\r\nstay-at-home vote is a great and serious menace.\r\n\r\nVoting differs from the higher education and other so-called \"woman's\r\nrights.\" They are privileges only. Whether a girl goes to college or\r\ndoes not go to college is a personal matter, and her decision works no\r\ndanger to other girls or to the community. The college is there, and she\r\ncan go or not, as her taste and circumstances decide. But voting is a\r\ntotally different matter. Enfranchisement confers a privilege and an\r\nobligation, the obligation being inseparable from the privilege. Since\r\nthe shirking of this obligation means a serious menace to the community,\r\nthe unwillingness of a large majority of women to accept the obligation\r\nis a factor of the utmost importance in the situation.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Chronicle says: \"Results show that in this state women\r\nrefuse to accept the obligation which at their request, or upon their\r\napparent acquiescence, has been imposed upon them, or to discharge the\r\nresulting duties. The question, then, for the people of other states to\r\ndecide is the light of experience of the western States is whether it is\r\nin the public interest to impose on women imperative duties which the\r\ngreat majority of them refuse to discharge after they have been imposed\r\nupon them.\"\r\n\r\nAnother danger connected with woman suffrage is this--the character of\r\nthe women chosen for the positions of responsibility will change.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Journal of March 20, 1915, speaking of Mayor Harrison, of\r\nChicago, says: \"If he had occasion to appoint a welfare worker for women\r\nand children, he did not appoint a woman who had experience for the work\r\nand could do it well, but picked out a woman who would be a cog in his\r\npolitical machine.\" Naturally! It is when women are outside politics\r\nthat they are appointed on their merits. When they have the vote those\r\nare naturally chosen who are cogs in the political machine.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists never tire of quoting Julia Lathrop. As she holds an\r\nimportant position as head of the Federal Children's Bureau, they\r\nconsider her views on suffrage, since her views coincide with theirs, as\r\nmost valuable and important. What _is_ important is the fact that if\r\nMiss Lathrop were allied with a political party she would not be holding\r\nthe position which is supposed to give her views such weight. It was\r\nonly because she was a woman and a non-partisan that she retained her\r\nposition at the change of administration, when the Republicans went out\r\nand the Democrats came in. Every _man_ at the head of a similar bureau\r\nlost his job!\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Addams, in a suffrage speech in Boston, claimed that by means\r\nof the ballot women in Chicago have accomplished several important\r\nreforms. These were:\r\n\r\n  1. Covered markets had been secured where food might be kept clean.\r\n  2. A court for boys of 17 and under 25 had been established.\r\n  3. Public wash-houses have been established.\r\n  4. The garbage dumps have been abolished.\r\n\r\nThe record of accomplishments of Chicago women voters as presented by\r\nMiss Addams is not impressive, for the reforms she cites have been\r\naccomplished in other cities without votes for women.\r\n\r\nWhat the women accomplished in Chicago _before_ they got the vote makes\r\na much more impressive showing. It is to them, says the Chicago Tribune,\r\nthat Chicago owes the kindergarten in the public school, the juvenile\r\ncourt and detention home, the small park and playground movement, the\r\nvacation school, the school extension, the establishment of a forestry\r\ndepartment of the city government, the city welfare exhibit, the\r\ndevelopment of the Saturday half-holiday, the establishment of public\r\ncomfort stations, the work of the Legal Aid Society, and the reformation\r\nof the Illinois Industrial School. This is a long and brilliant list of\r\nwomen's achievements, not to be matched by the voting women of any\r\nstate. Chicago women were working together when these things were\r\naccomplished--now they are fighting each other in rival political\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nHenry M. Hyde, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, which has long\r\nsupported the woman suffrage movement, wrote over his own signature his\r\nimpressions of last spring's election in Chicago, and the part women\r\nplayed in it. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The first mayoralty campaign in which women voters participated failed\r\nto develop the refining and elevating influence which the sex was\r\nexpected to exert. When one sees a woman of dignified presence and\r\ncultivated appearance greeted with torrents of hisses and insults from\r\nthe frenzied lips of both men and women; when one sees her finally\r\ndriven from the platform with no chance of speaking a word, one is\r\ntempted to retire to some quiet spot for a moment and meditate on what\r\nit all means.\r\n\r\n\"When one watches a venerable lady trying to quell the tumult by waving\r\na flag and almost dancing to the same rhythm, while 1,200 shrieking men\r\nand women order her to 'sit down and chase herself,' one remembers his\r\nown grandmother, and makes a feeble effort to blush. One is almost\r\ntempted to pick that discarded and discredited old relic once known as\r\nmasculine chivalry out of the scrap heap, and see how many people would\r\nrecognize it.\"\r\n\r\nThese references are to a woman's political mass meeting, which was\r\ndescribed in a Chicago despatch to the Boston Herald as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A demonstration approaching a riot marked the women's political meeting\r\nhere today, and was ended only when the managers of the theatre where\r\nthe meeting was held dropped the steel curtain and a spectator sent in a\r\nriot call for the police.\"\r\n\r\nDoes this sort of thing tend to increase woman's influence in uplifting\r\nand benefiting her community?\r\n\r\nA suffrage writer said recently that the son who grows up to find his\r\nmother a voter will have a broadened respect for womanhood. With these\r\nscenes in Chicago in mind, do you think he will? Suppose she has just\r\nvoted for Bath-House John, the notorious candidate who got a majority of\r\nthe women's votes in his ward, or in favor of saloons, as thousands of\r\nwomen have done--will he have added respect for her? This same writer\r\nsays: \"It might be a new and stimulating experience for a man to have to\r\nexplain to his wife just why he was voting on the side of a corrupt\r\nboss, in favor of the liquor traffic, or against the suppression of\r\nchild labor.\" But if she had just done those things herself--and in\r\nChicago the women voted just as the men did--why should the experience\r\nbe a stimulating one?\r\n\r\nJane Addams, while on her foreign mission of \"Peace--with suffrage\" said\r\nin London, on May 12, 1915:\r\n\r\n\"I am a strong supporter of woman suffrage, and, although I hope to see\r\nthe women of England enfranchised, I see around me endless opportunities\r\nfor social work which could be usefully performed while the vote is\r\nbeing won.\"\r\n\r\nThe interesting point about this is that English women have for many\r\nyears had the vote on all matters pertaining to housing, care of the\r\npoor, sanitation, education, liquor regulations, police, care of the\r\ninsane, care of children, etc. Probably Miss Addams does not know this.\r\nThey have failed completely to do with the vote what even Miss Addams,\r\nconfirmed and prejudiced suffragist that she is, admits that they could\r\ndo perfectly well without the vote. This is certainly a striking\r\nadmission on her part.\r\n\r\nWhy have they failed so lamentably? Mrs. Pethick Lawrence tells us. She\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"I never saw so many women working for social betterment as I have seen\r\nin the American cities I have visited. _In England women have turned\r\ntheir attention to politics and have accomplished nothing like so much\r\nin civic reform._\"\r\n\r\nAnti-suffragists ask women not to turn their attention to politics and\r\nneglect civic reform; not to make this appalling mistake, which will set\r\nback the social progress of our cities for many years; not to make\r\npowerless, through woman suffrage, as the New York World wants to do,\r\nthe women who are now working for social betterment.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists apparently do not care what evils follow, provided they\r\nget their way.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Shaw, president of the National Suffrage Association,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"I believe in woman suffrage whether all women vote or no women vote;\r\nwhether all women vote right or all women vote wrong; whether all women\r\nwill love their husbands after they vote or forsake them; whether they\r\nwill neglect their children or never have any children.\"\r\n\r\nIn introducing this astounding statement, Dr. Shaw declared: \"I believe\r\nI speak for the thousands of women belonging to the national\r\nassociation.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps she does. At least no one of them has been heard to deny it; but\r\nfortunately she does not speak for the 24,000,000 women of voting age in\r\nthe United States who are not members of the National Suffrage\r\nassociation. Many of these do care for public welfare, for social\r\nwell-being, and for human happiness, all of which would be destroyed if\r\nall women voted wrong, if they deserted their husbands, and neglected\r\ntheir children. Anti-suffragists protest against having political power\r\nput into the hands of women with no higher ideals than those of Dr. Shaw\r\nand her followers. They neither wish to be ruled by such women nor do\r\nthey wish to have to wage an eternal fight not to be ruled by them, and\r\none thing or the other will be necessary if the ballot is forced upon\r\nwomen. In California the men are begging the home-making type of women\r\nto come out and fight the political women, whom they already recognize\r\nas a danger and a nuisance.\r\n\r\nMen who believe in fair play will refuse to force political life upon\r\nall the women of their states because a small fraction think they want\r\nit. Those who care for the political welfare of their states will\r\ndecline to adopt this innovation, which assuredly cannot stand the tests\r\nof rational criticism and of experience. If they value in the slightest\r\ndegree the assistance which educated, public-spirited women are able to\r\ngive in securing enlightened legislation, they will certainly not favor\r\nvotes for women; for what woman suffrage does is to take the power out\r\nof the hands of these women, who without the vote exert a strong moral\r\ninfluence toward good legislation, and put the power gained through an\r\nincrease in the electorate into the hands of the bosses who can control\r\nthe largest woman's vote.\r\n\r\n\"Practical politicians\" are learning this lesson rapidly. The New York\r\nCommercial calls attention to the fact that in our cities the female\r\nvote is more easily manipulated than the male. This fact does not\r\nescape the bosses, and they are rapidly coming into line for woman\r\nsuffrage. While woman suffrage was largely an untried theory suffragists\r\ncould maintain with some plausibility that woman's vote would be cast\r\nfor moral and humane legislation, and would purify politics; but with\r\nthe actual conditions in Chicago, San Francisco, Reno, Denver, and\r\nSeattle what they are, this theory no longer holds water, and it is\r\nbecoming increasingly evident that the way to do away with the moral\r\ninfluence of women in public life is to give the vote to all women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE ANTI-SUFFRAGE IDEAL\r\n\r\nMRS. HERBERT LYMAN\r\n\r\n    _Ruth Whitney Lyman, wife of Herbert Lyman; studied two years at\r\n    Bryn Mawr; a member of the Woman's Municipal League of Boston and\r\n    of the Board of Directors of the North End Diet Kitchen._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen today find their sex disquieted by deep unrest. Our sex is seeking\r\nto adjust itself to new conditions. Suffrage, feminism, militancy, have\r\nbeen the symptoms of the first phase of modern woman's attempt to adjust\r\nherself to twentieth century conditions. That phase was the outgrowth of\r\nhasty judgment, and is rapidly giving place to the second phase, wherein\r\nthe sober second thought of the normal woman is repudiating the false\r\nvalues preached by those women who impulsively leaped to the conclusion\r\nthat man's sphere was more potent than woman's and therefore more\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe struggle over woman suffrage presents the spectacle of two camps of\r\nwomen arrayed against each other with opposing ideals. Let no one be so\r\nsimple as to suppose that the issue is one between men and women. It is\r\nnot a \"woman's rights\" question; it is a _which_ woman's rights\r\nquestion. Two types of women are at war, for although both desire the\r\nsame end--namely, a better world to live in--they differ fundamentally\r\nas to the method of attaining it.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difference is this--that the suffragist (like the\r\nsocialist) persists in regarding the individual as the unit of society,\r\nwhile the anti-suffragist insists that it is the family. Individualism\r\nis the all-important thing to the suffragist; to the anti-suffragist it\r\nis soundness of family relationships. Suffragism is founded upon a\r\nsex-conscious individualism and sex antagonism, which leads it to say\r\nthat woman can only be represented by herself, and that women now are a\r\ngreat unrepresented class. As a matter of fact, women are not a class,\r\nbut a sex, pretty evenly distributed throughout all the various classes\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nAnti-suffrage is founded upon the conception of co-operation between the\r\nsexes. Men and women must be regarded as partners, not competitors; and\r\nthe family, to be preserved as a unit, must be represented by having one\r\npolitical head. The man of the family must be that representative,\r\nbecause government is primarily the guarantee of protection to life and\r\nproperty and rests upon the political strength of the majority, which\r\nshould be able in times of need to force minorities to obey their will.\r\nThat is the only basis on which a democracy can endure. Suffragism says\r\nthat in order to attack existing evils women must organize for\r\nparticipation in law making. It stakes its faith on more government (a\r\nsecond resemblance to socialism), upon control by law. The\r\nanti-suffragist sees the evils of society as fundamentally resulting\r\nfrom the evil in individuals, and calls on women to check it at its\r\nsource. They emphasize the power of individual homes to turn out men and\r\nwomen, who, trained to self-control, will not necessitate control by\r\nlaw. Knowing well that the great training school for private morality is\r\nfamily life, the anti-suffragist seeks to preserve conditions making for\r\nsound family life, the sum total of private morality being public\r\nmorality, the conscience of the people.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the twentieth century has given us its watchword, which is,\r\ndifferentiation or division of labor. Anti-suffragists by accepting it,\r\nand applying to their sex the new demands of specialization, put\r\nthemselves abreast of the times; but suffragists lag behind, still\r\nharping on the exploded theories of equality and identity. The\r\nstrikingly progressive message the new century presents us is this: Give\r\nequal opportunity to men and women for expression along their\r\n_different_ lines. Government, law making, law enforcement, with all the\r\nallied problems of tariff, taxation, police, railroads, interstate and\r\ninternational relationships, etc., must still be the business of men.\r\nThe business of women must be to work out a national ideal of domestic\r\nlife and juvenile training. They must standardize the family life with\r\ntheir new understanding of the importance of the product of every\r\nseparate family to the state.\r\n\r\nThe suffragist, who is so often the unmarried or childless woman, here\r\nobjects that women could also vote. But it is practically impossible for\r\nwomen as a sex to undertake the regular and frequent political duties.\r\nIf the highest efficiency in private life is to be striven toward, women\r\nmust regard themselves as a sort of emergency corps, prepared to meet\r\nthe unexpected; for illness, accidents, temptation, sorrow--all the\r\ndisturbances of domestic life--do not come at stated intervals. Anyone\r\ncan readily see that for women private duty would constantly conflict\r\nwith public duty. To become an efficient political unit, a woman would\r\nhave to set aside much time and strength upon organizing and bringing\r\nout the woman's vote. There would be the splitting up of women into\r\nrival political groups on class, race, or religious lines, the\r\ndissipation of energies and strain of contention for women who in\r\nAmerica already reach with sad frequency the breaking point of nerves\r\nand body.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to such obligatory activity for all women, consider the\r\nfield of voluntary non-partisan activity now open to the single woman,\r\nthe woman of leisure, and to every woman at such times as her family\r\nduties permit. Indeed the germ of the true woman's movement lies in the\r\nactivities of such organizations as education societies, playground\r\nassociations, municipal leagues, and so forth, which are only in their\r\nfirst stages of usefulness. Here is ample scope and outlet for talents\r\nand energy.\r\n\r\nOur sex, if kept out of politics, has the opportunity in these days when\r\nwe prate so much about peace, to set about disarming distrust and\r\ndiscord within our own borders. Shall we not dream of a united American\r\nwomanhood? We twentieth century women may take a noble stride toward it,\r\nif we will, by working for those causes that disregard the divisions of\r\nrace, religion, and politics. Is it surprising that the anti-suffragist\r\nsees a vast, unexhausted field for woman's influence outside the\r\npolitical? No wonder that to the suffragist's craving for a new sphere\r\nand new rights she opposes the plea of old duties unfulfilled and\r\nexisting opportunities neglected.\r\n\r\nTo contrast the opposing ideals of the two groups of women, let me quote\r\nfrom what a great Frenchman said in the time of the French Revolution:\r\n\"You have written upon the monuments of your city the words\r\nLiberty--Fraternity--Equality. Above Liberty write Duty; above\r\nFraternity write Humility; above Equality write Service; above the\r\nimmemorial creed of your Rights inscribe the divine creed of your\r\nDuties.\" I truly believe that the women who, perceiving present duties\r\nimperfectly performed, refuse to take up the cry for more rights, are\r\nfollowing the more Christ-like ideal. I do not think that twentieth\r\ncentury American women have outgrown His peerless example, which urges\r\nthem to be faithful first over a few things as He commanded. God made us\r\nwomen; and if we are told that women suffer more than men in peace and\r\nwar, let us answer, \"Very likely--Christ Himself found His cross\r\nheavy--let us bear the cross and crown of womanhood in His name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE FUNCTION OF THE NORMAL WOMAN\r\n\r\nMRS. HORACE A. DAVIS\r\n\r\n    _Anna Hallowell Davis, wife of Horace Davis; was educated in\r\n    Boston private schools and is a graduate of Radcliffe College;\r\n    was a member of Local School Board No. 46, New York City, for eight\r\n    years; is a member of Brookline Civic Society, the North Bennett\r\n    Street Industrial School Association, and of the Massachusetts\r\n    Peace Association._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole question of suffrage and anti-suffrage is significant chiefly\r\nas it affects the married woman with children and a home; for if there\r\nis any elemental fact on which to plant our feet, it is that the normal\r\nwoman is a wife and mother and home-maker. But is not the contention of\r\nthe suffragists fundamentally based upon the circumstances of the woman\r\nwho is not leading this normal life,--who is unmarried, who has no\r\nchildren, or who is not making a home and bringing up her children\r\nherself? It is in planning for these exceptional women, as I think they\r\ndo, that the suffragist leaders tend to ignore the truly representative\r\nwomen--the majority. Do we not suspect, indeed, that they are turning\r\nto new ideals, because they have never tried the old? As Chesterton\r\nsays: \"The ideal house, the happy family, is now chiefly assailed by\r\nthose who have never known it, or by those who have failed to fulfil it.\r\nNumberless modern women have rebelled against domesticity in theory,\r\nbecause they have never known it in practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" the suffragists ask, \"granting that your woman of 'normal' life\r\nis in the majority, and doesn't want the vote, _oughtn't_ she to want\r\nit? Casting a ballot takes next to no time, and that is all she needs to\r\ndo. Most men do no more than that.\"\r\n\r\nBut men ought to do more. That is just the point. That is just why\r\ncorrupt government has been fastened on our cities. The Tammany leaders\r\ndo more. They give all their time to politics; but the \"reform\" vote\r\ncannot, except occasionally, be got to the polls in sufficient numbers;\r\nand too few of the best men will run for office. If women are simply\r\ngoing to aggravate these conditions, if the \"normal,\" representative\r\nwoman isn't going to vote and hold office, and the non-representative,\r\nexceptional woman is, where is the advantage to the state of adding\r\nwomen to the electorate? Probably, however, rather than have this\r\nhappen, the representative woman would feel that she must enter the\r\nlists. In competition with \"abnormal\" or unscrupulous women, she would\r\nbe forced to vote and to hold office. More than just going to the polls,\r\nshe would have to think, read, and talk politics, as men do, or ought to\r\ndo. The whole question here is: Is it better for her to do this, or to\r\ndo the things which men don't do? _For one person can't do it all well._\r\nA good mother of three or four children already has more than she can do\r\nwell. If she takes up this whole new department of life and thought, I\r\nam convinced she will have to let something else go, and already under\r\nthe influence of the feminist movement, that \"something else\" seems to\r\nbe her home. So, this is what the anti-suffragists feel most\r\nkeenly--that once the franchise is imposed as a duty, they would have to\r\ndo the things which men already are doing (and doing as well as the\r\nwomen could do them); that they would no longer be free to do what they\r\nthink is the higher work for them, as women. Therefore, when a\r\nsuffragist tells me she has a \"right\" to vote, I say that, in the name\r\nof the best interests of the community, I have the right _not_ to vote.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which the anti-suffragists feel is not recognized\r\nsufficiently by their opponents, is the essential and valuable\r\ndifference between men and women in their manner of approach to any\r\ngiven human problem. \"Law\" to the antis seems a man's word. Man thinks\r\nof people in masses. He makes laws for the whole. He generalizes better\r\nthan women. On the other hand, where woman is stronger than he is in her\r\nfeeling for the individual person, and her use of love rather than of\r\nlaw, neither the masculine nor the feminine gift is better, the one than\r\nthe other, but the two work together as necessary parts of one whole. As\r\nIda Tarbell puts it: \"Human society may be likened to two great\r\ncircles, one revolving within the other. In the inner circle rules the\r\nwoman. Here she breeds and trains the material for the outer circle,\r\nwhich exists only by and for her. That accident may throw her into this\r\nouter circle is, of course, true, but it is not her natural habitat. Nor\r\nis she fitted by Nature to live and circulate freely there. What it all\r\namounts to is that the labor of the world is naturally divided between\r\nthe two different beings that people the world. It is unfair to the\r\nwoman that she be asked to do the work of the outer circle. The man can\r\ndo that satisfactorily if she does her part, that is, if she prepares\r\nhim the material. Certainly, he can never come into the inner circle and\r\ndo her work.\"\r\n\r\nSo, in claiming for women the right to take a part in the man's half of\r\nlife, the suffragists, I think, lose sight of what the woman's half is.\r\nIn urging that they must have a hand in law-making and government and\r\npublic life generally, they do not see that woman's peculiar work is\r\npretty independent of laws and of government, is rather in private life.\r\nFor it is just where the law cannot reach that woman is supreme. It is\r\njust in the finer, more personal and intimate relationships of life,\r\nwhich government cannot include, that woman finds her work waiting for\r\nher, which she alone can do--what Octavia Hill calls \"the out-of-sight,\r\nsilent work.\"\r\n\r\nThat woman is today neglecting this, her own part of the world's work, I\r\nthink is everywhere apparent. Surely we do not need more laws; what we\r\ndo need is more of the spirit which shall make people want to obey the\r\nlaws which we have. What else does it mean when we say we cannot enforce\r\nthe laws? The suffragists are clamoring for more laws, for more of the\r\nman-element in society; the anti-suffragists feel that it is the inner\r\nlife and character, the mother's work, which everywhere needs\r\nstrengthening. Settlement workers, doctors, ministers, and police\r\ncommissioners, are beginning to feel this, too. They are telling us that\r\nin their work they find that no laws and no institutions can take the\r\nplace of home teaching and influence with young people. The outer\r\nrestraint and penalty are little effective unless they are met by the\r\ninner desire to do right.\r\n\r\nOn points like these I believe the accent should be laid today. The\r\npendulum is swinging too far away from the things which our mothers and\r\ngrandmothers made their chief concern. What is called \"the rise of\r\nwoman,\" her new feeling of influence and power, are blessings only as\r\nthey help her to do better and of freer choice the things which are in\r\ntune with Nature and with the need of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERATIVE DEMAND UPON WOMEN IN THE HOME\r\n\r\nMRS. CHARLES BURTON GULICK\r\n\r\n    _Anne Hathaway Gulick, wife of Professor Charles B. Gulick of\r\n    Harvard University; graduated at the Framingham State Normal\r\n    School; taught four years in Boston and Cambridge, and is\r\n    Secretary of the Public Interests' League of Massachusetts._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his address to the Associated Press on April 21, 1915, President\r\nWilson said: \"You deal in the raw material of opinion, and if my\r\nconvictions have any validity, _opinion_ ultimately governs the world.\"\r\nThis is exactly what the anti-suffragists believe and teach. They know\r\nthat the vote merely registers public opinion, it does not make it.\r\nTherefore, they oppose laying the useless burden of the ballot on the\r\nshoulders of woman, who already has every opportunity in her own special\r\nprovince to mold public opinion by educating the inmates of her home to\r\nlive right and to think right. From such homes, where high principles\r\nare inculcated, comes the public spirited, right minded man, whose vote\r\nregisters the fact that the mother in that home has done her duty\r\nfaithfully and well. A woman who has thus fulfilled her obligation to\r\nthe world knows that there is not time left to take up political duties.\r\nEither the home or the politics must suffer. In the end, in the great\r\nmajority of cases, nature would assert herself, and the political duties\r\nwould be neglected.\r\n\r\nA minister, who is a suffragist, is quoted recently as saying: \"Our\r\nyoung men, we believe, would be safer if their mothers and wives had the\r\nballot, for they are the ones most injured by many evils.\" In what way\r\nwill our young men be safer because their mothers and their wives have\r\nthe ballot? Instead of devoting themselves wholly to teaching their sons\r\nand daughters the value of self-restraint, of respect for the rights and\r\ncomfort of others, and the importance of high ideals of citizenship, if\r\nthese same mothers and wives are dividing their attention between the\r\nhome and political strife and strain, can they reasonably be expected to\r\nfulfill their greatest duty successfully? No woman should be obliged to\r\ndivide her energies, and so have less time to give to the study of her\r\nchildren. No two children are alike, and each child requires special\r\nconsideration and care for its best development. Can any one tell at\r\nwhat moment a child may need unusual attention and thought to guide it\r\naright? Supposing the mother had the ballot, would the political\r\ncampaign wait because her child was going through a particularly trying\r\nperiod, when a step one way or the other might make or mar its\r\ncharacter? Or would the child wait to take the step because it was\r\nimportant for the mother to throw all the weight of her sound sense and\r\ngood influence into the political campaign, and she must, therefore,\r\njust at this critical time set aside her home duties? No, most certainly\r\nnot. The mother must have _no_ other duties which could come before her\r\nhome duties at any time.\r\n\r\nSome one said recently: \"A man must have a place to go from and to come\r\nto.\" In order to make him continue to want to go from and come to his\r\nhome, there must be something there to make him look forward to the\r\nhome-coming with pleasure as the reward of his labor. If this home is\r\nkept by a woman who cannot be at home often when most needed, who labors\r\nunder the excitement of the political campaign, how long is he going to\r\nlook forward to his home-coming? Of course, the answer to this is that\r\nmost women would not spend any more time over politics than they do now.\r\nBut if that is so, of what use will they be as voters, and why add a\r\nperfectly useless body of voters, when this addition to the electorate\r\nwill mean an increase in the expenses of the government and consequently\r\nhigher cost of living, already too high for the average family?\r\n\r\nWe do not believe with Mr. Creel that \"the old fashioned idea of home is\r\nbunk,\" nor do we agree with Mr. Roger Sherman Hoar, who is reported as\r\nsaying that \"woman suffrage, by doubling the electorate, will double the\r\nopportunities of each man for political interest.\" He goes on to say\r\nthat when a man's wife becomes a voter he will talk politics with her\r\nand will give more weight to her political opinion, thereby learning the\r\nhome point of view on home matters. Is it probable that a man who has\r\nnot spent enough time with his wife to know what the home point of view\r\nis before she has a vote, would be induced to spend more time there\r\nbecause she had? It is much more likely that he would spend less time\r\nthere, since without political duties she was unable to make his home\r\nattractive, and with political duties she would have even less time to\r\ngive to the making of a good home. Further on we read: \"With increased\r\ninterest in matters political\"--this increase to be brought about by\r\ngiving women the vote--\"the men will scrutinize their public servants\r\nmore carefully.\" What becomes here of the contention of the suffragists\r\nthat the _ballot_ is the only thing that wakens interest in good\r\ngovernment, if the men who already have the ballot are not interested in\r\ngood government, but need to have the women enfranchised before they can\r\nhave a real interest in matters political?\r\n\r\nNo, woman must specialize in the home. I am not speaking of those who\r\n\"by choice or accident have missed the highest privilege of womanhood,\"\r\nas Mr. Pyle ably puts it, but of the great majority of women. To my mind\r\nthe advantages of a properly conducted home life far outweigh the\r\nadvantages of any institution, no matter how good. That I am not alone\r\nin this opinion is witnessed by the fact that the trustees of the best\r\norphan asylums are making every effort to diminish the number of\r\nchildren in their institutions and to place the children in homes. They\r\nhave learned that even a poorly conducted home is better than a well\r\nconducted asylum, and that they have no right to deprive children of the\r\nbenefits of family life. Yet the feminists, closely allied with the\r\nsuffragists, advocate putting children of tender age into institutions,\r\nwhere, according to them, they will be better cared for than at home.\r\n\"If they are well, the institution nurse is as good; if they are ill,\r\nshe is much better than the mother\" says one suffrage leader. Those of\r\nus who have known better can only pity people who hold such beliefs. To\r\nthem mother love can have no meaning. Yet those of us who have felt this\r\nmother love, know what a guiding star it has been, and must always\r\ncontinue to be, brightening steadily as the years go by, and beckoning\r\nus more persistently than ever to higher ideals when it is only a\r\nmemory. Who would dare deprive our children of this precious heritage?\r\nOnly the unknowing.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the women who rebel against the idea that home is the place\r\nfor woman are largely those who misunderstand the duties of home, who\r\nthink only of the drudgery, and forget to think of the happiness that\r\ncomes with watching our families develop under our care. Although the\r\nmother must do all the work in the average family, it is not from these\r\nhomes where in most cases the women are happily busy with their home\r\nduties that most of the agitation about abandonning the home comes, but\r\nfrom among those people who have too much leisure on their hands, and\r\nwho, unfortunately, do not find sufficiently exciting the duties of\r\ntraining good citizens. Whatever our work in life, whatever our\r\noccupation, we cannot rid ourselves of drudgery. Is there not more\r\ndeadening, unvarying monotony for the business woman, the shop girl, the\r\nfactory hand, than for the woman in the home who is her own mistress and\r\ncan in some degree regulate and vary her work to suit her own pleasure?\r\nIt is only because such work is new and untried by them that many women\r\nthink it preferable to home duties; but the fact that so many girls in\r\nindustry marry young to get away from this uncongenial work proves that\r\nwhen tried it is not found either so exciting or so interesting as these\r\nadvocates of woman in industry and out of the home imagine.\r\n\r\nDo not mistake me: No woman should spend all of her time at home. Public\r\nneeds and social duties must be attended to. From the latter she brings\r\nrefreshment and new ideas to the home, and by giving a proper share of\r\nher energies to the former she can do her part toward helping the\r\ncommunity in which she lives to be constantly improving itself, and so\r\nto become an ideal place in which to develop worthy citizens. With these\r\ninterests she can be a real influence for good, and without them she\r\nmust fall short of ideal motherhood. We must not forget that a woman can\r\nselect her own time for her social duties, and they can be set aside at\r\nany time that more important matters need her attention in the home,\r\nbut that she could not select her own time for political duties.\r\n\r\nLet us remember, then, as Miss Lucy Price says, that after all, women in\r\nbig business are not the successes, men can do that work as well and\r\nbetter than they. It is the women in the home, outnumbering all others\r\nfifteen to one (and fourteen of these do not keep a servant), who are\r\nreally the great and typical women of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE AND THE SEX PROBLEM\r\n\r\nMRS. WILLIAM LOWELL PUTNAM\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. William Lowell Putnam; a director of the American\r\n    Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality;\r\n    Chairman, Department of Public Health of Women's Municipal League\r\n    of Boston, which has the following committees: Household Nursing,\r\n    Prenatal and Obstetrical Care, Sanitation and Safety of Public\r\n    Buildings and Conveyances, Hygiene of Occupations, Abatement of\r\n    Noise, Social Hygiene and Quackery; a member of the National Child\r\n    Welfare Exhibit Committee, and of the Massachusetts Committee\r\n    on Unemployment of the American Section of the International\r\n    Association; Chairman, Executive Committee of Massachusetts Milk\r\n    Consumers' Association; Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Boston\r\n    of the Special Aid Society for American Preparedness._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nMore talk and less thought is expended on the subject of sex today than\r\non almost anything else.\r\n\r\nIt is a hopeful sign for the future that society in general is awakening\r\nto the far-reaching importance of the relations between the sexes,\r\nand--feeling that these relations at present leave much to be\r\ndesired--is offering many suggestions for the solution of this vexed\r\nproblem, even though the suggestions themselves are not always\r\ncalculated to obtain the desired results. The fact that throughout much\r\nof the civilized world, women outnumber men, combined with the attitude\r\nof certain women whose lives have been passed without personal\r\nexperience of sexual relations has led to the suggestion that the sex\r\nproblem may be simplified in the future by the development of a neuter\r\nsex which these people think they see approaching. But this seems hardly\r\na likely solution, for asexuality must of necessity be self-destructive,\r\nand need not, therefore, occupy us long, though just now the type does\r\nseem rather self-concious. A less fanciful, though not more satisfying,\r\nsolution is that of the feminist, who, in hunting for a cure, demands\r\nfor men and women alike no restraint on sexual relations beyond the\r\nimmediate desires of the two people most intimately concerned, while her\r\nmilder sister, the suffragette, believes that women by voting can bring\r\nabout in both sexes the control of human passion.\r\n\r\nThat the sexual relation interests the world is not so new a condition\r\nas we sometimes think; indeed, half unconsciously, sex has always been\r\nof paramount interest from the cradle to the grave, from the time when\r\nthe child alone first nurses tenderly its doll, or in groups plays\r\nhouse, and at being father and mother and children. It is only the\r\nrealization and open discussion of the interest which is new. Sex is the\r\nmost vital thing in the world, for on it all but the lowest forms of\r\nlife depend; hence the instinct of reproduction is equalled in its force\r\nby no other except, perhaps, that of self-preservation. We must think\r\nabout it. Only let us think straight.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive instinct is normally stronger in men than in women;\r\nbecause in matters of sex, whatever he may be in other things, man is\r\ncertainly the giver and woman the receiver of the gift. This fact has\r\nled to the assumption that man is, therefore, responsible for all the\r\nsins of sex, and this would undoubtedly be true were instinct and\r\npassion matters quite beyond our personal control, but they are not. The\r\ninstinct of self-preservation is the most fundamental feeling that we\r\nhave, and yet in the sinking of the \"Titanic\" and the horror of the\r\n\"Lusitania,\" we saw this instinct controlled--how gloriously--by the\r\nhighest manhood of men, not only of those from whom we should have\r\nexpected the utmost consideration, but also of those who, we might have\r\nthought, had forfeited their manhood by lives of uncontrolled and sodden\r\nself-indulgence, lives full of injury to women, and to children born\r\nthrough them. Their manhood was not lacking when the call to protect the\r\nwomen and the children came in terms which they could understand. Why\r\nwere they not taught to control the other fundamental instinct of life\r\nat a time when such a thing was possible? Are men responsible for the\r\nevil of their upbringing? Is it not their mothers rather, who should\r\nbear the heaviest burden of blame?\r\n\r\nEvery man is born of woman and almost every man is cared for by a woman\r\nthroughout his earliest years. The Jesuits, in their wisdom, founded on\r\nmuch experience, have said: \"Give me a child until he is seven and after\r\nthat you may do what you like with him!\" It is these early years that\r\ncount most in a man's future. What have the mothers done in these years?\r\nHave they taught their children the laws of the transmission of life in\r\ntheir sacredness and their beauty, or, while willingly telling them of\r\nall the other facts of life, have they let this one, by far the most\r\nimportant, go untold, fear tying their tongues, and given to themselves\r\nthe excuse of ignorance unequal to its task--an ignorance which in a\r\nmother is culpable--I had almost said criminal? Moreover, the\r\nresponsibility of women for the moral standards of men does not end with\r\ntheir boyhood, for each sex is ultimately what the other demands of it\r\nto be. Men have demanded purity of their women, but women have not\r\ndemanded it of men. Have not good women been in the habit of receiving\r\ninto their society men whose past they know to have been bad--yes, and\r\neven of encouraging their daughters to marry such men for the sake of\r\nmoney or of social position? Women's responsibility for the social evil\r\nis greater than that of men, and those who are most responsible are the\r\ngood women of the community. The arraignment is severe, but is it not\r\ndeserved?\r\n\r\nIt is in childhood that the teaching of the sex relation must be\r\ngiven,--with the children that the training of self-control must begin.\r\nIf men and women are started right in childhood, the later time will\r\ntake care of itself. I would not belittle the father's influence, nor\r\nhis teaching of his children; but of the two the mother is the more\r\nimportant, for the man who has talked of all things with his mother, to\r\nwhom the sacredness of motherhood is indissolubly bound up with the\r\ngreat instinct of reproduction, will find it very hard to go far wrong.\r\nThe girl, too, who understands the laws of her own nature and that of\r\nthe young men whom she meets, will be in a position not only to choose\r\nher mate more wisely, but in the things that come up every day among\r\nyoung people of opposite sexes she will not excite in him, by word and\r\ngesture, through mere careless ignorance, as is so often done, a\r\npassion, which, though she go free and ignorant of harm, may bring to\r\nhim much needless suffering, and may sometimes end in ruin both for him\r\nand for some other.\r\n\r\nWomen, through their training of their sons and daughters, hold the\r\nfuture of the world in their keeping. This training cannot be given by\r\nthe enactment of laws; we cannot legislate the control of human passion.\r\nThe law-maker bears no relation to the character builder.\r\n\r\n  \"They're no more like than hornet's nests and hives\r\n  Or printed sarmons be to holy lives.\"\r\n\r\nLaw can only prevent wrongdoing, it is negative at best, for its appeal\r\nin the end must be to fear, and a people ruled by fear becomes a race of\r\nslaves. In a free country it is impossible to enforce a law unless the\r\nwill of the people is behind it; and the moulding of this will, its\r\ntraining and development, must come in early childhood and must be done\r\nby its women. There is no greater sophistry than that women need the\r\nvote to protect themselves and one another from evil men. Were most men\r\nlibertines today, no law could be enforced against them. Were all men\r\nself-controlled and pure in heart, no law would be required. The failure\r\nof the women--the good women of the community--to bring up their sons to\r\nbe such men cannot be corrected by any short and easy road, nor can\r\ntheir responsibility for the present evil be obliterated by talk. Women\r\nhave failed to do their duty, and the only way to prevent further evil\r\nis to do that duty now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE A STEP TOWARD FEMINISM\r\n\r\nLILY RICE FOXCROFT\r\n\r\n    _Lily Rice Foxcroft, daughter of the late Rev. Dr. Charles B.\r\n    Rice of Danvers, Mass., for nearly twenty years Secretary of the\r\n    Congregational Board of Pastoral Supply; wife of Frank Foxcroft,\r\n    editor of \"The Living Age.\" Frequent contributor to the religious\r\n    press, the author of a volume entitled, \"While You Are a Girl,\"\r\n    and a well-known speaker in opposition to woman suffrage._\r\n                                                        _J. A. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strongest motive for anti-suffrage action is the deepening dread of\r\nwoman suffrage as a menace to the home. The radical suffragists have\r\nlittle use for the home, and the radical suffragists are young and\r\nbrilliant, and their following grows rapidly. It is they who are in the\r\npublic eye; whom the reporters interview; who, far more than the\r\nconservatives, are really influencing the thought of the day. They claim\r\nto be the consistent thinkers, reasoning from the common premise to\r\nconclusions from which \"older women\" shrink. They welcome with\r\nwhole-hearted enthusiasm the theory of \"economic independence.\"\r\n\r\nThis theory was first popularized by the _Woman's Journal_, in a notable\r\nseries of articles by Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, an associate\r\neditor, which appeared weekly in 1904, and of which the central thought\r\nwas, \"The woman should be in the home as much as the man is, no more.\"\r\nShe urged women to \"come out of their little monogamous harems,\"\r\npromised that \"when _all_ women are in industry, the conditions of\r\nindustry will be compelled to suit the conditions of maternity,\" and\r\npredicted the time when \"a man would no more think of having a woman\r\nbecome his house servant than a woman would think of marrying her butler\r\nand retaining him in that capacity.\" Mrs. Gilman summarized these ideas,\r\nagain, in a lecture in New York last year: \"The home of the future is\r\none in which not one stroke of work shall be done except by professional\r\npeople who are paid by the hour.\"\r\n\r\nThis theory meets so well the anti-suffrage argument that the woman,\r\nwhile spending most of her time within the home, cannot be expected to\r\nattain outside it a degree of efficiency equal to that of the man, that\r\nit naturally becomes part of the creed of the logical and consistent\r\nsuffragist. Miss Henrietta Rodman--a wife who, like Miss Fola La\r\nFollette, retains her maiden name, because taking that of a husband\r\n\"dwarfs individuality\"--gave to a reporter of the _Boston Herald_ last\r\nyear her opinion that \"a house is as demoralizing a place to stay in all\r\nday as a bed,\" and assured him that the ideal feminist apartment-house,\r\nwith its co-operative nursery on the top floor, had its plans actually\r\ndrawn, its site chosen. \"Trained staffs are to relieve women of the four\r\nprimitive industries--care of houses, clothes, food and children.\" \"By\r\nreal motherhood,\" said Miss Rodman, \"I do not mean washing the baby's\r\nclothes, preparing its food, watching over its sleep, nursing it through\r\nits baby illnesses, nor, in later years, darning the children's\r\nstockings, making or even mending their clothes, preparing their food or\r\nsupervising their education. All these things can be done better by\r\nexperts.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can follow the utterances of this group of suffragists without\r\nnoting the constant slight cast on \"domestic drudgery,\" and the\r\neagerness to prove other lines of activity better adapted to women.\r\n\"There is rising revolt among women,\" wrote Miss Edna Kenton, in _The\r\nCentury_ for November, 1913, \"against the unspeakable dullness of\r\nunvaried home life. It has been a long, deadly routine, a life-servitude\r\nimposed on her for ages in a man-made world.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosalie Jones, of \"hiking fame,\" who is now breaking into the\r\nautomobile business, says: \"There are idiot asylums in every state whose\r\ninmates are expert at darning and mending. Any one of those idiots\r\nsitting by the fireside could do the family mending, while the woman of\r\neducation, ingenuity and common sense, could utilize her faculties to\r\nthe betterment of her family and the country.... After suffrage is\r\ngranted, women will no longer be content to waste their brains in this\r\nmanner.\" Miss Inez Boissevain's \"Ten Minutes-a-Day Housekeeping\" is\r\nwell known, as is her declaration to the reporter that she \"should go\r\ncrazy if she had to do housework one whole day.\" \"Young children,\" she\r\nadmitted, \"need their mother. But,\" she added hopefully, \"the age at\r\nwhich they can be left with others is much less than it was formerly\r\nsupposed to be.\" Mrs. Rheta Childe Dorr, Mrs. Pankhurst's closest\r\ncompanion on her last United States tour, says: \"Men are not yet used to\r\nseeing their wives in the role of wage-earners. They'll have to get used\r\nto it, that's all.... I don't say that every married woman must go to\r\nwork outside her home. I should commit suicide if I had to spend my life\r\ndoing housework, but some women probably like to do it. Let them do it\r\nthen. All I ask is that every woman, married or single, should be\r\nallowed to choose the work in which she finds the most pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"To choose the work in which she finds the most pleasure\"--there is the\r\nreal individualistic note, sounded so often by the radical suffragists.\r\nIt is struck still more clearly when to the reporter's question: \"What\r\nabout the argument that the wife with a business career is apt to\r\ndeprive her husband of the joys of fatherhood?\" Mrs. Dorr replies: \"No\r\none but the individual woman herself has any right to decide whether or\r\nnot she shall have children. That is a question which she alone is\r\nentitled to settle.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same tone of contempt for the domestic round in which the average\r\nwife and mother has been accustomed to find her fair share of human\r\nsatisfaction, Mrs. Susan Fitzgerald wrote in the opening number of\r\n\"_Femina_\": \"Of course, some women don't want to do independent work;\r\nsome prefer the quiet routine and detail of the home and are satisfied\r\nto make a profession of its many little refinements, even as many men\r\nhave not the ambition to go into business for themselves.... But the\r\ncreative artist, whether in a profession or business, gets most of the\r\njoy of living out of the satisfaction that comes to him in his work, and\r\nso I say, do away with the prejudice against married women working\r\noutside their homes.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Alyse Gregory--who has campaigned for suffrage in Connecticut and\r\nNew Jersey with striking success--says: \"Girls should be self-supporting\r\nup to the time of their marriage, and after marriage up to the time when\r\nthey begin to bear children. During the child-bearing period there might\r\nbe some provision made for mothers by the State, as is now done in\r\nFrance; then all women who have reared families and who again find\r\nthemselves with leisure on their hands, should again be\r\nself-supporting.\" This, of course, is the Socialist view, and Miss\r\nGregory, like so many of the younger suffragists, is presumably a\r\nSocialist.\r\n\r\nAnother pronounced advocate of economic independence is Mrs. Havelock\r\nEllis--an English suffragist much feted on her visits to this\r\ncountry--of whom an admirer writes in the _Chicago Herald_, that \"she\r\nhas never accepted a penny from her husband since they were married.\" It\r\nwill be noticed that all these women are in professional work, in which\r\ntheir earnings may reasonably be expected to provide \"expert\" care for\r\ntheir children. Incidentally, does not that support the anti-suffrage\r\nclaim that the suffrage movement is gauged to the talents and habits of\r\nexceptional, rather than average, women, and that its principles are not\r\nthose under which the average woman's life finds its best development?\r\n\r\nThis tendency away from domestic life fosters the very evils which\r\nconservative suffragists hope to remedy by the vote. Even more startling\r\nis the tone taken in the discussion of \"sex problems.\" Interviewed on\r\nthe subject of \"war babies\" last summer by an enterprising syndicate\r\nwhich spread her views all over the country, Mrs. Rheta Childe Dorr\r\nsaid: \"There are always war babies at a time when normal restraints are\r\nremoved and slackened. After a great religious revival in any town there\r\nis an increased number of illegitimate children.... The government\r\nendowed immorality when it entered the war.... The government made war,\r\nthe war made war babies--then let the government take care of them.\"\r\n\r\nTo the same interviewer, Miss Eleanor Gates, of the Empire State\r\nCampaign Committee, said: \"It's unfortunate that the parents of these\r\nbabies did not take out licenses to be parents.... But more unfortunate,\r\nto my mind, than an omission of the license, is the fact that motherhood\r\nshould ever be counted a crime.... And, when all is said and done, I,\r\nmyself, respect the unmarried woman with a child more than I do the\r\nmarried woman with a poodle.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the utterances of conspicuous leaders of the younger, more\r\nradical wing of the woman suffrage movement; and no one who follows with\r\nany care their speeches and writings can claim that they are out of\r\ncharacter. Is it unfair to say such utterances confuse moral values and\r\nweaken the sense of individual responsibility?\r\n\r\nThis regret that \"motherhood should ever be counted a crime\" is often\r\nmore tersely expressed in the phrase \"right to motherhood,\" first made\r\nfashionable, I believe, by Mr. Bernard Shaw. It was given publicity last\r\nJune through an address made by Prof. W. I. Thomas of the University of\r\nChicago at the banquet held by the Chicago Equal Suffrage Association in\r\nhonor of the National Executive Council. Professor Thomas said, \"in\r\nsubstance\"--I quote the _Woman's Journal_--\"that many women who could\r\nnot marry were earnestly desirous of children, and that it ought to be\r\nrecognized that monogamy was not the only relation in which it was\r\nrespectable for a woman to have a child.\" The National Association, as\r\nis well known, is the conservative wing of the wrangling suffragist\r\narmy, and contains most of those \"middle-aged reformers\" whom the\r\n\"younger generation\" dispose of so easily by saying that they have not\r\nkept up with the times. Miss Alice Stone Blackwell promptly combatted\r\nthe speaker's opinions, and the _Woman's Journal_ reports that she was\r\nheartily applauded.\r\n\r\nBut Professor Thomas is not so easily disavowed. A ten-page pamphlet,\r\n\"Votes for Women,\" published by the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, is of his authorship. In _The Case for Woman Suffrage_, a\r\nbibliography with critical comments, published by the National College\r\nEqual Suffrage League in 1913, eighty-eight lines are given to\r\nquotations from Professor Thomas's works, while Miss Blackwell's receive\r\nonly forty. Such comparisons may seem trifling, but they are\r\nsignificant. If any one doubts the hold of the feminist ideas upon many\r\nof the most influential suffragists, he may be convinced by himself\r\nexamining _The Case for Woman Suffrage_. Anti-suffragists are often\r\naccused of arguing from isolated, casual utterances. For my part, I find\r\nit impossible to reproduce, by any quotations, the impression of\r\nrecklessness left by habitually reading publications, both American and\r\nEnglish, in sympathy with suffrage.\r\n\r\nOur age is not one that can afford to trifle with recklessness. Its own\r\nproblems are of the sort that call for prudence and restraint. The\r\nInternational Purity Congress in San Francisco has laterly drawn\r\nattention to the spread of immorality among school girls. Suffragists\r\noffer to \"mother the community.\" It is the individual girl that needs\r\nmothering. She is not helped to self-control by reading in her favorite\r\nnews-paper that Inez Haynes Gilmore, interviewed as to the use of \"obey\"\r\nin the marriage service, has said: \"To me the promise to love and honor\r\nis more extraordinary--it's easier to promise to obey. It's impossible\r\nto promise to control the emotions.\" The lesson the girl draws from a\r\nplay like Hindle Wakes, when Inez Milholland, in _McClure's_, calls her\r\nattention to it, is not that men must be as chaste as women, but that\r\nit is one of women's rights to be as lax as men.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thomas' views called forth resolutions from the Executive\r\nBoard of the National Suffrage Association, which took a curious form.\r\nThey read: \"While we do not wish to criticise the speaker's remarks as\r\nsuch, we heard them with profound misgivings as to their effect upon the\r\ncause of suffrage in the campaign states.\" The anti-suffrage majorities\r\nin the campaign states certainly proved the misgivings well-timed. But,\r\nhowever such remarks may have been received, is it not a significant\r\nfact that they were ventured, by a reputable man, at a reputable\r\ngathering? Can anyone doubt that radical views are startlingly on the\r\nincrease?\r\n\r\nTwo years ago Mrs. Winifred Harper Cooley wrote in _Harper's Weekly_ of\r\nthe \"single standard\": \"There is a violent altercation going on\r\ncontinually, within the ranks of feminists in all countries, regarding\r\nthis question. The conservative women reformers think the solution is in\r\nhauling men up to the standard of virginal purity that has always been\r\nset for women. The other branch, claiming to have a broader knowledge of\r\nhuman nature, asserts that it is impossible and perhaps undesirable to\r\nexpect asceticism from all men and women.\" In the _Forum_, of April,\r\n1915, a correspondent from California signing herself \"Lottie\r\nMontgomery,\" expanded in revolting detail what was, after all, pretty\r\nmuch the same idea. \"On every hand,\" she remarked, \"we hear of the\r\n'single standard of morals,' by which the 'purists' mean a strict\r\nmonogamous life for both men and women, and by which the feminists mean\r\nan opportunity to express themselves sexually whenever they see fit\r\nwithout the interference and permission of the Church and State, and\r\nthis neither constitutes promiscuity, nor yet polyandry, but an\r\nopportunity to live your own life in your own way and not to have to\r\nsacrifice your name, privacy, self-respect and income in order to\r\ngratify the sex instinct.\" And, passing from theory to practical\r\nobservation, she asserts: \"Whether we like to admit it or not, the fact\r\nremains that women today, from the mansion to the tenement, are\r\nacquiring sex experience outside of marriage, which accounts for the\r\ngreat mental strides they have made with the past two decades.\" In the\r\npublication, by a leading editor, of such sentiments, we have an\r\nalarming sign of the times.\r\n\r\nThere are too many such signs. Do we not all know long-established\r\nmagazines which have published, within the last five years, serials that\r\nthey would not have considered fifteen years ago?\r\n\r\nSays _Punch's_ reviewer of a recent heroine: \"Her point of view was\r\ntypified in her attitude toward the illicit and incidental motherhood of\r\none of her acquaintances. Without hearing the facts, she pronounced it\r\nto be 'a courageous stand against conventional morality,' which it just\r\npossibly might have proved to be upon enquiry, and by no means a weak\r\nsurrender to immediate desires, as much more probably it was in fact.\"\r\nThe author of _Angela's Business_ depicts precisely the same mental\r\nattitude in the crimson-faced woman at the Redmantle Club, who demands\r\nof Charles in an angry sort of way, \"Don't you favor a public reception\r\nimmediately to splendid Flora Travenna? Don't you think she's struck a\r\ngreat blow for freedom?\"--Flora Trevenna having just returned home after\r\nan absence of two years in the company of another woman's husband.\r\n\r\nOne of Robert Herrick's heroines prophesies--in line with Professor\r\nThomas--\"The time will come when single women like me, who work as men\r\nwork, will have the courage to love and bear children if they need--and\r\nmen will respect them.\"\r\n\r\nWill it be believed that an English magazine of fine literary quality,\r\nin which the work of Galsworthy and Arnold Bennett has often appeared,\r\nhas printed an article by a woman pleading for a public sentiment in\r\nfavor of irregular unions? \"Women will go a step further toward freedom\r\nthan men have dared to go,\" says Mrs. Walter Gallachan. \"I believe that\r\nif there were some open recognition of these partnerships outside of\r\nmarriage, not necessarily permanent, there would be many women who would\r\nbe willing to undertake such unions gladly; there would even be some\r\nwomen, as I believe, who would prefer them to the present system that\r\nbinds them permanently to one partner for life.\"\r\n\r\nTo many women these views seem so shocking that they cannot believe them\r\nto be widespread. I can only say that such women are leading \"sheltered\r\nlives.\" Said a conspicuous young feminist in an interview given to a\r\nBoston Sunday paper, \"It is both cruel and foolish (eugenically and\r\nethically) to prevent people from trying more than once to find their\r\nideal comrade for race propagation.\" The fiction of today is full of the\r\ndisgusting experiences of young persons trying to find their ideal\r\ncomrades. And an appalling number of these books bear marks of brilliant\r\ntalent, utterly unconscious of moral standards, \"studies of\r\nadolescence,\" many of them are. Illicit relations are entered on in the\r\nmost casual way and dropped as casually, and yet glorified as marking\r\nnew eras of \"development.\"\r\n\r\nI know, of course, the answer made by thoughtful, conscientious\r\nsuffragists who believe as strongly as I do in the integrity of the\r\nhome, when facts like these are brought to their attention. \"All\r\nsuffragists are not feminists. All feminism is not of this extreme sort.\r\nFeminism is nothing but a theory, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nEach of us must judge from her own observation; but it should be\r\nobservation, not merely of the lives of one's personal acquaintance, but\r\nof current thought and tendency. Many of us are convinced that an\r\nincreasing and influential number of suffragists are feminists, that a\r\ngreat deal of feminism is of this extreme sort, and that it is a\r\n\"theory\" which, through channels direct and indirect, is poisoning our\r\nliterature and our social life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT ANTI-SUFFRAGE PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n    (For pamphlets and leaflets on the various aspects of the question\r\n    address the Secretary of the Women's Anti-Suffrage Association,\r\n    Kensington Building. 687 Boylston Street, Boston.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS AND PAMPHLETS\r\n\r\n_James M.
