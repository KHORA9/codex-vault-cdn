The re-reading has convinced me that it\r\nought not to go to another impression without a word or two by way of\r\npreface with regard to the changes which our singular system of\r\nCongressional government has undergone since these pages were written.\r\n\r\nI must ask those who read them now to remember that they were written\r\nduring the years 1883 and 1884, and that, inasmuch as they describe a\r\nliving system, like all other living things subject to constant subtle\r\nmodifications, alike of form and of function, their description of the\r\ngovernment of the United States is not as accurate now as I believe it\r\nto have been at the time I wrote it.\r\n\r\nThis is, as might have been expected, more noticeable in matters of\r\ndetail than in matters of substance. There are now, for example, not\r\nthree hundred and twenty-five, but three hundred and fifty-seven members\r\nin the House of Representatives; and that number will, no doubt, be\r\nstill further increased by the reapportionment which will follow the\r\ncensus of the present year. The number of committees in both Senate and\r\nHouse is constantly on the increase. It is now usually quite sixty in\r\nthe House, and in the Senate more than forty. There has been a still\r\nfurther addition to the number of the \"spending\" committees in the House\r\nof Representatives, by the subdivision of the powerful Committee on\r\nAppropriations. Though the number of committees in nominal control of\r\nthe finances of the country is still as large as ever, the tendency is\r\nnow towards a concentration of all that is vital in the business into\r\nthe hands of a few of the more prominent, which are most often mentioned\r\nin the text. The auditing committees on the several departments, for\r\nexample, have now for some time exercised little more than a merely\r\nnominal oversight over executive expenditures.\r\n\r\nSince the text was written, the Tenure of Office Act, which sought to\r\nrestrict the President's removal from office, has been repealed; and\r\neven before its repeal it was, in fact, inoperative. After the time of\r\nPresident Johnson, against whom it was aimed, the party in power in\r\nCongress found little occasion to insist upon its enforcement; its\r\nconstitutionality was doubtful, and it fell into the background. I did\r\nnot make sufficient allowance for these facts in writing the one or two\r\nsentences of the book which refer to the Act.\r\n\r\nNeither did I give sufficient weight, I now believe, to the powers of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury. However minutely bound, guided,\r\nrestricted by statute, his power has proved at many a critical juncture\r\nin our financial history--notably in our recent financial history--of\r\nthe utmost consequence. Several times since this book was written, the\r\ncountry has been witness to his decisive influence upon the money\r\nmarkets, in the use of his authority with regard to the bond issues of\r\nthe government and his right to control the disposition of the funds of\r\nthe Treasury. In these matters, however, he has exercised, not\r\npolitical, but business power. He has helped the markets as a banker\r\nwould help them. He has altered no policy. He has merely made\r\narrangements which would release money for use and facilitate loan and\r\ninvestment. The country feels safer when an experienced banker, like Mr.\r\nGage, is at the head of the Treasury, than when an experienced\r\npolitician is in charge of it.\r\n\r\nAll these, however, are matters of detail. There are matters of\r\nsubstance to speak of also.\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted whether I could say quite so confidently now as I\r\nsaid in 1884 that the Senate of the United States faithfully represents\r\nthe several elements of the nation's makeup, and furnishes us with a\r\nprudent and normally constituted moderating and revising chamber.\r\nCertainly vested interests have now got a much more formidable hold upon\r\nthe Senate than they seemed to have sixteen years ago. Its political\r\ncharacter also has undergone a noticeable change. The tendency seems to\r\nbe to make of the Senate, instead of merely a smaller and more\r\ndeliberate House of Representatives, a body of successful party\r\nmanagers. Still, these features of its life may be temporary, and may\r\neasily be exaggerated. We do not yet know either whether they will\r\npersist, or, should they persist, whither they will lead us.\r\n\r\nA more important matter--at any rate, a thing more concrete and\r\nvisible--is the gradual integration of the organization of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The power of the Speaker has of late years taken on new\r\nphases. He is now, more than ever, expected to guide and control the\r\nwhole course of business in the House,--if not alone, at any rate\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the small Committee on Rules, of which he\r\nis chairman. That committee is expected not only to reformulate and\r\nrevise from time to time the permanent Rules of the House, but also to\r\nlook closely to the course of its business from day to day, make its\r\nprogramme, and virtually control its use of its time. The committee\r\nconsists of five members; but the Speaker and the two other members of\r\nthe committee who represent the majority in the House determine its\r\naction; and its action is allowed to govern the House. It in effect\r\nregulates the precedence of measures. Whenever occasion requires, it\r\ndetermines what shall, and what shall not, be undertaken. It is like a\r\nsteering ministry,--without a ministry's public responsibility, and\r\nwithout a ministry's right to speak for both houses. It is a private\r\npiece of party machinery within the single chamber for which it acts.\r\nThe Speaker himself--not as a member of the Committee on Rules, but by\r\nthe exercise of his right to \"recognize\" on the floor--undertakes to\r\ndetermine very absolutely what bills individual members shall be allowed\r\nto bring to a vote, out of the regular order fixed by the rules or\r\narranged by the Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\nThis obviously creates, in germ at least, a recognized and sufficiently\r\nconcentrated leadership within the House. The country is beginning to\r\nknow that the Speaker and the Committee on Rules must be held\r\nresponsible in all ordinary seasons for the success or failure of the\r\nsession, so far as the House is concerned. The congressional caucus has\r\nfallen a little into the background. It is not often necessary to call\r\nit together, except when the majority is impatient or recalcitrant under\r\nthe guidance of the Committee on Rules. To this new leadership,\r\nhowever, as to everything else connected with committee government, the\r\ntaint of privacy attaches. It is not leadership upon the open floor,\r\navowed, defended in public debate, set before the view and criticism of\r\nthe country. It integrates the House alone, not the Senate; does not\r\nunite the two houses in policy; affects only the chamber in which there\r\nis the least opportunity for debate, the least chance that\r\nresponsibility may be properly and effectively lodged and avowed. It has\r\nonly a very remote and partial resemblance to genuine party leadership.\r\n\r\nMuch the most important change to be noticed is the result of the war\r\nwith Spain upon the lodgment and exercise of power within our federal\r\nsystem: the greatly increased power and opportunity for constructive\r\nstatesmanship given the President, by the plunge into international\r\npolitics and into the administration of distant dependencies, which has\r\nbeen that war's most striking and momentous consequence. When foreign\r\naffairs play a prominent part in the politics and policy of a nation,\r\nits Executive must of necessity be its guide: must utter every initial\r\njudgment, take every first step of action, supply the information upon\r\nwhich it is to act, suggest and in large measure control its conduct.\r\nThe President of the United States is now, as of course, at the front of\r\naffairs, as no president, except Lincoln, has been since the first\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century, when the foreign relations of the new\r\nnation had first to be adjusted. There is no trouble now about getting\r\nthe President's speeches printed and read, every word. Upon his choice,\r\nhis character, his experience hang some of the most weighty issues of\r\nthe future. The government of dependencies must be largely in his hands.\r\nInteresting things may come out of the singular change.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, new prizes in public service may attract a new order of\r\ntalent. The nation may get a better civil service, because of the sheer\r\nnecessity we shall be under of organizing a service capable of carrying\r\nthe novel burdens we have shouldered.\r\n\r\nIt may be, too, that the new leadership of the Executive, inasmuch as it\r\nis likely to last, will have a very far-reaching effect upon our whole\r\nmethod of government. It may give the heads of the executive departments\r\na new influence upon the action of Congress. It may bring about, as a\r\nconsequence, an integration which will substitute statesmanship for\r\ngovernment by mass meeting. It may put this whole volume hopelessly out\r\nof date.\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\nPRINCETON UNIVERSITY, 15 _August_, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of these essays is not to exhaust criticism of the government\r\nof the United States, but only to point out the most characteristic\r\npractical features of the federal system. Taking Congress as the central\r\nand predominant power of the system, their object is to illustrate\r\neverything Congressional. Everybody has seen, and critics without number\r\nhave said, that our form of national government is singular, possessing\r\na character altogether its own; but there is abundant evidence that very\r\nfew have seen just wherein it differs most essentially from the other\r\ngovernments of the world. There have been and are other federal systems\r\nquite similar, and scarcely any legislative or administrative principle\r\nof our Constitution was young even when that Constitution was framed. It\r\nis our legislative and administrative _machinery_ which makes our\r\ngovernment essentially different from all other great governmental\r\nsystems. The most striking contrast in modern politics is not between\r\npresidential and monarchical governments, but between Congressional and\r\nParliamentary governments. Congressional government is Committee\r\ngovernment; Parliamentary government is government by a responsible\r\nCabinet Ministry. These are the two principal types which present\r\nthemselves for the instruction of the modern student of the practical in\r\npolitics: administration by semi-independent executive agents who obey\r\nthe dictation of a legislature to which they are not responsible, and\r\nadministration by executive agents who are the accredited leaders and\r\naccountable servants of a legislature virtually supreme in all things.\r\nMy chief aim in these essays has been, therefore, an adequate\r\nillustrative contrast of these two types of government, with a view to\r\nmaking as plain as possible the actual conditions of federal\r\nadministration. In short, I offer, not a commentary, but an outspoken\r\npresentation of such cardinal facts as may be sources of practical\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, _October_ 7, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Constitute government how you\r\n     please, infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the\r\n     exercise of powers, which are left at large to the prudence and\r\n     uprightness of ministers of state. Even all the use and potency of\r\n     the laws depends upon them. Without them your commonwealth is no\r\n     better than a scheme upon paper; and not a living, active,\r\n     effective organization.--BURKE.\r\n\r\n     The great fault of political writers is their too close adherence\r\n     to the forms of the system of state which they happen to be\r\n     expounding or examining. They stop short at the anatomy of\r\n     institutions, and do not penetrate to the secret of their\r\n     functions.--JOHN MORLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if a very wayward fortune had presided over the history\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, inasmuch as that great federal\r\ncharter has been alternately violated by its friends and defended by its\r\nenemies. It came hard by its establishment in the first place,\r\nprevailing with difficulty over the strenuous forces of dissent which\r\nwere banded against it. While its adoption was under discussion the\r\nvoices of criticism were many and authoritative, the voices of\r\nopposition loud in tone and ominous in volume, and the Federalists\r\nfinally triumphed only by dint of hard battle against foes, formidable\r\nboth in numbers and in skill. But the victory was complete,--astonishingly\r\ncomplete. Once established, the new government had only the zeal of its\r\nfriends to fear. Indeed, after its organization very little more is\r\nheard of the party of opposition; they disappear so entirely from\r\npolitics that one is inclined to think, in looking back at the party\r\nhistory of that time, that they must have been not only conquered but\r\nconverted as well. There was well-nigh universal acquiescence in the new\r\norder of things. Not everybody, indeed, professed himself a Federalist,\r\nbut everybody conformed to federalist practice. There were jealousies\r\nand bickerings, of course, in the new Congress of the Union, but no\r\nparty lines, and the differences which caused the constant brewing and\r\nbreaking of storms in Washington's first cabinet were of personal rather\r\nthan of political import. Hamilton and Jefferson did not draw apart\r\nbecause the one had been an ardent and the other only a lukewarm friend\r\nof the Constitution, so much as because they were so different in\r\nnatural bent and temper that they would have been like to disagree and\r\ncome to drawn points wherever or however brought into contact. The one\r\nhad inherited warm blood and a bold sagacity, while in the other a\r\nnegative philosophy ran suitably through cool veins. They had not been\r\nmeant for yoke-fellows.\r\n\r\nThere was less antagonism in Congress, however, than in the cabinet; and\r\nin none of the controversies that did arise was there shown any serious\r\ndisposition to quarrel with the Constitution itself; the contention was\r\nas to the obedience to be rendered to its provisions. No one threatened\r\nto withhold his allegiance, though there soon began to be some\r\nexhibition of a disposition to confine obedience to the letter of the\r\nnew commandments, and to discountenance all attempts to do what was not\r\nplainly written in the tables of the law. It was recognized as no longer\r\nfashionable to say aught against the principles of the Constitution; but\r\nall men could not be of one mind, and political parties began to take\r\nform in antagonistic schools of constitutional construction. There\r\nstraightway arose two rival sects of political Pharisees, each\r\nprofessing a more perfect conformity and affecting greater \"ceremonial\r\ncleanliness\" than the other. The very men who had resisted with might\r\nand main the adoption of the Constitution became, under the new division\r\nof parties, its champions, as sticklers for a strict, a rigid, and\r\nliteral construction.\r\n\r\nThey were consistent enough in this, because it was quite natural that\r\ntheir one-time fear of a strong central government should pass into a\r\ndread of the still further expansion of the power of that government, by\r\na too loose construction of its charter; but what I would emphasize here\r\nis not the motives or the policy of the conduct of parties in our early\r\nnational politics, but the fact that opposition to the Constitution as a\r\nconstitution, and even hostile criticism of its provisions, ceased\r\nalmost immediately upon its adoption; and not only ceased, but gave\r\nplace to an undiscriminating and almost blind worship of its principles,\r\nand of that delicate dual system of sovereignty, and that complicated\r\nscheme of double administration which it established. Admiration of that\r\none-time so much traversed body of law became suddenly all the vogue,\r\nand criticism was estopped. From the first, even down to the time\r\nimmediately preceding the war, the general scheme of the Constitution\r\nwent unchallenged; nullification itself did not always wear its true\r\ngarb of independent state sovereignty, but often masqueraded as a\r\nconstitutional right; and the most violent policies took care to make\r\nshow of at least formal deference to the worshipful fundamental law. The\r\ndivine right of kings never ran a more prosperous course than did this\r\nunquestioned prerogative of the Constitution to receive universal\r\nhomage. The conviction that our institutions were the best in the\r\nworld, nay more, the model to which all civilized states must sooner or\r\nlater conform, could not be laughed out of us by foreign critics, nor\r\nshaken out of us by the roughest jars of the system.\r\n\r\nNow there is, of course, nothing in all this that is inexplicable, or\r\neven remarkable; any one can see the reasons for it and the benefits of\r\nit without going far out of his way; but the point which it is\r\ninteresting to note is that we of the present generation are in the\r\nfirst season of free, outspoken, unrestrained constitutional criticism.\r\nWe are the first Americans to hear our own countrymen ask whether the\r\nConstitution is still adapted to serve the purposes for which it was\r\nintended; the first to entertain any serious doubts about the\r\nsuperiority of our own institutions as compared with the systems of\r\nEurope; the first to think of remodeling the administrative machinery of\r\nthe federal government, and of forcing new forms of responsibility upon\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe evident explanation of this change of attitude towards the\r\nConstitution is that we have been made conscious by the rude shock of\r\nthe war and by subsequent developments of policy, that there has been a\r\nvast alteration in the conditions of government; that the checks and\r\nbalances which once obtained are no longer effective; and that we are\r\nreally living under a constitution essentially different from that which\r\nwe have been so long worshiping as our own peculiar and incomparable\r\npossession. In short, this model government is no longer conformable\r\nwith its own original pattern. While we have been shielding it from\r\ncriticism it has slipped away from us. The noble charter of fundamental\r\nlaw given us by the Convention of 1787 is still our Constitution; but it\r\nis now our _form of government_ rather in name than in reality, the form\r\nof the Constitution being one of nicely adjusted, ideal balances, whilst\r\nthe actual form of our present government is simply a scheme of\r\ncongressional supremacy. National legislation, of course, takes force\r\nnow as at first from the authority of the Constitution; but it would be\r\neasy to reckon by the score acts of Congress which can by no means be\r\nsquared with that great instrument's evident theory. We continue to\r\nthink, indeed, according to long-accepted constitutional formulae, and\r\nit is still politically unorthodox to depart from old-time phraseology\r\nin grave discussions of affairs; but it is plain to those who look about\r\nthem that most of the commonly received opinions concerning federal\r\nconstitutional balances and administrative arrangements are many years\r\nbehind the actual practices of the government at Washington, and that\r\nwe are farther than most of us realize from the times and the policy of\r\nthe framers of the Constitution. It is a commonplace observation of\r\nhistorians that, in the development of constitutions, names are much\r\nmore persistent than the functions upon which they were originally\r\nbestowed; that institutions constantly undergo essential alterations of\r\ncharacter, whilst retaining the names conferred upon them in their first\r\nestate; and the history of our own Constitution is but another\r\nillustration of this universal principle of institutional change. There\r\nhas been a constant growth of legislative and administrative practice,\r\nand a steady accretion of precedent in the management of federal\r\naffairs, which have broadened the sphere and altered the functions of\r\nthe government without perceptibly affecting the vocabulary of our\r\nconstitutional language. Ours is, scarcely less than the British, a\r\nliving and fecund system. It does not, indeed, find its rootage so\r\nwidely in the hidden soil of unwritten law; its tap-root at least is the\r\nConstitution; but the Constitution is now, like Magna Carta and the Bill\r\nof Rights, only the sap-centre of a system of government vastly larger\r\nthan the stock from which it has branched,--a system some of whose forms\r\nhave only very indistinct and rudimental beginnings in the simple\r\nsubstance of the Constitution, and which exercises many functions\r\napparently quite foreign to the primitive properties contained in the\r\nfundamental law.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution itself is not a complete system; it takes none but the\r\nfirst steps in organization. It does little more than lay a foundation\r\nof principles. It provides with all possible brevity for the\r\nestablishment of a government having, in several distinct branches,\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial powers. It vests executive power in\r\na single chief magistrate, for whose election and inauguration it makes\r\ncarefully definite provision, and whose privileges and prerogatives it\r\ndefines with succinct clearness; it grants specifically enumerated\r\npowers of legislation to a representative Congress, outlining the\r\norganization of the two houses of that body and definitely providing for\r\nthe election of its members, whose number it regulates and the\r\nconditions of whose choice it names; and it establishes a Supreme Court\r\nwith ample authority of constitutional interpretation, prescribing the\r\nmanner in which its judges shall be appointed and the conditions of\r\ntheir official tenure. Here the Constitution's work of organization\r\nends, and the fact that it attempts nothing more is its chief strength.\r\nFor it to go beyond elementary provisions would be to lose elasticity\r\nand adaptability. The growth of the nation and the consequent\r\ndevelopment of the governmental system would snap asunder a\r\nconstitution which could not adapt itself to the new conditions of an\r\nadvancing society. If it could not stretch itself to the measure of the\r\ntimes, it must be thrown off and left behind, as a by-gone device; and\r\nthere can, therefore, be no question that our Constitution has proved\r\nlasting because of its simplicity. It is a corner-stone, not a complete\r\nbuilding; or, rather, to return to the old figure, it is a root, not a\r\nperfect vine.\r\n\r\nThe chief fact, therefore, of our national history is that from this\r\nvigorous tap-root has grown a vast constitutional system,--a system\r\nbranching and expanding in statutes and judicial decisions, as well as\r\nin unwritten precedent; and one of the most striking facts, as it seems\r\nto me, in the history of our politics is, that that system has never\r\nreceived complete and competent critical treatment at the hands of any,\r\neven the most acute, of our constitutional writers. They view it, as it\r\nwere, from behind. Their thoughts are dominated, it would seem, by those\r\nincomparable papers of the \"Federalist,\" which, though they were written\r\nto influence only the voters of 1788, still, with a strange, persistent\r\nlongevity of power, shape the constitutional criticism of the present\r\nday, obscuring much of that development of constitutional practice which\r\nhas since taken place. The Constitution in operation is manifestly a\r\nvery different thing from the Constitution of the books. \"An observer\r\nwho looks at the living reality will wonder at the contrast to the paper\r\ndescription. He will see in the life much which is not in the books; and\r\nhe will not find in the rough practice many refinements of the literary\r\ntheory.\"[1] It is, therefore, the difficult task of one who would now\r\nwrite at once practically and critically of our national government to\r\nescape from theories and attach himself to facts, not allowing himself\r\nto be confused by a knowledge of what that government was intended to\r\nbe, or led away into conjectures as to what it may one day become, but\r\nstriving to catch its present phases and to photograph the delicate\r\norganism in all its characteristic parts exactly as it is to-day; an\r\nundertaking all the more arduous and doubtful of issue because it has to\r\nbe entered upon without guidance from writers of acknowledged authority.\r\n\r\nThe leading inquiry in the examination of any system of government must,\r\nof course, concern primarily the real depositaries and the essential\r\nmachinery of power. There is always a centre of power: where in this\r\nsystem is that centre? in whose hands is self-sufficient authority\r\nlodged, and through what agencies does that authority speak and act?\r\nThe answers one gets to these and kindred questions from authoritative\r\nmanuals of constitutional exposition are not satisfactory, chiefly\r\nbecause they are contradicted by self-evident facts. It is said that\r\nthere is no single or central force in our federal _scheme_; and so\r\nthere is not in the federal scheme, but only a balance of powers and a\r\nnice adjustment of interactive checks, as all the books say. How is it,\r\nhowever, in the practical conduct of the federal government? In that,\r\nunquestionably, the predominant and controlling force, the centre and\r\nsource of all motive and of all regulative power, is Congress. All\r\nniceties of constitutional restriction and even many broad principles of\r\nconstitutional limitation have been overridden, and a thoroughly\r\norganized system of congressional control set up which gives a very rude\r\nnegative to some theories of balance and some schemes for distributed\r\npowers, but which suits well with convenience, and does violence to none\r\nof the principles of self-government contained in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis fact, however, though evident enough, is not on the surface. It\r\ndoes not obtrude itself upon the observation of the world. It runs\r\nthrough the undercurrents of government, and takes shape only in the\r\ninner channels of legislation and administration which are not open to\r\nthe common view. It can be discerned most readily by comparing the\r\n\"literary theory\" of the Constitution with the actual machinery of\r\nlegislation, especially at those points where that machinery regulates\r\nthe relations of Congress with the executive departments, and with the\r\nattitude of the houses towards the Supreme Court on those occasions,\r\nhappily not numerous, when legislature and judiciary have come face to\r\nface in direct antagonism. The \"literary theory\" is distinct enough;\r\nevery American is familiar with the paper pictures of the Constitution.\r\nMost prominent in such pictures are the ideal checks and balances of the\r\nfederal system, which may be found described, even in the most recent\r\nbooks, in terms substantially the same as those used in 1814 by John\r\nAdams in his letter to John Taylor. \"Is there,\" says Mr. Adams, \"a\r\nconstitution upon record more complicated with balances than ours? In\r\nthe first place, eighteen states and some territories are balanced\r\nagainst the national government.... In the second place, the House of\r\nRepresentatives is balanced against the Senate, the Senate against the\r\nHouse. In the third place, the executive authority is, in some degree,\r\nbalanced against the legislative. In the fourth place, the judicial\r\npower is balanced against the House, the Senate, the executive power,\r\nand the state governments. In the fifth place, the Senate is balanced\r\nagainst the President in all appointments to office, and in all\r\ntreaties.... In the sixth place, the people hold in their hands the\r\nbalance against their own representatives, by biennial ... elections. In\r\nthe seventh place, the legislatures of the several states are balanced\r\nagainst the Senate by sextennial elections. In the eighth place, the\r\nelectors are balanced against the people in the choice of the President.\r\nHere is a complicated refinement of balances, which, for anything I\r\nrecollect, is an invention of our own and peculiar to us.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAll of these balances are reckoned essential in the theory of the\r\nConstitution; but none is so quintessential as that between the national\r\nand the state governments; it is the pivotal quality of the system,\r\nindicating its principal, which is its federal characteristic. The\r\nobject of this balance of thirty-eight States \"and some territories\"\r\nagainst the powers of the federal government, as also of several of the\r\nother balances enumerated, is not, it should be observed, to prevent the\r\ninvasion by the national authorities of those provinces of legislation\r\nby plain expression or implication reserved to the States,--such as the\r\nregulation of municipal institutions, the punishment of ordinary crimes,\r\nthe enactment of laws of inheritance and of contract, the erection and\r\nmaintenance of the common machinery of education, and the control of\r\nother such like matters of social economy and every-day\r\nadministration,--but to check and trim national policy on national\r\nquestions, to turn Congress back from paths of dangerous encroachment on\r\nmiddle or doubtful grounds of jurisdiction, to keep sharp, when it was\r\nlike to become dim, the line of demarcation between state and federal\r\nprivilege, to readjust the weights of jurisdiction whenever either state\r\nor federal scale threatened to kick the beam. There never was any great\r\nlikelihood that the national government would care to take from the\r\nStates their plainer prerogatives, but there was always a violent\r\nprobability that it would here and there steal a march over the borders\r\nwhere territory like its own invited it to appropriation; and it was for\r\na mutual defense of such border-land that the two governments were given\r\nthe right to call a halt upon one another. It was purposed to guard not\r\nagainst revolution, but against unrestrained exercise of questionable\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the restraining power of the States was relied upon\r\nin the days of the Convention, and of the adoption of the Constitution,\r\nis strikingly illustrated in several of the best known papers of the\r\n\"Federalist;\" and there is no better means of realizing the difference\r\nbetween the actual and the ideal constitutions than this of placing\r\none's self at the point of view of the public men of 1787-89. They were\r\ndisgusted with the impotent and pitiable Confederation, which could do\r\nnothing but beg and deliberate; they longed to get away from the selfish\r\nfeuds of \"States dissevered, discordant, belligerent,\" and their hopes\r\nwere centred in the establishment of a strong and lasting union, such as\r\ncould secure that concert and facility of common action in which alone\r\nthere could be security and amity. They were, however, by no means sure\r\nof being able to realize their hopes, contrive how they might to bring\r\nthe States together into a more perfect confederation. The late colonies\r\nhad but recently become compactly organized, self-governing States, and\r\nwere standing somewhat stiffly apart, a group of consequential\r\nsovereignties, jealous to maintain their blood-bought prerogatives, and\r\nquick to distrust any power set above them, or arrogating to itself the\r\ncontrol of their restive wills. It was not to be expected that the\r\nsturdy, self-reliant, masterful men who had won independence for their\r\nnative colonies, by passing through the flames of battle, and through\r\nthe equally fierce fires of bereavement and financial ruin, would\r\nreadily transfer their affection and allegiance from the new-made\r\nStates, which were their homes, to the federal government, which was to\r\nbe a mere artificial creation, and which could be to no man as his home\r\ngovernment. As things looked then, it seemed idle to apprehend a too\r\ngreat diminution of state rights: there was every reason, on the\r\ncontrary, to fear that any union that could be agreed upon would lack\r\nboth vitality and the ability to hold its ground against the jealous\r\nself-assertion of the sovereign commonwealths of its membership.\r\nHamilton but spoke the common belief of all thinking men of the time\r\nwhen he said: \"It will always be far more easy for the state governments\r\nto encroach upon the national authorities than for the national\r\ngovernment to encroach upon the state authorities;\" and he seemed to\r\nfurnish abundant support for the opinion, when he added, that \"the proof\r\nof this proposition turns upon the greater degree of influence which the\r\nstate governments, if they administer their affairs uprightly and\r\nprudently, will generally possess over the people; a circumstance which,\r\nat the same time, teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic\r\nweakness in all federal constitutions, and that too much pains cannot\r\nbe taken in their organization to give them all the force that is\r\ncompatible with the principles of liberty.\"[3]\r\n\r\nRead in the light of the present day, such views constitute the most\r\nstriking of all commentaries upon our constitutional history. Manifestly\r\nthe powers reserved to the States were expected to serve as a very real\r\nand potent check upon the federal government; and yet we can see plainly\r\nenough now that this balance of state against national authorities has\r\nproved, of all constitutional checks, the least effectual. The proof of\r\nthe pudding is the eating thereof, and we can nowadays detect in it none\r\nof that strong flavor of state sovereignty which its cooks thought they\r\nwere giving it. It smacks, rather, of federal omnipotence, which they\r\nthought to mix in only in very small and judicious quantities. \"From the\r\nnature of the case,\" as Judge Cooley says, \"it was impossible that the\r\npowers reserved to the States should constitute a restraint upon the\r\nincrease of federal power, to the extent that was at first expected. The\r\nfederal government was necessarily made the final judge of its own\r\nauthority, and the executor of its own will, and any effectual check to\r\nthe gradual amplification of its jurisdiction must therefore be found\r\nin the construction put by those administering it upon the grants of the\r\nConstitution, and in their own sense of constitutional obligation. And\r\nas the true line of division between federal and state powers has, from\r\nthe very beginning, been the subject of contention and of honest\r\ndifferences of opinion, it must often happen that to advance and occupy\r\nsome disputed ground will seem to the party having the power to do so a\r\nmere matter of constitutional duty.\"[4]\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the new national government there was,\r\ndoubtless, much potency in state will; and had federal and state powers\r\nthen come face to face, before Congress and the President had had time\r\nto overcome their first awkwardness and timidity, and to discover the\r\nsafest walks of their authority and the most effectual means of\r\nexercising their power, it is probable that state prerogatives would\r\nhave prevailed. The central government, as every one remembers, did not\r\nat first give promise of a very great career. It had inherited some of\r\nthe contempt which had attached to the weak Congress of the\r\nConfederation. Two of the thirteen States held aloof from the Union\r\nuntil they could be assured of its stability and success; many of the\r\nother States had come into it reluctantly, all with a keen sense of\r\nsacrifice, and there could not be said to be any very wide-spread or\r\nundoubting belief in its ultimate survival. The members of the first\r\nCongress, too, came together very tardily, and in no very cordial or\r\nconfident spirit of cooperation; and after they had assembled they were\r\nfor many months painfully embarrassed, how and upon what subjects to\r\nexercise their new and untried functions. The President was denied\r\nformal precedence in dignity by the Governor of New York, and must\r\nhimself have felt inclined to question the consequence of his official\r\nstation, when he found that amongst the principal questions with which\r\nhe had to deal were some which concerned no greater things than petty\r\npoints of etiquette and ceremonial; as, for example, whether one day in\r\nthe week would be sufficient to receive visits of compliment, \"and what\r\nwould be said if he were sometimes to be seen at quiet tea-parties.\"[5]\r\nBut this first weakness of the new government was only a transient phase\r\nin its history, and the federal authorities did not invite a direct\r\nissue with the States until they had had time to reckon their resources\r\nand to learn facility of action. Before Washington left the presidential\r\nchair the federal government had been thoroughly organized, and it fast\r\ngathered strength and confidence as it addressed itself year after year\r\nto the adjustment of foreign relations, to the defense of the western\r\nfrontiers, and to the maintenance of domestic peace. For twenty-five\r\nyears it had no chance to think of those questions of internal policy\r\nwhich, in later days, were to tempt it to stretch its constitutional\r\njurisdiction. The establishment of the public credit, the revival of\r\ncommerce, and the encouragement of industry; the conduct, first, of a\r\nheated controversy, and finally of an unequal war with England; the\r\navoidance, first, of too much love, and afterwards of too violent hatred\r\nof France; these and other like questions of great pith and moment gave\r\nit too much to do to leave it time to think of nice points of\r\nconstitutional theory affecting its relations with the States.\r\n\r\nBut still, even in those busy times of international controversy, when\r\nthe lurid light of the French Revolution outshone all others, and when\r\nmen's minds were full of those ghosts of '76, which took the shape of\r\nBritish aggressions, and could not be laid by any charm known to\r\ndiplomacy,--even in those times, busy about other things, there had been\r\npremonitions of the unequal contest between state and federal\r\nauthorities. The purchase of Louisiana had given new form and startling\r\nsignificance to the assertion of national sovereignty, the Alien and\r\nSedition Laws had provoked the plain-spoken and emphatic protests of\r\nKentucky and Virginia, and the Embargo had exasperated New England to\r\nthreats of secession.\r\n\r\nNor were these open assumptions of questionable prerogatives on the part\r\nof the national government the most significant or unequivocal\r\nindications of an assured increase of federal power. Hamilton, as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, had taken care at the very beginning to set\r\nthe national policy in ways which would unavoidably lead to an almost\r\nindefinite expansion of the sphere of federal legislation. Sensible of\r\nits need of guidance in those matters of financial administration which\r\nevidently demanded its immediate attention, the first Congress of the\r\nUnion promptly put itself under the direction of Hamilton. \"It is not a\r\nlittle amusing,\" says Mr. Lodge, \"to note how eagerly Congress, which\r\nhad been ably and honestly struggling with the revenue, with commerce,\r\nand with a thousand details, fettered in all things by the awkwardness\r\ninherent in a legislative body, turned for relief to the new\r\nsecretary.\"[6] His advice was asked and taken in almost everything, and\r\nhis skill as a party leader made easy many of the more difficult paths\r\nof the new government. But no sooner had the powers of that government\r\nbegun to be exercised under his guidance than they began to grow. In his\r\nfamous Report on Manufactures were laid the foundations of that system\r\nof protective duties which was destined to hang all the industries of\r\nthe country upon the skirts of the federal power, and to make every\r\ntrade and craft in the land sensitive to every wind of party that might\r\nblow at Washington; and in his equally celebrated Report in favor of the\r\nestablishment of a National Bank, there was called into requisition, for\r\nthe first time, that puissant doctrine of the \"implied powers\" of the\r\nConstitution which has ever since been the chief dynamic principle in\r\nour constitutional history. \"This great doctrine, embodying the\r\nprinciple of liberal construction, was,\" in the language of Mr. Lodge,\r\n\"the most formidable weapon in the armory of the Constitution; and when\r\nHamilton grasped it he knew, and his opponents felt, that here was\r\nsomething capable of conferring on the federal government powers of\r\nalmost any extent.\"[7] It served first as a sanction for the charter of\r\nthe United States Bank,--an institution which was the central pillar of\r\nHamilton's wonderful financial administration, and around which\r\nafterwards, as then, played so many of the lightnings of party strife.\r\nBut the Bank of the United States, though great, was not the greatest\r\nof the creations of that lusty and seductive doctrine. Given out, at\r\nlength, with the sanction of the federal Supreme Court,[8] and\r\ncontaining, as it did, in its manifest character as a doctrine of\r\nlegislative prerogative, a very vigorous principle of constitutional\r\ngrowth, it quickly constituted Congress the dominant, nay, the\r\nirresistible, power of the federal system, relegating some of the chief\r\nbalances of the Constitution to an insignificant role in the \"literary\r\ntheory\" of our institutions.\r\n\r\nIts effect upon the status of the States in the federal system was\r\nseveral-fold. In the first place, it clearly put the constitutions of\r\nthe States at a great disadvantage, inasmuch as there was in them no\r\nlike principle of growth. Their stationary sovereignty could by no means\r\nkeep pace with the nimble progress of federal influence in the new\r\nspheres thus opened up to it. The doctrine of implied powers was\r\nevidently both facile and irresistible. It concerned the political\r\ndiscretion of the national legislative power, and could, therefore,\r\nelude all obstacles of judicial interference; for the Supreme Court very\r\nearly declared itself without authority to question the legislature's\r\nprivilege of determining the nature and extent of its own powers in the\r\nchoice of means for giving effect to its constitutional prerogatives,\r\nand it has long stood as an accepted canon of judicial action, that\r\njudges should be very slow to oppose their opinions to the legislative\r\nwill in cases in which it is not made demonstrably clear that there has\r\nbeen a plain violation of some unquestionable constitutional principle,\r\nor some explicit constitutional provision. Of encroachments upon state\r\nas well as of encroachments upon federal powers, the federal authorities\r\nare, however, in most cases the only, and in all cases the final,\r\njudges. The States are absolutely debarred even from any effective\r\ndefense of their plain prerogatives, because not they, but the national\r\nauthorities, are commissioned to determine with decisive and\r\nunchallenged authoritativeness what state powers shall be recognized in\r\neach case of contest or of conflict. In short, one of the privileges\r\nwhich the States have resigned into the hands of the federal government\r\nis the all-inclusive privilege of determining what they themselves can\r\ndo. Federal courts can annul state action, but state courts cannot\r\narrest the growth of congressional power.[9]\r\n\r\nBut this is only the doctrinal side of the case, simply its statement\r\nwith an \"if\" and a \"but.\" Its practical issue illustrates still more\r\nforcibly the altered and declining status of the States in the\r\nconstitutional system. One very practical issue has been to bring the\r\npower of the federal government home to every man's door, as, no less\r\nthan his own state government, his immediate over-lord. Of course every\r\nnew province into which Congress has been allured by the principle of\r\nimplied powers has required for its administration a greater or less\r\nenlargement of the national civil service, which now, through its\r\nhundred thousand officers, carries into every community of the land a\r\nsense of federal power, as the power of powers, and fixes the federal\r\nauthority, as it were, in the very habits of society. That is not a\r\nforeign but a familiar and domestic government whose officer is your\r\nnext-door neighbor, whose representatives you deal with every day at the\r\npost-office and the custom-house, whose courts sit in your own State,\r\nand send their own marshals into your own county to arrest your own\r\nfellow-townsman, or to call you yourself by writ to their\r\nwitness-stands. And who can help respecting officials whom he knows to\r\nbe backed by the authority and even, by the power of the whole nation,\r\nin the performance of the duties in which he sees them every day\r\nengaged? Who does not feel that the marshal represents a greater power\r\nthan the sheriff does, and that it is more dangerous to molest a\r\nmail-carrier than to knock down a policeman? This personal contact of\r\nevery citizen with the federal government,--a contact which makes him\r\nfeel himself a citizen of a greater state than that which controls his\r\nevery-day contracts and probates his father's will,--more than offsets\r\nhis sense of dependent loyalty to local authorities by creating a\r\nsensible bond of allegiance to what presents itself unmistakably as the\r\ngreater and more sovereign power.\r\n\r\nIn most things this bond of allegiance does not bind him oppressively\r\nnor chafe him distressingly; but in some things it is drawn rather\r\npainfully tight. Whilst federal postmasters are valued and federal\r\njudges unhesitatingly obeyed, and whilst very few people realize the\r\nweight of customs-duties, and as few, perhaps, begrudge license taxes on\r\nwhiskey and tobacco, everybody eyes rather uneasily the federal\r\nsupervisors at the polls. This is preeminently a country of frequent\r\nelections, and few States care to increase the frequency by separating\r\nelections of state from elections of national functionaries. The federal\r\nsupervisor, consequently, who oversees the balloting for congressmen,\r\npractically superintends the election of state officers also; for state\r\nofficers and congressmen are usually voted for at one and the same time\r\nand place, by ballots bearing in common an entire \"party ticket;\" and\r\nany authoritative scrutiny of these ballots after they have been cast,\r\nor any peremptory power of challenging those who offer to cast them,\r\nmust operate as an interference with state no less than with federal\r\nelections. The authority of Congress to regulate the manner of choosing\r\nfederal representatives pinches when it is made thus to include also the\r\nsupervision of those state elections which are, by no implied power\r\neven, within the sphere of federal prerogative. The supervisor\r\nrepresents the very ugliest side of federal supremacy; he belongs to\r\nthe least liked branch of the civil service; but his existence speaks\r\nvery clearly as to the present balance of powers, and his rather hateful\r\nprivileges must, under the present system of mixed elections, result in\r\nimpairing the self-respect of state officers of election by bringing\r\nhome to them a vivid sense of subordination to the powers at Washington.\r\n\r\nA very different and much larger side of federal predominance is to be\r\nseen in the history of the policy of internal improvements. I need not\r\nexpound that policy here. It has been often enough mooted and long\r\nenough understood to need no explanation. Its practice is plain and its\r\npersistence unquestionable. But its bearings upon the status and the\r\npolicies of the States are not always clearly seen or often distinctly\r\npointed out. Its chief results, of course, have been that expansion of\r\nnational functions which was necessarily involved in the application of\r\nnational funds by national employees to the clearing of inland\r\nwater-courses and the improvement of harbors, and the establishment of\r\nthe very questionable precedent of expending in favored localities\r\nmoneys raised by taxation which bears with equal incidence upon the\r\npeople of all sections of the country; but these chief results by no\r\nmeans constitute the sum of its influence. Hardly less significant and\r\nreal, for instance, are its moral effects in rendering state\r\nadministrations less self-reliant and efficient, less prudent and\r\nthrifty, by accustoming them to accepting subsidies for internal\r\nimprovements from the federal coffers; to depending upon the national\r\nrevenues, rather than upon their own energy and enterprise, for means of\r\ndeveloping those resources which it should be the special province of\r\nstate administration to make available and profitable. There can, I\r\nsuppose, be little doubt that it is due to the moral influences of this\r\npolicy that the States are now turning to the common government for aid\r\nin such things as education. Expecting to be helped, they will not help\r\nthemselves. Certain it is that there is more than one State which,\r\nthough abundantly able to pay for an educational system of the greatest\r\nefficiency, fails to do so, and contents itself with imperfect temporary\r\nmakeshifts because there are immense surpluses every year in the\r\nnational treasury which, rumor and unauthorized promises say, may be\r\ndistributed amongst the States in aid of education. If the federal\r\ngovernment were more careful to keep apart from every strictly local\r\nscheme of improvement, this culpable and demoralizing state policy could\r\nscarcely live. States would cease to wish, because they would cease to\r\nhope, to be stipendiaries of the government of the Union, and would\r\naddress themselves with diligence to their proper duties, with much\r\nbenefit both to themselves and to the federal system. This is not saying\r\nthat the policy of internal improvements was either avoidable,\r\nunconstitutional, or unwise, but only that it has been carried too far;\r\nand that, whether carried too far or not, it must in any case have been\r\nwhat it is now seen to be, a big weight in the federal scale of the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nStill other powers of the federal government, which have so grown beyond\r\ntheir first proportions as to have marred very seriously the symmetry of\r\nthe \"literary theory\" of our federal system, have strengthened under the\r\nshadow of the jurisdiction of Congress over commerce and the maintenance\r\nof the postal service. For instance, the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates has declared that the powers granted to Congress by the\r\nConstitution to regulate commerce and to establish post-offices and\r\npost-roads \"keep pace with the progress of the country and adapt\r\nthemselves to new developments of times and circumstances. They extend\r\nfrom the horse with its rider to the stage-coach, from the sailing\r\nvessel to the steamer, from the coach and the steamer to the railroad,\r\nand from the railroad to the telegraph, as these new agencies are\r\nsuccessively brought into use to meet the demands of increasing\r\npopulation and wealth. They are intended for the government of the\r\nbusiness to which they relate, at all times and under all circumstances.\r\nAs they were intrusted to the general government for the good of the\r\nnation, it is not only the right but the duty of Congress to see to it\r\nthat the intercourse between the States and the transmission of\r\nintelligence are not obstructed or unnecessarily encumbered by state\r\nlegislation.\"[10] This emphatic decision was intended to sustain the\r\nright of a telegraph company chartered by one State to run its line\r\nalong all post-roads in other States, without the consent of those\r\nStates, and even against their will; but it is manifest that many other\r\ncorporate companies might, under the sanction of this broad opinion,\r\nclaim similar privileges in despite of state resistance, and that such\r\ndecisions go far towards making state powers of incorporation of little\r\nworth as compared with federal powers of control.\r\n\r\nKeeping pace, too, with this growth of federal activity, there has been\r\nfrom the first a steady and unmistakable growth of nationality of\r\nsentiment. It was, of course, the weight of war which finally and\r\ndecisively disarranged the balance between state and federal powers; and\r\nit is obvious that many of the most striking manifestations of the\r\ntendency towards centralization have made themselves seen since the\r\nwar. But the history of the war is only a record of the triumph of the\r\nprinciple of national sovereignty. The war was inevitable, because that\r\nprinciple grew apace; and the war ended as it did, because that\r\nprinciple had become predominant. Accepted at first simply because it\r\nwas imperatively necessary, the union of form and of law had become a\r\nunion of sentiment, and was destined to be a union of institutions. That\r\nsense of national unity and community of destiny which Hamilton had\r\nsought to foster, but which was feeble in his day of long distances and\r\ntardy inter-communication, when the nation's pulse was as slow as the\r\nstage-coach and the postman, had become strong enough to rule the\r\ncontinent when Webster died. The war between the States was the supreme\r\nand final struggle between those forces of disintegration which still\r\nremained in the blood of the body politic and those other forces of\r\nhealth, of union and amalgamation, which had been gradually building up\r\nthat body in vigor and strength as the system passed from youth to\r\nmaturity, and as its constitution hardened and ripened with advancing\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe history of that trenchant policy of \"reconstruction,\" which followed\r\nclose upon the termination of the war, as at once its logical result and\r\nsignificant commentary, contains a vivid picture of the altered\r\nbalances of the constitutional system which is a sort of exaggerated\r\nminiature, falling very little short of being a caricature, of previous\r\nconstitutional tendencies and federal policies. The tide of federal\r\naggression probably reached its highest shore in the legislation which\r\nput it into the power of the federal courts to punish a state judge for\r\nrefusing, in the exercise of his official discretion, to impanel negroes\r\nin the juries of his court,[11] and in those statutes which gave the\r\nfederal courts jurisdiction over offenses against state laws by state\r\nofficers.[12] But that tide has often run very high, and, however\r\nfluctuating at times, has long been well-nigh irresistible by any dykes\r\nof constitutional state privilege; so that Judge Cooley can say without\r\nfear of contradiction that \"The effectual checks upon the encroachments\r\nof federal upon state power must be looked for, not in state power of\r\nresistance, but in the choice of representatives, senators, and\r\npresidents holding just constitutional views, and in a federal supreme\r\ncourt with competent power to restrain all departments and all officers\r\nwithin the limits of their just authority, so far as their acts may\r\nbecome the subject of judicial cognizance.\"[13]\r\n\r\nIndeed it is quite evident that if federal power be not altogether\r\nirresponsible, it is the federal judiciary which is the only effectual\r\nbalance-wheel of the whole system. The federal judges hold in their\r\nhands the fate of state powers, and theirs is the only authority that\r\ncan draw effective rein on the career of Congress. If their power, then,\r\nbe not efficient, the time must seem sadly out of joint to those who\r\nhold to the \"literary theory\" of our Constitution. By the word of the\r\nSupreme Court must all legislation stand or fall, so long as law is\r\nrespected. But, as I have already pointed out, there is at least one\r\nlarge province of jurisdiction upon which, though invited, and possibly\r\nprivileged to appropriate it, the Supreme Court has, nevertheless,\r\nrefused to enter, and by refusing to enter which it has given over all\r\nattempt to guard one of the principal, easiest, and most obvious roads\r\nto federal supremacy. It has declared itself without authority to\r\ninterfere with the _political discretion_ of either Congress or the\r\nPresident, and has declined all effort to constrain these its coordinate\r\ndepartments to the performance of any, even the most constitutionally\r\nimperative act.[14] \"When, indeed, the President exceeds his authority,\r\nor usurps that which belongs to one of the other departments, his\r\norders, commands, or warrants protect no one, and his agents become\r\npersonally responsible for their acts. The check of the courts,\r\ntherefore, consists in their ability to keep the executive within the\r\nsphere of his authority by refusing to give the sanction of law to\r\nwhatever he may do beyond it, and by holding the agents or instruments\r\nof his unlawful action to strict accountability.\"[15] But such\r\npunishment, inflicted not directly upon the chief offender but\r\nvicariously upon his agents, can come only after all the harm has been\r\ndone. The courts cannot forestall the President and prevent the doing of\r\nmischief. They have no power of initiative; they must wait until the law\r\nhas been broken and voluntary litigants have made up their pleadings;\r\nmust wait nowadays many months, often many years, until those pleadings\r\nare reached in the regular course of clearing a crowded docket.\r\n\r\nBesides, in ordinary times it is not from the executive that the most\r\ndangerous encroachments are to be apprehended. The legislature is the\r\naggressive spirit. It is the motive power of the government, and unless\r\nthe judiciary can check it, the courts are of comparatively little worth\r\nas balance-wheels in the system. It is the subtile, stealthy, almost\r\nimperceptible encroachments of policy, of political action, which\r\nconstitute the precedents upon which additional prerogatives are\r\ngenerally reared; and yet these are the very encroachments with which it\r\nis hardest for the courts to deal, and concerning which, accordingly,\r\nthe federal courts have declared themselves unauthorized to hold any\r\nopinions. They have naught to say upon questions of policy. Congress\r\nmust itself judge what measures may legitimately be used to supplement\r\nor make effectual its acknowledged jurisdiction, what are the laws\r\n\"necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" its own peculiar\r\npowers, \"and all other powers vested by\" the \"Constitution in the\r\ngovernment of the United States, or in any department or officer\r\nthereof.\" The courts are very quick and keen-eyed, too, to discern\r\nprerogatives of political discretion in legislative acts, and\r\nexceedingly slow to undertake to discriminate between what is and what\r\nis not a violation of the spirit of the Constitution. Congress must\r\nwantonly go very far outside of the plain and unquestionable meaning of\r\nthe Constitution, must bump its head directly against all right and\r\nprecedent, must kick against the very pricks of all well-established\r\nrulings and interpretations, before the Supreme Court will offer it any\r\ndistinct rebuke.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the Supreme Court itself, however upright and irreproachable\r\nits members, has generally had and will undoubtedly continue to have a\r\ndistinct political complexion, taken from the color of the times during\r\nwhich its majority was chosen. The bench over which John Marshall\r\npresided was, as everybody knows, staunchly and avowedly federalist in\r\nits views; but during the ten years which followed 1835 federalist\r\njustices were rapidly displaced by Democrats, and the views of the Court\r\nchanged accordingly. Indeed it may truthfully be said that, taking our\r\npolitical history \"by and large,\" the constitutional interpretations of\r\nthe Supreme Court have changed, slowly but none the less surely, with\r\nthe altered relations of power between the national parties. The\r\nFederalists were backed by a federalist judiciary; the period of\r\ndemocratic supremacy witnessed the triumph of democratic principles in\r\nthe courts; and republican predominance has driven from the highest\r\ntribunal of the land all but one representative of democratic doctrines.\r\nIt has been only during comparatively short periods of transition, when\r\npublic opinion was passing over from one political creed to another,\r\nthat the decisions of the federal judiciary have been distinctly opposed\r\nto the principles of the ruling political party.\r\n\r\nBut, besides and above all this, the national courts are for the most\r\npart in the power of Congress. Even the Supreme Court is not beyond its\r\ncontrol; for it is the legislative privilege to increase, whenever the\r\nlegislative will so pleases, the number of the judges upon the supreme\r\nbench,--to \"dilute the Constitution,\" as Webster once put it, \"by\r\ncreating a court which shall construe away its provisions;\" and this on\r\none memorable occasion it did choose to do. In December, 1869, the\r\nSupreme Court decided against the constitutionality of Congress's pet\r\nLegal Tender Acts; and in the following March a vacancy on the bench\r\nopportunely occurring, and a new justiceship having been created to meet\r\nthe emergency, the Senate gave the President to understand that no\r\nnominee unfavorable to the debated acts would be confirmed, two justices\r\nof the predominant party's way of thinking were appointed, the hostile\r\nmajority of the court was outvoted, and the obnoxious decision\r\nreversed.[16]\r\n\r\nThe creation of additional justiceships is not, however, the only means\r\nby which Congress can coerce and control the Supreme Court. It may\r\nforestall an adverse decision by summarily depriving the court of\r\njurisdiction over the case in which such a decision was threatened,[17]\r\nand that even while the case is pending; for only a very small part of\r\nthe jurisdiction of even the Supreme Court is derived directly from the\r\nConstitution. Most of it is founded upon the Judiciary Act of 1789,\r\nwhich, being a mere act of Congress, may be repealed at any time that\r\nCongress chooses to repeal it. Upon this Judiciary Act, too, depend not\r\nonly the powers but also the very existence of the inferior courts of\r\nthe United States, the Circuit and District Courts; and their possible\r\nfate, in case of a conflict with Congress, is significantly foreshadowed\r\nin that Act of 1802 by which a democratic Congress swept away, root and\r\nbranch, the system of circuit courts which had been created in the\r\nprevious year, but which was hateful to the newly-successful Democrats\r\nbecause it had been officered with Federalists in the last hours of John\r\nAdams's administration.\r\n\r\nThis balance of judiciary against legislature and executive would seem,\r\ntherefore, to be another of those ideal balances which are to be found\r\nin the books rather than in the rough realities of actual practice; for\r\nmanifestly the power of the courts is safe only during seasons of\r\npolitical peace, when parties are not aroused to passion or tempted by\r\nthe command of irresistible majorities.\r\n\r\nAs for some of the other constitutional balances enumerated in that\r\npassage of the letter to John Taylor which I have taken as a text, their\r\npresent inefficacy is quite too plain to need proof. The constituencies\r\nmay have been balanced against their representatives in Mr. Adams's day,\r\nfor that was not a day of primaries and of strict caucus discipline. The\r\nlegislatures of the States, too, may have been able to exercise some\r\nappreciable influence upon the action of the Senate, if those were days\r\nwhen policy was the predominant consideration which determined elections\r\nto the Senate, and the legislative choice was not always a matter of\r\nastute management, of mere personal weight, or party expediency; and the\r\npresidential electors undoubtedly did have at one time some freedom of\r\nchoice in naming the chief magistrate, but before the third presidential\r\nelection some of them were pledged, before Adams wrote this letter the\r\nmajority of them were wont to obey the dictates of a congressional\r\ncaucus, and for the last fifty years they have simply registered the\r\nwill of party conventions.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Mr. Adams, possibly because he had himself been\r\nPresident, describes the executive as constituting only \"_in some\r\ndegree_\" a check upon Congress, though he puts no such limitation upon\r\nthe other balances of the system. Independently of experience, however,\r\nit might reasonably have been expected that the prerogatives of the\r\nPresident would have been one of the most effectual restraints upon the\r\npower of Congress. He was constituted one of the three great coordinate\r\nbranches of the government; his functions were made of the highest\r\ndignity; his privileges many and substantial--so great, indeed, that it\r\nhas pleased the fancy of some writers to parade them as exceeding those\r\nof the British crown; and there can be little doubt that, had the\r\npresidential chair always been filled by men of commanding character, of\r\nacknowledged ability, and of thorough political training, it would have\r\ncontinued to be a seat of the highest authority and consideration, the\r\ntrue centre of the federal structure, the real throne of administration,\r\nand the frequent source of policies. Washington and his Cabinet\r\ncommanded the ear of Congress, and gave shape to its deliberations;\r\nAdams, though often crossed and thwarted, gave character to the\r\ngovernment; and Jefferson, as President no less than as Secretary of\r\nState, was the real leader of his party. But the prestige of the\r\npresidential office has declined with the character of the Presidents.\r\nAnd the character of the Presidents has declined as the perfection of\r\nselfish party tactics has advanced.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that it should be so. After independence of choice on\r\nthe part of the presidential electors had given place to the choice of\r\npresidential candidates by party conventions, it became absolutely\r\nnecessary, in the eyes of politicians, and more and more necessary as\r\ntime went on, to make expediency and availability the only rules of\r\nselection. As each party, when in convention assembled, spoke only those\r\nopinions which seemed to have received the sanction of the general\r\nvoice, carefully suppressing in its \"platform\" all unpopular political\r\ntenets, and scrupulously omitting mention of every doctrine that might\r\nbe looked upon as characteristic and as part of a peculiar and original\r\nprogramme, so, when the presidential candidate came to be chosen, it was\r\nrecognized as imperatively necessary that he should have as short a\r\npolitical record as possible, and that he should wear a clean and\r\nirreproachable insignificance. \"Gentlemen,\" said a distinguished\r\nAmerican public man, \"I would make an excellent President, but a very\r\npoor candidate.\" A decisive career which gives a man a well-understood\r\nplace in public estimation constitutes a positive disability for the\r\npresidency; because candidacy must precede election, and the shoals of\r\ncandidacy can be passed only by a light boat which carries little\r\nfreight and can be turned readily about to suit the intricacies of the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to think, however, that the decline in the character of\r\nthe Presidents is not the cause, but only the accompanying\r\nmanifestation, of the declining prestige of the presidential office.\r\nThat high office has fallen from its first estate of dignity because its\r\npower has waned; and its power has waned because the power of Congress\r\nhas become predominant. The early Presidents were, as I have said, men\r\nof such a stamp that they would under any circumstances have made their\r\ninfluence felt; but their opportunities were exceptional. What with\r\nquarreling and fighting with England, buying Louisiana and Florida,\r\nbuilding dykes to keep out the flood of the French Revolution, and\r\nextricating the country from ceaseless broils with the South American\r\nRepublics, the government was, as has been pointed out, constantly busy,\r\nduring the first quarter century of its existence, with the adjustment\r\nof foreign relations; and with foreign relations, of course, the\r\nPresidents had everything to do, since theirs was the office of\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as regards home policy also those times were not like ours.\r\nCongress was somewhat awkward in exercising its untried powers, and its\r\nmachinery was new, and without that fine adjustment which has since made\r\nit perfect of its kind. Not having as yet learned the art of governing\r\nitself to the best advantage, and being without that facility of\r\nlegislation which it afterwards acquired, the Legislature was glad to\r\nget guidance and suggestions of policy from the Executive.\r\n\r\nBut this state of things did not last long. Congress was very quick and\r\napt in learning what it could do and in getting into thoroughly good\r\ntrim to do it. It very early divided itself into standing committees\r\nwhich it equipped with very comprehensive and thorough-going privileges\r\nof legislative initiative and control, and set itself through these to\r\nadminister the government. Congress is (to adopt Mr. Bagehot's\r\ndescription of Parliament) \"nothing less than a big meeting of more or\r\nless idle people. In proportion as you give it power it will inquire\r\ninto everything, settle everything, meddle in everything. In an ordinary\r\ndespotism the powers of the despot are limited by his bodily capacity,\r\nand by the calls of pleasure; he is but one man; there are but twelve\r\nhours in his day, and he is not disposed to employ more than a small\r\npart in dull business: he keeps the rest for the court, or the harem,\r\nor for society.\" But Congress \"is a despot who has unlimited time,--who\r\nhas unlimited vanity,--who has, or believes he has, unlimited\r\ncomprehension,--whose pleasure is in action, whose life is work.\"\r\nAccordingly it has entered more and more into the details of\r\nadministration, until it has virtually taken into its own hands all the\r\nsubstantial powers of government. It does not domineer over the\r\nPresident himself, but it makes the Secretaries its humble servants. Not\r\nthat it would hesitate, upon occasion, to deal directly with the chief\r\nmagistrate himself; but it has few calls to do so, because our\r\nlatter-day Presidents live by proxy; they are the executive in theory,\r\nbut the Secretaries are the executive in fact. At the very first session\r\nof Congress steps were taken towards parceling out executive work\r\namongst several departments, according to a then sufficiently thorough\r\ndivision of labor; and if the President of that day was not able to\r\ndirect administrative details, of course the President of to-day is\r\ninfinitely less able to do so, and must content himself with such\r\ngeneral supervision as he may find time to exercise. He is in all\r\nevery-day concerns shielded by the responsibility of his subordinates.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that this change has raised the cabinet in dignity or\r\npower; it has only altered their relations to the scheme of government.\r\nThe members of the President's cabinet have always been prominent in\r\nadministration; and certainly the early cabinets were no less strong in\r\npolitical influence than are the cabinets of our own day; but they were\r\nthen only the President's advisers, whereas they are now rather the\r\nPresident's colleagues. The President is now scarcely the executive; he\r\nis the head of the administration; he appoints the executive. Of course\r\nthis is not a legal principle; it is only a fact. In legal theory the\r\nPresident can control every operation of every department of the\r\nexecutive branch of the government; but in fact it is not practicable\r\nfor him to do so, and a limitation of fact is as potent as a prohibition\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nBut, though the heads of the executive departments are thus no longer\r\nsimply the counselors of the President, having become in a very real\r\nsense members of the executive, their guiding power in the conduct of\r\naffairs, instead of advancing, has steadily diminished; because while\r\nthey were being made integral parts of the machinery of administration,\r\nCongress was extending its own sphere of activity, was getting into the\r\nhabit of investigating and managing every thing. The executive was\r\nlosing and Congress gaining weight; and the station to which cabinets\r\nfinally attained was a station of diminished and diminishing power.\r\nThere is no distincter tendency in congressional history than the\r\ntendency to subject even the details of administration to the constant\r\nsupervision, and all policy to the watchful intervention, of the\r\nStanding Committees.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think, therefore, that the enlarged powers of Congress\r\nare the fruits rather of an immensely increased efficiency of\r\norganization, and of the redoubled activity consequent upon the facility\r\nof action secured by such organization, than of any definite and\r\npersistent scheme of conscious usurpation. It is safe to say that\r\nCongress always had the desire to have a hand in every affair of federal\r\ngovernment; but it was only by degrees that it found means and\r\nopportunity to gratify that desire, and its activity, extending its\r\nbounds wherever perfected processes of congressional work offered\r\nfavoring prospects, has been enlarged so naturally and so silently that\r\nit has almost always seemed of normal extent, and has never, except\r\nperhaps during one or two brief periods of extraordinary political\r\ndisturbance, appeared to reach much beyond its acknowledged\r\nconstitutional sphere.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the exercise of those functions of public and formal\r\nconsultation and cooperation with the President which are the peculiar\r\noffices of the Senate, that the power of Congress has made itself\r\noffensive to popular conceptions of constitutional propriety, because it\r\nis only in the exercise of such functions that Congress is compelled to\r\nbe overt and demonstrative in its claims of over-lordship. The House of\r\nRepresentatives has made very few noisy demonstrations of its usurped\r\nright of ascendency; not because it was diffident or unambitious, but\r\nbecause it could maintain and extend its prerogatives quite as\r\nsatisfactorily without noise; whereas the aggressive policy of the\r\nSenate has, in the acts of its \"executive sessions,\" necessarily been\r\novert, in spite of the closing of the doors, because when acting as the\r\nPresident's council in the ratification of treaties and in appointments\r\nto office its competition for power has been more formally and directly\r\na contest with the executive than were those really more significant\r\nlegislative acts by which, in conjunction with the House, it has\r\nhabitually forced the heads of the executive departments to observe the\r\nwill of Congress at every important turn of policy. Hence it is that to\r\nthe superficial view it appears that only the Senate has been outrageous\r\nin its encroachments upon executive privilege. It is not often easy to\r\nsee the true constitutional bearing of strictly legislative action; but\r\nit is patent even to the least observant that in the matter of\r\nappointments to office, for instance, senators have often outrun their\r\nlegal right to give or withhold their assent to appointments, by\r\ninsisting upon being first consulted concerning nominations as well, and\r\nhave thus made their constitutional assent to appointments dependent\r\nupon an unconstitutional control of nominations.\r\n\r\nThis particular usurpation has been put upon a very solid basis of law\r\nby that Tenure-of-Office Act, which took away from President Johnson, in\r\nan hour of party heat and passion, that independent power of removal\r\nfrom office with which the Constitution had invested him, but which he\r\nhad used in a way that exasperated a Senate not of his own way of\r\nthinking. But though this teasing power of the Senate's in the matter of\r\nthe federal patronage is repugnant enough to the original theory of the\r\nConstitution, it is likely to be quite nullified by that policy of\r\ncivil-service reform which has gained so firm, and mayhap so lasting, a\r\nfooting in our national legislation; and in no event would the control\r\nof the patronage by the Senate have unbalanced the federal system more\r\nseriously than it may some day be unbalanced by an irresponsible\r\nexertion of that body's semi-executive powers in regard to the foreign\r\npolicy of the government. More than one passage in the history of our\r\nforeign relations illustrates the danger. During the single\r\ncongressional session of 1868-9, for example, the treaty-_marring_ power\r\nof the Senate was exerted in a way that made the comparative weakness of\r\nthe executive very conspicuous, and was ominous of very serious results.\r\nIt showed the executive in the right, but feeble and irresolute; the\r\nSenate masterful, though in the wrong. Denmark had been asked to part\r\nwith the island of St. Thomas to the United States, and had at first\r\nrefused all terms, not only because she cared little for the price, but\r\nalso and principally because such a sale as that proposed was opposed to\r\nthe established policy of the powers of Western Europe, in whose favor\r\nDenmark wished to stand; but finally, by stress of persistent and\r\nimportunate negotiation, she had been induced to yield; a treaty had\r\nbeen signed and sent to the Senate; the people of St. Thomas had\r\nsignified their consent to the cession by a formal vote; and the island\r\nhad been actually transferred to an authorized agent of our government,\r\nupon the faith, on the part of the Danish ministers, that our\r\nrepresentatives would not have trifled with them by entering upon an\r\nimportant business transaction which they were not assured of their\r\nability to conclude. But the Senate let the treaty lie neglected in its\r\ncommittee-room; the limit of time agreed upon for confirmation passed;\r\nthe Danish government, at last bent upon escaping the ridiculous\r\nhumiliation that would follow a failure of the business at that stage,\r\nextended the time and even sent over one of its most eminent ministers\r\nof state to urge the negotiation by all dignified means; but the Senate\r\ncared nothing for Danish feelings and could afford, it thought, to\r\ndespise President Grant and Mr. Fish, and at the next session rejected\r\nthe treaty, and left the Danes to repossess themselves of the island,\r\nwhich we had concluded not to buy after all.\r\n\r\nIt was during this same session of 1868-9 that the Senate teased the\r\nexecutive by throwing every possible obstacle in the way of the\r\nconfirmation of the much more important treaty with Great Britain\r\nrelative to the Alabama claims, nearly marring for good and all one of\r\nthe most satisfactory successes of our recent foreign policy;[18] but it\r\nis not necessary to dwell at length upon these well-known incidents of\r\nour later history, inasmuch as these are only two of innumerable\r\ninstances which make it safe to say that from whatever point we view the\r\nrelations of the executive and the legislature, it is evident that the\r\npower of the latter has steadily increased at the expense of the\r\nprerogatives of the former, and that the degree in which the one of\r\nthese great branches of government is balanced against the other is a\r\nvery insignificant degree indeed. For in the exercise of his power of\r\nveto, which is of course, beyond all comparison, his most formidable\r\nprerogative, the President acts not as the executive but as a third\r\nbranch of the legislature. As Oliver Ellsworth said, at the first\r\nsession of the Senate, the President is, as regards the passage of\r\nbills, but a part of Congress; and he can be an efficient, imperative\r\nmember of the legislative system only in quiet times, when parties are\r\npretty evenly balanced, and there are no indomitable majorities to tread\r\nobnoxious vetoes under foot.\r\n\r\nEven this rapid outline sketch of the two pictures, of the theory and of\r\nthe actual practices of the Constitution, has been sufficient,\r\ntherefore, to show the most marked points of difference between the two,\r\nand to justify that careful study of congressional government, as the\r\nreal government of the Union, which I am about to undertake. The\r\nbalances of the Constitution are for the most part only ideal. For all\r\npractical purposes the national government is supreme over the state\r\ngovernments, and Congress predominant over its so-called coordinate\r\nbranches. Whereas Congress at first overshadowed neither President nor\r\nfederal judiciary, it now on occasion rules both with easy mastery and\r\nwith a high hand; and whereas each State once guarded its sovereign\r\nprerogatives with jealous pride, and able men not a few preferred\r\npolitical advancement under the governments of the great commonwealths\r\nto office under the new federal Constitution, seats in state\r\nlegislatures are now no longer coveted except as possible approaches to\r\nseats in Congress; and even governors of States seek election to the\r\nnational Senate as a promotion, a reward for the humbler services they\r\nhave rendered their local governments.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it the more important to understand the present mechanism of\r\nnational government, and to study the methods of congressional rule in a\r\nlight unclouded by theory, is that there is plain evidence that the\r\nexpansion of federal power is to continue, and that there exists,\r\nconsequently, an evident necessity that it should be known just what to\r\ndo and how to do it, when the time comes for public opinion to take\r\ncontrol of the forces which are changing the character of our\r\nConstitution. There are voices in the air which cannot be misunderstood.\r\nThe times seem to favor a centralization of governmental functions such\r\nas could not have suggested itself as a possibility to the framers of\r\nthe Constitution. Since they gave their work to the world the whole face\r\nof that world has changed. The Constitution was adopted when it was six\r\ndays' hard traveling from New York to Boston; when to cross East River\r\nwas to venture a perilous voyage; when men were thankful for weekly\r\nmails; when the extent of the country's commerce was reckoned not in\r\nmillions but in thousands of dollars; when the country knew few cities,\r\nand had but begun manufactures; when Indians were pressing upon near\r\nfrontiers; when there were no telegraph lines, and no monster\r\ncorporations. Unquestionably, the pressing problems of the present\r\nmoment regard the regulation of our vast systems of commerce and\r\nmanufacture, the control of giant corporations, the restraint of\r\nmonopolies, the perfection of fiscal arrangements, the facilitating of\r\neconomic exchanges, and many other like national concerns, amongst which\r\nmay possibly be numbered the question of marriage and divorce; and the\r\ngreatest of these problems do not fall within even the enlarged sphere\r\nof the federal government; some of them can be embraced within its\r\njurisdiction by no possible stretch of construction, and the majority of\r\nthem only by wresting the Constitution to strange and as yet unimagined\r\nuses. Still there is a distinct movement in favor of national control of\r\nall questions of policy which manifestly demand uniformity of treatment\r\nand power of administration such as cannot be realized by the separate,\r\nunconcerted action of the States; and it seems probable to many that,\r\nwhether by constitutional amendment, or by still further flights of\r\nconstruction, yet broader territory will at no very distant day be\r\nassigned to the federal government. It becomes a matter of the utmost\r\nimportance, therefore, both for those who would arrest this tendency,\r\nand for those who, because they look upon it with allowance if not with\r\npositive favor, would let it run its course, to examine critically the\r\ngovernment upon which this new weight of responsibility and power seems\r\nlikely to be cast, in order that its capacity both for the work it now\r\ndoes and for that which it may be called upon to do may be definitely\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nJudge Cooley, in his admirable work on \"The Principles of American\r\nConstitutional Law,\" after quoting Mr. Adams's enumeration of the checks\r\nand balances of the federal system, adds this comment upon Mr. Adams's\r\nconcluding statement that that system is an invention of our own. \"The\r\ninvention, nevertheless, was suggested by the British Constitution, in\r\nwhich a system almost equally elaborate was then in force. In its\r\noutward forms that system still remains; but there has been for more\r\nthan a century a gradual change in the direction of a concentration of\r\nlegislative and executive power in the popular house of Parliament, so\r\nthat the government now is sometimes said, with no great departure from\r\nthe fact, to be a government by the House of Commons.\" But Judge Cooley\r\ndoes not seem to see, or, if he sees, does not emphasize the fact, that\r\nour own system has been hardly less subject to \"a gradual change in the\r\ndirection of a concentration\" of all the substantial powers of\r\ngovernment in the hands of Congress; so that it is now, though a wide\r\ndeparture from the form of things, \"no great departure from the fact\" to\r\ndescribe ours as a government by the Standing Committees of Congress.\r\nThis fact is, however, deducible from very many passages of Judge\r\nCooley's own writings; for he is by no means insensible of that\r\nexpansion of the powers of the federal government and that\r\ncrystallization of its methods which have practically made obsolete the\r\nearly constitutional theories, and even the modified theory which he\r\nhimself seems to hold.\r\n\r\nHe has tested the nice adjustment of the theoretical balances by the\r\nactual facts, and has carefully set forth the results; but he has\r\nnowhere brought those results together into a single comprehensive view\r\nwhich might serve as a clear and satisfactory delineation of the\r\nConstitution of to-day; nor has he, or any other writer of capacity,\r\nexamined minutely and at length that internal organization of Congress\r\nwhich determines its methods of legislation, which shapes its means of\r\ngoverning the executive departments, which contains in it the whole\r\nmechanism whereby the policy of the country is in all points directed,\r\nand which is therefore an essential branch of constitutional study. As\r\nthe House of Commons is the central object of examination in every study\r\nof the English Constitution, so should Congress be in every study of our\r\nown. Any one who is unfamiliar with what Congress actually does and how\r\nit does it, with all its duties and all its occupations, with all its\r\ndevices of management and resources of power, is very far from a\r\nknowledge of the constitutional system under which we live; and to every\r\none who knows these things that knowledge is very near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n     No more vital truth was ever uttered than that freedom and free\r\n     institutions cannot long be maintained by any people who do not\r\n     understand the nature of their own government.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a vast picture thronged with figures of equal prominence and\r\ncrowded with elaborate and obtrusive details, Congress is hard to see\r\nsatisfactorily and appreciatively at a single view and from a single\r\nstand-point. Its complicated forms and diversified structure confuse the\r\nvision, and conceal the system which underlies its composition. It is\r\ntoo complex to be understood without an effort, without a careful and\r\nsystematic process of analysis. Consequently, very few people do\r\nunderstand it, and its doors are practically shut against the\r\ncomprehension of the public at large. If Congress had a few\r\nauthoritative leaders whose figures were very distinct and very\r\nconspicuous to the eye of the world, and who could represent and stand\r\nfor the national legislature in the thoughts of that very numerous, and\r\nwithal very respectable, class of persons who must think specifically\r\nand in concrete forms when they think at all, those persons who can make\r\nsomething out of men but very little out of intangible generalizations,\r\nit would be quite within the region of possibilities for the majority of\r\nthe nation to follow the course of legislation without any very serious\r\nconfusion of thought. I suppose that almost everybody who just now gives\r\nany heed to the policy of Great Britain, with regard even to the reform\r\nof the franchise and other like strictly legislative questions, thinks\r\nof Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues rather than of the House of Commons,\r\nwhose servants they are. The question is not, What will Parliament do?\r\nbut, What will Mr. Gladstone do? And there is even less doubt that it is\r\neasier and more natural to look upon the legislative designs of Germany\r\nas locked up behind Bismarck's heavy brows than to think of them as\r\ndependent upon the determinations of the Reichstag, although as a matter\r\nof fact its consent is indispensable even to the plans of the imperious\r\nand domineering Chancellor.\r\n\r\nBut there is no great minister or ministry to represent the will and\r\nbeing of Congress in the common thought. The Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives stands as near to leadership as any one; but his will\r\ndoes not run as a formative and imperative power in legislation much\r\nbeyond the appointment of the committees who are to lead the House and\r\ndo its work for it, and it is, therefore, not entirely satisfactory to\r\nthe public mind to trace all legislation to him. He may have a\r\ncontrolling hand in starting it; but he sits too still in his chair, and\r\nis too evidently not on the floor of the body over which he presides, to\r\nmake it seem probable to the ordinary judgment that he has much\r\nimmediate concern in legislation after it is once set afoot. Everybody\r\nknows that he is a staunch and avowed partisan, and that he likes to\r\nmake smooth, whenever he can, the legislative paths of his party; but it\r\ndoes not seem likely that all important measures originate with him, or\r\nthat he is the author of every distinct policy. And in fact he is not.\r\nHe is a great party chief, but the hedging circumstances of his official\r\nposition as presiding officer prevent his performing the part of active\r\nleadership. He appoints the leaders of the House, but he is not himself\r\nits leader.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the House are the chairmen of the principal Standing\r\nCommittees. Indeed, to be exactly accurate, the House has as many\r\nleaders as there are subjects of legislation; for there are as many\r\nStanding Committees as there are leading classes of legislation, and in\r\nthe consideration of every topic of business the House is guided by a\r\nspecial leader in the person of the chairman of the Standing Committee,\r\ncharged with the superintendence of measures of the particular class to\r\nwhich that topic belongs. It is this multiplicity of leaders, this\r\nmany-headed leadership, which makes the organization of the House too\r\ncomplex to afford uninformed people and unskilled observers any easy\r\nclue to its methods of rule. For the chairmen of the Standing Committees\r\ndo not constitute a cooperative body like a ministry. They do not\r\nconsult and concur in the adoption of homogeneous and mutually helpful\r\nmeasures; there is no thought of acting in concert. Each Committee goes\r\nits own way at its own pace. It is impossible to discover any unity or\r\nmethod in the disconnected and therefore unsystematic, confused, and\r\ndesultory action of the House, or any common purpose in the measures\r\nwhich its Committees from time to time recommend.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not only to the unanalytic thought of the common observer who\r\nlooks at the House from the outside that its doings seem helter-skelter,\r\nand without comprehensible rule; it is not at once easy to understand\r\nthem when they are scrutinized in their daily headway through open\r\nsession by one who is inside the House. The newly-elected member,\r\nentering its doors for the first time, and with no more knowledge of\r\nits rules and customs than the more intelligent of his constituents\r\npossess, always experiences great difficulty in adjusting his\r\npreconceived ideas of congressional life to the strange and unlooked-for\r\nconditions by which he finds himself surrounded after he has been sworn\r\nin and has become a part of the great legislative machine. Indeed there\r\nare generally many things connected with his career in Washington to\r\ndisgust and dispirit, if not to aggrieve, the new member. In the first\r\nplace, his local reputation does not follow him to the federal capital.\r\nPossibly the members from his own State know him, and receive him into\r\nfull fellowship; but no one else knows him, except as an adherent of\r\nthis or that party, or as a new-comer from this or that State. He finds\r\nhis station insignificant, and his identity indistinct. But this social\r\nhumiliation which he experiences in circles in which to be a congressman\r\ndoes not of itself confer distinction, because it is only to be one\r\namong many, is probably not to be compared with the chagrin and\r\ndisappointment which come in company with the inevitable discovery that\r\nhe is equally without weight or title to consideration in the House\r\nitself. No man, when chosen to the membership of a body possessing great\r\npowers and exalted prerogatives, likes to find his activity repressed,\r\nand himself suppressed, by imperative rules and precedents which seem\r\nto have been framed for the deliberate purpose of making usefulness\r\nunattainable by individual members. Yet such the new member finds the\r\nrules and precedents of the House to be. It matters not to him, because\r\nit is not apparent on the face of things, that those rules and\r\nprecedents have grown, not out of set purpose to curtail the privileges\r\nof new members as such, but out of the plain necessities of business; it\r\nremains the fact that he suffers under their curb, and it is not until\r\n\"custom hath made it in him a property of easiness\" that he submits to\r\nthem with anything like good grace.\r\n\r\nNot all new members suffer alike, of course, under this trying\r\ndiscipline; because it is not every new member that comes to his seat\r\nwith serious purposes of honest, earnest, and duteous work. There are\r\nnumerous tricks and subterfuges, soon learned and easily used, by means\r\nof which the most idle and self-indulgent members may readily make such\r\nshow of exemplary diligence as will quite satisfy, if it does not\r\npositively delight, constituents in Buncombe. But the number of\r\ncongressmen who deliberately court uselessness and counterfeit\r\nwell-doing is probably small. The great majority doubtless have a keen\r\nenough sense of their duty, and a sufficiently unhesitating desire to do\r\nit; and it may safely be taken for granted that the zeal of new members\r\nis generally hot and insistent. If it be not hot to begin with, it is\r\nlike to become so by reason of friction with the rules, because such men\r\nmust inevitably be chafed by the bonds of restraint drawn about them by\r\nthe inexorable observances of the House.\r\n\r\nOften the new member goes to Washington as the representative of a\r\nparticular line of policy, having been elected, it may be, as an\r\nadvocate of free trade, or as a champion of protection; and it is\r\nnaturally his first care upon entering on his duties to seek immediate\r\nopportunity for the expression of his views and immediate means of\r\ngiving them definite shape and thrusting them upon the attention of\r\nCongress. His disappointment is, therefore, very keen when he finds both\r\nopportunity and means denied him. He can introduce his bill; but that is\r\nall he can do, and he must do that at a particular time and in a\r\nparticular manner. This he is likely to learn through rude experience,\r\nif he be not cautious to inquire beforehand the details of practice. He\r\nis likely to make a rash start, upon the supposition that Congress\r\nobserves the ordinary rules of parliamentary practice to which he has\r\nbecome accustomed in the debating clubs familiar to his youth, and in\r\nthe mass-meetings known to his later experience. His bill is doubtless\r\nready for presentation early in the session, and some day, taking\r\nadvantage of a pause in the proceedings, when there seems to be no\r\nbusiness before the House, he rises to read it and move its adoption.\r\nBut he finds getting the floor an arduous and precarious undertaking.\r\nThere are certain to be others who want it as well as he; and his\r\nindignation is stirred by the fact that the Speaker does not so much as\r\nturn towards him, though he must have heard his call, but recognizes\r\nsome one else readily and as a matter of course. If he be obstreperous\r\nand persistent in his cries of \"Mr. Speaker,\" he may get that great\r\nfunctionary's attention for a moment,--only to be told, however, that he\r\nis out of order, and that his bill can be introduced at that stage only\r\nby unanimous consent: immediately there are mechanically-uttered but\r\nemphatic exclamations of objection, and he is forced to sit down\r\nconfused and disgusted. He has, without knowing it, obtruded himself in\r\nthe way of the \"regular order of business,\" and been run over in\r\nconsequence, without being quite clear as to how the accident occurred.\r\n\r\nMoved by the pain and discomfiture of this first experience to respect,\r\nif not to fear, the rules, the new member casts about, by study or\r\ninquiry, to find out, if possible, the nature and occasion of his\r\nprivileges. He learns that his only safe day is Monday. On that day the\r\nroll of the States is called, and members may introduce bills as their\r\nStates are reached in the call. So on Monday he essays another bout with\r\nthe rules, confident this time of being on their safe side,--but mayhap\r\nindiscreetly and unluckily over-confident. For if he supposes, as he\r\nnaturally will, that after his bill has been sent up to be read by the\r\nclerk he may say a few words in its behalf, and in that belief sets out\r\nupon his long-considered remarks, he will be knocked down by the rules\r\nas surely as he was on the first occasion when he gained the floor for a\r\nbrief moment. The rap of Mr. Speaker's gavel is sharp, immediate, and\r\nperemptory. He is curtly informed that no debate is in order; the bill\r\ncan only be referred to the appropriate Committee.\r\n\r\nThis is, indeed, disheartening; it is his first lesson in committee\r\ngovernment, and the master's rod smarts; but the sooner he learns the\r\nprerogatives and powers of the Standing Committees the sooner will he\r\npenetrate the mysteries of the rules and avoid the pain of further\r\ncontact with their thorny side. The privileges of the Standing\r\nCommittees are the beginning and the end of the rules. Both the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the Senate conduct their business by what may\r\nfiguratively, but not inaccurately, be called an odd device of\r\n_disintegration_. The House virtually both deliberates and legislates\r\nin small sections. Time would fail it to discuss all the bills brought\r\nin, for they every session number thousands; and it is to be doubted\r\nwhether, even if time allowed, the ordinary processes of debate and\r\namendment would suffice to sift the chaff from the wheat in the bushels\r\nof bills every week piled upon the clerk's, desk. Accordingly, no futile\r\nattempt is made to do anything of the kind. The work is parceled out,\r\nmost of it to the forty-seven Standing Committees which constitute the\r\nregular organization of the House, some of it to select committees\r\nappointed for special and temporary purposes. Each of the almost\r\nnumberless bills that come pouring in on Mondays is \"read a first and\r\nsecond time,\"--simply perfunctorily read, that is, by its title, by the\r\nclerk, and passed by silent assent through its first formal courses, for\r\nthe purpose of bringing it to the proper stage for commitment,--and\r\nreferred without debate to the appropriate Standing Committee.\r\nPractically, no bill escapes commitment--save, of course, bills\r\nintroduced by committees, and a few which may now and then be crowded\r\nthrough under a suspension of the rules, granted by a two-thirds\r\nvote--though the exact disposition to be made of a bill is not always\r\ndetermined easily and as a matter of course. Besides the great\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means and the equally great Committee on\r\nAppropriations, there are Standing Committees on Banking and Currency,\r\non Claims, on Commerce, on the Public Lands, on Post-Offices and\r\nPost-Roads, on the Judiciary, on Public Expenditures, on Manufactures,\r\non Agriculture, on Military Affairs, on Naval Affairs, on Mines and\r\nMining, on Education and Labor, on Patents, and on a score of other\r\nbranches of legislative concern; but careful and differential as is the\r\ntopical division of the subjects of legislation which is represented in\r\nthe titles of these Committees, it is not always evident to which\r\nCommittee each particular bill should go. Many bills affect subjects\r\nwhich may be regarded as lying as properly within the jurisdiction of\r\none as of another of the Committees; for no hard and fast lines separate\r\nthe various classes of business which the Committees are commissioned to\r\ntake in charge. Their jurisdictions overlap at many points, and it must\r\nfrequently happen that bills are read which cover just this common\r\nground. Over the commitment of such bills sharp and interesting\r\nskirmishes often take place. There is active competition for them, the\r\nordinary, quiet routine of matter-of-course reference being interrupted\r\nby rival motions seeking to give very different directions to the\r\ndisposition to be made of them. To which Committee should a bill \"to\r\nfix and establish the maximum rates of fares of the Union Pacific and\r\nCentral Pacific Railroads\" be sent,--to the Committee on Commerce or to\r\nthe Committee on the Pacific Railroads? Should a bill which prohibits\r\nthe mailing of certain classes of letters and circulars go to the\r\nCommittee on Post-Offices and Post-Roads, because it relates to the\r\nmails, or to the Committee on the Judiciary, because it proposes to make\r\nany transgression of its prohibition a crime? What is the proper\r\ndisposition of any bill which thus seems to lie within two distinct\r\ncommittee jurisdictions?\r\n\r\nThe fate of bills committed is generally not uncertain. As a rule, a\r\nbill committed is a bill doomed. When it goes from the clerk's desk to a\r\ncommittee-room it crosses a parliamentary bridge of sighs to dim\r\ndungeons of silence whence it will never return. The means and time of\r\nits death are unknown, but its friends never see it again. Of course no\r\nStanding Committee is privileged to take upon itself the full powers of\r\nthe House it represents, and formally and decisively reject a bill\r\nreferred to it; its disapproval, if it disapproves, must be reported to\r\nthe House in the form of a recommendation that the bill \"do not pass.\"\r\nBut it is easy, and therefore common, to let the session pass without\r\nmaking any report at all upon bills deemed objectionable or\r\nunimportant, and to substitute for reports upon them a few bills of the\r\nCommittee's own drafting; so that thousands of bills expire with the\r\nexpiration of each Congress, not having been rejected, but having been\r\nsimply neglected. There was not time to report upon them.\r\n\r\nOf course it goes without saying that the practical effect of this\r\nCommittee organization of the House is to consign to each of the\r\nStanding Committees the entire direction of legislation upon those\r\nsubjects which properly come to its consideration. As to those subjects\r\nit is entitled to the initiative, and all legislative action with regard\r\nto them is under its overruling guidance. It gives shape and course to\r\nthe determinations of the House. In one respect, however, its initiative\r\nis limited. Even a Standing Committee cannot report a bill whose\r\nsubject-matter has not been referred to it by the House, \"by the rules\r\nor otherwise;\" it cannot volunteer advice on questions upon which its\r\nadvice has not been asked. But this is not a serious, not even an\r\noperative, limitation upon its functions of suggestion and leadership;\r\nfor it is a very simple matter to get referred to it any subject it\r\nwishes to introduce to the attention of the House. Its chairman, or one\r\nof its leading members, frames a bill covering the point upon which the\r\nCommittee wishes to suggest legislation; brings it in, in his capacity\r\nas a private member, on Monday, when the call of States is made; has it\r\nreferred to his Committee; and thus secures an opportunity for the\r\nmaking of the desired report.\r\n\r\nIt is by this imperious authority of the Standing Committees that the\r\nnew member is stayed and thwarted whenever he seeks to take an active\r\npart in the business of the House. Turn which way he may, some privilege\r\nof the Committees stands in his path. The rules are so framed as to put\r\nall business under their management; and one of the discoveries which\r\nthe new member is sure to make, albeit after many trying experiences and\r\nsobering adventures and as his first session draws towards its close,\r\nis, that under their sway freedom of debate finds no place of allowance,\r\nand that his long-delayed speech must remain unspoken. For even a long\r\ncongressional session is too short to afford time for a full\r\nconsideration of all the reports of the forty-seven Committees, and\r\ndebate upon them must be rigidly cut short, if not altogether excluded,\r\nif any considerable part of the necessary business is to be gotten\r\nthrough with before adjournment. There are some subjects to which the\r\nHouse must always give prompt attention; therefore reports from the\r\nCommittees on Printing and on Elections are always in order; and there\r\nare some subjects to which careful consideration must always be\r\naccorded; therefore the Committee of Ways and Means and the Committee on\r\nAppropriations are clothed with extraordinary privileges; and revenue\r\nand supply bills may be reported, and will ordinarily be considered, at\r\nany time. But these four are the only specially licensed Committees. The\r\nrest must take their turns in fixed order as they are called on by the\r\nSpeaker, contenting themselves with such crumbs of time as fall from the\r\ntables of the four Committees of highest prerogative.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long congressional experience\r\nentitles him to speak with authority, calculates[19] that, \"supposing\r\nthe two sessions which make up the life of the House to last ten\r\nmonths,\" most of the Committees have at their disposal during each\r\nCongress but two hours apiece in which \"to report upon, debate, and\r\ndispose of all the subjects of general legislation committed to their\r\ncharge.\" For of course much time is wasted. No Congress gets immediately\r\nto work upon its first assembling. It has its officers to elect, and\r\nafter their election some time must elapse before its organization is\r\nfinally completed by the appointment of the Committees. It adjourns for\r\nholidays, too, and generally spares itself long sittings. Besides, there\r\nare many things to interrupt the call of the Committees upon which most\r\nof the business waits. That call can proceed only during the morning\r\nhours,--the hours just after the reading of the \"Journal,\"--on Tuesdays,\r\nWednesdays, and Thursdays; and even then it may suffer postponement\r\nbecause of the unfinished business of the previous day which is entitled\r\nto first consideration. The call cannot proceed on Mondays because the\r\nmorning hour of Mondays is devoted invariably to the call of the States\r\nfor the introduction of bills and resolutions; nor on Fridays, for\r\nFriday is \"private bill day,\" and is always engrossed by the Committee\r\non Claims, or by other fathers of bills which have gone upon the\r\n\"private calendar.\" On Saturdays the House seldom sits.\r\n\r\nThe reports made during these scant morning hours are ordered to be\r\nprinted, for future consideration in their turn, and the bills\r\nintroduced by the Committees are assigned to the proper calendars, to be\r\ntaken up in order at the proper time. When a morning hour has run out,\r\nthe House hastens to proceed with the business on the Speaker's table.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the plainer points of the rules. They are full of\r\ncomplexity, and of confusion to the uninitiated, and the confusions of\r\npractice are greater than the confusions of the rules. For the regular\r\norder of business is constantly being interrupted by the introduction of\r\nresolutions offered \"by unanimous consent,\" and of bills let in under a\r\n\"suspension of the rules.\" Still, it is evident that there is one\r\nprinciple which runs through every stage of procedure, and which is\r\nnever disallowed or abrogated,--the principle that the Committees shall\r\nrule without let or hindrance. And this is a principle of extraordinary\r\nformative power. It is the mould of all legislation. In the first place,\r\nthe speeding of business under the direction of the Committees\r\ndetermines the character and the amount of the discussion to which\r\nlegislation shall be subjected. The House is conscious that time\r\npresses. It knows that, hurry as it may, it will hardly get through with\r\none eighth of the business laid out for the session, and that to pause\r\nfor lengthy debate is to allow the arrears to accumulate. Besides, most\r\nof the members are individually anxious to expedite action on every\r\npending measure, because each member of the House is a member of one or\r\nmore of the Standing Committees, and is quite naturally desirous that\r\nthe bills prepared by his Committees, and in which he is, of course,\r\nspecially interested by reason of the particular attention which he has\r\nbeen compelled to give them, should reach a hearing and a vote as soon\r\nas possible. It must, therefore, invariably happen that the Committee\r\nholding the floor at any particular time is the Committee whose\r\nproposals the majority wish to dispose of as summarily as circumstances\r\nwill allow, in order that the rest of the forty-two unprivileged\r\nCommittees to which the majority belong may gain the earlier and the\r\nfairer chance of a hearing. A reporting Committee, besides, is generally\r\nas glad to be pushed as the majority are to push it. It probably has\r\nseveral bills matured, and wishes to see them disposed of before its\r\nbrief hours of opportunity[20] are passed and gone.\r\n\r\nConsequently, it is the established custom of the House to accord the\r\nfloor for one hour to the member of the reporting Committee who has\r\ncharge of the business under consideration; and that hour is made the\r\nchief hour of debate. The reporting committee-man seldom, if ever, uses\r\nthe whole of the hour himself for his opening remarks; he uses part of\r\nit, and retains control of the rest of it; for by undisputed privilege\r\nit is his to dispose of, whether he himself be upon the floor or not. No\r\namendment is in order during that hour, unless he consent to its\r\npresentation; and he does not, of course, yield his time\r\nindiscriminately to any one who wishes to speak. He gives way, indeed,\r\nas in fairness he should, to opponents as well as to friends of the\r\nmeasure under his charge; but generally no one is accorded a share of\r\nhis time who has not obtained his previous promise of the floor; and\r\nthose who do speak must not run beyond the number of minutes he has\r\nagreed to allow them. He keeps the course both of debate and of\r\namendment thus carefully under his own supervision, as a good tactician,\r\nand before he finally yields the floor, at the expiration of his hour,\r\nhe is sure to move the previous question. To neglect to do so would be\r\nto lose all control of the business in hand; for unless the previous\r\nquestion is ordered the debate may run on at will, and his Committee's\r\nchance for getting its measures through slip quite away; and that would\r\nbe nothing less than his disgrace. He would be all the more blameworthy\r\nbecause he had but to ask for the previous question to get it. As I have\r\nsaid, the House is as eager to hurry business as he can be, and will\r\nconsent to almost any limitation of discussion that he may demand;\r\nthough, probably, if he were to throw the reins upon its neck, it would\r\nrun at large from very wantonness, in scorn of such a driver. The\r\nprevious question once ordered, all amendments are precluded, and one\r\nhour remains for the summing-up of this same privileged committee-man\r\nbefore the final vote is taken and the bill disposed of.\r\n\r\nThese are the customs which baffle and perplex and astound the new\r\nmember. In these precedents and usages, when at length he comes to\r\nunderstand them, the novice spies out the explanation of the fact, once\r\nso confounding and seemingly inexplicable, that when he leaped to his\r\nfeet to claim the floor other members who rose after him were coolly and\r\nunfeelingly preferred before him by the Speaker. Of course it is plain\r\nenough now that Mr. Speaker knew beforehand to whom the representative\r\nof the reporting Committee had agreed to yield the floor; and it was no\r\nuse for any one else to cry out for recognition. Whoever wished to speak\r\nshould, if possible, have made some arrangement with the Committee\r\nbefore the business came to a hearing, and should have taken care to\r\nnotify Mr. Speaker that he was to be granted the floor for a few\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably this, besides being a very interesting, is a very novel\r\nand significant method of restricting debate and expediting legislative\r\naction,--a method of very serious import, and obviously fraught with\r\nfar-reaching constitutional effects. The practices of debate which\r\nprevail in its legislative assembly are manifestly of the utmost\r\nimportance to a self-governing people; for that legislation which is not\r\nthoroughly discussed by the legislating body is practically done in a\r\ncorner. It is impossible for Congress itself to do wisely what it does\r\nso hurriedly; and the constituencies cannot understand what Congress\r\ndoes not itself stop to consider. The prerogatives of the Committees\r\nrepresent something more than a mere convenient division of labor. There\r\nis only one part of its business to which Congress, as a whole,\r\nattends,--that part, namely, which is embraced under the privileged\r\nsubjects of revenue and supply. The House never accepts the proposals of\r\nthe Committee of Ways and Means, or of the Committee on Appropriations,\r\nwithout due deliberation; but it allows almost all of its other Standing\r\nCommittees virtually to legislate for it. In form, the Committees only\r\ndigest the various matter introduced by individual members, and prepare\r\nit, with care, and after thorough investigation, for the final\r\nconsideration and action of the House; but, in reality, they dictate the\r\ncourse to be taken, prescribing the decisions of the House not only,\r\nbut measuring out, according to their own wills, its opportunities for\r\ndebate and deliberation as well. The House sits, not for serious\r\ndiscussion, but to sanction the conclusions of its Committees as rapidly\r\nas possible. It legislates in its committee-rooms; not by the\r\ndeterminations of majorities, but by the resolutions of\r\nspecially-commissioned minorities; so that it is not far from the truth\r\nto say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst\r\nCongress in its committee-rooms is Congress at work.\r\n\r\nHabit grows fast, even upon the unconventional American, and the nature\r\nof the House of Representatives has, by long custom, been shaped to the\r\nspirit of its rules. Representatives have attained, by rigorous\r\nself-discipline, to the perfect stature of the law under which they\r\nlive, having purged their hearts, as completely as may be of all desire\r\nto do that which it is the chief object of that law to forbid by giving\r\nover a vain lust after public discussion. The entire absence of the\r\ninstinct of debate amongst them, and their apparent unfamiliarity with\r\nthe idea of combating a proposition by argument, was recently\r\nillustrated by an incident which was quite painfully amusing. The\r\ndemocratic majority of the House of the Forty-eighth Congress desired\r\nthe immediate passage of a pension bill of rather portentous\r\nproportions; but the republican minority disapproved of the bill with\r\ngreat fervor, and, when it was moved by the Pension Committee, late one\r\nafternoon, in a thin House, that the rules be suspended, and an early\r\nday set for a consideration of the bill, the Republicans addressed\r\nthemselves to determined and persistent \"filibustering\" to prevent\r\naction. First they refused to vote, leaving the Democrats without an\r\nacting quorum; then, all night long, they kept the House at roll-calling\r\non dilatory and obstructive motions, the dreary dragging of the time\r\nbeing relieved occasionally by the amusement of hearing the excuses of\r\nmembers who had tried to slip off to bed, or by the excitement of an\r\nangry dispute between the leaders of the two parties as to the\r\nresponsibility for the dead-lock. Not till the return of morning brought\r\nin the delinquents to recruit the democratic ranks did business advance\r\na single step. Now, the noteworthy fact about this remarkable scene is,\r\nthat the minority were not manoeuvring to gain opportunity or time for\r\ndebate, in order that the country might be informed of the true nature\r\nof the obnoxious bill, but were simply fighting a preliminary motion\r\nwith silent, dogged obstruction. After the whole night had been spent in\r\nstanding out against action, the House is said to have been \"in no mood\r\nfor the thirty-minutes' debate allowed by the rules,\" and a final vote\r\nwas taken, with only a word or two said. It was easier and more natural,\r\nas everybody saw, to direct attention to the questionable character of\r\nwhat was being attempted by the majority by creating a somewhat\r\nscandalous \"scene,\" of which every one would talk, than by making\r\nspeeches which nobody would read. It was a notable commentary on the\r\ncharacteristic methods of our system of congressional government.\r\n\r\nOne very noteworthy result of this system is to shift the theatre of\r\ndebate upon legislation from the floor of Congress to the privacy of the\r\ncommittee-rooms. Provincial gentlemen who read the Associated Press\r\ndispatches in their morning papers as they sit over their coffee at\r\nbreakfast are doubtless often very sorely puzzled by certain of the\r\nitems which sometimes appear in the brief telegraphic notes from\r\nWashington. What can they make of this for instance: \"The House\r\nCommittee on Commerce to-day heard arguments from the congressional\r\ndelegation from\" such and such States \"in advocacy of appropriations for\r\nriver and harbor improvements which the members desire incorporated in\r\nthe River and Harbor Appropriations Bill\"? They probably do not\r\nunderstand that it would have been useless for members not of the\r\nCommittee on Commerce to wait for any opportunity to make their\r\nsuggestions on the floor of Congress, where the measure to which they\r\nwish to make additions would be under the authoritative control of the\r\nCommittee, and where, consequently, they could gain a hearing only by\r\nthe courteous sufferance of the committee-man in charge of the report.\r\nWhatever is to be done must be done by or through the Committee.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that practically Congress, or at any rate the\r\nHouse of Representatives, delegates not only its legislative but also\r\nits deliberative functions to its Standing Committees. The little public\r\ndebate that arises under the stringent and urgent rules of the House is\r\nformal rather than effective, and it is the discussions which take place\r\nin the Committees that give form to legislation. Undoubtedly these\r\nsiftings of legislative questions by the Committees are of great value\r\nin enabling the House to obtain \"undarkened counsel\" and intelligent\r\nsuggestions from authoritative sources. All sober, purposeful,\r\nbusiness-like talk upon questions of public policy, whether it take\r\nplace in Congress or only before the Committees of Congress, is of great\r\nvalue; and the controversies which spring up in the committee-rooms,\r\nboth amongst the committee-men themselves and between those who appear\r\nbefore the Committees as advocates of special measures, cannot but\r\ncontribute to add clearness and definite consistency to the reports\r\nsubmitted to the House.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, several very obvious reasons why the most thorough\r\ncanvass of business by the Committees, and the most exhaustive and\r\ndiscriminating discussion of all its details in their rooms, cannot take\r\nthe place or fulfill the uses of amendment and debate by Congress in\r\nopen session. In the first place, the proceedings of the Committees are\r\nprivate and their discussions unpublished. The chief, and unquestionably\r\nthe most essential, object of all discussion of public business is the\r\nenlightenment of public opinion; and of course, since it cannot hear the\r\ndebates of the Committees, the nation is not apt to be much instructed\r\nby them. Only the Committees are enlightened. There is a conclusive\r\nobjection to the publication of the proceedings of the Committees, which\r\nis recognized as of course by all parliamentary lawyers, namely, that\r\nthose proceedings are of no force till confirmed by the House. A\r\nCommittee is commissioned, not to instruct the public, but to instruct\r\nand guide the House.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is not usual for the Committees to open their sittings often\r\nto those who desire to be heard with regard to pending questions; and no\r\none can demand a hearing as of right. On the contrary, they are\r\nprivileged and accustomed to hold their sessions in absolute secrecy. It\r\nis made a breach of order for any member to allude on the floor of the\r\nHouse to anything that has taken place in committee, \"unless by a\r\nwritten report sanctioned by a majority of the Committee;\" and there is\r\nno place in the regular order of business for a motion instructing a\r\nCommittee to conduct its investigations with open doors. Accordingly, it\r\nis only by the concession of the Committees that arguments are made\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nWhen they do suffer themselves to be approached, moreover, they\r\ngenerally extend the leave to others besides their fellow-congressmen.\r\nThe Committee on Commerce consents to listen to prominent railroad\r\nofficials upon the subject of the regulation of freight charges and\r\nfares; and scores of interested persons telegraph inquiries to the\r\nchairman of the Committee of Ways and Means as to the time at which they\r\nare to be permitted to present to the Committee their views upon the\r\nrevision of the tariff. The speeches made before the Committees at their\r\nopen sessions are, therefore, scarcely of such a kind as would be\r\ninstructive to the public, and on that account worth publishing. They\r\nare as a rule the pleas of special pleaders, the arguments of advocates.\r\nThey have about them none of the searching, critical, illuminating\r\ncharacter of the higher order of parliamentary debate, in which men are\r\npitted against each other as equals, and urged to sharp contest and\r\nmasterful strife by the inspiration of political principle and personal\r\nambition, through the rivalry of parties and the competition of\r\npolicies. They represent a joust between antagonistic interests, not a\r\ncontest of principles. They could scarcely either inform or elevate\r\npublic opinion, even if they were to obtain its heed.\r\n\r\nFor the instruction and elevation of public opinion, in regard to\r\nnational affairs, there is needed something more than special pleas for\r\nspecial privileges. There is needed public discussion of a peculiar\r\nsort: a discussion by the sovereign legislative body itself, a\r\ndiscussion in which every feature of each mooted point of policy shall\r\nbe distinctly brought out, and every argument of significance pushed to\r\nthe farthest point of insistence, by recognized leaders in that body;\r\nand, above all, a discussion upon which something--something of interest\r\nor importance, some pressing question of administration or of law, the\r\nfate of a party or the success of a conspicuous politician--evidently\r\ndepends. It is only a discussion of this sort that the public will heed;\r\nno other sort will impress it.\r\n\r\nThere could, therefore, be no more unwelcome revelation to one who has\r\nanything approaching a statesman-like appreciation of the essential\r\nconditions of intelligent self-government than just that which must\r\ninevitably be made to every one who candidly examines our congressional\r\nsystem; namely, that, under that system, such discussion is impossible.\r\nThere are, to begin with, physical and _architectural_ reasons why\r\nbusiness-like debate of public affairs by the House of Representatives\r\nis out of the question. To those who visit the galleries of the\r\nrepresentative chamber during a session of the House these reasons are\r\nas obvious as they are astonishing. It would be natural to expect that a\r\nbody which meets ostensibly for consultation and deliberation should\r\nhold its sittings in a room small enough to admit of an easy interchange\r\nof views and a ready concert of action, where its members would be\r\nbrought into close, sympathetic contact; and it is nothing less than\r\nastonishing to find it spread at large through the vast spaces of such a\r\nchamber as the hall of the House of Representatives, where there are no\r\nclose ranks of cooperating parties, but each member has a roomy desk and\r\nan easy revolving chair; where broad aisles spread and stretch\r\nthemselves; where ample, soft-carpeted areas lie about the spacious\r\ndesks of the Speaker and clerks; where deep galleries reach back from\r\nthe outer limits of the wide passages which lie beyond \"the bar\": an\r\nimmense, capacious chamber, disposing its giant dimensions freely\r\nbeneath the great level lacunar ceiling through whose glass panels the\r\nfull light of day pours in. The most vivid impression the visitor gets\r\nin looking over that vast hall is the impression of space. A speaker\r\nmust needs have a voice like O'Connell's, the practical visitor is apt\r\nto think, as he sits in the gallery, to fill even the silent spaces of\r\nthat room; how much more to overcome the disorderly noises that buzz and\r\nrattle through it when the representatives are assembled,--a voice\r\nclear, sonorous, dominant, like the voice of a clarion. One who speaks\r\nthere with the voice and lungs of the ordinary mortal must content\r\nhimself with the audience of those members in his own immediate\r\nneighborhood, whose ears he rudely assails in vehement efforts to\r\ncommand the attention of those beyond them, and who, therefore, cannot\r\nchoose but hear him.\r\n\r\nIt is of this magnitude of the hall of the representatives that those\r\nnews telegrams are significant which speak of an interesting or witty\r\nspeech in Congress as having drawn about the speaker listeners from all\r\nparts of the House. As one of our most noted wits would say, a member\r\nmust needs take a Sabbath day's journey to get within easy hearing\r\ndistance of a speaker who is addressing the House from the opposite\r\nside of the hall; for besides the space there are the noises\r\nintervening, the noises of loud talking and of the clapping of hands for\r\nthe pages, making the task of the member who is speaking \"very like\r\ntrying to address the people in the omnibuses from the curbstone in\r\nfront of the Astor House.\"[21]\r\n\r\nBut these physical limitations to debate, though serious and real, are\r\namongst the least important, because they are amongst the least\r\ninsuperable. If effective and business-like public discussions were\r\nconsidered indispensable by Congress, or even desirable, the present\r\nchamber could readily be divided into two halls: the one a commodious\r\nreading-room where the members might chat and write at ease as they now\r\ndo in the House itself; and the other a smaller room suitable for debate\r\nand earnest business. This, in fact, has been several times proposed,\r\nbut the House does not feel that there is any urgency about providing\r\nfacilities for debate, because it sees no reason to desire an increase\r\nof speech-making, in view of the fact that, notwithstanding all the\r\nlimitations now put upon discussion, its business moves much too slowly.\r\nThe early Congresses had time to talk; Congresses of to-day have not.\r\nBefore that wing of the Capitol was built in which the representative\r\nchamber now is, the House used to sit in the much smaller room, now\r\nempty save for the statuary to whose exhibition it is devoted; and there\r\nmuch speech-making went on from day to day; there Calhoun and Randolph\r\nand Webster and Clay won their reputations as statesmen and orators. So\r\nearnest and interesting were the debates of those days, indeed, that the\r\nprincipal speeches delivered in Congress seem to have been usually\r\nprinted at length in the metropolitan journals.[22] But the number and\r\nlength of the speeches was even then very much deplored; and so early as\r\n1828 a writer in the \"North American Review\" condemns what he calls \"the\r\nhabit of congressional debating,\" with the air of one who speaks against\r\nsome abuse which every one acknowledges to be a nuisance.[23] Eleven\r\nyears later a contributor to the \"Democratic Review\"[24] declared that\r\nit had \"been gravely charged upon\" Mr. Samuel Cushman, then a member of\r\nthe Twenty-fifth Congress from New Hampshire, \"that he moves the\r\nprevious question. Truly,\" continues the essayist, \"he does, and for\r\nthat very service, if he had never done anything else, he deserves a\r\nmonument as a public benefactor. One man who can arrest a tedious,\r\nlong-winded, factious, time-killing debate, is worth forty who can\r\nprovoke or keep one up. It requires some moral courage, some spirit, and\r\nsome tact also, to move the previous question, and to move it, too, at\r\nprecisely the right point of time.\"\r\n\r\nThis ardent and generous defense of Mr. Cushman against the odious\r\naccusation of moving the previous question would doubtless be\r\nexquisitely amusing to the chairman of one of the Standing Committees of\r\nthe Forty-eighth Congress, to whom the previous question seems one of\r\nthe commonest necessities of life. But, after all, he ought not to laugh\r\nat the ingenuous essayist, for that was not the heyday of the rules;\r\nthey then simply served and did not tyrannize over the House. They did\r\nnot then have the opportunity of empire afforded them by the scantiness\r\nof time which hurries the House, and the weight of business which\r\noppresses it; and they were at a greater disadvantage in a room where\r\noratory was possible than they are in a vast chamber where the orator's\r\nvoice is drowned amidst the noises of disorderly inattention. Nowadays\r\nwould-be debaters are easily thrust out of Congress and forced to resort\r\nto the printing-office; are compelled to content themselves with\r\nspeaking from the pages of the \"Record\" instead of from their places in\r\nthe House. Some people who live very far from Washington may imagine\r\nthat the speeches which are spread at large in the columns of the\r\n\"Congressional Record,\" or which their representative sends them in\r\npamphlet form, were actually delivered in Congress; but every one else\r\nknows that they were not; that Congress is constantly granting leave to\r\nits members to insert in the official reports of the proceedings\r\nspeeches which it never heard and does not care to hear, but which it is\r\nnot averse from printing at the public expense, if it is desirable that\r\nconstituents and the country at large should read them. It will not\r\nstand between a member and his constituents so long as it can indulge\r\nthe one and satisfy the others without any inconvenience to itself or\r\nany serious drain upon the resources of the Treasury. The public printer\r\ndoes not object.\r\n\r\nBut there are other reasons still more organic than these why the\r\ndebates of Congress cannot, under our present system, have that serious\r\npurpose of search into the merits of policies and that definite and\r\ndeterminate party--or, if you will, partisan--aim without which they can\r\nnever be effective for the instruction of public opinion, or the\r\ncleansing of political action. The chief of these reasons, because the\r\nparent of all the rest, is that there are in Congress no authoritative\r\nleaders who are the recognized spokesmen of their parties. Power is\r\nnowhere concentrated; it is rather deliberately and of set policy\r\nscattered amongst many small chiefs. It is divided up, as it were, into\r\nforty-seven seigniories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the\r\ncourt-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor. These petty barons, some\r\nof them not a little powerful, but none of them within reach of the full\r\npowers of rule, may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within\r\ntheir own shires, and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm\r\nitself; but both their mutual jealousies and their brief and restricted\r\nopportunities forbid their combining, and each is very far from the\r\noffice of common leader.\r\n\r\nI know that to some this scheme of distributed power and disintegrated\r\nrule seems a very excellent device whereby we are enabled to escape a\r\ndangerous \"one-man power\" and an untoward concentration of functions;\r\nand it is very easy to see and appreciate the considerations which make\r\nthis view of committee government so popular. It is based upon a very\r\nproper and salutary fear of _irresponsible_ power; and those who most\r\nresolutely maintain it always fight from the position that all\r\nleadership in legislation is hard to restrain in proportion to its size\r\nand to the strength of its prerogatives, and that to divide it is to\r\nmake it manageable. They aver, besides, that the less a man has to\r\ndo--that is to say, the more he is confined to single departments and to\r\ndefinite details--the more intelligent and thorough will his work be.\r\nThey like the Committees, therefore, just because they are many and\r\nweak, being quite willing to abide their being despotic within their\r\nnarrow spheres.\r\n\r\nIt seems evident, however, when the question is looked at from another\r\nstand-point, that, as a matter of fact and experience, the more power is\r\ndivided the more irresponsible it becomes. A mighty baron who can call\r\nhalf the country to arms is watched with greater jealousy, and,\r\ntherefore, restrained with more vigilant care than is ever vouchsafed\r\nthe feeble master of a single and solitary castle. The one cannot stir\r\nabroad upon an innocent pleasure jaunt without attracting the suspicious\r\nattention of the whole country-side; the other may vex and harry his\r\nentire neighborhood without fear of let or hindrance. It is ever the\r\nlittle foxes that spoil the grapes. At any rate, to turn back from\r\nillustration to the facts of the argument, it is plain enough that the\r\npetty character of the leadership of each Committee contributes towards\r\nmaking its despotism sure by making its duties uninteresting. The\r\nSenate almost always discusses its business with considerable\r\nthoroughness; and even the House, whether by common consent or by reason\r\nof such persistent \"filibustering\" on the part of the minority as\r\ncompels the reporting Committee and the majority to grant time for talk,\r\nsometimes stops to debate committee reports at length; but nobody,\r\nexcept, perhaps, newspaper editors, finds these debates interesting\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that many intelligent and patriotic people throughout this\r\ncountry, from Virginia to California,--people who, beyond all question,\r\nlove their State and the Union more than they love our cousin state over\r\nsea,--subscribe for the London papers in order to devour the\r\nparliamentary debates, and yet would never think of troubling themselves\r\nto make tedious progress through a single copy of the \"Congressional\r\nRecord\"? Is it because they are captivated by the old-world dignity of\r\nroyal England with its nobility and its court pageantry, or because of a\r\nvulgar desire to appear better versed than their neighbors in foreign\r\naffairs, and to affect familiarity with British statesmen? No; of course\r\nnot. It is because the parliamentary debates are interesting and ours\r\nare not. In the British House of Commons the functions and privileges of\r\nour Standing Committees are all concentrated in the hands of the\r\nMinistry, who have, besides, some prerogatives of leadership which even\r\nour Committees do not possess, so that they carry all responsibility as\r\nwell as great power, and all debate wears an intense personal and party\r\ninterest. Every important discussion is an arraignment of the Ministry\r\nby the Opposition,--an arraignment of the majority by the minority; and\r\nevery important vote is a party defeat and a party triumph. The whole\r\nconduct of the government turns upon what is said in the Commons,\r\nbecause the revelations of debate often change votes, and a Ministry\r\nloses hold upon power as it loses hold upon the confidence of the\r\nCommons. This great Standing Committee goes out whenever it crosses the\r\nwill of the majority. It is, therefore, for these very simple and\r\nobvious reasons that the parliamentary debates are read on this side of\r\nthe water in preference to the congressional debates. They affect the\r\nministers, who are very conspicuous persons, and in whom, therefore, all\r\nthe intelligent world is interested; and they determine the course of\r\npolitics in a great empire. The season of a parliamentary debate is a\r\ngreat field day on which Liberals and Conservatives pit their full\r\nforces against each other, and people like to watch the issues of the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nOur congressional debates, on the contrary, have no tithe of this\r\ninterest, because they have no tithe of such significance and\r\nimportance. The committee reports, upon which the debates take place,\r\nare backed by neither party; they represent merely the recommendations\r\nof a small body of members belonging to both parties, and are quite as\r\nlikely to divide the vote of the party to which the majority of the\r\nCommittee belong as they are to meet with opposition from the other side\r\nof the chamber. If they are carried, it is no party triumph; if they are\r\nlost, it is no party discomfiture. They are no more than the proposals\r\nof a mixed Committee, and may be rejected without political\r\ninconvenience to either party or reproof to the Committee; just as they\r\nmay be passed without compliment to the Committee or political advantage\r\nto either side of the House. Neither party has any great stake in the\r\ncontroversy. The only importance that can attach to the vote must hang\r\nupon its relation to the next general election. If the report concern a\r\nquestion which is at the time so much in the public eye that all action\r\nupon it is likely to be marked and remembered against the day of popular\r\naction, parties are careful to vote as solidly as possible on what they\r\nconceive to be the safe side; but all other reports are disposed of\r\nwithout much thought of their influence upon the fortunes of distant\r\nelections, because that influence is remote and problematical.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the national parties do not act in Congress under the\r\nrestraint of a sense of immediate responsibility. Responsibility is\r\nspread thin; and no vote or debate can gather it. It rests not so much\r\nupon parties as upon individuals; and it rests upon individuals in no\r\nsuch way as would make it either just or efficacious to visit upon them\r\nthe iniquity of any legislative act. Looking at government from a\r\npractical and business-like, rather than from a theoretical and\r\nabstractly-ethical point of view,--treating the business of government\r\nas a business,--it seems to be unquestionably and in a high degree\r\ndesirable that all legislation should distinctly represent the action of\r\nparties as parties. I know that it has been proposed by enthusiastic,\r\nbut not too practical, reformers to do away with parties by some\r\nlegerdemain of governmental reconstruction, accompanied and supplemented\r\nby some rehabilitation, devoutly to be wished, of the virtues least\r\ncommonly controlling in fallen human nature; but it seems to me that it\r\nwould be more difficult and less desirable than these amiable persons\r\nsuppose to conduct a government of the many by means of any other device\r\nthan party organization, and that the great need is, not to get rid of\r\nparties, but to find and use some expedient by which they can be managed\r\nand made amenable from day to day to public opinion. Plainly this\r\ncannot be effected by punishing here and there a member of Congress who\r\nhas voted for a flagrantly dishonest appropriation bill, or an obnoxious\r\nmeasure relating to the tariff. Unless the punishment can be extended to\r\nthe party--if any such be recognizable--with which these members have\r\nvoted, no advantage has been won for self-government, and no triumph has\r\nbeen gained by public opinion. It should be desired that parties should\r\nact in distinct organizations, in accordance with avowed principles,\r\nunder easily recognized leaders, in order that the voters might be able\r\nto declare by their ballots, not only their condemnation of any past\r\npolicy, by withdrawing all support from the party responsible for it;\r\nbut also and particularly their will as to the future administration of\r\nthe government, by bringing into power a party pledged to the adoption\r\nof an acceptable policy.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a fact of the most serious consequence that by our\r\nsystem of congressional rule no such means of controlling legislation is\r\nafforded. Outside of Congress the organization of the national parties\r\nis exceedingly well-defined and tangible; no one could wish it, and few\r\ncould imagine it, more so; but within Congress it is obscure and\r\nintangible. Our parties marshal their adherents with the strictest\r\npossible discipline for the purpose of carrying elections, but their\r\ndiscipline is very slack and indefinite in dealing with legislation. At\r\nleast there is within Congress no _visible_, and therefore no\r\n_controllable_ party organization. The only bond of cohesion is the\r\ncaucus, which occasionally whips a party together for cooperative action\r\nagainst the time for casting its vote upon some critical question. There\r\nis always a majority and a minority, indeed, but the legislation of a\r\nsession does not represent the policy of either; it is simply an\r\naggregate of the bills recommended by Committees composed of members\r\nfrom both sides of the House, and it is known to be usually, not the\r\nwork of the majority men upon the Committees, but compromise conclusions\r\nbearing some shade or tinge of each of the variously-colored opinions\r\nand wishes of the committee-men of both parties.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly the representation of both parties on the Committees that\r\nmakes party responsibility indistinct and organized party action almost\r\nimpossible. If the Committees were composed entirely of members of the\r\nmajority, and were thus constituted representatives of the party in\r\npower, the whole course of congressional proceedings would\r\nunquestionably take on a very different aspect. There would then\r\ncertainly be a compact opposition to face the organized majority.\r\nCommittee reports would be taken to represent the views of the party in\r\npower, and, instead of the scattered, unconcerted opposition, without\r\nplan or leaders, which now sometimes subjects the propositions of the\r\nCommittees to vexatious hindrances and delays, there would spring up\r\ndebate under skillful masters of opposition, who could drill their\r\npartisans for effective warfare and give shape and meaning to the\r\npurposes of the minority. But of course there can be no such definite\r\ndivision of forces so long as the efficient machinery of legislation is\r\nin the hands of both parties at once; so long as the parties are mingled\r\nand harnessed together in a common organization.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, therefore, that very few of the measures which come\r\nbefore Congress are party measures. They are, at any rate, not brought\r\nin as party measures. They are indorsed by select bodies of members\r\nchosen with a view to constituting an impartial board of examination for\r\nthe judicial and thorough consideration of each subject of legislation;\r\nno member of one of these Committees is warranted in revealing any of\r\nthe disagreements of the committee-room or the proportions of the votes\r\nthere taken; and no color is meant to be given to the supposition that\r\nthe reports made are intended to advance any party interest. Indeed,\r\nonly a very slight examination of the measures which originate with the\r\nCommittees is necessary to show that most of them are framed with a view\r\nto securing their easy passage by giving them as neutral and inoffensive\r\na character as possible. The manifest object is to dress them to the\r\nliking of all factions.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, neither the failure nor the success of any\r\npolicy inaugurated by one of the Committees can fairly be charged to the\r\naccount of either party. The Committee acted honestly, no doubt, and as\r\nthey thought best; and there can, of course, be no assurance that, by\r\ntaking away its congressional majority from the party to which the\r\ngreater number of the committee-men belong, a Committee could be secured\r\nwhich would act better or differently.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the whole matter is, then, that public opinion cannot\r\nbe instructed or elevated by the debates of Congress, not only because\r\nthere are few debates seriously undertaken by Congress, but principally\r\nbecause no one not professionally interested in the daily course of\r\nlegislation cares to read what is said by the debaters when Congress\r\ndoes stop to talk, inasmuch as nothing depends upon the issue of the\r\ndiscussion. The ordinary citizen cannot be induced to pay much heed to\r\nthe details, or even to the main principles, of law-making, unless\r\nsomething else more interesting than the law itself be involved in the\r\npending decision of the law-makers. If the fortunes of a party or the\r\npower of a great political leader are staked upon the final vote, he\r\nwill listen with the keenest interest to all that the principal actors\r\nmay have to say, and absorb much instruction in so doing; but if no such\r\nthings hang in the balance, he will not turn from his business to\r\nlisten; and if the true issues are not brought out in eager public\r\ncontests which catch his ear because of their immediate personal\r\ninterest, but must be sought amidst the information which can be made\r\ncomplete only by reading scores of newspapers, he will certainly never\r\nfind them or care for them, and there is small use in printing a\r\n\"Record\" which he will not read.\r\n\r\nI know not how better to describe our form of government in a single\r\nphrase than by calling it a government by the chairmen of the Standing\r\nCommittees of Congress. This disintegrate ministry, as it figures on the\r\nfloor of the House of Representatives, has many peculiarities. In the\r\nfirst place, it is made up of the elders of the assembly; for, by\r\ncustom, seniority in congressional service determines the bestowal of\r\nthe principal chairmanships; in the second place, it is constituted of\r\nselfish and warring elements; for chairman fights against chairman for\r\nuse of the time of the assembly, though the most part of them are\r\ninferior to the chairman of Ways and Means, and all are subordinate to\r\nthe chairman of the Committee on Appropriations; in the third place,\r\ninstead of being composed of the associated leaders of Congress, it\r\nconsists of the dissociated heads of forty-eight \"little legislatures\"\r\n(to borrow Senator Hoar's apt name for the Committees); and, in the\r\nfourth place, it is instituted by appointment from Mr. Speaker, who is,\r\nby intention, the chief judicial, rather than the chief political,\r\nofficer of the House.\r\n\r\nIt is highly interesting to note the extraordinary power accruing to Mr.\r\nSpeaker through this pregnant prerogative of appointing the Standing\r\nCommittees of the House. That power is, as it were, the central and\r\ncharacteristic inconvenience and anomaly of our constitutional system,\r\nand on that account excites both the curiosity and the wonder of the\r\nstudent of institutions. The most esteemed writers upon our Constitution\r\nhave failed to observe, not only that the Standing Committees are the\r\nmost essential machinery of our governmental system, but also that the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives is the most powerful functionary\r\nof that system. So sovereign is he within the wide sphere of his\r\ninfluence that one could wish for accurate knowledge as to the actual\r\nextent of his power. But Mr. Speaker's powers cannot be known\r\naccurately, because they vary with the character of Mr. Speaker. All\r\nSpeakers have, of late years especially, been potent factors in\r\nlegislation, but some have, by reason of greater energy or less\r\nconscience, made more use of their opportunities than have others.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker's privilege of appointing the Standing Committees is nearly\r\nas old as Congress itself. At first the House tried the plan of\r\nballoting for its more important Committees, ordering, in April, 1789,\r\nthat the Speaker should appoint only those Committees which should\r\nconsist of not more than three members; but less than a year's\r\nexperience of this method of organizing seems to have furnished\r\nsatisfactory proof of its impracticability, and in January, 1790, the\r\npresent rule was adopted: that \"All committees shall be appointed by the\r\nSpeaker, unless otherwise specially directed by the House.\" The rules of\r\none House of Representatives are not, however, necessarily the rules of\r\nthe next. No rule lives save by biennial readoption. Each newly-elected\r\nHouse meets without rules for its governance, and amongst the first acts\r\nof its first session is usually the adoption of the resolution that the\r\nrules of its predecessor shall be its own rules, subject, of course, to\r\nsuch revisions as it may, from time to time, see fit to make. Mr.\r\nSpeaker's power of appointment, accordingly, always awaits the passage\r\nof this resolution; but it never waits in vain, for no House, however\r\nfoolish in other respects, has yet been foolish enough to make fresh\r\ntrial of electing its Committees. That mode may do well enough for the\r\ncool and leisurely Senate, but it is not for the hasty and turbulent\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIt must always, of course, have seemed eminently desirable to all\r\nthoughtful and experienced men that Mr. Speaker should be no more than\r\nthe judicial guide and moderator of the proceedings of the House,\r\nkeeping apart from the heated controversies of party warfare, and\r\nexercising none but an impartial influence upon the course of\r\nlegislation; and probably when he was first invested with the power of\r\nappointment it was thought possible that he could exercise that great\r\nprerogative without allowing his personal views upon questions of public\r\npolicy to control or even affect his choice. But it must very soon have\r\nappeared that it was too much to expect of a man who had it within his\r\npower to direct affairs that he should subdue all purpose to do so, and\r\nshould make all appointments with an eye to regarding every preference\r\nbut his own; and when that did become evident, the rule was undoubtedly\r\nretained only because none better could be devised. Besides, in the\r\nearly years of the Constitution the Committees were very far from\r\nhaving the power they now possess. Business did not then hurry too fast\r\nfor discussion, and the House was in the habit of scrutinizing the\r\nreports of the Committees much more critically than it now pretends to\r\ndo. It deliberated in its open sessions as well as in its private\r\ncommittee-rooms, and the functionary who appointed its committees was\r\nsimply the nominator of its advisers, not, as is the Speaker of to-day,\r\nthe nominor of its rulers.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, that the office of Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives is in its present estate a constitutional phenomenon of\r\nthe first importance, deserving a very thorough and critical\r\nexamination. If I have succeeded, in what I have already said, in making\r\nclear the extraordinary power of the Committees in directing\r\nlegislation, it may now go without the saying that he who appoints those\r\nCommittees is an autocrat of the first magnitude. There could be no\r\nclearer proof of the great political weight of the Speaker's high\r\ncommission in this regard than the keen strife which every two years\r\ntakes place over the election to the speakership, and the intense\r\ninterest excited throughout the country as to the choice to be made. Of\r\nlate years, the newspapers have had almost as much to say about the\r\nrival candidates for that office as about the candidates for the\r\npresidency itself, having come to look upon the selection made as a sure\r\nindex of the policy to be expected in legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker is of course chosen by the party which commands the majority\r\nin the House, and it has sometimes been the effort of scheming,\r\nself-seeking men of that majority to secure the elevation of some friend\r\nor tool of their own to that office, from which he can render them\r\nservice of the most substantial and acceptable sort. But, although these\r\nintrigues have occasionally resulted in the election of a man of\r\ninsignificant parts and doubtful character, the choice has usually\r\nfallen upon some representative party man of well-known antecedents and\r\nclearly-avowed opinions; for the House cannot, and will not willingly,\r\nput up with the intolerable inconvenience of a weak Speaker, and the\r\nmajority are urged by self-respect and by all the weightiest\r\nconsiderations of expediency, as well as by a regard for the interests\r\nof the public business, to place one of their accredited leaders in the\r\nchair. If there be differences of opinion within the party, a choice\r\nbetween leaders becomes a choice between policies and assumes the\r\ngreatest significance. The Speaker is expected to constitute the\r\nCommittees in accordance with his own political views, and this or that\r\ncandidate is preferred by his party, not at all because of any supposed\r\nsuperiority of knowledge of the precedents and laws of parliamentary\r\nusage, but because of his more popular opinions concerning the leading\r\nquestions of the day.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, too, generally uses his powers as freely and imperatively\r\nas he is expected to use them. He unhesitatingly acts as the legislative\r\nchief of his party, organizing the Committees in the interest of this or\r\nthat policy, not covertly and on the sly, as one who does something of\r\nwhich he is ashamed, but openly and confidently, as one who does his\r\nduty. Nor does his official connection with the Committees cease upon\r\ntheir appointment. It is his care to facilitate their control of the\r\nbusiness of the House, by recognizing during the consideration of a\r\nreport only those members with whom the reporting committee-man has\r\nagreed to share his time, and by keeping all who address the House\r\nwithin the strictest letter of the rules as to the length of their\r\nspeeches, as well as by enforcing all those other restrictions which\r\nforbid independent action on the part of individual members. He must see\r\nto it that the Committees have their own way. In so doing he is not\r\nexercising arbitrary powers which circumstances and the habits of the\r\nassembly enable him safely to arrogate; he is simply enforcing the plain\r\nletter and satisfying the evident spirit of the rules.\r\n\r\nA student of Roman law and institutions, looking at the Rules of the\r\nHouse of Representatives through glasses unaccustomed to search out\r\naught but antiquities, might be excused for claiming that he found in\r\nthe customs of the House a striking reproduction of Roman legislative\r\nmethods. The Roman assembly, he would remind us, could not vote and\r\ndebate at the same time; it had no privileges of amendment, but had to\r\nadopt every law as a whole or reject it as a whole; and no private\r\nmember had a right to introduce a bill, that being the exclusive\r\nprerogative of the magistrates. But though he might establish a parallel\r\nsatisfactory to himself between the magistrates of Rome and the\r\nCommittees at Washington, and between the undebatable, unamendable laws\r\nof the ancient, and the undebated, unamended laws of the modern,\r\nrepublic, he could hardly find in the later system that compensating\r\nadvantage which scholars have noted as giving to Roman legislation a\r\nclearness and technical perfection such as is to be found in none of the\r\nmodern codes. Since Roman laws could not be amended in their passage,\r\nand must carry their meaning plainly to the comprehension of the\r\ncommons, clear and brief drafting was cultivated as of the first\r\nnecessity in drawing up measures which were first to gain popular\r\napproval and then to succeed or fail in accomplishing their ends\r\naccording as they proved workable or impracticable.\r\n\r\nNo such comparison of our own with other systems can, however, find any\r\nfavor in the eyes of a certain class of Americans who pride themselves\r\nupon being nothing if not patriotic, and who can consequently find no\r\nhigher praise for the peculiar devices of committee government than that\r\nthey are our own invention. \"An ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own.\"\r\nNo one will readily believe, however, that congressmen--even those of\r\nthem who belong to this dutiful class--cherish a very loving admiration\r\nfor the discipline to which they are nowadays subjected. As the\r\naccomplished librarian of Congress has declared, \"the general conviction\r\nmay be said to exist, that, under the great control over legislation and\r\ncurrent business by the Speaker, and by the powerful Committee on\r\nAppropriations, combined with the rigor of the Rules of the House, there\r\nis less and less opportunity for individual members to make any\r\ninfluential mark in legislation. Independence and ability are repressed\r\nunder the tyranny of the rules, and practically the power of the popular\r\nbranch of Congress is concentrated in the Speaker and a few--very\r\nfew--expert parliamentarians.\" And of course members of Congress see\r\nthis. \"We have but three forces in this House,\" exclaimed a jocose\r\nmember from the Pacific coast, \"the Brahmins of the Committee of Ways\r\nand Means--not the brains but the Brahmins of the House; the\r\nwhite-button mandarins of the Appropriations Committee; the dignified\r\noligarchy called the Committee on Rules; the Speaker of the House; and\r\nthe illustrious gentleman from Indiana.\" Naturally all men of\r\nindependent spirit chafe under the arbitrary restraints of such a\r\nsystem, and it would be much more philosophical to conclude that they\r\nlet it stand because they can devise nothing better, than that they\r\nadhere to its inconvenient practices because of their admiration for it\r\nas an American invention.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the number of those who misuse the rules is greater\r\nthan the number of those who strive to reform them. One of the most\r\nstartling of the prevalent abuses is the hasty passage of bills under a\r\nsuspension of the rules, a device \"by means of which,\" says Senator\r\nHoar, \"a large proportion, perhaps the majority, of the bills which pass\r\nthe House are carried through.\" This practice may be very clearly\r\nunderstood by following further Mr. Hoar's own words: \"Every Monday\r\nafter the morning hour, and at any time during the last ten days of a\r\nsession, motions to suspend the rules are in order. At these times any\r\nmember may move to suspend the rules and pass any proposed bill. It\r\nrequires two thirds of the members voting to adopt such a motion. Upon\r\nit no debate or amendment is in order. In this way, if two thirds of the\r\nbody agree, a bill is by a single vote, without discussion and without\r\nchange, passed through all the necessary stages, and made a law, so far\r\nas the House of Representatives can accomplish it; and in this mode\r\nhundreds of measures of vital importance receive, near the close of an\r\nexhausting session, without being debated, amended, printed, or\r\nunderstood, the constitutional assent of the representatives of the\r\nAmerican people.\"\r\n\r\nOne very obvious comment to be made upon habits of procedure so palpably\r\npernicious is, that nothing could be more natural under rules which\r\nrepress individual action with so much stringency. Then, too, the mills\r\nof the Committees are known to grind slowly, and a very quick and easy\r\nway of getting rid of minor items of business is to let particular\r\nbills, of apparently innocent meaning or laudable intent, run through\r\nwithout commitment. There must be some outlet, too, through which the\r\nwaters of delayed and accumulated business may be drained off as the end\r\nof a session draws near. Members who know how to take the House at an\r\nindulgent moment, and can in a few words make out a _prima facie_ case\r\nfor the action they urge, can almost always secure a suspension of the\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nTo speak very plainly, it is wonderful that under such a system of\r\ngovernment legislation is not oftener at sixes and sevens than it\r\nactually is. The infinitely varied and various interests of fifty\r\nmillions of active people would be hard enough to harmonize and serve,\r\none would think, were parties efficiently organized in the pursuit of\r\ndefinite, steady, consistent policies; and it is therefore simply\r\namazing to find how few outrageously and fatally foolish, how few bad or\r\ndisastrous, things have been done by means of our disintegrate methods\r\nof legislation. The Committees of the House to whom the principal topics\r\nof legislation are allotted number more than thirty. We are ruled by a\r\nscore and a half of \"little legislatures.\" Our legislation is\r\nconglomerate, not homogeneous. The doings of one and the same Congress\r\nare foolish in pieces and wise in spots. They can never, except by\r\naccident, have any common features. Some of the Committees are made up\r\nof strong men, the majority of them of weak men; and the weak are as\r\ninfluential as the strong. The country can get the counsel and guidance\r\nof its ablest representatives only upon one or two subjects; upon the\r\nrest it must be content with the impotent service of the feeble. Only a\r\nvery small part of its most important business can be done well; the\r\nsystem provides for having the rest of it done miserably, and the whole\r\nof it taken together done at haphazard. There could be no more\r\ninteresting problem in the doctrine of chances than that of reckoning\r\nthe probabilities of there being any common features of principle in the\r\nlegislation of an opening session. It might lighten and divert the\r\nleisure of some ingenious mathematician to attempt the calculation.\r\n\r\nIt was probably some such reflections as these which suggested the\r\nproposal, made not long since in the House, that there should be\r\nappointed, along with the usual Standing Committees, a new committee\r\nwhich should be known as the Executive Committee of the House, and\r\nshould be empowered to examine and sort all the bills reported favorably\r\nby the other Standing Committees, and bring them forward in what might\r\nseem to it the order of their importance; a committee which should, in\r\nshort, digest pending measures and guide the House in arranging its\r\norder of business. But it is seriously to be doubted whether such an\r\naddition to the present organization would do more than tighten the\r\ntyranny of committee rule and still further restrict freedom of debate\r\nand action. A committee to superintend committees would add very little\r\nto the efficiency of the House, and would certainly contribute nothing\r\ntowards unifying legislation, unless the new committee were to be given\r\nthe power, not yet thought of, of revising the work of the present\r\nStanding Committees. Such an executive committee is not quite the device\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nApparently committee government is but one of many experiments in the\r\ndirection of the realization of an idea best expressed--so far as my\r\nreading shows--by John Stuart Mill; and is too much like other\r\nexperiments to be quite as original and unique as some people would like\r\nto believe. There is, said Mr. Mill, a \"distinction between the function\r\nof _making_ laws, for which a numerous popular assembly is radically\r\nunfit, and that of _getting good laws made_, which is its proper duty,\r\nand cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled by any other authority;\" and\r\nthere is, consequently, \"need of a legislative commission, as a\r\npermanent part of the constitution of a free country; consisting of a\r\nsmall number of highly-trained political minds, on whom, when parliament\r\nhas determined that a law shall be made, the task of making it should be\r\ndevolved; parliament retaining the power of passing or rejecting the\r\nbill when drawn up, but not of altering it otherwise than by sending\r\nproposed amendments to be dealt with by the commission.\"[25] It would\r\nseem, as I have said, that committee government is one form of the\r\neffort, now making by all self-governing peoples, to set up a\r\nsatisfactory legislative commission somewhat after this order; and it\r\nmight appear to some as if the proposed executive committee were a\r\nslight approximation to that form of the effort which is typified in the\r\nlegislative functions of the British cabinet. It cannot, of course, be\r\nclaimed that the forty-eight legislative commissions of the House of\r\nRepresentatives always answer the purpose when the House wants to get\r\ngood laws made, or that each of them consists invariably of \"a small\r\nnumber of highly-trained political minds;\" but everybody sees that to\r\nsay that they fall short of realizing the ideal would be nothing less\r\nthan hypercritical.\r\n\r\nIn saying that our committee government has, germinally, some of the\r\nfeatures of the British system, in which the ministers of the crown, the\r\ncabinet, are chosen from amongst the leaders of the parliamentary\r\nmajority, and act not only as advisers of the sovereign but also as the\r\ngreat standing committee or \"legislative commission\" of the House of\r\nCommons, guiding its business and digesting its graver matters of\r\nlegislation, I mean, of course, only that both systems represent the\r\ncommon necessity of setting apart some small body, or bodies, of\r\nlegislative guides through whom a \"big meeting\" may get laws made. The\r\ndifference between our device and the British is that we have a\r\nStanding Committee, drawn from both parties, for the consideration of\r\neach topic of legislation, whereas our English cousins have but a single\r\nstanding committee that is charged with the origination of\r\nlegislation,--a committee composed of the men who are recognized as the\r\nleaders of the party dominant in the state, and who serve at the same\r\ntime as the political heads of the executive departments of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe British system is perfected party government. No effort is made in\r\nthe Commons, such as is made in the House of Representatives in the\r\ncomposition of the Committees, to give the minority a share in\r\nlaw-making. Our minorities are strongly represented on the Standing\r\nCommittees; the minority in the Commons is not represented at all in the\r\ncabinet. It is this feature of closely organized party government,\r\nwhereby the responsibility for legislation is saddled upon the majority,\r\nwhich, as I have already pointed out, gives to the debates and action of\r\nparliament an interest altogether denied to the proceedings of Congress.\r\nAll legislation is made a contest for party supremacy, and if\r\nlegislation goes wrong, or the majority becomes discontented with the\r\ncourse of policy, there is nothing for it but that the ministers should\r\nresign and give place to the leaders of the Opposition, unless a new\r\nelection should procure for them a recruited following. Under such a\r\nsystem mere silent voting is out of the question; debate is a primary\r\nnecessity. It brings the representatives of the people and the ministers\r\nof the Crown face to face. The principal measures of each session\r\noriginate with the ministers, and embody the policy of the\r\nadministration. Unlike the reports of our Standing Committees, which are\r\nintended to be simply the digested substance of the more sensible bills\r\nintroduced by private members, the bills introduced into the House of\r\nCommons by the cabinet embody the definite schemes of the government;\r\nand the fact that the Ministry is made up of the leaders of the majority\r\nand represents always the principles of its party, makes the minority\r\nonly the more anxious to have a chance to criticise its proposals.\r\nCabinet government is a device for bringing the executive and\r\nlegislative branches into harmony and cooperation without uniting or\r\nconfusing their functions. It is as if the majority in the Commons\r\ndeputized its leaders to act as the advisers of the Crown and the\r\nsuperintendents of the public business, in order that they might have\r\nthe advantage of administrative knowledge and training in advising\r\nlegislation and drafting laws to be submitted to parliament. This\r\narrangement enlists the majority in behalf of successful administration\r\nwithout giving the ministers any power to coerce or arbitrarily\r\ninfluence legislative action. Each session of the Lords and Commons\r\nbecomes a grand inquest into the affairs of the empire. The two estates\r\nsit as it were in committee on the management of the public\r\nbusiness--sit with open doors, and spare themselves no fatigue in\r\nsecuring for every interest represented a full, fair, and impartial\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nIt is evident why public debate is the very breath of life to such a\r\nsystem. The Ministry's tenure of office depends upon the success of the\r\nlegislation they urge. If any of their proposals are negatived by\r\nparliament, they are bound to accept their defeat as an intimation that\r\ntheir administration is no longer acceptable to the party they\r\nrepresent, and are expected to resign, or to appeal, if they prefer, to\r\nthe country for its verdict, by exercising their privilege of advising\r\nthe sovereign to dissolve parliament and issue writs for a new election.\r\nIt is, consequently, inevitable that the Ministry should be subjected to\r\nthe most determined attacks and the keenest criticisms of the\r\nOpposition, and should be every day of the session put to the task of\r\nvindicating their course and establishing anew their claim to the\r\nconfidence of their party. To shrink from discussion would be to confess\r\nweakness; to suffer themselves to be worsted in discussion would be\r\nseriously to imperil their power. They must look to it, therefore, not\r\nonly that their policy be defensible, but that it be valiantly defended\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, then, the Ministry seldom find the task of leading\r\nthe House an easy one. Their plans are kept under an unceasing fire of\r\ncriticism from both sides of the House; for there are independent\r\nsharp-shooters behind the ministers as well as heavy batteries in front\r\nof them; and there are many amongst their professed followers who give\r\naid and comfort to the enemy. There come ever and again showers of\r\nstinging questions, too, from friends and foes alike,--questions great\r\nand small, direct and indirect, pertinent and impertinent, concerning\r\nevery detail of administration and every tendency of policy.\r\n\r\nBut, although the initiative in legislation and the general direction of\r\nthe business of parliament are the undisputed prerogatives of \"the\r\ngovernment,\" as the Ministry is called, they have not, of course, all\r\nthe time of the House at their disposal. During the session, certain\r\ndays of each week are set apart for the introduction and debate of bills\r\nbrought in by private members, who, at the opening of the session, draw\r\nlots to decide the precedence of their bills or motions on the orders of\r\nthe day. If many draw, those who get last choice of time find the\r\nsession near its end, and private members' days being absorbed by\r\nbelated government measures, before their opportunity has come, and must\r\ncontent themselves with hoping for better fortune next year; but time is\r\ngenerally found for a very fair and full consideration of a large number\r\nof private members' bills, and no member is denied a chance to air his\r\nfavorite opinions in the House or to try the patience of his\r\nfellow-members by annual repetitions of the same proposition. Private\r\nmembers generally find out by long experience, however, that they can\r\nexert a more telling influence upon legislation by pressing amendments\r\nto government schemes, and can effect more immediate and satisfactory\r\nresults by keeping the Ministry constantly in mind of certain phases of\r\npublic opinion, than they could hope to exert or effect by themselves\r\nintroducing measures upon which their party might hesitate to unite.\r\nLiving as he does under a system which makes it the minister's wisest\r\npolicy to allow the utmost freedom of debate, each member can take as\r\nprominent a part in the proceedings of the House as his abilities give\r\nhim title to take. If he have anything which is not merely frivolous to\r\nsay, he will have repeated opportunities to say it; for the Commons\r\ncough down only the bores and the talkers for the sake of talk.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, as well as our House of Representatives, has its\r\ncommittees, even its standing committees, but they are of the\r\nold-fashioned sort which merely investigate and report, not of the new\r\nAmerican type which originate and conduct legislation. Nor are they\r\nappointed by the Speaker. They are chosen with care by a \"Committee of\r\nSelection\" composed of members of both parties. The Speaker is kept\r\ncarefully apart from politics in all his functions, acting as the\r\nimpartial, judicial president of the body. \"Dignity of presence,\r\ncourtliness of manner, great physical endurance, courage and\r\nimpartiality of judgment, a consummate tact, and familiarity, 'born of\r\nlife-long experience,' with the written and unwritten laws of the\r\nHouse,\"--such are the qualities of the ideal Speaker. When he takes the\r\nchair he turns his back on partisan alliances and serves both parties\r\nalike with even hand. Such are the traditions of the office that its\r\noccupant feels himself as strictly bound to unbiased judgment as is the\r\nchiefest judge of the realm; and it has become no uncommon thing for a\r\nSpeaker of tried ability to preside during several successive\r\nParliaments, whether the party to whose suffrages he originally owed his\r\nelevation remains in power or no. His political principles do not affect\r\nhis fitness for judicial functions.\r\n\r\nThe Commons in session present an interesting picture. Constrained by\r\ntheir habits of debate to sit in quarters suitable for the purpose, they\r\ncrowd together in a hall of somewhat cramped proportions. It seems a\r\nplace fit for hand to hand combats. The cushioned benches on which the\r\nmembers sit rise in close series on either side of a wide central aisle\r\nwhich they face. At one end of this aisle is raised the Speaker's chair,\r\nbelow and in front of which, invading the spaces of the aisle, are the\r\ndesks of the wigged and gowned clerks. On the front benches nearest the\r\nSpeaker and to his right sit the cabinet ministers, the leaders of the\r\nGovernment; opposite, on the front benches to the Speaker's left, sit\r\nthe leaders of the Opposition. Behind and to the right of the ministers\r\ngather the majority; behind and to the left of their leaders, the\r\nminority. Above the rear benches and over the outer aisles of the House,\r\nbeyond \"the bar,\" hang deep galleries from which the outside world may\r\nlook down upon the eager contests of the two parties which thus sit face\r\nto face with only the aisle between them. From these galleries the\r\nfortunate listen to the words of leaders whose names fill the ear of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the French Assembly is in the main similar to that\r\nof the British Commons. Its leaders are the executive officers of the\r\ngovernment, and are chosen from the ranks of the legislative majority by\r\nthe President of the Republic, much as English cabinets are chosen by\r\nEnglish sovereigns. They too are responsible for their policy and the\r\nacts of their administration to the Chamber which they lead. They, like\r\ntheir British prototypes, are the executive committee of the legislative\r\nbody, and upon its will their tenure of office depends.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, however, that the proceedings of the French Assembly\r\nvery closely resemble those of the British Commons. In the hall of the\r\nDeputies there are no close benches which face each other, and no two\r\nhomogeneous parties to strive for the mastery. There are parties and\r\nparties, factions and factions, coteries and coteries. There are\r\nBonapartists and Legitimatists, Republicans and Clericals, stubborn\r\nreactionists and headlong radicals, stolid conservatives and vindictive\r\ndestructionists. One hears of the Centre, the Right Centre and the Left\r\nCentre, the Right, the Left, the Extreme Right and the Extreme Left.\r\nSome of these are, of course, mere factions, mere groups of\r\nirreconcilables; but several of them are, on the other hand, numerous\r\nand powerful parties upon whose mutual attractions and repulsions depend\r\nthe formation, the authority, and the duration of cabinets.\r\n\r\nOf course, too, there is in a body so made up a great deal of\r\ncombustible material which the slightest circumstance suffices to kindle\r\ninto a sudden blaze. The Assembly would not be French if it were not\r\nalways excitable and sometimes uproarious. Absolute turbulence is so\r\nprobable a contingency in its economy that a very simple and quickly\r\napplicable device is provided for its remedy. Should the deputies lose\r\ntheir heads altogether and become unmanageable, the President may _put\r\non his hat_, and by that sign, unless calm be immediately restored, the\r\nsitting is adjourned for one hour, at the expiration of which time it is\r\nto be expected that the members may resume the business of the day in a\r\ncooler frame of mind. There are other rules of procedure observed in the\r\nChamber which seem to foreign eyes at first sight very novel; but which\r\nupon closer examination may be seen to differ from some of the practices\r\nof our own House of Representatives in form rather than in essence. In\r\nFrance greater freedom of speech is allowed individual members than is\r\npossible under committee government, but recognition is not given to\r\njust any one who first gets the floor and catches the presiding\r\nofficer's eye, as it is in the House of Commons, where none but the\r\nministers are accorded any right of precedence in gaining a hearing.\r\nThose who wish to speak upon any pending question \"inscribe\" their\r\nnames beforehand on a list in the keeping of the President, and the\r\ndiscussion is usually confined to those members who have \"inscribed.\"\r\nWhen this list has been exhausted, the President takes the sense of the\r\nChamber as to whether the debate shall be closed. The Chamber need not\r\nwait, however, to hear all the gentlemen who have put their names upon\r\nthe list. If _une portion notable_ of it tires sooner of the discussion\r\nor thinks itself sufficiently informed before all who wish to inform it\r\nhave spoken, it may demand that the debate be brought to an end. Of\r\ncourse such a demand will not be heeded if it come from only a few\r\nisolated members, and even _une portion notable_ may not interrupt a\r\nspeaker with this peremptory call for what we should denominate the\r\nprevious question, but which the French parliamentarian knows as the\r\n_cloture_. A demand for the _cloture_ is not debatable. One speech may\r\nbe made against it, but none in its favor. Unless it meet with very\r\npowerful resistance, it is expected to go through of its own weight.\r\nEven the _cloture_, however, must give way if a member of the Ministry\r\nclaims the right to speak; for a minister must always be heard, and\r\nafter he has spoken, moreover, there must always be allowed one speech\r\nin reply. Neither can the _cloture_ be pronounced unless a majority of\r\nthe deputies are present; and in case of doubt as to the will of the\r\nChamber in the matter, after two votes have been taken without eliciting\r\na full-voiced and indubitable assent, the discussion is tacitly suffered\r\nto proceed.\r\n\r\nThese rules are not quite so compulsive and inexorable as are those\r\nwhich sustain the government of our Standing Committees, nor do they\r\nseem quite imperative enough for the effectual governance of rampant\r\ndeputies in their moments of wildest excitement; but they are somewhat\r\nmore rigid than one would expect to find under a system of ministerial\r\nresponsibility, the purity of whose atmosphere depends so directly upon\r\na free circulation of debate. They are meant for a body of peculiar\r\nhabits and a fiery temperament,--a body which is often brought screaming\r\nto its feet by the words of a passionate speaker, which is time and\r\nagain betrayed into stormy disquiet, and which is ever being blown about\r\nby every passing wind of excitement. Even in its minor points of\r\nobservance, the Chamber is essentially un-English. Members do not speak\r\nfrom their seats, as we are accustomed to see members of our public\r\nassemblies do, but from the \"tribune,\" which is a conspicuous structure\r\nerected near the desks of the President and secretaries,--a box-like\r\nstand, closely resembling those narrow, quaintly-fashioned pulpits which\r\nare still to be seen in some of the oldest of our American churches. And\r\nsince deputies must gain its commanding top before they may speak, there\r\nare said to be many exciting races for this place of vantage. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, very unseemly scenes take place, when several deputies, all\r\nequally eager to mount the coveted stand, reach its narrow steps at the\r\nsame moment and contest the privilege of precedence,--especially if\r\ntheir friends rally in numbers to their assistance.\r\n\r\nThe British House of Commons and the French Chamber, though so unlike in\r\nthe elements which compose them, and so dissimilar in their modes of\r\nprocedure, are easily seen to be alike in constitutional significance,\r\nbeing made close kin by the principle of cabinet government, which they\r\nboth recognize and both apply in its fullest efficacy. In both England\r\nand France a ministry composed of the chief officers of the executive\r\ndepartments are constituted at once the leaders of legislation and the\r\nresponsible heads of administration,--a binding link between the\r\nlegislative and executive branches of the government. In this regard\r\nthese two systems present a strong contrast to our own. They recognize\r\nand support simple, straightforward, inartificial party government,\r\nunder a standing committee of responsible party leaders, bringing\r\nlegislature and executive side by side in intimate but open cooperation;\r\nwhilst we, preferring to keep Congress and the departments at arm's\r\nlength, permit only a less direct government by party majorities,\r\nchecking party action by a complex legislative machinery of two score\r\nand eight composite, semi-ministerial Committees. The English take their\r\nparties straight,--we take ours mixed.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect, however, in which all three of these systems\r\nare alike. They are alike in their essential purpose, which is to enable\r\na mass meeting of representatives to superintend administration and get\r\ngood laws made. Congress does not deal so directly with our executive as\r\ndo the French and English parliaments with theirs, and cannot,\r\ntherefore, control it quite so effectually; there is a great deal of\r\nfriction amongst the many wheels of committee government; but, in the\r\nlong run, Congress is quite as omnipotent as either the Chamber of\r\nDeputies or the House of Commons; and, whether there be two score\r\ncommittees with functions mainly legislative, or only one with functions\r\nhalf legislative, half executive, we have one form or another of\r\nsomething like Mr. Mill's \"legislative commission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nREVENUE AND SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n     The highest works of statesmanship require these three things:\r\n     Great power in the minister, genius to counsel and support him,\r\n     enlightenment in parliament to weigh and decide upon his\r\n     plans.--PROFESSOR SEELEY.\r\n\r\n     When men are not acquainted with each other's principles, nor\r\n     experienced in each other's talents, nor at all practiced in their\r\n     mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts of business; no\r\n     personal confidence, no friendship, no common interest subsisting\r\n     among them; it is evidently impossible that they can act a public\r\n     part with uniformity, perseverance, or efficacy.--BURKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It requires,\" says Mr. Bagehot, \"a great deal of time to have\r\nopinions,\" and if one is to judge from the legislative experience of\r\nsome very enlightened nations, it requires more time to have opinions\r\nabout finance than about any other subject. At any rate, very few\r\nnations have found time to have correct opinions about it. Governments\r\nwhich never consult the governed are usually content with very shabby,\r\nshort-sighted methods of taxation,--with any methods, indeed, which can\r\nbe made to yield the desired revenues without much trouble; and the\r\nagents of a self-governing people are quite sure to be too busy with\r\nelections and party management to have leisure to improve much upon the\r\npractices of autocrats in regard to this important care of\r\nadministration. And yet this subject of finance seems to be interesting\r\nenough in a way. It is one of the commonplaces of our history that, ever\r\nsince long before we came westward across the ocean, we have been\r\nreadier to fight about taxation than about any other one thing,--than\r\nabout a good many other things put together, indeed. There are several\r\nsadly bloody spots in the financial history of our race. It could\r\nprobably be shown, however, if one cared to take time to show it, that\r\nit is easy to get vexed about mismanagement of the finances without\r\nknowing how they might be better managed. What we do not like is that we\r\nare taxed,--not that we are stupidly taxed. We do not need to be\r\npolitical economists to get angry about it; and when we have gotten\r\nangry about it in the past our rulers have not troubled themselves to\r\nstudy political economy in order to find out the best means of appeasing\r\nus. Generally they have simply shifted the burden from the shoulders of\r\nthose who complained, and were able to make things unpleasant, to the\r\nshoulders of those who might complain, but could not give much trouble.\r\n\r\nOf course there are some taxes which are much more hateful than others,\r\nand have on that account to be laid more circumspectly. All direct taxes\r\nare heartily disliked by every one who has to pay them, and as heartily\r\nabused, except by those who have never owned an ounce or an inch of\r\nproperty, and have never seen a tax-bill. The heart of the ordinary\r\ncitizen regards them with an inborn aversion. They are so\r\nstraightforward and peremptory in their demands. They soften their\r\nexactions with not a grain of consideration. The tax-collector,\r\nconsequently, is never esteemed a lovable man. His methods are too\r\nblunt, and his powers too obnoxious. He comes to us, not with a\r\n\"please,\" but with a \"must.\" His requisitions always leave our pockets\r\nlighter and our hearts heavier. We cannot, for the life of us, help\r\nthinking, as we fold up his receipt and put it away, that government is\r\nmuch too expensive a luxury as nowadays conducted, and that that receipt\r\nis incontestable documentary proof of unendurable extortion. What we do\r\nnot realize is, that life would be robbed of one of its chief\r\nsatisfactions if this occasion of grumbling were to be taken away.\r\n\r\nIndirect taxes, on the other hand, offend scarcely anybody. It is one of\r\nthe open secrets of finance that in almost every system of taxation the\r\nindirect overcrow the direct taxes by many millions, and have a knack\r\nfor levying on the small resources of insignificant persons which direct\r\ntaxes have never learned. They know how to coax pennies out of poor\r\npeople whose names have never been on the tax-collector's books. But\r\nthey are very sly, and have at command a thousand successful disguises.\r\nHigh or complicated tariffs afford them their most frequent and abundant\r\nopportunities. Most people have very short thoughts, which do not extend\r\nbeyond the immediate phenomena of direct vision, and so do not recognize\r\nthe hand of the government in the high prices charged them in the shops.\r\nVery few of us taste the tariff in our sugar; and I suppose that even\r\nvery thoughtful topers do not perceive the license-tax in their whiskey.\r\nThere is little wonder that financiers have always been nervous in\r\ndealing with direct, but confident and free of hand in laying indirect,\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, be accounted one of the customary advantages which\r\nour federal government possesses over the governments of the States,\r\nthat it has almost always, in ordinary times, derived its entire revenue\r\nfrom prompt and facile indirect taxes, whilst the States have had to\r\nlive upon the tardy and begrudged income derivable from a direct levy.\r\nSince we have had to support two governments it has been wisely\r\nresolved to let us, as long as possible, feel the weight of only one of\r\nthem,--and that the one which can get at us most readily, and, at the\r\nsame time, be most easily and promptly controlled by our votes. It is a\r\nplain, convenient, and, on the whole, satisfactory division of domain,\r\nthough the responsibility which it throws on state legislatures is more\r\napt to pinch and prove vexatious than is that which it lays upon\r\nCongress. Mr. Gladstone, the greatest of English financiers, once\r\nplayfully described direct and indirect taxes as two sisters,--daughters\r\nof Necessity and Invention,--\"differing only as sisters may differ, ...\r\nthe one being more free and open, the other somewhat more shy, retiring,\r\nand insinuating;\" and frankly owned that, whether from \"a lax sense of\r\nmoral obligation or not,\" he, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, \"thought\r\nit not only allowable, but even an act of duty, to pay his addresses to\r\nthem both.\" But our chancellors of the exchequer, the chairmen of the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means, are bound by other traditions of courtship,\r\nand have, besides, usually shown no susceptibility to the charms of the\r\nblunt and forward elder of these two sisters. They have been constant,\r\neven if now and again a little wayward, in their devotion to the\r\nyounger.\r\n\r\nI suppose that no one ever found the paths of finance less thorny and\r\narduous than have our national publicists. If their tasks be compared\r\nwith those of European and English financiers, it is plain to see that\r\ntheir lines have fallen in pleasant places. From almost the very first\r\nthey have had boundless resources to draw upon, and they have certainly\r\nof late days had free leave to spend limitless revenues in what\r\nextravagances they pleased. It has come to be infinitely more trouble to\r\nspend our enormous national income than to collect it. The chief\r\nembarrassments have arisen, not from deficits, but from surpluses. It is\r\nvery fortunate that such has been the case, because for the best\r\nmanagement of the finances of a nation, when revenue is scant and\r\neconomy imperative, it is absolutely necessary to have financial\r\nadministration in the hands of a few highly-trained and skillful men\r\nacting subject to a very strict responsibility, and this is just what\r\nour committee system does not allow. As in other matters of legislation,\r\nso in finance, we have many masters acting under a very dim and\r\ninoperative accountability. Of course under such ministration our\r\nfinancial policy has always been unstable, and has often strayed very\r\nfar from the paths of wisdom and providence; for even when revenue is\r\nsuperabundant and extravagance easy, irresponsible, fast and loose\r\nmethods of taxation and expenditure must work infinite harm. The only\r\ndifference is that during such times the nation is not so sensitive to\r\nthe ill effects wrought by careless policy. Mismanagement is not\r\ngenerally blamed until a great many people have discovered it by being\r\nhurt by it. Meantime, however, it is none the less interesting and\r\nimportant to study our government, with a view to gauging its qualities\r\nand measuring accurately its capabilities for good or bad service; and\r\nthe study can doubtless be much more dispassionately conducted before we\r\nhave been seriously hurt by foolish, unsteady administration than\r\nafterwards. The forces of the wind can be reckoned with much more\r\nreadily while they are blowing only a gale than after they have thrown a\r\nhurricane upon us.\r\n\r\nThe national income is controlled by one Committee of the House and one\r\nof the Senate; the expenditures of the government are regulated by\r\nfifteen Committees of the House and five of the Senate; and the currency\r\nis cared for by two Committees of the House and one of the Senate; by\r\nall of which it appears that the financial administration of the country\r\nis in the hands of twenty-four Committees of Congress,--a mechanism of\r\nnumerous small and great functions, quite complex enough to be worth\r\ncareful study, perhaps too complex to be studied directly without an\r\naiding knowledge of some simpler system with which it may be compared.\r\nOur own budget may be more readily followed through all the vicissitudes\r\nof committee scrutiny, and all the varied fortunes of committee action,\r\nafter one has traced some other budget through the simpler processes of\r\nsome other system of government.\r\n\r\nThe British system is, perhaps, in its main features, the simplest in\r\nexistence. It is, besides, the pattern after which the financial systems\r\nof the chief governments of Europe have been modeled, and which we have\r\nourselves in a measure copied; so that by prefacing the study of other\r\nsystems by a careful examination of the British, in its present form,\r\none may start with the great advantage of knowing the characteristics of\r\nwhat may fairly be called the parent stock. Parliament, then, in the\r\nfirst place, simply controls, it does not originate, measures of\r\nfinancial administration. It acts through the agency and under the\r\nguidance of the ministers of the Crown. Early in each annual session\r\n\"the estimates\" are submitted to the Commons, which, when hearing such\r\nstatements, sits in Committee of the Whole House, known as Committee of\r\nSupply. The estimates come before the House in truly formidable shape.\r\nEach department presents its estimates in a huge quarto volume, \"crammed\r\nwith figures and minute entries of moneys wanted for the forthcoming\r\nyear.\"[26] But the House itself does not have to digest this various and\r\noverwhelming mass of figures. The digesting is done in the first\r\ninstance by the official leaders of the House. \"The ministers in charge\r\nof the naval and military services lay before the Committee [of Supply]\r\ntheir respective statements of the sums which will be required for the\r\nmaintenance of those services; and somewhat later in the session a\r\ncommon estimate for the various civil services is submitted also.\" Those\r\nstatements are, as it were, condensed synopses of the details of the\r\nquartos, and are made with the object of rendering quite clear to the\r\nHouse, sitting under the informal rules of Committee, the policy of the\r\nexpenditures proposed and the correctness of the calculations upon which\r\nthey are based. Any member may ask what pertinent questions he pleases\r\nof the minister who is making the statement, so that nothing needing\r\nelucidation may be passed by without full explanation. After the\r\nstatement has been completed to the satisfaction of the Committee, a\r\nvote is taken, at the motion of the minister, upon each item of\r\nexpenditure, and the duties of the Committee of Supply have been\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe estimates are always submitted \"on the collective responsibility of\r\nthe whole cabinet.\" \"The army and navy estimates have, as a rule, been\r\nconsidered and settled in cabinet council before being submitted to the\r\nHouse; and the collective responsibility of the Ministry is in this\r\ncase, therefore, not technical merely, but substantial.\" If the\r\nestimates are resisted and rejected by the Committee, the ministers, of\r\ncourse, resign. They \"cannot acquiesce in a refusal on the part of\r\nparliament to sanction the expenditure which\" they \"have assumed the\r\nresponsibility of declaring necessary for the support of the civil\r\ngovernment, and the maintenance of the public credit at home and\r\nabroad.\" The votes in Committee of Supply are, therefore, vital in the\r\nhistory of every administration, being taken as sure indexes of the\r\namount of confidence placed by the House in the government.\r\n\r\nBut the votes in Committee of Supply are only the first steps in\r\nparliament's annual supervision of the public finances. They are simply\r\nthe spending votes. In order to consider the means by which money is to\r\nbe raised to meet the outlays sanctioned by the Committee of Supply, the\r\nHouse resolves itself into Committee of the Whole, under the name of the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means. It is to this Committee that the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer submits his budget every year, on or soon\r\nbefore the fifth of April, the date at which the national accounts are\r\nmade up, the financial year closing on the thirty-first of March. In\r\norder to prepare his budget, the Chancellor must of course have early\r\nknowledge of the estimates made for the various services. Several\r\nmonths, therefore, before the estimates are laid before the House in\r\nCommittee of Supply, the various departments are called upon by the\r\nTreasury to send in statements of the sums required to defray the\r\nexpenses of the current year, and these estimates are carefully examined\r\nby the Chancellor, with a view not only to exercising his duty of\r\nkeeping the expenditures within the limits of economy, but also to\r\nascertaining how much revenue he will have to secure in order to meet\r\nthe proper expenditure contemplated. He must balance estimated needs\r\nover against estimated resources, and advise the House in Committee of\r\nWays and Means as to the measures by which taxation is to be made to\r\nafford sufficient revenue. Accordingly he calls in the aid of the\r\npermanent heads of the revenue departments who furnish him with \"their\r\nestimates of the public revenue for the ensuing year, upon the\r\nhypothesis that taxation will remain unchanged.\"\r\n\r\nHaving with such aids made up his budget, the Chancellor goes before the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means prepared to give a clear history of the\r\nfinancial administration of the year just closed, and to submit definite\r\nplans for adjusting the taxation and providing for the expected outlays\r\nof the year just opening. The precedents of a wise policy of long\r\nstanding forbid his proposing to raise any greater revenue than is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the support of the government and the\r\nmaintenance of the public credit. He therefore never asks the Committee\r\nto lay taxes which promise a considerable surplus. He seeks to obtain\r\nonly such an over-plus of income as will secure the government against\r\nthose slight errors of underestimation of probable expenses or of\r\noverestimation of probable revenue as the most prudent of\r\nadministrations is liable to make. If the estimated revenue considerably\r\nexceed the estimated expenses, he proposes such remissions of taxation\r\nas will bring the balance as near equality as prudence will permit; if\r\nthe anticipated expenses run beyond the figure of the hoped-for revenue,\r\nhe asks that certain new taxes be laid, or that certain existing taxes\r\nbe increased; if the balance between the two sides of the forecast\r\naccount shows a pretty near approach to equilibrium, so the scale of\r\nrevenue be but a little the heavier of the two, he contents himself\r\nwith suggesting such a readjustment of existing taxes as will be likely\r\nto distribute the burden of taxation more equitably amongst the\r\ntax-paying classes, or facilitate hampered collections by simplifying\r\nthe complex methods of assessment and imposition.\r\n\r\nSuch is the budget statement to which the House of Commons listens in\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means. This Committee may deal with the proposals\r\nof the Chancellor of the Exchequer with somewhat freer hand than the\r\nCommittee of Supply may use in passing upon the estimates. The Ministry\r\nis not so stiffly insistent upon having its budget sanctioned as it is\r\nupon having its proposed expenditures approved. It is understood to\r\npledge itself to ask for no more money than it honestly needs; but it\r\nsimply advises with the House as to the best way of raising that money.\r\nIt is punctiliously particular about being supplied with the funds it\r\nasks for, but not quite so exacting as to the ways and means of supply.\r\nStill, no Ministry can stand if the budget be rejected out of hand, or\r\nif its demands for the means of meeting a deficiency be met with a flat\r\nrefusal, no alternative means being suggested by the Opposition. Such\r\nvotes would be distinct declarations of a want of confidence in the\r\nMinistry, and would of course force them to resign.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Ways and Means, then, carries out, under the guidance\r\nof the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the resolutions of the Committee of\r\nSupply. The votes of the latter Committee, authorizing the expenditures\r\nmapped out in the estimates, are embodied in \"a resolution proposed in\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means for a general grant out of the Consolidated\r\nFund 'towards making good the supply granted to Her Majesty;'\" and that\r\nresolution, in order that it may be prepared for the consideration of\r\nthe House of Lords and the Crown, is afterwards cast by the House into\r\nthe form of a Bill, which passes through the regular stages and in due\r\ncourse becomes law. The proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nwith reference to changes in taxation are in like manner embodied in\r\nresolutions in Committee of Ways and Means, and subsequently, upon the\r\nreport of the Committee, passed by the House in the shape of Bills,\r\n\"Ways and Means Bills\" generally pass the Lords without trouble. The\r\nabsolute control of the Commons over the subjects of revenue and supply\r\nhas been so long established that the upper House would not now dream of\r\ndisputing it; and as the power of the Lords is simply a privilege to\r\naccept or reject a money bill as a whole, including no right to amend,\r\nthe peers are wont to let such bills go through without much scrutiny.\r\n\r\nBut so far I have spoken only of that part of parliament's control of\r\nthe finances which concerns the future. The \"Ways and Means Bills\"\r\nprovide for coming expenses and a prospective revenue. Past expenses are\r\nsupervised in a different way. There is a double process of audit by\r\nmeans of a special Audit Department of the Civil Service, which is, of\r\ncourse, a part of the permanent organization of the administration,\r\nhaving it in charge \"to examine the accounts and vouchers of the entire\r\nexpenditure,\" and a special committee nominated each year by the House\r\n\"to audit the Audit Department.\" This committee is usually made up of\r\nthe most experienced business men in the Commons, and before it \"all the\r\naccounts of the completed financial year are passed in review.\" \"Minute\r\ninquiries are occasionally made by it into the reasons why certain items\r\nof expenditure have occurred; it discusses claims for compensation,\r\ngrants, and special disbursements, in addition to the ordinary outgoings\r\nof the department, mainly, to be sure, upon the information and advice\r\nof the departments themselves, but still with a certain independence of\r\nview and judgment which must be valuable.\"\r\n\r\nThe strictness and explicitness with which the public accounts are kept\r\nof course greatly facilitate the process of audit. The balance which is\r\nstruck on the thirty-first of every March is of the most definite sort.\r\nIt deals only with the actual receipts and disbursements of the\r\ncompleted fiscal year. At that date all unexpended credits lapse. If the\r\nexpenditure of certain sums has been sanctioned by parliamentary vote,\r\nbut some of the granted moneys remain undrawn when April comes in, they\r\ncan be used only after a regrant by the Commons. There are, therefore,\r\nno unclosed accounts to obscure the view of the auditing authorities.\r\nTaxes and credits have the same definite period, and there are no\r\narrears or unexpended balances to confuse the book-keeping. The great\r\nadvantages of such a system in the way of checking extravagances which\r\nwould otherwise be possible, may be seen by comparing it with the system\r\nin vogue in France, in whose national balance-sheet \"arrears of taxes in\r\none year overlap with those of other years,\" and \"credits old jostle\r\ncredits new,\" so that it is said to be \"always three or four years\r\nbefore the nation can know what the definitive expenditure of a given\r\nyear is.\"\r\n\r\nFor the completion of this sketch of financial administration under the\r\nCommons it is of course necessary to add a very distinct statement of\r\nwhat I may call the _accessibility_ of the financial officers of the\r\ngovernment. They are always present to be questioned. The Treasury\r\ndepartment is, as becomes its importance, exceptionally well\r\nrepresented in the House. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the working\r\nchief of the department, is invariably a member of the Commons, \"and can\r\nbe called to account by interrogation or motion with respect to all\r\nmatters of Treasury concern\"--with respect, that is, to well-nigh \"the\r\nwhole sphere of the discipline and economy of the Executive Government;\"\r\nfor the Treasury has wide powers of supervision over the other\r\ndepartments in all matters which may in any way involve an outlay of\r\npublic money. \"And not only does the invariable presence of the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons make the\r\nrepresentation of that department peculiarly direct, but, through the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and, with respect to certain departmental\r\nmatters, through the Junior Lords, the House possesses peculiar\r\nfacilities for ascertaining and expressing its opinion upon the details\r\nof Treasury administration.\" It has its responsible servants always\r\nbefore it, and can obtain what glimpses it pleases into the inner\r\nworkings of the departments which it wishes to control.\r\n\r\nIt is just at this point that our own system of financial administration\r\ndiffers most essentially from the systems of England, of the Continent,\r\nand of the British colonial possessions. Congress does not come into\r\ndirect contact with the financial officers of the government. Executive\r\nand legislature are separated by a hard and fast line, which sets them\r\napart in what was meant to be independence, but has come to amount to\r\nisolation. Correspondence between them is carried on by means of written\r\ncommunications, which, like all formal writings, are vague, or by means\r\nof private examinations of officials in committee-rooms to which the\r\nwhole House cannot be audience. No one who has read official documents\r\nneeds to be told how easy it is to conceal the essential truth under the\r\napparently candid and all-disclosing phrases of a voluminous and\r\nparticularizing report; how different those answers are which are given\r\nwith the pen from a private office from those which are given with the\r\ntongue when the speaker is looking an assembly in the face. It is\r\nsufficiently plain, too, that resolutions which call upon officials to\r\ngive testimony before a committee are a much clumsier and less efficient\r\nmeans of eliciting information than is a running fire of questions\r\naddressed to ministers who are always in their places in the House to\r\nreply publicly to all interrogations. It is reasonable to conclude,\r\ntherefore, that the House of Representatives is much less intimately\r\nacquainted with the details of federal Treasury airs than is such a body\r\nas the House of Commons, with the particulars of management in the\r\nTreasury which it oversees by direct and constant communication with the\r\nchief Treasury officials.\r\n\r\nThis is the greater drawback in our system, because, as a further result\r\nof its complete separation from the executive, Congress has to originate\r\nand perfect the budget for itself. It does not hear the estimates\r\ntranslated and expounded in condensed statements by skilled officials\r\nwho have made it their business, because it is to their interest, to\r\nknow thoroughly what they are talking about; nor does it have the\r\nbenefit of the guidance of a trained, practical financier when it has to\r\ndetermine questions of revenue. The Treasury is not consulted with\r\nreference to problems of taxation, and motions of supply are disposed of\r\nwith no suggestions from the departments beyond an itemized statement of\r\nthe amounts needed to meet the regular expenses of an opening fiscal\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn federal book-keeping the fiscal year closes on the thirtieth of June.\r\nSeveral months before that year expires, however, the estimates for the\r\ntwelve months which are to succeed are made ready for the use of\r\nCongress. In the autumn each department and bureau of the public service\r\nreckons its pecuniary needs for the fiscal year which is to begin on the\r\nfollowing first of July (making explanatory notes, and here and there\r\nan interjected prayer for some unwonted expenditure, amongst the columns\r\nof figures), and sends the resulting document to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. These reports, including of course the estimates of the\r\nvarious bureaux of his own department, the Secretary has printed in a\r\nthin quarto volume of some three hundred and twenty-five pages, which\r\nfor some reason or other, not quite apparent, is called a \"Letter from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury transmitting estimates of appropriations\r\nrequired for the fiscal year ending June 30,\" ... and which boasts a\r\nvery distinct arrangement under the heads Civil Establishment, Military\r\nEstablishment, Naval Establishment, Indian Affairs, Pensions, Public\r\nWorks, Postal Service, etc., a convenient summary of the chief items,\r\nand a complete index.\r\n\r\nIn December this \"Letter\" is sent, as a part of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury's annual report to Congress, to the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, immediately after the convening of that body, and is\r\nreferred to the Standing Committee on Appropriations. The House itself\r\ndoes not hear the estimates read; it simply passes the thin quartos over\r\nto the Committee; though, of course, copies of it may be procured and\r\nstudied by any member who chooses to scrutinize the staring pages of\r\ncolumned figures with the dutiful purpose of keeping an eye upon the\r\nuses made of the public revenue. Taking these estimates into\r\nconsideration, the Committee on Appropriations found upon them the\r\n\"general appropriation bills,\" which the rules require them to report to\r\nthe House \"within thirty days after their appointment, at every session\r\nof Congress, commencing on the first Monday in December,\" unless they\r\ncan give satisfactory reasons in writing for not doing so. The \"general\r\nappropriation bills\" provide separately for legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial expenses; for sundry civil expenses; for consular and\r\ndiplomatic expenses; for the Army; for the Navy; for the expenses of the\r\nIndian department; for the payment of invalid and other pensions; for\r\nthe support of the Military Academy; for fortifications; for the service\r\nof the Post-Office department, and for mail transportation by ocean\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nIt was only through the efforts of a later-day spirit of vigilant\r\neconomy that this practice of making the appropriations for each of the\r\nseveral branches of the public service in a separate bill was\r\nestablished. During the early years of the Constitution very loose\r\nmethods of appropriation prevailed. All the moneys for the year were\r\ngranted in a single bill, entitled \"An Act making Appropriations for the\r\nsupport of the Government;\" and there was no attempt to specify the\r\nobjects for which they were to be spent. The gross sum given could be\r\napplied at the discretion of the heads of the executive departments, and\r\nwas always large enough to allow much freedom in the undertaking of new\r\nschemes of administration, and in the making of such additions to the\r\nclerical force of the different offices as might seem convenient to\r\nthose in control. It was not until 1862 that the present practice of\r\nsomewhat minutely specifying the uses to be made of the funds\r\nappropriated was reached, though Congress had for many years been by\r\nslow stages approaching such a policy. The history of appropriations\r\nshows that \"there has been an increasing tendency to limit the\r\ndiscretion of the executive departments, and bring the details of\r\nexpenditure more immediately under the annual supervision of Congress;\"\r\na tendency which has specially manifested itself since the close of the\r\nrecent war between the States.[27] In this, as in other things, the\r\nappetite for government on the part of Congress has grown with that\r\nperfection of organization which has rendered the gratification of its\r\ndesire for power easily attainable. In this matter of appropriations,\r\nhowever, increased care has unquestionably resulted in a very decided\r\ncurtailment of extravagance in departmental expenditure, though Congress\r\nhas often shown a blind ardor for retrenchment which has fallen little\r\nshort of parsimony, and which could not have found place in its\r\nlegislation had it had such adequate means of confidential communication\r\nwith the executive departments as would have enabled it to understand\r\ntheir real needs, and to discriminate between true economy and those\r\nscant allowances which only give birth to deficiencies, and which, even\r\nunder the luckiest conditions, serve only for a very brief season to\r\ncreate the impression which they are usually meant to beget,--that the\r\nparty in power is the party of thrift and honesty, seeing in former\r\nappropriations too much that was corrupt and spendthrift, and desiring\r\nto turn to the good ways of wisdom and frugality.\r\n\r\nThere are some portions of the public expenditure which do not depend\r\nupon the annual gifts of Congress, but which are provided for by\r\nstatutes which run without limit of date. These are what are known as\r\nthe \"permanent appropriations.\" They cover, on the one hand, such\r\nindeterminate charges as the interest on the public debt, the amounts\r\nannually paid into the sinking fund, the outlays of refunding, the\r\ninterest on the bonds issued to the Pacific Railways; and, on the other\r\nhand, such specific charges as the maintenance of the militia service,\r\nthe costs of the collection of the customs revenue, and the interest on\r\nthe bequest to the Smithsonian Institution. Their aggregate sum\r\nconstitutes no insignificant part of the entire public expense. In 1880,\r\nin a total appropriation of about $307,000,000, the permanent\r\nappropriations fell short of the annual grant by only about sixteen and\r\na half millions. In later years, however, the proportion has been\r\nsmaller, one of the principal items, the interest on the public debt,\r\nbecoming, of course, continually less as the debt is paid off, and other\r\nitems reaching less amounts, at the same time that the figures of the\r\nannual grants have risen rather than fallen.\r\n\r\nWith these permanent grants the Committee on Appropriations has, of\r\ncourse, nothing to do, except that estimates of the moneys to be drawn\r\nunder authority of such grants are submitted to its examination in the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury's \"Letter,\" along with the estimates for which\r\nspecial appropriations are asked. Upon these latter estimates the\r\ngeneral appropriations are based. The Committee may report its bills at\r\nany stage of the House's business, provided only that it does not\r\ninterrupt a member who is speaking; and these bills when reported may at\r\nany time, by a majority vote, be made a special order of the day. Of\r\ncourse their consideration is the most imperative business of the\r\nsession. They must be passed before the end of June, else the\r\ndepartments will be left altogether without means of support. The\r\nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations is, consequently, a very\r\nmasterful authority in the House. He can force it to a consideration of\r\nthe business of his Committee at almost any time; and by withholding his\r\nreports until the session is well advanced can crowd all other topics\r\nfrom the docket. For much time is spent over each of the \"general\r\nappropriation bills.\" The spending of money is one of the two things\r\nthat Congress invariably stops to talk about; the other being the\r\nraising of money. The talk is made always in Committee of the Whole,\r\ninto which the House at once resolves itself whenever appropriations are\r\nto be considered. While members of this, which may be called the House's\r\nCommittee of Supply, representatives have the freest opportunity of the\r\nsession for activity, for usefulness, or for meddling, outside the\r\nsphere of their own committee work. It is true that the \"five-minutes'\r\nrule\" gives each speaker in Committee of the Whole scant time for the\r\nexpression of his views, and that the House can refuse to accord full\r\nfreedom of debate to its other self, the Committee of the Whole, by\r\nlimiting the time which it is to devote to the discussion of matters\r\nreferred to it, or by providing for its discharge from the further\r\nconsideration of any bill committed to it, after it shall have acted\r\nwithout debate on all amendments pending or that may be offered; but as\r\na rule every member has a chance to offer what suggestions he pleases\r\nupon questions of appropriation, and many hours are spent in\r\nbusiness-like debate and amendment of such bills, clause by clause and\r\nitem by item. The House learns pretty thoroughly what is in each of its\r\nappropriation bills before it sends it to the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the dealings of the Senate with money bills\r\ngenerally render worthless the painstaking action of the House. The\r\nSenate has been established by precedent in the very freest possible\r\nprivileges of amendment as regards these bills no less than as regards\r\nall others. The Constitution is silent as to the origination of bills\r\nappropriating money. It says simply that \"all bills for _raising\r\nrevenue_ shall originate in the House of Representatives,\" and that in\r\nconsidering these \"the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as\r\non other bills\" (Art. I., Sec. VII.); but, \"by a practice as old as the\r\nGovernment itself, the constitutional prerogative of the House has been\r\nheld to apply to all the general appropriation bills,\"[28] and the\r\nSenate's right to amend these has been allowed the widest conceivable\r\nscope. The upper house may add to them what it pleases; may go\r\naltogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them\r\nentirely new features of legislation, altering not only the amounts but\r\neven the objects of expenditure, and making out of the materials sent\r\nthem by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character.\r\nAs passed by the House of Representatives, appropriation bills generally\r\nprovide for an expenditure considerably less than that called for by the\r\nestimates; as returned from the Senate, they usually propose grants of\r\nmany additional millions, having been brought by that less sensitive\r\nbody up almost, if not quite, to the figures of the estimates.\r\n\r\nAfter passing their ordeal of scrutiny and amendment in the Senate, the\r\nappropriation bills return with their new figures to the House. But when\r\nthey return it is too late for the House to put them again into the\r\ncrucible of Committee of the Whole. The session, it may be taken for\r\ngranted, was well on towards its middle age before they were originally\r\nintroduced by the House Committee on Appropriations; after they reached\r\nthe Senate they were referred to its corresponding Committee; and the\r\nreport of that Committee upon them was debated at the leisurely length\r\ncharacteristic of the weightier proceedings of the upper chamber; so\r\nthat the last days of the session are fast approaching when they are\r\nsent down to the House with the work of the Senate's hand upon them. The\r\nHouse is naturally disinclined to consent to the radical alterations\r\nwrought by the Senate, but there is no time to quarrel with its\r\ncolleague, unless it can make up its mind to sit through the heat of\r\nmidsummer, or to throw out the bill and accept the discomforts of an\r\nextra session. If the session be the short one, which ends, by\r\nconstitutional requirement, on the 4th of March, the alternative is the\r\nstill more distasteful one of leaving the appropriations to be made by\r\nthe next House.\r\n\r\nThe usual practice, therefore, is to adjust such differences by means of\r\na conference between the two Houses. The House rejects the Senate's\r\namendments without hearing them read; the Senate stoutly refuses to\r\nyield; a conference ensues, conducted by a committee of three members\r\nfrom each chamber; and a compromise is effected, by such a compounding\r\nof disagreeing propositions as gives neither party to the quarrel the\r\nvictory, and commonly leaves the grants not a little below the amounts\r\nasked for by the departments. As a rule, the Conference Committee\r\nconsists, on the part of the House, of the chairman of its Committee on\r\nAppropriations, some other well-posted member of that Committee, and a\r\nrepresentative of the minority. Its reports are matters of highest\r\nprerogative. They may be brought in even while a member is speaking. It\r\nis much better to silence a speaker than to delay for a single moment,\r\nat this stage of the session, the pressing, imperious question of the\r\nsupplies for the support of the government. The report is, therefore,\r\nacted upon immediately and in a mass, and is generally adopted without\r\ndebate. So great is the haste that the report is passed upon before\r\nbeing printed, and without giving any one but the members of the\r\nConference Committee time to understand what it really contains. There\r\nis no chance of remark or amendment. It receives at once sanction or\r\nrejection as a whole; and the chances are, of course, in favor of its\r\nbeing accepted, because to reject it would but force a new conference\r\nand bring fresh delays.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that after all the careful and thorough-going\r\ndebate and amendment of Committee of the Whole in the House, and all the\r\ngrave deliberation of the Senate to which the general appropriations are\r\nsubjected, they finally pass in a very chaotic state, full of provisions\r\nwhich neither the House nor the Senate likes, and utterly vague and\r\nunintelligible to every one save the members of the Conference\r\nCommittee; so that it would seem almost as if the generous portions of\r\ntime conscientiously given to their consideration in their earlier\r\nstages had been simply time thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe result of the under-appropriation to which Congress seems to have\r\nbecome addicted by long habit in dealing with the estimates, is, of\r\ncourse, the addition of another bill to the number of the regular annual\r\ngrants. As regularly as the annual session opens there is a Deficiency\r\nBill to be considered. Doubtless deficiencies frequently arise because\r\nof miscalculations or extravagance on the part of the departments; but\r\nthe most serious deficiencies are those which result from the\r\nclose-fistedness of the House Committee on Appropriations, and the\r\ncompromise reductions which are wrung from the Senate by conference\r\ncommittees. Every December, consequently, along with the estimates for\r\nthe next fiscal year, or at a later period of the session in special\r\ncommunications, come estimates of deficiencies in the appropriations for\r\nthe current year, and the apparent economies of the grants of the\r\npreceding session have to be offset in the gifts of the inevitable\r\nDeficiency Bill. It is as if Congress had designedly established the\r\nplan of making semi-annual appropriations. At each session it grants\r\npart of the money to be spent after the first of July following, and\r\nsuch sums as are needed to supplement the expenditures previously\r\nauthorized to be made after the first of July preceding. It doles out\r\ntheir allowances in installments to its wards, the departments.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for the Appropriations Committees of both Houses, when\r\npreparing the annual bills, to take the testimony of the directing\r\nofficers of the departments as to the actual needs of the public service\r\nin regard to all the principal items of expenditure. Having no place\r\nupon the floor of the House, and being, in consequence, shut out from\r\nmaking complete public statements concerning the estimates, the heads of\r\nthe several executive departments are forced to confine themselves to\r\nprivate communications with the House and Senate Committees. Appearing\r\nbefore those Committees in person, or addressing them more formally in\r\nwriting, they explain and urge the appropriations asked in the \"Letter\"\r\ncontaining the estimates. Their written communications, though addressed\r\nonly to the chairman of one of the Committees, frequently reach Congress\r\nitself, being read in open session by some member of the Committee in\r\norder to justify or interpret the items of appropriation proposed in a\r\npending bill. Not infrequently the head of a department exerts himself\r\nto secure desired supplies by dint of negotiation with individual\r\nmembers of the Committee, and by repeated and insistent private appeals\r\nto their chairman.\r\n\r\nOnly a very small part of the relations between the Committees and the\r\ndepartments is a matter of rule. Each time that the estimates come under\r\nconsideration the Committees must specially seek, or the departments\r\nnewly volunteer, information and advice. It would seem, however, that it\r\nis now less usual for the Committees to ask than for the Secretaries to\r\noffer counsel and suggestion. In the early years of the government it\r\nwas apparently not uncommon for the chairman of spending committees to\r\nseek out departmental officials in order to get necessary enlightenment\r\nconcerning the mysteries of the estimates, though it was often easier to\r\nask for than to get the information wanted. An amusing example of the\r\ndifficulties which then beset a committee-man in search of such\r\nknowledge is to be found in the private correspondence of John Randolph\r\nof Roanoke. Until 1865 the House Committee of Ways and Means, which is\r\none of the oldest of the Standing Committees, had charge of the\r\nappropriations; it was, therefore, Mr. Randolph's duty, as chairman of\r\nthat Committee in 1807, to look into the estimates, and he thus\r\nrecounts, in an interesting and exceedingly characteristic letter to\r\nhis intimate friend and correspondent, Nicholson, this pitiful\r\nexperience which he had had in performing that duty: \"I called some time\r\nsince at the navy office to ask an explanation of certain items of the\r\nestimate for this year. The Secretary called upon his chief clerk, who\r\nknew very little more of the business than his master. I propounded a\r\nquestion to the head of the department; he turned to the clerk like a\r\nboy who cannot say his lesson, and with imploring countenance beseeches\r\naid; the clerk with much assurance gabbled out some commonplace jargon,\r\nwhich I could not take for sterling; an explanation was required, and\r\nboth were dumb. This pantomime was repeated at every item, until,\r\ndisgusted and ashamed for the degraded situation of the principal, I\r\ntook leave without pursuing the subject, seeing that my object could not\r\nbe attained. There was not one single question relating to the\r\ndepartment that the Secretary could answer.\"[29] It is to be hoped that\r\nthe Secretaries of to-day are somewhat better versed in the affairs of\r\ntheir departments than was respectable Robert Smith, or, at any rate,\r\nthat they have chief clerks who can furnish inquiring chairmen with\r\nsomething better than commonplace jargon which no shrewd man can take\r\nfor sterling information; and it is altogether probable that such a\r\nscene as the one just described would nowadays be quite impossible. The\r\nbook-keeping of later years has been very much stricter and more\r\nthorough than it was in the infancy of the departments; the estimates\r\nare much more thoroughly differentiated and itemized; and a minute\r\ndivision of labor in each department amongst a numerous clerical force\r\nmakes it comparatively easy for the chief executive officers to acquaint\r\nthemselves quickly and accurately with the details of administration.\r\nThey do not wait, therefore, as a general thing, to be sought out and\r\nquestioned by the Committees, but bestir themselves to get at the ears\r\nof the committee-men, and especially to secure, if possible, the\r\ninfluence of the chairmen in the interest of adequate appropriations.\r\n\r\nThese irregular and generally informal communications between the\r\nAppropriations Committees and the heads of the departments, taking the\r\nform sometimes of pleas privately addressed by the Secretaries to\r\nindividual members of the Committees, and again of careful letters which\r\nfind their way into the reports laid before Congress, stand in our\r\nsystem in the place of the annual financial statements which are in\r\nBritish practice made by the ministers to parliament, under\r\ncircumstances which constitute very full and satisfactory public\r\nexplanations and the freest replies to all pertinent questions\r\ninvariable features of the supervision of the finances by the Commons.\r\nOur ministers make their statements to both Houses indirectly and\r\npiecemeal, through the medium of the Committees. They are mere\r\nwitnesses, and are in no definite way responsible for the annual\r\nappropriations. Their secure four-year tenure of office is not at all\r\naffected by the treatment the estimates receive at the hands of\r\nCongress. To see our cabinet officers resign because appropriations had\r\nbeen refused for the full amount asked for in the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury's \"Letter\" would be as novel in our eyes as would be, in the\r\nview of our English cousins, the sight of a Ministry of the Crown\r\nremaining in office under similar circumstances. Indeed, were our\r\ncabinets to stake their positions upon the fortunes of the estimates\r\nsubmitted to Congress, we should probably suffer the tiresome\r\ninconvenience of yearly resignations; for even when the heads of the\r\ndepartments tax all their energies and bring into requisition all their\r\narts of persuasion to secure ample grants from the Committees, the House\r\nCommittee cuts down the sums as usual, the Senate Committee adds to them\r\nas before, and the Conference Committee strikes a deficient compromise\r\nbalance according to time-honored custom.\r\n\r\nThere is in the House another appropriations committee besides the\r\nCommittee on Appropriations. This is the Committee on Rivers and\r\nHarbors, created in December, 1883, by the Forty-eighth Congress, as a\r\nsharer in the too great prerogatives till then enjoyed by the Committee\r\non Commerce. The Committee on Rivers and Harbors represents, of course,\r\nthe lately-acquired permanency of the policy of internal improvements.\r\nUntil 1870 that policy had had a very precarious existence. Strenuously\r\ndenied all tolerance by the severely constitutional Presidents of the\r\nearlier days, it could not venture to declare itself openly in separate\r\nappropriations which offered an easy prey to the watchful veto, but\r\nskulked in the unobtrusive guise of items of the general grants, safe\r\nunder the cover of respectable neighbor items. The veto has never been\r\nallowed to seek out single features in the acts submitted to the\r\nexecutive eye, and even such men as Madison and Monroe, stiff and\r\nperemptory as they were in the assertion of their conscientious\r\nopinions, and in the performance of what they conceived to be their\r\nconstitutional duty, and much as they disapproved of stretching the\r\nConstitution to such uses as national aid to local and inland\r\nimprovements, were fain to let an occasional gift of money for such\r\npurposes pass unforbidden rather than throw out the general\r\nappropriation bill to which it was tacked. Still, Congress did not make\r\nvery frequent or very flagrant use of this trick, and schemes of\r\ninternal improvement came altogether to a stand-still when faced by\r\nPresident Jackson's imperious disfavor. It was for many years the\r\nsettled practice of Congress to grant the States upon the sea-board\r\nleave to lay duties at their ports for the improvement of the harbors,\r\nand itself to undertake the expense of no public works save those upon\r\nterritory actually owned by the United States. But in later years the\r\nrelaxation of presidential opposition and the admission of new States\r\nlying altogether away from the sea, and, therefore, quite unwilling to\r\npay the tariffs which were building up the harbors of their eastern\r\nneighbors without any recompensing advantage to themselves who had no\r\nharbors, revived the plans which the vetoes of former times had\r\nrebuffed, and appropriations from the national coffers began freely to\r\nbe made for the opening of the great water highways and the perfecting\r\nof the sea-gates of commerce. The inland States were silenced, because\r\nsatisfied by a share in the benefits of national aid, which, being no\r\nlonger indirect, was not confined to the sanctioning of state tariffs\r\nwhich none but the sea-board commonwealths could benefit by, but which\r\nconsumers everywhere had to pay.\r\n\r\nThe greatest increase in appropriations of this class took place just\r\nafter 1870. Since that date they have occupied a very prominent place in\r\nlegislation, running from some twelve millions in the session of 1873-4\r\nup and down through various figures to eighteen millions seven hundred\r\nthousand in the session of 1882-3, constituting during that decade the\r\nchief business of the Committee on Commerce, and finally having a\r\nspecial Standing Committee erected for their superintendence. They have\r\nthus culminated with the culmination of the protective tariff, and the\r\nso-called \"American system\" of protective tariffs and internal\r\nimprovements has thus at last attained to its perfect work. The same\r\nprerogatives are accorded this new appropriations committee which have\r\nbeen secured to the greater Committee which deals with the estimates.\r\nIts reports may be made at any time when a member is not speaking, and\r\nstand in all respects upon the same footing as the bills proposing the\r\nannual grants. It is a special spending committee, with its own key to\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nBut the Appropriation Committees of the two Houses, though, strictly\r\nspeaking, the only committees of supply, have their work increased and\r\nsupplemented by the numerous Committees which devote time and energy to\r\ncreating demands upon the Treasury. There is a pension list in the\r\nestimates for whose payment the Committee on Appropriations has to\r\nprovide every year; but the Committee on Pensions is constantly\r\nmanufacturing new claims upon the public revenues.[30] There must be\r\nmoney forthcoming to build the new ships called for by the report of the\r\nCommittee on Naval Affairs, and to meet the charges for the army\r\nequipment and reforms recommended by the Committee on Military Affairs.\r\nThere are innumerable fingers in the budget pie.\r\n\r\nIt is principally in connection with appropriations that what has come\r\nto be known in our political slang as \"log-rolling\" takes place. Of\r\ncourse the chief scene of this sport is the private room of the\r\nCommittee on Rivers and Harbors, and the season of its highest\r\nexcitement, the hours spent in the passage of the River and Harbor\r\nBill. \"Log-rolling\" is an exchange of favors. Representative A. is very\r\nanxious to secure a grant for the clearing of a small water-course in\r\nhis district, and representative B. is equally solicitous about his\r\nplans for bringing money into the hands of the contractors of his own\r\nconstituency, whilst representative C. comes from a sea-port town whose\r\nmodest harbor is neglected because of the treacherous bar across its\r\nmouth, and representative D. has been blamed for not bestirring himself\r\nmore in the interest of schemes of improvement afoot amongst the\r\nenterprising citizens of his native place; so it is perfectly feasible\r\nfor these gentlemen to put their heads together and confirm a mutual\r\nunderstanding; that each will vote in Committee of the Whole for the\r\ngrants desired by the others, in consideration of the promise that they\r\nwill cry \"aye\" when his item comes on to be considered. It is not out of\r\nthe question to gain the favoring ear of the reporting Committee, and a\r\ngreat deal of tinkering can be done with the bill after it has come into\r\nthe hands of the House. Lobbying and log-rolling go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nSo much for estimates and appropriations. All questions of revenue are\r\nin their first stages in the hands of the House Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, and in their last, in charge of the Senate Committee on Finance.\r\nThe name of the House Committee is evidently borrowed from the language\r\nof the British Parliament; the English Committee of Ways and Means is,\r\nhowever, the Commons itself sitting in Committee of the Whole to\r\nconsider the statement and proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nwhilst ours is a Standing Committee of the House composed of eleven\r\nmembers, and charged with the preparation of all legislation relating to\r\nthe raising of the revenue and to providing ways and means for the\r\nsupport of the government. We have, in English parliamentary phrase, put\r\nour Chancellorship of the Exchequer into commission. The chairman of the\r\nCommittee figures as our minister of finance, but he really, of course,\r\nonly represents the commission of eleven over which he presides.\r\n\r\nAll reports of the Treasury department are referred to this Committee of\r\nWays and Means, which also, like the Committee on Appropriations, from\r\ntime to time holds other more direct communications with the officers of\r\nrevenue bureaux. The annual reports of the Secretary of the Treasury are\r\ngenerally quite full of minute information upon the points most\r\nimmediately connected with the proper duties of the Committee. They are\r\nexplicit with regard to the collection and disbursement of the revenues,\r\nwith regard to the condition of the public debt, and with regard to the\r\noperation of all laws governing the financial policy of the departments.\r\nThey are, in one aspect, the great yearly balance sheets, exhibiting the\r\nreceipts and expenditures of the government, its liabilities and its\r\ncredits; and, in another aspect, general views of the state of industry\r\nand of the financial machinery of the country, summarizing the\r\ninformation compiled by the bureau of statistics with reference to the\r\ncondition of the manufactures and of domestic trade, as well as with\r\nregard to the plight of the currency and of the national banks. They\r\nare, of course, quite distinct from the \"Letters\" of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, which contain the estimates, and go, not to the Committee\r\nof Ways and Means, but to the Committee on Appropriations.\r\n\r\nThough the duties of the Committee of Ways and Means in supervising the\r\nmanagement of the revenues of the country are quite closely analogous to\r\nthose of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, the lines of policy in\r\nwhich they walk are very widely separated from those which he feels\r\nbound to follow. As I have said, the object which he holds constantly in\r\nview is to keep the annual balances as nearly as possible at an\r\nequilibrium. He plans to raise only just enough revenue to satisfy the\r\ngrants made in Committee of Supply, and leave a modest surplus to cover\r\npossible errors in the estimates and probable fluctuations in the\r\nreturns from taxation. Our Committee of Ways and Means, on the other\r\nhand, follow a very different policy. The revenues which they control\r\nare raised for a double object. They represent not only the income of\r\nthe government, but also a carefully erected commercial policy to which\r\nthe income of the government has for many years been incidental. They\r\nare intended to foster the manufactures of the country as well as to\r\ndefray the expenses of federal administration. Were the maintenance of\r\nthe government and the support of the public credit the chief objects of\r\nour national policy of taxation, it would undoubtedly be cast in a very\r\ndifferent pattern. During a greater part of the lifetime of the present\r\ngovernment, the principal feature of that policy has been a complex\r\nsystem of duties on imports, troublesome and expensive of collection,\r\nbut nevertheless yielding, together with the license taxes of the\r\ninternal revenue which later years have seen added to it, immense\r\nsurpluses which no extravagances of the spending committees could\r\nexhaust. Duties few, small, and comparatively inexpensive of collection\r\nwould afford abundant revenues for the efficient conduct of the\r\ngovernment, besides comporting much more evidently with economy in\r\nfinancial administration. Of course, if vast revenues pour in over the\r\nbarriers of an exacting and exorbitant tariff, amply sufficient revenues\r\nwould flow in through the easy conduits of moderate and simple duties.\r\nThe object of our financial policy, however, has not been to equalize\r\nreceipts and expenditures, but to foster the industries of the country.\r\nThe Committee of Ways and Means, therefore, do not concern themselves\r\ndirectly with regulating the income of the government--they know that\r\nthat, in every probable event, will be more than sufficient--but with\r\nprotecting the interests of the manufacturers as affected by the\r\nregulation of the tariff. The resources of the government are made\r\nincidental to the industrial investments of private citizens.\r\n\r\nThis evidently constitutes a very capital difference between the\r\nfunctions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and those of our Committee\r\nof Ways and Means. In the policy of the former the support of the\r\ngovernment is everything; with the latter the care of the industries of\r\nthe country is the beginning and the end of duty. In the eyes of\r\nparliament enormous balances represent ignorant or improper management\r\non the part of the ministers, and a succession of them is sure to cast a\r\ncabinet from office, to the lasting disgrace of the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer; but to the mind of Congress vast surpluses are indicative of\r\nnothing in particular. They indicate of course abundant returns from the\r\nduties, but the chief concern is, not whether the duties are fruitful,\r\nbut whether they render the trades prosperous. Commercial interests are\r\nthe essential consideration; excess of income is a matter of comparative\r\nindifference. The points of view characteristic of the two systems are\r\nthus quite opposite: the Committee of Ways and Means subordinates its\r\nhousekeeping duties to its much wider extra-governmental business; the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer subordinates everything to economical\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThis is evidently the meaning of the easy sovereignty, in the practice\r\nof the House, of questions of supply over questions of revenue. It is\r\nimperative to grant money for the support of the government, but\r\nquestions of revenue revision may be postponed without inconvenience.\r\nThe two things do not necessarily go hand in hand, as they do in the\r\nCommons. The reports of the Committee of Ways and Means are matters of\r\nquite as high privilege as the reports of the Committee on\r\nAppropriations, but they by no means stand an equal chance of gaining\r\nthe consideration of the House and reaching a passage. They have no\r\ninseparable connection with the annual grants; the needed supplies will\r\nbe forthcoming without any readjustments of taxation to meet the\r\nanticipated demands, because the taxes are not laid in the first\r\ninstance with reference to the expenses which are to be paid out of\r\ntheir proceeds. If it were the function of the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, as it is of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to adjust the\r\nrevenue to the expenditures, their reports would be as essential a part\r\nof the business of each session as are the reports of the Committee on\r\nAppropriations; but their proposals, occupying, as they do, a very\r\ndifferent place in legislation, may go to the wall just as the proposals\r\nof the other Committees do at the demand of the chairman of the great\r\nspending Committee. The figures of the annual grants do not run near\r\nenough to the sum of the annual receipts to make them at all dependent\r\non bills which concern the latter.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the supervision exercised by Congress over\r\nexpenditures is more thorough than that which is exercised by the\r\nCommons in England. In 1814 the House created a Standing Committee on\r\nPublic Expenditures whose duty it should be \"to examine into the state\r\nof the several public departments, and particularly into laws making\r\nappropriations of money, and to report whether the moneys have been\r\ndisbursed conformably with such laws; and also to report from time to\r\ntime such provisions and arrangements as may be necessary to add to the\r\neconomy of the departments and the accountability of their officers;\"\r\nbut this Committee stood as the only committee of audit for but two\r\nyears. It was not then abolished, but its jurisdiction was divided\r\namongst six other Committees on Expenditures in the several departments,\r\nto which was added in 1860 a seventh, and in 1874 an eighth. There is\r\nthus a separate Committee for the audit of the accounts of each of the\r\nexecutive departments, beside which the original single Committee on\r\nPublic Expenditures stands charged with such duties as may have been\r\nleft it in the general distribution.[31] The duties of these eight\r\nCommittees are specified with great minuteness in the rules. They are\r\n\"to examine into the state of the accounts and expenditures respectively\r\nsubmitted to them, and to inquire and report particularly,\" whether the\r\nexpenditures of the respective departments are warranted by law;\r\n\"whether the claims from time to time satisfied and discharged by the\r\nrespective departments are supported by sufficient vouchers,\r\nestablishing their justness both as to their character and amount;\r\nwhether such claims have been discharged out of funds appropriated\r\ntherefor, and whether all moneys have been disbursed in conformity with\r\nappropriation laws; and whether any, or what, provisions are necessary\r\nto be adopted, to provide more perfectly for the proper application of\r\nthe public moneys, and to secure the government from demands unjust in\r\ntheir character or extravagant in their amount.\" Besides exercising\r\nthese functions of careful audit, they are, moreover, required to\r\n\"report from time to time\" any plans for retrenchment that may appear\r\nadvisable in the interests of economy, or any measures that may be\r\nnecessary to secure greater efficiency or to insure stricter\r\naccountability to Congress in the management of the departments; to\r\nferret out all abuses that may make their appearance; and to see to it\r\nthat no department has useless offices in its bureaux, or over or\r\nunder-paid officers on its rolls.\r\n\r\nBut, though these Committees are so many and so completely armed with\r\npowers, indications are not wanting that more abuses run at large in\r\nthe departments than they, with all their eyes, are able to detect. The\r\nSenate, though it has no similar permanent committees, has sometimes\r\ndiscovered dishonest dealings that had altogether escaped the vigilance\r\nof the eight House Committees; and even these eight occasionally, by a\r\nspecial effort, bring to light transactions which would never have been\r\nunearthed in the ordinary routine course of their usual procedure. It\r\nwas a select committee of the Senate which, during the sessions of the\r\nForty-seventh Congress, discovered that the \"contingent fund\" of the\r\nTreasury department had been spent in repairs on the Secretary's private\r\nresidence, for expensive suppers spread before the Secretary's political\r\nfriends, for lemonade for the delectation of the Secretary's private\r\npalate, for bouquets for the gratification of the Secretary's busiest\r\nallies, for carpets never delivered, \"ice\" never used, and services\r\nnever rendered;[32] although these were secrets of which the honest\r\nfaces of the vouchers submitted with the accounts gave not a hint.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to see how there could have been anything satisfactory or\r\nconclusive in the annual supervision of the public accounts during any\r\nbut the latest years of this system of committee audit. Before 1870 our\r\nnational book-keeping was much like that still in vogue in France.\r\nCredits once granted ran on without period until they were exhausted.\r\nThere were always unexpended balances to confuse the accounts; and when\r\nthe figures of the original grants had been on a too generous scale, as\r\nwas often the case, these balances accumulated from year to year in\r\nimmense surpluses, sometimes of many millions, of whose use no account\r\nwas given, and which consequently afforded means for all sorts of\r\nextravagance and peculation. In 1870 this abuse was partially corrected\r\nby a law which limited such accumulations to a period of two years, and\r\nlaid hands, on behalf of the Treasury, on the $174,000,000 of unexpended\r\nbalances which had by that time been amassed in the several departments;\r\nbut it was not till 1874 that such a rule of expenditure and accounting\r\nwas established as would make intelligent audit by the Committees\r\npossible, by a proper circumscription of the time during which credits\r\ncould be drawn upon without a regrant.[33]\r\n\r\nSuch is a general view, in brief and without technical detail, of the\r\nchief features of our financial system, of the dealings of Congress with\r\nthe questions of revenue, expenditure, and supply. The contrast which\r\nthis system offers to the old-world systems, of which the British is the\r\nmost advanced type, is obviously a very striking one. The one is the\r\nvery opposite of the others. On the one hand is a financial policy\r\nregulated by a compact, cooperative ministry under the direction of a\r\nrepresentative chamber, and on the other hand a financial policy\r\ndirected by the representative body itself, with only clerical aid from\r\nthe executive. In our practice, in other words, the Committees are the\r\nministers, and the titular ministers only confidential clerks. There is\r\nno concurrence, not even a nominal alliance, between the several\r\nsections of this committee-ministry, though their several duties are\r\nclearly very nearly akin and as clearly mutually dependent. This feature\r\nof disintegration in leadership runs, as I have already pointed out,\r\nthrough all our legislation; but it is manifestly of much more serious\r\nconsequence in financial administration than in the direction of other\r\nconcerns of government. There can be no doubt that, if it were not for\r\nthe fact that our revenues are not regulated with any immediate\r\nreference to the expenditures of the government, this method of spending\r\naccording to the suggestions of one body, and taxing in obedience to\r\nthe suggestions of another entirely distinct, would very quickly bring\r\nus into distress; it would unquestionably break down under any attempt\r\nto treat revenue and expenditure as mutually adjustable parts of a\r\nsingle, uniform, self-consistent system. They can be so treated only\r\nwhen they are under the management of a single body; only when all\r\nfinancial arrangements are based upon schemes prepared by a few men of\r\ntrained minds and accordant principles, who can act with easy agreement\r\nand with perfect confidence in each other. When taxation is regarded\r\nonly as a source of revenue and the chief object of financial management\r\nis the graduation of outlays by income, the credit and debit sides of\r\nthe account must come under a single eye to be properly balanced; or, at\r\nthe least, those officers who raise the money must see and be guided by\r\nthe books of those who spend it.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, therefore, be reasonably regarded as matter of surprise that\r\nour financial policy has been without consistency or coherency, without\r\nprogressive continuity. The only evidences of design to be discovered in\r\nit appear in those few elementary features which were impressed upon it\r\nin the first days of the government, when Congress depended upon such\r\nmen as Hamilton and Gallatin for guidance in putting the finances into\r\nshape. As far as it has any invariable characteristics, or any traceable\r\nheredity, it is the handiwork of the sagacious men who first presided\r\nover the Treasury department. Since it has been altogether in the hands\r\nof congressional Committees it has so waywardly shifted from one role to\r\nanother, and has with such erratic facility changed its principles of\r\naction and its modes of speech, to suit the temper and tastes of the\r\ntimes, that one who studies it hardly becomes acquainted with it in one\r\ndecade before he finds that that was a season quite apart from and\r\nunlike both those which went before and those which succeeded. At almost\r\nevery session Congress has made some effort, more or less determined,\r\ntowards changing the revenue system in some essential portion; and that\r\nsystem has never escaped radical alteration for ten years together. Had\r\nrevenue been graduated by the comparatively steady standard of the\r\nexpenditures, it must have been kept stable and calculable; but\r\ndepending, as it has done, on a much-debated and constantly fluctuating\r\nindustrial policy, it has been regulated in accordance with a scheme\r\nwhich has passed through as many phases as there have been vicissitudes\r\nand vagaries in the fortunes of commerce and the tactics of parties.\r\n\r\nThis is the more remarkable because upon all fiscal questions Congress\r\nacts with considerable deliberation and care. Financial legislation\r\nusually, if not always, occupies by far the most prominent place in the\r\nbusiness of each session. Though other questions are often disposed of\r\nat odd moments, in haste and without thought, questions of revenue and\r\nsupply are always given full measure of debate. The House of\r\nRepresentatives, under authority of the Rule before referred to, which\r\nenables it, as it were, to project the previous question into Committee\r\nof the Whole, by providing for the discharge of that Committee from the\r\nfurther consideration of any bill that is in its hands, or that may be\r\nabout to be referred to it, after all amendments \"pending and that may\r\nbe offered\" shall have been acted upon without debate, seldom hesitates,\r\nwhen any ordinary business is to be considered, to forbid to the\r\nproceedings of Committee of the Whole all freedom of discussion, and,\r\nconsequently, almost all discretion as to the action to be taken; but\r\nthis muzzle is seldom put upon the mouth of the Committee when\r\nappropriation or tariff bills are to be considered, unless the\r\ndiscussion in Committee wanders off into fields, quite apart from the\r\nproper matter of the measure in hand, in which case the House interposes\r\nto check the irrelevant talk. Appropriation bills have, however, as I\r\nhave shown, a much higher privilege than have bills affecting the\r\ntariff, and instances are not wanting in which the chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Appropriations has managed to engross the time of the House\r\nin the disposal of measures prepared by his Committee, to the entire\r\nexclusion of any action whatever on important bills reported by the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means after the most careful and laborious\r\ndeliberation. His prerogatives are never disputed in such a contest for\r\nconsideration between a supply and a revenue bill, because these two\r\nsubjects do not, under our system, necessarily go hand in hand. Ways and\r\nMeans bills may and should be acted upon, but Supply bills must be.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked in this connection, moreover, that much as\r\nCongress talks about fiscal questions, whenever permitted to do so by\r\nthe selfish Appropriations Committee, its talk is very little heeded by\r\nthe big world outside its halls. The noteworthy fact, to which I have\r\nalready called attention, that even the most thorough debates in\r\nCongress fail to awaken any genuine or active interest in the minds of\r\nthe people, has had its most striking illustrations in the course of our\r\nfinancial legislation; for, though the discussions which have taken\r\nplace in Congress upon financial questions have been so frequent, so\r\nprotracted, and so thorough, engrossing so large a part of the time of\r\nthe House on their every recurrence, they seem, in almost every\r\ninstance, to have made scarcely any impression at all upon the public\r\nmind. The Coinage Act of 1873, by which silver was demonetized, had been\r\nbefore the country many years, ere it reached adoption, having been time\r\nand again considered by Committees of Congress, time and again printed\r\nand discussed in one shape or another, and having finally gained\r\nacceptance apparently by sheer persistence and importunity. The\r\nResumption Act of 1875, too, had had a like career of repeated\r\nconsiderations by Committees, repeated printings, and a full discussion\r\nby Congress; and yet when the \"Bland Silver Bill\" of 1878 was on its way\r\nthrough the mills of legislation, some of the most prominent newspapers\r\nof the country declared with confidence that the Resumption Act had been\r\npassed inconsiderately and in haste, almost secretly indeed; and several\r\nmembers of Congress had previously complained that the demonetization\r\nscheme of 1873 had been pushed surreptitiously through the courses of\r\nits passage, Congress having been tricked into accepting it, doing it\r\nscarcely knew what.\r\n\r\nThis indifference of the country to what is said in Congress, pointing,\r\nas it obviously does, to the fact that, though the Committees lead in\r\nlegislation, they lead without concert or responsibility, and lead\r\nnobody in particular, that is, no compact and organized party force\r\nwhich can be made accountable for its policy, has also a further\r\nsignificance with regard to the opportunities and capacities of the\r\nconstituencies. The doubt and confusion of thought which must\r\nnecessarily exist in the minds of the vast majority of voters as to the\r\nbest way of exerting their will in influencing the action of an assembly\r\nwhose organization is so complex, whose acts are apparently so\r\nhaphazard, and in which responsibility is spread so thin, throws\r\nconstituencies into the hands of local politicians who are more visible\r\nand tangible than are the leaders of Congress, and generates, the while,\r\na profound distrust of Congress as a body whose actions cannot be\r\nreckoned beforehand by any standard of promises made at elections or any\r\nprogrammes announced by conventions. Constituencies can watch and\r\nunderstand a few banded leaders who display plain purposes and act upon\r\nthem with promptness; but they cannot watch or understand forty odd\r\nStanding Committees, each of which goes its own way in doing what it can\r\nwithout any special regard to the pledges of either of the parties from\r\nwhich its membership is drawn. In short, we lack in our political life\r\nthe conditions most essential for the formation of an active and\r\neffective public opinion. \"The characteristics of a nation capable of\r\npublic opinion,\" says Mr. Bagehot, most sagacious of political critics,\r\n\"is that ... parties will be _organized_; in each there will be a\r\nleader, in each there will be some looked up to, and many who look up to\r\nthem; the opinion of the party will be formed and suggested by the few,\r\nit will be criticised and accepted by the many.\"[34] And this is just\r\nthe sort of party organization which we have not. Our parties have\r\ntitular leaders at the polls in the persons of candidates, and nominal\r\ncreeds in the resolutions of conventions, but no select few in whom to\r\ntrust for guidance in the general policy of legislation, or to whom to\r\nlook for suggestions of opinion. What man, what group of men, can speak\r\nfor the Republican party or for the Democratic party? When our most\r\nconspicuous and influential politicians say anything about future\r\nlegislation, no one supposes that they are speaking for their party, as\r\nthose who have authority; they are known to speak only for themselves\r\nand their small immediate following of colleagues and friends.\r\n\r\nThe present relations between Congress and public opinion remind us of\r\nthat time, in the reign of George III., when \"the bulk of the English\r\npeople found itself powerless to control the course of English\r\ngovernment,\" when the government was divorced from \"that general mass of\r\nnational sentiment on which a government can alone safely ground\r\nitself.\" Then it was that English public opinion, \"robbed as it was of\r\nall practical power, and thus stripped of the feeling of responsibility\r\nwhich the consciousness of power carries with it,\" \"became ignorant and\r\nindifferent to the general progress of the age, but at the same time ...\r\nhostile to Government because it was Government, disloyal to the Crown,\r\naverse from Parliament. For the first and last time ... Parliament was\r\nunpopular, and its opponents secure of popularity.\"[35] Congress has in\r\nour own day become divorced from the \"general mass of national\r\nsentiment,\" simply because there is no means by which the movements of\r\nthat national sentiment can readily be registered in legislation. Going\r\nabout as it does to please all sorts of Committees composed of all sorts\r\nof men,--the dull and the acute, the able and the cunning, the honest\r\nand the careless,--Congress evades judgment by avoiding all coherency of\r\nplan in its action. The constituencies can hardly tell whether the works\r\nof any particular Congress have been good or bad; at the opening of its\r\nsessions there was no determinate policy to look forward to, and at\r\ntheir close no accomplished plans to look back upon. During its brief\r\nlifetime both parties may have vacillated and gone astray, policies may\r\nhave shifted and wandered, and untold mischief, together with some good,\r\nmay have been done; but when all is reviewed, it is next to impossible\r\noftentimes to distribute justly the blame and the praise. A few stubborn\r\ncommittee-men may be at the bottom of much of the harm that has been\r\nwrought, but they do not represent their party, and it cannot be clear\r\nto the voter how his ballot is to change the habits of Congress for the\r\nbetter. He distrusts Congress because he feels that he cannot control\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe voter, moreover, feels that his want of confidence in Congress is\r\njustified by what he hears of the power of corrupt lobbyists to turn\r\nlegislation to their own uses. He hears of enormous subsidies begged and\r\nobtained; of pensions procured on commission by professional pension\r\nsolicitors; of appropriations made in the interest of dishonest\r\ncontractors; and he is not altogether unwarranted in the conclusion that\r\nthese are evils inherent in the very nature of Congress, for there can\r\nbe no doubt that the power of the lobbyist consists in great part, if\r\nnot altogether, in the facility afforded him by the Committee system. He\r\nmust, in the natural course of things, have many most favorable\r\nopportunities for approaching the great money-dispensing Committees. It\r\nwould be impracticable to work up his schemes in the broad field of the\r\nwhole House, but in the membership of a Committee he finds manageable\r\nnumbers. If he can gain the ear of the Committee, or of any influential\r\nportion of it, he has practically gained the ear of the House itself; if\r\nhis plans once get footing in a committee report, they may escape\r\ncriticism altogether, and it will, in any case, be very difficult to\r\ndislodge them. This accessibility of the Committees by outsiders gives\r\nto illegitimate influences easy approach at all points of legislation,\r\nbut no Committees are affected by it so often or so unfortunately as are\r\nthe Committees which control the public moneys. They are naturally the\r\nones whose favor is oftenest and most importunately, as well as most\r\ninsidiously, sought; and no description of our system of revenue,\r\nappropriation, and supply would be complete without mention of the\r\nmanufacturers who cultivate the favor of the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, of the interested persons who walk attendance upon the Committee\r\non Rivers and Harbors, and of the mail-contractors and subsidy-seekers\r\nwho court the Committee on Appropriations.\r\n\r\nMy last point of critical comment upon our system of financial\r\nadministration I shall borrow from a perspicacious critic of\r\ncongressional methods who recently wrote thus to one of the best of\r\nAmerican journals: \"So long as the debit side of the national account is\r\nmanaged by one set of men, and the credit side by another set, both sets\r\nworking separately and in secret, without any public responsibility, and\r\nwithout any intervention on the part of the executive official who is\r\nnominally responsible; so long as these sets, being composed largely of\r\nnew men every two years, give no attention to business except when\r\nCongress is in session, _and thus spend in preparing plans the whole\r\ntime which ought to be spent in public discussion of plans already\r\nmatured_, so that an immense budget is rushed through without discussion\r\nin a week or ten days,--just so long the finances will go from bad to\r\nworse, no matter by what name you call the party in power. No other\r\nnation on earth attempts such a thing, or could attempt it without soon\r\ncoming to grief, our salvation thus far consisting in an enormous\r\nincome, with practically no drain for military expenditure.\"[36]\r\nUnquestionably this strikes a very vital point of criticism. Congress\r\nspends its time working, in sections, at preparing plans, instead of\r\nconfining itself to what is for a numerous assembly manifestly the much\r\nmore useful and proper function of debating and revising plans prepared\r\nbeforehand for its consideration by a commission of skilled men, old in\r\npolitical practice and in legislative habit, whose official life is\r\napart from its own, though dependent upon its will. Here, in other\r\nwords, is another finger pointing to Mr. Mill's question as to the best\r\n\"legislative commission.\" Our Committees fall short of being the best\r\nform of commission, not only in being too numerous but also in being\r\nintegral parts of the body which they lead, having no life apart from\r\nit. Probably the best working commission would be one which should make\r\nplans for government independently of the representative body, and in\r\nimmediate contact with the practical affairs of administration, but\r\nwhich should in all cases look to that body for the sanctioning of those\r\nplans, and should be immediately responsible to it for their success\r\nwhen put into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE.\r\n\r\n     This is a Senate, a Senate of equals, of men of individual honor\r\n     and personal character, and of absolute independence. We know no\r\n     masters, we acknowledge no dictators. This is a hall for mutual\r\n     consultation and discussion, not an arena for the exhibition of\r\n     champions.--DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the United States has been both extravagantly praised and\r\nunreasonably disparaged, according to the predisposition and temper of\r\nits various critics. In the eyes of some it has a stateliness of\r\ncharacter, an eminency of prerogative, and, for the most part, a wisdom\r\nof practice such as no other deliberative body possesses; whilst in the\r\nestimation of others it is now, whatever it may have been formerly, but\r\na somewhat select company of leisurely \"bosses,\" in whose companionship\r\nthe few men of character and high purpose who gain admission to its\r\nmembership find little that is encouraging and nothing that is\r\ncongenial. Now of course neither of these extreme opinions so much as\r\nresembles the uncolored truth, nor can that truth be obtained by a\r\njudicious mixture of their milder ingredients. The truth is, in this\r\ncase as in so many others, something quite commonplace and practical.\r\nThe Senate is just what the mode of its election and the conditions of\r\npublic life in this country make it. Its members are chosen from the\r\nranks of active politicians, in accordance with a law of natural\r\nselection to which the state legislatures are commonly obedient; and it\r\nis probable that it contains, consequently, the best men that our system\r\ncalls into politics. If these best men are not good, it is because our\r\nsystem of government fails to attract better men by its prizes, not\r\nbecause the country affords or could afford no finer material.\r\n\r\nIt has been usual to suppose that the Senate was just what the\r\nConstitution intended it to be; that because its place in the federal\r\nsystem was exalted the aims and character of its members would naturally\r\nbe found to be exalted as well; that because its term was long its\r\nforesight would be long also; or that because its election was not\r\ndirectly of the people demagogy would find no life possible in its\r\nhalls. But the Senate is in fact, of course, nothing more than a part,\r\nthough a considerable part, of the public service, and if the general\r\nconditions of that service be such as to starve statesmen and foster\r\ndemagogues, the Senate itself will be full of the latter kind, simply\r\nbecause there are no others available. There cannot be a separate breed\r\nof public men reared specially for the Senate. It must be recruited from\r\nthe lower branches of the representative system, of which it is only the\r\ntopmost part. No stream can be purer than its sources. The Senate can\r\nhave in it no better men than the best men of the House of\r\nRepresentatives; and if the House of Representatives attract to itself\r\nonly inferior talent, the Senate must put up with the same sort. I think\r\nit safe to say, therefore, that, though it may not be as good as could\r\nbe wished, the Senate is as good as it can be under the circumstances.\r\nIt contains the most perfect product of our politics, whatever that\r\nproduct may be.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand and appreciate the Senate, therefore, one must\r\nknow the conditions of public life in this country. What are those\r\nconditions? Well, in the first place, they are not what they were in the\r\nearly years of the federal government; they are not what they were even\r\ntwenty years ago; for in this, as in other things, the war between the\r\nStates ends one distinct period and opens another. Between the great\r\nconstructive statesmen of the revolutionary days and the reconstructing\r\npoliticians of the sixties there came into public place and legislative\r\ninfluence a great race of constitutional lawyers. The questions which\r\nfaced our statesmen while the Constitution was a-making were in the\r\nbroadest sense questions of politics; but the questions which dominated\r\nour public life after the federal government had been successfully set\r\nup were questions of legal interpretation such as only lawyers could\r\ngrapple with. All matters of policy, all doubts of legislation, even all\r\ndifficulties of diplomacy, were measured by rules of constitutional\r\nconstruction. There was hardly a single affair of public concern which\r\nwas not hung upon some peg of constitutional dogma in the testing-rooms\r\nof one or another of the contending schools of constitutional\r\ninterpretation. Constitutional issues were ever the tides, questions of\r\nadministrative policy seldom more than the eddies, of politics.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans under Jefferson drew their nourishment from\r\nconstitutional belief no less than did the Federalists; the Whigs and\r\nDemocrats of a later day lived on what was essentially the same diet,\r\nthough it was served in slightly different forms; and the parties of\r\nto-day are themselves fain to go to these cooks of the olden time\r\nwhenever they desire strong meat to fortify them against their present\r\ndebility. The great questions attending the admission of new States to\r\nthe Union and the annexation of foreign territory, as well as all the\r\ncontroversies which came in the train of the contest over slavery and\r\nthe reserved powers of the States, were of the Constitution\r\nconstitutional; and what other questions were then living--save those\r\nwhich found root in the great charter's implied powers, about which\r\nthere was such constant noise of debate? It will be remembered that very\r\nfew publicists opposed internal improvements, for instance, on the\r\nground that they were unwise or uncalled for. No one who took a\r\nstatesman-like view of the matter could fail to see that the opening up\r\nof the great water-ways of the country, the construction of roads, the\r\ncutting of canals, or any public work which might facilitate inter-State\r\ncommerce by making intercourse between the various portions of the Union\r\neasy and rapid, was sanctioned by every consideration of wisdom, as\r\nbeing in conformity with a policy at once national in its spirit and\r\nuniversal in its benefits. The doubt was, not as to what it would be\r\nbest and most provident to do, but as to what it would be lawful to do;\r\nand the chief opponents of schemes of internal improvement based their\r\ndissent upon a careful meditation of the language of the Constitution.\r\nWithout its plain approval they would not move, even if they had to\r\nstand still all their days.\r\n\r\nIt was, too, with many professions of this spirit that the tariff was\r\ndealt with. It ran suddenly to the front as a militant party question\r\nin 1833, not as if a great free-trade movement had been set afoot which\r\nwas to anticipate the mission of Cobden and Bright, but as an issue\r\nbetween federal taxation and the constitutional privileges of the\r\nStates. The agricultural States were being, as they thought, very\r\ncruelly trodden down under the iron heel of that protectionist policy to\r\nwhose enthronement they had themselves consented, and they fetched their\r\nhope of escape from the Constitution. The federal government\r\nunquestionably possessed, they admitted, and that by direct grant of the\r\nfundamental law, the right to impose duties on imports; but did that\r\nright carry with it the privilege of laying discriminating duties for\r\nother purposes than that of raising legitimate revenue? Could the\r\nConstitution have meant that South Carolina might be taxed to maintain\r\nthe manufactures of New England?\r\n\r\nClose upon the heels of the great tariff controversy of that time came\r\nthe stupendous contest over the right of secession and the abolition of\r\nslavery; and again in this contest, as in all that had gone before, the\r\nparty which was being hard driven sought refuge in the Constitution.\r\nThis too was, in its first stages at least, a lawyer's question. It\r\neventually slipped out of all lawyerly control, and was given over to be\r\nsettled by the stern and savage processes of war; but it stayed with\r\nthe constitutional lawyers as long as it could, and would have stayed\r\nwith them to the end had it not itself been bigger than the Constitution\r\nand mixed with such interests and such passions as were beyond the\r\ncontrol of legislatures or of law courts.\r\n\r\nSuch samples of the character which political questions have hitherto\r\nborne in this country are sufficient to remind all readers of our\r\nhistory of what have been the chief features of our politics, and may\r\nserve, without further elaboration, to illustrate the point I wish to\r\nemphasize. It is manifest how such a course of politics would affect\r\nstatesmanship and political leadership. While questions affecting the\r\nproper construction of the Constitution were the chief and most\r\nimperative questions pressing for settlement, great lawyers were in\r\ndemand; and great lawyers were, accordingly, forthcoming in satisfaction\r\nof the demand. In a land like ours, where litigation is facilitated by\r\nthe establishment of many open and impartial courts, great lawyers are a\r\nmuch more plentiful product than great administrators, unless there be\r\nalso some extraordinary means for the encouragement of administrative\r\ntalents. We have, accordingly, always had plenty of excellent lawyers,\r\nthough we have often had to do without even tolerable administrators,\r\nand seem destined to endure the inconvenience of hereafter doing\r\nwithout any constructive statesmen at all. The constitutional issues of\r\nformer times were so big and so urgent that they brought great advocates\r\ninto the field, despite all the tendencies there were in our system\r\ntowards depriving leadership of all place of authority. In the presence\r\nof questions affecting the very structure and powers of the federal\r\ngovernment, parties had to rally with definite purpose and espouse a\r\ndistinct creed; and when the maintenance or overthrow of slavery had\r\nceased to be a question of constitutional right, and had become a matter\r\nof contention between sentiment and vested rights,--between interest and\r\npassionate feeling,--there was of course a hot energy of contest between\r\ntwo compact hosts and a quick elevation of forceful leaders.\r\n\r\nThe three stages of national growth which preceded the war between the\r\nStates were each of them creative of a distinct class of political\r\nleaders. In the period of erection there were great architects and\r\nmaster-builders; in the period of constitutional interpretation there\r\nwere, at a distance from the people, great political schoolmen who\r\npondered and expounded the letter of the law, and, nearer the people,\r\ngreat constitutional advocates who cast the doctrines of the schoolmen\r\ninto policy; and in the period of abolitionist agitation there were\r\ngreat masters of feeling and leaders of public purpose. The publicists\r\nof the second period kept charge of the slavery question, as I have\r\nsaid, as long as they could, and gave place with bitter reluctance to\r\nthe anti-slavery orators and pro-slavery champions who were to talk the\r\nwar-feeling into a flame. But it was of course inevitable that the new\r\nmovement should have new leaders. It was essentially revolutionary in\r\nits tone and in its designs, and so quite out of the reach of those\r\nprinciples of action which had governed the policy of the older school\r\nof politicians. Its aim was to change, not to vindicate, the\r\nConstitution. Its leaders spoke, not words of counsel, but words of\r\npassion and of command. It was a crusade, not a campaign; the impetuous\r\nmovement of a cause, not the canvass of a mooted measure. And, like\r\nevery big, stirring cause, it had its leaders--leaders whose authority\r\nrested upon the affections and sympathies of the people rather than upon\r\nany attested wisdom or success of statesmanship. The war was the work,\r\nmediately, of philanthropists; and the reconstructions which followed\r\nthe war were the hasty strokes of these same unbalanced knights of the\r\ncrusade, full of bold feeling, but not of steady or far-sighted\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery movement called forth leaders who, from the very nature\r\nof their calling, were more picturesque than any who had figured on the\r\nnational stage since the notable play of the Revolution had gone off the\r\nboards; but it was no better cast in leading parts than had been the\r\ndrama which immediately preceded it. When the constitution of a\r\nself-governing people is being consciously moulded by the rapid\r\nformation of precedent during the earliest periods of its existence,\r\nthere are sure to be antagonistic beliefs, distinct and strong and\r\nactive enough to take shape in the creeds of energetic parties, each led\r\nby the greatest advocates of its cherished principles. The season of our\r\nconstitutional development, consequently, saw as fine a race of\r\nstatesmen at the front of national affairs as have ever directed the\r\ncivil policy of the country; and they, in turn, gave place to men brave\r\nto encounter the struggles of changed times, and fit to solve the doubts\r\nof a new set of events.\r\n\r\nSince the war, however, we have come into a fourth period of national\r\nlife, and are perplexed at finding ourselves denied a new order of\r\nstatesmanship to suit the altered conditions of government. The period\r\nof federal construction is long-passed; questions of constitutional\r\ninterpretation are no longer regarded as of pressing urgency, the war\r\nhas been fought, even the embers of its issues being now almost\r\nextinguished; and we are left to that unexciting but none the less\r\ncapitally important business of every-day peaceful development and\r\njudicious administration to whose execution every nation in its middle\r\nage has to address itself with what sagacity, energy, and prudence it\r\ncan command. It cannot be said that these new duties have as yet raised\r\nup any men eminently fit for their fulfillment. We have had no great\r\nadministrators since the opening of this newest stage, and there is as\r\nyet no visible sign that any such will soon arise. The forms of\r\ngovernment in this country have always been unfavorable to the easy\r\nelevation of talent to a station of paramount authority; and those forms\r\nin their present crystallization are more unfavorable than ever to the\r\ntoleration of the leadership of the few, whilst the questions now most\r\nprominent in politics are not of such a nature as to compel skilled and\r\ntrustworthy champions to come into the field, as did the constitutional\r\nissues and revolutionary agitations of other days. They are matters of a\r\ntoo quiet, business-like sort to enlist feeling or arouse enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, very unfortunate that only feeling or enthusiasm can\r\ncreate recognized leadership in our politics. There is no office set\r\napart for the great party leader in our government. The powers of the\r\nSpeakership of the House of Representatives are too cramped and covert;\r\nthe privileges of the chairmanships of the chief Standing Committees\r\nare too limited in scope; the presidency is too silent and inactive, too\r\nlittle like a premiership and too much like a superintendency. If there\r\nbe any one man to whom a whole party or a great national majority looks\r\nfor guiding counsel, he must lead without office, as Daniel Webster did,\r\nor in spite of his office, as Jefferson and Jackson did. There must be\r\nsomething in the times or in the questions which are abroad to thrust\r\ngreat advocates or great masters of purpose into a non-official\r\nleadership, which is theirs because they represent in the greatest\r\nactions of their lives some principle at once vital and widely loved or\r\nhated, or because they possess in their unrivaled power of eloquent\r\nspeech the ability to give voice to some such living theme. There must\r\nbe a cause to be advanced which is greater than the trammels of\r\ngovernmental forms, and which, by authority of its own imperative voice,\r\nconstitutes its advocates the leaders of the nation, though without\r\ngiving them official title--without need of official title. No one is\r\nauthorized to lead by reason of any official station known to our\r\nsystem. We call our real leaders by no names but their own: Mr. Webster\r\nwas always Mr. Webster and never Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nIn a country which governs itself by means of a public meeting, a\r\nCongress or a Parliament, a country whose political life is\r\nrepresentative, the only real leadership in governmental affairs must be\r\nlegislative leadership--ascendency in the public meeting which decides\r\neverything. The leaders, if there be any, must be those who suggest the\r\nopinions and rule the actions of the representative body. We have in\r\nthis country, therefore, no real leadership; because no man is allowed\r\nto direct the course of Congress, and there is no way of governing the\r\ncountry save through Congress, which is supreme. The chairman of a great\r\nCommittee like the Committee of Ways and Means stands, indeed, at the\r\nsources of a very large and important stream of policy, and can turn\r\nthat stream at his pleasure, or mix what he will with its waters; but\r\nthere are whole provinces of policy in which he can have no authority at\r\nall. He neither directs, nor can often influence, those other chairmen\r\nwho direct all the other important affairs of government. He, though the\r\ngreatest of chairmen, and as great, it may be, as any other one man in\r\nthe whole governmental system, is by no means at the head of the\r\ngovernment. He is, as he feels every day, only a big wheel where there\r\nare many other wheels, some almost as big as he, and all driven, like\r\nhimself, by fires which he does not kindle or tend.\r\n\r\nIn a word, we have no supreme executive ministry, like the great\r\n\"Ministry of the Crown\" over sea, in whose hands is the general\r\nmanagement of legislation; and we have, consequently, no great prizes of\r\nleadership such as are calculated to stimulate men of strong talents to\r\ngreat and conspicuous public services. The Committee system is, as I\r\nhave already pointed out, the very opposite of this. It makes all the\r\nprizes of leadership small, and nowhere gathers power into a few hands.\r\nIt cannot be denied that this is in ordinary times, and in the absence\r\nof stirring themes, a great drawback, inasmuch as it makes legislative\r\nservice unattractive to minds of the highest order, to whom the offer of\r\nreally great place and power at the head of the governing assembly, the\r\nsupreme council of the nation, would be of all things most attractive.\r\nIf the presidency were competitive,--if it could be won by distinguished\r\ncongressional service,--who can doubt that there would be a notable\r\ninflux of talents into Congress and a significant elevation of tone and\r\nbetterment of method in its proceedings; and yet the presidency is very\r\nfar from being equal to a first-rate premiership.\r\n\r\nThere is, I know, one distinctive feature of legislative leadership\r\nwhich makes it seem to some not altogether to be desired; though it\r\nscarcely constitutes such an objection as to make no leadership at all\r\nseem preferable. It is the leadership of orators; it is the ascendency\r\nof those who have a genius for talking. In the eyes of those who do not\r\nlike it, it seems a leadership of artful dialecticians, the success of\r\ntricks of phrase, the victory of rushing declamation--government, not by\r\nthe advice of statesman-like counselors, but by the wagging of ready\r\ntongues. Macaulay pointed out with his accustomed force of statement\r\njust the fact which haunts those who hold to such objections. The power\r\nof speaking, he said, which is so highly prized by politicians in a\r\npopular government, \"may exist in the highest degree without judgment,\r\nwithout fortitude, without skill in reading the characters of men or the\r\nsigns of the times, without any knowledge, of the principles of\r\nlegislation or of political economy, and without any skill in diplomacy\r\nor in the administration of war. Nay, it may well happen that those very\r\nintellectual qualities which give peculiar charm to the speeches of a\r\npublic man may be incompatible with the qualities which would fit him to\r\nmeet a pressing emergency with promptitude and firmness. It was thus\r\nwith Charles Townshend. It was thus with Windham. It was a privilege to\r\nlisten to those accomplished and ingenious orators. But in a perilous\r\ncrisis they would be found inferior in all the qualities of rulers to\r\nsuch a man as Oliver Cromwell, who talked nonsense, or as William the\r\nSilent, who did not talk at all.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is to be observed that neither Windham nor Townshend\r\nrose to places of highest confidence in the assembly which they served,\r\nand which they charmed by their attractive powers of speech; and that\r\nCromwell would have been as unfit to rule anything but an autocratic\r\ncommonwealth as would have been William the Silent to be anything but a\r\nDutch governor. The people really had no voice in Cromwell's government.\r\nIt was absolute. He would have been as much out of place in a\r\nrepresentative government as a bull in a china shop. We would not have a\r\nBismarck if we could.\r\n\r\nEvery species of government has the defects of its own qualities.\r\nRepresentative government is government by advocacy, by discussion, by\r\npersuasion, and a great, miscellaneous voting population is often misled\r\nby deceitful pleas and swayed by unwise counsels. But if one were to\r\nmake a somewhat freer choice of examples than Macaulay permitted\r\nhimself, it would be easy to multiply the instances of ruling orators of\r\nour race who have added to their gifts of eloquence conspicuous sagacity\r\nin the administration of affairs. At any rate, the men who have led\r\npopular assemblies have often been, like Hampden, rarely endowed with\r\njudgment, foresight, and steadfastness of purpose; like Walpole,\r\namazingly quick in \"reading the characters of men and the signs of the\r\ntimes;\" like Chatham, masterful in ordering the conquests and the\r\npolicies of the world; like Burke, learned in the profoundest principles\r\nof statecraft; like Canning, adroit in diplomacy; like Pitt, safe in\r\ntimes of revolution; like Peel, sagacious in finance; or, like\r\nGladstone, skilled in every branch of political knowledge and equal to\r\nany strain of emergency.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that orators should be the leaders of a self-governing\r\npeople. Men may be clever and engaging speakers, such as are to be\r\nfound, doubtless, at half the bars of the country, without being\r\nequipped even tolerably for any of the high duties of the statesman; but\r\nmen can scarcely be orators without that force of character, that\r\nreadiness of resource, that clearness of vision, that grasp of\r\nintellect, that courage of conviction, that earnestness of purpose, and\r\nthat instinct and capacity for leadership which are the eight horses\r\nthat draw the triumphal chariot of every leader and ruler of free men.\r\nWe could not object to being ruled again by such men as Henry and Otis\r\nand Samuel Adams; but they were products of revolution. They were\r\ninspired by the great causes of the time; and the government which they\r\nset up has left us without any ordinary, peaceful means of bringing men\r\nlike them into public life. We should like to have more like them, but\r\nthe violent exercise of revolution is too big a price to pay for them.\r\nSome less pungent diet is to be desired for the purpose of giving health\r\nto our legislative service. There ought to be some quiet, effective\r\ntonic, some mild stimulant, such as the certain prospect of winning\r\nhighest and most honorable office, to infuse the best talent of the\r\nnation into our public life.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the conditions of public life which make the House of\r\nRepresentatives what it is, a disintegrate mass of jarring elements, and\r\nthe Senate what it is, a small, select, and leisurely House of\r\nRepresentatives. Or perhaps it would be nearer the whole truth to say\r\nthat these are the circumstances and this the frame of government of\r\nwhich the two Houses form a part. Were the Senate not supplied\r\nprincipally by promotions from the House,--if it had, that is, a\r\nmembership made up of men specially trained for its peculiar duties,--it\r\nwould probably be much more effective than it is in fulfilling the great\r\nfunction of instructive and business-like debate of public questions;\r\nfor its duties are enough unlike those of the House to be called\r\npeculiar. Men who have acquired all their habits in the matter of\r\ndealing with legislative measures in the House of Representatives, where\r\ncommittee work is everything and public discussion nothing but \"talking\r\nto the country,\" find themselves still mere declaimers when they get\r\ninto the Senate, where no previous question utters its interrupting\r\nvoice from the tongues of tyrannical committee-men, and where,\r\nconsequently, talk is free to all.[37] Only superior talents, such as\r\nvery few men possess, could enable a Representative of long training to\r\nchange his spots upon entering the Senate. Most men will not fit more\r\nthan one sphere in life; and after they have been stretched or\r\ncompressed to the measure of that one they will rattle about loosely or\r\nstick too tight in any other into which they may be thrust. Still, more\r\nor less adjustment takes place in every case. If a new Senator knock\r\nabout too loosely amidst the free spaces of the rules of that august\r\nbody, he will assuredly have some of his biggest corners knocked off and\r\nhis angularities thus made smoother; if he stick fast amongst the\r\ndignified courtesies and punctilious observances of the upper chamber,\r\nhe will, if he stick long enough, finally wear down to such a size, by\r\njostling, as to attain some motion more or less satisfactory. But it\r\nmust be said, on the other hand, that even if the Senate were made up of\r\nsomething better than selections from the House, it would probably be\r\nable to do little more than it does in the way of giving efficiency to\r\nour system of legislation. For it has those same radical defects of\r\norganization which weaken the House. Its functions also, like those of\r\nthe House, are segregated in the prerogatives of numerous Standing\r\nCommittees.[38] In this regard Congress is all of a piece. There is in\r\nthe Senate no more opportunity than exists in the House for gaining such\r\nrecognized party leadership as would be likely to enlarge a man by\r\ngiving him a sense of power, and to steady and sober him by filling him\r\nwith a grave sense of responsibility. So far as its organization\r\ncontrols it, the Senate, notwithstanding the one or two special\r\nexcellences which make it more temperate and often more rational than\r\nthe House, has no virtue which marks it as of a different nature. Its\r\nproceedings bear most of the characteristic features of committee\r\nrule.[39] Its conclusions are suggested now by one set oL its members,\r\nnow by another set, and again by a third; an arrangement which is of\r\ncourse quite effective in its case, as in that of the House, in\r\ndepriving it of that leadership which is valuable in more ways than in\r\nimparting distinct purpose to legislative action, because it\r\nconcentrates party responsibility, attracts the best talents, and fixes\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\nSome Senators are, indeed, seen to be of larger mental stature and built\r\nof stauncher moral stuff than their fellow-members, and it is not\r\nuncommon for individual members to become conspicuous figures in every\r\ngreat event in the Senate's deliberations. The public now and again\r\npicks out here and there a Senator who seems to act and to speak with\r\ntrue instinct of statesmanship and who unmistakably merits the\r\nconfidence of colleagues and of people. But such a man, however eminent,\r\nis never more than _a_ Senator. No one is _the_ Senator. No one may\r\nspeak for his party as well as for himself; no one exercises the special\r\ntrust of acknowledged leadership. The Senate is merely a body of\r\nindividual critics, representing most of the not very diversified types\r\nof a society substantially homogeneous; and the weight of every\r\ncriticism uttered in its chamber depends upon the weight of the critic\r\nwho utters it, deriving little if any addition to its specific gravity\r\nfrom connection with the designs of a purposeful party organization. I\r\ncannot insist too much upon this defect of congressional government,\r\nbecause it is evidently radical. Leadership with authority over a great\r\nruling party is a prize to attract great competitors, and is in a free\r\ngovernment the only prize that will attract great competitors. Its\r\nattractiveness is abundantly illustrated in the operations of the\r\nBritish system. In England, where members of the Cabinet, which is\r\nmerely a Committee of the House of Commons, are the rulers of the\r\nempire, a career in the Commons is eagerly sought by men of the rarest\r\ngifts, because a career there is the best road, is indeed the only road,\r\nto membership of the great Committee. A part in the life of Congress, on\r\nthe contrary, though the best career opened to men of ambition by our\r\nsystem, has no prize at its end greater than membership of some one of\r\nnumerous Committees, between which there is some choice, to be sure,\r\nbecause some of them have great and others only small jurisdictions, but\r\nnone of which has the distinction of supremacy in policy or of\r\nrecognized authority to do more than suggest. And posts upon such\r\nCommittees are the highest posts in the Senate just as they are in the\r\nHouse pf Representatives.\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered on a recent occasion,[40] in the capacity of\r\nPresident of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, Mr. Froude, having in\r\nmind, of course, British forms of government, but looking mediately at\r\nall popular systems, said very pointedly that \"In party government party\r\nlife becomes like a court of justice. The people are the judges, the\r\npoliticians the advocates, who,\" he adds caustically rather than justly,\r\n\"only occasionally and by accident speak their real opinions.\" \"The\r\ntruly great political orators,\" he exclaims, \"are the ornaments of\r\nmankind, the most finished examples of noble feeling and perfect\r\nexpression, but they rarely understand the circumstances of their time.\r\nThey feel passionately, but for that reason they cannot judge calmly.\"\r\nIf we are to accept these judgments from Mr. Froude in the face of his\r\nreputation for thinking somewhat too independently of evidence, we\r\nshould congratulate ourselves that we have in this country hit upon a\r\nsystem which, now that it has reached its perfection, has left little or\r\nno place for politicians to make false declarations or for the orator to\r\ncoin fine expression for views which are only feelings, except outside\r\nof the legislative halls of the nation, upon the platform, where talk is\r\nall that is expected. It would seem as if the seer had a much more\r\nfavorable opportunity in the committee-room than the orator can have,\r\nand with us it is the committee-room which governs the legislative\r\nchamber. The speech-making in the latter neither makes nor often\r\nseriously affects the plans framed in the former; because the plans are\r\nmade before the speeches are uttered. This is self-evident of the\r\ndebates of the House; but even the speeches made in the Senate, free,\r\nfull, and earnest as they seem, are made, so to speak, after the\r\nfact--not to determine the actions but to air the opinions of the body.\r\n\r\nStill, it must be regarded as no inconsiderable addition to the\r\nusefulness of the Senate that it enjoys a much greater freedom of\r\ndiscussion than the House can allow itself. It permits itself a good\r\ndeal of talk in public about what it is doing,[41] and it commonly talks\r\na great deal of sense. It is small enough to make it safe to allow\r\nindividual freedom to its members, and to have, at the same time, such\r\norder and sense of proportion in its proceedings as is characteristic of\r\nsmall bodies, like boards of college trustees or of commercial\r\ndirectors, who feel that their main object is business, not\r\nspeech-making, and so say all that is necessary without being tedious,\r\nand do what they are called upon to do without need of driving\r\nthemselves with hurrying rules. Such rules, they seem to feel, are meant\r\nonly for big assemblies which have no power of self-control. Of course\r\nthe Senate talks more than an average board of directors would, because\r\nthe corporations which it represents are States, made up, politically\r\nspeaking, of numerous popular constituencies to which Senators, no less\r\nthan Representatives, must make speeches of a sort which, considering\r\ntheir fellow-members alone, would be unnecessary if not impertinent and\r\nout of taste, in the Senate chamber, but which will sound best in the\r\nears of the people, for whose ears they are intended, if delivered\r\nthere. Speeches which, so to say, run in the name of the Senate's\r\nbusiness will generally be more effectual for campaign uses at home than\r\nany speech could be which should run in the name of the proper topics of\r\nthe stump. There is an air of doing one's duty by one's party in\r\nspeaking party platitudes or uttering party defiances on the floor of\r\nthe Senate or of the House. Of course, however, there is less temptation\r\nto such speech-making in the Senate than in the House. The House knows\r\nthe terrible possibilities of this sort in store for it, were it to give\r\nperfect freedom of debate to its three hundred and twenty-five members,\r\nin these days when frequent mails and tireless tongues of telegraphy\r\nbring every constituency within easy earshot of Washington; and it\r\ntherefore seeks to confine what little discussion it indulges in to the\r\nfew committee-men specially in charge of the business of each moment.\r\nBut the Senate is small and of settled habits, and has no such bugbear\r\nto trouble it. It can afford to do without any _cloture_ or previous\r\nquestion. No Senator is likely to want to speak on all the topics of the\r\nsession, or to prepare more speeches than can conveniently be spoken\r\nbefore adjournment is imperatively at hand. The House can be counted\r\nupon to waste enough time to leave some leisure to the upper chamber.\r\n\r\nAnd there can be no question that the debates which take place every\r\nsession in the Senate are of a very high order of excellence. The\r\naverage of the ability displayed in its discussions not infrequently\r\nrises quite to the level of those controversies of the past which we are\r\nwont to call great because they furnished occasion to men like Webster\r\nand Calhoun and Clay, whom we cannot now quite match in mastery of\r\nknowledge and of eloquence. If the debates of the present are smothered\r\namongst the innumerable folios of the \"Record,\" it is not because they\r\ndo not contain utterances worthy to be heeded and to gain currency, but\r\nbecause they do not deal with questions of passion or of national\r\nexistence, such as ran through all the earlier debates, or because our\r\nsystem so obscures and complicates party rule in legislation as to leave\r\nnothing very interesting to the public eye dependent upon the\r\ndiscussions of either House or Senate. What that is picturesque, or what\r\nthat is vital in the esteem of the partisan, is there in these wordy\r\ncontests about contemplated legislation? How does anybody know that\r\neither party's prospects will be much affected by what is said when\r\nSenators are debating, or, for that matter, by what is voted after their\r\nlongest flights of controversy?\r\n\r\nStill, though not much heeded, the debates of the Senate are of great\r\nvalue in scrutinizing and sifting matters which come up from the House.\r\nThe Senate's opportunities for open and unrestricted discussion and its\r\nsimple, comparatively unencumbered forms of procedure, unquestionably\r\nenable it to fulfill with very considerable success its high functions\r\nas a chamber of revision.\r\n\r\nWhen this has been claimed and admitted, however, it still remains to be\r\nconsidered whether two chambers of equal power strengthen by steadying,\r\nor weaken by complicating, a system of representative government like\r\nour own. The utility and excellence of a bicameral system has never, I\r\nbelieve, been seriously questioned in this country; but M. Turgot\r\nsmiles with something like contempt at our affectation in copying the\r\nHouse of Lords without having any lords to use for the purpose; and in\r\nour own day Mr. Bagehot, who is much more competent to speak on this\r\nhead than was M. Turgot, has avowed very grave doubts as to the\r\npractical advantage of a two-headed legislature--each head having its\r\nown independent will. He finds much to recommend the House of Lords in\r\nthe fact that it is not, as theory would have it, coordinate and coequal\r\nwith the House of Commons, but merely \"a revising and suspending House,\"\r\naltering what the Commons have done hastily or carelessly, and sometimes\r\nrejecting \"Bills on which the House of Commons is not yet thoroughly in\r\nearnest,--upon which the nation is not yet determined.\"[42] He points\r\nout the fact that the House of Lords has never in modern times been, as\r\na House, coequal in power with the House of Commons. Before the Reform\r\nBill of 1832 the peers were all-powerful in legislation; not, however,\r\nbecause they were members of the House of Lords, but because they\r\nnominated most of the members of the House of Commons. Since that\r\ndisturbing reform they have been thrown back upon the functions in\r\nwhich they never were strong, the functions of a deliberative assembly.\r\nThese are the facts which seem to Mr. Bagehot to have made it possible\r\nfor legislation to make easy and satisfactory progress under a system\r\nwhose theory provided for fatal dead-locks between the two branches of\r\nthe supreme legislature.\r\n\r\nIn his view \"the evil of two coequal Houses of distinct natures is\r\nobvious.\" \"Most constitutions,\" he declares, \"have committed this\r\nblunder. The two most remarkable Republican institutions in the world\r\ncommit it. In both the American and Swiss Constitutions the Upper House\r\nhas as much authority as the second; it could produce the maximum of\r\nimpediment--a dead-lock, if it liked; if it does not do so, it is owing\r\nnot to the goodness of the legal constitution, but to the discreetness\r\nof the members of the Chamber. In both these constitutions this\r\ndangerous division is defended by a peculiar doctrine.... It is said\r\nthat there must be in a federal government some institution, some\r\nauthority, some body possessing a veto in which the separate States\r\ncomprising the Confederation are all equal. I confess this doctrine has\r\nto me no self-evidence, and it is assumed, but not proved. The State of\r\nDelaware is not equal in power or influence to the State of New York,\r\nand you cannot make it so by giving it an equal veto in an Upper\r\nChamber. The history of such an institution is indeed most natural. A\r\nlittle State will like, and must like, to see some token, some memorial\r\nmark, of its old independence preserved in the Constitution by which\r\nthat independence is extinguished. But it is one thing for an\r\ninstitution to be natural, and another for it to be expedient. If indeed\r\nit be that a federal government compels the erection of an Upper Chamber\r\nof conclusive and coordinate authority, it is one more in addition to\r\nthe many other inherent defects of that kind of government. It may be\r\nnecessary to have the blemish, but it is a blemish just as much.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be in the highest degree indiscreet to differ lightly with any\r\nconclusion to which Mr. Bagehot may have come in viewing that field of\r\ncritical exposition in which he was supreme, the philosophical analysis,\r\nnamely, of the English Constitution; and it must be apparent to any one\r\nwho reads the passage I have just now quoted that his eye sees very\r\nkeenly and truly even when he looks across sea at institutions which\r\nwere repugnant to his own way of thinking. But it is safe to say that he\r\ndid not see all in this instance, and that he was consequently in error\r\nconcerning the true nature of our federal legislative system. His error,\r\nnevertheless, appears, not when we look only at the facts which he held\r\nup to view, but when we look at other facts which he ignored. It is true\r\nthat the existence of two coequal Houses is an evil when those two\r\nHouses are of distinct natures, as was the case under the Victorian\r\nConstitution to which Mr. Bagehot refers by way of illustrative example.\r\nUnder that Constitution all legislative business was sometimes to be\r\nseen quite suspended because of irreconcilable differences of opinion\r\nbetween the Upper House, which represented the rich wool-growers of the\r\ncolony, and the Lower Assembly, which represented the lesser\r\nwool-growers, perhaps, and the people who were not wool-growers at all.\r\nThe Upper House, in other words, was a class chamber, and thus stood\r\nquite apart from anything like the principle embodied in our own Senate,\r\nwhich is no more a class chamber than is the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe prerogatives of the Senate do, indeed, render our legislative system\r\nmore complex, and for that reason possibly more cumbersome, than the\r\nBritish; for our Senate can do more than the House of Lords. It can not\r\nonly question and stay the judgment of the Commons, but may always with\r\nperfect safety act upon its own judgment and gainsay the more popular\r\nchamber to the end of the longest chapter of the bitterest controversy.\r\nIt is quite as free to act as is any other branch of the government,\r\nand quite as sure to have its acts regarded. But there is safety and\r\nease in the fact that the Senate never wishes to carry its resistance to\r\nthe House to that point at which resistance must stay all progress in\r\nlegislation; because there is really a \"latent unity\" between the Senate\r\nand the House which makes continued antagonism between them next to\r\nimpossible--certainly in the highest degree improbable. The Senate and\r\nthe House are of different origins, but virtually of the same nature.\r\nThe Senate is less democratic than the House, and consequently less\r\nsensible to transient phases of public opinion; but it is no less\r\nsensible than the House of its ultimate accountability to the people,\r\nand is consequently quite as obedient to the more permanent and\r\nimperative judgments of the public mind. It cannot be carried so quickly\r\nby every new sentiment, but it can be carried quickly enough. There is a\r\nmain chance of election time for it as well as for the House to think\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nBy the mode of its election and the greater length of the term by which\r\nits seats are held, the Senate is almost altogether removed from that\r\ntemptation to servile obedience to the whims of popular constituencies\r\nto which the House is constantly subject, without as much courage as\r\nthe Senate has to guard its virtue. But the men who compose the Senate\r\nare of the same sort as the members of the House of Representatives, and\r\nrepresent quite as various classes. Nowadays many of the Senators are,\r\nindeed, very rich men, and there has come to be a great deal of talk\r\nabout their vast wealth and the supposed aristocratic tendencies which\r\nit is imagined to breed. But even the rich Senators cannot be said to be\r\nrepresentatives of a class, as if they were all opulent wool-growers or\r\ngreat land-owners. Their wealth is in all sorts of stocks, in all sorts\r\nof machinery, in all sorts of buildings, in possessions of all the sorts\r\npossible in a land of bustling commerce and money-making industries.\r\nThey have made their money in a hundred different ways, or have\r\ninherited it from fathers who amassed it in enterprises too numerous to\r\nimagine; and they have it invested here, there, and everywhere, in this,\r\nthat, and everything. Their wealth represents no class interests, but\r\nall the interests of the commercial world. It represents the majority of\r\nthe nation, in a word; and so they can probably be trusted not to\r\nneglect one set of interests for another; not to despoil the trader for\r\nthe sake of the farmer, or the farmer for the sake of the wool-grower,\r\nor the wool-grower for the behoof of the herder of short-horned cattle.\r\nAt least the Senate is quite as trustworthy in this regard as is the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Senate is thus separated from class interests and quite\r\nas representative of the nation at large as is the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the fact that it is less quickly sensitive to the hasty\r\nor impulsive movements of public opinion constitutes its value as a\r\ncheck, a steadying weight, in our very democratic system. Our English\r\ncousins have worked out for themselves a wonderfully perfect scheme of\r\ngovernment by gradually making their monarchy unmonarchical. They have\r\nmade of it a republic steadied by a reverenced aristocracy and pivoted\r\nupon a stable throne. And just as the English system is a limited\r\nmonarchy because of Commons and Cabinet, ours may be said to be a\r\nlimited democracy because of the Senate. This has in the trial of the\r\nscheme proved the chief value of that upper chamber which was instituted\r\nprincipally as an earnest of the abiding equality and sovereignty of the\r\nStates. At any rate, this is the most conspicuous, and will prove to be\r\nthe most lasting, use of the Senate in our system. It is valuable in our\r\ndemocracy in proportion as it is undemocratic. I think that a\r\nphilosophical analysis of any successful and beneficent system of\r\nself-government will disclose the fact that its only effectual checks\r\nconsist in a mixture of elements, in a combination of seemingly\r\ncontradictory political principles; that the British government is\r\nperfect in proportion as it is unmonarchical, and ours safe in\r\nproportion as it is undemocratic; that the Senate saves us often from\r\nheadlong popular tyranny.\r\n\r\n\"The value, spirit, and essence of the House of Commons,\" said Burke,\r\n\"consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation;\"\r\nbut the image of the nation's feelings should not be the only thing\r\nreflected by the constitution of a free government. It is indispensable\r\nthat, besides the House of Representatives which runs on all fours with\r\npopular sentiment, we should have a body like the Senate which may\r\nrefuse to run with it at all when it seems to be wrong--a body which has\r\ntime and security enough to keep its head, if only now and then and but\r\nfor a little while, till other people have had time to think. The Senate\r\nis fitted to do deliberately and well the revising which is its\r\nproperest function, because its position as a representative of state\r\nsovereignty is one of eminent dignity, securing for it ready and sincere\r\nrespect, and because popular demands, ere they reach it with definite\r\nand authoritative suggestion, are diluted by passage through the\r\nfeelings and conclusions of the state legislatures, which are the\r\nSenate's only immediate constituents. The Senate commonly feels with\r\nthe House, but it does not, so to say, feel so fast. It at least has a\r\nchance to be the express image of those judgments of the nation which\r\nare slower and more temperate than its feelings.\r\n\r\nThis it is which makes the Senate \"the most powerful and efficient\r\nsecond chamber that exists,\"[43] and this it is which constitutes its\r\nfunctions one of the effectual checks, one of the real balances, of our\r\nsystem; though it is made to seem very insignificant in the literary\r\ntheory of the Constitution, where the checks of state upon federal\r\nauthorities, of executive prerogatives upon legislative powers, and of\r\nJudiciary upon President and Congress, though some of them in reality\r\ninoperative from the first and all of them weakened by many \"ifs\" and\r\n\"buts,\" are made to figure in the leading roles, as the characteristic\r\nVirtues, triumphing over the characteristic Vices, of our new and\r\noriginal political Morality-play.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be accounted a deduction from the Senate's\r\nusefulness that it is seldom sure of more than two thirds of itself for\r\nmore than four years at a time. In order that its life may be perpetual,\r\none third of its membership is renewed or changed every two years, each\r\nthird taking its turn at change or renewal in regular succession; and\r\nthis device has, of course, an appreciably weakening effect on the\r\nlegislative sinews of the Senate. Because the Senate mixes the parties\r\nin the composition of its Committees just as the House does, and those\r\nCommittees must, consequently, be subjected to modification whenever the\r\nbiennial senatorial elections bring in new men, freshly promoted from\r\nthe House or from gubernatorial chairs. Places must be found for them at\r\nonce in the working organization which busies itself in the\r\ncommittee-rooms. Six years is not the term of the Senate, but only of\r\neach Senator. Reckoning from any year in which one third of the Senate\r\nis elected, the term of the majority,--the two thirds not affected by\r\nthe election,--is an average of the four and the two years which it has\r\nto live. There is never a time at which two thirds of the Senate have\r\nmore than four years of appointed service before them. And this constant\r\nliability to change must, of course, materially affect the policy of the\r\nbody. The time assured it in which to carry out any enterprise of policy\r\nupon which it may embark is seldom more than two years, the term of the\r\nHouse. It may be checked no less effectually than the lower House by the\r\nbiennial elections, albeit the changes brought about in its membership\r\nare effected, not directly by the people, but indirectly and more\r\nslowly by the mediate operation of public opinion through the\r\nlegislatures of the States.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of the Senate, therefore, as a branch of the\r\nnational legislature, we should offset the committee organization, with\r\nits denial of leadership which disintegrates the Senate, and that\r\nliability to the biennial infusion of new elements which may at any time\r\ninterrupt the policy and break the purpose of the Senate, against those\r\nhabits of free and open debate which clear its mind, and to some extent\r\nthe mind of the public, with regard to the nation's business, doing much\r\ntowards making legislation definite and consistent, and against those\r\ngreat additions to its efficiency which spring from its observation of\r\n\"slow and steady forms\" of procedure, from the mediate election which\r\ngives it independence, and from its having a rational and august cause\r\nfor existing.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to consider the Senate in its relations with the executive,\r\nwe see it no longer as a legislative chamber, but as a consultative\r\nexecutive council. And just here there is to be noted an interesting\r\ndifference between the relations of the Senate with the President and\r\nits relations with the departments, which are in constitutional theory\r\none with the President. It deals directly with the President in acting\r\nupon nominations and upon treaties. It goes into \"executive session\" to\r\nhandle without gloves the acts of the chief magistrate. Its dealings\r\nwith the departments, on the other hand, are, like those of the House,\r\nonly indirect. Its legislative, not its executive, function is the whip\r\nwhich coerces the Secretaries. Its will is the supreme law in the\r\noffices of the government; and yet it orders policy by no direct word to\r\nthe departments. It does not consult and negotiate with them as it does\r\nwith the President, their titular head. Its immediate agents, the\r\nCommittees, are not the recognized constitutional superiors of Secretary\r\nA. or Comptroller B.; but these officials cannot move a finger or plan\r\nmore than a paltry detail without looking to it that they render strict\r\nobedience to the wishes of these outside, uncommissioned, and\r\nirresponsible, but none the less authoritative and imperative masters.\r\n\r\nThis feature of the Senate's power over the executive does not, however,\r\ncall for special emphasis here, because it is not a power peculiar to\r\nthe Senate, this overlordship of the departments, but one which it\r\npossesses in common with the House of Representatives,--simply an innate\r\nand inseparable part of the absolutism of a supreme legislature. It is\r\nthe Senate's position as the President's council in some great and many\r\nsmall matters which call for particular discussion. Its general tyranny\r\nover the departments belongs rather with what I am to say presently when\r\nlooking at congressional government from the stand-point of the\r\nexecutive.\r\n\r\nThe greatest consultative privilege of the Senate,--the greatest in\r\ndignity, at least, if not in effect upon the interests of the\r\ncountry,--is its right to a ruling voice in the ratification of treaties\r\nwith foreign powers. I have already alluded to this privilege, for the\r\npurpose of showing what weight it has had in many instances in\r\ndisarranging the ideal balance supposed to exist between the powers of\r\nCongress and the constitutional prerogatives of the President; but I did\r\nnot then stop to discuss the organic reasons which have made it\r\nimpossible that there should be any real consultation between the\r\nPresident and the Senate upon such business, and which have,\r\nconsequently, made disagreement and even antagonism between them\r\nprobable outcomes of the system. I do not consult the auditor who\r\nscrutinizes my accounts when I submit to him my books, my vouchers, and\r\na written report of the business I have negotiated. I do not take his\r\nadvice and seek his consent; I simply ask his endorsement or invite his\r\ncondemnation. I do not sue for his cooperation, but challenge his\r\ncriticism. And the analogy between my relations with the auditor and\r\nthe relations of the President with the Senate is by no means remote.\r\nThe President really has no voice at all in the conclusions of the\r\nSenate with reference to his diplomatic transactions, or with reference\r\nto any of the matters upon which he consults it; and yet without a voice\r\nin the conclusion there is no consultation. Argument and an unobstructed\r\ninterchange of views upon a ground of absolute equality are essential\r\nparts of the substance of genuine consultation. The Senate, when it\r\ncloses its doors, upon going into \"executive session,\" closes them upon\r\nthe President as much as upon the rest of the world. He cannot meet\r\ntheir objections to his courses except through the clogged and\r\ninadequate channels of a written message or through the friendly but\r\nunauthoritative offices of some Senator who may volunteer his active\r\nsupport. Nay, in many cases the President may not even know what the\r\nSenate's objections were. He is made to approach that body as a servant\r\nconferring with his master, and of course deferring to that master. His\r\nonly power of compelling compliance on the part of the Senate lies in\r\nhis initiative in negotiation, which affords him a chance to get the\r\ncountry into such scrapes, so pledged in the view of the world to\r\ncertain courses of action, that the Senate hesitates to bring about the\r\nappearance of dishonor which would follow its refusal to ratify the\r\nrash promises or to support the indiscreet threats of the Department of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of consultation between the Senate and the President is of\r\ncourse the committee machinery. The Senate sends treaties to its\r\nStanding Committee on Foreign Relations, which ponders the President's\r\nmessages accompanying the treaties and sets itself to understand the\r\nsituation in the light of all the information available. If the\r\nPresident wishes some more satisfactory mode of communication with the\r\nSenate than formal message-writing, his only door of approach is this\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations. The Secretary of State may confer with\r\nits chairman or with its more influential members. But such a mode of\r\nconference is manifestly much less than a voice in the deliberations of\r\nthe Senate itself,--much less than meeting that body face to face in\r\nfree consultation and equal debate. It is almost as distinctly dealing\r\nwith a foreign power as were the negotiations preceding the proposed\r\ntreaty. It must predispose the Senate to the temper of an overseer.[44]\r\n\r\nStill, treaties are not every-day affairs with us, and exceptional\r\nbusiness may create in Senators an exceptional sense of responsibility,\r\nand dispose them to an unwonted desire to be dispassionate and fair. The\r\nratification of treaties is a much more serious matter than the\r\nconsideration of nominations which every session constitutes so constant\r\na diversion from the more ponderous business of legislation. It is in\r\ndealing with nominations, however, that there is the most friction in\r\nthe contact between the President and his overlord, the Senate. One of\r\nthe most noteworthy instances of the improper tactics which may arise\r\nout of these relations was the case of that Mr. Smythe, at the time\r\nCollector for the port of New York, whom, in 1869, President Grant\r\nnominated Minister to the Court of St. Petersburg. The nomination, as\r\nlooking towards an appointment to diplomatic service, was referred to\r\nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, of which Mr. Charles Sumner was then\r\nchairman. That Committee rejected the nomination; but Smythe had great\r\ninfluence at his back and was himself skilled beyond most men in the\r\narts of the lobby. He accordingly succeeded in securing such support in\r\nthe Senate as to become a very formidable dog in the manger, not himself\r\ngaining the appointment, but for a time blocking all other appointments\r\nand bringing the business of the Senate altogether to a stand-still,\r\nbecause he could not.[45] Smythe himself is forgotten; but no observer\r\nof the actual conditions of senatorial power can fail to see the grave\r\nimport of the lesson which his case teaches, because his case was by no\r\nmeans an isolated one. There have been scores of others quite as bad;\r\nand we could have no assurance that there might not in the future be\r\nhundreds more, had not recent movements in the direction of a radical\r\nreform of the civil service begun to make nominations represent, not the\r\npersonal preference of the President or the intrigues of other people,\r\nbut honest, demonstrated worth, which the Senate is likely to feel\r\nforced to accept without question, when the reform reaches the highest\r\ngrades of the service.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the Senate's connection with the civil service and the\r\nabuses surrounding that connection, one is, therefore, discussing a\r\nphase of congressional government which promises soon to become\r\nobsolete. A consummation devoutly to be wished!--and yet sure when it\r\ncomes to rob our politics of a feature very conspicuous and very\r\ncharacteristic, and in a sense very entertaining. There are not many\r\nthings in the proceedings of Congress which the people care to observe\r\nwith any diligence, and it must be confessed that scandalous\r\ntransactions in the Senate with reference to nominations were among the\r\nfew things that the country watched and talked about with keen relish\r\nand interest. This was the personal element which always had spice in\r\nit. When Senator Conkling resigned in a huff because he could not have\r\nwhom he liked in the collectorship of the port of New York, the country\r\nrubbed its hands; and when the same imperious politician sought\r\nreelection as a vindication of that unconstitutional control of\r\nnominations which masqueraded as \"the courtesy of the Senate,\" the\r\ncountry discussed his chances with real zest and chuckled over the whole\r\naffair in genuine glee. It was a big fight worth seeing. It would have\r\nbeen too bad to miss it.\r\n\r\nBefore the sentiment of reform had become strong enough to check it,\r\nthis abuse of the consultative privileges of the Senate in the matter of\r\nnominations had assumed such proportions as to seem to some the ugliest\r\ndeformity in our politics. It looked as if it were becoming at once the\r\nweakest and the most tried and strained joint of our federal system. If\r\nthere was to be a break, would it not be there, where was the severest\r\nwear and tear? The evil practices seemed the more ineradicable because\r\nthey had arisen in the most natural manner. The President was compelled,\r\nas in the case of treaties, to obtain the sanction of the Senate\r\nwithout being allowed any chance of consultation with it; and there soon\r\ngrew up within the privacy of \"executive session\" an understanding that\r\nthe wishes and opinions of each Senator who was of the President's own\r\nparty should have more weight than even the inclinations of the majority\r\nin deciding upon the fitness or desirability of persons proposed to be\r\nappointed to offices in that Senator's State. There was the requisite\r\nprivacy to shield from public condemnation the practice arising out of\r\nsuch an understanding; and the President himself was always quite out of\r\nearshot, hearing only of results, of final votes.\r\n\r\nAll through the direct dealings of the Senate with the President there\r\nruns this characteristic spirit of irresponsible dictation. The\r\nPresident may tire the Senate by dogged persistence, but he can never\r\ndeal with it upon a ground of real equality. He has no real presence in\r\nthe Senate. His power does not extend beyond the most general\r\nsuggestion. The Senate always has the last word. No one would desire to\r\nsee the President possessed of authority to overrule the decisions of\r\nthe Senate, to treat with foreign powers, and appoint thousands of\r\npublic officers, without any other than that shadowy responsibility\r\nwhich he owes to the people that elected him; but it is certainly an\r\nunfortunate feature of our government that Congress governs without\r\nbeing put into confidential relations with the agents through whom it\r\ngoverns. It dictates to another branch of the government which was\r\nintended to be coordinate and coequal with it, and over which it has no\r\nlegalized authority as of a master, but only the authority of a bigger\r\nstockholder, of a monopolist indeed, of all the energetic prerogatives\r\nof the government. It is as if the Army and Navy Departments were to be\r\nmade coordinate and coequal, but the absolute possession and control of\r\nall ammunition and other stores of war given to the one and denied the\r\nother. The executive is taken into partnership with the legislature upon\r\na salary which may be withheld, and is allowed no voice in the\r\nmanagement of the business. It is simply charged with the\r\nsuperintendence of the employees.\r\n\r\nIt was not essentially different in the early days when the President in\r\nperson read his message to the Senate and the House together as an\r\naddress, and the Senate in a body carried its reply to the executive\r\nmansion. The address was the formal communication of an outsider just as\r\nmuch as the message of to-day is, and the reply of the Senate was no\r\nless a formal document which it turned aside from its regular business\r\nto prepare. That meeting face to face was not consultation. The English\r\nParliament does not consult with the sovereign when it assembles to hear\r\nthe address from the throne.\r\n\r\nIt would, doubtless, be considered quite improper to omit from an essay\r\non the Senate all mention of the Senate's President; and yet there is\r\nvery little to be said about the Vice-President of the United States.\r\nHis position is one of anomalous insignificance and curious uncertainty.\r\nApparently he is not, strictly speaking, a part of the legislature,--he\r\nis clearly not a member,--yet neither is he an officer of the executive.\r\nIt is one of the remarkable things about him, that it is hard to find in\r\nsketching the government any proper place to discuss him. He comes in\r\nmost naturally along with the Senate to which he is tacked; but he does\r\nnot come in there for any great consideration. He is simply a judicial\r\nofficer set to moderate the proceedings of an assembly whose rules he\r\nhas had no voice in framing and can have no voice in changing. His\r\nofficial stature is not to be compared with that of the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives. So long as he is Vice-President, he is\r\ninseparable officially from the Senate; his importance consists in the\r\nfact that he may cease to be Vice-President. His chief dignity, next to\r\npresiding over the Senate, lies in the circumstance that he is awaiting\r\nthe death or disability of the President. And the chief embarrassment in\r\ndiscussing his office is, that in explaining how little there is to be\r\nsaid about it one has evidently said all there is to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\n     Every political constitution in which different bodies share the\r\n     supreme power is only enabled to exist by the forbearance of those\r\n     among whom this power is distributed.--LORD JOHN RUSSELL.\r\n\r\n     Simplicity and logical neatness are not the good to be aimed at in\r\n     politics, but freedom and order, with props against the pressure of\r\n     time, and arbitrary will, and sudden crises.--THEO. WOOLSEY.\r\n\r\n     Nothing, indeed, will appear more certain, on any tolerable\r\n     consideration of this matter, than that _every sort of government\r\n     ought to have its administration, correspondent to its\r\n     legislature_.--BURKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is at once curious and instructive to note how we have been forced\r\ninto practically amending the Constitution without constitutionally\r\namending it. The legal processes of constitutional change are so slow\r\nand cumbersome that we have been constrained to adopt a serviceable\r\nframework of fictions which enables us easily to preserve the forms\r\nwithout laboriously obeying the spirit of the Constitution, which will\r\nstretch as the nation grows. It would seem that no impulse short of the\r\nimpulse of self-preservation, no force less than the force of\r\nrevolution, can nowadays be expected to move the cumbrous machinery of\r\nformal amendment erected in Article Five. That must be a tremendous\r\nmovement of opinion which can sway two thirds of each House of Congress\r\nand the people of three fourths of the States. Mr. Bagehot has pointed\r\nout that one consequence of the existence of this next to immovable\r\nmachinery \"is that the most obvious evils cannot be quickly remedied,\"\r\nand \"that a clumsy working and a curious technicality mark the politics\r\nof a rough-and-ready people. The practical arguments and legal\r\ndisquisitions in America,\" continues he, \"are often like those of\r\ntrustees carrying out a misdrawn will,--the sense of what they mean is\r\ngood, but it can never be worked out fully or defended simply, so\r\nhampered is it by the old words of an old testament.\"[46] But much the\r\ngreater consequence is that we have resorted, almost unconscious of the\r\npolitical significance of what we did, to extra-constitutional means of\r\nmodifying the federal system where it has proved to be too refined by\r\nbalances of divided authority to suit practical uses,--to be out of\r\nsquare with the main principle of its foundation, namely, government by\r\nthe people through their representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nOur method of choosing Presidents is a notable illustration of these\r\nremarks. The difference between the actual and the constitutional modes\r\nis the difference between an ideal non-partisan choice and a choice\r\nmade under party whips; the difference between a choice made by\r\nindependent, unpledged electors acting apart in the States and a choice\r\nmade by a national party convention. Our Executive, no less than the\r\nEnglish and French Executives, is selected by a representative,\r\ndeliberative body, though in England and France the election is\r\ncontrolled by a permanent legislative chamber, and here by a transient\r\nassembly chosen for the purpose and dying with the execution of that\r\npurpose. In England the whole cabinet is practically elective. The\r\nFrench Chambers formally elect the President, the titular head of the\r\ngovernment, and the President regards only the will of the Assembly in\r\nappointing the Prime Minister, who is the energetic head of the\r\ngovernment, and who, in his turn, surrounds himself with colleagues who\r\nhave the confidence of the legislature. And the French have but copied\r\nthe English constitution, which makes the executive Ministry the\r\nrepresentatives of the party majority in the Commons. With us, on the\r\nother hand, the President is elected by one representative body, which\r\nhas nothing to do with him after his election, and the cabinet must be\r\napproved by another representative body, which has nothing directly to\r\ndo with them after their appointment.\r\n\r\nOf course I do not mean that the choice of a national convention is\r\nliterally election. The convention only nominates a candidate. But that\r\ncandidate is the only man for whom the electors of his party can vote;\r\nand so the expression of the preference of the convention of the\r\ndominant party is practically equivalent to election, and might as well\r\nbe called election by any one who is writing of broad facts, and not of\r\nfine distinctions. The sovereign in England picks out the man who is to\r\nbe Prime Minister, but he must pick where the Commons point; and so it\r\nis simpler, as well as perfectly true, to say that the Commons elect the\r\nPrime Minister. My agent does not select the particular horse I instruct\r\nhim to buy. This is just the plain fact,--that the electors are the\r\nagents of the national conventions; and this fact constitutes more than\r\nan amendment of that original plan which would have had all the electors\r\nto be what the first electors actually were, trustworthy men given\r\n_carte blanche_ to vote for whom they pleased, casting their ballots in\r\nthirteen state capitals in the hope that they would happen upon a\r\nmajority agreement.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while, too, to notice another peculiarity of this elective\r\nsystem. There is a thorough-going minority representation in the\r\nassemblies which govern our elections. Across the ocean a Liberal Prime\r\nMinister is selected by the representatives only of those Liberals who\r\nlive in Liberal constituencies; those who live elsewhere in a helpless\r\nminority, in a Conservative district, having of course no voice in the\r\nselection. A Conservative Premier, in like manner, owes nothing to those\r\nConservatives who were unable to return a member to Parliament. So far\r\nas he is concerned, they count for Liberals, since their representative\r\nin the Commons is a Liberal. The parliaments which select our\r\nPresidents, on the contrary, are, each of them, all of a kind. No state\r\ndistrict can have so few Republicans in it as not to be entitled to a\r\nrepresentative in the national Republican convention equal to that of\r\nthe most unanimously Republican district in the country; and a\r\nRepublican State is accorded as full a representation in a Democratic\r\nconvention as is the most Democratic of her sister States.\r\n\r\nWe had to pass through several stages of development before the present\r\nsystem of election by convention was reached. At the first two\r\npresidential elections the electors were left free to vote as their\r\nconsciences and the Constitution bade them; for the Constitution bade\r\nthem vote as they deemed best, and it did not require much discretion to\r\nvote for General Washington. But when General Washington was out of the\r\nrace, and new parties began to dispute the field with the Federalists,\r\nparty managers could not help feeling anxious about the votes of the\r\nelectors, and some of those named to choose the second President were,\r\naccordingly, pledged beforehand to vote thus and so. After the third\r\npresidential election there began to be congressional oversight of the\r\nmatter. From 1800 to 1824 there was an unbroken succession of caucuses\r\nof the Republican members of Congress to direct the action of the party\r\nelectors; and nomination by caucus died only when the Republican party\r\nbecame virtually the only party worth reckoning with,--the only party\r\nfor whom nomination was worth while,--and then public opinion began to\r\ncry out against such secret direction of the monopoly. In 1796 the\r\nFederalist congressmen had held an informal caucus to ascertain their\r\nminds as to the approaching election; but after that they refrained from\r\nfurther experiment in the same direction, and contented themselves with\r\nnow and then a sort of convention until they had no party to convene. In\r\n1828 there was a sort of dropping fire of nominations from state\r\nlegislatures; and in 1832 sat the first of the great national nominating\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, one form of congressional government which did not\r\nsucceed. It was a very logical mode of party government, that of\r\nnominating the chief magistrate by congressional caucus, but it was not\r\nan open enough way. The French chamber does not select premiers by\r\nshutting up the members of its majority in caucus. Neither does the\r\nHouse of Commons. Their selection is made by long and open trial, in\r\ndebate and in business management, of the men in whom they discover most\r\ntact for leading and most skill for planning, as well as most power for\r\nruling. They do not say, by vote, give us M. Ferry, give us Mr.\r\nGladstone; but Her Majesty knows as well as her subjects know that Mr.\r\nGladstone is the only man whom the Liberal majority will obey; and\r\nPresident Grevy perceives that M. Ferry is the only man whom the\r\nChambers can be made to follow. Each has elected himself by winning the\r\nfirst place in his party. The election has openly progressed for years,\r\nand is quite different from the private vote of a caucus about an\r\noutsider who is to sit, not in Congress, but in the executive mansion;\r\nwho is not their man, but the people's.\r\n\r\nNor would nominations by state legislatures answer any rational purpose.\r\nOf course every State had, or thought she had,--which is much the same\r\nthing,--some citizen worthy to become President; and it would have been\r\nconfusion worse confounded to have had as many candidates as there might\r\nbe States. So universal a competition between \"favorite sons\" would\r\nhave thrown the election into the House of Representatives so regularly\r\nas to replace the nominating caucus by an electing caucus.\r\n\r\nThe virtual election of the cabinet, the real executive, or at least the\r\nPrime Minister, the real head of the executive, by the Commons in\r\nEngland, furnishes us with a contrast rather than with a parallel to the\r\nelection of our premier, the head of our executive, by a deliberative,\r\nrepresentative body, because of the difference of function and of tenure\r\nbetween our Presidents and English Prime Ministers. William Pitt was\r\nelected to rule the House of Commons, John Adams to hold a\r\nconstitutional balance against the Houses of Congress. The one was the\r\nleader of the legislature; the other, so to say, the colleague of the\r\nlegislature. Besides, the Commons can not only make but also unmake\r\nMinistries; whilst conventions can do nothing but bind their parties by\r\nnomination, and nothing short of a well-nigh impossible impeachment can\r\nunmake a President, except four successions of the seasons. As has been\r\nvery happily said by a shrewd critic, our system is essentially\r\nastronomical. A President's usefulness is measured, not by efficiency,\r\nbut by calendar months. It is reckoned that if he be good at all he will\r\nbe good for four years. A Prime Minister must keep himself in favor with\r\nthe majority, a President need only keep alive.\r\n\r\nOnce the functions of a presidential elector were very august. He was to\r\nspeak for the people; they were to accept his judgment as theirs. He was\r\nto be as eminent in the qualities which win trust as was the greatest of\r\nthe Imperial Electors in the power which inspires fear. But now he is\r\nmerely a registering machine,--a sort of bell-punch to the hand of his\r\nparty convention. It gives the pressure, and he rings. It is, therefore,\r\npatent to every one that that portion of the Constitution which\r\nprescribes his functions is as though it were not. A very simple and\r\nnatural process of party organization, taking form first in\r\ncongressional caucuses and later in nominating conventions, has\r\nradically altered a Constitution which declares that it can be amended\r\nonly by the concurrence of two thirds of Congress and three fourths of\r\nthe States. The sagacious men of the constitutional convention of 1787\r\ncertainly expected their work to be altered, but can hardly have\r\nexpected it to be changed in so informal a manner.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which determine the choice of a nominating convention\r\nwhich names a President are radically different from the conditions\r\nwhich facilitate the choice of a representative chamber which selects\r\nfor itself a Prime Minister. \"Among the great purposes of a national\r\nparliament are these two,\" says Mr. Parton:[47] \"first, to train men for\r\npractical statesmanship; and secondly, to exhibit them to the country,\r\nso that, when men of ability are wanted, they can be found without\r\nanxious search and perilous trial.\" In those governments which are\r\nadministered by an executive committee of the legislative body, not only\r\nthis training but also this exhibition is constant and complete. The\r\ncareer which leads to cabinet office is a career of self-exhibition. The\r\nself-revelation is made in debate, and so is made to the nation at large\r\nas well as to the Ministry of the day, who are looking out for able\r\nrecruits, and to the Commons, whose ear is quick to tell a voice which\r\nit will consent to hear, a knowledge which it will pause to heed. But in\r\ngovernments like our own, in which legislative and executive services\r\nare altogether dissociated, this training is incomplete, and this\r\nexhibition almost entirely wanting. A nominating convention does not\r\nlook over the rolls of Congress to pick a man to suit its purpose; and\r\nif it did it could not find him, because Congress is not a school for\r\nthe preparation of administrators, and the convention is supposed to be\r\nsearching not for an experienced committee-man, but for a tried\r\nstatesman. The proper test for its application is not the test by which\r\ncongressmen are assayed. They make laws, but they do not have to order\r\nthe execution of the laws they make. They have a great deal of\r\nexperience in directing, but none at all in being directed. Their care\r\nis to pass bills, not to keep them in running order after they have\r\nbecome statutes. They spend their lives without having anything to do\r\ndirectly with administration, though administration is dependent upon\r\nthe measures which they enact.\r\n\r\nA Presidential convention, therefore, when it nominates a man who is, or\r\nhas been, a member of Congress, does not nominate him because of his\r\ncongressional experience, but because it is thought that he has other\r\nabilities which were not called out in Congress. Andrew Jackson had been\r\na member of Congress, but he was chosen President because he had won the\r\nbattle of New Orleans and had driven the Indians from Florida. It was\r\nthought that his military genius evinced executive genius. The men whose\r\nfame rests altogether upon laurels won in Congress have seldom been more\r\nsuccessful than Webster and Henry Clay in their candidacy for the chief\r\nmagistracy. Washington was a soldier; Jefferson cut but a sorry figure\r\nin debate; Monroe was a diplomatist; it required diligent inquiry to\r\nfind out what many of our Presidents had been before they became\r\ncandidates; and eminency in legislative service has always been at best\r\nbut an uncertain road to official preferment.\r\n\r\nOf late years a tendency is observable which seems to be making the\r\ngubernatorial chairs of the greater States the nearest offices to the\r\nPresidency; and it cannot but be allowed that there is much that is\r\nrational in the tendency. The governorship of a State is very like a\r\nsmaller Presidency; or, rather, the Presidency is very like a big\r\ngovernorship. Training in the duties of the one fits for the duties of\r\nthe other. This is the only avenue of subordinate place through which\r\nthe highest place can be naturally reached. Under the cabinet\r\ngovernments abroad a still more natural line of promotion is arranged.\r\nThe Ministry is a legislative Ministry, and draws its life from the\r\nlegislature, where strong talents always secure executive place. A long\r\ncareer in Parliament is at least a long contact with practical\r\nstatesmanship, and at best a long schooling in the duties of the\r\npractical statesman. But with us there is no such intimate relationship\r\nbetween legislative and executive service. From experience in state\r\nadministration to trial in the larger sphere of federal administration\r\nis the only natural order of promotion. We ought, therefore, to hail the\r\nrecognition of this fact as in keeping with the general plan of the\r\nfederal Constitution. The business of the President, occasionally\r\ngreat, is usually not much above routine. Most of the time it is _mere_\r\nadministration, mere obedience of directions from the masters of policy,\r\nthe Standing Committees. Except in so far as his power of veto\r\nconstitutes him a part of the legislature, the President might, not\r\ninconveniently, be a permanent officer; the first official of a\r\ncarefully-graded and impartially regulated civil service system, through\r\nwhose sure series of merit-promotions the youngest clerk might rise even\r\nto the chief magistracy.[48] He is part of the official rather than of\r\nthe political machinery of the government, and his duties call rather\r\nfor training than for constructive genius. If there can be found in the\r\nofficial systems of the States a lower grade of service in which men may\r\nbe advantageously drilled for Presidential functions, so much the\r\nbetter. The States will have better governors, the Union better\r\nPresidents, and there will have been supplied one of the most serious\r\nneeds left unsupplied by the Constitution,--the need for a proper school\r\nin which to rear federal administrators.\r\n\r\nAdministration is something that men must learn, not something to skill\r\nin which they are born. Americans take to business of all kinds more\r\nnaturally than any other nation ever did, and the executive duties of\r\ngovernment constitute just an exalted kind of business; but even\r\nAmericans are not Presidents in their cradles. One cannot have too much\r\npreparatory training and experience who is to fill so high a magistracy.\r\nIt is difficult to perceive, therefore, upon what safe ground of reason\r\nare built the opinions of those persons who regard short terms of\r\nservice as sacredly and peculiarly republican in principle. If\r\nrepublicanism is founded upon good sense, nothing so far removed from\r\ngood sense can be part and parcel of it. Efficiency is the only just\r\nfoundation for confidence in a public officer, under republican\r\ninstitutions no less than under monarchs; and short terms which cut off\r\nthe efficient as surely and inexorably as the inefficient are quite as\r\nrepugnant to republican as to monarchical rules of wisdom. Unhappily,\r\nhowever, this is not American doctrine. A President is dismissed almost\r\nas soon as he has learned the duties of his office, and a man who has\r\nserved a dozen terms in Congress is a curiosity. We are too apt to think\r\nboth the work of legislation and the work of administration easy enough\r\nto be done readily, with or without preparation, by any man of\r\ndiscretion and character. No one imagines that the dry-goods or the\r\nhardware trade, or even the cobbler's craft, can be successfully\r\nconducted except by those who have worked through a laborious and\r\nunremunerative apprenticeship, and who have devoted their lives to\r\nperfecting themselves as tradesmen or as menders of shoes. But\r\nlegislation is esteemed a thing which may be taken up with success by\r\nany shrewd man of middle age, which a lawyer may now and again\r\nadvantageously combine with his practice, or of which any intelligent\r\nyouth may easily catch the knack; and administration is regarded as\r\nsomething which an old soldier, an ex-diplomatist, or a popular\r\npolitician may be trusted to take to by instinct. No man of tolerable\r\ntalents need despair of having been born a Presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nThese must be pronounced very extraordinary conclusions for an eminently\r\npractical people to have accepted; and it must be received as an\r\nawakening of good sense that there is nowadays a decided inclination\r\nmanifested on the part of the nation to supply training-schools for the\r\nPresidency in like minor offices, such as the governorships of the\r\ngreater States. For the sort of Presidents needed under the present\r\narrangement of our federal government, it is best to choose amongst the\r\nablest and most experienced state governors.\r\n\r\nSo much for nomination and election. But, after election, what then?\r\nThe President is not all of the Executive. He cannot get along without\r\nthe men whom he appoints, with and by the consent and advice of the\r\nSenate; and they are really integral parts of that branch of the\r\ngovernment which he titularly contains in his one single person. The\r\ncharacters and training of the Secretaries are of almost as much\r\nimportance as his own gifts and antecedents; so that his appointment and\r\nthe Senate's confirmation must be added to the machinery of nomination\r\nby convention and election by automatic electors before the whole\r\nprocess of making up a working executive has been noted. The early\r\nCongresses seem to have regarded the Attorney-General and the four\r\nSecretaries[49] who constituted the first Cabinets as something more\r\nthan the President's lieutenants. Before the republican reaction which\r\nfollowed the supremacy of the Federalists, the heads of the departments\r\nappeared in person before the Houses to impart desired information, and\r\nto make what suggestions they might have to venture, just as the\r\nPresident attended in person to read his \"address.\" They were always\r\nrecognized units in the system, never mere ciphers to the Presidential\r\nfigure which led them. Their wills counted as independent wills.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this independence would seem, however, never to have been\r\nvery clearly defined. Whether or not the President was to take the\r\nadvice of his appointees and colleagues appears to have depended always\r\nupon the character and temper of the President. Here, for example, is\r\nwhat was reported in 1862. \"We pretend to no state secrets,\" said the\r\nNew York \"Evening Post,\"[50] \"but we have been told, upon what we deem\r\ngood authority, that no such thing as a combined, unitary, deliberative\r\nadministration exists; that the President's brave willingness to take\r\nall responsibility has quite neutralized the idea of a joint\r\nresponsibility; and that orders of the highest importance are issued,\r\nand movements commanded, which cabinet officers learn of as other people\r\ndo, or, what is worse, which the cabinet officers disapprove and protest\r\nagainst. Each cabinet officer, again, controls his own department pretty\r\nmuch as he pleases, without consultation with the President or with his\r\ncoadjutors, and often in the face of determinations which have been\r\nreached by the others.\" A picture this which forcibly reminds one of a\r\ncertain imperious Prime Minister, in his last days created Earl of\r\nChatham. These reports may have been true or they may have been mere\r\nrumors; but they depict a perfectly possible state of affairs. There is\r\nno influence except the ascendency or tact of the President himself to\r\nkeep a Cabinet in harmony and to dispose it to cooperation; so that it\r\nwould be very difficult to lay down any rules as to what elements really\r\nconstitute an Executive. Those elements can be determined exactly of\r\nonly one administration at a time, and of that only after it has closed,\r\nand some one who knows its secrets has come forward to tell them. We\r\nthink of Mr. Lincoln rather than of his Secretaries when we look back to\r\nthe policy of the war-time; but we think of Mr. Hamilton rather than of\r\nPresident Washington when we look back to the policy of the first\r\nadministration. Daniel Webster was bigger than President Fillmore, and\r\nPresident Jackson was bigger than Mr. Secretary Van Buren. It depends\r\nfor the most part upon the character and training, the previous station,\r\nof the cabinet officers, whether or not they act as governing factors in\r\nadministration, just as it depends upon the President's talents and\r\npreparatory schooling whether or not he is a mere figure-head. A weak\r\nPresident may prove himself wiser than the convention which nominated\r\nhim, by overshadowing himself with a Cabinet of notables.\r\n\r\nFrom the necessity of the case, however, the President cannot often be\r\nreally supreme in matters of administration, except as the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives is supreme in legislation, as appointer of\r\nthose who are supreme in its several departments. The President is no\r\ngreater than his prerogative of veto makes him; he is, in other words,\r\npowerful rather as a branch of the legislature than as the titular head\r\nof the Executive. Almost all distinctively executive functions are\r\nspecifically bestowed upon the heads of the departments. No President,\r\nhowever earnest and industrious, can keep the Navy in a state of\r\ncreditable efficiency if he have a corrupt or incapable Secretary in the\r\nNavy Department; he cannot prevent the army from suffering the damage of\r\ndemoralization if the Secretary of War is without either ability,\r\nexperience, or conscience; there will be corrupt jobs in the Department\r\nof Justice, do what he will to correct the methods of a deceived or\r\ndeceitful Attorney-General; he cannot secure even-handed equity for the\r\nIndian tribes if the Secretary of the Interior chooses to thwart him;\r\nand the Secretary of State may do as much mischief behind his back as\r\ncan the Secretary of the Treasury. He might master the details and so\r\ncontrol the administration of some one of the departments, but he can\r\nscarcely oversee them all with any degree of strictness. His knowledge\r\nof what they have done or are doing comes, of course, from the\r\nSecretaries themselves, and his annual messages to Congress are in\r\nlarge part but a recapitulation of the chief contents of the detailed\r\nreports which the heads of the departments themselves submit at the same\r\ntime to the Houses.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, however, to exaggerate the power of the Cabinet. After all\r\nhas been said, it is evident that they differ from the permanent\r\nofficials only in not being permanent. Their tenure of office is made to\r\ndepend upon the supposition that their functions are political rather\r\nthan simply ministerial, independent rather than merely instrumental.\r\nThey are made party representatives because of the fiction that they\r\ndirect policy. In reality the First Comptroller of the Treasury has\r\nalmost, if not quite, as much weight in directing departmental business\r\nas has the Secretary of the Treasury himself, and it would practically\r\nbe quite as useful to have his office, which is in intention permanent,\r\nvacated by every change of administration as to have that rule with\r\nregard to the office of his official chief. The permanent organization,\r\nthe clerical forces of the departments, have in the Secretaries a sort\r\nof _sliding top_; though it would probably be just as convenient in\r\npractice to have this lid permanent as to have it movable. That the\r\nSecretaries are not in fact the directors of the executive policy of the\r\ngovernment, I have shown in pointing out the thorough-going supervision\r\nof even the details of administration which it is the disposition of the\r\nStanding Committees of Congress to exercise. In the actual control of\r\naffairs no one can do very much without gaining the ears of the\r\nCommittees. The heads of the departments could, of course, act much more\r\nwisely in many matters than the Committees can, because they have an\r\nintimacy with the workings and the wants of those departments which no\r\nCommittee can possibly possess. But Committees prefer to govern in the\r\ndark rather than not to govern at all, and the Secretaries, as a matter\r\nof fact, find themselves bound in all things larger than routine details\r\nby laws which have been made for them and which they have no legitimate\r\nmeans of modifying.\r\n\r\nOf course the Secretaries are in the leading-strings of statutes, and\r\nall their duties look towards a strict obedience to Congress. Congress\r\nmade them and can unmake them. It is to Congress that they must render\r\naccount for the conduct of administration. The head of each department\r\nmust every year make a detailed report of the expenditures of the\r\ndepartment, and a minute account of the facilities of work and the\r\ndivision of functions in the department, naming each clerk of its force.\r\nThe chief duties of one cabinet officer will serve to illustrate the\r\nchief duties of his colleagues. It is the duty of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury[51] \"to prepare plans for the improvement and management of the\r\nrevenue and for the support of the public credit; to prescribe forms of\r\nkeeping and rendering all public accounts; to grant all warrants for\r\nmoneys to be issued from the Treasury in pursuance of appropriations\r\nmade by Congress; to report to the Senate or House, in person or in\r\nwriting, information required by them pertaining to his office; and to\r\nperform all duties relating to finance that he shall be directed to\r\nperform.\" \"He is required to report to Congress annually, on the first\r\nMonday in June, the results of the information compiled by the Bureau of\r\nStatistics, showing the condition of manufactures, domestic trade,\r\ncurrency, and banks in the several States and Territories.\" \"He\r\nprescribes regulations for the killing in Alaska Territory and adjacent\r\nwaters of minks, martens, sable, and other fur-bearing animals.\" \"And he\r\nmust lay before Congress each session the reports of the Auditors,\r\nshowing the applications of the appropriations made for the War and Navy\r\nDepartments, and also abstracts and tabulated forms showing separate\r\naccounts of the moneys received from internal duties.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it is of the utmost importance that a Secretary who has\r\nwithin his choice some of the minor plans for the management of the\r\nrevenue and for the maintenance of the public credit should be carefully\r\nchosen from amongst men skilled in financial administration and\r\nexperienced in business regulation; but it is no more necessary that the\r\nman selected for such responsible duties should be an active politician,\r\ncalled to preside over his department only so long as the President who\r\nappointed him continues to hold office and to like him, than it is to\r\nhave a strictly political officer to fulfill his other duty of\r\nprescribing game laws for Alaska and Alaskan waters. Fur-bearing animals\r\ncan have no connection with political parties,--except, perhaps, as\r\n\"spoils.\" Indeed, it is a positive disadvantage that Mr. Secretary\r\nshould be chosen upon such a principle. He cannot have the knowledge,\r\nand must therefore lack the efficiency, of a permanent official\r\nseparated from the partisan conflicts of politics and advanced to the\r\nhighest office of his department by a regular series of promotions won\r\nby long service. The general policy of the government in matters of\r\nfinance, everything that affects the greater operations of the Treasury,\r\ndepends upon legislation, and is altogether in the hands of the\r\nCommittees of Ways and Means and of Finance; so that it is entirely\r\napart from good sense to make an essentially political office out of\r\nthe post of that officer who controls only administrative details.\r\n\r\nAnd this remark would seem to apply with still greater force to the\r\noffices of the other Secretaries. They have even lass energetic scope\r\nthan the Secretary of the Treasury has. There must under any system be\r\nconsiderable power in the hands of the officer who handles and dispenses\r\nvast revenues, even though he handle and dispense them as directed by\r\nhis employers. Money in its goings to and fro makes various mares go by\r\nthe way, so to speak. It cannot move in great quantities without moving\r\na large part of the commercial world with it. Management even of\r\nfinancial details may be made instrumental in turning the money-markets\r\nupside down. The Secretary of the Treasury is, therefore, less a mere\r\nchief clerk than are his coadjutors; and if his duties are not properly\r\npolitical, theirs certainly are not.\r\n\r\nIn view of this peculiarity of the Secretaries, in being appointed as\r\npartisans and endowed as mere officials, it is interesting to inquire\r\nwhat and whom they represent. They are clearly meant to represent the\r\npolitical party to which they belong; but it very often happens that it\r\nis impossible for them to do so. They must sometimes obey the opposite\r\nparty. It is our habit to speak of the party to which the President is\r\nknown to adhere and which has control of appointments to the offices of\r\nthe civil service as \"the party in power;\" but it is very evident that\r\ncontrol of the executive machinery is not all or even a very large part\r\nof power in a country ruled as ours is. In so far as the President is an\r\nexecutive officer he is the servant of Congress; and the members of the\r\nCabinet, being confined to executive functions, are altogether the\r\nservants of Congress. The President, however, besides being titular head\r\nof the executive service, is to the extent of his veto a third branch of\r\nthe legislature, and the party which he represents is in power in the\r\nsame sense that it would be in power if it had on its side a majority of\r\nthe members of either of the other two branches of Congress. If the\r\nHouse and Senate are of one party and the President and his ministers of\r\nthe opposite, the President's party can hardly be said to be in power\r\nbeyond the hindering and thwarting faculty of the veto. The Democrats\r\nwere in power during the sessions of the Twenty-fifth Congress because\r\nthey had a majority in the Senate as well as Andrew Jackson in the White\r\nHouse; but later Presidents have had both House and Senate against\r\nthem.[52]\r\n\r\nIt is this constant possibility of party diversity between the Executive\r\nand Congress which so much complicates our system of party government.\r\nThe history of administrations is not necessarily the history of\r\nparties. Presidential elections may turn the scale of party ascendency\r\none way, and the intermediate congressional elections may quite reverse\r\nthe balance. A strong party administration, by which the energy of the\r\nState is concentrated in the hands of a single well-recognized political\r\norganization, which is by reason of its power saddled with all\r\nresponsibility, may sometimes be possible, but it must often be\r\nimpossible. We are thus shut out in part from real party government such\r\nas we desire, and such as it is unquestionably desirable to set up in\r\nevery system like ours. Party government can exist only when the\r\nabsolute control of administration, the appointment of its officers as\r\nwell as the direction of its means and policy, is given immediately\r\ninto the hands of that branch of the government whose power is\r\nparamount, the representative body. Roger Sherman, whose perception was\r\namongst the keenest and whose sagacity was amongst the surest in the\r\ngreat Convention of 1787, was very bold and outspoken in declaring this\r\nfact and in proposing to give it candid recognition. Perceiving very\r\nclearly the omnipotence which must inevitably belong to a national\r\nCongress such as the convention was about to create, he avowed that \"he\r\nconsidered the executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution\r\nfor carrying the will of the legislature into effect; that the person or\r\npersons [who should constitute the executive] ought to be appointed by,\r\nand accountable to, the legislature only, which was the depository of\r\nthe supreme will of the society.\" Indeed, the executive was in his view\r\nso entirely the servant of the legislative will that he saw good reason\r\nto think that the legislature should judge of the number of persons of\r\nwhich the executive should be composed; and there seem to have been\r\nothers in the convention who went along with him in substantial\r\nagreement as to these matters. It would seem to have been only a desire\r\nfor the creation of as many as possible of those balances of power which\r\nnow decorate the \"literary theory\" of the Constitution which they made\r\nthat prevented a universal acquiescence in these views.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly which has resulted is seen most clearly in the party\r\nrelations of the President and his Cabinet. The President is a\r\npartisan,--is elected because he is a partisan,--and yet he not\r\ninfrequently negatives the legislation passed by the party whom he\r\nrepresents; and it may be said to be nowadays a very rare thing to find\r\na Cabinet made up of truly representative party men. They are the men of\r\nhis party whom the President likes, but not necessarily or always the\r\nmen whom that party relishes. So low, indeed, has the reputation of some\r\nof our later Cabinets fallen, even in the eyes of men of their own\r\npolitical connection, that writers in the best of our public prints feel\r\nat full liberty to speak of their members with open contempt. \"When\r\nMr.---- was made Secretary of the Navy,\" laughs the New York \"Nation,\"\r\n\"no one doubted that he would treat the Department as 'spoils,' and\r\nconsequently nobody has been disappointed. He is one of the statesmen\r\nwho can hardly conceive of a branch of the public Administration having\r\nno spoils in it.\" And that this separation of the Cabinet from real\r\nparty influence, and from the party leadership which would seem properly\r\nto belong to its official station, is a natural result of our\r\nconstitutional scheme is made patent in the fact that the Cabinet has\r\nadvanced in party insignificance as the system has grown older. The\r\nconnection between the early Cabinets and the early Congresses was very\r\nlike the relations between leaders and their party. Both Hamilton and\r\nGallatin led rather than obeyed the Houses; and it was many years before\r\nthe suggestions of heads of departments ceased to be sure of respectful\r\nand acquiescent consideration from the legislative Committees. But as\r\nthe Committees gained facility and power the leadership of the Cabinet\r\nlost ground. Congress took command of the government so soon as ever it\r\ngot command of itself, and no Secretary of to-day can claim by virtue of\r\nhis office recognition as a party authority. Congress looks upon advice\r\noffered to it by anybody but its own members as gratuitous impertinence.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is quite evident that the means which Congress has\r\nof controlling the departments and of exercising the searching oversight\r\nat which it aims are limited and defective. Its intercourse with the\r\nPresident is restricted to the executive messages, and its intercourse\r\nwith the departments has no easier channels than private consultations\r\nbetween executive officials and the Committees, informal interviews of\r\nthe ministers with individual members of Congress, and the written\r\ncorrespondence which the cabinet officers from time to time address to\r\nthe presiding officers of the two Houses, at stated intervals, or in\r\nresponse to formal resolutions of inquiry. Congress stands almost\r\nhelplessly outside of the departments. Even the special, irksome,\r\nungracious investigations which it from time to time institutes in its\r\nspasmodic endeavors to dispel or confirm suspicions of malfeasance or of\r\nwanton corruption do not afford it more than a glimpse of the inside of\r\na small province of federal administration. Hostile or designing\r\nofficials can always hold it at arm's length by dexterous evasions and\r\nconcealments. It can violently disturb, but it cannot often fathom, the\r\nwaters of the sea in which the bigger fish of the civil service swim and\r\nfeed. Its dragnet stirs without cleansing the bottom. Unless it have at\r\nthe head of the departments capable, fearless men, altogether in its\r\nconfidence and entirely in sympathy with its designs, it is clearly\r\nhelpless to do more than affright those officials whose consciences are\r\ntheir accusers.\r\n\r\nAnd it is easy to see how the commands as well as the questions of\r\nCongress may be evaded, if not directly disobeyed, by the executive\r\nagents. Its Committees may command, but they cannot superintend the\r\nexecution of their commands. The Secretaries, though not free enough to\r\nhave any independent policy of their own, are free enough to be very\r\npoor, because very unmanageable, servants. Once installed, their hold\r\nupon their offices does not depend upon the will of Congress. If they\r\nplease the President, and keep upon living terms with their colleagues,\r\nthey need not seriously regard the displeasure of the Houses, unless,\r\nindeed, by actual crime, they rashly put themselves in the way of its\r\njudicial wrath. If their folly be not too overt and extravagant, their\r\nauthority may continue theirs till the earth has four times made her\r\nannual journey round the sun. They may make daily blunders in\r\nadministration and repeated mistakes in business, may thwart the plans\r\nof Congress in a hundred small, vexatious ways, and yet all the while\r\nsnap their fingers at its dissatisfaction or displeasure. They are\r\ndenied the gratification of possessing real power, but they have the\r\nsatisfaction of being secure in a petty independence which gives them a\r\nchance to be tricky and scheming. There are ways and ways of obeying;\r\nand if Congress be not pleased, why need they care? Congress did not\r\ngive them their places, and cannot easily take them away.\r\n\r\nStill it remains true that all the big affairs of the departments are\r\nconducted in obedience to the direction of the Standing Committees. The\r\nPresident nominates, and with legislative approval appoints, to the more\r\nimportant offices of the government, and the members of the Cabinet\r\nhave the privilege of advising him as to matters in most of which he has\r\nno power of final action without the concurrence of the Senate; but the\r\ngist of all policy is decided by legislative, not by executive, will. It\r\ncan be no great satisfaction to any man to possess the barren privilege\r\nof suggesting the best means of managing the every-day routine business\r\nof the several bureaux so long as the larger plans which that business\r\nis meant to advance are made for him by others who are set over him. If\r\none is commanded to go to this place or to that place, and must go, will\r\nhe, nill he, it can be but small solace to him that he is left free to\r\ndetermine whether he will ride or walk in going the journey. The only\r\nserious questions are whether or not this so great and real control\r\nexerted by Congress can be exercised efficiently and with sufficient\r\nresponsibility to those whom Congress represents, and whether good\r\ngovernment is promoted by the arrangement.\r\n\r\nNo one, I take it for granted, is disposed to disallow the principle\r\nthat the representatives of the people are the proper ultimate authority\r\nin all matters of government, and that administration is merely the\r\nclerical part of government. Legislation is the originating force. It\r\ndetermines what shall be done; and the President, if he cannot or will\r\nnot stay legislation by the use of his extraordinary power as a branch\r\nof the legislature, is plainly bound in duty to render unquestioning\r\nobedience to Congress. And if it be his duty to obey, still more is\r\nobedience the bounden duty of his subordinates. The power of making laws\r\nis in its very nature and essence the power of directing, and that power\r\nis given to Congress. The principle is without drawback, and is\r\ninseparably of a piece with all Anglo-Saxon usage; the difficulty, if\r\nthere be any, must lie in the choice of means whereby to energize the\r\nprinciple. The natural means would seem to be the right on the part of\r\nthe representative body to have all the executive servants of its will\r\nunder its close and constant supervision, and to hold them to a strict\r\naccountability: in other words, to have the privilege of dismissing them\r\nwhenever their service became unsatisfactory. This is the\r\nmatter-of-course privilege of every other master; and if Congress does\r\nnot possess it, its mastery is hampered without being denied. The\r\nexecutive officials are its servants all the same; the only difference\r\nis that if they prove negligent, or incapable, or deceitful servants\r\nCongress must rest content with the best that can be got out of them\r\nuntil its chief administrative agent, the President, chooses to appoint\r\nbetter. It cannot make them docile, though it may compel them to be\r\nobedient in all greater matters. In authority of rule Congress is made\r\nmaster, but in means of rule it is made mere magistrate. It commands\r\nwith absolute lordship, but it can discipline for disobedience only by\r\nslow and formal judicial process.\r\n\r\nUpon Machiavelli's declaration that \"nothing is more important to the\r\nstability of the state than that facility should be given by its\r\nconstitution for the accusation of those who are supposed to have\r\ncommitted any public wrong,\" a writer in the \"Westminster Review\" makes\r\nthis thoughtful comment: \"The benefit of such a provision is twofold.\r\nFirst, the salutary fear of the probable coming of a day of account will\r\nrestrain the evil practices of some bad men and self-seekers; secondly,\r\nthe legal outlet of accusation gives vent to peccant humors in the body\r\npolitic, which, if checked and driven inward, would work to the utter\r\nruin of the constitution; ... the distinction is lost between accusation\r\nand calumny.\"[53] And of course it was these benefits which our federal\r\nConstitution was meant to secure by means of its machinery of\r\nimpeachment. No servant of the state, not even the President himself,\r\nwas to be beyond the reach of accusation by the House of Representatives\r\nand of trial by the Senate. But the processes of impeachment, like\r\nthose of amendment, are ponderous and difficult to handle. It requires\r\nsomething like passion to set them a-going; and nothing short of the\r\ngrossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give\r\nthem speed and effectiveness. Indignation so great as to overcrow party\r\ninterest may secure a conviction; nothing less can. Indeed, judging by\r\nour past experiences, impeachment may be said to be little more than an\r\nempty menace. The House of Representatives is a tardy grand jury, and\r\nthe Senate an uncertain court.\r\n\r\nBesides, great crimes such as might speed even impeachment are not\r\nordinary things in the loosest public service. An open-eyed public\r\nopinion can generally give them effective check. That which usually and\r\nevery day clogs and hampers good government is folly or incapacity on\r\nthe part of the ministers of state. Even more necessary, therefore, than\r\na power clothed with authority to accuse, try, and punish for public\r\ncrime is some ultimate authority, whose privilege it shall be to dismiss\r\nfor inefficiency. Impeachment is aimed altogether above the head of\r\nbusiness management. A merchant would not think it fair, even if it were\r\nlawful, to shoot a clerk who could not learn the business. Dismissal is\r\nquite as effective for his purposes, and more merciful to the clerk. The\r\ncrying inconvenience of our system is, therefore, that the\r\nconstitutional authority whose prerogative it is to direct policy and\r\noversee administration has fewer facilities for getting its work well\r\ndone than has the humblest citizen for obtaining satisfactory aid in his\r\nown undertakings. The authority most interested in appointments and\r\ndismissals in the civil service has little to do with the one and less\r\nto do with the other. The President appoints with the sanction of the\r\nSenate, and cannot dismiss his advisers without legislative consent;[54]\r\nyet the ministers in reality serve, not the President, but Congress, and\r\nCongress can neither appoint nor dismiss. In other words, the President\r\nmust in both acts take the initiative, though he is not the real master;\r\nand Congress, which is the real master, has in these vital matters only\r\na consultative voice, which it may utter, through its upper chamber,\r\nonly when its opinion is asked. I should regard my business as a\r\nhopeless undertaking if my chief agent had to be appointed by a third\r\nparty, and, besides being himself put beyond my power of control, were\r\ncharged with the choice and discipline of all his subordinates, subject\r\nnot to my directions, but simply to my acquiescence!\r\n\r\nThe relations existing between Congress and the departments must be\r\nfatally demoralizing to both. There is and can be between them nothing\r\nlike confidential and thorough cooperation. The departments may be\r\nexcused for that attitude of hostility which they sometimes assume\r\ntowards Congress, because it is quite human for the servant to fear and\r\ndeceive the master whom he does not regard as his friend, but suspects\r\nof being a distrustful spy of his movements. Congress cannot control the\r\nofficers of the executive without disgracing them. Its only whip is\r\ninvestigation, semi-judicial examination into corners suspected to be\r\ndirty. It must draw the public eye by openly avowing a suspicion of\r\nmalfeasance, and must then magnify and intensify the scandal by setting\r\nits Committees to cross-examining scared subordinates and sulky\r\nministers. And after all is over and the murder out, probably nothing is\r\ndone. The offenders, if any one has offended, often remain in office,\r\nshamed before the world, and ruined in the estimation of all honest\r\npeople, but still drawing their salaries and comfortably waiting for the\r\nshort memory of the public mind to forget them. Why unearth the carcass\r\nif you cannot remove it?\r\n\r\nThen, too, the departments frequently complain of the incessant\r\nexactions made upon them by Congress. They grumble that they are kept\r\nbusy in satisfying its curiosity and in meeting the demands of its\r\nuneasy activity. The clerks have ordinarily as much as they can do in\r\nkeeping afoot the usual routine business of their departments; but\r\nCongress is continually calling upon them for information which must be\r\nlaboriously collected from all sorts of sources, remote and accessible.\r\nA great speech in the Senate may cost them hours of anxious toil: for\r\nthe Senator who makes it is quite likely beforehand to introduce a\r\nresolution calling upon one of the Secretaries for full statistics with\r\nreference to this, that, or the other topic upon which he desires to\r\nspeak. If it be finance, he must have comparative tables of taxation; if\r\nit be commerce or the tariff, he cannot dispense with any of the\r\nminutest figures of the Treasury accounts; whatever be his theme, he\r\ncannot lay his foundations more surely than upon official information,\r\nand the Senate is usually unhesitatingly ready with an easy assent to\r\nthe resolution which puts the whole clerical force of the administration\r\nat his service. And of course the House too asks innumerable questions,\r\nwhich patient clerks and protesting Secretaries must answer to the last\r\nand most minute particular. This is what the departmental officials\r\ntestily call the tyranny of Congress, and no impartial third person can\r\nreasonably forbid them the use of the word.\r\n\r\nI know of few things harder to state clearly and within reasonable\r\ncompass than just how the nation keeps control of policy in spite of\r\nthese hide-and-seek vagaries of authority. Indeed, it is doubtful if it\r\ndoes keep control through all the roundabout paths which legislative and\r\nexecutive responsibility are permitted to take. It must follow Congress\r\nsomewhat blindly; Congress is known to obey without altogether\r\nunderstanding its Committees: and the Committees must consign the\r\nexecution of their plans to officials who have opportunities not a few\r\nto hoodwink them. At the end of these blind processes is it probable\r\nthat the ultimate authority, the people, is quite clear in its mind as\r\nto what has been done or what may be done another time? Take, for\r\nexample, financial policy,--a very fair example, because, as I have\r\nshown, the legislative stages of financial policy are more talked about\r\nthan any other congressional business, though for that reason an extreme\r\nexample. If, after appropriations and adjustments of taxation have been\r\ntardily and in much tribulation of scheming and argument agreed upon by\r\nthe House, the imperative suggestions and stubborn insistence of the\r\nSenate confuse matters till hardly the Conference Committees themselves\r\nknow clearly what the outcome of the disagreements has been; and if,\r\nwhen these compromise measures are launched as laws, the method of their\r\nexecution is beyond the view of the Houses, in the semi-privacy of the\r\ndepartments, how is the comprehension--not to speak of the will--of the\r\npeople to keep any sort of hold upon the course of affairs? There are no\r\nscrews of responsibility which they can turn upon the consciences or\r\nupon the official thumbs of the congressional Committees principally\r\nconcerned. Congressional Committees are nothing to the nation: they are\r\nonly pieces of the interior mechanism of Congress. To Congress they\r\nstand or fall. And, since Congress itself can scarcely be sure of having\r\nits own way with them, the constituencies are manifestly unlikely to be\r\nable to govern them. As for the departments, the people can hardly do\r\nmore in drilling them to unquestioning obedience and docile efficiency\r\nthan Congress can. Congress is, and must be, in these matters the\r\nnation's eyes and voice. If it cannot see what goes wrong and cannot get\r\nitself heeded when it commands, the nation likewise is both blind and\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\nThis, plainly put, is the practical result of the piecing of authority,\r\nthe cutting of it up into small bits, which is contrived in our\r\nconstitutional system. Each branch of the government is fitted out with\r\na small section of responsibility, whose limited opportunities afford to\r\nthe conscience of each many easy escapes. Every suspected culprit may\r\nshift the responsibility upon his fellows. Is Congress rated for\r\ncorrupt or imperfect or foolish legislation? It may urge that it has to\r\nfollow hastily its Committees or do nothing at all but talk; how can it\r\nhelp it if a stupid Committee leads it unawares into unjust or fatuous\r\nenterprises? Does administration blunder and run itself into all sorts\r\nof straits? The Secretaries hasten to plead the unreasonable or unwise\r\ncommands of Congress, and Congress falls to blaming the Secretaries. The\r\nSecretaries aver that the whole mischief might have been avoided if they\r\nhad only been allowed to suggest the proper measures; and the men who\r\nframed the existing measures in their turn avow their despair of good\r\ngovernment so long as they must intrust all their plans to the bungling\r\nincompetence of men who are appointed by and responsible to somebody\r\nelse. How is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the\r\nwhipping?\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is impossible to deny that this division of authority and\r\nconcealment of responsibility are calculated to subject the government\r\nto a very distressing paralysis in moments of emergency. There are few,\r\nif any, important steps that can be taken by any one branch of the\r\ngovernment without the consent or cooperation of some other branch.\r\nCongress must act through the President and his Cabinet; the President\r\nand his Cabinet must wait upon the will of Congress. There is no one\r\nsupreme, ultimate head--whether magistrate or representative body--which\r\ncan decide at once and with conclusive authority what shall be done at\r\nthose times when some decision there must be, and that immediately. Of\r\ncourse this lack is of a sort to be felt at all times, in seasons of\r\ntranquil rounds of business as well as at moments of sharp crisis; but\r\nin times of sudden exigency it might prove fatal,--fatal either in\r\nbreaking down the system or in failing to meet the emergency.[55] Policy\r\ncannot be either prompt or straightforward when it must serve many\r\nmasters. It must either equivocate, or hesitate, or fail altogether. It\r\nmay set out with clear purpose from Congress, but get waylaid or maimed\r\nby the Executive.\r\n\r\nIf there be one principle clearer than another, it is this: that in any\r\nbusiness, whether of government or of mere merchandising, _somebody must\r\nbe trusted_, in order that when things go wrong it may be quite plain\r\nwho should be punished. In order to drive trade at the speed and with\r\nthe success you desire, you must confide without suspicion in your chief\r\nclerk, giving him the power to ruin you, because you thereby furnish\r\nhim with a motive for serving you. His reputation, his own honor or\r\ndisgrace, all his own commercial prospects, hang upon your success. And\r\nhuman nature is much the same in government as in the dry-goods trade.\r\n_Power and strict accountability for its use_ are the essential\r\nconstituents of good government. A sense of highest responsibility, a\r\ndignifying and elevating sense of being trusted, together with a\r\nconsciousness of being in an official station so conspicuous that no\r\nfaithful discharge of duty can go unacknowledged and unrewarded, and no\r\nbreach of trust undiscovered and unpunished,--these are the influences,\r\nthe only influences, which foster practical, energetic, and trustworthy\r\nstatesmanship. The best rulers are always those to whom great power is\r\nintrusted in such a manner as to make them feel that they will surely be\r\nabundantly honored and recompensed for a just and patriotic use of it,\r\nand to make them know that nothing can shield them from full retribution\r\nfor every abuse of it.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, manifestly a radical defect in our federal system that\r\nit parcels out power and confuses responsibility as it does. The main\r\npurpose of the Convention of 1787 seems to have been to accomplish this\r\ngrievous mistake. The \"literary theory\" of checks and balances is\r\nsimply a consistent account of what our constitution-makers tried to\r\ndo; and those checks and balances have proved mischievous just to the\r\nextent to which they have succeeded in establishing themselves as\r\nrealities. It is quite safe to say that were it possible to call\r\ntogether again the members of that wonderful Convention to view the work\r\nof their hands in the light of the century that has tested it, they\r\nwould be the first to admit that the only fruit of dividing power had\r\nbeen to make it irresponsible. It is just this that has made civil\r\nservice reform tarry in this country and that makes it still almost\r\ndoubtful of issue. We are in just the case that England was in before\r\nshe achieved the reform for which we are striving. The date of the\r\nreform in England is no less significant than the fact. It was not\r\naccomplished until a distinct responsibility of the Ministers of the\r\nCrown to one, and to only one, master had been established beyond all\r\nuncertainty. This is the most striking and suggestive lesson to be\r\ngathered from Mr. Eaton's interesting and valuable history of Civil\r\nService in Great Britain. The Reform was originated in 1853 by the\r\nCabinet of Lord Aberdeen. It sprang from the suggestion of the\r\nappointing officers, and was carried through in the face of opposition\r\nfrom the House of Commons, because, paradoxically enough, the Ministry\r\nhad at last come to feel their responsibility to the Commons, or rather\r\nto the nation whom the Commons represented.\r\n\r\nThose great improvements which have been made in the public service of\r\nthe British empire since the days of Walpole and Newcastle have gone\r\nhand in hand with the perfecting of the system now known as responsible\r\nCabinet government. That system was slow in coming to perfection. It was\r\nnot till long after Walpole's day that unity of responsibility on the\r\npart of the Cabinet--and that singleness of responsibility which made\r\nthem look only to the Commons for authority--came to be recognized as an\r\nestablished constitutional principle. \"As a consequence of the earlier\r\npractice of constructing Cabinets of men of different political views,\r\nit followed that the members of such Cabinets did not and could not\r\nregard their responsibility to Parliament as one and indivisible. The\r\nresignation of an important member, or even of the Prime Minister, was\r\nnot regarded as necessitating the simultaneous retirement of his\r\ncolleagues. Even so late as the fall of Sir Robert Walpole, fifty years\r\nafter the Revolution Settlement (and itself the first instance of\r\nresignation in deference to a hostile parliamentary vote) we find the\r\nKing requesting Walpole's successor, Pulteney, 'not to distress the\r\nGovernment by making too many changes in the midst of a session;' and\r\nPulteney replying that he would be satisfied, provided 'the main forts\r\nof the Government,' or, in other words, the principal offices of state,\r\nwere placed in his hands. It was not till the displacement of Lord\r\nNorth's ministry by that of Lord Rockingham in 1782 that a whole\r\nadministration, with the exception of the Lord Chancellor, was changed\r\nby a vote of want of confidence passed in the House of Commons.\r\nThenceforth, however, the resignation of the head of a Government in\r\ndeference to an adverse vote of the popular chamber has invariably been\r\naccompanied by the resignation of all his colleagues.\"[56] But, even\r\nafter the establishment of that precedent, it was still many years\r\nbefore Cabinets were free to please none but the Commons,--free to\r\nfollow their own policies without authoritative suggestion from the\r\nsovereign. Until the death of the fourth George they were made to feel\r\nthat they owed a double allegiance: to the Commons and to the King. The\r\ncomposition of Ministries still depended largely on the royal whim, and\r\ntheir actions were hampered by the necessity of steering a careful\r\nmiddle course between the displeasure of parliament and the ill-will of\r\nHis Majesty. The present century had run far on towards the reign of\r\nVictoria before they were free to pay undivided obedience to the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. When once they had become responsible to\r\nthe Commons alone, however, and almost as soon as they were assured of\r\ntheir new position as the servants of the nation, they were prompted to\r\neven hazardous efforts for the reform of the civil service. They were\r\nconscious that the entire weight and responsibility of government rested\r\nupon their shoulders, and, as men regardful of the interests of the\r\nparty which they represented, jealous for the preservation of their own\r\nfair names, and anxious, consequently, for the promotion of wise rule,\r\nthey were naturally and of course the first to advocate a better system\r\nof appointment to that service whose chiefs they were recognized to be.\r\nThey were prompt to declare that it was the \"duty of the executive to\r\nprovide for the efficient and harmonious working of the civil service,\"\r\nand that they could not \"transfer that duty to any other body far less\r\ncompetent than themselves without infringing a great and important\r\nconstitutional principle, already too often infringed, to the great\r\ndetriment of the public service.\" They therefore determined themselves\r\nto inaugurate the merit-system without waiting for the assent of\r\nparliament, by simply surrendering their power of appointment in the\r\nvarious departments to a non-partisan examining board, trusting to the\r\npower of public opinion to induce parliament, after the thing had been\r\ndone, to vote sufficient money to put the scheme into successful\r\noperation. And they did not reckon without their host. Reluctant as the\r\nmembers of the House of Commons were to resign that control of the\r\nnational patronage which they had from time immemorial been accustomed\r\nto exercise by means of various crooked indirections, and which it had\r\nbeen their pleasure and their power to possess, they had not the face to\r\navow their suspicious unwillingness in answer to the honorable call of a\r\ntrusted Ministry who were supported in their demand by all that was\r\nhonest in public sentiment, and the world was afforded the gratifying\r\nbut unwonted spectacle of party leaders sacrificing to the cause of good\r\ngovernment, freely and altogether of their own accord, the \"spoils\" of\r\noffice so long dear to the party and to the assembly which they\r\nrepresented and served.\r\n\r\nIn this country the course of the reform was quite the reverse. Neither\r\nthe Executive nor Congress began it. The call for it came imperatively\r\nfrom the people; it was a formulated demand of public opinion made upon\r\nCongress, and it had to be made again and again, each time with more\r\ndetermined emphasis, before Congress heeded. It worked its way up from\r\nthe convictions of the many to the purposes of the few. Amongst the\r\nchief difficulties that have stood in its way, and which still block its\r\nperfect realization, is that peculiarity of structure which I have just\r\nnow pointed out as intrinsic in the scheme of divided power which runs\r\nthrough the Constitution. One of the conditions precedent to any real\r\nand lasting reform of the civil service, in a country whose public\r\nservice is moulded by the conditions of self-government, is the drawing\r\nof a sharp line of distinction between those offices which are political\r\nand those which are _non_-political. The strictest rules of business\r\ndiscipline, of merit-tenure and earned promotion, must rule every office\r\nwhose incumbent has naught to do with choosing between policies; but no\r\nrules except the choice of parties can or should make and unmake, reward\r\nor punish, those officers whose privilege it is to fix upon the\r\npolitical purposes which administration shall be made to serve. These\r\nlatter are not many under any form of government. There are said to be\r\nbut fifty such at most in the civil service of Great Britain; but these\r\nfifty go in or out as the balance of power shifts from party to party.\r\nIn the case of our own civil service it would, I take it, be extremely\r\nhard to determine where the line should be drawn. In all the higher\r\ngrades this particular distinction is quite obscured. A doubt exists as\r\nto the Cabinet itself. Are the Secretaries political or non-political\r\nofficers? It would seem that they are exclusively neither. They are at\r\nleast semi-political. They are, on the one hand, merely the servants of\r\nCongress, and yet, on the other hand, they have enough freedom of\r\ndiscretion to mar and color, if not to choose, political ends. They can\r\nwreck plans, if they cannot make them. Should they be made permanent\r\nofficials because they are mere Secretaries, or should their tenure\r\ndepend upon the fortunes of parties because they have many chances to\r\nrender party services? And if the one rule or the other is to be applied\r\nto them, to how many, and to which of their chief subordinates, is it to\r\nbe extended? If they are not properly or necessarily party men, let them\r\npass the examinations and run the gauntlet of the usual tests of\r\nefficiency, let errand-boys work up to Secretary-ships; but if not, let\r\ntheir responsibility to their party be made strict and determinate. That\r\nis the cardinal point of practical civil service reform.\r\n\r\nThis doubt as to the exact _status_ in the system of the chief ministers\r\nof state is a most striking commentary on the system itself. Its\r\ncomplete self is logical and simple. But its complete self exists only\r\nin theory. Its real self offers a surprise and presents a mystery at\r\nevery change of view. The practical observer who seeks for facts and\r\nactual conditions of organization is often sorely puzzled to come at the\r\nreal methods of government. Pitfalls await him on every side. If\r\nconstitutional lawyers of strait-laced consciences filled Congress and\r\nofficered the departments, every clause of the Constitution would be\r\naccorded a formal obedience, and it would be as easy to know beforehand\r\njust what the government will be like inside to-morrow as it is now to\r\nknow what it was like outside yesterday. But neither the knowledge nor\r\nthe consciences of politicians keep them very close to the Constitution;\r\nand it is with politicians that we have to deal nowadays in studying the\r\ngovernment. Every government is largely what the men are who constitute\r\nit. If the character or opinions of legislators and administrators\r\nchange from time to time, the nature of the government changes with\r\nthem; and as both their characters and their opinions do change very\r\noften it is very hard to make a picture of the government which can be\r\nsaid to have been perfectly faithful yesterday, and can be confidently\r\nexpected to be exactly accurate to-morrow. Add to these embarrassments,\r\nwhich may be called the embarrassments of human nature, other\r\nembarrassments such as our system affords, the embarrassments of subtle\r\nlegal distinctions, a fine theoretical plan made in delicate hair-lines,\r\nrequirements of law which can hardly be met and can easily and naturally\r\nbe evaded or disregarded, and you have in full the conception of the\r\ndifficulties which attend a practical exposition of the real facts of\r\nfederal administration. It is not impossible to point out what the\r\nExecutive was intended to be, what it has sometimes been, or what it\r\nmight be; nor is it forbidden the diligent to discover the main\r\nconditions which mould it to the forms of congressional supremacy; but\r\nmore than this is not to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n     Political philosophy must analyze political history; it must\r\n     distinguish what is due to the excellence of the people, and what\r\n     to the excellence of the laws; it must carefully calculate the\r\n     exact effect of each part of the constitution, though thus it may\r\n     destroy many an idol of the multitude, and detect the secret of\r\n     utility where but few imagined it to lie.--BAGEHOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress always makes what haste it can to legislate. It is the prime\r\nobject of its rules to expedite law-making. Its customs are fruits of\r\nits characteristic diligence in enactment. Be the matters small or\r\ngreat, frivolous or grave, which busy it, its aim is to have laws always\r\na-making. Its temper is strenuously legislative. That it cannot regulate\r\nall the questions to which its attention is weekly invited is its\r\nmisfortune, not its fault; is due to the human limitation of its\r\nfaculties, not to any narrow circumscription of its desires. If its\r\ncommittee machinery is inadequate to the task of bringing to action more\r\nthan one out of every hundred of the bills introduced, it is not because\r\nthe quick clearance of the docket is not the motive of its organic\r\nlife. If legislation, therefore, were the only or the chief object for\r\nwhich it should live, it would not be possible to withhold admiration\r\nfrom those clever hurrying rules and those inexorable customs which seek\r\nto facilitate it. Nothing but a doubt as to whether or not Congress\r\nshould confine itself to law-making can challenge with a question the\r\nutility of its organization as a facile statute-devising machine.\r\n\r\nThe political philosopher of these days of self-government has, however,\r\nsomething more than a doubt with which to gainsay the usefulness of a\r\nsovereign representative body which confines itself to legislation to\r\nthe exclusion of all other functions. Buckle declared, indeed, that the\r\nchief use and value of legislation nowadays lay in its opportunity and\r\npower to remedy the mistakes of the legislation of the past; that it was\r\nbeneficent only when it carried healing in its wings; that repeal was\r\nmore blessed than enactment. And it is certainly true that the greater\r\npart of the labor of legislation consists in carrying the loads\r\nrecklessly or bravely shouldered in times gone by, when the animal which\r\nis now a bull was only a calf, and in completing, if they may be\r\ncompleted, the tasks once undertaken in the shape of unambitious schemes\r\nwhich at the outset looked innocent enough. Having got his foot into it,\r\nthe legislator finds it difficult, if not impossible, to get it out\r\nagain. \"The modern industrial organization, including banks,\r\ncorporations, joint-stock companies, financial devices, national debts,\r\npaper currency, national systems of taxation, is largely the creation of\r\nlegislation (not in its historical origin, but in the mode of its\r\nexistence and in its authority), and is largely regulated by\r\nlegislation. Capital is the breath of life to this organization, and\r\nevery day, as the organization becomes more complex and delicate, the\r\nfolly of assailing capital or credit becomes greater. At the same time\r\nit is evident that the task of the legislator to embrace in his view the\r\nwhole system, to adjust his rules so that the play of the civil\r\ninstitutions shall not alter the play of the economic forces, requires\r\nmore training and more acumen. Furthermore, the greater the complication\r\nand delicacy of the industrial system, the greater the chances for\r\ncupidity when backed by craft, and the task of the legislator to meet\r\nand defeat the attempts of this cupidity is one of constantly increasing\r\ndifficulty.\"[57]\r\n\r\nLegislation unquestionably generates legislation. Every statute may be\r\nsaid to have a long lineage of statutes behind it; and whether that\r\nlineage be honorable or of ill repute is as much a question as to each\r\nindividual statute as it can be with regard to the ancestry of each\r\nindividual legislator. Every statute in its turn has a numerous progeny,\r\nand only time and opportunity can decide whether its offspring will\r\nbring it honor or shame. Once begin the dance of legislation, and you\r\nmust struggle through its mazes as best you can to its breathless\r\nend,--if any end there be.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the enacting, revising, tinkering,\r\nrepealing of laws should engross the attention and engage the entire\r\nenergy of such a body as Congress. It is, however, easy to see how it\r\nmight be better employed; or, at least, how it might add others to this\r\novershadowing function, to the infinite advantage of the government.\r\nQuite as important as legislation is vigilant oversight of\r\nadministration; and even more important than legislation is the\r\ninstruction and guidance in political affairs which the people might\r\nreceive from a body which kept all national concerns suffused in a broad\r\ndaylight of discussion. There is no similar legislature in existence\r\nwhich is so shut up to the one business of law-making as is our\r\nCongress. As I have said, it in a way superintends administration by the\r\nexercise of semi-judicial powers of investigation, whose limitations and\r\ninsufficiency are manifest. But other national legislatures command\r\nadministration and verify their name of \"parliaments\" by talking\r\nofficial acts into notoriety. Our extra-constitutional party\r\nconventions, short-lived and poor in power as they are, constitute our\r\nonly machinery for that sort of control of the executive which consists\r\nin the award of personal rewards and punishments. This is the cardinal\r\nfact which differentiates Congress from the Chamber of Deputies and from\r\nParliament, and which puts it beyond the reach of those eminently useful\r\nfunctions whose exercise would so raise it in usefulness and in dignity.\r\n\r\nAn effective representative body, gifted with the power to rule, ought,\r\nit would seem, not only to speak the will of the nation, which Congress\r\ndoes, but also to lead it to its conclusions, to utter the voice of its\r\nopinions, and to serve as its eyes in superintending all matters of\r\ngovernment,--which Congress does not do. The discussions which take\r\nplace in Congress are aimed at random. They now and again strike rather\r\nsharply the tender spots in this, that, or the other measure; but, as I\r\nhave said, no two measures consciously join in purpose or agree in\r\ncharacter, and so debate must wander as widely as the subjects of\r\ndebate. Since there is little coherency about the legislation agreed\r\nupon, there can be little coherency about the debates. There is no one\r\npolicy to be attacked or defended, but only a score or two of separate\r\nbills. To attend to such discussions is uninteresting; to be instructed\r\nby them is impossible. There is some scandal and discomfort, but\r\ninfinite advantage, in having every affair of administration subjected\r\nto the test of constant examination on the part of the assembly which\r\nrepresents the nation. The chief use of such inquisition is, not the\r\ndirection of those affairs in a way with which the country will be\r\nsatisfied (though that itself is of course all-important), but the\r\nenlightenment of the people, which is always its sure consequence. Very\r\nfew men are unequal to a danger which they see and understand; all men\r\nquail before a threatening which is dark and unintelligible, and suspect\r\nwhat is done behind a screen. If the people could have, through\r\nCongress, daily knowledge of all the more important transactions of the\r\ngovernmental offices, an insight into all that now seems withheld and\r\nprivate, their confidence in the executive, now so often shaken, would,\r\nI think, be very soon established. Because dishonesty can lurk under the\r\nprivacies now vouchsafed our administrative agents, much that is\r\nupright and pure suffers unjust suspicion. Discoveries of guilt in a\r\nbureau cloud with doubts the trustworthiness of a department. As nothing\r\nis open enough for the quick and easy detection of peculation or fraud,\r\nso nothing is open enough for the due vindication and acknowledgment of\r\nhonesty. The isolation and privacy which shield the one from discovery\r\ncheat the other of reward.\r\n\r\nInquisitiveness is never so forward, enterprising, and irrepressible as\r\nin a popular assembly which is given leave to ask questions and is\r\nafforded ready and abundant means of getting its questions answered. No\r\ncross-examination is more searching than that to which a minister of the\r\nCrown is subjected by the all-curious Commons. \"Sir Robert Peel once\r\nasked to have a number of questions carefully written down which they\r\nasked him one day in succession in the House of Commons. They seemed a\r\nlist of everything that could occur in the British empire or to the\r\nbrain of a member of parliament.\"[58] If one considered only the wear\r\nand tear upon ministers of state, which the plague of constant\r\ninterrogation must inflict, he could wish that their lives, if useful,\r\nmight be spared this blight of unending explanation; but no one can\r\noverestimate the immense advantage of a facility so unlimited for\r\nknowing all that is going on in the places where authority lives. The\r\nconscience of every member of the representative body is at the service\r\nof the nation. All that he feels bound to know he can find out; and what\r\nhe finds out goes to the ears of the country. The question is his, the\r\nanswer the nation's. And the inquisitiveness of such bodies as Congress\r\nis the best conceivable source of information. Congress is the only body\r\nwhich has the proper motive for inquiry, and it is the only body which\r\nhas the power to act effectively upon the knowledge which its inquiries\r\nsecure. The Press is merely curious or merely partisan. The people are\r\nscattered and unorganized. But Congress is, as it were, the corporate\r\npeople, the mouthpiece of its will. It is a sovereign delegation which\r\ncould ask questions with dignity, because with authority and with power\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nCongress is fast becoming the governing body of the nation, and yet the\r\nonly power which it possesses in perfection is the power which is but a\r\npart of government, the power of legislation. Legislation is but the oil\r\nof government. It is that which lubricates its channels and speeds its\r\nwheels; that which lessens the friction and so eases the movement. Or\r\nperhaps I shall be admitted to have hit upon a closer and apter analogy\r\nif I say that legislation is like a foreman set over the forces of\r\ngovernment. It issues the orders which others obey. It directs, it\r\nadmonishes, but it does not do the actual heavy work of governing. A\r\ngood foreman does, it is true, himself take a hand in the work which he\r\nguides; and so I suppose our legislation must be likened to a poor\r\nforeman, because it stands altogether apart from that work which it is\r\nset to see well done. Members of Congress ought not to be censured too\r\nseverely, however, when they fail to check evil courses on the part of\r\nthe executive. They have been denied the means of doing so promptly and\r\nwith effect. Whatever intention may have controlled the compromises of\r\nconstitution-making in 1787, their result was to give us, not government\r\nby discussion, which is the only tolerable sort of government for a\r\npeople which tries to do its own governing, but only _legislation_ by\r\ndiscussion, which is no more than a small part of government by\r\ndiscussion. What is quite as indispensable as the debate of problems of\r\nlegislation is the debate of all matters of administration. It is even\r\nmore important to know how the house is being built than to know how the\r\nplans of the architect were conceived and how his specifications were\r\ncalculated. It is better to have skillful work--stout walls, reliable\r\narches, unbending rafters, and windows sure to \"expel the winter's\r\nflaw\"--than a drawing on paper which is the admiration of all the\r\npractical artists in the country. The discipline of an army depends\r\nquite as much upon the temper of the troops as upon the orders of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt is the proper duty of a representative body to look diligently into\r\nevery affair of government and to talk much about what it sees. It is\r\nmeant to be the eyes and the voice, and to embody the wisdom and will of\r\nits constituents. Unless Congress have and use every means of\r\nacquainting itself with the acts and the disposition of the\r\nadministrative agents of the government, the country must be helpless to\r\nlearn how it is being served; and unless Congress both scrutinize these\r\nthings and sift them by every form of discussion, the country must\r\nremain in embarrassing, crippling ignorance of the very affairs which it\r\nis most important that it should understand and direct. The informing\r\nfunction of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative\r\nfunction. The argument is not only that discussed and interrogated\r\nadministration is the only pure and efficient administration, but, more\r\nthan that, that the only really self-governing people is that people\r\nwhich discusses and interrogates its administration. The talk on the\r\npart of Congress which we sometimes justly condemn is the profitless\r\nsquabble of words over frivolous bills or selfish party issues. It would\r\nbe hard to conceive of there being too much talk about the practical\r\nconcerns and processes of government. Such talk it is which, when\r\nearnestly and purposefully conducted, clears the public mind and shapes\r\nthe demands of public opinion.\r\n\r\nCongress could not be too diligent about such talking; whereas it may\r\neasily be too diligent in legislation. It often overdoes that business.\r\nIt already sends to its Committees bills too many by the thousand to be\r\ngiven even a hasty thought; but its immense committee facilities and the\r\nabsence of all other duties but that of legislation make it omnivorous\r\nin its appetite for new subjects for consideration. It is greedy to have\r\na taste of every possible dish that may be put upon its table, as an\r\n\"extra\" to the constitutional bill of fare. This disposition on its part\r\nis the more notable because there is certainly less need for it to hurry\r\nand overwork itself at law-making than exists in the case of most other\r\ngreat national legislatures. It is not state and national legislature\r\ncombined, as are the Commons of England and the Chambers of France. Like\r\nthe Reichstag of our cousin Germans, it is restricted to subjects of\r\nimperial scope. Its thoughts are meant to be kept for national\r\ninterests. Its time is spared the waste of attention to local affairs.\r\nIt is even forbidden the vast domain of the laws of property, of\r\ncommercial dealing, and of ordinary crime. And even in the matter of\r\ncaring for national interests the way has from the first been made plain\r\nand easy for it. There are no clogging feudal institutions to embarrass\r\nit. There is no long-continued practice of legal or of royal tyranny for\r\nit to cure,--no clearing away of old debris of any sort to delay it in\r\nits exercise of a common-sense dominion over a thoroughly modern and\r\nprogressive nation. It is easy to believe that its legislative purposes\r\nmight be most fortunately clarified and simplified, were it to square\r\nthem by a conscientious attention to the paramount and controlling duty\r\nof understanding, discussing, and directing administration.\r\n\r\nIf the people's authorized representatives do not take upon themselves\r\nthis duty, and by identifying themselves with the actual work of\r\ngovernment stand between it and irresponsible, half-informed criticism,\r\nto what harassments is the executive not exposed? Led and checked by\r\nCongress, the prurient and fearless, because anonymous, animadversions\r\nof the Press, now so often premature and inconsiderate, might be\r\ndisciplined into serviceable capacity to interpret and judge. Its\r\nenergy and sagacity might be tempered by discretion, and strengthened by\r\nknowledge. One of our chief constitutional difficulties is that, in\r\nopportunities for informing and guiding public opinion, the freedom of\r\nthe Press is greater than the freedom of Congress. It is as if\r\nnewspapers, instead of the board of directors, were the sources of\r\ninformation for the stockholders of a corporation. We look into\r\ncorrespondents' letters instead of into the Congressional Record to find\r\nout what is a-doing and a-planning in the departments. Congress is\r\naltogether excluded from the arrangement by which the Press declares\r\nwhat the executive is, and conventions of the national parties decide\r\nwhat the executive shall be. Editors are self-constituted our guides,\r\nand caucus delegates our government directors.\r\n\r\nSince all this curious scattering of functions and contrivance of frail,\r\nextra-constitutional machinery of government is the result of that\r\nentire separation of the legislative and executive branches of the\r\nsystem which is with us so characteristically and essentially\r\nconstitutional, it is exceedingly interesting to inquire and important\r\nto understand how that separation came to be insisted upon in the making\r\nof the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton has in our own times, as well\r\nas before, been \"severely reproached with having said that the British\r\ngovernment was the 'best model in existence.' In 1787 this was a mere\r\ntruism. However much the men of that day differed they were all agreed\r\nin despising and distrusting _a priori_ constitutions and ideally\r\nperfect governments, fresh from the brains of visionary enthusiasts,\r\nsuch as sprang up rankly in the soil of the French revolution. The\r\nConvention of 1787 was composed of very able men of the English-speaking\r\nrace. They took the system of government with which they had been\r\nfamiliar, improved it, adapted it to the circumstances with which they\r\nhad to deal, and put it into successful operation. Hamilton's plan,\r\nthen, like the others, was on the British model, and it did not differ\r\nessentially in details from that finally adopted.\"[59] It is needful,\r\nhowever, to remember in this connection what has already been alluded\r\nto, that when that convention was copying the English Constitution, that\r\nConstitution was in a stage of transition, and had by no means fully\r\ndeveloped the features which are now recognized as most characteristic\r\nof it. Mr. Lodge is quite right in saying that the Convention, in\r\nadapting, improved upon the English Constitution with which its members\r\nwere familiar,--the Constitution of George III. and Lord North, the\r\nConstitution which had failed to crush Bute. It could hardly be said\r\nwith equal confidence, however, that our system as then made was an\r\nimprovement upon that scheme of responsible cabinet government which\r\nchallenges the admiration of the world to-day, though it was quite\r\nplainly a marked advance upon a parliament of royal nominees and\r\npensionaries and a secret cabinet of \"king's friends.\" The English\r\nconstitution of that day had a great many features which did not invite\r\nrepublican imitation. It was suspected, if not known, that the ministers\r\nwho sat in parliament were little more than the tools of a ministry of\r\nroyal favorites who were kept out of sight behind the strictest\r\nconfidences of the court. It was notorious that the subservient\r\nparliaments of the day represented the estates and the money of the\r\npeers and the influence of the King rather than the intelligence and\r\npurpose of the nation. The whole \"form and pressure\" of the time\r\nillustrated only too forcibly Lord Bute's sinister suggestion, that \"the\r\nforms of a free and the ends of an arbitrary government are things not\r\naltogether incompatible.\" It was, therefore, perfectly natural that the\r\nwarnings to be so easily drawn from the sight of a despotic monarch\r\nbinding the usages and privileges of self-government to the service of\r\nhis own intemperate purposes should be given grave heed by Americans,\r\nwho were the very persons who had suffered most from the existing\r\nabuses. It was something more than natural that the Convention of 1787\r\nshould desire to erect a Congress which would not be subservient and an\r\nexecutive which could not be despotic. And it was equally to have been\r\nexpected that they should regard an absolute separation of these two\r\ngreat branches of the system as the only effectual means for the\r\naccomplishment of that much desired end. It was impossible that they\r\ncould believe that executive and legislature could be brought into close\r\nrelations of cooperation and mutual confidence without being tempted,\r\nnay, even bidden, to collude. How could either maintain its independence\r\nof action unless each were to have the guaranty of the Constitution that\r\nits own domain should be absolutely safe from invasion, its own\r\nprerogatives absolutely free from challenge? \"They shrank from placing\r\nsovereign power anywhere. They feared that it would generate tyranny;\r\nGeorge III. had been a tyrant to them, and come what might they would\r\nnot make a George III.\"[60] They would conquer, by dividing, the power\r\nthey so much feared to see in any single hand.\r\n\r\n\"The English Constitution, in a word,\" says our most astute English\r\ncritic, \"is framed on the principle of choosing a single sovereign\r\nauthority, and making it good; the American, upon the principle of\r\nhaving many sovereign authorities, and hoping that their multitude may\r\natone for their inferiority. The Americans now extol their institutions,\r\nand so defraud themselves of their due praise. But if they had not a\r\ngenius for politics, if they had not a moderation in action singularly\r\ncurious where superficial speech is so violent, if they had not a regard\r\nfor law, such as no great people have ever evinced, and infinitely\r\nsurpassing ours, the multiplicity of authorities in the American\r\nConstitution would long ago have brought it to a bad end. Sensible\r\nshareholders, I have heard a shrewd attorney say, can work _any_ deed of\r\nsettlement; and so the men of Massachusetts could, I believe, work _any_\r\nconstitution.\"[61] It is not necessary to assent to Mr. Bagehot's\r\nstrictures; but it is not possible to deny the clear-sighted justice of\r\nthis criticism. In order to be fair to the memory of our great\r\nconstitution-makers, however, it is necessary to remember that when they\r\nsat in convention in Philadelphia the English Constitution, which they\r\ncopied, was not the simple system which was before Mr. Bagehot's eyes\r\nwhen he wrote. Its single sovereign authority was not then a\r\ntwice-reformed House of Commons truly representative of the nation and\r\nreadily obeyed by a responsible Ministry. The sovereignty was at see-saw\r\nbetween the throne and the parliament,--and the throne-end of the beam\r\nwas generally uppermost. Our device of separated, individualized powers\r\nwas very much better than a nominal sovereignty of the Commons which was\r\nsuffered to be overridden by force, fraud, or craft, by the real\r\nsovereignty of the King. The English Constitution was at that time in\r\nreality much worse than our own; and, if it is now superior, it is so\r\nbecause its growth has not been hindered or destroyed by the too tight\r\nligaments of a written fundamental law.\r\n\r\nThe natural, the inevitable tendency of every system of self-government\r\nlike our own and the British is to exalt the representative body, the\r\npeople's parliament, to a position of absolute supremacy. That tendency\r\nhas, I think, been quite as marked in our own constitutional history as\r\nin that of any other country, though its power has been to some extent\r\nneutralized, and its progress in great part stayed, by those denials of\r\nthat supremacy which we respect because they are written in our law. The\r\npolitical law written in our hearts is here at variance with that which\r\nthe Constitution sought to establish. A written constitution may and\r\noften will be violated in both letter and spirit by a people of\r\nenergetic political talents and a keen instinct for progressive\r\npractical development; but so long as they adhere to the forms of such a\r\nconstitution, so long as the machinery of government supplied by it is\r\nthe only machinery which the legal and moral sense of such a people\r\npermits it to use, its political development must be in many directions\r\nnarrowly restricted because of an insuperable lack of open or adequate\r\nchannels. Our Constitution, like every other constitution which puts the\r\nauthority to make laws and the duty of controlling the public\r\nexpenditure into the hands of a popular assembly, practically sets that\r\nassembly to rule the affairs of the nation as supreme overlord. But, by\r\nseparating it entirely from its executive agencies, it deprives it of\r\nthe opportunity and means for making its authority complete and\r\nconvenient. The constitutional machinery is left of such a pattern that\r\nother forces less than that of Congress may cross and compete with\r\nCongress, though they are too small to overcome or long offset it; and\r\nthe result is simply an unpleasant, wearing friction which, with other\r\nadjustments, more felicitous and equally safe, might readily be avoided.\r\n\r\nCongress, consequently, is still lingering and chafing under just such\r\nembarrassments as made the English Commons a nuisance both to\r\nthemselves and to everybody else immediately after the Revolution\r\nSettlement had given them their first sure promise of supremacy. The\r\nparallel is startlingly exact. \"In outer seeming the Revolution of 1688\r\nhad only transferred the sovereignty over England from James to William\r\nand Mary. In actual fact it had given a powerful and decisive impulse to\r\nthe great constitutional progress which was transferring the sovereignty\r\nfrom the King to the House of Commons. From the moment when its sole\r\nright to tax the nation was established by the Bill of Rights, and when\r\nits own resolve settled the practice of granting none but annual\r\nsupplies to the Crown, the House of Commons became the supreme power in\r\nthe State.... But though the constitutional change was complete, the\r\nmachinery of government was far from having adapted itself to the new\r\nconditions of political life which such a change brought about. However\r\npowerful the will of the Commons might be, it had no means of bringing\r\nits will directly to bear on the control of public affairs. The\r\nministers who had charge of them were not its servants but the servants\r\nof the Crown; it was from the King that they looked for direction, and\r\nto the King that they held themselves responsible. By impeachment or\r\nmore indirect means the Commons could force a king to remove a minister\r\nwho contradicted their will; but they had no constitutional power to\r\nreplace the fallen statesman by a minister who would carry out their\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\"The result was the growth of a temper in the Lower House which drove\r\nWilliam and his ministers to despair. It became as corrupt, as jealous\r\nof power, as fickle in its resolves and factious in its spirit as bodies\r\nalways become whose consciousness of the possession of power is\r\nuntempered by a corresponding consciousness of the practical\r\ndifficulties or the moral responsibilities of the power which they\r\npossess. It grumbled ... and it blamed the Crown and its ministers for\r\nall at which it grumbled. But it was hard to find out what policy or\r\nmeasures it would have preferred. Its mood changed, as William bitterly\r\ncomplained, with every hour.... The Houses were in fact without the\r\nguidance of recognized leaders, without adequate information, and\r\ndestitute of that organization out of which alone a definite policy can\r\ncome.\"[62]\r\n\r\nThe cure for this state of things which Sunderland had the sagacity to\r\nsuggest, and William the wisdom to apply, was the mediation between King\r\nand Commons of a cabinet representative of the majority of the popular\r\nchamber,--a first but long and decisive step towards responsible\r\ncabinet government. Whether a similar remedy would be possible or\r\ndesirable in our own case it is altogether aside from my present purpose\r\nto inquire. I am pointing out facts,--diagnosing, not prescribing\r\nremedies. My only point just now is, that no one can help being struck\r\nby the closeness of the likeness between the incipient distempers of the\r\nfirst parliaments of William and Mary and the developed disorders now so\r\nplainly discernible in the constitution of Congress. Though honest and\r\ndiligent, it is meddlesome and inefficient; and it is meddlesome and\r\ninefficient for exactly the same reasons that made it natural that the\r\npost-Revolutionary parliaments should exhibit like clumsiness and like\r\ntemper: namely, because it is \"without the guidance of recognized\r\nleaders, without adequate information, and destitute of that\r\norganization out of which alone a definite policy can come.\"\r\n\r\nThe dangers of this serious imperfection in our governmental machinery\r\nhave not been clearly demonstrated in our experience hitherto; but now\r\ntheir delayed fulfillment seems to be close at hand. The plain tendency\r\nis towards a centralization of all the greater powers of government in\r\nthe hands of the federal authorities, and towards the practical\r\nconfirmation of those prerogatives of supreme overlordship which\r\nCongress has been gradually arrogating to itself. The central\r\ngovernment is constantly becoming stronger and more active, and Congress\r\nis establishing itself as the one sovereign authority in that\r\ngovernment. In constitutional theory and in the broader features of past\r\npractice, ours has been what Mr. Bagehot has called a \"composite\"\r\ngovernment. Besides state and federal authorities to dispute as to\r\nsovereignty, there have been within the federal system itself rival and\r\nirreconcilable powers. But gradually the strong are overcoming the weak.\r\nIf the signs of the times are to be credited, we are fast approaching an\r\nadjustment of sovereignty quite as \"simple\" as need be. Congress is not\r\nonly to retain the authority it already possesses, but is to be brought\r\nagain and again face to face with still greater demands upon its energy,\r\nits wisdom, and its conscience, is to have ever-widening duties and\r\nresponsibilities thrust upon it, without being granted a moment's\r\nopportunity to look back from the plough to which it has set its hands.\r\n\r\nThe sphere and influence of national administration and national\r\nlegislation are widening rapidly. Our populations are growing at such a\r\nrate that one's reckoning staggers at counting the possible millions\r\nthat may have a home and a work on this continent ere fifty more years\r\nshall have filled their short span. The East will not always be the\r\ncentre of national life. The South is fast accumulating wealth, and will\r\nfaster recover influence. The West has already achieved a greatness\r\nwhich no man can gainsay, and has in store a power of future growth\r\nwhich no man can estimate. Whether these sections are to be harmonious\r\nor dissentient depends almost entirely upon the methods and policy of\r\nthe federal government. If that government be not careful to keep within\r\nits own proper sphere and prudent to square its policy by rules of\r\nnational welfare, sectional lines must and will be known; citizens of\r\none part of the country may look with jealousy and even with hatred upon\r\ntheir fellow-citizens of another part; and faction must tear and\r\ndissension distract a country which Providence would bless, but which\r\nman may curse. The government of a country so vast and various must be\r\nstrong, prompt, wieldy, and efficient. Its strength must consist in the\r\ncertainty and uniformity of its purposes, in its accord with national\r\nsentiment, in its unhesitating action, and in its honest aims. It must\r\nbe steadied and approved by open administration diligently obedient to\r\nthe more permanent judgments of public opinion; and its only active\r\nagency, its representative chambers, must be equipped with something\r\nbesides abundant powers of legislation.\r\n\r\nAs at present constituted, the federal government lacks strength because\r\nits powers are divided, lacks promptness because its authorities are\r\nmultiplied, lacks wieldiness because its processes are roundabout, lacks\r\nefficiency because its responsibility is indistinct and its action\r\nwithout competent direction. It is a government in which every officer\r\nmay talk about every other officer's duty without having to render\r\nstrict account for not doing his own, and in which the masters are held\r\nin check and offered contradiction by the servants. Mr. Lowell has\r\ncalled it \"government by declamation.\" Talk is not sobered by any\r\nnecessity imposed upon those who utter it to suit their actions to their\r\nwords. There is no day of reckoning for words spoken. The speakers of a\r\ncongressional majority may, without risk of incurring ridicule or\r\ndiscredit, condemn what their own Committees are doing; and the\r\nspokesmen of a minority may urge what contrary courses they please with\r\na well-grounded assurance that what they say will be forgotten before\r\nthey can be called upon to put it into practice. Nobody stands sponsor\r\nfor the policy of the government. A dozen men originate it; a dozen\r\ncompromises twist and alter it; a dozen offices whose names are scarcely\r\nknown outside of Washington put it into execution.\r\n\r\nThis is the defect to which, it will be observed, I am constantly\r\nrecurring; to which I recur again and again because every examination of\r\nthe system, at whatsoever point begun, leads inevitably to it as to a\r\ncentral secret. It is the defect which interprets all the rest, because\r\nit is their common product. It is exemplified in the extraordinary fact\r\nthat the utterances of the Press have greater weight and are accorded\r\ngreater credit, though the Press speaks entirely without authority, than\r\nthe utterances of Congress, though Congress possesses all authority. The\r\ngossip of the street is listened to rather than the words of the\r\nlaw-makers. The editor directs public opinion, the congressman obeys it.\r\nWhen a presidential election is at hand, indeed, the words of the\r\npolitical orator gain temporary heed. He is recognized as an authority\r\nin the arena, as a professional critic competent to discuss the good and\r\nbad points, and to forecast the fortunes of the contestants. There is\r\nsomething definite in hand, and he is known to have studied all its\r\nbearings. He is one of the managers, or is thought to be well acquainted\r\nwith the management. He speaks \"from the card.\" But let him talk, not\r\nabout candidates, but about measures or about the policy of the\r\ngovernment, and his observations sink at once to the level of a mere\r\nindividual expression of opinion, to which his political occupations\r\nseem to add very little weight. It is universally recognized that he\r\nspeaks without authority, about things which his vote may help to\r\nsettle, but about which several hundred other men have votes quite as\r\ninfluential as his own. Legislation is not a thing to be known\r\nbeforehand. It depends upon the conclusions of sundry Standing\r\nCommittees. It is an aggregate, not a simple, production. It is\r\nimpossible to tell how many persons' opinions and influences have\r\nentered into its composition. It is even impracticable to determine from\r\nthis year's law-making what next year's will be like.\r\n\r\nSpeaking, therefore, without authority, the political orator speaks to\r\nlittle purpose when he speaks about legislation. The papers do not\r\nreport him carefully; and their editorials seldom take any color from\r\nhis arguments. The Press, being anonymous and representing a large force\r\nof inquisitive news-hunters, is much more powerful than he chiefly\r\nbecause it _is_ impersonal and seems to represent a wider and more\r\nthorough range of information. At the worst, it can easily compete with\r\nany ordinary individual. Its individual opinion is quite sure to be\r\nesteemed as worthy of attention as any other individual opinion. And,\r\nbesides, it is almost everywhere strong enough to deny currency to the\r\nspeeches of individuals whom it does not care to report. It goes to its\r\naudience; the orator must depend upon his audience coming to him. It can\r\nbe heard at every fireside; the orator can be heard only on the platform\r\nor the hustings. There is no imperative demand on the part of the\r\nreading public in this country that the newspapers should report\r\npolitical speeches in full. On the contrary, most readers would be\r\ndisgusted at finding their favorite columns so filled up. By giving even\r\na notice of more than an item's length to such a speech, an editor runs\r\nthe risk of being denounced as dull. And I believe that the position of\r\nthe American Press is in this regard quite singular. The English\r\nnewspapers are so far from being thus independent and self-sufficient\r\npowers,--a law unto themselves,--in the politics of the empire that they\r\nare constrained to do homage to the political orator whether they will\r\nor no. Conservative editors must spread before their readers _verbatim_\r\nreports not only of the speeches of the leaders of their own party, but\r\nalso of the principal speeches of the leading Liberal orators; and\r\nLiberal journals have no choice but to print every syllable of the more\r\nimportant public utterances of the Conservative leaders. The nation\r\ninsists upon knowing what its public men have to say, even when it is\r\nnot so well said as the newspapers which report them could have said\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere are only two things which can give any man a right to expect that\r\nwhen he speaks the whole country will listen: namely, genius and\r\nauthority. Probably no one will ever contend that Sir Stafford Northcote\r\nwas an orator, or even a good speaker. But by proof of unblemished\r\ncharacter, and by assiduous, conscientious, and able public service he\r\nrose to be the recognized leader of his party in the House of Commons;\r\nand it is simply because he speaks as one having authority,--and not as\r\nthe scribes of the Press,--that he is as sure of a heedful hearing as is\r\nMr. Gladstone, who adds genius and noble oratory to the authority of\r\nestablished leadership. The leaders of English public life have\r\nsomething besides weight of character, prestige of personal service and\r\nexperience, and authority of individual opinion to exalt them above the\r\nanonymous Press. They have definite authority and power in the actual\r\ncontrol of government. They are directly commissioned to control the\r\npolicy of the administration. They stand before the country, in\r\nparliament and out of it, as the responsible chiefs of their parties. It\r\nis their business to lead those parties, and it is the matter-of-course\r\ncustom of the constituencies to visit upon the parties the punishment\r\ndue for the mistakes made by these chiefs. They are at once the servants\r\nand scapegoats of their parties.\r\n\r\nIt is these well-established privileges and responsibilities of theirs\r\nwhich make their utterances considered worth hearing,--nay, necessary to\r\nbe heard and pondered. Their public speeches are their parties'\r\nplatforms. What the leader promises his party stands ready to do, should\r\nit be intrusted with office. This certainty of audience and of credit\r\ngives spice to what such leaders have to say, and lends elevation to the\r\ntone of all their public utterances. They for the most part avoid\r\nbuncombe, which would be difficult to translate into Acts of Parliament.\r\nIt is easy to see how great an advantage their station and influence\r\ngive them over our own public men. We have no such responsible party\r\nleadership on this side the sea; we are very shy about conferring much\r\nauthority on anybody, and the consequence is that it requires something\r\nvery like genius to secure for any one of our statesmen a universally\r\nrecognized right to be heard and to create an ever-active desire to hear\r\nhim whenever he talks, not about candidates, but about measures. An\r\nextraordinary gift of eloquence, such as not every generation may hope\r\nto see, will always hold, because it will always captivate, the\r\nattention of the people. But genius and eloquence are too rare to be\r\ndepended upon for the instruction and guidance of the masses; and since\r\nour politicians lack the credit of authority and responsibility, they\r\nmust give place, except at election-time, to the Press, which is\r\neverywhere, generally well-informed, and always talking. It is\r\nnecessarily \"government by declamation\" and editorial-writing.\r\n\r\nIt is probably also this lack of leadership which gives to our national\r\nparties their curious, conglomerate character. It would seem to be\r\nscarcely an exaggeration to say that they are homogeneous only in name.\r\nNeither of the two principal parties is of one mind with itself. Each\r\ntolerates all sorts of difference of creed and variety of aim within its\r\nown ranks. Each pretends to the same purposes and permits among its\r\npartisans the same contradictions to those purposes. They are grouped\r\naround no legislative leaders whose capacity has been tested and to\r\nwhose opinions they loyally adhere. They are like armies without\r\nofficers, engaged upon a campaign which has no great cause at its back.\r\nTheir names and traditions, not their hopes and policy, keep them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt is to this fact, as well as to short terms which allow little time\r\nfor differences to come to a head, that the easy agreement of\r\ncongressional majorities should be attributed. In other like assemblies\r\nthe harmony of majorities is constantly liable to disturbance. Ministers\r\nlose their following and find their friends falling away in the midst\r\nof a session. But not so in Congress. There, although the majority is\r\nfrequently simply conglomerate, made up of factions not a few, and\r\nbearing in its elements every seed of discord, the harmony of party\r\nvoting seldom, if ever, suffers an interruption. So far as outsiders can\r\nsee, legislation generally flows placidly on, and the majority easily\r\nhas its own way, acting with a sort of matter-of-course unanimity, with\r\nno suspicion of individual freedom of action. Whatever revolts may be\r\nthreatened or accomplished in the ranks of the party outside the House\r\nat the polls, its power is never broken inside the House. This is\r\ndoubtless due in part to the fact that there is no freedom of debate in\r\nthe House; but there can be no question that it is principally due to\r\nthe fact that debate is without aim, just because legislation is without\r\nconsistency. Legislation is conglomerate. The absence of any concert of\r\naction amongst the Committees leaves legislation with scarcely any trace\r\nof determinate party courses. No two schemes pull together. If there is\r\na coincidence of principle between several bills of the same session, it\r\nis generally accidental; and the confusion of policy which prevents\r\nintelligent cooperation also, of course, prevents intelligent\r\ndifferences and divisions. There is never a transfer of power from one\r\nparty to the other during a session, because such a transfer would mean\r\nalmost nothing. The majority remains of one mind so long as a Congress\r\nlives, because its mind is very vaguely ascertained, and its power of\r\nplanning a split consequently very limited. It has no common mind, and\r\nif it had, has not the machinery for changing it. It is led by a score\r\nor two of Committees whose composition must remain the same to the end;\r\nand who are too numerous, as well as too disconnected, to fight against.\r\nIt stays on one side because it hardly knows where the boundaries of\r\nthat side are or how to cross them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a certain well-known piece of congressional machinery\r\nlong ago invented and applied for the special purpose of keeping both\r\nmajority and minority compact. The legislative caucus has almost as\r\nimportant a part in our system as have the Standing Committees, and\r\ndeserves as close study as they. Its functions are much more easily\r\nunderstood in all their bearings than those of the Committees, however,\r\nbecause they are much simpler. The caucus is meant as an antidote to the\r\nCommittees. It is designed to supply the cohesive principle which the\r\nmultiplicity and mutual independence of the Committees so powerfully\r\ntend to destroy. Having no Prime Minister to confer with about the\r\npolicy of the government, as they see members of parliament doing, our\r\ncongressmen confer with each other in caucus. Rather than imprudently\r\nexpose to the world the differences of opinion threatened or developed\r\namong its members, each party hastens to remove disrupting debate from\r\nthe floor of Congress, where the speakers might too hastily commit\r\nthemselves to insubordination, to quiet conferences behind closed doors,\r\nwhere frightened scruples may be reassured and every disagreement healed\r\nwith a salve of compromise or subdued with the whip of political\r\nexpediency. The caucus is the drilling-ground of the party. There its\r\ndiscipline is renewed and strengthened, its uniformity of step and\r\ngesture regained. The voting and speaking in the House are generally\r\nmerely the movements of a sort of dress parade, for which the exercises\r\nof the caucus are designed to prepare. It is easy to see how difficult\r\nit would be for the party to keep its head amidst the confused\r\ncross-movements of the Committees without thus now and again pulling\r\nitself together in caucus, where it can ask itself its own mind and\r\npledge itself anew to eternal agreement.\r\n\r\nThe credit of inventing this device is probably due to the Democrats.\r\nThey appear to have used it so early as the second session of the\r\neighth Congress. Speaking of that session, a reliable authority says:\r\n\"During this session of Congress there was far less of free and\r\nindependent discussion on the measures proposed by the friends of the\r\nadministration than had been previously practiced in both branches of\r\nthe national legislature. It appeared that on the most important\r\nsubjects, the course adopted by the majority was the effect of caucus\r\narrangement, or, in other words, had been previously agreed upon at\r\nmeetings of the Democratic members held in private. Thus the legislation\r\nof Congress was constantly swayed by a party following feelings and\r\npledges rather than according to sound reason or personal\r\nconviction.\"[63] The censure implied in this last sentence may have\r\nseemed righteous at the time when such caucus pledges were in disfavor\r\nas new-fangled shackles, but it would hardly be accepted as just by the\r\nintensely practical politicians of to-day. They would probably prefer to\r\nput it thus: That the silvern speech spent in caucus secures the golden\r\nsilence maintained on the floor of Congress, making each party rich in\r\nconcord and happy in cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe fact that makes this defense of the caucus not altogether conclusive\r\nis that it is shielded from all responsibility by its sneaking privacy.\r\nIt has great power without any balancing weight of accountability.\r\nProbably its debates would constitute interesting and instructive\r\nreading for the public, were they published; but they never get out\r\nexcept in rumors often rehearsed and as often amended. They are, one may\r\ntake it for granted, much more candid and go much nearer the political\r\nheart of the questions discussed than anything that is ever said openly\r\nin Congress to the reporters' gallery. They approach matters without\r\nmasks and handle them without gloves. It might hurt, but it would\r\nenlighten us to hear them. As it is, however, there is unhappily no\r\nground for denying their power to override sound reason and personal\r\nconviction. The caucus cannot always silence or subdue a large and\r\ninfluential minority of dissentients, but its whip seldom fails to\r\nreduce individual malcontents and mutineers into submission. There is no\r\nplace in congressional jousts for the free lance. The man who disobeys\r\nhis party caucus is understood to disavow his party allegiance\r\naltogether, and to assume that dangerous neutrality which is so apt to\r\ndegenerate into mere caprice, and which is almost sure to destroy his\r\ninfluence by bringing him under the suspicion of being unreliable,--a\r\nsuspicion always conclusively damning in practical life. Any individual,\r\nor any minority of weak numbers or small influence, who has the\r\ntemerity to neglect the decisions of the caucus is sure, if the offense\r\nbe often repeated, or even once committed upon an important issue, to be\r\nread out of the party, almost without chance of reinstatement. And every\r\none knows that nothing can be accomplished in politics by mere\r\ndisagreement. The only privilege such recalcitrants gain is the\r\nprivilege of disagreement; they are forever shut out from the privilege\r\nof confidential cooperation. They have chosen the helplessness of a\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that, unfortunate as the necessity is for\r\nthe existence of such powers as those of the caucus, that necessity\r\nactually exists and cannot be neglected. Against the fatal action of so\r\nmany elements of disintegration it would seem to be imperatively needful\r\nthat some energetic element of cohesion should be provided. It is\r\ndoubtful whether in any other nation, with a shorter inheritance of\r\npolitical instinct, parties could long successfully resist the\r\ncentrifugal forces of the committee system with only the varying\r\nattraction of the caucus to detain them. The wonder is that, despite the\r\nforcible and unnatural divorcement of legislation and administration and\r\nthe consequent distraction of legislation from all attention to anything\r\nlike an intelligent planning and superintendence of policy, we are not\r\ncursed with as many factions as now almost hopelessly confuse French\r\npolitics. That we have had, and continue to have, only two national\r\nparties of national importance or real power is fortunate rather than\r\nnatural. Their names stand for a fact, but scarcely for a reason.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent observer of our politics[64] has declared that there is\r\nin the United States \"a class, including thousands and tens of thousands\r\nof the best men in the country, who think it possible to enjoy the\r\nfruits of good government without working for them.\" Every one who has\r\nseen beyond the outside of our American life must recognize the truth of\r\nthis; to explain it is to state the sum of all the most valid criticisms\r\nof congressional government. Public opinion has no easy vehicle for its\r\njudgments, no quick channels for its action. Nothing about the system is\r\ndirect and simple. Authority is perplexingly subdivided and distributed,\r\nand responsibility has to be hunted down in out-of-the-way corners. So\r\nthat the sum of the whole matter is that the means of working for the\r\nfruits of good government are not readily to be found. The average\r\ncitizen may be excused for esteeming government at best but a haphazard\r\naffair, upon which his vote and all of his influence can have but\r\nlittle effect. How is his choice of a representative in Congress to\r\naffect the policy of the country as regards the questions in which he is\r\nmost interested, if the man for whom he votes has no chance of getting\r\non the Standing Committee which has virtual charge of those questions?\r\nHow is it to make any difference who is chosen President? Has the\r\nPresident any very great authority in matters of vital policy? It seems\r\nalmost a thing of despair to get any assurance that any vote he may cast\r\nwill even in an infinitesimal degree affect the essential courses of\r\nadministration. There are so many cooks mixing their ingredients in the\r\nnational broth that it seems hopeless, this thing of changing one cook\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe charm of our constitutional ideal has now been long enough wound up\r\nto enable sober men who do not believe in political witchcraft to judge\r\nwhat it has accomplished, and is likely still to accomplish, without\r\nfurther winding. The Constitution is not honored by blind worship. The\r\nmore open-eyed we become, as a nation, to its defects, and the prompter\r\nwe grow in applying with the unhesitating courage of conviction all\r\nthoroughly-tested or well-considered expedients necessary to make\r\nself-government among us a straightforward thing of simple method,\r\nsingle, unstinted power, and clear responsibility, the nearer will we\r\napproach to the sound sense and practical genius of the great and\r\nhonorable statesmen of 1787. And the first step towards emancipation\r\nfrom the timidity and false pride which have led us to seek to thrive\r\ndespite the defects of our national system rather than seem to deny its\r\nperfection is a fearless criticism of that system. When we shall have\r\nexamined all its parts without sentiment, and ganged all its functions\r\nby the standards of practical common sense, we shall have established\r\nanew our right to the claim of political sagacity; and it will remain\r\nonly to act intelligently upon what our opened eyes have seen in order\r\nto prove again the justice of our claim to political genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeen.

The laws of the United States will be\r\nheld paramount to all \"state\" laws, claims, and even constitutions. The\r\nsupreme power is with the general government to decide in this, as in\r\neverything else, for the States have neglected to secure any umpire or\r\nmode of decision in case of difference between them. Nor is there any\r\npoint in the Constitution for them to rally under. They may give an\r\nopinion, but the opinions of the general government must prevail.... Any\r\ndirect and open act would be termed usurpation. But whether the gradual\r\ninfluence and encroachments of the general government may not gradually\r\nswallow up the state governments, is another matter.\"\r\n\r\n[10] Pensacola Tel. Co. _v_. West.

But this involves no restriction of\r\nstate powers; and perhaps there ought to be offset against it that other\r\ndecision (several cases, October, 1883), which denies constitutional\r\nsanction to the Civil Rights Act.\r\n\r\n[13] _Principles of Constitutional Law_, pp. 143, 144.\r\n\r\n[14] Marbury _v_.

The Senate, on its part, by unanimous consent, took up and\r\npassed in about ten minutes seven bills providing for public buildings\r\nin different States, appropriating an aggregate of $1,200,000 in this\r\nshort time. A recent House feat was one in which a bill, allowing 1,300\r\nwar claims in a lump, was passed. It contained one hundred and nineteen\r\npages full of little claims, amounting in all to $291,000; and a member,\r\nin deprecating criticism on this disposition of them, said that the\r\nCommittee had received ten huge bags full of such claims, which had been\r\nadjudicated by the Treasury officials, and it was a physical\r\nimpossibility to examine them.\"--N. Y. _Sun_, 1881.\r\n\r\n[31] Congress, though constantly erecting new Committees, never gives up\r\nold ones, no matter how useless they may have become by subtraction of\r\nduties. Thus there is not only the superseded Committee on Public\r\nExpenditures but the Committee on Manufactures also, which, when a part\r\nof the one-time Committee on Commerce and Manufactures, had plenty to\r\ndo, but which, since the creation of a distinct Committee on Commerce,\r\nhas had nothing to do, having now, together with the Committees on\r\nAgriculture and Indian Affairs, no duties assigned to it by the rules.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether the Committee on Commerce will suffer a\r\nlike eclipse because of the gift of its principal duties to the new\r\nCommittee on Rivers and Harbors.\r\n\r\n[32] See the report of this Committee, which was under the chairmanship\r\nof Senator Windom.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of what the House Committees find by special effort may\r\nbe seen in the revelations of the investigation of the expenses of the\r\nnotorious \"Star Route Trials\" made by the Forty-eighth Congress's\r\nCommittee on Expenditures in the department of Justice.\r\n\r\n[33] See General Garfield's article, already once quoted, _North\r\nAmerican Review_, vol. cxxviii. p. 533.\r\n\r\n[34] _Essays on Parliamentary Reform._\r\n\r\n[35] Green's _History of the English People_, vol. iv., pp. 202, 203.\r\n\r\n[36] \"G.

I quote from the\r\nreport of the _London Times_.\r\n\r\n[41] \"No Senator shall speak more than twice, in any one debate, on the\r\nsame day, without leave of the Senate.\"--Senate Rule 4.\r\n\r\n[42] These quotations from Bagehot are taken from various parts of the\r\nfifth chapter of his _English Constitution_.\r\n\r\n[43] These are the words of Lord Rosebery--testimony from the oldest and\r\nmost celebrated second chamber that exists.\r\n\r\n[44] There seems to have been at one time a tendency towards a better\r\npractice. In 1813 the Senate sought to revive the early custom, in\r\naccordance with which the President delivered his messages in person, by\r\nrequesting the attendance of the President to consult upon foreign\r\naffairs; but Mr. Madison declined.\r\n\r\n[45] _North American Review_, vol. 108, p. 625.\r\n\r\n[46] _English Constitution_, chap, viii., p. 293.\r\n\r\n[47] _Atlantic Monthly_, vol. xxv., p. 148.\r\n\r\n[48] Something like this has been actually proposed by Mr. Albert\r\nStickney, in his interesting and incisive essay, _A True Republic_.\r\n\r\n[49] State, Treasury, War, Navy.\r\n\r\n[50] As quoted in _Macmillan's Magazine_, vol. vii., p. 67.\r\n\r\n[51] I quote from an excellent handbook, _The United States Government_,\r\nby Lamphere.\r\n\r\n[52] \"In America the President cannot prevent any law from being passed,\r\nnor can he evade the obligation of enforcing it His sincere and zealous\r\ncooperation is no doubt useful, but it is not indispensable, in the\r\ncarrying on of public affairs. All his important acts are directly or\r\nindirectly submitted to the legislature, and of his own free authority\r\nhe can do but little. It is, therefore, his weakness, and not his power,\r\nwhich enables him to remain in opposition to Congress. In Europe,\r\nharmony must reign between the Crown and the other branches of the\r\nlegislature, because a collision between them may prove serious; in\r\nAmerica, this harmony is not indispensable, because such a collision is\r\nimpossible.\"--De Tocqueville, i. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[53] _Westminster Review_, vol. lxvi., p. 193.\r\n\r\n[54] Tenure of Office Act, already discussed.\r\n\r\n[55] These \"ifs\" are abundantly supported by the executive acts of the\r\nwar-time.

Traill, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[57] Professor Sumner's _Andrew Jackson_ (American Statesmen Series), p.\r\n226. \"Finally,\" adds Prof. S., \"the methods and machinery of democratic\r\nrepublican self-government--caucuses, primaries, committees, and\r\nconventions--lend themselves perhaps more easily than any other methods\r\nand machinery to the uses of selfish cliques which seek political\r\ninfluence for interested purposes.\"\r\n\r\n[58] Bagehot: _Essay on Sir Robert Peel_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[59] H.
