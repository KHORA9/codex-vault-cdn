III.--FEBRUARY, 1863.--No. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR NATIONAL FINANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur national finances are involved in extreme peril. Our public debt\r\nexceeds $720,000,000, and is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\non the 1st of July next, at $1,122,297,403, and on the 1st of July,\r\n1864, at $1,744,685,586. When we reflect that this is nearly one half\r\nthe debt of England, and bearing almost double the rate of interest, it\r\nis clear that we are approaching a fatal catastrophe. Nor is this the\r\nmost alarming symptom. Gold now commands a premium of thirty-two per\r\ncent., as compared with legal tender treasury notes, and, with largely\r\naugmented issues, must rise much higher, with a correspondent increase\r\nof our debt and expenditures. Indeed, should the war continue, and there\r\nbe no other alternative than additional treasury notes, they will,\r\nbefore the close of the next fiscal year, fail to command forty cents on\r\nthe dollar in gold, and our debt exceed several billions of dollars.\r\nThis would result from an immense redundancy and depreciation of\r\ncurrency, and from the alarm created here and in Europe, as to the\r\nmaintenance of the Union, and the ultimate solvency of the Government.\r\nIndeed, our enemies, at home and abroad, the rebels, and their allies in\r\nthe North and in Europe, already announce impending national bankruptcy\r\nand repudiation, and there are many devoted patriots who fear such a\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nThat the danger is imminent, is a truth which must not be disguised.\r\nHere lies the great peril of the Government. It is not the rebel armies\r\nthat can ever overthrow the Union. It is the alarming increase of the\r\npublic debt and expenditures, and the still more appalling depreciation\r\nof the national currency, that most imperil the great Republic.\r\n\r\nAnd is the Union indeed to fall? Are we to be divided into separate\r\nStates or many confederacies, each warring against the other, the sport\r\nof foreign oligarchs, the scorn of humanity, the betrayers of the\r\nliberty of our country and of mankind? Can we yet save the Republic?\r\nThis is a fearful and momentous question, but it must be answered, and\r\nanswered NOW. Inaction is syncope. Delay is death. The life of the\r\nRepublic is ebbing fast, and the approaching Ides of March may toll the\r\nfuneral words, _It is too late_!\r\n\r\nWhat then must be done to avert the dread catastrophe? Action, immediate\r\nand energetic action, in the field and in Congress. Winter is the best\r\nseason for a campaign in the South. On--on--on with the banner of the\r\nRepublic, by land and sea, and with all the reinforcements, from the\r\nOhio and Potomac to the Gulf. On, also, with the necessary measures in\r\nCongress to save our finances from ruin, arrest the depreciation of our\r\nnational currency, and restore the public credit. We are upon the verge\r\nof ruin. We are hanging over the gulf of an irredeemable paper system,\r\nand its spectral shade, repudiation, is seen dimly in the dark abyss.\r\nThe present Congress may save us; but what of the next? Would they, if\r\nthey could? Who can answer? Can they, if they would? No! no! It will\r\nthen be _too late_. Never did any representative assembly encounter so\r\nfearful a responsibility as the present Congress. Each member must vote\r\nas if the fate of the Union and of humanity depended upon his action. He\r\nmust rise above the passing clouds of passion and prejudice, of State,\r\nlocal, or selfish interests, into the serene and holy atmosphere,\r\nillumined by the light of truth, and warmed by the love of his country\r\nand of mankind. His only inquiry must be, What will save the nation? The\r\nallegiance to the Union is paramount, its maintenance 'the supreme law,'\r\nthe _lex legum_, of highest obligation, and he who, abandoning this\r\nprinciple, follows in preference any real or supposed State policy, is a\r\nsecessionist in action, and a traitor to his country and mankind. Should\r\nthe catastrophe happen, no such paltry motives will save him from\r\ndisgrace and infamy; and, if he be snatched from oblivion, his only\r\nepitaph will be: Here lies a destroyer of the American Union. He did not\r\ndestroy it by bullets, but by votes. He did not march against it with\r\narmed battalions; but, a sentinel, he slept on the post of duty,\r\nand--his country fell.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can Congress do? They can consider _at once_ this great\r\nfinancial question, uninterrupted by any other measure, until there\r\nshall have been action complete and decisive. But two months more remain\r\nof the session. Not another day nor hour must be lost. All admit that\r\nsomething must be done, and done quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the remedy for our depreciated and depreciating national\r\ncurrency? The Secretary of the Treasury anticipated the disaster, and\r\nproposed a remedy in 1861. I gave his bank plan then my earnest and\r\nimmediate support. Well would it have been for our country if it had\r\nthen been adopted, and gold would not now command a premium of\r\nthirty-two per cent. After a year's experience and deliberation, the\r\nSecretary reiterates his former recommendation, with words of solemn\r\nimport, and arguments of great force. His is the chief responsibility.\r\nTo him is mainly intrusted the custody of the public credit. His is now\r\nthe duty of saving us from national bankruptcy. At such a time, I would\r\ndiffer from him on such a question, only on the clearest convictions,\r\nand then only upon the condition that I had a better plan as a\r\nsubstitute, and that mine could become a law now, and be carried now\r\ninto practical execution. If all this could not be done, I would support\r\nthe plan of the Secretary, as all admit that delay or inaction is death.\r\nIf my words be too bold or earnest, let them be attributed to my\r\nprofound conviction that the American Union is in extreme peril, and\r\nthat its downfall involves the final catastrophe of our country and of\r\nour race. Let no man talk of a separation of the Union in any\r\ncontingency. Let none speak now of peace or compromise with armed\r\ntreason. Let none think of constructing separate nationalities out of\r\nthe broken and bleeding fragments of a dismembered Union. No; far better\r\nthat our wrecked and blasted earth should swing from its orbit,\r\ndisintegrate into its original atoms, and its place remain forever\r\nvacant in the universe, than that we should survive, with such memories\r\nof departed glory, and such a burning sense of unutterable infamy and\r\ndegradation. Fallen--fallen--fallen! from the highest pinnacle to the\r\nlowest depth, to rise no more forever! What American would wish to live,\r\nand encounter such a destiny? And why fallen? From a cause more damning\r\nthan our fate. Fallen, let the truth be told, as history would record,\r\nbecause faction was stronger than patriotism, and the degenerate sons of\r\nnoble sires extinguished the world's last hope, by basely surrendering\r\nthe American Union to the foul coalition of slavery and treason. This\r\nrebellion is the most stupendous crime in the annals of our race, and\r\nits projectors and coadjutors, at home or abroad, individual or\r\ndynastic, are doomed to immortal infamy. With its demoniac passions, its\r\nsatanic ambition, desecrating the remains of the slain, making goblets\r\nof their skulls, and trinkets of their bones, this revolt is a\r\nheliograph of Dahomey, and Devildom daguerreotyped more vividly than by\r\nDante or Milton.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Secretary is clear, simple, comprehensive, practical,\r\nand effective. It is the plan of an uniform circulation, furnished by\r\nthe Federal Government to banking associations organized by Congress,\r\nsecuring prompt redemption by the deposit of the same amount of U.S. six\r\nper cent stock in the Federal custody, the principal and interest of\r\nthis stock being payable in gold. This plan, with me, is a necessity,\r\nand not a choice. It is the plan of the Secretary, and not mine, and is\r\ntherefore supported by me from no vanity of authorship. Nay, more, it\r\nrequired me to overcome strong prejudices against any bank circulation,\r\nand especially any connected in any way with the Government. It is,\r\nhowever, a strong recommendation of the plan of the Secretary, that the\r\nproposed connection of the banks with the Government is not political,\r\nand attended with none of the formidable objections to the late Bank of\r\nthe United States. Ever since the bank suspension of 1837, I have been a\r\nbullionist, and sustained that doctrine in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, and as Secretary of the Treasury. The act establishing the\r\nindependent treasury in 1846, was drawn by me, avowedly as a 'specie\r\nreceiving and _specie circulating_' institution, and to restrain\r\nexcessive issues by the banks; but it is impossible now to carry that\r\nsystem into practical execution. The suspension of specie payment by the\r\nbanks and the Government, has been forced by the enormous expenditures\r\nof the war, and the sub-treasury, which never was designed for the\r\ncustody or disbursement of paper, has been so far virtually superseded.\r\nIn acceding now, as in December, 1861, to the Secretary's plan of a bank\r\ncirculation, I must be understood as having changed my views in no\r\nrespect as to banks, but that I yield to the great emergency, which\r\nrenders the support of the war and of the Union paramount to any\r\nquestion of coin or currency.\r\n\r\nThe national disbursements for the present and succeeding fiscal year,\r\nas stated by the Secretary, together with his remarks on that subject,\r\nsupersede the necessity of any further argument in proof of the absolute\r\nimpossibility of specie payments now by the Government. We are compelled\r\nto resort to paper, and the only question is as to the character and\r\nextent of the issue. It is my opinion that we should limit this paper\r\ncurrency, as far as practicable, that it may be as little depreciated\r\nnow as possible; so that when the rebellion is crushed, the banks and\r\nthe Government may resume specie payments at the earliest moment. I\r\nfavor the plan of the Secretary mainly because, by arresting\r\ndepreciation, it would furnish a currency approaching specie now more\r\nnearly than can be accomplished in any other way, and because, when the\r\nwar is over, it provides the best means for a return, in the shortest\r\npossible period, to specie payments. An irredeemable paper currency\r\ndissolves contracts, violates good faith, and its history here and in\r\nEurope is a record of financial ruin, bankruptcy, and repudiation, of\r\nfrauds, crimes, and demoralization, which no friend of his country or\r\nrace can desire to witness. The issue of treasury notes as a legal\r\ntender was favored by me as a _necessity_ super-induced by the\r\nrebellion, and as a substitute for the present bank issues. Such notes\r\nwould be depreciated much less when made a legal tender, and, to that\r\nextent, our expenditures would be diminished, and specie payments could,\r\ntherefore, be resumed eventually at a much earlier period. Why, then, it\r\nis asked, not continue and extend that system, rather than adopt the\r\nplan recommended by the Secretary? Because, Congress refusing to\r\nprohibit a bank circulation, such increased issues of treasury notes\r\nwould cause a further great depreciation of such notes, to that extent\r\naugment our expenditures, and postpone, perhaps indefinitely, the\r\nresumption of specie payments. Gold now commands a premium of thirty-two\r\nper cent., payable in treasury notes; but, if such issues be increased\r\none half, they would fall to fifty per cent., and, if doubled, to at\r\nleast sixty per cent. below specie. At the last rate, if our yearly\r\nexpenditures, paid in paper, reached $700,000,000, this would command\r\nbut $280,000,000 in gold, thus subjecting the Government to a loss of\r\n$420,000,000 per annum, and at thirty-two per cent. discount,\r\n$224,000,000 per annum. These notes, it is true, bear no interest, which\r\nat six per cent. on $280,000,000, would save $16,800,000 a year. But as\r\nunder the Secretary's plan (hereafter developed) the Government would\r\nonly pay an annual interest of four per cent. on this loan, the saving\r\nwould only be $11,200,000. Deduct this interest thus saved from the\r\n$420,000,000 of increased annual expenditures, arising from such\r\ndepreciation of treasury notes, and the result is a net loss of\r\n$408,800,000 per annum to the Government, from the use of such redundant\r\nand depreciated currency. Surely, such a system would soon terminate in\r\nbankruptcy and repudiation, repeating the history of French assignats\r\nand Continental money.\r\n\r\nNor is it the Government only that suffers from such a disaster, but the\r\nruin extends to the people. There is no law more clearly established\r\nthan this: that the currency of a country bears a certain fixed\r\nproportion to its wealth and business. If we expand the currency beyond\r\nthis proportion, we violate this law, and will surely suffer the\r\nterrible penalties of this disobedience. This law is so certain and\r\ninvariable, that, if the expansion beyond this proportion should be even\r\nin specie, the result would still be disastrous.\r\n\r\nThis was illustrated during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, when\r\nSpain, having opened the virgin mines of America, brought the precious\r\nmetals in countless millions within her limits, and restricted their\r\nexportation by the most stringent penalties. And what was the\r\nconsequence? Mr. Prescott, of Boston, tells us in his great history,\r\nthat 'the streams of wealth, which flowed in from the silver quarries of\r\nZacatecas and Potosi were jealously locked up within the limits of the\r\nPeninsula.' 'The golden tide, which, permitted a free vent, would have\r\nfertilized the region through which it poured, now buried the land under\r\na deluge, which blighted every green and living thing. _Agriculture_,\r\n_commerce_, MANUFACTURES, every branch of national industry and\r\nimprovement, languished and fell to decay; and the nation, like the\r\nPhrygian monarch who turned all that he touched into gold, cursed by the\r\nvery consummation of its wishes, was poor in the midst of its\r\ntreasures.' Such was the effect of violating the law which regulates the\r\nratio of money to wealth; such the consequence of a superabundant\r\ncurrency, even in specie. The result was that Spain, which had been the\r\nmost prosperous nation of Europe, and whose products and manufactures\r\nhad supplied the markets of the world, lost nearly all her exports, and\r\nwas forced to resort to the prohibitory system. The cost of living, of\r\nworking farms, of manufacturing goods, of making and sailing ships,\r\nbecame so high in Spain, from her superabundant currency, that she was\r\nunable to compete with any other nation, was reduced to poverty, and\r\nnever began to recover until 'Spain changed her system, encouraged the\r\nexportation of the precious metals, and thus brought down her\r\nsuperabundant currency and inflated prices, and thus enabled Spanish\r\nindustry to supply the markets of the Peninsula and of the world.'\r\n_Then_, the distinguished historian tells us, 'the precious metals,\r\ninstead of flowing in so abundantly as to palsy the arm of industry,\r\nonly served to stimulate it, the foreign intercourse of the country was\r\nevery day more widely extended;' 'the flourishing condition of the\r\nnation was seen in the wealth and population of its cities,' etc. It is\r\na redundant currency, even if gold or convertible into gold, that\r\nproduces these evils, although depreciation adds to the disaster.\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect here of a redundant currency, is ascertained by\r\nreference to our exports. By Treasury Tables 20 and 21, our foreign\r\nimports consumed here in 1836-'7 rose to $168,233,675, being largely\r\nmore than double what they were in 1832 ($76,989,793), and nearly double\r\nthe consumption, _per capita_, which was $5.61 in 1832, and $10.93 in\r\n1836. This was our great year of a redundant, although still a\r\nconvertible currency, when our imports consumed exceeded our exports of\r\ndomestic produce, $61,662,733; and so enhanced was the cost of living\r\nand production here, that we actually imported breadstuffs that year of\r\nthe value of $5,271,576. (Table 1, Com. and Nav.) Our bank currency that\r\nyear was as follows: Circulation, $149,185,890; deposits, $127,397,185;\r\ncirculation and deposits, $276,583,075; loans, $525,115,702. (Treasury\r\nReport, 1838, Doc. 79, tables K. K.) The legitimate result of this\r\nexpansion of loans and currency was the great bank suspension of May,\r\n1837, and general bankruptcy throughout the country.\r\n\r\nNow our bank circulation in 1860 was $207,102,477; deposits,\r\n$253,802,129; circulation and deposits, $460,904,606; loans,\r\n$691,495,580. (Table 34, Census of 1860.) Yet our population in 1860 was\r\nmore than double that of 1837, and our wealth (the true barometer,\r\nmarking the proper rise and fall of our currency) had much more than\r\nquadrupled. (Census Table 35.) The proportion of the currency to wealth\r\nin 1837 was more than double the ratio of 1860. It was not the tariff\r\nthat produced the suspension of 1837, for it was _much lower_ in 1860,\r\nthan at the date of the bank suspension of 1837.\r\n\r\nBy Treasury Table 24, our total exports abroad of domestic produce,\r\nexclusive of specie, from the 30th of September, 1821, to 30th June,\r\n1861, were $5,060,929,667; and, in the year ending the 30th June, 1860,\r\nwere $316,242,423. At the same rate of increase from 1860 to 1870, as\r\nfrom 1850 to 1860, our domestic exports exclusive of specie in the\r\ndecade ending the 30th June, 1870, would have exceeded five billions of\r\ndollars, had peace continued and the currency been no more redundant in\r\nproportion to our wealth than in 1860. But with a redundant and\r\ndepreciated currency our exports must have been reduced at least one\r\nfourth. What would be the effect on every branch of our industry, may be\r\nlearned by looking at Treasury Table 40, showing our domestic exports\r\nfor the year ending 30th June, 1861. These exports were, of the products\r\nof our fisheries, $4,451,515; of the forest, $10,260,809; of\r\nagriculture, exclusive of cotton, rice, and tobacco, $100,273,655, and\r\nof our manufactures, $35,786,804. This was mainly from the loyal States.\r\nNow if the foreign markets for our products are reduced only one fourth\r\nby the effect of a redundant currency, inflating here the cost of\r\nproduction and of living, the result would be most disastrous to our\r\nindustry. The reduction would be equal, as we have seen, to $125,000,000\r\nper annum, and $1,250,000,000 in the decade. Our imports would be\r\nreduced in the same proportion, and our revenue from customs in a\r\ncorresponding ratio. Supposing the average rate of duties of the present\r\ntariff to be equal to 40 per cent. ad valorem, this would make a\r\ndifference in our revenue from customs of $500,000,000 in the decade,\r\nand, including interest not compounded, $635,000,000. And here I deem it\r\na duty to say to the financial portion of our peace party, especially in\r\nNew York, that our redundant and depreciated currency, with our failure\r\nto crush the rebellion, and a consequent dissolution of the Union, would\r\nmake repudiation inevitable. We are forced, then, by a due regard to our\r\nmaterial interests, as well as by the higher obligations of honor and\r\nduty, to subdue the revolt and restore the supremacy of the Government\r\nin every State. This we can and must do. It is due to our country and to\r\nthe world. It is due to the wounded and mutilated survivors of the\r\nbloody conflict, and to our martyred dead, murdered by the foulest\r\ntreason, and in the accursed cause of slavery. No! all this blood and\r\ntreasure must not have been poured out in vain. It is a question mainly\r\nof money and persistence. Our armies can and will conquer the rebellion,\r\nif we can and will supply the sinews of war. Our success is much more a\r\nfinancial than a military question. As regards the result, the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury holds now the most important post in this contest: he is\r\nthe generalissimo; and as he is right on this question, and the fate of\r\nthe Union is involved, I deem it my duty to give him my earnest and\r\nzealous support.\r\n\r\nRuinous as must be the effect of a redundant and depreciated currency\r\nupon all industrial pursuits, the injustice to our gallant army and\r\nnavy, regulars and volunteers, would be attended with extreme peril.\r\nUpon their courage and endurance we must rely for success. We have\r\npledged to our brave troops, who are wounded or dying by thousands that\r\nthe Union may live, such pay as to enable them while fighting our\r\nbattles to make allotments of portions of their money for the support of\r\ntheir families during their absence. We have promised pensions also.\r\nThese are all solemn pledges on the part of our Government, and our\r\nfaith is violated if this pay or these pensions are reduced. But there\r\nis no difference between a law directly reducing this pay and these\r\npensions, and the adoption by Congress of the policy of a redundant and\r\ndepreciated currency which will produce the same result. Every vote then\r\nin Congress for such a policy, is a vote to reduce the pay and pensions\r\nfor our troops, and to annihilate the allotments made by them for the\r\nsupport of their families. What effect such a policy must have on our\r\ntroops and the maintenance of the Union is but too palpable. It is\r\ndisbandment and dissolution. Every such vote is given also to reduce the\r\nvalue of the wages of labor, and for increased taxation, to the extent,\r\nas we have seen, of $408,800,000 per annum. It is a vote also to reduce\r\nour exports and revenue from customs, to paralyze our industry; and\r\nfinally, in its ultimate results, it is a vote against the war, for\r\nrepudiation and disunion, and hence every disunionist will oppose the\r\nplan of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nTo what extent this redundancy and depreciation will go, by enlarged\r\nissues of legal tender treasury notes, we may learn from the fact that\r\nthe banks substitute them for coin for the redemption of their paper.\r\nNow, just in proportion as the issue of treasury notes becomes redundant\r\nand depreciated, will the bank circulation, redeemable in such notes,\r\naugment and depreciate also. This is the law of bank circulation as now\r\nforced upon us by Congress. It is the law of redundancy and\r\ndepreciation. If this policy is adopted by Congress, an enlarged issue\r\nmade of treasury notes, and the plan of the Secretary discarded, our\r\nbank and treasury note circulation, with the war continued, will very\r\nlargely exceed one billion of dollars before the close of the next\r\nfiscal year, and both will be depreciated much more than sixty per cent.\r\nThus, if we should enlarge our issues of legal demand treasury notes to\r\n$500,000,000, and these be made the basis of bank issues, in the ratio\r\nof three to one, our total paper circulation would be $2,000,000,000,\r\nsuch treasury notes inflating the bank issues, and both depreciating\r\ntogether. And yet this is the currency in which it is proposed to\r\nconduct the war and the business of the country. The banks alone, by\r\nexcessive loans and issues, would grow rich apparently, on the ruin of\r\ntheir country. But there would be a terrible retribution. The result\r\nwould be general insolvency and repudiation, _the debts due the banks\r\nwould become worthless_, and they be involved in the general ruin. It is\r\nthen the interest of the banks to sustain the Government and the\r\nSecretary, and to transfer their capital to the new associations. This\r\nis especially the case with the New York banks, which, under a provision\r\nof their State constitution, HAVE NO LEGAL EXISTENCE. When repudiation\r\nand bankruptcy become general, the cry, like that of a routed army in a\r\npanic flight, would be raised, _Sauve qui peut_; we may have again an\r\nold and a new court party, especially under our miserable system of an\r\nelective judiciary; and the banks be crushed by wicked legal devices, as\r\nthey were in the West and Southwest in 1824 and 1838.\r\n\r\nReferring to bank issues, the Secretary says, in his last report: 'It\r\nwas only when the United States notes, having been made a legal tender,\r\nwere diverted from their legitimate use as a currency, and made the\r\nbasis of bank circulation, that the great increase of the latter began.'\r\nAt the present depreciation of these treasury notes, it is better for\r\nthe banks, by one third, to redeem their circulation in these notes,\r\nrather than in specie; and they need keep only one dollar of treasury\r\nnotes for three of bank circulation. This is the policy forced upon the\r\nbanks by Congress. But the more redundant and depreciated this currency\r\nbecomes, the easier will it be for the banks to provide the basis of\r\nredemption, and expand their circulation in the ratio, like that of\r\nspecie, of three dollars of bank currency for each dollar of treasury\r\nnotes held by them. Thus it is that the enlarged issue of treasury notes\r\nnecessarily increases the bank circulation, in the ratio of three to\r\none, and thus also, that the circulation of bank and treasury notes\r\nbecomes redundant and depreciated. Under such a policy, every bank then,\r\nhowever loyal its stockholders or officers, becomes a citadel, whose\r\nartillery bears with more fearful effect upon the Government than all\r\nthe armies of the rebellion. This will soon become obvious, and the\r\nodium will rest upon the banks, their officers and stockholders. But the\r\nreal responsibility will be with Congress, who, by such a system will\r\nhave arrayed the banks in necessary and inevitable hostility to the\r\nGovernment. Such, we all know, is not the intention of Congress; but as\r\nthis result will necessarily flow from their measures, upon them, in the\r\nend, will fall the terrible responsibility of the disaster. It is this\r\nappalling condition of our finances that gives the rebellion its only\r\nhope of success, and invites foreign intervention. But if Congress will\r\nadopt the policy of the Secretary, they will render certain the triumph\r\nof the Union, and the rebels, from despair and exhaustion, must soon\r\nabandon the contest.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how dreadful is the disaster which the banks would bring on\r\nthe country by pursuing the present system, and how terrible the odium\r\nto which they would be subjected. But now let us look at the result, if\r\nthe plan of the Secretary is adopted. The new banks would become fiscal\r\nagents of the Government. Their circulation would be uniform, furnished\r\nby the Government, and based on U. S. stocks, the principal and interest\r\nof which would be payable in gold. The interest of labor and capital, of\r\nthe banks, the Government, and the people, would for the first time\r\nbecome inseparably united and consolidated. This is a grand result, and\r\nfraught with momentous consequences to the country. Every citizen,\r\nwhether a stockholder of the banks or not, would have a direct and\r\nincalculable interest in their success and prosperity. They, the people,\r\nwould have this interest, not merely as holding the notes of the banks,\r\nwhich would become our currency, but because the banks would hold the\r\nstock of the Government, would have loaned it in this way the money to\r\nsuppress the rebellion, and thus have saved us from a redundant and\r\ndepreciated currency, from inevitable bankruptcy and repudiation, and\r\nhave prevented the overthrow of the Union. Each bank would then become a\r\ncitadel over which should float the flag of the Union, for each bank\r\nwould then become a powerful auxiliary for the support of the Government\r\nand the overthrow of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe bill divorcing the banks and the Government was drawn by me, as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, in 1846, to enlarge the circulation of\r\nspecie, and restrain excessive issues of bank paper. I go for the\r\nreunion now, as proposed by the Secretary, to enable the Government to\r\neffect loans upon their stock, to prevent a redundant and depreciated\r\npaper currency, with a correspondent increase of expenditures, and to\r\nprovide the means, when the war is over, to resume specie payment at the\r\nearliest practicable period. I was for restraining excessive paper\r\nissues then, and so am I now, as far as possible. I carried into full\r\neffect then the divorce of the Government and the banks, against a\r\nterrible opposition from them and the great Whig party. I made the\r\ndivorce complete, _a vinculo matrimonii_: so now I would make the union\r\ncomplete, so far as proposed by the Secretary, for the interest of the\r\nbanks and the Government would be united, and just as you strengthened\r\nthe banks and increased their capital and profits, would you fund more\r\nand more treasury notes, and save us from the ruin of a redundant and\r\ndepreciated currency.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary proposes to make these banks depositories of treasury\r\nnotes, received by the Government for all dues except customs. This is\r\nwell; for to use the sub-treasury to receive and circulate treasury\r\nnotes, is against the object for which it was created. Such deposits\r\nshould be secured by U. S. stocks with the Government, and thus largely\r\nincrease the demand for this stock. During nearly my first two years as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, the public moneys were deposited by me in the\r\nState banks, secured by United States and State stocks, and there was no\r\nloss. Nor, indeed, was there any loss or default by any officer, agent,\r\nor employe of the Treasury Department during my entire term of four\r\nyears, notwithstanding the large loans and war expenditures.\r\n\r\nDisbursing officers should also deposit with the banks, and pay as\r\nformerly by checks on them, with the same guarantee by them of U. S.\r\nstocks. How far, and to what extent, and under what special provisions\r\nthe gold received for customs might be deposited with these banks, may\r\nbe the subject of discussion hereafter.\r\n\r\nIf this system were adopted in its entirety, the process of absorbing\r\ntreasury notes would commence at once, and also a correspondent rise in\r\ntheir market value. The system of loans and funding saved England from\r\nbankruptcy during her long wars with France, and we must resort to\r\nsimilar expedients. But as loans, in the usual way, except at ruinous\r\ndiscounts, for any large amounts, are impracticable, we are left to the\r\nalternative of the Secretary's system, or bankruptcy, repudiation, and\r\ndisunion.\r\n\r\nI have another suggestion to make as regards these notes furnished by\r\nthe Government to the banks, secured by U. S. stocks. These notes are\r\nguaranteed not only by the stock of the Government, but, in addition, by\r\nthe whole capital and property, real and personal, of the banks, and a\r\nprior lien on the whole to the Government, to secure the payment of\r\nthese notes. These notes are receivable by the Government for all dues\r\nexcept customs. These notes are a national currency, furnished by the\r\nnation and secured by its stock.\r\n\r\nThese notes then, as in England, should be a legal tender in payment of\r\nall debts, except by the banks. As the banks can redeem these issues in\r\nlegal tender treasury notes, these issues of the new banks ought to be a\r\nlegal tender also, except by the banks.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why this currency should be made a legal tender.\r\nOur two last suspensions of specie payments by the banks, viz., in 1857\r\nand in 1860, were based upon _panics_, yet they had the same disastrous\r\neffect, for the time, as if arising from short crops, overtrading, or a\r\ncurrency greatly redundant. Such panic convulsions are caused mainly by\r\nthe call for the redemption of bank notes in specie, based on the fear\r\nof suspension and depreciation. But if such notes, as in European\r\ngovernment banks, were a legal tender, except by the banks, such panics\r\nwould be far less frequent here, and less injurious. The present system,\r\nas compared with that of Europe, discriminates most unjustly against our\r\ncountry. As a general rule, the American creditor cannot demand gold\r\nfrom the foreign debtor, but such foreign or domestic creditor could\r\nalways demand gold from the American debtor. This discrimination has\r\nproduced here the most disastrous consequences, and, independent of the\r\npresent condition of the country, our whole banking system requires\r\nradical reform. We have had eight _general_ bank suspensions under our\r\npresent bank system, many of them continuing for years, and producing\r\nruin and desolation. Under our present system, to talk, as a general\r\nrule, of well-regulated banks, is to talk of a well-regulated famine or\r\npestilence, or of a well-regulated earthquake or tornado. And even the\r\nfew banks that are claimed to be well managed, have no appreciable\r\neffect on the system. It is the system that knows no uniformity or\r\nsecurity, and never can have, as now organized. That a system so\r\nperilous and explosive, should have even partially succeeded is proof\r\nonly of the intelligence and integrity, generally, of the bank officers\r\nand directors, but no recommendation of the system itself.\r\n\r\nThe want of uniformity as to commercial regulations, led to the adoption\r\nof our Federal Constitution; and yet we have no uniformity as to money,\r\nwhich represents commerce and effects its interchanges. In this respect,\r\nwe are still suffering all the evils of the old confederacy, and have\r\nthereby so weakened the Government as to have invited this rebellion.\r\nIndeed, the State banks in the revolted States were the main auxiliaries\r\nof treason and secession, and supplied, to a vast extent, the sinews of\r\nwar. By Census Table 34, there were in 1860, 1,642 banks, incorporated\r\nby thirty-four States, with no uniformity of organization, issues, or\r\nsecurity. Thus is it that the States have usurped the power to regulate\r\ncommerce and currency, and to emit bills of credit, in defiance of the\r\nprohibition of the Federal Constitution. The Egyptians abandoned their\r\nfolly after seven plagues; but we have had eight bank convulsions, and\r\nyet we adhere to the wretched system.\r\n\r\nI believe it was slavery caused the rebellion, but, in the absence of\r\npowerful aid from the Southern banks, the revolted States could never\r\nhave maintained so prolonged a contest. Organized as now proposed, these\r\nnew banks, and all who held their notes, must have sustained the\r\nGovernment. Nations expend millions yearly in erecting forts and\r\nmaintaining, even in peace, large armies and navies to preserve the\r\nGovernment. But necessary as these may be, they would not be more\r\nimportant than the system now proposed as a security for the\r\npreservation of the Government.\r\n\r\nMy last suggestion is, that as regards all such United States loans, as\r\nduring the war shall become the basis of this system, the time of\r\npayment shall be made twenty years instead of five, so as, with the\r\nmodifications above proposed, to insure the cooperation of the banks,\r\nand the success of the system. As this plan is deemed essential to save\r\nour finances, to suppress the rebellion, and maintain the Union, why\r\nincur any hazard on such a question as this? In all our wars, including\r\nthe present, we have issued bonds running twenty years to maturity, and\r\nthe bonds, redeemable in 1881, are scarcely at par. Why, then, issue a\r\nstock of less value, which may fail to accomplish the great object, when\r\na better security would certainly succeed? I fully agree in the opinion\r\nexpressed by the Secretary, against 'a fixed interest of six per cent.\r\non a great debt, for twenty years,' if it can be avoided; but I also\r\nconcur in that portion of his report in which he says: 'No very early\r\nday will probably witness the reduction of the public debt to the amount\r\nrequired as a basis for secured circulation.' To that extent, then,\r\nwould I enlarge the time for the maturity of the bonds. Surely, if this\r\nbe necessary to secure the cooperation of the banks, and the capital of\r\nthe country, there should be no hesitation. Even if the system, based\r\nonly on the bonds of short date, should ultimately succeed, the loss, in\r\nthe interim, from a redundant and depreciated currency, would far exceed\r\nany benefit derived from the substitution of five-twenties for twenty\r\nyear bonds. By Census Table 35, our wealth in 1850, was $7,135,780,228,\r\nand in 1860, $16,159,616,068, the ratio of increase during the decade\r\nbeing 126.45 per cent.; at which rate, our wealth in 1870 would be\r\n$36,583,450,585, and in 1880, $82,843,222,849. Surely, then, at these\r\nperiods, it would be much easier to liquidate this debt than in 1867.\r\nBut, were it otherwise, the immediate gain from decreased expenditures,\r\narising from funding more rapidly our treasury notes, thus rendering our\r\ncurrency less redundant and depreciated, with the revival of the public\r\ncredit, and its immediate happy influence, North and South, here and in\r\nEurope, would far more than compensate for any contingent advantage\r\narising from short loans. Our twenty years' loan is now barely at par,\r\nand the five-twenties below par. The difficulty of inducing bank and\r\nother capital to invest hundreds of millions of dollars under the new\r\nsystem is very great. Is it wise to commence the effort, confined to our\r\nweakest securities, now below par? Besides, considering the old and new\r\ndebts, and constantly increasing responsibilities, is there any prospect\r\nthat we will have liquidated all these before the end of five years, and\r\nthe five-twenty loan also? Surely, upon a benefit so doubtful, and a\r\ncontingency so improbable, we ought not to risk the fate of a measure on\r\nwhich depends the safety of the Union. But if we could pay off the\r\nfive-twenty loan held by the new banks, is it prudent to assume that so\r\nmany hundred millions of capital will be withdrawn from the present\r\nbanks and other business for investment in the new banks, which may\r\ncease at the end of five years by payment of the bonds? The change from\r\nthe old to the new banks may involve some loss at first, but, if the\r\nsystem may be arrested at the end of five years, just when profits might\r\nbe realizing, the plan could scarcely succeed. When the Secretary first\r\nproposed this system in December, 1861, he probably would have succeeded\r\nwith the five-twenties, in the condition at that date of the public\r\ncredit. But the disastrous fall of our securities since that date, seems\r\nnow to require bonds of a higher value.\r\n\r\nI would then provide a twenty years loan, for all that may be made the\r\nbasis of the new bank circulation. But it is not a six, but only a four\r\nper cent. twenty years' loan that is proposed, by deducting one per\r\ncent. semi-annually from the interest of the bonds made the basis of\r\nthis bank circulation. This deduction would only be a fair equivalent\r\nfor the expenses incurred by the Government in furnishing the\r\ncirculation, for the release of taxes, for the deposit of public moneys\r\nwith these banks, for making their notes a legal tender, and receiving\r\nthem for all dues except customs. The tax on all other bank circulation\r\nshould be one and a half per cent. semi-annually, secured by adequate\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nIf, under this system, during this stupendous rebellion, involving the\r\nexistence of the Government, with armies and expenditures unexampled in\r\nhistory, the Secretary (as, with the aid of Congress and the banks, I\r\nbelieve he can) should secure us a sound and uniform currency, and\r\nnegotiate vast loans, running twenty years, at par, the Government\r\npaying only four per cent. interest per annum, he will have accomplished\r\na financial miracle, and deserved a fame nearest to that of the first\r\nand greatest of his predecessors, the peerless Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe bill organizing the new system, presented in Congress by Mr. Hooper\r\nlast summer, is drawn with great ability, and it is much to be deplored,\r\nthat (with some amendments) it had not then become a law, when it could\r\nhave been much more easily put in operation, and would have saved\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars to the Government.\r\n\r\nBut the fifty-fifth section of that bill provides that all the banks\r\norganized under it are to become 'depositaries of the public moneys,'\r\nexcepting those in 'the city of Washington.' Why this discrimination? If\r\nthere be any place where banks, organized under a national charter,\r\nissuing a national currency, and receiving national deposits, should be\r\nencouraged, it is here. With no discrimination against them, such banks\r\nwould be established here with considerable capital. And why not? It\r\ncannot be intended to discourage the establishment of such banks here,\r\nand thus defeat, to that extent, the success of the system. It is here,\r\nif anywhere, that such banks should receive the public deposits, where\r\nthey could be constantly secured from day to day under the immediate\r\nsupervision of the Government. Besides, the only effect of such a\r\ndiscrimination would be to drive such banks to Georgetown, Alexandria,\r\nor some other speculative site outside the city or District. This city\r\nhas just been consecrated to freedom by Congress, and it is hoped that,\r\nin commencing its new career, no discrimination will be made against it.\r\nIndeed, I think it would be wise, in order to insure the success here of\r\nthe new system, to allow the district banks organized under this law to\r\nreceive the same rate of interest as is permitted in New York.\r\n\r\nI have contended, during the last fourth of a century, that all State\r\nbank currency is unconstitutional. This rebellion will demonstrate the\r\ntruth of that proposition, and the question ultimately be so decided by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States. This, it is true, might require\r\nsome of those Judges, if then living, to change their opinion on some\r\npoints; but this has been done before, and even on constitutional\r\nquestions; and State banks will fall before judicial action, as well as\r\nnullification, State allegiance, secession, and the whole brood of\r\nkindred heresies.\r\n\r\nA republic which cannot regulate its currency, or which leaves that\r\npower with thirty-four separate States, each legislating at its pleasure\r\nand without uniformity, abandons an essential national authority, and\r\nthis abdication has furnished one of the main supports of the rebellion.\r\nWith nothing but a national currency, the revolted States never could\r\nhave successfully inaugurated this war, and we must deprive them in all\r\ntime to come of this terrible ally of treason. To permit the States to\r\nprovide the circulating medium, the money of the country, is to enable\r\nthem to furnish the sinews of war, and clothe them with a power to\r\noverthrow the Government.\r\n\r\nWith only such a national currency as is now proposed, issued by the\r\nGovernment to these banks, organized by Congress, and based on the\r\ndeposit in the Federal treasury of United States stock, the rebellion\r\nwould have been impossible. Our Government was so mild and benignant,\r\nthat we deemed it exempt from the assault of traitors; but this revolt\r\nhas dissipated this delusion, and warned us to provide all the\r\nsafeguards indicated by experience as necessary to maintain the Union.\r\nAmong the most important is the resumption by the Government of the\r\ngreat sovereign function of regulating the currency and giving to it\r\nuniformity and nationality. Such was clearly the intention of the\r\nConstitution. The Government has, by the Constitution, the _exclusive_\r\npower 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several\r\nStates.' But commerce is _regulated_ mainly by money, and by it all\r\ninterstate and international exchanges of products are made. If the\r\ncurrency is redundant, prices rise, exports are diminished; and the\r\nreverse follows with a contracted circulation. But banks inflate or\r\nrestrict the currency at their pleasure, and thus control prices,\r\ncommerce, exports, imports, and revenue. But they also destroy or\r\ndepreciate the money of the Government, and deprive it of a vital power.\r\nThus, the nation issues treasury notes, and makes them a legal tender:\r\nthe banks immediately make such notes the basis of bank issues, in the\r\nratio of three to one, and the whole currency necessarily becomes\r\nredundant and depreciated; and thus this essential power of the\r\nGovernment is controlled by the States, and, for all practical purposes,\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Marshall, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States (4 Wheaton 193), said: 'Wherever the\r\nterms in which a power is granted to Congress, or the nature of the\r\npower require that it should be exercised exclusively by Congress, the\r\nsubject is as completely taken from the State Legislatures as if they\r\nhad been forbidden to act on it.' Now, it has been decided by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States (9 Wheaton 1) that, this power to\r\n_regulate commerce_ extends to the _land_, as well as to the _water_,\r\nthat it includes _intercourse and navigation_, and vessels, as vehicles\r\nof commerce, that it includes an _embargo_ which is prohibitory, that\r\nthis power is 'EXCLUSIVELY vested in Congress,' and '_no part of it can\r\nbe exercised by a State_.' Now, the question, whether the notes of a\r\nState bank, issued on the authority of a State, and designed to\r\ncirculate as money, conflicts with _this clause_ of the Constitution,\r\nhas _never been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States_. This\r\nis a new and momentous question, never yet adjudicated by the Supreme\r\nCourt; but how they would now decide that point, with the light thrown\r\nupon it by this rebellion, I cannot doubt.\r\n\r\nThe Government also has the sole power to lay and collect _duties_,\r\nwhich 'shall be uniform throughout the United States,' and the States\r\nare prohibited from exercising this authority. But this power also is in\r\nfact controlled by the banks, and the revenue from imports increased or\r\ndiminished, according to their action. Indeed, they can modify or repeal\r\ntariffs at their pleasure, for, they have only to inflate the\r\ncirculation, and prices rise here to the extent of the duties, and the\r\ntariff becomes inoperative. Of all the branches of our industry, the\r\nmanufacturing is injured most by a redundant currency, limiting our\r\nfabrics to a partial supply at home, and driving them from the foreign\r\nmarket. Give us a sound, stable, uniform currency, sufficient but not\r\nredundant, and our skilled, educated, and intelligent labor will, in\r\ntime, defy all competition. But the banks, as now conducted, are the\r\ngreat enemies of American industry.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also the _sole_ power 'to coin money, regulate the\r\nvalue thereof,' etc. But the banks now regulate its value by controlling\r\nprices, by substituting their money for coin, and by expelling it from\r\nthe country at their pleasure. Recollect, these powers over commerce and\r\nmoney are _exclusive_, not concurrent, so adjudicated, and the\r\nConstitution, in delegating them exclusively to the Government, withheld\r\nthem altogether from the States. The conceded fact that these powers are\r\n_exclusive_, proves that the States cannot, by any instrumentality,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, control their exercise. An exclusive authority\r\nnecessarily forbids any control or interference. But there are express\r\nprohibitions in the Constitution as well as grants. That instrument\r\ndeclares that 'no _State_ shall emit _bills of credit_.' The State\r\nitself cannot emit circulating paper: how then can it authorize this to\r\nbe done by a State corporation, which is the mere creature of a State\r\nlaw? The State cannot authorize its _Governor_ to issue such paper: how\r\nthen can it direct a _cashier_, deriving all his power only from a State\r\nlaw, to do the same thing? _Qui facit per alium, facit per se_, and this\r\nfundamental maxim of law and reason is violated when a State does\r\nthrough any instrumentality, created by it, what the State cannot do\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a majority of the Supreme Court of the United States, in\r\n11 Peters 257, did decide that the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky\r\ndid not violate that clause of the Constitution forbidding States to\r\n'emit bills of credit,' but Justice Story, in his dissenting opinion,\r\nsaid: 'When this cause was formerly argued before this court, a majority\r\nof the judges who then heard it were decidedly of opinion that the act\r\nof Kentucky establishing this bank was unconstitutional and void, as\r\namounting to an authority to emit bills of credit, for and on behalf of\r\nthe State, within the prohibition of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. In principle, it was thought to be decided by the case of Craig\r\n_v._ the State of Missouri (4 Peters 410). Among that majority was the\r\nlate Chief Justice Marshall.' This decision, then, in the case of the\r\nBank of Kentucky, is overthrown, _as an authority_, by the fact that it\r\nwas against the decision of the Supreme Court in a former case, and\r\nagainst the opinion of a majority of the court in that very case before\r\nthe death of Chief Justice Marshall. In delivering the opinion of the\r\ncourt in the Missouri case (4 Peters 410), Chief Justice Marshall\r\ndefined what is that _bill of credit_ which a _State cannot emit_. He\r\nsays: 'If the prohibition means anything, if the words are not empty\r\nsounds, it must comprehend the emission of _any paper medium_ by a State\r\nGovernment, for the purpose of _common circulation_.' And he also says:\r\n'Bills of credit signify a _paper medium_, intended to _circulate_\r\nbetween individuals, and between Government and individuals, for the\r\nordinary purposes of society.' That the notes of the Bank of Kentucky\r\ncame within this definition and decision, is clearly stated by Justice\r\nStory. In that case also it was expressly decided, that if the issues be\r\nunconstitutional, _the notes given for the loan of them_ ARE VOID. It is\r\nsaid, however, that the bills are issued by a bank, not by the State;\r\nbut the bank is created by the State, and authorized by the State to\r\nissue these notes, to circulate as money. In the language of Chief\r\nJustice Marshall, in this case, 'And can this make any real difference?\r\nIs the proposition to be maintained that the Constitution meant to\r\nprohibit names and not things?' On this subject, Justice Story says:\r\n'That a State may rightfully evade the prohibitions of the Constitution\r\nby acting through the _instrumentality of agents_ in the evasion,\r\ninstead of acting in its _own direct name_, is a doctrine to which I can\r\nnever subscribe,' etc. I am conscious that Justice Story also said in\r\nthe same case, _arguendo_: 'the States may create banks as well as other\r\ncorporations, upon _private capital_; and, SO FAR AS THIS PROHIBITION IS\r\nCONCERNED, may rightfully authorize them to issue bank bills or notes as\r\ncurrency, subject always to the _control of Congress_, whose powers\r\nextend to the _entire regulation of the currency of the country_.' It\r\nwill be observed, that Justice Story gives no opinion as to whether the\r\nissues of such banks are constitutional, whether they conflict or not\r\nwith the power of Congress to regulate coin or commerce. He only says\r\n(and the limitation is most significant), they do not violate the\r\nprohibition as to bills of credit (from which I dissent); but he does\r\ndeclare that to Congress belongs '_the entire regulation of the\r\ncurrency_.' Now this power must rest on the authority of Congress to\r\nregulate coin and commerce. But these powers, we have seen, were not\r\nconcurrent, but _exclusive_; and, in the language of Chief Justice\r\nMarshall, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court in\r\nthe case before quoted from 4 Wheaton 193, as to any such power that\r\n'should be exercised _exclusively_ by Congress, the subject is as\r\n_completely_ taken from the State Legislature as if they had been\r\n_forbidden to act on it_.' All then who agree that Congress has 'the\r\nentire regulation of the currency,' must admit that all banks of issue\r\nincorporated by States are unconstitutional, not because such issues are\r\nbills of credit, but because they violate the exclusive authority of\r\nCongress to regulate commerce, coin, and its value. I repeat, that while\r\nthis question has never been adjudicated by the Supreme Court, yet, if\r\ntheir decision in fourth and ninth Wheaton is maintained, such bank\r\nissues are clearly unconstitutional. It is clear, also, whatever may be\r\nthe case of bank issues, based only 'upon private capital,' or, in the\r\nlanguage of Judge Story, 'if the corporate stock, and that only by the\r\ncharter, is made liable for the debts of the bank,' yet, if the bank\r\nissues are based on the 'funds' or 'credit' of the State, such issues do\r\nviolate the prohibition against bills of credit. Such bank issues, then,\r\nas are furnished and countersigned by State officers, acting under State\r\nlaws, and are secured by the deposit with the State of its own stock,\r\nare most clearly unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn No. 44 (by Hamilton) of the _Federalist_, the great contemporaneous\r\nexposition of the Constitution (prepared by Hamilton, Madison, and Chief\r\nJustice Jay of the Supreme Court of the United States), it is said: 'The\r\nsame reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power\r\nof regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at\r\nliberty to substitute a paper medium instead of coin.' Such was the\r\nopinion of the two great founders of the Constitution (Hamilton and\r\nMadison), and its first judicial expositor, the eminent Chief Justice\r\nJay. Justice Story quotes and approves this remarkable passage, and says\r\n'that the prohibition was aimed at a _paper medium_ which was intended\r\nto _circulate as money_, and to that alone.'\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 3, 1816, President Madison, referring\r\nexpressly to a _bank_ and _paper_ medium, said: 'It is essential that\r\nthe nation should possess a currency of equal value, credit, and use,\r\nwherever it may circulate. The Constitution has entrusted Congress\r\n_exclusively_ with the power of _creating_ and _regulating_ a currency\r\nof that description.'\r\n\r\nThis rebellion proves the awful danger of State violations of the\r\nFederal Constitution. The rebellion is the child of State usurpation,\r\nState supremacy, State allegiance, and State secession. And now the\r\nGovernment is paralyzed financially, in its efforts to suppress the\r\nrebellion, by a question as to State banks, depreciating the currency,\r\nand State banks based on State stocks. The Government wishes a currency,\r\nnot redundant, and to borrow money to save the Union. But one State\r\nsays, we have placed all our surplus money in State banks, and another\r\nState (as in the case of New York) says, we have based the circulation\r\nof these banks, mainly on our own State bonds, and you must do nothing\r\nwhich will injuriously affect their value. It is true the Union is in\r\ndanger, but are not the credit of State banks and State bonds of higher\r\nvalue than the Union? The State first, the Union afterwards. Our\r\nparamount duty is to our State, and that to the Union is subordinate.\r\nWhy, this is the very language of rebellion--the echo of South Carolina\r\ntreason. But it is not the language of the Constitution, which declares\r\nthat \"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall\r\nbe made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be\r\nmade, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law\r\nof the land: and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\r\nanything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe _supremacy_ then, is with the Federal Constitution and laws;\r\notherwise there could be no uniformity or nationality. And does New York\r\nsuppose that she can tear down the temple of the Union, and that the\r\nprincipal pillar which supported the arch will stand firm and erect? No!\r\nif the Union falls, New York will only be the most conspicuous among the\r\nbroken columns.\r\n\r\nBut New York knows that the path of interest is that of honor and of\r\nduty. It is the Union only that has made her great. It is the\r\nconcentration by the Union of interstate and international commerce in\r\nher great city, that was consummating its imperial destiny. Before the\r\nUnion of 1778 and 1787, New York city was the village of Manhattan:\r\ndestroy the Union, and she will again become little more than the\r\nvillage of Manhattan. The trident of the ocean, the sceptre of the\r\nworld's commerce would fall from her grasp, and London be left without a\r\nrival. Deprive the Government of the power to regulate commerce, and the\r\nfall of New York will be as rapid as her rise. Each State then, as\r\nbefore the Constitution, would control its own commerce, and the\r\nrailroads and canals of New York would cease to be the vehicles of the\r\ntrade of the nation and of the world. Each State, as under the old\r\nConfederacy, would force commerce into her own ports by prohibitory or\r\ndiscriminating statutes. No, when New York takes from the Union the\r\nexclusive control of commerce, she commits suicide. One uniform\r\nregulation of commerce, and one uniform currency, are more essential to\r\nthe prosperity of New York than to that of any other State. New York\r\nrepresents interstate and international commerce. There are concentrated\r\nour imports and exports, and there three fourths of our revenue is\r\ncollected. There, if the Union endures, must be the centre of the\r\ncommerce of the nation and of the world. If the rebellion succeeds, the\r\nseparation of the East and West is just as certain as that of the North\r\nand South. Discord would reign supreme, and States and parts of States\r\nbecome petty sovereignties, mere pawns, to be moved on the political\r\nchess board by the kings and queens of Europe.\r\n\r\nAs New York has derived the greatest benefits from the Union, so would\r\nshe suffer most from its fall. It is New York to whom the Union\r\ntransferred the command of her own commerce, and ultimately that of the\r\nworld. It is New York to which England looks as the future successful\r\nrival of London, and it is New York at whom England chiefly aims the\r\nblow in desiring to overthrow the Union. The interest of New York in the\r\nprice of bank or State stock is insignificant compared with her still\r\ngreater stake in the success of the Union. Indeed, if the Union should\r\nfall, State and bank stock and all property will be of little value, and\r\nbank debts will generally become worthless.\r\n\r\nBut if the war continues, we have seen that a redundant and depreciated\r\ncurrency would increase our expenditures $408,800,000 per annum. This\r\nwould require a like addition to our annual tax, of which the share of\r\nNew York would be over $50,000,000, and the share of every other State\r\nin like proportion to its population.\r\n\r\nBy Treasury Table 35, the stocks, State and Federal, held by the New\r\nYork banks in 1860, was $29,605,318, the circulation $28,239,950, and\r\nthe capital $111,821,957. Thus it appears that the increased tax to be\r\npaid _annually_ by New York, as the consequence of a redundant and\r\ndepreciated currency, would be nearly double her whole bank circulation,\r\nand that thirteen months of this increased tax to be paid by the nation,\r\nwould largely exceed the whole capital of all the banks of the United\r\nStates in 1860. (Census Table 35.) These are the frightful results of an\r\nirredeemable, redundant, and depreciated currency.\r\n\r\nSuch a course, on the part of a Government, which must make large\r\npurchases, resembles that of an individual who wishes to buy largely on\r\nhis own credit and paper, but depreciates it so much as to compel him to\r\npay quadruple prices, the result being bankruptcy and repudiation.\r\n\r\nThere is great hope in the fact that New York takes no contracted view\r\nof this great question. She knows that her imperial destiny is\r\nidentified with the fate of the Union. Realizing this great truth, she\r\nhas more troops in the field than any other State, she has expended more\r\nmoney and more blood than any other State to suppress this rebellion,\r\nand she will never array State stocks or State banks in hostility to the\r\nsafety of the Union.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Pennsylvania, that glorious old Commonwealth, so many of\r\nwhose noble sons, cut off mostly in the morning of life, now fill graves\r\nprepared by treason? Is she to become a border State, and her southern\r\nboundary the line of blood, marked by frowning forts, by bristling\r\nbayonets, by the tramp of contending armies, engaged in the carnival of\r\nslaughter, and revelry of death? Is New England to be re-colonized, and\r\nthe British flag again to float over the chosen domain of freedom? What\r\nof the small States, deprived of the secured equality and protective\r\nguarantees of the Constitution, to be surely crushed by more powerful\r\ncommunities? What of the West? Is it to be cut off from the seaboard,\r\nand rendered tributary to the maritime power? What of the States of the\r\nPacific? Are they to lose the great imperial railways destined, under\r\nthe Union, to connect them with the valley of the Mississippi and the\r\nAtlantic? But alas! why look at any of the bleeding and mutilated\r\nfragments, when all will be involved in a common ruin?\r\n\r\nMay a gracious Providence give us all, the wisdom to discern what is\r\nbest for our beloved country, in this her day of fearful trial, and the\r\ncourage and patriotism to adopt whatever course is best calculated to\r\nsave us from impending ruin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIP TO ANTIETAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great battle of the Antietam had been fought, and a veteran army was\r\ngathered around Harper's Ferry recruiting for fresh campaigns. Here was\r\na chance to see a battle field and warriors to be celebrated for all\r\ntime. From childhood up we have been taught history; and all history,\r\nexcept some few dry constitutional treatises, has been accounts of great\r\ncommanders, of the marches and retreats of bronzed soldiers, of empires\r\nwon by the sword, of dynasties established by conquests. Our hymn book,\r\nour clergymen, and our Bible have exhorted us to be soldiers of the\r\ncross, to buckle on our armor, and to fight the good fight, even when\r\nturning the other cheek when smitten on the one. Now this opportunity to\r\nsee actual history, a battle field, and veteran troops, and great\r\nleaders whose names are to be household words, could not be resisted;\r\nso, taking a couple of blankets apiece, and a few clothes, and money\r\nwherewith to pay our way, we started by rail for Baltimore, and thence\r\nfor the army.\r\n\r\nAround Baltimore were several regiments. Those that we visited were of\r\nthe recent levies, and were improving fast in discipline and drill. They\r\nwere placed in strong positions to prevent a rebel attack from the west,\r\nand to command the city. The stars and stripes floated over houses in\r\nall parts of the town. We met a little company of boys seven miles out\r\nplaying soldier, with the star-spangled banner, a cheering sign of the\r\nloyalty of the place.\r\n\r\nAt Baltimore my friend and I took seats in the car for Harper's Ferry.\r\nThe train was crowded with a most miscellaneous set of passengers,\r\nofficers of all grades, from general with stars to second lieutenant\r\nwith plain bands, common soldiers, sutlers, Jews, and country people.\r\nSome of the Jews, after a time, became the most noisy part of the crowd,\r\nand belied their proverbial reputation for shrewdness by imbibing from\r\nbottles, which they circulated very freely, becoming very talkative, and\r\nmost decidedly drunk. The most interesting companion we met was a member\r\nof the Maryland House of Representatives, a very sensible man, and of\r\ncourse a strong Unionist. He did not approve of the President's\r\nemancipation proclamation; thought it would alienate Union men in the\r\nBorder States, and made other objections to it. He informed us that his\r\nnegroes were of no profit to him; that the proclamation had made them\r\nbelieve they would all be free; that they did pretty much what they\r\nchose; and that Maryland would have to accede to the President's advice\r\nto the Union Border States to emancipate their slaves and receive\r\ncompensation for so doing.\r\n\r\nThe railroad, after leaving the Relay House, runs along the Patapsco\r\nriver, amid most beautiful scenery. We passed numerous trains with\r\nGovernment stores--one of baggage cars fitted up with rough seats and\r\ncrowded inside and on the top with a regiment of Uncle Sam's bluecoats,\r\ncheering and singing as new troops only do. There were no signs of the\r\ndevastations of war until we approached the Monocacy river. During their\r\ncampaign in Maryland, the rebels at one time made this river their line\r\nof defence: it was supposed that they would make here a stand against\r\nMcClellan's advance from Washington. They had burnt the woodwork of the\r\nbridge, twisted the long iron rods of the structure to one side,\r\ndestroyed all the railroad building, engines, and cars they could lay\r\nhands on, and had done everything to retard our force. A new bridge had\r\nnow been recently built, over which we were obliged to pass slowly.\r\nImmediately after leaving the river, the road branched, one track\r\nleading to Frederick, then an immense hospital containing seven thousand\r\nwounded soldiers, the other keeping on and striking the Potomac at the\r\nPoint of Rocks. We saw soldiers and sentries at several places, but were\r\nsurprised that we did not see more. The road keeps close to the river\r\nfor some miles to Harper's Ferry. On the other side the ground was\r\nfrequently occupied by the enemy's pickets; the difficulty of\r\napproaching the river being the only impediment to the shelling of\r\ntrains on our side. The Potomac was unusually low; there had been a long\r\nseason of dry, beautiful weather, rendering it fordable in many places.\r\n\r\nAt the Point of Rocks we enter upon the mountains of the Blue Ridge, and\r\nthe railroad winds in the deep valley worn by the river, amid the most\r\npicturesque and beautiful scenery. The canal is between the railroad and\r\nriver: its locks had been destroyed and the water drained out by the\r\nrebel hordes; for it is a great artery of life to Washington, and\r\ninvaluable to an army encamped along its borders, furnishing\r\neconomically the transportation of the great supplies necessary for the\r\nsoldiers' subsistence. At this time it seemed of no use except as a\r\ndepository for the carcasses of dead horses.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this dismal empty canal, there were very few signs\r\nof the ravages of the armies which had lately swept through these\r\ncharming valleys. A few miles from Harper's Ferry, by the side of the\r\nrailroad, were great hayricks, and the barns were full to overflowing.\r\nAs we approached Sandy Hook, a village of a few houses on the north side\r\nof the Potomac, about a mile from Harper's Ferry, we saw on the road,\r\nwhich ran close to the railroad track, thousands of the blue-bodied,\r\nwhite-topped army wagons. In the most crowded thoroughfare of London one\r\nwould not see so many teams. From this neighborhood the great army of\r\nthe Potomac drew the most of its supplies. The ninth army corps was\r\nmoving this day to its camp, two or three miles northward; and part of\r\nits cannon, their brazen throats still tarnished by sulphurous smoke,\r\nadded to the throng. It is surprising how large a portion of the army is\r\ncomposed of these baggage trains, and of the camp followers, teamsters,\r\nservants, and sutlers. A regiment of infantry, under the little shelter\r\ntents is crowded, into a small space; but the bulky baggage trains cover\r\nmuch ground. We spent the best part of a day, in going to and returning\r\nfrom the army, in the neighborhood of a small wayside tavern in this\r\nlittle village of Sandy Hook, with no other amusement than watching the\r\nmoving of the teamsters, chatting with stray officers and soldiers, and\r\nseeing what may be called the back-stair life of the army. And we wish\r\nhere to protest against the abuse which has been so abundantly heaped\r\nupon the teamsters: we found them, as a class, a respectable body of\r\nmen, quite skilful in the management of their animals, comparing well\r\nwith those in the same occupation in our great cities: there was\r\ncertainly not so much swearing, and not so much abuse of their mules and\r\nhorses, as one sees in New York. I remember their kind attention to me,\r\nsome days afterward, when, in my impatience to get by a long train of\r\nteams filling up a little country road, I had imprudently urged my horse\r\non to a ledge of rocks, where he, not being an old warhorse, hesitated,\r\nslipped, and fell flat on his side, among the mules of one of the\r\nwagons; and, as the horse, with my leg under him, was rolling to recover\r\nhimself, the anxiety of the teamsters as to whether I was hurt, and then\r\nas to my horse, a fine animal, who had cut himself a little on the\r\nrocks. Their proffered assistance was very different from the oaths I\r\nshould have met under similar circumstances in some Northern cities.\r\n\r\nThe army wagons are large, with great white cotton coverings, and\r\ngenerally drawn by six mules: the driver, usually a colored man, rides\r\nthe first nigh mule, and has _one_ rein, called the 'jerky rein,'\r\nrunning over the head of the mule before him, through a ring fastened to\r\nhis headstall, and dividing on the back of the leader, and fastening to\r\nhis bit. The mule is directed to one side or another by the driver\r\ntwitching the rein and shouting. There were some few wagons driven from\r\nthe box, but in all these cases that we noticed, the animals were\r\nhorses, four in number, and their drivers were white. The mules and\r\nhorses were generally in good condition, and quite a contrast to those\r\nin the cavalry service, which, even in a crack regiment, like the sixth\r\nregular, presented a most sorry appearance of overwork and terribly hard\r\nusage. The baggage trains and camp followers are a necessary portion of\r\nevery army, and its efficiency depends in a great measure upon the\r\nperfect organization of this essential part. In the French army this\r\norganization is carried to a high degree of perfection. A small army of\r\nten or twenty thousand men can get along with a fewer proportional\r\nnumber of followers, as it lives more upon the country, than a great\r\narmy of one hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nEvery regiment has its own baggage wagons to carry its tents, cooking\r\napparatus, officers' mess chests, and personal baggage. At the beginning\r\nof the war, each of the Massachusetts regiments was fitted out with from\r\nfifteen to twenty-four wagons. A recent United States regulation has\r\nlimited the number to six for one regiment. The personal baggage of the\r\nregiments, however, forms a small part of the great transportation of an\r\narmy. The spare ammunition is no small matter; every cannon having a\r\nsupply of round shot, shell, canister, and grape: all these may be\r\nneeded by each piece in a battle, as the shot used depends upon the\r\ndistance of the foe. A full regiment of infantry may fire in one battle\r\nsixty thousand rounds of ammunition, weighing nearly three tons. The\r\npontoon trains, the baggage of the staff, the forage for the horses of\r\nthe artillery and of the generals, field officers, and their staffs, the\r\nfood of the army, and the food and forage for this further army of camp\r\nfollowers--all have to be transported. The cavalry are expected to\r\nforage for their horses from off the country; all the rest have to be\r\nprovided for. To carry the subsistence of a regiment of nine hundred men\r\nfor one day, requires one of the six-mule teams: for a march of twenty\r\ndays there must be twenty wagons. One will see from this that, next to\r\nthe general, the quartermaster has the great post of responsibility. He\r\nhas to see that all the supplies are obtained and forwarded to the right\r\nplace. He commands all these countless wagons with their teamsters. It\r\nis also his duty, when on the march, to pick out the camp, unless the\r\ngeneral may take it from out of his hands. The army, as a general thing,\r\nwill not fight well unless it is well fed and well cared for. To assist\r\nhim, the quartermaster has his necessary clerks, for he carries on a\r\nlarge business, with Uncle Sam as his principal, and he must account to\r\nhim for every pound of coffee, bacon, flour, and hay, barrel of vinegar,\r\nkeg of nails, tent or tent pin that he receives, and finally return\r\nthem, or tell him satisfactorily where they have gone, and produce his\r\nvouchers; or he and his bondsmen must pay their value. All this is done\r\nby system and rule: there are mounted wagonmasters to look out for every\r\nsmall string of wagons, and some sort of discipline prevails among these\r\nnon-enlisted men. A great army must be a moving city, capable of\r\nsubsisting itself in the uncultivated and desert regions through which\r\nit often passes. Every cavalry soldier carries his spare horseshoes and\r\nnails; and every cavalry regiment and every battery of artillery has its\r\nown forge, tools, and materials for shoeing its horses and making\r\nrepairs: even the quartermaster's train must have its blacksmiths and\r\ntheir supplies.\r\n\r\nIn travelling down the Rhone during the Crimean war, I was vainly trying\r\nto make out the meaning of the letters on the military button of an\r\nofficer sitting before me; when one of his companions, who happened to\r\nbe at my side, a well-educated, intelligent man, good-naturedly informed\r\nme that they indicated that the wearer belonged to the bureau of the\r\npost. He and several others on the boat had been educated for this\r\nbranch of the service at a military school in Paris, and were en route\r\nfor the sole purpose of taking charge of this department. We have not\r\narrived at this perfection; for ours, after all, in many respects, is an\r\narmy of volunteers; but still a messenger had to go every day to\r\nWashington for the letters of the army corps, and the telegraph and its\r\nwires travel with the camp. The officers' servants alone, in an army of\r\na hundred and fifty thousand men, number more than the thirty-nine\r\nhundred soldiers the city of Boston has to raise for her proportion of\r\nthe levy of nine-months men. The number of servants and horses of an\r\nofficer depends upon his rank; he draws subsistence for the number\r\nallowed to him. A mere cavalry captain can draw for and usually has two\r\nhorses. His horses and trappings, his mess, must be cared for by others;\r\nand hence the thousands of servants that must go with the thousands of\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nBut let us pass from this, which is common to every army, and proceed on\r\nour journey. The easily pulverized, light, clayey soil around Sandy Hook\r\nwas raised in huge clouds by the countless wagons and the hoofs of the\r\nhorses of the squads of cavalry officers, couriers, and wagonmasters.\r\nThe little tavern was once, the old woman who kept it assured us,\r\nsurrounded by a pretty fence, and a garden with grass and flowers: now\r\nthe fence was half gone, and to its pickets were tied the horses of\r\nofficers, quartermasters, baggagemasters, and orderlies, and the flowers\r\nwere trampled into light dust. The provisions in the house had been\r\neaten by hungry travellers, who were supplied with very scanty fare, and\r\nwere thankful to get that. The old woman, having dealt out to us the\r\nlittle she had left, for which she demanded most abundant compensation,\r\namused us with her tales. Her house had been alternately the home of\r\nUnionists and rebels. It was not many days since divisions of rebels had\r\ngone by and encamped there, both before and after the surrender of\r\nHarper's Ferry. The shells fired in that fight had passed over her\r\ntavern. Her description of the hungry, tired troopers, arriving in the\r\nevening, and surrounding the house, the men falling down asleep under\r\ntheir horses' bellies, horses and men packed in together as thick as a\r\nswarm of bees, was quite graphic. Her accounts of her conversations with\r\nthe great rebel leaders were interesting, but I feared were apocryphal,\r\nas she ended by assuring us that General Lee had to sleep supperless on\r\nher woodpile. If it were not for this last tale, kind reader, you would\r\nhave been entertained with the conversations of the great chiefs of\r\nrebeldom, as related by a reliable witness. We did hear from her, and\r\nfrom officers who saw the rebel soldiers at Harper's Ferry, of the\r\npitiable condition of some of the infantry, of their naked, bleeding\r\nfeet, and their gaunt looks. Our landlady affirmed that we could not\r\nfind a dog in the neighborhood; for they had gone before the rebel\r\nhordes in the way that such flesh disappears before the Chinese and\r\nPacific Islanders. It is probably true that at times they were hard\r\npressed for food, and many badly off for shoes; but we were told by\r\nofficers who saw the dead at Antietam that, though not so well shod as\r\nour men, they were shod, and they had provisions in their haversacks.\r\nThe rebels have flour dealt out to them as rations on the march, and\r\nthey have to cook it. Our troops have hard biscuit, called 'tack;' it is\r\nmade in squares, and some which was fresh was very good; but it often\r\ncomes to the regiments with maggots. This is not so much objected to;\r\nbut when, in addition, it is mouldy, the men grumble. By the side of the\r\nfresh tack were some Sandy Hook veteran biscuit, that had been through\r\nthe Peninsular campaign, and had come last from Harrison's Landing; the\r\noutside of the boxes was enough to condemn them, and the commissary was\r\nsaying that he must get Uncle Sam's inspector-general to examine and\r\npass upon them. When we saw this hard, mouldy old tack, we appreciated\r\nthe joke of the Western boys, who declared they found the date of the\r\nbaking on their biscuit in the letters 'B. C.,' 'Before Christ.' The\r\nluxury of soft bread is prized by the troops. Near Baltimore, where the\r\n38th Massachusetts were stationed for some weeks, nice ovens were built,\r\nafter the fashion of the French army, and fresh bread, meats, and the\r\nYankee Sunday beans cooked. With the army in the field this cannot be\r\ndone, but the ovens could have been built during the weeks our soldiers\r\nwere resting on the banks of the Potomac. Our troops at this time were\r\nfed on the hard tack and fresh beef; and some of the men in a camp near\r\nSharpsburg complained of the want of salt provisions. This seemed\r\nunreasonable, until we heard that they had no salt, the long distance it\r\nhad to be teamed being the excuse given for the unpardonable want of it.\r\nThis hard tack is doing one good thing: it is giving the men white\r\nteeth; you can tell an old soldier by his polished ivory; his teeth\r\napproach the appearance of the Italian and Swiss peasantry, who also\r\nchew hard bread. Reader, did you ever try to work your way through the\r\nhard loaf of the peasant's fare? The army regulations require tooth\r\nbrushes for the men; it is supposed that the proper use keeps off ague\r\nand disease; still many regiments were without one to a company.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our old woman at the little tavern of Sandy Hook. She\r\nhad tales, too, of our officers. That morning she had seen our\r\nhandsomest and our most splendid-looking general--in appearance the\r\nideal of the brigand of the romance--Burnside, riding by, with his\r\nblack, tall, army felt hat, without plume or gilt eagle, brim turned\r\ndown, his dark blue blouse covered with dust. 'Why,' said she, 'he\r\nlooked, in his dusty blue shirt, with two old tin dippers strung by the\r\nhandle at his belt, like any farmer; but I suppose he had some better\r\nclothes.' Her lament for the gallant fellows who had fallen by disease,\r\ntorn by the cannon shot, or struck by the deadly rifle ball; for the\r\nsufferings of the poor, sick, lame, and mutilated soldiers; and her\r\nsolemn asseverations that there was something wrong in the hearts of the\r\nleaders on both sides, to permit this suffering and loss of so many good\r\nmen, was truly touching. We could not reason it out with her; logic had\r\nto give place to her pathetic lamentation. I do not, however, intend to\r\nkeep my readers so long a time at this little wayside inn as I was; and\r\nwill pass on to Harper's Ferry, a mile beyond.\r\n\r\nBut before we part, we certainly should not fail to notice a modern\r\naddition to the camp follower that Napoleon did not have in his grand\r\narmies--the newsboy--the omnipresent, the irrepressible gamin of the\r\npress. New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, all had\r\ncontributed their quota, and what a glorious harvest they were reaping!\r\nBaltimore _Americans_, at five cents each; New York _Heralds_,\r\n_Tribunes_, and _Times_, at ten cents; and everything sold early. One\r\nlittle fellow was strutting around with a pair of spurs on, and styled\r\nhimself 'colonel;' the others he introduced as his staff. The day's work\r\nwas over, and larking had begun. I found the spurs were for use. The\r\ncolonel had bought an old condemned brute, which his companions were\r\ntrying to buy at the advanced price of ten dollars. The camps were at a\r\ndistance, from two miles upward, and a mounted boy could bring his wares\r\nto market first. And so the whole afternoon every rider of a\r\nparticularly bad horse was pestered by an offer of five or ten dollars,\r\nfrom a throng of dirty, noisy, scampish ragamuffins. Later in the\r\nevening, the guard went by with some three or four of the boys, for once\r\nwithout a grin on their faces, under arrest. We asked the colonel, who\r\nhad the reputation of being an honest fellow, what was the matter with\r\nhis suite. He only replied that it was hard times for newsboys, if that\r\nwas the way things were going; and walked off, clanking his long spurs\r\nover the stones.\r\n\r\nThe railroad and road from Sandy Hook to Harper's Ferry run under the\r\nMaryland Heights, the rocks having been blasted away for a passage. The\r\nrailroad bridge had been rebuilt, not permanently, but so that trains\r\ncould again cross. Lower down the river were the remains of the pontoon\r\nbridge destroyed by the rebels. Higher up on the other side of the\r\nrailroad was a new pontoon bridge, built on boats, painted with Uncle\r\nSam's light blue color. Farther up, the wagons were fording the stream.\r\nAs you crossed the pontoon bridge, you came directly to the little stone\r\nengine house, with its belfry, where John Brown held the power of the\r\ngreat State of Virginia at bay. All else of the Government buildings are\r\nin ruins. The long lines of brick and stone walls blackened by fire, and\r\nthe picturesque broken arches of the engine-house windows, were a fit\r\ngreeting to one's entrance upon the ruined grandeur of the Old Dominion.\r\nThrough the clouds of dust and the noise and confusion of the village\r\nupon the hill rising immediately above the river, we rode, noting the\r\nsigns of the recent contest, or looking down on the blue Potomac,\r\nflowing peacefully below. One large brick house had a breach in the\r\nbasement story large enough for us to ride in, caused by some bursting\r\nshell. Dead horses still lay in the road; the tailpiece of a broken\r\ncannon was yet there. As we emerged out of the dust at the top of the\r\nhill beyond, toward the afternoon sun, rose Bolivar Heights, and the\r\ninnumerable white tents of General Sumner's large army corps. The\r\nsoldiers were out for drill or dress parade. The distant sounds of the\r\nbands and bugles and drums, sometimes succeeding each other, then\r\nmingling together, fell softened but constantly on the ear, and\r\neverywhere was the gleam of the declining sun on glistening sword or\r\nbright musket barrel. Behind us to the east, and beyond the Shenandoah,\r\nwhich flowed at the foot of the village, arose the high Loudon\r\nMountains; on the north, on the other side of the Potomac, were the\r\nMaryland Heights, with the road to Sharpsburgh and Williamsport winding\r\nalong its wooded base. The tops of these mountains were lighted up and\r\nwreathed with the smoke of the fires kindled to destroy the thick woods\r\nthat might afford shelter to approaching enemies. It was most charming\r\nmountain scenery. We enjoyed the view long, but had to turn our backs at\r\nlast; and as we recrossed the pontoon bridge we wiped off from the soles\r\nof our feet a large portion of the sacred soil of Virginia. Yes, the\r\nsacred soil of Virginia, the mother of presidents, the home of\r\nWashington, Patrick Henry, Jefferson, and Madison, and of how many\r\nothers famous in our history. O Virginia, what a contrast is there now!\r\nthe blood of thy boasted chivalry struggling manfully stains the ground;\r\nthy soil is ground to powder under the heel of the hated mudsils of the\r\nNorth; thy fertile plains and beautiful valleys are trodden down by\r\narmed men; the fierce contest, and desolation and want have come to\r\nevery household; and the cry arises for thy sons that are not!\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of Gen. McClellan were two or three miles north of\r\nKnoxville, a little village on the Potomac, about three miles below\r\nHarper's Ferry. The day that we were there, the General was absent on\r\nhis way to meet Mrs. McClellan, and though the telegraph wires ran to\r\nheadquarters, nothing was there known of the foray Stuart had begun\r\nearly that morning from Hancock, in the rear of our forces; not till\r\nevening, and until his arrival at Chambersburg did the news arrive. If\r\nthe telegraph wires had been laid, or the signal corps so stationed as\r\nto have given warning of the inception of this movement, these bold\r\nrebels could not have advanced so far, but would have been compelled to\r\nretreat as they came. Between the General's headquarters and the river\r\nwere the famous sixth cavalry of regulars and some batteries of\r\nartillery. He had no guard in the direction of Pennsylvania toward the\r\nnortheast, where Stuart's cavalry passed on their way to the Potomac.\r\nThe camp itself was not well placed, and was soon changed. In going from\r\nit we rode through a most beautiful country by the side of an officer of\r\nthe sixth cavalry, and listened to his enthusiastic account of scouting\r\nin front of our lines, in the footsteps of the retreating enemy, over\r\nthe very roads we were travelling safely and without concern; and yet we\r\nwere not many miles from the foe, and within reach of the marvellous\r\nflight of the minie ball, which some lurking rifleman might aim from the\r\nother side of the Potomac. These cavalry soldiers and horses have had a\r\nterribly hard time of it. The horses of the sixth were more broken down\r\nand thinner than in the artillery or baggage trains. Two squadrons had\r\nlately been part of the force sent on a reconnoisance to Leesburg; and\r\nupon the return of our troops it had been the duty of our companion,\r\nthen in command, to bring up the rear and drive in the infantry\r\nstragglers. Some two hundred had fallen out of the ranks from mere\r\nexhaustion. To leave any of these soldiers behind would be giving them\r\nup as prisoners, and affording the enemy the opportunity of obtaining\r\ninformation which it was of the utmost importance for the safety of the\r\nexpedition to keep back. The troopers had therefore to drive them on\r\nwith their swords--not a pleasant duty, when the poor fellows were faint\r\nand used up by fatigue--still it must be done. This service creates\r\nquite a dislike between the two arms. The infantry man hates the\r\nhorseman, and the cavalry man despises the foot soldier. At this time\r\nstraggling was quite prevalent: we saw on byroads many who had left the\r\nranks, almost invariably having thrown away their arms, and subsisting\r\non plunder. The cavalry were scouring the roads for them, and were\r\nbringing them in as prisoners for punishment. This sixth cavalry, like\r\nall the old regiments which had been through the Peninsular campaign and\r\nthe disastrous retreat under Pope, was frightfully reduced in numbers:\r\nonly three hundred and seventy were around the standards out of the\r\neleven hundred who first took the field. Many had fallen on picket or\r\nbeen cut off singly, more by disease, but alike doing their duty,\r\nunmentioned and unnoticed. A larger number were yet suffering from\r\noverwork and sickness; and the regiment would in time recruit to seven\r\nhundred, from men now disabled, if there should be no more casualties.\r\n\r\nA few days in camp, in a good-sized tent--none of the two-feet-high\r\nshelter affairs--in pleasant summer weather, is, on the whole, something\r\nnew and exhilarating. The ground, to be sure, is rather hard,\r\nparticularly when you have no straw; and a soldier's table is not always\r\nthe most luxurious in the world. Now that we are safe, dry, and warm, at\r\nhome, we can venture to declare that we were very unfortunate in losing\r\nthe sensation of going without food, of sleeping in the mud and in the\r\nrain--our arms girded on--any moment to be aroused by the whistle of\r\nthe bullet or the roll of the drum calling us to the deadly strife.\r\n\r\nTo us, however, it was all _couleur de rose_. In the early morn, at\r\nbreak of day, it was not the crow of the cock, or the jarring rattle of\r\nthe wheels of the city baker or milkman, but the reveille that waked us\r\nfrom our martial dreams. The drum of the infantry, the bugles of the\r\ncavalry and artillery would begin; some early riser would rouse up his\r\nregiment; then another would take it up; until the call had gone through\r\nevery corps. The old staid rub-a-dub of the English drummer is giving\r\nplace to the stirring French rat-a-plan. And there was one band that\r\ngenerally led off in a splendid style. They did beat their drums lively\r\nand sharply. Not being obliged to be up with the sun and cook our own\r\nbreakfast, we generally contrived to get a little more sleep. After\r\nbreakfast, the bands were playing for guard-mounting; and we sat gazing\r\ndown into the valley from our tent upon the large army corps encamped\r\nbelow. We were on the western slope of the Blue Ridge, through whose\r\ngaps not many days before, a few miles farther north, Franklin had\r\nsuccessfully fought his way. Still farther up, Burnside, with Reno and\r\nHooker under him, had at South Mountain driven the enemy in--that battle\r\nwhich came to us so welcome, the first victory after Pope's disasters,\r\nand the retreat from the Peninsula. The valley below us was Pleasant\r\nValley. The opposite side to our tent was a short spur of the Blue\r\nRidge; the southern extremity of which is the Maryland Heights, so well\r\nknown in the history of the surrender of Harper's Ferry. The valley\r\nbetween is fertile and highly cultivated, full of mountain springs and\r\nbrooks, emptying into one stream of sufficient size to turn the wheels\r\nof a large mill; the water is delicious; the prevailing limestone does\r\nnot reach this valley. In the morning before the army moved there, the\r\nlittle river was clear as crystal; at night it was changed into an\r\nopaque white color, a stream of soapy water; a pleasing witness to the\r\ncleanliness of our men. There were no clothes lines, however, but many\r\nof the washers were so scantily off for clothing that they put their\r\ngarments on to dry. The farmhouses in the valley are mostly of stone. It\r\nis a most charming and beautiful place, and appropriately called\r\n'Pleasant Valley.' The farmers are prosperous; and the land so rich that\r\nit sells for the high price of seventy and eighty dollars an acre. The\r\nmountains rising on the sides of the valley are thickly wooded; and in\r\nthe cultivated fields between were crowded the tents of the ninth army\r\ncorps. With the exception of one or two new regiments who had wall\r\ntents, the soldiers were under little shelter tents, of which each man\r\ncarries a piece. The infantry were encamped in divisions and brigades;\r\nthe cavalry generally picketed along a fence; the horses and men, except\r\nthe officers, without shelter. The encampments of the artillery and\r\ncavalry with their horses, forges, and wagons, covered much ground; but\r\nthe infantry were thickly crowded together; and it was surprising to see\r\nhow many men a small encampment would turn out.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon came drills, sometimes of regiments, sometimes of\r\nbrigades, and the unfailing dress parade. There were a few regiments of\r\nnew levies just arrived, a thousand strong; all provided with overcoats,\r\nand looking finely in their new, clean clothes--quite a contrast to the\r\nold soldiers. In one of the old regiments on brigade drill we saw an\r\nofficer, probably a sergeant, in a checked knit undervest, his neck and\r\npart of his arms bare--commanding a company. A sentry on guard before\r\nthe quarters of the general in command, had great holes in both elbows\r\nof his dirty jacket, and his shoes were untied. The brigades were\r\ngenerally of five regiments, a new regiment being one, and composing\r\nfully two fifths of the line. It is not wholly, however, by the\r\ncasualties of the battle or the greater losses from exposure, overwork,\r\nand disease, that the regiments are diminished. If a good blacksmith is\r\nfound, he is detailed to the forge; others are detached as ambulance\r\ndrivers, or as hospital attendants or clerks. This thins the ranks of\r\nthe old regiments. It is surprising, however, to see how much better the\r\nveterans will bear exposure than men coming fresh from home. The old\r\nregiments were frightfully diminished by disease on the Peninsula; but I\r\nsaw very few that could not rally more men than the 35th Massachusetts,\r\nthat had been out of the State only a little over a month. They had but\r\nthree hundred men of the original thousand. They left Washington without\r\ntheir knapsacks; and had marched without even the shelter tents,\r\nofficers and men alike bivouacking on the ground, wearing the same\r\nclothes without a change. The long marches, the exposures, the\r\nexcitement of battle, and the unaccustomed food had disabled four\r\nhundred men; some of them undoubtedly never strong enough to have\r\nenlisted, and who should have been rejected by the examining surgeons.\r\nThe old regiments, who had gradually been hardened to this life, and who\r\nhad learned to thrive on the soldier's fare, lost comparatively few in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nThe brigade drills and the manoeuvres in line were not so well\r\nexecuted as we expected. There was no practice in firing at a mark;\r\nprobably from a want of ammunition. From accounts of officers on the\r\nfield of battle, it certainly is the case in our army that some of the\r\nfresh soldiers will fire in the air, and even close their eyes. The\r\nHythe system, as now taught in the English army, and among the rifle\r\nclubs, makes excellent marksmen; and the greater part of the instruction\r\nis without the use of powder. It is a pity it cannot be more extensively\r\nintroduced in our army.\r\n\r\nOne does not expect to find the same training before the enemy as in the\r\ngreat French camps of instruction. It was my good fortune to visit the\r\ncamp of a portion of the great Crimean army. The privates, besides their\r\nmilitary drill, were exercised in running, leaping, fencing, and boxing;\r\nand some sergeants were teaching dancing. I followed a regiment of the\r\nchasseurs of Vincennes to their field of drill. For an hour or two they\r\nwent through different manoeuvres by the bugle, performing many of the\r\nmovements at the double quick. Then came a rest; as soon as that was\r\nordered, the fine band of the regiment came forward and struck up a\r\nlively dance, to the tune of which several of the privates amused and\r\nrefreshed themselves by waltzing round the field.\r\n\r\nReturning, however, to our picturesque camp in this charming valley.\r\nThere was no more striking scene than when darkness came on and the\r\nthousand camp fires and lights in the tents were all in sight. The rail\r\nfences, bought by the thoughtful quartermaster, and paid for as an army\r\nsupply, were used as fuel; a truly considerate act, for a quartermaster\r\ncan buy fuel for the army, but he cannot pay damages done to property.\r\nThis same ground, now covered by our troops, had been camped over by\r\nLee's army; who had also used the fences, not even paying for them in\r\nthe worthless Confederate scrip. Soon after dark, the bright lights of\r\nthe signal corps appeared on the mountain north of the Maryland Heights,\r\nand messages were sent to McClellan's headquarters. Flags are used in\r\nthe day, and at night lanterns. The signal officer has two lights; they\r\nare held one above the other, the lower one being stationary; moving the\r\nupper light to the right means number one; moving the light to the left,\r\nnumber two; moving first to the right and then to the left, number\r\nthree; by lowering the upper light in front of the under one, a fourth\r\nsignal is given; and so on. There are about five numbers; and by the\r\ndifferent combinations of these five numbers, there is made a great\r\nnumber of signals, which can be read by the officers who have the key.\r\nThe mode is much the same as that used by our mercantile marine with\r\ntheir signal flags. The signals are given very rapidly, and a few\r\nminutes suffice for the sending of the messages.\r\n\r\nEvening is the time for talk around the camp fires; and the conversation\r\noften turns upon our rebellious brethren. Among our regular officers you\r\nmeet the classmates and old companions in arms of the rebels, and hear\r\nof little traits and peculiarities that only intimate acquaintances can\r\nrelate. Civilians who had known General Lee at Washington, have spoken\r\nof him as very formal, and rather pompous in his manner, giving the\r\nimpression that he was a man of more show and pretence than abilities.\r\nWe learned here, however, that, in Texas, or California, where he was\r\nfor a long time before he took his high position on Scott's staff, he\r\nwas famous for marching his men without the usual encumbrances of\r\nbaggage, on the most severe expeditions against the Indians, in the snow\r\nand cold of the winter. Stonewall Jackson has always been famed for his\r\npeculiarities. When a young man, he was possessed with the idea that he\r\nwas in danger of having his limbs paralyzed, and he would pump on his\r\narm for many minutes, counting the strokes, and annoyed beyond measure\r\nby the interruptions of his companions breaking up his count. Our\r\nofficers, both regular and volunteer, who have been in actual battle,\r\nhave a great respect for the rebel leaders and soldiers; they speak very\r\nhighly of their drill, and believe that straggling exists to a less\r\nextent among them, in battle, than with us. From the rebel newspapers I\r\nshould doubt whether this is the case. One thing we have not considered,\r\nwhich has given the rebels a great advantage in this contest. It is the\r\nlarge number of military colleges in the South; not like our few private\r\nschools at the North, but well-endowed academies. In the summer of 1860,\r\nimmediately before the election of Lincoln, I visited the military\r\nacademy at Lexington, Virginia. It was supported at the expense of the\r\nState, with two hundred and more pupils, coming from the different\r\ncounties in proportion to their population. They were practised in the\r\nactual firing of cannon and mortars; and every afternoon were drilled as\r\ninfantry for about two hours, much of the time at the double quick. The\r\nprincipal was a graduate of West Point; and he was assisted by a\r\nrespectable board of instructors. A good civil and military education,\r\nafter the mode of instruction at West Point, was afforded to the\r\nstudents. This institution had been in existence for years; and one can\r\nreadily appreciate the advantage that Virginia has in this war from the\r\ngraduates of this school. Alabama and several other of the Southern\r\nStates have similar colleges; while we at the North have been obliged to\r\neducate all our volunteer officers by actual service.\r\n\r\nThe morning Stuart with his cavalry left Chambersburg, we rode forth for\r\nthe battle field of the Antietam. We noticed the disappearance of some\r\nof the camps of the infantry brigades. We knew of the patrolling of the\r\ncavalry along the road we were pursuing, and found the picket guards\r\nfarther out, and passes and countersigns necessary where before we went\r\nunchallenged. We were several hours in getting to the battle field, and\r\nstopped to get some refreshments at a large brick farmhouse, where the\r\nbattle on the left began. The hospital flag was still flying over the\r\nbuilding, though no patients had been there for a day or two.\r\nTwenty-seven died in that one farmhouse from wounds received in that\r\nbloody fight. On the night of the battle, cows, sheep, poultry, and\r\nfences disappeared before our cold and hungry troops. But since then,\r\nthough the house was in the neighborhood of several camps, the old lady\r\nand her daughters, who alone were at home, had been undisturbed, except\r\nby the small pilferings of stragglers.\r\n\r\nThe great battle has been so well described by the correspondents of the\r\nnewspaper press, and by those who were over the field before we were,\r\nthat I shall only mention a few incidents to which our attention was\r\ncalled. The principal contest was on the right, west of the Antietam\r\nriver. Here Hooker with his army corps began the battle, and fought so\r\nlong and splendidly. Both armies crowded their forces to this part of\r\nthe field. Sumner, whose troops had been with their belts on since three\r\nin the morning, brought up his large corps, drawn up in three columns,\r\nforty paces apart, to reenforce Hooker's hard-pressed soldiers, who were\r\nretreating before the fresh and overwhelming reenforcements of the\r\nenemy. In less than an hour, the whole of Sumner's corps was swept back,\r\nbroken and entirely routed, and never appeared in the field again; the\r\ncolumn in the rear not being in position to fire a gun, but losing as\r\nmany men as those in front.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which General Sumner brought his troops into action has\r\nbeen severely criticized, even by officers of his own corps; whether\r\njustly or not, it is difficult to decide. No commander was more confided\r\nin by his soldiers than Sumner. 'He has risen from the ranks, and been\r\nthrough all the grades of the service,' 'He knows how to treat his men,'\r\nwere expressions constantly heard. General Hooker's reputation as a\r\nfighting general was admitted everywhere; his _coup d'oeil_ of the\r\nbattle field was represented as most excellent.\r\n\r\nIt was also on the right that the desperate fighting in the woods and\r\nthe deadly struggle at close quarters in the cornfield with such fearful\r\nloss of life took place. An officer who was on the battle fields of\r\nMagenta and Solferino, says that the scene here was much more horrible.\r\nMany spoke of the scenes they saw with a shudder. They could not throw\r\noff the impression made by the masses of wounded and dead; the wounded\r\noften lying neglected and helpless under the dead, sometimes crushed to\r\ndeath by the wheels of our own artillery.\r\n\r\nOur left at Antietam was far off from the right: in these days of guns\r\nof long range the line of battle is longer than it was formerly. At\r\nWaterloo the English occupied a front of less than two miles. In this\r\nbattle ours was about four miles. In the battle of Solferino the\r\nengagement extended for eighteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe contest on the left was fought by General Burnside with only one\r\narmy corps, the ninth. The battle at this place was a most gallant\r\naffair, but has excited less attention than the bloody fight on the\r\nright. In the dusty, tiresome march through Maryland, in the skirmishes\r\nin and around Frederick, during the glorious hearty welcome our troops\r\nreceived in that old town, the advance, consisting of both Hooker's and\r\nReno's army corps, had been commanded by Burnside. With them he had\r\nfought the successful and brilliant battle of South Mountain, coming to\r\nus so gratefully after the disastrous repulse and retreat of Pope. Reno\r\nhad unfortunately fallen, and General Burnside took command of his\r\ncorps: it was his old force from North Carolina, increased by General\r\nCox's Kanawha troops, and some new regiments, in all a little short of\r\ntwenty thousand men. On the morning of the battle, Burnside took his\r\nstation on the east side of the Antietam, in a field overlooking the\r\ncountry on the other side of the river. The gathering of his staff to\r\ntheir breakfast brought the shells of the enemy in their midst, and\r\ncompelled a change of position to the rear of some haystacks. On the\r\nsame hill was placed a formidable battery of rifled cannon, throwing\r\ntwenty-pound shot, commanded by Lieutenant Benjamin, of the regular\r\nartillery. The guns are so heavy that they each have eight horses to\r\ndrag them, and the caissons have six. There was unfortunately a short\r\nsupply of ammunition, and the battery was fired slowly during the day.\r\nThe guns were well placed and served, and aimed with wonderful accuracy.\r\nShells were planted in two of the enemy's ammunition carts, blowing them\r\nto pieces; and the fire of cannon was so hot that it compelled a rebel\r\nbattery two miles off, coming down a road to get into position, to wheel\r\nround and gallop over the hill. Proud, indeed, were the Lieutenant's men\r\nof their exploits on that day, and wonderful stories they told of their\r\nfamous battery.\r\n\r\nThe Antietam in front of Burnside was deep, not fordable, flowing in the\r\nbottom of a charming valley, and overshadowed by trees. There was a\r\nsolid stone bridge over it, with three arches, rising picturesquely in\r\nthe centre, with stone parapets on the sides, the parapets spreading at\r\nboth ends of the structure. One would almost imagine that it was an old\r\nItalian bridge transported to our wooden-building land. The side of the\r\nvalley held by the rebel troops rises sharply, not densely wooded, but\r\ncovered by large trees thickly placed, as in an old English park. Along\r\nthe top of this ridge ran a solid stone wall, thicker and of heavier\r\nstones than any we saw in the neighborhood. Where the wall ended rifle\r\npits had been dug. Behind the massive trunks, and in the branches of the\r\nold trees, behind this wall and in the pits, were crowded the\r\nsharpshooters of the rebels. The ascent from the bridge out of the\r\nvalley on the enemy's side, was too steep for a straight road up the\r\nridge. If ever a bridge could be defended, that should have been; the\r\nonly disadvantage the rebels were under was that they could not sweep it\r\nwith artillery.\r\n\r\nOur left had vainly attempted to cross the bridge; twice had they been\r\nrepulsed. On the right our troops were hard pressed; much of the ground\r\ngained in the morning had been lost; Hooker was wounded, Sumner's corps\r\nrouted, Mansfield killed, and his corps beaten back. Then McClellan\r\nordered Burnside to take the bridge, and hold it at any cost. Burnside\r\nsent some troops farther down the river, where it was fordable. He\r\ncalled up one of his old brigades that had been with him in North\r\nCarolina, saying, if any brigade could take the bridge, that one would.\r\nIt was composed of the 51st New York, 51st Pennsylvania, 21st\r\nMassachusetts, and a Rhode Island regiment; on their colors were\r\ninscribed, 'Roanoke,' 'Newbern,' two of our most glorious victories.\r\nWith these veteran troops was the 35th Massachusetts, a new regiment\r\nthat had left home only a month before, but who nobly did their part.\r\nDown went the 51st Pennsylvania in column in the advance, at the run,\r\nshouting and crowding and firing as they hurried across the bridge,\r\nbringing down the rebels from the trees, suffering themselves, but never\r\nhalting. They crossed and deployed on the other side. Next came the 35th\r\nMassachusetts, over the bridge, up the valley, then forming in line of\r\nbattle on the top of the small hill commanding the stream. The enemy\r\nwere drawn up before them, quite a distance off, on the top of the next\r\nhill. Every inch of ground between was commanded by the rebel fire; but\r\nour brave fellows charged on up this hill, driving the foe before them:\r\nthey did not halt there, for another still higher hill, which could now\r\nfor the first time be seen farther on, rose up before them. Nothing\r\ndaunted, they followed up their charge, and drove the enemy from this\r\nhill, and took this most commanding position. There they halted, close\r\nto Sharpsburg, almost in the rear of the rebels. Some of our troops even\r\npenetrated to Sharpsburg itself, and were taken prisoners. A short\r\ndistance farther would have cut off the enemy's direct retreat to the\r\nPotomac. Rebel troops were seen hurrying on the road to the river. Our\r\nmen were now fired upon by artillery, and attacked by fresh bodies of\r\ninfantry coming up, as the enemy say in their account, from Harper's\r\nFerry. Our brave fellows, however, stood their ground, waiting for\r\nreenforcements, which Burnside called for. But McClellan, unfortunately,\r\ndared not throw in his reserves; his object had probably been gained in\r\nmaking a diversion from the hard contested field on our right. Our\r\ngallant fellows had to stand there unsupported until their ammunition\r\ngave out; they fired their sixty rounds of ammunition, collecting all\r\nthey could from their dead and wounded comrades, and then began to\r\nretreat. Benjamin's battery of artillery was also short of ammunition,\r\nand could not support them. Our brave boys only retreated to the next\r\nhill, not to the hill above the Antietam, and then lay on their arms\r\nduring the night, and there they stayed during the next day, expecting\r\nthe order to advance.\r\n\r\nLittle mounds of earth, covering fallen heroes, point out the course of\r\nour soldiers all the way from this side of the Antietam to the top of\r\nthe farthest hill. Here our men were so much more exposed than the\r\nrebels that our loss was greater than theirs. On the right the rebel\r\nloss was much the larger.\r\n\r\nIn the battle beyond the river, the Hawkins Zouaves, another of the\r\nregiments distinguished in North Carolina, captured a rebel battery at\r\nthe point of the bayonet. In the rebel account we are told how the brave\r\nGeneral Toombs, with a whole brigade, retook the battery and defeated\r\nthis single regiment, which they magnify into an immense force.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, with all his knowledge and great skill and success in\r\ndefensive warfare, as shown in his Peninsular campaign, after our defeat\r\nat Gaines's Mill, is wanting in the rapidity of comprehension and\r\naudacity which are necessary components of the highest military talent.\r\nHe waits for too many chances, and fears any risk.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Antietam, he had fifteen thousand fresh men under Fitz\r\nJohn Porter in the centre. The enemy had probably used their last\r\nsoldier, for the correspondent of the Charleston _Courier_, who has\r\ngiven the best rebel account of the battle, impliedly states that they\r\nhad no reserves left. Ignorant of our unused troops, he laments the want\r\nof a few more rebel men, and says, that if only five thousand of their\r\nstragglers, who were on the way to Winchester, had been present, a most\r\ndecisive rebel victory would have been obtained. If McClellan had added\r\nFitz John Porter's reserve to Burnside's soldiers, he would have had\r\nnearly thirty-five thousand men flanking the enemy, already beaten, and\r\nthreatening their retreat across the Potomac. Who knows what those fresh\r\nmen might not have done? Many think that the doubtful victory would have\r\nended in the most brilliant decided success, and the stone bridge of\r\nAntietam would have stood in history by the side of Arcola and Lodi. But\r\nlet us be thankful for what we did achieve: never should the nation\r\nforget how a retreating, discouraged, defeated, demoralized, and even\r\nmutinous army, that had suffered terribly in killed and wounded, and\r\nlost prisoners and large numbers of cannon and material, was again\r\nreformed, and marched triumphantly against a victorious foe; achieved on\r\nSunday the brilliant victory of South Mountain, and on Wednesday fought\r\nthe bloody fight of Antietam. There we captured cannon, small arms, and\r\nstandards, and lost none. Many have forgotten that ever since spring the\r\nrebels have boasted that the war was to be carried within our territory;\r\nthat they had begun this programme; and that General Lee in entering\r\nMaryland had issued a boasting proclamation, promising to redeem it from\r\na hated tyranny. If he had succeeded, and defeated McClellan, as he had\r\nbeaten Pope between Manassas and Washington, we had no reinforcements or\r\nforts to prevent his march to Philadelphia. McClellan's presence stirred\r\nthe common soldier as Napoleon's did, and it was this unbounded\r\nenthusiasm which he excited, that saved the nation when he took command\r\nat Washington. I know of nothing that made me more indignant than the\r\nfolly of some ladies who, among his soldiers on the Potomac, decried and\r\ndenounced him as an imbecile. What treachery can be worse than the\r\nattempt to destroy the confidence of the soldiers in their leader, when\r\ntheir lives depend upon his judgment and skill, and there can be only\r\ndejection and despair when that judgment and skill are doubted.\r\n\r\nUpon our return from the battle field to Pleasant Valley, we heard that\r\norders to McClellan to advance had come from Washington. The only\r\nanswers to inquiries when the advance would take place, were ominous\r\nshakings of the head or shrugs of the shoulders, which were indicative\r\nof anything but belief in a speedy movement. We also heard of the\r\nappointment of General Burnside to the command of three army corps, the\r\nprecursor of a greater command yet to come. We have in our new\r\ncommander-in-chief a general who has an implicit belief that our cause\r\nis just, and a trust in Providence that he will make the just cause\r\nvictorious. In General McClellan we had also a general who believed in\r\nProvidence, and who has always shown great reverence in his writings.\r\nGeneral McClellan is reticent. You can, however, tell somewhat of the\r\nopinion of the head of the house from his children; and judging from the\r\ntone of belief among the General's military family, from that long delay\r\nafter Antietam, it was pretty evident that in his opinion the South\r\ncannot be subdued, and that the question between us was a matter of\r\nboundary. With General Burnside we have no such belief. His faults, if\r\nthey are faults, are those of the bold general, not of the Fabian order.\r\nAt Newbern he brought at once into the fight every soldier he had, not\r\nkeeping one in reserve; and he gained the battle by his audacious\r\npolicy. And it is the wonder to this day of every one who has been over\r\nthe battle field, that the enemy should have been beaten. With all this\r\nboldness, he is a modest man; twice before having refused the chief\r\ncommand: once when it was offered to him at the time Pope was appointed;\r\nagain when McClellan took it before Washington. Of a commanding figure,\r\nevery inch a soldier, one cannot look upon him and his kindly eye\r\nwithout instant admiration. His modest way of riding among the men,\r\nalone or attended by a single orderly, will make him beloved by our\r\nrepublican soldiers. He was so then, and 'Old Burn,' as they familiarly\r\ncalled him, was everywhere heartily received. By the way, McClellan's\r\nnickname on the Peninsula was 'George,' and not 'Little Mac,' as is\r\ngenerally supposed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside, we believe, is a good judge of men. The generals he\r\nselected for his North Carolina expedition, though previously unknown,\r\nand but captains in the service, have already distinguished themselves\r\nand justified his choice. General Foster, now commanding the department\r\nof North Carolina, has shown himself an able, active general. All who\r\nhave been connected with him, speak highly of him. Though not a\r\nMassachusetts man, he has a peculiar penchant for Massachusetts troops:\r\nhe was first at Annapolis, and picked out for the first brigade the\r\nMassachusetts soldiers. Recently, through the Governor, he has obtained\r\nsome eight or ten more regiments, and in some way or other he has the\r\ncrack ones.\r\n\r\nGeneral Reno, who was Burnside's second brigadier, has made a reputation\r\nthat will live forever in his country's history. At the battle of\r\nRoanoke the little general, but a month before a captain of ordnance,\r\nstood up fearlessly in the swamp amid his men, when they were lying down\r\nby his direction, and coolly gave his orders and encouraged them,\r\nentirely regardless of the balls flying round him on every side. In\r\nPope's retreat, and amid disaster and defeat, he acquired new reputation\r\nby his skill, energy, and daring. A Virginian by birth, he was truly a\r\nloyal man; and, unlike some generals of our army corps, obeyed orders,\r\nand did all that could be done for the country and the general in\r\ncommand. His testimony that Pope's dispositions were good, if he had\r\nonly been obeyed, should weigh much in that general's favor. After the\r\nvictory of South Mountain, he was reconnoitring the enemy, when he fell\r\nby a random shot, which came, so those who were in the action say, from\r\nsome soldier of our force. Lyon, Kearny, Reno, gone! Have we three such\r\nmen left?\r\n\r\nGeneral Park, an accomplished soldier, who particularly distinguished\r\nhimself at the battle of Newbern, was General Burnside's third\r\nbrigadier. The country will feel renewed confidence from his remaining\r\nwith our new commander as chief of staff.\r\n\r\nOn the morning we left the camp, a squad from a new regiment just\r\narrived had been detailed for the guard at headquarters; one of the\r\nsentries was smoking his pipe as he marched up and down; another, who\r\nshould have been patrolling his beat, was seated on the ground, cleaning\r\nhis musket with a piece of wash leather he pulled from his pocket. The\r\nGeneral was not near to stop these unsoldierly occupations. We came to\r\nthe opinion that the boys in that regiment had never been to a country\r\nmuster; but they were stout fellows and looked like fight.\r\n\r\nAt Sandy Hook, on the day of our return, we had to wait until nine in\r\nthe evening for the train to Baltimore. Stuart's cavalry had been over\r\nthe road in the morning, making their escape into Virginia. They dared\r\nnot stay to do mischief; our forces were at all the important points.\r\nConsidering the immense supplies in the rear of the army, Stuart did\r\nvery little harm; his eight hundred fresh horses were not worth the risk\r\nhe ran. If he could have seized our supplies at Monocacy Station, and\r\nburnt the bridge there, he would have inflicted a serious loss upon the\r\narmy. The nature of his raid seemed well understood, and there was no\r\napprehension then of the enemy's holding the railroad; for the train\r\nfrom Baltimore had passed over the restored rails a few hours after the\r\nretreating troopers. At every important point we found soldiers, and\r\nnear Frederick we were glad to hear that seven of the sick troopers,\r\nused up by their hard service, had fallen behind and been taken. We\r\nlearned that General Pleasanton with some of our cavalry was in pursuit,\r\nand there were several stories about an engagement: the firing of cannon\r\nhad been heard. General Pleasanton at that time was held in very little\r\nesteem, and seemed to have particularly disgusted those who had served\r\nunder him, and was often cited as an example of McClellan's lack of\r\njudgment in men. He appears since to have acquired a newspaper\r\nreputation for ability and energy. I only hope that it is deserved, and\r\nthat the opinions we heard so often were not well founded.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the Baltimore depot at four in the morning amid a rain,\r\nand found it occupied by some one or two thousand soldiers, standing and\r\nsitting about in their blue overcoats with their arms stacked. Not a\r\ncarriage could be obtained, and so, shouldering our bag in military\r\nfashion, we marched for the Eutaw House. At the door was stationed a\r\nguard, marking it as the headquarters of Major-General Wool. We passed\r\nby unchallenged; in our bag, however, we had rebel ammunition: a loaded\r\nshell fired at our men as they were crossing the stone bridge at\r\nAntietam. Fortunately the fuse had gone out, and it remained a trophy\r\nfor one of the despicable Down-East Yankees. We heard the old General\r\nwas still the centre of attraction to the pretty secesh ladies who had\r\nfriends or relatives in durance vile in Fort McHenry. The veteran hero,\r\nthough rich, wears a uniform that shows the marks of service. That,\r\nhowever, does not prevent the constant presents of delicious fruit and\r\nbeautiful flowers, and invitations to drive to the fort, from those\r\nbewitching belles of Baltimore: whereat some strong Union people grumble\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DESTINY.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law under consideration is exemplified in the social, industrial,\r\nand political development of the United States. There is a manifest\r\ndifference, however, between the history of our civilization and that of\r\nEurope, though not in the least affecting the integrity of the law. The\r\npeople of our nation were not derived directly from a rude and primitive\r\ncondition, as were those of the Old World. The history of our\r\ncivilization is, in its origin, coordinate with European civilization in\r\nthe seventeenth century, after modern intellect had been fairly aroused,\r\nand the national organizations had been quite fully developed. The chaos\r\nand barbarism which the history of European civilization presents, and\r\nthe play of antagonizing forces through the long period of centuries,\r\nresulting in some degree of political order and unity, does not belong,\r\nexcept as an introduction, to the history of American civilization. Ours\r\nis a branch from the European, after it had been growing for several\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nDuring the period which intervened between the Declaration of American\r\nIndependence and the adoption of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthere was no formal and permanent bond of union between the several\r\nStates; it was provisional,--they were held together by outside pressure\r\nand a common interest in the cause of independence. The settlement of a\r\ngeneral government for all the States was a crisis, not only in the\r\naffairs of this country, but of the whole civilized world, as we believe\r\nthe future will most fully reveal. To the responsible statesmen of that\r\nday, this was a period of intense solicitude, such as we can realize\r\nonly by an effort of mind to place ourselves in their situation, and\r\nbring before us the magnitude of the objects to be attained, and the\r\ndifficulties to be overcome. There was then, as now, a diversity of\r\ninterests to be harmonized; but there was one interest, which, in its\r\npolitical relations, requires to be characterized by a stronger term\r\nthan that of 'diversity.' Between chattel slavery and free labor there\r\nis 'irrepressible' antagonism, and there could be no real union--no\r\nblending of the twain; but the gulf was bridged, under the pressure of\r\nnecessity, as the wisdom of the times could best devise. It was, indeed,\r\nwell done. Union was the great object to be accomplished--it was the\r\nhighest, the most comprehensive principle that could enter into the\r\nmotives of political action--it was even a necessity of the current\r\ncivilization, and must needs subordinate all minor principles and\r\ninterests; and we owe a debt of gratitude to those who so nobly wrought\r\nthis glorious Union out of colonial chaos and isolation.\r\n\r\nThe instrument of this Union has been characterized by well-meaning,\r\nbut one-idea minds, as a 'covenant with death, and an agreement with\r\nhell,' simply because it effected the union of free with slave States.\r\nThis method of characterizing the Constitution of our country--as noble\r\na document for its time and place as the world has ever seen--can well\r\nbe excused, since it has no doubt been done in utter obliviousness of\r\nthe importance of the principle of political unitization. The original\r\nconsummation of this Union was a great step in political progress; it\r\nwas an achievement of the master principle of political movement; and\r\nGod wills that no part of the advantage then gained in the struggle of\r\nDestiny shall ever be given up!\r\n\r\nBut while unity is thus exemplified in the history of our Government,\r\nthe phenomenon of differentiation is also manifest. The functions of\r\ngovernment have greatly multiplied since its first organization; the\r\n'division of labor' process has been going on, and new departments and\r\nbureaus have been established. While I write, the expediency of another\r\ndepartment, that of agriculture, is being agitated in Congress. The\r\nDepartment of the Interior has been quite recently created, and new\r\nbureaus in this department, and in others, are being created from time\r\nto time, by act of Congress, to meet new wants in the administration of\r\nour Government. And what is true in this respect of the General\r\nGovernment is, also, true of the State Governments; for there, too, do\r\nwe find the development of new functions, and the creation of new\r\nofficial organs to execute the same.\r\n\r\nThis growth of the country at large, from which these new demands on the\r\nGovernment arise, is to be seen very distinctly in the industrial and\r\neducational elements of society. While these interests increase in\r\nmagnitude and variety, and the people are becoming more concerned\r\ntherein, the Government assumes a responsibility in regard thereto,\r\nwhich can only be discharged by the multiplication of the administrative\r\nappliances. These new governmental activities arise from the popular\r\nwill, as moulded and expressed through the more intelligent and\r\nenterprising of its actors. They choose to have it so. It is found\r\nconvenient, in the promotion of certain general interests, to appeal to\r\na power which is presumed to embody the elements of order and authority\r\nin the execution of its will. In the construction of railroads and\r\ntelegraphs, capitalists must cooperate with the Government in relation\r\nto questions of right, which, in many cases, can only be settled by a\r\nregularly constituted tribunal. State agricultural societies appeal to\r\nState Governments for cooperation, and when received, the industrial\r\ninterests of the country are advanced thereby. We all know what State\r\nGovernments have done for the cause of education. Sections of country\r\nwhich would at this hour have been in a state of almost semi-barbarism\r\nhave--thanks to our educational policy--been redeemed from their\r\nprejudices against intelligence and education, and been made to step\r\ninto line with the advancing columns of civilization. The same\r\ncivilizing influences, precisely, have been brought to bear, by the\r\nactive part which Government has taken in the improvement of all the\r\nmeans of travel, trade, and the transmission of intelligence. The\r\nintelligent and active few have thus advanced the interests of the many.\r\nIn districts of country which have been without the channels of commerce\r\nexcept in a very rude condition, and where the enterprise of the people\r\nwas inadequate to their improvement, the Government has reached out its\r\nstrong arm and redeemed them from their primitive rudeness, thereby\r\npromoting the physical condition, the enlightenment, and the culture of\r\nthe people. There are plenty of instances on record, in which\r\nimprovements of this kind--of roads, for example--have been made against\r\nthe will and in spite of the opposition of the people most to be\r\nbenefited thereby; and had they not been related under the same\r\ngovernment to communities more intelligent and enterprising than\r\nthemselves, they would have remained in an isolated and semi-barbarous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nNow, while we readily discern the increase in the objects and in the\r\nmachinery of government, we cannot so readily discern the abatement of\r\ngovernmental interference with the private affairs of the individual, as\r\nin governments of longer standing. There has not been time for great\r\nchanges in this respect; and then, in the earliest legislation of our\r\ncountry there was comparatively so little that was obnoxious to\r\nindividual freedom, that there has been less occasion for the change in\r\nquestion. The Blue Laws of Connecticut are proverbial for their\r\nintermeddling with private life. There has been no change in this\r\nrespect so marked since the organization of our Government as there was\r\nbefore; but so far as there has been any, it is in favor of the\r\nexemption of the individual, in ordinary times, from legal interference.\r\nThe entire atmosphere of American society is becoming more liberal as\r\ngeneral education advances; and this, in turn, acts upon the legislative\r\nand executive functions of the Government, to make the laws and the\r\nexecution of the same more acceptable to a cultured people. The 'Maine\r\nLaw,' earnest and benevolent as it was in purpose, and to all seeming so\r\nobviously founded in the right of society to protect itself, could not\r\nbe sustained against this tendency in government to let the individual\r\nalone in the affairs of his private life.\r\n\r\nWe have observed that there is a concentration of different industrial\r\nand commercial functions in different sections of the country, whereby\r\nthese sections become dependent upon each other, and the unity of the\r\nwhole, to a certain extent, made inevitable. Now, we insist that\r\npolitical economy and the greatest well-being of all require that the\r\npolitical jurisdiction should, as far as possible, be commensurate with\r\nthat commercial, industrial, and social dependence which works itself\r\nout to a large degree of fulfilment in spite of the obstructions\r\ninterposed by the contractedness and isolation of political\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, this dependence of one industrial section upon another,\r\nand of one commercial centre upon another, as the result of commercial\r\nand industrial specialization, is becoming more and more marked as a\r\ndevelopment of human progress. All this increases the need for more\r\nextensive political organization, while at the same time it makes it\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be perceived that since industrial and commercial\r\ndevelopment is necessitating dependence and unity, it is equally true\r\nthat the natural varieties of soil and climate are, also, conditions of\r\nlike dependence and unity. When these diversities of soil in different\r\nsections are fully developed, and the exchange of products readily made\r\nthrough improved commercial facilities, and human wants multiplied by\r\nmeans of civilized culture, agricultural specialization creates the\r\ndemand, not for political division and isolation, but for more extensive\r\norganization. That New England manufactures is no reason that she should\r\nseparate her government from that of the other States, but just the\r\nreverse. That the Middle States are more distinctively a mining region,\r\nand the great West agricultural, is no reason that their general\r\ngovernment should be distinct, but precisely the reverse. That the South\r\nproduces cotton, rice, and sugar, is no reason for her seceding from the\r\nUnion, but exactly the reverse. These diversified interests, we repeat,\r\ncreate interrelation and dependence, unitizing the commercial and\r\nindustrial polity; and the political organization should, as far as\r\npossible, be coextensive therewith. There are physical necessities which\r\nprevent the formation and maintenance of a comprehensive political\r\norganization in the earlier stages of civilization, but these never have\r\nobtained in the United States, and every hour's improvement carries us\r\nfarther beyond them.\r\n\r\nAll the results of a progressive civilization are constantly\r\ncomplicating the dependence and interrelation of various sections of our\r\ncountry. Roads, railroads, canals, and lines of telegraph, by their\r\nconnections and intersections, are so many bonds of union between the\r\nvarious districts of our country--so many bonds of union between the\r\nvarious States of the confederacy--and forbid its dissolution. Even\r\nNature conspires with civilization to the same end. The great valleys\r\nand rivers running north and south are so many natural ties, which the\r\nmost incorrigible perverseness, on the part of man, could alone prevent\r\nfrom performing the office to which they seem so happily adapted in the\r\nplay of the civilized elements.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in our brief view of Europe, greater political\r\nunitization has been the result of growth in civilization. In the United\r\nStates, all natural, commercial, and industrial bonds of union are\r\nbecoming more fully developed. This evinces the direction of progress.\r\n\r\nWhat, in the light of this view, are we to think of the doctrine of\r\n'secession'?--of secession, that political dogma of recent development,\r\nwhich, if made practical, would destroy all political unity of greater\r\ncompass than a State--a State, the idol of Southern political worship.\r\nIt would break any confederacy into fragments, and prevent the\r\nconsummation of those great unities which an advancing civilization\r\ndemands. This doctrine of 'secession' would remand us back to the\r\ncondition of affairs in Europe during the twelfth century, before\r\ncommerce, the Crusades, and the waking up of intelligence had commenced\r\nthe movement of national organization. The Southern States have a\r\nbarbarian institution in their midst, but, not satisfied with that, they\r\nwould inaugurate the practical operation of a new political doctrine,\r\nwhich must introduce still another element of barbarism, and interpose\r\nan additional obstacle to the progress of civilization. Shall this be?\r\nIt is opposed to the political tendency of the times; and the common\r\nsense of mankind should forbid the acceptance of a political solecism in\r\nthe organization of government, which virtually annuls the unity and\r\nintegrity of the government itself.\r\n\r\nThere are crises, however, in human development, when the movement is\r\nrapidly set forward; and others, when it may be as suddenly arrested or\r\nthrown back, requiring long periods to regain the lost ground,\r\npreparatory to a new advance. Our Union, only a brief while since,\r\nappeared to be upon the point of irreparable rupture; the division of\r\nthis great Union into minor geographical districts, like the European\r\nmonarchies, seemed to be imminent. The determination of the South to\r\nsecede; a large portion of the influential press at the North pleading\r\ntheir cause; Buchanan favoring secession; many in the North, then, and\r\nfor a long time previous, in favor of a 'peaceable separation;'\r\nbut--thanks to the blind impetuosity of 'Southern chivalry'--with the\r\nfall of Sumter, and the inauguration of the war, the only hope for this\r\nUnion revived! Wicked or foolish people have said that the bombardment\r\nof Sumter was the death-knell of the Union;--we believe it was just the\r\nreverse;--as the turning point of a great crisis, it signalled the birth\r\nof a new era. It threw the trimming and temporizing politicians of the\r\nNorth off their old tracks, and tore their platforms from under them;\r\ntheir antipathies were suddenly neutralized; their prejudices vanished;\r\nthey were unexpectedly floating anew on the sea of public sentiment; the\r\nopinions of influential men were subject to a new ordeal; and the views\r\nof many an entire clique, faction, and party were revolutionized in a\r\nday. Northern pride was wounded; Anglo-Saxon energy was aroused; there\r\nwas a demand for determination and 'pluck,' and the result is known to\r\nall. Secession, in the Free States, was suddenly transformed; there was\r\na grand uprising for the vindication of a great principle of political\r\ndevelopment; and nearly a million of armed men of all parties are now in\r\nthe field; and God grant that they may be able to overcome the abettors\r\nof a barbarian policy!\r\n\r\nBut if the cause of patriotism and civilization should fail in this\r\nstruggle, what will be the consequences? Standing armies, stronger\r\ngovernments, leagues, and ruptures, internecine wars, European\r\ninterference. Let this division of our once happy country be consummated\r\nnow, and there can be no reunion for ages. The Southern nation\r\nrecognized by European Governments, treaties and alliances formed, and\r\nwe are involved in European complications through which the separation\r\nwill be perpetuated. And this disunion made permanent, others will\r\ndevelop themselves, and in time be consummated. It is the interest of\r\nthe reigning dynasties in Europe to see our nation dismembered: the\r\nSouth would be our rival; and we should not have power to enforce union\r\nhereafter. When a politico-geographical weakness is developed along the\r\nRocky Mountains, the Pacific States will not be without ambitious\r\ndemagogues to attempt the establishment of an independent organization\r\non the Pacific. Another fracture may be developed along the Alleghanies,\r\nand the great agricultural West may set up for itself among the nations.\r\nNew England may be seized with a like madness, and unworthily aspire to\r\na separate national existence. With all these petty nations on this\r\ncontinent, there must be standing armies, leagues, and complications, as\r\nin Europe. Diplomacy, with its intrigues, and wars to maintain the\r\n'balance of power,' will make up the great body of national history and\r\nabsorb those energies which should be employed in advancing the means of\r\nhuman well-being.\r\n\r\nBut we will not speculate upon probabilities so remote. We will presume\r\nthe success of rebellion, and one nation south, another north. The evil\r\nwould still be very great. There must be armed thousands maintained by\r\nthe two Governments to be ready for war at any moment. Two such nations,\r\neven if both were free, and still less with slavery in one of them,\r\ncould not exist by the side of each other without frequent broils and\r\ncollisions. Standing armies exhaust the resources of nations and retard\r\nthe progress of civilization by a double result. They withdraw\r\nable-bodied men from the productive energies of the country, and are at\r\nthe same time a tax upon the industrial forces which remain. The\r\nenormous daily expense of the present war must give us some idea of the\r\ncost of maintaining a standing army of two or three hundred thousand men\r\neven in times of peace. This has done a great deal to retard the\r\nprogress of Europe; and that we, as a nation, have heretofore been free\r\nfrom this encumbrance, is doubtless one of the reasons why we have made\r\nsuch rapid strides in so much that makes a nation great and happy. But\r\nstanding armies imply war, and the international wars of Europe have\r\ndone much to exhaust her resources and paralyze her prosperity. Guizot\r\nsays--and we may see it in history for ourselves--that 'for nearly three\r\ncenturies, foreign relations form the most important part of history.'\r\nForeign relations, wars, treaties, alliances, alone occupy the attention\r\nand fill the page of history. Sad result of the political divisions of a\r\ncontinent! Unhappy fruits of maintaining the balance of power among\r\nneighboring nations! Let this continent be warned! And now is the\r\ncrisis when this warning needs most to be heeded. And even if this\r\ncritical juncture should be safely passed, we have need to guard against\r\nothers, and these truths should be universally recognized as elements of\r\nour national preservation. We may profit by the shipwreck of others, to\r\navoid the rock on which they split. There are causes clearly discernible\r\nin the history of Europe, for the divisions of that continent, which do\r\nnot now, and never have obtained here. Her political institutions were\r\ndeveloped out of the chaos of barbarism, and she had to unite smaller\r\njurisdictions into larger ones; and she did this as well as the status\r\nof civilization would permit at the period when national organization\r\nwas effected.\r\n\r\nThe facilities of intercourse between a people, for the transmission of\r\nintelligence, for travel and transportation--those accompaniments of\r\ncivilization which bring remote sections of country near each other and\r\nbind them together; the resemblance or the difference of languages\r\nspoken; the antipathies, prejudices, sympathies of the peoples--all\r\nthese are elements which go to determine the geographical extent of a\r\nnation. Original difference of language, local prejudices, the want of\r\ncivilization, contributed to limit the European nationalities to the\r\nsmall extent of territory which, for the most part, they occupy. These\r\ncauses have not operated against us. Local distinctions on account of\r\nlanguage do not even obtain here. There are no real causes to contract\r\nthe geographical boundaries of our Government; while, on the other hand,\r\nthe constant increase of facilities for the commercial and social\r\nintercourse of one section with another, and the specializations of the\r\nagricultural, manufacturing, and commercial interests, in the creation\r\nof dependence between different sections of the country, demand, in the\r\nname of science, common sense, justice, and the good of the people, that\r\nthis Government shall remain one and undivided.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, therefore, afford to allow the present or any other rupture\r\nto become permanent, and entail upon ourselves and our children all the\r\ndisadvantages and calamities incident thereto. It would not be wise to\r\nprepare the political stage of this country for the reenaction of the\r\ntragedies of Europe. Better any sacrifice than this. Even if we should\r\nlose great battles, or if European interference should threaten, it\r\nwould be better to rally the people anew even to the raising and\r\nequipment of millions of men, and sustain the war at this enormous cost,\r\nrather than entail division and its necessary calamities on the future\r\npolitical life of this continent. This war is costing immensely in men\r\nand property; but if, thereby, the integrity of the Union can be\r\nmaintained, it will be an economy both in men and means, if only a brief\r\nperiod of the future be taken into the account. We are often reduced to\r\na choice of evils. War is a great evil, but it may prevent others still\r\ngreater. The indiscriminate arming of slaves and the spread of\r\nincendiary fires would be great calamities, but nevertheless\r\njustifiable, if the only means of selfdefence, or of preventing still\r\ngreater and more enduring calamities. But there need be no violation of\r\nthe ethics of war, no infringement of the rights of humanity. The North\r\nis strong in its natural resources, strong in the justice of its cause:\r\nit has risen to vindicate the cardinal law of civilization, and by this\r\nshall it conquer. There appeared to Constantine a vision of the cross,\r\nwith the motto, 'By this conquer.' Science has descended in these last\r\ndays to dwell among mankind. In her hand is a scroll which she unfolds\r\nbefore the nations, and they read, 'Unity, the consummation of social\r\nand political destiny.' Thereupon, turning to our nation in the hour of\r\ntrial, she says: 'The time is approaching when the principle of\r\nunitization must sweep a wider circle, and you are chosen to inaugurate\r\nthis new era in the destiny of nations. Thus far you have done well; be\r\ntrue to the work so happily begun; carry it unflinchingly through this\r\nordeal, and you will be the greatest Power for good upon the earth.\r\nThere must be an extension of political organization--a widening of the\r\nsphere of political unity; and through your example and influence will\r\nthe nations be gathered into a larger fold.' And pointing to the scroll,\r\nshe adds: 'Let 'Union' be eternally your motto; by this conquer!'\r\n\r\nIf we should apply no other than a superficial interpretation to\r\nhistory, overlooking the great laws by which development proceeds, and\r\nthence conclude that the world is to follow doggedly in the footsteps of\r\nthe past, we should anticipate a future far less beautiful in grand\r\nresults than Destiny has in store for the generations to come.\r\n\r\nAre we to have the Empire of Rome or of Charlemagne over again? In the\r\nRoman Empire there were no common interests; no representation; no\r\ncommunication among the people; no intersection of the country by the\r\nnetworks of roads--only great military roads leading from province to\r\nprovince; no specialization of industrial and commercial interests; no\r\ncivilized dependence of one part on another; no natural ties as yet\r\ndeveloped to their real significance between the several countries of\r\nthe Roman Empire: it was held together by the strong and despotic arm of\r\nRome. The Empire of Charlemagne embraced the territory of Middle and\r\nWestern Europe, inhabited by barbarous peoples, isolated, warlike, and\r\nspeaking different languages; there were none of the civilized bonds of\r\nunion; only the genius of Charlemagne held them together; and upon his\r\ndeath the huge fabric he had reared naturally fell to pieces. The\r\nSpanish Empire is but another instance showing that geographical and\r\nother elements of disconnection must not overbalance those which relate\r\nremote sections to each other, and bind them together in a common\r\ninterest, else dissolution will be the result. In respect to the United\r\nStates, all these conditions are reversed. Every interest in the natural\r\ncourse of development points to union--demands union, and, in the\r\ntriumph of justice, shall have union.\r\n\r\nIs there anything in the way of this union? Is there a morbid growth--a\r\ncause of irritation and disease tending to dissolution? Then, it must be\r\nremoved. Is ambitious and reckless demagoguism to be apprehended? Then\r\neducate the people and diffuse science. But is there not still a worse\r\ndevil to be cast out? Where slavery is, you cannot educate the people,\r\nyou cannot diffuse science; and without enlightenment there can be no\r\npolitical justice, since unprincipled demagogues will sway all political\r\ndestiny. Slavery cannot always exist side by side with freedom; it is\r\nthe natural enemy of union, the enemy of civilization. Prominent\r\nsecession leaders have admitted that slavery is the cause of this war,\r\nboasting at the same time that the confederate constitution is founded\r\non a scientific distinction of races. Without slavery there could be no\r\nsufficient motive for the independent national existence of the South.\r\nHad there been no slavery, there had been no civil war. This is, at the\r\npresent time, the political significance of the institution. There is no\r\nsafety but in its extinction--so far at least as the border Slave States\r\nare concerned, in order to overthrow its power in the United States\r\nSenate, to enlarge the sympathies of freedom, and weaken and\r\ncircumscribe the chances for revolutionary movements which slavery will\r\nbe ready at any critical moment to precipitate against the Union.\r\n\r\nIf we have not misinterpreted the law of development, slavery, as it\r\nexists in this country, is a morbid political condition, a social\r\ndisease, which stands in the way of the natural course of social\r\nevolution. In this law, therefore, is written the doom of slavery. The\r\nenlightened world will not always permit it to blast the fair field of\r\ncivilization by its poisonous presence.\r\n\r\nThere is a law of human movement by which predominating conditions\r\nextend and perpetuate themselves, overcoming those which are weaker and\r\non the wane. We observed this in our brief survey of the feudal system.\r\nFreedom is now in the ascendant, and slavery must go down. And since\r\nsecession is the child of slavery, and both at war with the cardinal\r\nprinciples of progressive civilization, it is meet that both should fall\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThis war may not directly extinguish slavery, and it may; we do not see\r\nthe end. But if not directly, we believe the war is, nevertheless,\r\nindirectly setting those forces into action which will eventually\r\nextinguish the institution. If the 'confederacy' should be destroyed,\r\nas, if not saved by foreign intervention, it certainly will be, slavery,\r\nif not already dead, will be pent up, and, in that case, will soon die\r\nby its own hands.\r\n\r\nImmediate interests control us more than those which are remote;\r\ninterests which affect ourselves, more than those which affect our\r\ndescendants. Citizens of the Southern States, to save a petty individual\r\ninterest, are nursing in the bosom of society a malignant canker, which,\r\nif let alone, must one day, in the inevitable course of destiny, eat\r\ninto its vitals. Heroic treatment will alone meet the demands of the\r\ncase. It must be a surgical operation that will penetrate to the very\r\nroots of the invading tumor.\r\n\r\nThe salvation of the South itself, as well as of the Union, hangs upon\r\nthe extinction of slavery. Indeed, the South has far more interest than\r\nthe North in the restoration of political health as the condition of\r\npolitical union; and she would see it so, if slavery had not made her\r\nblind. The elimination of slavery would, in the end, be clear gain to\r\nher, while she would reap equally with the North the advantages of\r\nunion, and escape the disadvantages and calamities which, as we have\r\nseen, must inevitably follow in the wake of confirmed disunion.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this article bases his opposition to slavery solely upon\r\npolitico-scientific grounds; he urges the recognition of a great law of\r\nhuman development, that its bearings on human destiny may be fairly\r\nseen, and human endeavor more wisely directed to the achievement of the\r\nend 'so devoutly to be wished.' The discussion of American Destiny in\r\nall its ramifications would involve the discussion of the ultimate fate\r\nof the negro race on this continent; but that is not within the range of\r\nour present purpose. We have aimed only to indicate the law of\r\ndevelopment from the simple to the complex, over which a necessary unity\r\nat length prevails; to show that this law obtains in the political as in\r\nall other realms; to insist that political unity should enlarge its area\r\nas facilities for intercommunication permit, and the interrelation of\r\nindustrial, commercial, and social interests demand; that the\r\njurisdiction of the political unity should correspond to the extension\r\nof general interests, so far as may be possible in the face of physical\r\nnecessities not yet overcome in the progress of civilization. We would\r\napply the doctrine more especially to the present crisis in American\r\naffairs, to enable us to realize that all our sacrifices to maintain the\r\nUnion are fully warranted by the great principle of human development\r\nwhich is involved in the contest.\r\n\r\nIf we have rightly interpreted history and the law, these sacrifices are\r\njustified by a double consideration. The first, which is negative--to\r\navoid the entanglements, broils, and conflicts of neighboring nations,\r\nand the consequent exhaustion of the resources of civilization, through\r\nwhich its progress would necessarily be retarded; the second, which is\r\npositive--to maintain a vast political organization on this continent in\r\naccordance with the demands of a higher civilization, as the only sure\r\nguarantee for the integrity of the 'Monroe doctrine,' and the\r\naccomplishment of a great political mission, by reacting upon Europe,\r\nand leading her isolated and fragmentary nationalities into a higher\r\nunity, involving order, authority, and the economy of power.\r\n\r\nIt is the selfish interest of the crowned heads of the little nations of\r\nEurope to maintain things as they are, with a principality and a palace\r\nfor each puppet of royalty. Hence their costly machinery for maintaining\r\nthe 'balance of power.' There may have been a use for this in the\r\nignorance of the masses, when the extension of sovereignty was often but\r\nthe increase of despotism; but there is no such need in the advanced\r\nculture of the people and the progress of civilization. Formerly there\r\nwas no public sentiment; but, with the rise of civilized methods, it\r\nbecame developed, and it has gradually enlarged its sphere, till, as a\r\nwriter on dynamical physiology remarks, 'we now hear of the public\r\nopinion of Europe.' (Draper.) And we believe that, before this public\r\nsentiment, thrones are doomed to topple, and sceptres and diadems to\r\nfall, to make way for the more liberal and comprehensive political\r\norganizations of an advancing and triumphant civilization. And herein\r\nappears a glimpse of the political mission of the American Union,\r\ndestined itself to become still more comprehensive in the inevitable\r\nfluctuation and change of the political elements. It is a hackneyed\r\ntheme that all the natural features of our country, its mountains,\r\nrivers, valleys, lakes, are on a grand scale; it is, therefore, meet\r\nthat we should lead the civilized world in the movement of political\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nWhen Russia shall have more completely filled up the measure of her\r\ncivilization, and general intelligence shall have secured the liberty of\r\nthe subject, and laid forever the ghost of political absolutism, it may\r\nbecome the mission of the younger nation to infuse new life into the\r\npolitical system of Europe. With such a nation on the East, and a great\r\ncontinental policy well advanced in the Western World, Middle and\r\nWestern Europe could hardly maintain its present divided, discordant,\r\nand consequently feeble condition: there must be union then, if not\r\nbefore. With Europe thus united, having outgrown the diplomatic\r\nintrigues and exhausting wars of jealous and ambitious rulers, the dream\r\nof 'universal peace' may realize the inauguration of its fulfilment, and\r\ncivilization come to have a meaning which, as yet, is folded up in the\r\nbosom of prophecy--the clearer prophecy, we believe, of science and\r\nhistory. We are confident that the prestige of the past and the earnest\r\nof the future are for us and our cause; that our nation will not be torn\r\nto pieces and sunk to the dead level of political imbecility, but will\r\nvictoriously avouch the integrity of American unity, and gradually gain\r\nthe advance in the grand march of civilization, and lead the nations for\r\nhundreds of years to come!\r\n\r\nWe may well be proud that we are Americans, and that our lot is cast in\r\nthese times. Let us never abase our position by the least approach to\r\nignoble compromise; let us shrink from no responsibility; but acquit\r\nourselves as becomes an intelligent people conscious of a noble\r\ndestiny!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH OF THE LILY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Rose had bloomed in Eden. Odors new\r\n   Entranced the groves; and iridescent birds,\r\n   At this new birth of beauty, sudden rose\r\n   In richest chorus, bearing up the balm\r\n   Upon their beating wings. The bee had learned\r\n   The place of golden sweets, the butterfly\r\n   Loved well to dream within those crimson folds,\r\n   And Eve had made a garland delicate,\r\n   Of feathery sprays and leaves and drooping bells,\r\n   And placed the Rose, the queen of bloom, above\r\n   The centre of her brow. Thus she bound up\r\n   The golden ripples that fell down and broke\r\n   O'er her white breast, hiding the bosom buds,\r\n   That never yet had yielded up their sweets\r\n   To the warm pressure of an infant's lip.\r\n   And Eve had bent above the glassy lake,\r\n   Smiling upon her picture, pressing close\r\n   The soft cheek of the Rose upon her own,\r\n   And praising God for beauty and for life.\r\n\r\n   But now a morn had come more strangely dear\r\n   Than Eden yet had known. The sleeping wind\r\n   Woke not to stir the fringes of the lake,\r\n   Nor shook the odors from the scented plant.\r\n   A silver, misty wreath closed fondly down\r\n   Above the waveless tide. The insect world\r\n   Lay waiting in the leaves, as though a spell\r\n   Had hushed Creation; yet expectant thrills\r\n   Ran through the silence, for the loaded air\r\n   Grew lighter, purer, and the recent Rose\r\n   Drooped her proud head in meekness, and the face\r\n   Of heaven flushed with burning brilliancy,\r\n   Above some coming wonder.\r\n\r\n                                One by one\r\n   The beasts and birds of Paradise came down,\r\n   With noiseless movement, to the water's edge,\r\n   And waited on the margin. Creatures huge,\r\n   With honest, liquid eyes, and those that stepped\r\n   With cushioned feet and feathered footfall, stole\r\n   About the brink, with all the tribe that gave\r\n   The forest life. The serpent reared its crest,\r\n   Not yet polluted with the valley's dust,\r\n   And stood like one with royal gems encrowned;\r\n   While beast, and bird, and serpent turned to gaze\r\n   Upon each other with inquiring eyes,\r\n   And half-bewildered glance.\r\n\r\n                      Then last of all\r\n   Came Eve with Adam to the circling rim,\r\n   Her fingers grasping roses, and her lip\r\n   All beautiful with Love's own witchery.\r\n   She stood and noted with admiring look\r\n   The strength of Adam's form, the expansive chest,\r\n   The sloping muscle, and the sinew knit,\r\n   The firm athletic limb, and every grace\r\n   Combined and joined in that first, perfect man.\r\n   Then Eve, grown humble in her wondrous love\r\n   Of Adam's beauty, knelt upon the turf,\r\n   While her long hair fell down in shining waves,\r\n   And pressed her lip upon his dew-washed feet:\r\n   Then with her agitated fingers broke\r\n   The foxglove pitcher from the stem, and stooped\r\n   To fill it up for him; but quickly drew\r\n   Her pearl-white hand away from the still lake,\r\n   And held it o'er her heart, with such a look\r\n   Of awe and mystery, as if a spell\r\n   Was on the water, that she dared not break.\r\n\r\n   So all was hushed and waiting; when, behold!\r\n   A flash of gold shot from the silver East,\r\n   A gush of new perfume spread through the grove,\r\n   The Rose drooped lower, and the impatient birds,\r\n   Loosed from restraint, sang in a strain refined\r\n   Of dulcet clearness, such as those young bowers\r\n   Had never heard before. The beast crouched down\r\n   Upon the velvet turf, the serpent's crown\r\n   Flashed richer splendor, and the angel-guard\r\n   Whose fearful sword gleamed by the Tree of Life,\r\n   His very plumes were tremulous with joy.\r\n\r\n   Then Eve looked o'er the swelling wave, and, lo!\r\n   The lake was overspread with blooming stars,\r\n   Or snowy golden-centred cups, that rocked\r\n   And spilled the choicest incense. Adam cried,\r\n   'The Lily;' but the sweet voice at his side,\r\n   Grown tremulous and faint with overjoy,\r\n   Could only whisper, 'Purity.' Then quick,\r\n   With restless hands, she culled the floral star--\r\n   Queen of the wave--emblem of innocence,\r\n   And hung it in the lion's matted mane,\r\n   And twined it round the serpent's glittering neck;\r\n   Thus humoring her fancy in the play\r\n   Till half the morning hours had slipped and gone.\r\n   Then, startled by the voice she loved so well,\r\n   She left the sport, the creatures, and the flowers,\r\n   And hastened back with Adam to the trees\r\n   Where God was walking in the solemn shade.\r\n   O mother frail, thou hast not known a tear!\r\n   Thy spirit, clothed in simple innocence,\r\n   Wears the true garb of bliss. Not yet thy hour\r\n   Of sorrow and departure; nor the pangs\r\n   And mystery of motherhood are thine!\r\n   And yet, weak one! some day, because of thee,\r\n   God's love shall give a Saviour to the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--WEBSTER's _Dictionary._\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART SECOND._\r\n\r\n     'I have been young and now I am old, and I bear my testimony that I\r\n     have never found thorough, pervading, enduring morality with any\r\n     but such as feared God--not in the modern sense, but in the old\r\n     child-like way. And only with such, too, have I found a rejoicing\r\n     in life--a hearty, victorious cheerfulness, of so distinguished a\r\n     kind that no other is to be compared with it.'--JACOBI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this narrative naturally closes with the termination\r\nof our hero's career at Burnsville, and his establishing himself as a\r\nresident of New York.\r\n\r\nUp to this period, he has had no great difficulty in making his conduct\r\nconsistent with his religious professions. He certainly has striven with\r\na species of conscientiousness to do so, and we repeat, he has achieved\r\nhis object.\r\n\r\nNow, however, he is embarking on a very different sea from the quiet,\r\nplacid waters of his village life. Here, Hiram Meeker, you will\r\nencounter many and frequent temptations to _do_ wrong. For you are soon\r\nto commence on your \"own account,\" and then you must prepare for that\r\nmortal struggle, in which none, without the grace of God to aid them,\r\ncan come off victors.\r\n\r\nHiram understands this: that is, he has been educated to believe it.\r\nSurely he enjoys saving grace. Who more constant at church and evening\r\nmeetings; who prays longer and more vigorously than he?\r\n\r\nLet me repeat that Hiram has a strong desire to enter the kingdom of\r\nHeaven, and thinks that all the chances are in favor of his doing so.\r\nBut this desire is of the same nature as his wish to become rich. It is\r\nfounded on the determination to promote the fortunes of the individual\r\n_me_, here and hereafter. It leads him to treat as a _principle_ the\r\nstatement of _fact_, that \"honesty is the best policy;\" and his policy\r\nis--Self. He can practically master the theory of cause and effect as to\r\nwhat is going on _here_. And since he believes he will secure a good\r\nposition in the world to come by strict observance of the \"ordinances,\"\r\nhe considers himself all right _there_.\r\n\r\nIt is with entire complacency, then, that Hiram Meeker sets sail in New\r\nYork. He is young, and, as the word goes, handsome; with good health,\r\nstrong nerves, an enduring frame, and excellent constitution. He is well\r\neducated, and has a remarkable capacity for affairs, with sufficient\r\nexperience in business to qualify him for any mercantile career he\r\nchooses to enter on. Moreover, in all the relations of life, he\r\nprofesses to be governed by the highest possible principle--Christian\r\nprinciple; and claims to be, indeed really is, at least theoretically, a\r\nbeliever in the truths of our holy religion. Why is it, then, reader,\r\nyou have already taken such a prejudice against Hiram? For I know, as it\r\nwere instinctively, that you are prejudiced against him. Indeed, I\r\nconfess that in preparing his history for the press, I have\r\nunconsciously permitted certain comments to creep in, indicating my own\r\nfeelings toward the young man. But, in fact, I could not help it,\r\nespecially when I came to narrate Hiram's course toward Sarah Burns.\r\n\r\nBut here in New York, I begin to feel a painful interest for young\r\nMeeker. He is at the \"parting of the ways.\" Up to now, there has been no\r\ngreat strain on his moral sense, while he has not been altogether\r\ninsensible to humanizing influences. He has been thus far in the service\r\nof others, and had wisdom enough to understand it was best for him to\r\nserve with fidelity. Thus, his sense of duty did not conflict with his\r\ninterests, and he won golden opinions from all.\r\n\r\nProbably, when he left Burnsville, but one person thoroughly knew\r\nhim--that person was Sarah Burns. For it is given to those whose hearts\r\nare honestly _devoted_, in time to learn and fully comprehend the nature\r\nof the hearts brought in contact with theirs.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies universally recalled their delightful flirtations with\r\nHiram with a sort of pleasurable regret, in which no angry feelings\r\ntoward him were mingled. Even Mary Jessup looked back with a sentimental\r\nsigh, but not with any feeling of bitterness, to the period when she was\r\nso happy with \"young Meeker, boarding at their house.\" The Hawkins girls\r\nstill severally had their secret hopes in the future. [As to the widow\r\nHawkins, I cannot say.] But nobody understood the young man except Sarah\r\nBurns. _He_ knew that, and when he drove away from her door, he felt he\r\nwas _found out_.\r\n\r\nI am getting from my subject, which is Hiram's dangerous situation, now\r\nthat he has reached New York. One thing much to be regretted is that he\r\nhas resolved, at least for the present, to adjure society, in his entire\r\ndevotion to his main purpose. This is an alarming feature. For\r\nnotwithstanding, in his intercourse with the sex, he had sought entirely\r\nhis own pleasure, still it was not without its qualifying influences.\r\nHis mind was diverted from a perpetual thought of how he should get\r\nrich, and nature (I mean the nature common to us all) was permitted to\r\nhave a certain sway.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram stepped foot in the metropolis, he cut off these diverting\r\nelements. He decided, and he had long and carefully considered it, that\r\nin the strife in which he was soon to enter, he should require all his\r\ntime, all his faculties. For this reason, he determined to accept Mr.\r\nEastman's offer of board and lodging at his house, albeit his wife was\r\nshrewish and generally disagreeable. He no longer permitted the gay\r\nthrong in Broadway to move his nerves or excite his senses. And thus all\r\nthese secondary impulses and emotions and sentiments yielded to the one\r\nmain controlling purpose.\r\n\r\nYes, Hiram Meeker, I feel a painful interest in your situation. I see\r\nthat, once entered on your career, there will be no departure or\r\ndeviation or pause in it. As in metal poured into the mould, which,\r\nwhile it remains in a fluid state, is capable of being converted into\r\nother forms, but which, after a time, fixes and becomes\r\nunchangeable,--so, in the life of every human being, there is a period\r\nwhen the aims and purposes are fixed and the character is settled\r\nforever. With some, this comes earlier, with others later; but it comes\r\ninevitably to all of us.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me Hiram is fast approaching this epoch, and this is why my\r\ninterest in him becomes painful. For after this--but I will not\r\nanticipate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which Hiram undertook after getting settled at his\r\nboarding place, was to decide what church to attend. This was a matter\r\nwhich required a great deal of deliberation, and week after week he\r\nvisited different churches of his own faith.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett, with his family, went to an Episcopal church. He took the\r\nliberty, one day, of flatly advising his cousin to cut Presbyterianism,\r\nand go with him.\r\n\r\n'The fact is, Hiram, I can't stand the blue lights; they make a\r\nhypocrite of you, or a sniveller. Now, I don't profess to be a good\r\nperson, but I think, after all, my neighbors know about where to find\r\nme. As to the Episcopalians, they give us good music, good prayers, and\r\nshort sermons. They don't come snooping about to find out whether you go\r\nsometimes to the theatre, or if any of your family practise the damnable\r\nsin of dancing at parties. They mind their own business, and leave you\r\nto mind yours.'\r\n\r\n'What _is_ their business?' asked Hiram.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett, taken a little aback, hesitated a moment; then he replied,\r\n'Why, to preach and read the service, and perform church duties\r\ngenerally.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Hiram, 'I always thought it was a part of a minister's duty\r\nto look after the spiritual welfare of every one of his church, and to\r\nvisit the families, and converse with all the members.'\r\n\r\n'You forget you're not in the country, where everything is got up on an\r\nentirely different basis,' replied Mr. Bennett. 'You won't find much\r\n'pastoral' work here, even among the blue lights. They confine\r\nthemselves to preaching brimstone sermons from the pulpit and at evening\r\nlectures, and giving orders about the management of your family and\r\nmine, taking care that nobody shall enjoy anything if they can help it.\r\nIf you go to see a play, it is a plunge into Tophet; if you permit your\r\nchild to tread a quickstep to a lively tune, both you and your child are\r\nfit subjects for the wrath to come.'\r\n\r\n'I rather think you are mistaken when you say the Episcopalians approve\r\nof the theatre and late parties, and so forth,' retorted Hiram. 'I have\r\nbeen told by two or three of that persuasion, that the clergy object\r\ndecidedly to all these things.'\r\n\r\n'Gammon, Hiram--gammon for the country market. I tell you, I know that\r\nwe can do just what we please in the way of 'rational amusement,' as our\r\nclergyman calls it, and your people can't, and I advise you to come over\r\nto the liberal side.'\r\n\r\nHiram shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Well, if you won't, I recommend Dr. Pratt. He, I understand, permits a\r\nlittle fun occasionally; then he makes use of our prayers, commits them\r\nto memory, you know; and latterly has put on a gown, and has a little\r\nboy to open the door of his pulpit. I advise you to go there.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said Hiram; 'but I don't think I should relish that kind of\r\na man. I prefer something decided one way or the other.'\r\n\r\n'Then take Dr. Chellis, he's your chap. Boanerges! a regular son of\r\nthunder. Egad, I believe he _does_ visit every soul of his flock--keeps\r\nthem straight. The other evening he was invited to a little gathering at\r\nthe house of a new comer in his congregation--he always accepts\r\ninvitations, and they say he is very fond of oysters and chicken salad,\r\nthough he drinks nothing but cold water;--well, it happened the young\r\nfolks wanted to get up a quadrille, began to arrange it innocently\r\nenough before his face and eyes. Thereupon he jumped up in a huff, and\r\nflung himself out of the house, and the next Sunday delivered an extra\r\nblast on the 'immoral tendencies of the dance.'\r\n\r\n'That's the man for me,' said Hiram, firmly.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett regarded his protege with a keen, inquisitive glance, with a\r\nview to fathom him, if possible. It would seem that the result was\r\nunsatisfactory, for after a moment he exclaimed, 'Well, I confess I\r\ndon't exactly see through you. It may be one sort of thing; it may be\r\nanother; but I can't say which.'\r\n\r\n'It is a very simple matter, Mr. Bennett. I was brought up strictly, and\r\nbelieve in my bringing up.'\r\n\r\n'All right, if you mean it.'\r\n\r\n'I do mean it. Besides, now that I have come to New York to reside,\r\nwhere I shall be subjected to the numerous temptations of a city life, I\r\nshall need more than ever to be under the preaching of just such a man\r\nas you describe Dr. Chellis to be.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't; that is coming it too strong; now I think I _do_ understand\r\nyou. But, Hiram, drop all that sort of thing. If you want to join\r\nChellis's church, join it; but talk your cant to the marines.'\r\n\r\nHiram was angry, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n'You must not be vexed, Hiram. You know I want to do you all the good I\r\ncan. Recollect, if you are smart, you have much to learn yet. Let me\r\nhave your confidence, and I will advise you according to my experience.\r\nIf you really like severe preaching, you can't do better than go in for\r\nthe Doctor. He has the richest congregation in New York. Allwise, Tenant\r\n& Co., Starbuck & Briggs, Daniel Story. Those are names for you;\r\nSouth-street men, too, in your line. They are the pillars of Chellis's\r\nchurch; good men and true, if they are blue lights. Besides, there are\r\nlots of pretty girls--tight little Presbyterian saints, with plenty of\r\ncash. Their fathers can buy and sell Dr. Pratt's congregation and mine\r\ntogether. Yes, you are right; I wonder I did not think of it. Go in for\r\nChellis.'\r\n\r\nHiram was still silent. His heightened color and severe expression\r\nshowed how little he relished Mr. Bennett's conversation.\r\n\r\nNothing is so disagreeable to a person whose nature is not thoroughly\r\ngenuine, but who claims to act from proper motives, as to have another\r\ntake it for granted he is not doing so.\r\n\r\nHe did not forget a word that Mr. Bennett had said, though. Indeed, he\r\nrecovered his equanimity so far as to thank him for his suggestions,\r\nand, wishing him good-day, he started for his place in South street.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett watched the young man as he walked up the street (the\r\nconversation occurred in the doorway of H. Bennett & Co.'s\r\nestablishment), and until he had turned the corner. 'Deep, very deep,'\r\nhe muttered as he stepped inside. 'He'll be 'round one of these days, or\r\nI am mistaken.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hiram continued on his way to the store, his cheeks burning\r\nunder the influence of Mr. Bennett's plain talk, but sensibly alive to\r\nthe description of Dr. Chellis's church.\r\n\r\n'Allwise, Tenant & Co., eh? and Starbuck & Briggs (Hiram had been but a\r\nfew weeks in New York, and already had learned to pay that almost\r\nidolatrous deference to great commercial names which is a leading\r\ncharacteristic of the town); that will do. Plenty of rich girls,'--his\r\nheart began to beat quick,--'plenty of rich girls. That's the place for\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nStrange, in this soliloquy he said nothing about the spiritual\r\nadvantages to be derived under the preaching of so noted a divine as Dr.\r\nChellis. Yet Hiram really liked strong preaching and severe discipline.\r\nFor he never appropriated any of the denunciations. Feeling perfectly\r\nsafe himself, it gratified him to hear the awful truths severely\r\nenforced on the outsiders.\r\n\r\nWe see, however, from this little conversation with himself, what was\r\nuppermost in Hiram's mind. Subsequent inquiries, carefully made of\r\nvarious persons, fully confirmed the statement of Mr. Bennett as to\r\nthese little particulars in relation to Dr. Chellis's church and\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nDr. Chellis himself was a person of extraordinary ability, great purity\r\nof character, and great zeal. At this period he was about sixty years of\r\nage, but he possessed the earnestness and energy of a young man. His\r\ncongregation were very much attached to him, and it is true he exercised\r\nover them a remarkable influence. Many people sneered, accusing them of\r\n'being led by the nose by their minister.' They were led, it is true,\r\nbut not in that way: rather by their understanding and their affections.\r\nFor, strict and stern and severe as the 'old Doctor' appeared to be, it\r\nwas the _sin_ he thundered against, not the individual. And those who\r\nwere brought in more intimate contact with him, declared that he was,\r\nafter all, a kind, tender-hearted man.\r\n\r\nHis church were devoted to him. The majority were a severe, toilsome,\r\nself-denying company--too much so, perchance; but of that I dare hazard\r\nno opinion: God knows. Like their minister, sincere, indulging in no\r\ncant; without hypocrisy, practising in the world during the week the\r\nprinciples they professed on Sunday to be governed by; a church\r\ndeserving to be honored for its various charities (it gave twice as much\r\nas any other in the city), for the personal liberality of its members\r\nwhen called on to join in public or private subscriptions, and for the\r\nexalted influence they exerted in affairs generally.\r\n\r\nInto such a church, and among such a people, Hiram Meeker proposes to\r\nintroduce himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis first move was to call on Dr. Chellis without any introduction, and\r\npresent his credentials from the church in Burnsville, as well as an\r\nexcellent letter from his minister, certifying particularly as to his\r\nreligious character and deportment. He thought by going as an\r\nunsophisticated youth from the country he would make a better impression\r\nand more strongly commend himself to the Doctor's sympathy than in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that Hiram's call was rather of a failure. He had no\r\nordinary man to deal with. Dr. Chellis had not only a profound knowledge\r\nof human nature, but a quick insight into its various peculiarities. He\r\ncould classify individuals rapidly; and he read Hiram after fifteen\r\nminutes' conversation.\r\n\r\nThe latter, not accustomed to men of the Doctor's calibre, found himself\r\nwanting in his usual equanimity. His familiar role did not serve, he\r\ncould see that, and for once his resources failed him.\r\n\r\nFor the Doctor did not appear to be specially interested when Hiram,\r\napropos of nothing, except as a last card, undertook, in a meek,\r\nsaint-like manner, to give him an account of his early conviction of sin\r\nand subsequent triumphant conversion. Indeed, if the truth must be told,\r\nthe worthy divine gave evident symptoms--to speak plainly--of being\r\nbored before Hiram's story was half finished! The latter was not slow to\r\nsee this, and he found it difficult to rally.\r\n\r\nAt length he gave the Doctor an opportunity to speak, by bringing his\r\npersonal narrative to a close.\r\n\r\n'You have no acquaintances in the city?'\r\n\r\n'I think I may say none, except in business; and my object in selecting\r\nsuch a church as yours is to keep up the same degree of piety which I\r\nhumbly trust I maintained in my village home.'\r\n\r\n[Pretty well, Hiram, pretty well--but you have an old head to deal\r\nwith, and an honest heart: be careful.]\r\n\r\n'To do that,' replied the Doctor, gravely, 'you must not look back to\r\nwhat you were, or thought you were. Be sure you are in danger when you\r\nfeel complacent about yourself.'\r\n\r\nThese were awful words to Hiram, and from such a severe, grave,\r\ndignified old man.\r\n\r\n'In danger!' That was something new. 'Of what?' Why, no thought of a\r\npossibility of danger had crossed young Meeker's mind since the day he\r\njoined the church in Hampton.\r\n\r\nHe sat quite still, uncertain what reply to make.\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the tones of the Doctor's voice--tones which were\r\nmodified from their previous severity.\r\n\r\n'I will take your letter,' he said, 'and at the next communion, which\r\nwill take place in about six weeks, you will be admitted to membership.'\r\n\r\n'I should like to have a class in the Sunday school,' said Hiram,\r\nbreathing more freely.\r\n\r\n'If you will speak next Sunday to Mr. Harris, the superintendent,'\r\nreplied the Doctor, 'he will furnish you with one. There is a demand for\r\nteachers just at present, I heard him say.'\r\n\r\nDr. Chellis rose, as if Hiram had taken up enough of his time. Our hero\r\ncould but do the same. He bowed and left the room.\r\n\r\n'A pretty sort of minister that,' exclaimed he between his teeth, as he\r\nquitted the house. 'Pious! no more pious than my boot. Never listened to\r\na word I said. I know he didn't. Is it possible I must sit under this\r\nman's preaching? I see now what cousin Bennett meant by things being got\r\nup on an entirely different basis here from what they are in the\r\ncountry. I should think they were. But there is Allwise, Tenant & Co.,\r\nDaniel Story. I may trust myself with such names [he did not say with\r\nsuch _men_]. Ah! h'm--h'm--lots of pretty girls, with plenty of cash.\r\nI'll try it. Anyhow, it stands number one. No mistake about that!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHiram soon learned a lesson. He discovered there were people in New York\r\njust as quickwitted, as keen, and as shrewd as he was himself. This did\r\nnot alarm him. Not a bit. He was only the more ready to appreciate the\r\ntruth of Mr. Bennett's remark, that he had yet much to learn.\r\n\r\n'I see it,' quoth Hiram. 'The city gets the best of everything, by the\r\nnatural course of supply and demand. Yes, it gets the best beef and\r\nmutton and fowls, and fruits and vegetables, and on the same principle\r\nit commands the best men. Well, I like this all the better. It was dull\r\nbusiness in Burnsville, after all, with nobody to compete with. Give me\r\nNew York!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the store of Hendly, Layton & Gibb, Hiram saw and conversed with\r\nshipmasters who were familiar with every port in the world. The reader\r\nwill recollect, at school he had devoted himself to mercantile\r\ngeography. Thus he had located in his mind every principal seaport, and\r\nhad learned what was the nature of the trade with each. The old sea\r\ncaptains were amazed at the pertinence of Hiram's questions, and with\r\nthe information he possessed on topics connected with their business.\r\nThey could scarcely understand it. It gave them a great respect for the\r\n'fellow,' and Hiram speedily became a favorite with them all. He used to\r\nlike to go on board their ships, and chat with them there, whenever he\r\nfound time. Do not suppose these were mere pleasure excursions. Hiram\r\nMeeker was forming his opinion of each one of these captains. For in his\r\nmind's eye he saw some of them in _his_ employ; but which? that was the\r\nquestion. So by mingling with them, he learned much of the mechanical\r\npart of commerce, and he discovered, besides their different characters,\r\nwho were competent and honest, and who were not altogether so.\r\n\r\nHiram also spent a good deal of his time conversing with Eastman, with\r\nwhom he boarded. He got the latter's ideas of business and about the men\r\nthey daily encountered, and Eastman could furnish a fund of valuable\r\ninformation, based on long experience.\r\n\r\nHiram all this time was indefatigable. He watched the course of trade.\r\nHe endeavored to discover the secret of the success of the great South\r\nstreet houses. He worked, he pondered, and yet all the time served\r\nHendly, Layton & Gibb with fidelity. Eastman became attached to him.\r\nMrs. Eastman said the man did not give her half the trouble she\r\nexpected. So you see, in certain quarters, Hiram was as popular as ever.\r\n\r\nMeantime he had secured a seat in and joined Dr. Chellis's church. He\r\nduly presented himself at the Sunday school and obtained a fine class.\r\nFrom that time he never missed a service on Sunday, nor a lecture, or\r\nprayer meeting, or other weekly gathering. He even attended a funeral\r\noccasionally, in his zeal to 'wait' on all the ordinances. He was,\r\nhowever, exceedingly modest and unobtrusive. He did not seek to make\r\nacquaintances, but no one could help noticing his punctilious regularity\r\nand decorum. I have remarked that Hiram determined to cut off what had\r\nbeen a great source of pleasure--society; but he still paid the same\r\nattention to his personal appearance as before. After a while questions\r\nbegan to be asked: 'Who is this new comer, so constant, so devout, and\r\nso exemplary?'\r\n\r\n'What a fine-looking fellow! I wonder who he is?' whispered Miss Tenant\r\nto Miss Stanley, one morning, as our hero passed their seats (they both\r\nhad classes) to take his place with his Sunday school pupils.\r\n\r\n'I don't know, I am sure,' replied her friend.\r\n\r\n'I can't find any one who does. Do you know, _I_ think he is real\r\nhandsome?'\r\n\r\n'So do I, if he would only lift his head up and look people in the face;\r\nhe is as bashful as a sheep.'\r\n\r\n'My little brother is in his class, and he says they all like him so\r\nmuch. He takes such an interest in his pupils.'\r\n\r\n'Then I should think you could find out something about him.'\r\n\r\n'No: his name is Meeker; that's all any one seems to know.'\r\n\r\n'Funny name; I don't like it.'\r\n\r\n'Nor I. Still, we won't condemn him for his name. Besides, I like his\r\nface?'\r\n\r\n'Hush!'\r\n\r\nHere the conversation of the two young people was interrupted by the\r\nrapping of the superintendent, and the services of the school commenced.\r\n\r\nIf young ladies of the importance of Miss Tenant and Miss Stanley begin\r\nto talk about Hiram, you may be certain it will spread through the\r\nschool and into the church. _He_ knew what was going on--of course he\r\ndid; but only took still greater pains with his personal appearance, and\r\nbecame more shy and reserved and assiduously devout.\r\n\r\nThe elders of the church could not help noticing him.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies noticed him.\r\n\r\nHeads of families observed his exemplary deportment.\r\n\r\nWho could he be?\r\n\r\nDr. Chellis, meantime, did not lose sight of his new communicant. They\r\nfrequently met, and Hiram was always greeted, if not with cordiality,\r\nyet kindly. Strange to say, contrary to his habit, the Doctor neglected\r\nor omitted to enter into conversation with Hiram on religious topics. He\r\nfelt a repugance to doing so which he could not explain. Everything\r\nseemed so praiseworthy in Hiram's conduct, that one would suppose the\r\nworthy divine would like to engage him in conversation, as the Rev. Mr.\r\nChase used to do at Burnsville. But a certain aversion prevented it.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to for information about Hiram, the Doctor could say\r\nnothing, for he knew nothing; and so the mystery, for a mystery the\r\nyoung ladies determined to make of it, increased.\r\n\r\nAt last a rumor was circulated that Hiram had been disappointed in a\r\nlove affair. A mischief-loving girl detailed it to Miss Tenant, whose\r\ninterest in the young Sunday school teacher gradually grew stronger, and\r\nit soon became a well-authenticated piece of history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this time a species of intimacy was growing up between Hiram\r\nMeeker and Hill. An odd companionship, you will say; but they seemed to\r\nget along very well together. The latter, as you may remember, was a\r\nwild, reckless fellow. He had his good traits, though. There was nothing\r\nmean in his composition, but much that was impulsive and generous. He\r\nnever laid up a penny, and was always in debt. It was this unfortunate\r\nhabit which had kept him so long at Joslin's. He had got in advance of\r\nhis salary, and he would not quit till it was made up. When he left\r\nthere, he succeeded in getting a place in a large wine and liquor house;\r\nfor Hill's acquaintance was extensive, and in those days of\r\nextraordinary 'drumming,' in which he was a great proficient, his\r\nservices were valuable. It was through Hill, as I have said, that Hiram\r\ngot his place at Hendly's, and after that he was in the habit of looking\r\nin nearly every day on him toward the close of business hours.\r\n\r\nI cannot precisely explain by what species of fascination this poor\r\nfellow was attracted to Meeker. Doubtless it originated in the\r\ntriumphant resistance which the latter opposed to Hill's attempt on him\r\nat their first acquaintance, and his complete victory over and\r\ndiscomfiture of Benjamin Joslin, for whom Hill entertained a supreme\r\ncontempt. There was a mystery about the sources of Hiram's power which\r\ncompleted the charm, and made Hill his willing subject, and afterward\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nBut what did Hiram want of Hill? That would appear more difficult to\r\nanswer. He certainly did want something of him. For he encouraged his\r\ncoming often to see him, and talked with him a great deal. He even lent\r\nhim occasionally small sums of money. I repeat, what a droll\r\ncompanionship! Hill, a swearing, drinking, godless scapegrace. Meeker, a\r\nquiet, exemplary, religious, laborious young man.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the rule by which opposites are attracted to each other.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was something else.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I am inclined to think it was something else, on Hiram's\r\npart at least. I believe he acted, with respect to Hill, as he did with\r\nrespect to everybody--from carefully considered motives. We shall see,\r\nperhaps, by and by, how this was.\r\n\r\nEastman used to wonder that Hiram should tolerate Hill's society. To be\r\nsure, he himself had a sort of family regard for him. But his presence\r\nalways annoyed him. He even expressed his surprise to Hiram, who replied\r\nby making use of the moral argument. He was sorry for the poor fellow.\r\nHe hoped to do him some good. Possibly he might be able to bring him\r\nunder better influences. Certainly Hill would not harm _him_, while, on\r\nthe contrary, he (Hill) might be benefited.\r\n\r\nHiram did not tell the truth.\r\n\r\nReally, if he had dared to stop and inquire of himself, he would be\r\nforced to acknowledge that he did _not_ want Hill to be different from\r\nwhat he was. Then he would not serve his purpose. To be sure, sometimes,\r\nwhen Hill permitted an extra strong oath to escape his lips, Hiram would\r\nfidget and look uneasy, and beg his visitor to break himself of such a\r\nwicked habit. But the secret of Hiram's power did not lie in his _moral_\r\ninfluence certainly, for Hill's habit of swearing did not improve,\r\nindeed it grew worse.\r\n\r\nIn this way passed our hero's first year in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNULLIFICATION AND SECESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe publish the principal part of the speech of Hon. R. J. Walker,\r\nagainst nullification and secession, made at the great Union meeting at\r\nNatchez, Mississippi, on the first Monday of January, 1833. We republish\r\nthis speech from the Natchez _Mississippi Journal_ of that date. Upon\r\nthat speech, Mr. Walker became the Union candidate for Senator of the\r\nUnited States from Mississippi against Mr. Poindexter, a Calhoun\r\nnullifier and secessionist. After a three years' contest of unexampled\r\nviolence, Mr. Walker was elected on the 8th of January, 1836. So\r\ndistinct was the issue, that the Legislature of Mississippi declared\r\nnullification and secession to be treason. The contest was conducted by\r\nMr. Walker by speeches in every county, with the banner of the Union\r\nwaving over him, and to the music of our national airs.\r\n\r\nWe republish this speech now because it preceded Mr. Webster's great\r\nreply to Calhoun, and because its arguments are applicable to the\r\npresent contest. This speech drew out Gen. Jackson's celebrated letter,\r\nheretofore published, in favor of Mr. Walker; and the speech received\r\nthe cordial approval of ex-President Madison. By reference to the\r\nWashington city _Globe_ of the 12th August, 1836, it will be found that,\r\nin conversation with Mr. Ingersoll, 'Mr. Madison spoke very freely of\r\nnullification, which he altogether condemned, remarking that Mr. Walker,\r\nof the Senate, in a speech he had made on some occasion, was the _first\r\nperson_ who had given to the public what he (Mr. Madison) considers the\r\ntrue view of Mr. Jefferson's language on that subject.' Mr. Webster gave\r\nthe Whig arguments against nullification and secession, Mr. Walker the\r\ndemocratic; but they both arrived at the same conclusions:\r\n\r\nNever, fellow citizens, did I rise to address you with such deep and\r\nabiding impressions of the awful character of that crisis which involves\r\nthe existence of the American Union. No mortal eye can pierce the veil\r\nwhich covers the events of the next few months, but we do know that the\r\nscales are now balancing in fearful equipoise, liberty and union in the\r\none hand, anarchy or despotism in the other. Which shall preponderate,\r\nis the startling question to which we must all now answer. Already one\r\nbright, one kindred star is sinking from the banner of the American\r\nUnion, the very fabric of our government is rocking on its foundations,\r\none of its proudest pillars is now moving from beneath the glorious\r\narch, and soon may we all stand amid the broken columns and upon the\r\nscattered fragments of the Constitution of our once united and happy\r\ncountry. Whilst then we may yet recede from the brink of that precipice\r\non which we now stand, whilst we are once more convened as citizens of\r\nthe American Union, and have still a common country, whilst we are yet\r\nfondly gazing, perhaps for the last time, upon that banner which floated\r\nover the army of Washington, and living beneath that Constitution which\r\nbears his sacred name, let us at least endeavor to transmit to\r\nposterity, unimpaired, that Union, cemented by the blood of our\r\nforefathers. The honorable gentleman who has preceded me, in opposition\r\nto the resolutions submitted for your consideration, tells us that he\r\nwas nursed in the principles of '76 and '98--that these are the\r\nprinciples of Carolina, and that they ought to be maintained. Let me\r\nbriefly answer, that the humble individual who now addresses you is the\r\nson of a soldier of the Revolution, and that from the dawning of\r\nmanhood, from his first vote to his last, at all times, and upon all\r\noccasions, he has supported and will support the principles of\r\ndemocracy, and the doctrines of '76 and '98. But it was under the banner\r\nof the Union that the whigs of '76 and '98 achieved their glorious\r\ntriumphs; and is that the standard now unfurled by the advocates of\r\nnullification? It is true, we find nullification declared in the\r\nKentucky resolutions to be a rightful remedy--but nullification by whom?\r\nby a single State? no--by those sovereignties the several States, in the\r\nmode prescribed by the Constitution, by a declaratory amendment\r\nannulling the power under which the law was passed. This would be a\r\nremedy in fact; for it would operate equally on all the States; but can\r\nthe same act of Congress be constitutional in one State, and\r\nunconstitutional in another? South Carolina declares the Tariff\r\nunconstitutional--Kentucky declares it valid; is it nullified or not? is\r\nit void or valid? The South Carolina theory gives to each State, of\r\nitself, the unlimited power to pronounce ultimate judgment against the\r\nvalidity of any act of Congress. If so, the Tariff must be valid in\r\nKentucky, and void in South Carolina. Yet if the Carolina ordinance,\r\nnullifying the Tariff, be valid in that State, it is valid in every\r\nother State, and Carolina may introduce foreign imports, once landed in\r\nher own State, into every other State, free of all duty; for, by the\r\nConstitution, 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from\r\nany State.' What then becomes of the ultimate judgment of Kentucky?\r\nNullified by a single State; and that is the nullification of South\r\nCarolina, by which she can constitutionally, and as a member of the\r\nUnion, repeal any act of Congress she may deem invalid, and prescribe\r\nher will for law throughout the limits of every other State. The\r\nConstitution of the Union would then be this: _Be it enacted_, that the\r\nAmerican Congress shall possess such powers only as South Carolina\r\nbelieves they may lawfully exercise; and the whole American people be\r\nthus subjected to the government of the ordinances of a single State. Is\r\nthis democracy? The truth is, every act of Congress is intrinsically\r\nvoid or valid, from its repugnance to or consonance with the provisions\r\nof the American Constitution; nor can the judgment of a State render\r\nvoid an act of Congress which is constitutional, or render valid an act\r\nof Congress which is unconstitutional. Would the judgment of a single\r\nState have rendered the alien and sedition law constitutional, or the\r\nlast war unconstitutional, or would the Supreme Court of the Union have\r\nbeen compelled to render opposite judgment in a case brought before\r\nthem, declaring the citizen of Massachusetts bound to oppose, and of\r\nVirginia to support either of these laws, as their respective States had\r\npronounced contradictory judgments upon them? Suppose Massachusetts had\r\nnot only declared the last war unconstitutional, but had passed an\r\nordinance requiring her citizens to resist the war, to prostrate and\r\noppose the armies of the Republic, and to aid a tyrant's myrmidons in\r\ndriving the steel deeper into the bosoms of our bleeding countrymen;\r\nwould the ordinance be constitutional, or would not the acts it required\r\nto be performed be treason against the Government of the Union?\r\n\r\nIt is said a State cannot commit treason; no, but its citizens may; nor\r\nwould they be rightfully acquitted because sustained by the judgment of\r\na single State. If each State possesses an equal right to pass ultimate\r\njudgment upon any act of Congress, and two States enact ordinances\r\ndirectly contradictory to the same law, do they not, like the meeting of\r\nequal forces in mechanics, nullify each other? or must the same law be\r\nenforced in one State and disregarded in the other? Not without\r\nviolating the Constitution; for if New York pronounces the Tariff valid,\r\nand South Carolina declares it void, and suits are instituted in each\r\nState on bonds given for the payment of duties on imports introduced\r\ninto each, must the duties be collected in one State, but not in the\r\nother? This would be to set at open defiance those clauses of the\r\nConstitution which declare that all imposts 'shall be uniform throughout\r\nthe United States,' and that 'no preference shall exist in the\r\ncollection of revenue in the ports of one State over those of another.'\r\nUpon an appeal from the decisions by the Federal district courts of New\r\nYork and Carolina, in the suits on the bonds for these duties, how would\r\nthe Supreme Court of the Union decide the question? by enforcing the\r\npayment of the bonds given in Carolina? No; for that State had exercised\r\nthe right of ultimate judgment, and pronounced the law invalid; would\r\nthe court decide against the validity of the bond given in New York? No;\r\nfor that State, in exercising its equal right of pronouncing ultimate\r\njudgment, had declared that the law was valid. Or would they enforce the\r\npayments of the duties in New York and not in South Carolina? This, we\r\nhave seen, would violate both the clauses of the Constitution last\r\nquoted. The only remaining judgment would be, to disregard the edict of\r\na single State, and to enforce the payment of the duties in both States,\r\nor in neither, as the act of Congress might or might not be repugnant to\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution. If Kentucky and Virginia thought\r\nthey possessed the power in regard to the alien and sedition laws now\r\nclaimed by Carolina in regard to the Tariff, where is the ordinance\r\nnullifying those laws? Or would they be nullified by resolutions\r\nexpressing only the judgment and opinion of the Legislature in regard to\r\nthe constitutionality of the law, as if the Legislature, one department\r\nonly of the Government of a single State, could annul all the laws of\r\nthe Union? Even South Carolina does not urge a doctrine so monstrous,\r\nfor she declares this can be done solely by the 'delegates' of the State\r\nin 'solemn convention.' South Carolina finds, then, in the practice of\r\nVirginia and Kentucky, no warrant for the doctrine of nullification. She\r\nfinds neither ordinance, nor test oaths, nor standing armies, nor packed\r\njuries, nor secession, or threats of secession, from the Union. They\r\nfind Mr. Jefferson in that great emergency protesting against 'a\r\nscission of the Union,' in any event; and the ordinance of South\r\nCarolina would have received his unqualified abhorrence. But, if we are\r\nasked to surrender the principles which alone can preserve the Union, on\r\nthe assumed authority of Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison, of Kentucky and\r\nof Virginia--why do not the advocates of nullification tell us that Mr.\r\nJefferson, in 1821, as appears by his printed memoirs, emphatically\r\ndenied the right of a State to _veto_ an act of Congress; and Mr.\r\nMadison, a surviving founder of the Constitution, and framer of the\r\nVirginia resolutions, unequivocally denounces the doctrine of\r\nnullification? And are they not safer guides than Messrs. McDuffie,\r\nCalhoun, and Hamilton, the former of whom wrote and published in 1821,\r\nand the latter deliberately sanctioned, in a laudatory preface, a series\r\nof essays, denouncing this very doctrine of nullification as the\r\n'_climax_ of political heresies'? Why do not those who would look to\r\nKentucky and Virginia as the only safe expositors of the Constitution\r\ninform us also, that the great and patriotic commonwealth of Kentucky is\r\nindignantly repelling the charge that nullification ever was sustained\r\nby her authority? Why do they not point to the unanimous resolution of\r\nthe Virginia Legislature in 1810, declaring in the very case of a\r\nnullification, by a law of Pennsylvania, of a power of the General\r\nGovernment, that the Supreme Court of the Union is the tribunal,\r\n'already provided by the Constitution of the United States, to decide\r\ndisputes between the State and Federal' authorities?' (See 'Sup. Rev.\r\nCode of Virginia,' page 150.) These resolutions, directly affirming the\r\nsupremacy of the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Union over the\r\nlaws and judgment of a State, were adopted by Virginia within a few\r\nmonths after the promulgation by that tribunal of its decree enforcing\r\nthe authority of the Union against the nullifying edict of a sovereign\r\nState. Virginia did more: she not only affirmed the power of this\r\ntribunal, and sanctioned its decree, but spoke of it in terms of the\r\nhighest eulogy, and scouted indignantly the proposition of Pennsylvania\r\nto vest the right of deciding questions of disputed power and\r\nsovereignty in some other tribunal than the Supreme Court of the Union.\r\nThe same proposition was treated with the open or silent contempt of\r\nevery State in the Union, South Carolina among the number; and\r\nPennsylvania receded, though she had passed a law commanding the\r\nGovernor of the State to prevent by an armed force the execution of the\r\nprocess emanating under the authority of the Constitution of the\r\nUnion--though she placed her act upon the same ground as Carolina, that\r\nthe power exercised in that case had never been granted by the\r\nConstitution to any department of the General Government. Thus ended\r\nnullification in the keystone of the arch of the Union. That State,\r\nwhich has ever sustained the Democracy of the South, in the election of\r\nJefferson, of Madison, and Monroe, and the cheering voice of whose\r\npublic meetings first called out as a candidate for the presidency the\r\npatriot Chief Magistrate who now upholds the banner of the Union,\r\nsubmitted to the law of the Union. And is nullification constitutional\r\nin Carolina, but unconstitutional in Pennsylvania? Is the one a\r\n_sovereign_ and the other a _subject_ State? Shall the one submit to the\r\nlaws of the Union, and not the other? Why, sir, if the people of\r\nPennsylvania could sustain a distinction so odious, the very shades of\r\ntheir ancestors would rise from the battlefields of the Revolution, from\r\nPaoli and Germantown, and call their children bondmen of Carolina,\r\nvassals and recreant slaves! I speak not now of the whiskey\r\ninsurrection, when, at the order of Washington, the militia of Virginia\r\nand of other States moved against the people of Western Pennsylvania,\r\nunder the command of the Governor of Virginia and Carolina, and the\r\nnation approved the deed; but I speak of the period, during the\r\npresidency of Mr. Jefferson, when the State of Pennsylvania passed a law\r\nnullifying the powers of the General Government, under her reserved\r\nright to construe the Constitution at her pleasure, when she was\r\ncompelled to yield to the laws of the Union, and her armed force,\r\nassembled by her Governor under an edict of the State, was ineffectual.\r\nNullification was condemned by Jefferson and Madison, by Virginia and\r\nCarolina, and the people of the Union; and must one State nullify and\r\nnot another? No, sir; all or none of the States must submit to the\r\nsupremacy of the Government of the Union; and if Carolina can\r\nsuccessfully resist that Government, will any other State submit to a\r\npower which is thus insulted, disgraced, defied, and overthrown by the\r\nedict of a single State, and which acts and exists only by its\r\npermission? No, sir; one successful example of practical nullification\r\nby a State destroys the Union; for it demonstrates that the Government\r\nof the Union has no power to execute its laws, or preserve its\r\nexistence--_that it is not a government_, or that its powers are written\r\nin sand, to be swept away by the first angry surge of passion that beats\r\nover them. Such was the prediction of the despots of Europe, too soon to\r\nbe fulfilled if the fatal ordinance of Carolina is sustained, and the\r\nflag of the Union struck down by the imperious mandate of a single\r\nState. Let us, then, now teach those despots, who, pointing with\r\nexultation to our dissensions, and anticipating our downfall, proclaim\r\nthat man is incapable of self-government, that the Union can and shall\r\nbe preserved, that we know that 'Union and Liberty are inseparable,'\r\nthat the name and privileges of American citizens are entwined with the\r\nvery ligaments of our hearts, that they are our birthright, the glorious\r\ninheritance purchased by the blood of our forefathers, and never to be\r\nsurrendered by their sons; that we will all rally round the banner of\r\nour country and sustain it, upon the ocean, on the land, in war and in\r\npeace, against foreign or domestic enemies; or, if it must fall, it will\r\nbe upon the graves of Americans preferring death in its defence to life\r\nwithout it, when the iron chains of despotism would bind them as slaves\r\nto that soil which they would tread only as freemen.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Government of the Union is but a league formed by\r\nsovereign States. Did the States form it as governments? if so, which or\r\nall of the departments of any State subscribed or ratified the compact?\r\nor could the government of any State change the organic law, unless by a\r\npower given them by the Constitution, or surrender the sovereign\r\nattributes of power, and unite the people in a new government with other\r\nconfederates? No; the government cannot abolish or change its form or\r\ntransfer its powers to another government: this highest act of\r\nsovereignty can only be performed by the people of a State; and it was\r\nby the people of every State, acting in convention as separate and\r\ndistinct communities, that the Constitution was ratified and rendered\r\nbinding upon the people of all the States; and, in the language of Mr.\r\nJefferson, the Government thus formed was 'authorized to act immediately\r\non the people and by its own officers.' Was it then a league only? No,\r\nit was what its framers, the people, as we have seen, and not the\r\ngovernments of all the States, called it, a 'Constitution'--a\r\n'Government;' and it is an overthrow of fundamental principles to say\r\nthat a 'constitution,' a 'government,' which is made 'the supreme law'\r\nin all the States, could be created by any power less than the people of\r\nthe several States, but as the people of the States, and not in their\r\naggregate capacity. Whatever may be the theories of the advocates of\r\nconsolidation on the one hand, or nullification on the other, this is\r\ncertainly a true history of the manner in which the Government of the\r\nUnion was formed. The Constitution itself expressly declares that it\r\ncould be created only by 'the ratifications of the conventions of the\r\nStates;' and this Constitution was expressly rendered 'the supreme law\r\nof the land,' 'anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding,'--as if the government of a State could render\r\ntheir own constitution subordinate to another constitution. A return\r\nthen having taken place, in forming the Constitution, to the people of\r\nall the States, as the primary fountain of power, they might have vested\r\nall their sovereignty, or but a part of it, in one government; and they\r\nmight have given, in either event, the same power which exists in\r\nordinary governments of enforcing its laws when sustained as\r\nconstitutional by all its departments, subject only to the natural\r\nrights of the people to revolutionize the government in case of\r\nintolerable oppression. Certain important powers and attributes of\r\nsovereignty the people of the States gave to this new government. They\r\nmade this government 'supreme' in the exercise of its powers in all the\r\nStates. They gave this government the sole power 'to declare war.' Did\r\nthe State then remain an absolute sovereign in that respect, and with\r\nabsolute power to judge if the object of the war was constitutional, and\r\nannul the declaration? This new government had the sole power to lay and\r\n_collect_ 'duties on imports;' did each State remain an absolute\r\nsovereignty in this respect, and with absolute powers to judge if the\r\nobject of the duties was constitutional, and annul the law? The General\r\nGovernment was the only sovereign as regards these powers; but a single\r\nState, having none of these powers, is made the absolute judge whether\r\nthey can or cannot be exercised: then no powers have yet been granted to\r\nthe General Government by any State, if each possesses the right to\r\ninterdict the exercise of any of these powers. But, could this General\r\nGovernment exist without the authority to give one uniform effect to the\r\nexecution of its powers in all the States? Created with all the organs\r\nof a government, legislative, judicial, and executive, may it enact, but\r\nnot expound, or enact and expound, but not execute? Must it stop at the\r\nboundary of each State, and ask what power it possesses, and act upon\r\nthe contradictory responses of each State? Must it possess one set of\r\npowers in one State, and another and wholly opposite set of powers in\r\nanother State? May it lay a tariff in one State, and not in another, and\r\nyet this tariff required to be uniform in every State? Is it one\r\nconstitution, and susceptible of one only true construction, or\r\ntwenty-four constitutions, with twenty-four various and contradictory\r\nconstructions, and all right, because all pronounced by absolute\r\nsovereigns exercising the uncontrolled power of ultimate judgment? Has\r\nit any powers, and what are they? Will Mississippi submit this question\r\nto Massachusetts or Carolina, or is a government created whose powers\r\ncannot be ascertained? Must anarchy govern? Can there be no decision, or\r\nis that of a single State, or of a small minority of the States, to\r\nsweep away the legislation of a majority, or two thirds of the States?\r\nAccording to the new theory, each State has the constitutional power in\r\nthe first instance, and one fourth in the last resort, to judge what\r\npowers each State may exercise, and the other States must submit. Now,\r\nthis is impossible, where the legislation of the two States is\r\ncontradictory; and, if possible, is not a mere negative, but a positive\r\npower. It is a government without limitation of power, in a single\r\nState, aided by one fourth of the States--a government by which the\r\nminority may control the majority in all cases whatsoever. Thus,\r\nCarolina frames any law or ordinance she thinks she may lawfully do in\r\nthe exercise of her reserved rights. She gives clearances for vessels,\r\nfor instance, to introduce all imports free of all duties. When once\r\nintroduced into Carolina, she has, or claims and exercises the right\r\nunder the Constitution of introducing these imports free of all duties\r\ninto every other State in the Union. Two thirds of the States have\r\npassed an act of Congress imposing certain duties on foreign imports: as\r\nseparate States they can pass no such laws, having surrendered that\r\npower in the Constitution of the Union. Can Carolina compel them to\r\nreceive all foreign imports free of all duties? Yet she says this is one\r\nof her reserved rights, and she may forever constitutionally exercise\r\nit, in defiance of an act of Congress passed by two thirds of the\r\nStates. Such a government would be an oligarchy of the most odious and\r\ndetestable character. The right of the people of any State, or of any\r\nportion of them, to meet intolerable oppression by revolution is\r\ncertain; but, in Mr. Jefferson's rough draught of the Kentucky\r\nresolutions (now attempted to be substituted for his deliberate\r\nconclusions as contained in the resolutions themselves), does he\r\nadvocate nullification by a single State as a _constitutional_ remedy,\r\nby a State remaining in the Union and submitting only to such laws as it\r\ndeemed valid. No; it was not as a _constitutional_, but as a 'NATURAL\r\nright,' that Mr. Jefferson spoke of nullification by the people of a\r\nState. I say the people, for Mr. Jefferson well knew that the '_natural_\r\nright' of a State to nullify, as an artificial body politic, would be a\r\ncontradiction in terms. This '_natural_ right' is a _personal_, as\r\ncontradistinguished from a _State_ right; it is inalienable--it is\r\nneither given nor reserved by constitutional compacts--it exists in\r\ncitizens of every State, the minority as well as the majority, and not\r\nin the government of any one State. But the exercise of this right is\r\n_revolution_--it is a declaration of independence--it is _war_, and\r\nappeals to the sword as its umpire. Let no State, then, claim to stand\r\non the basis of the Constitution of the Union, while stripping it of its\r\nvital powers, or setting up its will for law. No, the ordinance of\r\nCarolina is not a peaceful, constitutional remedy: it is a nullification\r\nof the Government itself, sweeping away its revenues, its courts, and\r\nits officers; it is a repeal of the Union; it is despotic; it is\r\nrevolutionary; it is belligerent; it is a declaration of war or separate\r\nindependence. It looks beyond a repeal of the Tariff; for, whether the\r\nTariff be repealed or not, it asks to engraft the doctrine of\r\nnullification as a permanent feature of the Constitution, applicable in\r\nevery case in which any State may deem any act of Congress\r\nunconstitutional. Then each one of the States may take up the volumes\r\ncontaining all the acts of Congress, and repeal them all by one sweeping\r\nedict of nullification; for there is no limitation to the exercise of\r\nthe power but her own will. It is said no State will abuse the power;\r\nbut if a majority of the States, by their representatives in Congress,\r\nmay abuse delegated powers, is there no danger that one of these same\r\nStates, by their representatives at home, may mistake the nature of\r\ntheir powers, and endanger the Union by a usurpation of power? Or do the\r\nsame people, and voting at the same period in any State, elect men to\r\nCongress who will violate, and to the councils of the State, who will\r\nuniformly preserve the Constitution? A State declared the last war\r\nunconstitutional: must the war be nullified, or, by the new theory,\r\nsuspended, till, by a slow and tedious process, its constitutionality be\r\naffirmed by three fourths of the States? But, in the mean time, all\r\nhostile operations must cease, our army be disbanded, our navy recalled,\r\nand no further supplies decreed of money, ammunition, or men. And when\r\none State thus nullifies any act of Congress, she is not required to be\r\nsustained by the vote of any other State: the one fourth are only\r\nrequired to refuse to act--to remain neutral--if they consider the act\r\nof Congress inexpedient, although they believe it constitutional.\r\nSuppose the New-England States, after the war was pronounced\r\nunconstitutional by a single State, had refused to call a convention to\r\namend the Constitution, or, if called, to grant the disputed power; then\r\nthe war must have been abandoned, the minority must govern, and our\r\ncountry be disgraced, our seamen permitted to be pressed from the very\r\ndecks of our vessels into foreign service, and the maritime despotism of\r\nBritain established without even a struggle in defence of our liberties.\r\nShall opposition to the Tariff betray us into the support of doctrines\r\nso utterly subversive of the Constitution, and inconsistent with the\r\nexistence of any government of the Union?\r\n\r\nOnce this power was threatened to be assumed by Massachusetts, now by\r\nSouth Carolina, and how and by what State it will next be exercised, or\r\nwhat vital power it may next strike from the Constitution, it is\r\nimpossible to predict; but, if permitted in one State, it will be\r\nexercised by all, till not a vestige remains of the Constitution of the\r\nUnion. Suppose the Tariff repealed by Congress, nullification may annul\r\nthe repealing law. Louisiana may, in the exercise of her right of\r\nultimate judgment, declare that the repealing law is unconstitutional,\r\nupon the pretext that it destroys rights vested by the first law and\r\nviolates the plighted faith of the Government, insist on the collection\r\nof duties under the first law, pass her ordinance, array her State\r\nofficers against those of the Union, and thus destroy the commerce of\r\nMississippi, and of all the Western States, or compel the collection of\r\nthe present duties. Or she may say that, if Congress possesses no power\r\nto lay duties which will operate an incidental protection, Louisiana\r\npossesses the reserved right of imposing duties for that purpose; that\r\neach State possessed it before it became a member of the Union; that\r\nduties for revenue only can be collected by the General Government, and\r\nthat the residuary power to lay duties for protection is one of the\r\npowers of a sovereign State; that she will exercise it, and impose\r\nprotecting duties on imports, and thus we shall have various and\r\nconflicting State tariffs from Maine to Louisiana (the very object which\r\nthe Constitution was designed to prevent); but if Louisiana alone adopt\r\nthe measure, the commerce of the West is prostrate at her feet.\r\n\r\nIt is in the name of liberty and to protect minorities, that\r\nnullification professes to act; while in its first ordinance it sweeps\r\naway the dearest rights of a large minority of the people of Carolina,\r\nand binds the freedom of conscience in adamantine chains. It deprives\r\nAmerican citizens of that last and hitherto sacred refuge from\r\noppression, a trial by an impartial jury, and requires the very judges\r\nupon the bench and jurors within the box to be sworn to condemn the\r\nunhappy man whose only crime was this: that he claimed the Government of\r\nthe Union as his birthright, and acknowledged the duty of obedience to\r\nits laws. Such are the opening scenes of nullification; and, if not\r\narrested, where or how will the drama close? In all the horrors of civil\r\nwar. Turn your eyes upon the scenes of the French Revolution, and behold\r\nthem about to be reacted within the limits of a sister State. Already\r\nnullification calls upon its twelve thousand bayonets; friend is rising\r\nagainst friend, and brother against brother, under the banner of\r\nCarolina on the one side, of the Union on the other; the inflammable\r\nmaterials are ready, the spark approaches, the explosion may soon take\r\nplace, and the genius of liberty, rising in anguish from the\r\nbloodstained fields of Carolina, spread her pinions, and wing her way\r\nforever from a world, on one side of whose waters despotism reigns\r\ntriumphant, and, upon the other, anarchy, with one foot upon the scroll\r\nof the Declaration of American Independence, and with the other upon the\r\nbroken tablet of the Constitution of the Union, shall wave that sceptre,\r\nwhereon shall be inscribed the motto, never to be effaced: 'Man is\r\nincapable of self-government.' Yes, this is the best, the brightest, the\r\nlast experiment of self-government: universal _freedom_ or universal\r\n_bondage_ is staked on the result of the success or failure of the\r\nAmerican Union; and as it shall be maintained and perpetuated, or broken\r\nand dissolved, the light of liberty shall beam upon the hopes of\r\nmankind, or be forever extinguished, amid the scoffs of exulting tyrants\r\nand the groans of a world in bondage. Rising, then, above all minor\r\nconsiderations, and lifting our souls to the contemplation of that lofty\r\neminence on which Heaven itself has vouchsafed to place the American\r\npeople, as the only guardians of the hopes and liberties of mankind, let\r\nus act as becomes the depositaries of that sacred fire which burns on\r\nthe altars of the American Union, and resolve that this Union shall be\r\npreserved, all whole and inviolate, as we received it from the hands of\r\nour forefathers.\r\n\r\nBut, if nullification is not a constitutional remedy, we are told that\r\n_secession_ is; and a few, who deny the one, admit the other; and our\r\nvenerable chief magistrate (Jackson) has been proclaimed as a\r\nFederalist, because he denies the right of secession; and many of his\r\nsupporters, although some may not concur in every argument by which he\r\narrives at his conclusions, but concur in the conclusions themselves,\r\nare visited with a similar denunciation. Sir, the President is one of\r\nthe fathers and founders of the Democratic party--one of its earliest\r\nand most steadfast supporters, in defeat and triumph, in war and in\r\npeace, in sunshine and in storm. In the Senate of the United States he\r\nvoted against the alien law, and was a zealous advocate of the\r\nprinciples which resulted in the election of Mr. Jefferson, and the\r\ngreat political revolution of 1800; and if any one man has done more to\r\nsupport all the just rights of the States than General Jackson, that man\r\nis not known to me. It is now nearly ten years since I had the honor to\r\npropose the name of this illustrious patriot to the first meeting of a\r\nportion of the Democracy of Pennsylvania as a candidate for the\r\npresidency, and I will not hear him denounced as a Federalist without,\r\nat least, an effort in his defence. Who made the right of secession as a\r\nconstitutional right of every State an article in the creed of the\r\nDemocratic party, and by what authority? By what reasoning is\r\nnullification denounced, and secession supported, as a constitutional\r\nremedy? If there be any real difference, the former is check, and the\r\nlatter a check-mate, to the movements of the Government of the Union.\r\nThe same reasoning demonstrates the fallacy of nullification or\r\nsecession, with equal clearness and certainty. A State cannot nullify a\r\nlaw of the Union, because the _Constitution_ and _laws_ of the State are\r\nmade _subordinate_ to the Constitution and laws of the Union, by a\r\ncompact to which the people of each State were one party, and bound\r\nthemselves to the people of all the other States, as the other party.\r\nOne State cannot change the compact, or any of its terms or provisions,\r\nyet it may rescind the compact at pleasure! It would be abuse of\r\nlanguage to call such an instrument a _compact_, because it would be\r\nobligatory upon none. Without the constitutional right to nullify a law\r\nof Congress by the ultimate judgment of the State against it, how could\r\nthe constitutional power of secession arise? It is said, from a\r\nviolation of the Constitution of the Union by the General Government;\r\nbut if a State has not, as the opponents of nullification admit, any\r\nright to pass ultimate judgment on the constitutionality of an act of\r\nCongress, how can it make the supposed violation of the Constitution by\r\nthe General Government the basis of the act of secession? The preamble\r\nof the ordinance on which the State would rest its act of secession, by\r\nasserting the unconstitutionality of an act of Congress, would be swept\r\naway by the non-existence of a power in a single State to pronounce\r\nultimate judgment upon the acts of the Government of the Union; and the\r\npreamble and ordinance of secession would fall together. Thus, when\r\nCarolina, in her ordinance, first declares certain acts of Congress\r\nunconstitutional, and proceeds, with the same ordinance, to\r\nnullification first, and then to secession, we deny her constitutional\r\nright to nullify or secede for the same reason; because the right\r\ndeclared by her ordinance to render an act of Congress unconstitutional\r\nby the judgment of a single State is a usurpation of power. Governor\r\nHayne, of Carolina, in his late proclamation, inquires if that State was\r\nlinked to the Union 'in the iron bonds of a perpetual Union.' These\r\nbonds were not of iron, or Carolina would have never worn them, but they\r\nare the enduring chain of peace and Union. One link could not be severed\r\nfrom this chain, united in all its parts, without an entire dissolution\r\nof all the bonds of union; and one State cannot dissolve the union among\r\nall the States. Yet Carolina admits this to be the inevitable\r\nconsequence of the separation of that State; for, in the address of her\r\nconvention, she declares that 'the separation of South Carolina would\r\ninevitably produce a _general dissolution of the Union_.' Has the\r\nGovernment of the Union no power to _preserve itself from destruction_,\r\nor must we submit to a 'general dissolution of the Union' whenever any\r\none State thinks proper to issue the despotic mandate? It was the\r\ndeclared object of our ancestors, the hope of their children, that they\r\nhad formed 'a PERPETUAL Union.' The original compact of Carolina with\r\nher sister States, by which the confederacy was erected, is called\r\n'Articles of Confederation and _perpetual_ Union.' In the thirteenth\r\narticle of this confederacy, it is expressly declared that 'the Union\r\nshall be _perpetual_;' and in the ratification of this compact, South\r\nCarolina united with her sister States in declaring: 'And we do further\r\nsolemnly plight and engage the faith of our respective constituents'\r\nthat 'the Union _shall be perpetual_;' and may she now withdraw this\r\npledge without a violation of the compact? By the old confederacy, then,\r\nthe Union was _perpetual_; and the declared object of the Constitution\r\nwas to form 'a more perfect Union' than that existing under the former\r\nconfederacy. Now, would this Union be more perfect under the new than\r\nthe old confederacy, if by the latter the Union was perpetual, but,\r\nunder the former, limited in its duration at the will of a single State?\r\n\r\nThe advocates of secession claim the constitutional power for each State\r\nto annul, not only any law which the State may deem unconstitutional,\r\nbut to abolish the Constitution itself as the law of the State. Now, by\r\nthis Constitution, Carolina granted certain powers to the General\r\nGovernment: may she constitutionally alter or revoke the grant, in a\r\nmanner repugnant to the provisions of that Constitution? That instrument\r\npoints out the mode in which it may be changed or abrogated, and by\r\nwhich the several States may assume all or any of the powers granted to\r\nthe General Government, namely, by the conjoint action of three fourths\r\nof the States. What, then, are the powers reserved to the State? The\r\nninth article of the Constitution of the Union declares that 'the powers\r\nnot delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited\r\nby it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the\r\npeople.' Then the powers delegated to the United States were not\r\nreserved to the States or to the people. What is the meaning of the\r\nclause 'or to the people,' as contradistinguished from 'the States'?\r\nDoes it mean that any of this mass of undefined powers, but embracing\r\nall not granted to the General Government, was reserved to the people of\r\nthe United States in the aggregate? Then there would exist, and does now\r\nexist, a consolidated despotism. No, it was to the _people_ of each\r\nState the reservation was made. Then it follows, as a necessary\r\nconsequence, that none of the powers granted to the General Government\r\nwere reserved either to the States or the people of any State. That is,\r\nso far as the people of any one State had granted, by their own separate\r\nconstitution, to the State government any powers not delegated to the\r\nGeneral Government, the government of the State might exercise these\r\npowers, and so far as any of these undelegated powers were not granted\r\nto the State government, by the people of the State, they were reserved\r\nto the people of each State. Now, one of the powers reserved to the\r\npeople of each State is to change their form of State government, and\r\nresume the powers granted by it. But we have seen that neither the\r\ngovernment or people of a State could resume 'the powers delegated to\r\nthe United States,' because it was not one of the rights reserved to\r\neither. What! I am asked, cannot the people of a State abolish their\r\nform of government? Yes, in two modes: one in accordance with the\r\nConstitution, and the other by a revolution. Could the people of\r\nCarolina or Mississippi change or abolish their State constitution,\r\nexcept in the mode prescribed by that instrument, unless by a\r\nrevolution? And the same power, the people of Carolina, that formed for\r\nthem their State constitution, ratified and rendered obligatory upon\r\nthem the Constitution of the Union; and can the one and not the other be\r\nabolished, except by a revolution, in any other mode than that\r\nprescribed by the Constitution? No; the people of Carolina, and of all\r\nthe States, as distinct communities, in ratifying the Constitution of\r\nthe Union, rendered it binding upon the people of every State, by the\r\ndeclaration that 'this Constitution shall be the supreme law of the\r\nland, and that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\r\nanything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.' Here we see the distinction between the State and the\r\npeople of the State again recognized and confirmed, and the 'State,' by\r\nits 'laws,' and the people of the State, by the formation of a\r\nconstitution, expressly prohibited from arresting the operation of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, as 'the supreme law of the land,' 'in\r\nevery State.' If Carolina secede, she must form a constitution, by which\r\nshe will assume the powers granted to the General Government, and vest\r\nthem in the government of the State. Here she would be met by the former\r\nact of the people of Carolina, declaring that they had abandoned the\r\npower to form for themselves a constitution by which the Constitution of\r\nthe Union would cease within their limits to be 'the supreme law of the\r\nland.' Nor did the framers of the Constitution mean to say only that the\r\nthen existing Constitutions of the States ratifying the compact should\r\nbe subordinate to the Constitution of the Union; for then, also, only\r\nthe existing laws of any State were required to be subordinate to the\r\nConstitution of the Union; but both are placed on the same basis. The\r\npower of a State to nullify by its laws, or secede by forming a new\r\nconstitution, are both denied in the same clause and sentence of the\r\nAmerican Constitution. The language is clear, that the Constitution of\r\nthe Union shall be 'the supreme law of the land,' and 'binding in every\r\nState,' 'anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.' The terms are '_shall be_;' it is the\r\nlanguage of command, it is prospective, it was binding when subscribed,\r\nnow, and forever. Or, was Carolina never bound by this compact, and\r\nmight she, the very day after it was ratified by her people, disregard\r\nit altogether, secede, and establish a constitution directly repugnant\r\nto the Constitution of the Union? If so, written constitutions are worse\r\nthan useless; they are not obligatory, there is no penalty for their\r\nviolation; obedience to them cannot be enforced; there is no government\r\nbut that of opinion, fluctuating and uncertain, undefined and\r\nundefinable, which is paramount to the fundamental law. This is what the\r\n_despots of Europe_ call our government, and why they _predict_ its\r\ndownfall--a prediction now in the course of fulfilment, if these\r\nanarchical principles can be recognized as the doctrines of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference between the doctrines or acts of Jefferson and\r\nJackson on this subject. Both admit nullification or secession as a\r\nrevolutionary measure; and the new doctrine of suspending a law by a\r\nnullifying edict finds not the remotest support from Mr. Jefferson. In\r\nhis celebrated draught of the Kentucky resolutions, so much relied on by\r\nCarolina, we have seen, he speaks of these powers of the people of any\r\nState as 'a _natural_ right,' and so is revolution; and the cases to\r\nwhich he refers are such as render a revolution unavoidable, namely, if\r\nCongress pass an act 'so palpably against the Constitution as to amount\r\nto an undisguised declaration that the compact is not meant to be the\r\nmeasure of the powers of the General Government.' Is there now such a\r\ncase? if there is, revolution is justifiable. Why then ask any other\r\nremedy than revolution for a case where revolution would be unavoidable?\r\nAnd SECESSION IS REVOLUTION. But did Mr. Jefferson mean to say that\r\nwhenever any State should place its laws or Constitution, by\r\nnullification or secession, in opposition to the laws of the General\r\nGovernment, that the power of the General Government must not be\r\nexerted? The very reverse. The act of Congress of the 3d of March,\r\n1807, signed and approved by Mr. Jefferson as President, expressly\r\nauthorizes the President of the United States to 'employ such part of\r\nthe land and naval force of the United States as may be necessary' to\r\nexecute 'the laws of the United States.' Does this mean, as General\r\nHayne tells us in his proclamation, to execute the laws against\r\ninsurgents not sustained by any law of the State? No; this act was\r\npassed at the very time when Pennsylvania was proceeding, by virtue of a\r\nlaw of the State, to execute, by an armed force, the mandate of the\r\nState in opposition to the mandate of the Federal authorities; and the\r\nofficer of Pennsylvania, acting under the mandate of the Governor and a\r\npositive law of the State, was condemned for executing a law of the\r\nState opposed to the mandate of the General Government, and only escaped\r\npunishment by the pardon of President Madison: and thus falls the very\r\nbasis of the doctrine of nullification. Here is a commentary by Messrs.\r\nJefferson and Madison, demonstrating their entire concurrence with our\r\npresent Chief Magistrate. And, if any further evidence of Mr.\r\nJefferson's views were wanting, it is to be found in his letters,\r\nalready referred to, protesting against a separation of the Union, and\r\ndenying the right of a State to '_veto_' an act of Congress; and in many\r\nother letters to be found in his memoirs, insisting upon the power even\r\nof the old confederacy to exercise 'COERCION over its delinquent\r\nmembers,' the States. 'Compulsion,' he says, 'was never so easy as in\r\nour case, where a single frigate would levy on the commerce of a State\r\nthe deficiency of its contributions; nor more safe than in the hands of\r\n_Congress_, which has _always_ shown that it would wait, as it ought to\r\ndo, to the last extremities, before it would exercise any of its powers\r\nwhich are disagreeable.' Here, then, we find Mr. Jefferson most\r\ndistinctly admitting the power of Congress under the old, as in 1807 he\r\nadmitted under the present confederacy, to _compel a State_ by FORCE to\r\nobey the laws of the Union. Why, then, is General Jackson denounced as a\r\ntyrant, for doing that which his oath and the Constitution compel him to\r\ndo? Suppose any State, by its ordinance, should arrest the passage of\r\nthe mail through their limits, upon the pretext that the law was\r\nunconstitutional; the acts of Congress place at the disposal of the\r\nPresident the militia of any one or all of the States, or 'the land or\r\nnaval force of the United States', to _execute the law of the Union in\r\nevery State, by whomsoever resisted or opposed_. The Constitution and\r\nhis oath command him to execute the laws; he must execute them, and the\r\nmail must pass on, though the edict of a single State should attempt to\r\narrest it by nullification or secession. Such, too, was the opinion of\r\nMr. Jefferson; and that illustrious patriot would have laid his head on\r\nthe block, and blessed the hand that severed it from his body, rather\r\nthan sever the Union by the promulgation of the doctrines now ascribed\r\nto him. What are the consequences of this right of a State to secede\r\nfrom the Union?--this right of revolution, without the power of the\r\nGeneral Government to _preserve the Union_? Any one State may arrest,\r\nto-morrow, the mail of the Union, and its passage from State to State,\r\nand refuse it a passage forever. Pennsylvania, a central State, may\r\nseparate the North from the South, prevent all intercommunication,\r\nrender our country a republic divided and indefensible. Louisiana,\r\npurchased by taxes imposed upon the people of all the States, may secede\r\nand establish a separate and independent government, lay protective or\r\nprohibitory imposts on the imports and exports of this State and of the\r\nWest, carried through her ports and the outlets of the Mississippi. She\r\nmight say, I will protect my own cotton planters, by prohibitory duties\r\non the cotton of Mississippi or the West, or the imports designed to be\r\nexchanged for it, shipped through my ports or through the outlet of the\r\nMississippi: it is my interest to do so; for thus I can deprive the\r\ncotton planters of Mississippi and the West of a market; thus compel\r\nthem to abandon the culture of that staple, and sell my own cotton at a\r\nhigher price. Louisiana asserts no such doctrines; but, if she did,\r\ncould Mississippi, could the West admit them? and, in the last resort,\r\nwould not the Government _force_ a passage for our imports and exports\r\nby the _sword_? Yes; for as well might you take the heart from the human\r\nbody and bid it live, as sever Louisiana from the States that border on\r\nthe Mississippi, and bid these States to prosper. No; Louisiana holds\r\nthe outlet of that stream through which the life blood of their commerce\r\nand industry must forever flow; and we never could admit her right to\r\nsecede from the Union, and dictate the terms on which we should use the\r\noutlet of that stream, whose banks were destined by heaven itself as the\r\nresidence of a united people. Not only Louisiana, but State by State\r\nthat borders on the Atlantic or the Gulf, might secede, seclude the West\r\nfrom the ocean, and render them the tributaries of the seaboard States,\r\nby laying prohibitory duties on their imports and exports. Could we\r\nsubmit to this? _Not while the West contained a gun to use, or a man to\r\nshoulder it._\r\n\r\nAnd may Carolina secede and establish an independent government? Did she\r\nestablish her own independence? No, it was achieved by the arms and\r\npurchased by the blood of Americans, with the banner of the Union\r\nfloating over them. I know the valor of Carolina, that, man to man, she\r\nis invincible; but, unaided and alone, she would have fallen in the\r\nRevolution. She would have fallen gloriously, her soil would have drunk\r\nthe blood of her children; but still she must have fallen in the unequal\r\ncontest. When Carolina was made the battlefield of the Revolution, from\r\nthe very rock of Plymouth and the heights of Bunker Hill, from\r\nPennsylvania, from Virginia, American citizens flew to her rescue. Side\r\nby side with Carolina's sons they marched beneath the banner of the\r\nUnion; they fought, they conquered; Carolina was redeemed from bondage,\r\nbut upon her many and well-fought fields was mingled the blood and\r\nrepose the ashes of our common ancestors, the pledges of our Union in\r\nvictory and in death.\r\n\r\nShades of these departed patriots! arise, and say to the sons of\r\nCarolina, it was the Union that made you free. Without it, you would yet\r\nbe subjects, colonial vassals, and slaves; without it, the chains are\r\nnow forging that will bind you to the thrones of despots. And could we\r\nstand with folded arms, and behold the Union dissolved? Could we see the\r\nseventeen thousand freemen of Carolina, who cling with the grasp of\r\ndeath to the banner of the Union, deprived of their privileges as\r\nAmerican citizens, proscribed, disfranchised, expelled from all offices,\r\ncivil and military, driven by glittering bayonets from the bench and the\r\njury box, tried and convicted by judges and jurors sworn to condemn,\r\nattainted as traitors, torn from the last embraces of wives and\r\nchildren, consigned to the scaffold or the block, or immured within the\r\nwalls of a dungeon, where the light of heaven or liberty should never\r\nvisit them, with no consolation but their patriotism, and no companions\r\nbut their chains? And, gracious Heaven, for what? Oh! Liberty, when was\r\nthy sacred temple profaned by deeds like this? Thy martyrs suffered only\r\nfor clinging to the banner of the American Union. And could we see them\r\ntorn from around that sacred banner, and move not to their rescue? No;\r\nthe glow that beams on every countenance, the patriot's answer that\r\nspeaks from every throbbing breast, proclaims that, as in '76 our\r\nfathers marched to free their sires from tyrants' power, so would their\r\nchildren go, to save from death or bondage Carolina's friends of\r\nunion--with them, beneath the standard of our common country, to die or\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nCitizens of Mississippi, to you the address of the nullifying convention\r\nof Carolina makes a special appeal. It asks, if Carolina secedes from\r\nthe Union, 'Can it be believed that Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and\r\neven Kentucky would continue to pay a tribute of fifty per cent. upon\r\ntheir consumption to the Northern States for the privilege of being\r\nunited to them, when they could receive all their supplies through the\r\nports of South Carolina, without paying a single cent for tribute?' To\r\nthis question, Georgia has already answered, by expressing her\r\n'abhorrence' of the doctrine of nullification, her firm resolve to\r\nadhere to the Union. Tennessee has made the same response. Kentucky, in\r\na voice of thunder, answers, _No_, we will preserve the Union as it is.\r\nAnd will Mississippi receive the bribe thus offered to dissolve the\r\nUnion? What is it? The privilege of exchanging our exports for imports\r\nfree of duty, in the ports of Carolina; and then would Carolina pay the\r\ntaxes to raise and maintain an army, or a navy, and protect our\r\ncommerce? But if she could, nature pronounces the project impracticable.\r\nOur commerce must flow through the outlet of the Mississippi; and how\r\nwould our exports reach the ports of Carolina--how would our imports\r\nthence be received? Through the outlet of the Mississippi? No, that\r\noutlet and its ports would then be in the hands of Louisiana--in that\r\nevent, to us a hostile foreign government, from which we had severed\r\nourselves. For let it not be forgotten that Louisiana is not even\r\ninvited to join this new confederacy; and if she were, is announcing her\r\nunalterable determination to adhere to the Union as it is. Then, through\r\nthe outlet of the Mississippi our commerce could not be carried on with\r\nthe ports of Carolina; for Louisiana, as we have seen before, would meet\r\nand stop our exports and imports with prohibitory duties. Would we move\r\nup the Mississippi or Ohio to reach the ports of Carolina, or any other\r\nmarket? There we would find the confederates from whom we had severed;\r\nwe would find a foreign government, and prohibitory duties would exclude\r\nour access to Carolina's ports in that direction. How would we reach\r\nthem? The only other route, if Georgia and Alabama would grant the boon\r\nfor Carolina's benefit, would be to pass through those States by land to\r\nCharleston, with our cotton, and return by land with the imports\r\nreceived in exchange. A trip of one thousand miles by wagon road with\r\ncotton! The entire value of the crop would not pay for its\r\ntransportation. Is this the proposition of Carolina? What is the only\r\ncommerce we could carry on with her? By abandoning the culture of cotton\r\nupon our fertile lands, for the benefit of Carolina, and our planters\r\nall becoming drovers of horses, mules, and cattle, to exchange for her\r\nimports, and return with them, packed on the number unsold of our mules\r\nand horses. And are these the benefits for which we are asked to\r\ndissolve the Union, and place the channel of the Mississippi above and\r\nbelow, and its outlet, in the hands of a foreign government, denying a\r\npassage ascending or descending, to our imports or exports, and\r\nexcluding us from the ocean altogether? If Carolina's scheme were\r\npracticable, Mississippi would not sell the Union for dollars and cents;\r\nbut though the scheme might be beneficial to Carolina, by stopping the\r\nculture of cotton on our fertile soil, to the people of this State it is\r\nruin immediate and inevitable. The remedy Carolina proposes to us for\r\nthe Tariff, is worse than the disease. The disease is not mortal--it is\r\nnow in a course of cure; but Carolina's remedy is death--it is suicide;\r\nfor the _dissolution of the Union is political suicide_.\r\n\r\nA Southern convention is proposed, of the States of North and South\r\nCarolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. If\r\nthe object be a confederacy of these States, without Louisiana and the\r\nWestern, Middle, and Northern States, if patriotism, or love for the\r\nUnion were insufficient to restrain us from attempting this fatal\r\nmeasure, we have seen that it would blast forever the fortunes of the\r\nplanters of Mississippi. But what States will unite in this convention?\r\nGeorgia has disavowed the act of the self-constituted, self-elected\r\nminority convention that acted in her name. The history of Virginia\r\nspeaks in the voice of indignant rebuke to all those States that\r\nassemble sectional conventions. North Carolina, unassuming, but\r\nsteadfast in support of the Union, will enter into no such convention.\r\nAlabama, if her public meetings and journals and her chief magistrate\r\nspeak the voice of the State, will send no delegates. Tennessee, brave\r\nand patriotic, devoted to the Union, and sustaining its banner in war\r\nand in peace, meets the proposition with a decided refusal. I imagine,\r\nthen, our delegates would return without finding this Southern\r\nconvention. I am opposed to all sectional conventions. We have had one\r\nsuch convention, and, whatever the secret motives of its members may\r\nhave been, the very fact that it was a sectional convention, that it was\r\nbelieved to be convened to calculate the value of the Union, that it was\r\nsupposed to have in view an Eastern confederacy, has sealed the doom of\r\nits members and projectors. And when the calm shall follow the storm, a\r\nsimilar fate awaits all who will go into this Southern convention. I\r\ntrust there never will be another partial convention, Northern,\r\nSouthern, Eastern, or Western; for, whether assembled at Hartford or\r\nColumbia, they are equally dangerous to the Union of the States. They\r\ncreate and inflame geographical parties. Could the North, assembled in\r\nconvention, have that full knowledge of the situation and wants of the\r\npeople of the South, as to legislate for them, and propose ultimatums to\r\nwhich the South must submit, or leave the Union? Could the South possess\r\nthat full knowledge of the situation and wants and interests of the\r\npeople of all the other States, as to enable them to dictate the terms\r\non which the Union should be governed or dissolved? No; it is only in a\r\nmeeting of all the States, in Congress or convention, that that\r\nknowledge of the wants and interests of all, and that fusion of\r\nsentiment and opinion, and spirit of concession, can exist, in which the\r\nConstitution was framed, and all its powers should be exercised.\r\n\r\nIf we hold Southern conventions, then will there be Northern, Eastern,\r\nand Western conventions, and they will overthrow the Union. Partial\r\nconfederacies will first be formed, and then, as Mr. Jefferson most\r\ntruly tells us, would speedily follow the formation of a separate and\r\nindependent government by each State. What is it we are asked to\r\nabandon, and for what? That Union which ushered in the morn of American\r\nLiberty, and gave birth to the Declaration of Independence; which\r\ncarried our armies victoriously through the storms of the Revolution and\r\nthe last war, and now waves triumphantly in every sea, the kindred\r\nemblem of our country's glory. It gave us Washington--it gave us\r\nliberty, and bears our name aloft among the nations of the earth. It is\r\nour only rampart in war--our only safeguard in peace, and under its\r\nauspices we declared, achieved, maintained, and can alone preserve our\r\nliberties. It is the only basis of our solid and substantial interests,\r\nand the last star of hope to the oppressed of every clime. Shall we\r\ncalculate its value? No! for we will not estimate the value of\r\nliberty--and 'liberty and union are inseparable.' Dissolve this Union,\r\nand let each State become, as Mr. Jefferson truly tells us it would, a\r\nseparate government, could we preserve our liberties? Where would be the\r\narmy and navy and seamen of the State of Mississippi? how to be\r\nprocured, and how to be maintained and paid? Where would be her\r\nambassadors and treaties, her commerce--and through what ports and by\r\nwhose permission would she ship her exports or introduce her imports?\r\nWho would respect her flag, who recognize her as a nation--and how would\r\nshe punish aggressions upon her rights, on the ocean or the land? No,\r\nfellow citizens; the President truly tells us that 'separate\r\nindependence' is a 'dream'--a dream from which we would wake in bondage\r\nor in death. But, if disgraced abroad, what would be our situation at\r\nhome, as separate bordering and hostile States--and how long could we\r\nremain in peace and concord? The voice of history tells us--the\r\nbloodstained fields of our sister republics of America proclaim, that\r\ndisunion would be the signal for WAR--a war of conquest, in which the\r\nweak would fall before the power of the strong; and upon the ruins of\r\nthis now happy Union might arise the darkest despotism that ever crushed\r\nthe liberties of mankind, for it would be established and could only be\r\nmaintained by the bayonet. Perhaps, while yet the civil war should rage\r\nwith doubtful issue, while exhausted and bleeding at every pore, that\r\nsanguinary alliance of despots, combined to crush the liberties of man,\r\nwould send its armies to our shores. Under what standard would we rally\r\nto preserve our liberty? There would be no Union--without it there would\r\nbe no strength; and those who, united, could defy the world in arms,\r\ndivided would be weak and powerless. Such are the ultimate results of\r\ndisunion. Let us take the first step, and all may be lost forever. That\r\nstep is nullification by Carolina, then her secession--then, as she\r\ntruly tells us in her address, 'the separation of South Carolina would\r\ninevitably produce a general dissolution of the Union.' And shall\r\nCarolina dissolve the Union? No; the liberties of all the States are\r\nembarked together, and if one State withdraw her single plank, the\r\nnational vessel must go down to rise no more, and shipwreck the hopes of\r\nmankind. Let us then adjure the people of Carolina, by the ties of our\r\ncommon country and common kindred--by the ruin and disgrace which civil\r\nwar will bring upon the victors and vanquished--by the untried horrors\r\nof those scenes to which disunion must conduct, to repeal her ordinance,\r\nand not to force upon us that dread alternative, in which we must\r\nsupport the flag of our country, or surrender our Union and liberty\r\nwithout a struggle: that we cannot, we will not, we dare not, surrender\r\nthem; and, if forced to draw the sword to defend our liberties, the\r\nmotto will gleam on every blade: 'The Union shall be preserved.' For\r\nwere it abandoned, life would not be a blessing, but a curse; and\r\nhappiest would those be whose eyes were closed in death ere they beheld\r\nthe horrors of those scenes to which with viewless and rapid strides we\r\nseem to hasten. Well, fellow citizens, may our hearts be wrung with\r\nsorrow on this occasion, in looking back to what we were, and forward to\r\nwhat we may soon be. Well may the tears unbidden start, for they are the\r\ntears that patriots shed over the departing greatness of our once\r\nunited, but now distracted and unhappy country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIOUX WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared with the great storm of rebellion which has darkened and\r\noverspread our whole national sky, the Indian war on our northwestern\r\nfrontier has been a little cloud \"no bigger than a man's hand;\" and yet,\r\ncompared with similar events in our history, it has scarcely a parallel.\r\nFrom the days of King Philip to the time of Black Hawk, there has hardly\r\nbeen an outbreak so treacherous, so sudden, so bitter, and so bloody,\r\nas that which filled the State of Minnesota with sorrow and lamentation,\r\nduring the past summer and autumn, and the closing scenes of which are\r\neven now transpiring. We were beginning to regard the poetry of the\r\npalisades as a thing of the past, when, suddenly, our ears were startled\r\nby the echo of the warwhoop, and the crack of the rifle, and our hearts\r\nappalled by the gleam of the tomahawk and the scalping knife, as they\r\ndescended in indiscriminate and remorseless slaughter, on defenceless\r\nwomen and children on our border.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851, the Sisseton, Wahpeton, M'dewakanton and Wahpekuta\r\nbands of Dacotah or Sioux Indians by treaty ceded to the United States,\r\nin consideration of certain annuities to be paid them, all their lands\r\nwithin the present limits of the States of Iowa and Minnesota, excepting\r\na reservation set apart for their habitation and use, embracing a narrow\r\nstrip along the southern side of the Minnesota River, of about ten miles\r\nin width and one hundred and fifty in length. To this reservation these\r\nfour bands removed their people, numbering some seven thousand souls, of\r\nwhom, perhaps, twelve hundred were warriors. During the eleven years\r\nwhich have elapsed since this treaty was made, they have lived there,\r\nthe State of Minnesota being meanwhile peopled by the whites with\r\nunparalleled rapidity, and the Indians seeing flourishing and populous\r\nsettlements springing up all about them. With but a single interruption,\r\npeace and amity has existed between the two races; missions, schools,\r\nand to some extent, agriculture, have been established among them; and a\r\nlarge number of halfbreeds, springing from marriages between white\r\ntraders and Sioux women, have formed, apparently, a link of\r\nconsanguinity and interest, which, aided by the influence and laws of\r\ncivilization, would hereafter prevent any trouble or bloodshed on the\r\npart of the savages.\r\n\r\nOne single and very grave interruption to these peaceful relations has,\r\nhowever, occurred. In March, 1857, Inkpadutah, a Wahpekuta Dacotah, with\r\na small band of followers, committed a terrible massacre near Spirit\r\nLake, in the northwestern corner of Iowa, slaying fifty persons, and\r\ncarrying away four women into captivity, two of whom were, after some\r\nmonths, ransomed and restored to their friends, the other two having\r\nbeen previously murdered by their captors. But Inkpadutah and his band\r\nwere outlaws, driven away by their own people for creating internal\r\ndissensions; and although the perpetrators were never properly pursued\r\nand punished, it was not thought that the outrage had been countenanced\r\nby the rest of the nation, or that any danger existed of similar acts on\r\ntheir part.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the recent outbreak cannot, perhaps, be absolutely\r\ndetermined; the manner of its beginning is more easily traced. It must\r\nbe understood that, for the purpose of receiving their annuities, the\r\nIndians, at a certain period every summer, come down from their hunting\r\ngrounds to the two Agencies, one at Redwood, near Fort Ridgely, and the\r\nother at Yellow Medicine. It is the custom to keep a certain quantity of\r\nprovisions at these Agencies to feed them during these visits, and also\r\nto sometimes send them supplies during times of great want and scarcity\r\nof game in winter. Unfortunately, they came last year much earlier than\r\ncommon, and before they had received their usual notification from the\r\nAgent, that the annuities were awaiting them. In addition, as if all the\r\naccidents were destined to be adverse, the session of Congress was very\r\nlong, the Appropriation Bill, which included the Indian appropriations,\r\ndid not pass until the day before the adjournment, and the immense\r\npressure of business on the Departments, and the great difficulty of\r\nobtaining coin, all occasioned long and unusual delays. The coin,\r\n$71,000 in silver (Indians understand silver coin, and will scarcely\r\ntake any other), was finally shipped by express from the sub-treasury in\r\nNew York city, on the 12th of August, reached St. Paul on the 16th, and\r\nwas immediately despatched by private conveyance to Yellow Medicine, via\r\nFort Ridgely, at which latter place it arrived on the 18th.\r\n\r\nThe Indians came down to the Agency at Yellow Medicine about the middle\r\nof July, to the number of four thousand, men, women, and children. Here\r\nthey remained in waiting some three weeks. Provisions, in small\r\nquantities, were given to them, but for so large a number of mouths the\r\nrations were scanty. This supply, with the few wild ducks and pigeons\r\nwhich they could shoot from time to time, the little flour they were\r\nable to buy on credit from the trading houses, and the half-grown\r\npotatoes they stole from the fields, enabled them to eke out a scanty\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nAs might be readily imagined, this state of things bred great\r\ndiscontent. On the morning of the 4th of August, a large number of\r\nIndians came over from their encampment, and some on horseback, and some\r\non foot, with guns and hatchets, rushed to the door of the warehouse,\r\ncut it down, and commenced carrying out bags of flour. The few soldiers\r\nwho were stationed at the Agency, were, as well as the Agent and\r\nemployes, taken completely off their guard by this movement; but in a\r\nshort time they recovered themselves; got a field piece loaded and\r\nturned upon the crowd, and sent a squad of soldiers to the warehouse. At\r\nthese preparations, the Indians desisted; but the military force was too\r\nsmall to make more than a formal demonstration. The pile of flour taken\r\nout of the warehouse had not been carried away, and while the soldiers\r\nprevented this being done, the Indians placed a guard to hinder its\r\nbeing recovered by the whites. Thus they stood during the remainder of\r\nthe day, in an attitude of mutual defiance, yet neither party was\r\nwilling to inaugurate hostilities. The next morning, when the Indians\r\nagain as usual flocked down to the Agency, a couple of arrests were\r\npromptly made by the guard. This had the effect of driving them all back\r\nto their camps. Almost immediately afterward they struck their tents,\r\nand removed to a distance of from two to four miles. This was looked\r\nupon at the Agency as a war movement, and all possible defensive\r\npreparations were at once made. Some of the women were sent away, guns\r\nand pistols were loaded, field pieces and troops were placed in\r\nposition, and pickets were thrown out. Everything looked like war. Still\r\nthere had been no actual bloodshed. Through the mediation of Rev. Mr.\r\nRiggs, who had long resided among them as a missionary, peaceful\r\ncounsels finally prevailed with the Indians. Thirty-six of the chiefs\r\nmet the Agent in council, smoked the pipe of peace, acknowledged their\r\noffence, and expressed their sorrow and shame at its occurrence. Three\r\ndays afterward another council was held, in which they agreed to receive\r\ncertain rations, and promised to induce their people to move away until\r\nthe annuity money should arrive. The Agent, on his part, forgave their\r\ntrespass, and promised to send for them as soon as he should be prepared\r\nto make their payment. So confident was he that the arrangement was\r\namicable and satisfactory, that he went soon afterward to St. Paul on\r\nbusiness, leaving his family at the Agency.\r\n\r\nThings remained in this condition until Sunday, the 17th of August,\r\n1862. On that day, four young Indians, belonging to Little Six's band,\r\nwent to the house of Mr. Jones, at Acton, Meeker county, Minnesota. As\r\nthey evinced an unfriendly disposition, Mr. Jones locked his house, and\r\nwith his wife, went to the house of Mr. Howard Baker, a near neighbor,\r\nwhere he was followed by the Indians. They proposed to go out and shoot\r\nat a mark, but after leaving the house, suddenly turned and fired upon\r\nthe party, mortally wounding Mr. and Mrs. Jones, Mr. Baker, and a Mr.\r\nWebster. Mrs. Baker, with a young child, concealed herself in the cellar\r\nand escaped. The Indians then returned to Jones' house, which they broke\r\ninto, killing a young woman who had been left there. This was the first\r\nbloodshed of the war.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there seems to have been no deliberate preparation, no\r\nconcerted arrangement for the outbreak against the whites. There was\r\nexcitement and discontent among the Indians on account of hunger, the\r\ndelay of their payment, and the real or supposed wrongs and frauds\r\ncommitted by white traders and officials; but no organized hostile\r\nmovement had been agreed on. They knew that a great war was in progress\r\nbetween the whites; that armies were being raised, and the country was\r\nbeing drained of men. All this was known and discussed among them. There\r\nare also grave suspicions, and not without considerable show of\r\nevidence, that rebel emissaries, Indians or half breeds from the\r\nMissouri border, had been among them fomenting the discord and urging\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWhen these four young men returned on the 18th to their band, which was\r\nthen with others at the Sioux Agency at Redwood, the recital of their\r\nmurders created the most intense excitement among the Indians. They\r\nbecame infuriated at the idea of bloodshed. Before the whites were aware\r\nthat trouble was brewing, Little Six's, Little Crow's, Grey Iron's, and\r\nGood Road's bands of M'dewakantons, and a part of the Lake Calhoun band,\r\ngathered around the buildings, and, with a general rush and yell,\r\nmassacred the whites, some twenty-five in number, robbed and plundered\r\nthe stores, and laid the whole place in ashes.\r\n\r\nThe party who were conveying the annuity money to the Agency, reached\r\nFort Ridgely on the afternoon of the same day, and there learned that\r\nthe outbreak had taken place. A garrison of about seventy-five men was\r\nin the fort at the time the news of the massacre reached it, and Captain\r\nMarsh, taking fifty of them, proceeded toward the Agency, fifteen miles\r\nup the river. In the evening twenty-one of the men returned, to tell\r\nthat the detachment had fallen into an ambush, and that all the others,\r\nincluding the captain, were either killed or drowned.\r\n\r\nThe Indians seem to have at once despatched messengers with the news of\r\nthese hostilities to the bands at the Upper Sioux Agency, at Yellow\r\nMedicine. The chiefs there immediately called their followers into\r\ncouncil. About one hundred Sissetons, Wahpetons, and thirty young\r\nYanktons, were present. The council was stormy, and divided in\r\nsentiment; the Sissetons urging the killing and robbing of the whites,\r\nsaying the M'dewakantons had already gone so far that they could not\r\nmake matters worse, and that, as the whites would inflict punishment\r\nupon all alike, the best thing to be done was to kill them and take\r\ntheir goods. The Wahpeton chiefs, though willing to rob the whites,\r\ninsisted on sparing their lives, and sending them off with their horses\r\nand wagons across the prairies.\r\n\r\nAbout one fourth of the Sioux, previous to these events, had, through\r\nthe efforts of the Government and missionaries, renounced their savage\r\nlife, and adopted the customs of civilization. They had cut off\r\nthe hair, discarded the blanket, adopted the civilized costume,\r\nand undertaken to live by the cultivation of the earth, instead\r\nof the chase. One of the chiefs who joined in this reform was\r\nAn-pe-tu-to-ke-ca, or Other-Day, an Indian of more than ordinary\r\nintelligence and ability. He had been much among the whites, and was a\r\nconvert to Christianity. Some years previous, while he was at Washington\r\ncity with a delegation of his tribe, a rather good-looking white woman,\r\nwho had lost caste in society, fell in love with him, married him, and\r\nfollowed him to his Indian home in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nOther-Day took part in this deliberation. He arose and addressed the\r\ncouncil, warning them against the consequences of the attack they were\r\nmeditating. They might succeed in killing a few whites, he told them,\r\nbut extermination or expulsion would be their fate if they did. But his\r\npacific arguments produced no effect. Toward evening, the Yanktons,\r\nSissetons, and a few of the Wahpetons rose from the council, and moved\r\ntoward the houses of the whites, to prepare for the attack. All the\r\nafternoon the Indians had been busy taking their guns to the blacksmith\r\nshop to have them repaired, which the unsuspecting smith, being told\r\nthey were going on a buffalo hunt, had done.\r\n\r\nOther-Day now left the council, took his wife and his gun, and went to\r\nwarn the whites of the impending danger. They had, up to this time,\r\nknown nothing whatever of the council. At his suggestion, sixty-two\r\npersons assembled in one of the Agency buildings, gathered their arms,\r\nand prepared to defend themselves. Part of the farmer Indians assisted\r\nOther-Day in standing guard round the house that night, part of them\r\nguarded the house of Rev. Mr. Riggs, their old missionary, to whom they\r\nwere very much attached, and another part joined the insurgents.\r\n\r\nSmall bands of hostile Indians were seen prowling around the house\r\nduring the night, and by the next morning it was nearly surrounded. At\r\ndaybreak, several shots were fired near the warehouses, some distance\r\naway, and then a triumphant yell was heard from the Indians as they\r\nbroke into the stores and killed the inmates. At this, the savages who\r\nhad prowled around the house during the night ran off to the scene of\r\nthe riot to share in the booty; and even the farmer Indians who had\r\nstood guard for the whites, excepting only Other-Day, followed them.\r\n\r\nOther-Day now advised the whites to make their escape, and offered to\r\npilot them out of danger. They were at first inclined to doubt his\r\nfaithfulness; but in their extremity, finally consented to follow him.\r\nWhile the hostile Indians were occupied in the work of plundering the\r\nstores and warehouses, the whites managed to collect three two-horse\r\nwagons, and two buggies, and placing as many of the women and children\r\nas they could in these, the party, sixty-two persons in all, started off\r\nin a direction opposite to the usually travelled route. They reached and\r\nforded the Minnesota River, eluded pursuit, and after a three days'\r\nmarch of great severity and privation, under the faithful and successful\r\nguidance of Other-Day, they arrived at a place of safety. True among the\r\ntreacherous, he should be gratefully remembered, and liberally rewarded\r\nand protected for the remainder of his life, by the people of Minnesota\r\nand the Government of the United States. When he reached St. Paul, after\r\nthe escape, he wrote the following, in answer to the many questions\r\nasked him:\r\n\r\n     \"I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the midst of evil. I grew\r\n     up without the knowledge of any good thing. I have been instructed\r\n     by Americans, and taught to read and write. This I found to be\r\n     good. I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and there\r\n     learned my vileness. At the present time, I have fallen into great\r\n     evil and affliction, but have escaped from it; and with fifty-four\r\n     men, women, and children, without moccasins, without food, and\r\n     without a blanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people,\r\n     and now my heart is glad. I attribute it to the mercy of the Great\r\n     Spirit.\r\n\r\n                                                      An-pe-tu-to-ke-ca.\r\n                                                           (Other-Day.)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother party of about forty persons escaped from the vicinity of Yellow\r\nMedicine, under the guidance of the missionary, Rev. Mr. Riggs, who was\r\nalso warned and aided by a few of the farmer Indians.\r\n\r\nHaving thus successfully attacked and destroyed the Lower Agency, at\r\nRedwood, and the Upper Agency, at Yellow Medicine, and having obtained\r\nlarge supplies of arms and ammunition from the stores and warehouses\r\nthey sacked at these points, part of the Indians divided into small\r\nmarauding bands, and scoured the country, attacking and murdering\r\nisolated settlers, burning houses, and stealing horses and cattle; but\r\nthe larger portion remained together, and, under the leadership of\r\nLittle Crow, planned further attacks.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles below the Lower Agency, on the north bank of the\r\nMinnesota, is Fort Ridgely; and twenty miles below the fort, on the\r\nsouthern bank of the river, is the town of New Ulm, which, as its name\r\nindicates, is mainly populated by German settlers. Early in the\r\nafternoon of Tuesday, August 19th, a party of citizens from New Ulm,\r\nreturning from a neighboring village, where they had gone to aid in\r\nrecruiting volunteers for the Union army, were fired upon from an ambush\r\nby a number of mounted Indians, and several of them killed. Those who\r\nescaped had barely time to get back to New Ulm and give the alarm before\r\nthe Indians advanced upon the town, and began firing at long range upon\r\nthe distressed and panic-stricken inhabitants, who were huddled\r\ntogether, in helpless confusion, in a few of the more protected houses.\r\nFortunately, a squad of eighteen armed men from one of the lower\r\ncounties had arrived there an hour or two previous. Only six of the\r\nnumber had good guns; but they immediately organized themselves, and\r\nwent forward to meet the savages. By dint of determined coolness and\r\nbravery, they held the Indians at bay, killing several of them, until,\r\nseeing the town reenforced by another small party of mounted whites, the\r\nsavages retreated. The fight lasted two or three hours, and a number of\r\nthe Germans were killed.\r\n\r\nBeaten back from New Ulm, the Indians retraced their course up the\r\nriver, and being joined by other bands, a concerted and deliberate\r\nattack was next made on Fort Ridgely. Like too many of our frontier\r\nforts, it is a fort only in name. Situated on a projecting spur of the\r\nriver bluff, it is almost completely encircled by deep and wooded\r\nravines, the edges of which are within a stone's throw of the buildings.\r\nA long, two story stone building with an ell, standing in the centre,\r\nand a number of log and frame houses ranged around it in an irregular\r\ncircle, with several barns and outhouses beyond them, constitute what is\r\ncalled the fort, but what is really only barracks for a small number of\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nWhen on Monday Captain Marsh left the fort to quell the disturbances at\r\nthe Agency, only about twenty-five soldiers remained to protect it.\r\nAfter his party was cut up in ambush, only twenty-one, wounded and all,\r\nreturned. Luckily, however, on Tuesday, two detachments of\r\nreenforcements, of about fifty men each, reached the garrison in safety.\r\nOn the other hand, from the beginning of the outbreak, the women and\r\nchildren of the surrounding country who had escaped massacre, sometimes\r\na whole family, sometimes only a single member--now a mother, and then a\r\nchild--fresh from the scenes of savage violence and blood, had been\r\nfleeing to the fort for safety, until the number had been swelled to\r\nsome three hundred. Six cannon, a few old condemned muskets, and\r\nconsiderable supplies of provisions were fortunately in the fort. Such\r\nhurried preparations for defence as could be, were soon made. Small\r\nsquads of Indians were seen prowling about during Monday and Tuesday,\r\nbut they were promptly scattered by a shell from the howitzer,\r\naccurately planted by the veteran artillery sergeant who was in charge\r\nof the guns.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, about three or\r\nfour hundred Indians, led by Little Crow, advanced under cover of the\r\nwoods and ravines to the attack of the garrison. It was a complete\r\nsurprise, the first announcement being a deadly volley through one of\r\nthe north entrances into the parade ground of the fort. For a moment\r\nthere was uncontrollable confusion and alarm among the whites, and had a\r\nstorming assault immediately followed, the fort must have fallen. The\r\ngarrison, however, quickly rallied, manned the guns, and poured a steady\r\nfire on their assailants. The Indians, as usual, took shelter behind\r\nevery available cover--trees, ravines, outhouses, high grass and\r\nlogs--the whites directing their return shots as best they could. In\r\nthis way, a brisk fusilade was kept up until half-past six o'clock in\r\nthe evening. A number of the outbuildings were fired by the enemy, but\r\nthe flames did not reach the fort. The houses that remained nearer the\r\nfort were destroyed by the garrison after the enemy withdrew. The\r\ngarrison lost twelve or fifteen men killed and wounded in this\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nA night of terrible anxiety and suspense succeeded, but there was no\r\nfurther disturbance. On the next day, Thursday, two more attacks, each\r\nlasting about half an hour, were made, one at nine o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and the other at six in the evening, but they were much feebler\r\nthan the previous one, and easily repulsed.\r\n\r\nThe final and most desperate attack occurred on Friday, the\r\ntwenty-second. The garrison was engaged in strengthening its defences,\r\nwhen, at one o'clock in the afternoon, the sentinel saw at two miles\r\ndistance great numbers of Indians approaching on horseback. As they\r\nneared the fort they dismounted, and advancing from three different\r\npoints under cover of the ravines, where the shells from the field\r\npieces could do them but little damage, they opened a terrible fire on\r\nthe garrison. But the previous two days' siege had steadied the nerves\r\nof the whites, and they received the onslaught coolly, reserving their\r\nfire until they could obtain a fair view of the enemy, and do effective\r\nexecution. The \"big guns,\" of which Indians stand in so great dread,\r\nwere also well served. The fight raged all the afternoon, from two until\r\nhalf past six o'clock. Once the savages pressed up so near that the\r\nhalfbreeds in the fort could distinguish the shout of the chiefs\r\nordering a charge for the purpose of capturing the guns. It was a\r\nconcerted movement; a feint to draw the fire of the field pieces, and an\r\nimmediate rush was made to secure them before they could be reloaded.\r\nBut the old artillery sergeant was not to be trapped; he reserved the\r\nfire of his own gun, and when the storming party emerged into open view,\r\nhe planted a shell among them which sent them howling back to their\r\nshelter. At nightfall the savages reluctantly gave up the siege and\r\nretired, carrying away a considerable number of killed and wounded.\r\nThose in the fort escaped miraculously; only one man being killed, and\r\nthree or four slightly wounded.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Saturday, the Indians were seen again approaching the\r\nfort, apparently to renew the attack; but it was soon discovered they\r\nwere withdrawing, to wreak their thwarted vengeance on the devoted town\r\nof New Ulm. In the interim since the first attack, the town had been\r\nreenforced by about one hundred volunteers, and had also been put in a\r\npartial state of defence. Fire, murder, and pillage marked the way of\r\nthe savages toward it; the garrison noted their approach by the clouds\r\nof smoke which the burning dwellings of the settlers sent up to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Indians reached and again attacked New Ulm, on Sunday morning at\r\nabout eleven o'clock. The commanding officer of the whites had placed\r\npickets, and a considerable part of his force to support them, along the\r\nouter edge of the town toward the foe; but so fierce and impetuous was\r\nthe attack, that the whites were forced back into the town at the first\r\nonset of the enemy, giving them possession of several of the outer\r\nbuildings, from which they pushed their further operations. But the\r\ngarrison soon rallied, and obstinately held their ground. Finding\r\nthemselves so unexpectedly held at bay, the Indians, who were to the\r\nwindward, set fire one after another to the buildings they held, thus\r\nliterally burning their way into the town. All day long this continued.\r\nToward evening, the whites found they had been forced back, inch by\r\ninch, by the fire and smoke and the swift leaden messengers of death,\r\nuntil nearly one half of the town was lost; but they rallied once more,\r\nmade a vigorous charge on the foe, and drove them out. At this the\r\nIndians withdrew, forming themselves into three parties, and camped a\r\nshort distance off, making the night hideous with fiendish yells and the\r\nhorrid music of their war dances. During the night the garrison\r\nretreated into a still smaller and more defensible part of the town,\r\ncommitting the rest to flames. A brief demonstration was made by the\r\nenemy on the following morning, but finding the whites so well posted,\r\nthey finally abandoned the contest and withdrew. The whites, exhausted\r\nand cut up, joyfully welcomed a cessation of hostilities. During the day\r\nthey evacuated the town, bringing off what remained of the garrison in\r\nsafety. In this battle they lost ten killed, and about fifty wounded,\r\nwhile the Indians lost about forty. They were seen to haul off four\r\nwagon loads of dead.\r\n\r\nThe events thus far narrated cover a period of nine days, and, though\r\nforming the principal ones, were by no means the only events of that\r\nbrief time. The contagion of murder, arson, and rapine spread over the\r\nwhole area of country on which the Indians lived and roved, embracing a\r\ndistrict one hundred miles in width by two hundred in length. Fort\r\nAbercrombie, situated at the upper end of this vast tract, was\r\nsurrounded and besieged, as Fort Ridgely at the lower end had been.\r\nThroughout the intermediate region, scattering parties of the savages\r\nappeared in the isolated villages and settlements, spreading death and\r\ndesolation. Local conditions exaggerated and heightened the horrors of\r\nthe insurrection. The population of Minnesota, and particularly of these\r\nexposed regions, unlike that of the lower Western States, whose\r\nsettlers, trained in border warfare, were familiar with savage craft and\r\ncruelty, and inherited the prowess and spirit of daring adventure which\r\npossessed Daniel Boone, was largely made up of foreign emigrants,\r\nGermans, French, Norwegians, and Swedes. They were unaccustomed to\r\ndanger, and unused to arms. They had lived for years in confidence and\r\ndaily intercourse with the Indians. Engaged in the absorbing labor of\r\nbuilding and providing their new homes, they were without guns or other\r\nweapons of defence. Still worse, the war for the Union had called into\r\nits ranks a large proportion of their young, active, and able-bodied\r\nmen, and left only the women and children to gather the harvest and\r\nguard the hearthstone. Upon their heads this storm burst suddenly, and\r\nwith a terror which deprived them of all courage and resource to resist\r\nit. Emboldened by the feeble opposition they met, and maddened by the\r\ncarnival of blood in which they rioted, the savages indulged in\r\ncruelties and barbarities too horrible to recount in detail. The\r\nGovernor of Minnesota, in a special message to the Legislature of the\r\nState, thus paints them:\r\n\r\n     'Infants hewn into bloody chips of flesh, or nailed alive to door\r\n     posts to linger out their little life in mortal agony, or torn\r\n     untimely from the womb of the murdered mother, and in cruel mockery\r\n     cast in fragments on her pulseless and bleeding breast; rape\r\n     joined to murder in one awful tragedy; young girls, even children\r\n     of tender years, outraged by their brutal ravishers, till death\r\n     ended their shame and suffering; women held in captivity to undergo\r\n     the horrors of a living death; whole families burned alive; and as\r\n     if their devilish fury could not glut itself with outrages on the\r\n     living, its last efforts exhausted in mutilating the bodies of the\r\n     dead; such are the spectacles, and a thousand nameless horrors\r\n     besides, which their first experience of Indian war has burned into\r\n     the brains and hearts of our frontier people.'....\r\n\r\nA wild panic ensued. Those who escaped the tomahawk and scalping knife\r\nfled in consternation and dismay, abandoning their little earthly all,\r\nleaving their cattle astray on the prairies, and their crops uncut and\r\nungathered in the fields; some fleeing with such precipitation as to\r\nleave their food untouched on the table, where but a moment before it\r\nhad been spread for the daily repast. Women and children wandered for\r\ndays in the woods, subsisting on nuts and berries. Every road was lined\r\nwith fugitives, and all the villages were crowded with their surrounding\r\npopulation. The refugees poured by hundreds into the city of St. Paul,\r\nsituated from eighty to one hundred and fifty miles from the scenes of\r\nthe outbreak; and many, who were able to do so, embarked on the first\r\ndeparting steamers, and hurried away from the State. It is estimated\r\nthat ten large and flourishing counties were almost completely\r\ndepopulated.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that a portion of the volunteers recruited for the Union\r\narmy had not yet been ordered out of the State. Though poorly equipped\r\nand supplied, they were at once sent into the field against the Indians,\r\nand they served as a nucleus around which the irregular organizations\r\ncould rally. Every old gun, pistol, knife, or other weapon was cleaned\r\nup; every pound of powder and lead was bought and distributed; and\r\nhorses were impressed by military authority, with which to extemporize\r\ncavalry companies. The surrounding States promptly sent what aid they\r\ncould in men, guns, and cartridges. The Governor by proclamation\r\nauthorized the formation of companies of scouts and rangers in the\r\nthreatened neighborhoods. Very soon after the outbreak, Colonel H. H.\r\nSibley, an experienced frontiersman, having a thorough knowledge of\r\nIndian habits and character, was on the march against them, with about\r\none thousand men. The General Government augmented these forces as\r\nrapidly as possible, and sent Major-General Pope to assume command of\r\nthe Indian Department.\r\n\r\nHearing of Colonel Sibley's approach, Little Crow retreated to Yellow\r\nMedicine, taking with him a large baggage train of plunder, and about\r\none hundred white prisoners, chiefly women and children, whom he had\r\ncaptured at different places, and whom, with a few exceptions, they did\r\nnot specially maltreat, but compelled to labor at camp drudgery.\r\n\r\nColonel Sibley pushed on with his forces, sending in advance a cavalry\r\ndetachment, which reached and relieved Fort Ridgely on the 27th of\r\nAugust, after it had been besieged for nine days. He himself arrived at\r\nthat post with the remainder of his troops on the following day. On the\r\n31st, he sent out a detachment of two companies, one mounted, a fatigue\r\nparty of twenty men, and seventeen teams and teamsters, to reconnoitre\r\nthe neighboring settlements and to bury the dead. They proceeded to the\r\nMinnesota river opposite the Lower Agency, and found and buried sixteen\r\ncorpses the first day. The next day they continued their search, finding\r\nand burying fifty-four. That night they encamped on the open prairie,\r\nnear the upper timber of the Birch Coolie creek, three miles from the\r\nLower Agency. At about four o'clock of the next morning, September 2,\r\none of their sentinels shouted, \"Indians!\" and almost immediately, a\r\nshower of balls rained upon the camp. From this first fire, and during\r\nthe confusion attending it, the detachment suffered severely. They soon,\r\nhowever, gained the shelter of their wagons, and from behind them and\r\nthe piles of dead horses which literally covered the ground, they\r\nreturned a vigorous fire upon their assailants, meanwhile digging a\r\nrifle pit as they fought. It was a fierce morning's battle, and the foe,\r\nin largely superior numbers, had nearly surrounded and captured them\r\nwhen reenforcements arrived. So hot was the attack, that one of the\r\ntents was found to have one hundred and forty bullet holes through it.\r\n\r\nThe boldness and severity of this attack, demonstrated to Colonel Sibley\r\nthe necessity for an increase of force and very cautious movements, and\r\naccordingly he fell back to the neighborhood of Fort Ridgely. Anxious\r\nalso to obtain the release of the white prisoners in Little Crow's camp,\r\nand fearing that if he won a decided success in battle they would be\r\nmurdered, he determined to resort to negotiation. He therefore wrote the\r\nfollowing note and left it fastened to a stake, on the ground where the\r\nlast battle had taken place:\r\n\r\n     'If Little Crow has any propositions to make to me, let him send a\r\n     halfbreed to me, and he shall be protected in and out of my camp.\r\n\r\n                                                           H. H. SIBLEY,\r\n                                         Col. Com. Military Expedition.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA day or two afterward, two halfbreeds came into his camp under a flag\r\nof truce, bringing a note signed 'Little Crow, his mark,' excusing and\r\njustifying his attack on the whites. Colonel Sibley replied, 'Little\r\nCrow, you have murdered many of our people without cause. Return me the\r\nprisoners under a flag of truce, and I will talk with you like a man.'\r\nAfter the lapse of a few days, another message came from Little Crow,\r\nstating that he had one hundred and fifty-five prisoners, and asking\r\nwhat he could do to make peace. Colonel Sibley replied that his young\r\nmen had been committing more murders, and that was not the way to make\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nHaving learned from several sources that serious dissensions had broken\r\nout in the Indian camp, and having also received the needed\r\nreenforcements, Colonel Sibley left Fort Ridgely on the 12th of\r\nSeptember, and marched up the Minnesota river to Wood Lake, near Yellow\r\nMedicine, arriving there on the 22d following. Little Crow was encamped\r\nin the vicinity with his braves. The savages, however, had become\r\ndemoralized, and he could no longer control them. Little Crow desired to\r\nmake an attack that night, but his opponents told him in council that if\r\nhe was a brave Indian he would fight the white man by daylight.\r\nAccordingly, next morning he attacked Colonel Sibley's forces with three\r\nhundred of his warriors, the others refusing to join in the fight. After\r\na sharp two-hours' battle the Indians were completely routed, losing\r\nthirty killed, and a proportionate number of wounded. The whites lost\r\nfour killed, and forty wounded.\r\n\r\nThis battle substantially ended the war. The Indians retreated, and the\r\nwhites pursued them to Lac Qui Parle. Four days afterward, a camp of\r\nabout one hundred and fifty lodges of Indians and halfbreeds separated\r\nfrom Little Crow's party, met Colonel Sibley in council, surrendered\r\nthemselves, and formally delivered up to him ninety-one white prisoners,\r\nand over one hundred halfbreeds, whom they had obtained. Other parties\r\ncame in afterward, surrendering themselves unconditionally, until\r\nbetween two and three thousand Indians, of all sexes and ages, were in\r\nthe hands of the troops as prisoners of war. A military commission was\r\nappointed to try the ringleaders and worst offenders, and over three\r\nhundred of them were convicted and sentenced to death. Before this paper\r\nis printed, some, at least, of these, will have expiated their crimes on\r\nthe gallows. Little Crow, with a small but desperate band of followers,\r\nsucceeded in making his escape to Devil's Lake in Dakota Territory.\r\n\r\nThe future disposition of the Indians of the State of Minnesota is one\r\nof the most perplexing minor questions of the day. In their present\r\nlocation, the feud of race engendered by the insurrection will only die\r\nwith the generation that witnessed its beginning. Humanitarian impulses\r\nand humanitarian duties are forgotten in the fierce thirst for private\r\nvengeance. With one voice, the people of that State demand the removal\r\nor threaten the extermination of their dangerous neighbors. But whither\r\nshall they go? The swallowing tides of civilization encompass them on\r\nthe east, the north, and the south; and the only other avenue, the west,\r\nis guarded by the gaunt wolf starvation.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by some to colonize them on the island of Isle Royale, in\r\nLake Superior; by others, to purchase some small West India island, and\r\ntransport them there, where tropical nature will feed them without\r\nexpense to the Government. Perhaps the more practical measure would be\r\nto gather all that remains of the red race within the United States into\r\none Territory, to establish a more thorough guardianship over them, and\r\nto subject them to a stricter and more absolute government, which should\r\ncompel them to assume gradually the duties and customs of civilized\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'DEAD!'\r\n\r\n\r\n           With chilling breath it comes:\r\n   Again--and yet again! on every gale,\r\n     America! from thy great battle field!\r\n           Our hearts are hushed, and desolate our homes--\r\n   Our lids are heavy, and our cheeks are pale--\r\n               While thus we yield\r\n             Our loved ones up to thee!\r\n\r\n         Dead! dying at their posts!\r\n   The young, the noble, and the loving ones!\r\n     The widow's all! the gray-haired father's hope--\r\n         All thine, my country! take the treasured hosts:\r\n   Hold in thy faithful keeping all thy sons!\r\n               We give them up--\r\n             To thee and liberty!\r\n\r\n           Oh, keep our honored dead\r\n   Within the folds of thy great-pulsing heart!\r\n     Entwine their memory with thy polished lore:\r\n           Cherish the sacred dust above _their_ bed\r\n   Who sprang to shield thee from the traitor's dart!\r\n             Bless evermore\r\n           The dead who died for thee!\r\n\r\n         Silent the teardrops fall\r\n   Down the pale mother's cheek at close of day;\r\n     For sorrow sitteth at the widow's gate:\r\n         Dark are the shadows gathered on the wall,\r\n   And where the mourner bendeth low to pray--\r\n             No more to wait\r\n           The coming of her free!\r\n\r\n           For thee--'dear native land!'\r\n   What precious hopes are severed one by one!\r\n     What hearts lie crushed and sick by 'hope deferred!'\r\n           How many dear ones, stretched along the sand,\r\n   Bleed out their lives beneath a blighting sun--\r\n             With but a word--\r\n           'Mother!' for plaint or prayer!\r\n\r\n         Shall they be vainly shed--\r\n   The blood and tears that wash our stricken soil?\r\n     Bringing no healing with their torrent streams?\r\n         Vain the long requiem for the noble dead--\r\n   Vain all the agony and all the toil--\r\n             The soldier's dreams--\r\n           The patriot's thought and care?\r\n\r\n           No! float upon the winds!\r\n   Flag of my country! let thy stars give light\r\n     To nations of the earth! proclaim afar\r\n           The end of tyrant rule that madly binds\r\n   Our millions down beneath a fearful blight!\r\n             Float--_every star_!\r\n           We have not one to spare!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n     'ALL of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we rode over my friend's plantation. It contained about\r\ntwelve hundred acres, mainly covered with forest trees, but with here\r\nand there an isolated patch of cleared land devoted to corn and cotton.\r\nA small tributary of the Trent formed its northern boundary, and\r\nbordering the little stream was a tract of three hundred acres of low,\r\nswampy ground, heavily timbered with cypress and juniper. Tall old\r\npines, denuded of bark for one third of their height, and their white\r\nfaces bearded with long, shining flakes of 'scrape turpentine,' crowned\r\nthe uplands; and scattered among them, about a hundred well-clad,\r\n'well-kept' negro men and women were shouting pleasantly to one another,\r\nor singing merrily some simple song of 'Ole Car'lina,' as with the long\r\nscrapers they peeled the glistening scales from the scarified trees, or,\r\ngathering them in their aprons, 'dumped' them into the rude barrels\r\nprepared for their reception. Preston had a kind word for each one that\r\nwe passed--a pleasant inquiry about an infirm mother or a sick child, or\r\nsome encouraging comment on their cheerful work; and many were the\r\nhearty blessings they showered upon 'good massa,' and many their\r\ngood-natured exclamations over 'de strange gemman dat sells massa's\r\ntruck.'\r\n\r\n'He'm de kine, 'ou gals,' shouted an old darky, bent nearly double with\r\nage, who, leaning against one of the barrels, was 'packing down' the\r\nflakes as they were emptied from the aprons of the women: 'He'm de kine,\r\nI tell by him eye; de rocks doan't grow fass ter dat gemman's pocket!'\r\n\r\n'Well, they don't, uncle,' I replied, tossing him a half-dollar piece,\r\nand throwing a handful of smaller coin among the women. A general\r\nscramble followed, in which the old fellow nimbly joined, shouting out\r\nbetween his boisterous explosions of merriment:\r\n\r\n'Dis am de sort, massa; dis am manna rainin' in de wilderness--de Lord's\r\nchil'ren lub dis kine--it'm good ter take, massa, good ter take.'\r\n\r\n'Good as black jack, eh, uncle?' I inquired, laughing, for I saw certain\r\nlines about his shrunken mouth, and underneath his sunken eyes, which\r\ntold plainly he was rather too familiar with that delicious compound of\r\nstrychnine and whiskey.\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, good as black Jack; dat's my name, massa, dat's my\r\nname--yah, yah,' and he turned his face, wet with merry tears, and\r\ndistended in an uncommonly broad grin, up to mine. In a moment, however,\r\nhis eye caught Preston's. His broad visage collapsed, his distended\r\nmouth shrank to a very diminutive opening, and his twinkling eyes\r\nassumed a peculiarly stolid expression, as he added, in a deprecatory\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n'No, massa Robert, not so good as black jack; not so good as dat--'ou\r\nknows I doan't keer fur him; you knows I doan't knows him no more, massa\r\nRobert.'\r\n\r\n'I know you never knew him,' replied Preston, playing on his name. 'He's\r\na hardened old sinner. He has sinned away the day of grace, I'm sure.\r\nBut you know better than to ask presents of strangers. Give it back to\r\nthe gentleman at once.'\r\n\r\nAn indescribable expression stole over the old negro's visage as he\r\nthrust his hand through his thin, frosty wool, looked pleadingly up at\r\nhis master's face, and, seeing no signs of relenting there, slowly and\r\nreluctantly opened his palm and offered me the money.\r\n\r\n'No, no, Preston, let him keep it; it won't do him any harm,' I said.\r\n\r\n'No more'n it woan't, good massa, not a morsel ob harm,' exclaimed the\r\ndarky, his small eyes twinkling again with pleasurable anticipation, and\r\nhis broad face widening into its accustomed grin: 'I woan't take nary a\r\ndrop, massa Robert, nary a drop!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said his master, 'you can keep it if you'll promise not to drink\r\nit all to-morrow. So much whiskey would spoil your prayer at the\r\nmeeting.'\r\n\r\n'So it 'ould, massa Robert; so much as dat; but Jack allers prays de\r\nstronger fur a little, massa Robert, jess a little--it sort o' 'pears\r\nter warm up a ole man's sperrets, and ter fotch all de 'votion right\r\ninter him froat.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose it does; all the devotion you ever feel. You're an old\r\nsinner, Jack, past praying for, I fear,' replied Preston,\r\ngood-naturedly, turning his horse to go.\r\n\r\n'Not pass prayin' fur 'ou, massa Robert, not pass dat, an' ole Jack\r\nneber will be, nudder--not so long as he kin holler loud 'nuff fur de\r\nLord ter yere. 'Ou may 'pend on dat, massa Robert, 'ou may 'pend on\r\ndat.'\r\n\r\nAs we rode away, I asked Preston if the old black led the services at\r\nthe negro meetings.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am obliged to let him. He was formerly the plantation preacher,\r\nand, with all his faults, the blacks are much attached to him. A small\r\nrebellion broke out among them, five years ago, when I displaced him,\r\nand put Joe into the pulpit. I compromised the difficulty by agreeing\r\nthat Jack should lead in prayer every Sunday morning. They think he has\r\na gift that way, and _you_ would conclude the day of Pentecost had come,\r\nif you should hear him when he is about half-seas-over.'\r\n\r\n'Then he does pray better for a little whiskey?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, a mug of 'black jack' helps him amazingly--it gives him the real\r\npower.'\r\n\r\nAfter a two hours' circuit of the plantation, we halted in the vicinity\r\nof the distilleries, which stood huddled together on the bank of the\r\nlittle stream of which I have spoken. There were three of them, each of\r\nthirty barrels' capacity--an enormous size--and they were neatly set in\r\nbrick, and enclosed in a substantial framed structure, which was\r\nweatherboarded and coated with paint of a dark brown color. Near the\r\nonly one then in operation were several large heaps of flake turpentine,\r\nthree or four hundred barrels of rosin, and a vast quantity of the same\r\nmaterial scattered loosely about and mixed with broken staves, worn-out\r\nstrainers, and the _debris_ of the rosin bins. Pointing to the confused\r\nmass, I said to my host:\r\n\r\n'I've half a mind to turn missionary. I feel a sort of call to preach to\r\nyou Southern heathen.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you would,' he rejoined, laughing; 'you'd give me a chance to\r\nlaugh at your sermons, as you have laughed at mine.'\r\n\r\n'No, you wouldn't laugh. I'd make you _feel_ way down in your pocket.\r\nI'd have but one sermon and one text, and that would be: 'Gather up the\r\nfragments, that nothing be lost.' You Southern nabobs do nothing but\r\nwaste--you waste enough in one day to feed the whole North for a week.\r\nIt's a sin--the unpardonable sin--for you know better.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it _is_ wrong, but how can we help it? We can't make the negroes\r\nanything but what they are--shiftless and careless of everything but\r\ntheir own ease.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know about that. I think such a man as Joe ought to be able to\r\nmanage them.'\r\n\r\n'Joe! Well, he can't. He's all drive, and negroes are human beings; they\r\nshould be treated kindly.'\r\n\r\nWe had approached the front of the still, and were fastening our horses\r\nto the trunk of a tree, when we heard loud voices issuing from the other\r\nside of the enclosure.\r\n\r\n'Her'm what I owes you--now pack off ter onst, and don't neber show your\r\nface on dis plantation no more,' said a voice, which I at once\r\nrecognized as that of 'boss Joe.'\r\n\r\n'I shan't pack off till I'm ready, you d--d black nigger, I've been\r\nbossed 'bout by ye long 'nuff. Clar out, and 'tend ter yer own 'fairs,'\r\nrejoined another voice, which had the tone of a white man's.\r\n\r\n'I reckon _dis_ am my 'fair, and I shan't leff you git drunk and burn up\r\nno more white rosum yere; so take yerseff off. Ef you don't, I'll make\r\nyou blacker nor I is.'\r\n\r\n'Put your hand on me, and I'll take the law on ye, _shore_,' returned\r\nthe white man.\r\n\r\n'Pshaw, you drunken fool, do you s'pose dese darkies would tell on _me_?\r\nEf dey would, dar word ain't 'lowed in de law; so you trabble. I don't\r\nkeer ter handle you, but I shill ef you don't leab widin five minutes.'\r\n\r\nWhat might have followed will not go down in history, for just then\r\nPreston and I, emerging from around the corner of the building, appeared\r\nin view of the belligerents. The native--a respectable specimen of the\r\nclass of poor whites--stood in a defiant attitude before the still-fire,\r\nwhile Joe was seated on a turpentine barrel near, quietly noting the\r\ntime by a large silver watch which he held in his hand. He kept on\r\ncounting the minutes, and gave no heed to his master's approach, till\r\nPreston said:\r\n\r\n'Joe, what's to pay?'\r\n\r\n'Nuffin, master Robert, 'cept I'se 'scharged dis man, and he say he\r\nwon't gwo.'\r\n\r\n'Do as Joseph bids you,' said Preston, turning to the white man, 'take\r\nyour pay and go at once.'\r\n\r\nThe man stammered out a few words with a cringing air, but the planter\r\ncut him short with:\r\n\r\n'I want no explanations. If you can't satisfy Joseph, you can't satisfy\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nThe native then leisurely took down a ragged coat that hung from one of\r\nthe timbers, counted over a small roll of bank notes which Joe gave him,\r\nand meekly left the still-house.\r\n\r\nJoe and his master devoted the next half hour to piloting me over the\r\ndistilleries. I commented rather freely on the sad waste of valuable\r\nproduce which was scattered about, and on the bad economy of keeping\r\nthree 'stills' to do the work of one.\r\n\r\n'It might have done years ago,' I remarked, 'before your trees ran to\r\n'scrape,' and when they yielded enough 'dip' to keep all the stills\r\nbusy; but now they are eating you up. You have fully four thousand\r\ndollars idle here. Sell them, Preston--that amount would help you out of\r\ndebt.'\r\n\r\n'Dat's what I tells master Robert, Mr. Kirke, but he sort o' clings to\r\nole tings, _sar_,' said Joe, in the free, familiar tone usual with him.\r\n\r\n'But _you_ do just as badly, Joe,' I replied. 'You let these darkies\r\nwaste more than they eat, and you keep four here to do the work of\r\nthree. You are no better than your master.'\r\n\r\n'Only half so good, Mr. Kirke,' rejoined the black, showing a set of\r\nteeth which a dentist might have used for a door plate; 'only _half_ so\r\ngood, 'case I'se only half white. But, if master Robert 'ould leff me\r\nhandle de whip, I'd show him suffin'! I reckon de int'rest 'ouldn't be\r\nahind den.'\r\n\r\n'Why? don't you let Joe whip the negroes?' I asked Preston.\r\n\r\n'No, not now; I did, till some years ago, when he almost killed one of\r\nthem, and came near getting me into serious trouble. He could manage\r\nthem well enough without whipping, if he'd curb his impetuous temper a\r\nlittle.'\r\n\r\n'But I does curb it, master Robert, and it tain't ob no use. Dey knows I\r\n_can't_ whip 'em, an' dey don't keer fur de starvin', or de tyin' up, or\r\nde talkin' to in de meetin'. Dey don't mind fur nuffin' but de whip, an'\r\na little ex'cise wid dat does a nigger good when he'm right down\r\n'fractory. And you has 'lowed, master Robert, dat I warn't so much ter\r\nblame in dat 'fair ob Black Cale.'\r\n\r\n'Well, perhaps you weren't. It's a good story, Kirke; did I ever tell it\r\nto you?'\r\n\r\n'No; I'd be glad to hear it.'\r\n\r\n'Come, Joe,' said his master, good-naturedly, 'you can tell it better\r\nthan I. You know it by heart.'\r\n\r\n'Well, master, if you says so,' replied Joe; and as we seated ourselves\r\nin a semicircle on some rosin barrels, the black proceeded to give the\r\nfollowing illustration of the working of free and slave institutions:\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, Mr. Kirke, de darky's name wus Black Cale, an' he wus a\r\nraised up 'long wid me by de ole gemman--dat am master Robert's\r\ngran'fer. He wus allers a hard-bitted, 'fractory darky, but he wus\r\nsmart, awful smart, and could do a heap ob work when a minded to; but he\r\nwusn't a minded to bery of'en, an' ole master used to hab ter flog\r\nhim--flog him bery hard. Well, finarly, de ole gemman grow'd tired ob\r\ndoin' so much ob dat, an' he call Cale ter him one day, an' he say:\r\n\r\n''Cale, you'se a likely nigger, an' I _don't_ like ter flog you so much.\r\nNow, I'll leff you hire you' time, an' gwo down ter Newbern, an' shirk\r\nfur you'seff.'\r\n\r\n'Ole master knowed Cale wus habin' a bad 'fect on de oder darkies, an'\r\nhe 'lowed 'twould be cheap leffin' him gwo ef he didn't get a picayune\r\nfur him. Well, Cale, he took ter dat ter onst, an' he 'greed to gib ole\r\nmaster one fifty a year fur his time; an' so he put off ter Newbern.\r\nWell, ebery ting gwo on right smart till de ole gemman die. Cale, he\r\nwork hard, pay master ebery year, and sabe up quite a heap. Well, ole\r\nmaster die widout a will, an' all de property gwo ter de two sons; dat\r\nam master James an' master Thomas--he war master Robert's fader. Now\r\nmaster James he neber lib'd on de plantation, so he sold all his half ob\r\nde nigs to master Thomas, an' put all de 'vails inter his bisness down\r\ndar ter Mobile, whar he am now, doin' a heap in de cotton way. But he\r\ndidn't sell his half ob Cale, 'case master Thomas wouldn't buy him,\r\nnohow. Well, dey owned Cale tugedder fur a spell, an' Cale he work on\r\nright smart, till one day master James come home, and he tells master\r\nThomas dat on de way he'd a stopped at Newbern, and sole his half ob\r\nCale ter Cale heseff, fur five hundred dollar, and giben him de free\r\npapers. Well, den Cale he want to buy de oder half ob heseff ob master\r\nThomas, an' master Thomas he offer to take de same money; but Cale say\r\nde oder half not wuth so much as de fust, an' dat he wouldn't gib only\r\ntwo fifty.'\r\n\r\n'Not worth so much--why not?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Why, Cale say 'case he could do what he like wid de free half, and he\r\nreckoned he shouldn't be quite so 'sponsible _den_ fur de slave half,'\r\nand here Joe broke into a merry fit of laughter, in which Preston\r\njoined.\r\n\r\n'Well, master Thomas an' Cale couldn't 'gree 'bout de buyin', but Cale\r\npromise to gib seventy-five dollar a year fur de use ob master's half,\r\nan' he gwo off agin ter Newbern. Den de time gwo by fur a yar or two,\r\nbut master neber git nary dime out ob Cale fur his half. Cale would say\r\ndat only half ob him wus free, an' de oder half wasn't 'sponsible, and\r\ncouldn't pay its debts, nohow. Finarly, master, seein' he couldn't git\r\nnuffin out ob Cale, only offers ob two fifty fur de oder half--and _dat_\r\nhe wouldn't take, nohow--sent me down to Newbern to sort o' mediate\r\n'tween Cale an' he. Well, I coaxed Cale to 'gree to wuck one monfh for\r\nheseff and de oder monfh fur massa, and I come home; but it warn't ob no\r\nuse; Cale would wuck, but massa neber seed a fip ob de pay. Finarly,\r\naf'er he'd a gone on dat way 'bout ten yar, stowin' 'way what he arned\r\nwhar nobody could fine it, an' allers off'rin' two fifty fur de oder\r\nhalf ob heseff, master Thomas he die, and master Robert he come ter lib\r\non de plantation. Den master Robert axed me what he should do wid Cale,\r\nand I tole him to take de two fifty, and leff him gwo. But he say, 'no,'\r\ndat he wouldn't sell him fur dat, nohow.' And here the black looked\r\nslyly at his master, and a merry twinkle came into his eyes. 'Well, den,\r\nI tole master Robert dat I tought I could fix Cale ef he'd leff me\r\nmanage him jess as I like. He 'greed to dat, an' I gwoes down to\r\nNewbern, an' makes Cale come home, an' den I say to him:\r\n\r\n''Now, Cale, you stay yere, an' gwo to wuck. Ebery monfh you wuck fur\r\nme, an' ebery oder monfh you wuck fur you'seff, an' when you wuck fur\r\nyou'seff I pay you so much fur ebery barr'l ob dip, an' so much fur\r\nebery barr'l ob scrape, an' so much fur ebery day when you wuck roun';\r\nan' I makes you pay so much fur what you lib on. Well, Cale, he 'gree to\r\ndat. He wuck de fust monfh fur heseff, an' he _did_ wuck--he done twice\r\nso much as any hand on de plantation; but de next monfh, when he wuck\r\nfur _me_, he don't do nuffin but lay 'bout, an' git drunk. I stood dat\r\ntill de monfh wus up--fur I neber did take ter whippin' de nigs, an'\r\nmaster Robert know dat--an' den w'en Cale wus clean sober, I tied him up\r\nto gib him a floggin'. Well, w'en he wus a stripped, an' I was jess\r\ngwine to lay on de lashes, Cale say to me, says he:\r\n\r\n''Look a yere, 'ou Joe, 'ou may whip massa's half ob dis nig jess so\r\nlong as 'ou likes, but ef 'ou put de lash onter _my_ half, I'll take de\r\nlaw on 'ou. I will, shore.'\r\n\r\n'Dat sot me a tinkin'; fur de fac wus, I'd nary right to flog _his_\r\nhalf; but den it 'curred ter me dat none but darkies wus roun', an' so I\r\ntought I had him, _shore_. Well, I puts on de lashes, an' he keeps a\r\ntellin' me he'd hab de law on me, which make me sort o' 'zasparated,\r\ntill I put 'em on right smart, an' at lass he gib in. Well, w'en I'd a\r\ngot him a feelin' 'bout right, an' wus only jess puttin' de lass blows\r\non to finish up makin' a decent nigger ob him, master Robert he come up,\r\nand when he seed de blood a runnin' down his back, he say Cale had been\r\nwhipped 'bout 'nough, and I must stop. Cale turned up missin' dat night,\r\nan' got off to Newbern; an' shore 'nuff, de next evenin', long 'bout\r\ndark, de sherrif he rode up to de house wid a writ fur master Robert fur\r\nhabin' made 'salt an' batt'ry on one collud man, called Caleb Preston,\r\nan' he pulled out a suspeny dat make massa Robert witness agin heseff!\r\nha! ha! You see Cale wus smart; he know'd master Robert b'longed to de\r\nBaptist meeting, an' wouldn't lie fur all de niggers in Jones county; so\r\nhe had him dar, ha! ha!'\r\n\r\nHere Joe for some minutes was unable to continue the narrative. His\r\nmerriment was contagious. I laughed till my sides were sore, and Preston\r\nenjoyed the story quite as much as I did.\r\n\r\n'Well, what was the end of it?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Only, master Robert hed to be toted off to Newbern dat night, git bail\r\nor sleep in de jail, and de next mornin', af'er de nig hed a hed ten\r\nyars' use ob heseff fur nuffin, master Robert hed to do what _he'd_ a\r\nsaid, an' his fader afore him hed said, dey neber would do--dat is, take\r\ntwo fifty fur de oder half ob Cale! Ha! ha! De next time I gwoes to\r\nNewbern I hunt Cale up, an' I tell him he must study fur de law, shore;\r\nan' dat ef he done it, I know'd master Robert would pay de 'spences, out\r\nob lub to de country.'\r\n\r\nThe negroes who were attending the still had dropped their work to\r\nlisten to Joe's story, and at its close guffawed in a chorus that made\r\nthe woods ring. Hearing it, Joe sprang to his feet, shouting out:\r\n'Yere--'bout you' wuck dar; leff me kotch you eavesdroppin' on gemmen\r\nagin, an' I'll gib you what I gabe Cale. 'Bout you' wuck, I say.' They\r\nturned nimbly to their tasks, and Joe resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n'I see the moral of that story, Preston,' I said, when the negro had\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n'What is it?'\r\n\r\n'That a darky may be as smart as a white man. Cale outwitted you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, he did,' he replied, laughing; 'but that isn't the moral: it is\r\nthat flogging never accomplishes its object.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not so sure of that. Joe had brought Cale to terms, 'made a decent\r\nnigger on him,' when you, unluckily, interfered.'\r\n\r\n'It ain't so much de floggin' on 'em, Mr. Kirke,' said Joe, 'as dar\r\nknowin' dat you _will_ do it ef dey desarve it. Dar ain't a darky on de\r\nplantation dat don't know master Robert an' de good missus 'ould rader\r\nbe flogged demselves dan flog dem; an' dat wucks bad, Mr. Kirke, sorry\r\nbad;' and the negro shook his head with a grave, thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n'Tell me, Preston,' I said, after a slight pause, 'how is it that your\r\nneighbor Dawsey, with only seventy-five negroes, sends us more produce\r\nthan you do with a hundred and fifty?'\r\n\r\n'Simply because he treats his hands like brutes, while I treat mine like\r\nmen.'\r\n\r\n'I hope you'll take no offence,' I replied, 'but it appears to me there\r\nmust be some other reason. He has only _half_ your number.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I will tell you how he and I manage, and you can judge for\r\nyourself. Dawsey has seventy-five slaves; forty child-bearing women,\r\ntwenty men, and fifteen children under five years. The sixty adults are\r\nall prime hands. They are given daily tasks, which they cannot possibly\r\ndo in less than fifteen hours, leaving them only nine hours out of the\r\ntwenty-four for eating, sleeping, feeding their children, and the waking\r\nrest necessary to working people. He never whips them on a week day,\r\nbecause it wastes working time, but makes Sunday a general flogging\r\nseason. He has two women where he has one man, and each woman is\r\nexpected to bear a child a year. If she doesn't, she is sold. They are\r\nmade to work in the field till the labor pains are on them; and they are\r\nallowed only two weeks' rest after confinement. Three of them have borne\r\nchildren in the woods this season. He keeps only one nurse for the\r\nfifteen children, and as soon as each child is five years old--the age\r\nat which it can be legally sold away from its mother--it is disposed of\r\nto the traders. In addition, three of these women are his own mistresses\r\nand they are expected to have children as fast as the others. He serves\r\ntheir children like the rest; that is, rears them to the age of five,\r\nand then sells them as he would so many hogs.'\r\n\r\n'My God!' I exclaimed, 'he's a monster.'\r\n\r\n'There are different opinions about that. Dawsey passes for a jovial\r\ngood fellow; keeps open house for his friends; spends money freely at\r\nthe elections, and two years ago 'got religion' at a camp meeting. He\r\nmerely regards his slaves as chattels, and manages his plantation in\r\nperhaps the only way that is profitable in an old section of country\r\nlike this.'\r\n\r\n'And how is it with you? How do you manage?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Leff _me_ tell, master Robert,' said the black, smiling. 'I knows all\r\nde 'ticulars 'bout dat.'\r\n\r\n'Well, go on,' said Preston, laughing, 'but don't be too hard on _me_.'\r\n\r\n'We hab,' continued the black, 'countin' me in, a hundred an' fifty-one\r\ndarkies, all in fam'lies--faders, mudders, children, and some on 'em\r\ngran'faders and gran'mudders,'most all born on de plantation, an' some\r\non 'em livin' on it fur forty, fifty, sixty, an' seventy yar. Out ob\r\ndese, we hab only forty-two full hands, 'case some ob de wimmin dat come\r\nin de ages fur full wuck am sickly, puny tings, only fit fur house wuck\r\nor nussin'. From de whole I gits equal to fifty-four full hands.\r\n'Cordin' to master Robert's direction, I gib 'em easy ten-hour tasks;\r\nbut suffin' or anoder turn up 'most ebery day, so dat 'bout half on 'em\r\ndon't do full wuck, an' I reckon dey don't make, on de whole, more'n\r\n'bout nine hour a day. So you see, Cunnel Dawsey, he hab sixty, an' he\r\nwuck em fifteen hour a day; we hab only fifty-four, an' we wuck 'em nine\r\nhour a day; an' 'cordin' to my 'rithmetic, dat would make de Cunnel turn\r\nout 'bout twice as much truck as we does.'\r\n\r\n'And you have twice as many mouths to feed as he,' I remarked; 'and the\r\nresult is he makes money, while you--'\r\n\r\n'Lose nigh onter two thousand a year, Mr. Kirke, an' hab done it ebery\r\nyar fur five yar, eber since master Robert come on to de plantation, an'\r\ngwo to workin' on human principles, as he calls 'em.'\r\n\r\nThis was said in so sad and regretful a tone, that, in spite of the\r\nserious manner of both the black and his master, I laughed heartily.\r\nWhen my merriment had somewhat subsided, I said:\r\n\r\n'Joe, what would you do to mend this state of affairs?'\r\n\r\n'It can't be mended if we stay in dis ole country, an' wuck 'cordin' to\r\nmaster Robert's notion.'\r\n\r\n'Then you mean to say you can't apply humane principles to slave labor,\r\nin an old district of country, and make money?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Preston, rising and pacing up and down in the small\r\nsemi-circle formed by the rosin barrels, 'that is what he means to say,\r\nand it is true.'\r\n\r\n'Then how do the majority of turpentine planters in this section make\r\nmoney? They _do_ make it, that is certain.'\r\n\r\n'By overworking their hands, as Dawsey does. All may not be as severe\r\nwith them as he is, but all overwork them, more or less,' replied\r\nPreston.\r\n\r\n'I don't know 'bout dat, master Robert, twelve and eben firteen hour a\r\nday neber hurt a prime hand, if he hab good feed.\r\n\r\n'Well, it is six o'clock, and supper must be in waiting,' said Preston,\r\ndrawing out his watch; 'we'll talk more on this subject to-night. Joe,\r\nbring the books up to the house this evening. Mr. Kirke has promised to\r\nlook into our affairs, and I shall need you.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, master Robert,' replied the black; and, mounting the horses,\r\nPreston and I rode off to the mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMrs. Preston and master Joe were on the piazza awaiting us, and in the\r\ndoorway we were met by the younger children. Preston lifted one of them\r\nupon his shoulder, and taking another in his arms, led the way to the\r\nsupper room. However disturbed might be my friend's relations with the\r\nouter world, all was peace by his cheerful fireside. No man was ever\r\nmore blessed in his home. His children were intelligent, loving, and\r\nobedient; his wife was one of those rare women--seen nowhere more often\r\nthan in the South--who, to a cultivated mind and polished manners, add\r\nthe more homely accomplishments of a good housewife. It is years since\r\nshe laid aside the weary cares of her plantation home, and entered on\r\nthe higher duties of another life; but her gentle words are still as\r\nfresh in my memory, her kindly image as warm in my heart, as on that\r\nautumn day, when she placed her hand in mine for the last time, and\r\nspoke the last 'God bless you' which was to fall on my ears from her\r\nlips on this side of the grave. She was a perfect woman--a faithful\r\nmistress, a loving wife, a devoted mother. Anticipating every want of\r\nher husband, cheerfully instructing her children, overseeing every\r\ndetail of her household, meting out the weekly allowance of the negroes,\r\nvisiting daily the cabins of the sick and the infirm, and with her own\r\nhand dispensing the soothing cordial or the healing medicine,--or, when\r\nall medicine failed, bending over the lowly bed of the dying, and\r\npointing him to the 'better home on high,'--she was a ministering\r\nangel--a joy and a blessing to all about her. She wore no costly silks,\r\nno diamonds on her fingers, or jewels in her hair; but she was arrayed\r\nin garments all rich and beautiful with human love. She knew\r\nnothing--cared nothing--about the right or the wrong of slavery; but\r\ncheerfully and prayerfully, never wearying and never doubting, she went\r\non in the lowly round of duties allotted her, leaning lovingly on the\r\narm of the GOOD ALL-FATHER, and looking steadfastly to HIM for guidance\r\nand support. And, truly, she had her reward. 'Her children rose up and\r\ncalled her blessed; her husband, also, and he praised her.'\r\n\r\nSupper was soon over, when my hostess rose and conducted me to the\r\nlibrary. That apartment was in an L, detached from the mansion, and\r\ncommunicating with it by a covered passage way. It was plainly\r\nfurnished, but had a cosy, homelike appearance. Its four walls were\r\nlined with books, some standing on end, some resting on their sides, and\r\nsome leaning negligently against each other; and over the massive centre\r\ntable were scattered open volumes, old newspapers, and unfinished\r\nmanuscripts, in most delightful confusion. A half dozen old-fashioned\r\nchairs straggled about the floor, as if they did not know exactly what\r\nto do with themselves, and a score of old worthies--their faces white as\r\nchalk, and their long hair and beards powdered with a whole generation\r\nof dust, looked complacently down from the top of the bookshelves. Dust\r\nwas on the table, on the chairs, on the floor, on the ceiling, and on\r\nthe musty old volumes ranged along the walls, and dust everywhere told\r\nunmistakably that no profane hand ever disturbed the dusty repose which\r\nreigned in the apartment.\r\n\r\nTwo or three oaken logs, supported on bright brass andirons--the only\r\nbright things in the room--were blazing cheerfully on the broad\r\nhearthstone; and drawing our chairs near, we sat down before them.\r\n\r\n'May I come in?' said master Joe, thrusting his head in at the\r\nhalf-closed doorway.\r\n\r\n'No, my son,' answered his father; 'Mr. Kirke and I are to talk over\r\nbusiness matters.'\r\n\r\n'Do let him come, Robert,' said Mrs. Preston; 'he is old enough to learn\r\nsomething of such affairs.'\r\n\r\nThe lad entered, and seating himself on a low stool by the side of his\r\nmother, and burying his head in her lap, was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\n'This room, Mr. Kirke,' said the lady, 'is sacred to Robert and the\r\ndust. I beg you will not think I have the care of it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh no, madam; it is plain that a _man_ has exclusive dominion here; but\r\nyour husband has been away from it for some time.'\r\n\r\n'That does not account for the dust; it hasn't been stirred for a\r\ntwelve-month;' and after a pause, she added, a thin moisture glistening\r\nin her eyes, 'I have not yet thanked you, sir, for saving Phyllis and\r\nthe children from the clutches of that wretched trader.'\r\n\r\n'No thanks are requisite, madam. It was a mere matter of business; we\r\nare in the practice of making advances to our consignors.'\r\n\r\n'Nevertheless we thank you, sir; Robert and I will ever be grateful for\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'Do not speak of it, madam; I would be glad to serve you to a much\r\ngreater extent.'\r\n\r\nThe lady made no reply, and a rather embarrassing silence followed for\r\nsome minutes, when I said:\r\n\r\n'Preston, Joe is a remarkable negro; I think I never met one so\r\nintelligent and well informed.'\r\n\r\n'He _is_ very intelligent,' he replied; 'he has fine natural abilities.'\r\n\r\n'It is a pity Nature gave him so dark a skin, and made him a--slave.'\r\n\r\n'Not a _pity_, Mr. Kirke,' rejoined Mrs. Preston; 'Nature, or rather\r\nGod, always puts us in our right places. Joseph is more useful where he\r\nis than he would be anywhere else.'\r\n\r\n'I understood him that he was raised on the plantation,' I added.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied my host; 'my grandfather bought his mother, who is a\r\nnative African, when she was a girl; she was a favorite house-servant,\r\nand Joe was born in a room over where we are sitting. This building was\r\nthen all there was of the mansion.'\r\n\r\n'And how did he pick up so much information?'\r\n\r\n'The old gentleman, who gave little heed to either law or gospel, taught\r\nthem both to read and write.' (Years after the date of this conversation\r\nI learned that Joe was the son of that lawless, graceless old\r\ngentleman.) 'And Joe, when a boy, read everything he could lay his hands\r\non. Since I brought my library here, he has devoured about half of the\r\nbooks in it. He devotes every night, from eight o'clock to twelve, to\r\nreading.'\r\n\r\n'I am surprised that with so much reading he uses so entirely the negro\r\ndialect.'\r\n\r\n'But he does not. In common conversation he expresses himself in it, for\r\nit is the dialect in which a black does his ordinary thinking; but let\r\nhim get upon an elevated subject, as he does frequently in his sermons,\r\nand you will hear words as strong, pure, and simple as any found in the\r\nBible, flow from him like a stream.'\r\n\r\n'Does he preach every Sunday?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I usually catechize the people in the morning, and he preaches in\r\nthe evening.'\r\n\r\n'But do you learn all your negroes to read?'\r\n\r\n'No, the law does not allow it. I teach them to repeat the catechism,\r\ntexts of Scripture, and passages from good books, and I explain these to\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n'And Joe is your overseer?'\r\n\r\n'Not exactly that. My father made him overseer about thirty years ago,\r\nbut the law requires a white man in that situation; and when I took\r\ncharge of the plantation, the neighbors made a clamor about my having a\r\nblack. The result was, I 'whipped the devil round the stump,' by hiring\r\na white distiller, and _calling_ him 'overseer.' I let Joe, however,\r\n'oversee' him, as you have seen to-day.'\r\n\r\nA rap came then at the door, and master Joe, springing up, ushered the\r\nsubject of our conversation into the room. He held his hat in his hand,\r\nand had under his arm a couple of account books.\r\n\r\n'This is Joseph the First,' said the lad, taking the black by the\r\ncoat-tail, and bowing gravely to me.\r\n\r\n'And you are Joseph the Second, eh?' I said, laughing.\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, he'm dat 'stinguished gemman,' replied the negro, stroking\r\naffectionately the lad's head; 'and he don't dishonor de name, sar. He'm\r\nde true blue, dyed in de wool.'\r\n\r\n'He was named for Joseph,' said the lady, smiling kindly on the black.\r\n'Bring up a chair, Joseph.'\r\n\r\n'Tank you, missus,' and the negro seated himself by the fire, between\r\nPreston and me.\r\n\r\n'You have brought the documents, I see, Joe; let me look at them,' I\r\nsaid, reaching out my hand for the books.\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, and dey'm all written up till a week back. I reckon _you_ kin\r\npick 'em out, Mr. Kirke, dough master Robert he say he don't understand\r\nmy way ob keepin' 'em.'\r\n\r\nI opened the books, and any man of business will appreciate my surprise\r\nto find them kept by 'double entry.' Cotton, corn, and turpentine had\r\neach its separate account, and at a glance I could see how much had been\r\nmade or lost by the production of each staple. The handwriting was plain\r\nand bold, and the general appearance of the ledger compared favorably\r\nwith that of a much larger one I knew of, which was the pride of an\r\nexperienced bookkeeper.\r\n\r\n'Why, Joe, I'm astonished,' I exclaimed with unaffected gratification;\r\n'you write like a schoolmaster.'\r\n\r\nA flush, which would have been a blush on a lighter skin, overspread the\r\nnegro's face, as he replied:\r\n\r\n'I don't hab practice 'nuff, Mr. Kirke, to write bery well.'\r\n\r\n'Practice!' said Preston, 'he has constant practice; he writes the love\r\nletters of all the darkies in the district.'\r\n\r\n'It am so, dat's a fac, sar', said Joe, a quiet humor twinkling in his\r\neye. 'One ob Cunnel Dawsey's folk came to me tother day--his wife had\r\nbeen sold down Souf, an' he wanted to say to har, dat dough ribers rose,\r\nand mountins run atween 'em, he'd neber hab nuffin to do wid no oder\r\n'ooman--so he come to me, and I wrote de letter; an' when I'd a put in\r\nall de ribers, an' de mountins, an' eber so many runs, an' thought I'd\r\ndone it right smart, I read it ober to him, but he say he sort o'\r\nreckoned it warnt quite done up 'pletely, not 'xactly 'cluded; an' he\r\n'sisted dat I muss 'sert a pose scrip, axin' her to ''scuse de bad\r\nwritin'.''\r\n\r\n'And you did it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sar, I done it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Joe, the important thing just now, is how much you owe. Give me a\r\nslip of paper, and let me put these balances together.'\r\n\r\n'I'se done dat, Mr. Kirke; here dey am,' and he handed me a correctly\r\ndrawn-up statement, showing Preston's exact liabilities. I glanced over\r\nit, compared it with the footings in the ledger, and said:\r\n\r\n'I see by this, Preston, that you owe seventeen hundred dollars,\r\nfloating debt; twelve hundred dollars, interest on your mortgage, and\r\nare overdrawn five hundred dollars on our house.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, so Joe makes it, and I reckon he's correct.'\r\n\r\n'But dar'm de six hunderd you 'cepted fur master Robert, de oder day, in\r\nNewbern--dat ain't counted in,' said Joe.\r\n\r\n'Well, all told, it's four thousand, besides the note I have given for\r\nPhyllis. What do you calculate on to pay it, Preston?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. How can we pay it, Joe?'\r\n\r\n'We moight sell de two stills, and some ob de hosses; I reckon dey'd be\r\n'nuff,' replied the black; 'but de raal trubble, master Robert, am\r\nwhat's cummin'; we'm gwine ahind ebery day, 'case we lose money on ebery\r\ncrop ob turpentine. Nuffin pay now but de corn and de cotton, and we\r\ndon't raise 'nuff ob dem to do no good.'\r\n\r\nI turned to the ledger, and found that it showed what the black said to\r\nbe true--corn and cotton had made a handsome profit, but turpentine had\r\n'paid a loss.'\r\n\r\n'That is because your trees are old, and now yield scarcely anything but\r\nscrape,'[1] I said.\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, and 'case dey am so thin like, sense we cleaned out de pore\r\nones, dat it take a hand long time to git 'round 'mong 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Why not drop turpentine, and cut shingles from the swamp? You've a\r\nfortune in those cypress trees.'\r\n\r\n'My negroes are not accustomed to swamp work--it would kill them,'\r\nreplied Preston.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Kirke,' said Joe,--'you'll take no 'fence, master Robert, if I says\r\ndis?'\r\n\r\n'No, go on,' said his master.\r\n\r\n'De ting am right in a nutshell, an' jess so clar as apple jack: we owes\r\na heap; we'se gittin' inter debt deeper an' deeper ebery yar; we lose\r\nmoney workin' de ole trees; we hain't got no new ones; an', dar's no use\r\nto talk,--master Robert _won't_ put de hands inter de swamp. What, den,\r\nshill we do?'\r\n\r\nAvoiding the darky's question, I said: 'I never before understood why\r\nslavery is so clamorous for new fields. I see now--it can draw support\r\nonly from the virgin soil. It exhausts an old country: like the locusts\r\nof Egypt, it blasts the very face of the earth!'\r\n\r\n'That is true,' replied Preston; 'but Joe has stated the case correctly,\r\n_What shall we do?_'\r\n\r\n'One of two things. Sell your plantation and negroes, or take your hands\r\nto a new section, where you can raise virgin turpentine.'[2]\r\n\r\n'I cannot sell my negroes--they were all raised with me; and the\r\nplantation--it was my ancestors', over a hundred years ago. I would move\r\nthe hands to a new section, but I have not the means to buy land.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, dar's de rub, as Shakspeare say,' said Joe, with a pleasant humor,\r\nintended, I thought, to cheer his master, whose face was clouding over\r\nwith grave thought; 'dat's de ting dat spile de 'gestion ob de king; and\r\nin him sleep, such dreams do come ob suffin' better'n dis, some\r\nundiscobered country, whar de virgin trees weep tears so white as\r\ncrystal, and turn to gole de moment dey'm barrled up, dat--'\r\n\r\n'Come, Joe, that'll do,' said his master, laughing; 'don't give us any\r\nmore, or you'll murder _us_, as well as Shakspeare.'\r\n\r\n'You don't 'preciate dat great man, master Robert,' rejoined Joe, also\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n'No, I don't--not just now.'\r\n\r\n'If you could satisfy your outside creditors that things were likely to\r\ngo better with you in future, could you put off the payment of the three\r\nthousand dollars for a time?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'I reckon I could--nearly all of it,' replied Preston.\r\n\r\n'Well, then, I'll make you a proposition. Buy ten thousand acres on the\r\nline of the Manchester railroad. It is finished to Whitesville, and you\r\ncan buy land within twenty miles of that station, at seventy-five cents\r\nan acre. We'll advance the twenty per cent. you'll have to pay down, and\r\nfive hundred dollars more to start you there, and hold the deed of the\r\nland to secure us. Ship your produce to us, and agree to forfeit the\r\nland, if, at the end of three years, you have not paid all the original\r\nadvance. Move your stills, and your able-bodied men and women there,\r\nleaving the old and the young negroes here to raise corn and cotton.\r\n_Hire_ fifty more prime hands, and put Joe over the whole, with\r\nunlimited power to work them to death if he pleases.'\r\n\r\nPreston leaned his head on his hand, as if bewildered. He seemed not to\r\nunderstand me, but Joe's face lighted as if a stream of electricity were\r\nplaying under his dark skin. Mrs. Preston was the first to speak. Rising\r\nand taking my hand, she said: 'Robert will do it, Mr. Kirke; and how can\r\nwe ever thank you enough for your generous--your _noble_ conduct toward\r\nus? You have taken a weary load off our hearts.'\r\n\r\n'It is a simple business transaction, madam; I expect to make money by\r\nit. I insist on your husband's consigning his produce to us, and I shall\r\nrequire the forfeit of the land and the improvements, if he does not pay\r\nour advances within three years.'\r\n\r\n'We kin pay 'em in _one_ year, an' you knows it, sar!' exclaimed Joe,\r\nspringing to his feet, and almost dancing around the room. 'Come, master\r\nRobert, look up, an' tell 'im we'll do it, for ole Joe'll make de chips\r\nfly as you neber seed 'em fly afore.'\r\n\r\nPreston looked up, and a tear rolled down his face, as he said, 'I thank\r\nyou, my friend. I need not say more.'\r\n\r\n'You need not say _that_; only buy the land, and make Joe autocrat of\r\nthe new plantation, and your bacon is cured.'\r\n\r\n'Joe'll show you how bacon am cured, Mr. Kirke, an' he'll name his fuss\r\nboy af'er you--_shore_!' shouted the black, grinning all over.\r\n\r\n'He can safely promise that,' said the lady, laughing through her tears;\r\n'for Aggy is fifty, and never had a child.'\r\n\r\nA half-hour's conversation over the details of the proposed arrangement\r\nfollowed; then Joe rose, and taking the account books under his arm,\r\nbade us 'good evenin'.' As he was leaving the room, I asked, 'Do you\r\npreach to-morrow?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, an' I'se gwine home to study ober de sermon. You'll come dar,\r\nsar? You won't har no raal preachin', 'less master Robert feel de\r\nsperrit move, fur de Lord don't gib de black man de tongue he gib de\r\nwhite.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not sure of that; but I'll be there. Good night.'\r\n\r\n'Good night, sar, an' de Lord bless you.'\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, I said to Preston: 'You have admitted me to your\r\nconfidence, my friend, and asked my advice; therefore, I think you will\r\npardon me, if I make you a few business suggestions.'\r\n\r\n'Most certainly, and I shall be guided by what you say.'\r\n\r\n'With a hundred hands in those thick woods, Joe will turn out a vast\r\namount of produce. His ambition is excited with the idea of being his\r\nown master, and he will coin money for you; but you need to be prudent.\r\nYou owe a mortgage of twenty thousand dollars--and mortgage debts are\r\nthe worst in the world. Your plantation and negroes may be worth three\r\ntimes the amount, but they are in jeopardy so long as it exists. If it\r\nwere called in on you suddenly, you couldn't pay it--your property would\r\nbe sacrificed--everything might be lost. Now, I would suggest that you\r\nsell, at once, your three hundred acres of swamp land, all your surplus\r\nlive stock and materials, and appropriate the proceeds to paying your\r\nfloating debt, and reducing the mortgage.'\r\n\r\n'And we might reduce our family expenses, Robert,' said his wife; 'we\r\nhave too many house-servants. We could hire out five or six of them in\r\nNewbern. And Joseph's schooling costs us five hundred dollars a year; he\r\nmight come home--_I_ could teach him.'\r\n\r\n'You would take too much on yourself, Lucy,' replied her husband. 'You\r\nare not strong, and you can't spare a single servant.'\r\n\r\n'How many have you?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Nine,' said Preston.\r\n\r\n'For a family of two adults and three children?'\r\n\r\n'It strikes you as too many, Mr. Kirke,' said the lady, 'and it _is_. It\r\nis our Southern way; but every additional servant makes additional work\r\nfor the mistress.'\r\n\r\n'I think you are right, madam,' I replied; 'a Northern lady that you\r\nknow of, takes care of me, Frank, the two young children, and a large\r\nhouse, with only two servants and an errand boy; and she never has\r\nanything to do after two o'clock in the day.'\r\n\r\n'But you have the Irish; they are better house-servants than our blacks;\r\nand you can discharge them if they won't work,' said Preston.\r\n\r\n'I would rather have Phyllis than any servant I ever saw at the North.\r\nWith her, the cook, and one more, I will promise to get on beautifully,'\r\nremarked his wife.\r\n\r\nPreston gave her a look of indescribable tenderness and affection. What\r\nthe negro trader had said to me, gave me a key to the thoughts that were\r\npassing in his mind. His wife's trust in him was so great, that she was\r\nwilling to again admit into her family the woman who had made him\r\nforget, through long years, the promises he made her in their youth!\r\nTruly, the angel of perfect love and forgiveness makes its earthly home\r\nin the breast of woman.\r\n\r\nPreston's voice quivered as he replied: 'I--I appreciate what you\r\nsay--Lucy. Do as you think best.'\r\n\r\n'But, madam,' I said, 'I think you are really taking too much on\r\nyourself--the care of the children will be a great tax on your\r\nstrength. Would it not be better to employ a governess to instruct them?\r\nWhat is now expended on Joe would pay a competent person.'\r\n\r\n'What do you say to that, Joe?' asked his father; 'would you like to\r\ncome home, and have a woman teacher?'\r\n\r\n'I'd like to do what mother wants me to,' said the lad, putting his arms\r\nabout her neck, and kissing her.\r\n\r\n'You're a good boy, Joseph,' said his mother.\r\n\r\n'But, you'll let me keep the pony, won't you, father?' said the lad.\r\n\r\n'Yes, my son, and if you learn well, you shall go with uncle James when\r\nyou're fifteen.'\r\n\r\nShortly afterward we separated for the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nOn a gentle knoll, a few hundred yards from the negro quarters, and in\r\nthe midst of a grove of pines, whose soft brown tassels covered the\r\nground all around it, stood the negro meetinghouse. It was built of\r\nunhewn logs, its crevices chinked with clay, and was large enough to\r\nseat about two hundred persons. Though its exterior resembled a\r\nbackwoods barn, its interior had a neat and tasteful appearance.\r\nEvergreen boughs hid its rough beams and bare shingled roof, and long\r\nwreaths of pine leaves hung in graceful festoons from its naked walls\r\nand narrow windows. On the two sides of a wide aisle, which served to\r\nseparate the sheep on the right hand from the goats on the left, were\r\nlong rows of benches, with hard board bottoms, and rough open backs, and\r\nbeyond them, divided from the rest of the interior by a rustic railing,\r\nwas the 'family pew,' an enclosure about twelve feet square, neatly\r\ncarpeted, and furnished with half a dozen arm chairs. Opposite to this\r\nwas a platform elevated three steps from the floor, and on it stood a\r\nrustic settee, a large easy chair, and a modest desk covered with green\r\nbaize, and decorated with small sprigs of evergreen. On this desk rested\r\na large Bible.\r\n\r\nThe enormous seashell which served as a bell to this 'house of prayer,'\r\nwas sending its last blast in long echoes through the old trees, when,\r\nwith Mrs. Preston and the children, I elbowed an opening through the\r\nthick group of grinning Africans that blocked the doorway, and 'worked a\r\npassage' down the crowded aisle to the family enclosure. Seating myself\r\nin one of its cane-bottomed seats, I glanced around on the assemblage.\r\nSuch a gathering of woolly heads I had never seen. Every plantation\r\nwithin a circuit of five miles had sent in a representation, till the\r\nbenches, the aisle, the small area around the pulpit, and the open space\r\nnear the doorway, were all densely packed. On the left, the men, in\r\ngaudy cravats and many-colored waistcoats, were chatting merrily\r\ntogether, and enjoying themselves as heartily as a parcel of Yankees at\r\na clambake; and on the right, the women, in red and yellow turbans, and\r\nflaming shawls and neckerchiefs, were bobbing about and flaunting their\r\ncolors, like so many dolphins sporting in the sunshine. Preston was\r\nseated in the lone chair at the back of the pulpit, and Boss Joe and\r\nBlack Jack occupied the settee near him. The latter shortly rose to open\r\nthe services, and, in a moment, a deep silence fell on the noisy\r\nmultitude. The old preacher had carefully combed his thin wool into a\r\npyramid on the top of his head, and he looked, dressed in glossy black\r\npants, longtailed blue coat, ruffled shirt, and high shirt collar, like\r\na stuffed specimen at an exhibition of wax figures. Stepping rather\r\nunsteadily to the front of the platform, he flourished his red cotton\r\nbandanna, and spreading his huge claws over the large Bible, said:\r\n\r\n'Dear bred'rin, leff us begin de worship ob de Lord by singin':\r\n\r\n   'From all dat dwell below de skies\r\n   Leff de Creator's praise arise.''\r\n\r\nA half dozen darky fiddlers at the left of the pulpit tuned their\r\nstrings, and then the whole assemblage rose and burst into that grand\r\nold hymn. As its last echoes were dying away, Joe got up, and opening\r\nthe large Bible, read, in a clear, mellow voice, a portion of the one\r\nhundred and nineteenth Psalm. When he had concluded, the old darky again\r\ncame forward.\r\n\r\nGazing complacently around on the audience for a moment, he drawled out:\r\n'My bred'rin, leff us raise our hearts to de Lord.' The whole\r\ncongregation then kneeled, and Jack, closing his eyes, clenching his\r\nhands together, and throwing his head back, until his nose came nearly\r\non a line with the roof of the building, 'lifted up his voice' and\r\nprayed.\r\n\r\nAfter the fashion of very many white preachers, he began by telling the\r\nLord all about Himself; all He had ever done, and all He is going to do;\r\nhow long He had lived, and how long He is going to live; how great He\r\nis--'taller dan de mountin's, and bigger dan de seas.' How He made the\r\nworld in six days, and then, 'gittin' tired, rested on de sevenfh;' How\r\nHe formed man out of the dust of the ground, and then out of his rib\r\nformed woman; how the woman tempted the man, and he fell, and how woman\r\nhas 'raised Cain' on the earth ever since. How He sent the flood, and\r\nhow Noah builded the ark; how Noah axed all the wild 'critters' into it,\r\nand how they all came in two by two, and how Noah and the wild beasts\r\nlay down lovingly together, till the 'wet spell' was over. How He chose\r\nthe Jews--a meaner race than the 'pore whites'--to be his peculiar\r\npeople; and how that proves His boundless love and unlimited goodness;\r\n'fur no oder man in all creashun would hab taken _dem_ folks up, no\r\nhow.' How Moses, when he came down from the Mount, 'stumbled and broke\r\nde law; and how 'ebery one of us dat hab come inter de worle sense, hab\r\nstumbled and broke de law, 'case he did,' How Noah, though he was a\r\nwhite man, and had a white wife, begat a black son; and how that black\r\nson was a great sinner, and how all his descendants have taken after\r\nhim, and been mighty big sinners ever since.\r\n\r\nThen he described the sinners, particularly the black sinners present;\r\nand if half of what he said was true, every one of them deserved to be\r\nsold 'down Soufh,' and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of\r\nhis days.\r\n\r\nThe prayer was a strange mixture of absurdity, presumption, and\r\nprofanity, and I felt relieved to hear his long 'amen,' and to see Joe\r\nrise and again approach the pulpit.\r\n\r\nRequesting some one present to raise a few of the windows (I took\r\noccasion, afterward, to thank him for that very considerate thought),\r\nJoe opened the Bible, and said: 'My friends, I am gwine to talk ter you\r\nfrom de tex, 'An' dey drew an' lifted up Joseph out ob de pit, an' sold\r\nJoseph to the Ishmaelites fur twenty pieces ob silver, an' dey brought\r\nJoseph inter Egypt.'\r\n\r\n'You all knows,' he continued, 'de story ob Joseph an' his bred'rin; how\r\ndey wus raised up by dar fader Jacob in a wile country, whar dar warn't\r\nno schools, an' no 'telligence, an' no larnin'; and how his fader lub'd\r\nJoseph more dan all ob his bred'rin, an' make fur him a coat ob many\r\ncolors. But p'raps you don't know dat de Lord lub Joseph a great sight\r\nbetter'n his fader did, an' 'case He lub him so, dat He hardened de\r\nhearts ob his bred'rin agin him, till dey sole him to de Ishmaelites--de\r\nslavetraders ob dem days, to be taken down inter Egypt. An' p'raps you\r\ndon't know dat Egypt wus a great country, whar dar wus schools, an'\r\nchurches, an' great libraries ob books, an' all manner ob sciences; an'\r\ndat Joseph wus made de lord ob all dat country, an' dat finarly he got\r\nhis fader, an' his bred'rin, an' dar wifes, an' all dar little ones, to\r\ncome down dar, an' stay; whar, dough de tasks war sometimes hard, an'\r\ndey hed to 'arn dar bred by de sweat ob dar brow, dey could git\r\nknowledge an' larnin'. An' p'raps, too, you don't know dat de chil'ren\r\nob Israel, who war de chil'ren ob Joseph an' his bred'rin, when dey'd\r\nstaid down dar in Egypt de 'pointed time, war taken by de Lord inter de\r\nlan' ob Canaan, which was a lan' 'flowin' wid milk and honey;' and dat\r\ndey war gib'n dat lan' far dar possession. Now, my friends,' and he\r\npaused and looked around on the congregation, 'de story ob Joseph am de\r\nstory ob de brack man; _he_ hab been taken out ob de pit; _he_ hab been\r\nsole fur twenty pieces ob silver; _he_ hab been brought inter Egypt,\r\nan', bless de Lord, _he_ am bound fur de lan' ob Canaan.\r\n\r\n'He hab been taken out ob de pit. A pit, my friends, am a dark place,\r\nwhar de sun neber shine, an' de light neber come; an' Africa, de country\r\nwhar our faders an' our gran'faders come from--am a pit; fur de darkness\r\ncobers dat lan', an' gross darkness de people dareof. Dey hab no\r\ncloes--dey lib in cabins made ob clay, an' in holes in de groun'--dey\r\nkill an' eat one anoder, an' dey'm allers at war wid one anoder. But de\r\nwhite man he gwoe dar, an' he buy 'em fur twenty pieces ob\r\nsilver--dat's' zactly de price--twenty silver dollars--dey pay dat fur\r\n'em up ter dis day--dem pore, ign'rant folks won't take nuffin' but\r\nsilver. Well, de white man buy 'em, and he fotch 'em to dis country,\r\nwhich am like de lan' ob Egypt, full ob schools, ob churches, ob\r\nlarnin,' an' ob all manner ob good tings. Shore, we hab to wuck hard\r\nhar; some ob us hab to bear heaby burdens, an' to make bricks w'en dey\r\ngib us no straw to make 'em wid; but we am in de lan' ob Egypt, whar we\r\nhab knowledge ob de Lord; whar de gospil am preach to us, an' whar we\r\nkin fine out de rode to de lan' ob Canaan. (To be shore, we karn't all\r\nlarn out ob de books; but book larnin' neber make a man, no how.) Yas,\r\nmy friends, yere we kin fine out de road to de lan' ob Canaan; an' do ye\r\nknow what dat lan' ob Canaan, dat'm waitin' fur de brack man, am? Do ye\r\n'spose it am a lan' whar de days am hot, an' de nights am cole; whar\r\nwe'll hoe de cotton, an' gader de turpentine, an' cut de shingles in de\r\nswamp? whar we'll wuck till we drop down; whar we'll hunger an' furst?\r\nwhar de fever will burn in our veins, an' de nager will rattle our bones\r\nas de corn am rattled in de hopper? No, my friends, 'tain't no lan' like\r\ndat! It am de habitation on high, de city builded ob de Lord, de\r\neberlasting kingdom founded by de Eternal God, who made heaben an'\r\n'arth, de sea, an' all dat in dem is! Oh, tink ob dat, my friends, an'\r\nhab courage! Tink ob dat when you'm a faint an' a weary, an' leff you'\r\nhearts be glad, an' you' souls rejoice in hope. Fur dat lan' ain't\r\n'spressly fur de white man--it am fur de brack man, too; an' ebery one\r\nob us, eben de brackest, kin git to it ef we'll jess foller der road--ef\r\nwe'll jess do our duty, bear meekly our burdens, an' lean humbly on de\r\narm ob de Lord. I knows it am so, my friends. I _knows_ it am so, fur de\r\noder night, when de deep sleep fell upon me, I dreamed a dream. I fought\r\ndar come to my cabin, an' stood aside ob my bed, a great white angel,\r\nwid feet dat touch de 'arth, but wid head dat reach unto de heabens. He\r\nwore raiment shinin' like silver, an' on his head wus a girdle ob stars.\r\nHis face wus dazzlin' as de sun, an' his eyes war like flamin' fire. He\r\nlook at me, an' he say: 'Joseph, come up hither!' He reach out his hand\r\nan' he lift me up--above de 'arth--above de clouds--above de stars--'way\r\nup to de high heabens, whar am de sperrits ob just men made perfect, who\r\nhab been redeemed from among men, who hab gone fru great tribulation,\r\nwhose garments hab been washed clean in de blood ob de Lamb! 'Dis,' he\r\nsay, 'am de city ob de livin' God, de heabenly Jerusalem, whose\r\nfoundations am saffomires, whose walls am silver, whose streets am gold,\r\nwhose houses am jewels an' all precious stones! Here de sun neber sets.\r\nHere de storm an' de hurricane neber come, an' here, Joseph, am a\r\ndwellin' prepared fur you--'here, ef you'm faithful an' 'bedient, you\r\nshill come when you' wuck on de 'arth am ober!'\r\n\r\nThe speaker had been gradually warming with his subject till he uttered\r\nthis last sentence, when his voice trembled, his face glowed, and his\r\nupturned eye seemed gazing on the ineffable glories of the land he was\r\ndescribing. A stillness like that of death fell on the assemblage, and\r\nthe simple blacks, hanging breathlessly on his words, looked up to where\r\nJoe's hand was pointing, as if they too had caught the vision on which\r\nhis eyes were feasting. In a moment, he continued:\r\n\r\n'I looked round, an' I saw dat beautiful city; I breafed its air; I\r\nwalked its streets; I hard its music--de neber endin' song which its\r\ncountless people send up to de throne ob de Great Father; an' I say to\r\nde angel: 'Do brack folks lib yere? Kin _dey_ come to dis beautiful\r\ncountry?' an' he say: You shill see.' Den he lead me fru dose shinin'\r\nstreets, out inter de open fiel's whar war pleasant pastures, greener\r\ndan any on de 'arth, an' still waters, dat sparkle in de sun, jess like\r\nmissus' diamonds in de light ob de fire.' (I did not know that Mrs.\r\nPreston wore diamonds--she certainly had not worn them in my presence.)\r\n'He lead me out till we come to a great woods, whar fount'ins war\r\nplayin', an' birds war singin', an' flowers war growin', an' de air wus\r\nfull of fragrance; an' dar I seed a great crowd ob people gadered\r\ntogeder, a listenin' to one dat wus a talkin' to 'em. Dar wus Ab'ram,\r\nan' Isaac, an' Jacob,--dar wus Moses, an' Joseph, au' Samuel--dar wus\r\nDavid, an' Solomon, an' de prophets--dar wus Paul, an' John, an'\r\nPeter,--dar wus 'most all de great an' good men who hab libed in de\r\nworle; an' dar too, right aside ob de one dat wus speakin', wus de\r\nblessed Saviour, wid de woun' in his side, an' de print ob de nails in\r\nhis hands. An' who do you tink wus a talkin' dar, to all dem great\r\npeople? Who do you tink wus fought good 'nuff to stan' by de side ob de\r\nblessed Saviour? It wus a brack man! It wus a brack man, who, down yere\r\nhad been ole, an' lame, an' blind, an' ob no account--so no account he\r\nwouldn't sell fur nuffin'. He wus tellin' dem great folks ob de great\r\nlub ob de Lord to him, an' dar tears rolled down as dey hard him. He\r\ntole 'em how he use to lib in Car'lina--how he wus a slave; how he'd\r\n'most nuffin' to eat; how he wus wucked in de swamp; how, 'fore de sun\r\nrose, an' 'way inter de night, he use to stan' in de mud an' de water,\r\ntill his bones war sore, his heart wus weary, his soul wus faint. How\r\nhis massa flog him, 'cause he couldn't wuck no more, till de blood run\r\ndown his back, an' it wus a ridged like de ploughed groun'. How his wife\r\nwus whipped to death afore his bery eyes; how his chil'ren--all 'cept\r\none--war sole 'way from him; how dat one 'bused him, an' flogged him,\r\nan' tormented him, till he wus jess ready to die. How, when his hair wus\r\nwhite, his body wus bent, his strength wus gone, an' he was ole, an'\r\nlame, an' blind, his massa drove him 'way, and make him shirk fur\r\nhimseff. How he beg in de roads; how he sleep in de woods; in de cole\r\nan' de rain, till a good gemman take him in, gib him a bed, tend to his\r\nwants, an' pray ober him when he die. He tole 'em all dat; but he say\r\ndat fru it all, he hab peace; fru it all, de Lord wus good to him; fru\r\nit all, he felt His lub in his heart; fru it all, de blessed Redeemer\r\nwus wid him; fru it all, he knowed dat mercy an' salvation am in de\r\nheabens! An' DEY AM DAR! Dey took him 'way, 'way from de 'arth; 'way\r\nfrom his suffrin's an' his sorrers down yere, to joy, an' peace, an'\r\nrest up dar. Up dar, whar all great an' good men call him brudder--whar\r\nde Lord Jehobah call him son, an' whar de blessed Saviour will leff him\r\nstan' at his right hand, foreber and eber. An' he, my friends, wus a\r\nBRACK MAN! An' who do you 'spose he wus? Who do you 'spose he wus?'\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment as he repeated the question, and then, in a slow,\r\nimpressive manner, continued:\r\n\r\n'It wus ole Cale--Cunnel Dawsey's Cale; an' dat good gemman dat take him\r\nin and pray ober him when he die--wus _my_ master--yas, bless de Lord,\r\nhe wus MY master!'\r\n\r\nAs Joe uttered these last words, Preston bowed his head, his wife sobbed\r\naloud, and the black people gave out a low cry, as sad as the wail which\r\ntheir own mourners breathe over the dead. Fixing his eyes on a tall,\r\nstalwart negro in the audience, the preacher continued:\r\n\r\n'An' he wus _you_' fader, Jake! You fader, who, when he wus down yere,\r\nyou 'bused, an' persecuted, an' treated like a dog, but who up dar am\r\nfought worthy to stand at de Saviour's right hand! I _knows_ it wus him,\r\nfur I seed him, I talked wid him, an' he gabe me suffin' to tell you.\r\nStand up now, an' yere what he hab to say.'\r\n\r\nThe black man's face assumed a dogged expression; he moved uneasily on\r\nhis seat, but showed no inclination to rise. In a firm, imperious tone,\r\nJoe again called out to him:\r\n\r\n'Stand up, I say! Folks like you' fader am now, don't talk to sech as\r\nyou when dey'm sittin' down: stand up, or I'll gib you what Cunnel\r\nDawsey neber gabe you in all you' life.'\r\n\r\nThe negro reluctantly rose. Every eye was fixed upon him as Joe\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n'He ax me to say to you, Jake, dat he lubs you--lubs you bery much--dat\r\nhe fully an' freely furgibs you fur all de wrong you eber done him; fur\r\nall de tears an' de sorrer you eber cause him. And he say to me: 'Tell\r\nJake dat I'se been down dar an' seed him. I'se seed how he shirk his\r\nwuck; how he 'buse his wife an' chil'ren; how he hate his massa, an'\r\nmean to kill him--(dough his massa am hard on him, 'tain't no 'scuse fur\r\ndat). How he swar, an' lie, an' steal, an' teach all de oder brack folks\r\nto do de same. How he'm no fought ob his soul; no fought ob dyin'; no\r\nfought ob whar he'm gwine when de Lord's patience am clean worn out wid\r\nhim. Tell him dat ef he gwo on dis way, he'll neber see his ole fader no\r\nmore; neber see his ole mudder, an' his little brudders, who am up yere,\r\ntoo, no more; neber come to dis fine country, but be shet out inter\r\nouter darkness, whar am weepin' an' wailin' an' knashin' ob teeth. Oh!\r\ntell him dis, an 'treat him, by all his fader's keer fur him when he wus\r\na chile; by all his lub fur him now; by all de goodness ob de Lord, who\r\nhab borne wid him fru all dese long years, to turn round--to turn round,\r\nNOW, an' sot his face towards dis blessed country, whar he kin hab joy\r\nforeber! Tell him, too, dat ef he'll do dis, dat his ole fader'll leab\r\nhis happy home an' come down dar an' holp him; holp him at his wuck;\r\nholp him to bar ebery load; gib him strength when he'm weak; hole up his\r\nfeet when he'm weary; watch ober him day and night, all de time, till\r\nhe'm ready to come up yere, an' lib wid de Saviour foreber! Tell him--'\r\n\r\nJoe paused, for a wild cry echoed through the building, and the negro\r\nfell in strong convulsions to the floor.\r\n\r\nA scene of indescribable excitement and confusion followed, during which\r\nthe black was carried out, and, more dead than alive, laid upon the\r\nground. When quiet was somewhat restored, Preston made a short and\r\nfeeling prayer, and then, after giving out a hymn, he dismissed the\r\ncongregation with the usual benediction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'Scrape' is the turpentine gathered from the face of the\r\npine. On old trees, the yearly incision is made high above the boxes,\r\nand the sap, in flowing down, passes over and adheres to the previously\r\nscarified surface. It is thus exposed to the sun, which evaporates the\r\nmore volatile and valuable portion, and leaves only the hard, which,\r\nwhen manufactured, is mostly rosin. 'Scrape' turpentine is only about\r\nhalf as valuable as 'dip.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Virgin\" Turpentine is twice as valuable as \"Dip.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sturdy oak which is not prostrated by the storm that assails it is\r\nmade thereby to take deeper hold, and to draw the sustenance for a\r\nlarger growth from the torn and loosened soil into which it has\r\nopportunity to thrust new roots and tendrils. Reinvigorated by the\r\nresisted violence, its branches shoot upward to the skies and extend\r\nthemselves laterally with majestic breadth. It gradually gains strength\r\nand becomes so firmly rooted in its place that it bids defiance to the\r\nrepeated tempests vainly striving to overthrow it, and stands for\r\ncenturies, sublime in its unconquerable might and proud endurance. Our\r\nnoble Union, fiercely assailed in its early maturity, before its\r\nstrength has been fully developed, now bends before the hurricane of\r\ncivil war, swaying to and fro with fearful and threatening movements at\r\nevery paroxysm of the tremendous blast. We look on with intense agony of\r\nsuspense, to see whether it will stand the terrible ordeal, and outlive\r\nthe unexampled convulsion of social elements in which its strength and\r\nendurance have been so sorely tested. Instinctively we know that if it\r\nsurvive the present momentous crisis, successfully resisting the attack\r\nof the enemy which assails it so furiously, its foundations will be\r\nimmensely strengthened, and its power of resistance in future dangers\r\nwill be indefinitely augmented. Prolonged and permanent existence, with\r\nassured security and repose, will be the best and most indisputable\r\nresult of its triumph. Though shaken and torn by the deadly assault, and\r\nto a certain extent deprived of its usual resources, in the very effort\r\nof resistance it will have put forth new connections, which returning\r\npeace will multiply and strengthen. The immense demand on its energy and\r\nenterprise will have aroused all its slumbering capacities and\r\nstimulated them to the highest point of exertion. Under the necessity of\r\nself-preservation, the nation will have been fully awakened to a sense\r\nof its gigantic power, which, when employed in the benign pursuits of\r\npeace, will be sufficient speedily to restore its prosperity to even\r\nmore than former splendor. The resources of our broad domain are so\r\nunbounded, and the courage and persistence of our people so indomitable,\r\nthat even the sacrifices and losses of so great a war will make no\r\nserious impression on the destined career of this youthful and growing\r\nnation. So long as the vigor and elasticity of the popular force is not\r\nabsolutely overpowered and suppressed, the reaction will only be so much\r\nthe stronger for all the mighty pressure which has been placed upon it.\r\nReturning strength, so invigorated and redoubled by repose, will enable\r\nthe people to bear the burden patiently, and within a comparatively\r\nbrief period to throw it off entirely; and then they will bound forward\r\nwith renewed energy in that race of unexampled progress which has been\r\nsadly interrupted, but not by any means wholly arrested.\r\n\r\nIf peace had continued, and especially if no civil war had occurred to\r\ndesolate our country, the labors of the population would have been\r\ndirected chiefly to the increase of wealth, and to the improvement which\r\nalways accompanies material prosperity. It would be a monstrous error to\r\nsay that the interruption of these occupations has not been a calamity\r\nof the most serious character. Yet is it not altogether unmixed with\r\ngood. Indeed, it is by no means certain that, in the circumstances\r\nwhich gave rise to the war, there was not an actual necessity, of a\r\nmoral nature, which made it on the whole advantageous to arouse the\r\nnation to this gigantic strife, and thus to exchange its ordinary\r\nstruggle for wealth into a combat for a momentous principle. Is it\r\nquestionable whether, in every case, the establishment of such a\r\nprinciple is not the most important of all objects, and whether every\r\nother pursuit and occupation ought not to be made secondary to it? In\r\nthe sacrifices and sufferings which a nation undergoes for the sake of\r\nasserting an important moral or political truth, there is always a\r\nwholesome virtue that in some measure redeems the brutality and violence\r\nwhich are the inseparable accompaniments of all wars, and which\r\npeculiarly characterize the history of civil wars, in every age and\r\ncountry. It is not merely the elevated and unselfish sentiment of\r\npatriotism, as known in former ages, and expressed in the noble\r\nsentiment, _dulce et decorum est pro patria mori_, which, engenders\r\nlofty impulses and nourishes the rugged virtues of the soldier in the\r\nheart; but the still higher sentiment of love for humanity and universal\r\nfreedom--a sentiment wholly unknown in what are called the heroic\r\nages--sanctifies the labors, the wounds, and the glorious death of the\r\nmartyrs who struggle and fall in such a contest. Men have often fought\r\nand willingly died in the cause of their country, regardless of the\r\nmerits of the controversy between the opposing parties. There is a\r\ncertain manliness and devotion to others in this species of patriotism,\r\nwhich commands respect and admiration; and this feeling of approbation\r\nrises still higher when the cause of the nation is undeniably just, and\r\nthe self-sacrificing patriot is giving his life for the purchase of\r\nliberty to his country. But the highest and noblest of all exhibitions\r\nis that in which the sacrifice is made for the good of the race--for\r\nprinciples in which all men are alike interested, and in which the\r\nmartyr can claim no peculiar advantage to himself or to his own branch\r\nof the human family. The nation which accepts war for such a cause, and\r\nwages it with all her means and energies, exhibits a moral grandeur\r\nwhich, in spite of misfortune, has a saving power, capable of overcoming\r\nand compensating all calamities, of whatever nature and extent. That\r\nnation cannot be overthrown--not unless the laws of the Most High\r\nhimself can be subverted, and the right be made permanently to succumb\r\nto the wrong. Let it be understood, however, that this assertion is made\r\nonly with reference to wars which are essentially defensive; for no\r\nnation has the right to propagate even the best and noblest principles\r\nby the power of the sword. In our case, it is true, other motives concur\r\nin moving the nation to this tremendous struggle. Not merely the rights\r\nand interests of an inferior, degraded, and suffering race appeal to our\r\nhumanity; but the unity and greatness of our country, its influence\r\nabroad, and its success and prosperity at home, are all involved. It is\r\none of many instances in which the best and highest impulses of our\r\nnature are reenforced by the dictates of the noblest and most elevated\r\nof human interests--the interests of a nation, of a continent, yea, of\r\nthe world itself; for our gates are still open to the ingress of our\r\nbrothers from abroad, and our immense and fertile domain, as well as our\r\npriceless institutions, are freely offered to their participation.\r\n\r\nBut, aside from the principles involved in the war, there are results of\r\nan interesting character springing from it, which are well worthy the\r\nattention of the statesman and the patriot. Two very opposite effects\r\nare produced on the minds of the men engaged in such a contest as this,\r\nor, indeed, in any contest of arms whatever, when it assumes the\r\nproportions of a regular war. The volunteering of our young men of all\r\nclasses, in numbers so immense, is an extraordinary phenomenon. These\r\nsoldiers by choice, many of them educated and intelligent, and impelled\r\nby deliberate considerations of principle, willingly undergo the hard\r\nlabor of military training, of marches and campaigns, and the still more\r\ntrying inactivity of life in camps and fortresses, in new and unfriendly\r\nregions and climates. They fearlessly face death in every ghastly form,\r\non the battle field, by exposure in all seasons, by physical exhaustion,\r\nand by the most dreadful contagious diseases. They devote themselves\r\nunreservedly to the great cause, and in doing so exhibit the noblest\r\nspirit of self-sacrifice, and that on the grandest scale presented in\r\nhistory. Fortitude and courage, contempt of the most appalling dangers,\r\ndisregard of suffering and privation, wounds, mutilation, and lingering\r\ndeath--these are the habits of soul which our citizen soldiers\r\ncultivate, and which tend to strengthen and harden the character, and to\r\ngive it great moral force. The great qualities thus nurtured in the\r\nbosom of the multitudes destined soon to return to peaceful life will\r\nassuredly make a powerful impression on the whole society, which must be\r\nthoroughly pervaded with the manly virtues thence destined to be infused\r\ninto it. Every man who has been conspicuous for his soldierly conduct\r\nand for the faithful performance of duty will be an object of general\r\nrespect, though he may have passed unscathed through the fiery ordeal;\r\nwhile every maimed and wounded citizen will be regarded as bearing on\r\nhis person, in his honorable scars and deficient limbs, the decorations\r\nwhich exalt and ennoble him in the eyes of his countrymen. Many a\r\nchivalrous deed will be recounted with pride and satisfaction, and\r\nhanded down to immortality by the pen of history and poetry, and by the\r\npencil and chisel of art. Even the undistinguished services of those who\r\nhave fought in the war for the Union, and who have passed unchallenged\r\nthrough the fiery ordeal, will be cherished by their children, and\r\ntransmitted to their remoter posterity with patriotic pride and\r\npardonable self-satisfaction. Thus the glory of noble deeds in this\r\nmemorable war will everywhere shed its lustre on the national character,\r\nand will tend to stimulate the loftiest virtues in the present and\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the unavoidable dissipation of military life,\r\nthe vices of the camp, the brutality and want of moral sensibility\r\nengendered by the necessity of slaughter and the horrible ravages of\r\nwar, will tend largely to counteract the good results already noted.\r\nThose who may be nobly disdainful of their own sufferings, will\r\nsometimes be even more regardless of the sufferings of others; and\r\nperhaps sometimes, with the natural perversion of human passion effected\r\nby civil war, will seek to avenge their own misfortunes by ungenerous\r\nrigor and cruelty toward all within their power, suspected of favoring\r\nthe enemy only in thought or sentiment. Even this imperfect\r\ndiscrimination is too often altogether omitted, and innocent loyalty is\r\nmade to suffer losses and severities which ought never to be visited on\r\nnon-combatants, even though they be of the enemy. The fearful disregard\r\nof human life, and of the accumulations of human labor in the shape of\r\nproperty, which marks the movements of our armies in almost all\r\nquarters, and even distinguishes the conduct of some of our high\r\nofficials, constitutes one of the most serious evils which attend the\r\ncontest, and which will leave their natural consequences as a permanent\r\ninjury to the nation. The record of these misdeeds, now disregarded in\r\nthe hurry and excitement of the conflict, will hereafter confront us\r\nwith terrible effect. The bad acts themselves will long continue to bear\r\nfruit after their kind, and to scatter the seeds of vice over the land.\r\nSuch drawbacks, however, accompany more or less all great military\r\noperations, no matter how sacred the cause in which armies are engaged.\r\nYet, we fear, no such example of generous and unselfish devotion to a\r\nholy cause can be found in our present experience as was exhibited by\r\nthe French people in their violent and bloody revolution of 1789. The\r\nmercenary spirit has largely infected the military as well as the civil\r\nagencies of our Government. But a people struggling for great principles\r\nare compelled to use such instruments as may be at its command; and if\r\nthe material of armies and their connections in civil life be often of a\r\ncharacter to be degraded rather than elevated by the employments and\r\nexperiences of war, it is nevertheless certain that these bad effects do\r\nnot always, perhaps not generally, outweigh and overpower the good.\r\n\r\nHistory does not present another example of large armies made up of such\r\nmen as those who now constitute the defenders of the Union. For\r\nintelligence and moral worth, they are unsurpassed by the masses of any\r\npopulation in the civilized world, and certainly they are far superior\r\nin all respects to those usually constituting the armies of other\r\nnations. To our shame and regret, there are certainly some exceptions to\r\nthis statement; but these are comparatively few, and mostly confined to\r\nthose who have not enjoyed the full advantage of our noble system of\r\nuniversal education. In many instances, the best young men in the land\r\nhave gone into the army as privates; while in the rural districts and\r\nfrom the Western States, the very bone and sinew of the population--the\r\nsober, steady, intelligent, industrious, and prosperous part of the\r\npeople--have taken up arms in the cause of the Union, from a deliberate\r\napproval of the policy of the war on our part, and from the noblest and\r\nmost unselfish motives of patriotism. The preponderance of such men in\r\nour armies evidently makes them, on the whole, susceptible to the good,\r\nrather than to the bad influences of war. Reflection, self-respect,\r\nrational views of the causes and objects of the war, and elevated\r\nmotives of action, cannot fail to bring those who possess these\r\nqualities all the benefits of self-denial, of patriotic labor willingly\r\nexpended, and of sacrifices made and sufferings endured in a good and\r\nnoble cause. The mental cultivation and moral training of the American\r\ncitizen constitute a shield, from whose solid and polished surface the\r\nmissiles of temptation, which easily penetrate other defences, usually\r\nglance or rebound with harmless effect. The carnage of the battle field,\r\nthe bombardment and capture of cities, and the ravages of armies,\r\nmarching or in camp, which too often harden the hearts and blunt the\r\nsensibilities of the ordinary soldier, have no such effect, or, at\r\nleast, a much less effect, in this particular, on the minds of humane\r\nand educated men. Hence we may fairly anticipate that the influence of\r\nthis war on the men who compose the army, and who must sooner or later\r\nreturn to the occupations they have temporarily left, will be of a far\r\nbetter character than that of any war ever hitherto waged in any part of\r\nthe world. No such conditions have ever heretofore existed in reference\r\nto any great national contest. Our immense volunteer army, so largely\r\ncomposed of intelligent and respectable men--men who are fully capable,\r\nand entitled by their votes, to influence the great measures of war or\r\npeace--presents a spectacle new and wholly unexampled in history; and\r\nthe consequences of our contest to the moral and social condition of the\r\npeople will be correspondingly unusual and important. We may safely\r\nassume from these considerations that the good will preponderate over\r\nthe bad.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another species of influence of a more questionable\r\ncharacter, which is worthy of consideration in any attempt to anticipate\r\nthe consequences of this extraordinary rebellion. The nature of our\r\ninstitutions renders them accessible to popular impulses at very brief\r\nintervals of time; and it may well be expected, that, after the\r\nconclusion of the war, especially if it be successful, a sentiment\r\nnearly universal will prevail in favor of the elevation of the men who\r\nhave been conspicuous in the military service. There will be a\r\ndisposition to reward the successful soldier with civic honors, and to\r\nplace the conduct of the Government in the hands of men who have\r\nexhibited only a capacity to lead and handle armies. The power of the\r\nmilitary men will in this way be prolonged. Doubtless, a great soldier\r\nmay be expected to show large executive abilities, and with proper\r\nexperience may well be intrusted with the management of the highest\r\noffices in our country. There are times and occasions, of which the\r\npresent is a most memorable instance, when the peculiar capacities of a\r\ngreat military leader would be of infinite service to the cause of\r\nfreedom and humanity, provided, at the same time, he should possess\r\nundoubted integrity and patriotism, without any mixture of bad ambition.\r\nA Washington, or a Jackson, in the Presidential chair at the\r\ncommencement of this rebellion, would have been of inestimable value to\r\nour country, outweighing the importance of mighty armies and countless\r\ntreasure; for the value both of men and money, in such emergencies,\r\ndepends wholly on the skill and wisdom with which they are used and\r\ndirected. If God had vouchsafed us one grand will to control the human\r\ntempest now raging around us, our noble country would have been saved\r\nfrom many calamities and much disgrace, such as will require hard labor\r\nand heavy sacrifices to overcome.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, the probability that military men may frequently\r\nbe elevated to high office that need give any apprehension to the lover\r\nof his country. But it is the almost certain prevalence of a blind and\r\nundistinguishing sentiment of caste, which will seek to control the\r\nelections in favor of the soldier under all circumstances, whether fit\r\nor unfit for the position sought. We are likely to have soldiers in all\r\nthe executive offices, soldiers in the diplomatic service, in the\r\nlegislative halls, and even on the bench. The danger is that the popular\r\nenthusiasm in favor of those who have served in the war will go to the\r\nextent of substituting gallantry and good conduct in the field for those\r\nvery different qualifications demanded in responsible civil stations. A\r\nwound received, or a limb lost, will, in many instances, constitute a\r\nstronger recommendation for political preferment than long experience,\r\ncoupled with ability and high character. This disposition to reward\r\nthose who have faithfully served the country in time of war is an\r\namiable characteristic of the American people, and proves that, in this\r\nparticular at least, republics are not ungrateful. But it is clear, at\r\nthe same time, that the public gratitude, thus turned into political\r\nchannels, may be productive of great evil, by lowering the character of\r\nthe men employed in performing public functions of importance. Already\r\nthe results of our elective system have become the subject of intense\r\nanxiety in the minds of reflecting men. Notwithstanding the extensive\r\nprovision made for the education of our people, of the universality and\r\nefficiency of which we justly boast, an almost equal extension of the\r\nelective franchise has not tended to improve the wisdom of the popular\r\nchoice, or the character and qualifications of the men selected in\r\nlatter times to fill high public offices. So seriously is this truth\r\nfelt, that it is now a political problem of the first importance to\r\ndevise some means by which the frequent elections in our country may be\r\nmade to work more certainly and uniformly to the elevation of good and\r\nable men, who now too often shun rather than seek employment in the\r\nnational service. If this indispensable improvement cannot be\r\naccomplished, our institutions are in danger of falling into contempt,\r\nas exhibiting no very great advance on the old modes of hereditary\r\ndesignation of political functionaries. The party machinery of the\r\npresent day, adapted chiefly to the purpose of availability and the\r\nmeans of securing success at all hazards, is mostly responsible for the\r\ndegeneracy which unquestionably characterizes the public men of this\r\nday, in comparison with those who in former times filled the same high\r\nstations. In view of these facts, it may be that the military regime\r\nabout to be ushered in as a consequence of the great existing war, will\r\nof itself be an improvement, since it must be acknowledged there is some\r\nmerit in the devotion and sacrifices of those who fight the battles of\r\nthe Union, while it is notorious that corrupt political parties too\r\nfrequently select and reward their leaders without regard to merit at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that there is inconsistency and contradiction in the\r\nviews presented, inasmuch as the claim for remarkable intelligence and\r\nsuperiority in the rank and file of the army would imply too much\r\npatriotism and self-sacrifice to admit of the consequences suggested.\r\nBut we must remember the immense numbers of our army, its large\r\nproportion to the whole population, the _esprit de corps_ so naturally\r\nengendered in such a body, and the powerful influence it may wield by\r\nturning the scale in our inveterate and often nicely balanced partisan\r\ncontests. We must also take into consideration that well known principle\r\nof human nature, as old as government itself, which seems to impel all\r\nmen possessing irresponsible power to abuse it, and employ it for their\r\nown selfish advantage. This is peculiarly the case with _classes_ which\r\ngain ascendency, as such, over the other parts of the community.\r\nPolitical parties in our country will surely not fail to seek alliance\r\nwith the citizen soldiers at the close of the war, and to secure success\r\nby all the arts and devices which can be made available to that end. But\r\nlet us hope the good sense and patriotism of our young men, their\r\nmoderation and self-control, will be as conspicuous in future political\r\ncampaigns, as in those more glorious ones which are yet destined to\r\noverthrow our enemies and restore our inestimable Union to its former\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nBut it is not our purpose to confine these remarks to the loyal States\r\nand the Union armies; nor is it at all paradoxical to extend them to the\r\nregion and the population controlled by the rebel government. Every good\r\ncitizen, having confidence in the supremacy of right and the destiny of\r\nour country, anticipates the reunion of the States at the conclusion of\r\nthe war. The bulk of the Southern army must likewise return to society,\r\nand carry with it such influence as it may derive from the peculiar\r\ncharacter of its cause, the motives by which it is animated, and the\r\nacts, good or bad, noble or mean, which it may perform. It cannot be\r\ndenied that the soldiers of the rebel army have exhibited the highest\r\npersonal qualities, of daring courage, skilful enterprise, patient\r\nendurance, and the most indomitable perseverance, under difficulties\r\napparently insuperable. Their cause is bad. The impartial judgment of\r\nmankind will pronounce it so, when the passions of the hour shall have\r\ncompletely subsided. But the masses of the Southern people evidently do\r\nnot take this view of the war they are waging against the Government\r\nwhich has so long protected them, and under which they have acquired all\r\nthe strength they are now ungratefully using to overthrow it. They have\r\nbeen artfully misled into the belief that they are engaged in a war\r\naltogether defensive--that they are fighting _pro aris et focis_--in\r\nshort, that they have given themselves up to the holiest work which any\r\npeople can ever be called on to undertake. Doubtless, in frequent\r\ninstances, and sometimes among considerable populations, different\r\nsentiments prevail and have been entertained from the beginning. A\r\nglimmering of the truth may occasionally dawn on the minds of those who\r\nwent into the contest with entire confidence in the justice of their\r\ncause. But on the whole it is vain to deny the sincerity and the deep\r\nconvictions of the Southern people. Nothing less than these could have\r\nsustained them in the appalling difficulties of their position. No\r\npeople ever conducted a more brilliant and successful defensive war\r\nagainst the vast odds, on land and sea, with which they have had to\r\ncontend. Let us be sufficiently magnanimous to confess the truth,\r\nunpleasant though it be, and acknowledge that they have hitherto\r\noutmanaged us in the general conduct of the war. They have exhibited an\r\nearnestness and determination, a gallantry and devotion, worthy of the\r\nhighest purposes that ever call forth the energy of struggling nations.\r\nIt is vain to say they are compelled by a military despotism; for,\r\nhowever strong and arbitrary their government may be, it evidently rests\r\nupon the support of the people, and it could never continue the present\r\ncontest against popular disaffection at home joined with the mighty\r\ninvading armies of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhat then are to be the results of great efforts and sacrifices in a\r\ncause which, though we believe it to be bad, they consider holy? Are\r\ntheir chivalrous deeds to be less ennobling to the character of Southern\r\nmen, than similar ones, springing from like motives, on the part of our\r\narmies? It is the motive which gives character to all actions, and\r\nmistake or error of the most perverse kind, when arising from honest\r\nconviction, cannot alter the merit of what is done or suffered. If it be\r\nsaid that the assumed convictions of the Southern people are incredible,\r\nit is only necessary to look back a few centuries, in order to see the\r\nwhole Christian world entertaining sentiments equally abhorrent to the\r\nenlightened conscience of the present day. The universal participation\r\nin the slave trade, and the horrible persecutions for religious heresy,\r\nwhich everywhere prevailed, are sad evidences of the possibility of\r\nindulging the most disastrous errors with perfect sincerity. Besides, if\r\nwe consider how great a diversity of opinion prevails among the people\r\nof the loyal States, on the subject of the rebellion and its causes, it\r\nwill require no great degree of credulity to induce the belief that the\r\nSouthern people are impelled by deep convictions in their present\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nFailure and defeat on their part will cast the usual discredit on the\r\ncause which is overthrown; and in this case we do not entertain a doubt\r\nthat ultimately the right will prevail, and that the discomfiture and\r\ndisgrace will fall where justice would require. Men will be deeply\r\nmortified to find themselves utterly overcome, and all their brave deeds\r\nand their magnanimous sacrifices and sufferings expended in a failing\r\nand a bad cause. It will be their great misfortune that serious\r\nreflection and conviction should come to them only after these great\r\nevents, and when it is too late to recall them. But it is the peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of contests like this, that they do eventually make clear\r\nthe subjects of dispute in which they originate. All the wranglings of\r\npoliticians, and all the learning and logic of contending theologians in\r\ndivided churches, could never accomplish the speedy and thorough\r\ndecision of contested questions which will follow this tremendous war.\r\nBold and extra-constitutional expedients necessarily grow out of the\r\nprevailing violence. They will soon test the possibility of measures\r\nwhich are too great for ordinary times, and will push the existing\r\ntendencies toward fundamental change into sudden and premature\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nPhysical strength and success in war are by no means fair tests of truth\r\nand principle; but in the present contest, such is the condition of our\r\ncountry and the character of its relations with the civilized world\r\nthat, if the Union shall be restored to its former integrity, the result\r\nwill give strong evidence of the righteousness of our cause. Such are\r\nthe temptations to foreign interference, and such the evident\r\ndisposition of the ruling dynasties in some powerful nations to destroy\r\nthe influence and example of this great republic, as well as to break\r\ndown her rivalry in commerce and manufactures, that nothing but a holy\r\ncause, appealing to the moral sense of mankind, could prevent the\r\nnatural alliance between despotism abroad and the kindred system in the\r\nSouth which seeks to establish its tyranny on the ruins of our\r\nGovernment. Besides, the diverging systems of policy in the two sections\r\nhave carried on their struggle for more than a quarter of a century,\r\nunder conditions which make it demonstrable that their present\r\ninequality of strength and means is the direct consequence of these\r\ndivergencies. Their long-continued emulation, passing through all the\r\nstages of envy, hatred, and political contention, has finally culminated\r\nin bloody civil war; and from the peculiar circumstances of the case,\r\nthe termination of the contest, if the parties be left to themselves,\r\nwill fully and fairly test the physical strength and moral force of the\r\ncontending principles. The better principle, by virtue of its superior\r\ngrowth, will overthrow the worse and weaker one, which has relatively\r\ndeclined in power throughout all the long contest between the two.\r\nEnlightened convictions will grow up as the mighty conflict subsides;\r\nand institutions will be modified in conformity with the truths which\r\nare destined to appear through the blaze and smoke of battle.\r\n\r\nHeaven forbid that we should confound moral distinctions, and place\r\ntreason and rebellion on the same footing with patriotic devotion to the\r\ncause of Union and liberty. Political and moral errors, however innocent\r\nin intention, stand on the same footing, as to their consequences, with\r\nall other violations of natural law. They bring retribution inevitable;\r\nnor can the blind and ignorant partisan of wrong entirely escape the\r\nshame of his misconduct, on the ground of erroneous judgment. But let us\r\nnot arrogate to ourselves a superiority of virtue, which in reality we\r\nhave no just right to claim. Are we sure that, even on our side, which\r\nwe consider that of truth and humanity, all our individual motives are\r\nup to the level of the great principles involved? Are we not rather, to\r\nsome extent, the blind instruments of social causes, stronger than our\r\nown will, and while seeming to follow the inclination of our own\r\nenlightened minds, are we not impelled by passion and ambition in the\r\ninevitable direction indicated, and even necessitated, by the\r\ncircumstances surrounding us? Are not similar influences operating on\r\nthe Southern mind, and forcing it, with a compulsion equally inexorable,\r\ninto the fatal current of civil war? With the masses on both sides, this\r\nis undoubtedly true. Whole communities do not engage in such disastrous\r\nstrife in mere wantonness and wicked advocacy of a bad cause. Either\r\ntheir judgment is distorted, or their passions aroused to such an extent\r\nas to render them utterly blind to the true nature of the principles\r\ninvolved, and to make them believe they are acting, under the strongest\r\nprovocation, for the defence of their honor, their interests, and their\r\nacknowledged rights. Every liberal mind will readily concede the\r\nexistence of these sentiments and motives.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the war ended by the overthrow of the rebellion and the\r\nrestoration of the Federal authority: what is to be the effect in those\r\nStates which have been the theatre of the great conspiracy, whence have\r\nissued all the mighty armies which have assailed so fiercely the\r\nConstitution and Government of our fathers? Will the men who have shed\r\ntheir blood freely to destroy the Union ever again be brought to sustain\r\nit with sincerity and zeal? Can they be expected to acknowledge their\r\nprofound error, and receive again heartily to their affections and\r\nwilling obedience the authority which they have so haughtily spurned and\r\nsought to smite with utter destruction? This is a momentous question. It\r\nis the most important which can be presented to the country at the\r\nmoment of its anticipated triumph, when the fearful clash of arms is\r\nabout to subside and give place to the serious labor of conciliation and\r\nreconstruction. To conquer the rebellion will be, at least, to make all\r\nits aims utterly hopeless. Failure and disaster will be forever stamped\r\nupon the ideas on which the revolution has been founded, and they, with\r\ntheir inspiration, good or bad, will be permanently overthrown, together\r\nwith the men who have used them so efficiently for the inauguration and\r\ncontinuance of this tremendous strife. There is wonderful power in the\r\nsuccess of an idea, as there is a corresponding influence in the utter\r\noverthrow of its physical manifestations and efforts. A cause rendered\r\nhopeless by defeat ceases to sustain the passions which it has excited,\r\nunder the influence of which it has made itself respectable and\r\npowerful. If it be founded in truth and right, it will have within\r\nitself the elements of resuscitation, and it can never become altogether\r\nhopeless. But if it have no such basis of substantial truth, its failure\r\nonce is for all time. The hearts of men cannot long cling to such a\r\ncause. Its traditions even become odious, and the effort will be to\r\nignore and forget its incidents, and to escape the discredit of having\r\nparticipated in its ambitious struggles.\r\n\r\nBut to conquer the rebellion is not to subjugate the South. This is a\r\ndistinction of the utmost importance in attempting to estimate the\r\nconsequences of the great struggle. So far from the subjugation of the\r\nSouthern people resulting, in any contingency, the success of the Union\r\narms must be their regeneration and redemption. To overthrow the\r\nconfederate government will be only to relieve the people from its\r\ngrasp, and to reinstate them in the rights and liberties which they have\r\nhitherto enjoyed. A combination of force, fraud, and self-delusion has\r\nsustained the power of the rebel dynasty, and enabled it to wield the\r\ninfluence and authority of the whole people of the seceding States, with\r\nsome few remarkable exceptions. To break up this combination will do\r\nmore than merely defeat a hostile power: it will, in effect, annihilate\r\nthe whole vicious organization, and leave its elements free to engage in\r\nother combinations, more in accordance with right, and better calculated\r\nto secure success and prosperity. It is not unreasonable to anticipate\r\nthat they will eventually resume their former relations with the Federal\r\nGovernment, as most conducive to these ends. There are some men, perhaps\r\none whole class, who can never escape the responsibility of all the\r\noverwhelming evils and calamities which the war has brought upon the\r\nSouth. The cordial acquiescence of these can hardly be anticipated; but\r\ntheir power will be completely destroyed, and the people may well be\r\nexpected to disregard their murmurs and complaints. Indeed, it is not\r\naltogether unlikely that an injured and exasperated people may turn on\r\nthe authors of their ruin, and wreak upon them a fearful vengeance, so\r\nfar, at least, as to ostracize and banish them forever from the land\r\nthey have blighted and destroyed. The masses of the people, holding few\r\nor no slaves, though involved in the war by force of the general\r\ndelusion into which they have been artfully inveigled, will not consider\r\nthemselves responsible for its consequences; they will rather look on\r\nthemselves as the victims of designing men, who, for selfish purposes,\r\nhave partly seduced and partly impelled them into the perils and\r\ndisasters of a gigantic but fruitless rebellion. This state of feeling\r\nwill leave the minds of the Southern people in a condition to estimate\r\nfairly their own relations to the rebellion, and their obligations to\r\nthe Union, which again calls them, with paternal tenderness, to its\r\ngenerous confidence and magnanimous protection. They will have no cause\r\nfor apprehension that their restoration to good fellowship and perfect\r\nequality will not be complete and free from all unfriendly reservations.\r\n\r\nBut this influence will not operate on those alone who have few or no\r\nslaves, comprehending the great mass of whites: it will exert itself\r\nmore notably on the large body of slaves themselves. This is an element\r\nin the calculation which, humble though it be, cannot be overlooked\r\nwithout great error in the results. A fundamental change will take place\r\nin the condition of the blacks. They will be emancipated, either\r\ngradually and safely, or with violent precipitation, with all its evils\r\nand disasters. Yet, however the decree may come, whether by the sudden\r\nblow of military power, or by the free and cheerful cooperation of the\r\nStates and their people, the measure itself will be plainly the result\r\nof the rebellion, as met by the firm and noble stand assumed by the\r\nFederal Government, and maintained at so great a cost of treasure and of\r\nprecious lives. The Government which, out of civil war and chaotic\r\nstrife, brings such advantages--out of calamity and danger educes such\r\nblessings of security and progress will be entitled to the unbounded\r\ngratitude of those who will be the chief gainers by its policy. But\r\nexperience will soon teach the whites that they will be equal gainers in\r\nthe end; and, in time, we may justly expect not only their cheerful\r\nacquiescence, but their renewed allegiance and ardent support to the\r\nFederal authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTTOES FOR CONTRACTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   When you contract for boots and shoes,\r\n   Be not contracted in your views.\r\n\r\n   When you agree to clothe the body,\r\n   Expand your soul and flee from shoddy.\r\n\r\n   No soul the difference can see\r\n   'Twixt chico-rye and chicoree.\r\n\r\n   'Tis wise to feed the soldier well:\r\n   For reason _why_--see Dante's 'Hell.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSHINE IN THOUGHT.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genial pen of Mr. Leland has found an attractive theme in the title\r\nof this curious and suggestive volume. Without the formality of an\r\ninexorable system, it is written from the impulses of a large and\r\nsympathetic nature, more accustomed to the acute observation of details\r\nthan to exact and rigid generalizations, but sending free and\r\npenetrating glances beneath the surface of social life, and presenting a\r\nvariety of sagacious hints and comments, often admirable for their\r\nquaint, original illustrations, and seldom destitute of an important\r\nethical bearing and significance.\r\n\r\nIn the composition of this work, Mr. Leland has aimed at the defence of\r\nthat view of life which combines a cheerful earnestness of purpose with\r\nmanly energy of action, as opposed to the melancholic, whining,\r\nlachrymose spirit, which has been affected by certain popular modern\r\npoets, and, through their vicious example, has been cherished as one of\r\nthe essential qualities of genius. Of this style of character Mr. Leland\r\nhas not the slightest degree of tolerance. Its manifestations are all\r\nabominable in his eyes, and unsavory in his nostrils. He cannot endure\r\nits presence; he regards its exercise as a nuisance: its permission in\r\nthe plan of a kindly Providence is a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a morbid melancholy, whether affected or genuine, in\r\nthe literature of the United States, is justly a matter of surprise and\r\nlamentation with the author. The American mind, as he remarks, has\r\ndoubtless a strong tendency to humor. It delights in the expression of a\r\nmischievous irony or good-natured sarcasm. The querulous wailings which\r\nare the stock in trade of a certain class of writers are unnatural and\r\ndiscordant sounds. We should expect rather a serene and cheerful melody\r\nfrom a young and brave-hearted race, which is in intimate relations with\r\nthe external world. Instead of this, we have sucked in with the milk of\r\nour Puritan mothers a forlorn and sorrowful spirit. We celebrate our\r\nfestivals with a sad countenance. We attempt to make merry by singing\r\ndismal psalms. We weave our woes into poetry, and expand our\r\nwretchedness in plaintive declamations.\r\n\r\nThis is a wide departure from the genius of Christianity, as well as\r\nfrom the healthy instincts of humanity. In the first ages after Christ,\r\nthe newborn element of thought was a pure and beautiful spring, bubbling\r\nup from the moss-grown ruins of the temple of heathendom. A hopeful,\r\njoyous tone is indicated in the symbols of the early faith preserved in\r\nthe Vatican. It contained the germ of republican freedom and of a benign\r\nand beneficent civilization. But it was driven by political convulsions\r\ntoward the East, and returned in the melancholy robes of the dreamy and\r\nmorbid oriental. It learned from Indian fakirs that laughter was a sin,\r\nthat misery was meritorious, that the hatred of beauty and joy was a\r\nvirtue in the sight of Heaven. The early Christians were imbued with the\r\nsentiment of moral grandeur and loveliness; they represented Christ our\r\nLord as the fair ideal of humanity; but a darker age decreed that his\r\nform should be meagre and homely--misled by those pagan Syrian pictures,\r\nwhich still disfigure the churches in Russia, and whose original may be\r\nfound in the avatars of violence, modified by old Persian influence.\r\nFrom the seventh to the twelfth century, the tendency to asceticism was\r\nrampant. Beauty was proscribed as a temptation of the devil; deformed\r\nand crooked limbs were ranked among the beatitudes; even dirt was\r\napotheosized, and, as a consequence, millions of men were mowed down by\r\nunheard-of forms of disease. Humanity did not submit to this rule of\r\nausterity and torture without a struggle. There was often a brave,\r\nvigorous resistance. A lively protest was uttered in the joyous strains\r\nof the troubadours and minnesingers. The glad spirit of nature could not\r\nbe wholly suppressed, and from amid the social oppressions of the times\r\nsweet voices fell upon the ear, celebrating the praises of woman, the\r\nlove of beauty, and the joyousness of life.\r\n\r\nBut, according to our author, none of the great names in literature have\r\never proclaimed the evangel of cheerfulness in all its health and\r\npurity. The world as yet has never been fit to receive it. Years may\r\npass before it will be fully unfolded. Society is still in its earliest\r\nMarch spring. The fresh winds which blow are still wild and chill; the\r\nnights are long and dreary; and during these gloomy hours, the ancient\r\ncrone still relates horrible legends to believing ears. If the elder or\r\nwiser ones only half believe them, most of the listeners still shiver at\r\ntheir weird, grotesque poetry, and when they make new songs for\r\nthemselves, the old demoniac strains still linger on the air, showing\r\nthe origin of their earliest lays.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the lack of true joyousness in the literature of\r\nthe world, Mr. Leland takes a rapid survey of some of the most\r\ndistinguished writers in ancient and modern times. Aristophanes, he\r\nmaintains, did not possess the genuine element in question. Allowing the\r\nclaims of the great satirist to genius, he had not reached the perennial\r\nsprings of cheerfulness in the depths of the human soul. In his gayest\r\narabesques, we trace the eternal line of life, but the deep, monotonous\r\necho of death is always nigh. He still had the sorrows which grieve the\r\nstrong humorist of every age. He could not escape the deep woe of seeing\r\nsocial right and human happiness trodden under foot by tyranny; and\r\nfolly and ignorance, pain and sorrow were the great foundation stones on\r\nwhich the gay temple of Grecian beauty was built. For every free citizen\r\nwho wandered through the groves of the Academy, holding high converse\r\nwith Plato, and revelling in the enjoyment of the divinest beauty in\r\nnature and art, there was an untold multitude of slaves and barbarians,\r\ninto whose lives was crowded every element of bitterness.\r\n\r\nBut surely, the great sage of humor, glorious Father Rabelais, of later\r\ndays, was an exception to the prevailing rule of joyousness in\r\nliterature? Not at all, contends our author. To the young mind which\r\nhungers for truth and joy, there is something irresistibly fascinating\r\nand persuasive in the jolly philosophy and reckless worldly wisdom of\r\nRabelais. But after all, it will not do. It is anything but attainable\r\nby most of the world. It demands good cheer and jovial company. But it\r\ndies out in the desert, and is stifled among simple, vulgar associates.\r\nRabelais believed that he sacrificed to freedom, when he only worshipped\r\nfortune. He went through the world, familiar with the ways of princes\r\nand peers, priests and peasants, travelling in many lands, exhausting\r\nthe resources of art and learning, seeing through the sins and shams and\r\nsorrows of life, and laughing at everything, like a good-natured,\r\nlarge-hearted Mephistopheles. But he had never learned the true\r\nphilosophy of joyousness in the sincere love of nature, the deep phases\r\nof humanity, and the affluence and purity of strong affection.\r\n\r\nNor do we find a better specimen in the renowned English humorists,\r\nSterne and Swift. The former closely follows his French prototype in\r\ngrotesque fancies: he abounds in tender and delicate pathos, though in\r\nthe highest degree artificial and forced; but do we ever arise from\r\nreading him, like a giant refreshed by wine? Sterne, in fact, has even\r\nless of the true philosophy of life than Rabelais. He affords no\r\nstimulant to joyous, healthy action, awakens no impulse to gladden life,\r\nor to make sorrow less and hope greater. It may be all very touching,\r\nvery comic, very ingenious, but it is not healthy or joyous. And Swift?\r\nAn immense fund of laughter, doubtless, had the witty Irish dean; but as\r\nlittle claim to be a joyous writer as the prophet Jeremiah, or the\r\nauthor of 'Groans from the Bottomless Pit.' The men who have been spoken\r\nof dealt largely in satire and humor; but joyousness deals in infinitely\r\nmore. Mirth and laughter are all very well, but they are not all in all.\r\nCheerfulness requires something more than a well-balanced Rabelaisian\r\nnonchalance in adversity and a keen relish for all pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe relation of Christianity to the theme of the volume presents a\r\ndelicate, and, it may be thought, a dangerous topic of discussion, for a\r\nso decidedly secular pen as Mr. Leland's; but he touches upon it with\r\nfreedom and boldness, though with frankest sympathy and reverence for\r\nthe great Spirit, whose religion is the most significant fact in the\r\nhistory of the world. 'I must confess,' says he, 'that even regarded\r\nfrom a material and historical point alone, that is a poor, cowardly\r\nsoul, which does not feel the deepest earnestness of truth in\r\nacknowledging the Wonderful One, Jesus Christ, as the Lord and Saviour\r\nof the whole world.' His sublime soul, profound, universal, loving\r\nbeyond all power of human conception, introduced a new era for humanity.\r\nUnder his teaching, philosophy became indeed truly divine, for it became\r\ninfinite, and was thrown open to all. He first of all opened the\r\nconsolations of free thought, of freedom from old superstition, of love,\r\nand strength, and inward joy, to the whole race of mankind. No narrow\r\nlimits of sect or caste or nationality cramped him, the first great\r\nCosmopolite. We cannot sufficiently admire the infinite adaptability,\r\nthe universal knowledge of humanity, the boundless sympathy with man,\r\nwhich are everywhere manifest in the original Christian philosophy of\r\nlife. What a depth of meaning in the symbolic bread and wine, typical of\r\nthe life which flows through eternity and all its changes, of human love\r\nand birth and death, of bounteous, beautiful nature, with its\r\ncontinually renewed strength--the whole given, not in funereal guise,\r\nnot with sombre fasting, but as a joyous feast.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament abounds in symbols, parables, and proverbs, taken from\r\nancient tradition, but beautifully woven into a purer faith, which\r\ntaught that the healthy joys of life, and all knowledge of divine truth,\r\nshould be given not to a few kings or priests, a few favored with\r\ninitiation into divine mysteries, as of old, but to the whole world; for\r\nthe spirit of Christianity was identical with the genius of\r\nrepublicanism. As taught by our Lord Jesus Christ, it was eminently\r\nhealthy, brave-hearted, and joyous. It did not commend celibacy, nor\r\nexcess of fasting, nor too long prayers, nor righteousness overmuch. It\r\ndid not approve of a plethora of outward goods, while the culture of our\r\nhighest faculties was neglected. It condemned all excess of care, even\r\nin our daily duties, at the expense of that 'better part' which\r\ndistinguishes us from mere ants or bees. It gave no warrant for the\r\ndismal dirges and melancholy groans which are raised in its name, by men\r\nwhom Jesus would have been the first to reprove. 'It was a religion of\r\nlife and of beauty, of friendship and temperate mirth, of love, truth,\r\nand manliness; one which opposed neither feasting at weddings nor \"going\r\na fishing.\"'\r\n\r\nThe temptation to find a refuge from the evils of life in active\r\nexertion, instead of cultivating the sources of joy in our own nature,\r\nis the subject of an ingenious and striking chapter. In a land, where\r\nenjoyment in many minds is connected with a sense of sin, it is\r\ndoubtless better that the overflowing energy of character, which is a\r\ntrait of the population, should seek vent in the excitements of labor,\r\nthan in poisonous liquors, horse races, politics, and the gaming table.\r\nWhere the natural support of life is wanting, partial methods of relief\r\nmay be employed. He who can no longer swallow, may gain an imperfect\r\nnourishment by means of baths, or artificial transmission. So, the grim\r\nand hardened soul, which has lost the support of inward cheerfulness,\r\nmay find strength in work, merely for the sake of work. But it is a\r\nfraud upon humanity to educate men solely as industrious animals. Hives\r\nare beautiful, honey is sweet, and wonderful is the cunning structure of\r\nthe cell; but society is not a hive, nor the people bees. The day is\r\ndawning when it will be understood that cheerful songs are as essential\r\nto genuine manhood as work; that labor is not to be borne as a curse,\r\nwith sighs and groans; but combined with mental culture, will become\r\ncapable of self-support, and will supply its own enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe great problem of the age is the union of beauty with practical uses.\r\nIn their highest forms, art and science blend and become identical, just\r\nas the Beautiful and the Good assimilate, as we trace them to their\r\nsource in Truth. While art becomes more practical, it loses none of its\r\nbeauty. In the infancy of science, it was mainly devoted to the\r\nillustration of the fanciful and ornamental. Even architecture, in the\r\nearly ages, looked less to permanent comfort than to artistic effect.\r\nBut everything now tends to realization. Poetry and art fall in with\r\nthis influence of the age. Science is every day taking man away from the\r\npurely ideal, the morbid and visionary; from the fond fancies of old\r\neras, and leading him to facts and to nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Leland never becomes formal or spiritless in the treatment of his\r\nfavorite topics, and often rises to a high degree of enthusiastic\r\neloquence. Witness the following noble appeal in behalf of a cheerful\r\nearnestness in the cultivation of literature and art:\r\n\r\n     Young writer, young artist, whoever you be, I pray you go to work\r\n     in this roaring, toiling, machine-clanking, sunny, stormy,\r\n     terrible, joyful, commonplace, vulgar, tremendous world in\r\n     _downright earnest_. By all the altars of Greek beauty themselves,\r\n     I swear it to you; yes, by all that Raphael painted and Shakspeare\r\n     taught; by all the glory and dignity of all art and of all Thought!\r\n     you will find your most splendid successes not in cultivating the\r\n     worn-out romantic, but in _loving_ the growing Actual of life.\r\n     Master the past if you will, but only that you may the more\r\n     completely forget it in the present. He or she is best and bravest\r\n     among you who gives us the freshest draughts of reality and of\r\n     Nature. It lies all around you--in the foul smoke and smell of the\r\n     factory, amid the crash and slip of heavy wheels on muddy stones,\r\n     in the blank-gilt glare of the steamboat saloon, by the rattling\r\n     chips of the faro table, in the quiet, gentle family circle, in the\r\n     opera, in the six-penny concert, the hotel, the watering-place, on\r\n     the prairie, in the prison. Not as the poor playwright and little\r\n     sensation-story grinder see them, not as the manufacturers of\r\n     Magdalen elegies and mock-moral and mock-philanthropical tales skim\r\n     them, but in their truth and freshness as facts, around and through\r\n     which sweep incessantly the infinite joys and agonies, the dreams\r\n     and loves and despair of _humanity_. Heavens! is not LIFE as\r\n     earnest and as mysterious and as well worth the fierce grapple of\r\n     GENIUS, here and _now_, in this American nineteenth century, as it\r\n     ever was under the cedars of Italy, the olives of Greece, or the\r\n     palms of Morning Land? Are there not as much, or more vigor and\r\n     raciness in the practical souls of the multitude and in their\r\n     never-ending strife with Nature, as among the spoiled and dainty\r\n     darlings of fortune and among the nerveless, mind-emasculated\r\n     Victims of Society who sing us their endless Miserere from the\r\n     Sistine chapels of fashionable novels? You know there is, and if\r\n     you watch the time, you may see that it is the warm truth from real\r\n     life, which is most eagerly read and which goes most directly to\r\n     the hearts of all. Never yet in history was there an age or a\r\n     country so rich in great ideas, in great developments, or which\r\n     offered such copious material to the writer as these of ours. Be\r\n     bold and seize it with a strong hand. Those who are to live after\r\n     us will wonder as we now do of the great eras of the past, that\r\n     there were so few on the spot to picture them. Yet, why speak of\r\n     _great_ scenes, when humanity and Nature are always great--great in\r\n     small things even, far beyond our utmost power of apprehension?\r\n     Forget the spirit of the past, live in the present, and thus--and\r\n     thus only--you will secure a glorious and undying reward in the\r\n     future.\r\n\r\nThe fault of this volume, in the eyes of many readers, will be a certain\r\nconfusion in the arrangement of the matter, and the want of sufficient\r\nexpansion in the development of some of its leading suggestions. But it\r\nmust be judged as the earnest utterances of a poet, rather than a grave\r\ndidactic treatise. With the purpose which the author had in view, a\r\nspice of rhapsody is no defect. He presents a beautiful example of the\r\nsmiling wisdom of which he is such an eloquent advocate. He has an\r\nintuitive sense of the genial and joyous aspects of life, and has no\r\nsympathies to waste on the victims of 'carking care' or morbid\r\nmelancholy. A more complete exposition of the conditions of cheerfulness\r\nin the nature of man, would furnish materials for an interesting volume;\r\nbut it belongs more properly to an ethical or philosophical discourse.\r\nWe will not complain of the author for not doing what he has not\r\nattempted--for what he had no inward call or outward occasion; what he\r\ncould not have accomplished but at the sacrifice of much which\r\nconstitutes the charm and grace of the present work; while we cordially\r\nthank him for this endeavor to speak a cheering word in behalf of the\r\njoyousness of life, and to spread 'sunshine in the shady place.'\r\n\r\n                                                                      R.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: SUNSHINE IN THOUGHT. By CHARLES GODFREY LELAND. 12mo, pp.\r\n197. New York: Geo. P. Putnam.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY JESTED IN THE GOOD OLD TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which contributes so much to ease social intercourse as\r\nthe jest. In comparison with it, the proverb is only a humble\r\nsubordinate, and song itself, with all its power, but a weak influence.\r\nYet the song and the proverb boast a critical literature, while the\r\nbrief compendiums of merriment which never die, which, once written,\r\nlive through every age, and force their way through every penetrable\r\nlanguage, are undoubtedly less studied than any other popular medium of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nWhat is a jest? It is as little worth the while to try to define its\r\nnature, as it is to analyze wit. We all know that the world laughs, and\r\nwhat it laughs at, and what the droll saws, anecdotes, rhymes, quips,\r\nand facetiae are, which give fame to a Bebel, or a Frischlin, a Tom\r\nBrown, and a Joseph Miller. Leave labored analysis to the philosophers,\r\ncontenting ourselves with remarking that a jest is a laugh candied or\r\nfrozen in words, and thawed and relished in the reading or utterance.\r\nAnd laughter? When a man is too lazy to think out an idea, and yet too\r\nactive to dreamily _feel_ it, he laughs. When he catches its leading\r\npoints, and yet realizes that behind them remains the incomprehensible\r\nor incongruous, he settles it for the nonce with a smile. Hence it comes\r\nthat we laugh so seldom with all our heart, a second time over a jest.\r\nIt has been _comprehended_; the mystery, the sense of contradiction and\r\nincongruity, has vanished--we may revive it in others, and laugh\r\nelectrically with them; but the first piquant gusto of _its_ spice is\r\ngone forever.\r\n\r\nYet the jest, like the proverb, acquires a value by becoming current.\r\nIt often illustrates an opinion or an experience, and when it is much\r\nworn, it may still gain a new point, by being brought into illustrative\r\nrelation with some event or idea. Esop's fables, or any fables, are,\r\nafter all, only good jokes in a narrative form, which owe their fame\r\nsimply to their boundless capacity for application. Sidney Smith's story\r\nof Mrs. Partington, who tried to mop out the Atlantic, was a jest, and\r\nso too was Lady Macbeth's 'cat i' the adage,' who wanted fish, yet would\r\nnot wet her paws, and let 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would.' _Something_\r\nof our old enjoyment of a joke for the first time, always lingers around\r\nit, and we gladly laugh again--for, 'old love never quite rusts out.'\r\nAnd there are many jests, which, owing to their boundless variety of\r\napplication, always come before us in a new light. Such are those which\r\nillustrate character. Woe to the man among the vulgar, who once becomes\r\nthe scape-goat of a story on the subject of a joke-anecdote which 'shows\r\nhim up.' Woe in truth, if it grow to a nickname--for then he, of all\r\npersons, learns that there are jests which never lose their sting.\r\n\r\nSome jests have been progressive--they have been re-made to suit the\r\ntimes. Diogenes, when asked which wine he preferred, replied, 'That of\r\nother people.' An Englishman answered to the same question, 'The O. P.\r\nbrand,' referring the initials not only to Other People, but also to the\r\nfar-famed Old Particular stamp which marked certain rare varieties--or,\r\nas others explain it, to 'Old Port.' The Scholastikos of Hierocles,\r\nhaving a house for sale, carried a brick around as a sample--a modern\r\nstory says that a commander when asked of what material his\r\nfortifications were built, called up his troops, and said:\r\n'There!--every man's a brick.' Here we have the 'living walls' of the\r\nRomans--two old stories blended into one, and the whole greatly\r\nstrengthened by a modern slang expression. When thus changed to suit the\r\ntimes, jests, instead of growing old, rather grow new again. Not\r\nunfrequently, a single joke becomes, in this manner, the parent of\r\nscores of others. I think that it is Mr. Wendell Phillips, who, in a\r\nlecture on Lost Arts, declares that there were never yet more than\r\ntwenty-five original 'good stories,' and that all of those now current\r\nmay be traced back to them. In a certain sense, the assertion is true;\r\nbut it is a mistake to confound the result of a cause with the cause\r\nitself, and an error to declare the descendant to be one and the same\r\nwith the ancestor. Max Muller has proved that hundreds of words of the\r\nmost different meanings descend from the same root, and, in like manner,\r\nwe might show, if the traditional links were supplied, that the last\r\n'good one' current at Washington, originated at the court of King\r\nPharaoh. Let no one laugh, for Chaucer's Clerke of Oxforde's Tale was\r\nfor years told, with Daniel Webster and Henry Clay as the heroes, and we\r\nhave even met with a bold Southron who '_knew_ that it was true of\r\nthem!'\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is worth while to observe that even the slang\r\nphrases of the day, which are popular, partly because they _save trouble\r\nin thinking_, and partly because the vulgar mind, like the vulgar ear,\r\nfinds a relief or pleasure in monotony--are not unfrequently of ancient\r\norigin. The current expression, 'a high old time,' occurs in a Latin\r\njest, given in an old German-Latin jest-book, which, as its preface\r\nasserts, consists entirely of a reprint from still older works.\r\n'Henricus,' it says, 'was begged to make at a wedding (_Hoch\r\nzeit_--literally, 'high time') a wedding song, and complied with the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n   'Iste vetus Juvenis Socius prius ad stationem arripit\r\n   Atque _altum tempus_ habere cupit.'[4]\r\n\r\nThe expression is better in its old form, since _altum_ means both high\r\nand old. Those who have laughed at the instance in 'Ferdinand Count\r\nFathom,' of the Dutchman, who boasted that his brother had written a\r\ngreat book of poetry as thick as a cheese, may find its original\r\n'motive' in an anecdote given in the same work.\r\n\r\n     'A peasant going to a lawyer, begged him to undertake a case for\r\n     him, to which the man of law assenting, began to refer to and read\r\n     in a very small book. But the peasant, who saw many large folios in\r\n     the study, touched the advocate on the arm and said:\r\n\r\n     'Sir--please read some in a _great_ book also, for this is\r\n     certainly a big case which I have brought to you.'\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the story of the fortune hunter who commanded his\r\nservant to duplicate in the affirmative, when he should be in\r\nconversation, all his assertions. 'I have a fine farm,' said he. 'Faith,\r\nye mane ye have two on thim,' interpolated his Irishman; and so it went\r\non, until the master admitted that he had a cork leg. '_Two_ false ligs,\r\n_an' ye know it_,' cried out the man. This is somewhat varied and\r\nenlarged from the old story as given in the _Facetiae_ of Bebel, in which\r\nthe nobleman, remarking to his lady-love that he was 'a little out of\r\nsorts,'--'_dixit ille, se pallidulum parumque infirmum_,' was\r\ninterrupted by his servant with: 'And no wonder, since you suffer with\r\nsuch a terrible and incurable quotidian disease!'[5]\r\n\r\nIf all stories and jests are to be traced to a few originals, perhaps\r\nthe many eccentric tales of Jack on horseback may be found in a very old\r\nanecdote of a certain _Venetus insuetus ac nescius equitare_--a Venetian\r\nunaccustomed to and ignorant of riding, who, when mounted on horseback,\r\nhaving inadvertently spurred the animal, exclaimed, as it reared and\r\nplunged:\r\n\r\n'Lord! the waves of the sea are nothing to those on land,'--thinking\r\nthat the leaping of his steed was caused by a sudden storm! The\r\nanecdotes of absent-mindedness may find a prototype in a very old\r\nmonk-Latin anecdote of a certain doctor who went riding '_cum Palatino\r\nRheni_,' with the Prince Palatine, and who, on being told that he had no\r\nbreeches on, replied: '_Credebam, o princeps, mihi famulum ea\r\ninduisse._' 'I thought, oh prince, that my valet had put them on!'\r\nDomine Sampson and the magistrate who appeared un-breeched before\r\nGeneral Washington, are both anticipated in these absent small-clothes.\r\n\r\nMany of the capital extravagances contained in 'Baron Munchausen' are\r\nborrowed literally from the old Latin jest-books. The incident of the\r\nwild pig which led about by its tail a blind wild boar, so that when the\r\nformer was slain the latter was taken home by simply giving it the tail\r\nto hold, is of very respectable antiquity--as is also the story of the\r\nhorse cut in two--attributed by Bebel to a locksmith. The locksmiths, he\r\ntells us in the parenthesis, are the boldest of Major Longbows.\r\n\r\nThere are many jests current in all languages, quizzing the vanity of\r\nhumble persons suddenly raised to some small dignity. 'Neebors, I am\r\nstill but a mon,' remarked the Scotchman, who became mayor.[6] Perhaps\r\ntheir type is latent in the '_De rustica praefecti uxore_--the village\r\nmagistrate's wife,--which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     'When a certain man had been made a prefect of a small village, he\r\n     bought his wife a new fur garment (_melotam_). She, proud of her\r\n     finery and full of her new honor, entered church, _capite elato et\r\n     superbo_, with her head raised, just as all the congregation rose\r\n     to their feet, when the Gospel was to be read. When she, thinking\r\n     it to be in her honor, and recollecting her former condition, said:\r\n     Sit still! I have not forgotten that I was once poor!'\r\n\r\nA very great proportion of the shrewd retorts and witty replies\r\nattributed to great men are very old. 'What do you think of soldiers\r\nwho can endure such wounds?' remarked Napoleon, when, showing a\r\nfrightfully scarred grenadier to an Englishman. 'What does your majesty\r\nthink of the men who gave the wounds?' was the reply. It is essentially\r\nthe remark of Louis the Bavarian, who, on enlisting four soldiers famed\r\nfor incredible bravery, and observing that they were scarred from head\r\nto foot, said to them: 'Ye are brave fellows; but I had rather see the\r\nmen _a quibus tot vulnera accepistis_--from whom ye received so many\r\nwounds.' The number of witty retorts and droll stories associated with\r\nthe names of Talleyrand, Piron, Voltaire--in fact, to a certain degree,\r\nof almost all great men--is so great as to almost persuade the reader\r\nwho wanders in the neglected field of ancient humor, that no man of the\r\nlater centuries was ever capable of a single witty and original thought.\r\nIt is not long since I met with an anecdote, stating that Alexandre\r\nDumas, who had a very unattractive wife, one day surprised a gentleman\r\nin the act of tenderly embracing her. In a compassionate and astonished\r\ntone the novelist exclaimed: 'Poor man! why do you act so? I am sure\r\nthat nobody could have compelled you to it against your will.' '_Eh!\r\nmonsieur, qui est-ce qui vous y obligeait?_' The jest is 'old as the\r\nhills'--it was old before Dumas was born. So, too, with the amusing bit\r\nof naivete attributed to an English duchess, who, to express her\r\ndeeply-seated religious prejudices, declared that she would sooner have\r\na dozen Protestant husbands than one Catholic. The same point is\r\nexpressed as follows, in a very witty but extremely wicked collection of\r\nfacetiae of the seventeenth century:[7]\r\n\r\n   Displicet, insignis, mihi Clericus ordo puella\r\n   Inquit et est valde gens odiosa mihi.\r\n   Malo decem certe me consociare colonis,\r\n   Unicum Clero quam coiisse velim.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton, and I know not how many other philosophers, have been\r\nmade to learn by a current story how to bear coals--literally. A learned\r\nman, it is said, being asked by a little girl for a live coal, offered\r\nto bring her a fire shovel. 'It is not necessary,' replied the child,\r\nand having laid cold ashes on her palm, she placed a glowing ember on\r\nthem and bore it away safely. 'With all my wisdom,' said the sage, 'I\r\nshould never have thought of that!' The jest is of mediaeval\r\nantiquity--possibly pre-Latin--it was in later days, however, versified\r\nby Schurrias--an extremely aged and dying woman being substituted for\r\nthe learned man.\r\n\r\n   'Nam nuda poteris ignea ferre manu?\r\n   Parva puella refert: mater, perizomate prunas\r\n   Portabo flammae ne nocuisse queant.\r\n   Quid facies igitur, Anus inquit? Serviet hicce\r\n   Mi cinis, illa refert; quo super hasce feram.\r\n   Mox exclamat Anus: disco, moriorque profecto.\r\n   En disco moriens quae latuere senem:\r\n         _O, ich lern und stirb_!'\r\n\r\nA very great number of the 'good stories' current at the present day\r\nwith new names and faces, are to be found in the works of Rabelais, and\r\nin the _Moyen Parvenir_, now generally attributed to him. It is almost\r\nneedless to say that few of these were however original with the great\r\nFrench humorist. We find them in the Macaronics of Merlin Coccaius, and\r\nin scores of older authorities. Still it must be borne in mind that a\r\nsimilarity does not always establish an identity. There are few persons\r\nwho cannot cite some droll instance of a sharper or greedy fellow, who,\r\nexpecting an undeserved reward for some sham service, has found himself\r\ndrolly overreached. So Rabelais dresses up for us anew the fable of the\r\nwoodman, who, having lost his hatchet, and wearied Jupiter with prayers\r\nfor its recovery, was tempted by Mercury with a golden hatchet, and\r\nasked if it were the missing article. He answering 'No,' received the\r\nprecious one for reward. Which being made known, excited great hopes\r\namong his neighbors of becoming rich by the same means:\r\n\r\n     'Ha, ha! said they--was there no more to do but to lose a hatchet\r\n     to make us rich? Now for that; it is as easy as ----, and will\r\n     cost us but little. Are then at this time of the year the\r\n     revolutions of the heavens, the constellations of the firmament and\r\n     aspects of the planets such that whosoever shall lose a hatchet,\r\n     shall immediately grow rich? Ha, ha, ha! by Jove you shall even be\r\n     lost and it please you, my dear hatchet! With this they all fairly\r\n     lost their hatchets out of hand. The devil of a one that had a\r\n     hatchet left; he was not his mother's son that did not lose his\r\n     hatchet. No more was wood felled or cleared in that country,\r\n     through want of hatchets. Nay, the Aesopian apologue even saith,\r\n     that certain petty country gents of the lower class who had sold\r\n     the Woodman their little mill and little field to have wherewithal\r\n     to make a figure at the next muster, having been told that his\r\n     treasure was come to him by this only means, sold the only badge of\r\n     their gentility, their swords, to purchase hatchets to go lose\r\n     them, as the silly clodpates did, in hopes to gain store of chink\r\n     by that loss.\r\n\r\n     'You would have truly sworn they had been a parcel of your petty\r\n     spiritual usurers, Rome-bound, selling their all, and borrowing of\r\n     others to buy store of mandates,--a penny-worth of a new-made pope.\r\n\r\n     'Now they cried out and brayed, and prayed and bawled, and invoked\r\n     Jupiter: 'My hatchet! my hatchet! Jupiter, my hatchet! on this\r\n     side, my hatchet! on that side, my hatchet! ho, ho, ho, ho,\r\n     Jupiter, my hatchet!' The air round about rung with the cries and\r\n     howlings of these rascally losers of hatchets.\r\n\r\n     'Mercury was nimble in bringing them hatchets; to each offering\r\n     that which he had lost, as also another of gold, and a third of\r\n     silver.\r\n\r\n     'Every _he_ was still for that of gold, giving thanks in abundance\r\n     to the great giver Jupiter; but in the very nick of time, that they\r\n     bowed and stooped to take it from the ground, whip, in a trice,\r\n     Mercury chopped off their heads, as Jupiter had commanded; and of\r\n     heads thus cut off the number was just equal to that of the lost\r\n     hatchets.'\r\n\r\nThis is but a small portion of the fable as amplified by Rabelais; but\r\nwhat is cited illustrates the _accretive_ power of a jest when it\r\ninvolves a principle of general application. The same idea--that of\r\nroguery rewarded according to the letter--is involved in an anecdote,\r\nwhich tells us that a certain alchemist having dedicated to Pope Leo the\r\nTenth a book containing the whole art of making gold, received as\r\nrecompense a great empty purse, with the words: 'If thou canst make\r\ngold, thou art far richer than I; but herein is a purse wherein thou\r\nmayest put thy gold.'\r\n\r\nIn the German _Lallenbuch_, as well as other works, we find the story of\r\nthe stupid fellow who, coming to the banks of a river, waited long and\r\nin vain until the water should all have rolled by. It is given in the\r\nfollowing form in a very droll collection of jests:[8]\r\n\r\n     'Rustici cujusdam filius a patre in proximam urbem missus, quum ad\r\n     flumen aliquod pervenisset, diu dum integrum deflueret, sicque\r\n     transitum praeberet, expectans, tandem ubi continuo aquam fluere\r\n     vidit, domum reversus est, de eo quod sibi accidisset, parentibus\r\n     conquestus.'\r\n\r\nBut the story was old, centuries before the monks--for even Horace sums\r\nit up in two verses as one quotes a well-known popular proverb:\r\n\r\n   'Rusticus exspectat dum defluat amnis: at ille\r\n   Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum.'\r\n\r\n   'The clown awaits until the flood be gone:\r\n   It glides and whirls for ages ever on.'\r\n\r\nThe reader has probably heard of the apocryphal twelfth commandment,\r\n'Mind your own business.' Possibly its existence was suggested by the\r\ndiscovery of the _first_, told as follows in the _Democritus Ridens_.\r\n\r\n     'A certain soldier being asked by his pastor what was the first\r\n     commandment given by GOD, replied, 'Thou shalt not eat!' At which\r\n     answer the priest inquiring what he meant, received for reply that\r\n     this was the first command to our first parents relative to the\r\n     apple. _Quo audito, Pastor conticuit!_ Which having heard, the\r\n     priest was silent.'\r\n\r\nOf the same family or parentage is the modern story of the clergyman\r\nwho, wishing to preach against the extravagant head-dresses worn by the\r\nwomen of his congregation, took for a text, 'Top knot come down!'\r\nreferring for his authority to Matthew xxiv. 17. In like manner a not\r\nover-learned brother is said to have expounded Genesis, chap. xxii. v.\r\n23, as follows: 'These eight Milcah bear.' This shows us, my brethren,\r\nwhat hard times they had of old, when it took eight on 'em to milk a bar\r\n(and I 'spose get mighty little at that), when nowadays my darter kin\r\nmilk a cow with nary help, as easy as look at her.'\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the Irishman crossing the brook. 'Sure, Paddy, if\r\nye carry me, don't I carry the barrel of whiskey, an' isn't that fair\r\nand aiquil?' It is differently told in one of the old Latin jest books,\r\nwhere a certain Piero, pitying his weary jackass, which bore a heavy\r\nplough, took the latter on his own shoulders, and mounting the donkey,\r\nsaid: '_Nune procedere poteris, non enim tu sed ego aratrum\r\nfero_,'--'Now you may go along, for not you but I now bear the plough.'\r\nNot a few of the jokes given to modern Irishmen originated centuries ago\r\nin other countries than theirs. The reader may recall the advice given\r\nby an Emeralder to another at a tavern, when the latter found that his\r\nboiled egg was ready to hatch. 'Down wid it, Murphy, ye divil, before\r\nthe landlord comes in and charges ye for a _chicken breakfast_!' The\r\nsame occurs as an old Latin joke, with this difference, that, in the\r\nlatter, the companion, when the breakfast was over, required that the\r\nchicken eater should pay the reckoning for both. '_Ni facis, dicam\r\ncauponi de pullo quem pro ovo absumpsisti, et solves largius._' 'Unless\r\nyou do, I will tell the landlord of the chicken which you ate for an\r\negg, and _then_ see what a bill you'll have to pay.'\r\n\r\nThe Germans of the present day have a story of a certain Englishman who,\r\non being told that his coat was burning, politely replied: 'What the\r\ndevil business is that of yours? I have seen your coat burning this half\r\nhour, and never bothered myself about it.' Tom Brown tells us of a\r\nroguish boy who said to a traveller, warming his feet at a fire: 'Take\r\ncare, sir, or you'll burn your spurs!' 'My boots! you mean,' quoth the\r\ntraveller. 'No, sir, I mean your spurs; your boots be burned already.'\r\nBut the best form of the joke is given by Erasmus in his Adages, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     'A certain traveller in Holland lay so near the fire that his cloak\r\n     was scorched. Which being observed by a guest, he said to the\r\n     sleeper, 'Here--I want to tell you something!' To which the other\r\n     replied: 'If it is bad news, put it off, for I don't wish to hear\r\n     any in company where all should be jolly. _Post convivium, inquit,\r\n     seria_--'save up the sorrow until after supper.' And when they had\r\n     merrily supped, 'Now,' said he, 'I am ready to hear it.' Then the\r\n     other showed him and immense hole in his cloak, and he began to\r\n     rage that he had not been warned of it in time. 'I wished to do\r\n     so,' replied the guest meekly, 'but you forbade me.'\r\n\r\nThe witty sayings of men about to be executed are numerous, but are in\r\nmany cases far from being original or authentic. During the horrors of\r\nthe French Revolution, when men 'became so accustomed to death that they\r\nlost all respect for it,' it became the fashion to make a jest with the\r\nlast breath, and it is said that a volume of these sayings was collected\r\nand published. In the _Democritus Ridens_, already referred to, under\r\nthe head of _Jocus sub necem_, the author gives several anecdotes, more\r\nthan one of which has been attributed in modern times to some noted\r\ncriminal:\r\n\r\n     'Those condemned to death are not infrequently so excited and\r\n     confused as to lose their wits and joke most improperly. As an\r\n     example, take that man who, when standing on the scaffold, said\r\n     with a smile to the judge who was present: 'I wonder, old fellow,\r\n     that you with such a turned-up nose can see anything!'\r\n\r\n     'Another when about to die asked for a parting cup. A goblet of\r\n     beer was brought, from which he carefully blew away the froth,\r\n     saying that it was 'unhealthy and conducive to the gravel.'\r\n\r\n     'Another on the way to the gallows, seeing a crowd hastening\r\n     forward, said to them: 'There is no need of hurrying, children;\r\n     even though you go as slowly as I, for depend upon it, the thing\r\n     will not come off till I get there.'\r\n\r\n     'Another on quitting the prison, turning to his jailor, said\r\n     privately: 'You needn't keep the house open beyond the usual time\r\n     this evening on my account, for I shall not return.''\r\n\r\n     'Another is said, when about to be shipwrecked, to have called for\r\n     salt meat. And being asked why? replied: 'Because I shall soon have\r\n     to drink more than I ever did in all my life.' _O ridiculos et o\r\n     insanos homunculos!_ adds the old writer: 'O foolish and mad worms\r\n     of men who could thus joke at the very opening instant of\r\n     eternity!''\r\n\r\nThis last instance of dying recklessness has been used by Rabelais as\r\none of the jests of Panurge. Much like it is the anecdote to the effect\r\nthat in a storm at sea, when the sailors were all at prayers, expecting\r\nevery moment to go to the bottom, a passenger appeared quite\r\nunconcerned. The captain asked him how he could be so much at his ease\r\nin this awful situation. 'Sir,' said the passenger, 'my life is\r\ninsured.'\r\n\r\nSomewhat allied to this spirit of blindness was the remark of the Greek\r\nto his slave during a terrible storm at sea. Seeing the latter weeping,\r\nhe exclaimed, 'Why are you so troubled--I give you your freedom?' And\r\nallied to it is the well-known epigram:\r\n\r\n   'It blew a hard storm and in utmost confusion\r\n   The sailors all hurried to get absolution;\r\n   Which done, and the weight of the sins they confessed\r\n   Was conveyed, as they thought, from themselves to the priest:\r\n   To lighten the ship and conclude their devotion,\r\n   They tossed the poor parson souse into the ocean.'\r\n\r\nOne of the coarse jokes current with the last generation was that of a\r\nsailor who, when a duke with his lady was on board ship, and all\r\nexpected soon to be lost, asked the mate if he had ever lain with a\r\nduchess? The other answering in fear and trembling, 'no,' was told by\r\nthe reckless fellow: 'Well, we shall all have that pleasure soon.' The\r\nship, however, was saved, and the sailor being asked by the duke what he\r\nmeant by his insulting remark, replied: 'At the bottom of the sea, your\r\ngrace, we all lie low in death together.' And he was pardoned. It is\r\nremarkable that in all ages wit has been suffered to save men when\r\nbetter qualities would perhaps be of no avail.\r\n\r\nWe may class with these jests of men _in articulo mortis_ the droll\r\nstory told by Bebelius, to the effect that a certain duke having caught\r\na miller in the act of stealing, asked his victim as he stood beneath\r\nthe gallows, to swear by his faith if he believed that there was on\r\nearth a single man of his calling who was honest. To which the miller\r\nstoutly swore that to his knowledge there was not one who was not a\r\ngreater thief than himself. 'If that be the case,' replied his judge,\r\n'go in peace and live while you may, for I had rather be robbed by you\r\nthan by some more rapacious rascal of your trade.'\r\n\r\nAn excellent illustration of the fact that old stories are frequently\r\nrevamped to suit new times and men, may be found in the following\r\n'original,' also given by Bebelius, as _Pulchrum factum cujusdam militis\r\nTubigentis_--a fine deed of a certain soldier of Tuebingen:\r\n\r\n     'Conrad Buhel of Tuebingen, distinguished by his bravery among the\r\n     captains of Caesar Maximilian in the Hungarian campaign, was, once\r\n     in camp, lying on the straw and expecting no evil, when there\r\n     entered another soldier to whom Conrad had done an injury. Who,\r\n     when he found him thus lying on his back, said with that noble\r\n     magnanimity characteristic of the German mind: 'Wert thou not lying\r\n     helpless, I would stab thee with my sword!' To which Conrad\r\n     replied: 'Wilt thou do me no injury until I stand up and am ready\r\n     for fight?' 'Not I,' replied his foe, 'for I hold it base to strike\r\n     an unarmed man.' 'Then,' replied Conrad, 'I shall lie still all\r\n     night.' But on the next day he transfixed the other with his\r\n     spear.'\r\n\r\nThe same story is told of an eminent Irish lawyer, who had offended the\r\nclient of a rival pleader. 'Will ye get up till I bate yees?' 'An' would\r\nye strike a man lying down?' 'Divil a bit!' 'Then I'll jist go to slape\r\nagain.' In the modern stories the foes are reconciled--in the old camp\r\nincident all is fierce and characteristic of the bloody feuds of the\r\nmiddle ages, and the final murder of the great-hearted enemy strikes us\r\nwith a pang. The _sed postri die alterum cuspide transfixit_ seems\r\nbrutal and ungenerous; but the event, whether literally true or feigned,\r\nhad no such discord to the readers of those days. It was more essential\r\nto establish the thorough bravery of Conrad, than to reward the\r\nmagnanimity of his foe. Truly, the history of jests is the history of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this transmission of the renown of stories of the olden\r\ntimes to lawyers of the later day, we may cite the well-known incident\r\nof the honest criminal who, travelling alone on foot, was met by Sir\r\nMatthew Hale, and in answer to the questions of the latter, admitted\r\nthat he was going to a distant court to be tried for his life. The same\r\nnoble truthfulness is beautifully set forth in the following, _Pulchra\r\nhistoria simplicis praetoris et furis_, or 'Fine Story of a\r\nSimple-hearted Superintendent and Thief.'\r\n\r\n     'My lord of Stoeffel, of that free and excellent nobility which\r\n     are called barons, had a superintendent of his serfs. And he, when\r\n     a certain man was accused of theft, and condemned by him to the\r\n     torture of the cross (_ad crucis tormentum damnasset_), with rustic\r\n     simplicity sent the criminal to the church that he might confess\r\n     his sins, first taking his word that he would return after\r\n     confession. So he entered the shrine, confessed, and not heeding\r\n     the privilege of ecclesiastical immunity (i. e., the right of\r\n     sanctuary), 'whereby he might have escaped, kept his faith with the\r\n     superintendent (_fidem praetori servavit_), and again returning\r\n     underwent extreme punishment. And this I knew from my boyhood, that\r\n     he went up to the place of punishment with such alacrity, that it\r\n     would seem as if he truly desired death. But many curses were\r\n     lavished on the priest to whom he confessed, because he did not\r\n     warn the imprudent man not to quit the bounds of ecclesiastical\r\n     freedom!'\r\n\r\nThere is a whole ballad--nay, a whole history of the middle ages in this\r\nstory; for among thousands I can recall none as perfectly characteristic\r\nof the times. The absolute aristocratic control of the life of a white\r\nslave; its abuse by transferring it to the arbitrary will of an upper\r\nservant; the blind devotion to feudal service shown in the fidelity of\r\nthe poor serf, the horrible cruelty of his punishment; and finally, the\r\ncowardly supple fawning of the local priesthood, who were always either\r\nworms or dragons in their relations to the nobility, are all set forth\r\nhere in a few lines.\r\n\r\nI have said that the eminent lawyers of modern times are greatly favored\r\nin the inheritance of old jokes. Judge Jeffries, we are told, in\r\nexamining an old fellow with a long beard, told him he supposed he had a\r\nconscience quite as long as that natural ornament of his visage. 'Does\r\nyour lordship measure consciences by beards?' said the man; 'that is\r\nstrange, seeing you yourself are shaven.' Among the monk-Latin tales\r\nthere is one to the effect that a certain _pater_, priding himself on\r\nhis beard, was informed that in a convent of he-goats he certainly\r\ndeserved to be abbot. The same story, re-made into a gross form, is\r\ncurrent in this country, and attributed to an eminent Virginia\r\npolitician. In the _Antidotum Melancholiae_ (Frankfort, 1667), it is\r\ngiven in the form of an evidently very old Latin rhyme:\r\n\r\n   'Si bene barbatum faceret sua barba beatum,\r\n   Nullus in hoc circo fuerit felicior hireo.'\r\n\r\nThere is a modern story current in America, which is often\r\ncircumstantially narrated, of some individual wearing a fine beard or\r\n'whiskers,' and who is said to have sold them to a vulgar practical\r\njoker, who had one shaved off, but suffered the other to remain for a\r\nlong time on the face of his victim, annoying him meantime with\r\ninquiries as to 'my whisker.' It is the true type of a great number of\r\nstories which originated in the Southern and South-Western United\r\nStates, the point of which almost invariably turns on vexing, grieving,\r\nor maltreating some victim, who is an inferior as regards wit, fortune,\r\nor physique. It is worth remarking that the only really original and\r\ncharacteristic class of jokes which the slave States originated are\r\nstrongly marked with that cruelty and vulgarity which naturally attend\r\nthe morbidly vain and semi-civilized man, who is so unfortunate as to\r\nhave inferiors by fortune entirely in his power. I would ask the reader\r\nin confirmation of this to simply turn over the large collection of\r\n'Georgia Major' and 'Simon Suggs' tales, which, emanating from the\r\nSouth, have contributed so much to brutalize and vulgarize the humorous\r\ntendencies of that portion of the more Northern public which reads them.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the story of the half shaven beard. It also is a very\r\nold one, being told in its original form as _Barba deceptus\r\nJudaeus_--'The Jew deceived by a beard,' and is as follows:\r\n\r\n     'A nobleman of Frankfort, while being shaved in a barber's shop,\r\n     was summoned by a Jew to whom he owed money. But at the request of\r\n     his debtor the Jew consented to forego the arrest until the\r\n     nobleman's beard should be shaved. Upon which the latter departed\r\n     unshorn, and ever remained so.'\r\n\r\nThe old story--Jews, Cogots, serfs, negroes--the outwitting,\r\npersecuting, and swindling some outlawed class of poor helpless victims,\r\nwho have been made worse than they should be by oppression. This\r\nanecdote--like that of the free lance Conrad--is a sad epitome of the\r\nmiddle ages, and to us of the present day, it rings like a curse on the\r\nolden time, in the form of a diabolical jest. It is, however, bitterest\r\nof all, to find the oppressed--as in the stories illustrating mere\r\n_feudal_ fidelity,--so utterly degraded as to actually take part with\r\ntheir oppressors and with the foes of humanity, against their own\r\nrights. So, in this present struggle with that incarnation of evil, and\r\nof the old devilish feudal oppression, the Confederate South, we are\r\nstill pained to find among its adherents men, who, having been socially\r\ntrampled on in Europe, seek, by sheer force of slavish habit, masters to\r\nlord it over them here. There is but one type of man who is more\r\npitiable--it is he who is recreant to the great cause of freedom for the\r\nsake of--money!\r\n\r\nA brutal and disgraceful jest-story, which stands in close relation to\r\nthis last, is that of _Detrimentum barbae propter Sanctos_;' or, 'losing\r\na beard for the saints,' which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     'A Hebrew contending with a Catholic, affirmed there were more\r\n     Jewish saints in Heaven than Christian. It was thereupon agreed\r\n     that each should name his saints in turn, and as he named, pluck a\r\n     hair from the beard of his adversary.\r\n\r\n     'Abraham,' said the Jew, and plucked a hair.\r\n\r\n     'Saint Peter,' said the Christian.\r\n\r\n     'Isaac.'\r\n\r\n     'Saint Paul.'\r\n\r\n     And so they kept up their litanies, until the 'Christian,'\r\n     exclaiming: 'Saint Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins!' tore\r\n     out the whole beard of the Jew by the roots, to the great laughter\r\n     of all standing around.'\r\n\r\nIt would matter but little, that a fanatical and brutal crowd of the\r\nmiddle ages had laughed at seeing 'only a Jew' disgraced and dripping\r\nwith blood, to point a scurvy jest. But, I confess that it struck me as\r\nsingular, when I once found this story in a memoir, set down as having\r\nbeen narrated by an eminent Christian philosopher (now not long dead),\r\nas a capital thing. Granting its humor, is it worth while to inquire if\r\nhe would have enjoyed it as much, had the Jew torn out the beard of the\r\nChristian in the name of the thousands who had been martyred for the\r\nfaith of Israel?\r\n\r\nThe jokes of the middle ages on the subject of the beard, were\r\nnumerous--it was a favorite ornament, as we may judge from the fact that\r\nEberhard, the far-famed old warlike duke, sung in more than one poem by\r\nUhland, is always spoken of in the old stories, as _noster princeps\r\nbarbatus_, 'our bearded prince,' or, more familiarly, simply as 'our\r\nbearded one.' One of the table problems of the day was, '_Potestne\r\nprobari mulierem quandam habuisse barbam?_'--'Can it be proved that any\r\nwoman ever had a beard?' The answer to which, was, 'Yes--when Judith\r\nbore the head of Holofernes.' It was singular that such a question could\r\nhave been agitated, when the legends of the saints contained the story\r\nof the bearded saintess of the Tyrol--a converted ballet-dancer, who was\r\nthus rendered hideous in accordance with her prayer, that she might be\r\nmade so repulsive as to frighten away all lovers. And yet Mr. Barnum's\r\nBearded Lady had a husband!\r\n\r\nJokes ridiculing red beards and heads were common in the old time;\r\nprobably because a popular tradition declared that Judas, 'the arch\r\nrascal,' was so marked by nature. The anecdote of the good clergyman who\r\nnever laughed but once in church, and that was, when he saw a youth\r\ntrying to light a cigar, or warm his hands at a certain ruddy poll,\r\nfinds its prototype in one of the old Latin stories:\r\n\r\n     'Our country people are wont to say, when they see a red-headed\r\n     man; 'he would make a bad chimney-sweeper.' And when the reason is\r\n     asked, they say: 'when his head came out of the chimney the country\r\n     folks would think it was fire, and would ring the bells, assemble\r\n     from every direction, and cause all the riot and trouble incident\r\n     to a conflagration.'\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting in this connection, that the prejudice against red\r\nhair is rapidly being forgotten among cultivated persons, and is far\r\nfrom being what it was within the memory of man. The vulgar, who are the\r\nlast to abandon an absurdity, still retain a few jokes on the subject;\r\nbut these will probably be as unintelligible in time, as would be the\r\njests of the middle ages on the _rufa tunica_, or red frock. The\r\nboorishness and cruelty of 'the good old times,' are strongly reflected\r\nin the following, which a scholar of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies was not ashamed to record of himself:\r\n\r\n     'When lately during Lent, in the year 1506, we had several guests,\r\n     among them a rustic from Weilsberg, who wore a long red beard. I\r\n     asked him why he did so? and he replied, 'out of grief for the\r\n     death of his father-in-law.' To which I replied: 'All wrong, for\r\n     red is a color suited to rejoicing'--at which remark all the guests\r\n     present began to laugh immoderately. But he with his rustic\r\n     simplicity, being made ashamed, answered: 'Yes, sir--that is very\r\n     true, and yet I assure you that I feel as sorrowful in this red\r\n     beard as any other man does in his black one.'\r\n\r\nThe man who does not--though three and a half centuries lie\r\nbetween--sympathize with the sad, honest simplicity of the poor\r\nred-bearded mourner, must be as gross and heartless as was the narrator\r\nof the incident. It gives one, indeed, strange subject for reflection,\r\nto pause among these old trifles of a by-gone day; jotted down for\r\npassing time in a rude age, and yet preserved so clearly, cut and\r\nfreshly colored in the modern time! Conrad Buehel, the free lance, and\r\nhis enemy--the red-bearded mourner, the Baron von Stoeffel and his\r\npraetor, with the simple minded thief, and timid priests, and the genial\r\nbut coarse scholar, Bebelius himself, were all real men in their day,\r\nwho might have passed away without the slightest link to bind their\r\nnames or natures to an after age--and now they live in a jest! Still\r\nthey live--and it may be that when the page which you now peruse, O\r\nreader, shall be as old as the yellow leaves of the sixteenth century\r\nvolume now before me, some one may revive them again. It is something to\r\nbe near a scholar now and then, for no one knows who once crosses his\r\npath, but that he too may be noted down, to be borne by an anecdote\r\nacross stormy centuries, into ages all unlike our own. No man ever yet\r\ndied out of a printed book.\r\n\r\nMany a happy thought dashed off by a modern writer, is only the adroit\r\nplagiarism of an old joke, 'But oh, the Latin!' says Heinrich Heine, in\r\ndescribing his boyish sorrows to a lady--'Madame, you can really have no\r\nidea of what a mess it is. The Romans would never have found time to\r\nconquer the world, if they had been first obliged to learn Latin. Lucky\r\ndogs! they already knew in their cradles the nouns ending in _im_.' This\r\nis a very adroit theft from the _Epistolarum Obscurorum Virorum_,\r\nattributed to Von Huetten and others, in which a stupid monk, having\r\nargued with Erasmus, writes as follows to his master:\r\n\r\n     'Then our host, who is a good scholar, began to talk of poetry, and\r\n     greatly praised JULIUS CAESAR in his writings and deeds. Now when I\r\n     heard this I was specially delighted that I had read so much, and\r\n     that I had heard you lecture on poetry in Cologne, and I said:\r\n     'Since you speak of poetry, I can no longer keep quiet, and I tell\r\n     you plainly that I do not believe that CAESAR wrote those\r\n     commentaries; and I strengthened my assertion with this argument:\r\n     'He who has his business in war and in constant labors, cannot\r\n     learn Latin. Now, CAESAR was always in wars or in great toils,\r\n     therefore he could not be erudite, or learn Latin.' I think,\r\n     however, that SUETONIUS wrote those Commentaries, for I never saw\r\n     any writer whose style so much resembles that of CAESAR, as does\r\n     that of SUETONIUS.'\r\n\r\nWho has not heard the story of the hackney coachman, who, at the end of\r\nthe day, was wont to divide his gains into 'half for master and half for\r\nme,' when the whole should have been given to the proprietor? Or of the\r\nAmerican public functionary, who said that his annual gains were 'one\r\nthousand dollars salary, besides the cheatage and stealage?' Both seem\r\nto me to be foreshadowed in the following '_Sacerdotis jocus non\r\nillepidus_';\r\n\r\n     'A certain priest named FYSILINUS who begged for a convent of Saint\r\n     Sebastian, being asked what his annual salary was, replied: 'Twenty\r\n     gold crowns!' 'Little enough!' answered the other. To which\r\n     FYSILINUS replied: 'Various, however, are the emoluments of\r\n     mortals; for I have also what is given to me, and what I steal. And\r\n     very good is Saint Sebastian, who, whatever division I make with\r\n     him, is always silent and contented.'\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that this story and thousands which bore much more\r\nseverely on the priests, were current for centuries before the\r\nReformation. There were many anecdotes of this priest, all to his\r\ndiscredit, many of which were attributed, at a later day, to other\r\nunworthy monks. Among these, a very dull one is interesting, as\r\nconnecting him with Eberhard, 'our bearded prince,' already referred to.\r\nHaving begged of this truly noble man a benefice, Eberhard, who was\r\naware of his character, replied: 'If I had a thousand vacant, you should\r\nnot have the least of them.'--'_Si mille, inquit, mihi beneficia, ego\r\nminimum tibi non conferrem._' To which Fysilinus impudently replied:\r\n'And if I should hold divine service a thousand times, I would never\r\nbear you in mind, nor pray once for your salvation.'\r\n\r\nI have attempted in the foregoing remarks to set forth, or rather\r\nillustrate, the manner in which modern jests have flown directly or\r\nindirectly, from those of earlier generations; and have, in so doing,\r\ncalled attention to a rare and curious class of humorous books, which\r\nhave been but little cited for more than two centuries. The principal\r\npoint which I would most gladly make clear, is the fact that in\r\nliterature and the history of culture, there are two classes of critics:\r\nthe ultra-modern and the ultra-conservative, both of whom are in the\r\nwrong. The one cries that every flash of genius is new, and that an old\r\njest is an old abomination--the other vows that there is nothing new\r\nunder the sun, and that every good story is hidden away, in all its\r\nexcellence, somewhere in the storehouse of the past. Examination is,\r\nhowever, like Pietro D'Abano, always a _Conciliator_. We find the\r\noriginal _thema_ in the past, often reduced to the careless illustration\r\nof some principle or characteristic common to all humanity; but when we\r\nfollow it down to the present, it becomes varied, improved, and enlarged\r\ninto whole groups and families of new anecdotes, poems, jests, or\r\nproverbs; any single member of which is, perhaps, better than the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nThe history of jests can, in turn, be made to furnish an extremely vivid\r\nand curious history of the social conditions of men, and their changes\r\nfrom the earliest ages--not to be surpassed in value by that of any\r\nother peculiarities. In nothing is a man so much himself as in his\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Erneuerte und vermehrte Lustige Gesellschaft (_Comes\r\nfacundus in via pro vehiculo_), von JOHANN PETRO DE MEMEL, Zippelzerbst\r\nim Droembling.

Boston: John Wilson & Son. 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the past two years we have met with two pamphlets referring to\r\nthe negro question during the days of the Revolution--the one being a\r\nreprint with comments of the celebrated Laurens letter,[9] the other\r\ncontaining information as to the part taken by blacks in the\r\nstruggle.[10] We inferred from these works that much remained to be\r\ntold, and find our surmise verified by an examination of the neatly\r\nprinted octavo of 215 pages, now before us, in which is given a mass of\r\ninformation, fully establishing the fact that the negro played no mean\r\npart in the army of the Revolution, and, we may add, suggesting the\r\nreflection that he may only need proper encouragement to do as much,\r\nagain, unless he should have strangely deteriorated from the original\r\nstock of his ancestry. Such a work as this, thorough and full of plain\r\nfacts, telling their own story, was greatly needed, and we congratulate\r\nall who are interested in the future of this country on its appearance.\r\nPublished under the auspices of the Massachusetts Historical Society,\r\nand warmly approved by EDWARD EVERETT and the venerable JOSIAH QUINCY,\r\nthe work in question possesses, of course, the highest claim to\r\nconsideration as a well written and perfectly digested _resume_ of its\r\nsubject. It is curious to observe, from its documentary proofs, how\r\nfully the slave-holding arguments of the present day were once negatived\r\nby the experience of the past; and it is almost bitterly amusing that\r\nmen can learn so little from experience, and that in one generation the\r\ndense clouds of ignorance should gather so thickly over a subject of the\r\nmost vital importance to the country.\r\n\r\nFrom this work we may learn that 'no language of radical reformers in\r\nrecent times surpasses in severity the honest utterances' of the first\r\nmen of the Revolution on the subject of slavery. It is worth knowing\r\nwhat Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, Laurens, Pinckney, Randolph, Sherman,\r\nand a host of others said--to realize that slavery was regarded by them\r\nas a curse; and it is grievous to learn that 'circumstances,' local\r\nfeuds, and bewildering side-issues should have interfered to prevent\r\n'abolition' at a time when it might have been safely carried out. The\r\nvast amount of historical research on this subject, and its results, are\r\nwell set forth by Mr. Livermore; and had his work been limited to these\r\nchapters alone, it should have won him a distinguished place among those\r\nwho have cast a light as of life upon the obscure difficulties which now\r\nbeset the great question. More encouraging and extremely interesting is\r\nthat second portion of the work which gives the opinions of the founders\r\nof the republic respecting negroes as soldiers, and facts establishing\r\ntheir military ability. That the first fight of the Revolution should\r\nhave been led by a negro, who was its first martyr, is of itself deeply\r\nsignificant: so is the fact that the most remarkable incident at Bunker\r\nHill--the death of Pitcairn--was due to the bullet of a brave black\r\nsoldier. With the exception of the two Tory States, Georgia and South\r\nCarolina, blacks, _slave_ blacks, were enlisted from all the States in\r\ngreat numbers, and fought well. It is remarkable that in the beginning\r\nthe same absurd objections to employing them were raised as those which\r\nstill abound in our 'Democratic' press; and it was not, indeed, until\r\nforced by stern experience and dire need, that 'the States' found out\r\nthe folly of their prejudice.\r\n\r\nAll of these data in the history of slavery, and with them several of\r\nminor importance, are remarkably well set forth in the present volume,\r\nwhich may fairly claim to be the first work on the subject ever\r\npublished--the 'Historical Notes' already referred to having been\r\nsuggested, as we are told, by Mr. Livermore himself, and forming an\r\n_avant courier_ to the 'Historical Research.' It is needless to say that\r\nwe commend it with our whole heart to all who would study the question\r\nof negro slavery from the beginning in this republic, and know, what few\r\ndo, the extent and importance of the early troubles on the subject, or\r\nsettle for themselves the greatly vexed question whether negroes, when\r\ntreated as men, will or will not fight. It is all there.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LIKE AND UNLIKE. By A. S. ROE. New York: Carleton. Boston: A. K.\r\n     Loring.\r\n\r\nMr. Roe's novels are of the manufactured kind. Like those of many others\r\nwho are in the business, they give the impression that they are easily\r\nwritten, and might possibly be turned out by a machine, had invention\r\nprogressed a little farther than it has. Still his _pieces de\r\nmanufacture_ are very good of their kind, and sell very well--like the\r\nmoral romances in China, which are disposed of by weight and in\r\nfragments, in such vast quantities, and which are so entirely a matter\r\nof mere pastime that the authors never think it worth while to affix\r\ntheir names to them. _Like and Unlike_ may be safely intrusted by the\r\nmost fastidious aunt to the most unsophisticated of nieces--and it is\r\nnot unlikely that the niece would greatly enjoy its perusal. It is by no\r\nmeans devoid of interest, and indicates in many particulars that\r\nfamiliarity with the press which preserves any work of its nature--so\r\nfar as style is concerned--from harsh judgment. There are better\r\nbooks--but certainly there are thousands which are much worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n     TITAN. From the German of JEAN PAUL FRIEDRICH RICHTER, by CHARLES\r\n     T. BROOKS. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1863.\r\n\r\nTo many men JEAN PAUL has always been the greatest of German writers,\r\nhowever they might protest their preference for some other idol. CARLYLE\r\nknows and names GOETHE as the intellectual culmination of the past\r\nage--and yet shows in every sentence the influence of The Only One, with\r\nvery barren traces indeed of The Old Heathen; reminding us of those\r\ndevotees who profess a faith in GOD, but manifest it in the worship of\r\nsome congenial saint. At the present day, Richter, instead of being\r\noverrated, is neglected. Already thirty years ago HAUFF bewailed that\r\nhis works were not taken from public libraries; and yet it is as true as\r\never that he is, if not the greatest of German writers, at least the\r\nmost German among the great ones of his fatherland. And it is here that\r\nthe drawback lies--he carried to such excess all the peculiarities of\r\nhis very peculiar country, and was a giant of grotesqueness. No one can\r\nreally know German literature who knows not Jean Paul.\r\n\r\nThe work before us is Richter's masterpiece, which cost him ten years of\r\nlabor. We could sum up of his other writings some thousand or two of\r\npages which we read with more pleasure; yet still commend 'Titan' as the\r\nbest beginning and ending for those who intend to go through all of\r\nRichter's writings. It is a romance _sui generis_--in the world, and yet\r\nmost unworldly--full of unusual characters set forth in more unusual\r\nlanguage--refreshing and delightful to the initiate, and most wearisome\r\nto commonplace minds. As regards the merit of the translation, we can\r\nonly say that, having compared the first hundred pages with the\r\noriginal, we find them admirably and accurately rendered, and presume,\r\nof course, that the remainder is equally excellent. Will not Mr. Brooks\r\nat some future time give us a translation of Richter's _Vorschule der\r\nAEsthetik_, a work sadly needed by some of our art-critics?\r\n\r\n\r\n     LINES LEFT OUT; or, Some of the Histories left out in 'Line upon\r\n     Line.' New York: Harper & Brothers. 1863.\r\n\r\nA juvenile work with an extremely awkward title; 'Line upon Line' having\r\nbeen a collection of Bible stories, adapted to the capacity of children,\r\nof which book the present volume is a continuation. While we credit the\r\nauthor for the best intentions, we must, however, suggest that it would\r\nhave been better in every instance had the original text been given as\r\nwell as the paraphrase, unless, indeed, it be assumed that the Bible is\r\nunfit for children to read, or above their comprehension.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A South Carolina Protest againt Slavery.

It\r\nis natural enough--yet it is still most unreasonable--that there should\r\nbe so many who believe that every eddy and whirl should be its\r\ndeath-struggle or its final dart into the deep calm sea of safety. With\r\nevery battle lost or won there are thousands who despair or\r\nexult--forgetting that, come what may, the cause of human progress is\r\n_never backward_, and that we might as soon hope to recall the middle\r\nages as build up into prosperity the 'patriarchal' old slave South.\r\n\r\nEvery rebel's slave is free. Free on paper, if you will--theoretically\r\nfree; but is _that_ nothing? How many years will slavery, or the\r\nSouthern system in its integrity, exist side by side with a rapidly\r\ngrowing free country no longer recognizing the existence of 'the\r\ninstitution?' How many months, in fact, _when_ we shall have and\r\nhold--as we are absolutely determined to do--the whole west bank of the\r\nMississippi and the confederate ports; which, by the way, _should_ have\r\nall been secured at the outset at _any cost_? Let us win or lose in the\r\nfield, we shall still, thanks to our fleet, hem them in. And will not\r\n_that_, with mere waiting, prove a complete victory? Whatever financial\r\ncrises may be before the North, it will ever possess, in spite of the\r\nmost terrible sufferings, its enormous recuperative power, and its old\r\nability for hard work. But how is the exhausted, ruined South to arise,\r\nsave through Northern aid? Will its poor whites labor in factories? They\r\nare expected to form a permanent standing army. The negroes? The day of\r\nslavery is passing away rapidly. Let the South gain battles, if it\r\nwill--they are only defeats in disguise; and in the long run it will be\r\nfound that God willed this war to be long and bitter, that by it the\r\nlast stronghold of the wrongs of man might be the more thoroughly\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN ROD.\r\n\r\n   Upon the waves that rise and die\r\n     Along the banks of Severn's river,\r\n   Amidst the blue of broken sky,\r\n     I saw thy half-drawn image quiver\r\n   In changing gleams of golden light,\r\n   Now broadly spread, now vanished quite.\r\n\r\n   Late Golden Rod! in thought I deem\r\n     I still shall find thee swaying there,\r\n   As if some naiad of the stream\r\n     Gave to the wind her yellow hair,\r\n   Or, leaning o'er the margin, sought\r\n   The restless shape the waters wrought.\r\n\r\n   Though swaying, yet in quietude,\r\n     Thy beauty touched my very soul,\r\n   Like the calm eye of womanhood,\r\n     In stillness keeping all control.\r\n   And lo! as under sudden spell,\r\n   Thy presence shadowed all the dell.\r\n\r\n   The valley took October's crown,\r\n     I found thy glory still the same;\r\n   The sumach flung his red leaves down,\r\n     And lit his winter crest of flame;\r\n   The early elm and maple gave\r\n   Their burden to the patient wave.\r\n\r\n   I sought thee in the later year,\r\n     I sought, but found thee there no more;\r\n   Only a rigid stalk and sere\r\n     A withered head in silence bore,\r\n   Or swung, responsive to the sigh\r\n   Of the stray wind that passed it by.\r\n\r\n   Now Severn's banks in snow are still,\r\n     And Severn's stream is hushed and pale;\r\n   The sun shines on the whitened hill,\r\n     And glows like summer in the dale;\r\n   And yet I come, and half in gloom\r\n   And half in joy recall thy bloom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReader--do you want\r\n\r\nSOMETHING NEW FOR DINNER?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to refer to a cook book to know what an excellent\r\nfish is the sheep's-head; you may find it in Noah Webster's large\r\ndictionary, where it is described as \"the Sargus Ovis of Mitchell;\r\nesteemed delicious food\"; or, you can find it in market.\r\n\r\nMr. Withers was married to a lovely young lady who once worked an entire\r\npiano cover with worsted. They had commenced housekeeping but a few\r\nmonths, when one morning the husband informed his wife that he should\r\ninvite a friend to dine with him that day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Withers was in despair at this announcement, but she smiled and hid\r\nher grief; or at least her grief, in the shape of a Celtic cook, was at\r\nthat time not to be seen, being employed in the kitchen, where she had\r\ninvited two of her friends to \"come in and ate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Withers went down town; his wife then gave directions to the cook,\r\nBiddy O'Shaughshenny by name, to buy a sheep's-head, beef, game, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n'By the way, Bridget, have you ever cooked a sheep's-head before?'\r\n\r\n'A shape's hid is it? Then I'm thinking, ma'am, I've cooked the likes of\r\nthem minny a time and oft in the owld counthry when I bided with Mister\r\nMaginnis the grate counsillor in Dublin. I did.'\r\n\r\nThis was sufficient: Mrs. Withers was relieved of all care, and soon\r\nwended her way out shopping and making calls, until nearly the dinner\r\nhour. Home came Mr. Withers and friend, an Englishman by the name of\r\nMolesworth, with keen appetites. The dinner was served; oysters and soup\r\nfinished, the waiter brought on a large dish covered.\r\n\r\n'Ha, what have we here?' asked Withers, the husband.\r\n\r\n'Something new, my dear,' answered Withers, the wife. 'I knew they were\r\nin season, and I ordered it for a surprise.'\r\n\r\nWithers lifted the cover!\r\n\r\nThere WAS a sheep's head--with horns on.\r\n\r\nHowever a Sheep's Head is like a turbot--for a turbot--according to\r\nAlbert Smith's account of the Frenchman learning English--is not unlike\r\na _tire-botte_ (or a boot-jack) which _has_ horns. Is'nt _that_ a\r\nfrantic conciliation of differences, and one which might have done honor\r\nto Petrus d'Abano, the Conciliator, himself?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many conscientious men whose consciences tear at the first\r\npull--as is shown 'in the subsequent:'\r\n\r\nCONSCIENTIOUS.\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: Perhaps the following incident will cause a smile to\r\nripple the good-natured features of some of your readers:--In the county\r\nof M----, the Draft Commissioner held an extra appeal for the\r\n'conscientious men.' Now, in said county, there dwelt one Barney Mullen,\r\nwho, not being exempted at the first appeal, on 'non-citizenship'\r\ngrounds, was in 'great tribulation' in regard to the approaching draft.\r\nSome wag persuaded him to attend the second 'hearing,' telling him to\r\nswear that he was conscientious, and he would get his exemption papers.\r\nSo Barney was at hand at the 'appointed time and place,' At last, 'it\r\ncame to pass' that he got a hearing, and the Commissioner asked him what\r\nhe had to say for himself.\r\n\r\n'Shure, it's consyintious I am, an' exempted I want to be.'\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner had not forgotten Barney, so, to humor his whim, asked\r\nhim if he would take the affidavit, having first read that paper to him.\r\n\r\n'Afther David, the divil! It's me exemption papers I'm afther,' he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n'Have you conscientious scruples against fighting?' asked the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n'Och, it's the schrupils an' dhrams both I have.

D'yees take me fer a haythen?

It is divided into two great\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe first is of street signs.\r\n\r\nThe second of signs manual, optical, and otherwise by gesture\r\nsign-ificant.\r\n\r\nAn excellent illustration of this latter class was witnessed lately in a\r\npolice court of this city. I give it as narrated to me by a friend.\r\n\r\nA deaf mute, whose banged and battered face spoke for itself, lately\r\nappeared before a local magistrate to complain of the sufferings\r\ninflicted upon him by certain iniquitarians to ye court unknown.\r\n\r\n'He's deaf and dumb as a nadder, your honor,' remarked the solemn\r\npoliceman who introduced the silent man. 'But he kin tell his story\r\nbully.'\r\n\r\nAnd he did.\r\n\r\nStriking an attitude the dumb one pointed to his bruises, and then\r\nstruck out one, two and three _a la_ Heenan, to signify that his sorrows\r\nhad been caused by a pugilistic attack.\r\n\r\nThe court nodded its perfect comprehension of the business thus far.\r\n\r\nRaising the two fingers of his left hand, the mute bowed them up and\r\ndown, so that they seemed to be human beings with solidified legs,\r\nmaking salaams to the court.\r\n\r\nThe court nodded.\r\n\r\nThen the two fingers precipitated themselves fiercely against the\r\nforefinger of the right hand, which at once fell down, and was danced\r\nupon and bumped in a variety of ways by the inhuman digits of the\r\nsinister party.\r\n\r\nThe court nodded. It understood that the dumb man had been attacked by\r\ntwo persons.\r\n\r\nBut who were the two?\r\n\r\nElevating the forefinger of the left hand, the plaintiff first pointed\r\nto its face--or the place most suggestive of one, and then pressed his\r\nown nose flat.\r\n\r\nThe court nodded. One of the assaulters had been flat-nosed.\r\n\r\n'A nigger, your honor!' exclaimed the constable in breathless\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nRaising the second finger the dumb man after a second crossed his two\r\nforefingers, and made upon his breast the sign of the cross. It was\r\ncatholically done.\r\n\r\nThe court nodded.\r\n\r\n'An Irishman, your honor!' exclaimed the constable, who like the\r\ncomplainant argued very promptly from religion to nationality. An\r\nIrishman and a nigger--and I'll find out in ten minutes all about it.'\r\n\r\nAnd he did--a warrant was issued, and the guilty men punished.\r\n\r\n\"Thus he by gestes made knowne hys sufferance.\"\r\n\r\n                          Yours devoted,\r\n                                     JOT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\n   The drums are beat, the trumpets blow,\r\n   The black-mouthed cannon bay the foe,\r\n   Dark bristling o'er each murky height,\r\n   And all the field is whirled in fight.\r\n\r\n   The long life in the drowsy tent\r\n   Fades from me like a vision spent;--\r\n   I stand upon the battle's marge,\r\n   And watch the smoking squadron's charge.\r\n\r\n   Behold one starry banner reel\r\n   With that wild shock of steel on steel;\r\n   And ringing up by rock and tree\r\n   At last the cry that summons me.\r\n\r\n   I hear it in my vibrant soul,\r\n   Deep thundering back its counter roll;\r\n   And all life's ore seems newly wrought\r\n   In the white furnace of my thought.\r\n\r\n   No dream that made my days divine\r\n   But flashes back some mystic sign;\r\n   And every shape that erst was bright\r\n   Sweeps by me garmented in light.\r\n\r\n   High legends of immortal praise,\r\n   Brows of world heroes bound with bays,\r\n   The crowned majesties of Time\r\n   Rise visioned on my soul sublime.\r\n\r\n   Dear living lips of love and prayer\r\n   Come chanting through the blackened air;\r\n   And eyes look out of marble tombs,\r\n   And hands are waved from churchyard glooms.\r\n\r\n   \"Charge! charge!\" at last the captain's cry!\r\n   We pant, we speed, we leap, we fly;\r\n   I feel my lifting feet aspire,\r\n   As I were born of wind and fire!\r\n\r\n   On! on! where wild the battle swims,\r\n   On! on! no shade my vision dims;\r\n   Transcendent o'er yon smoky wreath,\r\n   I see the glory of great Death!\r\n\r\n   Come flashing blade, and hissing ball!\r\n   I give my blood, my breath, my all,\r\n   So that on yonder rocking height\r\n   The stars and stripes may wave to-night!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur Art writer is awakened. Listen to him.\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: You were kind enough to inform me that you would be\r\nmuch obliged if I would let you know if there was anything stirring in\r\nthe world of Art.\r\n\r\nThe last thing which stirred in my world--I mean in my workshop in the\r\nStudio Building--was a German of the carpenter persuasion. At least he\r\nhad a side pocket, and folding two-feet rule, with a shaving on his left\r\ncurl.\r\n\r\n'Bees you a poor-trait bainter?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n'Truly I am!' I replied.\r\n\r\n'I wants you to baint de likeness to my fader.'\r\n\r\n'With pleasure. Bring him here.'\r\n\r\n'Yas--see now, dat is not bossiple. He lies geburied in the purying\r\ncrount in Stuttgart in Shermany.'\r\n\r\n'Well, have you a photograph of him?'\r\n\r\n'_Nichtss_ photograb.'\r\n\r\n'Or a bust?'\r\n\r\n_Nichts_ pust.'\r\n\r\n'Or a drawing?'\r\n\r\n'_Nichts_ trawing.'\r\n\r\n'Or an engraving?'\r\n\r\n'_Nichts_ craving.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then--what have you got?'\r\n\r\n'I got _dis_ dings.'\r\n\r\nSaying this, he brought forth a small book, greatly worn, which he\r\nslowly opened, and unfolded from it a broad leaf, adorned with German\r\nemblems, and cragged pot-hook inscriptions which looked like lager-bier\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\n'What is that?'\r\n\r\n'Dis is mein fader's passport. Look ant readt! Plue eyes, proun hair,\r\nround _kinn_, pig mouf--und all dat, so fort. He hafe a goot deal of\r\nexbression like mine.'\r\n\r\n(Where this latter could have been I could not imagine.)\r\n\r\n'Yas--und he wear a plue gote.'\r\n\r\n'Oh--a _goatee_, I suppose, on his chin?'\r\n\r\n'No. It was a plue gote on his pack. He hafe a peard like mein, und look\r\nlike mein. Put mein fader was a more older man dan me.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, indeed!'\r\n\r\n'Yas. Baint him mit a piple on a taple, und mit a girl on his hands.'\r\n\r\n'_What!!_'\r\n\r\n'Yas--mine leetle daughter. I prings her here to be colored.'\r\n\r\nIt was a bold thing to do; but on this small capital I went to work, and\r\nsucceeded. At least, Jacobus Kirchelheimer said so--and _he_ ought to\r\nknow, for he was a first-rate fellow, and sent me over and above the\r\nprice agreed upon, a dozen bottles of Rudesheimer. A suspicion seemed\r\nindeed to haunt his mind that the portrait resembled himself much more\r\nthan it did the late Herr Kirchelheimer, _pere_,--but he speedily found\r\ncomfort in the following reflection:\r\n\r\n'Ven I kits to be more older it will do shoost as goot for mine bicture\r\nas for de old one.'\r\n\r\nIt wasn't very self-flattering--that of hoping to resemble the Old One;\r\nbut I said nothing. And no more at present from\r\n\r\n                          Yours truly,\r\n                               POPPY OYLE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN--not satisfied with hoping for the parings of a\r\nnomination to the Senate after having eaten the Presidential apple, has\r\npushed his impudence so far as to attempt to vindicate FLOYD from the\r\ncharge of stealing, although the theft was by FLOYD self-confessed and\r\ngloried in. This is proving more than the record. What will FLOYD say\r\nfor BUCHANAN?\r\n\r\n   The Raven said: 'Of birds I know,\r\n   The very whitest is the Crow.'\r\n\r\n   The Crow declared: 'While birds endure,\r\n   The Raven will be whitest, sure!'\r\n\r\n   The Raven said: 'I do believe\r\n   The Crow knows not what 'tis to thieve.'\r\n\r\n   The Crow inquired: 'Who ever heard\r\n   The Raven was a stealing bird?\r\n\r\n   'He calls himself a thief, I know,\r\n   But I can prove it is not so.'\r\n\r\n   The Raven swore by wet and dry,\r\n   The Crow was never known to lie.\r\n\r\n   The Crow swore out by hot and cold,\r\n   The Raven's word was good as gold.\r\n\r\n   The Crow flew o'er an old oak tree;\r\n   'Caw me,' he croaked, '_and I'll caw thee_.'\r\n\r\nIt is an old story, and one which will last while rogues endure--be they\r\nbroken-down politicians, craving, like Buchanan, a little more paltry\r\nnotoriety, or any other variety of the great family of the Dishonest.\r\nAnd they will go their way adown the road of time and into history,\r\nproperly brandmarked. The truth ever comes to light.\r\n\r\n'And that isn't all--either.' For even as we write, the following is\r\nhanded us by a friend:\r\n\r\n   Take, oh, take his pen away,\r\n     That so feebly runs on paper;\r\n   Keep him quiet, or he'll play\r\n     Other trait'rous prank and caper.\r\n   Why apologize for treason,\r\n   Or for stealing give a reason?\r\n\r\n   Hide, oh, hide his pens and ink;\r\n     Try to keep him silent: do!\r\n   Would you let him lower sink,\r\n     He'd defend the Devil too.\r\n   Keep him silent, let him be:\r\n   He has _not_ escaped Scott-free.\r\n\r\nNot he--nor the opinion of the whole world, either. There--let him\r\ngo--_his_ place in the future is at any rate decided on. And yet the\r\nvindicator of Floyd intends, we are told, to vindicate himself!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA late 'horrible and agonizing execution' of two murderers in cultivated\r\nand Christian England was witnessed by one hundred thousand\r\npeople!--according to the London _Times_. In the first-class English\r\njournals a large space is always devoted to police reports, in which the\r\nvilest and most vulgar criminal cases are always given in full detail,\r\nto gratify the almost universal British craving for filth and cruelty. A\r\ndrunken vagabond cannot maim his wife but all England must know all\r\nabout it. Let it be borne in mind that while English writers are never\r\nweary of speaking of the blackguardism of the American press, nine\r\ntenths of our journals abandoned many years ago the abominable practice\r\nof regularly publishing police cases; and that, making every allowance,\r\nEnglish newspapers at present publish on an average ten times as much\r\ndemoralizing matter as the American.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe clip the following from the Boston _Post_:\r\n\r\n     'Speaking of the heathen names reminds the London Athenaeum of what\r\n     M. Salverte says with respect to that fairest of the heroines in\r\n     that poem for all spring time, \"Lalla Rookh.\" Everybody, in his\r\n     happy turn, has been in love with that lady of the peerless\r\n     enchantments: perhaps they will be taken a little aback when they\r\n     hear that before the lord of the East gave her the name of\r\n     Nourmahal, 'Light of the Harem,' or, in the later excess of his\r\n     love, Nourdjihan, 'Light of the World,' she was known to her family\r\n     and friends as Mher-ul-Nica, or, in equivalent Saxon, the\r\n     'Strapping Wench;' and that this 'tallest of women,' of whom it is\r\n     said her lover, Djihanguyr,\r\n\r\n   ----preferred in his heart the least ringlet that curl'd\r\n   Down her exquisite neck, to the throne of the world,\r\n\r\n     only became the light of his harem by the process of cutting the\r\n     throat of her first husband. If this annotation, to be made in all\r\n     copies of the poem, do not wring all charm out of the names by\r\n     which the poet's lady is known to fame, then fiction again will\r\n     prove stronger than fact.'\r\n\r\n'And _that_ isn't all, either.' For _Noor-Mahal_, albeit conventionally\r\nused as Light of the Harem, _does_ mean Light of the Workshop in Arabic.\r\nWe shouldn't in the least wonder if the lady in question, in her earlier\r\nand better-behaved days, had been chief engineer of a sewing machine at\r\ntwo shillings a day. However, we set that down to her credit side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREADER--you have travelled? If so, did you ever suffer from too much\r\nlandlord?\r\n\r\nThe last time we were at Mackinaw, we had our boots blackened, our\r\nclothes 'swept,' and our cigars diminished by a very funny halfbreed\r\nnamed Pierre, and noticed that when more cigars than usual were taken,\r\nwe were always sure of receiving an extra amount of attention from him\r\nin the way of sweeping, brushing, and small talk.\r\n\r\n'Mossu, how you lak Detroit?'\r\n\r\n'I like it very well.'\r\n\r\n'Zat fust-rate 'otel, ze Fiddle House; ze landlord he maks var' big fuss\r\nover ze grand persons as come zere--var' big fuss.

Then--oh, _then_, 'all\r\ngoes as it does with a divinity in France,' as the European proverb hath\r\nit--that is to say, very Paradisiacally indeed. Which reminds us of a\r\nletter on the coming of the Millennium, from a friend who declares it to\r\nbe his conviction that those who are afraid of the immediate realization\r\nof this consummation devoutly to be wished for, may lay aside their\r\napprehensions, since it is evident that nothing of the kind is to come\r\noff _this_ year at least.\r\n\r\n'Of which, dear CONTINENTAL friend, there can be no doubt, albeit there\r\nmay be somewhat pity. For I have lang syne awaited a millennium and a\r\ngolden age, and, when FERNANDO WOOD was kicked out of the mayoralty into\r\nCoventry, hailed it as the beginning. Now, however, the old serpent\r\nlifts his head--Fernando has gone to Congress, and the devil is let\r\nloose again for a little season--to give seasoning by his sin to the\r\ngreat sea of gruel of excessive virtue with which the world is\r\ninundated.

Such at least seems to have been the life-philosophy of him\r\nwho penned the following poem:\r\n\r\nBY THE STREAM.\r\n\r\n   Oh water that ever art roving!\r\n     O fountain that never canst move!\r\n   Oh fancy--some new flame still loving!\r\n     O heart, ever constant to love!\r\n\r\n   The waterfall rustled and glistened,\r\n     Till it seemed like a musical flame,\r\n   And I lay and I looked and I listened\r\n     Till the nymph of the waterfall came.\r\n\r\n   It was no Undine or Lurley\r\n     (Though I thought her as beautiful still)\r\n   That came in the evening early--\r\n     But a bare-footed maid from the mill.\r\n\r\n   The pitcher too frequently laden\r\n     Must break and be lost at the worst,\r\n   But the young heart, when full of a maiden,\r\n     Of the twain will be broken the first.\r\n\r\n   But the pitcher, when cracked by a tumble,\r\n     Must be laid, till repaired, on the shelf,\r\n   While the heart, although shattered and humble,\r\n     Will be mended in time by itself.\r\n\r\n   And we vowed that we loved--but with laughter,\r\n     And we kissed with our feet in the brook;\r\n   She left me--my whistle rung after,\r\n     To win from the maid a last look.\r\n\r\n   And months have flown by since I missed her,\r\n     For afar with another she's flown;\r\n   And now I wait here for her sister,\r\n     To vow that I've loved her alone.\r\n\r\n   Oh water that ever art roaming!\r\n     Oh fountain that never canst move!\r\n   Oh fancy--some new flame still loving!\r\n     Oh heart ever constant to--love!\r\n\r\nSing it, reader, 'if thou canst sing.' A lady friend assures us that it\r\ngoeth well unto voice and pianoforte.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYE JOLLIE POACHER.\r\n\r\n   'Twas I that kept a shoddy mill\r\n     In starving Lancashire;\r\n   And shaved the Yankees shamefully\r\n     For many and many a year.\r\n\r\n   The mill is stopped, I'm raving mad,\r\n     As from the _Times_ you hear;\r\n   Oh it's my delight to bark and bite\r\n     At all times of the year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The\r\n  Continental Monthly.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important\r\nposition it has assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the\r\nbrilliant array of political and literary talent of the highest order\r\nwhich supports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the\r\nCONTINENTAL was first established, it has during that time\r\nacquired a strength and a political significance elevating it to a\r\nposition far above that previously occupied by any publication of the\r\nkind in America. In proof of which assertion we call attention to the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a\r\nsingle one has had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six\r\nthousand_ copies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among\r\nthe Pines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary\r\npopularity;_ and its conductors are determined that it shall not fall\r\nbehind. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a\r\nthousand journals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,                    Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,                   Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,                  Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,                Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,            Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n                           PAID IN ADVANCE\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, to be paid BY THE\r\nSUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the\r\nPublisher_.\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Number 15.         25 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE\r\n\r\n   CONTINENTAL\r\n\r\n   MONTHLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEVOTED TO\r\n\r\n   Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n        MARCH, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n   NEW YORK:\r\n\r\n   JOHN F.
