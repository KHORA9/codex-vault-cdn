I have not allowed the division among\r\nthe States and the breaking out of civil war to interfere with my\r\nintention; but I should not purposely have chosen this period either\r\nfor my book or for my visit. I say so much, in order that it may not\r\nbe supposed that it is my special purpose to write an account of the\r\nstruggle as far as it has yet been carried. My wish is to describe as\r\nwell as I can the present social and political state of the country.\r\nThis I should have attempted, with more personal satisfaction in the\r\nwork, had there been no disruption between the North and South; but I\r\nhave not allowed that disruption to deter me from an object which, if\r\nit were delayed, might probably never be carried out. I am therefore\r\nforced to take the subject in its present condition, and being so\r\nforced I must write of the war, of the causes which have led to it,\r\nand of its probable termination. But I wish it to be understood that\r\nit was not my selected task to do so, and is not now my primary\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago my mother wrote a book about the Americans, to which\r\nI believe I may allude as a well known and successful work without\r\nbeing guilty of any undue family conceit. That was essentially a\r\nwoman's book. She saw with a woman's keen eye, and described with a\r\nwoman's light but graphic pen, the social defects and absurdities\r\nwhich our near relatives had adopted into their domestic life.\r\nAll that she told was worth the telling, and the telling, if done\r\nsuccessfully, was sure to produce a good result. I am satisfied that\r\nit did so. But she did not regard it as a part of her work to dilate\r\non the nature and operation of those political arrangements which had\r\nproduced the social absurdities which she saw, or to explain that\r\nthough such absurdities were the natural result of those arrangements\r\nin their newness, the defects would certainly pass away, while the\r\npolitical arrangements, if good, would remain. Such a work is fitter\r\nfor a man than for a woman. I am very far from thinking that it is\r\na task which I can perform with satisfaction either to myself or to\r\nothers. It is a work which some man will do who has earned a right\r\nby education, study, and success to rank himself among the political\r\nsages of his age. But I may perhaps be able to add something to the\r\nfamiliarity of Englishmen with Americans. The writings which have\r\nbeen most popular in England on the subject of the United States have\r\nhitherto dealt chiefly with social details; and though in most cases\r\ntrue and useful, have created laughter on one side of the Atlantic,\r\nand soreness on the other. If I could do anything to mitigate the\r\nsoreness, if I could in any small degree add to the good feeling\r\nwhich should exist between two nations which ought to love each other\r\nso well, and which do hang upon each other so constantly, I should\r\nthink that I had cause to be proud of my work.\r\n\r\nBut it is very hard to write about any country a book that does\r\nnot represent the country described in a more or less ridiculous\r\npoint of view. It is hard at least to do so in such a book\r\nas I must write. A De Tocqueville may do it. It may be done\r\nby any philosophico-political or politico-statistical, or\r\nstatistico-scientific writer; but it can hardly be done by a man who\r\nprofesses to use a light pen, and to manufacture his article for the\r\nuse of general readers. Such a writer may tell all that he sees of\r\nthe beautiful; but he must also tell, if not all that he sees of the\r\nludicrous, at any rate the most piquant part of it. How to do this\r\nwithout being offensive is the problem which a man with such a task\r\nbefore him has to solve. His first duty is owed to his readers, and\r\nconsists mainly in this: that he shall tell the truth, and shall\r\nso tell that truth that what he has written may be readable. But\r\na second duty is due to those of whom he writes; and he does not\r\nperform that duty well if he gives offence to those, as to whom, on\r\nthe summing up of the whole evidence for and against them in his own\r\nmind, he intends to give a favourable verdict. There are of course\r\nthose against whom a writer does not intend to give a favourable\r\nverdict;--people and places whom he desires to describe, on the peril\r\nof his own judgment, as bad, ill-educated, ugly, and odious. In such\r\ncases his course is straightforward enough. His judgment may be\r\nin great peril, but his volume or chapter will be easily written.\r\nRidicule and censure run glibly from the pen, and form themselves\r\ninto sharp paragraphs which are pleasant to the reader. Whereas\r\neulogy is commonly dull, and too frequently sounds as though it were\r\nfalse. There is much difficulty in expressing a verdict which is\r\nintended to be favourable; but which, though favourable, shall not be\r\nfalsely eulogistic; and though true, not offensive.\r\n\r\nWho has ever travelled in foreign countries without meeting excellent\r\nstories against the citizens of such countries? And how few can\r\ntravel without hearing such stories against themselves? It is\r\nimpossible for me to avoid telling of a very excellent gentleman whom\r\nI met before I had been in the United States a week, and who asked me\r\nwhether lords in England ever spoke to men who were not lords. Nor\r\ncan I omit the opening address of another gentleman to my wife. \"You\r\nlike our institutions, ma'am?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said my wife,--not with\r\nall that eagerness of assent which the occasion perhaps required.\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I never yet met the down-trodden subject of a despot\r\nwho did not hug his chains.\" The first gentleman was certainly\r\nsomewhat ignorant of our customs, and the second was rather abrupt in\r\nhis condemnation of the political principles of a person whom he only\r\nfirst saw at that moment. It comes to me in the way of my trade to\r\nrepeat such incidents; but I can tell stories which are quite as good\r\nagainst Englishmen. As for instance, when I was tapped on the back in\r\none of the galleries of Florence by a countryman of mine, and asked\r\nto show him where stood the medical Venus. Nor is anything that one\r\ncan say of the inconveniences attendant upon travel in the United\r\nStates to be beaten by what foreigners might truly say of us. I shall\r\nnever forget the look of a Frenchman whom I found on a wet afternoon\r\nin the best inn of a provincial town in the west of England. He was\r\nseated on a horsehair-covered chair in the middle of a small dingy\r\nill-furnished private sitting-room. No eloquence of mine could make\r\nintelligible to a Frenchman or an American the utter desolation of\r\nsuch an apartment. The world as then seen by that Frenchman offered\r\nhim solace of no description. The air without was heavy, dull, and\r\nthick. The street beyond the window was dark and narrow. The room\r\ncontained mahogany chairs covered with horsehair, a mahogany table\r\nricketty in its legs, and a mahogany sideboard ornamented with\r\ninverted glasses and old cruet-stands. The Frenchman had come\r\nto the house for shelter and food, and had been asked whether\r\nhe was commercial. Whereupon he shook his head. \"Did he want a\r\nsitting-room?\" Yes, he did. \"He was a leetle tired and vanted to\r\nseet.\" Whereupon he was presumed to have ordered a private room,\r\nand was shown up to the Eden I have described. I found him there at\r\ndeath's door. Nothing that I can say with reference to the social\r\nhabits of the Americans can tell more against them than the story of\r\nthat Frenchman's fate tells against those of our country.\r\n\r\nFrom which remarks I would wish to be understood as deprecating\r\noffence from my American friends, if in the course of my book should\r\nbe found aught which may seem to argue against the excellence of\r\ntheir institutions, and the grace of their social life. Of this at\r\nany rate I can assure them in sober earnestness that I admire what\r\nthey have done in the world and for the world with a true and hearty\r\nadmiration; and that whether or no all their institutions be at\r\npresent excellent, and their social life all graceful, my wishes are\r\nthat they should be so, and my convictions are that that improvement\r\nwill come for which there may perhaps even yet be some little room.\r\n\r\nAnd now touching this war which had broken out between the North and\r\nSouth before I left England. I would wish to explain what my feelings\r\nwere; or rather what I believe the general feelings of England to\r\nhave been, before I found myself among the people by whom it was\r\nbeing waged. It is very difficult for the people of any one nation to\r\nrealize the political relations of another, and to chew the cud and\r\ndigest the bearings of those external politics. But it is unjust in\r\nthe one to decide upon the political aspirations and doings of that\r\nother without such understanding. Constantly as the name of France\r\nis in our mouth, comparatively few Englishmen understand the way\r\nin which France is governed;--that is, how far absolute despotism\r\nprevails, and how far the power of the one ruler is tempered, or, as\r\nit may be, hampered by the voices and influence of others. And as\r\nregards England, how seldom is it that in common society a foreigner\r\nis met who comprehends the nature of her political arrangements! To\r\na Frenchman,--I do not of course include great men who have made the\r\nsubject a study,--but to the ordinary intelligent Frenchman the thing\r\nis altogether incomprehensible. Language, it may be said, has much\r\nto do with that. But an American speaks English; and how often is an\r\nAmerican met, who has combined in his mind the idea of a monarch, so\r\ncalled, with that of a republic, properly so named;--a combination of\r\nideas which I take to be necessary to the understanding of English\r\npolitics? The gentleman who scorned my wife for hugging her chains\r\nhad certainly not done so, and yet he conceived that he had studied\r\nthe subject. The matter is one most difficult of comprehension.\r\nHow many Englishmen have failed to understand accurately their own\r\nconstitution, or the true bearing of their own politics! But when\r\nthis knowledge has been attained, it has generally been filtered into\r\nthe mind slowly, and has come from the unconscious study of many\r\nyears. An Englishman handles a newspaper for a quarter of an hour\r\ndaily, and daily exchanges some few words in politics with those\r\naround him, till drop by drop the pleasant springs of his liberty\r\ncreep into his mind and water his heart; and thus, earlier or later\r\nin life according to the nature of his intelligence, he understands\r\nwhy it is that he is at all points a free man. But if this be so of\r\nour own politics; if it be so rare a thing to find a foreigner who\r\nunderstands them in all their niceties, why is it that we are so\r\nconfident in our remarks on all the niceties of those of other\r\nnations?\r\n\r\nI hope that I may not be misunderstood as saying that we should not\r\ndiscuss foreign politics in our press, our parliament, our public\r\nmeetings, or our private houses. No man could be mad enough to preach\r\nsuch a doctrine. As regards our Parliament, that is probably the best\r\nBritish school of foreign politics, seeing that the subject is not\r\nthere often taken up by men who are absolutely ignorant, and that\r\nmistakes when made are subject to a correction which is both rough\r\nand ready. The press, though very liable to error, labours hard at\r\nits vocation in teaching foreign politics, and spares no expense\r\nin letting in daylight. If the light let in be sometimes moonshine,\r\nexcuse may easily be made. Where so much is attempted, there must\r\nnecessarily be some failure. But even the moonshine does good, if it\r\nbe not offensive moonshine. What I would deprecate is, that aptness\r\nat reproach which we assume;--the readiness with scorn, the quiet\r\nwords of insult, the instant judgment and condemnation with which we\r\nare so inclined to visit, not the great outward acts, but the smaller\r\ninward politics of our neighbours.\r\n\r\nAnd do others spare us, will be the instant reply of all who may read\r\nthis. In my counter reply I make bold to place myself and my country\r\non very high ground, and to say that we, the older and therefore\r\nmore experienced people as regards the United States, and the better\r\ngoverned as regards France, and the stronger as regards all the world\r\nbeyond, should not throw mud again even though mud be thrown at us.\r\nI yield the path to a small chimney-sweeper as readily as to a lady;\r\nand forbear from an interchange of courtesies with a Billingsgate\r\nheroine, even though at heart I may have a proud consciousness that\r\nI should not altogether go to the wall in such an encounter.\r\n\r\nI left England in August last--August 1861. At that time, and for\r\nsome months previous, I think that the general English feeling on\r\nthe American question was as follows. \"This wide-spread nationality\r\nof the United States, with its enormous territorial possessions and\r\nincreasing population, has fallen asunder, torn to pieces by the\r\nweight of its own discordant parts,--as a congregation when its\r\nsize has become unwieldy will separate, and reform itself into two\r\nwholesome wholes. It is well that this should be so, for the people\r\nare not homogeneous, as a people should be who are called to live\r\ntogether as one nation. They have attempted to combine free-soil\r\nsentiments with the practice of slavery, and to make these two\r\nantagonists live together in peace and unity under the same roof;\r\nbut, as we have long expected, they have failed. Now has come the\r\nperiod for separation; and if the people would only see this, and\r\nact in accordance with the circumstances which Providence and the\r\ninevitable hand of the world's ruler has prepared for them, all\r\nwould be well. But they will not do this. They will go to war with\r\neach other. The South will make her demands for secession with an\r\narrogance and instant pressure which exasperates the North; and the\r\nNorth, forgetting that an equable temper in such matters is the most\r\npowerful of all weapons, will not recognize the strength of its own\r\nposition. It allows itself to be exasperated, and goes to war for\r\nthat which if regained would only be injurious to it. Thus millions\r\non millions sterling will be spent. A heavy debt will be incurred;\r\nand the North, which divided from the South might take its place\r\namong the greatest of nations, will throw itself back for half a\r\ncentury, and perhaps injure the splendour of its ultimate prospects.\r\nIf only they would be wise, throw down their arms, and agree to part!\r\nBut they will not.\"\r\n\r\nThis was, I think, the general opinion when I left England. It would\r\nnot, however, be necessary to go back many months to reach the time\r\nwhen Englishmen were saying how impossible it was that so great a\r\nnational power should ignore its own greatness, and destroy its own\r\npower by an internecine separation. But in August last all that had\r\ngone by, and we in England had realized the probability of actual\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\nTo these feelings on the subject may be added another, which was\r\nnatural enough though perhaps not noble. \"These western cocks have\r\ncrowed loudly,\" we said; \"too loudly for the comfort of those who\r\nlive after all at no such great distance from them. It is well that\r\ntheir combs should be clipped. Cocks who crow so very loudly are a\r\nnuisance. It might have gone so far that the clipping would become a\r\nwork necessarily to be done from without. But it is ten times better\r\nfor all parties that it should be done from within; and as the cocks\r\nare now clipping their own combs, in God's name let them do it\r\nand the whole world will be the quieter.\" That, I say, was not a\r\nvery noble idea; but it was natural enough, and certainly has done\r\nsomewhat in mitigating that grief which the horrors of civil war and\r\nthe want of cotton have caused to us in England.\r\n\r\nSuch certainly had been my belief as to the country. I speak here of\r\nmy opinion as to the ultimate success of secession and the folly of\r\nthe war,--repudiating any concurrence of my own in the ignoble but\r\nnatural sentiment alluded to in the last paragraph. I certainly did\r\nthink that the Northern States, if wise, would have let the Southern\r\nStates go. I had blamed Buchanan as a traitor for allowing the germ\r\nof secession to make any growth;--and as I thought him a traitor\r\nthen, so do I think him a traitor now. But I had also blamed Lincoln,\r\nor rather the government of which Mr. Lincoln in this matter is\r\nno more than the exponent, for his efforts to avoid that which is\r\ninevitable. In this I think that I--or as I believe I may say we, we\r\nEnglishmen--were wrong. I do not see how the North, treated as it was\r\nand had been, could have submitted to secession without resistance.\r\nWe all remember what Shakespere says of the great armies which were\r\nled out to fight for a piece of ground not large enough to cover\r\nthe bodies of those who would be slain in the battle; but I do not\r\nremember that Shakespere says that the battle was on this account\r\nnecessarily unreasonable. It is the old point of honour, which, till\r\nit had been made absurd by certain changes of circumstances, was\r\nalways grand and usually beneficent. These changes of circumstances\r\nhave altered the manner in which appeal may be made, but have not\r\naltered the point of honour. Had the Southern States sought to obtain\r\nsecession by constitutional means, they might or might not have been\r\nsuccessful; but if successful there would have been no war. I do not\r\nmean to brand all the Southern States with treason, nor do I intend\r\nto say that having secession at heart they could have obtained it\r\nby constitutional means. But I do intend to say that acting as they\r\ndid, demanding secession not constitutionally but in opposition to\r\nthe constitution, taking upon themselves the right of breaking up a\r\nnationality of which they formed only a part, and doing that without\r\nconsent of the other part, opposition from the North and war was an\r\ninevitable consequence.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, only necessary to look back to the revolution by\r\nwhich the United States separated themselves from England to see\r\nthis. There is hardly to be met, here and there, an Englishman who\r\nnow regrets the loss of the revolted American colonies;--who now\r\nthinks that civilization was retarded and the world injured by that\r\nrevolt; who now conceives that England should have expended more\r\ntreasure and more lives in the hope of retaining those colonies. It\r\nis agreed that the revolt was a good thing; that those who were then\r\nrebels became patriots by success, and that they deserved well of all\r\ncoming ages of mankind. But not the less absolutely necessary was it\r\nthat England should endeavour to hold her own. She was as the mother\r\nbird when the young bird will fly alone. She suffered those pangs\r\nwhich Nature calls upon mothers to endure.\r\n\r\nAs was the necessity of British opposition to American independence,\r\nso was the necessity of Northern opposition to Southern secession.\r\nI do not say that in other respects the two cases were parallel.\r\nThe States separated from us because they would not endure taxation\r\nwithout representation--in other words because they were old enough\r\nand big enough to go alone. The South is seceding from the North\r\nbecause the two are not homogeneous. They have different instincts,\r\ndifferent appetites, different morals, and a different culture. It is\r\nwell for one man to say that slavery has caused the separation; and\r\nfor another to say that slavery has not caused it. Each in so saying\r\nspeaks the truth. Slavery has caused it, seeing that slavery is the\r\ngreat point on which the two have agreed to differ. But slavery has\r\nnot caused it, seeing that other points of difference are to be found\r\nin every circumstance and feature of the two people. The North and\r\nthe South must ever be dissimilar. In the North labour will always\r\nbe honourable, and because honourable successful. In the South\r\nlabour has ever been servile,--at least in some sense, and therefore\r\ndishonourable; and because dishonourable has not, to itself, been\r\nsuccessful. In the South, I say, labour ever has been dishonourable;\r\nand I am driven to confess that I have not hitherto seen a sign of\r\nany change in the Creator's fiat on this matter. That labour will be\r\nhonourable all the world over, as years advance and the millennium\r\ndraws nigh, I for one never doubt.\r\n\r\nSo much for English opinion about America in August last. And now I\r\nwill venture to say a word or two as to American feeling respecting\r\nthis English opinion at that period. It will of course be remembered\r\nby all my readers that at the beginning of the war Lord Russell, who\r\nwas then in the lower house, declared as Foreign Secretary of State\r\nthat England would regard the North and South as belligerents, and\r\nwould remain neutral as to both of them. This declaration gave\r\nviolent offence to the North, and has been taken as indicating\r\nBritish sympathy with the cause of the seceders. I am not going\r\nto explain--indeed it would be necessary that I should first\r\nunderstand--the laws of nations with regard to blockaded ports,\r\nprivateering, ships and men and goods contraband of war, and all\r\nthose semi-nautical semi-military rules and axioms which it is\r\nnecessary that all Attorneys-General and such like should at the\r\npresent moment have at their fingers' end. But it must be evident\r\nto the most ignorant in those matters, among which large crowd I\r\ncertainly include myself, that it was essentially necessary that Lord\r\nJohn Russell should at that time declare openly what England intended\r\nto do. It was essential that our seamen should know where they would\r\nbe protected and where not, and that the course to be taken by\r\nEngland should be defined. Reticence in the matter was not within the\r\npower of the British Government. It behoved the Foreign Secretary of\r\nState to declare openly that England intended to side either with one\r\nparty or with the other, or else to remain neutral between them.\r\n\r\nI had heard this matter discussed by Americans before I left England,\r\nand I have of course heard it discussed very frequently in America.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the front of the offence given by England\r\nto the Northern States was this declaration of Lord John Russell's.\r\nBut it has been always made evident to me that the sin did not\r\nconsist in the fact of England's neutrality,--in the fact of\r\nher regarding the two parties as belligerents,--but in the open\r\ndeclaration made to the world by a Secretary of State that she did\r\nintend so to regard them. If another proof were wanting, this would\r\nafford another proof of the immense weight attached in America to all\r\nthe proceedings and to all the feelings of England on this matter.\r\nThe very anger of the North is a compliment paid by the North to\r\nEngland. But not the less is that anger unreasonable. To those in\r\nAmerica who understand our constitution, it must be evident that our\r\nGovernment cannot take official measures without a public avowal of\r\nsuch measures. France can do so. Russia can do so. The Government\r\nof the United States can do so, and could do so even before this\r\nrupture. But the Government of England cannot do so. All men\r\nconnected with the Government in England have felt themselves from\r\ntime to time more or less hampered by the necessity of publicity.\r\nOur statesmen have been forced to fight their battles with the plan\r\nof their tactics open before their adversaries. But we, in England,\r\nare inclined to believe, that the general result is good, and that\r\nbattles so fought and so won will be fought with the honestest blows,\r\nand won with the surest results. Reticence in this matter was not\r\npossible, and Lord John Russell in making the open avowal which gave\r\nsuch offence to the Northern States only did that which, as a servant\r\nof England, England required him to do.\r\n\r\n\"What would you in England have thought,\" a gentleman of much weight\r\nin Boston said to me, \"if when you were in trouble in India, we had\r\nopenly declared that we regarded your opponents there as belligerents\r\non equal terms with yourselves?\" I was forced to say that, as far as\r\nI could see, there was no analogy between the two cases. In India an\r\narmy had mutinied, and that an army composed of a subdued, if not a\r\nservile race. The analogy would have been fairer had it referred to\r\nany sympathy shown by us to insurgent negroes. But, nevertheless,\r\nhad the army which mutinied in India been in possession of ports and\r\nsea-board; had they held in their hands vast commercial cities and\r\ngreat agricultural districts; had they owned ships and been masters\r\nof a wide-spread trade, America could have done nothing better\r\ntowards us than have remained neutral in such a conflict, and have\r\nregarded the parties as belligerents. The only question is whether\r\nshe would have done so well by us. \"But,\" said my friend in answer\r\nto all this, \"we should not have proclaimed to the world that we\r\nregarded you and them as standing on an equal footing.\" There again\r\nappeared the true gist of the offence. A word from England such as\r\nthat spoken by Lord John Russell was of such weight to the South,\r\nthat the North could not endure to have it spoken. I did not say to\r\nthat gentleman,--but here I may say, that had such circumstances\r\narisen as those conjectured, and had America spoken such a word,\r\nEngland would not have felt herself called upon to resent it.\r\n\r\nBut the fairer analogy lies between Ireland and the Southern States.\r\nThe monster meetings and O'Connell's triumphs are not so long gone by\r\nbut that many of us can remember the first demand for secession made\r\nby Ireland, and the line which was then taken by American sympathies.\r\nIt is not too much to say that America then believed that Ireland\r\nwould secure secession, and that the great trust of the Irish\r\nrepealers was in the moral aid which she did and would receive from\r\nAmerica. \"But our Government proclaimed no sympathy with Ireland,\"\r\nsaid my friend. No. The American Government is not called on to make\r\nsuch proclamations; nor had Ireland ever taken upon herself the\r\nnature and labours of a belligerent.\r\n\r\nThat this anger on the part of the North is unreasonable I cannot\r\ndoubt. That it is unfortunate, grievous, and very bitter I am quite\r\nsure. But I do not think that it is in any degree surprising. I am\r\ninclined to think that did I belong to Boston as I do belong to\r\nLondon, I should share in the feeling, and rave as loudly as all men\r\nthere have raved against the coldness of England. When men have on\r\nhand such a job of work as the North has now undertaken they are\r\nalways guided by their feelings rather than their reason. What two\r\nmen ever had a quarrel in which each did not think that all the\r\nworld, if just, would espouse his own side of the dispute? The North\r\nfeels that it has been more than loyal to the South, and that the\r\nSouth has taken advantage of that over-loyalty to betray the North.\r\n\"We have worked for them, and fought for them, and paid for them,\"\r\nsays the North. \"By our labour we have raised their indolence to a\r\npar with our energy. While we have worked like men, we have allowed\r\nthem to talk and bluster. We have warmed them in our bosom, and now\r\nthey turn against us and sting us. The world sees that this is so.\r\nEngland, above all, must see it, and seeing it should speak out her\r\ntrue opinion.\" The North is hot with such thoughts as these, and\r\none cannot wonder that she should be angry with her friend, when\r\nher friend, with an expression of certain easy good wishes, bids\r\nher fight out her own battles. The North has been unreasonable with\r\nEngland;--but I believe that every reader of this page would have\r\nbeen as unreasonable had that reader been born in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Jones are the dearly beloved friends of my family. My\r\nwife and I have lived with Mrs. Jones on terms of intimacy which have\r\nbeen quite endearing. Jones has had the run of my house with perfect\r\nfreedom, and in Mrs. Jones' drawing-room I have always had my own\r\narm-chair, and have been regaled with large breakfast-cups of tea,\r\nquite as though I were at home. But of a sudden Jones and his wife\r\nhave fallen out, and there is for a while in Jones' Hall a cat and\r\ndog life that may end--in one hardly dare to surmise what calamity.\r\nMrs. Jones begs that I will interfere with her husband, and Jones\r\nentreats the good offices of my wife in moderating the hot temper of\r\nhis own. But we know better than that. If we interfere, the chances\r\nare that my dear friends will make it up and turn upon us. I grieve\r\nbeyond measure in a general way at the temporary break up of the\r\nJones' Hall happiness. I express general wishes that it may be\r\ntemporary. But as for saying which is right or which is wrong,--as\r\nto expressing special sympathy on either side in such a quarrel,--it\r\nis out of the question. \"My dear Jones, you must excuse me. Any news\r\nin the City to-day? Sugars have fell; how are teas?\" Of course Jones\r\nthinks that I'm a brute; but what can I do?\r\n\r\nI have been somewhat surprised to find the trouble that has been\r\ntaken by American orators, statesmen, and logicians to prove that\r\nthis secession on the part of the South has been revolutionary;--that\r\nis to say, that it has been undertaken and carried on not in\r\ncompliance with the constitution of the United States, but in\r\ndefiance of it. This has been done over and over again by some of\r\nthe greatest men of the North, and has been done most successfully.\r\nBut what then? Of course the movement has been revolutionary and\r\nanti-constitutional. Nobody, no single Southerner, can really believe\r\nthat the Constitution of the United States as framed in 1787, or\r\naltered since, intended to give to the separate States the power of\r\nseceding as they pleased. It is surely useless going through long\r\narguments to prove this, seeing that it is absolutely proved by the\r\nabsence of any clause giving such licence to the separate States.\r\nSuch licence would have been destructive to the very idea of a great\r\nnationality. Where would New England have been as a part of the\r\nUnited States, if New York, which stretches from the Atlantic to the\r\nborders of Canada, had been endowed with the power of cutting off the\r\nsix Northern States from the rest of the Union? No one will for a\r\nmoment doubt that the movement was revolutionary, and yet infinite\r\npains are taken to prove a fact that is patent to every one.\r\n\r\nIt is revolutionary, but what then? Have the Northern States of\r\nthe American Union taken upon themselves in 1861 to proclaim their\r\nopinion that revolution is a sin? Are they going back to the divine\r\nright of any sovereignty? Are they going to tell the world that\r\na nation or a people is bound to remain in any political status,\r\nbecause that status is the recognized form of government under which\r\nsuch a people have lived? Is this to be the doctrine of United\r\nStates' citizens,--of all people? And is this the doctrine preached\r\nnow, of all times, when the King of Naples and the Italian dukes\r\nhave just been dismissed from their thrones with such enchanting\r\nnonchalance, because their people have not chosen to keep them? Of\r\ncourse the movement is revolutionary; and why not? It is agreed now\r\namong all men and all nations that any people may change its form of\r\ngovernment to any other, if it wills to do so,--and if it can do so.\r\n\r\nThere are two other points on which these Northern statesmen and\r\nlogicians also insist, and these two other points are at any rate\r\nbetter worth an argument than that which touches the question of\r\nrevolution. It being settled that secession on the part of the\r\nSoutherners is revolution, it is argued, firstly, that no occasion\r\nfor revolution had been given by the North to the South; and,\r\nsecondly, that the South has been dishonest in its revolutionary\r\ntactics. Men certainly should not raise a revolution for nothing; and\r\nit may certainly be declared that whatever men do, they should do\r\nhonestly.\r\n\r\nBut in that matter of the cause and ground for revolution, it\r\nis so very easy for either party to put in a plea that shall be\r\nsatisfactory to itself! Mr. and Mrs. Jones each had a separate story.\r\nMr. Jones was sure that the right lay with him: but Mrs. Jones was\r\nno less sure. No doubt the North had done much for the South;--had\r\nearned money for it; had fed it;--and had moreover in a great measure\r\nfostered all its bad habits. It had not only been generous to the\r\nSouth, but over-indulgent. But also it had continually irritated the\r\nSouth by meddling with that which the Southerners believed to be a\r\nquestion absolutely private to themselves. The matter was illustrated\r\nto me by a New Hampshire man who was conversant with black bears. At\r\nthe hotels in the New Hampshire mountains it is customary to find\r\nblack bears chained to poles. These bears are caught among the hills,\r\nand are thus imprisoned for the amusement of the hotel guests. \"Them\r\nSoutherners,\" said my friend, \"are jist as one as that 'ere bear. We\r\nfeeds him and gives him a house and his belly is ollers full. But\r\nthen, jist becase he's a black bear, we're ollers a poking him with\r\nsticks, and a' course the beast is kinder riled. He wants to be back\r\nto the mountains. He wouldn't have his belly filled, but he'd have\r\nhis own way. It's jist so with them Southerners.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of no use proving to any man or to any nation that they have\r\ngot all they should want, if they have not got all that they do want.\r\nIf a servant desires to go, it is of no avail to show him that he\r\nhas all he can desire in his present place. The Northerners say that\r\nthey have given no offence to the Southerners, and that therefore the\r\nSouth is wrong to raise a revolution. The very fact that the North is\r\nthe North, is an offence to the South. As long as Mr. and Mrs. Jones\r\nwere one in heart and one in feeling, having the same hopes and the\r\nsame joys, it was well that they should remain together. But when it\r\nis proved that they cannot so live without tearing out each other's\r\neyes, Sir Cresswell Cresswell, the revolutionary institution of\r\ndomestic life, interferes and separates them. This is the age of such\r\nseparations. I do not wonder that the North should use its logic to\r\nshow that it has received cause of offence but given none. But I\r\ndo think that such logic is thrown away. The matter is not one for\r\nargument. The South has thought that it can do better without the\r\nNorth than with it; and if it has the power to separate itself, it\r\nmust be conceded that it has the right.\r\n\r\nAnd then as to that question of honesty. Whatever men do they\r\ncertainly should do honestly. Speaking broadly one may say that the\r\nrule applies to nations as strongly as to individuals, and should\r\nbe observed in politics as accurately as in other matters. We must,\r\nhowever, confess that men who are scrupulous in their private\r\ndealings do too constantly drop those scruples when they handle\r\npublic affairs,--and especially when they handle them at stirring\r\nmoments of great national changes. The name of Napoleon III. stands\r\nfair now before Europe, and yet he filched the French empire with a\r\nfalsehood. The union of England and Ireland is a successful fact, but\r\nnevertheless it can hardly be said that it was honestly achieved. I\r\nheartily believe that the whole of Texas is improved in every sense\r\nby having been taken from Mexico and added to the Southern States,\r\nbut I much doubt whether that annexation was accomplished with\r\nabsolute honesty. We all reverence the name of Cavour, but Cavour did\r\nnot consent to abandon Nice to France with clean hands. When men have\r\npolitical ends to gain they regard their opponents as adversaries,\r\nand then that old rule of war is brought to bear, Deceit or\r\nvalour,--either may be used against a foe. Would it were not so! The\r\nrascally rule--rascally in reference to all political contests--is\r\nbecoming less universal than it was. But it still exists with\r\nsufficient force to be urged as an excuse; and while it does exist it\r\nseems almost needless to show that a certain amount of fraud has been\r\nused by a certain party in a revolution. If the South be ultimately\r\nsuccessful, the fraud of which it may have been guilty will be\r\ncondoned by the world.\r\n\r\nThe Southern or democratic party of the United States had, as all\r\nmen know, been in power for many years. Either Southern Presidents\r\nhad been elected, or Northern Presidents with Southern politics. The\r\nSouth for many years had had the disposition of military matters, and\r\nthe power of distributing military appliances of all descriptions. It\r\nis now alleged by the North that a conspiracy had long been hatching\r\nin the South with the view of giving to the Southern States the power\r\nof secession whenever they might think fit to secede; and it is\r\nfurther alleged that President after President for years back has\r\nunduly sent the military treasure of the nation away from the North\r\ndown to the South, in order that the South might be prepared when\r\nthe day should come. That a President with Southern instincts should\r\nunduly favour the South, that he should strengthen the South, and\r\nfeel that arms and ammunition were stored there with better effect\r\nthan they could be stored in the North, is very probable. We all\r\nunderstand what is the bias of a man's mind, and how strong that\r\nbias may become when the man is not especially scrupulous. But I do\r\nnot believe that any President previous to Buchanan sent military\r\nmaterials to the South with the self-acknowledged purpose of using\r\nthem against the Union. That Buchanan did so, or knowingly allowed\r\nthis to be done, I do believe, and I think that Buchanan was a\r\ntraitor to the country whose servant he was and whose pay he\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having said so much in the way of introduction, I will begin\r\nmy journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNEWPORT--RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe--the we consisting of my wife and myself--left Liverpool for\r\nBoston on the 24th August, 1861, in the \"Arabia,\" one of Cunard's\r\nNorth American mail packets. We had determined that my wife should\r\nreturn alone at the beginning of winter, when I intended to go to a\r\npart of the country in which, under the existing circumstances of the\r\nwar, a lady might not feel herself altogether comfortable. I proposed\r\nstaying in America over the winter, and returning in the spring; and\r\nthis programme I have carried out with sufficient exactness.\r\n\r\nThe \"Arabia\" touched at Halifax; and as the touch extended from 11\r\nA.M. to 6 P.M. we had an opportunity of seeing a good deal of that\r\ncolony;--not quite sufficient to justify me at this critical age in\r\nwriting a chapter of travels in Nova Scotia, but enough perhaps to\r\nwarrant a paragraph. It chanced that a cousin of mine was then in\r\ncommand of the troops there, so that we saw the fort with all the\r\nhonours. A dinner on shore was, I think, a greater treat to us even\r\nthan this. We also inspected sundry specimens of the gold which is\r\nnow being found for the first time in Nova Scotia,--as to the glory\r\nand probable profits of which the Nova Scotians seemed to be fully\r\nalive. But still, I think, the dinner on shore took rank with us as\r\nthe most memorable and meritorious of all that we did and saw at\r\nHalifax. At seven o'clock on the morning but one after that, we were\r\nlanded at Boston.\r\n\r\nAt Boston I found friends ready to receive us with open arms, though\r\nthey were friends we had never known before. I own that I felt myself\r\nburdened with much nervous anxiety at my first introduction to men\r\nand women in Boston. I knew what the feeling there was with reference\r\nto England, and I knew also how impossible it is for an Englishman\r\nto hold his tongue and submit to dispraise of England. As for going\r\namong a people whose whole minds were filled with affairs of the\r\nwar, and saying nothing about the war,--I knew that no resolution\r\nto such an effect could be carried out. If one could not trust\r\noneself to speak, one should have stayed at home in England. I will\r\nhere state that I always did speak out openly what I thought and\r\nfelt, and that though I encountered very strong--sometimes almost\r\nfierce--opposition, I never was subjected to anything that was\r\npersonally disagreeable to me.\r\n\r\nIn September we did not stay above a week in Boston, having been\r\nfairly driven out of it by the mosquitoes. I had been told that I\r\nshould find nobody in Boston whom I cared to see, as everybody was\r\nhabitually out of town during the heat of the latter summer and early\r\nautumn; but this was not so. The war and attendant turmoils of war\r\nhad made the season of vacation shorter than usual, and most of those\r\nfor whom I asked were back at their posts. I know no place at which\r\nan Englishman may drop down suddenly among a pleasanter circle of\r\nacquaintance, or find himself with a more clever set of men, than he\r\ncan do at Boston. I confess that in this respect I think that but few\r\ntowns are at present more fortunately circumstanced than the capital\r\nof the Bay State, as Massachusetts is called, and that very few towns\r\nmake a better use of their advantages. Boston has a right to be proud\r\nof what it has done for the world of letters. It is proud; but I have\r\nnot found that its pride was carried too far.\r\n\r\nBoston is not in itself a fine city, but it is a very pleasant city.\r\nThey say that the harbour is very grand and very beautiful. It\r\ncertainly is not so fine as that of Portland in a nautical point of\r\nview, and as certainly it is not as beautiful. It is the entrance\r\nfrom the sea into Boston of which people say so much; but I did not\r\nthink it quite worthy of all I had heard. In such matters, however,\r\nmuch depends on the peculiar light in which scenery is seen. An\r\nevening light is generally the best for all landscapes; and I did not\r\nsee the entrance to Boston harbour by an evening light. It was not\r\nthe beauty of the harbour of which I thought the most, but of the tea\r\nthat had been sunk there, and of all that came of that successful\r\nspeculation. Few towns now standing have a right to be more proud of\r\ntheir antecedents than Boston.\r\n\r\nBut as I have said, it is not specially interesting to the eye--what\r\nnew town, or even what simply adult town, can be so? There is an\r\nAthenæum, and a State Hall, and a fashionable street,--Beacon Street,\r\nvery like Piccadilly as it runs along the Green Park,--and there is\r\nthe Green Park opposite to this Piccadilly, called Boston Common.\r\nBeacon Street and Boston Common are very pleasant. Excellent houses\r\nthere are, and large churches, and enormous hotels; but of such\r\nthings as these a man can write nothing that is worth the reading.\r\nThe traveller who desires to tell his experience of North America\r\nmust write of people rather than of things.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I found myself instantly involved in discussions on\r\nAmerican politics, and the bearing of England upon those politics.\r\n\"What do you think, you in England--what do you all believe will\r\nbe the upshot of this war?\" That was the question always asked in\r\nthose or other words. \"Secession, certainly,\" I always said, but not\r\nspeaking quite with that abruptness. \"And you believe, then, that the\r\nSouth will beat the North?\" I explained that I, personally, had never\r\nso thought, and that I did not believe that to be the general idea.\r\nMen's opinions in England, however, were too divided to enable me to\r\nsay that there was any prevailing conviction on the matter. My own\r\nimpression was, and is, that the North will, in a military point of\r\nview, have the best of the contest,--will beat the South; but that\r\nthe Northerners will not prevent secession, let their success be what\r\nit may. Should the North prevail after a two years' conflict, the\r\nNorth will not admit the South to an equal participation of good\r\nthings with themselves, even though each separate rebellious State\r\nshould return suppliant, like a prodigal son, kneeling on the floor\r\nof Congress, each with a separate rope of humiliation round its neck.\r\nSuch was my idea as expressed then, and I do not know that I have\r\nsince had much cause to change it.\r\n\r\n\"We will never give it up,\" one gentleman said to me--and, indeed,\r\nmany have said the same,--\"till the whole territory is again united\r\nfrom the Bay to the Gulf! It is impossible that we should allow\r\nof two nationalities within those limits.\" \"And do you think it\r\npossible,\" I asked, \"that you should receive back into your bosom\r\nthis people which you now hate with so deep a hatred, and receive\r\nthem again into your arms as brothers on equal terms? Is it in\r\naccordance with experience that a conquered people should be so\r\ntreated--and that, too, a people whose every habit of life is at\r\nvariance with the habits of their presumed conquerors? When you have\r\nflogged them into a return of fraternal affection, are they to keep\r\ntheir slaves or are they to abolish them?\" \"No,\" said my friend; \"it\r\nmay not be practicable to put those rebellious States at once on an\r\nequality with ourselves. For a time they will probably be treated as\r\nthe Territories are now treated.\" (The Territories are vast outlying\r\ndistricts belonging to the Union, but not as yet endowed with State\r\ngovernments, or a participation in the United States Congress.) \"For\r\na time they must, perhaps, lose their full privileges; but the Union\r\nwill be anxious to readmit them at the earliest possible period.\"\r\n\"And as to the slaves?\" I asked again. \"Let them emigrate to Liberia:\r\nback to their own country.\" I could not say that I thought much of\r\nthe solution of the difficulty. It would, I suggested, overtask even\r\nthe energy of America to send out an emigration of four million\r\nsouls, to provide for their wants in a new and uncultivated country,\r\nand to provide after that for the terrible gap made in the labour\r\nmarket of the Southern States. \"The Israelites went back from\r\nbondage,\" said my friend. But a way was opened for them by a miracle\r\nacross the sea, and food was sent to them from heaven, and they had\r\namong them a Moses for a leader and a Joshua to fight their battles.\r\nI could not but express my fear that the days of such immigrations\r\nwere over. This plan of sending back the negroes to Africa did not\r\nreach me only from one or from two mouths; and it was suggested by\r\nmen whose opinions respecting their country have weight at home and\r\nare entitled to weight abroad. I mention this merely to show how\r\ninsurmountable would be the difficulty of preventing secession, let\r\nwhich side win that may.\r\n\r\n\"We will never abandon the right to the mouth of the Mississippi.\"\r\nThat in all such arguments is a strong point with men of the Northern\r\nStates;--perhaps the point to which they all return with the greatest\r\nfirmness. It is that on which Mr. Everett insists in the last\r\nparagraph of the oration which he made in New York on the 4th of\r\nJuly, 1861. \"The Missouri and the Mississippi rivers,\" he says, \"with\r\ntheir hundred tributaries give to the great central basin of our\r\ncontinent its character and destiny. The outlet of this system lies\r\nbetween the States of Tennessee and Missouri, of Mississippi and\r\nArkansas, and through the State of Louisiana. The ancient province\r\nso called, the proudest monument of the mighty monarch whose\r\nname it bears, passed from the jurisdiction of France to that of\r\nSpain in 1763. Spain coveted it; not that she might fill it with\r\nprosperous colonies and rising States, but that it might stretch\r\nas a broad waste barrier, infested with warlike tribes, between\r\nthe Anglo-American power and the silver mines of Mexico. With the\r\nindependence of the United States, the fear of a still more dangerous\r\nneighbour grew upon Spain; and in the insane expectation of checking\r\nthe progress of the Union westward, she threatened, and at times\r\nattempted, to close the mouth of the Mississippi on the rapidly\r\nincreasing trade of the West. The bare suggestion of such a\r\npolicy roused the population upon the banks of the Ohio, then\r\ninconsiderable, as one man. Their confidence in Washington scarcely\r\nrestrained them from rushing to the seizure of New Orleans, when\r\nthe treaty of San Lorenzo El Real, in 1795, stipulated for them a\r\nprecarious right of navigating the noble river to the sea, with a\r\nright of deposit at New Orleans. This subject was for years the\r\nturning-point of the politics of the West; and it was perfectly well\r\nunderstood that, sooner or later, she would be content with nothing\r\nless than the sovereign control of the mighty stream from its\r\nhead-spring to its outlet in the Gulf. _And that is as true now as it\r\nwas then._\"\r\n\r\nThis is well put. It describes with force the desires, ambition,\r\nand necessities of a great nation, and it tells with historical truth\r\nthe story of the success of that nation. It was a great thing done\r\nwhen the purchase of the whole of Louisiana was completed by the\r\nUnited States,--that cession by France, however, having been made\r\nat the instance of Napoleon, and not in consequence of any demand\r\nmade by the States. The district then called Louisiana included\r\nthe present State of that name, and the States of Missouri and\r\nArkansas;--included also the right to possess, if not the absolute\r\npossession of, all that enormous expanse of country running from\r\nthence back to the Pacific; a huge amount of territory of which the\r\nmost fertile portion is watered by the Mississippi and its vast\r\ntributaries. That river and those tributaries are navigable through\r\nthe whole centre of the American continent up to Wisconsin and\r\nMinnesota. To the United States the navigation of the Mississippi\r\nwas, we may say, indispensable; and to the States when no longer\r\nunited the navigation will be equally indispensable. But the days are\r\ngone when any country, such as Spain was, can interfere to stop the\r\nhighways of the world with the all but avowed intention of arresting\r\nthe progress of civilization. It may be that the North and the South\r\ncan never again be friends as the component parts of one nation. Such\r\nI take it is the belief of all politicians in Europe, and of many of\r\nthose who live across the water. But as separate nations they may yet\r\nlive together in amity, and share between them the great water-ways\r\nwhich God has given them for their enrichment. The Rhine is free to\r\nPrussia and to Holland. The Danube is not closed against Austria. It\r\nwill be said that the Danube has in fact been closed against Austria,\r\nin spite of treaties to the contrary. But the faults of bad and weak\r\ngovernments are made known as cautions to the world, and not as facts\r\nto copy. The free use of the waters of a common river between two\r\nnations is an affair for treaty; and it has not yet come to that that\r\ntreaties must necessarily be null and void through the falseness of\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n\"And what will England do for cotton? Is it not the fact that Lord\r\nJohn Russell with his professed neutrality intends to express\r\nsympathy with the South, intends to pave the way for the advent\r\nof Southern cotton?\" \"You ought to love us,\" so say men in Boston,\r\n\"because we have been with you in heart and spirit for long,\r\nlong years. But your trade has eaten into your souls, and you\r\nlove American cotton better than American loyalty and American\r\nfellowship.\" This I found to be unfair, and in what politest language\r\nI could use I said so. I had not any special knowledge of the minds\r\nof English statesmen on this matter; but I knew as well as Americans\r\ncould do what our statesmen had said and done respecting it. That\r\ncotton, if it came from the South, would be made very welcome in\r\nLiverpool, of course, I knew. If private enterprise could bring it,\r\nit might be brought. But the very declaration made by Lord John\r\nRussell was the surest pledge that England as a nation would not\r\ninterfere, even to supply her own wants. It may easily be imagined\r\nwhat eager words all this would bring about; but I never found that\r\neager words led to feelings which were personally hostile.\r\n\r\nAll the world has heard of Newport in Rhode Island as being the\r\nBrighton, and Tenby, and Scarborough of New England. And the glory\r\nof Newport is by no means confined to New England, but is shared by\r\nNew York and Washington, and in ordinary years by the extreme South.\r\nIt is the habit of Americans to go to some watering place every\r\nsummer,--that is, to some place either of sea water or of inland\r\nwaters. This is done much in England; more in Ireland than in\r\nEngland; but, I think, more in the States than even in Ireland.\r\nBut of all such summer haunts, Newport is supposed to be in many\r\nways the most captivating. In the first place it is certainly the\r\nmost fashionable, and in the next place it is said to be the most\r\nbeautiful. We decided on going to Newport,--led thither by the latter\r\nreputation rather than the former. As we were still in the early part\r\nof September we expected to find the place full, but in this we were\r\ndisappointed;--disappointed, I say, rather than gratified, although\r\na crowded house at such a place is certainly a nuisance. But a house\r\nwhich is prepared to make up six hundred beds, and which is called\r\non to make up only twenty-five becomes, after a while, somewhat\r\nmelancholy. The natural depression of the landlord communicates\r\nitself to his servants, and from the servants it descends to the\r\ntwenty-five guests, who wander about the long passages and deserted\r\nbalconies like the ghosts of those of the summer visitors, who cannot\r\nrest quietly in their graves at home.\r\n\r\nIn England we know nothing of hotels prepared for six hundred\r\nvisitors, all of whom are expected to live in common. Domestic\r\narchitects would be frightened at the dimensions which are needed,\r\nand at the number of apartments which are required to be clustered\r\nunder one roof. We went to the Ocean Hotel at Newport, and fancied,\r\nas we first entered the hall under a verandah as high as the house,\r\nand made our way into the passage, that we had been taken to a\r\nwell-arranged barrack. \"Have you rooms?\" I asked, as a man always\r\ndoes ask on first reaching his inn. \"Rooms enough,\" the clerk\r\nsaid. \"We have only fifty here.\" But that fifty dwindled down to\r\ntwenty-five during the next day or two.\r\n\r\nWe were a melancholy set, the ladies appearing to be afflicted in\r\nthis way worse than the gentlemen, on account of their enforced\r\nabstinence from tobacco. What can twelve ladies do scattered about\r\na drawing-room, so-called, intended for the accommodation of two\r\nhundred? The drawing-room at the Ocean Hotel, Newport, is not as big\r\nas Westminster Hall, but would, I should think, make a very good\r\nHouse of Commons for the British nation. Fancy the feelings of a lady\r\nwhen she walks into such a room intending to spend her evening there,\r\nand finds six or seven other ladies located on various sofas at\r\nterrible distances,--all strangers to her. She has come to Newport\r\nprobably to enjoy herself; and as, in accordance with the customs of\r\nthe place, she has dined at two, she has nothing before her for the\r\nevening but the society of that huge furnished cavern. Her husband,\r\nif she have one, or her father, or her lover, has probably entered\r\nthe room with her. But a man has never the courage to endure such a\r\nposition long. He sidles out with some muttered excuse, and seeks\r\nsolace with a cigar. The lady, after half an hour of contemplation,\r\ncreeps silently near some companion in the desert, and suggests in a\r\nwhisper that Newport does not seem to be very full at present.\r\n\r\nWe stayed there for a week, and were very melancholy; but in our\r\nmelancholy we still talked of the war. Americans are said to be given\r\nto bragging, and it is a sin of which I cannot altogether acquit\r\nthem. But I have constantly been surprised at hearing the Northern\r\nmen speak of their own military achievements with anything but\r\nself-praise. \"We've been whipped, sir; and we shall be whipped again\r\nbefore we've done; uncommon well whipped we shall be.\" \"We began\r\ncowardly, and were afraid to send our own regiments through one of\r\nour own cities.\" This alluded to a demand that had been made on\r\nthe Government, that troops going to Washington should not be sent\r\nthrough Baltimore, because of the strong feeling for rebellion which\r\nwas known to exist in that city. President Lincoln complied with this\r\nrequest, thinking it well to avoid a collision between the mob and\r\nthe soldiers. \"We began cowardly, and now we're going on cowardly,\r\nand darn't attack them. Well; when we've been whipped often enough,\r\nthen we shall learn the trade.\" Now all this,--and I heard much of\r\nsuch a nature,--could not be called boasting. But yet with it all\r\nthere was a substratum of confidence. I have heard northern gentlemen\r\ncomplaining of the President, complaining of all his ministers one\r\nafter another, complaining of the contractors who were robbing the\r\narmy, of the commanders who did not know how to command the army,\r\nand of the army itself which did not know how to obey; but I do not\r\nremember that I have discussed the matter with any Northerner who\r\nwould admit a doubt as to ultimate success.\r\n\r\nWe were certainly rather melancholy at Newport, and the empty house\r\nmay perhaps have given its tone to the discussions on the war.\r\nI confess that I could not stand the drawing-room--the ladies'\r\ndrawing-room as such-like rooms are always called at the hotels,--and\r\nthat I basely deserted my wife. I could not stand it either here or\r\nelsewhere, and it seemed to me that other husbands,--ay, and even\r\nlovers,--were as hard pressed as myself. I protest that there is no\r\nspot on the earth's surface so dear to me as my own drawing-room,\r\nor rather my wife's drawing-room at home; that I am not a man\r\ngiven hugely to clubs, but one rather rejoicing in the rustle of\r\npetticoats. I like to have women in the same room with me. But at\r\nthese hotels I found myself driven away,--propelled as it were by\r\nsome unknown force,--to absent myself from the feminine haunts.\r\nAnything was more palatable than them; even \"liquoring up\" at a\r\nnasty bar, or smoking in a comfortless reading-room among a deluge\r\nof American newspapers. And I protest also,--hoping as I do so\r\nthat I may say much in these volumes to prove the truth of such\r\nprotestation,--that this comes from no fault of the American women.\r\nThey are as lovely as our own women. Taken generally, they are better\r\ninstructed--though perhaps not better educated. They are seldom\r\ntroubled with _mauvaise honte_,--I do not say it in irony, but\r\nbegging that the words may be taken at their proper meaning. They\r\ncan always talk, and very often can talk well. But when assembled\r\ntogether in these vast, cavernous, would-be luxurious, but in truth\r\nhorribly comfortless hotel drawing-rooms,--they are unapproachable.\r\nI have seen lovers, whom I have known to be lovers, unable to remain\r\nfive minutes in the same cavern with their beloved ones.\r\n\r\nAnd then the music! There is always a piano in an hotel drawing-room,\r\non which, of course, some one of the forlorn ladies is generally\r\nemployed. I do not suppose that these pianos are in fact, as a\r\nrule, louder and harsher, more violent and less musical, than other\r\ninstruments of the kind. They seem to be so, but that, I take it,\r\narises from the exceptional mental depression of those who have to\r\nlisten to them. Then the ladies, or probably some one lady, will\r\nsing, and as she hears her own voice ring and echo through the lofty\r\ncorners and round the empty walls, she is surprised at her own force,\r\nand with increased efforts sings louder and still louder. She is\r\ntempted to fancy that she is suddenly gifted with some power of vocal\r\nmelody unknown to her before, and filled with the glory of her own\r\nperformance shouts till the whole house rings. At such moments she at\r\nleast is happy, if no one else is so. Looking at the general sadness\r\nof her position, who can grudge her such happiness?\r\n\r\nAnd then the children,--babies, I should say if I were speaking of\r\nEnglish bairns of their age; but seeing that they are Americans, I\r\nhardly dare to call them children. The actual age of these perfectly\r\ncivilized and highly educated beings may be from three to four. One\r\nwill often see five or six such seated at the long dinner-table of\r\nthe hotel, breakfasting and dining with their elders, and going\r\nthrough the ceremony with all the gravity, and more than all the\r\ndecorum of their grandfathers. When I was three years old I had not\r\nyet, as I imagine, been promoted beyond a silver spoon of my own\r\nwherewith to eat my bread and milk in the nursery, and I feel assured\r\nthat I was under the immediate care of a nursemaid, as I gobbled up\r\nmy minced mutton mixed with potatoes and gravy. But at hotel life in\r\nthe States the adult infant lisps to the waiter for everything at\r\ntable, handles his fish with epicurean delicacy, is choice in his\r\nselection of pickles, very particular that his beefsteak at breakfast\r\nshall be hot, and is instant in his demand for fresh ice in his\r\nwater. But perhaps his, or in this case her, retreat from the\r\nroom when the meal is over, is the _chef d'oeuvre_ of the whole\r\nperformance. The little precocious, full-blown beauty of four\r\nsignifies that she has completed her meal,--or is \"through\" her\r\ndinner, as she would express it,--by carefully extricating herself\r\nfrom the napkin which has been tucked around her. Then the waiter,\r\never attentive to her movements, draws back the chair on which she is\r\nseated, and the young lady glides to the floor. A little girl in Old\r\nEngland would scramble down, but little girls in New England never\r\nscramble. Her father and mother, who are no more than her chief\r\nministers, walk before her out of the saloon, and then she--swims\r\nafter them. But swimming is not the proper word. Fishes in making\r\ntheir way through the water assist, or rather impede, their motion\r\nwith no dorsal riggle. No animal taught to move directly by its\r\nCreator adopts a gait so useless, and at the same time so graceless.\r\nMany women, having received their lessons in walking from a less\r\neligible instructor, do move in this way, and such women this\r\nunfortunate little lady has been instructed to copy. The peculiar\r\nstep to which I allude is to be seen often on the Boulevards in\r\nParis. It is to be seen more often in second rate French towns, and\r\namong fourth rate French women. Of all signs in women betokening\r\nvulgarity, bad taste, and aptitude to bad morals, it is the surest.\r\nAnd this is the gait of going which American mothers,--some American\r\nmothers I should say,--love to teach their daughters! As a comedy at\r\nan hotel, it is very delightful, but in private life I should object\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nTo me Newport could never be a place charming by reason of its own\r\ncharms. That it is a very pleasant place when it is full of people\r\nand the people are in spirits and happy, I do not doubt. But then the\r\nvisitors would bring, as far as I am concerned, the pleasantness with\r\nthem. The coast is not fine. To those who know the best portions of\r\nthe coast of Wales or Cornwall,--or better still, the western coast\r\nof Ireland, of Clare and Kerry for instance,--it would not be in any\r\nway remarkable. It is by no means equal to Dieppe or Biarritz, and\r\nnot to be talked of in the same breath with Spezzia. The hotels, too,\r\nare all built away from the sea; so that one cannot sit and watch the\r\nplay of the waves from one's window. Nor are there pleasant rambling\r\npaths down among the rocks, and from one short strand to another.\r\nThere is excellent bathing for those who like bathing on shelving\r\nsand. I don't. The spot is about half a mile from the hotels, and to\r\nthis the bathers are carried in omnibuses. Till one o'clock ladies\r\nbathe;--which operation, however, does not at all militate against\r\nthe bathing of men, but rather necessitates it as regards those men\r\nwho have ladies with them. For here ladies and gentlemen bathe in\r\ndecorous dresses, and are very polite to each other. I must say, that\r\nI think the ladies have the best of it. My idea of sea-bathing for\r\nmy own gratification is not compatible with a full suit of clothing.\r\nI own that my tastes are vulgar and perhaps indecent; but I love\r\nto jump into the deep clear sea from off a rock, and I love to be\r\nhampered by no outward impediments as I do so. For ordinary bathers,\r\nfor all ladies, and for men less savage in their instincts than I am,\r\nthe bathing at Newport is very good.\r\n\r\nThe private houses--villa residences as they would be termed by an\r\nauctioneer in England--are excellent. Many of them are, in fact,\r\nlarge mansions, and are surrounded with grounds, which, as the shrubs\r\ngrow up, will be very beautiful. Some have large, well-kept lawns,\r\nstretching down to the rocks, and these to my taste give the charm\r\nto Newport. They extend about two miles along the coast. Should my\r\nlot have made me a citizen of the United States, I should have had no\r\nobjection to become the possessor of one of these \"villa residences,\"\r\nbut I do not think that I should have \"gone in\" for hotel life at\r\nNewport.\r\n\r\nWe hired saddle-horses, and rode out nearly the length of the island.\r\nIt was all very well, but there was little in it remarkable either\r\nas regards cultivation or scenery. We found nothing that it would be\r\npossible either to describe or remember. The Americans of the United\r\nStates have had time to build and populate vast cities, but they have\r\nnot yet had time to surround themselves with pretty scenery. Outlying\r\ngrand scenery is given by nature; but the prettiness of home scenery\r\nis a work of art. It comes from the thorough draining of land, from\r\nthe planting and subsequent thinning of trees, from the controlling\r\nof waters, and constant use of minute patches of broken land.\r\nIn another hundred years or so Rhode Island may be, perhaps, as\r\npretty as the Isle of Wight. The horses which we got were not good.\r\nThey were unhandy and badly mouthed, and that which my wife rode\r\nwas altogether ignorant of the art of walking. We hired them\r\nfrom an Englishman, who had established himself at New York as a\r\nriding-master for ladies, and who had come to Newport for the season\r\non the same business. He complained to me with much bitterness of the\r\nsaddle-horses which came in his way,--of course thinking that it was\r\nthe special business of a country to produce saddle-horses,--as I\r\nthink it the special business of a country to produce pens, ink, and\r\npaper of good quality. According to him, riding has not yet become\r\nan American art, and hence the awkwardness of American horses. \"Lord\r\nbless you, sir! they don't give an animal a chance of a mouth.\" In\r\nthis he alluded only, I presume, to saddle-horses. I know nothing of\r\nthe trotting-horses, but I should imagine that a fine mouth must be\r\nan essential requisite for a trotting-match in harness. As regards\r\nriding at Newport, we were not tempted to repeat the experiment. The\r\nnumber of carriages which we saw there,--remembering as I did that\r\nthe place was comparatively empty,--and their general smartness,\r\nsurprised me very much. It seemed that every lady with a house of her\r\nown had also her own carriage. These carriages were always open, and\r\nthe law of the land imperatively demands that the occupants shall\r\ncover their knees with a worked worsted apron of brilliant colours.\r\nThese aprons at first, I confess, seemed tawdry; but the eye soon\r\nbecomes used to bright colours, in carriage aprons as well as in\r\narchitecture, and I soon learned to like them.\r\n\r\nRhode Island, as the State is usually called, is the smallest State\r\nin the Union. I may perhaps best show its disparity to other States\r\nby saying that New York extends about 250 miles from north to south\r\nand the same distance from east to west; whereas the State called\r\nRhode Island is about forty miles long by twenty broad, independently\r\nof certain small islands. It would, in fact, not form a considerable\r\naddition, if added on to many of the other States. Nevertheless, it\r\nhas all the same powers of self-government as are possessed by such\r\nnationalities as the States of New York and Pennsylvania; and sends\r\ntwo senators to the Senate at Washington, as do those enormous\r\nStates. Small as the State is, Rhode Island itself forms but a\r\nsmall portion of it. The authorized and proper name of the State is\r\nProvidence Plantation and Rhode Island. Roger Williams was the first\r\nfounder of the colony, and he established himself on the mainland\r\nat a spot which he called Providence. Here now stands the city of\r\nProvidence, the chief town of the State; and a thriving, comfortable\r\ntown it seems to be, full of banks, fed by railways and steamers, and\r\ngoing ahead quite as quickly as Roger Williams could in his fondest\r\nhopes have desired.\r\n\r\nRhode Island, as I have said, has all the attributes of government in\r\ncommon with her stouter and more famous sisters. She has a governor,\r\nand an upper house, and a lower house of legislature; and she is\r\nsomewhat fantastic in the use of these constitutional powers, for she\r\ncalls on them to sit now in one town and now in another. Providence\r\nis the capital of the State; but the Rhode Island parliament sits\r\nsometimes at Providence and sometimes at Newport. At stated times\r\nalso it has to collect itself at Bristol, and at other stated times\r\nat Kingston, and at others at East Greenwich. Of all legislative\r\nassemblies it is the most peripatetic. Universal suffrage does not\r\nabsolutely prevail in this State, a certain property qualification\r\nbeing necessary to confer a right to vote even for the State\r\nRepresentatives. I should think it would be well for all parties\r\nif the whole State could be swallowed up by Massachusetts or by\r\nConnecticut, either of which lie conveniently for the feat; but I\r\npresume that any suggestion of such a nature would be regarded as\r\ntreason by the men of Providence Plantation.\r\n\r\nWe returned back to Boston by Attleborough, a town at which in\r\nordinary times the whole population is supported by the jewellers'\r\ntrade. It is a place with a speciality, upon which speciality it has\r\nthriven well and become a town. But the speciality is one ill-adapted\r\nfor times of war; and we were assured that the trade was for the\r\npresent at an end. What man could now-a-days buy jewels, or even what\r\nwoman, seeing that everything would be required for the war? I do not\r\nsay that such abstinence from luxury has been begotten altogether by\r\na feeling of patriotism. The direct taxes which all Americans will\r\nnow be called on to pay, have had, and will have much to do with such\r\nabstinence. In the mean time the poor jewellers of Attleborough have\r\ngone altogether to the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND VERMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to assume that all the world in England knows that\r\nthat portion of the United States called New England consists of\r\nthe six States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Rhode Island. This is especially the land of\r\nYankees, and none can properly be called Yankees but those who belong\r\nto New England. I have named the States as nearly as may be in order\r\nfrom the North downwards. Of Rhode Island, the smallest State in the\r\nUnion, I have already said what little I have to say. Of these six\r\nStates Boston may be called the capital. Not that it is so in any\r\ncivil or political sense;--it is simply the capital of Massachusetts.\r\nBut as it is the Athens of the Western world; as it was the cradle\r\nof American freedom; as everybody of course knows that into Boston\r\nharbour was thrown the tea which George III. would tax, and that at\r\nBoston, on account of that and similar taxes, sprang up the new\r\nrevolution; and as it has grown in wealth, and fame, and size beyond\r\nother towns in New England, it may be allowed to us to regard it as\r\nthe capital of these six Northern States, without guilt of _lèse\r\nmajesté_ towards the other five. To me, I confess, this Northern\r\ndivision of our once unruly colonies is, and always has been, the\r\ndearest. I am no Puritan myself, and fancy that had I lived in\r\nthe days of the Puritans, I should have been anti-Puritan to the\r\nfull extent of my capabilities. But I should have been so through\r\nignorance and prejudice, and actuated by that love of existing rights\r\nand wrongs which men call loyalty. If the Canadas were to rebel now,\r\nI should be for putting down the Canadians with a strong hand; but\r\nnot the less have I an idea that it will become the Canadas to rebel\r\nand assert their independence at some future period;--unless it\r\nbe conceded to them without such rebellion. Who, on looking back,\r\ncan now refuse to admire the political aspirations of the English\r\nPuritans, or decline to acknowledge the beauty and fitness of what\r\nthey did? It was by them that these States of New England were\r\ncolonized. They came hither stating themselves to be pilgrims, and as\r\nsuch they first placed their feet on that hallowed rock at Plymouth,\r\non the shore of Massachusetts. They came here driven by no thirst of\r\nconquest, by no greed for gold, dreaming of no Western empire such as\r\nCortez had achieved and Raleigh had meditated. They desired to earn\r\ntheir bread in the sweat of their brow, worshipping God according to\r\ntheir own lights, living in harmony under their own laws, and feeling\r\nthat no master could claim a right to put a heel upon their necks.\r\nAnd be it remembered that here in England, in those days, earthly\r\nmasters were still apt to put their heels on the necks of men. The\r\nStar Chamber was gone, but Jeffreys had not yet reigned. What earthly\r\naspirations were ever higher than these, or more manly? And what\r\nearthly efforts ever led to grander results?\r\n\r\nWe determined to go to Portland, in Maine, from thence to the White\r\nMountains in New Hampshire--the American Alps, as they love to call\r\nthemselves,--and then on to Quebec and up through the two Canadas\r\nto Niagara; and this route we followed. From Boston to Portland we\r\ntravelled by railroad,--the carriages on which are in America always\r\ncalled cars. And here I beg, once for all, to enter my protest loudly\r\nagainst the manner in which these conveyances are conducted. The one\r\ngrand fault--there are other smaller faults--but the one grand fault\r\nis that they admit but one class. Two reasons for this are given.\r\nThe first is that the finances of the companies will not admit of\r\na divided accommodation; and the second is that the republican\r\nnature of the people will not brook a superior or aristocratic\r\nclassification of travelling. As regards the first, I do not in the\r\nleast believe in it. If a more expensive manner of railway travelling\r\nwill pay in England, it would surely do so here. Were a better class\r\nof carriages organized, as large a portion of the population would\r\nuse them in the United States as in any country in Europe. And it\r\nseems to be evident that in arranging that there shall be only one\r\nrate of travelling, the price is enhanced on poor travellers exactly\r\nin proportion as it is made cheap to those who are not poor. For the\r\npoorer classes, travelling in America is by no means cheap,--the\r\naverage rate being, as far as I can judge, fully three halfpence a\r\nmile. It is manifest that dearer rates for one class would allow\r\nof cheaper rates for the other; and that in this manner general\r\ntravelling would be encouraged and increased.\r\n\r\nBut I do not believe that the question of expenditure has had\r\nanything to do with it. I conceive it to be true that the railways\r\nare afraid to put themselves at variance with the general feeling of\r\nthe people. If so the railways may be right. But then, on the other\r\nhand, the general feeling of the people must in such case be wrong.\r\nSuch a feeling argues a total mistake as to the nature of that\r\nliberty and equality for the security of which the people are so\r\nanxious, and that mistake the very one which has made shipwreck so\r\nmany attempts at freedom in other countries. It argues that confusion\r\nbetween social and political equality which has led astray multitudes\r\nwho have longed for liberty fervently, but who have not thought of\r\nit carefully. If a first-class railway carriage should be held as\r\noffensive, so should a first-class house, or a first-class horse, or\r\na first-class dinner. But first-class houses, first-class horses,\r\nand first-class dinners are very rife in America. Of course it may\r\nbe said that the expenditure shown in these last-named objects is\r\nprivate expenditure, and cannot be controlled; and that railway\r\ntravelling is of a public nature, and can be made subject to public\r\nopinion. But the fault is in that public opinion which desires to\r\ncontrol matters of this nature. Such an arrangement partakes of all\r\nthe vice of a sumptuary law, and sumptuary laws are in their very\r\nessence mistakes. It is well that a man should always have all for\r\nwhich he is willing to pay. If he desires and obtains more than is\r\ngood for him, the punishment, and thus also the preventive, will come\r\nfrom other sources.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that the American cars are good enough for all\r\npurposes. The seats are not very hard, and the room for sitting is\r\nsufficient. Nevertheless I deny that they are good enough for all\r\npurposes. They are very long, and to enter them and find a place\r\noften requires a struggle and almost a fight. There is rarely any\r\nperson to tell a stranger which car he should enter. One never meets\r\nan uncivil or unruly man, but the women of the lower ranks are not\r\ncourteous. American ladies love to lie at ease in their carriages, as\r\nthoroughly as do our women in Hyde Park, and to those who are used\r\nto such luxury, travelling by railroad in their own country must be\r\ngrievous. I would not wish to be thought a Sybarite myself, or to be\r\nheld as complaining because I have been compelled to give up my seat\r\nto women with babies and bandboxes who have accepted the courtesy\r\nwith very scanty grace. I have borne worse things than these, and\r\nhave roughed it much in my days from want of means and other reasons.\r\nNor am I yet so old but what I can rough it still. Nevertheless\r\nI like to see things as well done as is practicable, and railway\r\ntravelling in the States is not well done. I feel bound to say as\r\nmuch as this, and now I have said it, once for all.\r\n\r\nFew cities, or localities for cities, have fairer natural advantages\r\nthan Portland--and I am bound to say that the people of Portland have\r\ndone much in turning them to account. This town is not the capital of\r\nthe State in a political point of view. Augusta, which is further to\r\nthe North, on the Kenebec river, is the seat of the State Government\r\nfor Maine. It is very generally the case that the States do not hold\r\ntheir legislatures and carry on their Government at their chief\r\ntowns. Augusta and not Portland is the capital of Maine. Of the State\r\nof New York, Albany is the capital, and not the city which bears the\r\nState's name. And of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg and not Philadelphia\r\nis the capital. I think the idea has been that old-fashioned notions\r\nwere bad in that they were old-fashioned; and that a new people,\r\nbound by no prejudices, might certainly make improvement by choosing\r\nfor themselves new ways. If so the American politicians have not been\r\nthe first in the world who have thought that any change must be a\r\nchange for the better. The assigned reason is the centrical position\r\nof the selected political capitals: but I have generally found the\r\nreal commercial capital to be easier of access than the smaller\r\ntown in which the two legislative houses are obliged to collect\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhat must be the natural excellence of the harbour of Portland will\r\nbe understood when it is borne in mind that the Great Eastern can\r\nenter it at all times, and that it can lie along the wharves at any\r\nhour of the tide. The wharves which have been prepared for her--and\r\nof which I will say a word further by-and-by--are joined to and in\r\nfact are a portion of the station of the Grand Trunk Railway, which\r\nruns from Portland up to Canada. So that passengers landing at\r\nPortland out of a vessel so large even as the Great Eastern can walk\r\nat once on shore, and goods can be passed on to the railway without\r\nany of the cost of removal. I will not say that there is no other\r\nharbour in the world that would allow of this, but I do not know any\r\nother that would do so.\r\n\r\nFrom Portland a line of railway, called as a whole by the name of the\r\nCanada Grand Trunk line, runs across the State of Maine through the\r\nNorthern parts of New Hampshire and Vermont, to Montreal, a branch\r\nstriking from Richmond, a little within the limits of Canada, to\r\nQuebec, and down the St. Lawrence to Rivière du Loup. The main line\r\nis continued from Montreal, through Upper Canada to Toronto, and from\r\nthence to Detroit in the State of Michigan. The total distance thus\r\ntraversed is in a direct line about 900 miles. From Detroit there is\r\nrailway communication through the immense North-Western States of\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois, than which perhaps the surface of\r\nthe globe affords no finer districts for purposes of agriculture. The\r\nproduce of the two Canadas must be poured forth to the Eastern world,\r\nand the men of the Eastern world must throng into these lands, by\r\nmeans of this railroad,--and, as at present arranged, through the\r\nharbour of Portland. At present the line has been opened, and they\r\nwho have opened are sorely suffering in pocket for what they have\r\ndone. The question of the railway is rather one applying to Canada\r\nthan to the State of Maine, and I will therefore leave it for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nBut the Great Eastern has never been to Portland, and as far as I\r\nknow has no intention of going there. She was, I believe, built with\r\nthat object. At any rate it was proclaimed during her building that\r\nsuch was her destiny, and the Portlanders believed it with a perfect\r\nfaith. They went to work and built wharves expressly for her; two\r\nwharves prepared to fit her two gangways, or ways of exit and\r\nentrance. They built a huge hotel to receive her passengers. They\r\nprepared for her advent with a full conviction that a millennium of\r\ntrade was about to be wafted to their happy port. \"Sir, the town has\r\nexpended two hundred thousand dollars in expectation of that ship,\r\nand that ship has deceived us.\" So was the matter spoken of to me by\r\nan intelligent Portlander. I explained to that intelligent gentleman\r\nthat two hundred thousand dollars would go a very little way towards\r\nmaking up the loss which the ill-fortuned vessel had occasioned\r\non the other side of the water. He did not in words express\r\ngratification at this information, but he looked it. The matter\r\nwas as it were a partnership without deed of contract between the\r\nPortlanders and the shareholders of the vessel, and the Portlanders,\r\nthough they also have suffered their losses, have not had the worst\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nBut there are still good days in store for the town. Though the Great\r\nEastern has not gone there, other ships from Europe, more profitable\r\nif less in size, must eventually find their way thither. At present\r\nthe Canada line of packets runs to Portland only during those months\r\nin which it is shut out from the St. Lawrence and Quebec by ice.\r\nBut the St. Lawrence and Quebec cannot offer the advantages which\r\nPortland enjoys, and that big hotel and those new wharves will not\r\nhave been built in vain.\r\n\r\nI have said that a good time is coming, but I would by no means wish\r\nto signify that the present times in Portland are bad. So far from\r\nit, that I doubt whether I ever saw a town with more evident signs of\r\nprosperity. It has about it every mark of ample means, and no mark\r\nof poverty. It contains about 27,000 people, and for that population\r\ncovers a very large space of ground. The streets are broad and\r\nwell built, the main streets not running in those absolutely\r\nstraight parallels which are so common in American towns, and are so\r\ndistressing to English eyes and English feelings. All these, except\r\nthe streets devoted exclusively to business, are shaded on both sides\r\nby trees--generally, if I remember rightly, by the beautiful American\r\nelm, whose drooping boughs have all the grace of the willow without\r\nits fantastic melancholy. What the poorer streets of Portland may be\r\nlike I cannot say. I saw no poor street. But in no town of 30,000\r\ninhabitants did I ever see so many houses which must require an\r\nexpenditure of from six to eight hundred a year to maintain them.\r\n\r\nThe place too is beautifully situated. It is on a long promontory,\r\nwhich takes the shape of a peninsula;--for the neck which joins it\r\nto the mainland is not above half a mile across. But though the\r\ntown thus stands out into the sea, it is not exposed and bleak. The\r\nharbour again is surrounded by land, or so guarded and locked by\r\nislands as to form a series of salt-water lakes running round the\r\ntown. Of those islands there are, of course, 365. Travellers who\r\nwrite their travels are constantly called upon to record that\r\nnumber, so that it may now be considered as a superlative in local\r\nphraseology, signifying a very great many indeed. The town stands\r\nbetween two hills, the suburbs or outskirts running up on to each of\r\nthem. The one looking out towards the sea is called Mountjoy--though\r\nthe obstinate Americans will write it Munjoy on their maps. From\r\nthence the view out to the harbour and beyond the harbour to the\r\nislands is, I may not say unequalled, or I shall be guilty of running\r\ninto superlatives myself; but it is, in its way, equal to anything I\r\nhave seen. Perhaps it is more like Cork harbour, as seen from certain\r\nheights over Passage than anything else I can remember; but Portland\r\nharbour, though equally landlocked, is larger; and then from Portland\r\nharbour there is as it were a river outlet, running through delicious\r\nislands, most unalluring to the navigator, but delicious to the eyes\r\nof an uncommercial traveller. There are in all four outlets to the\r\nsea, one of which appears to have been made expressly for the Great\r\nEastern. Then there is the hill looking inwards. If it has a name\r\nI forget it. The view from this hill is also over the water on each\r\nside, and though not so extensive is perhaps as pleasing as the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe ways of the people seemed to be quiet, smooth, orderly, and\r\nrepublican. There is nothing to drink in Portland of course, for,\r\nthanks to Mr. Neal Dow, the Father Mathew of the State of Maine, the\r\nMaine Liquor Law is still in force in that State. There is nothing\r\nto drink, I should say, in such orderly houses as that I selected.\r\n\"People do drink some in the town, they say,\" said my hostess to\r\nme; \"and liquor is to be got. But I never venture to sell any. An\r\nill-natured person might turn on me, and where should I be then?\" I\r\ndid not press her, and she was good enough to put a bottle of porter\r\nat my right hand at dinner, for which I observed she made no charge.\r\n\"But they advertise beer in the shop-windows,\" I said to a man\r\nwho was driving me--\"Scotch ale, and bitter beer. A man can get\r\ndrunk on them.\" \"Wa'al, yes. If he goes to work hard, and drinks a\r\nbucket-full,\" said the driver, \"perhaps he may.\" From which and other\r\nthings I gathered that the men of Maine drank pottle deep before Mr.\r\nNeal Dow brought his exertions to a successful termination.\r\n\r\nThe Maine Liquor Law still stands in Maine, and is the law of the\r\nland throughout New England; but it is not actually put in force in\r\nthe other States. By this law no man may retail wine, spirits, or, in\r\ntruth, beer, except with a special license, which is given only to\r\nthose who are presumed to sell them as medicines. A man may have what\r\nhe likes in his own cellar for his own use--such at least is the\r\nactual working of the law--but may not obtain it at hotels and\r\npublic-houses. This law, like all sumptuary laws, must fail. And it\r\nis fast failing even in Maine. But it did appear to me from such\r\ninformation as I could collect that the passing of it had done much\r\nto hinder and repress a habit of hard drinking which was becoming\r\nterribly common, not only in the towns of Maine, but among the\r\nfarmers and hired labourers in the country.\r\n\r\nBut if the men and women of Portland may not drink they may eat, and\r\nit is a place, I should say, in which good living on that side of the\r\nquestion is very rife. It has an air of supreme plenty, as though the\r\nagonies of an empty stomach were never known there. The faces of the\r\npeople tell of three regular meals of meat a day, and of digestive\r\npowers in proportion. Oh happy Portlanders, if they only knew their\r\nown good fortune! They get up early, and go to bed early. The women\r\nare comely and sturdy, able to take care of themselves without\r\nany fal-lal of chivalry; and the men are sedate, obliging, and\r\nindustrious. I saw the young girls in the streets, coming home from\r\ntheir tea-parties at nine o'clock, many of them alone, and all with\r\nsome basket in their hands which betokened an evening not passed\r\nabsolutely in idleness. No fear there of unruly questions on the way,\r\nor of insolence from the ill-conducted of the other sex! All was, or\r\nseemed to be, orderly, sleek, and unobtrusive. Probably of all modes\r\nof life that are allotted to man by his Creator, life such as this is\r\nthe most happy. One hint, however, for improvement I must give, even\r\nto Portland! It would be well if they could make their streets of\r\nsome material harder than sand.\r\n\r\nI must not leave the town without desiring those who may visit it to\r\nmount the Observatory. They will from thence get the best view of the\r\nharbour and of the surrounding land; and, if they chance to do so\r\nunder the reign of the present keeper of the signals, they will find\r\na man there able and willing to tell them everything needful about\r\nthe State of Maine in general, and the harbour in particular. He will\r\ncome out in his shirt sleeves, and, like a true American, will not\r\nat first be very smooth in his courtesy; but he will wax brighter in\r\nconversation, and if not stroked the wrong way will turn out to be an\r\nuncommonly pleasant fellow. Such I believe to be the case with most\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nFrom Portland we made our way up to the White Mountains, which lay on\r\nour route to Canada. Now I would ask any of my readers who are candid\r\nenough to expose their own ignorance whether they ever heard, or\r\nat any rate whether they know anything of the White Mountains. As\r\nregards myself I confess that the name had reached my ears; that I\r\nhad an indefinite idea that they formed an intermediate stage between\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies, and that they were inhabited\r\neither by Mormons, Indians, or simply by black bears. That there was\r\na district in New England containing mountain scenery superior to\r\nmuch that is yearly crowded by tourists in Europe, that this is\r\nto be reached with ease by railways and stage-coaches, and that\r\nit is dotted with huge hotels, almost as thickly as they lie in\r\nSwitzerland, I had no idea. Much of this scenery, I say, is superior\r\nto the famed and classic lands of Europe. I know nothing, for\r\ninstance, on the Rhine equal to the view from Mount Willard, down the\r\nmountain pass called the Notch.\r\n\r\nLet the visitor of these regions be as late in the year as he can,\r\ntaking care that he is not so late as to find the hotels closed.\r\nOctober, no doubt, is the most beautiful month among these mountains,\r\nbut according to the present arrangement of matters here, the hotels\r\nare shut up by the end of September. With us, August, September, and\r\nOctober are the holiday months; whereas our rebel children across the\r\nAtlantic love to disport themselves in July and August. The great\r\nbeauty of the autumn, or fall, is in the brilliant hues which are\r\nthen taken by the foliage. The autumnal tints are fine with us. They\r\nare lovely and bright wherever foliage and vegetation form a part\r\nof the beauty of scenery. But in no other land do they approach the\r\nbrilliancy of the fall in America. The bright rose colour, the rich\r\nbronze which is almost purple in its richness, and the glorious\r\ngolden yellows must be seen to be understood. By me at any rate they\r\ncannot be described. These begin to show themselves in September, and\r\nperhaps I might name the latter half of that month as the best time\r\nfor visiting the White Mountains.\r\n\r\nI am not going to write a guide-book, feeling sure that Mr. Murray\r\nwill do New England, and Canada, including Niagara and the Hudson\r\nriver, with a peep into Boston and New York before many more seasons\r\nhave passed by. But I cannot forbear to tell my countrymen that\r\nany enterprising individual with a hundred pounds to spend on his\r\nholiday,--a hundred and twenty would make him more comfortable, in\r\nregard to wine, washing, and other luxuries,--and an absence of two\r\nmonths from his labours, may see as much and do as much here for the\r\nmoney as he can see or do elsewhere. In some respects he may do more;\r\nfor he will learn more of American nature in such a journey than he\r\ncan ever learn of the nature of Frenchmen or Americans by such an\r\nexcursion among them. Some three weeks of the time, or perhaps a day\r\nor two over, he must be at sea, and that portion of his trip will\r\ncost him fifty pounds,--presuming that he chooses to go in the most\r\ncomfortable and costly way;--but his time on board ship will not be\r\nlost. He will learn to know much of Americans there, and will perhaps\r\nform acquaintances of which he will not altogether lose sight for\r\nmany a year. He will land at Boston, and staying a day or two there\r\nwill visit Cambridge, Lowell, and Bunker Hill; and, if he be that\r\nway given, will remember that here live, and occasionally are to\r\nbe seen alive, men such as Longfellow, Emerson, Hawthorne, and a\r\nhost of others whose names and fames have made Boston the throne of\r\nWestern Literature. He will then,--if he take my advice and follow\r\nmy track,--go by Portland up into the White Mountains. At Gorham, a\r\nstation on the Grand Trunk line, he will find an hotel as good as any\r\nof its kind, and from thence he will take a light waggon, so called\r\nin these countries;--and here let me presume that the traveller\r\nis not alone; he has his wife or friend, or perhaps a pair of\r\nsisters,--and in his waggon he will go up through primeval forests to\r\nthe Glen House. When there he will ascend Mount Washington on a pony.\r\nThat is _de rigueur_, and I do not, therefore, dare to recommend him\r\nto omit the ascent. I did not gain much myself by my labour. He will\r\nnot stay at the Glen House, but will go on to--Jackson's I think they\r\ncall the next hotel; at which he will sleep. From thence he will take\r\nhis waggon on through the Notch to the Crawford House, sleeping there\r\nagain; and when here let him of all things remember to go up Mount\r\nWillard. It is but a walk of two hours, up and down, if so much. When\r\nreaching the top he will be startled to find that he looks down into\r\nthe ravine without an inch of fore-ground. He will come out suddenly\r\non a ledge of rock, from whence, as it seems, he might leap down at\r\nonce into the valley below. Then going on from the Crawford House\r\nhe will be driven through the woods of Cherry Mount, passing,\r\nI fear without toll of custom, the house of my excellent friend\r\nMr. Plaistead, who keeps an hotel at Jefferson. \"Sir,\" said Mr.\r\nPlaistead, \"I have everything here that a man ought to want; air,\r\nsir, that ain't to be got better nowhere; trout, chickens, beef,\r\nmutton, milk,--and all for a dollar a day. A top of that hill, sir,\r\nthere's a view that ain't to be beaten this side of the Atlantic, or\r\nI believe the other. And an echo, sir!--We've an echo that comes back\r\nto us six times, sir; floating on the light wind, and wafted about\r\nfrom rock to rock till you would think the angels were talking to\r\nyou. If I could raise that echo, sir, every day at command I'd give a\r\nthousand dollars for it. It would be worth all the money to a house\r\nlike this.\" And he waved his hand about from hill to hill, pointing\r\nout in graceful curves the lines which the sounds would take. Had\r\ndestiny not called on Mr. Plaistead to keep an American hotel, he\r\nmight have been a poet.\r\n\r\nMy traveller, however, unless time were plenty with him, would pass\r\nMr. Plaistead, merely lighting a friendly cigar, or perhaps breaking\r\nthe Maine Liquor Law if the weather be warm, and would return to\r\nGorham on the railway. All this mountain district is in New\r\nHampshire, and presuming him to be capable of going about the world\r\nwith his mouth, ears, and eyes open, he would learn much of the way\r\nin which men are settling themselves in this still sparsely populated\r\ncountry. Here young farmers go into the woods, as they are doing\r\nfar down west in the Territories, and buying some hundred acres at\r\nperhaps six shillings an acre, fell and burn the trees and build\r\ntheir huts, and take the first steps, as far as man's work is\r\nconcerned, towards accomplishing the will of the Creator in those\r\nregions. For such pioneers of civilization there is still ample room\r\neven in the long settled States of New Hampshire and Vermont.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my traveller, whom having brought so far, I must\r\nsend on. Let him go on from Gorham to Quebec, and the heights of\r\nAbraham, stopping at Sherbrooke that he might visit from thence the\r\nlake of Memphra Magog. As to the manner of travelling over this\r\nground I shall say a little in the next chapter, when I come to the\r\nprogress of myself and my wife. From Quebec he will go up the St.\r\nLawrence to Montreal. He will visit Ottawa, the new capital, and\r\nToronto. He will cross the Lake to Niagara, resting probably at the\r\nClifton House on the Canada side. He will then pass on to Albany,\r\ntaking the Trenton falls on his way. From Albany he will go down the\r\nHudson to West-Point. He cannot stop at the Catskill Mountains, for\r\nthe hotel will be closed. And then he will take the river boat, and\r\nin a few hours will find himself at New York. If he desires to go\r\ninto American city society, he will find New York agreeable; but in\r\nthat case he must exceed his two months. If he do not so desire, a\r\nshort sojourn at New York will show him all that there is to be seen,\r\nand all that there is not to be seen in that great city. That the\r\nCunard line of steamers will bring him safely back to Liverpool\r\nin about eleven days, I need not tell to any Englishman, or, as\r\nI believe, to any American. So much, in the spirit of a guide,\r\nI vouchsafe to all who are willing to take my counsel,--thereby\r\nanticipating Murray, and leaving these few pages as a legacy to him\r\nor to his collaborateurs.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I like the hotels in those parts, or indeed the\r\nmode of life at American hotels in general. In order that I may not\r\nunjustly defame them, I will commence these observations by declaring\r\nthat they are cheap to those who choose to practise the economy which\r\nthey encourage, that the viands are profuse in quantity and wholesome\r\nin quality, that the attendance is quick and unsparing, and that\r\ntravellers are never annoyed by that grasping greedy hunger and\r\nthirst after francs and shillings which disgrace in Europe many\r\nEnglish and many continental inns. All this is, as must be admitted,\r\ngreat praise; and yet I do not like the American hotels.\r\n\r\nOne is in a free country and has come from a country in which one\r\nhas been brought up to hug one's chains,--so at least the English\r\ntraveller is constantly assured--and yet in an American inn one can\r\nnever do as one likes. A terrific gong sounds early in the morning,\r\nbreaking one's sweet slumbers, and then a second gong sounding some\r\nthirty minutes later, makes you understand that you must proceed to\r\nbreakfast, whether you be dressed or no. You certainly can go on with\r\nyour toilet and obtain your meal after half an hour's delay. Nobody\r\nactually scolds you for so doing, but the breakfast is, as they say\r\nin this country, \"through.\" You sit down alone, and the attendant\r\nstands immediately over you. Probably there are two so standing. They\r\nfill your cup the instant it is empty. They tender you fresh food\r\nbefore that which has disappeared from your plate has been swallowed.\r\nThey begrudge you no amount that you can eat or drink; but they\r\nbegrudge you a single moment that you sit there neither eating nor\r\ndrinking. This is your fate if you're too late, and therefore as a\r\nrule you are not late. In that case you form one of a long row of\r\neaters who proceed through their work with a solid energy that is\r\npast all praise. It is wrong to say that Americans will not talk at\r\ntheir meals. I never met but few who would not talk to me, at any\r\nrate till I got to the far west; but I have rarely found that they\r\nwould address me first. Then the dinner comes early; at least it\r\nalways does so in New England, and the ceremony is much of the same\r\nkind. You came there to eat, and the food is pressed on you almost\r\n_ad nauseam_. But as far as one can see there is no drinking. In\r\nthese days, I am quite aware, that drinking has become improper, even\r\nin England. We are apt at home to speak of wine as a thing tabooed,\r\nwondering how our fathers lived and swilled. I believe that as a fact\r\nwe drink as much as they did; but nevertheless that is our theory. I\r\nconfess, however, that I like wine. It is very wicked, but it seems\r\nto me that my dinner goes down better with a glass of sherry than\r\nwithout it. As a rule I always did get it at hotels in America.\r\nBut I had no comfort with it. Sherry they do not understand at\r\nall. Of course I am only speaking of hotels. Their claret they get\r\nexclusively from Mr. Gladstone, and looking at the quality, have a\r\nright to quarrel even with Mr. Gladstone's price. But it is not the\r\nquality of the wine that I hereby intend to subject to ignominy, so\r\nmuch as the want of any opportunity for drinking it. After dinner,\r\nif all that I hear be true, the gentlemen occasionally drop into the\r\nhotel bar and \"liquor up.\" Or rather this is not done specially after\r\ndinner, but without prejudice to the hour at any time that may be\r\nfound desirable. I also have \"liquored up,\" but I cannot say that\r\nI enjoy the process. I do not intend hereby to accuse Americans of\r\ndrinking much, but I maintain that what they do drink, they drink in\r\nthe most uncomfortable manner that the imagination can devise.\r\n\r\nThe greatest luxury at an English inn is one's tea, one's fire, and\r\none's book. Such an arrangement is not practicable at an American\r\nhotel. Tea, like breakfast, is a great meal, at which meat should\r\nbe eaten, generally with the addition of much jelly, jam, and sweet\r\npreserve; but no person delays over his tea-cup. I love to have my\r\ntea-cup emptied and filled with gradual pauses, so that time for\r\noblivion may accrue, and no exact record be taken. No such meal is\r\nknown at American hotels. It is possible to hire a separate room and\r\nhave one's meals served in it; but in doing so a man runs counter to\r\nall the institutions of the country, and a woman does so equally. A\r\nstranger does not wish to be viewed askance by all around him; and\r\nthe rule which holds that men at Rome should do as Romans do, if true\r\nanywhere, is true in America. Therefore I say that in an American inn\r\none can never do as one pleases.\r\n\r\nIn what I have here said I do not intend to speak of hotels in the\r\nlargest cities, such as Boston or New York. At them meals are served\r\nin the public room separately, and pretty nearly at any or at all\r\nhours of the day; but at them also the attendant stands over the\r\nunfortunate eater, and drives him. The guest feels that he is\r\ncontrolled by laws adapted to the usages of the Medes and Persians.\r\nHe is not the master on the occasion, but the slave; a slave well\r\ntreated and fattened up to the full endurance of humanity; but yet a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nFrom Gorham we went on to Island Pond, a station on the same Canada\r\nTrunk Railway, on a Saturday evening, and were forced by the\r\ncircumstances of the line to pass a melancholy Sunday at the place.\r\nThe cars do not run on Sundays, and run but once a day on other days\r\nover the whole line; so that in fact the impediment to travelling\r\nspreads over two days. Island Pond is a lake with an island in it,\r\nand the place which has taken the name is a small village, about\r\nten years old, standing in the midst of uncut forests, and has been\r\ncreated by the railway. In ten years more there will no doubt be\r\na spreading town at Island Pond; the forests will recede, and men\r\nrushing out from the crowded cities will find here food and space\r\nand wealth. For myself I never remain long in such a spot without\r\nfeeling thankful that it has not been my mission to be a pioneer of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe farther that I got away from Boston the less strong did I find\r\nthe feeling of anger against England. There, as I have said before,\r\nthere was a bitter animosity against the mother country in that she\r\nhad shown no open sympathy with the North. In Maine and New Hampshire\r\nI did not find this to be the case to any violent degree. Men spoke\r\nof the war as openly as they did at Boston, and in speaking to me\r\ngenerally connected England with the subject. But they did so simply\r\nto ask questions as to England's policy. What will she do for cotton\r\nwhen her operatives are really pressed? Will she break the blockade?\r\nWill she insist on a right to trade with Charlestown and New Orleans?\r\nI always answered that she would insist on no such right, if that\r\nright were denied to others and the denial enforced. England, I took\r\nupon myself to say, would not break a veritable blockade, let her be\r\ndriven to what shifts she might in providing for her operatives. \"Ah;\r\nthat's what we fear,\" a very stanch patriot said to me, if words may\r\nbe taken as a proof of stanchness. \"If England allies herself with\r\nthe Southerners, all our trouble is for nothing.\" It was impossible\r\nnot to feel that all that was said was complimentary to England. It\r\nis her sympathy that the Northern men desire, to her co-operation\r\nthat they would willingly trust, on her honesty that they would\r\nchoose to depend. It is the same feeling whether it shows itself\r\nin anger or in curiosity. An American whether he be embarked in\r\npolitics, in literature, or in commerce, desires English admiration,\r\nEnglish appreciation of his energy, and English encouragement. The\r\nanger of Boston is but a sign of its affectionate friendliness. What\r\nfeeling is so hot as that of a friend when his dearest friend refuses\r\nto share his quarrel or to sympathize in his wrongs? To my thinking\r\nthe men of Boston are wrong and unreasonable in their anger; but were\r\nI a man of Boston I should be as wrong and as unreasonable as any\r\nof them. All that, however, will come right. I will not believe it\r\npossible that there should in very truth be a quarrel between England\r\nand the Northern States.\r\n\r\nIn the guidance of those who are not quite _au fait_ at the details\r\nof American Government, I will here in a few words describe the\r\noutlines of State Government as it is arranged in New Hampshire.\r\nThe States in this respect are not all alike, the modes of election\r\nof their officers and periods of service being different. Even the\r\nfranchise is different in different States. Universal suffrage is not\r\nthe rule throughout the United States; though it is I believe very\r\ngenerally thought in England that such is the fact. I need hardly\r\nsay that the laws in the different States may be as various as the\r\ndifferent legislatures may choose to make them.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire universal suffrage does prevail; which means that\r\nany man may vote who lives in the State, supports himself, and\r\nassists to support the poor by means of poor rates. A governor of the\r\nState is elected for one year only, but it is customary or at any\r\nrate not uncustomary to re-elect him for a second year. His salary is\r\na thousand dollars a year, or £200. It must be presumed therefore\r\nthat glory and not money is his object. To him is appended a council,\r\nby whose opinions he must in a great degree be guided. His functions\r\nare to the State what those of the President are to the country, and\r\nfor the short period of his reign he is as it were a Prime Minister\r\nof the State with certain very limited regal attributes. He however\r\nby no means enjoys the regal attribute of doing no wrong. In every\r\nState there is an Assembly, consisting of two houses of elected\r\nrepresentatives; the Senate, or upper house, and the House of\r\nRepresentatives so called. In New Hampshire this Assembly, or\r\nParliament, is styled The General Court of New Hampshire. It sits\r\nannually; whereas the legislature in many States sits only every\r\nother year. Both Houses are re-elected every year. This Assembly\r\npasses laws with all the power vested in our Parliament, but such\r\nlaws apply of course only to the State in question. The Governor\r\nof the State has a veto on all bills passed by the two Houses. But,\r\nafter receipt of his veto, any bill so stopped by the Governor can\r\nbe passed by a majority of two thirds in each House. The General\r\nCourt usually sits for about ten weeks. There are in the State eight\r\njudges, three Supreme who sit at Concord, the capital, as a court\r\nof appeal both in civil and criminal matters; and then five lesser\r\njudges, who go circuit through the State. The salaries of these\r\nlesser judges do not exceed from £250 to £300 a year; but they are, I\r\nbelieve, allowed to practise as lawyers in any counties except those\r\nin which they sit as judges,--being guided in this respect by the\r\nsame law as that which regulates the work of assistant barristers\r\nin Ireland. The assistant barristers in Ireland are attached to the\r\ncounties as judges at Quarter Sessions, but they practise or may\r\npractise as advocates in all counties except that to which they\r\nare so attached. The judges in New Hampshire are appointed by\r\nthe Governor with the assistance of his Council. No judge in New\r\nHampshire can hold his seat after he has reached seventy years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nSo much at the present moment with reference to the Government of New\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLOWER CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Railway runs directly from Portland to Montreal,\r\nwhich latter town is, in fact, the capital of Canada, though it never\r\nhas been so exclusively, and, as it seems, never is to be so, as\r\nregards authority, government, and official name. In such matters\r\nauthority and government often say one thing while commerce says\r\nanother; but commerce always has the best of it and wins the game\r\nwhatever Government may decree. Albany in this way is the capital of\r\nthe State of New York, as authorized by the State Government; but New\r\nYork has made herself the capital of America, and will remain so. So\r\nalso Montreal has made herself the capital of Canada. The Grand Trunk\r\nRailway runs from Portland to Montreal; but there is a branch from\r\nRichmond, a township within the limits of Canada, to Quebec; so that\r\ntravellers to Quebec, as we were, are not obliged to reach that place\r\n_viâ_ Montreal.\r\n\r\nQuebec is the present seat of Canadian Government, its turn for that\r\nhonour having come round some two years ago; but it is about to be\r\ndeserted in favour of Ottawa, a town which is, in fact, still to be\r\nbuilt on the river of that name. The public edifices are, however, in\r\na state of forwardness; and if all goes well the Governor, the two\r\nCouncils, and the House of Representatives will be there before\r\ntwo years are over whether there be any town to receive them or no.\r\nWho can think of Ottawa without bidding his brothers to row, and\r\nreminding them that the stream runs fast, that the rapids are near\r\nand the daylight past? I asked, as a matter of course, whether Quebec\r\nwas much disgusted at the proposed change, and I was told that the\r\nfeeling was not now very strong. Had it been determined to make\r\nMontreal the permanent seat of government Quebec and Toronto would\r\nboth have been up in arms.\r\n\r\nI must confess that in going from the States into Canada, an\r\nEnglishman is struck by the feeling that he is going from a richer\r\ncountry into one that is poorer, and from a greater country into one\r\nthat is less. An Englishman going from a foreign land into a land\r\nwhich is in one sense his own, of course finds much in the change to\r\ngratify him. He is able to speak as the master, instead of speaking\r\nas the visitor. His tongue becomes more free, and he is able to fall\r\nback to his national habits and national expressions. He no longer\r\nfeels that he is admitted on sufferance, or that he must be careful\r\nto respect laws which he does not quite understand. This feeling was\r\nnaturally strong in an Englishman in passing from the States into\r\nCanada at the time of my visit. English policy at that moment was\r\nviolently abused by Americans, and was upheld as violently in Canada.\r\nBut, nevertheless, with all this, I could not enter Canada without\r\nseeing, and hearing, and feeling that there was less of enterprise\r\naround me there than in the States--less of general movement, and\r\nless of commercial success. To say why this is so would require a\r\nlong and very difficult discussion, and one which I am not prepared\r\nto hold. It may be that a dependent country, let the feeling of\r\ndependence be ever so much modified by powers of self-governance,\r\ncannot hold its own against countries which are in all respects their\r\nown masters. Few, I believe, would now maintain that the Northern\r\nStates of America would have risen in commerce as they have risen,\r\nhad they still remained attached to England as colonies. If this be\r\nso, that privilege of self-rule which they have acquired, has been\r\nthe cause of their success. It does not follow as a consequence that\r\nthe Canadas fighting their battle alone in the world could do as\r\nthe States have done. Climate, or size, or geographical position\r\nmight stand in their way. But I fear that it does follow, if not as a\r\nlogical conclusion at least as a natural result, that they never will\r\ndo so well unless some day they shall so fight their battle. It may\r\nbe argued that Canada has in fact the power of self-governance; that\r\nshe rules herself and makes her own laws as England does; that the\r\nSovereign of England has but a veto on those laws, and stands in\r\nregard to Canada exactly as she does in regard to England. This is\r\nso, I believe, by the letter of the Constitution, but is not so in\r\nreality, and cannot, in truth, be so in any colony, even of Great\r\nBritain. In England the political power of the Crown is nothing. The\r\nCrown has no such power, and now-a-days makes no attempt at having\r\nany. But the political power of the Crown, as it is felt in Canada,\r\nis everything. The Crown has no such power in England because it must\r\nchange its ministers whenever called upon to do so by the House of\r\nCommons. But the Colonial Minister in Downing Street is the Crown's\r\nPrime Minister as regards the Colonies, and he is changed not as any\r\nColonial House of Assembly may wish, but in accordance with the will\r\nof the British Commons. Both the Houses in Canada--that, namely,\r\nof the Representatives, or Lower House, and of the Legislative\r\nCouncil, or Upper House--are now elective, and are filled without\r\ndirect influence from the Crown. The power of self-government is\r\nas thoroughly developed as perhaps may be possible in a colony. But\r\nafter all it is a dependent form of government, and as such may\r\nperhaps not conduce to so thorough a development of the resources of\r\nthe country as might be achieved under a ruling power of its own, to\r\nwhich the welfare of Canada itself would be the chief if not the only\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nI beg that it may not be considered from this that I would propose to\r\nCanada to set up for itself at once and declare itself independent.\r\nIn the first place I do not wish to throw over Canada; and in the\r\nnext place I do not wish to throw over England. If such a separation\r\nshall ever take place, I trust that it may be caused, not by Canadian\r\nviolence but by British generosity. Such a separation, however, never\r\ncan be good till Canada herself shall wish it. That she does not\r\nwish it yet is certain. If Canada ever should wish it, and should\r\never press for the accomplishment of such a wish, she must do so in\r\nconnection with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. If at any future time\r\nthere be formed such a separate political power, it must include the\r\nwhole of British North America.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I return to my assertion, that in entering Canada\r\nfrom the States one clearly comes from a richer to a poorer country.\r\nWhen I have said so, I have heard no Canadian absolutely deny it;\r\nthough in refraining from denying it, they have usually expressed a\r\ngeneral conviction, that in settling himself for life, it is better\r\nfor a man to set up his staff in Canada than in the States. \"I do not\r\nknow that we are richer,\" a Canadian says, \"but on the whole we are\r\ndoing better and are happier.\" Now, I regard the golden rules against\r\nthe love of gold, the \"_aurum irrepertum et sic melius situm_,\" and\r\nthe rest of it, as very excellent when applied to individuals. Such\r\nteaching has not much effect, perhaps, in inducing men to abstain\r\nfrom wealth,--but such effect as it may have will be good. Men and\r\nwomen do, I suppose, learn to be happier when they learn to disregard\r\nriches. But such a doctrine is absolutely false as regards a nation.\r\nNational wealth produces education and progress, and through them\r\nproduces plenty of food, good morals, and all else that is good.\r\nIt produces luxury also, and certain evils attendant on luxury.\r\nBut I think it may be clearly shown, and that it is universally\r\nacknowledged, that national wealth produces individual well-being. If\r\nthis be so, the argument of my friend the Canadian is nought.\r\n\r\nTo the feeling of a refined gentleman, or of a lady whose eye loves\r\nto rest always on the beautiful, an agricultural population that\r\ntouches its hat, eats plain victuals, and goes to church is more\r\npicturesque and delightful than the thronged crowd of a great city by\r\nwhich a lady and gentleman is hustled without remorse, which never\r\ntouches its hat, and perhaps also never goes to church. And as we\r\nare always tempted to approve of that which we like, and to think\r\nthat that which is good to us is good altogether, we--the refined\r\ngentlemen and ladies of England I mean--are very apt to prefer the\r\nhat-touchers to those who are not hat-touchers. In doing so we\r\nintend, and wish, and strive to be philanthropical. We argue to\r\nourselves that the dear, excellent lower classes receive an immense\r\namount of consoling happiness from that ceremony of hat-touching,\r\nand quite pity those who, unfortunately for themselves, know nothing\r\nabout it. I would ask any such lady or gentleman whether he or she\r\ndoes not feel a certain amount of commiseration for the rudeness of\r\nthe town-bred artisan, who walks about with his hands in his pockets\r\nas though he recognized a superior in no one.\r\n\r\nBut that which is good and pleasant to us, is often not good and\r\npleasant altogether. Every man's chief object is himself; and the\r\nphilanthropist should endeavour to regard this question, not from\r\nhis own point of view, but from that which would be taken by the\r\nindividuals for whose happiness he is anxious. The honest, happy\r\nrustic makes a very pretty picture; and I hope that honest rustics\r\nare happy. But the man who earns two shillings a day in the country\r\nwould always prefer to earn five in the town. The man who finds\r\nhimself bound to touch his hat to the squire would be glad to\r\ndispense with that ceremony, if circumstances would permit. A crowd\r\nof greasy-coated town artisans with grimy hands and pale faces, is\r\nnot in itself delectable; but each of that crowd has probably more\r\nof the goods of life than any rural labourer. He thinks more, reads\r\nmore, feels more, sees more, hears more, learns more, and lives more.\r\nIt is through great cities that the civilization of the world has\r\nprogressed, and the charms of life been advanced. Man in his rudest\r\nstate begins in the country, and in his most finished state may\r\nretire there. But the battle of the world has to be fought in the\r\ncities; and the country that shows the greatest city population is\r\never the one that is going most ahead in the world's history.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, I say that the argument of my Canadian friend was\r\nnought. It may be that he does not desire crowded cities with\r\ndirty, independent artisans; that to his view small farmers, living\r\nsparingly but with content on the sweat of their brows, are surer\r\nsigns of a country's prosperity than hives of men and smoking\r\nchimneys. He has, probably, all the upper classes of England with him\r\nin so thinking, and as far as I know the upper classes of all Europe.\r\nBut the crowds themselves, the thick masses of which are composed\r\nthose populations which we count by millions, are against him. Up in\r\nthose regions which are watered by the great lakes, Lake Michigan,\r\nLake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and by the St. Lawrence, the\r\ncountry is divided between Canada and the States. The cities in\r\nCanada were settled long before those in the States. Quebec and\r\nMontreal were important cities before any of the towns belonging to\r\nthe States had been founded. But taking the population of three of\r\neach, including the three largest Canadian towns, we find they are\r\nas follows:--In Canada, Quebec has 60,000; Montreal, 85,000; Toronto,\r\n55,000. In the States, Chicago has 120,000; Detroit, 70,000; and\r\nBuffalo, 80,000. If the population had been equal, it would have\r\nshown a great superiority in the progress of those belonging to the\r\nStates, because the towns of Canada had so great a start. But the\r\nnumbers are by no means equal, showing instead a vast preponderance\r\nin favour of the States. There can be no stronger proof that the\r\nStates are advancing faster than Canada,--and in fact doing better\r\nthan Canada. Quebec is a very picturesque town,--from its natural\r\nadvantages almost as much so as any town I know. Edinburgh, perhaps,\r\nand Innspruck may beat it. But Quebec has very little to recommend it\r\nbeyond the beauty of its situation. Its public buildings and works of\r\nart do not deserve a long narrative. It stands at the confluence of\r\nthe St. Lawrence and St. Charles rivers; the best part of the town is\r\nbuilt high upon the rock,--the rock which forms the celebrated plains\r\nof Abram; and the view from thence down to the mountains which shut\r\nin the St. Lawrence is magnificent. The best point of view is, I\r\nthink, from the esplanade, which is distant some five minutes' walk\r\nfrom the hotels. When that has been seen by the light of the setting\r\nsun, and seen again, if possible, by moonlight, the most considerable\r\nlion of Quebec may be regarded as \"done,\" and may be ticked off from\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable lion according to my taste. Lions which roar\r\nmerely by the force of association of ideas are not to me very\r\nvaluable beasts. To many the rock over which Wolfe climbed to the\r\nplains of Abram, and on the summit of which he fell in the hour of\r\nvictory, gives to Quebec its chiefest charm. But I confess to being\r\nsomewhat dull in such matters. I can count up Wolfe, and realize his\r\nglory, and put my hand as it were upon his monument, in my own room\r\nat home as well as I can at Quebec. I do not say this boastingly or\r\nwith pride, but truly acknowledging a deficiency. I have never cared\r\nto sit in chairs in which old kings have sat, or to have their crowns\r\nupon my head.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and as a matter of course, I went to see the rock,\r\nand can only say, as so many have said before me, that it is very\r\nsteep. It is not a rock which I think it would be difficult for\r\nany ordinarily active man to climb,--providing, of course, that he\r\nwas used to such work. But Wolfe took regiments of men up there at\r\nnight--and that in face of enemies who held the summits. One grieves\r\nthat he should have fallen there and have never tasted the sweet cup\r\nof his own fame. For fame is sweet, and the praise of one's brother\r\nmen the sweetest draught which a man can drain. But now, and for\r\ncoming ages, Wolfe's name stands higher than it probably would have\r\ndone had he lived to enjoy his reward.\r\n\r\nBut there is another very worthy lion near Quebec,--the Falls,\r\nnamely, of Montmorency. They are eight miles from the town, and the\r\nroad lies through the suburb of St. Roch, and the long straggling\r\nFrench village of Beauport. These are in themselves very interesting,\r\nas showing the quiet, orderly, unimpulsive manner in which the French\r\nCanadians live. Such is their character, although there have been\r\nsuch men as Papineau, and although there have been times in which\r\nEnglish rule has been unpopular with the French settlers. As far as\r\nI could learn there is no such feeling now. These people are quiet,\r\ncontented; and as regards a sufficiency of the simple staples of\r\nliving, sufficiently well to do. They are thrifty;--but they do not\r\nthrive. They do not advance, and push ahead, and become a bigger\r\npeople from year to year as settlers in a new country should do. They\r\ndo not even hold their own in comparison with those around them. But\r\nhas not this always been the case with colonists out of France; and\r\nhas it not always been the case with Roman Catholics when they have\r\nbeen forced to measure themselves against Protestants? As to the\r\nultimate fate in the world of this people, one can hardly form a\r\nspeculation. There are, as nearly as I could learn, about 800,000 of\r\nthem in Lower Canada; but it seems that the wealth and commercial\r\nenterprise of the country is passing out of their hands. Montreal,\r\nand even Quebec are, I think, becoming less and less French every\r\nday; but in the villages and on the small farms the French remain,\r\nkeeping up their language, their habits, and their religion. In the\r\ncities they are becoming hewers of wood and drawers of water. I am\r\ninclined to think that the same will ultimately be their fate in\r\nthe country. Surely one may declare as a fact that a Roman Catholic\r\npopulation can never hold its ground against one that is Protestant.\r\nI do not speak of numbers, for the Roman Catholics will increase\r\nand multiply, and stick by their religion, although their religion\r\nentails poverty and dependence; as they have done and still do in\r\nIreland. But in progress and wealth the Romanists have always gone\r\nto the wall when the two have been made to compete together. And\r\nyet I love their religion. There is something beautiful and almost\r\ndivine in the faith and obedience of a true son of the Holy Mother.\r\nI sometimes fancy that I would fain be a Roman Catholic,--if I\r\ncould; as also I would often wish to be still a child, if that were\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAll this is on the way to the Falls of Montmorency. These falls are\r\nplaced exactly at the mouth of the little river of the same name, so\r\nthat it may be said absolutely to fall into the St. Lawrence. The\r\npeople of the country, however, declare that the river into which\r\nthe waters of the Montmorency fall is not the St. Lawrence, but the\r\nCharles. Without a map I do not know that I can explain this. The\r\nriver Charles appears to, and in fact does, run into the St. Lawrence\r\njust below Quebec. But the waters do not mix. The thicker, browner\r\nstream of the lesser river still keeps the north-eastern bank till\r\nit comes to the island of Orleans, which lies in the river five or\r\nsix miles below Quebec. Here or hereabouts are the Falls of the\r\nMontmorency, and then the great river is divided for twenty-five\r\nmiles by the Isle of Orleans. It is said that the waters of the\r\nCharles and the St. Lawrence do not mix till they meet each other at\r\nthe foot of this island.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I am particularly happy at describing a waterfall,\r\nand what little capacity I may have in this way I would wish to keep\r\nfor Niagara. One thing I can say very positively about Montmorency,\r\nand one piece of advice I can give to those who visit the falls.\r\nThe place from which to see them is not the horrible little wooden\r\ntemple, which has been built immediately over them on that side which\r\nlies nearest to Quebec. The stranger is put down at a gate through\r\nwhich a path leads to this temple, and at which a woman demands from\r\nhim twenty-five cents for the privilege of entrance. Let him by all\r\nmeans pay the twenty-five cents. Why should he attempt to see the\r\nfalls for nothing, seeing that this woman has a vested interest in\r\nthe showing of them? I declare that if I thought that I should hinder\r\nthis woman from her perquisites by what I write, I would leave it\r\nunwritten, and let my readers pursue their course to the temple--to\r\ntheir manifest injury. But they will pay the twenty-five cents. Then\r\nlet them cross over the bridge, eschewing the temple, and wander\r\nround on the open field till they get the view of the falls, and the\r\nview of Quebec also, from the other side. It is worth the twenty-five\r\ncents, and the hire of the carriage also. Immediately over the falls\r\nthere was a suspension bridge, of which the supporting, or rather\r\nnon-supporting, pillars are still to be seen. But the bridge fell\r\ndown one day into the river; and, alas, alas! with the bridge fell\r\ndown an old woman, and a boy, and a cart,--a cart and horse,--and\r\nall found a watery grave together in the spray. No attempt has been\r\nmade since that to renew the suspension bridge; but the present\r\nwooden bridge has been built higher up, in lieu of it.\r\n\r\nStrangers naturally visit Quebec in summer or autumn, seeing that\r\na Canada winter is a season with which a man cannot trifle; but I\r\nimagine that the mid-winter is the best time for seeing the Falls of\r\nMontmorency. The water in its fall is dashed into spray, and that\r\nspray becomes frozen, till a cone of ice is formed immediately under\r\nthe cataract, which gradually rises till the temporary glacier\r\nreaches nearly half-way to the level of the higher river. Up this men\r\nclimb,--and ladies also, I am told,--and then descend with pleasant\r\nrapidity on sledges of wood, sometimes not without an innocent\r\ntumble in the descent. As we were at Quebec in September, we did not\r\nexperience the delights of this pastime.\r\n\r\nAs I was too early for the ice cone under the Montmorency Falls, so\r\nalso was I too late to visit the Saguenay river which runs into the\r\nSt. Lawrence some hundred miles below Quebec. I presume that the\r\nscenery of the Saguenay is the finest in Canada. During the summer\r\nsteamers run down the St. Lawrence and up the Saguenay, but I was\r\ntoo late for them. An offer was made to us through the kindness of\r\nSir Edmund Head, who was then the Governor-General, of the use of a\r\nsteam-tug belonging to a gentleman who carries on a large commercial\r\nenterprise at Chicoutimi, far up the Saguenay; but an acceptance\r\nof this offer would have entailed some delay at Quebec, and as we\r\nwere anxious to get into the North Western States before the winter\r\ncommenced, we were obliged with great regret to decline the journey.\r\n\r\nI feel bound to say that a stranger regarding Quebec merely as a\r\ntown, finds very much of which he cannot but complain. The foot-paths\r\nthrough the streets are almost entirely of wood, as indeed seems\r\nto be general throughout Canada. Wood is of course the cheapest\r\nmaterial, and though it may not be altogether good for such a purpose\r\nit would not create animadversion if it were kept in tolerable order.\r\nBut in Quebec the paths are intolerably bad. They are full of holes.\r\nThe boards are rotten and worn in some places to dirt. The nails have\r\ngone, and the broken planks go up and down under the feet, and in\r\nthe dark they are absolutely dangerous. But if the paths are bad the\r\nroadways are worse. The street through the lower town along the quays\r\nis, I think, the most disgraceful thoroughfare I ever saw in any\r\ntown. I believe the whole of it, or at any rate a great portion,\r\nhas been paved with wood; but the boards have been worked into mud,\r\nand the ground under the boards has been worked into holes, till\r\nthe street is more like the bottom of a filthy ditch than a roadway\r\nthrough one of the most thickly populated parts of a city. Had Quebec\r\nin Wolfe's time been as it is now, Wolfe would have stuck in the mud\r\nbetween the river and the rock, before he reached the point which he\r\ndesired to climb. In the upper town the roads are not so bad as they\r\nare below, but still they are very bad. I was told that this arose\r\nfrom disputes among the municipal corporations. Everything in Canada\r\nrelating to roads, and a very great deal affecting the internal\r\ngovernment of the people, is done by these municipalities. It is made\r\na subject of great boast in Canada that the communal authorities\r\ndo carry on so large a part of the public business, and that they\r\ndo it generally so well, and at so cheap a rate. I have nothing to\r\nsay against this, and as a whole believe that the boast is true. I\r\nmust protest, however, that the streets of the greater cities,--for\r\nMontreal is nearly as bad as Quebec,--prove the rule by a very sad\r\nexception. The municipalities of which I speak extend, I believe, to\r\nall Canada; the two provinces being divided into counties, and the\r\ncounties subdivided into townships to which, as a matter of course,\r\nthe municipalities are attached.\r\n\r\nFrom Quebec to Montreal there are two modes of travel. There are the\r\nsteamers up the St. Lawrence which, as all the world know is, or at\r\nany rate hitherto has been, the high road of the Canadas; and there\r\nis the Grand Trunk Railway. Passengers choosing the latter go towards\r\nPortland as far as Richmond, and there join the main line of the\r\nroad, passing from Richmond on to Montreal. We learned while at\r\nQuebec that it behoved us not to leave the colony till we had seen\r\nthe lake and mountains of Memphra-Magog, and as we were clearly\r\nneglecting our duty with regard to the Saguenay, we felt bound to\r\nmake such amends as lay in our power, by deviating from our way to\r\nthe lake above named. In order to do this we were obliged to choose\r\nthe railway, and to go back beyond Richmond to the station at\r\nSherbrooke. Sherbrooke is a large village on the confines of Canada,\r\nand as it is on the railway will no doubt become a large town. It is\r\nvery prettily situated on the meeting of two rivers; it has three\r\nor four different churches, and intends to thrive. It possesses two\r\nnewspapers, of the prosperity of which I should be inclined to feel\r\nless assured. The annual subscription to such a newspaper published\r\ntwice a week is ten shillings per annum. A sale of a thousand copies\r\nis not considered bad. Such a sale would produce £500 a year, and\r\nthis would, if entirely devoted to that purpose, give a moderate\r\nincome to a gentleman qualified to conduct a newspaper. But the paper\r\nand printing must cost something, and the capital invested should\r\nreceive its proper remuneration. And then,--such at least is the\r\ngeneral idea,--the getting together of news and the framing of\r\nintelligence is a costly operation. I can only hope that all this is\r\npaid for by the advertisements, for I must trust that the editors do\r\nnot receive less than the moderate sum above named. At Sherbrooke we\r\nare still in Lower Canada. Indeed, as regards distance, we are when\r\nthere nearly as far removed from Upper Canada as at Quebec. But the\r\nrace of people here is very different. The French population had made\r\ntheir way down into these townships before the English and American\r\nwar broke out, but had not done so in great numbers. The country was\r\nthen very unapproachable, being far to the south of the St. Lawrence,\r\nand far also from any great line of internal communication towards\r\nthe Atlantic. But, nevertheless, many settlers made their way in here\r\nfrom the States; men who preferred to live under British rule, and\r\nperhaps doubted the stability of the new order of things. They or\r\ntheir children have remained here since, and as the whole country\r\nhas been opened up by the railway many others have flocked in. Thus\r\na better class of people than the French hold possession of the\r\nlarger farms, and are on the whole doing well. I am told that many\r\nAmericans are now coming here, driven over the borders from Maine,\r\nNew Hampshire, and Vermont by fears of the war and the weight of\r\ntaxation. I do not think that fears of war or the paying of taxes\r\ndrive many individuals away from home. Men who would be so influenced\r\nhave not the amount of foresight which would induce them to avoid\r\nsuch evils; or, at any rate, such fears would act slowly. Labourers,\r\nhowever, will go where work is certain, where work is well paid, and\r\nwhere the wages to be earned will give plenty in return. It may be\r\nthat work will become scarce in the States, as it has done with those\r\npoor jewellers at Attleborough, of whom we spoke, and that food will\r\nbecome dear. If this be so, labourers from the States will no doubt\r\nfind their way into Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom Sherbrooke we went with the mails on a pair-horse waggon to\r\nMagog. Cross country mails are not interesting to the generality\r\nof readers, but I have a professional liking for them myself. I\r\nhave spent the best part of my life in looking after and I hope\r\nin improving such mails, and I always endeavour to do a stroke of\r\nwork when I come across them. I learned on this occasion that the\r\nconveyance of mails with a pair of horses in Canada costs little more\r\nthan half what is paid for the same work in England with one horse,\r\nand something less than what is paid in Ireland, also for one horse.\r\nBut in Canada the average pace is only five miles an hour. In Ireland\r\nit is seven, and the time is accurately kept, which does not seem to\r\nbe the case in Canada. In England the pace is eight miles an hour.\r\nIn Canada and in Ireland these conveyances carry passengers; but in\r\nEngland they are prohibited from doing so. In Canada the vehicles\r\nare much better got up than they are in England, and the horses too\r\nlook better. Taking Ireland as a whole they are more respectable in\r\nappearance there than in England. From all which it appears that pace\r\nis the article that costs the highest price, and that appearance does\r\nnot go for much in the bill. In Canada the roads are very bad in\r\ncomparison with the English or Irish roads; but to make up for this,\r\nthe price of forage is very low.\r\n\r\nI have said that the cross mail conveyances in Canada did not seem\r\nto be very closely bound as to time; but they are regulated by\r\nclock-work in comparison with some of them in the United States.\r\n\"Are you going this morning?\" I said to a mail-driver in Vermont. \"I\r\nthought you always started in the evening.\" \"Wa'll; I guess I do. But\r\nit rained some last night, so I jist stayed at home.\" I do not know\r\nthat I ever felt more shocked in my life, and I could hardly keep my\r\ntongue off the man. The mails, however, would have paid no respect to\r\nme in Vermont, and I was obliged to walk away crestfallen.\r\n\r\nWe went with the mails from Sherbrooke to a village called Magog at\r\nthe outlet of the lake, and from thence by a steamer up the lake to a\r\nsolitary hotel called the Mountain House, which is built at the foot\r\nof the mountain on the shore, and which is surrounded on every side\r\nby thick forest. There is no road within two miles of the house. The\r\nlake therefore is the only highway, and that is frozen up for four\r\nmonths in the year. When frozen, however, it is still a road, for it\r\nis passable for sledges. I have seldom been in a house that seemed\r\nso remote from the world, and so little within reach of doctors,\r\nparsons, or butchers. Bakers in this country are not required, as all\r\npersons make their own bread. But in spite of its position the hotel\r\nis well kept, and on the whole we were more comfortable there than at\r\nany other inn in Lower Canada. The Mountain House is but five miles\r\nfrom the borders of Vermont, in which State the head of the lake\r\nlies. The steamer which brought us runs on to Newport,--or rather\r\nfrom Newport to Magog and back again. And Newport is in Vermont.\r\n\r\nThe one thing to be done at the Mountain House is the ascent of the\r\nmountain called the Owl's Head. The world there offers nothing else\r\nof active enterprise to the traveller, unless fishing be considered\r\nan active enterprise. I am not capable of fishing, therefore we\r\nresolved on going up the Owl's Head. To dine in the middle of the day\r\nis absolutely imperative at these hotels, and thus we were driven\r\nto select either the morning or the afternoon. Evening lights we\r\ndeclared were the best for all views, and therefore we decided on the\r\nafternoon. It is but two miles; but then, as we were told more than\r\nonce by those who had spoken to us on the subject, those two miles\r\nare not like other miles. \"I doubt if the lady can do it,\" one man\r\nsaid to me. I asked if ladies did not sometimes go up. \"Yes; young\r\nwomen do, at times,\" he said. After that my wife resolved that she\r\nwould see the top of the Owl's Head, or die in the attempt, and so\r\nwe started. They never think of sending a guide with one in these\r\nplaces, whereas in Europe a traveller is not allowed to go a step\r\nwithout one. When I asked for one to show us the way up Mount\r\nWashington, I was told that there were no idle boys about that place.\r\nThe path was indicated to us, and off we started with high hopes.\r\n\r\nI have been up many mountains, and have climbed some that were\r\nperhaps somewhat dangerous in their ascent. In climbing the Owl's\r\nHead there is no danger. One is closed in by thick trees the whole\r\nway. But I doubt if I ever went up a steeper ascent. It was very hard\r\nwork, but we were not beaten. We reached the top, and there sitting\r\ndown thoroughly enjoyed our victory. It was then half-past five\r\no'clock, and the sun was not yet absolutely sinking. It did not seem\r\nto give us any warning that we should especially require its aid,\r\nand as the prospect below us was very lovely we remained there for\r\na quarter of an hour. The ascent of the Owl's Head is certainly a\r\nthing to do, and I still think, in spite of our following misfortune,\r\nthat it is a thing to do late in the afternoon. The view down upon\r\nthe lakes and the forests around, and on the wooded hills below, is\r\nwonderfully lovely. I never was on a mountain which gave me a more\r\nperfect command of all the country round. But as we arose to descend\r\nwe saw a little cloud coming towards us from over Newport.\r\n\r\nThe little cloud came on with speed, and we had hardly freed\r\nourselves from the rocks of the summit before we were surrounded by\r\nrain. As the rain became thicker, we were surrounded by darkness\r\nalso, or if not by darkness by so dim a light that it became a task\r\nto find our path. I still thought that the daylight had not gone, and\r\nthat as we descended and so escaped from the cloud we should find\r\nlight enough to guide us. But it was not so. The rain soon became a\r\nmatter of indifference, and so also did the mud and briars beneath\r\nour feet. Even the steepness of the way was almost forgotten as we\r\nendeavoured to thread our path through the forest before it should\r\nbecome impossible to discern the track. A dog had followed us up, and\r\nthough the beast would not stay with us so as to be our guide, he\r\nreturned ever and anon and made us aware of his presence by dashing\r\nby us. I may confess now that I became much frightened. We were wet\r\nthrough, and a night out in the forest would have been unpleasant to\r\nus. At last I did utterly lose the track. It had become quite dark,\r\nso dark that we could hardly see each other. We had succeeded in\r\ngetting down the steepest and worst part of the mountain, but we were\r\nstill among dense forest-trees, and up to our knees in mud. But the\r\npeople at the Mountain House were Christians, and men with lanterns\r\nwere sent hallooing after us through the dark night. When we were\r\nthus found we were not many yards from the path, but unfortunately on\r\nthe wrong side of a stream. Through that we waded and then made our\r\nway in safety to the inn. In spite of which misadventure I advise all\r\ntravellers in Lower Canada to go up the Owl's Head.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we crossed the lake to Georgeville, and drove\r\nround another lake called the Massawhippi back to Sherbrooke. This\r\nwas all very well, for it showed us a part of the country which\r\nis comparatively well tilled, and has been long settled; but the\r\nMassawhippi itself is not worth a visit. The route by which we\r\nreturned occupies a longer time than the other, and is more costly\r\nas it must be made in a hired vehicle. The people here are quiet,\r\norderly, and I should say a little slow. It is manifest that a strong\r\nfeeling against the Northern States has lately sprung up. This is\r\nmuch to be deprecated, but I cannot but say that it is natural. It is\r\nnot that the Canadians have any special Secession feelings, or that\r\nthey have entered with peculiar warmth into the questions of American\r\npolitics; but they have been vexed and acerbated by the braggadocio\r\nof the Northern States. They constantly hear that they are to be\r\ninvaded, and translated into citizens of the Union: that British rule\r\nis to be swept off the Continent, and that the star-spangled banner\r\nis to be waved over them in pity. The star-spangled banner is in fact\r\na fine flag, and has waved to some purpose; but those who live near\r\nit, and not under it, fancy that they hear too much of it. At the\r\npresent moment the loyalty of both the Canadas to Great Britain\r\nis beyond all question. From all that I can hear I doubt whether\r\nthis feeling in the Provinces was ever so strong, and under such\r\ncircumstances American abuse of England and American braggadocio\r\nis more than usually distasteful. All this abuse and all this\r\nbraggadocio comes to Canada from the Northern States, and therefore\r\nthe Southern cause is at the present moment the more popular with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI have said that the Canadians hereabouts are somewhat slow. As we\r\nwere driving back to Sherbrooke it became necessary that we should\r\nrest for an hour or so in the middle of the day, and for this purpose\r\nwe stopped at a village inn. It was a large house, in which there\r\nappeared to be three public sitting-rooms of ample size, one of which\r\nwas occupied as the bar. In this there were congregated some six or\r\nseven men, seated in arm-chairs round a stove, and among these I\r\nplaced myself. No one spoke a word either to me or to any one else.\r\nNo one smoked, and no one read, nor did they even whittle sticks. I\r\nasked a question first of one and then of another, and was answered\r\nwith monosyllables. So I gave up any hope in that direction, and sat\r\nstaring at the big stove in the middle of the room, as the others\r\ndid. Presently another stranger entered, having arrived in a waggon\r\nas I had done. He entered the room and sat down, addressing no one,\r\nand addressed by no one. After a while, however, he spoke. \"Will\r\nthere be any chance of dinner here?\" he said. \"I guess there'll be\r\ndinner by-and-by,\" answered the landlord, and then there was silence\r\nfor another ten minutes, during which the stranger stared at the\r\nstove. \"Is that dinner any way ready?\" he asked again. \"I guess it\r\nis,\" said the landlord. And then the stranger went out to see after\r\nhis dinner himself. When we started at the end of an hour nobody said\r\nanything to us. The driver \"hitched\" on the horses, as they call\r\nit, and we started on our way, having been charged nothing for our\r\naccommodation. That some profit arose from the horse provender is to\r\nbe hoped.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we reached Montreal, which, as I have said\r\nbefore, is the commercial capital of the two Provinces. This question\r\nof the capitals is at the present moment a subject of great interest\r\nin Canada, but as I shall be driven to say something on the matter\r\nwhen I report myself as being at Ottawa, I will refrain now. There\r\nare two special public affairs at the present moment to interest a\r\ntraveller in Canada. The first I have named, and the second is the\r\nGrand Trunk Railway. I have already stated what is the course of this\r\nline. It runs from the Western State of Michigan to Portland on the\r\nAtlantic in the State of Maine, sweeping the whole length of Canada\r\nin its route. It was originally made by three Companies. The Atlantic\r\nand St. Lawrence constructed it from Portland to Island Pond on the\r\nborders of the States. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic took it from the\r\nSouth Eastern side of the river at Montreal to the same point, viz.,\r\nIsland Pond. And the Grand Trunk Company have made it from Detroit to\r\nMontreal, crossing the river there with a stupendous tubular bridge,\r\nand have also made the branch connecting the main line with Quebec\r\nand Rivière du Loup. This latter company is now incorporated with the\r\nSt. Lawrence and Atlantic, but has only leased the portion of the\r\nline running through the States. This they have done, guaranteeing\r\nthe shareholders an interest of six per cent. There never was a\r\ngrander enterprise set on foot. I will not say there never was one\r\nmore unfortunate, for is there not the Great Eastern, which by the\r\nweight and constancy of its failures demands for itself a proud\r\npre-eminence of misfortune? But surely the Grand Trunk comes next\r\nto it. I presume it to be quite out of the question that the\r\nshareholders should get any interest whatever on their shares for\r\nyears. The company when I was at Montreal had not paid the interest\r\ndue to the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Company for the last year, and\r\nthere was a doubt whether the lease would not be broken. No party\r\nthat had advanced money to the undertaking was able to recover what\r\nhad been advanced. I believe that one firm in London had lent nearly\r\na million to the Company and is now willing to accept half the sum so\r\nlent in quittance of the whole debt. In 1860 the line could not carry\r\nthe freight that offered, not having or being able to obtain the\r\nnecessary rolling stock; and on all sides I heard men discussing\r\nwhether the line would be kept open for traffic. The Government of\r\nCanada advanced to the Company three millions of money, with an\r\nunderstanding that neither interest nor principal should be demanded\r\ntill all other debts were paid, and all shareholders in receipt of\r\nsix per cent. interest. But the three millions were clogged with\r\nconditions which, though they have been of service to the country,\r\nhave been so expensive to the Company that it is hardly more solvent\r\nwith it than it would have been without it. As it is, the whole\r\nproperty seems to be involved in ruin; and yet the line is one of the\r\ngrandest commercial conceptions that was ever carried out on the face\r\nof the globe, and in the process of a few years will do more to make\r\nbread cheap in England than any other single enterprise that exists.\r\n\r\nI do not know that blame is to be attached to any one. I at least\r\nattach no such blame. Probably it might be easy now to show that the\r\nroad might have been made with sufficient accommodation for ordinary\r\npurposes without some of the more costly details. The great tubular\r\nbridge on which was expended £1,300,000 might, I should think, have\r\nbeen dispensed with. The Detroit end of the line might have been\r\nleft for later time. As it stands now, however, it is a wonderful\r\noperation carried to a successful issue as far as the public are\r\nconcerned, and one can only grieve that it should be so absolute a\r\nfailure to those who have placed their money in it. There are schemes\r\nwhich seem to be too big for men to work out with any ordinary regard\r\nto profit and loss. The Great Eastern is one, and this is another.\r\nThe national advantage arising from such enterprises is immense; but\r\nthe wonder is that men should be found willing to embark their money\r\nwhere the risk is so great, and the return even hoped for is so\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Canada some gentlemen were there from the Lower\r\nProvinces--Nova Scotia, that is, and New Brunswick--agitating the\r\nsubject of another great line of railway from Quebec to Halifax.\r\nThe project is one in favour of which very much may be said. In a\r\nnational point of view an Englishman or a Canadian cannot but regret\r\nthat there should be no winter mode of exit from, or entrance to,\r\nCanada, except through the United States. The St. Lawrence is blocked\r\nup for four or five months in winter, and the steamers which run\r\nto Quebec in the summer run to Portland during the season of ice.\r\nThere is at present no mode of public conveyance between the Canadas\r\nand the Lower Provinces, and an immense district of country on the\r\nborders of Lower Canada, through New Brunswick and into Nova Scotia\r\nis now absolutely closed against civilization, which by such a\r\nrailway would be opened up to the light of day. We all know how much\r\nthe want of such a road was felt when our troops were being forwarded\r\nto Canada during the last winter. It was necessary they should reach\r\ntheir destination without delay; and as the river was closed, and\r\nthe passing of troops through the States was of course out of the\r\nquestion, that long overland journey across Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick became a necessity. It would certainly be a very great\r\nthing for British interests if a direct line could be made from such\r\na port as Halifax, a port which is open throughout the whole year,\r\nup into the Canadas. If these Colonies belonged to France or to any\r\nother despotic Government, the thing would be done. But the Colonies\r\ndo not belong to any despotic Government.\r\n\r\nSuch a line would in fact be a continuance of the Grand Trunk; and\r\nwho that looks at the present state of the finances of the Grand\r\nTrunk can think it to be on the cards that private enterprise should\r\ncome forward with more money,--with more millions? The idea is that\r\nEngland will advance the money, and that the English House of Commons\r\nwill guarantee the interest, with some counter-guarantee from the\r\nColonies that this interest shall be duly paid. But it would seem\r\nthat if such Colonial guarantee is to go for anything, the Colonies\r\nmight raise the money in the money market without the intervention of\r\nthe British House of Commons.\r\n\r\nMontreal is an exceedingly good commercial town, and business there\r\nis brisk. It has now 85,000 inhabitants. Having said that of it, I do\r\nnot know what more there is left to say. Yes; one word there is to\r\nsay of Sir William Logan the creator of the Geological Museum there\r\nand the head of all matters geological throughout the Province.\r\nWhile he was explaining to me with admirable perspicuity the result\r\nof investigations into which he had poured his whole heart, I stood\r\nby understanding almost nothing, but envying everything. That I\r\nunderstood almost nothing, I know he perceived. That, ever and anon,\r\nwith all his graciousness became apparent. But I wonder whether\r\nhe perceived also that I did envy everything. I have listened to\r\ngeologists by the hour before--have had to listen to them, desirous\r\nsimply of escape. I have listened and understood absolutely nothing,\r\nand have only wished myself away. But I could have listened to Sir\r\nWilliam Logan for the whole day, if time allowed. I found even in\r\nthat hour that some ideas found their way through to me, and I began\r\nto fancy that even I could become a geologist at Montreal.\r\n\r\nOver and beyond Sir William Logan there is at Montreal for strangers\r\nthe drive round the mountain, not very exciting; and there is the\r\ntubular bridge over the St. Lawrence. This, it must be understood,\r\nis not made in one tube, as is that over the Menai Straits, but is\r\ndivided into, I think, thirteen tubes. To the eye there appear to be\r\ntwenty-five tubes; but each of the six side tubes is supported by a\r\npier in the middle. A great part of the expense of the bridge was\r\nincurred in sinking the shafts for these piers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nUPPER CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOttawa is in Upper Canada, but crossing the suspension bridge from\r\nOttawa into Hull the traveller is in Lower Canada. It is therefore\r\nexactly in the confines, and has been chosen as the site of the new\r\nGovernment capital very much for this reason. Other reasons have,\r\nno doubt, had a share in the decision. At the time when the choice\r\nwas made Ottawa was not large enough to create the jealousy of the\r\nmore populous towns. Though not on the main line of railway, it was\r\nconnected with it by a branch railway, and it is also connected with\r\nthe St. Lawrence by water communication. And then it stands nobly\r\non a magnificent river, with high overhanging rock, and a natural\r\ngrandeur of position which has perhaps gone far in recommending it to\r\nthose whose voice in the matter has been potential. Having the world\r\nof Canada from whence to choose the site of a new town, the choosers\r\nhave certainly chosen well. It is another question whether or no a\r\nnew town should have been deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be well to explain the circumstances under which it\r\nwas thought expedient thus to establish a new Canadian capital. In\r\n1841 when Lord Sydenham was Governor General of the Provinces, the\r\ntwo Canadas, separate till then, were united under one Government.\r\nAt that time the people of Lower or French Canada, and the people\r\nof Upper or English Canada differed much more in their habits and\r\nlanguage than they do now. I do not know that the English have become\r\nin any way Gallicized, but the French have been very materially\r\nAnglicized. But while this has been in progress, national jealousy\r\nhas been at work; and even yet that national jealousy is not at an\r\nend. While the two provinces were divided, there were, of course,\r\ntwo capitals, and two seats of Government. These were at Quebec for\r\nLower Canada, and at Toronto for Upper Canada, both which towns are\r\ncentrically situated as regards the respective provinces. When the\r\nunion was effected, it was deemed expedient that there should be but\r\none capital; and the small town of Kingstown was selected, which is\r\nsituated on the lower end of Lake Ontario in the Upper Province.\r\nBut Kingstown was found to be inconvenient, lacking space and\r\naccommodation for those who had to follow the Government, and the\r\nGovernor removed it and himself to Montreal. Montreal is in the\r\nLower Province, but is very central to both the provinces; and it is,\r\nmoreover, the chief town in Canada. This would have done very well,\r\nbut for an unforeseen misfortune.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered by most readers that in 1837 took place the\r\nMackenzie-Papineau rebellion, of which those who were then old enough\r\nto be politicians heard so much in England. I am not going back to\r\nrecount the history of the period, otherwise than to say that the\r\nEnglish Canadians at that time, in withstanding and combating the\r\nrebels, did considerable injury to the property of certain French\r\nCanadians, and that when the rebellion had blown over and those\r\nin fault had been pardoned, a question arose whether or no the\r\nGovernment should make good the losses of those French Canadians who\r\nhad been injured. The English Canadians protested that it would be\r\nmonstrous that they should be taxed to repair damages suffered by\r\nrebels, and made necessary in the suppression of rebellion. The\r\nFrench Canadians declared that the rebellion had been only a just\r\nassertion of their rights, that if there had been crime on the part\r\nof those who took up arms that crime had been condoned, and that the\r\ndamages had not fallen exclusively or even chiefly on those who had\r\ndone so. I will give no opinion on the merits of the question, but\r\nsimply say that blood ran very hot when it was discussed. At last\r\nthe Houses of the Provincial Parliament, then assembled at Montreal,\r\ndecreed that the losses should be made good by the public treasury;\r\nand the English mob in Montreal, when this decree became known, was\r\nroused to great wrath by a decision which seemed to be condemnatory\r\nof English loyalty. It pelted Lord Elgin, the Governor General, with\r\nrotten eggs, and burned down the Parliament House. Hence, there\r\narose, not unnaturally, a strong feeling of anger on the part of the\r\nlocal Government against Montreal; and moreover there was no longer a\r\nHouse in which the Parliament could be held in that town. For these\r\nconjoint reasons it was decided to move the seat of Government again,\r\nand it was resolved that the Governor and the Parliament should\r\nsit alternately at Toronto in Upper Canada, and at Quebec in Lower\r\nCanada, remaining four years at each place. They went at first to\r\nToronto for two years only, having agreed that they should be there\r\non this occasion only for the remainder of the term of the then\r\nParliament. After that they were at Quebec for four years; then at\r\nToronto for four; and now are again at Quebec. But this arrangement\r\nhas been found very inconvenient. In the first place there is a great\r\nnational expenditure incurred in moving old records, and in keeping\r\ndouble records, in moving the library, and as I have been informed\r\neven the pictures. The Government clerks also are called on to\r\nmove as the Government moves; and though an allowance is made to\r\nthem from the national purse to cover their loss, the arrangement\r\nhas nevertheless been felt by them to be a grievance, as may be\r\nwell understood. The accommodation also for the ministers of the\r\nGovernment, and for members of the two Houses has been insufficient.\r\nHotels, lodgings, and furnished houses could not be provided to the\r\nextent required, seeing that they would be left nearly empty for\r\nevery alternate space of four years. Indeed it needs but little\r\nargument to prove that the plan adopted must have been a thoroughly\r\nuncomfortable plan, and the wonder is that it should have been\r\nadopted. Lower Canada had undertaken to make all her leading citizens\r\nwretched, providing Upper Canada would treat hers with equal\r\nseverity. This has now gone on for some twelve years, and as the\r\nsystem was found to be an unendurable nuisance it has been at last\r\nadmitted that some steps must be taken towards selecting one capital\r\nfor the country.\r\n\r\nI should here, in justice to the Canadians, state a remark made to\r\nme on this matter by one of the present leading politicians of the\r\ncolony. I cannot think that the migratory scheme was good; but he\r\ndefended it, asserting that it had done very much to amalgamate the\r\npeople of the two provinces; that it had brought Lower Canadians into\r\nUpper Canada, and Upper Canadians into Lower Canada, teaching English\r\nto those who spoke only French before, and making each pleasantly\r\nacquainted with the other. I have no doubt that something,--perhaps\r\nmuch,--has been done in this way; but valuable as the result may have\r\nbeen, I cannot think it worth the cost of the means employed. The\r\nbest answer to the above argument consists in the undoubted fact that\r\na migratory Government would never have been established for such\r\na reason. It was so established because Montreal, the central town,\r\nhad given offence, and because the jealousy of the provinces against\r\neach other would not admit of the Government being placed entirely at\r\nQuebec, or entirely at Toronto.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary that some step should be taken; and as it was\r\nfound to be unlikely that any resolution should be reached by the\r\njoint provinces themselves, it was loyally and wisely determined to\r\nrefer the matter to the Queen. That Her Majesty has constitutionally\r\nthe power to call the Parliament of Canada at any town of Canada\r\nwhich she may select, admits, I conceive, of no doubt. It is, I\r\nimagine, within her prerogative to call the Parliament of England\r\nwhere she may please within that realm, though her lieges would be\r\nsomewhat startled if it were called otherwhere than in London. It\r\nwas therefore well done to ask Her Majesty to act as arbiter in\r\nthe matter. But there are not wanting those in Canada who say that\r\nin referring the matter to the Queen it was in truth referring it\r\nto those by whom very many of the Canadians were least willing to\r\nbe guided in the matter; to the Governor General namely, and the\r\nColonial Secretary. Many indeed in Canada now declare that the\r\ndecision simply placed the matter in the hands of the Governor\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, I do not think that any unbiassed traveller will\r\ndoubt that the best possible selection has been made, presuming\r\nalways, as we may presume in the discussion, that Montreal could\r\nnot be selected. I take for granted that the rejection of Montreal\r\nwas regarded as a _sine quâ non_ in the decision. To me it appears\r\ngrievous that this should have been so. It is a great thing for any\r\ncountry to have a large, leading, world-known city, and I think that\r\nthe Government should combine with the commerce of the country in\r\ncarrying out this object. But commerce can do a great deal more\r\nfor Government than Government can do for commerce. Government has\r\nselected Ottawa as the capital of Canada; but commerce has already\r\nmade Montreal the capital, and Montreal will be the chief city of\r\nCanada, let Government do what it may to foster the other town. The\r\nidea of spiting a town because there has been a row in it seems to\r\nme to be preposterous. The row was not the work of those who have\r\nmade Montreal rich and respectable. Montreal is more centrical than\r\nOttawa,--nay, it is as nearly centrical as any town can be. It is\r\neasier to get to Montreal from Toronto than to Ottawa;--and if from\r\nToronto, then from all that distant portion of Upper Canada, back of\r\nToronto. To all Lower Canada Montreal is, as a matter of course, much\r\neasier of access than Ottawa. But having said so much in favour of\r\nMontreal, I will again admit that, putting aside Montreal, the best\r\npossible selection has been made.\r\n\r\nWhen Ottawa was named, no time was lost in setting to work to prepare\r\nfor the new migration. In 1859 the Parliament was removed to Quebec,\r\nwith the understanding that it should remain there till the new\r\nbuildings should be completed. These buildings were absolutely\r\ncommenced in April 1860, and it was, and I believe still is, expected\r\nthat they will be completed in 1863. I am now writing in the winter\r\nof 1861; and, as is necessary in Canadian winters, the works are\r\nsuspended. But unfortunately they were suspended in the early part\r\nof October,--on the 1st of October,--whereas they might have been\r\ncontinued, as far as the season is concerned, up to the end of\r\nNovember. We reached Ottawa on the 3rd of October, and more than a\r\nthousand men had then been just dismissed. All the money in hand\r\nhad been expended, and the Government,--so it was said,--could give\r\nno more money till Parliament should meet again. This was most\r\nunfortunate. In the first place the suspension was against the\r\ncontract as made with the contractors for the building; in the next\r\nplace there was the delay; and then, worst of all, the question again\r\nbecame agitated whether the colonial legislature were really in\r\nearnest with reference to Ottawa. Many men of mark in the colony were\r\nstill anxious--I believe are still anxious,--to put an end to the\r\nOttawa scheme, and think that there still exists for them a chance\r\nof success. And very many men who are not of mark are thus united,\r\nand a feeling of doubt on the subject has been created. £225,000 has\r\nalready been spent on these buildings, and I have no doubt myself\r\nthat they will be duly completed, and duly used.\r\n\r\nWe went up to the new town by boat, taking the course of the river\r\nOttawa. We passed St. Ann's, but no one at St. Ann's seemed to know\r\nanything of the brothers who were to rest there on their weary oars.\r\nAt Maxwellstown I could hear nothing of Annie Laurie or of her\r\ntrysting place on the braes, and the turnpike man at Tara could\r\ntell me nothing of the site of the hall, and had never even heard\r\nof the harp. When I go down South I shall expect to find that the\r\nnegro melodies have not yet reached \"Old Virginie.\" This boat\r\nconveyance from Montreal to Ottawa is not all that could be wished\r\nin convenience, for it is allied too closely with railway travelling.\r\nThose who use it leave Montreal by a railway; after nine miles, they\r\nare changed into a steamboat. Then they encounter another railway,\r\nand at last reach Ottawa in a second steamboat. But the river is\r\nseen, and a better idea of the country is obtained than can be had\r\nsolely from the railway cars. The scenery is by no means grand, nor\r\nis it strikingly picturesque; but it is in its way interesting. For a\r\nlong portion of the river the old primeval forests come down close to\r\nthe water's edge, and in the fall of the year the brilliant colouring\r\nis very lovely. It should not be imagined,--as I think it often is\r\nimagined,--that these forests are made up of splendid trees, or\r\nthat splendid trees are even common. When timber grows on undrained\r\nground, and when it is uncared for, it does not seem to approach\r\nnearer to its perfection than wheat and grass do under similar\r\ncircumstances. Seen from a little distance the colour and effect is\r\ngood, but the trees themselves have shallow roots and grow up tall,\r\nnarrow, and shapeless. It necessarily is so with all timber that is\r\nnot thinned in its growth. When fine forest trees are found, and are\r\nleft standing alone by any cultivator who may have taste enough to\r\nwish for such adornment, they almost invariably die. They are robbed\r\nof the sickly shelter by which they have been surrounded; the hot\r\nsun strikes the uncovered fibres of the roots, and the poor solitary\r\ninvalid languishes and at last dies.\r\n\r\nAs one ascends the river, which by its breadth forms itself into\r\nlakes, one is shown Indian villages clustering down upon the bank.\r\nSome years ago these Indians were rich, for the price of furs, in\r\nwhich they dealt, was high; but furs have become cheaper, and the\r\nbeavers with which they used to trade are almost valueless. That a\r\nchange in the fashion of hats should have assisted to polish these\r\npoor fellows off the face of creation must, one may suppose, be very\r\nunintelligible to them; but nevertheless it is probably a subject of\r\ndeep speculation. If the reading world were to take to sermons again\r\nand eschew their novels, Messrs. Thackeray, Dickens, and some others\r\nwould look about them and inquire into the causes of such a change\r\nwith considerable acuteness. They might not, perhaps, hit the truth,\r\nand these Indians are much in that predicament. It is said that very\r\nfew pure-blooded Indians are now to be found in their villages, but I\r\ndoubt whether this is not erroneous. The children of the Indians are\r\nnow fed upon baked bread, and on cooked meat, and are brought up in\r\nhouses. They are nursed somewhat as the children of the white men are\r\nnursed; and these practices no doubt have done much towards altering\r\ntheir appearance. The negroes who have been bred in the States, and\r\nwhose fathers have been so bred before them, differ both in colour\r\nand form from their brothers who have been born and nurtured in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nI said in the last chapter that the city of Ottawa was still to be\r\nbuilt; but I must explain, lest I should draw down on my head the\r\nwrath of the Ottawaites, that the place already contains a population\r\nof 15,000 inhabitants. As, however, it is being prepared for four\r\ntimes that number--for eight times that number let us hope--and as it\r\nstraggles over a vast extent of ground, it gives one the idea of a\r\ncity in an active course of preparation. In England we know nothing\r\nabout unbuilt cities. With us four or five blocks of streets together\r\nnever assume that ugly, unfledged appearance which belongs to the\r\nhalf-finished carcase of a house, as they do so often on the other\r\nside of the Atlantic. Ottawa is preparing for itself broad streets,\r\nand grand thoroughfares. The buildings already extend over a length\r\nconsiderably exceeding two miles, and half a dozen hotels have been\r\nopened, which, if I were writing a guide-book in a complimentary\r\ntone, it would be my duty to describe as first-rate. But the\r\nhalf-dozen first-rate hotels, though open, as yet enjoy but a\r\nmoderate amount of custom. All this justifies me, I think, in saying\r\nthat the city has as yet to get itself built. The manner in which\r\nthis is being done justifies me also in saying that the Ottawaites\r\nare going about their task with a worthy zeal.\r\n\r\nTo me I confess that the nature of the situation has great\r\ncharms,--regarding it as the site for a town. It is not on a plain,\r\nand from the form of the rock overhanging the river, and of the\r\nhill that falls from thence down to the water, it has been found\r\nimpracticable to lay out the place in right-angled parallelograms. A\r\nright-angled parallelogramical city, such as are Philadelphia and the\r\nnew portion of New York, is from its very nature odious to me. I know\r\nthat much may be said in its favour--that drainage and gas-pipes come\r\neasier to such a shape, and that ground can be better economized.\r\nNevertheless I prefer a street that is forced to twist itself about.\r\nI enjoy the narrowness of Temple Bar, and the misshapen curvature\r\nof Pickett Street. The disreputable dinginess of Holywell Street is\r\ndear to me, and I love to thread my way up by the Olympic into Covent\r\nGarden. Fifth Avenue in New York is as grand as paint and glass can\r\nmake it; but I would not live in a palace in Fifth Avenue if the\r\ncorporation of the city would pay my baker's and butcher's bills.\r\n\r\nThe town of Ottawa lies between two waterfalls. The upper one, or\r\nRideau Fall, is formed by the confluence of a small river with the\r\nlarger one; and the lower fall--designated as lower because it is at\r\nthe foot of the hill, though it is higher up the Ottawa river--is\r\ncalled the Chaudière, from its resemblance to a boiling kettle.\r\nThis is on the Ottawa river itself. The Rideau fall is divided into\r\ntwo branches, thus forming an island in the middle as is the case\r\nat Niagara. It is pretty enough, and worth visiting, even were it\r\nfurther from the town than it is; but by those who have hunted out\r\nmany cataracts in their travels it will not be considered very\r\nremarkable. The Chaudière fall I did think very remarkable. It is of\r\ntrifling depth, being formed by fractures in the rocky bed of the\r\nriver; but the waters have so cut the rock as to create beautiful\r\nforms in the rush which they make in their descent. Strangers are\r\ntold to look at these falls from the suspension bridge; and it\r\nis well that they should do so. But in so looking at them they\r\nobtain but a very small part of their effect. On the Ottawa side\r\nof the bridge is a brewery, which brewery is surrounded by a\r\nhuge timber-yard. This timber-yard I found to be very muddy, and\r\nthe passing and repassing through it is a work of trouble; but\r\nnevertheless let the traveller by all means make his way through the\r\nmud, and scramble over the timber, and cross the plank bridges which\r\ntraverse the streams of the sawmills, and thus take himself to the\r\nouter edge of the woodwork over the water. If he will then seat\r\nhimself, about the hour of sunset, he will see the Chaudière fall\r\naright.\r\n\r\nBut the glory of Ottawa will be--and, indeed, already is--the set of\r\npublic buildings which is now being erected on the rock which guards\r\nas it were the town from the river. How much of the excellence of\r\nthese buildings may be due to the taste of Sir Edmund Head, the late\r\nGovernor, I do not know. That he has greatly interested himself\r\nin the subject is well known: and as the style of the different\r\nbuildings is so much alike as to make one whole, though the designs\r\nof different architects were selected, and these different architects\r\nemployed, I imagine that considerable alterations must have been made\r\nin the original drawings. There are three buildings, forming three\r\nsides of a quadrangle; but they are not joined, the vacant spaces\r\nat the corner being of considerable extent. The fourth side of the\r\nquadrangle opens upon one of the principal streets of the town. The\r\ncentre building is intended for the Houses of Parliament, and the\r\ntwo side buildings for the Government offices. Of the first Messrs.\r\nFuller and Jones are the architects, and of the latter Messrs. Stent\r\nand Laver. I did not have the pleasure of meeting any of these\r\ngentlemen; but I take upon myself to say that as regards purity of\r\nart and manliness of conception their joint work is entitled to the\r\nvery highest praise. How far the buildings may be well arranged\r\nfor the required purposes, how far they may be economical in\r\nconstruction, or specially adapted to the severe climate of the\r\ncountry, I cannot say; but I have no hesitation in risking my\r\nreputation for judgment in giving my warmest commendation to them as\r\nregards beauty of outline and truthful nobility of detail.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe them, for I should interest no one in\r\ndoing so, and should certainly fail in my attempt to make any reader\r\nunderstand me. I know no modern Gothic purer of its kind, or less\r\nsullied with fictitious ornamentation. Our own Houses of Parliament\r\nare very fine, but it is, I believe, generally felt that the\r\nornamentation is too minute; and, moreover, it may be questioned\r\nwhether perpendicular Gothic is capable of the highest nobility which\r\narchitecture can achieve. I do not pretend to say that these Canadian\r\npublic buildings will reach that highest nobility. They must be\r\nfinished before any final judgment can be pronounced; but I do feel\r\nvery certain that that final judgment will be greatly in their\r\nfavour. The total frontage of the quadrangle, including the side\r\nbuildings, is 1,200 feet; that of the centre buildings is 475. As\r\nI have said before, £225,000 has already been expended, and it\r\nis estimated that the total cost, including the arrangement and\r\ndecoration of the ground behind the building and in the quadrangle,\r\nwill be half a million.\r\n\r\nThe buildings front upon what will, I suppose, be the principal\r\nstreet of Ottawa, and they stand upon a rock looking immediately down\r\nupon the river. In this way they are blessed with a site peculiarly\r\nhappy. Indeed I cannot at this moment remember any so much so. The\r\ncastle of Edinburgh stands very well; but then, like many other\r\ncastles, it stands on a summit by itself, and can only be approached\r\nby a steep ascent. These buildings at Ottawa, though they look down\r\nfrom a grand eminence immediately on the river, are approached\r\nfrom the town without any ascent. The rock, though it falls\r\nalmost precipitously down to the water, is covered with trees and\r\nshrubs, and then the river that runs beneath is rapid, bright, and\r\npicturesque in the irregularity of all its lines. The view from the\r\nback of the library, up to the Chaudière falls, and to the saw-mills\r\nby which they are surrounded, is very lovely. So that I will say\r\nagain, that I know no site for such a set of buildings so happy as\r\nregards both beauty and grandeur. It is intended that the library, of\r\nwhich the walls were only ten feet above the ground when I was there,\r\nshall be an octagonal building, in shape and outward character like\r\nthe chapter-house of a cathedral. This structure will, I presume, be\r\nsurrounded by gravel walks and green sward. Of the library there is a\r\nlarge model showing all the details of the architecture; and if that\r\nmodel be ultimately followed, this building alone will be worthy of a\r\nvisit from English tourists. To me it was very wonderful to find such\r\nan edifice in the course of erection on the banks of a wild river,\r\nalmost at the back of Canada. But if ever I visit Canada again it\r\nwill be to see those buildings when completed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, like all friendly critics, having bestowed my modicum of\r\npraise, I must proceed to find fault. I cannot bring myself to\r\nadminister my sugar-plum without adding to it some bitter morsel by\r\nway of antidote. The building to the left of the quadrangle as it is\r\nentered is deficient in length, and on that account appears mean to\r\nthe eye. The two side buildings are brought up close to the street,\r\nso that each has a frontage immediately on the street. Such being the\r\ncase they should be of equal length, or nearly so. Had the centre of\r\none fronted the centre of the other, a difference of length might\r\nhave been allowed; but in this case the side front of the smaller\r\none would not have reached the street. As it is, the space between\r\nthe main building and the smaller wing is disproportionably large,\r\nand the very distance at which it stands will, I fear, give to\r\nit that appearance of meanness of which I have spoken. The clerk\r\nof the works, who explained to me with much courtesy the plan of\r\nthe buildings, stated that the design of this wing was capable of\r\nelongation, and had been expressly prepared with that object. If this\r\nbe so, I trust that the defect will be remedied.\r\n\r\nThe great trade of Canada is lumbering; and lumbering consists in\r\ncutting down pine trees up in the far distant forests, in hewing or\r\nsawing them into shape for market, and getting them down the rivers\r\nto Quebec, from whence they are exported to Europe, and chiefly\r\nto England. Timber in Canada is called lumber; those engaged in\r\nthe trade are called lumberers, and the business itself is called\r\nlumbering. After a lapse of time it must no doubt become monotonous\r\nto those engaged in it, and the name is not engaging; but there is\r\nmuch about it that is very picturesque. A saw-mill worked by water\r\npower is almost always a pretty object, and stacks of new cut timber\r\nare pleasant to the smell, and group themselves not amiss on the\r\nwater's edge. If I had the time, and were a year or two younger, I\r\nshould love well to go up lumbering into the woods. The men for this\r\npurpose are hired in the fall of the year, and are sent up hundreds\r\nof miles away to the pine forests in strong gangs. Everything is\r\nthere found for them. They make log huts for their shelter, and food\r\nof the best and the strongest is taken up for their diet. But no\r\nstrong drink of any kind is allowed, nor is any within reach of the\r\nmen. There are no publics, no shebeen houses, no grog-shops. Sobriety\r\nis an enforced virtue; and so much is this considered by the masters,\r\nand understood by the men, that very little contraband work is done\r\nin the way of taking up spirits to these settlements. It may be said\r\nthat the work up in the forests is done with the assistance of no\r\nstronger drink than tea; and it is very hard work. There cannot be\r\nmuch work that is harder; and it is done amidst the snows and forests\r\nof a Canadian winter. A convict in Bermuda cannot get through his\r\ndaily eight hours of light labour without an allowance of rum; but\r\na Canadian lumberer can manage to do his daily task on tea without\r\nmilk. These men, however, are by no means teetotallers. When they\r\ncome back to the towns they break out, and reward themselves for\r\ntheir long enforced moderation. The wages I found to be very various,\r\nrunning from thirteen or fourteen dollars a month to twenty-eight or\r\nthirty, according to the nature of the work. The men who cut down the\r\ntrees receive more than those who hew them when down, and these again\r\nmore than the under class who make the roads and clear the ground.\r\nThese money wages, however, are in addition to their diet. The\r\noperation requiring the most skill is that of marking the trees for\r\nthe axe. The largest only are worth cutting, and form and soundness\r\nmust also be considered.\r\n\r\nBut if I were about to visit a party of lumberers in the forest, I\r\nshould not be disposed to pass a whole winter with them. Even of a\r\nvery good thing one may have too much. I would go up in the spring,\r\nwhen the rafts are being formed in the small tributary streams, and\r\nI would come down upon one of them, shooting the rapids of the rivers\r\nas soon as the first freshets had left the way open. A freshet in the\r\nrivers is the rush of waters occasioned by melting snow and ice. The\r\nfirst freshets take down the winter waters of the nearer lakes and\r\nrivers. Then the streams become for a time navigable, and the rafts\r\ngo down. After that comes the second freshet, occasioned by the\r\nmelting of far-off snow and ice up in the great northern lakes which\r\nare little known. These rafts are of immense construction, such as\r\nthose which we have seen on the Rhone and Rhine, and often contain\r\ntimber to the value of two, three, and four thousand pounds. At the\r\nrapids the large rafts are, as it were, unyoked, and divided into\r\nsmall portions, which go down separately. The excitement and motion\r\nof such transit must, I should say, be very joyous. I was told that\r\nthe Prince of Wales desired to go down a rapid on a raft, but that\r\nthe men in charge would not undertake to say that there was no\r\npossible danger. Whereupon those who accompanied the prince requested\r\nhis Royal Highness to forbear. I fear that in these careful days\r\ncrowned heads and their heirs must often find themselves in the\r\nposition of Sancho at the banquet. The sailor prince who came after\r\nhis brother was allowed to go down a rapid, and got, as I was told,\r\nrather a rough bump as he did so.\r\n\r\nOttawa is a great place for these timber rafts. Indeed, it may, I\r\nthink, be called the head-quarters of timber for the world. Nearly\r\nall the best pine wood comes down the Ottawa and its tributaries.\r\nThe other rivers by which timber is brought down to the St. Lawrence\r\nare chiefly the St. Maurice, the Madawaska, and the Saguenay; but\r\nthe Ottawa and its tributaries water 75,000 square miles; whereas\r\nthe other three rivers with their tributaries water only 53,000.\r\nThe timber from the Ottawa and St. Maurice finds its way down the\r\nSt. Lawrence to Quebec, where, however, it loses the whole of its\r\npicturesque character. The Saguenay and the Madawaska fall into the\r\nSt. Lawrence below Quebec.\r\n\r\nFrom Ottawa we went by rail to Prescott, which is surely one of the\r\nmost wretched little places to be found in any country. Immediately\r\nopposite to it, on the other side of the St. Lawrence, is the\r\nthriving town of Ogdensburgh. But Ogdensburgh is in the United\r\nStates. Had we been able to learn at Ottawa any facts as to the hours\r\nof the river steamers and railways we might have saved time and have\r\navoided Prescott; but this was out of the question. Had I asked the\r\nexact hour at which I might reach Calcutta by the quickest route, an\r\naccurate reply would not have been more out of the question. I was\r\nmuch struck at Prescott--and indeed all through Canada, though more\r\nin the upper than in the lower province--by the sturdy roughness,\r\nsome would call it insolence, of those of the lower classes of the\r\npeople with whom I was brought into contact. If the words \"lower\r\nclasses\" give offence to any reader, I beg to apologize;--to\r\napologize and to assert that I am one of the last of men to apply\r\nsuch a term in a sense of reproach to those who earn their bread by\r\nthe labour of their hands. But it is hard to find terms which will\r\nbe understood; and that term, whether it give offence or no, will be\r\nunderstood. Of course such a complaint as that I now make is very\r\ncommon as made against the States. Men in the States with horned\r\nhands and fustian coats are very often most unnecessarily insolent\r\nin asserting their independence. What I now mean to say is that\r\nprecisely the same fault is to be found in Canada. I know well what\r\nthe men mean when they offend in this manner. And when I think on\r\nthe subject with deliberation, at my own desk, I can not only excuse,\r\nbut almost approve them. But when one personally encounters their\r\ncorduroy braggadocio; when the man to whose services one is entitled\r\nanswers one with determined insolence; when one is bidden to follow\r\n\"that young lady,\" meaning the chambermaid, or desired, with a toss\r\nof the head, to wait for the \"gentleman who is coming,\" meaning the\r\nboots, the heart is sickened, and the English traveller pines for the\r\ncivility,--for the servility, if my American friends choose to call\r\nit so,--of a well-ordered servant. But the whole scene is easily\r\nconstrued, and turned into English. A man is asked by a stranger some\r\nquestion about his employment, and he replies in a tone which seems\r\nto imply anger, insolence, and a dishonest intention to evade the\r\nservice for which he is paid. Or if there be no question of service\r\nor payment, the man's manner will be the same, and the stranger feels\r\nthat he is slapped in the face and insulted. The translation of\r\nit is this. The man questioned, who is aware that as regards coat,\r\nhat, boots, and outward cleanliness he is below him by whom he is\r\nquestioned, unconsciously feels himself called upon to assert his\r\npolitical equality. It is his shibboleth that he is politically equal\r\nto the best, that he is independent, and that his labour, though it\r\nearn him but a dollar a day by porterage, places him as a citizen on\r\nan equal rank with the most wealthy fellow-man that may employ or\r\naccost him. But being so inferior in that coat, hat and boots matter,\r\nhe is forced to assert his equality by some effort. As he improves in\r\nexternals he will diminish the roughness of his claim. As long as the\r\nman makes his claim with any roughness, so long does he acknowledge\r\nwithin himself some feeling of external inferiority. When that has\r\ngone,--when the American has polished himself up by education and\r\ngeneral well being to a feeling of external equality with gentlemen,\r\nhe shows, I think, no more of that outward braggadocio of\r\nindependence than a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nBut the blow at the moment of the stroke is very galling. I confess\r\nthat I have occasionally all but broken down beneath it. But when it\r\nis thought of afterwards it admits of full excuse. No effort that a\r\nman can make is better than a true effort at independence. But this\r\ninsolence is a false effort, it will be said. It should rather be\r\ncalled a false accompaniment to a life-long true effort. The man\r\nprobably is not dishonest, does not desire to shirk any service which\r\nis due from him,--is not even inclined to insolence. Accept his first\r\ndeclaration of equality for that which it is intended to represent,\r\nand the man afterwards will be found obliging and communicative.\r\nIf occasion offer he will sit down in the room with you and will\r\ntalk with you on any subject that he may choose; but having once\r\nascertained that you show no resentment for this assertion of\r\nequality, he will do pretty nearly all that he is asked. He will at\r\nany rate do as much in that way as an Englishman. I say thus much on\r\nthis subject now especially, because I was quite as much struck by\r\nthe feeling in Canada as I was within the States.\r\n\r\nFrom Prescott we went on by the Grand Trunk Railway to Toronto, and\r\nstayed there for a few days. Toronto is the capital of the province\r\nof Upper Canada, and I presume will in some degree remain so in spite\r\nof Ottawa and its pretensions. That is, the law courts will still\r\nbe held there. I do not know that it will enjoy any other supremacy,\r\nunless it be that of trade and population. Some few years ago Toronto\r\nwas advancing with rapid strides, and was bidding fair to rival\r\nQuebec, or even perhaps Montreal. Hamilton, also, another town of\r\nUpper Canada, was going a head in the true American style; but\r\nthen reverses came in trade, and the towns were checked for a\r\nwhile. Toronto, with a neighbouring suburb which is a part of it,\r\nas Southwark is of London, contains now over 50,000 inhabitants.\r\nThe streets are all parallelogramical, and there is not a single\r\ncurvature to rest the eye. It is built down close upon Lake Ontario;\r\nand as it is also on the Grand Trunk Railway it has all the aid which\r\nfacility of traffic can give it.\r\n\r\nThe two sights of Toronto are the Osgoode Hall and the University.\r\nThe Osgoode Hall is to Upper Canada what the Four Courts are to\r\nIreland. The law courts are all held there. Exteriorly little can\r\nbe said for Osgoode Hall, whereas the exterior of the Four Courts\r\nin Dublin is very fine; but as an interior the temple of Themis at\r\nToronto beats hollow that which the goddess owns in Dublin. In Dublin\r\nthe Courts themselves are shabby, and the space under the dome is\r\nnot so fine as the exterior seems to promise that it should be. In\r\nToronto the Courts themselves are, I think, the most commodious that\r\nI ever saw, and the passages, vestibules, and hall are very handsome.\r\nIn Upper Canada the common law judges and those in Chancery are\r\ndivided as they are in England; but it is, as I was told, the opinion\r\nof Canadian lawyers that the work may be thrown together. Appeal is\r\nallowed in criminal cases; but as far as I could learn such power of\r\nappeal is held to be both troublesome and useless. In Lower Canada\r\nthe old French laws are still administered.\r\n\r\nBut the University is the glory of Toronto. This is a Gothic building\r\nand will take rank after, but next to the buildings at Ottawa. It\r\nwill be the second piece of noble architecture in Canada, and as far\r\nas I know on the American continent. It is, I believe, intended to be\r\npurely Norman, though I doubt whether the received types of Norman\r\narchitecture have not been departed from in many of the windows. Be\r\nthis as it may the College is a manly, noble structure, free from\r\nfalse decoration, and infinitely creditable to those who projected\r\nit. I was informed by the head of the College that it has been open\r\nonly two years, and here also I fancy that the colony has been much\r\nindebted to the taste of the late Governor, Sir Edmund Head.\r\n\r\nToronto as a city is not generally attractive to a traveller. The\r\ncountry around it is flat; and, though it stands on a lake, that\r\nlake has no attributes of beauty. Large inland seas such as are\r\nthese great Northern lakes of America never have such attributes.\r\nPicturesque mountains rise from narrow valleys, such as form the beds\r\nof lakes in Switzerland, Scotland, and Northern Italy. But from such\r\nbroad waters as those of Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Lake Michigan,\r\nthe shores shelve very gradually, and have none of the materials of\r\nlovely scenery.\r\n\r\nThe streets in Toronto are framed with wood, or rather planked, as\r\nare those of Montreal and Quebec; but they are kept in better order.\r\nI should say that the planks are first used at Toronto, then sent\r\ndown by the lake to Montreal, and when all but rotted out there, are\r\nagain floated off by the St. Lawrence to be used in the thoroughfares\r\nof the old French capital. But if the streets of Toronto are better\r\nthan those of the other towns, the roads round it are worse. I had\r\nthe honour of meeting two distinguished members of the Provincial\r\nParliament at dinner some few miles out of town, and, returning back\r\na short while after they had left our host's house, was glad to be\r\nof use in picking them up from a ditch into which their carriage had\r\nbeen upset. To me it appeared all but miraculous that any carriage\r\nshould make its way over that road without such misadventure. I may\r\nperhaps be allowed to hope that the discomfiture of those worthy\r\nlegislators may lead to some improvement in the thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nI had on a previous occasion gone down the St. Lawrence, through the\r\nthousand isles, and over the rapids in one of those large summer\r\nsteamboats which ply upon the lake and river. I cannot say that I was\r\nmuch struck by the scenery, and therefore did not encroach upon my\r\ntime by making the journey again. Such an opinion will be regarded\r\nas heresy by many who think much of the thousand islands. I do not\r\nbelieve that they would be expressly noted by any traveller who was\r\nnot expressly bidden to admire them.\r\n\r\nFrom Toronto we went across to Niagara, re-entering the States at\r\nLewiston in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONNEXION OF THE CANADAS WITH GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the American war began troops were sent out to Canada, and when\r\nI was in the Provinces more troops were then expected. The matter was\r\nmuch talked of, as a matter of course, in Canada; and it had been\r\ndiscussed in England before I left. I had seen much said about it\r\nin the English papers since, and it also had become the subject of\r\nvery hot question among the politicians of the Northern States.\r\nThe measure had at that time given more umbrage to the North than\r\nanything else done or said by England from the beginning of the war\r\nup to that time, except the declaration made by Lord John Russell in\r\nthe House of Commons as to the neutrality to be preserved by England\r\nbetween the two belligerents. The argument used by the Northern\r\nStates was this. If France collects men and material of war in the\r\nneighbourhood of England, England considers herself injured, calls\r\nfor an explanation, and talks of invasion. Therefore as England is\r\nnow collecting men and material of war in our neighbourhood, we\r\nwill consider ourselves injured. It does not suit us to ask for an\r\nexplanation, because it is not our habit to interfere with other\r\nnations. We will not pretend to say that we think we are to be\r\ninvaded. But as we clearly are injured, we will express our anger at\r\nthat injury, and when the opportunity shall come will take advantage\r\nof having that new grievance.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, a very large increase of force was sent when we\r\nwere still in doubt as to the termination of the Trent affair, and\r\nimagined that war was imminent. But the sending of that large force\r\ndid not anger the Americans, as the first despatch of troops to\r\nCanada had angered them. Things had so turned out that measures of\r\nmilitary precaution were acknowledged by them to be necessary. I\r\ncannot, however, but think that Mr. Seward might have spared that\r\noffer to send British troops across Maine; and so, also, have all his\r\ncountrymen thought by whom I have heard the matter discussed.\r\n\r\nAs to any attempt at invasion of Canada by the Americans, or idea\r\nof punishing the alleged injuries suffered by the States from Great\r\nBritain by the annexation of those provinces, I do not believe that\r\nany sane-minded citizens of the States believe in the possibility of\r\nsuch retaliation. Some years since the Americans thought that Canada\r\nmight shine in the Union firmament as a new star, but that delusion\r\nis, I think, over. Such annexation if ever made, must have been made\r\nnot only against the arms of England but must also have been made\r\nin accordance with the wishes of the people so annexed. It was then\r\nbelieved that the Canadians were not averse to such a change, and\r\nthere may possibly have then been among them the remnant of such a\r\nwish. There is certainly no such desire now, not even a remnant of\r\nsuch a desire; and the truth on this matter is, I think, generally\r\nacknowledged. The feeling in Canada is one of strong aversion to the\r\nUnited States Government, and of predilection for self-government\r\nunder the English Crown. A fainéant Governor and the prestige of\r\nBritish power is now the political aspiration of the Canadians in\r\ngeneral; and I think that this is understood in the States. Moreover\r\nthe States have a job of work on hand which, as they themselves\r\nare well aware, is taxing all their energies. Such being the case\r\nI do not think that England needs to fear any invasion of Canada,\r\nauthorized by the States Government.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of a grievance on the part of the States was a manifest\r\nabsurdity. The new reinforcement of the garrisons in Canada did not,\r\nwhen I was in Canada, amount as I believe to more than 2,000 men. But\r\nhad it amounted to 20,000 the States would have had no just ground\r\nfor complaint. Of all nationalities that in modern days have risen\r\nto power, they above all others have shown that they would do what\r\nthey liked with their own, indifferent to foreign councils, and\r\ndeaf to foreign remonstrance. \"Do you go your way, and let us go\r\nours. We will trouble you with no question, nor do you trouble us.\"\r\nSuch has been their national policy, and it has obtained for them\r\ngreat respect. They have resisted the temptation of putting their\r\nfingers into the caldron of foreign policy; and foreign politicians,\r\nacknowledging their reserve in this respect, have not been offended\r\nat the bristles with which their Noli me tangere has been proclaimed.\r\nTheir intelligence has been appreciated, and their conduct has been\r\nrespected. But if this has been their line of policy, they must be\r\nentirely out of court in raising any question as to the position of\r\nBritish troops on British soil.\r\n\r\n\"It shows us that you doubt us,\" an American says, with an air of\r\ninjured honour--or did say, before that Trent affair. \"And it is done\r\nto express sympathy with the South. The Southerners understand it,\r\nand we understand it also. We know where your hearts are--nay, your\r\nvery souls. They are among the slave-begotten cotton bales of the\r\nrebel South.\" Then comes the whole of the long argument, in which it\r\nseems so easy to an Englishman to prove that England in the whole of\r\nthis sad matter has been true and loyal to her friend. She could not\r\ninterfere when the husband and wife would quarrel. She could only\r\ngrieve, and wish that things might come right and smooth for both\r\nparties. But the argument though so easy is never effectual.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me foolish in an American to quarrel with England for\r\nsending soldiers to Canada; but I cannot say that I thought it was\r\nwell done to send them at the beginning of the war. The English\r\nGovernment did not, I presume, take this step with reference to any\r\npossible invasion of Canada by the Government of the States. We are\r\nfortifying Portsmouth, and Portland, and Plymouth, because we would\r\nfain be safe against the French army acting under a French Emperor.\r\nBut we sent 2,000 troops to Canada, if I understand the matter\r\nrightly, to guard our provinces against the filibustering energies of\r\na mass of unemployed American soldiers, when those soldiers should\r\ncome to be disbanded. When this war shall be over--a war during which\r\nnot much, if any, under a million of American citizens will have been\r\nunder arms--it will not be easy for all who survive to return to\r\ntheir old homes and old occupations. Nor does a disbanded soldier\r\nalways make a good husbandman, notwithstanding the great examples of\r\nCincinnatus and Bird-o'-freedom Sawin. It may be that a considerable\r\namount of filibustering energy will be afloat, and that the then\r\nGovernment of those who neighbour us in Canada will have other\r\nmatters in hand more important to them than the controlling of these\r\nunruly spirits. That, as I take it, was the evil against which we of\r\nGreat Britain and of Canada desired to guard ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut I doubt whether 2,000 or 10,000 British soldiers would be any\r\neffective guard against such inroads, and I doubt more strongly\r\nwhether any such external guarding will be necessary. If the\r\nCanadians were prepared to fraternize with filibusters from the\r\nStates, neither three nor ten thousand soldiers would avail against\r\nsuch a feeling over a frontier stretching from the State of Maine to\r\nthe shores of Lake Huron and Lake Erie. If such a feeling did exist,\r\nif the Canadians wished the change, in God's name let them go. It is\r\nfor their sakes and not for our own that we would have them bound to\r\nus. But the Canadians are averse to such a change with a degree of\r\nfeeling that amounts to national intensity. Their sympathies are with\r\nthe Southern States, not because they care for cotton, not because\r\nthey are anti-abolitionists, not because they admire the hearty\r\npluck of those who are endeavouring to work out for themselves a new\r\nrevolution. They sympathize with the South from strong dislike to the\r\naggression, the braggadocio, and the insolence they have felt upon\r\ntheir own borders. They dislike Mr. Seward's weak and vulgar joke\r\nwith the Duke of Newcastle. They dislike Mr. Everett's flattering\r\nhints to his countrymen as to the one nation that is to occupy the\r\nwhole continent. They dislike the Monroe doctrine. They wonder at the\r\nmeekness with which England has endured the vauntings of the Northern\r\nStates, and are endued with no such meekness of their own. They\r\nwould, I believe, be well prepared to meet and give an account of any\r\nfilibusters who might visit them; and I am not sure that it is wisely\r\ndone on our part to show any intention of taking the work out of\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nBut I am led to this opinion in no degree by a feeling that Great\r\nBritain ought to grudge the cost of the soldiers. If Canada will be\r\nsafer with them, in heaven's name let her have them. It has been\r\nargued in many places, not only with regard to Canada, but as to all\r\nour self-governed colonies, that military service should not be given\r\nat British expense and with British men to any colony which has its\r\nown representative government, and which levies its own taxes. \"While\r\nGreat Britain absolutely held the reins of government, and did as it\r\npleased with the affairs of its dependencies,\" such politicians say,\r\n\"it was just and right that she should pay the bill. As long as her\r\ngovernment of a colony was paternal, so long was it right that the\r\nmother country should put herself in the place of a father, and\r\nenjoy a father's undoubted prerogative of putting his hand into\r\nhis breeches pocket to provide for all the wants of his child. But\r\nwhen the adult son set up for himself in business, having received\r\neducation from the parent, and having had his apprentice fees duly\r\npaid, then that son should settle his own bills, and look no longer\r\nto the paternal pocket.\" Such is the law of the world all over, from\r\nlittle birds whose young fly away when fledged, upwards to men and\r\nnations. Let the father work for the child while he is a child,\r\nbut when the child has become a man let him lean no longer on his\r\nfather's staff.\r\n\r\nThe argument is, I think, very good; but it proves, not that we are\r\nrelieved from the necessity of assisting our colonies with payments\r\nmade out of British taxes, but that we are still bound to give such\r\nassistance; and that we shall continue to be so bound as long as we\r\nallow these colonies to adhere to us, or as they allow us to adhere\r\nto them. In fact the young bird is not yet fully fledged. That\r\nillustration of the father and the child is a just one, but in order\r\nto make it just it should be followed throughout. When the son is\r\nin fact established on his own bottom, then the father expects that\r\nhe will live without assistance. But when the son does so live he\r\nis freed from all paternal control. The father, while he expects to\r\nbe obeyed, continues to fill the paternal office of paymaster,--of\r\npaymaster, at any rate, to some extent. And so, I think, it must be\r\nwith our colonies. The Canadas at present are not independent, and\r\nhave not political power of their own apart from the political power\r\nof Great Britain. England has declared herself neutral as regards the\r\nNorthern and Southern States, and by that neutrality the Canadas are\r\nbound; and yet the Canadas were not consulted in the matter. Should\r\nEngland go to war with France, Canada must close her ports against\r\nFrench vessels. If England chooses to send her troops to Canadian\r\nbarracks, Canada cannot refuse to accept them. If England should send\r\nto Canada an unpopular Governor, Canada has no power to reject his\r\nservices. As long as Canada is a colony, so called, she cannot be\r\nindependent, and should not be expected to walk alone. It is exactly\r\nthe same with the colonies of Australia, with New Zealand, with\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and with Jamaica. While England enjoys the\r\nprestige of her colonies, while she boasts that such large and now\r\npopulous territories are her dependencies, she must and should be\r\ncontent to pay some portion of the bill. Surely it is absurd\r\non our part to quarrel with Caffre warfare, with New Zealand\r\nfighting, and the rest of it. Such complaints remind one of an\r\nancient paterfamilias, who insists on having his children and his\r\ngrandchildren under the old paternal roof, and then grumbles because\r\nthe butcher's bill is high. Those who will keep large households and\r\nbountiful tables should not be afraid of facing the butcher's bill,\r\nor unhappy at the tonnage of the coal. It is a grand thing, that\r\npower of keeping a large table; but it ceases to be grand when the\r\nitems heaped upon it cause inward groans and outward moodiness.\r\n\r\nWhy should the colonies remain true to us as children are true to\r\ntheir parents, if we grudge them the assistance which is due to a\r\nchild? They raise their own taxes, it is said, and administer them.\r\nTrue; and it is well that the growing son should do something for\r\nhimself. While the father does all for him the son's labour belongs\r\nto the father. Then comes a middle state in which the son does\r\nmuch for himself, but not all. In that middle state now stand our\r\nprosperous colonies. Then comes the time when the son shall stand\r\nalone by his own strength; and to that period of manly self-respected\r\nstrength let us all hope that those colonies are advancing. It is\r\nvery hard for a mother country to know when such a time has come;\r\nand hard also for the child-colony to recognize justly the period of\r\nits own maturity. Whether or no such severance may ever take place\r\nwithout a quarrel, without weakness on one side and pride on the\r\nother, is a problem in the world's history yet to be solved. The most\r\nsuccessful child that ever yet has gone off from a successful parent\r\nand taken its own path into the world, is without doubt the nation\r\nof the United States. Their present troubles are the result and\r\nthe proofs of their success. The people that were too great to be\r\ndependent on any nation have now spread till they are themselves too\r\ngreat for a single nationality. No one now thinks that that daughter\r\nshould have remained longer subject to her mother. But the severance\r\nwas not made in amity, and the shrill notes of the old family quarrel\r\nare still sometimes heard across the waters.\r\n\r\nFrom all this the question arises whether that problem may ever be\r\nsolved with reference to the Canadas. That it will never be their\r\ndestiny to join themselves to the States of the Union, I feel fully\r\nconvinced. In the first place it is becoming evident from the present\r\ncircumstances of the Union,--if it had never been made evident by\r\nhistory before,--that different people with different habits living\r\nat long distances from each other cannot well be brought together\r\non equal terms under one Government. That noble ambition of the\r\nAmericans that all the continent north of the isthmus should be\r\nunited under one flag, has already been thrown from its saddle. The\r\nNorth and South are virtually separated, and the day will come in\r\nwhich the West also will secede. As population increases and trades\r\narise peculiar to those different climates, the interests of the\r\npeople will differ, and a new secession will take place beneficial\r\nalike to both parties. If this be so, if even there be any tendency\r\nthis way, it affords the strongest argument against the probability\r\nof any future annexation of the Canadas. And then, in the second\r\nplace, the feeling of Canada is not American, but British. If ever\r\nshe be separated from Great Britain, she will be separated as the\r\nStates were separated. She will desire to stand alone, and to enter\r\nherself as one among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nShe will desire to stand alone;--alone, that is without dependence\r\neither on England or on the States. But she is so circumstanced\r\ngeographically that she can never stand alone without amalgamation\r\nwith our other North American provinces. She has an outlet to the\r\nsea at the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but it is only a summer outlet. Her\r\nwinter outlet is by railway through the States, and no other winter\r\noutlet is possible for her except through the sister provinces.\r\nBefore Canada can be nationally great, the line of railway which now\r\nruns for some hundred miles below Quebec to Rivière du Loup, must be\r\ncontinued on through New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the port of\r\nHalifax.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Canada I heard the question discussed of a Federal\r\nGovernment between the provinces of the two Canadas, New Brunswick\r\nand Nova Scotia. To these were added, or not added, according to\r\nthe opinion of those who spoke, the smaller outlying colonies of\r\nNewfoundland and Prince Edward's Island. If a scheme for such a\r\nGovernment were projected in Downing Street, all would no doubt be\r\nincluded, and a clean sweep would be made without difficulty. But\r\nthe project as made in the colonies appears in different guises as\r\nit comes either from Canada or from one of the other provinces. The\r\nCanadian idea would be that the two Canadas should form two States\r\nof such a confederation, and the other provinces a third State. But\r\nthis slight participation in power would hardly suit the views of New\r\nBrunswick and Nova Scotia. In speaking of such a Federal Government\r\nas this, I shall of course be understood as meaning a confederation\r\nacting in connection with a British Governor, and dependent upon\r\nGreat Britain as far as the different colonies are now dependent.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that such a confederation might be formed with\r\ngreat advantage to all the colonies and to Great Britain. At present\r\nthe Canadas are in effect almost more distant from Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick than they are from England. The intercourse between\r\nthem is very slight--so slight that it may almost be said that there\r\nis no intercourse. A few men of science or of political importance\r\nmay from time to time make their way from one colony into the other,\r\nbut even this is not common. Beyond that they seldom see each other.\r\nThough New Brunswick borders both with Lower Canada and with Nova\r\nScotia, thus making one whole of the three colonies, there is neither\r\nrailroad nor stage conveyance running from one to the other. And yet\r\ntheir interests should be similar. From geographical position their\r\nmodes of life must be alike, and a close conjunction between them is\r\nessentially necessary to give British North America any political\r\nimportance in the world. There can be no such conjunction, no\r\namalgamation of interests, until a railway shall have been made\r\njoining the Canada Grand Trunk Line with the two outlying colonies.\r\nUpper Canada can feed all England with wheat, and could do so without\r\nany aid of railway through the States, if a railway were made from\r\nQuebec to Halifax. But then comes the question of the cost. The\r\nCanada Grand Trunk is at the present moment at the lowest ebb of\r\ncommercial misfortune, and with such a fact patent to the world what\r\ncompany will come forward with funds for making four or five hundred\r\nmiles of railway, through a district of which one half is not\r\nyet prepared for population? It would be, I imagine, out of the\r\nquestion that such a speculation should for many years give any fair\r\ncommercial interest on the money to be expended. But nevertheless\r\nto the colonies,--that is, to the enormous regions of British\r\nNorth America,--such a railroad would be invaluable. Under such\r\ncircumstances it is for the Home Government and the colonies between\r\nthem to see how such a measure may be carried out. As a national\r\nexpenditure to be defrayed in the course of years by the territories\r\ninterested, the sum of money required would be very small.\r\n\r\nBut how would this affect England? And how would England be affected\r\nby a union of the British North American colonies under one Federal\r\nGovernment? Before this question can be answered, he who prepares to\r\nanswer it must consider what interest England has in her colonies,\r\nand for what purpose she holds them. Does she hold them for profit,\r\nor for glory, or for power; or does she hold them in order that she\r\nmay carry out the duty which has devolved upon her of extending\r\ncivilization, freedom, and well-being through the new uprising\r\nnations of the world? Does she hold them, in fact, for her own\r\nbenefit, or does she hold them for theirs? I know nothing of the\r\nethics of the Colonial Office, and not much perhaps of those of the\r\nHouse of Commons; but looking at what Great Britain has hitherto done\r\nin the way of colonization, I cannot but think that the national\r\nambition looks to the welfare of the colonists, and not to home\r\naggrandisement. That the two may run together is most probable.\r\nIndeed there can be no glory to a people so great or so readily\r\nrecognized by mankind at large as that of spreading civilization from\r\nEast to West, and from North to South. But the one object should be\r\nthe prosperity of the colonists; and not profit, nor glory, nor even\r\npower to the parent country.\r\n\r\nThere is no virtue of which more has been said and sung than\r\npatriotism, and none which when pure and true has led to finer\r\nresults. Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori. To live for one's\r\ncountry also is a very beautiful and proper thing. But if we examine\r\nclosely much patriotism, that is so called, we shall find it going\r\nhand in hand with a good deal that is selfish, and with not a little\r\nthat is devilish. It was some fine fury of patriotic feeling which\r\nenabled the national poet to put into the mouth of every Englishman\r\nthat horrible prayer with regard to our enemies, which we sing when\r\nwe wish to do honour to our sovereign. It did not seem to him that it\r\nmight be well to pray that their hearts should be softened, and our\r\nown hearts softened also. National success was all that a patriotic\r\npoet could desire, and therefore in our national hymn have we gone\r\non imploring the Lord to arise and scatter our enemies; to confound\r\ntheir politics, whether they be good or ill; and to expose their\r\nknavish tricks,--such knavish tricks being taken for granted. And\r\nthen with a steady confidence we used to declare how certain we\r\nwere that we should achieve all that was desirable, not exactly by\r\ntrusting to our prayer to heaven, but by relying almost exclusively\r\non George the Third or George the Fourth. Now I have always thought\r\nthat that was rather a poor patriotism. Luckily for us our national\r\nconduct has not squared itself with our national anthem. Any\r\npatriotism must be poor which desires glory or even profit for a few\r\nat the expense of many, even though the few be brothers and the many\r\naliens. As a rule patriotism is a virtue only because man's aptitude\r\nfor good is so finite, that he cannot see and comprehend a wider\r\nhumanity. He can hardly bring himself to understand that salvation\r\nshould be extended to Jew and Gentile alike. The word philanthropy\r\nhas become odious, and I would fain not use it; but the thing itself\r\nis as much higher than patriotism, as heaven is above the earth.\r\n\r\nA wish that British North America should ever be severed from\r\nEngland, or that the Australian colonies should ever be so severed,\r\nwill by many Englishmen be deemed unpatriotic. But I think that\r\nsuch severance is to be wished if it be the case that the colonies\r\nstanding alone would become more prosperous than they are under\r\nBritish rule. We have before us an example in the United States of\r\nthe prosperity which has attended such a rupture of old ties. I will\r\nnot now contest the point with those who say that the present moment\r\nof an American civil war is ill chosen for vaunting that prosperity.\r\nThere stand the cities which the people have built, and their power\r\nis attested by the world-wide importance of their present contest.\r\nAnd if the States have so risen since they left their parent's\r\napron-string, why should not British North America rise as high? That\r\nthe time has as yet come for such rising I do not think; but that it\r\nwill soon come I do most heartily hope. The making of the railway\r\nof which I have spoken, and the amalgamation of the provinces would\r\ngreatly tend to such an event. If, therefore, England desires to keep\r\nthese colonies in a state of dependency; if it be more essential to\r\nher to maintain her own power with regard to them than to increase\r\ntheir influence; if her main object be to keep the colonies and not\r\nto improve the colonies, then I should say that an amalgamation of\r\nthe Canadas with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick should not be regarded\r\nwith favour by statesmen in Downing Street. But if, as I would fain\r\nhope, and do partly believe, such ideas of national power as these\r\nare now out of vogue with British statesmen, then I think that such\r\nan amalgamation should receive all the support which Downing Street\r\ncan give it.\r\n\r\nThe United States severed themselves from Great Britain with a great\r\nstruggle and after heartburnings and bloodshed. Whether Great Britain\r\nwill ever allow any colony of hers to depart from out of her nest, to\r\nsecede and start for herself, without any struggle or heartburnings,\r\nwith all furtherance for such purpose which an old and powerful\r\ncountry can give to a new nationality then first taking its own place\r\nin the world's arena, is a problem yet to be solved. There is, I\r\nthink, no more beautiful sight than that of a mother, still in all\r\nthe glory of womanhood, preparing the wedding trousseau for her\r\ndaughter. The child hitherto has been obedient and submissive. She\r\nhas been one of a household in which she has held no command. She has\r\nsat at table as a child, fitting herself in all things to the behests\r\nof others. But the day of her power and her glory, and also of her\r\ncares and solicitude is at hand. She is to go forth, and do as she\r\nbest may in the world under that teaching which her old home has\r\ngiven her. The hour of separation has come; and the mother, smiling\r\nthrough her tears, sends her forth decked with a bounteous hand and\r\nfurnished with full stores, so that all may be well with her as she\r\nenters on her new duties. So is it that England should send forth her\r\ndaughters. They should not escape from her arms with shrill screams\r\nand bleeding wounds, with ill-omened words which live so long, though\r\nthe speakers of them lie cold in their graves.\r\n\r\nBut this sending forth of a child-nation to take its own political\r\nstatus in the world has never yet been done by Great Britain. I\r\ncannot remember that such has ever been done by any great power with\r\nreference to its dependency;--by any power that was powerful enough\r\nto keep such dependency within its grasp. But a man thinking on these\r\nmatters cannot but hope that a time will come when such amicable\r\nseverance may be effected. Great Britain cannot think that through\r\nall coming ages she is to be the mistress of the vast continent of\r\nAustralia, lying on the other side of the globe's surface; that she\r\nis to be the mistress of all South Africa, as civilization shall\r\nextend northward; that the enormous territories of British North\r\nAmerica are to be subject for ever to a veto from Downing Street.\r\nIf the history of past empires does not teach her that this may not\r\nbe so, at least the history of the United States might so teach her.\r\n\"But we have learned a lesson from those United States,\" the patriot\r\nwill argue who dares to hope that the glory and extent of the British\r\nEmpire may remain unimpaired _in sæcula sæculorum_. \"Since that day\r\nwe have given political rights to our colonies, and have satisfied\r\nthe political longings of their inhabitants. We do not tax their\r\ntea and stamps, but leave it to them to tax themselves as they may\r\nplease.\" True. But in political aspirations the giving of an inch\r\nhas ever created the desire for an ell. If the Australian colonies,\r\neven now,--with their scanty population and still young civilization,\r\nchafe against imperial interference, will they submit to it when they\r\nfeel within their veins all the full blood of political manhood? What\r\nis the cry even of the Canadians--of the Canadians who are thoroughly\r\nloyal to England? Send us a fainéant Governor, a King Log, who will\r\nnot presume to interfere with us; a Governor who will spend his money\r\nand live like a gentleman and care little or nothing for politics.\r\nThat is the Canadian _beau idéal_ of a Governor. They are to govern\r\nthemselves; and he who comes to them from England is to sit among\r\nthem as the silent representative of England's protection. If that\r\nbe true--and I do not think that any who know the Canadas will\r\ndeny it--must it not be presumed that they will soon also desire a\r\nfainéant minister in Downing Street? Of course they will so desire.\r\nMen do not become milder in their aspirations for political power,\r\nthe more that political power is extended to them. Nor would it be\r\nwell that they should be so humble in their desires. Nations devoid\r\nof political power have never risen high in the world's esteem. Even\r\nwhen they have been commercially successful, commerce has not brought\r\nto them the greatness which it has always given when joined with a\r\nstrong political existence. The Greeks are commercially rich and\r\nactive; but \"Greece\" and \"Greek\" are bye-words now for all that is\r\nmean. Cuba is a colony, and putting aside the cities of the States,\r\nthe Havana is the richest town on the other side of the Atlantic and\r\ncommercially the greatest; but the political villainy of Cuba, her\r\ndaily importation of slaves, her breaches of treaty, and the bribery\r\nof her all but royal Governor are known to all men. But Canada is not\r\ndishonest; Canada is no bye-word for anything evil; Canada eats her\r\nown bread in the sweat of her brow, and fears a bad word from no\r\nman. True. But why does New York with its suburbs boast a million of\r\ninhabitants, while Montreal has 85,000? Why has that babe in years,\r\nChicago, 120,000, while Toronto has not half the number? I do not say\r\nthat Montreal and Toronto should have gone ahead abreast with New\r\nYork and Chicago. In such races one must be first, and one last. But\r\nI do say that the Canadian towns will have no equal chance, till\r\nthey are actuated by that feeling of political independence which has\r\ncreated the growth of the towns in the United States.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the time has yet come in which Great Britain\r\nshould desire the Canadians to start for themselves. There is the\r\nmaking of that railroad to be effected, and something done towards\r\nthe union of those provinces. Canada could no more stand alone\r\nwithout New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, than could those latter\r\ncolonies without Canada. But I think it would be well to be prepared\r\nfor such a coming day; and that it would at any rate be well to bring\r\nhome to ourselves and realize the idea of such secession on the\r\npart of our colonies, when the time shall have come at which such\r\nsecession may be carried out with profit and security to them. Great\r\nBritain, should she ever send forth her child alone into the world,\r\nmust of course guarantee her security. Such guarantees are given\r\nby treaties; and in the wording of them it is presumed that such\r\ntreaties will last for ever. It will be argued that in starting\r\nBritish North America as a political power on its own bottom, we\r\nshould bind ourself to all the expense of its defence, while we\r\nshould give up all right to any interference in its concerns; and\r\nthat from a state of things so unprofitable as this there would be no\r\nprospect of deliverance. But such treaties, let them be worded how\r\nthey will, do not last for ever. For a time, no doubt, Great Britain\r\nwould be so hampered--if indeed she would feel herself hampered by\r\nextending her name and prestige to a country bound to her by ties\r\nsuch as those which would then exist between her and this new nation.\r\nSuch treaties are not everlasting, nor can they be made to last even\r\nfor ages. Those who word them seem to think that powers and dynasties\r\nwill never pass away. But they do pass away, and the balance of power\r\nwill not keep itself fixed for ever on the same pivot. The time may\r\ncome--that it may not come soon we will all desire--but the time may\r\ncome when the name and prestige of what we call British North America\r\nwill be as serviceable to Great Britain as those of Great Britain are\r\nnow serviceable to her colonies.\r\n\r\nBut what shall be the new form of government for the new kingdom?\r\nThat is a speculation very interesting to a politician; though one\r\nwhich to follow out at great length in these early days would be\r\nrather premature. That it should be a kingdom--that the political\r\narrangement should be one of which a crowned hereditary king\r\nshould form a part, nineteen out of every twenty Englishmen would\r\ndesire; and, as I fancy, so would also nineteen out of every twenty\r\nCanadians. A king for the United States when they first established\r\nthemselves was impossible. A total rupture from the Old World and all\r\nits habits was necessary for them. The name of a king, or monarch, or\r\nsovereign had become horrible to their ears. Even to this day they\r\nhave not learned the difference between arbitrary power retained in\r\nthe hand of one man, such as that now held by the Emperor over the\r\nFrench, and such hereditary headship in the State as that which\r\nbelongs to the Crown in Great Britain. And this was necessary, seeing\r\nthat their division from us was effected by strife, and carried out\r\nwith war and bitter animosities. In those days also there was a\r\nremnant, though but a small remnant, of the power of tyranny left\r\nwithin the scope of the British Crown. That small remnant has been\r\nremoved; and to me it seems that no form of existing government--no\r\nform of government that ever did exist, gives or has given so large\r\na measure of individual freedom to all who live under it as a\r\nconstitutional monarchy in which the Crown is divested of direct\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\nI will venture then to suggest a king for this new nation; and seeing\r\nthat we are rich in princes there need be no difficulty in the\r\nselection. Would it not be beautiful to see a new nation established\r\nunder such auspices, and to establish a people to whom their\r\nindependence had been given,--to whom it had been freely surrendered\r\nas soon as they were capable of holding the position assigned to\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nNIAGARA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the sights on this earth of ours which tourists travel to\r\nsee,--at least of all those which I have seen,--I am inclined to give\r\nthe palm to the Falls of Niagara. In the catalogue of such sights I\r\nintend to include all buildings, pictures, statues, and wonders of\r\nart made by men's hands, and also all beauties of nature prepared by\r\nthe Creator for the delight of his creatures. This is a long word;\r\nbut as far as my taste and judgment go, it is justified. I know no\r\nother one thing so beautiful, so glorious, and so powerful. I would\r\nnot by this be understood as saying that a traveller wishing to do\r\nthe best with his time should first of all places seek Niagara. In\r\nvisiting Florence he may learn almost all that modern art can teach.\r\nAt Rome he will be brought to understand the cold hearts, correct\r\neyes, and cruel ambition of the old Latin race. In Switzerland he\r\nwill surround himself with a flood of grandeur and loveliness, and\r\nfill himself, if he be capable of such filling, with a flood of\r\nromance. The Tropics will unfold to him all that vegetation in its\r\ngreatest richness can produce. In Paris he will find the supreme\r\nof polish, the _ne plus ultra_ of varnish according to the world's\r\ncapability of varnishing. And in London he will find the supreme\r\nof power, the _ne plus ultra_ of work according to the world's\r\ncapability of working. Any one of such journeys may be more valuable\r\nto a man,--nay, any one such journey must be more valuable to a\r\nman,--than a visit to Niagara. At Niagara there is that fall of\r\nwaters alone. But that fall is more graceful than Giotto's tower,\r\nmore noble than the Apollo. The peaks of the Alps are not so\r\nastounding in their solitude. The valleys of the Blue Mountains in\r\nJamaica are less green. The finished glaze of life in Paris is less\r\ninvariable; and the full tide of trade round the Bank of England is\r\nnot so inexorably powerful.\r\n\r\nI came across an artist at Niagara who was attempting to draw the\r\nspray of the waters. \"You have a difficult subject,\" said I. \"All\r\nsubjects are difficult,\" he replied, \"to a man who desires to do\r\nwell.\" \"But yours, I fear, is impossible,\" I said. \"You have no\r\nright to say so till I have finished my picture,\" he replied. I\r\nacknowledged the justice of his rebuke, regretted that I could not\r\nremain till the completion of his work should enable me to revoke\r\nmy words, and passed on. Then I began to reflect whether I did not\r\nintend to try a task as difficult in describing the falls, and\r\nwhether I felt any of that proud self-confidence which kept him happy\r\nat any rate while his task was in hand. I will not say that it is as\r\ndifficult to describe aright that rush of waters, as it is to paint\r\nit well. But I doubt whether it is not quite as difficult to write\r\na description that shall interest the reader, as it is to paint a\r\npicture of them that shall be pleasant to the beholder. My friend the\r\nartist was at any rate not afraid to make the attempt, and I also\r\nwill try my hand.\r\n\r\nThat the waters of Lake Erie have come down in their courses from the\r\nbroad basins of Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, and Lake Huron; that\r\nthese waters fall into Lake Ontario by the short and rapid river of\r\nNiagara, and that the Falls of Niagara are made by a sudden break\r\nin the level of this rapid river, is probably known to all who will\r\nread this book. All the waters of these huge northern inland seas run\r\nover that breach in the rocky bottom of the stream; and thence it\r\ncomes that the flow is unceasing in its grandeur, and that no eye\r\ncan perceive a difference in the weight, or sound, or violence of\r\nthe fall, whether it be visited in the drought of autumn, amidst the\r\nstorms of winter, or after the melting of the upper worlds of ice in\r\nthe days of the early summer. How many cataracts does the habitual\r\ntourist visit at which the waters fail him? But at Niagara the waters\r\nnever fail. There it thunders over its ledge in a volume that never\r\nceases and is never diminished;--as it has done from times previous\r\nto the life of man, and as it will do till tens of thousands of years\r\nshall see the rocky bed of the river worn away, back to the upper\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nThis stream divides Canada from the States, the western or\r\nfarthermost bank belonging to the British Crown, and the eastern or\r\nnearer bank being in the State of New York. In visiting Niagara it\r\nalways becomes a question on which side the visitor shall take up his\r\nquarters. On the Canada side there is no town, but there is a large\r\nhotel, beautifully placed immediately opposite to the falls, and this\r\nis generally thought to be the best locality for tourists. In the\r\nState of New York is the town called Niagara Falls, and here there\r\nare two large hotels, which, as to their immediate site, are not so\r\nwell placed as that in Canada. I first visited Niagara some three\r\nyears since. I stayed then at the Clifton House on the Canada side,\r\nand have since sworn by that position. But the Clifton House was\r\nclosed for the season when I was last there, and on that account we\r\nwent to the Cataract House in the town on the other side. I now think\r\nthat I should set up my staff on the American side if I went again.\r\nMy advice on the subject to any party starting for Niagara would\r\ndepend upon their habits, or on their nationality. I would send\r\nAmericans to the Canadian side, because they dislike walking; but\r\nEnglish people I would locate on the American side, seeing that\r\nthey are generally accustomed to the frequent use of their own legs.\r\nThe two sides are not very easily approached, one from the other.\r\nImmediately below the falls there is a ferry, which may be traversed\r\nat the expense of a shilling; but the labour of getting up and down\r\nfrom the ferry is considerable, and the passage becomes wearisome.\r\nThere is also a bridge, but it is two miles down the river, making a\r\nwalk or drive of four miles necessary, and the toll for passing is\r\nfour shillings or a dollar in a carriage, and one shilling on foot.\r\nAs the greater variety of prospect can be had on the American side,\r\nas the island between the two falls is approachable from the American\r\nside and not from the Canadian, and as it is in this island that\r\nvisitors will best love to linger and learn to measure in their\r\nminds the vast triumph of waters before them, I recommend such of my\r\nreaders as can trust a little,--it need be but a little,--to their\r\nown legs to select their hotel at Niagara Falls town.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that it matters much from what point the falls are\r\nfirst seen, but to this I demur. It matters, I think, very little,\r\nor not at all. Let the visitor first see it all, and learn the\r\nwhereabouts of every point, so as to understand his own position and\r\nthat of the waters; and then having done that in the way of business\r\nlet him proceed to enjoyment. I doubt whether it be not the best to\r\ndo this with all sight seeing. I am quite sure that it is the way in\r\nwhich acquaintance may be best and most pleasantly made with a new\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe falls are, as I have said, made by a sudden breach in the level\r\nof the river. All cataracts are, I presume, made by such breaches;\r\nbut generally the waters do not fall precipitously as they do at\r\nNiagara, and never elsewhere, as far as the world yet knows, has a\r\nbreach so sudden been made in a river carrying in its channel such\r\nor any approach to such a body of water. Up above the falls, for\r\nmore than a mile, the waters leap and burst over rapids, as though\r\nconscious of the destiny that awaits them. Here the river is very\r\nbroad, and comparatively shallow, but from shore to shore it frets\r\nitself into little torrents, and begins to assume the majesty of its\r\npower. Looking at it even here, in the expanse which forms itself\r\nover the greater fall, one feels sure that no strongest swimmer\r\ncould have a chance of saving himself, if fate had cast him in even\r\namong those petty whirlpools. The waters, though so broken in their\r\ndescent, are deliciously green. This colour as seen early in the\r\nmorning, or just as the sun has set, is so bright as to give to the\r\nplace one of its chiefest charms.\r\n\r\nThis will be best seen from the further end of the island,--Goat\r\nIsland, as it is called,--which, as the reader will understand,\r\ndivides the river immediately above the falls. Indeed the island is a\r\npart of that precipitously broken ledge over which the river tumbles;\r\nand no doubt in process of time will be worn away and covered with\r\nwater. The time, however, will be very long. In the meanwhile it is\r\nperhaps a mile round, and is covered thickly with timber. At the\r\nupper end of the island the waters are divided, and coming down in\r\ntwo courses, each over its own rapids, form two separate falls. The\r\nbridge by which the island is entered is a hundred yards or more\r\nabove the smaller fall. The waters here have been turned by the\r\nisland, and make their leap into the body of the river below at a\r\nright angle with it,--about two hundred yards below the greater fall.\r\nTaken alone this smaller cataract would, I imagine, be the heaviest\r\nfall of water known, but taken in conjunction with the other it is\r\nterribly shorn of its majesty. The waters here are not green as they\r\nare at the larger cataract, and though the ledge has been hollowed\r\nand bowed by them so as to form a curve, that curve does not deepen\r\nitself into a vast abyss as it does at the horseshoe up above. This\r\nsmaller fall is again divided, and the visitor passing down a flight\r\nof steps and over a frail wooden bridge finds himself on a smaller\r\nisland in the midst of it.\r\n\r\nBut we will go at once on to the glory, and the thunder, and the\r\nmajesty, and the wrath of that upper hell of waters. We are still,\r\nlet the reader remember, on Goat Island, still in the States, and\r\non what is called the American side of the main body of the river.\r\nAdvancing beyond the path leading down to the lesser fall, we come to\r\nthat point of the island at which the waters of the main river begin\r\nto descend. From hence across to the Canadian side the cataract\r\ncontinues itself in one unabated line. But the line is very far from\r\nbeing direct or straight. After stretching for some little way from\r\nthe shore, to a point in the river which is reached by a wooden\r\nbridge at the end of which stands a tower upon the rock,--after\r\nstretching to this, the line of the ledge bends inwards against the\r\nflood,--in, and in, and in till one is led to think that the depth\r\nof that horseshoe is immeasurable. It has been cut with no stinting\r\nhand. A monstrous cantle has been worn back out of the centre of the\r\nrock, so that the fury of the waters converges, and the spectator as\r\nhe gazes into the hollow with wishful eyes fancies that he can hardly\r\ntrace out the centre of the abyss.\r\n\r\nGo down to the end of that wooden bridge, seat yourself on the rail,\r\nand there sit till all the outer world is lost to you. There is no\r\ngrander spot about Niagara than this. The waters are absolutely\r\naround you. If you have that power of eye-control which is so\r\nnecessary to the full enjoyment of scenery you will see nothing but\r\nthe water. You will certainly hear nothing else; and the sound, I beg\r\nyou to remember, is not an ear-cracking, agonizing crash and clang of\r\nnoises; but is melodious, and soft withal, though loud as thunder. It\r\nfills your ears, and as it were envelopes them, but at the same time\r\nyou can speak to your neighbour without an effort. But at this place,\r\nand in these moments, the less of speaking I should say the better.\r\nThere is no grander spot than this. Here, seated on the rail of the\r\nbridge, you will not see the whole depth of the fall. In looking at\r\nthe grandest works of nature, and of art too, I fancy, it is never\r\nwell to see all. There should be something left to the imagination,\r\nand much should be half concealed in mystery. The greatest charm of a\r\nmountain range is the wild feeling that there must be strange unknown\r\ndesolate worlds in those far-off valleys beyond. And so here, at\r\nNiagara, that converging rush of waters may fall down, down at once\r\ninto a hell of rivers for what the eye can see. It is glorious to\r\nwatch them in their first curve over the rocks. They come green\r\nas a bank of emeralds; but with a fitful flying colour, as though\r\nconscious that in one moment more they would be dashed into spray and\r\nrise into air, pale as driven snow. The vapour rises high into the\r\nair, and is gathered there, visible always as a permanent white cloud\r\nover the cataract; but the bulk of the spray which fills the lower\r\nhollow of that horse-shoe is like a tumult of snow. This you will\r\nnot fully see from your seat on the rail. The head of it rises ever\r\nand anon out of that caldron below, but the caldron itself will be\r\ninvisible. It is ever so far down,--far as your own imagination can\r\nsink it. But your eyes will rest full upon the curve of the waters.\r\nThe shape you will be looking at is that of a horse-shoe, but of\r\na horse-shoe miraculously deep from toe to heel;--and this depth\r\nbecomes greater as you sit there. That which at first was only great\r\nand beautiful, becomes gigantic and sublime till the mind is at loss\r\nto find an epithet for its own use. To realize Niagara you must sit\r\nthere till you see nothing else than that which you have come to see.\r\nYou will hear nothing else, and think of nothing else. At length you\r\nwill be at one with the tumbling river before you. You will find\r\nyourself among the waters as though you belonged to them. The cool\r\nliquid green will run through your veins, and the voice of the\r\ncataract will be the expression of your own heart. You will fall as\r\nthe bright waters fall, rushing down into your new world with no\r\nhesitation and with no dismay; and you will rise again as the spray\r\nrises, bright, beautiful, and pure. Then you will flow away in your\r\ncourse to the uncompassed, distant, and eternal ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen this state has been reached and has passed away you may get off\r\nyour rail and mount the tower. I do not quite approve of that tower,\r\nseeing that it has about it a gingerbread air, and reminds one of\r\nthose well-arranged scenes of romance in which one is told that on\r\nthe left you turn to the lady's bower, price sixpence; and on the\r\nright ascend to the knight's bed, price sixpence more, with a view\r\nof the hermit's tomb thrown in. But nevertheless the tower is worth\r\nmounting, and no money is charged for the use of it. It is not very\r\nhigh, and there is a balcony at the top on which some half dozen\r\npersons may stand at ease. Here the mystery is lost, but the whole\r\nfall is seen. It is not even at this spot brought so fully before\r\nyour eye,--made to show itself in so complete and entire a shape,\r\nas it will do when you come to stand near to it on the opposite or\r\nCanadian shore. But I think that it shows itself more beautifully.\r\nAnd the form of the cataract is such, that, here in Goat Island,\r\non the American side, no spray will reach you, although you are\r\nabsolutely over the waters. But on the Canadian side, the road as it\r\napproaches the fall is wet and rotten with spray, and you, as you\r\nstand close upon the edge, will be wet also. The rainbows as they are\r\nseen through the rising cloud--for the sun's rays as seen through\r\nthese waters show themselves in a bow as they do when seen through\r\nrain,--are pretty enough, and are greatly loved. For myself I do\r\nnot care for this prettiness at Niagara. It is there, but I forget\r\nit,--and do not mind how soon it is forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut we are still on the tower; and here I must declare that though\r\nI forgive the tower, I cannot forgive the horrid obelisk which has\r\nlatterly been built opposite to it, on the Canadian side, up above\r\nthe fall; built apparently,--for I did not go to it,--with some\r\ncamera obscura intention for which the projector deserves to be put\r\nin Coventry by all good Christian men and women. At such a place as\r\nNiagara tasteless buildings, run up in wrong places with a view to\r\nmoney making, are perhaps necessary evils. It may be that they are\r\nnot evils at all;--that they give more pleasure than pain, seeing\r\nthat they tend to the enjoyment of the multitude. But there are\r\nedifices of this description which cry aloud to the gods by the force\r\nof their own ugliness and malposition. As to such it may be said that\r\nthere should somewhere exist a power capable of crushing them in\r\ntheir birth. This new obelisk or picture-building at Niagara is one\r\nof such.\r\n\r\nAnd now we will cross the water, and with this object will return by\r\nthe bridge out of Goat Island on the main land of the American side.\r\nBut as we do so let me say that one of the great charms of Niagara\r\nconsists in this,--that over and above that one great object of\r\nwonder and beauty, there is so much little loveliness;--loveliness\r\nespecially of water I mean. There are little rivulets running here\r\nand there over little falls, with pendent boughs above them, and\r\nstones shining under their shallow depths. As the visitor stands and\r\nlooks through the trees the rapids glitter before him, and then hide\r\nthemselves behind islands. They glitter and sparkle in far distances\r\nunder the bright foliage till the remembrance is lost, and one\r\nknows not which way they run. And then the river below, with its\r\nwhirlpool;--but we shall come to that by-and-by, and to the mad\r\nvoyage which was made down the rapids by that mad captain who ran the\r\ngauntlet of the waters at the risk of his own life, with fifty to one\r\nagainst him, in order that he might save another man's property from\r\nthe Sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe readiest way across to Canada is by the ferry; and on the\r\nAmerican side this is very pleasantly done. You go into a little\r\nhouse, pay 20 cents, take a seat on a wooden car of wonderful shape,\r\nand on the touch of a spring find yourself travelling down an\r\ninclined plane of terrible declivity and at a very fast rate. You\r\ncatch a glance of the river below you, and recognize the fact that\r\nif the rope by which you are held should break, you would go down at\r\na very fast rate indeed,--and find your final resting place in the\r\nriver. As I have gone down some dozen times and have come to no such\r\ngrief, I will not presume that you will be less lucky. Below there is\r\na boat generally ready. If it be not there, the place is not chosen\r\namiss for a rest of ten minutes, for the lesser fall is close at\r\nhand, and the larger one is in full view. Looking at the rapidity\r\nof the river you will think that the passage must be dangerous and\r\ndifficult. But no accidents ever happen, and the lad who takes you\r\nover seems to do it with sufficient ease. The walk up the hill on\r\nthe other side is another thing. It is very steep, and for those who\r\nhave not good locomotive power of their own, will be found to be\r\ndisagreeable. In the full season, however, carriages are generally\r\nwaiting there. In so short a distance I have always been ashamed to\r\ntrust to other legs than my own, but I have observed that Americans\r\nare always dragged up. I have seen single young men of from eighteen\r\nto twenty-five, from whose outward appearance no story of idle\r\nluxurious life can be read, carried about alone in carriages over\r\ndistances which would be counted as nothing by any healthy English\r\nlady of fifty. None but the old and invalids should require the\r\nassistance of carriages in seeing Niagara, but the trade in carriages\r\nis to all appearance the most brisk trade there.\r\n\r\nHaving mounted the hill on the Canada side you will walk on towards\r\nthe falls. As I have said before, you will from this side look\r\ndirectly into the full circle of the upper cataract, while you will\r\nhave before you at your left hand the whole expanse of the lesser\r\nfall. For those who desire to see all at a glance, who wish to\r\ncomprise the whole with their eyes, and to leave nothing to be\r\nguessed, nothing to be surmised, this, no doubt, is the best point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nYou will be covered with spray as you walk up to the ledge of rocks,\r\nbut I do not think that the spray will hurt you. If a man gets wet\r\nthrough going to his daily work, cold, catarrh, cough, and all their\r\nattendant evils may be expected; but these maladies usually spare\r\nthe tourist. Change of air, plenty of air, excellence of air, and\r\nincreased exercise make these things powerless. I should therefore\r\nbid you disregard the spray. If, however, you are yourself of a\r\ndifferent opinion, you may hire a suit of oil-cloth clothes for, I\r\nbelieve, a quarter of a dollar. They are nasty of course, and have\r\nthis further disadvantage, that you become much more wet having them\r\non than you would be without them.\r\n\r\nHere, on this side, you walk on to the very edge of the cataract,\r\nand, if your tread be steady and your legs firm, you dip your foot\r\ninto the water exactly at the spot where the thin outside margin of\r\nthe current reaches the rocky edge and jumps to join the mass of the\r\nfall. The bed of white foam beneath is certainly seen better here\r\nthan elsewhere, and the green curve of the water is as bright here as\r\nwhen seen from the wooden rail across. But nevertheless I say again\r\nthat that wooden rail is the one point from whence Niagara may be\r\nbest seen aright.\r\n\r\nClose to the cataract, exactly at the spot from whence in former days\r\nthe Table Rock used to project from the land over the boiling caldron\r\nbelow, there is now a shaft down which you will descend to the level\r\nof the river, and pass between the rock and the torrent. This Table\r\nRock broke away from the cliff and fell, as up the whole course of\r\nthe river the seceding rocks have split and fallen from time to time\r\nthrough countless years, and will continue to do till the bed of\r\nthe upper lake is reached. You will descend this shaft, taking to\r\nyourself or not taking to yourself a suit of oil-clothes as you\r\nmay think best. I have gone with and without the suit, and again\r\nrecommend that they be left behind. I am inclined to think that\r\nthe ordinary payment should be made for their use, as otherwise it\r\nwill appear to those whose trade it is to prepare them that you are\r\ninjuring them in their vested rights.\r\n\r\nSome three years since I visited Niagara on my way back to England\r\nfrom Bermuda, and in a volume of travels which I then published I\r\nendeavoured to explain the impression made upon me by this passage\r\nbetween the rock and the waterfall. An author should not quote\r\nhimself; but as I feel myself bound, in writing a chapter specially\r\nabout Niagara, to give some account of this strange position, I will\r\nventure to repeat my own words.\r\n\r\nIn the spot to which I allude the visitor stands on a broad safe\r\npath, made of shingles, between the rock over which the water rushes\r\nand the rushing water. He will go in so far that the spray rising\r\nback from the bed of the torrent does not incommode him. With this\r\nexception, the further he can go in the better; but circumstances\r\nwill clearly show him the spot to which he should advance. Unless\r\nthe water be driven in by a very strong wind, five yards make the\r\ndifference between a comparatively dry coat and an absolutely wet\r\none. And then let him stand with his back to the entrance, thus\r\nhiding the last glimmer of the expiring day. So standing he will look\r\nup among the falling waters, or down into the deep misty pit, from\r\nwhich they reascend in almost as palpable a bulk. The rock will be\r\nat his right hand, high and hard, and dark and straight, like the\r\nwall of some huge cavern, such as children enter in their dreams.\r\nFor the first five minutes he will be looking but at the waters of a\r\ncataract,--at the waters, indeed, of such a cataract as we know no\r\nother, and at their interior curves which elsewhere we cannot see.\r\nBut by-and-by all this will change. He will no longer be on a shingly\r\npath beneath a waterfall; but that feeling of a cavern wall will grow\r\nupon him, of a cavern deep, below roaring seas, in which the waves\r\nare there, though they do not enter in upon him; or rather not the\r\nwaves, but the very bowels of the ocean. He will feel as though the\r\nfloods surrounded him, coming and going with their wild sounds, and\r\nhe will hardly recognize that though among them he is not in them.\r\nAnd they, as they fall with a continual roar, not hurting the ear,\r\nbut musical withal, will seem to move as the vast ocean waters may\r\nperhaps move in their internal currents. He will lose the sense of\r\none continued descent, and think that they are passing round him in\r\ntheir appointed courses. The broken spray that rises from the depth\r\nbelow, rises so strongly, so palpably, so rapidly, that the motion in\r\nevery direction will seem equal. And, as he looks on, strange colours\r\nwill show themselves through the mist; the shades of grey will become\r\ngreen or blue, with ever and anon a flash of white; and then, when\r\nsome gust of wind blows in with greater violence, the sea-girt cavern\r\nwill become all dark and black. Oh, my friend, let there be no one\r\nthere to speak to thee then; no, not even a brother. As you stand\r\nthere speak only to the waters.\r\n\r\nTwo miles below the falls the river is crossed by a suspension bridge\r\nof marvellous construction. It affords two thoroughfares, one above\r\nthe other. The lower road is for carriages and horses, and the upper\r\none bears a railway belonging to the Great Western Canada line. The\r\nview from hence both up and down the river is very beautiful, for the\r\nbridge is built immediately over the first of a series of rapids. One\r\nmile below the bridge these rapids end in a broad basin called the\r\nwhirlpool, and, issuing out of this, the current turns to the right\r\nthrough a narrow channel overhung by cliffs and trees, and then makes\r\nits way down to Lake Ontario with comparative tranquillity.\r\n\r\nBut I will beg you to take notice of those rapids from the bridge and\r\nto ask yourself what chance of life would remain to any ship, craft,\r\nor boat required by destiny to undergo navigation beneath the bridge\r\nand down into that whirlpool. Heretofore all men would have said\r\nthat no chance of life could remain to so ill-starred a bark. The\r\nnavigation, however, has been effected. But men used to the river\r\nstill say that the chances would be fifty to one against any vessel\r\nwhich should attempt to repeat the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe story of that wondrous voyage was as follows. A small steamer\r\ncalled the Maid of the Mist was built upon the river, between the\r\nfalls and the rapids, and was used for taking adventurous tourists up\r\namidst the spray, as near to the cataract as was possible. The Maid\r\nof the Mist plied in this way for a year or two, and was, I believe,\r\nmuch patronized during the season. But in the early part of last\r\nsummer an evil time had come. Either the Maid got into debt, or her\r\nowner had embarked in other and less profitable speculations. At any\r\nrate he became subject to the law, and tidings reached him that the\r\nSheriff would seize the Maid. On most occasions the Sheriff is bound\r\nto keep such intentions secret, seeing that property is moveable,\r\nand that an insolvent debtor will not always await the officers of\r\njustice. But with the poor Maid there was no need of such secresy.\r\nThere was but a mile or so of water on which she could ply, and she\r\nwas forbidden by the nature of her properties to make any way upon\r\nland. The Sheriff's prey therefore was easy and the poor Maid was\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nIn any country in the world but America such would have been the\r\ncase, but an American would steam down Phlegethon to save his\r\nproperty from the Sheriff; he would steam down Phlegethon or get some\r\none else to do it for him. Whether or no in this case the captain of\r\nthe boat was the proprietor, or whether, as I was told, he was paid\r\nfor the job, I do not know; but he determined to run the rapids, and\r\nhe procured two others to accompany him in the risk. He got up his\r\nsteam, and took the Maid up amidst the spray according to his custom.\r\nThen suddenly turning on his course, he with one of his companions\r\nfixed himself at the wheel, while the other remained at his engine.\r\nI wish I could look into the mind of that man and understand what his\r\nthoughts were at that moment; what were his thoughts and what his\r\nbeliefs. As to one of the men I was told that he was carried down,\r\nnot knowing what he was about to do, but I am inclined to believe\r\nthat all the three were joined together in the attempt.\r\n\r\nI was told by a man who saw the boat pass under the bridge, that she\r\nmade one long leap down as she came thither, that her funnel was at\r\nonce knocked flat on the deck by the force of the blow, that the\r\nwaters covered her from stem to stern, and that then she rose again\r\nand skimmed into the whirlpool a mile below. When there she rode with\r\ncomparative ease upon the waters, and took the sharp turn round into\r\nthe river below without a struggle. The feat was done, and the Maid\r\nwas rescued from the Sheriff. It is said that she was sold below at\r\nthe mouth of the river, and carried from thence over Lake Ontario and\r\ndown the St. Lawrence to Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNORTH AND WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Niagara we determined to proceed north-west; as far to the\r\nnorth-west as we could go with any reasonable hope of finding\r\nAmerican citizens in a state of political civilization, and perhaps\r\nguided also in some measure by our hopes as to hotel accommodation.\r\nLooking to these two matters we resolved to get across to the\r\nMississippi, and to go up that river as far as the town of St. Paul\r\nand the falls of St. Anthony, which are some twelve miles above the\r\ntown; then to descend the river as far as the States of Iowa on\r\nthe west and Illinois on the east; and to return eastwards through\r\nChicago and the large cities on the southern shores of Lake Erie,\r\nfrom whence we would go across to Albany, the capital of New York\r\nState, and down the Hudson to New York, the capital of the Western\r\nworld. For such a journey, in which scenery was one great object,\r\nwe were rather late, as we did not leave Niagara till the 10th of\r\nOctober; but though the winters are extremely cold through all this\r\nportion of the American continent--15, 20, and even 25 degrees below\r\nzero being an ordinary state of the atmosphere in latitudes equal\r\nto those of Florence, Nice, and Turin--nevertheless the autumns are\r\nmild, the noon day being always warm, and the colours of the foliage\r\nare then in all their glory. I was also very anxious to ascertain,\r\nif it might be in my power to do so, with what spirit or true feeling\r\nas to the matter, the work of recruiting for the now enormous army\r\nof the States was going on in those remote regions. That men should\r\nbe on fire in Boston and New York, in Philadelphia, and along the\r\nborders of secession, I could understand. I could understand also\r\nthat they should be on fire throughout the cotton, sugar, and rice\r\nplantations of the South. But I could hardly understand that this\r\npolitical fervour should have communicated itself to the far-off\r\nfarmers who had thinly spread themselves over the enormous\r\nwheat-growing districts of the North-West. St. Paul, the capital\r\nof Minnesota, is 900 miles directly north of St. Louis, the most\r\nnorthern point to which slavery extends in the Western States of the\r\nUnion, and the farming lands of Minnesota stretch away again for some\r\nhundreds of miles north and west of St. Paul. Could it be that those\r\nscanty and far-off pioneers of agriculture, those frontier farmers\r\nwho are nearly one half German and nearly the other half Irish, would\r\ndesert their clearings and ruin their chances of progress in the\r\nworld for distant wars of which the causes must, as I thought, be\r\nto them unintelligible? I had been told that distance had but lent\r\nenchantment to the view, and that the war was even more popular in\r\nthe remote and newly settled States than in those which have been\r\nlonger known as great political bodies. So I resolved that I would go\r\nand see.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to explain here that that great political Union\r\nhitherto called the United States of America may be more properly\r\ndivided into three than into two distinct interests. In England we\r\nhave long heard of North and South as pitted against each other, and\r\nwe have always understood that the southern politicians or democrats\r\nhave prevailed over the northern politicians or republicans, because\r\nthey were assisted in their views by northern men of mark who have\r\nheld southern principles;--that is, by northern men who have been\r\nwilling to obtain political power by joining themselves to the\r\nsouthern party. That as far as I can understand has been the general\r\nidea in England, and in a broad way it has been true. But as years\r\nhave advanced and as the States have extended themselves westward, a\r\nthird large party has been formed, which sometimes rejoices to call\r\nitself The Great West; and though at the present time the West and\r\nthe North are joined together against the South, the interests of the\r\nNorth and the West are not, I think, more closely interwoven than are\r\nthose of the West and South; and when the final settlement of this\r\nquestion shall be made, there will doubtless be great difficulty in\r\nsatisfying the different aspirations and feelings of two great free\r\nsoil populations. The North, I think, will ultimately perceive that\r\nit will gain much by the secession of the South; but it will be very\r\ndifficult to make the West believe that secession will suit its\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nI will attempt in a rough way to divide the States, as they seem to\r\ndivide themselves, into these three parties. As to the majority of\r\nthem there is no difficulty in locating them; but this cannot be done\r\nwith absolute certainty as to some few that lie on the borders.\r\n\r\nNew England consists of six States, of which all of course belong\r\nto the North. They are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, and Connecticut; the six States which should be most\r\ndear to England, and in which the political success of the United\r\nStates as a nation is to my eyes the most apparent. But even in them\r\nthere was till quite of late a strong section so opposed to the\r\nrepublican party as to give a material aid to the South. This, I\r\nthink, was particularly so in New Hampshire, from whence President\r\nPierce came. He had been one of the senators from New Hampshire; and\r\nyet to him, as President, is affixed the disgrace,--whether truly\r\naffixed or not I do not say,--of having first used his power in\r\nsecretly organizing those arrangements which led to secession and\r\nassisted at its birth. In Massachusetts also itself there was a\r\nstrong democratic party, of which Massachusetts now seems to be\r\nsomewhat ashamed. Then, to make up the North, must be added the two\r\ngreat States of New York and Pennsylvania, and the small State of New\r\nJersey. The West will not agree even to this absolutely, seeing that\r\nthey claim all territory west of the Alleghenies, and that a portion\r\nof Pennsylvania, and some part also of New York lie westward of\r\nthat range; but in endeavouring to make these divisions ordinarily\r\nintelligible I may say that the North consists of the nine States\r\nabove named. But the North will also claim Maryland and Delaware, and\r\nthe eastern half of Virginia. The North will claim them though they\r\nare attached to the South by joint participation in the great social\r\ninstitution of slavery, for Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia are\r\nslave States;--and I think that the North will ultimately make good\r\nits claim. Maryland and Delaware lie, as it were, behind the capital,\r\nand Eastern Virginia is close upon the capital. And these regions are\r\nnot tropical in their climate or influences. They are and have been\r\nslave States; but will probably rid themselves of that taint and\r\nbecome a portion of the free North.\r\n\r\nThe southern or slave States, properly so called, are easily defined.\r\nThey are Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,\r\nGeorgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The South will also\r\nclaim Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, Delaware, and\r\nMaryland, and will endeavour to prove its right to the claim by the\r\nfact of the social institution being the law of the land in those\r\nStates. Of Delaware, Maryland, and Eastern Virginia, I have already\r\nspoken. Western Virginia is, I think, so little tainted with slavery,\r\nthat, as she stands even at present, she properly belongs to the\r\nWest. As I now write the struggle is going on in Kentucky and\r\nMissouri. In Missouri the slave population is barely more than a\r\ntenth of the whole, while in South Carolina and Mississippi it is\r\nmore than half. And, therefore, I venture to count Missouri among the\r\nwestern States, although slavery is still the law of the land within\r\nits borders. It is surrounded on three sides by free States of the\r\nWest, and its soil, let us hope, must become free. Kentucky I must\r\nleave as doubtful, though I am inclined to believe that slavery will\r\nbe abolished there also. Kentucky at any rate will never throw in its\r\nlot with the southern States. As to Tennessee, it seceded heart and\r\nsoul, and I fear that it must be accounted as southern, although the\r\nnorthern army has now, in May 1862, possessed itself of the greater\r\npart of the State.\r\n\r\nTo the great West remains an enormous territory, of which, however,\r\nthe population is as yet but scanty; though perhaps no portion of\r\nthe world has increased so fast in population as have these western\r\nStates. The list is as follows: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,--to which I would add Missouri,\r\nand probably the western half of Virginia. We have then to account\r\nfor the two already admitted States on the Pacific, California and\r\nOregon, and also for the unadmitted Territories, Dacotah, Nebraska,\r\nWashington, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Neveda. I should be\r\nrefining too much for my present very general purpose, if I were to\r\nattempt to marshal these huge but thinly populated regions in either\r\nrank. Of California and Oregon it may probably be said that it is\r\ntheir ambition to form themselves into a separate division;--a\r\ndivision which may be called the further West.\r\n\r\nI know that all statistical statements are tedious, and I believe\r\nthat but few readers believe them. I will, however, venture to give\r\nthe populations of these States in the order I have named them,\r\nseeing that power in America depends almost entirely on population.\r\nThe census of 1860 gave the following results:--\r\n\r\nIn the North.\r\n\r\n   Maine             619,000\r\n   New Hampshire     326,872\r\n   Vermont           325,827\r\n   Massachusetts   1,231,494\r\n   Rhode Island      174,621\r\n   Connecticut       460,670\r\n   New York        3,851,563\r\n   Pennsylvania    2,916,018\r\n   New Jersey        676,034\r\n                  ----------\r\n      Total       10,582,099\r\n\r\nIn the South--the population of which must be divided into free and\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n                      FREE.

The South claims all the slave States, and\r\nwould point to secession in Virginia to justify such claim,--and\r\nwould point also to Maryland and Baltimore, declaring that secession\r\nwould be as strong there as at New Orleans, if secession were\r\npracticable. Maryland and Baltimore lie behind Washington, and are\r\nunder the heels of the northern troops, so that secession is not\r\npracticable; but the South would say that they have seceded in heart.\r\nIn this the South would have some show of reason for its assertion;\r\nbut, nevertheless, I shall best convey a true idea of the position of\r\nthese States by classing them as doubtful. When secession shall have\r\nbeen accomplished,--if ever it be accomplished,--it will hardly be\r\npossible that they should adhere to the South.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the above tables that the population of the West\r\nis nearly equal to that of the North, and that therefore western\r\npower is almost as great as northern. It is almost as great already,\r\nand as population in the West increases faster than it does in the\r\nNorth, the two will soon be equalized. They are already sufficiently\r\non a par to enable them to fight on equal terms, and they will be\r\nprepared for fighting--political fighting, if no other--as soon as\r\nthey have established their supremacy over a common enemy.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am on the subject of population, I should explain--though\r\nthe point is not one which concerns the present argument--that the\r\nnumbers given, as they regard the South, include both the whites and\r\nthe blacks, the free men and the slaves. The political power of the\r\nSouth is of course in the hands of the white race only, and the total\r\nwhite population should therefore be taken as the number indicating\r\nthe southern power. The political power of the South, however, as\r\ncontrasted with that of the North, has, since the commencement of the\r\nUnion, been much increased by the slave population. The slaves have\r\nbeen taken into account in determining the number of representatives\r\nwhich should be sent to Congress by each State. That number depends\r\non the population, but it was decided in 1787, that in counting up\r\nthe number of representatives to which each State should be held to\r\nbe entitled, five slaves should represent three white men. A Southern\r\npopulation, therefore, of five thousand free men and five thousand\r\nslaves would claim as many representatives as a Northern population\r\nof eight thousand free men, although the voting would be confined to\r\nthe free population. This has ever since been the law of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe western power is nearly equal to that of the North, and this\r\nfact, somewhat exaggerated in terms, is a frequent boast in the\r\nmouths of western men. \"We ran Fremont for President,\" they say, \"and\r\nhad it not been for northern men with southern principles, we should\r\nhave put him in the White House instead of the traitor Buchanan. If\r\nthat had been done, there would have been no secession.\" How things\r\nmight have gone had Fremont been elected in lieu of Buchanan, I\r\nwill not pretend to say; but the nature of the argument shows the\r\ndifference that exists between northern and western feeling. At the\r\ntime that I was in the West, General Fremont was the great topic of\r\npublic interest. Every newspaper was discussing his conduct, his\r\nability as a soldier, his energy, and his fate. At that time General\r\nMaclellan was in command at Washington on the Potomac, it being\r\nunderstood that he held his power directly under the President,--free\r\nfrom the exercise of control on the part of the veteran General\r\nScott, though at that time General Scott had not actually resigned\r\nhis position as head of the army. And General Fremont, who some five\r\nyears before had been \"run\" for President by the Western States, held\r\nanother command of nearly equal independence in Missouri. He had been\r\nput over General Lyon in the western command, and directly after\r\nthis General Lyon had fallen in battle at Springfield, in the first\r\naction in which the opposing armies were engaged in the West. General\r\nFremont at once proceeded to carry matters with a very high hand.\r\nOn the 30th of August, 1861, he issued a proclamation by which he\r\ndeclared martial law at St. Louis, the city at which he held his head\r\nquarters, and indeed throughout the State of Missouri generally. In\r\nthis proclamation he declared his intention of exercising a severity\r\nbeyond that ever threatened, as I believe, in modern warfare. He\r\ndefines the region presumed to be held by his army of occupation,\r\ndrawing his lines across the State, and then declares \"that all\r\npersons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within those\r\nlines shall be tried by Court Martial, and if found guilty will\r\nbe shot.\" He then goes on to say that he will confiscate all the\r\nproperty of persons in the State who shall have taken up arms against\r\nthe Union, or who shall have taken part with the enemies of the\r\nUnion, and that he will make free all slaves belonging to such\r\npersons. This proclamation was not approved at Washington, and was\r\nmodified by the order of the President. It was understood also that\r\nhe issued orders for military expenditure, which were not recognized\r\nat Washington, and men began to understand that the army in the West\r\nwas gradually assuming that irresponsible military position, which\r\nin disturbed countries and in times of civil war has so frequently\r\nresulted in a military dictatorship. Then there arose a clamour\r\nfor the removal of General Fremont. A semi-official account of his\r\nproceedings, which had reached Washington from an officer under his\r\ncommand, was made public; and also the correspondence which took\r\nplace on the subject between the President and General Fremont's\r\nwife. The officer in question was thereupon placed under arrest, but\r\nimmediately released by orders from Washington. He then made official\r\ncomplaint of his General, sending forward a list of charges in which\r\nFremont was accused of rashness, incompetency, want of fidelity of\r\nthe interests of the Government, and disobedience to orders from\r\nhead quarters. After a while the Secretary of War himself proceeded\r\nfrom Washington to the quarters of General Fremont at St. Louis, and\r\nremained there for a day or two, making or pretending to make inquiry\r\ninto the matter. But when he returned he left the General still in\r\ncommand. During the whole month of October the papers were occupied\r\nin declaring in the morning that General Fremont had been recalled\r\nfrom his command, and in the evening that he was to remain. In the\r\nmean time they who befriended his cause, and this included the whole\r\nWest, were hoping from day to day that he would settle the matter\r\nfor himself and silence his accusers, by some great military success.\r\nGeneral Price held the command opposed to him, and men said that\r\nFremont would sweep General Price and his army down the valley of the\r\nMississippi into the sea. But General Price would not be so swept,\r\nand it began to appear that a guerilla warfare would prevail; that\r\nGeneral Price, if driven southwards, would reappear behind the backs\r\nof his pursuers, and that General Fremont would not accomplish all\r\nthat was expected of him with that rapidity for which his friends had\r\ngiven him credit. So the newspapers still went on waging the war, and\r\nevery morning General Fremont was recalled, and every evening they\r\nwho had recalled him were shown up as having known nothing of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; he is a pioneer man, and will do a'most anything he puts\r\nhis hand to,\" his friends in the West still said. \"He understands the\r\nfrontier.\" Understanding the frontier is a great thing in Western\r\nAmerica, across which the vanguard of civilization continues to march\r\non in advance from year to year. \"And it's he that is bound to sweep\r\nslavery from off the face of this Continent. He's the man, and he's\r\nabout the only man.\" I am not qualified to write the life of General\r\nFremont, and can at present only make this slight reference to the\r\ndetails of his romantic career. That it has been full of romance,\r\nand that the man himself is indued with a singular energy and a high\r\nromantic idea of what may be done by power and will, there is no\r\ndoubt. Five times he has crossed the continent of North America\r\nfrom Missouri to Oregon and California, enduring great hardships in\r\nthe service of advancing civilization and knowledge. That he has\r\nconsiderable talent, immense energy, and strong self-confidence,\r\nI believe. He is a frontier man; one of those who care nothing for\r\ndanger, and who would dare anything with the hope of accomplishing a\r\ngreat career. But I have never heard that he has shown any practical\r\nknowledge of high military matters. It may be doubted whether a man\r\nof this stamp is well fitted to hold the command of a nation's army\r\nfor great national purposes. May it not even be presumed that a man\r\nof this class is of all men the least fitted for such a work? The\r\nofficer required should be a man with two specialities--a speciality\r\nfor military tactics, and a speciality for national duty. The army\r\nin the West was far removed from head quarters in Washington, and\r\nit was peculiarly desirable that the General commanding it should\r\nbe one possessing a strong idea of obedience to the control of his\r\nown Government. Those frontier capabilities, that self-dependent\r\nenergy for which his friends gave Fremont,--and probably justly gave\r\nhim,--such unlimited credit are exactly the qualities which are most\r\ndangerous in such a position.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to explain the circumstances of the Western\r\ncommand in Missouri, as they existed at the time when I was in the\r\nNorth-Western States, in order that the double action of the North\r\nand West may be understood. I, of course, was not in the secret\r\nof any official persons, but I could not but feel sure that the\r\nGovernment in Washington would have been glad to have removed Fremont\r\nat once from the command, had they not feared that by doing so they\r\nwould have created a schism, as it were, in their own camp, and have\r\ndone much to break up the integrity or oneness of Northern loyalty.\r\nThe western people almost to a man desired abolition. The States\r\nthere were sending out their tens of thousands of young men into\r\nthe army with a prodigality as to their only source of wealth which\r\nthey hardly recognized themselves, because this to them was a fight\r\nagainst slavery. The western population has been increased to a\r\nwonderful degree by a German infusion;--so much so that the western\r\ntowns appear to have been peopled with Germans. I found regiments\r\nof volunteers consisting wholly of Germans. And the Germans are all\r\nabolitionists. To all the men of the West the name of Fremont is\r\ndear. He is their hero, and their Hercules. He is to cleanse the\r\nstables of the southern king, and turn the waters of emancipation\r\nthrough the foul stalls of slavery. And, therefore, though the\r\nCabinet in Washington would have been glad for many reasons to\r\nhave removed Fremont in October last, it was at first scared from\r\ncommitting itself to so strong a measure. At last, however, the\r\ncharges made against him were too fully substantiated to allow of\r\ntheir being set on one side, and early in November, 1861, he was\r\nsuperseded. I shall be obliged to allude again to General Fremont's\r\ncareer as I go on with my narrative.\r\n\r\nAt this time the North was looking for a victory on the Potomac; but\r\nthey were no longer looking for it with that impatience which in the\r\nsummer had led to the disgrace at Bull's Run. They had recognized the\r\nfact that their troops must be equipped, drilled, and instructed; and\r\nthey had also recognized the perhaps greater fact, that their enemies\r\nwere neither weak, cowardly, nor badly officered. I have always\r\nthought that the tone and manner with which the North bore the defeat\r\nat Bull's Run was creditable to it. It was never denied, never\r\nexplained away, never set down as trifling. \"We have been whipped!\"\r\nwas what all Northerners said,--\"We've got an almighty whipping, and\r\nhere we are.\" I have heard many Englishmen complain of this, saying\r\nthat the matter was taken almost as a joke,--that no disgrace was\r\nfelt, and the licking was owned by a people who ought never to have\r\nallowed that they had been licked. To all this, however, I demur.\r\nTheir only chance of speedy success consisted in their seeing and\r\nrecognizing the truth. Had they confessed the whipping and then sat\r\ndown with their hands in their pockets,--had they done as second-rate\r\nboys at school will do,--declare that they had been licked, and then\r\nfeel that all the trouble is over,--they would indeed have been open\r\nto reproach. The old mother across the water would in such case have\r\ndisowned her son. But they did the very reverse of this. \"I have been\r\nwhipped,\" Jonathan said, and he immediately went into training under\r\na new system for another fight.\r\n\r\nAnd so all through September and October the great armies on the\r\nPotomac rested comparatively in quiet, the Northern forces drawing to\r\nthemselves immense levies. The general confidence in Maclellan was\r\nthen very great, and the cautious measures by which he endeavoured to\r\nbring his vast untrained body of men under discipline were such as\r\ndid at that time recommend themselves to most military critics. Early\r\nin September the northern party obtained a considerable advantage\r\nby taking the fort at Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina, situated\r\non one of those long banks which lie along the shores of the\r\nSouthern States; but towards the end of October they experienced a\r\nconsiderable reverse in an attack which was made on the Secessionists\r\nby General Stone, and in which Colonel Baker was killed. Colonel\r\nBaker had been senator for Oregon, and was well known as an orator.\r\nTaking all things together, however, nothing material had been\r\ndone up to the end of October; and at that time northern men were\r\nwaiting--not perhaps impatiently, considering the great hopes,\r\nand perhaps great fears which filled their hearts, but with eager\r\nexpectation for some event of which they might talk with pride.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom they had trusted all their hopes was young for so\r\ngreat a command. I think that at this time (October 1861) General\r\nMaclellan was not yet thirty-five. He had served early in life in the\r\nMexican war, having come originally from Pennsylvania, and having\r\nbeen educated at the military college at West Point. During our\r\nwar with Russia he was sent to the Crimea by his own Government\r\nin conjunction with two other officers of the United States army,\r\nthat they might learn all that was to be learned there as to\r\nmilitary tactics, and report especially as to the manner in which\r\nfortifications were made and attacked. I have been informed that a\r\nvery able report was sent in by them to the Government, on their\r\nreturn, and that this was drawn up by Maclellan. But in America a\r\nman is not only a soldier or always a soldier; nor is he always a\r\nclergyman if once a clergyman. He takes a spell at anything suitable\r\nthat may be going. And in this way Maclellan was for some years\r\nengaged on the Central Illinois Railway, and was for a considerable\r\ntime the head manager of that concern. We all know with what\r\nsuddenness he rose to the highest command in the army immediately\r\nafter the defeat at Bull's Run.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to describe what were the feelings of the West\r\nin the autumn of 1861 with regard to the war. The excitement and\r\neagerness there were very great, and they were perhaps as great in\r\nthe North. But in the North the matter seemed to me to be regarded\r\nfrom a different point of view. As a rule, the men of the North are\r\nnot abolitionists. It is quite certain that they were not so before\r\nsecession began. They hate slavery as we in England hate it; but they\r\nare aware, as also are we, that the disposition of four million of\r\nblack men and women forms a question which cannot be solved by the\r\nchivalry of any modern Orlando. The property invested in these four\r\nmillion slaves forms the entire wealth of the South. If they could\r\nbe wafted by a philanthropic breeze back to the shores of Africa,--a\r\nbreeze of which the philanthropy would certainly not be appreciated\r\nby those so wafted--the South would be a wilderness. The subject is\r\none as full of difficulty as any with which politicians of these days\r\nare tormented. The Northerners fully appreciate this, and as a rule\r\nare not abolitionists in the western sense of the word. To them the\r\nwar is recommended by precisely those feelings which animated us when\r\nwe fought for our colonies,--when we strove to put down American\r\nindependence. Secession is rebellion against the Government: and is\r\nall the more bitter to the North because that rebellion broke out at\r\nthe first moment of northern ascendancy. \"We submitted,\" the North\r\nsays, \"to southern Presidents, and southern statesmen, and southern\r\ncouncils, because we obeyed the vote of the people. But as to\r\nyou--the voice of the people is nothing in your estimation! At\r\nthe first moment in which the popular vote places at Washington a\r\nPresident with northern feelings, you rebel. We submitted in your\r\ndays; and by heaven, you shall submit in ours! We submitted loyally;\r\nthrough love of the law and the Constitution. You have disregarded\r\nthe law, and thrown over the Constitution. But you shall be made to\r\nsubmit, as a child is made to submit to its governor.\"\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that on commercial questions the North\r\nand the West are divided. The Morrill tariff is as odious to the\r\nWest as it is to the South. The South and West are both agricultural\r\nproductive regions, desirous of sending cotton and corn to foreign\r\ncountries and of receiving back foreign manufactures on the best\r\nterms. But the North is a manufacturing country--a poor manufacturing\r\ncountry as regards excellence of manufacture--and therefore the more\r\nanxious to foster its own growth by protective laws. The Morrill\r\ntariff is very injurious to the West, and is odious there. I might\r\nadd that its folly has already been so far recognized even in the\r\nNorth, as to make it very generally odious there also.\r\n\r\nSo much I have said endeavouring to make it understood how far the\r\nNorth and West were united in feeling against the South in the autumn\r\nof 1861, and how far there existed between them a diversity of\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFROM NIAGARA TO THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Niagara we went by the Canada Great Western Railway to Detroit,\r\nthe big city of Michigan. It is an American institution that the\r\nStates should have a commercial capital, or what I call their big\r\ncity, as well as a political capital, which may as a rule be called\r\nthe State's central city. The object in choosing the political\r\ncapital is average nearness of approach from the various confines\r\nof the State; but commerce submits to no such Procrustean laws in\r\nselecting her capitals, and consequently she has placed Detroit on\r\nthe borders of Michigan, on the shore of the neck of water which\r\njoins Lake Huron to Lake Erie through which all the trade must flow\r\nwhich comes down from Lakes Michigan, Superior, and Huron, on its way\r\nto the eastern States and to Europe. We had thought of going from\r\nBuffalo across Lake Erie to Detroit; but we found that the better\r\nclass of steamers had been taken off the waters for the winter. And\r\nwe also found that navigation among these lakes is a mistake whenever\r\nthe necessary journey can be taken by railway. Their waters are by\r\nno means smooth; and then there is nothing to be seen. I do not\r\nknow whether others may have a feeling, almost instinctive, that\r\nlake navigation must be pleasant,--that lakes must of necessity\r\nbe beautiful. I have such a feeling; but not now so strongly as\r\nformerly. Such an idea should be kept for use in Europe, and never\r\nbrought over to America with other travelling gear. The lakes in\r\nAmerica are cold, cumbrous, uncouth, and uninteresting--intended by\r\nnature for the conveyance of cereal produce, but not for the comfort\r\nof travelling men and women. So we gave up our plan of traversing\r\nthe lake, and passing back into Canada by the suspension bridge at\r\nNiagara, we reached the Detroit river at Windsor by the Great Western\r\nline, and passed thence by the ferry into the city of Detroit.\r\n\r\nIn making this journey at night we introduced ourselves to the\r\nthoroughly American institution of sleeping-cars;--that is, of cars\r\nin which beds are made up for travellers. The traveller may have a\r\nwhole bed, or half a bed, or no bed at all as he pleases, paying a\r\ndollar or half a dollar extra should he choose the partial or full\r\nfruition of a couch. I confess I have always taken a delight in\r\nseeing these beds made up, and consider that the operations of\r\nthe change are generally as well executed as the manoeuvres of\r\nany pantomime at Drury Lane. The work is usually done by negroes\r\nor coloured men; and the domestic negroes of America are always\r\nlight-handed and adroit. The nature of an American car is no\r\ndoubt known to all men. It looks as far removed from all bedroom\r\naccommodation, as the baker's barrow does from the steam-engine into\r\nwhich it is to be converted by Harlequin's wand. But the negro goes\r\nto work much more quietly than the Harlequin, and for every four\r\nseats in the railway car he builds up four beds, almost as quickly\r\nas the hero of the pantomime goes through his performance. The great\r\nglory of the Americans is in their wondrous contrivances,--in their\r\npatent remedies for the usually troublous operations of life. In\r\ntheir huge hotels all the bell-ropes of each house ring on one bell\r\nonly, but a patent indicator discloses a number, and the whereabouts\r\nof the ringer is shown. One fire heats every room, passage, hall, and\r\ncupboard,--and does it so effectually that the inhabitants are all\r\nbut stifled. Soda-water bottles open themselves without any trouble\r\nof wire or strings. Men and women go up and down stairs without\r\nmotive power of their own. Hot and cold water are laid on to all the\r\nchambers;--though it sometimes happens that the water from both taps\r\nis boiling, and that when once turned on it cannot be turned off\r\nagain by any human energy. Everything is done by a new and wonderful\r\npatent contrivance; and of all their wonderful contrivances that\r\nof their railroad beds is by no means the least. For every four\r\nseats the negro builds up four beds,--that is, four half-beds or\r\naccommodation for four persons. Two are supposed to be below on the\r\nlevel of the ordinary four seats, and two up above on shelves which\r\nare let down from the roof. Mattresses slip out from one nook and\r\npillows from another. Blankets are added, and the bed is ready. Any\r\nover particular individual--an islander, for instance, who hugs\r\nhis chains--will generally prefer to pay the dollar for the double\r\naccommodation. Looking at the bed in the light of a bed,--taking as\r\nit were an abstract view of it,--or comparing it with some other\r\nbed or beds with which the occupant may have acquaintance, I cannot\r\nsay that it is in all respects perfect. But distances are long in\r\nAmerica; and he who declines to travel by night will lose very much\r\ntime. He who does so travel will find the railway bed a great relief.\r\nI must confess that the feeling of dirt on the following morning is\r\nrather oppressive.\r\n\r\nFrom Windsor on the Canada side we passed over to Detroit in the\r\nState of Michigan by a steam ferry. But ferries in England and\r\nferries in America are very different. Here on this Detroit ferry,\r\nsome hundred of passengers who were going forward from the other side\r\nwithout delay, at once sat down to breakfast. I may as well explain\r\nthe way in which disposition is made of one's luggage as one takes\r\nthese long journeys. The traveller when he starts has his baggage\r\nchecked. He abandons his trunk--generally a box studded with nails,\r\nas long as a coffin and as high as a linen chest,--and in return for\r\nthis he receives an iron ticket with a number on it. As he approaches\r\nthe end of his first instalment of travel, and while the engine is\r\nstill working its hardest, a man comes up to him, bearing with him\r\nsuspended on a circular bar an infinite variety of other checks. The\r\ntraveller confides to this man his wishes; and if he be going further\r\nwithout delay, surrenders his check and receives a counter-check in\r\nreturn. Then while the train is still in motion, the new destiny\r\nof the trunk is imparted to it. But another man, with another set\r\nof checks, also comes the way, walking leisurely through the train\r\nas he performs his work. This is the minister of the hotel-omnibus\r\ninstitution. His business is with those who do not travel beyond\r\nthe next terminus. To him, if such be your intention, you make your\r\nconfidence, giving up your tallies and taking other tallies, by way\r\nof receipt; and your luggage is afterwards found by you in the hall\r\nof your hotel. There is undoubtedly very much of comfort in this; and\r\nthe mind of the traveller is lost in amazement as he thinks of the\r\nfutile efforts with which he would struggle to regain his luggage\r\nwere there no such arrangement. Enormous piles of boxes are disclosed\r\non the platform at all the larger stations, the numbers of which are\r\nroared forth with quick voice by some two or three railway denizens\r\nat once. A modest English voyager with six or seven small packages,\r\nwould stand no chance of getting anything if he were left to his own\r\ndevices. As it is I am bound to say that the thing is well done.\r\nI have had my desk with all my money in it lost for a day, and my\r\nblack leather bag was on one occasion sent back over the line. They,\r\nhowever, were recovered; and on the whole I feel grateful to the\r\ncheck system of the American railways. And then, too, one never hears\r\nof extra luggage. Of weight they are quite regardless. On two or\r\nthree occasions an overwrought official has muttered between his\r\nteeth that ten packages were a great many, and that some of those\r\n\"light fixings\" might have been made up into one. And when I came to\r\nunderstand that the number of every check was entered in a book, and\r\nre-entered at every change, I did whisper to my wife that she ought\r\nto do without a bonnet-box. The ten, however, went on, and were\r\nalways duly protected. I must add, however, that articles requiring\r\ntender treatment will sometimes reappear a little the worse from the\r\nhardships of their journey.\r\n\r\nI have not much to say of Detroit; not much, that is, beyond what I\r\nhave to say of all the North. It is a large well-built half-finished\r\ncity, lying on a convenient water way, and spreading itself out\r\nwith promises of a wide and still wider prosperity. It has about it\r\nperhaps as little of intrinsic interest as any of those large western\r\ntowns which I visited. It is not so pleasant as Milwaukee, nor so\r\npicturesque as St. Paul, nor so grand as Chicago, nor so civilized as\r\nCleveland, nor so busy as Buffalo. Indeed Detroit is neither pleasant\r\nnor picturesque at all. I will not say that it is uncivilized, but it\r\nhas a harsh, crude, unprepossessing appearance. It has some 70,000\r\ninhabitants, and good accommodation for shipping. It was doing an\r\nenormous business before the war began, and when these troublous\r\ntimes are over will no doubt again go ahead. I do not, however,\r\nthink it well to recommend any Englishman to make a special visit to\r\nDetroit, who may be wholly uncommercial in his views and travel in\r\nsearch of that which is either beautiful or interesting.\r\n\r\nFrom Detroit we continued our course westward across the State of\r\nMichigan through a country that was absolutely wild till the railway\r\npierced it. Very much of it is still absolutely wild. For miles upon\r\nmiles the road passes the untouched forest, showing that even in\r\nMichigan the great work of civilization has hardly more than been\r\ncommenced. As one thinks of the all but countless population which is\r\nbefore long to be fed from these regions, of the cities which will\r\ngrow here, and of the amount of government which in due time will be\r\nrequired, one can hardly fail to feel that the division of the United\r\nStates into separate nationalities is merely a part of the ordained\r\nwork of creation, as arranged for the well-being of mankind. The\r\nStates already boast of thirty millions of inhabitants,--not of\r\nunnoticed and unnoticeable beings, requiring little, knowing little,\r\nand doing little, such as are the Eastern hordes which may be counted\r\nby tens of millions; but of men and women who talk loudly and are\r\nambitious, who eat beef, who read and write, and understand the\r\ndignity of manhood. But these thirty millions are as nothing to the\r\ncrowds which will grow sleek and talk loudly, and become aggressive\r\non these wheat and meat producing levels. The country is as yet but\r\ntouched by the pioneering hand of population. In the old countries\r\nagriculture, following on the heels of pastoral patriarchal life,\r\npreceded the birth of cities. But in this young world the cities have\r\ncome first. The new Jasons, blessed with the experience of the old\r\nworld adventurers, have gone forth in search of their golden fleeces\r\narmed with all that the science and skill of the East had as yet\r\nproduced, and in settling up their new Colchis have begun by the\r\nerection of first-class hotels and the fabrication of railroads. Let\r\nthe old world bid them God speed in their work. Only it would be well\r\nif they could be brought to acknowledge from whence they have learned\r\nall that they know.\r\n\r\nOur route lay right across the State to a place called Grand Haven on\r\nLake Michigan, from whence we were to take boat for Milwaukee, a town\r\nin Wisconsin on the opposite or western shore of the lake. Michigan\r\nis sometimes called the Peninsular State from the fact that the\r\nmain part of its territory is surrounded by Lakes Michigan and\r\nHuron, by the little Lake St. Clair, and by Lake Erie. It juts out\r\nto the northward from the main land of Indiana and Ohio, and is\r\ncircumnavigable on the east, north, and west. These particulars\r\nrefer, however, to a part of the State only, for a portion of it lies\r\non the other side of Lake Michigan, between that and Lake Superior. I\r\ndoubt whether any large inland territory in the world is blessed with\r\nsuch facilities of water carriage.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Grand Haven we found that there had been a storm on\r\nthe lake, and that the passengers from the trains of the preceding\r\nday were still remaining there, waiting to be carried over to\r\nMilwaukee. The water, however,--or the sea as they all call it,--was\r\nstill very high, and the captain declared his intention of remaining\r\nthere that night. Whereupon all our fellow-travellers huddled\r\nthemselves into the great lake steam-boat, and proceeded to carry on\r\nlife there as though they were quite at home. The men took themselves\r\nto the bar-room and smoked cigars and talked about the war with\r\ntheir feet upon the counter, and the women got themselves into\r\nrocking-chairs in the saloon and sat there listless and silent,\r\nbut not more listless and silent than they usually are in the big\r\ndrawing-rooms of the big hotels. There was supper there, precisely\r\nat six o'clock, beefsteaks, and tea, and apple jam, and hot cakes,\r\nand light fixings, to all which luxuries an American deems himself\r\nentitled, let him have to seek his meal where he may. And I was soon\r\ninformed with considerable energy, that let the boat be kept there\r\nas long as it might by stress of weather, the beefsteaks and apple\r\njam, light fixings and heavy fixings, must be supplied at the cost of\r\nthe owners of the ship. \"Your first supper you pay for,\" my informant\r\ntold me, \"because you eat that on your own account. What you consume\r\nafter that comes of their doing, because they don't start; and if\r\nit's three meals a day for a week, it's their look out.\" It occurred\r\nto me that under such circumstances a captain would be very apt to\r\nsail either in foul weather or in fair.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright moonlight night, moonlight such as we rarely have in\r\nEngland, and I started off by myself for a walk, that I might see\r\nof what nature were the environs of Grand Haven. A more melancholy\r\nplace I never beheld. The town of Grand Haven itself is placed on the\r\nopposite side of a creek, and was to be reached by a ferry. On our\r\nside, to which the railway came and from which the boat was to sail,\r\nthere was nothing to be seen but sandhills which stretched away for\r\nmiles along the shore of the lake. There were great sand mountains,\r\nand sand valleys, on the surface of which were scattered the debris\r\nof dead trees, scattered logs white with age, and boughs half buried\r\nbeneath the sand. Grand Haven itself is but a poor place, not having\r\nsucceeded in catching much of the commerce which comes across the\r\nlake from Wisconsin, and which takes itself on eastwards by the\r\nrailway. Altogether it is a dreary place, such as might break a man's\r\nheart, should he find that inexorable fate required him there to\r\npitch his tent.\r\n\r\nOn my return I went down into the bar-room of the steamer, put my\r\nfeet upon the counter, lit my cigar, and struck into the debate then\r\nproceeding on the subject of the war. I was getting West, and General\r\nFremont was the hero of the hour. \"He's a frontier man, and that's\r\nwhat we want. I guess he'll about go through. Yes, sir.\" \"As for\r\nrelieving General Fre-mont,\"--with the accent always strongly on\r\nthe \"mont,\"--\"I guess you may as well talk of relieving the whole\r\nWest. They won't meddle with Fre-mont. They are beginning to know in\r\nWashington what stuff he's made of.\" \"Why, sir, there are 50,000 men\r\nin these States who will follow Fre-mont, who would not stir a foot\r\nafter any other man.\" From which, and the like of it in many other\r\nplaces, I began to understand how difficult was the task which the\r\nstatesmen in Washington had in hand.\r\n\r\nI received no pecuniary advantage whatever from that law as to the\r\nsteam-boat meals which my new friend had revealed to me. For my one\r\nsupper of course I paid, looking forward to any amount of subsequent\r\ngratuitous provisions. But in the course of the night the ship\r\nsailed, and we found ourselves at Milwaukee in time for breakfast on\r\nthe following morning.\r\n\r\nMilwaukee is a pleasant town, a very pleasant town, containing 45,000\r\ninhabitants. How many of my readers can boast that they know anything\r\nof Milwaukee, or even have heard of it? To me its name was unknown\r\nuntil I saw it on huge railway placards stuck up in the smoking-rooms\r\nand lounging halls of all American hotels. It is the big town of\r\nWisconsin, whereas Madison is the capital. It stands immediately on\r\nthe western shore of Lake Michigan, and is very pleasant. Why it\r\nshould be so, and why Detroit should be the contrary, I can hardly\r\ntell; only I think that the same verdict would be given by any\r\nEnglish tourist. It must be always borne in mind that 10,000 or\r\n40,000 inhabitants in an American town, and especially in any new\r\nwestern town, is a number which means much more than would be implied\r\nby any similar number as to an old town in Europe. Such a population\r\nin America consumes double the amount of beef which it would in\r\nEngland, wears double the amount of clothes, and demands double as\r\nmuch of the comforts of life. If a census could be taken of the\r\nwatches it would be found, I take it, that the American population\r\npossessed among them nearly double as many as would the English; and\r\nI fear also that it would be found that many more of the Americans\r\nwere readers and writers by habit. In any large town in England it is\r\nprobable that a higher excellence of education would be found than\r\nin Milwaukee, and also a style of life into which more of refinement\r\nand more of luxury had found its way. But the general level of these\r\nthings, of material and intellectual well being--of beef, that is,\r\nand book learning--is no doubt infinitely higher in a new American\r\nthan in an old European town. Such an animal as a beggar is as\r\nmuch unknown as a mastodon. Men out of work and in want are almost\r\nunknown. I do not say that there are none of the hardships of\r\nlife--and to them I will come by-and-by; but want is not known as\r\na hardship in these towns, nor is that dense ignorance in which so\r\nlarge a proportion of our town populations is still steeped. And then\r\nthe town of 40,000 inhabitants is spread over a surface which would\r\nsuffice in England for a city of four times the size. Our towns in\r\nEngland,--and the towns, indeed, of Europe generally,--have been\r\nbuilt as they have been wanted. No aspiring ambition as to hundreds\r\nof thousands of people warmed the bosoms of their first founders. Two\r\nor three dozen men required habitations in the same locality, and\r\nclustered them together closely. Many such have failed and died out\r\nof the world's notice. Others have thriven, and houses have been\r\npacked on to houses till London and Manchester, Dublin and Glasgow\r\nhave been produced. Poor men have built, or have had built for them,\r\nwretched lanes; and rich men have erected grand palaces. From the\r\nnature of their beginnings such has, of necessity, been the manner\r\nof their creation. But in America, and especially in Western America,\r\nthere has been no such necessity and there is no such result. The\r\nfounders of cities have had the experience of the world before them.\r\nThey have known of sanitary laws as they began. That sewerage, and\r\nwater, and gas, and good air would be needed for a thriving community\r\nhas been to them as much a matter of fact as are the well understood\r\ncombinations between timber and nails, and bricks and mortar. They\r\nhave known that water carriage is almost a necessity for commercial\r\nsuccess, and have chosen their sites accordingly. Broad streets\r\ncost as little, while land by the foot is not as yet of value to be\r\nregarded, as those which are narrow; and therefore the sites of towns\r\nhave been prepared with noble avenues, and imposing streets. A city\r\nat its commencement is laid out with an intention that it shall be\r\npopulous. The houses are not all built at once, but there are the\r\nplaces allocated for them. The streets are not made, but there are\r\nthe spaces. Many an abortive attempt at municipal greatness has so\r\nbeen made and then all but abandoned. There are wretched villages\r\nwith huge straggling parallel ways which will never grow into\r\ntowns. They are the failures,--failures in which the pioneers of\r\ncivilization, frontier men as they call themselves, have lost their\r\ntens of thousands of dollars. But when the success comes; when the\r\nhappy hit has been made, and the ways of commerce have been truly\r\nforeseen with a cunning eye, then a great and prosperous city springs\r\nup, ready made, as it were, from the earth. Such a town is Milwaukee,\r\nnow containing 45,000 inhabitants, but with room apparently for\r\ndouble that number; with room for four times that number, were men\r\npacked as closely there as they are with us.\r\n\r\nIn the principal business streets of all these towns one sees\r\nvast buildings. They are usually called blocks, and are often so\r\ndenominated in large letters on their front, as Portland Block,\r\nDevereux Block, Buel's Block. Such a block may face to two, three, or\r\neven four streets, and, as I presume, has generally been a matter of\r\none special speculation. It may be divided into separate houses, or\r\nkept for a single purpose, such as that of an hotel, or grouped into\r\nshops below, and into various sets of chambers above. I have had\r\noccasion in various towns to mount the stairs within these blocks,\r\nand have generally found some portion of them vacant;--have sometimes\r\nfound the greater portion of them vacant. Men build on an enormous\r\nscale, three times, ten times as much as is wanted. The only measure\r\nof size is an increase on what men have built before. Monroe P.\r\nJones, the speculator, is very probably ruined, and then begins the\r\nworld again, nothing daunted. But Jones's block remains, and gives to\r\nthe city in its aggregate a certain amount of wealth. Or the block\r\nbecomes at once of service and finds tenants. In which case Jones\r\nprobably sells it and immediately builds two others twice as\r\nbig. That Monroe P. Jones will encounter ruin is almost a matter\r\nof course; but then he is none the worse for being ruined. It\r\nhardly makes him unhappy. He is greedy of dollars with a terrible\r\ncovetousness; but he is greedy in order that he may speculate more\r\nwidely. He would sooner have built Jones' tenth block, with a\r\nprospect of completing a twentieth, than settle himself down at\r\nrest for life as the owner of a Chatsworth or a Woburn. As for his\r\nchildren he has no desire of leaving them money. Let the girls marry.\r\nAnd for the boys,--for them it will be good to begin as he begun. If\r\nthey cannot build blocks for themselves, let them earn their bread\r\nin the blocks of other men. So Monroe P. Jones, with his million of\r\ndollars accomplished, advances on to a new frontier, goes to work\r\nagain on a new city, and loses it all. As an individual I differ very\r\nmuch from Monroe P. Jones. The first block accomplished, with an\r\nadequate rent accruing to me as the builder, I fancy that I should\r\nnever try a second. But Jones is undoubtedly the man for the West.\r\nIt is that love of money to come, joined to a strong disregard for\r\nmoney made, which constitutes the vigorous frontier mind, the true\r\npioneering organization. Monroe P. Jones would be a great man to all\r\nposterity, if only he had a poet to sing of his valour.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined how large in proportion to its inhabitants will\r\nbe a town which spreads itself in this way. There are great houses\r\nleft untenanted, and great gaps left unfilled. But if the place be\r\nsuccessful,--if it promise success, it will be seen at once that\r\nthere is life all through it. Omnibuses, or street cars working on\r\nrails run hither and thither. The shops that have been opened are\r\nwell filled. The great hotels are thronged. The quays are crowded\r\nwith vessels, and a general feeling of progress pervades the place.\r\nIt is easy to perceive whether or no an American town is going ahead.\r\nThe days of my visit to Milwaukee were days of civil war and national\r\ntrouble, but in spite of civil war and national trouble Milwaukee\r\nlooked healthy.\r\n\r\nI have said that there was but little poverty,--little to be seen\r\nof real want in these thriving towns, but that they who laboured in\r\nthem had nevertheless their own hardships. This is so. I would not\r\nhave any man believe that he can take himself to the Western States\r\nof America,--to those States of which I am now speaking,--Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, or Illinois, and there by industry escape\r\nthe ills to which flesh is heir. The labouring Irish in these towns\r\neat meat seven days a week, but I have met many a labouring Irishman\r\namong them who has wished himself back in his old cabin. Industry is\r\na good thing, and there is no bread so sweet as that which is eaten\r\nin the sweat of a man's brow; but labour carried to excess wearies\r\nthe mind as well as body, and the sweat that is ever running makes\r\nthe bread bitter. There is, I think, no task-master over free labour\r\nso exacting as an American. He knows nothing of hours, and seems to\r\nhave that idea of a man which a lady always has of a horse. He thinks\r\nthat he will go for ever. I wish those masons in London who strike\r\nfor nine hours' work with ten hours' pay could be driven to the\r\nlabour market of Western America for a spell. And moreover, which\r\nastonished me, I have seen men driven and hurried,--as it were forced\r\nforward at their work, in a manner which to an English workman would\r\nbe intolerable. This surprised me much, as it was at variance with\r\nour,--or perhaps I should say with my,--preconceived ideas as to\r\nAmerican freedom. I had fancied that an American citizen would not\r\nsubmit to be driven;--that the spirit of the country if not the\r\nspirit of the individual would have made it impossible. I thought\r\nthat the shoe would have pinched quite on the other foot. But I found\r\nthat such driving did exist; and American masters in the West with\r\nwhom I had an opportunity of discussing the subject all admitted it.\r\n\"Those men 'll never half move unless they're driven,\" a foreman said\r\nto me once as we stood together over some twenty men who were at\r\ntheir work. \"They kinder look for it, and don't well know how to get\r\nalong when they miss it.\" It was not his business at this moment to\r\ndrive;--nor was he driving. He was standing at some little distance\r\nfrom the scene with me, and speculating on the sight before him. I\r\nthought the men were working at their best; but their movements did\r\nnot satisfy his practised eye, and he saw at a glance that there was\r\nno one immediately over them.\r\n\r\nBut there is worse even than this. Wages in these regions are what we\r\nshould call high. An agricultural labourer will earn perhaps fifteen\r\ndollars a month and his board; and a town labourer will earn a dollar\r\na day. A dollar may be taken as representing four shillings, though\r\nit is in fact more. Food in these parts is much cheaper than in\r\nEngland, and therefore the wages must be considered as very good.\r\nIn making, however, a just calculation it must be borne in mind\r\nthat clothing is dearer than in England and that much more of it\r\nis necessary. The wages nevertheless are high, and will enable the\r\nlabourer to save money,--if only he can get them paid. The complaint\r\nthat wages are held back and not even ultimately paid is very common.\r\nThere is no fixed rule for satisfying all such claims once a week;\r\nand thus debts to labourers are contracted and when contracted are\r\nignored. With us there is a feeling that it is pitiful, mean almost\r\nbeyond expression, to wrong a labourer of his hire. We have men\r\nwho go in debt to tradesmen perhaps without a thought of paying\r\nthem;--but when we speak of such a one who has descended into\r\nthe lowest mire of insolvency, we say that he has not paid his\r\nwasherwoman. Out there in the West the washerwoman is as fair game\r\nas the tailor, the domestic servant as the wine merchant. If a man\r\nbe honest he will not willingly take either goods or labour without\r\npayment; and it may be hard to prove that he who takes the latter is\r\nmore dishonest than he who takes the former; but with us there is a\r\nprejudice in favour of one's washerwoman by which the western mind\r\nis not weakened. \"They certainly have to be smart to get it,\" a\r\ngentleman said to me whom I taxed on the subject. \"You see on the\r\nfrontier a man is bound to be smart. If he ain't smart he'd better\r\ngo back East;--perhaps as far as Europe. He'll do there.\" I had got\r\nmy answer, and my friend had turned the question. But the fact was\r\nadmitted by him as it had been by many others.\r\n\r\nWhy this should be so, is a question, to answer which thoroughly\r\nwould require a volume in itself. As to the driving, why should men\r\nsubmit to it, seeing that labour is abundant, and that in all newly\r\nsettled countries the labourer is the true hero of the age? In answer\r\nto this is to be alleged the fact that hired labour is chiefly done\r\nby fresh comers, by Irish and Germans, who have not as yet among them\r\nany combination sufficient to protect them from such usage. The men\r\nover them are new as masters,--masters who are rough themselves, who\r\nthemselves have been roughly driven, and who have not learned to be\r\ngracious to those below them. It is a part of their contract that\r\nvery hard work shall be exacted; and the driving resolves itself into\r\nthis,--that the master looking after his own interest is constantly\r\naccusing his labourer of a breach of his part of the contract. The\r\nmen no doubt do become used to it, and slacken probably in their\r\nendeavours when the tongue of the master or foreman is not heard. But\r\nas to that matter of non-payment of wages, the men must live; and\r\nhere as elsewhere the master who omits to pay once, will hardly find\r\nlabourers in future. The matter would remedy itself elsewhere, and\r\ndoes it not do so here? This of course is so, and it is not to be\r\nunderstood that labour as a rule is defrauded of its hire. But the\r\nrelation of the master and the man admits of such fraud here much\r\nmore frequently than in England. In England the labourer who did not\r\nget his wages on the Saturday could not go on for the next week. To\r\nhim under such circumstances the world would be coming to an end. But\r\nin the Western States, the labourer does not live so completely from\r\nhand to mouth. He is rarely paid by the week, is accustomed to give\r\nsome credit, and till hard pressed by bad circumstances generally has\r\nsomething by him. They do save money, and are thus fattened up to a\r\nstate which admits of victimization. I cannot owe money to the little\r\nvillage cobbler who mends my shoes, because he demands and receives\r\nhis payment when his job is done. But to my friend in Regent Street I\r\nextend my custom on a different system; and when I make my start for\r\ncontinental life, I have with him a matter of unsettled business to a\r\nconsiderable extent. The American labourer is in the condition of the\r\nRegent Street boot-maker;--excepting in this respect, that he gives\r\nhis credit under compulsion. \"But does not the law set him right?\r\nIs there no law against debtors?\" The laws against debtors are\r\nplain enough as they are written down, but seem to be anything but\r\nplain when called into action. They are perfectly understood, and\r\noperations are carried on with the express purpose of evading them.\r\nIf you proceed against a man, you find that his property is in the\r\nhands of some one else. You work in fact for Jones who lives in the\r\nnext street to you; but when you quarrel with Jones about your wages,\r\nyou find that according to law you have been working for Smith in\r\nanother State. In all countries such dodges are probably practicable.\r\nBut men will or will not have recourse to such dodges according to\r\nthe light in which they are regarded by the community. In the Western\r\nStates such dodges do not appear to be regarded as disgraceful. \"It\r\nbehoves a frontier man to be smart, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHonesty is the best policy. That is a doctrine which has been widely\r\npreached, and which has recommended itself to many minds as being\r\none of absolute truth. It is not very ennobling in its sentiment,\r\nseeing that it advocates a special virtue, not on the ground that\r\nthat virtue is in itself a thing beautiful, but on account of the\r\nimmediate reward which will be its consequence. Smith is enjoined not\r\nto cheat Jones, because he will, in the long run, make more money by\r\ndealing with Jones on the square. This is not teaching of the highest\r\norder; but it is teaching well adapted to human circumstances, and\r\nhas obtained for itself a wide credit. One is driven, however, to\r\ndoubt whether even this teaching is not too high for the frontier\r\nman. Is it possible that a frontier man should be scrupulous and at\r\nthe same time successful? Hitherto those who have allowed scruples to\r\nstand in their way have not succeeded; and they who have succeeded\r\nand made for themselves great names,--who have been the pioneers of\r\ncivilization,--have not allowed ideas of exact honesty to stand in\r\ntheir way. From General Jason down to General Fremont there have\r\nbeen men of great aspirations but of slight scruples. They have been\r\nambitious of power and desirous of progress, but somewhat regardless\r\nhow power and progress shall be attained. Clive and Warren Hastings\r\nwere great frontier men, but we cannot imagine that they had ever\r\nrealized the doctrine that honesty is the best policy. Cortez, and\r\neven Columbus, the prince of frontier men, are in the same category.\r\nThe names of such heroes is legion. But with none of them has\r\nabsolute honesty been a favourite virtue. \"It behoves a frontier man\r\nto be smart, sir.\" Such, in that or other language, has been the\r\nprevailing idea. Such is the prevailing idea. And one feels driven to\r\nask oneself whether such must not be the prevailing idea with those\r\nwho leave the world and its rules behind them, and go forth with the\r\nresolve that the world and its rules shall follow them.\r\n\r\nOf filibustering, annexation, and polishing savages off the face of\r\ncreation there has been a great deal, and who can deny that humanity\r\nhas been the gainer? It seems to those who look widely back over\r\nhistory, that all such works have been carried on in obedience to\r\nGod's laws. When Jacob by Rebecca's aid cheated his elder brother he\r\nwas very smart; but we cannot but suppose that a better race was by\r\nthis smartness put in possession of the patriarchal sceptre. Esau was\r\npolished off, and readers of Scripture wonder why heaven with its\r\nthunder did not open over the heads of Rebecca and her son. But Jacob\r\nwith all his fraud was the chosen one. Perhaps the day may come when\r\nscrupulous honesty may be the best policy even on the frontier. I can\r\nonly say that hitherto that day seems to be as distant as ever. I do\r\nnot pretend to solve the problem, but simply record my opinion that\r\nunder circumstances as they still exist I should not willingly select\r\na frontier life for my children.\r\n\r\nI have said that all great frontier men have been unscrupulous. There\r\nis, however, an exception in history which may perhaps serve to prove\r\nthe rule. The Puritans who colonized New England were frontier men,\r\nand were, I think, in general scrupulously honest. They had their\r\nfaults. They were stern, austere men, tyrannical at the backbone when\r\npower came in their way,--as are all pioneers;--hard upon vices for\r\nwhich they who made the laws had themselves no minds; but they were\r\nnot dishonest.\r\n\r\nAt Milwaukee I went up to see the Wisconsin volunteers, who were\r\nthen encamped on open ground in the close vicinity of the town.\r\nOf Wisconsin I had heard before,--and have heard the same opinion\r\nrepeated since,--that it was more backward in its volunteering than\r\nits neighbour States in the West. Wisconsin has 760,000 inhabitants,\r\nand its tenth thousand of volunteers was not then made up; whereas\r\nIndiana with less than double its number had already sent out\r\nthirty-six thousand. Iowa, with a hundred thousand less of\r\ninhabitants, had then made up fifteen thousand. But nevertheless to\r\nme it seemed that Wisconsin was quite alive to its presumed duty\r\nin that respect. Wisconsin with its three quarters of a million\r\nof people is as large as England. Every acre of it may be made\r\nproductive, but as yet it is not half cleared. Of such a country its\r\nyoung men are its heart's blood. Ten thousand men fit to bear arms\r\ncarried away from such a land to the horrors of civil war is a sight\r\nas full of sadness as any on which the eye can rest. Ah me, when will\r\nthey return, and with what altered hopes! It is, I fear, easier to\r\nturn the sickle into the sword, than to recast the sword back again\r\ninto the sickle!\r\n\r\nWe found a completed regiment at Wisconsin consisting entirely of\r\nGermans. A thousand Germans had been collected in that State and\r\nbrought together in one regiment, and I was informed by an officer\r\non the ground that there are many Germans in sundry other of the\r\nWisconsin regiments. It may be well to mention here that the number\r\nof Germans through all these western States is very great. Their\r\nnumber and well-being were to me astonishing. That they form a great\r\nportion of the population of New York, making the German quarter of\r\nthat city the third largest German town in the world, I have long\r\nknown; but I had no previous idea of their expansion westward. In\r\nDetroit nearly every third shop bore a German name, and the same\r\nremark was to be made at Milwaukee;--and on all hands I heard praises\r\nof their morals, of their thrift, and of their new patriotism. I was\r\ncontinually told how far they exceeded the Irish settlers. To me in\r\nall parts of the world an Irishman is dear. When handled tenderly he\r\nbecomes a creature most loveable. But with all my judgment in the\r\nIrishman's favour, and with my prejudices leaning the same way, I\r\nfeel myself bound to state what I heard and what I saw as to the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nBut this regiment of Germans, and another not completed regiment,\r\ncalled from the State generally, were as yet without arms,\r\naccoutrements, or clothing. There was the raw material of the\r\nregiment, but there was nothing else. Winter was coming on,--winter\r\nin which the mercury is commonly 20 degrees below zero,--and the men\r\nwere in tents with no provision against the cold. These tents held\r\neach two men, and were just large enough for two to lie. The canvas\r\nof which they were made seemed to me to be thin, but was I think\r\nalways double. At this camp there was a house in which the men took\r\ntheir meals, but I visited other camps in which there was no such\r\naccommodation. I saw the German regiment called to its supper by tuck\r\nof drum, and the men marched in gallantly, armed each with a knife\r\nand spoon. I managed to make my way in at the door after them, and\r\ncan testify to the excellence of the provisions of which their\r\nsupper consisted. A poor diet never enters into any combination\r\nof circumstances contemplated by an American. Let him be where he\r\nwill, animal food is, with him, the first necessary of life, and he\r\nis always provided accordingly. As to those Wisconsin men whom I\r\nsaw, it was probable that they might be marched off, down south to\r\nWashington, or to the doubtful glories of the western campaign under\r\nFremont before the winter commenced. The same might have been said\r\nof any special regiment. But taking the whole mass of men who were\r\ncollected under canvas at the end of the autumn of 1861, and who\r\nwere so collected without arms or military clothing, and without\r\nprotection from the weather, it did seem that the task taken in\r\nhand by the Commissariat of the Northern army was one not devoid of\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe view from Milwaukee over Lake Michigan is very pleasing. One\r\nlooks upon a vast expanse of water to which the eye finds no bounds,\r\nand therefore there are none of the common attributes of lake beauty;\r\nbut the colour of the lake is bright, and within a walk of the city\r\nthe traveller comes to the bluffs or low round-topped hills from\r\nwhich he can look down upon the shores. These bluffs form the beauty\r\nof Wisconsin and Minnesota, and relieve the eye after the flat level\r\nof Michigan. Round Detroit there is no rising ground, and therefore,\r\nperhaps, it is that Detroit is uninteresting.\r\n\r\nI have said that those who are called on to labour in these States\r\nhave their own hardships, and I have endeavoured to explain what\r\nare the sufferings to which the town labourer is subject. To escape\r\nfrom this is the labourer's great ambition, and his mode of doing\r\nso consists almost universally in the purchase of land. He saves up\r\nmoney in order that he may buy a section of an allotment, and thus\r\nbecome his own master. All his savings are made with a view to this\r\nindependence. Seated on his own land he will have to work probably\r\nharder than ever, but he will work for himself. No taskmaster can\r\nthen stand over him and wound his pride with harsh words. He will be\r\nhis own master; will eat the food which he himself has grown, and\r\nlive in the cabin which his own hands have built. This is the object\r\nof his life; and to secure this position he is content to work late\r\nand early and to undergo the indignities of previous servitude. The\r\nGovernment price for land is about five shillings an acre--one dollar\r\nand a quarter--and the settler may get it for this price if he be\r\ncontented to take it not only untouched as regards clearing, but also\r\nfar removed from any completed road. The traffic in these lands has\r\nbeen the great speculating business of western men. Five or six years\r\nago, when the rage for such purchases was at its height, land was\r\nbecoming a scarce article in the market! Individuals or companies\r\nbought it up with the object of reselling it at a profit; and many\r\nno doubt did make money. Railway companies were, in fact, companies\r\ncombined for the purchase of land. They purchased land, looking to\r\nincrease the value of it five-fold by the opening of a railroad. It\r\nmay easily be understood that a railway, which could not be in itself\r\nremunerative, might in this way become a lucrative speculation. No\r\nsettler could dare to place himself absolutely at a distance from\r\nany thoroughfare. At first the margins of nature's highways, the\r\nnavigable rivers and lakes, were cleared. But as the railway system\r\ngrew and expanded itself, it became manifest that lands might be\r\nrendered quickly available which were not so circumstanced by nature,\r\nA company which had purchased an enormous territory from the United\r\nStates Government at five shillings an acre might well repay itself\r\nall the cost of a railway through that territory, even though the\r\nreceipts of the railway should do no more than maintain the current\r\nexpenses. It is in this way that the thousands of miles of American\r\nrailroads have been opened; and here again must be seen the immense\r\nadvantages which the States as a new country have enjoyed. With us\r\nthe purchase of valuable land for railways, together with the legal\r\nexpenses which those compulsory purchases entailed, have been so\r\ngreat that with all our traffic railways are not remunerative. But\r\nin the States the railways have created the value of the land. The\r\nStates have been able to begin at the right end, and to arrange\r\nthat the districts which are benefited shall themselves pay for the\r\nbenefit they receive.\r\n\r\nThe Government price of land is 125 cents, or about five shillings an\r\nacre; and even this need not be paid at once if the settler purchase\r\ndirectly from the Government. He must begin by making certain\r\nimprovements on the selected land,--clearing and cultivating some\r\nsmall portion, building a hut, and probably sinking a well. When this\r\nhas been done,--when he has thus given a pledge of his intentions\r\nby depositing on the land the value of a certain amount of labour,\r\nhe cannot be removed. He cannot be removed for a term of years, and\r\nthen if he pays the price of the land it becomes his own with an\r\nindefeasible title. Many such settlements are made on the purchase\r\nof warrants for land. Soldiers returning from the Mexican wars\r\nwere donated with warrants for land,--the amount being 160 acres,\r\nor the quarter of a section. The localities of such lands were\r\nnot specified, but the privilege granted was that of occupying\r\nany quarter-section not hitherto tenanted. It will of course be\r\nunderstood that lands favourably situated would be tenanted. Those\r\ncontiguous to railways were of course so occupied, seeing that\r\nthe lines were not made till the lands were in the hands of the\r\ncompanies. It may therefore be understood of what nature would be\r\nthe traffic in these warrants. The owner of a single warrant might\r\nfind it of no value to him. To go back utterly into the woods, away\r\nfrom river or road, and there to commence with 160 acres of forest,\r\nor even of prairie, would be a hopeless task even to an American\r\nsettler. Some mode of transport for his produce must be found before\r\nhis produce would be of value,--before indeed he could find the means\r\nof living. But a company buying up a large aggregate of such warrants\r\nwould possess the means of making such allotments valuable and of\r\nreselling them at greatly increased prices.\r\n\r\nThe primary settler, therefore,--who, however, will not usually have\r\nbeen the primary owner,--goes to work upon his land amidst all the\r\nwildness of nature. He levels and burns the first trees, and raises\r\nhis first crop of corn amidst stumps still standing four or five feet\r\nabove the soil; but he does not do so till some mode of conveyance\r\nhas been found for him. So much I have said hoping to explain the\r\nmode in which the frontier speculator paves the way for the frontier\r\nagriculturist. But the permanent farmer very generally comes on the\r\nland as the third owner. The first settler is a rough fellow, and\r\nseems to be so wedded to his rough life that he leaves his land after\r\nhis first wild work is done, and goes again further off to some\r\nuntouched allotment. He finds that he can sell his improvements at a\r\nprofitable rate and takes the price. He is a preparer of farms rather\r\nthan a farmer. He has no love for the soil which his hand has first\r\nturned. He regards it merely as an investment; and when things about\r\nhim are beginning to wear an aspect of comfort,--when his property\r\nhas become valuable, he sells it, packs up his wife and little ones,\r\nand goes again into the woods. The western American has no love for\r\nhis own soil, or his own house. The matter with him is simply one of\r\ndollars. To keep a farm which he could sell at an advantage from any\r\nfeeling of affection,--from what we should call an association of\r\nideas,--would be to him as ridiculous as the keeping of a family pig\r\nwould be in an English farmer's establishment. The pig is a part of\r\nthe farmer's stock in trade, and must go the way of all pigs. And\r\nso is it with house and land in the life of the frontier man in the\r\nwestern States.\r\n\r\nBut yet this man has his romance, his high poetic feeling, and above\r\nall his manly dignity. Visit him, and you will find him without coat\r\nor waistcoat, unshorn, in ragged blue trousers and old flannel shirt,\r\ntoo often bearing on his lantern jaws the signs of ague and sickness;\r\nbut he will stand upright before you and speak to you with all the\r\nease of a lettered gentleman in his own library. All the odious\r\nincivility of the republican servant has been banished. He is his own\r\nmaster, standing on his own threshold, and finds no need to assert\r\nhis equality by rudeness. He is delighted to see you, and bids you\r\nsit down on his battered bench without dreaming of any such apology\r\nas an English cottier offers to a Lady Bountiful when she calls. He\r\nhas worked out his independence, and shows it in every easy movement\r\nof his body. He tells you of it unconsciously in every tone of his\r\nvoice. You will always find in his cabin some newspaper, some book,\r\nsome token of advance in education. When he questions you about the\r\nold country he astonishes you by the extent of his knowledge. I defy\r\nyou not to feel that he is superior to the race from whence he has\r\nsprung in England or in Ireland. To me I confess that the manliness\r\nof such a man is very charming. He is dirty and perhaps squalid. His\r\nchildren are sick and he is without comforts. His wife is pale, and\r\nyou think you see shortness of life written in the faces of all the\r\nfamily. But over and above it all there is an independence which sits\r\ngracefully on their shoulders, and teaches you at the first glance\r\nthat the man has a right to assume himself to be your equal. It is\r\nfor this position that the labourer works, bearing hard words and\r\nthe indignity of tyranny,--suffering also too often the dishonest\r\nill-usage which his superior power enables the master to inflict.\r\n\r\n\"I have lived very rough,\" I heard a poor woman say, whose husband\r\nhad ill-used and deserted her. \"I have known what it is to be hungry\r\nand cold, and to work hard till my bones have ached. I only wish that\r\nI might have the same chance again. If I could have ten acres cleared\r\ntwo miles away from any living being, I could be happy with my\r\nchildren. I find a kind of comfort when I am at work from daybreak to\r\nsundown, and know that it is all my own.\" I believe that life in the\r\nbackwoods has an allurement to those who have been used to it, that\r\ndwellers in cities can hardly comprehend.\r\n\r\nFrom Milwaukee we went across Wisconsin and reached the Mississippi\r\nat La Crosse. From hence, according to agreement, we were to start\r\nby steamer at once up the river. But we were delayed again, as had\r\nhappened to us before on Lake Michigan at Grand Haven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been promised to us that we should start from La Crosse by\r\nthe river steamer immediately on our arrival there; but on reaching\r\nLa Crosse we found that the vessel destined to take us up the river\r\nhad not yet come down. She was bringing a regiment from Minnesota,\r\nand under such circumstances some pardon might be extended to\r\nirregularities. This plea was made by one of the boat clerks in\r\na very humble tone, and was fully accepted by us. The wonder was\r\nthat at such a period all means of public conveyance were not put\r\nabsolutely out of gear. One might surmise that when regiments were\r\nconstantly being moved for the purposes of civil war, when the whole\r\nNorth had but the one object of collecting together a sufficient\r\nnumber of men to crush the South, ordinary travelling for ordinary\r\npurposes would be difficult, slow, and subject to sudden stoppages.\r\nSuch, however, was not the case either in the northern or western\r\nStates. The trains ran much as usual, and those connected with the\r\nboats and railways were just as anxious as ever to secure passengers.\r\nThe boat clerk at La Crosse apologised amply for the delay, and we\r\nsat ourselves down with patience to await the arrival of the second\r\nMinnesota regiment on its way to Washington.\r\n\r\nDuring the four hours that we were kept waiting we were harboured on\r\nboard a small steamer, and at about eleven the terribly harsh whistle\r\nthat is made by the Mississippi boats informed us that the regiment\r\nwas arriving. It came up to the quay in two steamers, 750 being\r\nbrought in that which was to take us back, and 250 in a smaller one.\r\nThe moon was very bright, and great flaming torches were lit on the\r\nvessel's side, so that all the operations of the men were visible.\r\nThe two steamers had run close up, thrusting us away from the quay\r\nin their passage, but doing it so gently that we did not even feel\r\nthe motion. These large boats--and their size may be understood from\r\nthe fact that one of them had just brought down 750 men,--are moved\r\nso easily and so gently that they come gliding in among each other\r\nwithout hesitation and without pause. On English waters we do\r\nnot willingly run ships against each other; and when we do so\r\nunwillingly, they bump and crush and crash upon each other, and\r\ntimbers fly while men are swearing. But here there was neither\r\ncrashing nor swearing, and the boats noiselessly pressed against each\r\nother as though they were cased in muslin and crinoline.\r\n\r\nI got out upon the quay and stood close by the plank, watching each\r\nman as he left the vessel and walked across towards the railway.\r\nThose whom I had previously seen in tents were not equipped, but\r\nthese men were in uniform and each bore his musket. Taking them all\r\ntogether they were as fine a set of men as I ever saw collected. No\r\nman could doubt on seeing them that they bore on their countenances\r\nthe signs of higher breeding and better education than would be\r\nseen in a thousand men enlisted in England. I do not mean to argue\r\nfrom this that Americans are better than English. I do not mean to\r\nargue here that they are even better educated. My assertion goes to\r\nshow that the men generally were taken from a higher level in the\r\ncommunity than that which fills our own ranks. It was a matter of\r\nregret to me, here and on many subsequent occasions, to see men bound\r\nfor three years to serve as common soldiers, who were so manifestly\r\nfitted for a better and more useful life. To me it is always a source\r\nof sorrow to see a man enlisted. I feel that the individual recruit\r\nis doing badly with himself--carrying himself and the strength and\r\nintelligence which belongs to him to a bad market. I know that there\r\nmust be soldiers; but as to every separate soldier I regret that he\r\nshould be one of them. And the higher is the class from which such\r\nsoldiers are drawn, the greater the intelligence of the men so to\r\nbe employed, the deeper with me is that feeling of regret. But this\r\nstrikes one much less in an old country than in a country that is\r\nnew. In the old countries population is thick, and food sometimes\r\nscarce. Men can be spared, and any employment may be serviceable,\r\neven though that employment be in itself so unproductive as that of\r\nfighting battles or preparing for them. But in the western States of\r\nAmerica every arm that can guide a plough is of incalculable value.\r\nMinnesota was admitted as a State about three years before this time,\r\nand its whole population is not much above 150,000. Of this number\r\nperhaps 40,000 may be working men. And now this infant State with\r\nits huge territory and scanty population is called upon to send its\r\nheart's blood out to the war.\r\n\r\nAnd it has sent its heart's best blood. Forth they came--fine,\r\nstalwart, well-grown fellows, looking to my eye as though they had\r\nas yet but faintly recognised the necessary severity of military\r\ndiscipline. To them hitherto the war had seemed to be an arena on\r\nwhich each might do something for his country, which that country\r\nwould recognise. To themselves as yet--and to me also--they were a\r\nband of heroes, to be reduced by the compressing power of military\r\ndiscipline to the lower level, but more necessary position of a\r\nregiment of soldiers. Ah me! how terrible to them has been the\r\nbreaking up of that delusion! When a poor yokel in England is\r\nenlisted with a shilling and a promise of unlimited beer and glory,\r\none pities and if possible would save him. But with him the mode of\r\nlife to which he goes may not be much inferior to that he leaves.\r\nIt may be that for him soldiering is the best trade possible in his\r\ncircumstances. It may keep him from the hen-roosts, and perhaps\r\nfrom his neighbours' pantries; and discipline may be good for him.\r\nPopulation is thick with us, and there are many whom it may be well\r\nto collect and make available under the strictest surveillance. But\r\nof these men whom I saw entering on their career upon the banks of\r\nthe Mississippi, many were fathers of families, many were owners of\r\nlands, many were educated men capable of high aspirations,--all were\r\nserviceable members of their State. There were probably there not\r\nthree or four of whom it would be well that the State should be rid.\r\nAs soldiers fit, or capable of being made fit for the duties they had\r\nundertaken, I could find but one fault with them. Their average age\r\nwas too high. There were men among them with grizzled beards, and\r\nmany who had counted thirty, thirty-five, and forty years. They had,\r\nI believe, devoted themselves with a true spirit of patriotism. No\r\ndoubt each had some ulterior hope as to himself,--as has every mortal\r\npatriot. Regulus when he returned hopeless to Carthage, trusted that\r\nsome Horace would tell his story. Each of these men from Minnesota\r\nlooked probably forward to his reward; but the reward desired was of\r\na high class.\r\n\r\nThe first great misery to be endured by these regiments will be the\r\nmilitary lesson of obedience which they must learn before they can\r\nbe of any service. It always seemed to me when I came near them\r\nthat they had not as yet recognized the necessary austerity of an\r\nofficer's duty. Their idea of a captain was the stage idea of a\r\nleader of dramatic banditti, a man to be followed and obeyed as a\r\nleader, but to be obeyed with that free and easy obedience which is\r\naccorded to the reigning chief of the forty thieves. \"Wa'll Captain,\"\r\nI have heard a private say to his officer, as he sat on one seat in a\r\nrailway-car with his feet upon the back of another. And the captain\r\nhas looked as though he did not like it. The captain did not like it,\r\nbut the poor private was being fast carried to that destiny which\r\nhe would like still less. From the first I have had faith in the\r\nnorthern army; but from the first I have felt that the suffering to\r\nbe endured by these free and independent volunteers would be very\r\ngreat. A man to be available as a private soldier must be compressed\r\nand belted in till he be a machine.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the men had left the vessel we walked over the side of\r\nit and took possession. \"I am afraid your cabin won't be ready for\r\na quarter of an hour,\" said the clerk. \"Such a body of men as that\r\nwill leave some dirt after them.\" I assured him of course that our\r\nexpectations under such circumstances were very limited, and that\r\nI was fully aware that the boat and the boat's company were taken\r\nup with matters of greater moment than the carriage of ordinary\r\npassengers. But to this he demurred altogether. \"The regiments\r\nwere very little to them, but occasioned much trouble. Everything,\r\nhowever, should be square in fifteen minutes.\" At the expiration of\r\nthe time named the key of our state-room was given to us, and we\r\nfound the appurtenances as clean as though no soldier had ever put\r\nhis foot upon the vessel.\r\n\r\nFrom La Crosse to St. Paul, the distance up the river is something\r\nover 200 miles, and from St. Paul down to Dubuque, in Iowa, to which\r\nwe went on our return, the distance is 450 miles. We were therefore\r\nfor a considerable time on board these boats; more so than such a\r\njourney may generally make necessary, as we were delayed at first by\r\nthe soldiers, and afterwards by accidents, such as the breaking of\r\na paddle-wheel, and other causes to which navigation on the Upper\r\nMississippi seems to be liable. On the whole we slept on board four\r\nnights, and lived on board as many days. I cannot say that the life\r\nwas comfortable, though I do not know that it could be made more so\r\nby any care on the part of the boat-owners. My first complaint would\r\nbe against the great heat of the cabins. The Americans as a rule live\r\nin an atmosphere which is almost unbearable by an Englishman. To this\r\ncause, I am convinced, is to be attributed their thin faces, their\r\npale skins, their unenergetic temperament,--unenergetic as regards\r\nphysical motion,--and their early old age. The winters are long and\r\ncold in America, and mechanical ingenuity is far extended. These two\r\nfacts together have created a system of stoves, hot-air pipes, steam\r\nchambers, and heating apparatus so extensive that from autumn till\r\nthe end of spring all inhabited rooms are filled with the atmosphere\r\nof a hot oven. An Englishman fancies that he is to be baked, and\r\nfor a while finds it almost impossible to exist in the air prepared\r\nfor him. How the heat is engendered on board the river steamers\r\nI do not know, but it is engendered to so great a degree that the\r\nsitting-cabins are unendurable. The patient is therefore driven out\r\nat all hours into the outside balconies of the boat, or on to the top\r\nroof,--for it is a roof rather than a deck,--and there as he passes\r\nthrough the air at the rate of twenty miles an hour, finds himself\r\nchilled to the very bones. That is my first complaint. But as the\r\nboats are made for Americans, and as Americans like hot air, I do not\r\nput it forward with any idea that a change ought to be effected. My\r\nsecond complaint is equally unreasonable, and is quite as incapable\r\nof a remedy as the first. Nine-tenths of the travellers carry\r\nchildren with them. They are not tourists engaged on pleasure\r\nexcursions, but men and women intent on the business of life. They\r\nare moving up and down, looking for fortune, and in search of new\r\nhomes. Of course they carry with them all their household goods. Do\r\nnot let any critic say that I grudge these young travellers their\r\nright to locomotion. Neither their right to locomotion is grudged\r\nby me, nor any of those privileges which are accorded in America to\r\nthe rising generation. The habits of their country and the choice\r\nof their parents give to them full dominion over all hours and over\r\nall places, and it would ill become a foreigner to make such habits\r\nand such choice a ground of serious complaint. But nevertheless the\r\nuncontrolled energies of twenty children round one's legs do not\r\nconvey comfort or happiness, when the passing events are producing\r\nnoise and storm rather than peace and sunshine. I must protest that\r\nAmerican babies are an unhappy race. They eat and drink just as they\r\nplease; they are never punished; they are never banished, snubbed,\r\nand kept in the back ground as children are kept with us; and yet\r\nthey are wretched and uncomfortable. My heart has bled for them\r\nas I have heard them squalling by the hour together in agonies of\r\ndiscontent and dyspepsia. Can it be, I wonder, that children are\r\nhappier when they are made to obey orders and are sent to bed at six\r\no'clock, than when allowed to regulate their own conduct; that bread\r\nand milk are more favourable to laughter and soft childish ways\r\nthan beef-steaks and pickles three times a day; that an occasional\r\nwhipping, even, will conduce to rosy cheeks? It is an idea which I\r\nshould never dare to broach to an American mother; but I must confess\r\nthat after my travels on the western continent my opinions have a\r\ntendency in that direction. Beef-steaks and pickles certainly produce\r\nsmart little men and women. Let that be taken for granted. But rosy\r\nlaughter and winning childish ways are, I fancy, the produce of\r\nbread and milk. But there was a third reason why travelling on\r\nthese boats was not as pleasant as I had expected. I could not get\r\nmy fellow-travellers to talk to me. It must be understood that\r\nour fellow-travellers were not generally of that class which we\r\nEnglishmen, in our pride, designate as gentlemen and ladies. They\r\nwere people, as I have said, in search of new homes and new fortunes.\r\nBut I protest that as such they would have been in those parts much\r\nmore agreeable as companions to me than any gentlemen or any ladies,\r\nif only they would have talked to me. I do not accuse them of any\r\nincivility. If addressed, they answered me. If application was made\r\nby me for any special information, trouble was taken to give it\r\nme. But I found no aptitude, no wish for conversation; nay, even a\r\ndisinclination to converse. In the western States I do not think\r\nthat I was ever addressed first by an American sitting next to me at\r\ntable. Indeed I never held any conversation at a public table in the\r\nWest. I have sat in the same room with men for hours, and have not\r\nhad a word spoken to me. I have done my very best to break through\r\nthis ice, and have always failed. A western American man is not a\r\ntalking man. He will sit for hours over a stove with his cigar in\r\nhis mouth, and his hat over his eyes, chewing the cud of reflection.\r\nA dozen will sit together in the same way, and there shall not be\r\na dozen words spoken between them in an hour. With the women one's\r\nchance of conversation is still worse. It seemed as though the\r\ncares of the world had been too much for them, and that all talking\r\nexcepting as to business,--demands for instance on the servants\r\nfor pickles for their children,--had gone by the board. They were\r\ngenerally hard, dry, and melancholy. I am speaking of course of aged\r\nfemales,--from five and twenty perhaps to thirty, who had long since\r\ngiven up the amusements and levities of life. I very soon abandoned\r\nany attempt at drawing a word from these ancient mothers of families;\r\nbut not the less did I ponder in my mind over the circumstances of\r\ntheir lives. Had things gone with them so sadly, was the struggle\r\nfor independence so hard, that all the softness of existence had\r\nbeen trodden out of them? In the cities too it was much the same. It\r\nseemed to me that a future mother of a family in those parts had left\r\nall laughter behind her when she put out her finger for the wedding\r\nring.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I must say that life on board these steam-boats was\r\nnot as pleasant as I had hoped to find it, but for our discomfort in\r\nthis respect we found great atonement in the scenery through which we\r\npassed. I protest that of all the river scenery that I know, that of\r\nthe Upper Mississippi is by far the finest and the most continued.\r\nOne thinks of course of the Rhine; but, according to my idea of\r\nbeauty, the Rhine is nothing to the Upper Mississippi. For miles upon\r\nmiles, for hundreds of miles, the course of the river runs through\r\nlow hills, which are there called bluffs. These bluffs rise in every\r\nimaginable form, looking sometimes like large straggling unwieldy\r\ncastles, and then throwing themselves into sloping lawns which\r\nstretch back away from the river till the eye is lost in their twists\r\nand turnings. Landscape beauty, as I take it, consists mainly in four\r\nattributes: in water, in broken land, in scattered timber,--timber\r\nscattered as opposed to continuous forest timber,--and in the\r\naccident of colour. In all these particulars the banks of the Upper\r\nMississippi can hardly be beaten. There are no high mountains; but\r\nhigh mountains themselves are grand rather than beautiful. There\r\nare no high mountains, but there is a succession of hills which\r\ngroup themselves for ever without monotony. It is perhaps the\r\never-variegated forms of these bluffs which chiefly constitute the\r\nwonderful loveliness of this river. The idea constantly occurs that\r\nsome point on every hillside would form the most charming site ever\r\nyet chosen for a noble residence. I have passed up and down rivers\r\nclothed to the edge with continuous forest. This at first is grand\r\nenough, but the eye and feeling soon become weary. Here the trees are\r\nscattered so that the eye passes through them, and ever and again\r\na long lawn sweeps back into the country, and up the steep side of\r\na hill, making the traveller long to stay there and linger through\r\nthe oaks, and climb the bluffs, and lie about on the bold but easy\r\nsummits. The boat, however, steams quickly up against the current,\r\nand the happy valleys are left behind, one quickly after another.\r\nThe river is very various in its breadth, and is constantly divided\r\nby islands. It is never so broad that the beauty of the banks is\r\nlost in the distance or injured by it. It is rapid, but has not the\r\nbeautifully bright colour of some European rivers,--of the Rhine for\r\ninstance, and the Rhone. But what is wanting in the colour of the\r\nwater is more than compensated by the wonderful hues and lustre of\r\nthe shores. We visited the river in October, and I must presume that\r\nthey who seek it solely for the sake of scenery should go there in\r\nthat month. It was not only that the foliage of the trees was bright\r\nwith every imaginable colour, but that the grass was bronzed, and\r\nthat the rocks were golden. And this beauty did not last only for a\r\nwhile and then cease. On the Rhine there are lovely spots and special\r\nmorsels of scenery with which the traveller becomes duly enraptured.\r\nBut on the Upper Mississippi there are no special morsels. The\r\nposition of the sun in the heavens will, as it always does, make much\r\ndifference in the degree of beauty. The hour before and the half-hour\r\nafter sunset are always the loveliest for such scenes. But of the\r\nshores themselves one may declare that they are lovely throughout\r\nthose 400 miles which run immediately south from St. Paul.\r\n\r\nAbout half-way between La Crosse and St. Paul we came upon Lake\r\nPepin, and continued our course up the lake for perhaps fifty or\r\nsixty miles. This expanse of water is narrow for a lake, and by those\r\nwho know the lower courses of great rivers, would hardly be dignified\r\nby that name. But, nevertheless, the breadth here lessens the beauty.\r\nThere are the same bluffs, the same scattered woodlands, and the\r\nsame colours. But they are either at a distance, or else they are\r\nto be seen on one side only. The more that I see of the beauty\r\nof scenery, and the more I consider its elements, the stronger\r\nbecomes my conviction that size has but little to do with it, and\r\nrather detracts from it than adds to it. Distance gives one of its\r\ngreatest charms, but it does so by concealing rather than displaying\r\nan expanse of surface. The beauty of distance arises from the\r\nromance,--the feeling of mystery which it creates. It is like the\r\nbeauty of woman which allures the more the more that it is veiled.\r\nBut open, uncovered land and water, mountains which simply rise to\r\ngreat heights with long unbroken slopes, wide expanses of lake, and\r\nforests which are monotonous in their continued thickness, are never\r\nlovely to me. A landscape should always be partly veiled, and display\r\nonly half its charms.\r\n\r\nTo my taste the finest stretch of the river was that immediately\r\nabove Lake Pepin; but then, at this point, we had all the glory of\r\nthe setting sun. It was like fairy land, so bright were the golden\r\nhues, so fantastic were the shapes of the hills, so broken and\r\ntwisted the course of the waters! But the noisy steamer went groaning\r\nup the narrow passages with almost unabated speed, and left the fairy\r\nland behind all too quickly. Then the bell would ring for tea, and\r\nthe children with the beef-steaks, the pickled onions, and the light\r\nfixings would all come over again. The care-laden mothers would tuck\r\nthe bibs under the chins of their tyrant children, and some embryo\r\nsenator of four years old would listen with concentrated attention,\r\nwhile the negro servant recapitulated to him the delicacies of\r\nthe supper-table, in order that he might make his choice with due\r\nconsideration. \"Beef-steak,\" the embryo four-year old senator would\r\nlisp, \"and stewed potato, and buttered toast, and corn cake, and\r\ncoffee,--and--and--and--; mother, mind you get me the pickles.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Paul enjoys the double privilege of being the commercial and\r\npolitical capital of Minnesota. The same is the case with Boston in\r\nMassachusetts, but I do not remember another instance in which it is\r\nso. It is built on the eastern bank of the Mississippi, though the\r\nbulk of the State lies to the west of the river. It is noticeable as\r\nthe spot up to which the river is navigable. Immediately above St.\r\nPaul there are narrow rapids up which no boat can pass. North of\r\nthis, continuous navigation does not go; but from St. Paul down\r\nto New Orleans, and the Gulf of Mexico, it is uninterrupted. The\r\ndistance to St. Louis in Missouri, a town built below the confluence\r\nof the three rivers, Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois, is 900\r\nmiles; and then the navigable waters down to the gulf wash a southern\r\ncountry of still greater extent. No river on the face of the globe\r\nforms a highway for the produce of so wide an extent of agricultural\r\nland. The Mississippi with its tributaries carried to market, before\r\nthe war, the produce of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas,\r\nMississippi, and Louisiana. This country is larger than England,\r\nIreland, Scotland, Holland, Belgium, France, Germany and Spain\r\ntogether, and is undoubtedly composed of much more fertile land. The\r\nStates named comprise the great centre valley of the continent, and\r\nare the farming lands and garden grounds of the western world. He who\r\nhas not seen corn on the ground in Illinois or Minnesota, does not\r\nknow to what extent the fertility of land may go, or how great may be\r\nthe weight of cereal crops. And for all this the Mississippi was the\r\nhigh road to market. When the crop of 1861 was garnered this high\r\nroad was stopped by the war. What suffering this entailed on the\r\nSouth, I will not here stop to say, but on the West the effect was\r\nterrible. Corn was in such plenty, Indian corn that is, or maize,\r\nthat it was not worth the farmer's while to prepare it for market.\r\nWhen I was in Illinois the second quality of Indian corn when shelled\r\nwas not worth more than from eight to ten cents a bushel. But the\r\nshelling and preparation are laborious, and in some instances it was\r\nfound better to burn it for fuel than to sell it. Respecting the\r\nexport of corn from the West, I must say a further word or two in\r\nthe next chapter; but it seemed to be indispensable that I should\r\npoint out here how great to the United States is the need of the\r\nMississippi. Nor is it for corn and wheat only that its waters are\r\nneeded. Timber, lead, iron, coal, pork, all find, or should find,\r\ntheir exit to the world at large by this road. There are towns on it,\r\nand on its tributaries, already holding more than one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand inhabitants. The number of Cincinnati exceeds that, as\r\nalso does the number of St. Louis. Under these circumstances it is\r\nnot wonderful that the States should wish to keep in their own hands\r\nthe navigation of this river.\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful. But it will not, I think, be admitted by the\r\npoliticians of the world, that the navigation of the Mississippi need\r\nbe closed against the West, even though the southern States should\r\nsucceed in raising themselves to the power and dignity of a separate\r\nnationality. If the waters of the Danube be not open to Austria, it\r\nis through the fault of Austria. That the subject will be one of\r\ntrouble no man can doubt; and of course it would be well for the\r\nNorth to avoid that, or any other trouble. In the meantime the\r\nimportance of this right of way must be admitted; and it must be\r\nadmitted also that whatever may be the ultimate resolve of the North,\r\nit will be very difficult to reconcile the West to a divided dominion\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, and, like all\r\nother American towns, is spread over a surface of ground adapted to\r\nthe accommodation of a very extended population. As it is belted on\r\none side by the river, and on the other by the bluffs which accompany\r\nthe course of the river, the site is pretty, and almost romantic.\r\nHere also we found a great hotel,--a huge square building, such as\r\nwe in England might perhaps place near to a railway terminus, in such\r\na city as Glasgow or Manchester; but on which no living Englishman\r\nwould expend his money in a town even five times as big again as\r\nSt. Paul. Everything was sufficiently good, and much more than\r\nsufficiently plentiful. The whole thing went on exactly as hotels do\r\ndown in Massachusetts, or the State of New York. Look at the map, and\r\nsee where St. Paul is. Its distance from all known civilization,--all\r\ncivilization that has succeeded in obtaining acquaintance with the\r\nworld at large, is very great. Even American travellers do not go up\r\nthere in great numbers, excepting those who intend to settle there.\r\nA stray sportsman or two, American or English, as the case may be,\r\nmakes his way into Minnesota for the sake of shooting, and pushes on\r\nup through St. Paul to the Red River. Some few adventurous spirits\r\nvisit the Indian settlements, and pass over into the unsettled\r\nregions of Dacotah and Washington territory. But there is no throng\r\nof travelling. Nevertheless, an hotel has been built there capable\r\nof holding three hundred guests, and other hotels exist in the\r\nneighbourhood, one of which is even larger than that at St. Paul.\r\nWho can come to them, and create even a hope that such an enterprise\r\nmay be remunerative? In America it is seldom more than hope, for one\r\nalways hears that such enterprises fail.\r\n\r\nWhen I was there the war was in hand, and it was hardly to be\r\nexpected that any hotel should succeed. The landlord told me that he\r\nheld it at the present time for a very low rent, and that he could\r\njust manage to keep it open without loss. The war which hindered\r\npeople from travelling, and in that way injured the innkeepers, also\r\nhindered people from housekeeping, and reduced them to the necessity\r\nof boarding out,--by which the innkeepers were, of course, benefited.\r\nAt St. Paul I found that the majority of the guests were inhabitants\r\nof the town, boarding at the hotel, and thus dispensing with the\r\ncares of a separate establishment. I do not know what was charged for\r\nsuch accommodation at St. Paul, but I have come across large houses\r\nat which a single man could get all that he required for a dollar a\r\nday. Now Americans are great consumers, especially at hotels, and all\r\nthat a man requires includes three hot meals with a choice from about\r\ntwo dozen dishes at each.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Paul there are two waterfalls to be seen, which we, of\r\ncourse, visited. We crossed the river at Fort Snelling, a ricketty,\r\nill-conditioned building, standing at the confluence of the Minnesota\r\nand Mississippi rivers, built there to repress the Indians. It is,\r\nI take it, very necessary, especially at the present moment, as\r\nthe Indians seem to require repressing. They have learned that the\r\nattention of the federal government has been called to the war, and\r\nhave become bold in consequence. When I was at St. Paul I heard of a\r\nparty of Englishmen who had been robbed of everything they possessed,\r\nand was informed that the farmers in the distant parts of the State\r\nwere by no means secure. The Indians are more to be pitied than the\r\nfarmers. They are turning against enemies who will neither forgive\r\nnor forget any injuries done. When the war is over they will be\r\nimproved, and polished, and annexed, till no Indian will hold an acre\r\nof land in Minnesota. At present Fort Snelling is the nucleus of a\r\nrecruiting camp. On the point between the bluffs of the two rivers\r\nthere is a plain, immediately in front of the fort, and there we\r\nsaw the newly-joined Minnesota recruits going through their first\r\nmilitary exercises. They were in detachments of twenties, and were\r\nrude enough at their goose step. The matter which struck me most in\r\nlooking at them was the difference of condition which I observed in\r\nthe men. There were the country lads, fresh from the farms, such as\r\nwe see following the recruiting sergeant through English towns; but\r\nthere were also men in black coats and black trousers, with thin\r\nboots, and trimmed beards,--beards which had been trimmed till very\r\nlately; and some of them with beards which showed that they were\r\nno longer young. It was inexpressibly melancholy to see such men\r\nas these twisting and turning about at the corporal's word, each\r\nhandling some stick in his hand in lieu of weapon. Of course they\r\nwere more awkward than the boys, even though they were twice more\r\nassiduous in their efforts. Of course they were sad, and wretched.\r\nI saw men there that were very wretched,--all but heart-broken, if\r\none might judge from their faces. They should not have been there\r\nhandling sticks, and moving their unaccustomed legs in cramped paces.\r\nThey were as razors, for which no better purpose could be found than\r\nthe cutting of blocks. When such attempts are made the block is not\r\ncut, but the razor is spoilt. Most unfit for the commencement of\r\na soldier's life were some that I saw there, but I do not doubt\r\nthat they had been attracted to the work by the one idea of doing\r\nsomething for their country in its trouble.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Snelling we went on to the Falls of Minnehaha. Minnehaha,\r\nlaughing water. Such I believe is the interpretation. The name in\r\nthis case is more imposing than the fall. It is a pretty little\r\ncascade, and might do for a picnic in fine weather, but it is not a\r\nwaterfall of which a man can make much when found so far away from\r\nhome. Going on from Minnehaha we came to Minneapolis, at which place\r\nthere is a fine suspension bridge across the river, just above the\r\nfalls of St. Anthony and leading to the town of that name. Till I got\r\nthere I could hardly believe that in these days there should be a\r\nliving village called Minneapolis by living men. I presume I should\r\ndescribe it as a town, for it has a municipality, and a post-office,\r\nand, of course, a large hotel. The interest of the place however is\r\nin the saw-mills. On the opposite side of the water, at St. Anthony,\r\nis another very large hotel,--and also a smaller one. The smaller\r\none may be about the size of the first-class hotels at Cheltenham or\r\nLeamington. They were both closed, and there seemed to be but little\r\nprospect that either would be opened till the war should be over. The\r\nsaw-mills, however, were at full work, and to my eyes were extremely\r\npicturesque. I had been told that the beauty of the falls had been\r\ndestroyed by the mills. Indeed all who had spoken to me about St.\r\nAnthony had said so. But I did not agree with them. Here, as at\r\nOttawa, the charm in fact consists, not in an uninterrupted shoot\r\nof water, but in a succession of rapids over a bed of broken rocks.\r\nAmong these rocks logs of loose timber are caught, which have escaped\r\nfrom their proper courses, and here they lie, heaped up in some\r\nplaces, and constructing themselves into bridges in others, till\r\nthe freshets of the spring carry them off. The timber is generally\r\nbrought down in logs to St. Anthony, is sawn there, and then sent\r\ndown the Mississippi in large rafts. These rafts on other rivers are\r\nI think generally made of unsawn timber. Such logs as have escaped in\r\nthe manner above described are recognized on their passage down the\r\nriver by their marks, and are made up separately, the original owners\r\nreceiving the value,--or not receiving it as the case may be. \"There\r\nis quite a trade going on with the loose lumber,\" my informant told\r\nme. And from his tone I was led to suppose that he regarded the trade\r\nas sufficiently lucrative if not peculiarly honest.\r\n\r\nThere is very much in the mode of life adopted by the settlers\r\nin these regions which creates admiration. The people are all\r\nintelligent. They are energetic and speculative, conceiving grand\r\nideas, and carrying them out almost with the rapidity of magic.\r\nA suspension bridge half a mile long is erected, while in England\r\nwe should be fastening together a few planks for a foot passage.\r\nProgress, mental as well as material, is the demand of the people\r\ngenerally. Everybody understands everything, and everybody intends\r\nsooner or later to do everything. All this is very grand;--but\r\nthen there is a terrible drawback. One hears on every side of\r\nintelligence, but one hears also on every side of dishonesty. Talk\r\nto whom you will, of whom you will, and you will hear some tale of\r\nsuccessful or unsuccessful swindling. It seems to be the recognized\r\nrule of commerce in the Far West that men shall go into the world's\r\nmarkets prepared to cheat and to be cheated. It may be said that as\r\nlong as this is acknowledged and understood on all sides, no harm\r\nwill be done. It is equally fair for all. When I was a child there\r\nused to be certain games at which it was agreed in beginning either\r\nthat there should be cheating or that there should not. It may be\r\nsaid that out there in the western States, men agree to play the\r\ncheating game; and that the cheating game has more of interest in it\r\nthan the other. Unfortunately, however, they who agree to play this\r\ngame on a large scale, do not keep outsiders altogether out of the\r\nplay-ground. Indeed outsiders become very welcome to them;--and then\r\nit is not pleasant to hear the tone in which such outsiders speak of\r\nthe peculiarities of the sport to which they have been introduced.\r\nWhen a beginner in trade finds himself furnished with a barrel of\r\nwooden nutmegs, the joke is not so good to him as to the experienced\r\nmerchant who supplies him. This dealing in wooden nutmegs, this\r\nselling of things which do not exist, and buying of goods for which\r\nno price is ever to be given, is an institution which is much\r\nhonoured in the West. We call it swindling;--and so do they. But it\r\nseemed to me that in the western States the word hardly seemed to\r\nleave the same impress on the mind that it does elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn our return down the river we passed La Crosse, at which we had\r\nembarked, and went down as far as Dubuque in Iowa. On our way down we\r\ncame to grief and broke one of our paddle-wheels to pieces. We had\r\nno special accident. We struck against nothing above or below water.\r\nBut the wheel went to pieces, and we lay-to on the river side for the\r\ngreater part of a day while the necessary repairs were being made.\r\nDelay in travelling is usually an annoyance, because it causes the\r\nunsettlement of a settled purpose. But the loss of the day did us no\r\nharm, and our accident had happened at a very pretty spot. I climbed\r\nup to the top of the nearest bluff, and walked back till I came to\r\nthe open country, and also went up and down the river banks, visiting\r\nthe cabins of two settlers who live there by supplying wood to the\r\nriver steamers. One of these was close to the spot at which we were\r\nlying; and yet though most of our passengers came on shore, I was\r\nthe only one who spoke to the inmates of the cabin. These people\r\nmust live there almost in desolation from one year's end to another.\r\nOnce in a fortnight or so they go up to a market town in their small\r\nboats, but beyond that they can have little intercourse with their\r\nfellow-creatures. Nevertheless none of these dwellers by the river\r\nside came out to speak to the men and women who were lounging about\r\nfrom eleven in the morning till four in the afternoon; nor did one of\r\nthe passengers except myself knock at the door or enter the cabin, or\r\nexchange a word with those who lived there.\r\n\r\nI spoke to the master of the house, whom I met outside, and he at\r\nonce asked me to come in and sit down. I found his father there and\r\nhis mother, his wife, his brother, and two young children. The wife,\r\nwho was cooking, was a very pretty, pale young woman, who, however,\r\ncould have circulated round her stove more conveniently had her\r\ncrinoline been of less dimensions. She bade me welcome very prettily,\r\nand went on with her cooking, talking the while, as though she were\r\nin the habit of entertaining guests in that way daily. The old woman\r\nsat in a corner knitting--as old women always do. The old man lounged\r\nwith a grandchild on his knee, and the master of the house threw\r\nhimself on the floor while the other child crawled over him. There\r\nwas no stiffness or uneasiness in their manners, nor was there\r\nanything approaching to that republican roughness which so often\r\noperates upon a poor, well-intending Englishman like a slap on the\r\ncheek. I sat there for about an hour, and when I had discussed with\r\nthem English politics and the bearing of English politics upon the\r\nAmerican war, they told me of their own affairs. Food was very\r\nplenty, but life was very hard. Take the year through, each man could\r\nnot earn above half a dollar a day by cutting wood. This, however,\r\nthey owned, did not take up all their time. Working on favourable\r\nwood on favourable days they could each earn two dollars a day; but\r\nthese favourable circumstances did not come together very often. They\r\ndid not deal with the boats themselves, and the profits were eaten up\r\nby the middleman. He, the middleman, had a good thing of it, because\r\nhe could cheat the captains of the boats in the measurement of the\r\nwood. The chopper was obliged to supply a genuine cord of logs,--true\r\nmeasure. But the man who took it off in the barge to the steamer\r\ncould so pack it that fifteen true cords would make twenty-two false\r\ncords. \"It cuts up into a fine trade, you see, sir,\" said the young\r\nman, as he stroked back the little girl's hair from her forehead.\r\n\"But the captains of course must find it out,\" said I. This he\r\nacknowledged, but argued that the captains on this account insisted\r\non buying the wood so much cheaper, and that the loss all came upon\r\nthe chopper. I tried to teach him that the remedy lay in his own\r\nhands, and the three men listened to me quite patiently while I\r\nexplained to them how they should carry on their own trade. But the\r\nyoung father had the last word. \"I guess we don't get above the fifty\r\ncents a day any way.\" He knew at least where the shoe pinched him.\r\nHe was a handsome, manly, noble-looking fellow, tall and thin, with\r\nblack hair and bright eyes. But he had the hollow look about his\r\njaws, and so had his wife, and so had his brother. They all owned\r\nto fever and ague. They had a touch of it most years, and sometimes\r\npretty sharply. \"It was a coarse place to live in,\" the old woman\r\nsaid, \"but there was no one to meddle with them, and she guessed that\r\nit suited.\" They had books and newspapers, tidy delf, and clean glass\r\nupon their shelves, and undoubtedly provisions in plenty. Whether\r\nfever and ague yearly, and cords of wood stretched from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-two are more than a set-off for these good things, I will\r\nleave every one to decide according to his own taste.\r\n\r\nIn another cabin I found women and children only, and one of the\r\nchildren was in the last stage of illness. But nevertheless the woman\r\nof the house seemed glad to see me, and talked cheerfully as long as\r\nI would remain. She inquired what had happened to the vessel, but\r\nit had never occurred to her to go out and see. Her cabin was neat\r\nand well furnished, and there also I saw newspapers and Harper's\r\neverlasting magazine. She said it was a coarse, desolate place for\r\nliving, but that she could raise almost anything in her garden.\r\n\r\nI could not then understand, nor can I now understand, why none of\r\nthe numerous passengers out of the boat should have entered those\r\ncabins except myself, and why the inmates of the cabins should not\r\nhave come out to speak to any one. Had they been surly, morose\r\npeople, made silent by the specialties of their life, it would have\r\nbeen explicable; but they were delighted to talk and to listen. The\r\nfact, I take it, is, that the people are all harsh to each other.\r\nThey do not care to go out of their way to speak to any one unless\r\nsomething is to be gained. They say that two Englishmen meeting in\r\nthe desert would not speak unless they were introduced. The further I\r\ntravel, the less true do I find this of Englishmen, and the more true\r\nof other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCERES AMERICANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stopped at the Julien House, Dubuque. Dubuque is a city in Iowa\r\non the western shore of the Mississippi, and as the names both of\r\nthe town and of the hotel sounded French in my ears, I asked for\r\nan explanation. I was then told that Julien Dubuque, a Canadian\r\nFrenchman, had been buried on one of the bluffs of the river within\r\nthe precincts of the present town, that he had been the first white\r\nsettler in Iowa, and had been the only man who had ever prevailed\r\nupon the Indians to work. Among them he had become a great\r\n\"Medicine,\" and seems for a while to have had absolute power over\r\nthem. He died I think in 1800, and was buried on one of the hills\r\nover the river. \"He was a bold bad man,\" my informant told me, \"and\r\ncommitted every sin under heaven. But he made the Indians work.\"\r\n\r\nLead mines are the glory of Dubuque, and very large sums of money\r\nhave been made from them. I was taken out to see one of them, and to\r\ngo down it; but we found, not altogether to my sorrow, that the works\r\nhad been stopped on account of the water. No effort has been made in\r\nany of these mines to subdue the water, nor has steam been applied to\r\nthe working of them. The lodes have been so rich with lead that the\r\nspeculators have been content to take out the metal that was easily\r\nreached, and to go off in search of fresh ground when disturbed by\r\nwater. \"And are wages here paid pretty punctually?\" I asked. \"Well;\r\na man has to be smart, you know.\" And then my friend went on to\r\nacknowledge that it would be better for the country if smartness were\r\nnot so essential.\r\n\r\nIowa has a population of 674,000 souls, and in October 1861 had\r\nalready mustered eighteen regiments of 1000 men each. Such a\r\npopulation would give probably 170,000 men capable of bearing arms,\r\nand therefore the number of soldiers sent had already amounted to\r\nmore than a decimation of the available strength of the State. When\r\nwe were at Dubuque nothing was talked of but the army. It seemed\r\nthat mines, coal-pits, and corn-fields, were all of no account in\r\ncomparison with the war. How many regiments could be squeezed out\r\nof the State, was the one question which filled all minds; and the\r\ngeneral desire was that such regiments should be sent to the Western\r\narmy, to swell the triumph which was still expected for General\r\nFremont, and to assist in sweeping slavery out into the Gulf of\r\nMexico. The patriotism of the West has been quite as keen as that\r\nof the North, and has produced results as memorable; but it has\r\nsprung from a different source, and been conducted and animated by a\r\ndifferent sentiment. National greatness and support of the law have\r\nbeen the ideas of the North; national greatness and abolition of\r\nslavery have been those of the West. How they are to agree as to\r\nterms when between them they have crushed the South,--that is the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nAt Dubuque in Iowa, I ate the best apple that I ever encountered.\r\nI make that statement with the purpose of doing justice to the\r\nAmericans on a matter which is to them one of considerable\r\nimportance. Americans as a rule do not believe in English apples.\r\nThey declare that there are none, and receive accounts of Devonshire\r\ncyder with manifest incredulity. \"But at any rate there are no\r\napples in England equal to ours.\" That is an assertion to which an\r\nEnglishman is called upon to give an absolute assent; and I hereby\r\ngive it. Apples so excellent as some which were given to us at\r\nDubuque, I have never eaten in England. There is a great jealousy\r\nrespecting all the fruits of the earth. \"Your peaches are fine to\r\nlook at,\" was said to me, \"but they have no flavour.\" This was the\r\nassertion of a lady, and I made no answer. My idea had been that\r\nAmerican peaches had no flavour; that French peaches had none; that\r\nthose of Italy had none; that little as there might be of which\r\nEngland could boast with truth, she might at any rate boast of her\r\npeaches without fear of contradiction. Indeed my idea had been that\r\ngood peaches were to be got in England only. I am beginning to doubt\r\nwhether my belief on the matter has not been the product of insular\r\nignorance, and idolatrous self-worship. It may be that a peach should\r\nbe a combination of an apple and a turnip. \"My great objection\r\nto your country, sir,\" said another, \"is that you have got no\r\nvegetables.\" Had he told me that we had got no seaboard, or no coals,\r\nhe would not have surprised me more. No vegetables in England! I\r\ncould not restrain myself altogether, and replied by a confession\r\n\"that we 'raised' no squash.\" Squash is the pulp of the pumpkin,\r\nand is much used in the States, both as a vegetable and for pies.\r\nNo vegetables in England! Did my surprise arise from the insular\r\nignorance and idolatrous self-worship of a Britisher, or was my\r\nAmerican friend labouring under a delusion? Is Covent Garden well\r\nsupplied with vegetables, or is it not? Do we cultivate our kitchen\r\ngardens with success, or am I under a delusion on that subject? Do\r\nI dream, or is it true that out of my own little patches at home\r\nI have enough for all domestic purposes of peas, beans, broccoli,\r\ncauliflower, celery, beet-root, onions, carrots, parsnips, turnips,\r\nseakale, asparagus, French beans, artichokes, vegetable marrow,\r\ncucumbers, tomatoes, endive, lettuce, as well as herbs of many kinds,\r\ncabbages throughout the year, and potatoes? No vegetables! Had the\r\ngentleman told me that England did not suit him because we had\r\nnothing but vegetables, I should have been less surprised.\r\n\r\nFrom Dubuque, on the western shore of the river, we passed over to\r\nDunleath in Illinois, and went on from thence by railway to Dixon.\r\nI was induced to visit this not very flourishing town by a desire\r\nto see the rolling prairie of Illinois, and to learn by eyesight\r\nsomething of the crops of corn or Indian maize which are produced\r\nupon the land. Had that gentleman told me that we knew nothing of\r\nproducing corn in England he would have been nearer the mark; for\r\nof corn in the profusion in which it is grown here we do not know\r\nmuch. Better land than the prairies of Illinois for cereal crops\r\nthe world's surface probably cannot show. And here there has been\r\nno necessity for the long previous labour of banishing the forest.\r\nEnormous prairies stretch across the State, into which the plough can\r\nbe put at once. The earth is rich with the vegetation of thousands\r\nof years, and the farmer's return is given to him without delay. The\r\nland bursts with its own produce, and the plenty is such that it\r\ncreates wasteful carelessness in the gathering of the crop. It is\r\nnot worth a man's while to handle less than large quantities. Up in\r\nMinnesota I had been grieved by the loose manner in which wheat was\r\ntreated. I have seen bags of it upset, and left upon the ground.\r\nThe labour of collecting it was more than it was worth. There wheat\r\nis the chief crop, and as the lands become cleared and cultivation\r\nspreads itself, the amount coming down the Mississippi will be\r\nincreased almost to infinity. The price of wheat in Europe will soon\r\ndepend, not upon the value of the wheat in the country which grows\r\nit, but on the power and cheapness of the modes which may exist for\r\ntransporting it. I have not been able to obtain the exact prices with\r\nreference to the carriage of wheat from St. Paul, the capital of\r\nMinnesota, to Liverpool, but I have done so as regards Indian corn\r\nfrom the State of Illinois. The following statement will show what\r\nproportion the value of the article at the place of its growth bears\r\nto the cost of the carriage; and it shows also how enormous an effect\r\non the price of corn in England would follow any serious decrease in\r\nthe cost of carriage.\r\n\r\n   A bushel of Indian corn at Bloomington\r\n      in Illinois cost in October, 1861    10 cents.\r\n   Freight to Chicago                      10   \"\r\n   Storeage                                 2   \"\r\n   Freight from Chicago to Buffalo         22   \"\r\n   Elevating, and canal freight to\r\n      New York                             19   \"\r\n   Transfer in New York and insurance       3   \"\r\n   Ocean freight                           23   \"\r\n                                           --\r\n   Cost of a bushel of Indian corn at\r\n      Liverpool                            89 cents.\r\n\r\nThus corn which in Liverpool costs 3_s._ 10_d._, has been sold by\r\nthe farmer who produced it for 5_d._! It is probable that no great\r\nreduction can be expected in the cost of ocean transit; but it will\r\nbe seen by the above figures that out of the Liverpool price of 3_s._\r\n10_d._ or 89 cents, considerably more than half is paid for carriage\r\nacross the United States. All or nearly all this transit is by water,\r\nand there can, I think, be no doubt but that a few years will see\r\nit reduced by fifty per cent. In October last the Mississippi was\r\nclosed, the railways had not rolling stock sufficient for their work,\r\nthe crops of the two last years had been excessive, and there existed\r\nthe necessity of sending out the corn before the internal navigation\r\nhad been closed by frost. The parties who had the transit in their\r\nhands put their heads together and were able to demand any prices\r\nthat they pleased. It will be seen that the cost of carrying a bushel\r\nof corn from Chicago to Buffalo, by the lakes, was within one cent of\r\nthe cost of bringing it from New York to Liverpool. These temporary\r\ncauses for high prices of transit will cease, a more perfect system\r\nof competition between the railways and the water transit will be\r\norganized, and the result must necessarily be both an increase of\r\nprice to the producer and a decrease of price to the consumer. It\r\ncertainly seems that the produce of cereal crops in the valleys of\r\nthe Mississippi and its tributaries increases at a faster rate than\r\npopulation increases. Wheat and corn are sown by the thousand acres\r\nin a piece. I heard of one farmer who had 10,000 acres of corn.\r\nThirty years ago grain and flour were sent westward out of the\r\nState of New York to supply the wants of those who had emigrated\r\ninto the prairies, and now we find that it will be the destiny of\r\nthose prairies to feed the universe. Chicago is the main point of\r\nexportation north-westward from Illinois, and at the present time\r\nsends out from its granaries more cereal produce than any other town\r\nin the world. The bulk of this passes, in the shape of grain or\r\nflour, from Chicago to Buffalo, which latter place is as it were\r\na gateway leading from the lakes or big waters to the canals or\r\nsmall waters. I give below the amount of grain and flour in bushels\r\nreceived into Buffalo for transit in the month of October during four\r\nconsecutive years.\r\n\r\n   October, 1858     4,429,055 bushels.\r\n      \"     1859     5,523,448    \"\r\n      \"     1860     6,500,864    \"\r\n      \"     1861    12,483,797    \"\r\n\r\nIn 1860, from the opening to the close of navigation, 30,837,632\r\nbushels of grain and flour passed through Buffalo. In 1861 the amount\r\nreceived up to the 31st of October was 51,969,142 bushels. As the\r\nnavigation would be closed during the month of November, the above\r\nfigures may be taken as representing not quite the whole amount\r\ntransported for the year. It may be presumed the 52,000,000 of\r\nbushels, as quoted above, will swell itself to 60,000,000. I confess\r\nthat to my own mind statistical amounts do not bring home any\r\nenduring idea. Fifty million bushels of corn and flour simply seems\r\nto mean a great deal. It is a powerful form of superlative, and soon\r\nvanishes away, as do other superlatives in this age of strong words.\r\nI was at Chicago and at Buffalo in October 1861. I went down to the\r\ngranaries, and climbed up into the elevators. I saw the wheat running\r\nin rivers from one vessel into another, and from the railroad vans up\r\ninto the huge bins on the top stores of the warehouses;--for these\r\nrivers of food run up hill as easily as they do down. I saw the corn\r\nmeasured by the forty bushel measure with as much ease as we measure\r\nan ounce of cheese, and with greater rapidity. I ascertained that the\r\nwork went on, week day and Sunday, day and night incessantly; rivers\r\nof wheat and rivers of maize ever running. I saw the men bathed in\r\ncorn as they distributed it in its flow. I saw bins by the score\r\nladen with wheat, in each of which bins there was space for a\r\ncomfortable residence. I breathed the flour, and drank the flour,\r\nand felt myself to be enveloped in a world of breadstuff. And then\r\nI believed, understood, and brought it home to myself as a fact,\r\nthat here in the corn lands of Michigan, and amidst the bluffs\r\nof Wisconsin, and on the high table plains of Minnesota, and the\r\nprairies of Illinois, had God prepared the food for the increasing\r\nmillions of the Eastern world, as also for the coming millions of the\r\nWestern.\r\n\r\nI do not find many minds constituted like my own, and therefore I\r\nventure to publish the above figures. I believe them to be true in\r\nthe main, and they will show, if credited, that the increase during\r\nthe last four years has gone on with more than fabulous rapidity. For\r\nmyself I own that those figures would have done nothing unless I had\r\nvisited the spot myself. A man cannot, perhaps, count up the results\r\nof such a work by a quick glance of his eye, nor communicate with\r\nprecision to another the conviction which his own short experience\r\nhas made so strong within himself;--but to himself seeing is\r\nbelieving. To me it was so at Chicago and at Buffalo. I began then\r\nto know what it was for a country to overflow with milk and honey,\r\nto burst with its own fruits, and be smothered by its own riches.\r\nFrom St. Paul down the Mississippi by the shores of Wisconsin and\r\nIowa,--by the ports on Lake Pepin,--by La Crosse, from which one\r\nrailway runs eastward,--by Prairie du Chien the terminus of a\r\nsecond,--by Dunleath, Fulton, and Rock Island from whence three other\r\nlines run eastward, all through that wonderful State of Illinois--the\r\nfarmers' glory,--along the ports of the great lakes,--through\r\nMichigan, Indiana, Ohio, and further Pennsylvania, up to Buffalo, the\r\ngreat gate of the western Ceres, the loud cry was this--\"How shall we\r\nrid ourselves of our corn and wheat?\" The result has been the passage\r\nof 60,000,000 bushels of breadstuffs through that gate in one year!\r\nLet those who are susceptible of statistics ponder that. For them who\r\nare not I can only give this advice:--Let them go to Buffalo next\r\nOctober, and look for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn regarding the above figures and the increase shown between the\r\nyears 1860 and 1861, it must of course be borne in mind that during\r\nthe latter autumn no corn or wheat was carried into the Southern\r\nStates, and that none was exported from New Orleans or the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi. The States of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana\r\nhave for some time past received much of their supplies from\r\nthe north-western lands, and the cutting off of this current of\r\nconsumption has tended to swell the amount of grain which has been\r\nforced into the narrow channel of Buffalo. There has been no southern\r\nexit allowed, and the southern appetite has been deprived of its\r\nfood. But taking this item for all that it is worth,--or taking\r\nit, as it generally will be taken, for much more than it can be\r\nworth,--the result left will be materially the same. The grand\r\nmarkets to which the western States look and have looked are those of\r\nNew England, New York, and Europe. Already corn and wheat are not the\r\ncommon crops of New England. Boston, and Hartford, and Lowell are fed\r\nfrom the great western States. The State of New York, which, thirty\r\nyears ago, was famous chiefly for its cereal produce, is now fed\r\nfrom these States. New York city would be starved if it depended\r\non its own State; and it will soon be as true that England would\r\nbe starved if it depended on itself. It was but the other day that\r\nwe were talking of free trade in corn as a thing desirable, but as\r\nyet doubtful;--but the other day that Lord Derby who may be Prime\r\nMinister to-morrow, and Mr. Disraeli who may be Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer to-morrow, were stoutly of opinion that the corn laws might\r\nbe and should be maintained;--but the other day that the same opinion\r\nwas held with confidence by Sir Robert Peel, who, however, when the\r\nday for the change came, was not ashamed to become the instrument\r\nused by the people for their repeal. Events in these days march so\r\nquickly that they leave men behind, and our dear old Protectionists\r\nat home will have grown sleek upon American flour before they have\r\nrealized the fact that they are no longer fed from their own furrows.\r\n\r\nI have given figures merely as regards the trade of Buffalo; but it\r\nmust not be presumed that Buffalo is the only outlet from the great\r\ncorn lands of Northern America. In the first place no grain of the\r\nproduce of Canada finds its way to Buffalo. Its exit is by the St.\r\nLawrence, or by the Grand Trunk Railway, as I have stated when\r\nspeaking of Canada. And then there is the passage for large vessels\r\nfrom the Upper Lakes, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie,\r\nthrough the Welland Canal, into Lake Ontario, and out by the St.\r\nLawrence. There is also the direct communication from Lake Erie, by\r\nthe New York and Erie railway to New York. I have more especially\r\nalluded to the trade of Buffalo, because I have been enabled to\r\nobtain a reliable return of the quantity of grain and flour which\r\npasses through that town, and because Buffalo and Chicago are the two\r\nspots which are becoming most famous in the cereal history of the\r\nwestern States.\r\n\r\nEverybody has a map of North America. A reference to such a map will\r\nshow the peculiar position of Chicago. It is at the south or head\r\nof Lake Michigan, and to it converge railways from Wisconsin, Iowa,\r\nIllinois, and Indiana. At Chicago is found the nearest water carriage\r\nwhich can be obtained for the produce of a large portion of these\r\nStates. From Chicago there is direct water conveyance round through\r\nthe lakes to Buffalo at the foot of Lake Erie. At Milwaukee, higher\r\nup on the lake, certain lines of railway come in, joining the lake to\r\nthe Upper Mississippi, and to the wheat-lands of Minnesota. Thence\r\nthe passage is round by Detroit which is the port for the produce\r\nof the greatest part of Michigan, and still it all goes on towards\r\nBuffalo. Then on Lake Erie there are the ports of Toledo, Cleveland,\r\nand Erie. At the bottom of Lake Erie, there is this city of corn, at\r\nwhich the grain and flour are transhipped into the canal boats and\r\ninto the railway cars for New York; and there is also the Welland\r\nCanal, through which large vessels pass from the upper lakes, without\r\ntranshipment of their cargo.\r\n\r\nI have said above that corn--meaning maize or Indian corn--was to be\r\nbought at Bloomington in Illinois for 10 cents or fivepence a bushel.\r\nI found this also to be the case at Dixon--and also that corn of\r\ninferior quality might be bought for fourpence; but I found also that\r\nit was not worth the farmers' while to shell it and sell it at such\r\nprices. I was assured that farmers were burning their Indian corn in\r\nsome places, finding it more available to them as fuel, than it was\r\nfor the market. The labour of detaching a bushel of corn from the\r\nhulls or cobs is considerable, as is also the task of carrying it to\r\nmarket. I have known potatoes in Ireland so cheap that they would not\r\npay for digging and carrying away for purposes of sale. There was\r\nthen a glut of potatoes in Ireland; and in the same way there was in\r\nthe autumn of 1861 a glut of corn in the western States. The best\r\nqualities would fetch a price, though still a low price; but corn\r\nthat was not of the best quality was all but worthless. It did for\r\nfuel, and was burnt. The fact was that the produce had re-created\r\nitself quicker than mankind had multiplied. The ingenuity of man had\r\nnot worked quick enough for its disposal. The earth had given forth\r\nher increase so abundantly that the lap of created humanity could not\r\nstretch itself to hold it. At Dixon in 1861 corn cost fourpence a\r\nbushel. In Ireland in 1848, it was sold for a penny a pound, a pound\r\nbeing accounted sufficient to sustain life for a day,--and we all\r\nfelt that at that price food was brought into the country cheaper\r\nthan it had ever been brought before.\r\n\r\nDixon is not a town of much apparent prosperity. It is one of those\r\nplaces at which great beginnings have been made, but as to which the\r\ndeities presiding over new towns have not been propitious. Much of it\r\nhas been burnt down, and more of it has never been built up. It had a\r\nstraggling, ill-conditioned, uncommercial aspect, very different from\r\nthe look of Detroit, Milwaukee, or St. Paul. There was, however, a\r\ngreat hotel there, as usual, and a grand bridge over the Rock River,\r\na tributary of the Mississippi which runs by or through the town. I\r\nfound that life might be maintained on very cheap terms at Dixon. To\r\nme as a passing traveller the charges at the hotel were, I take it,\r\nthe same as elsewhere. But I learned from an inmate there that he\r\nwith his wife and horse were fed and cared for and attended for two\r\ndollars or 8_s._ 4_d._ a day. This included a private sitting-room,\r\ncoals, light, and all the wants of life--as my informant told\r\nme--except tobacco and whiskey. Feeding at such a house means a\r\nsuccession of promiscuous hot meals as often as the digestion of the\r\npatient can face them. Now I do not know any locality where a man can\r\nkeep himself and his wife, with all material comforts, and the luxury\r\nof a horse and carriage, on cheaper terms than that. Whether or no it\r\nmight be worth a man's while to live at all at such a place as Dixon\r\nis altogether another question.\r\n\r\nWe went there because it is surrounded by the prairie, and out into\r\nthe prairie we had ourselves driven. We found some difficulty in\r\ngetting away from the corn, though we had selected this spot as one\r\nat which the open rolling prairie was specially attainable. As long\r\nas I could see a corn-field or a tree I was not satisfied. Nor indeed\r\nwas I satisfied at last. To have been thoroughly on the prairie and\r\nin the prairie I should have been a day's journey from tilled land.\r\nBut I doubt whether that could now be done in the State of Illinois.\r\nI got out into various patches and brought away specimens of\r\ncorn;--ears bearing sixteen rows of grain, with forty grains in each\r\nrow; each ear bearing a meal for a hungry man.\r\n\r\nAt last we did find ourselves on the prairie, amidst the waving\r\ngrass, with the land rolling on before us in a succession of gentle\r\nsweeps, never rising so as to impede the view, or apparently changing\r\nin its general level,--but yet without the monotony of flatness. We\r\nwere on the prairie, but still I felt no satisfaction. It was private\r\nproperty--divided among holders and pastured over by private cattle.\r\nSalisbury plain is as wild, and Dartmoor almost wilder. Deer they\r\ntold me were to be had within reach of Dixon; but for the buffalo one\r\nhas to go much further afield than Illinois. The farmer may rejoice\r\nin Illinois, but the hunter and the trapper must cross the big rivers\r\nand pass away into the western territories before he can find lands\r\nwild enough for his purposes. My visit to the corn-fields of Illinois\r\nwas in its way successful; but I felt as I turned my face eastward\r\ntowards Chicago that I had no right to boast that I had as yet made\r\nacquaintance with a prairie.\r\n\r\nAll minds were turned to the war, at Dixon as elsewhere. In Illinois\r\nthe men boasted that as regards the war, they were the leading State\r\nof the Union. But the same boast was made in Indiana, and also in\r\nMassachusetts; and probably in half the States of the North and West.\r\nThey, the Illinoisians, call their country the war nest of the West.\r\nThe population of the State is 1,700,000, and it had undertaken\r\nto furnish sixty volunteer regiments of 1000 men each. And let it\r\nbe borne in mind that these regiments, when furnished, are really\r\nfull,--absolutely containing the thousand men when they are sent away\r\nfrom the parent States. The number of souls above named will give\r\n420,000 working men, and if out of these 60,000 are sent to the war,\r\nthe State, which is almost purely agricultural, will have given more\r\nthan one man in eight. When I was in Illinois, over forty regiments\r\nhad already been sent--forty-six if I remember rightly,--and there\r\nexisted no doubt whatever as to the remaining number. From the next\r\nState of Indiana, with a population of 1,350,000, giving something\r\nless than 350,000 working men, thirty-six regiments had been sent.\r\nI fear that I am mentioning these numbers usque ad nauseam; but I\r\nwish to impress upon English readers the magnitude of the effort\r\nmade by the States in mustering and equipping an army within six or\r\nseven months of the first acknowledgment that such an army would be\r\nnecessary. The Americans have complained bitterly of the want of\r\nEnglish sympathy, and I think they have been weak in making that\r\ncomplaint. But I would not wish that they should hereafter have the\r\npower of complaining of a want of English justice. There can be no\r\ndoubt that a genuine feeling of patriotism was aroused throughout\r\nNorth and West, and that men rushed into the ranks actuated by that\r\nfeeling--men for whom war and army life, a camp and fifteen dollars\r\na month, would not of themselves have had any attraction. It came\r\nto that, that young men were ashamed not to go into the army. This\r\nfeeling of course produced coercion, and the movement was in that way\r\ntyrannical. There is nothing more tyrannical than a strong popular\r\nfeeling among a democratic people. During the period of enlistment\r\nthis tyranny was very strong. But the existence of such a tyranny\r\nproves the passion and patriotism of the people. It got the better\r\nof the love of money, of the love of children, and of the love of\r\nprogress. Wives who with their bairns were absolutely dependent on\r\ntheir husbands' labours, would wish their husbands to be at the\r\nwar. Not to conduce, in some special way, towards the war,--to have\r\nneither father there, nor brother, nor son,--not to have lectured, or\r\npreached, or written for the war,--to have made no sacrifice for the\r\nwar, to have had no special and individual interest in the war, was\r\ndisgraceful. One sees at a glance the tyranny of all this in such a\r\ncountry as the States. One can understand how quickly adverse stories\r\nwould spread themselves as to the opinion of any man who chose to\r\nremain tranquil at such a time. One shudders at the absolute absence\r\nof true liberty which such a passion throughout a democratic country\r\nmust engender. But he who has observed all this must acknowledge that\r\nthat passion did exist. Dollars, children, progress, education, and\r\npolitical rivalry all gave way to the one strong national desire for\r\nthe thrashing and crushing of those who had rebelled against the\r\nauthority of the Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nWhen we were at Dixon they were getting up the Dement regiment. The\r\nattempt at the time did not seem to be prosperous, and the few men\r\nwho had been collected had about them a forlorn, ill-conditioned\r\nlook. But then, as I was told, Dixon had already been decimated and\r\nre-decimated by former recruiting colonels. Colonel Dement, from whom\r\nthe regiment was to be named, and whose military career was only now\r\nabout to commence, had come late into the field. I did not afterwards\r\nascertain what had been his success, but I hardly doubt that he did\r\nultimately scrape together his thousand men. \"Why don't you go?\" I\r\nsaid to a burly Irishman who was driving me. \"I'm not a sound man,\r\nyer honour,\" said the Irishman. \"I'm deficient in me liver.\" Taking\r\nthe Irishmen, however, throughout the Union, they had not been found\r\ndeficient in any of the necessaries for a career of war. I do not\r\nthink that any men have done better than the Irish in the American\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nFrom Dixon we went to Chicago. Chicago is in many respects the\r\nmost remarkable city among all the remarkable cities of the Union.\r\nIts growth has been the fastest and its success the most assured.\r\nTwenty-five years ago there was no Chicago, and now it contains\r\n120,000 inhabitants. Cincinnati on the Ohio, and St. Louis at the\r\njunction of the Missouri and Mississippi, are larger towns; but they\r\nhave not grown large so quickly nor do they now promise so excessive\r\na development of commerce. Chicago may be called the metropolis\r\nof American corn--the favourite city haunt of the American Ceres.\r\nThe goddess seats herself there amidst the dust of her full barns,\r\nand proclaims herself a goddess ruling over things political and\r\nphilosophical as well as agricultural. Not furrows only are in her\r\nthoughts, but free trade also, and brotherly love. And within her own\r\nbosom there is a boast that even yet she will be stronger than Mars.\r\nIn Chicago there are great streets, and rows of houses fit to be the\r\nresidences of a new Corn Exchange nobility. They look out on the wide\r\nlake which is now the highway for breadstuffs, and the merchant, as\r\nhe shaves at his window, sees his rapid ventures as they pass away,\r\none after the other, towards the East.\r\n\r\nI went over one great grain store in Chicago possessed by gentlemen\r\nof the name of Sturgess and Buckenham. It was a world in itself,--and\r\nthe dustiest of all the worlds. It contained, when I was there, half\r\na million bushels of wheat--or a very great many, as I might say\r\nin other language. But it was not as a storehouse that this great\r\nbuilding was so remarkable, but as a channel or a river course for\r\nthe flooding freshets of corn. It is so built that both railway vans\r\nand vessels come immediately under its claws, as I may call the great\r\ntrunks of the elevators. Out of the railway vans the corn and wheat\r\nis clawed up into the building, and down similar trunks it is at once\r\nagain poured out into the vessels. I shall be at Buffalo in a page or\r\ntwo, and then I will endeavour to explain more minutely how this is\r\ndone. At Chicago the corn is bought and does change hands, and much\r\nof it, therefore, is stored there for some space of time,--shorter\r\nor longer as the case may be. When I was at Chicago, the only\r\nlimit to the rapidity of its transit was set by the amount of boat\r\naccommodation. There were not bottoms enough to take the corn away\r\nfrom Chicago, nor indeed on the railway was there a sufficiency of\r\nrolling stock or locomotive power to bring it into Chicago. As I said\r\nbefore, the country was bursting with its own produce and smothered\r\nin its own fruits.\r\n\r\nAt Chicago the hotel was bigger than other hotels, and grander. There\r\nwere pipes without end for cold water which ran hot, and for hot\r\nwater which would not run at all. The post-office also was grander\r\nand bigger than other post-offices;--though the postmaster confessed\r\nto me that that matter of the delivery of letters was one which could\r\nnot be compassed. Just at that moment it was being done as a private\r\nspeculation; but it did not pay, and would be discontinued. The\r\ntheatre too was large, handsome, and convenient; but on the night of\r\nmy attendance it seemed to lack an audience. A good comic actor it\r\ndid not lack, and I never laughed more heartily in my life. There was\r\nsomething wrong too just at that time--I could not make out what--in\r\nthe constitution of Illinois, and the present moment had been\r\nselected for voting a new constitution. To us in England such a\r\nnecessity would be considered a matter of importance, but it did not\r\nseem to be much thought of here. \"Some slight alteration probably,\"\r\nI suggested. \"No,\" said my informant--one of the judges of their\r\ncourts--\"it is to be a thorough radical change of the whole\r\nconstitution. They are voting the delegates to-day.\" I went to see\r\nthem vote the delegates; but unfortunately got into a wrong place--by\r\ninvitation--and was turned out, not without some slight tumult. I\r\ntrust that the new constitution was carried through successfully.\r\n\r\nFrom these little details it may perhaps be understood how a town\r\nlike Chicago goes on and prospers, in spite of all the drawbacks\r\nwhich are incident to newness. Men in those regions do not mind\r\nfailures, and when they have failed, instantly begin again. They make\r\ntheir plans on a large scale, and they who come after them fill up\r\nwhat has been wanting at first. Those taps of hot and cold water will\r\nbe made to run by the next owner of the hotel, if not by the present\r\nowner. In another ten years the letters, I do not doubt, will all\r\nbe delivered. Long before that time the theatre will probably be\r\nfull. The new constitution is no doubt already at work; and if found\r\ndeficient, another will succeed to it without any trouble to the\r\nState or any talk on the subject through the Union. Chicago was\r\nintended as a town of export for corn, and, therefore, the corn\r\nstores have received the first attention. When I was there, they were\r\nin perfect working order.\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago we went on to Cleveland, a town in the State of Ohio on\r\nLake Erie, again travelling by the sleeping cars. I found that these\r\ncars were universally mentioned with great horror and disgust by\r\nAmericans of the upper class. They always declared that they would\r\nnot travel in them on any account. Noise and dirt were the two\r\nobjections. They are very noisy, but to us belonged the happy power\r\nof sleeping down noise. I invariably slept all through the night, and\r\nknew nothing about the noise. They are also very dirty,--extremely\r\ndirty,--dirty so as to cause much annoyance. But then they are not\r\nquite so dirty as the day cars. If dirt is to be a bar against\r\ntravelling in America, men and women must stay at home. For myself I\r\ndon't much care for dirt, having a strong reliance on soap and water\r\nand scrubbing brushes. No one regards poisons who carries antidotes\r\nin which he has perfect faith.\r\n\r\nCleveland is another pleasant town,--pleasant as Milwaukee and\r\nPortland. The streets are handsome, and are shaded by grand avenues\r\nof trees. One of these streets is over a mile in length, and\r\nthroughout the whole of it, there are trees on each side--not little\r\npaltry trees as are to be seen on the boulevards of Paris, but\r\nspreading elms,--the beautiful American elm which not only spreads,\r\nbut droops also, and makes more of its foliage than any other tree\r\nextant. And there is a square in Cleveland, well sized, as large\r\nas Russell Square I should say, with open paths across it, and\r\ncontaining one or two handsome buildings. I cannot but think that all\r\nmen and women in London would be great gainers if the iron rails of\r\nthe squares were thrown down, and the grassy enclosures thrown open\r\nto the public. Of course the edges of the turf would be worn, and the\r\npaths would not keep their exact shapes. But the prison look would be\r\nbanished, and the sombre sadness of the squares would be relieved.\r\n\r\nI was particularly struck by the size and comfort of the houses at\r\nCleveland. All down that street of which I have spoken, they do not\r\nstand continuously together, but are detached and separate; houses\r\nwhich in England would require some fifteen or eighteen hundred a\r\nyear for their maintenance. In the States, however, men commonly\r\nexpend upon house rent a much greater proportion of their income than\r\nthey do in England. With us it is, I believe, thought that a man\r\nshould certainly not apportion more than a seventh of his spending\r\nincome to his house rent,--some say not more than a tenth. But in\r\nmany cities of the States a man is thought to live well within bounds\r\nif he so expends a fourth. There can be no doubt as to Americans\r\nliving in better houses than Englishmen,--making the comparison of\r\ncourse between men of equal incomes. But the Englishman has many more\r\nincidental expenses than the American. He spends more on wine, on\r\nentertainments, on horses, and on amusements. He has a more numerous\r\nestablishment, and keeps up the adjuncts and outskirts of his\r\nresidence with a more finished neatness.\r\n\r\nThese houses in Cleveland were very good,--as indeed they are in most\r\nNorthern towns; but some of them have been erected with an amount\r\nof bad taste that is almost incredible. It is not uncommon to see\r\nin front of a square brick house a wooden quasi-Greek portico, with\r\na pediment and Ionic columns, equally high with the house itself.\r\nWooden columns with Greek capitals attached to the doorways, and\r\nwooden pediments over the windows, are very frequent. As a rule these\r\nare attached to houses which, without such ornamentation, would\r\nbe simple, unpretentious, square, roomy residences. An Ionic or\r\nCorinthian capital stuck on to a log of wood called a column, and\r\nthen fixed promiscuously to the outside of an ordinary house, is to\r\nmy eye the vilest of architectural pretences. Little turrets are\r\nbetter than this; or even brown battlements made of mortar. Except in\r\nAmerica I do not remember to have seen these vicious bits of white\r\ntimber,--timber painted white,--plastered on to the fronts and sides\r\nof red-brick houses.\r\n\r\nAgain we went on by rail,--to Buffalo. I have travelled some\r\nthousands of miles by railway in the States, taking long journeys by\r\nnight and longer journeys by day; but I do not remember that while\r\ndoing so I ever made acquaintance with an American. To an American\r\nlady in a railway car I should no more think of speaking than I\r\nshould to an unknown female in the next pew to me at a London church.\r\nIt is hard to understand from whence come the laws which govern\r\nsocieties in this respect; but there are different laws in different\r\nsocieties, which soon obtain recognition for themselves. American\r\nladies are much given to talking, and are generally free from all\r\n_mauvaise honte_. They are collected in manner, well instructed, and\r\nresolved to have their share of the social advantages of the world.\r\nIn this phase of life they come out more strongly than English women.\r\nBut on a railway journey, be it ever so long, they are never seen\r\nspeaking to a stranger. English women, however, on English railways\r\nare generally willing to converse. They will do so if they be on a\r\njourney; but will not open their mouths if they be simply passing\r\nbackwards and forwards between their homes and some neighbouring\r\ntown. We soon learn the rules on these subjects;--but who make the\r\nrules? If you cross the Atlantic with an American lady you invariably\r\nfall in love with her before the journey is over. Travel with the\r\nsame woman in a railway car for twelve hours, and you will have\r\nwritten her down in your own mind in quite other language than that\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nAnd now for Buffalo, and the elevators. I trust I have made it\r\nunderstood that corn comes into Buffalo, not only from Chicago, of\r\nwhich I have spoken specially, but from all the ports round the\r\nlakes: Racine, Milwaukee, Grandhaven, Port Sarnia, Detroit, Toledo,\r\nCleveland, and many others. At these ports the produce is generally\r\nbought and sold; but at Buffalo it is merely passed through a\r\ngateway. It is taken from vessels of a size fitted for the lakes, and\r\nplaced in other vessels fitted for the canal. This is the Erie Canal,\r\nwhich connects the lakes with the Hudson River and with New York.\r\nThe produce which passes through the Welland Canal--the canal which\r\nconnects Lake Erie and the upper lakes with Lake Ontario and the St.\r\nLawrence--is not transhipped, seeing that the Welland Canal, which\r\nis less than thirty miles in length, gives a passage to vessels of\r\n500 tons. As I have before said, 60,000,000 bushels of breadstuff\r\nwere thus pushed through Buffalo in the open months of the year 1861.\r\nThese open months run from the middle of April to the middle of\r\nNovember; but the busy period is that of the last two months,--the\r\ntime that is which intervenes between the full ripening of the corn\r\nand the coming of the ice.\r\n\r\nAn elevator is as ugly a monster as has been yet produced. In\r\nuncouthness of form it outdoes those obsolete old brutes who used to\r\nroam about the semi-aqueous world, and live a most uncomfortable life\r\nwith their great hungering stomachs and huge unsatisfied maws. The\r\nelevator itself consists of a big moveable trunk,--moveable as is\r\nthat of an elephant, but not pliable, and less graceful even than an\r\nelephant's. This is attached to a huge granary or barn; but in order\r\nto give altitude within the barn for the necessary moving up and\r\ndown of this trunk,--seeing that it cannot be curled gracefully\r\nto its purposes as the elephant's is curled,--there is an awkward\r\nbox erected on the roof of the barn, giving some twenty feet of\r\nadditional height, up into which the elevator can be thrust. It will\r\nbe understood, then, that this big moveable trunk, the head of which,\r\nwhen it is at rest, is thrust up into the box on the roof, is made\r\nto slant down in an oblique direction from the building to the river.\r\nFor the elevator is an amphibious institution, and flourishes only on\r\nthe banks of navigable waters. When its head is ensconced within its\r\nbox, and the beast of prey is thus nearly hidden within the building,\r\nthe unsuspicious vessel is brought up within reach of the creature's\r\ntrunk, and down it comes, like a mosquito's proboscis, right through\r\nthe deck, in at the open aperture of the hole, and so into the very\r\nvitals and bowels of the ship. When there, it goes to work upon its\r\nfood with a greed and an avidity that is disgusting to a beholder\r\nof any taste or imagination. And now I must explain the anatomical\r\narrangement by which the elevator still devours and continues to\r\ndevour, till the corn within its reach has all been swallowed,\r\nmasticated, and digested. Its long trunk, as seen slanting down from\r\nout of the building across the wharf and into the ship, is a mere\r\nwooden pipe; but this pipe is divided within. It has two departments;\r\nand as the grain-bearing troughs pass up the one on a pliable band,\r\nthey pass empty down the other. The system therefore is that of an\r\nordinary dredging machine; only that corn, and not mud is taken away,\r\nand that the buckets or troughs are hidden from sight. Below, within\r\nthe stomach of the poor bark, three or four labourers are at work,\r\nhelping to feed the elevator. They shovel the corn up towards its\r\nmaw, so that at every swallow he should take in all that he can hold.\r\nThus the troughs, as they ascend, are kept full, and when they reach\r\nthe upper building they empty themselves into a shoot, over which a\r\nporter stands guard, moderating the shoot by a door, which the weight\r\nof his finger can open and close. Through this doorway the corn\r\nruns into a measure, and is weighed. By measures of forty bushels\r\neach, the tale is kept. There stands the apparatus, with the figures\r\nplainly marked, over against the porter's eye; and as the sum mounts\r\nnearly up to forty bushels he closes the door till the grains run\r\nthinly through, hardly a handful at a time, so that the balance is\r\nexactly struck. Then the teller standing by marks down his figure,\r\nand the record is made. The exact porter touches the string of\r\nanother door, and the forty bushels of corn run out at the bottom of\r\nthe measure, disappear down another shoot, slanting also towards the\r\nwater, and deposit themselves in the canal-boat. The transit of the\r\nbushels of corn from the larger vessel to the smaller will have taken\r\nless than a minute, and the cost of that transit will have been--a\r\nfarthing.\r\n\r\nBut I have spoken of the rivers of wheat, and I must explain what\r\nare those rivers. In the working of the elevator, which I have just\r\nattempted to describe, the two vessels were supposed to be lying at\r\nthe same wharf, on the same side of the building, in the same water,\r\nthe smaller vessel inside the larger one. When this is the case\r\nthe corn runs direct from the weighing measure into the shoot that\r\ncommunicates with the canal boat. But there is not room or time for\r\nconfining the work to one side of the building. There is water on\r\nboth sides, and the corn or wheat is elevated on the one side, and\r\nre-shipped on the other. To effect this the corn is carried across\r\nthe breadth of the building; but, nevertheless, it is never handled\r\nor moved in its direction on trucks or carriages requiring the use\r\nof men's muscles for its motion. Across the floor of the building\r\nare two gutters, or channels, and through these small troughs on a\r\npliable band circulate very quickly. They which run one way, in one\r\nchannel, are laden; they which return by the other channel are empty.\r\nThe corn pours itself into these, and they again pour it into the\r\nshoot which commands the other water. And thus rivers of corn are\r\nrunning through these buildings night and day. The secret of all the\r\nmotion and arrangement consists of course in the elevation. The corn\r\nis lifted up; and when lifted up can move itself and arrange itself,\r\nand weigh itself, and load itself.\r\n\r\nI should have stated that all this wheat which passes through Buffalo\r\ncomes loose, in bulk. Nothing is known of sacks or bags. To any\r\nspectator at Buffalo this becomes immediately a matter of course; but\r\nthis should be explained, as we in England are not accustomed to see\r\nwheat travelling in this open, unguarded, and plebeian manner. Wheat\r\nwith us is aristocratic, and travels always in its private carriage.\r\n\r\nOver and beyond the elevators there is nothing specially worthy of\r\nremark at Buffalo. It is a fine city, like all other American cities\r\nof its class. The streets are broad, the \"blocks\" are high, and cars\r\non tram-ways run all day, and nearly all night as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO TO NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had now before us only two points of interest before we should\r\nreach New York,--the Falls of Trenton, and West Point on the Hudson\r\nRiver. We were too late in the year to get up to Lake George, which\r\nlies in the State of New York, north of Albany, and is, in fact, the\r\nsouthern continuation of Lake Champlain. Lake George, I know, is very\r\nlovely, and I would fain have seen it; but visitors to it must have\r\nsome hotel accommodation, and the hotel was closed when we were near\r\nenough to visit it. I was in its close neighbourhood three years\r\nsince in June; but then the hotel was not yet opened. A visitor to\r\nLake George must be very exact in his time. July and August are the\r\nmonths,--with perhaps the grace of a week in September.\r\n\r\nThe hotel at Trenton was also closed, as I was told. But even if\r\nthere were no hotel at Trenton, it can be visited without difficulty.\r\nIt is within a carriage drive of Utica, and there is moreover a\r\ndirect railway from Utica, with a station at the Trenton Falls. Utica\r\nis a town on the line of railway from Buffalo to New York viâ Albany,\r\nand is like all the other towns we had visited. There are broad\r\nstreets, and avenues of trees, and large shops, and excellent houses.\r\nA general air of fat prosperity pervades them all, and is strong at\r\nUtica as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI remember to have been told thirty years ago that a traveller might\r\ngo far and wide in search of the picturesque, without finding a spot\r\nmore romantic in its loveliness than Trenton Falls. The name of the\r\nriver is Canada Creek West; but as that is hardly euphonious, the\r\ncourse of the water which forms the falls has been called after\r\nthe town or parish. This course is nearly two miles in length, and\r\nalong the space of these two miles it is impossible to say where the\r\ngreatest beauty exists. To see Trenton aright one must be careful not\r\nto have too much water. A sufficiency is no doubt desirable, and it\r\nmay be that at the close of summer, before any of the autumnal rains\r\nhave fallen, there may occasionally be an insufficiency. But if there\r\nbe too much, the passage up the rocks along the river is impossible.\r\nThe way on which the tourist should walk becomes the bed of the\r\nstream, and the great charm of the place cannot be enjoyed. That\r\ncharm consists in descending into the ravine of the river, down\r\namidst the rocks through which it has cut its channel, and in walking\r\nup the bed against the stream, in climbing the sides of the various\r\nfalls, and sticking close to the river till an envious block is\r\nreached, which comes sheer down into the water, and prevents further\r\nprogress. This is nearly two miles above the steps by which the\r\ndescent is made; and not a foot of this distance but is wildly\r\nbeautiful. When the river is very low there is a pathway even beyond\r\nthat block; but when this is the case there can hardly be enough of\r\nwater to make the fall satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere is no one special cataract at Trenton which is in itself either\r\nwonderful or pre-eminently beautiful. It is the position, form,\r\ncolour, and rapidity of the river which give the charm. It runs\r\nthrough a deep ravine, at the bottom of which the water has cut\r\nfor itself a channel through the rocks, the sides of which rise\r\nsometimes with the sharpness of the walls of a stone sarcophagus.\r\nThey are rounded too towards the bed, as I have seen the bottom of a\r\nsarcophagus. Along the side of the right bank of the river there is\r\na passage, which when the freshets come is altogether covered. This\r\npassage is sometimes very narrow, but in the narrowest parts an iron\r\nchain is affixed into the rock. It is slippery and wet, and it is\r\nwell for ladies when visiting the place to be provided with outside\r\nindia-rubber shoes, which keep a hold upon the stone. If I remember\r\nrightly there are two actual cataracts, one not far above the steps\r\nby which the descent is made into the channel, and the other close\r\nunder a summer-house, near to which the visitors reascend into\r\nthe wood. But these cataracts, though by no means despicable as\r\ncataracts, leave comparatively a slight impression. They tumble\r\ndown with sufficient violence, and the usual fantastic disposition\r\nof their forces; but simply as cataracts, within a day's journey\r\nof Niagara, they would be nothing. Up beyond the summer-house the\r\npassage along the river can be continued for another mile, but it is\r\nrough, and the climbing in some places rather difficult for ladies.\r\nEvery man, however, who has the use of his legs, should do it, for\r\nthe succession of rapids, and the twistings of the channels, and the\r\nforms of the rocks are as wild and beautiful as the imagination can\r\ndesire. The banks of the river are closely wooded on each side; and\r\nthough this circumstance does not at first seem to add much to the\r\nbeauty, seeing that the ravine is so deep that the absence of wood\r\nabove would hardly be noticed, still there are broken clefts ever and\r\nanon through which the colours of the foliage show themselves, and\r\nstraggling boughs and rough roots break through the rocks here and\r\nthere, and add to the wildness and charm of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe walk back from the summer-house through the wood is very lovely;\r\nbut it would be a disappointing walk to visitors who had been\r\nprevented by a flood in the river from coming up the channel, for it\r\nindicates plainly how requisite it is that the river should be seen\r\nfrom below and not from above. The best view of the larger fall\r\nitself is that seen from the wood. And here again I would point out\r\nthat any male visitor should walk the channel of the river up and\r\ndown. The descent is too slippery and difficult for bipeds laden with\r\npetticoats. We found a small hotel open at Trenton, at which we got\r\na comfortable dinner, and then in the evening were driven back to\r\nUtica.\r\n\r\nAlbany is the capital of the State of New York, and our road from\r\nTrenton to West Point lay through that town; but these political\r\nState capitals have no interest in themselves. The State legislature\r\nwas not sitting, and we went on, merely remarking that the manner in\r\nwhich the railway cars are made to run backward and forward through\r\nthe crowded streets of the town must cause a frequent loss of human\r\nlife. One is led to suppose that children in Albany can hardly have\r\na chance of coming to maturity. Such accidents do not become the\r\nsubject of long-continued and strong comment in the States as they do\r\nwith us; but, nevertheless, I should have thought that such a state\r\nof things as we saw there would have given rise to some remark on the\r\npart of the philanthropists. I cannot myself say that I saw anybody\r\nkilled, and therefore should not be justified in making more than\r\nthis passing remark on the subject.\r\n\r\nWhen first the Americans of the Northern States began to talk much\r\nof their country, their claims as to fine scenery were confined to\r\nNiagara and the Hudson River. Of Niagara, I have spoken, and all\r\nthe world has acknowledged that no claim made on that head can be\r\nregarded as exaggerated. As to the Hudson, I am not prepared to say\r\nso much generally, though there is one spot upon it which cannot be\r\nbeaten for sweetness. I have been up and down the Hudson by water,\r\nand confess that the entire river is pretty. But there is much of\r\nit that is not pre-eminently pretty among rivers. As a whole it\r\ncannot be named with the Upper Mississippi, with the Rhine, with the\r\nMoselle, or with the Upper Rhone. The palisades just out of New York\r\nare pretty, and the whole passage through the mountains from West\r\nPoint up to Catskill and Hudson is interesting. But the glory of the\r\nHudson is at West Point itself; and thither on this occasion we went\r\ndirect by railway, and there we remained for two days. The Catskill\r\nmountains should be seen by a detour off from the river. We did not\r\nvisit them because, here again, the hotel was closed. I will leave\r\nthem therefore for the new handbook which Mr. Murray will soon bring\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOf West Point there is something to be said independently of its\r\nscenery. It is the Sandhurst of the States. Here is their military\r\nschool, from which officers are drafted to their regiments, and the\r\ntuition for military purposes is, I imagine, of a high order. It\r\nmust, of course, be borne in mind that West Point, even as at present\r\narranged, is fitted to the wants of the old army, and not to that of\r\nthe army now required. It can go but a little way to supply officers\r\nfor 500,000 men; but would do much towards supplying them for 40,000.\r\nAt the time of my visit to West Point the regular army of the\r\nnorthern States had not even then swelled itself to the latter\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nI found that there were 220 students at West Point; that about forty\r\ngraduate every year, each of whom receives a commission in the army;\r\nthat about 120 pupils are admitted every year; and that in the course\r\nof every year about eighty either resign, or are called upon to leave\r\non account of some deficiency, or fail in their final examination.\r\nThe result is simply this, that one third of those who enter\r\nsucceeds, and that two thirds fail. The number of failures seemed\r\nto me to be terribly large,--so large as to give great ground of\r\nhesitation to a parent in accepting a nomination for the college.\r\nI especially inquired into the particulars of these dismissals and\r\nresignations, and was assured that the majority of them take place in\r\nthe first year of the pupillage. It is soon seen whether or no a lad\r\nhas the mental and physical capacities necessary for the education\r\nand future life required of him, and care is taken that those shall\r\nbe removed early as to whom it may be determined that the necessary\r\ncapacity is clearly wanting. If this is done,--and I do not doubt\r\nit,--the evil is much mitigated. The effect otherwise would be very\r\ninjurious. The lads remain till they are perhaps one and twenty,\r\nand have then acquired aptitudes for military life, but no other\r\naptitudes. At that age the education cannot be commenced anew, and,\r\nmoreover, at that age the disgrace of failure is very injurious.\r\nThe period of education used to be five years, but has now been\r\nreduced to four. This was done in order that a double class might be\r\ngraduated in 1861 to supply the wants of the war. I believe it is\r\nconsidered that but for such necessity as that, the fifth year of\r\neducation can be ill spared.\r\n\r\nThe discipline, to our English ideas, is very strict. In the first\r\nplace no kind of beer, wine, or spirits is allowed at West Point. The\r\nlaw upon this point may be said to be very vehement, for it debars\r\neven the visitors at the hotel from the solace of a glass of beer.\r\nThe hotel is within the bounds of the College, and as the lads might\r\nbecome purchasers at the bar, there is no bar allowed. Any breach of\r\nthis law leads to instant expulsion; or, I should say rather, any\r\ndetection of such breach. The officer who showed us over the College\r\nassured me that the presence of a glass of wine in a young man's room\r\nwould secure his exclusion, even though there should be no evidence\r\nthat he had tasted it. He was very firm as to this; but a little bird\r\nof West Point, whose information, though not official or probably\r\naccurate in words, seemed to me to be worthy of reliance in general,\r\ntold me that eyes were wont to wink when such glasses of wine made\r\nthemselves unnecessarily visible. Let us fancy an English mess of\r\nyoung men from seventeen to twenty-one, at which a mug of beer would\r\nbe felony, and a glass of wine high treason! But the whole management\r\nof the young with the Americans differs much from that in vogue\r\nwith us. We do not require so much at so early an age, either in\r\nknowledge, in morals, or even in manliness. In America, if a lad be\r\nunder control, as at West Point, he is called upon for an amount of\r\nlabour, and a degree of conduct, which would be considered quite\r\ntranscendental and out of the question in England. But if he be not\r\nunder control, if at the age of eighteen he be living at home, or\r\nbe from his circumstances exempt from professorial power, he is a\r\nfull-fledged man with his pipe apparatus and his bar acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAnd then I was told at West Point how needful and yet how painful\r\nit was that all should be removed who were in any way deficient in\r\ncredit to the establishment. \"Our rules are very exact,\" my informant\r\ntold me; \"but the carrying out of our rules is a task not always very\r\neasy.\" As to this also I had already heard something from that little\r\nbird of West Point, but of course I wisely assented to my informant,\r\nremarking that discipline in such an establishment was essentially\r\nnecessary. The little bird had told me that discipline at West Point\r\nhad been rendered terribly difficult by political interference. \"A\r\nyoung man will be dismissed by the unanimous voice of the Board, and\r\nwill be sent away. And then, after a week or two, he will be sent\r\nback, with an order from Washington, that another trial shall be\r\ngiven him. The lad will march back into the college with all the\r\nhonours of a victory, and will be conscious of a triumph over the\r\nsuperintendent and his officers.\" \"And is that common?\" I asked.\r\n\"Not at the present moment,\" I was told. \"But it was common before\r\nthe war. While Mr. Buchanan, and Mr. Pierce, and Mr. Polk were\r\nPresidents, no officer or board of officers then at West Point was\r\nable to dismiss a lad whose father was a Southerner, and who had\r\nfriends among the Government.\"\r\n\r\nNot only was this true of West Point, but the same allegation is true\r\nas to all matters of patronage throughout the United States. During\r\nthe three or four last Presidencies, and I believe back to the time\r\nof Jackson, there has been an organized system of dishonesty in\r\nthe management of all beneficial places under the control of the\r\nGovernment. I doubt whether any despotic court of Europe has been\r\nso corrupt in the distribution of places,--that is in the selection\r\nof public officers,--as has been the assemblage of statesmen at\r\nWashington. And this is the evil which the country is now expiating\r\nwith its blood and treasure. It has allowed its knaves to stand in\r\nthe high places; and now it finds that knavish works have brought\r\nabout evil results. But of this I shall be constrained to say\r\nsomething further hereafter.\r\n\r\nWe went into all the schools of the College, and made ourselves\r\nfully aware that the amount of learning imparted was far above our\r\ncomprehension. It always occurs to me in looking through the new\r\nschools of the present day, that I ought to be thankful to persons\r\nwho know so much for condescending to speak to me at all in plain\r\nEnglish. I said a word to the gentleman who was with me about horses,\r\nseeing a lot of lads going to their riding lesson. But he was down\r\nupon me, and crushed me instantly beneath the weight of my own\r\nignorance. He walked me up to the image of a horse, which he took to\r\npieces bit by bit, taking off skin, muscle, flesh, nerves and bones,\r\ntill the animal was a heap of atoms, and assured me that the anatomy\r\nof the horse throughout was one of the necessary studies of the\r\nplace. We afterwards went to see the riding. The horses themselves\r\nwere poor enough. This was accounted for by the fact that such of\r\nthem as had been found fit for military service had been taken for\r\nthe use of the army.\r\n\r\nThere is a gallery in the College in which are hung sketches and\r\npictures by former students. I was greatly struck with the merit of\r\nmany of these. There were some copies from well-known works of art\r\nof very high excellence, when the age is taken into account of those\r\nby whom they were done. I don't know how far the art of drawing,\r\nas taught generally and with no special tendency to military\r\ninstruction, may be necessary for military training; but if it be\r\nnecessary I should imagine that more is done in that direction at\r\nWest Point than at Sandhurst. I found, however, that much of that in\r\nthe gallery which was good had been done by lads who had not obtained\r\ntheir degree, and who had shown an aptitude for drawing, but had not\r\nshown any aptitude for other pursuits necessary to their intended\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nAnd then we were taken to the chapel, and there saw, displayed as\r\ntrophies, two of our own dear old English flags. I have seen many a\r\nbanner hung up in token of past victory, and many a flag taken on\r\nthe field of battle mouldering by degrees into dust on some chapel's\r\nwall,--but they have not been the flags of England. Till this\r\nday I had never seen our own colours in any position but one of\r\nself-assertion and independent power. From the tone used by the\r\ngentleman who showed them to me, I could gather that he would have\r\npassed them by had he not foreseen that he could not do so without my\r\nnotice. \"I don't know that we are right to put them there,\" he said.\r\n\"Quite right,\" was my reply, \"as long as the world does such things.\"\r\nIn private life it is vulgar to triumph over one's friends, and\r\nmalicious to triumph over one's enemies. We have not got so far yet\r\nin public life, but I hope we are advancing toward it. In the mean\r\ntime I did not begrudge the Americans our two flags. If we keep flags\r\nand cannons taken from our enemies, and show them about as signs of\r\nour own prowess after those enemies have become friends, why should\r\nnot others do so as regards us? It clearly would not be well for the\r\nworld that we should always beat other nations and never be beaten.\r\nI did not begrudge that chapel our two flags. But nevertheless the\r\nsight of them made me sick in the stomach and uncomfortable. As an\r\nEnglishman I do not want to be ascendant over any one. But it makes\r\nme very ill when any one tries to be ascendant over me. I wish we\r\ncould send back with our compliments all the trophies that we hold,\r\ncarriage paid, and get back in return those two flags and any other\r\nflag or two of our own that may be doing similar duty about the\r\nworld. I take it that the parcel sent away would be somewhat more\r\nbulky than that which would reach us in return.\r\n\r\nThe discipline at West Point seemed, as I have said, to be very\r\nsevere; but it seemed also that that severity could not in all cases\r\nbe maintained. The hours of study also were long, being nearly\r\ncontinuous throughout the day. \"English lads of that age could not\r\ndo it,\" I said; thus confessing that English lads must have in them\r\nless power of sustained work than those of America. \"They must do it\r\nhere,\" said my informant, \"or else leave us.\" And then he took us off\r\nto one of the young gentleman's quarters, in order that we might see\r\nthe nature of their rooms. We found the young gentleman fast asleep\r\non his bed, and felt uncommonly grieved that we should have thus\r\nintruded on him. As the hour was one of those allocated by my\r\ninformant in the distribution of the day to private study, I could\r\nnot but take the present occupation of the embryo warrior as an\r\nindication that the amount of labour required might be occasionally\r\ntoo much even for an American youth. \"The heat makes one so\r\nuncommonly drowsy,\" said the young man. I was not the least surprised\r\nat the exclamation. The air of the apartment had been warmed up to\r\nsuch a pitch by the hot-pipe apparatus of the building that prolonged\r\nlife to me would, I should have thought, be out of the question in\r\nsuch an atmosphere. \"Do you always have it as hot as this?\" I asked.\r\nThe young man swore that it was so, and with considerable energy\r\nexpressed his opinion that all his health and spirits and vitality\r\nwere being baked out of him. He seemed to have a strong opinion on\r\nthe matter, for which I respected him; but it had never occurred to\r\nhim, and did not then occur to him, that anything could be done to\r\nmoderate that deathly flow of hot air which came up to him from the\r\nneighbouring infernal regions. He was pale in the face, and all the\r\nlads there were pale. American lads and lasses are all pale. Men at\r\nthirty and women at twenty-five have had all semblance of youth baked\r\nout of them. Infants even are not rosy, and the only shades known\r\non the cheeks of children are those composed of brown, yellow, and\r\nwhite. All this comes of those damnable hot-air pipes with which\r\nevery tenement in America is infested. \"We cannot do without them,\"\r\nthey say. \"Our cold is so intense that we must heat our houses\r\nthroughout. Open fire-places in a few rooms would not keep our toes\r\nand fingers from the frost.\" There is much in this. The assertion is\r\nno doubt true, and thereby a great difficulty is created. It is no\r\ndoubt quite within the power of American ingenuity to moderate the\r\nheat of these stoves, and to produce such an atmosphere as may be\r\nmost conducive to health. In hospitals no doubt this will be done;\r\nperhaps is done at present,--though even in hospitals I have thought\r\nthe air hotter than it should be. But hot-air-drinking is like\r\ndram-drinking. There is the machine within the house capable of\r\nsupplying any quantity, and those who consume it unconsciously\r\nincrease their draughts, and take their drams stronger and stronger,\r\ntill a breath of fresh air is felt to be a blast direct from Boreas.\r\n\r\nWest Point is at all points a military colony, and as such belongs\r\nexclusively to the Federal Government as separate from the Government\r\nof any individual State. It is the purchased property of the United\r\nStates as a whole, and is devoted to the necessities of a military\r\ncollege. No man could take a house there, or succeed in getting even\r\npermanent lodgings, unless he belonged to or were employed by the\r\nestablishment. There is no intercourse by road between West Point and\r\nother towns or villages on the river side, and any such intercourse\r\neven by water is looked upon with jealousy by the authorities.\r\nThe wish is that West Point should be isolated and kept apart\r\nfor military instruction to the exclusion of all other purposes\r\nwhatever,--especially love-making purposes. The coming over from the\r\nother side of the water of young ladies by the ferry is regarded as a\r\ngreat hindrance. They will come, and then the military students will\r\ntalk to them. We all know to what such talking leads! A lad when I\r\nwas there had been tempted to get out of barracks in plain clothes,\r\nin order that he might call on a young lady at the hotel;--and was\r\nin consequence obliged to abandon his commission and retire from the\r\nAcademy. Will that young lady ever again sleep quietly in her bed?\r\nI should hope not. An opinion was expressed to me that there should\r\nbe no hotel in such a place;--that there should be no ferry, no\r\nroads, no means by which the attention of the students should be\r\ndistracted;--that these military Rasselases should live in a happy\r\nmilitary valley from which might be excluded both strong drinks and\r\nfemale charms,--those two poisons from which youthful military ardour\r\nis supposed to suffer so much.\r\n\r\nIt always seems to me that such training begins at the wrong end.\r\nI will not say that nothing should be done to keep lads of eighteen\r\nfrom strong drinks. I will not even say that there should not be\r\nsome line of moderation with reference to feminine allurements. But\r\nas a rule the restraint should come from the sense, good feeling,\r\nand education of him who is restrained. There is no embargo on the\r\nbeer-shops either at Harrow or at Oxford,--and certainly none upon\r\nthe young ladies. Occasional damage may accrue from habits early\r\ndepraved, or a heart too early and too easily susceptible; but\r\nthe injury so done is not, I think, equal to that inflicted by a\r\nDraconian code of morals, which will probably be evaded, and will\r\ncertainly create a desire for its evasion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I feel assured that West Point, taken as a whole, is an\r\nexcellent military academy, and that young men have gone forth from\r\nit, and will go forth from it, fit for officers as far as training\r\ncan make men fit. The fault, if fault there be, is that which is to\r\nbe found in so many of the institutions of the United States; and is\r\none so allied to a virtue that no foreigner has a right to wonder\r\nthat it is regarded in the light of a virtue by all Americans. There\r\nhas been an attempt to make the place too perfect. In the desire to\r\nhave the establishment self-sufficient at all points, more has been\r\nattempted than human nature can achieve. The lad is taken to West\r\nPoint, and it is presumed that from the moment of his reception, he\r\nshall expend every energy of his mind and body in making himself a\r\nsoldier. At fifteen he is not to be a boy, at twenty he is not to be\r\na young man. He is to be a gentleman, a soldier, and an officer. I\r\nbelieve that those who leave the College for the army are gentlemen,\r\nsoldiers, and officers, and therefore the result is good. But they\r\nare also young men; and it seems that they have become so, not in\r\naccordance with their training, but in spite of it.\r\n\r\nBut I have another complaint to make against the authorities of\r\nWest Point, which they will not be able to answer so easily as\r\nthat already preferred. What right can they have to take the\r\nvery prettiest spot on the Hudson--the prettiest spot on the\r\ncontinent--one of the prettiest spots which Nature, with all her\r\nvagaries, ever formed--and shut it up from all the world for purposes\r\nof war? Would not any plain, however ugly, do for military exercises?\r\nCannot broadsword, goose-step, and double quick time be instilled\r\ninto young hands and legs in any field of thirty, forty, or fifty\r\nacres? I wonder whether these lads appreciate the fact that they are\r\nstudying fourteen hours a day amidst the sweetest river, rock, and\r\nmountain scenery that the imagination can conceive. Of course it\r\nwill be said that the world at large is not excluded from West Point,\r\nthat the ferry to the place is open, and that there is even a hotel\r\nthere, closed against no man or woman who will consent to become a\r\nteetotaller for the period of his visit. I must admit that this is\r\nso; but still one feels that one is only admitted as a guest. I want\r\nto go and live at West Point, and why should I be prevented? The\r\nGovernment had a right to buy it of course, but Government should\r\nnot buy up the prettiest spots on a country's surface. If I were an\r\nAmerican I should make a grievance of this; but Americans will suffer\r\nthings from their Government which no Englishmen would endure.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the peculiarities of West Point that every thing there\r\nis in good taste. The Point itself consists of a bluff of land so\r\nformed that the river Hudson is forced to run round three sides of\r\nit. It is consequently a peninsula, and as the surrounding country is\r\nmountainous on both sides of the river, it may be imagined that the\r\nsite is good. The views both up and down the river are lovely, and\r\nthe mountains behind break themselves so as to make the landscape\r\nperfect. But this is not all. At West Point there is much of\r\nbuildings, much of military arrangement in the way of cannons, forts,\r\nand artillery yards. All these things are so contrived as to group\r\nthemselves well into pictures. There is no picture of architectural\r\ngrandeur; but everything stands well and where it should stand, and\r\nthe eye is not hurt at any spot. I regard West Point as a delightful\r\nplace, and was much gratified by the kindness I received there.\r\n\r\nFrom West Point we went direct to New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAN APOLOGY FOR THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it may be received as a fact that the Northern States, taken\r\ntogether, sent a full tenth of their able-bodied men into the ranks\r\nof the army in the course of the summer and autumn of 1861. The\r\nSouth, no doubt, sent a much larger proportion; but the effect of\r\nsuch a drain upon the South would not be the same, because the slaves\r\nwere left at home to perform the agricultural work of the country. I\r\nvery much doubt whether any other nation ever made such an effort\r\nin so short a time. To a people who can do this it may well be\r\ngranted that they are in earnest; and I do not think it should be\r\nlightly decided by any foreigner that they are wrong. The strong and\r\nunanimous impulse of a great people is seldom wrong. And let it be\r\nborne in mind that in this case both people may be right,--the people\r\nboth of North and South. Each may have been guided by a just and\r\nnoble feeling; though each was brought to its present condition by\r\nbad government and dishonest statesmen.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, since the commencement of the war, the\r\nAmerican feeling against England has been very bitter. All Americans\r\nto whom I spoke on the subject admitted that it was so. I, as an\r\nEnglishman, felt strongly the injustice of this feeling, and lost\r\nno opportunity of showing or endeavouring to show that the line of\r\nconduct pursued by England towards the States was the only line which\r\nwas compatible with her own policy and just interests, and also with\r\nthe dignity of the States' Government. I heard much of the tender\r\nsympathy of Russia. Russia sent a flourishing general message, saying\r\nthat she wished the North might win, and ending with some good\r\ngeneral advice, proposing peace. It was such a message as strong\r\nnations send to those which are weaker. Had England ventured on such\r\ncounsel the diplomatic paper would probably have been returned to\r\nher. It is, I think, manifest that an absolute and disinterested\r\nneutrality has been the only course which could preserve England from\r\ndeserved rebuke,--a neutrality on which her commercial necessity for\r\nimporting cotton or exporting her own manufactures should have no\r\neffect. That our Government would preserve such a neutrality I have\r\nalways insisted, and I believe it has been done with a pure and\r\nstrict disregard to any selfish views on the part of Great Britain.\r\nSo far I think England may feel that she has done well in this\r\nmatter. But I must confess that I have not been so proud of the tone\r\nof all our people at home as I have been of the decisions of our\r\nstatesmen. It seems to me that some of us never tire in abusing the\r\nAmericans, and calling them names for having allowed themselves to\r\nbe driven into this civil war. We tell them that they are fools and\r\nidiots; we speak of their doings as though there had been some plain\r\ncourse by which the war might have been avoided; and we throw it in\r\ntheir teeth that they have no capability for war. We tell them of\r\nthe debt which they are creating, and point out to them that they\r\ncan never pay it. We laugh at their attempt to sustain loyalty, and\r\nspeak of them as a steady father of a family is wont to speak of some\r\nunthrifty prodigal who is throwing away his estate and hurrying from\r\none ruinous debauchery to another. And, alas! we too frequently allow\r\nto escape from us some expression of that satisfaction which one\r\nrival tradesman has in the downfall of another. \"Here you are with\r\nall your boasting,\" is what we say. \"You were going to whip all\r\ncreation the other day; and it has come to this! Brag is a good\r\ndog, but Holdfast is a better. Pray remember that, if ever you find\r\nyourselves on your legs again.\" That little advice about the two\r\ndogs is very well, and was not altogether inapplicable. But this\r\nis not the time in which it should be given. Putting aside slight\r\nasperities, we will all own that the people of the States have\r\nbeen and are our friends, and that as friends we cannot spare them.\r\nFor one Englishman who brings home to his own heart a feeling of\r\ncordiality for France--a belief in the affection of our French\r\nalliance--there are ten who do so with reference to the States. Now,\r\nin these days of their trouble, I think that we might have borne with\r\nthem more tenderly.\r\n\r\nAnd how was it possible that they should have avoided this war? I\r\nwill not now go into the cause of it, or discuss the course which it\r\nhas taken, but will simply take up the fact of the rebellion. The\r\nSouth rebelled against the North, and such being the case, was it\r\npossible that the North should yield without a war? It may very\r\nlikely be well that Hungary should be severed from Austria, or Poland\r\nfrom Russia, or Venice from Austria. Taking Englishmen in a lump,\r\nthey think that such separation would be well. The subject people do\r\nnot speak the language of those that govern them, or enjoy kindred\r\ninterests. But yet when military efforts are made by those who govern\r\nHungary, Poland, and Venice to prevent such separation, we do not\r\nsay that Russia and Austria are fools. We are not surprised that\r\nthey should take up arms against the rebels, but would be very much\r\nsurprised indeed if they did not do so. We know that nothing but\r\nweakness would prevent their doing so. But if Austria and Russia\r\ninsist on tying to themselves a people who do not speak their\r\nlanguage or live in accordance with their habits, and are not\r\nconsidered unreasonable in so insisting, how much more thoroughly\r\nwould they carry with them the sympathy of their neighbours\r\nin preventing any secession by integral parts of their own\r\nnationalities? Would England let Ireland walk off by herself if\r\nshe wished it? In 1843 she did wish it. Three-fourths of the Irish\r\npopulation would have voted for such a separation; but England would\r\nhave prevented such secession _vi et armis_ had Ireland driven her to\r\nthe necessity of such prevention.\r\n\r\nI will put it to any reader of history whether, since government\r\ncommenced, it has not been regarded as the first duty of government\r\nto prevent a separation of the territories governed, and whether also\r\nit has not been regarded as a point of honour with all nationalities\r\nto preserve uninjured each its own greatness and its own power? I\r\ntrust that I may not be thought to argue that all governments or even\r\nall nationalities should succeed in such endeavours. Few kings have\r\nfallen in my day in whose fate I have not rejoiced; none, I take it,\r\nexcept that poor citizen King of the French. And I can rejoice that\r\nEngland lost her American colonies, and shall rejoice when Spain has\r\nbeen deprived of Cuba. But I hold that citizen King of the French in\r\nsmall esteem, seeing that he made no fight, and I know that England\r\nwas bound to struggle when the Boston people threw her tea into the\r\nwater. Spain keeps a tighter hand on Cuba than we thought she would\r\nsome ten years since, and therefore she stands higher in the world's\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nIt may be well that the South should be divided from the North. I am\r\ninclined to think that it would be well--at any rate for the North;\r\nbut the South must have been aware that such division could only\r\nbe effected in two ways: either by agreement,--in which case the\r\nproposition must have been brought forward by the South and discussed\r\nby the North,--or by violence. They chose the latter way, as being\r\nthe readier and the surer, as most seceding nations have done.\r\nO'Connell, when struggling for the secession of Ireland, chose the\r\nother, and nothing came of it. The South chose violence, and prepared\r\nfor it secretly and with great adroitness. If that be not rebellion\r\nthere never has been rebellion since history began; and if civil\r\nwar was ever justified in one portion of a nation by turbulence in\r\nanother, it has now been justified in the northern States of America.\r\n\r\nWhat was the North to do; this foolish North, which has been so\r\nliberally told by us that she has taken up arms for nothing, that she\r\nis fighting for nothing, and will ruin herself for nothing? When was\r\nshe to take the first step towards peace? Surely every Englishman\r\nwill remember that when the earliest tidings of the coming quarrel\r\nreached us on the election of Mr. Lincoln, we all declared that any\r\ndivision was impossible;--it was a mere madness to speak of it. The\r\nStates, which were so great in their unity, would never consent to\r\nbreak up all their prestige and all their power by a separation!\r\nWould it have been well for the North then to say, \"If the South wish\r\nit we will certainly separate?\" After that, when Mr. Lincoln assumed\r\nthe power to which he had been elected, and declared with sufficient\r\nmanliness, and sufficient dignity also, that he would make no war\r\nupon the South, but would collect the customs and carry on the\r\ngovernment, did we turn round and advise him that he was wrong? No.\r\nThe idea in England then was that his message was, if anything, too\r\nmild. \"If he means to be President of the whole Union,\" England said,\r\n\"he must come out with something stronger than that.\" Then came Mr.\r\nSeward's speech, which was, in truth, weak enough. Mr. Seward had ran\r\nMr. Lincoln very hard for the President's chair on the republican\r\ninterest, and was--most unfortunately, as I think--made Secretary\r\nof State by Mr. Lincoln, or by his party. The Secretary of State\r\nholds the highest office in the United States Government under the\r\nPresident. He cannot be compared to our Prime Minister, seeing\r\nthat the President himself exercises political power, and is\r\nresponsible for its exercise. Mr. Seward's speech simply amounted to\r\na declaration that separation was a thing of which the Union would\r\nneither hear, speak, nor, if possible, think. Things looked very like\r\nit; but no; they could never come to that! The world was too good,\r\nand especially the American world. Mr. Seward had no specific against\r\nsecession; but let every free man strike his breast, look up to\r\nheaven, determine to be good, and all would go right. A great deal\r\nhad been expected from Mr. Seward, and when this speech came out, we\r\nin England were a little disappointed, and nobody presumed even then\r\nthat the North would let the South go.\r\n\r\nIt will be argued by those who have gone into the details of American\r\npolitics that an acceptance of the Crittenden compromise at this\r\npoint would have saved the war. What is or was the Crittenden\r\ncompromise I will endeavour to explain hereafter; but the terms and\r\nmeaning of that compromise can have no bearing on the subject. The\r\nrepublican party who were in power disapproved of that compromise,\r\nand could not model their course upon it. The republican party may\r\nhave been right or may have been wrong; but surely it will not be\r\nargued that any political party elected to power by a majority should\r\nfollow the policy of a minority, lest that minority should rebel.\r\nI can conceive of no government more lowly placed than one which\r\ndeserts the policy of the majority which supports it, fearing either\r\nthe tongues or arms of a minority.\r\n\r\nAs the next scene in the play, the State of South Carolina bombarded\r\nFort Sumter. Was that to be the moment for a peaceable separation?\r\nLet us suppose that O'Connell had marched down to the Pigeon House at\r\nDublin, and had taken it--in 1843, let us say--would that have been\r\nan argument to us for allowing Ireland to set up for herself? Is\r\nthat the way of men's minds, or of the minds of nations? The powers\r\nof the President were defined by law, as agreed upon among all the\r\nStates of the Union, and against that power and against that law,\r\nSouth Carolina raised her hand, and the other States joined her in\r\nrebellion. When circumstances had come to that, it was no longer\r\npossible that the North should shun the war. To my thinking the\r\nrights of rebellion are holy. Where would the world have been,\r\nor where would the world hope to be, without rebellion? But let\r\nrebellion look the truth in the face, and not blanch from its own\r\nconsequences. She has to judge her own opportunities and to decide on\r\nher own fitness. Success is the test of her judgment. But rebellion\r\ncan never be successful except by overcoming the power against which\r\nshe raises herself. She has no right to expect bloodless triumphs;\r\nand if she be not the stronger in the encounter which she creates,\r\nshe must bear the penalty of her rashness. Rebellion is justified\r\nby being better served than constituted authority, but cannot be\r\njustified otherwise. Now and again it may happen that rebellion's\r\ncause is so good that constituted authority will fall to the ground\r\nat the first glance of her sword. This was so the other day in\r\nNaples, when Garibaldi blew away the king's armies with a breath. But\r\nthis is not so often. Rebellion knows that it must fight, and the\r\nlegalized power against which rebels rise must of necessity fight\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nI cannot see at what point the North first sinned; nor do I think\r\nthat had the North yielded, England would have honoured her for her\r\nmeekness. Had she yielded without striking a blow she would have\r\nbeen told that she had suffered the Union to drop asunder by her\r\nsupineness. She would have been twitted with cowardice, and told\r\nthat she was no match for Southern energy. It would then have seemed\r\nto those who sat in judgment on her that she might have righted\r\neverything by that one blow from which she had abstained. But having\r\nstruck that one blow, and having found that it did not suffice, could\r\nshe then withdraw, give way, and own herself beaten? Has it been so\r\nusually with Anglo-Saxon pluck? In such case as that would there have\r\nbeen no mention of those two dogs, Brag and Holdfast? The man of the\r\nnorthern States knows that he has bragged,--bragged as loudly as his\r\nEnglish forefathers. In that matter of bragging the British lion and\r\nthe Star-spangled banner may abstain from throwing mud at each other.\r\nAnd now the northern man wishes to show that he can hold fast also.\r\nLooking at all this I cannot see that peace has been possible to the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of secession and rebellion being one and the\r\nsame thing, the point to me does not seem to bear an argument. The\r\nconfederation of States had a common army, a common policy, a common\r\ncapital, a common government, and a common debt. If one might secede,\r\nany or all might secede, and where then would be their property,\r\ntheir debt, and their servants? A confederation with such a license\r\nattached to it would have been simply playing at national power.\r\nIf New York had seceded--a State which stretches from the Atlantic\r\nto British North America--it would have cut New England off from\r\nthe rest of the Union. Was it legally within the power of New York\r\nto place the six States of New England in such a position? And\r\nwhy should it be assumed that so suicidal a power of destroying a\r\nnationality should be inherent in every portion of the nation? The\r\nStates are bound together by a written compact, but that compact\r\ngives each State no such power. Surely such a power would have been\r\nspecified had it been intended that it should be given. But there are\r\naxioms in politics as in mathematics, which recommend themselves to\r\nthe mind at once, and require no argument for their proof. Men who\r\nare not argumentative perceive at once that they are true. A part\r\ncannot be greater than the whole.\r\n\r\nI think it is plain that the remnant of the Union was bound to take\r\nup arms against those States which had illegally torn themselves off\r\nfrom her; and if so, she could only do so with such weapons as were\r\nat her hand. The United States' army had never been numerous or well\r\nappointed; and of such officers and equipments as it possessed, the\r\nmore valuable part was in the hands of the Southerners. It was clear\r\nenough that she was ill-provided, and that in going to war she was\r\nundertaking a work as to which she had still to learn many of the\r\nrudiments. But Englishmen should be the last to twit her with such\r\nignorance. It is not yet ten years since we were all boasting that\r\nswords and guns were useless things, and that military expenditure\r\nmight be cut down to any minimum figure that an economizing\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer could name. Since that we have\r\nextemporized two, if not three armies. There are our volunteers at\r\nhome; and the army which holds India can hardly be considered as one\r\nwith that which is to maintain our prestige in Europe and the West.\r\nWe made some natural blunders in the Crimea, but in making those\r\nblunders we taught ourselves the trade. It is the misfortune of the\r\nnorthern States that they must learn these lessons in fighting their\r\nown countrymen. In the course of our history we have suffered the\r\nsame calamity more than once. The Roundheads, who beat the Cavaliers\r\nand created English liberty, made themselves soldiers on the bodies\r\nof their countrymen. But England was not ruined by that civil war;\r\nnor was she ruined by those which preceded it. From out of these she\r\ncame forth stronger than she entered them,--stronger, better, and\r\nmore fit for a great destiny in the history of nations. The northern\r\nStates had nearly five hundred thousand men under arms when the\r\nwinter of 1861 commenced, and for that enormous multitude all\r\ncommissariat requirements were well supplied. Camps and barracks\r\nsprang up through the country as though by magic. Clothing was\r\nobtained with a rapidity that has, I think, never been equalled. The\r\ncountry had not been prepared for the fabrication of arms, and yet\r\narms were put into the men's hands almost as quickly as the regiments\r\ncould be mustered. The eighteen millions of the northern States lent\r\nthemselves to the effort as one man. Each State gave the best it had\r\nto give. Newspapers were as rabid against each other as ever, but\r\nno newspaper could live which did not support the war. \"The South\r\nhas rebelled against the law, and the law shall be supported.\" This\r\nhas been the cry and the heartfelt feeling of all men; and it is a\r\nfeeling which cannot but inspire respect.\r\n\r\nWe have heard much of the tyranny of the present Government of the\r\nUnited States, and of the tyranny also of the people. They have both\r\nbeen very tyrannical. The \"habeas corpus\" has been suspended by the\r\nword of one man. Arrests have been made on men who have been hardly\r\nsuspected of more than secession principles. Arrests have, I believe,\r\nbeen made in cases which have been destitute even of any fair ground\r\nfor such suspicion. Newspapers have been stopped for advocating views\r\nopposed to the feelings of the North, as freely as newspapers were\r\never stopped in France for opposing the Emperor. A man has not been\r\nsafe in the streets who was known to be a Secessionist. It must be at\r\nonce admitted that opinion in the northern States was not free when I\r\nwas there. But has opinion ever been free anywhere on all subjects?\r\nIn the best-built strongholds of freedom have there not always been\r\nquestions on which opinion has not been free; and must it not always\r\nbe so? When the decision of a people on any matter has become, so\r\nto say, unanimous,--when it has shown itself to be so general as\r\nto be clearly the expression of the nation's voice as a single\r\nchorus,--that decision becomes holy, and may not be touched. Could\r\nany newspaper be produced in England which advocated the overthrow\r\nof the Queen? And why may not the passion for the Union be as strong\r\nwith the northern States, as the passion for the Crown is strong with\r\nus? The Crown with us is in no danger, and therefore the matter is at\r\nrest. But I think we must admit that in any nation, let it be ever\r\nso free, there may be points on which opinion must be held under\r\nrestraint. And as to those summary arrests, and the suspension of the\r\n\"habeas corpus,\" is there not something to be said for the States'\r\nGovernment on that head also? Military arrests are very dreadful,\r\nand the soul of a nation's liberty is that personal freedom from\r\narbitrary interference which is signified to the world by those two\r\nunintelligible Latin words. A man's body shall not be kept in duress\r\nat any man's will; but shall be brought up into open court, with\r\nuttermost speed, in order that the law may say whether or no it\r\nshould be kept in duress. That I take it is the meaning of \"habeas\r\ncorpus,\" and it is easy to see that the suspension of that privilege\r\ndestroys all freedom, and places the liberty of every individual at\r\nthe mercy of him who has the power to suspend it. Nothing can be\r\nworse than this; and such suspension, if extended over any long\r\nperiod of years, will certainly make a nation weak, mean-spirited,\r\nand poor. But in a period of civil war, or even of a widely-extended\r\ncivil commotion, things cannot work in their accustomed grooves. A\r\nlady does not willingly get out of her bedroom-window with nothing on\r\nbut her nightgown; but when her house is on fire she is very thankful\r\nfor an opportunity of doing so. It is not long since the \"habeas\r\ncorpus\" was suspended in parts of Ireland, and absurd arrests were\r\nmade almost daily when that suspension first took effect. It was\r\ngrievous that there should be necessity for such a step, and it is\r\nvery grievous now that such necessity should be felt in the northern\r\nStates. But I do not think that it becomes Englishmen to bear\r\nhardly upon Americans generally for what has been done in that\r\nmatter. Mr. Seward, in an official letter to the British Minister at\r\nWashington--which letter, through official dishonesty, found its way\r\nto the press--claimed for the President the right of suspending the\r\n\"habeas corpus\" in the States whenever it might seem good to him\r\nto do so. If this be in accordance with the law of the land, which\r\nI think must be doubted, the law of the land is not favourable to\r\nfreedom. For myself, I conceive that Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward have\r\nbeen wrong in their law, and that no such right is given to the\r\nPresident by the Constitution of the United States. This I will\r\nattempt to prove in some subsequent chapter. But I think it must be\r\nfelt by all who have given any thought to the constitution of the\r\nStates, that let what may be the letter of the law, the Presidents of\r\nthe United States have had no such power. It is because the States\r\nhave been no longer united that Mr. Lincoln has had the power,\r\nwhether it be given to him by the law or no.\r\n\r\nAnd then as to the debt; it seems to me very singular that we in\r\nEngland should suppose that a great commercial people would be ruined\r\nby a national debt. As regards ourselves, I have always looked on our\r\nnational debt as the ballast in our ship. We have a great deal of\r\nballast, but then the ship is very big. The States also are taking in\r\nballast at a rather rapid rate;--and we too took it in quickly when\r\nwe were about it. But I cannot understand why their ship should not\r\ncarry, without shipwreck, that which our ship has carried without\r\ndamage, and, as I believe, with positive advantage to its sailing.\r\nThe ballast, if carried honestly, will not, I think, bring the vessel\r\nto grief. The fear is lest the ballast should be thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nSo much I have said, wishing to plead the cause of the northern\r\nStates before the bar of English opinion, and thinking that there is\r\nground for a plea in their favour. But yet I cannot say that their\r\nbitterness against Englishmen has been justified, or that their tone\r\ntowards England has been dignified. Their complaint is that they\r\nhave received no sympathy from England; but it seems to me that a\r\ngreat nation should not require an expression of sympathy during its\r\nstruggle. Sympathy is for the weak rather than for the strong. When\r\nI hear two powerful men contending together in argument, I do not\r\nsympathize with him who has the best of it; but I watch the precision\r\nof his logic, and acknowledge the effects of his rhetoric. There has\r\nbeen a whining weakness in the complaints made by Americans against\r\nEngland, which has done more to lower them as a people in my judgment\r\nthan any other part of their conduct during the present crisis. When\r\nwe were at war with Russia, the feeling of the States was strongly\r\nagainst us. All their wishes were with our enemies. When the Indian\r\nmutiny was at its worst, the feeling of France was equally adverse to\r\nus. The joy expressed by the French newspapers was almost ecstatic.\r\nBut I do not think that on either occasion we bemoaned ourselves\r\nsadly on the want of sympathy shown by our friends. On each occasion\r\nwe took the opinion expressed for what it was worth, and managed to\r\nlive it down. We listened to what was said, and let it pass by. When\r\nin each case we had been successful, there was an end of our friends'\r\ncroakings.\r\n\r\nBut in the northern States of America the bitterness against England\r\nhas amounted almost to a passion. The players, those chroniclers of\r\nthe time, have had no hits so sure as those which have been aimed\r\nat Englishmen as cowards, fools, and liars. No paper has dared to\r\nsay that England has been true in her American policy. The name\r\nof an Englishman has been made a byword for reproach. In private\r\nintercourse private amenities have remained. I, at any rate, may\r\nboast that such has been the case as regards myself. But even in\r\nprivate life I have been unable to keep down the feeling that I have\r\nalways been walking over smothered ashes.\r\n\r\nIt may be that, when the civil war in America is over, all this will\r\npass by, and there will be nothing left of international bitterness\r\nbut its memory. It is sincerely to be hoped that this may be\r\nso;--that even the memory of the existing feeling may fade away and\r\nbecome unreal. I for one cannot think that two nations, situated as\r\nare the States and England, should permanently quarrel and avoid each\r\nother. But words have been spoken which will, I fear, long sound in\r\nmen's ears, and thoughts have sprung up which will not easily allow\r\nthemselves to be extinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of New York as a traveller I have two faults to find with\r\nit. In the first place there is nothing to see; and in the second\r\nplace there is no mode of getting about to see anything. Nevertheless\r\nNew York is a most interesting city. It is the third biggest city\r\nin the known world;--for those Chinese congregations of unwinged\r\nants are not cities in the known world. In no other city is there\r\na population so mixed and cosmopolitan in their modes of life. And\r\nyet in no other city that I have seen are there such strong and\r\never-visible characteristics of the social and political bearings of\r\nthe nation to which it belongs. New York appears to me as infinitely\r\nmore American than Boston, Chicago, or Washington. It has no peculiar\r\nattribute of its own, as have those three cities; Boston in its\r\nliterature and accomplished intelligence, Chicago in its internal\r\ntrade, and Washington in its congressional and State politics.\r\nNew York has its literary aspirations, its commercial grandeur,\r\nand,--heaven knows,--it has its politics also. But these do not\r\nstrike the visitor as being specially characteristic of the city.\r\nThat it is pre-eminently American is its glory or its disgrace,--as\r\nmen of different ways of thinking may decide upon it. Free\r\ninstitutions, general education, and the ascendancy of dollars are\r\nthe words written on every paving-stone along Fifth Avenue, down\r\nBroadway, and up Wall Street. Every man can vote, and values the\r\nprivilege. Every man can read, and uses the privilege. Every man\r\nworships the dollar, and is down before his shrine from morning to\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAs regards voting and reading no American will be angry with me\r\nfor saying so much of him; and no Englishman, whatever may be his\r\nideas as to the franchise in his own country, will conceive that\r\nI have said aught to the dishonour of an American. But as to that\r\ndollar-worshipping, it will of course seem that I am abusing the New\r\nYorkers. We all know what a wretchedly wicked thing money is! How it\r\nstands between us and heaven! How it hardens our hearts, and makes\r\nvulgar our thoughts! Dives has ever gone to the devil, while Lazarus\r\nhas been laid up in heavenly lavender. The hand that employs itself\r\nin compelling gold to enter the service of man has always been\r\nstigmatized as the ravisher of things sacred. The world is agreed\r\nabout that, and therefore the New Yorker is in a bad way. There\r\nare very few citizens in any town known to me which under this\r\ndispensation are in a good way, but the New Yorker is in about the\r\nworst way of all. Other men, the world over, worship regularly at the\r\nshrine with matins and vespers, nones and complines, and whatever\r\nother daily services may be known to the religious houses; but the\r\nNew Yorker is always on his knees.\r\n\r\nThat is the amount of the charge which I bring against New York;\r\nand now having laid on my paint thickly, I shall proceed, like an\r\nunskilful artist, to scrape a great deal of it off again. New York\r\nhas been a leading commercial city in the world for not more than\r\nfifty or sixty years. As far as I can learn, its population at the\r\nclose of the last century did not exceed 60,000, and ten years later\r\nit had not reached 100,000. In 1860 it had reached nearly 800,000 in\r\nthe city of New York itself. To this number must be added the numbers\r\nof Brooklyn, Williamsburgh, and the city of New Jersey, in order\r\nthat a true conception may be had of the population of this American\r\nmetropolis, seeing that those places are as much a part of New York\r\nas Southwark is of London. By this the total will be swelled to\r\nconsiderably above a million. It will no doubt be admitted that this\r\ngrowth has been very fast, and that New York may well be proud of it.\r\nIncrease of population is, I take it, the only trustworthy sign of\r\na nation's success or of a city's success. We boast that London has\r\nbeaten the other cities of the world, and think that that boast is\r\nenough to cover all the social sins for which London has to confess\r\nher guilt. New York beginning with 60,000 sixty years since has now a\r\nmillion souls;--a million mouths, all of which eat a sufficiency of\r\nbread, all of which speak _ore rotundo_, and almost all of which can\r\nread. And this has come of its love of dollars.\r\n\r\nFor myself I do not believe that Dives is so black as he is painted,\r\nor that his peril is so imminent. To reconcile such an opinion with\r\nholy writ might place me in some difficulty were I a clergyman.\r\nClergymen in these days are surrounded by difficulties of this\r\nnature, finding it necessary to explain away many old-established\r\nteachings which narrowed the Christian Church, and to open the\r\ndoor wide enough to satisfy the aspirations and natural hopes\r\nof instructed men. The brethren of Dives are now so many and so\r\nintelligent that they will no longer consent to be damned without\r\nlooking closely into the matter themselves. I will leave them to\r\nsettle the matter with the Church, merely assuring them of my\r\nsympathies in their little difficulties in any case in which mere\r\nmoney causes the hitch.\r\n\r\nTo eat his bread in the sweat of his brow was man's curse in Adam's\r\nday, but is certainly man's blessing in our day. And what is eating\r\none's bread in the sweat of one's brow but making money? I will\r\nbelieve no man who tells me that he would not sooner earn two loaves\r\nthan one;--and if two, then two hundred. I will believe no man who\r\ntells me that he would sooner earn one dollar a day than two;--and\r\nif two, then two hundred. That is, in the very nature of the\r\nargument,--_coeteris paribus_. When a man tells me that he would\r\nprefer one honest loaf to two that are dishonest, I will, in all\r\npossible cases, believe him. So also a man may prefer one quiet loaf\r\nto two that are unquiet. But under circumstances that are the same,\r\nand to a man who is sane, a whole loaf is better than half, and two\r\nloaves are better than one. The preachers have preached well, but on\r\nthis matter they have preached in vain. Dives has never believed that\r\nhe will be damned because he is Dives. He has never even believed\r\nthat the temptations incident to his position have been more than a\r\nfair counterpoise, or even so much as a fair counterpoise, to his\r\nopportunities for doing good. All men who work desire to prosper\r\nby their work, and they so desire by the nature given to them from\r\nGod. Wealth and progress must go on hand in hand together, let the\r\naccidents which occasionally divide them for a time happen as often\r\nas they may. The progress of the Americans has been caused by their\r\naptitude for money-making, and that continual kneeling at the shrine\r\nof the coined goddess has carried them across from New York to San\r\nFrancisco. Men who kneel at that shrine are called on to have ready\r\nwits, and quick hands, and not a little aptitude for self-denial. The\r\nNew Yorker has been true to his dollar, because his dollar has been\r\ntrue to him.\r\n\r\nBut not on this account can I, nor on this account will any\r\nEnglishman, reconcile himself to the savour of dollars which pervades\r\nthe atmosphere of New York. The _ars celare artem_ is wanting. The\r\nmaking of money is the work of man; but he need not take his work\r\nto bed with him, and have it ever by his side at table, amidst his\r\nfamily, in church, while he disports himself, as he declares his\r\npassion to the girl of his heart, in the moments of his softest\r\nbliss, and at the periods of his most solemn ceremonies. That many\r\ndo so elsewhere than in New York,--in London, for instance, in Paris,\r\namong the mountains of Switzerland, and the steppes of Russia, I\r\ndo not doubt. But there is generally a veil thrown over the object\r\nof the worshipper's idolatry. In New York one's ear is constantly\r\nfilled with the fanatic's voice as he prays, one's eyes are always\r\non the familiar altar. The frankincense from the temple is ever in\r\none's nostrils. I have never walked down Fifth Avenue alone without\r\nthinking of money. I have never walked there with a companion without\r\ntalking of it. I fancy that every man there, in order to maintain the\r\nspirit of the place, should bear on his forehead a label stating how\r\nmany dollars he is worth, and that every label should be expected to\r\nassert a falsehood.\r\n\r\nI do not think that New York has been less generous in the use of its\r\nmoney than other cities, or that the men of New York generally are\r\nso. Perhaps I might go farther and say that in no city has more been\r\nachieved for humanity by the munificence of its richest citizens than\r\nin New York. Its hospitals, asylums, and institutions for the relief\r\nof all ailments to which flesh is heir, are very numerous, and beyond\r\npraise in the excellence of their arrangements. And this has been\r\nachieved in a great degree by private liberality. Men in America\r\nare not as a rule anxious to leave large fortunes to their children.\r\nThe millionaire when making his will very generally gives back a\r\nconsiderable portion of the wealth which he has made to the city in\r\nwhich he made it. The rich citizen is always anxious that the poor\r\ncitizen shall be relieved. It is a point of honour with him to raise\r\nthe character of his municipality, and to provide that the deaf and\r\ndumb, the blind, the mad, the idiots, the old, and the incurable\r\nshall have such alleviation in their misfortune as skill and kindness\r\ncan afford.\r\n\r\nNor is the New Yorker a hugger-mugger with his money. He does not\r\nhide up his dollars in old stockings and keep rolls of gold in hidden\r\npots. He does not even invest it where it will not grow but only\r\nproduce small though sure fruit. He builds houses, he speculates\r\nlargely, he spreads himself in trade to the extent of his wings,--and\r\nnot seldom somewhat further. He scatters his wealth broadcast over\r\nstrange fields, trusting that it may grow with an increase of an\r\nhundred-fold, but bold to bear the loss should the strange field\r\nprove itself barren. His regret at losing his money is by no means\r\ncommensurate with his desire to make it. In this there is a living\r\nspirit which to me divests the dollar-worshipping idolatry of\r\nsomething of its ugliness. The hand when closed on the gold is\r\ninstantly reopened. The idolator is anxious to get, but he is anxious\r\nalso to spend. He is energetic to the last, and has no comfort\r\nwith his stock unless it breeds with transatlantic rapidity of\r\nprocreation.\r\n\r\nSo much I say, being anxious to scrape off some of that daub of\r\nblack paint with which I have smeared the face of my New Yorker; but\r\nnot desiring to scrape it all off. For myself, I do not love to\r\nlive amidst the clink of gold, and never have \"a good time,\" as the\r\nAmericans say, when the price of shares and percentages come up in\r\nconversation. That state of men's minds here which I have endeavoured\r\nto explain tends, I think, to make New York disagreeable. A stranger\r\nthere who has no great interest in percentages soon finds himself\r\nanxious to escape. By degrees he perceives that he is out of his\r\nelement, and had better go away. He calls at the bank, and when he\r\nshows himself ignorant as to the price at which his sovereigns should\r\nbe done, he is conscious that he is ridiculous. He is like a man who\r\ngoes out hunting for the first time at forty years of age. He feels\r\nhimself to be in the wrong place, and is anxious to get out of it.\r\nSuch was my experience of New York, at each of the visits that I paid\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nBut yet, I say again, no other American city is so intensely American\r\nas New York. It is generally considered that the inhabitants of\r\nNew England, the Yankees properly so called, have the American\r\ncharacteristics of physiognomy in the fullest degree. The lantern\r\njaws, the thin and lithe body, the dry face on which there has\r\nbeen no tint of the rose since the baby's long-clothes were first\r\nabandoned, the harsh, thick hair, the thin lips, the intelligent\r\neyes, the sharp voice with the nasal twang--not altogether harsh,\r\nthough sharp and nasal,--all these traits are supposed to belong\r\nespecially to the Yankee. Perhaps it was so once, but at present they\r\nare, I think, more universally common in New York than in any other\r\npart of the States. Go to Wall Street, the front of the Astor House,\r\nand the regions about Trinity Church, and you will find them in their\r\nfullest perfection.\r\n\r\nWhat circumstances of blood or food, of early habit or subsequent\r\neducation, have created for the latter-day American his present\r\nphysiognomy? It is as completely marked, as much his own, as is that\r\nof any race under the sun that has bred in and in for centuries. But\r\nthe American owns a more mixed blood than any other race known. The\r\nchief stock is English, which is itself so mixed that no man can\r\ntrace its ramifications. With this are mingled the bloods of Ireland,\r\nHolland, France, Sweden, and Germany. All this has been done within\r\nbut a few years, so that the American may be said to have no claim\r\nto any national type of face. Nevertheless, no man has a type of\r\nface so clearly national as the American. He is acknowledged by it\r\nall over the continent of Europe, and on his own side of the water\r\nis gratified by knowing that he is never mistaken for his English\r\nvisitor. I think it comes from the hot-air pipes and from dollar\r\nworship. In the Jesuit his mode of dealing with things divine has\r\ngiven a peculiar cast of countenance; and why should not the American\r\nbe similarly moulded by his special aspirations? As to the hot-air\r\npipes, there can, I think, be no doubt that to them is to be charged\r\nthe murder of all rosy cheeks throughout the States. If the effect\r\nwas to be noticed simply in the dry faces of the men about Wall\r\nStreet, I should be very indifferent to the matter. But the young\r\nladies of Fifth Avenue are in the same category. The very pith and\r\nmarrow of life is baked out of their young bones by the hot-air\r\nchambers to which they are accustomed. Hot air is the great destroyer\r\nof American beauty.\r\n\r\nIn saying that there is very little to be seen in New York, I have\r\nalso said that there is no way of seeing that little. My assertion\r\namounts to this,--that there are no cabs. To the reading world at\r\nlarge this may not seem to be much, but let the reading world go to\r\nNew York, and it will find out how much the deficiency means. In\r\nLondon, in Paris, in Florence, in Rome, in the Havana, or at Grand\r\nCairo, the cab-driver or attendant does not merely drive the cab or\r\nbelabour the donkey, but he is the visitor's easiest and cheapest\r\nguide. In London, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, and Madame Tussaud,\r\nare found by the stranger without difficulty, and almost without a\r\nthought, because the cab-driver knows the whereabouts and the way.\r\nSpace is moreover annihilated, and the huge distances of the English\r\nmetropolis are brought within the scope of mortal power. But in New\r\nYork there is no such institution.\r\n\r\nIn New York there are street omnibuses as we have,--there are\r\nstreet cars such as last year we declined to have,--and there\r\nare very excellent public carriages; but none of these give you\r\nthe accommodation of a cab, nor can all of them combined do\r\nso. The omnibuses, though clean and excellent, were to me very\r\nunintelligible. They have no conductor to them. To know their\r\ndifferent lines and usages a man should have made a scientific study\r\nof the city. To those going up and down Broadway I became accustomed,\r\nbut in them I was never quite at my ease. The money has to be paid\r\nthrough a little hole behind the driver's back, and should, as I\r\nlearned at last, be paid immediately on entrance. But in getting up\r\nto do this I always stumbled about, and it would happen that when\r\nwith considerable difficulty I had settled my own account, two or\r\nthree ladies would enter, and would hand me, without a word, some\r\ncoins with which I had no life-long familiarity in order that I might\r\ngo through the same ceremony on their account. The change I would\r\nusually drop into the straw, and then there would arise trouble and\r\nunhappiness. Before I became aware of that law as to instant payment,\r\nbells used to be rung at me which made me uneasy. I knew I was not\r\nbehaving as a citizen should behave, but could not compass the exact\r\npoints of my delinquency. And then when I desired to escape, the door\r\nbeing strapped up tight, I would halloo vainly at the driver through\r\nthe little hole; whereas, had I known my duty, I should have rung\r\na bell, or pulled a strap, according to the nature of the omnibus\r\nin question. In a month or two all these things may possibly be\r\nlearned;--but the visitor requires his facilities for locomotion at\r\nthe first moment of his entrance into the city. I heard it asserted\r\nby a lecturer in Boston, Mr. Wendell Phillips, whose name is there\r\na household word, that citizens of the United States carried brains\r\nin their fingers as well as in their heads, whereas \"common people,\"\r\nby which Mr. Phillips intended to designate the remnant of mankind\r\nbeyond the United States, were blessed with no such extended cerebral\r\ndevelopment. Having once learned this fact from Mr. Phillips,\r\nI understood why it was that a New York omnibus should be so\r\ndisagreeable to me, and at the same time so suitable to the wants of\r\nthe New Yorkers.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are street cars--very long omnibuses--which run on\r\nrails but are dragged by horses. They are capable of holding forty\r\npassengers each, and as far as my experience goes carry an average\r\nload of sixty. The fare of the omnibus is six cents or three pence.\r\nThat of the street car five cents or two pence halfpenny. They run\r\nalong the different avenues, taking the length of the city. In the\r\nupper or new part of the town their course is simple enough, but\r\nas they descend to the Bowery, Peckslip, and Pearl Street, nothing\r\ncan be conceived more difficult or devious than their courses. The\r\nBroadway omnibus, on the other hand, is a straightforward honest\r\nvehicle in the lower part of the town, becoming, however, dangerous\r\nand miscellaneous when it ascends to Union Square and the vicinities\r\nof fashionable life.\r\n\r\nThe street cars are manned with conductors, and therefore are free\r\nfrom many of the perils of the omnibus, but they have perils of their\r\nown. They are always quite full. By that I mean that every seat is\r\ncrowded, that there is a double row of men and women standing down\r\nthe centre, and that the driver's platform in front is full, and also\r\nthe conductor's platform behind. That is the normal condition of a\r\nstreet car in the Third Avenue. You, as a stranger in the middle of\r\nthe car, wish to be put down at, let us say, 89th Street. In the map\r\nof New York now before me the cross streets running from east to\r\nwest are numbered up northwards as far as 154th Street. It is quite\r\nuseless for you to give the number as you enter. Even an American\r\nconductor, with brains all over him, and an anxious desire to\r\naccommodate, as is the case with all these men, cannot remember. You\r\nare left therefore in misery to calculate the number of the street\r\nas you move along, vainly endeavouring through the misty glass to\r\ndecipher the small numbers which after a day or two you perceive to\r\nbe written on the lamp posts.\r\n\r\nBut I soon gave up all attempts at keeping a seat in one of these\r\ncars. It became my practice to sit down on the outside iron rail\r\nbehind, and as the conductor generally sat in my lap I was in a\r\nmeasure protected. As for the inside of these vehicles, the women\r\nof New York were, I must confess, too much for me. I would no\r\nsooner place myself on a seat, than I would be called on by a mute,\r\nunexpressive, but still impressive stare into my face, to surrender\r\nmy place. From cowardice if not from gallantry I would always obey;\r\nand as this led to discomfort and an irritated spirit, I preferred\r\nnursing the conductor on the hard bar in the rear.\r\n\r\nAnd here if I seem to say a word against women in America, I beg that\r\nit may be understood that I say that word only against a certain\r\nclass; and even as to that class I admit that they are respectable,\r\nintelligent, and, as I believe, industrious. Their manners, however,\r\nare to me more odious than those of any other human beings that I\r\never met elsewhere. Nor can I go on with that which I have to say\r\nwithout carrying my apology further, lest perchance I should be\r\nmisunderstood by some American women whom I would not only exclude\r\nfrom my censure, but would include in the very warmest eulogium which\r\nwords of mine could express as to those of the female sex whom I love\r\nand admire the most. I have known, do know, and mean to continue\r\nto know as far as in me may lie, American ladies as bright, as\r\nbeautiful, as graceful, as sweet, as mortal limits for brightness,\r\nbeauty, grace, and sweetness will permit. They belong to the\r\naristocracy of the land, by whatever means they may have become\r\naristocrats. In America one does not inquire as to their birth, their\r\ntraining, or their old names. The fact of their aristocratic power\r\ncomes out in every word and look. It is not only so with those who\r\nhave travelled or with those who are rich. I have found female\r\naristocrats with families and slender means, who have as yet made\r\nno grand tour across the ocean. These women are charming beyond\r\nexpression. It is not only their beauty. Had he been speaking of\r\nsuch, Wendell Phillips would have been right in saying that they have\r\nbrains all over them. So much for those who are bright and beautiful,\r\nwho are graceful and sweet! And now a word as to those who to me are\r\nneither bright nor beautiful, and who can be to none either graceful\r\nor sweet.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard task that of speaking ill of any woman, but it seems\r\nto me that he who takes upon himself to praise incurs the duty of\r\ndispraising also where dispraise is, or to him seems to be, deserved.\r\nThe trade of a novelist is very much that of describing the softness,\r\nsweetness, and loving dispositions of women; and this he does,\r\ncopying as best he can from nature. But if he only sings of that\r\nwhich is sweet, whereas that which is not sweet too frequently\r\npresents itself, his song will in the end be untrue and ridiculous.\r\nWomen are entitled to much observance from men, but they are entitled\r\nto no observance which is incompatible with truth. Women, by the\r\nconventional laws of society, are allowed to exact much from men,\r\nbut they are allowed to exact nothing for which they should not make\r\nsome adequate return. It is well that a man should kneel in spirit\r\nbefore the grace and weakness of a woman, but it is not well that he\r\nshould kneel either in spirit or body if there be neither grace nor\r\nweakness. A man should yield everything to a woman for a word, for a\r\nsmile,--to one look of entreaty. But if there be no look of entreaty,\r\nno word, no smile, I do not see that he is called upon to yield much.\r\n\r\nThe happy privileges with which women are at present blessed have\r\ncome to them from the spirit of chivalry. That spirit has taught men\r\nto endure in order that women may be at their ease; and has generally\r\ntaught women to accept the ease bestowed on them with grace and\r\nthankfulness. But in America the spirit of chivalry has sunk deeper\r\namong men than it has among women. It must be borne in mind that in\r\nthat country material well-being and education are more extended than\r\nwith us; and that, therefore, men there have learned to be chivalrous\r\nwho with us have hardly progressed so far. The conduct of men to\r\nwomen throughout the States is always gracious. They have learned the\r\nlesson. But it seems to me that the women have not advanced as far\r\nas the men have done. They have acquired a sufficient perception of\r\nthe privileges which chivalry gives them, but no perception of that\r\nreturn which chivalry demands from them. Women of the class to which\r\nI allude are always talking of their rights, but seem to have a most\r\nindifferent idea of their duties. They have no scruple at demanding\r\nfrom men everything that a man can be called on to relinquish in a\r\nwoman's behalf, but they do so without any of that grace which turns\r\nthe demand made into a favour conferred.\r\n\r\nI have seen much of this in various cities of America, but much\r\nmore of it in New York than elsewhere. I have heard young Americans\r\ncomplain of it, swearing that they must change the whole tenor of\r\ntheir habits towards women. I have heard American ladies speak of it\r\nwith loathing and disgust. For myself, I have entertained on sundry\r\noccasions that sort of feeling for an American woman which the close\r\nvicinity of an unclean animal produces. I have spoken of this with\r\nreference to street cars, because in no position of life does an\r\nunfortunate man become more liable to these anti-feminine atrocities\r\nthan in the centre of one of these vehicles. The woman, as she\r\nenters, drags after her a misshapen, dirty mass of battered wirework,\r\nwhich she calls her crinoline, and which adds as much to her grace\r\nand comfort as a log of wood does to a donkey when tied to the\r\nanimal's leg in a paddock. Of this she takes much heed, not managing\r\nit so that it may be conveyed up the carriage with some decency, but\r\nstriking it about against men's legs, and heaving it with violence\r\nover people's knees. The touch of a real woman's dress is in itself\r\ndelicate; but these blows from a harpy's fins are loathsome. If\r\nthere be two of them they talk loudly together, having a theory that\r\nmodesty has been put out of court by women's rights. But, though\r\nnot modest, the woman I describe is ferocious in her propriety. She\r\nignores the whole world around her, and as she sits with raised chin\r\nand face flattened by affectation, she pretends to declare aloud that\r\nshe is positively not aware that any man is even near her. She speaks\r\nas though to her, in her womanhood, the neighbourhood of men was the\r\nsame as that of dogs or cats. They are there, but she does not hear\r\nthem, see them, or even acknowledge them by any courtesy of motion.\r\nBut her own face always gives her the lie. In her assumption of\r\nindifference she displays her nasty consciousness, and in each\r\nattempt at a would-be propriety is guilty of an immodesty. Who does\r\nnot know the timid retiring face of the young girl who when alone\r\namong men unknown to her feels that it becomes her to keep herself\r\nsecluded? As many men as there are around her, so many knights has\r\nsuch a one, ready bucklered for her service, should occasion require\r\nsuch services. Should it not, she passes on unmolested,--but not, as\r\nshe herself will wrongly think, unheeded. But as to her of whom I am\r\nspeaking, we may say that every twist of her body, and every tone\r\nof her voice is an unsuccessful falsehood. She looks square at you\r\nin the face, and you rise to give her your seat. You rise from a\r\ndeference to your own old convictions, and from that courtesy which\r\nyou have ever paid to a woman's dress, let it be worn with ever such\r\nhideous deformities. She takes the place from which you have moved\r\nwithout a word or a bow. She twists herself round, banging your shins\r\nwith her wires, while her chin is still raised, and her face is still\r\nflattened, and she directs her friend's attention to another seated\r\nman, as though that place were also vacant, and necessarily at her\r\ndisposal. Perhaps the man opposite has his own ideas about chivalry.\r\nI have seen such a thing, and have rejoiced to see it.\r\n\r\nYou will meet these women daily, hourly,--everywhere in the streets.\r\nNow and again you will find them in society, making themselves even\r\nmore odious there than elsewhere. Who they are, whence they come,\r\nand why they are so unlike that other race of women of which I have\r\nspoken, you will settle for yourself. Do we not all say of our chance\r\nacquaintances after half an hour's conversation,--nay, after half an\r\nhour spent in the same room without conversation,--that this woman\r\nis a lady, and that that other woman is not? They jostle each other\r\neven among us, but never seem to mix. They are closely allied; but\r\nneither imbues the other with her attributes. Both shall be equally\r\nwell-born, or both shall be equally ill-born; but still it is so.\r\nThe contrast exists in England; but in America it is much stronger.\r\nIn England women become ladylike or vulgar. In the States they are\r\neither charming or odious.\r\n\r\nSee that female walking down Broadway. She is not exactly such a\r\none as her I have attempted to describe on her entrance into the\r\nstreet car; for this lady is well-dressed, if fine clothes will\r\nmake well-dressing. The machinery of her hoops is not battered, and\r\naltogether she is a personage much more distinguished in all her\r\nexpenditures. But yet she is a copy of the other woman. Look at the\r\ntrain which she drags behind her over the dirty pavement, where dogs\r\nhave been, and chewers of tobacco, and everything concerned with\r\nfilth except a scavenger. At every hundred yards some unhappy man\r\ntreads upon the silken swab which she trails behind her,--loosening\r\nit dreadfully at the girth one would say; and then see the style\r\nof face and the expression of features with which she accepts the\r\nsinner's half-muttered apology. The world, she supposes, owes her\r\neverything because of her silken train,--even room enough in a\r\ncrowded thoroughfare to drag it along unmolested. But, according to\r\nher theory, she owes the world nothing in return. She is a woman with\r\nperhaps a hundred dollars on her back, and having done the world\r\nthe honour of wearing them in the world's presence, expects to be\r\nrepaid by the world's homage and chivalry. But chivalry owes her\r\nnothing,--nothing, though she walk about beneath a hundred times\r\na hundred dollars,--nothing even though she be a woman. Let every\r\nwoman learn this,--that chivalry owes her nothing unless she also\r\nacknowledge her debt to chivalry. She must acknowledge it and pay it;\r\nand then chivalry will not be backward in making good her claims upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAll this has come of the street cars. But as it was necessary that I\r\nshould say it somewhere, it is as well said on that subject as on any\r\nother. And now to continue with the street cars. They run, as I have\r\nsaid, the length of the town, taking parallel lines. They will take\r\nyou from the Astor House, near the bottom of the town, for miles and\r\nmiles northward,--half way up the Hudson river,--for, I believe, five\r\npence. They are very slow, averaging about five miles an hour; but\r\nthey are very sure. For regular inhabitants, who have to travel five\r\nor six miles perhaps to their daily work, they are excellent. I have\r\nnothing really to say against the street cars. But they do not fill\r\nthe place of cabs.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, public carriages, roomy vehicles dragged by two\r\nhorses, clean and nice, and very well suited to ladies visiting the\r\ncity. But they have none of the attributes of the cab. As a rule they\r\nare not to be found standing about. They are very slow. They are very\r\ndear. A dollar an hour is the regular charge; but one cannot regulate\r\none's motion by the hour. Going out to dinner and back costs two\r\ndollars, over a distance which in London would cost two shillings. As\r\na rule, the cost is four times that of a cab; and the rapidity half\r\nthat of a cab. Under these circumstances I think I am justified in\r\nsaying that there is no mode of getting about in New York to see\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the other charge against New York, of there being\r\nnothing to see. How should there be anything there to see of general\r\ninterest? In other large cities, cities as large in name as New York,\r\nthere are works of art, fine buildings, ruins, ancient churches,\r\npicturesque costumes, and the tombs of celebrated men. But in New\r\nYork there are none of these things. Art has not yet grown up there.\r\nOne or two fine figures by Crawford are in the town,--especially\r\nthat of the sorrowing Indian at the rooms of the Historical Society;\r\nbut art is a luxury in a city which follows but slowly on the heels\r\nof wealth and civilization. Of fine buildings,--which indeed are\r\ncomprised in art,--there are none deserving special praise or remark.\r\nIt might well have been that New York should ere this have graced\r\nherself with something grand in architecture; but she has not done\r\nso. Some good architectural effect there is, and much architectural\r\ncomfort. Of ruins of course there can be none; none at least of such\r\nruins as travellers admire, though perhaps some of that sort which\r\ndisgraces rather than decorates. Churches there are plenty, but none\r\nthat are ancient. The costume is the same as our own; and I need\r\nhardly say that it is not picturesque. And the time for the tombs of\r\ncelebrated men has not yet come. A great man's ashes are hardly of\r\nvalue till they have all but ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to New York must seek his gratification and obtain his\r\ninstruction from the habits and manners of men. The American, though\r\nhe dresses like an Englishman, and eats roast beef with a silver\r\nfork,--or sometimes with a steel knife,--as does an Englishman,\r\nis not like an Englishman in his mind, in his aspirations, in\r\nhis tastes, or in his politics. In his mind he is quicker, more\r\nuniversally intelligent, more ambitious of general knowledge, less\r\nindulgent of stupidity and ignorance in others, harder, sharper,\r\nbrighter with the surface brightness of steel, than is an Englishman;\r\nbut he is more brittle, less enduring, less malleable, and I think\r\nless capable of impressions. The mind of the Englishman has more\r\nimagination, but that of the American more incision. The American is\r\na great observer, but he observes things material rather than things\r\nsocial or picturesque. He is a constant and ready speculator; but all\r\nspeculations, even those which come of philosophy, are with him more\r\nor less material. In his aspirations the American is more constant\r\nthan an Englishman,--or I should rather say he is more constant\r\nin aspiring. Every citizen of the United States intends to do\r\nsomething. Every one thinks himself capable of some effort. But in\r\nhis aspirations he is more limited than an Englishman. The ambitious\r\nAmerican never soars so high as the ambitious Englishman. He does\r\nnot even see up to so great a height; and when he has raised himself\r\nsomewhat above the crowd becomes sooner dizzy with his own altitude.\r\nAn American of mark, though always anxious to show his mark, is\r\nalways fearful of a fall. In his tastes the American imitates the\r\nFrenchman. Who shall dare to say that he is wrong, seeing that\r\nin general matters of design and luxury the French have won for\r\nthemselves the foremost name? I will not say that the American is\r\nwrong, but I cannot avoid thinking that he is so. I detest what is\r\ncalled French taste; but the world is against me. When I complained\r\nto a landlord of an hotel out in the West that his furniture was\r\nuseless; that I could not write at a marble table whose outside rim\r\nwas curved into fantastic shapes; that a gold clock in my bedroom\r\nwhich did not go would give me no aid in washing myself; that a\r\nheavy, immoveable curtain shut out the light; and that papier-mache\r\nchairs with small fluffy velvet seats were bad to sit on,--he\r\nanswered me completely by telling me that his house had been\r\nfurnished not in accordance with the taste of England, but with\r\nthat of France. I acknowledged the rebuke, gave up my pursuits of\r\nliterature and cleanliness, and hurried out of the house as quickly\r\nas I could. All America is now furnishing itself by the rules which\r\nguided that hotel-keeper. I do not merely allude to actual household\r\nfurniture,--to chairs, tables, and detestable gilt clocks. The taste\r\nof America is becoming French in its conversation, French in its\r\ncomforts and French in its discomforts, French in its eating, and\r\nFrench in its dress, French in its manners, and will become French in\r\nits art. There are those who will say that English taste is taking\r\nthe same direction. I do not think so. I strongly hope that it is not\r\nso. And therefore I say that an Englishman and an American differ in\r\ntheir tastes.\r\n\r\nBut of all differences between an Englishman and an American that\r\nin politics is the strongest, and the most essential. I cannot here,\r\nin one paragraph, define that difference with sufficient clearness\r\nto make my definition satisfactory; but I trust that some idea of\r\nthat difference may be conveyed by the general tenor of my book. The\r\nAmerican and the Englishman are both Republicans. The governments\r\nof the States and of England are probably the two purest republican\r\ngovernments in the world. I do not, of course, here mean to say that\r\nthe governments are more pure than others, but that the systems\r\nare more absolutely republican. And yet no men can be much further\r\nasunder in politics than the Englishman and the American. The\r\nAmerican of the present day puts a ballot-box into the hands of every\r\ncitizen and takes his stand upon that and that only. It is the duty\r\nof an American citizen to vote, and when he has voted he need trouble\r\nhimself no further till the time for voting shall come round again.\r\nThe candidate for whom he has voted represents his will, if he have\r\nvoted with the majority, and in that case he has no right to look\r\nfor further influence. If he have voted with the minority, he has no\r\nright to look for any influence at all. In either case he has done\r\nhis political work, and may go about his business till the next year\r\nor the next two or four years shall have come round. The Englishman,\r\non the other hand, will have no ballot-box, and is by no means\r\ninclined to depend exclusively upon voters or upon voting. As far\r\nas voting can show it, he desires to get the sense of the country;\r\nbut he does not think that that sense will be shown by universal\r\nsuffrage. He thinks that property amounting to a thousand pounds\r\nwill show more of that sense than property amounting to a hundred;\r\nbut he will not on that account go to work and apportion votes to\r\nwealth. He thinks that the educated can show more of that sense than\r\nthe uneducated; but he does not therefore lay down any rule about\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, or apportion votes to learning. He\r\nprefers that all these opinions of his shall bring themselves out and\r\noperate by their own intrinsic weight. Nor does he at all confine\r\nhimself to voting in his anxiety to get the sense of the country. He\r\ntakes it in any way that it will show itself, uses it for what it is\r\nworth,--or perhaps for more than it is worth,--and welds it into that\r\ngigantic lever by which the political action of the country is moved.\r\nEvery man in Great Britain, whether he possess any actual vote or no,\r\ncan do that which is tantamount to voting every day of his life, by\r\nthe mere expression of his opinion. Public opinion in America has\r\nhitherto been nothing, unless it has managed to express itself by a\r\nmajority of ballot-boxes. Public opinion in England is everything,\r\nlet votes go as they may. Let the people want a measure, and there\r\nis no doubt of their obtaining it. Only the people must want\r\nit;--as they did want Catholic emancipation, reform, and corn-law\r\nrepeal;--and as they would want war if it were brought home to them\r\nthat their country was insulted.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to describe this difference in the political action of\r\nthe two countries, I am very far from taking all praise for England\r\nor throwing any reproach on the States. The political action of the\r\nStates is undoubtedly the more logical and the clearer. That indeed\r\nof England is so illogical and so little clear that it would be quite\r\nimpossible for any other nation to assume it, merely by resolving to\r\ndo so. Whereas the political action of the States might be assumed by\r\nany nation to-morrow, and all its strength might be carried across\r\nthe water in a few written rules as are the prescriptions of a\r\nphysician or the regulations of an infirmary. With us the thing has\r\ngrown of habit, has been fostered by tradition, has crept up uncared\r\nfor and in some parts unnoticed. It can be written in no book, can be\r\ndescribed in no words, can be copied by no statesmen, and I almost\r\nbelieve can be understood by no people but that to whose peculiar\r\nuses it has been adapted.\r\n\r\nIn speaking as I have here done of American taste and American\r\npolitics I must allude to a special class of Americans who are to be\r\nmet more generally in New York than elsewhere,--men who are educated,\r\nwho have generally travelled, who are almost always agreeable, but\r\nwho as regards their politics are to me the most objectionable of all\r\nmen. As regards taste they are objectionable to me also. But that is\r\na small thing; and as they are quite as likely to be right as I am I\r\nwill say nothing against their taste. But in politics it seems to me\r\nthat these men have fallen into the bitterest and perhaps into the\r\nbasest of errors. Of the man who begins his life with mean political\r\nideas, having sucked them in with his mother's milk, there may be\r\nsome hope. The evil is at any rate the fault of his forefathers\r\nrather than of himself. But who can have hope of him who, having been\r\nthrown by birth and fortune into the running river of free political\r\nactivity, has allowed himself to be drifted into the stagnant level\r\nof general political servility? There are very many such Americans.\r\nThey call themselves republicans, and sneer at the idea of a limited\r\nmonarchy, but they declare that there is no republic so safe, so\r\nequal for all men, so purely democratic as that now existing in\r\nFrance. Under the French empire all men are equal. There is no\r\naristocracy; no oligarchy; no overshadowing of the little by the\r\ngreat. One superior is admitted;--admitted on earth, as a superior is\r\nalso admitted in heaven. Under him everything is level, and--provided\r\nhe be not impeded--everything is free. He knows how to rule, and the\r\nnation, allowing him the privilege of doing so, can go along its\r\ncourse safely;--can eat, drink, and be merry. If few men can rise\r\nhigh, so also can few men fall low. Political equality is the one\r\nthing desirable in a commonwealth, and by this arrangement political\r\nequality is obtained. Such is the modern creed of many an educated\r\nrepublican of the States.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that such a political state is about the vilest to\r\nwhich a man can descend. It amounts to a tacit abandonment of the\r\nstruggle which men are making for political truth and political\r\nbeneficence, in order that bread and meat may be eaten in peace\r\nduring the score of years or so that are at the moment passing over\r\nus. The politicians of this class have decided for themselves that\r\nthe _summum bonum_ is to be found in bread and the circus games.\r\nIf they be free to eat, free to rest, free to sleep, free to drink\r\nlittle cups of coffee while the world passes before them on a\r\nboulevard, they have that freedom which they covet. But equality is\r\nnecessary as well as freedom. There must be no towering trees in this\r\nparterre to overshadow the clipped shrubs, and destroy the uniformity\r\nof a growth which should never mount more than two feet above the\r\nearth. The equality of this politician would forbid any to rise above\r\nhim instead of inviting all to rise up to him. It is the equality\r\nof fear and of selfishness, and not the equality of courage and\r\nphilanthropy. And brotherhood too must be invoked,--fraternity as we\r\nmay better call it in the jargon of the school. Such politicians tell\r\none much of fraternity, and define it too. It consists in a general\r\nraising of the hat to all mankind; in a daily walk that never hurries\r\nitself into a jostling trot, inconvenient to passengers on the\r\npavement;--in a placid voice, a soft smile, and a small cup of coffee\r\non a boulevard. It means all this, but I could never find that it\r\nmeant any more. There is a nation for which one is almost driven to\r\nthink that such political aspirations as these are suitable; but that\r\nnation is certainly not the States of America.\r\n\r\nAnd yet one finds many American gentlemen who have allowed themselves\r\nto be drifted into such a theory. They have begun the world as\r\nrepublican citizens, and as such they must go on. But in their\r\ntravels and their studies, and in the luxury of their life, they have\r\nlearned to dislike the rowdiness of their country's politics. They\r\nwant things to be soft and easy;--as republican as you please, but\r\nwith as little noise as possible. The President is there for four\r\nyears. Why not elect him for eight, for twelve, or for life?--for\r\neternity if it were possible to find one who could continue to live?\r\nIt is to this way of thinking that Americans are driven, when the\r\npolish of Europe has made the roughness of their own elections odious\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen any of our great institootions, sir?\" That of course\r\nis a question which is put to every Englishman who has visited New\r\nYork, and the Englishman who intends to say that he has seen New\r\nYork, should visit many of them. I went to schools, hospitals,\r\nlunatic asylums, institutes for deaf and dumb, water works,\r\nhistorical societies, telegraph offices, and large commercial\r\nestablishments. I rather think that I did my work in a thorough\r\nand conscientious manner, and I owe much gratitude to those who\r\nguided me on such occasions. Perhaps I ought to describe all these\r\ninstitutions; but were I to do so, I fear that I should inflict fifty\r\nor sixty very dull pages on my readers. If I could make all that I\r\nsaw as clear and intelligible to others as it was made to me who saw\r\nit, I might do some good. But I know that I should fail. I marvelled\r\nmuch at the developed intelligence of a room full of deaf and dumb\r\npupils, and was greatly astonished at the performance of one special\r\ngirl, who seemed to be brighter and quicker, and more rapidly easy\r\nwith her pen than girls generally are who can hear and talk; but I\r\ncannot convey my enthusiasm to others. On such a subject a writer may\r\nbe correct, may be exhaustive, may be statistically great; but he\r\ncan hardly be entertaining, and the chances are that he will not be\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nIn all such matters, however, New York is preeminently great. All\r\nthrough the States suffering humanity receives so much attention that\r\nhumanity can hardly be said to suffer. The daily recurring boast of\r\n\"our glorious institootions, sir,\" always provokes the ridicule of an\r\nEnglishman. The words have become ridiculous, and it would, I think,\r\nbe well for the nation if the term \"Institution\" could be excluded\r\nfrom its vocabulary. But, in truth, they are glorious. The country in\r\nthis respects boasts, but it has done that which justifies a boast.\r\nThe arrangements for supplying New York with water are magnificent.\r\nThe drainage of the new part of the city is excellent. The\r\nhospitals are almost alluring. The lunatic asylum which I saw was\r\nperfect,--though I did not feel obliged to the resident physician\r\nfor introducing me to all the worst patients as countrymen of my own.\r\n\"An English lady, Mr. Trollope. I'll introduce you. Quite a hopeless\r\ncase. Two old women. They've been here fifty years. They're English.\r\nAnother gentleman from England, Mr. Trollope. A very interesting\r\ncase! Confirmed inebriety.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as to the schools, it is almost impossible to mention them with\r\ntoo high a praise. I am speaking here specially of New York, though\r\nI might say the same of Boston, or of all New England. I do not know\r\nany contrast that would be more surprising to an Englishman, up to\r\nthat moment ignorant of the matter, than that which he would find by\r\nvisiting first of all a free school in London, and then a free school\r\nin New York. If he would also learn the number of children that are\r\neducated gratuitously in each of the two cities, and also the number\r\nin each which altogether lack education, he would, if susceptible of\r\nstatistics, be surprised also at that. But seeing and hearing are\r\nalways more effective than mere figures. The female pupil at a free\r\nschool in London is, as a rule, either a ragged pauper, or a charity\r\ngirl, if not degraded at least stigmatized by the badges and dress\r\nof the Charity. We Englishmen know well the type of each, and have a\r\nfairly correct idea of the amount of education which is imparted to\r\nthem. We see the result afterwards when the same girls become our\r\nservants, and the wives of our grooms and porters. The female pupil\r\nat a free school in New York is neither a pauper nor a charity girl.\r\nShe is dressed with the utmost decency. She is perfectly cleanly. In\r\nspeaking to her, you cannot in any degree guess whether her father\r\nhas a dollar a day, or three thousand dollars a year. Nor will you\r\nbe enabled to guess by the manner in which her associates treat her.\r\nAs regards her own manner to you, it is always the same as though\r\nher father were in all respects your equal. As to the amount of her\r\nknowledge, I fairly confess that it is terrific. When, in the first\r\nroom which I visited, a slight slim creature was had up before me\r\nto explain to me the properties of the hypothenuse I fairly confess\r\nthat, as regards education, I backed down, and that I resolved to\r\nconfine my criticisms to manner, dress, and general behaviour. In\r\nthe next room I was more at my ease, finding that ancient Roman\r\nhistory was on the tapis. \"Why did the Romans run away with the\r\nSabine women?\" asked the mistress, herself a young woman of about\r\nthree-and-twenty. \"Because they were pretty,\" simpered out a\r\nlittle girl with a cherry mouth. The answer did not give complete\r\nsatisfaction; and then followed a somewhat abstruse explanation\r\non the subject of population. It was all done with good faith and\r\na serious intent, and showed what it was intended to show,--that\r\nthe girls there educated had in truth reached the consideration of\r\nimportant subjects, and that they were leagues beyond that terrible\r\nrepetition of A B C, to which, I fear, that most of our free\r\nmetropolitan schools are still necessarily confined. You and I,\r\nreader, were we called on to superintend the education of girls of\r\nsixteen, might not select as favourite points either the hypothenuse,\r\nor the ancient methods of populating young colonies. There may be,\r\nand to us on the European side of the Atlantic there will be, a\r\ncertain amount of absurdity in the transatlantic idea that all\r\nknowledge is knowledge, and that it should be imparted if it be not\r\nknowledge of evil. But as to the general result, no fair-minded man\r\nor woman can have a doubt. That the lads and girls in these schools\r\nare excellently educated comes home as a fact to the mind of any one\r\nwho will look into the subject. That girl could not have got as far\r\nas the hypothenuse without a competent and abiding knowledge of much\r\nthat is very far beyond the outside limits of what such girls know\r\nwith us. It was at least manifest in the other examination that the\r\ngirls knew as well as I did who were the Romans, and who were the\r\nSabine women. That all this is of use, was shown in the very gestures\r\nand bearings of the girl. _Emollit mores_, as Colonel Newcombe used\r\nto say. That young woman whom I had watched while she cooked her\r\nhusband's dinner upon the banks of the Mississippi, had doubtless\r\nlearned all about the Sabine women, and I feel assured that she\r\ncooked her husband's dinner all the better for that knowledge,--and\r\nfaced the hardships of the world with a better front than she would\r\nhave done had she been ignorant on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a comparison between the schools of London and those\r\nof New York, I have called them both free schools. They are in fact\r\nmore free in New York than they are in London, because in New York\r\nevery boy and girl, let his parentage be what it may, can attend\r\nthese schools without any payment. Thus an education as good as the\r\nAmerican mind can compass, prepared with every care, carried on by\r\nhighly paid tutors, under ample surveillance, provided with all that\r\nis most excellent in the way of rooms, desks, books, charts, maps,\r\nand implements, is brought actually within the reach of everybody.\r\nI need not point out to Englishmen how different is the nature of\r\nschools in London. It must not, however, be supposed that these are\r\ncharity schools. Such is not their nature. Let us say what we may\r\nas to the beauty of charity as a virtue, the recipient of charity\r\nin its customary sense among us is ever more or less degraded by\r\nthe position. In the States that has been fully understood, and\r\nthe schools to which I allude are carefully preserved from any\r\nsuch taint. Throughout the States a separate tax is levied for the\r\nmaintenance of these schools, and as the tax-payer supports them,\r\nhe is of course entitled to the advantage which they confer. The\r\nchild of the non-tax-payer is also entitled, and to him the boon, if\r\nstrictly analysed, will come in the shape of a charity. But under\r\nthe system as it is arranged, this is not analysed. It is understood\r\nthat the school is open to all in the ward to which it belongs, and\r\nno inquiry is made whether the pupil's parent has or has not paid\r\nanything towards the school's support. I found this theory carried\r\nout so far that at the deaf and dumb school, where some of the poorer\r\nchildren are wholly provided by the institution, care is taken to\r\nclothe them in dresses of different colours and different make, in\r\norder that nothing may attach to them which has the appearance of a\r\nbadge. Political economists will see something of evil in this. But\r\nphilanthropists will see very much that is good.\r\n\r\nIt is not without a purpose that I have given this somewhat glowing\r\naccount of a girls' school in New York so soon after my little\r\npicture of New York women, as they behave themselves in the streets\r\nand street cars. It will, of course, be said that those women of whom\r\nI have spoken, by no means in terms of admiration, are the very girls\r\nwhose education has been so excellent. This of course is so; but I\r\nbeg to remark that I have by no means said that an excellent school\r\neducation will produce all female excellences. The fact, I take it,\r\nis this,--that seeing how high in the scale these girls have been\r\nraised, one is anxious that they should be raised higher. One is\r\nsurprised at their pert vulgarity and hideous airs, not because they\r\nare so low in our general estimation but because they are so high.\r\nWomen of the same class in London are humble enough, and therefore\r\nrarely offend us who are squeamish. They show by their gestures that\r\nthey hardly think themselves good enough to sit by us; they apologise\r\nfor their presence; they conceive it to be their duty to be lowly\r\nin their gestures. The question is which is best, the crouching and\r\ncrawling or the impudent unattractive self-composure. Not, my reader,\r\nwhich action on her part may the better conduce to my comfort or to\r\nyours! That is by no means the question. Which is the better for\r\nthe woman herself? That I take it is the point to be decided. That\r\nthere is something better than either we shall all agree;--but to my\r\nthinking the crouching and crawling is the lowest type of all.\r\n\r\nAt that school I saw some five or six hundred girls collected in one\r\nroom, and heard them sing. The singing was very pretty, and it was\r\nall very nice; but I own that I was rather startled, and to tell the\r\ntruth somewhat abashed, when I was invited to \"say a few words to\r\nthem.\" No idea of such a suggestion had dawned upon me, and I felt\r\nmyself quite at a loss. To be called up before five hundred men is\r\nbad enough, but how much worse before that number of girls! What\r\ncould I say but that they were all very pretty? As far as I can\r\nremember I did say that and nothing else. Very pretty they were, and\r\nneatly dressed, and attractive; but among them all there was not a\r\npair of rosy cheeks. How should there be, when every room in the\r\nbuilding was heated up to the condition of an oven by those damnable\r\nhot-air pipes!\r\n\r\nIn England a taste for very large shops has come up during the last\r\ntwenty years. A firm is not doing a good business, or at any rate\r\na distinguished business, unless he can assert in his trade card\r\nthat he occupies at least half a dozen houses--Nos. 105, 106, 107,\r\n108, 109, and 110. The old way of paying for what you want over\r\nthe counter is gone; and when you buy a yard of tape or a new\r\ncarriage,--for either of which articles you will probably visit the\r\nsame establishment,--you go through about the same amount of ceremony\r\nas when you sell a thousand pounds out of the stocks in propriâ\r\npersonâ. But all this is still further exaggerated in New York. Mr.\r\nStewart's store there is perhaps the handsomest institution in the\r\ncity, and his hall of audience for new carpets is a magnificent\r\nsaloon. \"You have nothing like that in England,\" my friend said to\r\nme as he walked me through it in triumph. \"I wish we had nothing\r\napproaching to it,\" I answered. For I confess to a liking for\r\nthe old-fashioned private shops. Harper's establishment for the\r\nmanufacture and sale of books is also very wonderful. Everything is\r\ndone on the premises, down to the very colouring of the paper which\r\nlines the covers, and places the gilding on their backs. The firm\r\nprints, engraves, electroplates, sews, binds, publishes, and sells\r\nwholesale and retail. I have no doubt that the authors have rooms in\r\nthe attics where the other slight initiatory step is taken towards\r\nthe production of literature.\r\n\r\nNew York is built upon an island, which is I believe about ten\r\nmiles long, counting from the southern point at the Battery up\r\nto Carmansville, to which place the city is presumed to extend\r\nnorthwards. This island is called Manhattan,--a name which I have\r\nalways thought would have been more graceful for the city than that\r\nof New York. It is formed by the Sound or East river, which divides\r\nthe continent from Long Island, by the Hudson river which runs into\r\nthe Sound or rather joins it at the city foot, and by a small stream\r\ncalled the Haarlem river which runs out of the Hudson and meanders\r\naway into the Sound at the north of the city, thus cutting the city\r\noff from the main land. The breadth of the island does not much\r\nexceed two miles, and therefore the city is long, and not capable of\r\nextension in point of breadth. In its old days it clustered itself\r\nround about the Point, and stretched itself up from there along\r\nthe quays of the two waters. The streets down in this part of the\r\ntown are devious enough, twisting themselves about with delightful\r\nirregularity; but as the city grew there came the taste for\r\nparallelograms, and the upper streets are rectangular and numbered.\r\nBroadway, the street of New York with which the world is generally\r\nbest acquainted, begins at the southern point of the town and goes\r\nnorthward through it. For some two miles and a half it walks away in\r\na straight line, and then it turns to the left towards the Hudson,\r\nand becomes in fact a continuation of another street called the\r\nBowery, which comes up in a devious course from the south-east\r\nextremity of the island. From that time Broadway never again takes\r\na straight course, but crosses the various Avenues in an oblique\r\ndirection till it becomes the Bloomingdale road, and under that\r\nname takes itself out of town. There are eleven so-called Avenues,\r\nwhich descend in absolutely straight lines from the northern, and\r\nat present unsettled, extremity of the new town, making their way\r\nsouthward till they lose themselves among the old streets. These are\r\ncalled First Avenue, Second Avenue, and so on. The town had already\r\nprogressed two miles up northwards from the Battery before it had\r\ncaught the parallelogrammic fever from Philadelphia, for at about\r\nthat distance we find \"First Street.\" First Street runs across the\r\nAvenues from water to water, and then Second Street. I will not name\r\nthem all, seeing that they go up to 154th Street! They do so at least\r\non the map, and I believe on the lamp-posts. But the houses are not\r\nyet built in order beyond 50th or 60th Street. The other hundred\r\nstreets, each of two miles long, with the Avenues which are mostly\r\nunoccupied for four or five miles, is the ground over which the young\r\nNew Yorkers are to spread themselves. I do not in the least doubt\r\nthat they will occupy it all, and that 154th Street will find itself\r\ntoo narrow a boundary for the population.\r\n\r\nI have said that there was some good architectural effect in New\r\nYork, and I alluded chiefly to that of the Fifth Avenue. The Fifth\r\nAvenue is the Belgrave Square, the Park Lane, and the Pall Mall of\r\nNew York. It is certainly a very fine street. The houses in it are\r\nmagnificent, not having that aristocratic look which some of our\r\ndetached London residences enjoy, or the palatial appearance of an\r\nold-fashioned hotel in Paris, but an air of comfortable luxury and\r\ncommercial wealth which is not excelled by the best houses of any\r\nother town that I know. They are houses, not hotels or palaces; but\r\nthey are very roomy houses, with every luxury that complete finish\r\ncan give them. Many of them cover large spaces of ground, and their\r\nrent will sometimes go up as high as £800 and £1000 a year. Generally\r\nthe best of these houses are owned by those who live in them, and\r\nrent is not therefore paid. But this is not always the case, and the\r\nsums named above may be taken as expressing their value. In England\r\na man should have a very large income indeed who could afford to pay\r\n£1000 a year for his house in London. Such a one would as a matter of\r\ncourse have an establishment in the country, and be an Earl or a Duke\r\nor a millionaire. But it is different in New York. The resident there\r\nshows his wealth chiefly by his house, and though he may probably\r\nhave a villa at Newport or a box somewhere up the Hudson he has no\r\nsecond establishment. Such a house therefore will not represent a\r\ntotal expenditure of above £4,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThere are churches on each side of Fifth Avenue,--perhaps five or\r\nsix within sight at one time,--which add much to the beauty of the\r\nstreet. They are well-built, and in fairly good taste. These, added\r\nto the general well-being and splendid comfort of the place, give it\r\nan effect better than the architecture of the individual houses would\r\nseem to warrant. I own that I have enjoyed the vista as I have walked\r\nup and down Fifth Avenue, and have felt that the city had a right to\r\nbe proud of its wealth. But the greatness and beauty and glory of\r\nwealth have on such occasions been all in all with me. I know no\r\ngreat man, no celebrated statesman, no philanthropist of peculiar\r\nnote who has lived in Fifth Avenue. That gentleman on the right made\r\na million of dollars by inventing a shirt-collar; this one on the\r\nleft electrified the world by a lotion; as to the gentleman at the\r\ncorner there,--there are rumours about him and the Cuban slave-trade;\r\nbut my informant by no means knows that they are true. Such are the\r\naristocracy of Fifth Avenue. I can only say that if I could make a\r\nmillion dollars by a lotion, I should certainly be right to live in\r\nsuch a house as one of those.\r\n\r\nThe suburbs of New York are, by the nature of the localities, divided\r\nfrom the city by water. New Jersey and Hoboken are on the other side\r\nof the Hudson, and in another State. Williamsburgh and Brooklyn are\r\nin Long Island, which is a part of the State of New York. But these\r\nplaces are as easily reached as Lambeth is reached from Westminster.\r\nSteam ferries ply every three or four minutes, and into these boats\r\ncoaches, carts, and waggons of any size or weight are driven. In fact\r\nthey make no other stoppage to the commerce than that occasioned by\r\nthe payment of a few cents. Such payment no doubt is a stoppage, and\r\ntherefore it is that New Jersey, Brooklyn, and Williamsburgh are, at\r\nany rate in appearance, very dull and uninviting. They are, however,\r\nvery populous. Many of the quieter citizens prefer to live there; and\r\nI am told that the Brooklyn tea-parties consider themselves to be, in\r\næsthetic feeling, very much ahead of anything of the kind in the more\r\nopulent centres of the city. In beauty of scenery Staten Island is\r\nvery much the prettiest of the suburbs of New York. The view from the\r\nhill side in Staten Island down upon New York harbour is very lovely.\r\nIt is the only really good view of that magnificent harbour which I\r\nhave been able to find. As for appreciating such beauty when one is\r\nentering a port from sea, or leaving it for sea, I do not believe in\r\nany such power. The ship creeps up or creeps out while the mind is\r\nengaged on other matters. The passenger is uneasy either with hopes\r\nor fears; and then the grease of the engines offends one's nostrils.\r\nBut it is worth the tourist's while to look down upon New York\r\nharbour from the hill side in Staten Island. When I was there Fort\r\nLafayette looked black in the centre of the channel, and we knew that\r\nit was crowded with the victims of secession. Fort Tomkins was being\r\nbuilt, to guard the pass,--worthy of a name of richer sound; and Fort\r\nsomething else was bristling with new cannon. Fort Hamilton, on Long\r\nIsland, opposite, was frowning at us; and immediately around us a\r\nregiment of volunteers was receiving regimental stocks and boots from\r\nthe hands of its officers. Everything was bristling with war; and one\r\ncould not but think that not in this way had New York raised herself\r\nso quickly to her present greatness.\r\n\r\nBut the glory of New York is the Central Park;--its glory in the mind\r\nof all New Yorkers of the present day. The first question asked of\r\nyou is whether you have seen the Central Park, and the second is as\r\nto what you think of it. It does not do to say simply that it is\r\nfine, grand, beautiful, and miraculous. You must swear by cock and\r\npie that it is more fine, more grand, more beautiful, more miraculous\r\nthan anything else of the kind anywhere. Here you encounter, in its\r\nmost annoying form, that necessity for eulogium which presses you\r\neverywhere. For, in truth, taken as it is at present, the Central\r\nPark is not fine, nor grand, nor beautiful. As to the miracle, let\r\nthat pass. It is perhaps as miraculous as some other great latter-day\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\nBut the Central Park is a very great fact, and affords a strong\r\nadditional proof of the sense and energy of the people. It is very\r\nlarge, being over three miles long, and about three quarters of\r\na mile in breadth. When it was found that New York was extending\r\nitself, and becoming one of the largest cities of the world, a space\r\nwas selected between Fifth and Seventh Avenues, immediately outside\r\nthe limits of the city as then built, but nearly in the centre of\r\nthe city as it is intended to be built. The ground around it became\r\nat once of great value; and I do not doubt that the present fashion\r\nof the Fifth Avenue about Twentieth Street will in course of time\r\nmove itself up to the Fifth Avenue as it looks, or will look, over\r\nthe Park at Seventieth, Eightieth, and Ninetieth Streets. The great\r\nwaterworks of the city bring the Croton River, whence New York is\r\nsupplied, by an aqueduct over the Haarlem river into an enormous\r\nreservoir just above the Park; and hence it has come to pass that\r\nthere will be water not only for sanitary and useful purposes, but\r\nalso for ornament. At present the Park, to English eyes, seems to be\r\nall road. The trees are not grown up, and the new embankments, and\r\nnew lakes, and new ditches, and new paths give to the place anything\r\nbut a picturesque appearance. The Central Park is good for what it\r\nwill be, rather than for what it is. The summer heat is so very great\r\nthat I doubt much whether the people of New York will ever enjoy such\r\nverdure as our parks show. But there will be a pleasant assemblage of\r\nwalks and water-works, with fresh air, and fine shrubs and flowers,\r\nimmediately within the reach of the citizens. All that art and energy\r\ncan do will be done, and the Central Park doubtless will become one\r\nof the great glories of New York. When I was expected to declare\r\nthat St. James's Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens,\r\naltogether, were nothing to it, I confess that I could only remain\r\nmute.\r\n\r\nThose who desire to learn what are the secrets of society in New\r\nYork, I would refer to the Potiphar Papers. The Potiphar Papers are\r\nperhaps not as well known in England as they deserve to be. They were\r\npublished, I think, as much as seven or eight years ago; but are\r\nprobably as true now as they were then. What I saw of society in New\r\nYork was quiet and pleasant enough; but doubtless I did not climb\r\ninto that circle in which Mrs. Potiphar held so distinguished a\r\nposition. It may be true that gentlemen habitually throw fragments of\r\ntheir supper and remnants of their wine on to their host's carpets;\r\nbut if so I did not see it.\r\n\r\nAs I progress in my work I feel that duty will call upon me to write\r\na separate chapter on hotels in general, and I will not, therefore,\r\nhere say much about those in New York. I am inclined to think\r\nthat few towns in the world, if any, afford on the whole better\r\naccommodation, but there are many in which the accommodation is\r\ncheaper. Of the railways also I ought to say something. The fact\r\nrespecting them which is most remarkable is that of their being\r\ncontinued into the centre of the town through the streets. The cars\r\nare not dragged through the city by locomotive engines, but by\r\nhorses; the pace therefore is slow, but the convenience to travellers\r\nin being brought nearer to the centre of trade must be much felt. It\r\nis as though passengers from Liverpool and passengers from Bristol\r\nwere carried on from Euston Square and Paddington along the New Road,\r\nPortland Place, and Regent Street to Pall Mall, or up the City Road\r\nto the Bank. As a general rule, however, the railways, railway cars,\r\nand all about them are ill-managed. They are monopolies, and the\r\npublic, through the press, has no restraining power upon them as it\r\nhas in England. A parcel sent by express over a distance of forty\r\nmiles will not be delivered within twenty-four hours. I once made my\r\nplaint on this subject at the bar or office of an hotel, and was told\r\nthat no remonstrance was of avail. \"It is a monopoly,\" the man told\r\nme, \"and if we say anything, we are told that if we do not like it\r\nwe need not use it.\" In railway matters and postal matters time and\r\npunctuality are not valued in the States as they are with us, and the\r\npublic seem to acknowledge that they must put up with defects,--that\r\nthey must grin and bear them in America, as the public no doubt do in\r\nAustria where such affairs are managed by a government bureau.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this chapter I spoke of the population of\r\nNew York, and I cannot end it without remarking that out of that\r\npopulation more than one-eighth is composed of Germans. It is, I\r\nbelieve, computed that there are about 120,000 Germans in the city,\r\nand that only two other German cities in the world, Vienna and\r\nBerlin, have a larger German population than New York. The Germans\r\nare good citizens and thriving men, and are to be found prospering\r\nall over the northern and western parts of the Union. It seems that\r\nthey are excellently well adapted to colonization, though they have\r\nin no instance become the dominant people in a colony, or carried\r\nwith them their own language or their own laws. The French have\r\ndone so in Algeria, in some of the West India islands, and quite as\r\nessentially into Lower Canada, where their language and laws still\r\nprevail. And yet it is, I think, beyond doubt that the French are not\r\ngood colonists, as are the Germans.\r\n\r\nOf the ultimate destiny of New York as one of the ruling commercial\r\ncities of the world, it is, I think, impossible to doubt. Whether or\r\nno it will ever equal London in population I will not pretend to say.\r\nEven should it do so, should its numbers so increase as to enable\r\nit to say that it had done so, the question could not very well be\r\nsettled. When it comes to pass that an assemblage of men in one\r\nso-called city have to be counted by millions, there arises the\r\nimpossibility of defining the limits of that city, and of saying who\r\nbelong to it and who do not. An arbitrary line may be drawn, but that\r\narbitrary line, though perhaps false when drawn as including too\r\nmuch, soon becomes more false as including too little. Ealing, Acton,\r\nFulham, Putney, Norwood, Sydenham, Blackheath, Woolwich, Greenwich,\r\nStratford, Highgate, and Hampstead, are, in truth, component parts of\r\nLondon, and very shortly Brighton will be as much so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs New York is the most populous State of the Union, having the\r\nlargest representation in Congress,--on which account it has been\r\ncalled the Empire State,--I propose to mention, as shortly as may be,\r\nthe nature of its separate Constitution as a State. Of course it will\r\nbe understood that the constitutions of the different States are by\r\nno means the same. They have been arranged according to the judgment\r\nof the different people concerned, and have been altered from time to\r\ntime to suit such altered judgment. But as the States together form\r\none nation, and on such matters as foreign affairs, war, customs,\r\nand post-office regulations, are bound together as much as are the\r\nEnglish counties, it is, of course, necessary that the constitution\r\nof each should in most matters assimilate itself to those of the\r\nothers. These constitutions are very much alike. A Governor, with\r\ntwo houses of legislature, generally called the Senate and the House\r\nof Representatives, exists in each State. In the State of New York\r\nthe lower house is called the Assembly. In most States the Governor\r\nis elected annually; but in some States for two years, as in New\r\nYork. In Pennsylvania he is elected for three years. The House of\r\nRepresentatives or the Assembly is, I think, always elected for one\r\nsession only; but as, in many of the States, the Legislature only\r\nsits once in two years, the election recurs of course at the same\r\ninterval. The franchise in all the States is nearly universal, but\r\nin no State is it perfectly so. The Governor, Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nand other officers are elected by vote of the people as well as the\r\nmembers of the Legislature. Of course it will be understood that each\r\nState makes laws for itself,--that they are in nowise dependent on\r\nthe Congress assembled at Washington for their laws,--unless for laws\r\nwhich refer to matters between the United States as a nation and\r\nother nations, or between one State and another. Each State declares\r\nwith what punishment crimes shall be visited; what taxes shall be\r\nlevied for the use of the State; what laws shall be passed as to\r\neducation; what shall be the State judiciary. With reference to the\r\njudiciary, however, it must be understood, that the United States\r\nas a nation have separate national law courts before which come all\r\ncases litigated between State and State, and all cases which do not\r\nbelong in every respect to any one individual State. In a subsequent\r\nchapter I will endeavour to explain this more fully. In endeavouring\r\nto understand the constitution of the United States it is essentially\r\nnecessary that we should remember that we have always to deal with\r\ntwo different political arrangements,--that which refers to the\r\nnation as a whole, and that which belongs to each State as a separate\r\ngoverning power in itself. What is law in one State is not law in\r\nanother. Nevertheless there is a very great likeness throughout these\r\nvarious constitutions; and any political student who shall have\r\nthoroughly mastered one, will not have much to learn in mastering the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis State, now called New York, was first settled by the Dutch in\r\n1614, on Manhattan Island. They established a government in 1629,\r\nunder the name of the New Netherlands. In 1664 Charles II. granted\r\nthe province to his brother, James II., then Duke of York, and\r\npossession was taken of the country on his behalf by one Colonel\r\nNichols. In 1673 it was recaptured by the Dutch, but they could not\r\nhold it, and the Duke of York again took possession by patent. A\r\nlegislative body was first assembled during the reign of Charles II.,\r\nin 1683; from which it will be seen that parliamentary representation\r\nwas introduced into the American colonies at a very early date. The\r\ndeclaration of independence was made by the revolted colonies in\r\n1776, and in 1777 the first constitution was adopted by the State of\r\nNew York. In 1822 this was changed for another; and the one of which\r\nI now purport to state some of the details was brought into action\r\nin 1847. In this constitution there is a provision that it shall\r\nbe overhauled and remodelled, if needs be, once in twenty years.\r\nArticle XIII. Sec. 2.--\"At the general election to be held in 1866,\r\nand in each twentieth year thereafter, the question, 'Shall there\r\nbe a convention to revise the Constitution and amend the same?'\r\nshall be decided by the electors qualified to vote for members of\r\nthe Legislature.\" So that the New Yorkers cannot be twitted with\r\nthe presumption of finality in reference to their legislative\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nThe present constitution begins with declaring the inviolability\r\nof trial by jury and of habeas corpus,--\"unless when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require its suspension.\"\r\nIt does not say by whom it may be suspended, or who is to judge of\r\nthe public safety, but, at any rate, it may be presumed that such\r\nsuspension was supposed to come from the powers of the State which\r\nenacted the law. At the present moment the habeas corpus is suspended\r\nin New York, and this suspension has proceeded not from the powers of\r\nthe State, but from the Federal Government, without the sanction even\r\nof the Federal Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Every citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments\r\non all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right; and\r\nno law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech\r\nor of the press.\" Art. I. Sec. 8. But at the present moment liberty\r\nof speech and of the press is utterly abrogated in the State of New\r\nYork, as it is in other States. I mention this not as a reproach\r\nagainst either the State or the Federal Government, but to show how\r\nvain all laws are for the protection of such rights. If they be not\r\nprotected by the feelings of the people,--if the people are at any\r\ntime, or from any cause, willing to abandon such privileges, no\r\nwritten laws will preserve them.\r\n\r\nIn Art. I. Sec. 14, there is a proviso that no land--land, that is,\r\nused for agricultural purposes--shall be let on lease for a longer\r\nperiod than twelve years. \"No lease or grant of agricultural land for\r\na longer period than twelve years hereafter made, in which shall be\r\nreserved any rent or service of any kind, shall be valid.\" I do not\r\nunderstand the intended virtue of this proviso, but it shows very\r\nclearly how different are the practices with reference to land in\r\nEngland and America. Farmers in the States almost always are the\r\nowners of the land which they farm, and such tenures as those, by\r\nwhich the occupiers of land generally hold their farms with us, are\r\nalmost unknown. There is no such relation as that of landlord and\r\ntenant as regards agricultural holdings.\r\n\r\nEvery male citizen of New York may vote who is twenty-one, who has\r\nbeen a citizen for ten days, who has lived in the State for a year,\r\nand for four months in the county in which he votes. He can vote for\r\nall \"officers that now are, or hereafter may be, elective by the\r\npeople.\" Art. II. Sec. 1. \"But,\" the section goes on to say, \"no man\r\nof colour, unless he shall have been for three years a citizen of the\r\nState, and for one year next preceding any election shall have been\r\npossessed of a freehold estate of the value of 250 dollars (£50),\r\nand shall have been actually rated, and paid a tax thereon, shall be\r\nentitled to vote at such election.\" This is the only embargo with\r\nwhich universal suffrage is laden in the State of New York.\r\n\r\nThe third article provides for the election of the Senate and the\r\nAssembly. The Senate consists of thirty-two members. And it may here\r\nbe remarked that large as is the State of New York, and great as is\r\nits population, its Senate is less numerous than that of many other\r\nStates. In Massachusetts, for instance, there are forty senators,\r\nthough the population of Massachusetts is barely one third that of\r\nNew York. In Virginia there are fifty senators, whereas the free\r\npopulation is not one third of that of New York. As a consequence the\r\nSenate of New York is said to be filled with men of a higher class\r\nthan are generally found in the Senates of other States. Then follows\r\nin the article a list of the districts which are to return the\r\nSenators. These districts consist of one, two, three, or in one case\r\nfour counties, according to the population.\r\n\r\nThe article does not give the number of members of the Lower House,\r\nnor does it even state what amount of population shall be held as\r\nentitled to a member. It merely provides for the division of the\r\nState into districts which shall contain an equal number, not of\r\npopulation, but of voters. The House of Assembly does consist of 128\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nIt is then stipulated that every member of both houses shall receive\r\nthree dollars a day, or twelve shillings, for their services during\r\nthe sitting of the legislature; but this sum is never to exceed 300\r\ndollars, or sixty pounds in one year, unless an extra Session be\r\ncalled. There is also an allowance for the travelling expenses of\r\nmembers. It is, I presume, generally known that the members of the\r\nCongress at Washington are all paid, and that the same is the case\r\nwith reference to the legislatures of all the States.\r\n\r\nNo member of the New York legislature can also be a member of the\r\nWashington Congress, or hold any civil or military office under the\r\ngeneral States Government.\r\n\r\nA majority of each House must be present, or as the article says,\r\n\"shall constitute a quorum to do business.\" Each House is to keep a\r\njournal of its proceedings. The doors are to be open,--except when\r\nthe public welfare shall require secresy. A singular proviso this in\r\na country boasting so much of freedom! For no speech or debate in\r\neither House shall the legislature be called in question in any other\r\nplace. The legislature assembles on the first Tuesday in January, and\r\nsits for about three months. Its seat is at Albany.\r\n\r\nThe executive power, (Art. IV.) is to be vested in a Governor and a\r\nLieutenant-Governor, both of whom shall be chosen for two years. The\r\nGovernor must be a citizen of the United States, must be thirty years\r\nof age, and have lived for the last four years in the State. He is\r\nto be commander-in-chief of the military and naval forces of the\r\nState,--as is the President of those of the Union. I see that this\r\nis also the case in inland States, which one would say can have\r\nno navies. And with reference to some States it is enacted that\r\nthe Governor is commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and militia,\r\nshowing that some army over and beyond the militia may be kept by the\r\nState. In Tennessee, which is an inland State, it is enacted that the\r\nGovernor shall be \"commander-in-chief of the army and navy of this\r\nState, and of the militia, except when they shall be called into the\r\nservice of the United States.\" In Ohio the same is the case, except\r\nthat there is no mention of militia. In New York there is no proviso\r\nwith reference to the service of the United States. I mention this\r\nas it bears with some strength on the question of the right of\r\nsecession, and indicates the jealousy of the individual States\r\nwith reference to the Federal Government. The Governor can convene\r\nextra Sessions of one House or of both. He makes a message to the\r\nlegislature when it meets,--a sort of Queen's speech; and he receives\r\nfor his services a compensation, to be established by law. In New\r\nYork this amounts to £800 a year. In some States this is as low as\r\n£200 and £300. In Virginia it is £1000. In California £1200.\r\n\r\nThe Governor can pardon, except in cases of treason. He has also a\r\nveto upon all bills sent up by the legislature. If he exercise this\r\nveto he returns the bill to the legislature with his reasons for so\r\ndoing. If the bill on reconsideration by the Houses be again passed\r\nby a majority of two thirds in each House, it becomes law in spite\r\nof the Governor's veto. The veto of the President at Washington is\r\nof the same nature. Such are the powers of the Governor. But though\r\nthey are very full, the Governor of each State does not practically\r\nexercise any great political power, nor is he, even politically, a\r\ngreat man. You might live in a State during the whole term of his\r\ngovernment and hardly hear of him. There is vested in him by the\r\nlanguage of the constitution a much wider power than that intrusted\r\nto the Governors of our colonies. But in our colonies everybody\r\ntalks, and thinks, and knows about the Governor. As far as the limits\r\nof the colony the Governor is a great man. But this is not the case\r\nwith reference to the Governors in the different States.\r\n\r\nThe next article provides that the Governor's ministers, viz., the\r\nSecretary of State, the Comptroller, Treasurer, and Attorney-General,\r\nshall be chosen every two years at a general election. In\r\nthis respect the State constitution differs from that of the\r\nnational constitution. The President at Washington names his own\r\nministers,--subject to the approbation of the Senate. He makes\r\nmany other appointments with the same limitation. As regards these\r\nnominations in general, the Senate, I believe, is not slow to\r\ninterfere; but with reference to the ministers it is understood that\r\nthe names sent in by the President shall stand. Of the Secretary\r\nof State, Comptroller, &c., belonging to the different States, and\r\nwho are elected by the people, in a general way one never hears. No\r\ndoubt they attend their offices and take their pay, but they are not\r\npolitical personages.\r\n\r\nThe next article, No. VI., refers to the Judiciary, and is very\r\ncomplicated. After considerable study I have failed to understand it.\r\nThe judges are elected by vote, and remain in office for, I believe,\r\na term of eight years. In Sect. 20 of this article it is provided\r\nthat--\"No judicial officer, except Justices of the Peace, shall\r\nreceive to his own use any fees or perquisites of office.\" How\r\npleasantly this enactment must sound in the ears of the justices of\r\nthe peace.\r\n\r\nArticle VII. refers to fiscal matters, and is more especially\r\ninteresting as showing how greatly the State of New York has depended\r\non its canals for its wealth. These canals are the property of the\r\nState; and by this article it seems to be provided that they shall\r\nnot only maintain themselves, but maintain to a considerable extent\r\nthe State expenditure also, and stand in lieu of taxation. It is\r\nprovided, Section 6, that the \"legislature shall not sell, lease, or\r\notherwise dispose of any of the canals of the State; but that they\r\nshall remain the property of the State, and under its management for\r\never.\" But in spite of its canals the State does not seem to be doing\r\nvery well, for I see that in 1860, its income was 4,780,000 dollars,\r\nand its expenditure 5,100,000, whereas its debt was 32,500,000\r\ndollars. Of all the States, Pennsylvania is the most indebted,\r\nVirginia is the second on the list, and New York the third. New\r\nHampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware, and Texas, owe no State\r\ndebts. All the other State ships have taken in ballast.\r\n\r\nThe militia is supposed to consist of all men capable of bearing\r\narms, under forty-five years of age. But no one need be enrolled, who\r\nfrom scruples of conscience is averse to bearing arms. At the present\r\nmoment such scruples do not seem to be very general. Then follows,\r\nin Article XI., a detailed enactment as to the choosing of militia\r\nofficers. It may be perhaps sufficient to say that the privates\r\nare to choose the captains and the subalterns; the captains and\r\nsubalterns are to choose the field officers; and the field officers\r\nthe brigadier-generals and inspectors of brigade. The Governor,\r\nhowever, with the consent of the Senate shall nominate all\r\nmajor-generals. Now that real soldiers have unfortunately become\r\nnecessary the above plan has not been found to work well.\r\n\r\nSuch is the Constitution of the State of New York, which has been\r\nintended to work and does work quite separately from that of the\r\nUnited States. It will be seen that the purport has been to make it\r\nas widely democratic as possible,--to provide that all power of all\r\ndescription shall come directly from the people, and that such power\r\nshall return to the people at short intervals. The Senate and the\r\nGovernor each remain for two years, but not for the same two years.\r\nIf a new Senate commence its work in 1861, a new Governor will come\r\nin in 1862. But, nevertheless, there is in the form of Government\r\nas thus established an absence of that close and immediate\r\nresponsibility which attends our ministers. When a man has been\r\nvoted in, it seems that responsibility is over for the period of\r\nthe required service. He has been chosen, and the country which has\r\nchosen him is to trust that he will do his best. I do not know that\r\nthis matters much with reference to the legislature or governments of\r\nthe different States, for their State legislatures and governments\r\nare but puny powers; but in the legislature and government at\r\nWashington it does matter very much. But I shall have another\r\nopportunity of speaking on that subject.\r\n\r\nNothing has struck me so much in America as the fact that these State\r\nlegislatures are puny powers. The absence of any tidings whatever\r\nof their doings across the water is a proof of this. Who has heard\r\nof the legislature of New York or of Massachusetts? It is boasted\r\nhere that their insignificance is a sign of the well-being of the\r\npeople;--that the smallness of the power necessary for carrying on\r\nthe machine shows how beautifully the machine is organised, and how\r\nwell it works. \"It is better to have little governors than great\r\ngovernors,\" an American said to me once. \"It is our glory that we\r\nknow how to live without having great men over us to rule us.\" That\r\nglory, if ever it were a glory, has come to an end. It seems to me\r\nthat all these troubles have come upon the States because they have\r\nnot placed high men in high places. The less of laws and the less of\r\ncontrol the better, providing a people can go right with few laws and\r\nlittle control. One may say that no laws and no control would be best\r\nof all,--provided that none were needed. But this is not exactly the\r\nposition of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe two professions of law-making and of governing have become\r\nunfashionable, low in estimation, and of no repute in the States.\r\nThe municipal powers of the cities have not fallen into the hands of\r\nthe leading men. The word politician has come to bear the meaning of\r\npolitical adventurer and almost of political blackleg. If A calls B\r\na politician A intends to vilify B by so calling him. Whether or no\r\nthe best citizens of a State will ever be induced to serve in the\r\nState legislature by a nobler consideration than that of pay, or by a\r\nhigher tone of political morals than that now existing, I cannot say.\r\nIt seems to me that some great decrease in the numbers of the State\r\nlegislators should be a first step towards such a consummation. There\r\nare not many men in each State who can afford to give up two or three\r\nmonths of the year to the State service for nothing; but it may be\r\npresumed that in each State there are a few. Those who are induced\r\nto devote their time by the payment of £60, can hardly be the men\r\nmost fitted for the purpose of legislation. It certainly has seemed\r\nto me that the members of the State legislatures and of the State\r\ngovernments are not held in that respect and treated with that\r\nconfidence to which, in the eyes of an Englishman, such functionaries\r\nshould be held as entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom New York we returned to Boston by Hartford, the capital, or one\r\nof the capitals of Connecticut. This proud little State is composed\r\nof two old provinces, of which Hartford and Newhaven were the two\r\nmetropolitan towns. Indeed there was a third colony called Saybrook,\r\nwhich was joined to Hartford. As neither of the two could of course\r\ngive way when Hartford and Newhaven were made into one, the houses\r\nof legislature and the seat of government are changed about, year by\r\nyear. Connecticut is a very proud little State, and has a pleasant\r\nlegend of its own stanchness in the old colonial days. In 1662 the\r\ncolonies were united, and a charter was given to them by Charles II.\r\nBut some years later, in 1686, when the bad days of James II. had\r\ncome, this charter was considered to be too liberal, and order was\r\ngiven that it should be suspended. One Sir Edmund Andross had been\r\nappointed governor of all New England, and sent word from Boston to\r\nConnecticut that the charter itself should be given up to him. This\r\nthe men of Connecticut refused to do. Whereupon Sir Edmund with a\r\nmilitary following presented himself at their assembly, declared\r\ntheir governing powers to be dissolved, and after much palaver\r\ncaused the charter itself to be laid upon the table before him. The\r\ndiscussion had been long, having lasted through the day into the\r\nnight, and the room had been lighted with candles. On a sudden each\r\nlight disappeared, and Sir Edmund with his followers were in the\r\ndark. As a matter of course, when the light was restored the charter\r\nwas gone, and Sir Edmund, the governor-general, was baffled, as all\r\ngovernors-general and all Sir Edmunds always are in such cases. The\r\ncharter was gone, a gallant Captain Wadsworth having carried it off\r\nand hidden it in an oak tree. The charter was renewed when William\r\nIII. came to the throne, and now hangs triumphantly in the State\r\nHouse at Hartford. The charter oak has, alas! succumbed to the\r\nweather, but was standing a few years since. The men of Hartford are\r\nvery proud of their charter, and regard it as the parent of their\r\nexisting liberties quite as much as though no national revolution of\r\ntheir own had intervened.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the Northern States of the Union, especially those of New\r\nEngland, refer all their liberties to the old charters which they\r\nheld from the mother-country. They rebelled, as they themselves would\r\nseem to say, and set themselves up as a separate people, not because\r\nthe mother-country had refused to them by law sufficient liberty and\r\nsufficient self-control, but because the mother-country infringed the\r\nliberties and powers of self-control which she herself had given. The\r\nmother-country, so these States declare, had acted the part of Sir\r\nEdmund Andross, had endeavoured to take away their charters. So they\r\nalso put out the lights, and took themselves to an oak tree of their\r\nown,--which is still standing, though winds from the infernal regions\r\nare now battering its branches. Long may it stand!\r\n\r\nWhether the mother-country did or did not infringe the charters\r\nshe had given, I will not here inquire. As to the nature of those\r\nalleged infringements, are they not written down to the number of\r\ntwenty-seven in the Declaration of Independence? I have taken the\r\nliberty of appending this Declaration to the end of my book, and the\r\ntwenty-seven paragraphs may all be seen. They mostly begin with He.\r\n\"He\" has done this, and \"He\" has done that. The \"He\" is poor George\r\nIII., whose twenty-seven mortal sins against his transatlantic\r\ncolonies are thus recapitulated. It would avail nothing to argue now\r\nwhether those deeds were sins or virtues; nor would it have availed\r\nthen. The child had grown up and was strong, and chose to go alone\r\ninto the world. The young bird was fledged, and flew away. Poor\r\nGeorge III. with his cackling was certainly not efficacious in\r\nrestraining such a flight. But it is gratifying to see how this new\r\npeople, when they had it in their power to change all their laws, to\r\nthrow themselves upon any Utopian theory that the folly of a wild\r\nphilanthropy could devise, to discard as abominable every vestige of\r\nEnglish rule and English power,--it is gratifying to see that when\r\nthey could have done all this, they did not do so, but preferred to\r\ncling to things English. Their old colonial limits were still to\r\nbe the borders of their States. Their old charters were still to\r\nbe regarded as the sources from whence their State powers had come.\r\nThe old laws were to remain in force. The precedents of the English\r\ncourts were to be held as legal precedents in the courts of the\r\nnew nation,--and are now so held. It was still to be England,--but\r\nEngland without a King making his last struggle for political power.\r\nThis was the idea of the people, and this was their feeling; and that\r\nidea has been carried out, and that feeling has remained.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of the State of New York nothing is said about\r\nthe religion of the people. It was regarded as a subject with\r\nwhich the constitution had no concern whatever. But as soon as we\r\ncome among the stricter people of New England we find that the\r\nconstitution-makers have not been able absolutely to ignore the\r\nsubject. In Connecticut it is enjoined that as it is the duty of all\r\nmen to worship the Supreme Being, and their right to render that\r\nworship in the mode most consistent with their consciences, no person\r\nshall be by law compelled to join or be classed with any religious\r\nassociation. The line of argument is hardly logical, the conclusion\r\nnot being in accordance with, or hanging on the first of the two\r\npremises. But nevertheless the meaning is clear. In a free country\r\nno man shall be made to worship after any special fashion; but it\r\nis decreed by the constitution that every man is bound by duty to\r\nworship after some fashion. The article then goes on to say how they\r\nwho do worship are to be taxed for the support of their peculiar\r\nchurch. I am not quite clear whether the New Yorkers have not managed\r\nthis difficulty with greater success. When we come to the old Bay\r\nState,--to Massachusetts,--we find the Christian religion spoken of\r\nin the Constitution as that which in some one of its forms should\r\nreceive the adherence of every good citizen.\r\n\r\nHartford is a pleasant little town, with English-looking houses, and\r\nan English-looking country around it. Here, as everywhere through the\r\nStates, one is struck by the size and comfort of the residences. I\r\nsojourned there at the house of a friend, and could find no limit to\r\nthe number of spacious sitting-rooms which it contained. The modest\r\ndining-room and drawing-room which suffice with us for men of seven\r\nor eight hundred a year would be regarded as very mean accommodation\r\nby persons of similar incomes in the States.\r\n\r\nI found that Hartford was all alive with trade, and that wages were\r\nhigh, because there are there two factories for the manufacture of\r\narms. Colt's pistols come from Hartford, as do also Sharpe's rifles.\r\nWherever arms can be prepared, or gunpowder; where clothes or\r\nblankets fit for soldiers can be made, or tents or standards, or\r\nthings appertaining in any way to warfare, there trade was still\r\nbrisk. No being is more costly in his requirements than a soldier,\r\nand no soldier so costly as the American. He must eat and drink of\r\nthe best, and have good boots and warm bedding, and good shelter.\r\nThere were during the Christmas of 1861 above half a million of\r\nsoldiers so to be provided,--the President, in his message made in\r\nDecember to Congress, declared the number to be above six hundred\r\nthousand--and therefore in such places as Hartford trade was very\r\nbrisk. I went over the rifle factory, and was shown everything, but\r\nI do not know that I brought away much with me that was worth any\r\nreader's attention. The best of rifles, I have no doubt, were being\r\nmade with the greatest rapidity, and all were sent to the army as\r\nsoon as finished. I saw some murderous-looking weapons, with swords\r\nattached to them instead of bayonets, but have since been told\r\nby soldiers that the old-fashioned bayonet is thought to be more\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nImmediately on my arrival in Boston I heard that Mr. Emerson was\r\ngoing to lecture at the Tremont Hall on the subject of the war, and\r\nI resolved to go and hear him. I was acquainted with Mr. Emerson,\r\nand by reputation knew him well. Among us in England he is regarded\r\nas transcendental, and perhaps even as mystic in his philosophy. His\r\n\"Representative Men\" is the work by which he is best known on our\r\nside of the water, and I have heard some readers declare that they\r\ncould not quite understand Mr. Emerson's \"Representative Men.\" For\r\nmyself, I confess that I had broken down over some portions of that\r\nbook. Since I had become acquainted with him I had read others of\r\nhis writings, especially his book on England, and had found that he\r\nimproved greatly on acquaintance. I think that he has confined his\r\nmysticism to the book above named. In conversation he is very clear,\r\nand by no means above the small practical things of the world. He\r\nwould, I fancy, know as well what interest he ought to receive for\r\nhis money as though he were no philosopher; and I am inclined to\r\nthink that if he held land he would make his hay while the sun shone,\r\nas might any common farmer. Before I had met Mr. Emerson, when my\r\nidea of him was formed simply on the \"Representative Men,\" I should\r\nhave thought that a lecture from him on the war would have taken\r\nhis hearers all among the clouds. As it was, I still had my doubts,\r\nand was inclined to fear that a subject which could only be handled\r\nusefully at such a time before a large audience by a combination of\r\ncommon sense, high principles, and eloquence, would hardly be safe in\r\nMr. Emerson's hands. I did not doubt the high principles, but feared\r\nmuch that there would be a lack of common sense. So many have talked\r\non that subject, and have shown so great a lack of common sense! As\r\nto the eloquence, that might be there, or might not.\r\n\r\nMr. Emerson is a Massachusetts man, very well known in Boston, and\r\na great crowd was collected to hear him. I suppose there were some\r\nthree thousand persons in the room. I confess that when he took his\r\nplace before us my prejudices were against him. The matter in hand\r\nrequired no philosophy. It required common sense, and the very best\r\nof common sense. It demanded that he should be impassioned, for of\r\nwhat interest can any address be on a matter of public politics\r\nwithout passion? But it demanded that the passion should be winnowed,\r\nand free from all rhodomontade. I fancied what might be said on\r\nsuch a subject as to that overlauded star-spangled banner, and how\r\nthe star-spangled flag would look when wrapped in a mist of mystic\r\nPlatonism.\r\n\r\nBut from the beginning to the end there was nothing mystic--no\r\nPlatonism; and, if I remember rightly, the star-spangled banner\r\nwas altogether omitted. To the national eagle he did allude. \"Your\r\nAmerican eagle,\" he said, \"is very well. Protect it here and abroad.\r\nBut beware of the American peacock.\" He gave an account of the war\r\nfrom the beginning, showing how it had arisen, and how it had been\r\nconducted; and he did so with admirable simplicity and truth. He\r\nthought the North were right about the war; and as I thought so\r\nalso, I was not called upon to disagree with him. He was terse and\r\nperspicuous in his sentences, practical in his advice, and, above all\r\nthings, true in what he said to his audience of themselves. They who\r\nknow America will understand how hard it is for a public man in the\r\nStates to practise such truth in his addresses. Fluid compliments and\r\nhigh-flown national eulogium are expected. In this instance none were\r\nforthcoming. The North had risen with patriotism to make this effort,\r\nand it was now warned that in doing so it was simply doing its\r\nnational duty. And then came the subject of slavery. I had been told\r\nthat Mr. Emerson was an abolitionist, and knew that I must disagree\r\nwith him on that head, if on no other. To me it has always seemed\r\nthat to mix up the question of general abolition with this war must\r\nbe the work of a man too ignorant to understand the real subject of\r\nthe war, or too false to his country to regard it. Throughout the\r\nwhole lecture I was waiting for Mr. Emerson's abolition doctrine,\r\nbut no abolition doctrine came. The words abolition and compensation\r\nwere mentioned, and then there was an end of the subject. If Mr.\r\nEmerson be an abolitionist he expressed his views very mildly on that\r\noccasion. On the whole the lecture was excellent, and that little\r\nadvice about the peacock was in itself worth an hour's attention.\r\n\r\nThat practice of lecturing is \"quite an institution\" in the States.\r\nSo it is in England, my readers will say. But in England it is done\r\nin a different way, with a different object and with much less of\r\nresult. With us, if I am not mistaken, lectures are mostly given\r\ngratuitously by the lecturer. They are got up here and there with\r\nsome philanthropical object, and in the hope that an hour at the\r\ndisposal of young men and women may be rescued from idleness. The\r\nsubjects chosen are social, literary, philanthropic, romantic,\r\ngeographical, scientific, religious,--anything rather than political.\r\nThe lecture-rooms are not usually filled to overflowing, and there is\r\noften a question whether the real good achieved is worth the trouble\r\ntaken. The most popular lectures are given by big people, whose\r\npresence is likely to be attractive; and the whole thing, I fear we\r\nmust confess, is not pre-eminently successful. In the Northern States\r\nof America the matter stands on a very different footing. Lectures\r\nthere are more popular than either theatres or concerts. Enormous\r\nhalls are built for them. Tickets for long courses are taken with\r\navidity. Very large sums are paid to popular lecturers, so that the\r\nprofession is lucrative,--more so, I am given to understand, than\r\nis the cognate profession of literature. The whole thing is done in\r\ngreat style. Music is introduced. The lecturer stands on a large\r\nraised platform, on which sit around him the bald and hoary-headed\r\nand superlatively wise. Ladies come in large numbers; especially\r\nthose who aspire to soar above the frivolities of the world. Politics\r\nis the subject most popular, and most general. The men and women of\r\nBoston could no more do without their lectures, than those of Paris\r\ncould without their theatres. It is the decorous diversion of the\r\nbest ordered of her citizens. The fast young men go to clubs, and the\r\nfast young women to dances, as fast young men and women do in other\r\nplaces that are wicked; but lecturing is the favourite diversion of\r\nthe steady-minded Bostonian. After all, I do not know that the result\r\nis very good. It does not seem that much will be gained by such\r\nlectures on either side of the Atlantic,--except that respectable\r\nkilling of an evening which might otherwise be killed less\r\nrespectably. It is but an industrious idleness, an attempt at a royal\r\nroad to information, that habit of attending lectures. Let any man or\r\nwoman say what he has brought away from any such attendance. It is\r\nattractive, that idea of being studious without any of the labour\r\nof study; but I fear it is illusive. If an evening can be so passed\r\nwithout ennui, I believe that that may be regarded as the best result\r\nto be gained. But then it so often happens that the evening is not\r\npassed without ennui! Of course in saying this, I am not alluding\r\nto lectures given in special places as a course of special study.\r\nMedical lectures, no doubt, are a necessary part of medical\r\neducation. As many as two or three thousand often attend these\r\npopular lectures in Boston, but I do not know whether on that account\r\nthe popular subjects are much better understood. Nevertheless I\r\nresolved to hear more, hoping that I might in that way teach myself\r\nto understand what were the popular politics in New England. Whether\r\nor no I may have learned this in any other way I do not perhaps know;\r\nbut at any rate I did not learn it in this way.\r\n\r\nThe next lecture which I attended was also given in the Tremont Hall,\r\nand on this occasion also the subject of the war was to be treated.\r\nThe special treachery of the rebels was, I think, the matter to be\r\ntaken in hand. On this occasion also the room was full, and my hopes\r\nof a pleasant hour ran high. For some fifteen minutes I listened, and\r\nI am bound to say that the gentleman discoursed in excellent English.\r\nHe was master of that wonderful fluency which is peculiarly the gift\r\nof an American. He went on from one sentence to another with rhythmic\r\ntones and unerring pronunciation. He never faltered, never repeated\r\nhis words, never fell into those vile half-muttered hems and haws\r\nby which an Englishman in such a position so generally betrays his\r\ntimidity. But during the whole time of my remaining in the room he\r\ndid not give expression to a single thought. He went on from one soft\r\nplatitude to another, and uttered words from which I would defy any\r\none of his audience to carry away with them anything. And yet it\r\nseemed to me that his audience was satisfied. I was not satisfied,\r\nand managed to escape out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe next lecturer to whom I listened was Mr. Everett. Mr. Everett's\r\nreputation as an orator is very great, and I was especially anxious\r\nto hear him. I had long since known that his power of delivery was\r\nvery marvellous; that his tones, elocution, and action were all\r\ngreat; and that he was able to command the minds and sympathies\r\nof his audience in a remarkable manner. His subject also was the\r\nwar;--or rather the causes of the war, and its qualification. Had the\r\nNorth given to the South cause of provocation? Had the South been\r\nfair and honest in its dealings to the North? Had any compromise been\r\npossible by which the war might have been avoided, and the rights and\r\ndignity of the North preserved? Seeing that Mr. Everett is a Northern\r\nman and was lecturing to a Boston audience, one knew well how these\r\nquestions would be answered, but the manner of the answering would be\r\neverything. This lecture was given at Roxboro', one of the suburbs\r\nof Boston. So I went out to Roxboro' with a party, and found myself\r\nhonoured by being placed on the platform among the bald-headed ones\r\nand the superlatively wise. This privilege is naturally gratifying,\r\nbut it entails on him who is so gratified the inconvenience of\r\nsitting at the lecturer's back, whereas it is perhaps better for the\r\nlistener to be before his face.\r\n\r\nI could not but be amused by one little scenic incident. When we all\r\nwent upon the platform, some one proposed that the clergymen should\r\nlead the way out of the waiting-room in which we bald-headed ones and\r\nsuperlatively wise were assembled. But to this the manager of the\r\naffair demurred. He wanted the clergymen for a purpose, he said. And\r\nso the profane ones led the way, and the clergymen, of whom there\r\nmight be some six or seven, clustered in around the lecturer at last.\r\nEarly in his discourse Mr. Everett told us what it was that the\r\ncountry needed at this period of her trial. Patriotism, courage, the\r\nbravery of the men, the good wishes of the women, the self-denial\r\nof all,--\"and,\" continued the lecturer, turning to his immediate\r\nneighbours, \"the prayers of these holy men whom I see around me.\" It\r\nhad not been for nothing that the clergymen were detained.\r\n\r\nMr. Everett lectures without any book or paper before him, and\r\ncontinues from first to last as though the words came from him on the\r\nspur of the moment. It is known, however, that it is his practice\r\nto prepare his orations with great care and commit them entirely to\r\nmemory, as does an actor. Indeed he repeats the same lecture over and\r\nover again, I am told, without the change of a word or of an action.\r\nI did not like Mr. Everett's lecture. I did not like what he said,\r\nor the seeming spirit in which it was framed. But I am bound to\r\nadmit that his power of oratory is very wonderful. Those among his\r\ncountrymen who have criticised his manner in my hearing have said\r\nthat he is too florid, that there is an affectation in the motion\r\nof his hands, and that the intended pathos of his voice sometimes\r\napproaches too near the precipice over which the fall is so deep and\r\nrapid, and at the bottom of which lies absolute ridicule. Judging for\r\nmyself, I did not find it so. My position for seeing was not good,\r\nbut my ear was not offended. Critics also should bear in mind that\r\nan orator does not speak chiefly to them or for their approval. He\r\nwho writes, or speaks, or sings for thousands, must write, speak, or\r\nsing as those thousands would have him. That to a dainty connoisseur\r\nwill be false music, which to the general ear shall be accounted as\r\nthe perfection of harmony. An eloquence altogether suited to the\r\nfastidious and hypercritical, would probably fail to carry off the\r\nhearts and interest the sympathies of the young and eager. As regards\r\nmanners, tone, and choice of words, I think that the oratory of Mr.\r\nEverett places him very high. His skill in his work is perfect. He\r\nnever falls back upon a word. He never repeats himself. His voice is\r\nalways perfectly under command. As for hesitation or timidity, the\r\ndays for those failings have long passed by with him. When he makes\r\na point, he makes it well, and drives it home to the intelligence of\r\nevery one before him. Even that appeal to the holy men around him\r\nsounded well,--or would have done so had I not been present at that\r\nlittle arrangement in the anteroom. On the audience at large it was\r\nmanifestly effective.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless the lecture gave me but a poor idea of Mr. Everett\r\nas a politician, though it made me regard him highly as an orator.\r\nIt was impossible not to perceive that he was anxious to utter the\r\nsentiments of the audience rather than his own;--that he was making\r\nhimself an echo, a powerful and harmonious echo of what he conceived\r\nto be public opinion in Boston at that moment;--that he was neither\r\nleading nor teaching the people before him, but allowing himself to\r\nbe led by them, so that he might best play his present part for their\r\ndelectation. He was neither bold nor honest, as Emerson had been, and\r\nI could not but feel that every tyro of a politician before him would\r\nthus recognize his want of boldness and of honesty. As a statesman,\r\nor as a critic of statecraft and of other statesmen, he is wanting\r\nin backbone. For many years Mr. Everett has been not even inimical\r\nto southern politics and southern courses, nor was he among those\r\nwho, during the last eight years previous to Mr. Lincoln's election,\r\nfought the battle for northern principles. I do not say that on this\r\naccount he is now false to advocate the war. But he cannot carry\r\nmen with him when, at his age, he advocates it by arguments opposed\r\nto the tenour of his long political life. His abuse of the South\r\nand of southern ideas was as virulent as might be that of a young\r\nlad now beginning his political career, or of one who had through\r\nlife advocated abolition principles. He heaped reproaches on poor\r\nVirginia, whose position as the chief of the border States has given\r\nto her hardly the possibility of avoiding a Scylla of ruin on the\r\none side, or a Charybdis of rebellion on the other. When he spoke as\r\nhe did of Virginia, ridiculing the idea of her sacred soil, even I,\r\nEnglishman as I am, could not but think of Washington, of Jefferson,\r\nof Randolph, and of Madison. He should not have spoken of Virginia\r\nas he did speak; for no man could have known better Virginia's\r\ndifficulties. But Virginia was at a discount in Boston, and Mr.\r\nEverett was speaking to a Boston audience. And then he referred to\r\nEngland and to Europe. Mr. Everett has been minister to England, and\r\nknows the people. He is a student of history, and must, I think,\r\nknow that England's career has not been unhappy or unprosperous.\r\nBut England also was at a discount in Boston, and Mr. Everett was\r\nspeaking to a Boston audience. They are sending us their advice\r\nacross the water, said Mr. Everett. And what is their advice to\r\nus? that we should come down from the high place we have built for\r\nourselves, and be even as they are. They screech at us from the low\r\ndepths in which they are wallowing in their misery, and call on us to\r\njoin them in their wretchedness. I am not quoting Mr. Everett's very\r\nwords, for I have not them by me; but I am not making them stronger,\r\nnor so strong as he made them. As I thought of Mr. Everett's\r\nreputation, and of his years of study,--of his long political life\r\nand unsurpassed sources of information,--I could not but grieve\r\nheartily when I heard such words fall from him. I could not but\r\nask myself whether it were impossible that under the present\r\ncircumstances of her constitution this great nation of America should\r\nproduce an honest, high-minded statesman. When Lincoln and Hamlin,\r\nthe existing President and Vice-President of the States, were in 1860\r\nas yet but the candidates of the republican party, Bell and Everett\r\nalso were the candidates of the old whig, conservative party. Their\r\nexpress theory was this,--that the question of slavery should\r\nnot be touched. Their purpose was to crush agitation and restore\r\nharmony by an impartial balance between the North and South: a fine\r\npurpose,--the finest of all purposes, had it been practicable. But\r\nsuch a course of compromise was now at a discount in Boston, and\r\nMr. Everett was speaking to a Boston audience. As an orator, Mr.\r\nEverett's excellence is, I think, not to be questioned; but as a\r\npolitician I cannot give him a high rank.\r\n\r\nAfter that I heard Mr. Wendell Phillips. Of him, too, as an orator\r\nall the world of Massachusetts speaks with great admiration, and I\r\nhave no doubt so speaks with justice. He is, however, known as the\r\nhottest and most impassioned advocate of abolition. Not many months\r\nsince the cause of abolition, as advocated by him, was so unpopular\r\nin Boston, that Mr. Phillips was compelled to address his audience\r\nsurrounded by a guard of policemen. Of this gentleman, I may at any\r\nrate say that he is consistent, devoted, and disinterested. He is an\r\nabolitionist by profession, and seeks to find in every turn of the\r\ntide of politics some stream on which he may bring himself nearer\r\nto his object. In the old days, previous to the selection of Mr.\r\nLincoln, in days so old that they are now nearly eighteen months\r\npast, Mr. Phillips was an anti-Union man. He advocated strongly the\r\ndisseverance of the Union, so that the country to which he belonged\r\nmight have hands clean from the taint of slavery. He had probably\r\nacknowledged to himself, that while the North and South were bound\r\ntogether no hope existed of emancipation, but that if the North stood\r\nalone the South would become too weak to foster and keep alive the\r\n\"social institution.\" In which, if such were his opinions, I am\r\ninclined to agree with him. But now he is all for the Union, thinking\r\nthat a victorious North can compel the immediate emancipation of\r\nsouthern slaves. As to which I beg to say that I am bold to differ\r\nfrom Mr. Phillips altogether.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident to me that Mr. Phillips was unwell, and\r\nlecturing at a disadvantage. His manner was clearly that of an\r\naccustomed orator, but his voice was weak, and he was not up to\r\nthe effect which he attempted to make. His hearers were impatient,\r\nrepeatedly calling upon him to speak out, and on that account I tried\r\nhard to feel kindly towards him and his lecture. But I must confess\r\nthat I failed. To me it seemed that the doctrine he preached was one\r\nof rapine, bloodshed, and social destruction. He would call upon the\r\nGovernment and upon Congress to enfranchise the slaves at once,--now\r\nduring the war,--so that the Southern power might be destroyed by\r\na concurrence of misfortunes. And he would do so at once, on the\r\nspur of the moment, fearing lest the South should be before him,\r\nand themselves emancipate their own bondsmen. I have sometimes\r\nthought that there is no being so venomous, so bloodthirsty as a\r\nprofessed philanthropist; and that when the philanthropist's ardour\r\nlies negro-wards, it then assumes the deepest die of venom and\r\nbloodthirstiness. There are four millions of slaves in the southern\r\nStates, none of whom have any capacity for self-maintenance or\r\nself-control. Four millions of slaves, with the necessities of\r\nchildren, with the passions of men, and the ignorance of savages!\r\nAnd Mr. Phillips would emancipate these at a blow; would, were it\r\npossible for him to do so, set them loose upon the soil to tear\r\ntheir masters, destroy each other, and make such a hell upon the\r\nearth as has never even yet come from the uncontrolled passions\r\nand unsatisfied wants of men. But Congress cannot do this. All\r\nthe members of Congress put together cannot, according to the\r\nconstitution of the United States, emancipate a single slave in South\r\nCarolina; not if they were all unanimous. No emancipation in a Slave\r\nState can come otherwise than by the legislative enactment of that\r\nState. But it was then thought that in this coming winter of 1860-61\r\nthe action of Congress might be set aside. The North possessed an\r\nenormous army under the control of the President. The South was in\r\nrebellion, and the President could pronounce, and the army perhaps\r\nenforce, the confiscation of all property held in slaves. If any who\r\nheld them were not disloyal, the question of compensation might be\r\nsettled afterwards. How those four million slaves should live, and\r\nhow white men should live among them, in some States or parts of\r\nStates not equal to the blacks in number;--as to that Mr. Phillips\r\ndid not give us his opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Phillips also could not keep his tongue away from the\r\nabominations of Englishmen and the miraculous powers of his own\r\ncountrymen. It was on this occasion that he told us more than\r\nonce how Yankees carried brains in their fingers, whereas \"common\r\npeople\"--alluding by that name to Europeans--had them only, if at\r\nall, inside their brain-pans. And then he informed us that Lord\r\nPalmerston had always hated America. Among the Radicals there might\r\nbe one or two who understood and valued the institutions of America,\r\nbut it was a well-known fact that Lord Palmerston was hostile to\r\nthe country. Nothing but hidden enmity,--enmity hidden or not\r\nhidden,--could be expected from England. That the people of Boston,\r\nor of Massachusetts, or of the North generally, should feel sore\r\nagainst England is to me intelligible. I know how the minds of men\r\nare moved in masses to certain feelings, and that it ever must be so.\r\nMen in common talk are not bound to weigh their words, to think, and\r\nspeculate on their results, and be sure of the premises on which\r\ntheir thoughts are founded. But it is different with a man who rises\r\nbefore two or three thousand of his countrymen to teach and instruct\r\nthem. After that I heard no more political lectures in Boston.\r\n\r\nOf course I visited Bunker's Hill, and went to Lexington and Concord.\r\nFrom the top of the monument on Bunker's Hill there is a fine view of\r\nBoston Harbour, and seen from thence the harbour is picturesque. The\r\nmouth is crowded with islands and jutting necks and promontories;\r\nand though the shores are in no place rich enough to make the\r\nscenery grand, the general effect is good. The monument, however,\r\nis so constructed that one can hardly get a view through the\r\nwindows at the top of it, and there is no outside gallery round it.\r\nImmediately below the monument is a marble figure of Major Warren,\r\nwho fell there,--not from the top of the monument, as some one\r\nwas led to believe when informed that on that spot the Major had\r\nfallen. Bunker's Hill, which is little more than a mound, is at\r\nCharleston,--a dull, populous, respectable, and very unattractive\r\nsuburb of Boston.\r\n\r\nBunker's Hill has obtained a considerable name, and is accounted\r\ngreat in the annals of American history. In England we have all\r\nheard of Bunker's Hill, and some of us dislike the sound as much as\r\nFrenchmen do that of Waterloo. In the States men talk of Bunker's\r\nHill as we may, perhaps, talk of Agincourt and such favourite fields.\r\nBut, after all, little was done at Bunker's Hill, and, as far as\r\nI can learn, no victory was gained there by either party. The road\r\nfrom Boston to the town of Concord, on which stands the village of\r\nLexington, is the true scene of the earliest and greatest deeds of\r\nthe men of Boston. The monument at Bunker's Hill stands high and\r\ncommands attention, while those at Lexington and Concord are very\r\nlowly and command no attention. But it is of that road and what was\r\ndone on it that Massachusetts should be proud. When the colonists\r\nfirst began to feel that they were oppressed, and a half resolve was\r\nmade to resist that oppression by force, they began to collect a\r\nfew arms and some gunpowder at Concord, a small town about eighteen\r\nmiles from Boston. Of this preparation the English Governor received\r\ntidings, and determined to send a party of soldiers to seize the\r\narms. This he endeavoured to do secretly; but he was too closely\r\nwatched, and word was sent down over the waters by which Boston\r\nwas then surrounded that the colonists might be prepared for the\r\nsoldiers. At that time Boston Neck, as it was and is still called,\r\nwas the only connection between the town and the main land, and\r\nthe road over Boston Neck did not lead to Concord. Boats therefore\r\nwere necessarily used, and there was some difficulty in getting the\r\nsoldiers to the nearest point. They made their way, however, to\r\nthe road, and continued their route as far as Lexington without\r\ninterruption. Here, however, they were attacked, and the first blood\r\nof that war was shed. They shot three or four of the--rebels, I\r\nsuppose I should in strict language call them, and then proceeded\r\non to Concord. But at Concord they were stopped and repulsed, and\r\nalong the road back from Concord to Lexington they were driven with\r\nslaughter and dismay. And thus the rebellion was commenced which led\r\nto the establishment of a people which, let us Englishmen say and\r\nthink what we may of them at this present moment, has made itself one\r\nof the five great nations of the earth, and has enabled us to boast\r\nthat the two out of the five who enjoy the greatest liberty and\r\nthe widest prosperity, speak the English language and are known by\r\nEnglish names. For all that has come and is like to come, I say\r\nagain, long may that honour remain. I could not but feel that that\r\nroad from Boston to Concord deserves a name in the world's history\r\ngreater, perhaps, than has yet been given to it.\r\n\r\nConcord is at present to be noted as the residence of Mr. Emerson and\r\nof Mr. Hawthorne, two of those many men of letters of whose presence\r\nBoston and its neighbourhood have reason to be proud. Of Mr. Emerson\r\nI have already spoken. The author of the \"Scarlet Letter\" I regard\r\nas certainly the first of American novelists. I know what men will\r\nsay of Mr. Cooper,--and I also am an admirer of Cooper's novels. But\r\nI cannot think that Mr. Cooper's powers were equal to those of Mr.\r\nHawthorne, though his mode of thought may have been more genial, and\r\nhis choice of subjects more attractive in their day. In point of\r\nimagination, which, after all, is the novelist's greatest gift, I\r\nhardly know any living author who can be accounted superior to Mr.\r\nHawthorne.\r\n\r\nVery much has, undoubtedly, been done in Boston to carry out\r\nthat theory of Colonel Newcome's--_Emollit mores_, by which the\r\nColonel meant to signify his opinion that a competent knowledge of\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, with a taste for enjoying those\r\naccomplishments, goes very far towards the making of a man, and will\r\nby no means mar a gentleman. In Boston nearly every man, woman, and\r\nchild has had his or her manners so far softened; and though they may\r\nstill occasionally be somewhat rough to the outer touch, the inward\r\neffect is plainly visible. With us, especially among our agricultural\r\npopulation, the absence of that inner softening is as visible.\r\n\r\nI went to see a public library in the city, which, if not founded by\r\nMr. Bates whose name is so well known in London as connected with the\r\nhouse of Messrs. Baring, has been greatly enriched by him. It is by\r\nhis money that it has been enabled to do its work. In this library\r\nthere is a certain number of thousands of volumes--a great many\r\nvolumes, as there are in most public libraries. There are books of\r\nall classes, from ponderous unreadable folios, of which learned men\r\nknow the title-pages, down to the lightest literature. Novels are by\r\nno means eschewed,--are rather, if I understood aright, considered\r\nas one of the staples of the library. From this library any book,\r\nexcepting such rare volumes as in all libraries are considered holy,\r\nis given out to any inhabitant of Boston, without any payment, on\r\npresentation of a simple request on a prepared form. In point of\r\nfact, it is a gratuitous circulating library open to all Boston, rich\r\nor poor, young or old. The books seemed in general to be confided\r\nto young children, who came as messengers from their fathers and\r\nmothers, or brothers and sisters. No question whatever is asked,\r\nif the applicant is known or the place of his residence undoubted.\r\nIf there be no such knowledge, or there be any doubt as to the\r\nresidence, the applicant is questioned, the object being to confine\r\nthe use of the library to the _bonâ fide_ inhabitants of the city.\r\nPractically the books are given to those who ask for them, whoever\r\nthey may be. Boston contains over 200,000 inhabitants, and all those\r\n200,000 are entitled to them. Some twenty men and women are kept\r\nemployed from morning to night in carrying on this circulating\r\nlibrary; and there is, moreover, attached to the establishment a\r\nlarge reading-room supplied with papers and magazines, open to the\r\npublic of Boston on the same terms.\r\n\r\nOf course I asked whether a great many of the books were not lost,\r\nstolen, and destroyed; and of course I was told that there were no\r\nlosses, no thefts, and no destruction. As to thefts, the librarian\r\ndid not seem to think that any instance of such an occurrence could\r\nbe found. Among the poorer classes a book might sometimes be lost\r\nwhen they were changing their lodgings, but anything so lost was\r\nmore than replaced by the fines. A book is taken out for a week,\r\nand if not brought back at the end of that week, when the loan can\r\nbe renewed if the reader wishes, a fine, I think of two cents, is\r\nincurred. The children, when too late with the books, bring in the\r\ntwo cents as a matter of course, and the sum so collected fully\r\nreplaces all losses. It was all _couleur de rose_; the librarianesses\r\nlooked very pretty and learned, and, if I remember aright, mostly\r\nwore spectacles; the head librarian was enthusiastic; the nice\r\ninstructive books were properly dogs-eared; my own productions were\r\nin enormous demand; the call for books over the counter was brisk,\r\nand the reading-room was full of readers.\r\n\r\nIt has, I dare say, occurred to other travellers to remark that the\r\nproceedings at such institutions, when visited by them on their\r\ntravels, are always rose coloured. It is natural that the bright side\r\nshould be shown to the visitor. It may be that many books are called\r\nfor and returned unread, that many of those taken out are so taken by\r\npersons who ought to pay for their novels at circulating libraries,\r\nthat the librarian and librarianesses get very tired of their long\r\nhours of attendance,--for I found that they were very long;--and\r\nthat many idlers warm themselves in that reading-room: nevertheless\r\nthe fact remains,--the library is public to all the men and women in\r\nBoston, and books are given out without payment to all who may choose\r\nto ask for them. Why should not the great Mr. Mudie emulate Mr.\r\nBates, and open a library in London on the same system?\r\n\r\nThe librarian took me into one special room, of which he himself kept\r\nthe key, to show me a present which the library had received from the\r\nEnglish Government. The room was filled with volumes of two sizes,\r\nall bound alike, containing descriptions and drawings of all the\r\npatents taken out in England. According to this librarian such a work\r\nwould be invaluable as to American patents; but he conceived that the\r\nsubject had become too confused to render any such an undertaking\r\npossible. \"I never allow a single volume to be used for a moment\r\nwithout the presence of myself or one of my assistants,\" said the\r\nlibrarian; and then he explained to me, when I asked him why he was\r\nso particular, that the drawings would, as a matter of course, be cut\r\nout and stolen if he omitted his care. \"But they may be copied,\" I\r\nsaid. \"Yes; but if Jones merely copies one, Smith may come after him\r\nand copy it also. Jones will probably desire to hinder Smith from\r\nhaving any evidence of such a patent.\" As to the ordinary borrowing\r\nand returning of books, the poorest labourer's child in Boston might\r\nbe trusted as honest; but when a question of trade came up, of\r\ncommercial competition, then the librarian was bound to bethink\r\nhimself that his countrymen are very smart. \"I hope,\" said the\r\nlibrarian, \"you will let them know in England how grateful we are for\r\ntheir present.\" And I hereby execute that librarian's commission.\r\n\r\nI shall always look back to social life in Boston with great\r\npleasure. I met there many men and women whom to know is a\r\ndistinction, and with whom to be intimate is a great delight. It was\r\na Puritan city, in which strict old Roundhead sentiments and laws\r\nused to prevail; but now-a-days ginger is hot in the mouth there, and\r\nin spite of the war there were cakes and ale. There was a law passed\r\nin Massachusetts in the old days that any girl should be fined and\r\nimprisoned who allowed a young man to kiss her. That law has now, I\r\nthink, fallen into abeyance, and such matters are regulated in Boston\r\nmuch as they are in other large towns further eastward. It still,\r\nI conceive, calls itself a Puritan city, but it has divested its\r\nPuritanism of austerity, and clings rather to the politics and public\r\nbearing of its old fathers than to their social manners and pristine\r\nseverity of intercourse. The young girls are, no doubt, much more\r\ncomfortable under the new dispensation,--and the elderly men also,\r\nas I fancy. Sunday, as regards the outer streets, is sabbatical. But\r\nSunday evenings within doors I always found to be what my friends in\r\nthat country call \"quite a good time.\" It is not the thing in Boston\r\nto smoke in the streets during the day; but the wisest, the sagest,\r\nand the most holy,--even those holy men whom the lecturer saw around\r\nhim,--seldom refuse a cigar in the dining-room as soon as the ladies\r\nhave gone. Perhaps even the wicked weed would make its appearance\r\nbefore that sad eclipse, thereby postponing, or perhaps absolutely\r\nannihilating, the melancholy period of widowhood to both parties,\r\nand would light itself under the very eyes of those who in sterner\r\ncities will lend no countenance to such lightings. Ah me, it was very\r\npleasant! I confess I like this abandonment of the stricter rules of\r\nthe more decorous world. I fear that there is within me an aptitude\r\nto the milder debaucheries which makes such deviations pleasant. I\r\nlike to drink and I like to smoke, but I do not like to turn women\r\nout of the room. Then comes the question whether one can have all\r\nthat one likes together. In some small circles in New England I found\r\npeople simple enough to fancy that they could. In Massachusetts the\r\nMaine Liquor Law is still the law of the land, but, like that other\r\nlaw to which I have alluded, it has fallen very much out of use. At\r\nany rate it had not reached the houses of the gentlemen with whom I\r\nhad the pleasure of making acquaintance. But here I must guard myself\r\nfrom being misunderstood. I saw but one drunken man through all New\r\nEngland, and he was very respectable. He was, however, so uncommonly\r\ndrunk that he might be allowed to count for two or three. The\r\nPuritans of Boston are, of course, simple in their habits and simple\r\nin their expenses. Champagne and canvas-back ducks I found to be the\r\nprovisions most in vogue among those who desired to adhere closely to\r\nthe manners of their forefathers. Upon the whole I found the ways of\r\nlife which had been brought over in the \"Mayflower\" from the stern\r\nsects of England, and preserved through the revolutionary war for\r\nliberty, to be very pleasant ways, and I made up my mind that a\r\nYankee Puritan can be an uncommonly pleasant fellow. I wish that some\r\nof them did not dine so early; for when a man sits down at half-past\r\ntwo, that keeping up of the after-dinner recreations till bedtime\r\nbecomes hard work.\r\n\r\nIn Boston the houses are very spacious and excellent, and they are\r\nalways furnished with those luxuries which it is so difficult to\r\nintroduce into an old house. They have hot and cold water pipes\r\ninto every room, and baths attached to the bed-chambers. It is not\r\nonly that comfort is increased by such arrangements, but that much\r\nlabour is saved. In an old English house it will occupy a servant\r\nthe best part of the day to carry water up and down for a large\r\nfamily. Everything also is spacious, commodious, and well lighted.\r\nI certainly think that in house building the Americans have gone\r\nbeyond us, for even our new houses are not commodious as are theirs.\r\nOne practice which they have in their cities would hardly suit our\r\nlimited London spaces. When the body of the house is built, they\r\nthrow out the dining-room behind. It stands alone, as it were, with\r\nno other chamber above it, and removed from the rest of the house.\r\nIt is consequently behind the double drawing-rooms which form the\r\nground-floor, and is approached from them, and also from the back of\r\nthe hall. The second entrance to the dining-room is thus near the top\r\nof the kitchen stairs, which no doubt is its proper position. The\r\nwhole of the upper part of the house is thus kept for the private\r\nuses of the family. To me this plan of building recommended itself as\r\nbeing very commodious.\r\n\r\nI found the spirit for the war quite as hot at Boston now (in\r\nNovember), if not hotter than it was when I was there ten weeks\r\nearlier; and I found also, to my grief, that the feeling against\r\nEngland was as strong. I can easily understand how difficult it must\r\nhave been, and still must be, to Englishmen at home to understand\r\nthis, and see how it has come to pass. It has not arisen, as I think,\r\nfrom the old jealousy of England. It has not sprung from that source\r\nwhich for years has induced certain newspapers, especially the \"New\r\nYork Herald\" to vilify England. I do not think that the men of New\r\nEngland have ever been, as regards this matter, in the same boat with\r\nthe \"New York Herald.\" But when this war between the North and South\r\nfirst broke out, even before there was as yet a war, the Northern men\r\nhad taught themselves to expect what they called British sympathy,\r\nmeaning British encouragement. They regarded, and properly regarded,\r\nthe action of the South as a rebellion, and said among themselves\r\nthat so staid and conservative a nation as Great Britain would surely\r\ncountenance them in quelling rebels. If not,--should it come to pass\r\nthat Great Britain should show no such countenance and sympathy for\r\nNorthern law, if Great Britain did not respond to her friend as\r\nshe was expected to respond, then it would appear that Cotton was\r\nking, at least in British eyes. The war did come, and Great Britain\r\nregarded the two parties as belligerents, standing, as far as she was\r\nconcerned, on equal grounds. This it was that first gave rise to that\r\nfretful anger against England which has gone so far towards ruining\r\nthe northern cause. We know how such passions are swelled by being\r\nventilated, and how they are communicated from mind to mind till they\r\nbecome national. Politicians--American politicians I here mean--have\r\ntheir own future careers ever before their eyes, and are driven\r\nto make capital where they can. Hence it is that such men as Mr.\r\nSeward in the cabinet, and Mr. Everett out of it, can reconcile it\r\nto themselves to speak as they have done of England. It was but the\r\nother day that Mr. Everett spoke in one of his orations of the hope\r\nthat still existed that the flag of the United States might still\r\nfloat over the whole continent of North America. What would he say of\r\nan English statesman who should speak of putting up the Union Jack\r\non the State House in Boston? Such words tell for the moment on the\r\nhearers, and help to gain some slight popularity; but they tell for\r\nmore than a moment on those who read them and remember them.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the capture of Messrs. Slidell and Mason. I was at\r\nBoston when those men were taken out of the \"Trent\" by the \"San\r\nJacinto,\" and brought to Fort Warren in Boston Harbour. Captain\r\nWilkes was the officer who had made the capture, and he immediately\r\nwas recognized as a hero. He was invited to banquets and fêted.\r\nSpeeches were made to him as speeches are commonly made to high\r\nofficers who come home, after many perils, victorious from the wars.\r\nHis health was drunk with great applause, and thanks were voted to\r\nhim by one of the Houses of Congress. It was said that a sword was\r\nto be given to him, but I do not think that the gift was consummated.\r\nShould it not have been a policeman's truncheon? Had he at the\r\nbest done anything beyond a policeman's work? Of Captain Wilkes\r\nno one would complain for doing policeman's duty. If his country\r\nwere satisfied with the manner in which he did it, England, if she\r\nquarrelled at all, would not quarrel with him. It may now and again\r\nbecome the duty of a brave officer to do work of so low a calibre. It\r\nis a pity that an ambitious sailor should find himself told off for\r\nso mean a task, but the world would know that it is not his fault.\r\nNo one could blame Captain Wilkes for acting policeman on the seas.\r\nBut who ever before heard of giving a man glory for achievements so\r\nlittle glorious? How Captain Wilkes must have blushed when those\r\nspeeches were made to him, when that talk about the sword came up,\r\nwhen the thanks arrived to him from Congress! An officer receives\r\nhis country's thanks when he has been in great peril, and has borne\r\nhimself gallantly through his danger; when he has endured the brunt\r\nof war, and come through it with victory; when he has exposed himself\r\non behalf of his country and singed his epaulets with an enemy's\r\nfire. Captain Wilkes tapped a merchantman on the shoulder in the high\r\nseas, and told him that his passengers were wanted. In doing this he\r\nshowed no lack of spirit, for it might be his duty; but where was his\r\nspirit when he submitted to be thanked for such work?\r\n\r\nAnd then there arose a clamour of justification among the lawyers;\r\njudges and ex-judges flew to Wheaton, Phillimore, and Lord Stowell.\r\nBefore twenty-four hours were over, every man and every woman in\r\nBoston were armed with precedents. Then there was the burning of the\r\n\"Caroline.\" England had improperly burned the \"Caroline\" on Lake\r\nErie, or rather in one of the American ports on Lake Erie, and had\r\nthen begged pardon. If the States had been wrong, they would beg\r\npardon; but whether wrong or right, they would not give up Slidell\r\nand Mason. But the lawyers soon waxed stronger. The men were\r\nmanifestly ambassadors, and as such contraband of war. Wilkes was\r\nquite right, only he should have seized the vessel also. He was quite\r\nright, for though Slidell and Mason might not be ambassadors, they\r\nwere undoubtedly carrying despatches. In a few hours there began to\r\nbe a doubt whether the men could be ambassadors, because if called\r\nambassadors, then the power that sent the embassy must be presumed to\r\nbe recognized. That Captain Wilkes had taken no despatches was true;\r\nbut the Captain suggested a way out of this difficulty by declaring\r\nthat he had regarded the two men themselves as an incarnated\r\nembodiment of despatches. At any rate, they were clearly contraband\r\nof war. They were going to do an injury to the North. It was pretty\r\nto hear the charming women of Boston, as they became learned in the\r\nlaw of nations: \"Wheaton is quite clear about it,\" one young girl\r\nsaid to me. It was the first I had ever heard of Wheaton, and so\r\nfar was obliged to knock under. All the world, ladies and lawyers,\r\nexpressed the utmost confidence in the justice of the seizure, but\r\nit was clear that all the world was in a state of the profoundest\r\nnervous anxiety on the subject. To me it seemed to be the most\r\nsuicidal act that any party in a life-and-death struggle ever\r\ncommitted. All Americans on both sides had felt, from the beginning\r\nof the war, that any assistance given by England to one or the other\r\nwould turn the scale. The Government of Mr. Lincoln must have learned\r\nby this time that England was at least true in her neutrality; that\r\nno desire for cotton would compel her to give aid to the South as\r\nlong as she herself was not ill-treated by the North. But it seemed\r\nas though Mr. Seward, the President's prime minister, had no better\r\nwork on hand than that of showing in every way his indifference as to\r\ncourtesy with England. Insults offered to England would, he seemed to\r\nthink, strengthen his hands. He would let England know that he did\r\nnot care for her. When our minister, Lord Lyons, appealed to him\r\nregarding the suspension of the habeas corpus, Mr. Seward not only\r\nanswered him with insolence, but instantly published his answer\r\nin the papers. He instituted a system of passports, especially\r\nconstructed so as to incommode Englishmen proceeding from the States\r\nacross the Atlantic. He resolved to make every Englishman in America\r\nfeel himself in some way punished because England had not assisted\r\nthe North. And now came the arrest of Slidell and Mason out of\r\nan English mail-steamer; and Mr. Seward took care to let it be\r\nunderstood that, happen what might, those two men should not be given\r\nup.\r\n\r\nNothing during all this time astonished me so much as the estimation\r\nin which Mr. Seward was then held by his own party. It is, perhaps,\r\nthe worst defect in the Constitution of the States, that no\r\nincapacity on the part of a minister, no amount of condemnation\r\nexpressed against him by the people or by Congress, can put him out\r\nof office during the term of the existing Presidency. The President\r\ncan dismiss him; but it generally happens that the President is\r\nbrought in on a \"platform,\" which has already nominated for him his\r\nCabinet as thoroughly as they have nominated him. Mr. Seward ran Mr.\r\nLincoln very hard for the position of candidate for the Presidency\r\non the Republican interest. On the second voting of the Republican\r\ndelegates at the Convention at Chicago, Mr. Seward polled 184 to Mr.\r\nLincoln's 181. But as a clear half of the total number of votes was\r\nnecessary--that is 233 out of 465--there was necessarily a third\r\npolling, and Mr. Lincoln won the day. On that occasion Mr. Chase and\r\nMr. Cameron, both of whom became members of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet,\r\nwere also candidates for the White House on the Republican side.\r\nI mention this here to show, that though the President can in fact\r\ndismiss his Ministers, he is in a great manner bound to them, and\r\nthat a Minister in Mr. Seward's position is hardly to be dismissed.\r\nBut from the 1st of November, 1861, till the day on which I left\r\nthe States, I do not think that I heard a good word spoken of Mr.\r\nSeward as a Minister even by one of his own party. The Radical\r\nor Abolitionist Republicans all abused him. The Conservative or\r\nAnti-abolition Republicans, to whose party he would consider himself\r\nas belonging, spoke of him as a mistake. He had been prominent as\r\nSenator from New York, and had been Governor of the State of New\r\nYork, but had none of the aptitudes of a statesman. He was there, and\r\nit was a pity. He was not so bad as Mr. Cameron, the Minister for\r\nWar; that was the best his own party could say for him, even in his\r\nown State of New York. As to the Democrats, their language respecting\r\nhim was as harsh as any that I have heard used towards the Southern\r\nleaders. He seemed to have no friend, no one who trusted him;--and\r\nyet he was the President's chief minister, and seemed to have in\r\nhis own hands the power of mismanaging all foreign relations as he\r\npleased. But, in truth, the States of America, great as they are, and\r\nmuch as they have done, have not produced Statesmen. That theory of\r\ngoverning by the little men rather than by the great, has not been\r\nfound to answer, and such follies as those of Mr. Seward have been\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\r\nAt Boston, and indeed elsewhere, I found that there was even\r\nthen,--at the time of the capture of Mason and Slidell,--no true\r\nconception of the neutrality of England with reference to the two\r\nparties. When any argument was made, showing that England who had\r\ncarried those messengers from the South, would undoubtedly have also\r\ncarried messengers from the North, the answer always was--\"But the\r\nSoutherners are all rebels. Will England regard us who are by treaty\r\nher friend, as she does a people that is in rebellion against its\r\nown government?\" That was the old story over again, and as it was\r\na very long story, it was hardly of use to go back through all its\r\ndetails. But the fact was that unless there had been such absolute\r\nneutrality--such equality between the parties in the eyes of\r\nEngland--even Captain Wilkes would not have thought of stopping\r\nthe \"Trent,\" or the Government at Washington of justifying such\r\na proceeding. And it must be remembered that the Government at\r\nWashington had justified that proceeding. The Secretary of the Navy\r\nhad distinctly done so in his official report; and that report had\r\nbeen submitted to the President and published by his order. It was\r\nbecause England was neutral between the North and South that Captain\r\nWilkes claimed to have the right of seizing those two men. It had\r\nbeen the President's intention, some month or so before this affair,\r\nto send Mr. Everett and other gentlemen over to England with objects\r\nas regards the North, similar to those which had caused the sending\r\nof Slidell and Mason with reference to the South. What would Mr.\r\nEverett have thought had he been refused a passage from Dover to\r\nCalais, because the carrying of him would have been towards the South\r\na breach of neutrality? It would never have occurred to him that he\r\ncould become subject to such stoppage. How should we have been abused\r\nfor Southern sympathies had we so acted! We, forsooth, who carry\r\npassengers about the world, from China and Australia, round to Chili\r\nand Peru, who have the charge of the world's passengers and letters,\r\nand as a nation incur out of our pocket annually a loss of some\r\nhalf-million of pounds sterling for the privilege of doing so, are\r\nto inquire the business of every American traveller before we let\r\nhim on board, and be stopped in our work if we take anybody on one\r\nside whose journeyings may be conceived by the other side to be to\r\nthem prejudicial! Not on such terms will Englishmen be willing to\r\nspread civilization across the ocean! I do not pretend to understand\r\nWheaton and Phillimore, or even to have read a single word of any\r\ninternational law. I have refused to read any such, knowing that it\r\nwould only confuse and mislead me. But I have my common sense to\r\nguide me. Two men living in one street, quarrel and shy brickbats at\r\neach other, and make the whole street very uncomfortable. Not only is\r\nno one to interfere with them, but they are to have the privilege of\r\ndeciding that their brickbats have the right of way, rather than the\r\nordinary intercourse of the neighbourhood! If that be national law,\r\nnational law must be changed. It might do for some centuries back,\r\nbut it cannot do now. Up to this period my sympathies had been\r\nwith the North. I thought, and still think, that the North had no\r\nalternative, that the war had been forced upon them, and that they\r\nhad gone about their work with patriotic energy. But this stopping of\r\nan English mail-steamer was too much for me.\r\n\r\nWhat will they do in England? was now the question. But for any\r\nknowledge as to that, I had to wait till I reached Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE AND LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two places of most general interest in the vicinity of Boston\r\nare Cambridge and Lowell. Cambridge is to Massachusetts, and, I may\r\nalmost say, is to all the northern States, what Cambridge and Oxford\r\nare to England. It is the seat of the University which gives the\r\nhighest education to be attained by the highest classes in that\r\ncountry. Lowell also is in little to Massachusetts and to New England\r\nwhat Manchester is to us in so great a degree. It is the largest and\r\nmost prosperous cotton-manufacturing town in the States.\r\n\r\nCambridge is not above three or four miles from Boston. Indeed, the\r\ntown of Cambridge properly so called begins where Boston ceases. The\r\nHarvard College--that is its name, taken from one of its original\r\nfounders--is reached by horse-cars in twenty minutes from the city.\r\nAn Englishman feels inclined to regard the place as a suburb of\r\nBoston; but if he so expresses himself, he will not find favour in\r\nthe eyes of the men of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe University is not so large as I had expected to find it. It\r\nconsists of Harvard College, as the undergraduates' department, and\r\nof professional schools of law, medicine, divinity, and science.\r\nIn the few words that I will say about it I will confine myself to\r\nHarvard College proper, conceiving that the professional schools\r\nconnected with it have not in themselves any special interest. The\r\naverage number of undergraduates does not exceed 450, and these\r\nare divided into four classes. The average number of degrees taken\r\nannually by bachelors of art is something under 100. Four years'\r\nresidence is required for a degree, and at the end of that period\r\na degree is given as a matter of course if the candidate's conduct\r\nhas been satisfactory. When a young man has pursued his studies for\r\nthat period, going through the required examinations and lectures,\r\nhe is not subjected to any final examination as is the case with a\r\ncandidate for a degree at Oxford and Cambridge. It is, perhaps, in\r\nthis respect that the greatest difference exists between the English\r\nUniversities and Harvard College. With us a young man may, I take\r\nit, still go through his three or four years with a small amount of\r\nstudy. But his doing so does not insure him his degree. If he have\r\nutterly wasted his time he is plucked, and late but heavy punishment\r\ncomes upon him. At Cambridge in Massachusetts the daily work of\r\nthe men is made more obligatory; but if this be gone through with\r\nsuch diligence as to enable the student to hold his own during the\r\nfour years, he has his degree as a matter of course. There are no\r\ndegrees conferring special honour. A man cannot go out \"in honours\"\r\nas he does with us. There are no \"firsts\" or \"double firsts;\" no\r\n\"wranglers;\" no \"senior opts\" or \"junior opts.\" Nor are there prizes\r\nof fellowships and livings to be obtained. It is, I think, evident\r\nfrom this that the greatest incentives to high excellence are wanting\r\nat Harvard College. There is neither the reward of honour nor of\r\nmoney. There is none of that great competition which exists at our\r\nCambridge for the high place of Senior Wrangler; and, consequently,\r\nthe degree of excellence attained is no doubt lower than with us.\r\nBut I conceive that the general level of the University education is\r\nhigher there than with us; that a young man is more sure of getting\r\nhis education, and that a smaller percentage of men leaves Harvard\r\nCollege utterly uneducated than goes in that condition out of Oxford\r\nor Cambridge. The education at Harvard College is more diversified in\r\nits nature, and study is more absolutely the business of the place\r\nthan it is at our Universities.\r\n\r\nThe expense of education at Harvard College is not much lower than\r\nat our colleges; with us there are, no doubt, more men who are\r\nabsolutely extravagant than at Cambridge, Massachusetts. The actual\r\nauthorized expenditure in accordance with the rules is only £50 per\r\nannum, _i.e._ 249 dollars; but this does not, by any means, include\r\neverything. Some of the richer young men may spend as much as £300\r\nper annum, but the largest number vary their expenditure from £100\r\nto £180 per annum; and I take it the same thing may be said of our\r\nUniversities. There are many young men at Harvard College of very\r\nsmall means. They will live on £70 per annum, and will earn a great\r\nportion of that by teaching in the vacations. There are thirty-six\r\nscholarships attached to the University varying in value from £20 to\r\n£60 per annum; and there is also a beneficiary fund for supplying\r\npoor scholars with assistance during their collegiate education. Many\r\nare thus brought up at Cambridge who have no means of their own, and\r\nI think I may say that the consideration in which they are held among\r\ntheir brother students is in no degree affected by their position.\r\nI doubt whether we can say so much of the sizars and bible clerks at\r\nour Universities.\r\n\r\nAt Harvard College there is, of course, none of that old-fashioned,\r\ntime-honoured, delicious, mediæval life which lends so much grace and\r\nbeauty to our colleges. There are no gates, no porter's lodges, no\r\nbutteries, no halls, no battels, and no common rooms. There are no\r\nproctors, no bulldogs, no bursers, no deans, no morning and evening\r\nchapel, no quads, no surplices, no caps and gowns. I have already\r\nsaid that there are no examinations for degrees and no honours; and I\r\ncan easily conceive that in the absence of all these essentials many\r\nan Englishman will ask what right Harvard College has to call itself\r\na University.\r\n\r\nI have said that there are no honours,--and in our sense there are\r\nnone. But I should give offence to my American friends if I did not\r\nexplain that there are prizes given--I think all in money, and that\r\nthey vary from 50 to 10 dollars. These are called _deturs_. The\r\ndegrees are given on Commencement Day, at which occasion certain\r\nof the expectant graduates are selected to take parts in a public\r\nliterary exhibition. To be so selected seems to be tantamount to\r\ntaking a degree in honours. There is also a dinner on Commencement\r\nDay,--at which, however, \"no wine or other intoxicating drink shall\r\nbe served.\"\r\n\r\nIt is required that every student shall attend some place of\r\nChristian worship on Sundays; but he, or his parents for him, may\r\nelect what denomination of church he shall attend. There is a\r\nUniversity chapel on the University grounds which belongs, if I\r\nremember right, to the Episcopalian Church. The young men for the\r\nmost part live in College, having rooms in the College buildings;\r\nbut they do not board in those rooms. There are establishments in\r\nthe town under the patronage of the University, at which dinner,\r\nbreakfast, and supper are provided; and the young men frequent one\r\nof these houses or another as they, or their friends for them, may\r\narrange. Every young man not belonging to a family resident within a\r\nhundred miles of Cambridge, and whose parents are desirous to obtain\r\nthe protection thus provided, is placed, as regards his pecuniary\r\nmanagement, under the care of a patron, and this patron acts by him\r\nas a father does in England by a boy at school. He pays out his money\r\nfor him and keeps him out of debt. The arrangement will not recommend\r\nitself to young men at Oxford quite so powerfully as it may do to\r\nthe fathers of some young men who have been there. The rules with\r\nregard to the lodging and boarding-houses are very stringent. Any\r\nfestive entertainment is to be reported to the President. No wine or\r\nspirituous liquors may be used, &c. It is not a picturesque system,\r\nthis; but it has its advantages.\r\n\r\nThere is a handsome library attached to the College, which the young\r\nmen can use; but it is not as extensive as I had expected. The\r\nUniversity is not well off for funds by which to increase it. The\r\nnew museum in the College is also a handsome building. The edifices\r\nused for the undergraduates' chambers and for the lecture-rooms are\r\nby no means handsome. They are very ugly red-brick houses standing\r\nhere and there without order. There are seven such, and they are\r\ncalled Brattle House, College House, Divinity Hall, Hollis Hall,\r\nHolsworthy Hall, Massachusetts Hall, and Stoughton Hall. It is almost\r\nastonishing that buildings so ugly should have been erected for such\r\na purpose. These, together with the library, the museum, and the\r\nchapel, stand on a large green, which might be made pretty enough if\r\nit were kept well mown like the gardens of our Cambridge colleges;\r\nbut it is much neglected. Here, again, the want of funds--the res\r\nangusta domi--must be pleaded as an excuse. On the same green, but at\r\nsome little distance from any other building, stands the President's\r\npleasant house.\r\n\r\nThe immediate direction of the College is of course mainly in\r\nthe hands of the President, who is supreme. But for the general\r\nmanagement of the Institution there is a Corporation, of which he is\r\none. It is stated in the laws of the University that the Corporation\r\nof the University and its Overseers constitute the Government of the\r\nUniversity. The Corporation consists of the President, five Fellows,\r\nso called, and a Treasurer. These Fellows are chosen, as vacancies\r\noccur, by themselves, subject to the concurrence of the Overseers.\r\nBut these Fellows are in nowise like to the Fellows of our colleges,\r\nhaving no salaries attached to their offices. The Board of Overseers\r\nconsists of the State Governor, other State officers, the President\r\nand Treasurer of Harvard College, and thirty other persons,--men of\r\nnote, chosen by vote. The Faculty of the College, in which is vested\r\nthe immediate care and government of the undergraduates, is composed\r\nof the President and the Professors. The Professors answer to\r\nthe tutors of our colleges, and upon them the education of the\r\nplace depends. I cannot complete this short notice of Harvard\r\nCollege without saying that it is happy in the possession of that\r\ndistinguished natural philosopher, Professor Agassiz. M. Agassiz\r\nhas collected at Cambridge a museum of such things as natural\r\nphilosophers delight to show, which I am told is all but invaluable.\r\nAs my ignorance on all such matters is of a depth which the Professor\r\ncan hardly imagine, and which it would have shocked him to behold, I\r\ndid not visit the museum. Taking the University of Harvard College as\r\na whole, I should say that it is most remarkable in this,--that it\r\ndoes really give to its pupils that education which it professes to\r\ngive. Of our own Universities other good things may be said, but that\r\none special good thing cannot always be said.\r\n\r\nCambridge boasts itself as the residence of four or five men well\r\nknown to fame on the American and also on the European side of the\r\nocean. President Felton's* name is very familiar to us, and wherever\r\nGreek scholarship is held in repute, that is known. So also is the\r\nname of Professor Agassiz, of whom I have spoken. Russell Lowell is\r\none of the Professors of the College,--that Russell Lowell who sang\r\nof Birdo'fredum Sawin, and whose Biglow Papers were edited with such\r\nan ardour of love by our Tom Brown. Birdo'fredum is worthy of all\r\nthe ardour. Mr. Dana is also a Cambridge man,--he who was \"two years\r\nbefore the mast,\" and who since that has written to us of Cuba.\r\nBut Mr. Dana, though residing at Cambridge, is not of Cambridge,\r\nand, though a literary man, he does not belong to literature. He\r\nis,--could he help it?--a special attorney. I must not, however,\r\ndegrade him, for in the States barristers and attorneys are all one.\r\nI cannot but think that he could help it, and that he should not\r\ngive up to law what was meant for mankind. I fear, however, that\r\nsuccessful law has caught him in her intolerant clutches, and that\r\nliterature, who surely would be the nobler mistress, must wear the\r\nwillow. Last and greatest is the poet-laureat of the West; for Mr.\r\nLongfellow also lives at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n  *Since these words were written President Felton has died. I,\r\n   as I returned on my way homewards, had the melancholy privilege\r\n   of being present at his funeral. I feel bound to record here\r\n   the great kindness with which Mr. Felton assisted me in obtaining\r\n   such information as I needed respecting the Institution over\r\n   which he presided.\r\n\r\nI am not at all aware whether the nature of the manufacturing\r\ncorporation of Lowell is generally understood by Englishmen. I\r\nconfess that until I made personal acquaintance with the plan, I\r\nwas absolutely ignorant on the subject. I knew that Lowell was a\r\nmanufacturing town at which cotton is made into calico, and at which\r\ncalico is printed,--as is the case at Manchester; but I conceived\r\nthis was done at Lowell, as it is done at Manchester, by individual\r\nenterprise,--that I or any one else could open a mill at Lowell, and\r\nthat the manufacturers there were ordinary traders, as they are at\r\nother manufacturing towns. But this is by no means the case.\r\n\r\nThat which most surprises an English visitor on going through the\r\nmills at Lowell is the personal appearance of the men and women who\r\nwork at them. As there are twice as many women as there are men, it\r\nis to them that the attention is chiefly called. They are not only\r\nbetter dressed, cleaner, and better mounted in every respect than\r\nthe girls employed at manufactories in England, but they are so\r\ninfinitely superior as to make a stranger immediately perceive that\r\nsome very strong cause must have created the difference. We all\r\nknow the class of young women whom we generally see serving behind\r\ncounters in the shops of our larger cities. They are neat, well\r\ndressed, careful, especially about their hair, composed in their\r\nmanner, and sometimes a little supercilious in the propriety of their\r\ndemeanour. It is exactly the same class of young women that one sees\r\nin the factories at Lowell. They are not sallow, nor dirty, nor\r\nragged, nor rough. They have about them no signs of want, or of low\r\nculture. Many of us also know the appearance of those girls who work\r\nin the factories in England; and I think it will be allowed that a\r\nsecond glance at them is not wanting to show that they are in every\r\nrespect inferior to the young women who attend our shops. The matter,\r\nindeed, requires no argument. Any young woman at a shop would be\r\ninsulted by being asked whether she had worked at a factory. The\r\ndifference with regard to the men at Lowell is quite as strong,\r\nthough not so striking. Working men do not show their status in the\r\nworld by their outward appearance as readily as women; and, as I have\r\nsaid before, the number of the women greatly exceeded that of the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nOne would of course be disposed to say that the superior condition of\r\nthe workers must have been occasioned by superior wages; and this, to\r\na certain extent, has been the cause. But the higher payment is not\r\nthe chief cause. Women's wages, including all that they receive at\r\nthe Lowell factories, average about 14_s._ a week, which is, I take\r\nit, fully a third more than women can earn in Manchester, or did\r\nearn before the loss of the American cotton began to tell upon them.\r\nBut if wages at Manchester were raised to the Lowell standard, the\r\nManchester women would not be clothed, fed, cared for, and educated\r\nlike the Lowell women. The fact is, that the workmen and the\r\nworkwomen at Lowell are not exposed to the chances of an open\r\nlabour market. They are taken in, as it were, to a philanthropical\r\nmanufacturing college, and then looked after and regulated more as\r\ngirls and lads at a great seminary, than as hands by whose industry\r\nprofit is to be made out of capital. This is all very nice and pretty\r\nat Lowell, but I am afraid it could not be done at Manchester.\r\n\r\nThere are at present twelve different manufactories at Lowell, each\r\nof which has what is called a separate corporation. The Merrimack\r\nmanufacturing company was incorporated in 1822, and thus Lowell was\r\ncommenced. The Lowell machine-shop was incorporated in 1845, and\r\nsince that no new establishment has been added. In 1821 a certain\r\nBoston manufacturing company, which had mills at Waltham, near\r\nBoston, was attracted by the water-power of the river Merrimack,\r\non which the present town of Lowell is situated. A canal, called\r\nthe Pawtucket Canal, had been made for purposes of navigation from\r\none reach of the river to another, with the object of avoiding the\r\nPawtucket Falls; and this canal, with the adjacent water-power of\r\nthe river, was purchased for the Boston Company. The place was then\r\ncalled Lowell, after one of the partners in that company.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that water-power alone is used for preparing\r\nthe cotton and working the spindles and looms of the cotton mills.\r\nSteam is applied in the two establishments in which the cottons are\r\nprinted, for the purposes of printing, but I think nowhere else.\r\nWhen the mills are at full work, about two-and-a-half million yards\r\nof cotton goods are made every week, and nearly a million pounds\r\nof cotton are consumed per week (_i.e._ 842,000 lbs.), but the\r\nconsumption of coal is only 30,000 tons in the year. This will give\r\nsome idea of the value of the water-power. The Pawtucket Canal was,\r\nas I say, bought, and Lowell was commenced. The town was incorporated\r\nin 1826, and the railway between it and Boston was opened in 1835,\r\nunder the superintendence of Mr. Jackson, the gentleman by whom the\r\npurchase of the canal had in the first instance been made. Lowell now\r\ncontains about 40,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is taken from the hand-book to Lowell:--\"Mr.\r\nF. C. Lowell had in his travels abroad observed the effect of large\r\nmanufacturing establishments on the character of the people, and in\r\nthe establishment at Waltham the founders looked for a remedy for\r\nthese defects. They thought that education and good morals would even\r\nenhance the profit, and that they could compete with Great Britain by\r\nintroducing a more cultivated class of operatives. For this purpose\r\nthey built boarding-houses, which, under the direct supervision of\r\nthe agent, were kept by discreet matrons\"--I can answer for the\r\ndiscreet matrons at Lowell--\"mostly widows, no boarders being allowed\r\nexcept operatives. Agents and overseers of high moral character were\r\nselected; regulations were adopted at the mills and boarding-houses,\r\nby which only respectable girls were employed. The mills were nicely\r\npainted and swept,\"--I can also answer for the painting and sweeping\r\nat Lowell,--\"trees set out in the yards and along the streets, habits\r\nof neatness and cleanliness encouraged; and the result justified\r\nthe expenditure. At Lowell the same policy has been adopted and\r\nextended; more spacious mills and elegant boarding-houses have been\r\nerected;\"--as to the elegance, it may be a matter of taste, but\r\nas to the comfort there is no question,--\"the same care as to the\r\nclasses employed; more capital has been expended for cleanliness and\r\ndecoration; a hospital has been established for the sick, where,\r\nfor a small price, they have an experienced physician and skilful\r\nnurses. An institute, with an extensive library, for the use of\r\nthe mechanics, has been endowed. The agents have stood forward in\r\nthe support of schools, churches, lectures, and lyceums, and their\r\ninfluence contributed highly to the elevation of the moral and\r\nintellectual character of the operatives. Talent has been encouraged,\r\nbrought forward, and recommended.\"--For some considerable time\r\nthe young women wrote, edited, and published a newspaper among\r\nthemselves, called the Lowell Offering.--\"And Lowell has supplied\r\nagents and mechanics for the later manufacturing places who have\r\ngiven tone to society, and extended the beneficial influence of\r\nLowell through the United States. Girls from the country, with a\r\ntrue Yankee spirit of independence, and confident in their own\r\npowers, pass a few years here, and then return to get married with\r\na dower secured by their exertions, with more enlarged ideas and\r\nextended means of information, and their places are supplied by\r\nyounger relatives. A larger proportion of the female population\r\nof New England has been employed at some time in manufacturing\r\nestablishments, and they are not on this account less good wives,\r\nmothers, or educators of families.\" Then the account goes on to tell\r\nhow the health of the girls has been improved by their attendance at\r\nthe mills, how they put money into the savings-banks, and buy railway\r\nshares and farms; how there are thirty churches in Lowell, a library,\r\nbanks, and insurance offices; how there is a cemetery, and a park,\r\nand how everything is beautiful, philanthropic, profitable, and\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nThus Lowell is the realization of a commercial Utopia. Of all the\r\nstatements made in the little book which I have quoted I cannot point\r\nout one which is exaggerated, much less false. I should not call the\r\nplace elegant; in other respects I am disposed to stand by the book.\r\nBefore I had made any inquiry into the cause of the apparent comfort,\r\nit struck me at once that some great effort at excellence was being\r\nmade. I went into one of the discreet matrons' residences; and\r\nperhaps may give but an indifferent idea of her discretion when I say\r\nthat she allowed me to go into the bedrooms. If you want to ascertain\r\nthe inner ways or habits of life of any man, woman, or child, see,\r\nif it be practicable to do so, his or her bedroom. You will learn\r\nmore by a minute's glance round that holy of holies, than by any\r\nconversation. Looking-glasses and such like, suspended dresses,\r\nand toilet-belongings, if taken without notice, cannot lie or even\r\nexaggerate. The discreet matron at first showed me rooms only\r\nprepared for use, for at the period of my visit Lowell was by no\r\nmeans full; but she soon became more intimate with me, and I went\r\nthrough the upper part of the house. My report must be altogether\r\nin her favour and in that of Lowell. Everything was cleanly,\r\nwell-ordered, and feminine. There was not a bed on which any woman\r\nneed have hesitated to lay herself if occasion required it. I fear\r\nthat this cannot be said of the lodgings of the manufacturing classes\r\nat Manchester. The boarders all take their meals together. As a rule,\r\nthey have meat twice a-day. Hot meat for dinner is with them as\r\nmuch a matter of course, or probably more so, than with any English\r\nman or woman who may read this book. For in the States of America\r\nregulations on this matter are much more rigid than with us. Cold\r\nmeat is rarely seen, and to live a day without meat would be as great\r\na privation as to pass a night without bed.\r\n\r\nThe rules for the guidance of these boarding-houses are very rigid.\r\nThe houses themselves belong to the corporations or different\r\nmanufacturing establishments, and the tenants are altogether in the\r\npower of the managers. None but operatives are to be taken in. The\r\ntenants are answerable for improper conduct. The doors are to be\r\nclosed at ten o'clock. Any boarders who do not attend divine worship\r\nare to be reported to the managers. The yards and walks are to\r\nbe kept clean, and snow removed at once; and the inmates must be\r\nvaccinated, &c., &c., &c. It is expressly stated by the Hamilton\r\nCompany,--and I believe by all the companies,--that no one shall\r\nbe employed who is habitually absent from public worship on Sunday,\r\nor who is known to be guilty of immorality. It is stated that the\r\naverage wages of the women are two dollars, or eight shillings, a\r\nweek, besides their board. I found when I was there that from three\r\ndollars to three-and-a-half a week were paid to the women, of which\r\nthey paid one dollar and twenty-five cents for their board. As this\r\nwould not fully cover the expense of their keep, twenty-five cents a\r\nweek for each was also paid to the boarding-house keepers by the mill\r\nagents. This substantially came to the same thing, as it left the two\r\ndollars a week, or eight shillings, with the girls over and above\r\ntheir cost of living. The board included washing, lights, food, bed,\r\nand attendance,--leaving a surplus of eight shillings a week for\r\nclothes and saving. Now let me ask any one acquainted with Manchester\r\nand its operatives, whether that is not Utopia realized. Factory\r\ngirls, for whom every comfort of life is secured, with £21 a year\r\nover for saving and dress! One sees the failing, however, at a\r\nmoment. It is Utopia. Any Lady Bountiful can tutor three or four\r\npeasants and make them luxuriously comfortable. But no Lady Bountiful\r\ncan give luxurious comfort to half-a-dozen parishes. Lowell is now\r\nnearly forty years old, and contains but 40,000 inhabitants. From\r\nthe very nature of its corporations it cannot spread itself. Chicago,\r\nwhich has grown out of nothing in a much shorter period, and which\r\nhas no factories, has now 120,000 inhabitants. Lowell is a very\r\nwonderful place and shows what philanthropy can do; but I fear it\r\nalso shows what philanthropy cannot do.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other establishments, conducted on the same\r\nprinciple as those at Lowell, which have had the same amount,\r\nor rather the same sort, of success. Lawrence is now a town of\r\nabout 15,000 inhabitants, and Manchester of about 24,000,--if I\r\nremember rightly;--and at those places the mills are also owned by\r\ncorporations and conducted as are those at Lowell. But it seems\r\nto me that as New England takes her place in the world as a great\r\nmanufacturing country--which place she undoubtedly will take sooner\r\nor later--she must abandon the hot-house method of providing for her\r\noperatives with which she has commenced her work. In the first place,\r\nLowell is not open as a manufacturing town to the capitalists even\r\nof New England at large. Stock may, I presume, be bought in the\r\ncorporations, but no interloper can establish a mill there. It is a\r\nclose manufacturing community, bolstered up on all sides, and has\r\nnone of that capacity for providing employment for a thickly-growing\r\npopulation which belongs to such places as Manchester and Leeds.\r\nThat it should under its present system have been made in any degree\r\nprofitable reflects great credit on the managers; but the profit\r\ndoes not reach an amount which in America can be considered as\r\nremunerative. The total capital invested by the twelve corporations\r\nis thirteen million and a half of dollars, or about two million seven\r\nhundred thousand pounds. In only one of the corporations, that of\r\nthe Merrimack Company, does the profit amount to 12 per cent. In one,\r\nthat of the Boott Company, it falls below 7 per cent. The average\r\nprofit of the various establishments is something below 9 per cent.\r\nI am of course speaking of Lowell as it was previous to the war.\r\nAmerican capitalists are not, as a rule, contented with so low a rate\r\nof interest as this.\r\n\r\nThe States in these matters have had a great advantage over England.\r\nThey have been able to begin at the beginning. Manufactories have\r\ngrown up among us as our cities grew;--from the necessities and\r\nchances of the times. When labour was wanted it was obtained in the\r\nordinary way; and so when houses were built they were built in the\r\nordinary way. We had not the experience, and the results either for\r\ngood or bad, of other nations to guide us. The Americans, in seeing\r\nand resolving to adopt our commercial successes, have resolved also,\r\nif possible, to avoid the evils which have attended those successes.\r\nIt would be very desirable that all our factory girls should read and\r\nwrite, wear clean clothes, have decent beds, and eat hot meat every\r\nday. But that is now impossible. Gradually, with very up-hill work,\r\nbut still I trust with sure work, much will be done to improve their\r\nposition and render their life respectable; but in England we can\r\nhave no Lowells. In our thickly populated island any commercial\r\nUtopia is out of the question. Nor can, as I think, Lowell be taken\r\nas a type of the future manufacturing towns of New England. When New\r\nEngland employs millions in her factories, instead of thousands,--the\r\nhands employed at Lowell, when the mills are at full work, are about\r\n11,000,--she must cease to provide for them their beds and meals,\r\ntheir church-going proprieties and orderly modes of life. In such\r\nan attempt she has all the experience of the world against her. But\r\nnevertheless I think she will have done much good. The tone which she\r\nwill have given will not altogether lose its influence. Employment\r\nin a factory is now considered reputable by a farmer and his\r\nchildren, and this idea will remain. Factory work is regarded as more\r\nrespectable than domestic service, and this prestige will not wear\r\nitself altogether out. Those now employed have a strong conception of\r\nthe dignity of their own social position, and their successors will\r\ninherit much of this, even though they may find themselves excluded\r\nfrom the advantages of the present Utopia. The thing has begun\r\nwell, but it can only be regarded as a beginning. Steam, it may be\r\npresumed, will become the motive power of cotton mills in New England\r\nas it is with us; and when it is so, the amount of work to be done\r\nat any one place will not be checked by any such limit as that which\r\nnow prevails at Lowell. Water-power is very cheap, but it cannot\r\nbe extended; and it would seem that no place can become large as a\r\nmanufacturing town which has to depend chiefly upon water. It is not\r\nimprobable that steam may be brought into general use at Lowell, and\r\nthat Lowell may spread itself. If it should spread itself widely, it\r\nwill lose its Utopian characteristics.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but be greatly struck by the spirit of philanthropy\r\nin which the system of Lowell was at first instituted. It may be\r\npresumed that men who put their money into such an undertaking did so\r\nwith the object of commercial profit to themselves; but in this case\r\nthat was not their first object. I think it may be taken for granted\r\nthat when Messrs. Jackson and Lowell went about their task, their\r\ngrand idea was to place factory work upon a respectable footing,--to\r\ngive employment in mills which should not be unhealthy, degrading,\r\ndemoralizing, or hard in its circumstances. Throughout the northern\r\nStates of America the same feeling is to be seen. Good and thoughtful\r\nmen have been active to spread education, to maintain health, to make\r\nwork compatible with comfort and personal dignity, and to divest the\r\nordinary lot of man of the sting of that curse which was supposed to\r\nbe uttered when our first father was ordered to eat his bread in the\r\nsweat of his brow. One is driven to contrast this feeling, of which\r\non all sides one sees such ample testimony, with that sharp desire\r\nfor profit, that anxiety to do a stroke of trade at every turn, that\r\nacknowledged necessity of being smart, which we must own is quite\r\nas general as the nobler propensity. I believe that both phases of\r\ncommercial activity may be attributed to the same characteristic. Men\r\nin trade in America are not more covetous than tradesmen in England,\r\nnor probably are they more generous or philanthropical. But that\r\nwhich they do, they are more anxious to do thoroughly and quickly.\r\nThey desire that every turn taken shall be a great turn,--or at any\r\nrate that it shall be as great as possible. They go ahead either for\r\nbad or good with all the energy they have. In the institutions at\r\nLowell I think we may allow that the good has very much prevailed.\r\n\r\nI went over two of the mills, those of the Merrimack corporation, and\r\nof the Massachusetts. At the former the printing establishment only\r\nwas at work; the cotton mills were closed. I hardly know whether it\r\nwill interest any one to learn that something under half-a-million\r\nyards of calico are here printed annually. At the Lowell bleachery\r\nfifteen million yards are dyed annually. The Merrimack cotton-mills\r\nwere stopped, and so had the other mills at Lowell been stopped, till\r\nsome short time before my visit. Trade had been bad, and there had of\r\ncourse been a lack of cotton. I was assured that no severe suffering\r\nhad been created by this stoppage. The greater number of hands had\r\nreturned into the country,--to the farms from whence they had come;\r\nand though a discontinuance of work and wages had of course produced\r\nhardship, there had been no actual privation,--no hunger and want.\r\nThose of the workpeople who had no homes out of Lowell to which to\r\nbetake themselves, and no means at Lowell of living, had received\r\nrelief before real suffering had begun. I was assured, with something\r\nof a smile of contempt at the question, that there had been nothing\r\nlike hunger. But, as I said before, visitors always see a great deal\r\nof rose colour, and should endeavour to allay the brilliancy of the\r\ntint with the proper amount of human shading. But do not let any\r\nvisitor mix in the browns with too heavy a hand!\r\n\r\nAt the Massachusetts cotton-mills they were working with about\r\ntwo-thirds of their full number of hands, and this, I was told, was\r\nabout the average of the number now employed throughout Lowell.\r\nWorking at this rate they had now on hand a supply of cotton to last\r\nthem for six months. Their stocks had been increased lately, and on\r\nasking from whence, I was informed that that last received had come\r\nto them from Liverpool. There is, I believe, no doubt but that a\r\nconsiderable quantity of cotton has been shipped back from England to\r\nthe States since the civil war began. I asked the gentleman, to whose\r\ncare at Lowell I was consigned, whether he expected to get cotton\r\nfrom the South,--for at that time Beaufort in South Carolina had just\r\nbeen taken by the naval expedition. He had, he said, a political\r\nexpectation of a supply of cotton, but not a commercial expectation.\r\nThat at least was the gist of his reply, and I found it to be both\r\nintelligent and intelligible. The Massachusetts mills, when at full\r\nwork, employ 1300 females and 400 males, and turn out 540,000 yards\r\nof calico per week.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Lowell in the smoking car, an old man came and\r\nsqueezed in next to me. The place was terribly crowded, and as the\r\nold man was thin and clean and quiet I willingly made room for him,\r\nso as to avoid the contiguity of a neighbour who might be neither\r\nthin, nor clean, nor quiet. He began talking to me in whispers\r\nabout the war, and I was suspicious that he was a Southerner and\r\na Secessionist. Under such circumstances his company might not be\r\nagreeable, unless he could be induced to hold his tongue. At last he\r\nsaid, \"I come from Canada, you know, and you,--you're an Englishman,\r\nand therefore I can speak to you openly;\" and he gave me an\r\naffectionate grip on the knee with his old skinny hand. I suppose I\r\ndo look more like an Englishman than an American, but I was surprised\r\nat his knowing me with such certainty. \"There is no mistaking you,\"\r\nhe said, \"with your round face and your red cheeks. They don't look\r\nlike that here,\" and he gave me another grip. I felt quite fond of\r\nthe old man, and offered him a cigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all know that the subject which appears above as the title of\r\nthis chapter is a very favourite subject in America. It is, I hope,\r\na very favourite subject in England also, and I am inclined to\r\nthink has been so for many years past. The rights of women, as\r\ncontradistinguished from the wrongs of women, has perhaps been the\r\nmost precious of the legacies left to us by the feudal ages. How\r\namidst the rough darkness of old Teuton rule women began to receive\r\nthat respect which is now their dearest right, is one of the most\r\ninteresting studies of history. It came, I take it, chiefly from\r\ntheir own conduct. The women of the old classic races seem to have\r\nenjoyed but a small amount of respect or of rights, and to have\r\ndeserved as little. It may have been very well for one Cæsar to have\r\nsaid that his wife should be above suspicion; but his wife was put\r\naway, and therefore either did not have her rights, or else had\r\njustly forfeited them. The daughter of the next Cæsar lived in Rome\r\nthe life of a Messalina, and did not on that account seem to have\r\nlost her \"position in society,\" till she absolutely declined to throw\r\nany veil whatever over her propensities. But as the Roman empire\r\nfell, chivalry began. For a time even chivalry afforded but a dull\r\ntime to the women. During the musical period of the troubadours,\r\nladies, I fancy, had but little to amuse them save the music. But\r\nthat was the beginning, and from that time downwards the rights of\r\nwomen have progressed very favourably. It may be that they have not\r\nyet all that should belong to them. If that be the case, let the men\r\nlose no time in making up the difference. But it seems to me that\r\nthe women who are now making their claims may perhaps hardly know\r\nwhen they are well off. It will be an ill movement if they insist on\r\nthrowing away any of the advantages they have won. As for the women\r\nin America especially, I must confess that I think they have a \"good\r\ntime.\" I make them my compliments on their sagacity, intelligence,\r\nand attractions, but I utterly refuse to them any sympathy for\r\nsupposed wrongs. _O fortunatas sua si bona nôrint!_ Whether or no,\r\nwere I an American married man and father of a family, I should not\r\ngo in for the rights of man--that is altogether another question.\r\n\r\nThis question of the rights of women divides itself into two\r\nheads,--one of which is very important, worthy of much consideration,\r\ncapable perhaps of much philanthropic action, and at any rate\r\naffording matter for grave discussion. This is the question of\r\nwomen's work; how far the work of the world, which is now borne\r\nchiefly by men, should be thrown open to women further than is now\r\ndone. The other seems to me to be worthy of no consideration, to be\r\ncapable of no action, to admit of no grave discussion. This refers to\r\nthe political rights of women; how far the political working of the\r\nworld, which is now entirely in the hands of men, should be divided\r\nbetween them and women. The first question is being debated on our\r\nside of the Atlantic as keenly perhaps as on the American side. As to\r\nthat other question, I do not know that much has ever been said about\r\nit in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"You are doing nothing in England towards the employment of females,\"\r\na lady said to me in one of the States soon after my arrival in\r\nAmerica. \"Pardon me,\" I answered, \"I think we are doing much, perhaps\r\ntoo much. At any rate we are doing something.\" I then explained to\r\nher how Miss Faithfull had instituted a printing establishment in\r\nLondon; how all the work in that concern was done by females, except\r\nsuch heavy tasks as those for which women could not be fitted, and I\r\nhanded to her one of Miss Faithfull's cards. \"Ah,\" said my American\r\nfriend, \"poor creatures! I have no doubt their very flesh will be\r\nworked off their bones.\" I thought this a little unjust on her part;\r\nbut nevertheless it occurred to me as an answer not unfit to be made\r\nby some other lady,--by some woman who had not already advocated the\r\nincreased employment of women. Let Miss Faithfull look to that. Not\r\nthat she will work the flesh off her young women's bones, or allow\r\nsuch terrible consequences to take place in Coram-street; not that\r\nshe or that those connected with her in that enterprise will do aught\r\nbut good to those employed therein. It will not even be said of her\r\nindividually, or of her partners, that they have worked the flesh\r\noff women's bones; but may it not come to this, that when the tasks\r\nnow done by men have been shifted to the shoulders of women, women\r\nthemselves will so complain. May it not go further, and come even to\r\nthis, that women will have cause for such complaint. I do not think\r\nthat such a result will come, because I do not think that the object\r\ndesired by those who are active in the matter will be attained. Men,\r\nas a general rule among civilized nations, have elected to earn their\r\nown bread and the bread of the women also, and from this resolve on\r\ntheir part I do not think that they will be beaten off.\r\n\r\nWe know that Mrs. Dall, an American lady, has taken up this subject,\r\nand has written a book on it, in which great good sense and honesty\r\nof purpose are shown. Mrs. Dall is a strong advocate for the\r\nincreased employment of women, and I, with great deference, disagree\r\nwith her. I allude to her book now because she has pointed out,\r\nI think very strongly, the great reason why women do not engage\r\nthemselves advantageously in trade pursuits. She by no means\r\noverpraises her own sex, and openly declares that young women will\r\nnot consent to place themselves in fair competition with men. They\r\nwill not undergo the labour and servitude of long study at their\r\ntrades. They will not give themselves up to an apprenticeship. They\r\nwill not enter upon their tasks as though they were to be the tasks\r\nof their lives. They may have the same physical and mental aptitudes\r\nfor learning a trade as men, but they have not the same devotion to\r\nthe pursuit, and will not bind themselves to it thoroughly as men\r\ndo. In all which I quite agree with Mrs. Dall; and the English of it\r\nis,--that the young women want to get married.\r\n\r\nGod forbid that they should not so want. Indeed God has forbidden in\r\na very express way that there should be any lack of such a desire\r\non the part of women. There has of late years arisen a feeling\r\namong masses of the best of our English ladies that this feminine\r\npropensity should be checked. We are told that unmarried women may\r\nbe respectable, which we always knew; that they may be useful, which\r\nwe also acknowledge,--thinking still that if married they would be\r\nmore useful; and that they may be happy, which we trust,--feeling\r\nconfident however that they might in another position be more happy.\r\nBut the question is not only as to the respectability, usefulness,\r\nand happiness of womankind, but as to that of men also. If women can\r\ndo without marriage, can men do so? And if not, how are the men to\r\nget wives if the women elect to remain single?\r\n\r\nIt will be thought that I am treating the subject as though it were\r\nsimply jocose, but I beg to assure my reader that such is not my\r\nintention. It certainly is the fact that that disinclination to an\r\napprenticeship and unwillingness to bear the long training for a\r\ntrade, of which Mrs. Dall complains on the part of young women,\r\narise from the fact, that they have other hopes with which such\r\napprenticeships would jar; and it is also certain that if such\r\ndisinclination be overcome on the part of any great number, it must\r\nbe overcome by the destruction or banishment of such hopes. The\r\nquestion is, whether would good or evil result from such a change? It\r\nis often said that whatever difficulty a woman may have in getting a\r\nhusband, no man need encounter difficulty in finding a wife. But in\r\nspite of this seeming fact, I think it must be allowed that if women\r\nare withdrawn from the marriage market, men must be withdrawn from it\r\nalso to the same extent.\r\n\r\nIn any broad view of this matter we are bound to look, not on any\r\nindividual case, and the possible remedies for such cases, but on the\r\nposition in the world occupied by women in general; on the general\r\nhappiness and welfare of the aggregate feminine world, and perhaps\r\nalso a little on the general happiness and welfare of the aggregate\r\nmale world. When ladies and gentlemen advocate the right of women to\r\nemployment, they are taking very different ground from that on which\r\nstand those less extensive philanthropists who exert themselves\r\nfor the benefit of distressed needlewomen, for instance, or for\r\nthe alleviation of the more bitter misery of governesses. The two\r\nquestions are in fact absolutely antagonistic to each other. The\r\nrights-of-women advocate is doing his best to create that position\r\nfor women, from the possible misfortunes of which the friend of the\r\nneedlewomen is struggling to relieve them. The one is endeavouring\r\nto throw work from off the shoulders of men on to the shoulders of\r\nwomen, and the other is striving to lessen the burden which women\r\nare already bearing. Of course it is good to relieve distress in\r\nindividual cases. That Song of the Shirt, which I regard as poetry of\r\nthe immortal kind, has done an amount of good infinitely wider than\r\npoor Hood ever ventured to hope. Of all such efforts I would speak\r\nnot only with respect, but with loving admiration. But of those whose\r\nefforts are made to spread work more widely among women, to call upon\r\nthem to make for us our watches, to print our books, to sit at our\r\ndesks as clerks, and to add up our accounts; much as I may respect\r\nthe individual operators in such a movement, I can express no\r\nadmiration for their judgment.\r\n\r\nI have seen women with ropes round their necks drawing a harrow over\r\nploughed ground. No one will, I suppose, say that they approve of\r\nthat. But it would not have shocked me to see men drawing a harrow. I\r\nshould have thought it slow, unprofitable work, but my feelings would\r\nnot have been hurt. There must, therefore, be some limit; but if we\r\nmen teach ourselves to believe that work is good for women, where is\r\nthe limit to be drawn, and who shall draw it? It is true that there\r\nis now no actually defined limit. There is much work that is commonly\r\nopen to both sexes. Personal domestic attendance is so, and the\r\nattendance in shops. The use of the needle is shared between men and\r\nwomen, and few, I take it, know where the sempstress ends and where\r\nthe tailor begins. In many trades a woman can be, and very often\r\nis, the owner and manager of the business. Painting is as much open\r\nto women as to men; as also is literature. There can be no defined\r\nlimit; but nevertheless there is at present a quasi limit, which the\r\nrights-of-women advocates wish to move, and so to move that women\r\nshall do more work and not less. A woman now could not well be a\r\ncab-driver in London; but are these advocates sure that no woman will\r\nbe a cab-driver when success has attended their efforts? And would\r\nthey like to see a woman driving a cab? For my part I confess I do\r\nnot like to see a woman acting as road-keeper on a French railway.\r\nI have seen a woman acting as ostler at a public stage in Ireland.\r\nI knew the circumstances,--how her husband had become ill and\r\nincapable, and how she had been allowed to earn the wages; but\r\nnevertheless the sight was to me disagreeable, and seemed, as far as\r\nit went, to degrade the sex. Chivalry has been very active in raising\r\nwomen from the hard and hardening tasks of the world, and through\r\nthis action they have become soft, tender, and virtuous. It seems to\r\nme that they of whom I am now speaking are desirous of undoing what\r\nchivalry has done.\r\n\r\nThe argument used is of course plain enough. It is said that women\r\nare left destitute in the world,--destitute unless they can be\r\nself-dependent, and that to women should be given the same open\r\naccess to wages that men possess, in order that they may be as\r\nself-dependent as men. Why should a young woman, for whom no father\r\nis able to provide, not enjoy those means of provision which are\r\nopen to a young man so circumstanced? But I think the answer is very\r\nsimple. The young man under the happiest circumstances which may\r\nbefall him is bound to earn his bread. The young woman is only so\r\nbound when happy circumstances do not befall her. Should we endeavour\r\nto make the recurrence of unhappy circumstances more general or less\r\nso? What does any tradesman, any professional man, any mechanic wish\r\nfor his children? Is it not this, that his sons shall go forth and\r\nearn their bread, and that his daughters shall remain with him till\r\nthey are married? Is not that the mother's wish? Is it not notorious\r\nthat such is the wish of us all as to our daughters? In advocating\r\nthe rights of women it is of other men's girls that we think, never\r\nof our own.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, what shall we do for those women who must earn\r\ntheir bread by their own work? Whatever we do, do not let us wilfully\r\nincrease their number. By opening trades to women, by making them\r\nprinters, watchmakers, accountants, or what not, we shall not simply\r\nrelieve those who must now earn their bread by some such work or else\r\nstarve. It will not be within our power to stop ourselves exactly\r\nat a certain point; to arrange that those women who under existing\r\ncircumstances may now be in want, shall be thus placed beyond want;\r\nbut that no others shall be affected. Men, I fear, will be too\r\nwilling to relieve themselves of some portion of their present\r\nburden, should the world's altered ways enable them to do so. At\r\npresent a lawyer's clerk may earn perhaps his two guineas a week, and\r\nhe with his wife lives on that in fair comfort. But if his wife, as\r\nwell as he, has been brought up as a lawyer's clerk, he will look to\r\nher also for some amount of wages. I doubt whether the two guineas\r\nwould be much increased, but I do not doubt at all that the woman's\r\nposition would be injured.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in discussing this subject, philanthropists fail\r\nto take hold of the right end of the argument. Money returns from\r\nwork are very good, and work itself is good, as bringing such returns\r\nand occupying both body and mind; but the world's work is very hard,\r\nand workmen are too often overdriven. The question seems to me to\r\nbe this,--of all this work have the men got on their own backs too\r\nheavy a share for them to bear, and should they seek relief by\r\nthrowing more of it upon women? It is the rights of man that we are\r\nin fact debating. These watches are weary to make, and this type is\r\ntroublesome to set. We have battles to fight and speeches to make,\r\nand our hands altogether are too full. The women are idle,--many\r\nof them. They shall make the watches for us and set the type; and\r\nwhen they have done that, why should they not make nails as they do\r\nsometimes in Worcestershire, or clean horses, or drive the cabs? They\r\nhave had an easy time of it for these years past, but we'll change\r\nthat. And then it would come to pass that with ropes round their\r\nnecks the women would be drawing harrows across the fields.\r\n\r\nI don't think this will come to pass. The women generally do know\r\nwhen they are well off, and are not particularly anxious to accept\r\nthe philanthropy proffered to them;--as Mrs. Dall says, they do not\r\nwish to bind themselves as apprentices to independent money-making.\r\nThis cry has been louder in America than with us, but even in America\r\nit has not been efficacious for much. There is in the States, no\r\ndoubt, a sort of hankering after increased influence, a desire for\r\nthat prominence of position which men attain by loud voices and\r\nbrazen foreheads, a desire in the female heart to be up and doing\r\nsomething, if the female heart only knew what; but even in the States\r\nit has hardly advanced beyond a few feminine lectures. In many\r\nbranches of work women are less employed than in England. They are\r\nnot so frequent behind counters in the shops, and are rarely seen\r\nas servants in hotels. The fires in such houses are lighted and the\r\nrooms swept by men. But the American girls may say they do not desire\r\nto light fires and sweep rooms. They are ambitious of the higher\r\nclasses of work. But those higher branches of work require study,\r\napprenticeship, a devotion of youth; and that they will not give. It\r\nis very well for a young man to bind himself for four years, and to\r\nthink of marrying four years after that apprenticeship is over. But\r\nsuch a prospectus will not do for a girl. While the sun shines the\r\nhay must be made, and her sun shines earlier in the day than that of\r\nhim who is to be her husband. Let him go through the apprenticeship\r\nand the work, and she will have sufficient on her hands if she looks\r\nwell after his household. Under nature's teaching she is aware of\r\nthis, and will not bind herself to any other apprenticeship, let Mrs.\r\nDall preach as she may.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing, either at New York or Boston, a wooden figure of a\r\nneat young woman, as large as life, standing at a desk with a ledger\r\nbefore her, and looking as though the beau ideal of human bliss were\r\nrealized in her employment. Under the figure there was some notice\r\nrespecting female accountants. Nothing could be nicer than the lady's\r\nfigure, more flowing than the broad lines of her drapery, or more\r\nattractive than her auburn ringlets. There she stood at work, earning\r\nher bread without any impediment to the natural operation of her\r\nfemale charms, and adjusting the accounts of some great firm with as\r\nmuch facility as grace. I wonder whether he who designed that figure\r\nhad ever sat or stood at a desk for six hours,--whether he knew the\r\ndull hum of the brain which comes from long attention to another\r\nman's figures; whether he had ever soiled his own fingers with the\r\neverlasting work of office hours, or worn his sleeves threadbare as\r\nhe leaned, weary in body and mind, upon his desk? Work is a grand\r\nthing,--the grandest thing we have; but work is not picturesque,\r\ngraceful, and in itself alluring. It sucks the sap out of men's\r\nbones, and bends their backs, and sometimes breaks their hearts; but\r\nthough it be so, I for one would not wish to throw any heavier share\r\nof it on to a woman's shoulders. It was pretty to see those young\r\nwomen with spectacles at the Boston library, but when I heard that\r\nthey were there from eight in the morning till nine at night, I\r\npitied them their loss of all the softness of home, and felt that\r\nthey would not willingly be there if necessity were less stern.\r\n\r\nSay that by advocating the rights of women, philanthropists succeed\r\nin apportioning more work to their share, will they eat more, wear\r\nbetter clothes, lie softer, and have altogether more of the fruits of\r\nwork than they do now? That some would do so there can be no doubt,\r\nbut as little that some would have less. If on the whole they would\r\nnot have more, for what good result is the movement made? The first\r\nquestion is, whether at the present time they have less than their\r\nproper share. There are, unquestionably, terrible cases of female\r\nwant, and so there are also of want among men. Alas! do we not\r\nall feel that it must be so, let the philanthropists be ever so\r\nenergetic? And if a woman be left destitute, without the assistance\r\nof father, brother, or husband, it would be hard if no means of\r\nearning subsistence were open to her. But the object now sought is\r\nnot that of relieving such distress. It has a much wider tendency,\r\nor at any rate a wider desire. The idea is that women will ennoble\r\nthemselves by making themselves independent, by working for their own\r\nbread instead of eating bread earned by men. It is in that that these\r\nnew philosophers seem to me to err so greatly. Humanity and chivalry\r\nhave succeeded after a long struggle in teaching the man to work\r\nfor the woman; and now the woman rebels against such teaching,--not\r\nbecause she likes the work, but because she desires the influence\r\nwhich attends it. But in this I wrong the woman,--even the American\r\nwoman. It is not she who desires it, but her philanthropical\r\nphilosophical friends who desire it for her.\r\n\r\nIf work were more equally divided between the sexes some women would,\r\nof course, receive more of the good things of the world. But women\r\ngenerally would not do so. The tendency then would be to force young\r\nwomen out upon their own exertions. Fathers would soon learn to think\r\nthat their daughters should be no more dependent on them than their\r\nsons; men would expect their wives to work at their own trades;\r\nbrothers would be taught to think it hard that their sisters should\r\nlean on them; and thus women, driven upon their own resources, would\r\nhardly fare better than they do at present.\r\n\r\nAfter all it is a question of money, and a contest for that power and\r\ninfluence which money gives. At present men have the position of the\r\nLower House of Parliament. They have to do the harder work, but they\r\nhold the purse. Even in England there has grown up a feeling that the\r\nold law of the land gives a married man too much power over the joint\r\npecuniary resources of him and his wife, and in America this feeling\r\nis much stronger, and the old law has been modified. Why should a\r\nmarried woman be able to possess nothing? And if such be the law of\r\nthe land, is it worth a woman's while to marry and put herself in\r\nsuch a position? Those are the questions asked by the friends of the\r\nrights of women. But the young women do marry, and the men pour their\r\nearnings into their wives' laps.\r\n\r\nIf little has as yet been done in extending the rights of women by\r\ngiving them a greater share of the work of the world, still less has\r\nbeen done towards giving them their portion of political influence.\r\nIn the States there are many men of mark, and women of mark also, who\r\nthink that women should have votes for public elections. Mr. Wendell\r\nPhillips, the Boston lecturer who advocates abolition, is an apostle\r\nin this cause also; and while I was at Boston I read the provisions\r\nof a will lately left by a millionaire, in which he bequeathed some\r\nvery large sums of money to be expended in agitation on this subject.\r\nA woman is subject to the law; why then should she not help to make\r\nthe law? A child is subject to the law, and does not help to make it;\r\nbut the child lacks that discretion which the woman enjoys equally\r\nwith the man. That I take it is the amount of the argument in favour\r\nof the political rights of women. The logic of this is so conclusive,\r\nthat I am prepared to acknowledge that it admits of no answer. I will\r\nonly say that the mutual good relations between men and women, which\r\nare so indispensable to our happiness, require that men and women\r\nshould not take to voting at the same time and on the same result. If\r\nit be decided that women shall have political power, let them have\r\nit all to themselves for a season. If that be so resolved, I think\r\nwe may safely leave it to them to name the time at which they will\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nI confess that in the States I have sometimes been driven to\r\nthink that chivalry has been carried too far;--that there is an\r\nattempt to make women think more of the rights of their womanhood\r\nthan is needful. There are ladies' doors at hotels, and ladies'\r\ndrawing-rooms, ladies' sides on the ferry-boats, ladies' windows at\r\nthe post office for the delivery of letters;--which, by-the-by, is\r\nan atrocious institution, as anybody may learn who will look at the\r\nadvertisements called personal in some of the New York papers. Why\r\nshould not young ladies have their letters sent to their houses,\r\ninstead of getting them at a private window? The post-office clerks\r\ncan tell stories about those ladies' windows. But at every turn it\r\nis necessary to make separate provision for ladies. From all this\r\nit comes to pass that the baker's daughter looks down from a great\r\nheight on her papa, and by no means thinks her brother good enough\r\nfor her associate. Nature, the great restorer, comes in and teaches\r\nher to fall in love with the butcher's son. Thus the evil is\r\nmitigated; but I cannot but wish that the young woman should not see\r\nherself denominated a lady so often, and should receive fewer lessons\r\nas to the extent of her privileges. I would save her if I could from\r\nworking at the oven; I would give to her bread and meat earned by\r\nher father's care and her brother's sweat; but when she has received\r\nthese good things, I would have her proud of the one and by no means\r\nashamed of the other.\r\n\r\nLet women say what they will of their rights, or men who think\r\nthemselves generous say what they will for them, the question has all\r\nbeen settled both for them and for us men by a higher power. They are\r\nthe nursing mothers of mankind, and in that law their fate is written\r\nwith all its joys and all its privileges. It is for men to make those\r\njoys as lasting and those privileges as perfect as may be. That women\r\nshould have their rights no man will deny. To my thinking neither\r\nincrease of work nor increase of political influence are among them.\r\nThe best right a woman has is the right to a husband, and that is\r\nthe right to which I would recommend every young woman here and in\r\nthe States to turn her best attention. On the whole, I think that\r\nmy doctrine will be more acceptable than that of Mrs. Dall or Mr.\r\nWendell Phillips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one matter in which, as far as my judgment goes, the people of\r\nthe United States have excelled us Englishmen, so as to justify them\r\nin taking to themselves praise which we cannot take to ourselves or\r\nrefuse to them, is the matter of Education. In saying this I do not\r\nthink that I am proclaiming anything disgraceful to England, though\r\nI am proclaiming much that is creditable to America. To the Americans\r\nof the States was given the good fortune of beginning at the\r\nbeginning. The French at the time of their revolution endeavoured to\r\nreorganize everything, and to begin the world again with new habits\r\nand grand theories; but the French as a people were too old for such\r\na change, and the theories fell to the ground. But in the States,\r\nafter their revolution, an Anglo-Saxon people had an opportunity of\r\nmaking a new State, with all the experience of the world before\r\nthem; and to this matter of education they were from the first aware\r\nthat they must look for their success. They did so; and unrivalled\r\npopulation, wealth, and intelligence have been the results; and with\r\nthese, looking at the whole masses of the people,--I think I am\r\njustified in saying,--unrivalled comfort and happiness. It is not\r\nthat you, my reader, to whom in this matter of education fortune and\r\nyour parents have probably been bountiful, would have been more happy\r\nin New York than in London. It is not that I, who, at any rate, can\r\nread and write, have cause to wish that I had been an American. But\r\nit is this:--if you and I can count up in a day all those on whom our\r\neyes may rest, and learn the circumstances of their lives, we shall\r\nbe driven to conclude that nine-tenths of that number would have\r\nhad a better life as Americans than they can have in their spheres\r\nas Englishmen. The States are at a discount with us now, in the\r\nbeginning of this year of grace 1862; and Englishmen were not very\r\nwilling to admit the above statement, even when the States were not\r\nat a discount. But I do not think that a man can travel through the\r\nStates with his eyes open and not admit the fact. Many things will\r\nconspire to induce him to shut his eyes and admit no conclusion\r\nfavourable to the Americans. Men and women will sometimes be impudent\r\nto him;--the better his coat, the greater the impudence. He will be\r\npelted with the braggadocio of equality. The corns of his Old-World\r\nconservatism will be trampled on hourly by the purposely vicious\r\nherd of uncouth democracy. The fact that he is paymaster will go\r\nfor nothing, and will fail to insure civility. I shall never forget\r\nmy agony as I saw and heard my desk fall from a porter's hand on\r\na railway station, as he tossed it from him seven yards off on to\r\nthe hard pavement. I heard its poor weak intestines rattle in their\r\ndeath-struggle, and knowing that it was smashed I forgot my position\r\non American soil and remonstrated. \"It's my desk, and you have\r\nutterly destroyed it,\" I said. \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the porter.\r\n\"You've destroyed my property,\" I rejoined, \"and it's no laughing\r\nmatter.\" And then all the crowd laughed. \"Guess you'd better get it\r\nglued,\" said one. So I gathered up the broken article and retired\r\nmournfully and crestfallen into a coach. This was very sad, and\r\nfor the moment I deplored the ill-luck which had brought me to so\r\nsavage a country. Such and such like are the incidents which make\r\nan Englishman in the States unhappy, and rouse his gall against\r\nthe institutions of the country;--these things and the continued\r\nappliance of the irritating ointment of American braggadocio with\r\nwhich his sores are kept open. But though I was badly off on that\r\nrailway platform,--worse off than I should have been in England,--all\r\nthat crowd of porters round me were better off than our English\r\nporters. They had a \"good time\" of it. And this, O my English brother\r\nwho hast travelled through the States and returned disgusted, is the\r\nfact throughout. Those men whose familiarity was so disgusting to you\r\nare having a good time of it. \"They might be a little more civil,\"\r\nyou say, \"and yet read and write just as well.\" True; but they are\r\narguing in their minds that civility to you will be taken by you for\r\nsubservience, or for an acknowledgment of superiority; and looking at\r\nyour habits of life,--yours and mine together,--I am not quite sure\r\nthat they are altogether wrong. Have you ever realized to yourself\r\nas a fact that the porter who carries your box has not made himself\r\ninferior to you by the very act of carrying that box? If not, that is\r\nthe very lesson which the man wishes to teach you.\r\n\r\nIf a man can forget his own miseries in his journeyings, and think of\r\nthe people he comes to see rather than of himself, I think he will\r\nfind himself driven to admit that education has made life for the\r\nmillion in the Northern States better than life for the million is\r\nwith us. They have begun at the beginning, and have so managed that\r\nevery one may learn to read and write,--have so managed that almost\r\nevery one does learn to read and write. With us this cannot now be\r\ndone. Population had come upon us in masses too thick for management\r\nbefore we had as yet acknowledged that it would be a good thing that\r\nthese masses should be educated. Prejudices, too, had sprung up, and\r\nhabits, and strong sectional feelings, all antagonistic to a great\r\nnational system of education. We are, I suppose, now doing all that\r\nwe can do; but comparatively it is little. I think I saw some time\r\nsince that the cost for gratuitous education, or education in part\r\ngratuitous, which had fallen upon the nation had already amounted to\r\nthe sum of £800,000; and I think also that I read in the document\r\nwhich revealed to me this fact, a very strong opinion that Government\r\ncould not at present go much further. But if this matter were\r\nregarded in England as it is regarded in Massachusetts,--or rather,\r\nhad it from some prosperous beginning been put upon a similar\r\nfooting, £800,000 would not have been esteemed a great expenditure\r\nfor free education simply in the city of London. In 1857 the public\r\nschools of Boston cost £70,000, and these schools were devoted to a\r\npopulation of about 180,000 souls. Taking the population of London at\r\ntwo-and-a-half millions, the whole sum now devoted to England would,\r\nif expended in the metropolis, make education there even cheaper than\r\nit is in Boston. In Boston during 1857 there were above 24,000 pupils\r\nat these public schools, giving more than one-eighth of the whole\r\npopulation. But I fear it would not be practicable for us to spend\r\n£800,000 on the gratuitous education of London. Rich as we are, we\r\nshould not know where to raise the money. In Boston it is raised by\r\na separate tax. It is a thing understood, acknowledged, and made\r\neasy by being habitual,--as is our national debt. I do not know that\r\nBoston is peculiarly blessed, but I quote the instance as I have\r\na record of its schools before me. At the three high schools in\r\nBoston, at which the average of pupils is 526, about £13 per head is\r\npaid for free education. The average price per annum of a child's\r\nschooling throughout these schools in Boston is about £3 per annum.\r\nTo the higher schools any boy or girl may attain without any expense,\r\nand the education is probably as good as can be given, and as far\r\nadvanced. The only question is, whether it is not advanced further\r\nthan may be necessary. Here, as at New York, I was almost startled\r\nby the amount of knowledge around me, and listened, as I might have\r\ndone, to an examination in theology among young Brahmins. When a\r\nyoung lad explained in my hearing all the properties of the different\r\nlevers as exemplified by the bones of the human body, I bowed my\r\nhead before him in unaffected humility. We, at our English schools,\r\nnever got beyond the use of those bones which he described with such\r\naccurate scientific knowledge. In one of the girls' schools they were\r\nreading Milton, and when we entered were discussing the nature of the\r\npool in which the Devil is described as wallowing. The question had\r\nbeen raised by one of the girls. A pool, so called, was supposed to\r\ncontain but a small amount of water, and how could the Devil, being\r\nso large, get into it? Then came the origin of the word pool,--from\r\n\"palus,\" a marsh, as we were told, some dictionary attesting to the\r\nfact,--and such a marsh might cover a large expanse. The \"Palus\r\nMæotis\" was then quoted. And so we went on till Satan's theory of\r\npolitical liberty,\r\n\r\n   \"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,\"\r\n\r\nwas thoroughly discussed and understood. These girls of sixteen and\r\nseventeen got up one after another and gave their opinions on the\r\nsubject,--how far the Devil was right and how far he was manifestly\r\nwrong. I was attended by one of the directors or guardians of the\r\nschools, and the teacher, I thought, was a little embarrassed by her\r\nposition. But the girls themselves were as easy in their demeanour as\r\nthough they were stitching handkerchiefs at home.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to refrain from telling all this, and from making a\r\nlittle innocent fun out of the super-excellencies of these schools;\r\nbut the total result on my mind was very greatly in their favour.\r\nAnd indeed the testimony came in both ways. Not only was I called on\r\nto form an opinion of what the men and women would become from the\r\neducation which was given to the boys and girls, but also to say what\r\nmust have been the education of the boys and girls from what I saw of\r\nthe men and women. Of course it will be understood that I am not here\r\nspeaking of those I met in society, or of their children, but of the\r\nworking people,--of that class who find that a gratuitous education\r\nfor their children is needful, if any considerable amount of\r\neducation is to be given. The result is to be seen daily in the whole\r\nintercourse of life. The coachman who drives you, the man who mends\r\nyour window, the boy who brings home your purchases, the girl who\r\nstitches your wife's dress,--they all carry with them sure signs of\r\neducation, and show it in every word they utter.\r\n\r\nIt will of course be understood that this is, in the separate States,\r\na matter of State law; indeed I may go further and say that it is in\r\nmost of the States a matter of State constitution. It is by no means\r\na matter of Federal constitution. The United States as a nation takes\r\nno heed of the education of its people. All that is left to the\r\njudgment of the separate States. In most of the thirteen original\r\nStates provision is made in the written constitution for the general\r\neducation of the people; but this is not done in all. I find that it\r\nwas more frequently done in the Northern or Freesoil States than in\r\nthose which admitted slavery,--as might have been expected. In the\r\nconstitutions of South Carolina and Virginia I find no allusion\r\nto the public provision for education, but in those of North\r\nCarolina and Georgia it is enjoined. The forty-first section of\r\nthe constitution for North Carolina enjoins that \"schools shall\r\nbe established by the legislature for the convenient instruction\r\nof youth, with such salaries to the masters, paid by the public,\r\nas may enable them to instruct _at low prices_;\" showing that the\r\nintention here was to assist education, and not provide it altogether\r\ngratuitously. I think that provision for public education is enjoined\r\nin the constitutions of all the States admitted into the Union since\r\nthe first federal knot was tied, except in that of Illinois. Vermont\r\nwas the first so admitted, in 1791, and Vermont declares that \"a\r\ncompetent number of schools ought to be maintained in each town\r\nfor the convenient instruction of youth.\" Ohio was the second, in\r\n1802, and Ohio enjoins that \"the general assembly shall make such\r\nprovisions by taxation or otherwise as, with the income arising from\r\nthe school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of\r\ncommon schools throughout the State; but no religious or other sect\r\nor sects shall ever have any exclusive right or control of any part\r\nof the school funds of this State.\" In Indiana, admitted in 1816, it\r\nis required that \"the general assembly shall provide by law for a\r\ngeneral and uniform system of common schools.\" Illinois was admitted\r\nnext, in 1818; but the constitution of Illinois is silent on the\r\nsubject of education. It enjoins, however, in lieu of this, that\r\nno person shall fight a duel or send a challenge! If he do he\r\nis not only to be punished, but to be deprived for ever of the\r\npower of holding any office of honour or profit in the State. I\r\nhave no reason, however, for supposing that education is neglected\r\nin Illinois, or that duelling has been abolished. In Maine it is\r\ndemanded that the towns--the whole country is divided into what are\r\ncalled towns--shall make suitable provision at their own expense for\r\nthe support and maintenance of public schools.\r\n\r\nSome of these constitutional enactments are most magniloquently\r\nworded, but not always with precise grammatical correctness. That\r\nfor the famous Bay State of Massachusetts runs as follows:--\"Wisdom\r\nand knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body\r\nof the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights\r\nand liberties, and as these depend on spreading the opportunities\r\nand advantages of education in the various parts of the country,\r\nand among the different orders of the people, it shall be the duty\r\nof the legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of\r\nthis commonwealth, to cherish the interest of literature and the\r\nsciences, and of all seminaries of them, especially the University\r\nat Cambridge, public schools, and grammar schools in the towns; to\r\nencourage private societies and public institutions, by rewards,\r\nand immunities for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences,\r\ncommerce, trades, manufactures, and a natural history of the country;\r\nto countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general\r\nbenevolence, public and private charity, industry and frugality,\r\nhonesty and punctuality in all their dealings; sincerity, good\r\nhumour, and all social affections and generous sentiments among\r\nthe people.\" I must confess, that had the words of that little\r\nconstitutional enactment been made known to me before I had seen\r\nits practical results, I should not have put much faith in it. Of\r\nall the public schools I have ever seen,--by public schools I mean\r\nschools for the people at large maintained at public cost,--those\r\nof Massachusetts are, I think, the best. But of all the educational\r\nenactments which I ever read, that of the same State is, I should\r\nsay, the worst. In Texas now, of which as a State the people of\r\nMassachusetts do not think much, they have done it better. \"A general\r\ndiffusion of knowledge being essential to the preservation of the\r\nrights and liberties of the people, it shall be the duty of the\r\nlegislature of this State to make suitable provision for the support\r\nand maintenance of public schools.\" So say the Texians; but then the\r\nTexians had the advantage of a later experience than any which fell\r\nin the way of the constitution-makers of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThere is something of the magniloquence of the French style,--of\r\nthe liberty, equality, and fraternity mode of eloquence,--in the\r\npreambles of most of these constitutions, which, but for their\r\nsuccess, would have seemed to have prophesied loudly of failure.\r\nThose of New York and Pennsylvania are the least so, and that of\r\nMassachusetts by far the most violently magniloquent. They generally\r\ncommence by thanking God for the present civil and religious liberty\r\nof the people, and by declaring that all men are born free and equal.\r\nNew York and Pennsylvania, however, refrain from any such very\r\ngeneral remarks.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that all these constitutional enactments are not\r\nlikely to obtain much credit in England. It is not only that grand\r\nphrases fail to convince us, but that they carry to our senses almost\r\nan assurance of their own inefficiency. When we hear that a people\r\nhave declared their intention of being henceforward better than their\r\nneighbours, and going upon a new theory that shall lead them direct\r\nto a terrestrial paradise, we button up our pockets and lock up\r\nour spoons. And that is what we have done very much as regards the\r\nAmericans. We have walked with them and talked with them, and bought\r\nwith them and sold with them; but we have mistrusted them as to their\r\ninternal habits and modes of life, thinking that their philanthropy\r\nwas pretentious and that their theories were vague. Many cities in\r\nthe States are but skeletons of towns, the streets being there, and\r\nthe houses numbered,--but not one house built out of ten that have\r\nbeen so counted up. We have regarded their institutions as we regard\r\nthose cities, and have been specially willing so to consider them\r\nbecause of the fine language in which they have been paraded before\r\nus. They have been regarded as the skeletons of philanthropical\r\nsystems, to which blood and flesh and muscle, and even skin,\r\nare wanting. But it is at least but fair to inquire how far the\r\npromise made has been carried out. The elaborate wordings of the\r\nconstitutions made by the French politicians in the days of their\r\ngreat revolution have always been to us no more than so many written\r\ngrimaces; but we should not have continued so to regard them had the\r\npolitical liberty which they promised followed upon the promises so\r\nmagniloquently made. As regards education in the States,--at any rate\r\nin the northern and western States,--I think that the assurances put\r\nforth in the various written constitutions have been kept. If this\r\nbe so, an American citizen, let him be ever so arrogant, ever so\r\nimpudent if you will, is at any rate a civilized being, and on the\r\nroad to that cultivation which will sooner or later divest him of his\r\narrogance. _Emollit mores._ We quote here our old friend the Colonel\r\nagain. If a gentleman be compelled to confine his classical allusions\r\nto one quotation, he cannot do better than hang by that.\r\n\r\nBut has education been so general, and has it had the desired result?\r\nIn the city of Boston, as I have said, I found that in 1857 about\r\none-eighth of the whole population were then on the books of the free\r\npublic schools as pupils, and that about one-ninth of the population\r\nformed the average daily attendance. To these numbers of course must\r\nbe added all pupils of the richer classes,--those for whose education\r\ntheir parents chose to pay. As nearly as I can learn, the average\r\nduration of each pupil's schooling is six years, and if this be\r\nfigured out statistically, I think it will show that education\r\nin Boston reaches a very large majority--I must almost say the\r\nwhole--of the population. That the education given in other towns of\r\nMassachusetts is not so good as that given in Boston I do not doubt,\r\nbut I have reason to believe that it is quite as general.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of one of the schools of New York. In that city the\r\npublic schools are apportioned to the wards, and are so arranged\r\nthat in each ward of the city there are public schools of different\r\nstanding for the gratuitous use of the children. The population of\r\nthe city of New York in 1857 was about 650,000, and in that year it\r\nis stated that there were 135,000 pupils in the schools. By this it\r\nwould appear that one person in five throughout the city was then\r\nunder process of education,--which statement, however, I cannot\r\nreceive with implicit credence. It is, however, also stated that the\r\ndaily attendances averaged something less than 50,000 a day--and this\r\nlatter statement probably implies some mistake in the former one.\r\nTaking the two together for what they are worth, they show, I think,\r\nthat school teaching is not only brought within the reach of the\r\npopulation generally, but is used by almost all classes. At New\r\nYork there are separate free schools for coloured children. At\r\nPhiladelphia I did not see the schools, but I was assured that the\r\narrangements there were equal to those at New York and Boston. Indeed\r\nI was told that they were infinitely better;--but then I was so told\r\nby a Philadelphian. In the State of Connecticut the public schools\r\nare certainly equal to those in any part of the Union. As far as I\r\ncould learn, education--what we should call advanced education--is\r\nbrought within the reach of all classes in the northern and western\r\nStates of America,--and, I would wish to add here, to those of the\r\nCanadas also.\r\n\r\nSo much for the schools, and now for the results. I do not know that\r\nanything impresses a visitor more strongly with the amount of books\r\nsold in the States, than the practice of selling them as it has been\r\nadopted in the railway cars. Personally the traveller will find the\r\nsystem very disagreeable,--as is everything connected with these\r\ncars. A young man enters during the journey,--for the trade is\r\ncarried out while the cars are travelling, as is also a very brisk\r\ntrade in lollipops, sugar-candy, apples, and ham sandwiches,--the\r\nyoung tradesman enters the car firstly with a pile of magazines or\r\nof novels bound like magazines. These are chiefly the \"Atlantic,\"\r\npublished at Boston, \"Harper's Magazine,\" published at New York, and\r\na cheap series of novels published at Philadelphia. As he walks along\r\nhe flings one at every passenger. An Englishman, when he is first\r\nintroduced to this manner of trade, becomes much astonished. He is\r\nprobably reading, and on a sudden he finds a fat, fluffy magazine,\r\nvery unattractive in its exterior, dropped on to the page he is\r\nperusing. I thought at first that it was a present from some crazed\r\nphilanthropist, who was thus endeavouring to disseminate literature.\r\nBut I was soon undeceived. The bookseller, having gone down the whole\r\ncar and the next, returned, and beginning again where he had begun\r\nbefore, picked up either his magazine or else the price of it. Then,\r\nin some half-hour, he came again, with an armful or basket of books,\r\nand distributed them in the same way. They were generally novels, but\r\nnot always. I do not think that any endeavour is made to assimilate\r\nthe book to the expected customer. The object is to bring the book\r\nand the man together, and in this way a very large sale is effected.\r\nThe same thing is done with illustrated newspapers. The sale of\r\npolitical newspapers goes on so quickly in these cars that no such\r\nenforced distribution is necessary. I should say that the average\r\nconsumption of newspapers by an American must amount to about three a\r\nday. At Washington I begged the keeper of my lodgings to let me have\r\na paper regularly,--one American newspaper being much the same to me\r\nas another,--and my host supplied me daily with four.\r\n\r\nBut the numbers of the popular books of the day, printed and sold,\r\nafford the most conclusive proof of the extent to which education is\r\ncarried in the States. The readers of Tennyson, Thackeray, Dickens,\r\nBulwer, Collins, Hughes, and--Martin Tupper, are to be counted by\r\ntens of thousands in the States, to the thousands by which they\r\nmay be counted in our own islands. I do not doubt that I had fully\r\nfifteen copies of the \"Silver Cord\" thrown at my head in different\r\nrailway cars on the continent of America. Nor is the taste by any\r\nmeans confined to the literature of England. Longfellow, Curtis,\r\nHolmes, Hawthorne, Lowell, Emerson,--and Mrs. Stowe, are almost as\r\npopular as their English rivals. I do not say whether or no the\r\nliterature is well chosen, but there it is. It is printed, sold, and\r\nread. The disposal of ten thousand copies of a work is no large sale\r\nin America of a book published at a dollar; but in England it is a\r\nlarge sale of a book brought out at five shillings.\r\n\r\nI do not remember that I ever examined the rooms of an American\r\nwithout finding books or magazines in them. I do not speak here of\r\nthe houses of my friends, as of course the same remark would apply as\r\nstrongly in England, but of the houses of persons presumed to earn\r\ntheir bread by the labour of their hands. The opportunity for such\r\nexamination does not come daily; but when it has been in my power I\r\nhave made it, and have always found signs of education. Men and women\r\nof the classes to which I allude talk of reading and writing as of\r\narts belonging to them as a matter of course, quite as much as are\r\nthe arts of eating and drinking. A porter or a farmer's servant in\r\nthe States is not proud of reading and writing. It is to him quite a\r\nmatter of course. The coachmen on their boxes and the boots as they\r\nsit in the halls of the hotels, have newspapers constantly in their\r\nhands. The young women have them also, and the children. The fact\r\ncomes home to one at every turn, and at every hour, that the people\r\nare an educated people. The whole of this question between North and\r\nSouth is as well understood by the servants as by their masters, is\r\ndiscussed as vehemently by the private soldiers as by the officers.\r\nThe politics of the country and the nature of its constitution are\r\nfamiliar to every labourer. The very wording of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence is in the memory of every lad of sixteen. Boys and girls\r\nof a younger age than that know why Slidell and Mason were arrested,\r\nand will tell you why they should have been given up, or why they\r\nshould have been held in durance. The question of the war with\r\nEngland is debated by every native paviour and hodman of New York.\r\n\r\nI know what Englishmen will say in answer to this. They will declare\r\nthat they do not want their paviours and hodmen to talk politics;\r\nthat they are as well pleased that their coachmen and cooks should\r\nnot always have a newspaper in their hands; that private soldiers\r\nwill fight as well, and obey better, if they are not trained to\r\ndiscuss the causes which have brought them into the field. An English\r\ngentleman will think that his gardener will be a better gardener\r\nwithout than with any excessive political ardour; and the English\r\nlady will prefer that her housemaid shall not have a very pronounced\r\nopinion of her own as to the capabilities of the cabinet ministers.\r\nBut I would submit to all Englishmen and Englishwomen who may look at\r\nthese pages whether such an opinion or feeling on their part bears\r\nmuch, or even at all, upon the subject. I am not saying that the man\r\nwho is driven in the coach is better off because his coachman reads\r\nthe paper, but that the coachman himself who reads the paper is\r\nbetter off than the coachman who does not and cannot. I think that\r\nwe are too apt, in considering the ways and habits of any people,\r\nto judge of them by the effect of those ways and habits on us,\r\nrather than by their effects on the owners of them. When we go among\r\ngarlic-eaters, we condemn them because they are offensive to us;\r\nbut to judge of them properly we should ascertain whether or no\r\nthe garlic be offensive to them. If we could imagine a nation of\r\nvegetarians hearing for the first time of our habits as flesh-eaters,\r\nwe should feel sure that they would be struck with horror at our\r\nblood-stained banquets; but when they came to argue with us, we\r\nshould bid them inquire whether we flesh-eaters did not live longer\r\nand do more than the vegetarians. When we express a dislike to the\r\nshoeboy reading his newspaper, I fear we do so because we fear that\r\nthe shoeboy is coming near our own heels. I know there is among us a\r\nstrong feeling that the lower classes are better without politics, as\r\nthere is also that they are better without crinoline and artificial\r\nflowers; but if politics and crinoline and artificial flowers are\r\ngood at all, they are good for all who can honestly come by them and\r\nhonestly use them. The political coachman is perhaps less valuable\r\nto his master as a coachman than he would be without his politics,\r\nbut he with his politics is more valuable to himself. For myself, I\r\ndo not like the Americans of the lower orders. I am not comfortable\r\namong them. They tread on my corns and offend me. They make my\r\ndaily life unpleasant. But I do respect them. I acknowledge their\r\nintelligence and personal dignity. I know that they are men and women\r\nworthy to be so called; I see that they are living as human beings in\r\npossession of reasoning faculties; and I perceive that they owe this\r\nto the progress that education has made among them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, what is wanted in this world? Is it not that men should\r\neat and drink, and read and write, and say their prayers? Does not\r\nthat include everything, providing that they eat and drink enough,\r\nread and write without restraint, and say their prayers without\r\nhypocrisy? When we talk of the advances of civilization, do we mean\r\nanything but this, that men who now eat and drink badly shall eat and\r\ndrink well, and that those who cannot read and write now shall learn\r\nto do so,--the prayers following, as prayers will follow upon such\r\nlearning? Civilization does not consist in the eschewing of garlic\r\nor the keeping clean of a man's finger-nails. It may lead to such\r\ndelicacies, and probably will do so. But the man who thinks that\r\ncivilization cannot exist without them imagines that the church\r\ncannot stand without the spire. In the States of America men do eat\r\nand drink, and do read and write.\r\n\r\nBut as to saying their prayers? That, as far as I can see, has come\r\nalso, though perhaps not in a manner altogether satisfactory, or to\r\na degree which should be held to be sufficient. Englishmen of strong\r\nreligious feeling will often be startled in America by the freedom\r\nwith which religious subjects are discussed, and the ease with which\r\nthe matter is treated; but he will very rarely be shocked by that\r\nutter absence of all knowledge on the subject,--that total darkness,\r\nwhich is still so common among the lower orders in our own country.\r\nIt is not a common thing to meet an American who belongs to no\r\ndenomination of Christian worship, and who cannot tell you why he\r\nbelongs to that which he has chosen.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" it will be said, \"all the intelligence and education of this\r\npeople have not saved them from falling out among themselves and\r\ntheir friends, and running into troubles by which they will be\r\nruined. Their political arrangements have been so bad, that in spite\r\nof all their reading and writing they must go to the wall.\" I venture\r\nto express an opinion that they will by no means go to the wall, and\r\nthat they will be saved from such a destiny, if in no other way, then\r\nby their education. Of their political arrangements, as I mean before\r\nlong to rush into that perilous subject, I will say nothing here. But\r\nno political convulsions, should such arise,--no revolution in the\r\nconstitution, should such be necessary,--will have any wide effect\r\non the social position of the people to their serious detriment.\r\nThey have the great qualities of the Anglo-Saxon race,--industry,\r\nintelligence, and self-confidence; and if these qualities will no\r\nlonger suffice to keep such a people on their legs, the world must be\r\ncoming to an end.\r\n\r\nI have said that it is not a common thing to meet an American who\r\nbelongs to no denomination of Christian worship. This I think is\r\nso; but I would not wish to be taken as saying that religion on\r\nthat account stands on a satisfactory footing in the States. Of all\r\nsubjects of discussion, this is the most difficult. It is one as\r\nto which most of us feel that to some extent we must trust to our\r\nprejudices rather than our judgments. It is a matter on which we\r\ndo not dare to rely implicitly on our own reasoning faculties, and\r\ntherefore throw ourselves on the opinions of those whom we believe\r\nto have been better men and deeper thinkers than ourselves. For\r\nmyself, I love the name of State and Church, and believe that much\r\nof our English well-being has depended on it. I have made up my\r\nmind to think that union good, and not to be turned away from that\r\nconviction. Nevertheless I am not prepared to argue the matter. One\r\ndoes not always carry one's proofs at one's finger-ends.\r\n\r\nBut I feel very strongly that much of that which is evil in the\r\nstructure of American politics is owing to the absence of any\r\nnational religion, and that something also of social evil has sprung\r\nfrom the same cause. It is not that men do not say their prayers. For\r\naught I know, they may do so as frequently and as fervently, or more\r\nfrequently and more fervently, than we do; but there is a rowdiness,\r\nif I may be allowed to use such a word, in their manner of doing so\r\nwhich robs religion of that reverence which is, if not its essence,\r\nat any rate its chief protection. It is a part of their system that\r\nreligion shall be perfectly free, and that no man shall be in any\r\nway constrained in that matter. Consequently, the question of a\r\nman's religion is regarded in a free-and-easy way. It is well,\r\nfor instance, that a young lad should go somewhere on a Sunday;\r\nbut a sermon is a sermon, and it does not much concern the lad's\r\nfather whether his son hear the discourse of a freethinker in the\r\nmusic-hall, or the eloquent but lengthy outpouring of a preacher in a\r\nMethodist chapel. Everybody is bound to have a religion, but it does\r\nnot much matter what it is.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in which the first fathers of the Revolution found\r\nthemselves on this question, is shown by the constitutions of the\r\ndifferent States. There can be no doubt that the inhabitants of\r\nthe New England States were, as things went, a strictly religious\r\ncommunity. They had no idea of throwing over the worship of God, as\r\nthe French had attempted to do at their Revolution. They intended\r\nthat the new nation should be pre-eminently composed of a God-fearing\r\npeople; but they intended also that they should be a people free in\r\neverything,--free to choose their own forms of worship. They intended\r\nthat the nation should be a Protestant people; but they intended also\r\nthat no man's conscience should be coerced in the matter of his own\r\nreligion. It was hard to reconcile these two things, and to explain\r\nto the citizens that it behoved them to worship God,--even under\r\npenalties for omission; but that it was at the same time open to them\r\nto select any form of worship that they pleased, however that form\r\nmight differ from the practices of the majority. In Connecticut it is\r\ndeclared that it is the duty of all men to worship the Supreme Being,\r\nthe Creator and Preserver of the universe, but that it is their right\r\nto render that worship in the mode most consistent with the dictates\r\nof their consciences. And then a few lines further down the article\r\nskips the great difficulty in a manner somewhat disingenuous, and\r\ndeclares that each and every society of Christians in the State shall\r\nhave and enjoy the same and equal privileges. But it does not say\r\nwhether a Jew shall be divested of those privileges, or, if he be\r\ndivested, how that treatment of him is to be reconciled with the\r\nassurance that it is every man's right to worship the Supreme Being\r\nin the mode most consistent with the dictates of his own conscience.\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island they were more honest. It is there declared that\r\nevery man shall be free to worship God according to the dictates of\r\nhis own conscience, and to profess and by argument to maintain his\r\nopinion in matters of religion; and that the same shall in nowise\r\ndiminish, enlarge, or affect his civil capacity. Here it is simply\r\npresumed that every man will worship a God, and no allusion is made\r\neven to Christianity.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts they are again hardly honest. \"It is the right,\"\r\nsays the constitution, \"as well as the duty of all men in society\r\npublicly and at stated seasons to worship the Supreme Being, the\r\ngreat Creator and Preserver of the universe.\" And then it goes on to\r\nsay that every man may do so in what form he pleases; but further\r\ndown it declares that \"every denomination of Christians, demeaning\r\nthemselves peaceably and as good subjects of the commonwealth, shall\r\nbe equally under the protection of the law.\" But what about those who\r\nare not Christians? In New Hampshire it is exactly the same. It is\r\nenacted that--\"Every individual has a natural and unalienable right\r\nto worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and\r\nreason.\" And that--\"Every denomination of Christians, demeaning\r\nthemselves quietly and as good citizens of the State, shall be\r\nequally under the protection of the law.\" From all which it is, I\r\nthink, manifest that the men who framed these documents, desirous\r\nabove all things of cutting themselves and their people loose\r\nfrom every kind of trammel, still felt the necessity of enforcing\r\nreligion,--of making it to a certain extent a matter of State duty.\r\nIn the first constitution of North Carolina it is enjoined,--\"That\r\nno person who shall deny the being of God, or the truth of the\r\nProtestant religion, shall be capable of holding any office or place\r\nof trust or profit.\" But this was altered in the year 1836, and\r\nthe words \"Christian religion\" were substituted for \"Protestant\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nIn New England the Congregationalists are, I think, the dominant\r\nsect. In Massachusetts, and I believe in the other New England\r\nStates, a man is presumed to be a Congregationalist if he do not\r\ndeclare himself to be anything else; as with us the Church of England\r\ncounts all who do not specially have themselves counted elsewhere.\r\nThe Congregationalist, as far as I can learn, is very near to a\r\nPresbyterian. In New England I think the Unitarians would rank next\r\nin number; but a Unitarian in America is not the same as a Unitarian\r\nwith us. Here, if I understand the nature of his creed, a Unitarian\r\ndoes not recognize the divinity of our Saviour. In America he does\r\ndo so, but throws over the doctrine of the Trinity. The Protestant\r\nEpiscopalians muster strong in all the great cities, and I fancy that\r\nthey would be regarded as taking the lead of the other religious\r\ndenominations in New York. Their tendency is to high-church\r\ndoctrines. I wish they had not found it necessary to alter the forms\r\nof our prayer-book in so many little matters, as to which there was\r\nno national expediency for such changes. But it was probably thought\r\nnecessary that a new people should show their independence in all\r\nthings. The Roman Catholics have a very strong party--as a matter\r\nof course--seeing how great has been the immigration from Ireland;\r\nbut here, as in Ireland--and as indeed is the case all the world\r\nover--the Roman Catholics are the hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater. The Germans, who have latterly flocked into the States in\r\nsuch swarms that they have almost Germanized certain States, have of\r\ncourse their own churches. In every town there are places of worship\r\nfor Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Anabaptists, and every\r\ndenomination of Christianity; and the meeting-houses prepared for\r\nthese sects are not, as with us, hideous buildings contrived to\r\ninspire disgust by the enormity of their ugliness, nor are they\r\ncalled Salem, Ebenezer, and Sion, nor do the ministers within them\r\nlook in any way like the Deputy-Shepherd. The churches belonging to\r\nthose sects are often handsome. This is especially the case in New\r\nYork; and the pastors are not unfrequently among the best educated\r\nand most agreeable men whom the traveller will meet. They are for the\r\nmost part well paid; and are enabled by their outward position to\r\nhold that place in the world's ranks which should always belong to\r\na clergyman. I have not been able to obtain information from which\r\nI can state with anything like correctness what may be the average\r\nincome of ministers of the Gospel in the northern States, but that\r\nit is much higher than the average income of our parish clergymen,\r\nadmits, I think, of no doubt. The stipends of clergymen in the\r\nAmerican towns are higher than those paid in the country. The\r\nopposite to this, I think as a rule, is the case with us.\r\n\r\nI have said that religion in the States is rowdy. By that I mean to\r\nimply that it seems to me to be divested of that reverential order\r\nand strictness of rule which, according to our ideas, should be\r\nattached to matters of religion. One hardly knows where the affairs\r\nof this world end, or where those of the next begin. When the holy\r\nmen were had in at the lecture, were they doing stage-work or\r\nchurch-work? On hearing sermons, one is often driven to ask oneself\r\nwhether the discourse from the pulpit be in its nature political or\r\nreligious. I heard an Episcopalian Protestant clergyman talk of the\r\nscoffing nations of Europe,--because at that moment he was angry with\r\nEngland and France about Slidell and Mason. I have heard a chapter of\r\nthe Bible read in Congress at the desire of a member, and very badly\r\nread. After which the chapter itself and the reading of it became the\r\nsubject of a debate, partly jocose and partly acrimonious. It is a\r\ncommon thing for a clergyman to change his profession and follow any\r\nother pursuit. I know two or three gentlemen who were once in that\r\nline of life, but have since gone into other trades. There is, I\r\nthink, an unexpressed determination on the part of the people to\r\nabandon all reverence, and to regard religion from an altogether\r\nworldly point of view. They are willing to have religion, as they are\r\nwilling to have laws; but they choose to make it for themselves. They\r\ndo not object to pay for it, but they like to have the handling of\r\nthe article for which they pay. As the descendants of Puritans and\r\nother godly Protestants, they will submit to religious teaching, but\r\nas Republicans they will have no priestcraft. The French at their\r\nRevolution had the latter feeling without the former, and were\r\ntherefore consistent with themselves in abolishing all worship. The\r\nAmericans desire to do the same thing politically, but infidelity\r\nhas had no charms for them. They say their prayers, and then seem to\r\napologize for doing so, as though it were hardly the act of a free\r\nand enlightened citizen, justified in ruling himself as he pleases.\r\nAll this to me is rowdy. I know no other word by which I can so well\r\ndescribe it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the nation is religious in its tendencies, and prone\r\nto acknowledge the goodness of God in all things. A man there is\r\nexpected to belong to some church, and is not, I think, well looked\r\non if he profess that he belongs to none. He may be a Swedenborgian,\r\na Quaker, a Muggletonian;--anything will do. But it is expected of\r\nhim that he shall place himself under some flag, and do his share\r\nin supporting the flag to which he belongs. This duty is, I think,\r\ngenerally fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nFROM BOSTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Boston, on the 27th of November, my wife returned to England,\r\nleaving me to prosecute my journey southward to Washington by myself.\r\nI shall never forget the political feeling which prevailed in Boston\r\nat that time, or the discussions on the subject of Slidell and Mason,\r\nin which I felt myself bound to take a part. Up to that period I\r\nconfess that my sympathies had been strongly with the northern side\r\nin the general question; and so they were still, as far as I could\r\ndivest the matter of its English bearings. I had always thought, and\r\ndo think, that a war for the suppression of the southern rebellion\r\ncould not have been avoided by the North without an absolute loss\r\nof its political prestige. Mr. Lincoln was elected President of the\r\nUnited States in the autumn of 1860, and any steps taken by him or\r\nhis party towards a peaceable solution of the difficulties which\r\nbroke out immediately on his election, must have been taken before he\r\nentered upon his office. South Carolina threatened secession as soon\r\nas Mr. Lincoln's election was known, while yet there were four months\r\nleft of Mr. Buchanan's Government. That Mr. Buchanan might, during\r\nthose four months, have prevented secession, few men, I think, will\r\ndoubt when the history of the time shall be written. But instead of\r\ndoing so he consummated secession. Mr. Buchanan is a northern man,\r\na Pennsylvanian; but he was opposed to the party which had brought\r\nin Mr. Lincoln, having thriven as a politician by his adherence\r\nto southern principles. Now, when the struggle came, he could not\r\nforget his party in his duty as President. General Jackson's position\r\nwas much the same when Mr. Calhoun, on the question of the tariff,\r\nendeavoured to produce secession in South Carolina thirty years ago,\r\nin 1832,--excepting in this, that Jackson was himself a southern man.\r\nBut Jackson had a strong conception of the position which he held\r\nas President of the United States. He put his foot on secession and\r\ncrushed it, forcing Mr. Calhoun, as senator from South Carolina, to\r\nvote for that compromise as to the tariff which the Government of\r\nthe day proposed. South Carolina was as eager in 1832 for secession\r\nas she was in 1859-1860; but the Government was in the hands of a\r\nstrong man and an honest one. Mr. Calhoun would have been hung had\r\nhe carried out his threats. But Mr. Buchanan had neither the power\r\nnor the honesty of General Jackson, and thus secession was in fact\r\nconsummated during his Presidency.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Lincoln's party, it is said--and I believe truly said--might\r\nhave prevented secession by making overtures to the South, or\r\naccepting overtures from the South, before Mr. Lincoln himself had\r\nbeen inaugurated. That is to say,--if Mr. Lincoln and the band of\r\npoliticians who with him had pushed their way to the top of their\r\nparty, and were about to fill the offices of State, chose to throw\r\noverboard the political convictions which had bound them together and\r\ninsured their success,--if they could bring themselves to adopt on\r\nthe subject of slavery the ideas of their opponents,--then the war\r\nmight have been avoided, and secession also avoided. I do believe\r\nthat had Mr. Lincoln at that time submitted himself to a compromise\r\nin favour of the Democrats, promising the support of the Government\r\nto certain acts which would in fact have been in favour of slavery,\r\nSouth Carolina would again have been foiled for the time. For it must\r\nbe understood, that though South Carolina and the Gulf States might\r\nhave accepted certain compromises, they would not have been satisfied\r\nin so accepting them. They desired secession, and nothing short of\r\nsecession would, in truth, have been acceptable to them. But in doing\r\nso Mr. Lincoln would have been the most dishonest politician even in\r\nAmerica. The North would have been in arms against him; and any true\r\nspirit of agreement between the cotton-growing slave States and the\r\nmanufacturing States of the North, or the agricultural States of the\r\nWest, would have been as far off and as improbable as it is now. Mr.\r\nCrittenden, who proffered his compromise to the Senate in December,\r\n1860, was at that time one of the two senators from Kentucky, a slave\r\nState. He now sits in the Lower House of Congress as a member from\r\nthe same State. Kentucky is one of those border States which has\r\nfound it impossible to secede, and almost equally impossible to\r\nremain in the Union. It is one of the States into which it was most\r\nprobable that the war would be carried;--Virginia, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri being the three States which have suffered the most in this\r\nway. Of Mr. Crittenden's own family, some have gone with secession\r\nand some with the Union. His name had been honourably connected with\r\nAmerican politics for nearly forty years, and it is not surprising\r\nthat he should have desired a compromise. His terms were in fact\r\nthese,--a return to the Missouri compromise, under which the Union\r\npledged itself that no slavery should exist north of 36.30 degrees\r\nN. lat. unless where it had so existed prior to the date of that\r\ncompromise; a pledge that Congress would not interfere with slavery\r\nin the individual States,--which under the constitution it cannot do;\r\nand a pledge that the Fugitive Slave Law should be carried out by\r\nthe northern States. Such a compromise might seem to make very small\r\ndemand on the forbearance of the Republican party, which was now\r\ndominant. The repeal of the Missouri compromise had been to them a\r\nloss, and it might be said that its re-enactment would be a gain.\r\nBut since that compromise had been repealed, vast territories\r\nsouth of the line in question had been added to the Union, and the\r\nre-enactment of that compromise would hand those vast regions over\r\nto absolute slavery, as had been done with Texas. This might be all\r\nvery well for Mr. Crittenden in the slave State of Kentucky--for Mr.\r\nCrittenden, although a slave-owner, desired to perpetuate the Union;\r\nbut it would not have been well for New England or for the West. As\r\nfor the second proposition, it is well understood that under the\r\nconstitution Congress cannot interfere in any way in the question of\r\nslavery in the individual States. Congress has no more constitutional\r\npower to abolish slavery in Maryland than she has to introduce it\r\ninto Massachusetts. No such pledge, therefore, was necessary on\r\neither side. But such a pledge given by the North and West would have\r\nacted as an additional tie upon them, binding them to the finality\r\nof a constitutional enactment to which, as was of course well known,\r\nthey strongly object. There was no question of Congress interfering\r\nwith slavery, with the purport of extending its area by special\r\nenactment, and therefore by such a pledge the North and West could\r\ngain nothing; but the South would in prestige have gained much.\r\n\r\nBut that third proposition as to the Fugitive Slave Law and the\r\nfaithful execution of that law by the northern and western States\r\nwould, if acceded to by Mr. Lincoln's party, have amounted to an\r\nunconditional surrender of everything. What! Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut carry out the Fugitive Slave Law! Ohio carry out the\r\nFugitive Slave Law after the \"Dred Scot\" decision and all its\r\nconsequences! Mr. Crittenden might as well have asked Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, and Ohio to introduce slavery within their own lands.\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law was then, as it is now, the law of the land;\r\nit was the law of the United States as voted by Congress and passed\r\nby the President, and acted on by the Supreme Judge of the United\r\nStates' Court. But it was a law to which no free State had submitted\r\nitself, or would submit itself. \"What!\" the English reader will\r\nsay,--\"sundry States in the Union refuse to obey the laws of the\r\nUnion,--refuse to submit to the constitutional action of their own\r\nCongress!\" Yes. Such has been the position of this country! To such\r\na dead lock has it been brought by the attempted but impossible\r\namalgamation of North and South. Mr. Crittenden's compromise was\r\nmoonshine. It was utterly out of the question that the free States\r\nshould bind themselves to the rendition of escaped slaves,--or that\r\nMr. Lincoln, who had just been brought in by their voices, should\r\nagree to any compromise which should attempt so to bind them. Lord\r\nPalmerston might as well attempt to re-enact the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question whether Mr. Lincoln or his Government could\r\nhave prevented the war after he had entered upon his office in March,\r\n1861? I do not suppose that any one thinks that he could have avoided\r\nsecession and avoided the war also;--that by any ordinary effort of\r\nGovernment he could have secured the adhesion of the Gulf States to\r\nthe Union after the first shot had been fired at Fort Sumter. The\r\ngeneral opinion in England is, I take it, this,--that secession then\r\nwas manifestly necessary, and that all the bloodshed and money-shed,\r\nand all this destruction of commerce and of agriculture might have\r\nbeen prevented by a graceful adhesion to an indisputable fact. But\r\nthere are some facts, even some indisputable facts, to which a\r\ngraceful adherence is not possible. Could King Bomba have welcomed\r\nGaribaldi to Naples? Can the Pope shake hands with Victor Emmanuel?\r\nCould the English have surrendered to their rebel colonists peaceable\r\npossession of the colonies? The indisputability of a fact is not very\r\neasily settled while the circumstances are in course of action by\r\nwhich the fact is to be decided. The men of the northern States have\r\nnot believed in the necessity of secession, but have believed it to\r\nbe their duty to enforce the adherence of these States to the Union.\r\nThe American Governments have been much given to compromises, but had\r\nMr. Lincoln attempted any compromise by which any one southern State\r\ncould have been let out of the Union, he would have been impeached.\r\nIn all probability the whole constitution would have gone to ruin,\r\nand the presidency would have been at an end. At any rate, his\r\npresidency would have been at an end. When secession, or in other\r\nwords rebellion, was once commenced, he had no alternative but the\r\nuse of coercive measures for putting it down;--that is, he had no\r\nalternative but war. It is not to be supposed that he or his ministry\r\ncontemplated such a war as has existed,--with 600,000 men in arms on\r\none side, each man with his whole belongings maintained at a cost of\r\n£150 per annum, or ninety millions sterling per annum for the army.\r\nNor did we, when we resolved to put down the French revolution, think\r\nof such a national debt as we now owe. These things grow by degrees,\r\nand the mind also grows in becoming used to them; but I cannot see\r\nthat there was any moment at which Mr. Lincoln could have stayed his\r\nhand and cried Peace! It is easy to say now that acquiescence in\r\nsecession would have been better than war, but there has been no\r\nmoment when he could have said so with any avail. It was incumbent on\r\nhim to put down rebellion, or to be put down by it. So it was with us\r\nin America in 1776.\r\n\r\nI do not think that we in England have quite sufficiently taken all\r\nthis into consideration. We have been in the habit of exclaiming very\r\nloudly against the war, execrating its cruelty and anathematizing its\r\nresults, as though the cruelty were all superfluous and the results\r\nunnecessary. But I do not remember to have seen any statement as to\r\nwhat the northern States should have done,--what they should have\r\ndone, that is, as regards the South, or when they should have done\r\nit. It seems to me that we have decided as regards them that civil\r\nwar is a very bad thing, and that therefore civil war should be\r\navoided. But bad things cannot always be avoided. It is this feeling\r\non our part that has produced so much irritation in them against\r\nus,--reproducing, of course, irritation on our part against them.\r\nThey cannot understand that we should not wish them to be successful\r\nin putting down a rebellion; nor can we understand why they should be\r\noutrageous against us for standing aloof, and keeping our hands, if\r\nit be only possible, out of the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen Slidell and Mason were arrested, my opinions were not changed,\r\nbut my feelings were altered. I seemed to acknowledge to myself that\r\nthe treatment to which England had been subjected, and the manner in\r\nwhich that treatment was discussed, made it necessary that I should\r\nregard the question as it existed between England and the States,\r\nrather than in its reference to the North and South. I had always\r\nfelt that as regarded the action of our Government we had been sans\r\nreproche; that in arranging our conduct we had thought neither of\r\nmoney nor political influence, but simply of the justice of the\r\ncase,--promising to abstain from all interference and keeping that\r\npromise faithfully. It had been quite clear to me that the men of the\r\nNorth, and the women also, had failed to appreciate this, looking, as\r\nmen in a quarrel always do look, for special favour on their side.\r\nEverything that England did was wrong. If a private merchant, at his\r\nown risk, took a cargo of rifles to some southern port, that act to\r\nnorthern eyes was an act of English interference,--of favour shown to\r\nthe South by England as a nation; but twenty shiploads of rifles sent\r\nfrom England to the North merely signified a brisk trade and a desire\r\nfor profit. The \"James Adger,\" a northern man-of-war, was refitted\r\nat Southampton as a matter of course. There was no blame to England\r\nfor that. But the \"Nashville,\" belonging to the Confederates, should\r\nnot have been allowed into English waters! It was useless to speak\r\nof neutrality. No Northerner would understand that a rebel could\r\nhave any mutual right. The South had no claim in his eyes as a\r\nbelligerent, though the North claimed all those rights which he could\r\nonly enjoy by the fact of there being a recognized war between him\r\nand his enemy the South. The North was learning to hate England,\r\nand day by day the feeling grew upon me that, much as I wished to\r\nespouse the cause of the North, I should have to espouse the cause\r\nof my own country. Then Slidell and Mason were arrested, and I began\r\nto calculate how long I might remain in the country. \"There is no\r\ndanger. We are quite right,\" the lawyers said. \"There are Vattel\r\nand Puffendorff and Stowell and Phillimore and Wheaton,\" said the\r\nladies. \"Ambassadors are contraband all the world over,--more so than\r\ngunpowder; and if taken in a neutral bottom, &c.\" I wonder why ships\r\nare always called bottoms when spoken of with legal technicality? But\r\nneither the lawyers nor the ladies convinced me. I know that there\r\nare matters which will be read not in accordance with any written\r\nlaw, but in accordance with the bias of the reader's mind. Such laws\r\nare made to be strained any way. I knew how it would be. All the\r\nlegal acumen of New England declared the seizure of Slidell and Mason\r\nto be right. The legal acumen of Old England has declared it to be\r\nwrong; and I have no doubt that the ladies of Old England can prove\r\nit to be wrong out of Vattel, Puffendorff, Stowell, Phillimore, and\r\nWheaton.\r\n\r\n\"But there's Grotius,\" I said, to an elderly female at New York,\r\nwho had quoted to me some half-dozen writers on international law,\r\nthinking thereby that I should trump her last card. \"I've looked into\r\nGrotius too,\" said she, \"and as far as I can see,\" &c. &c. &c. So\r\nI had to fall back again on the convictions to which instinct and\r\ncommon sense had brought me. I never doubted for a moment that those\r\nconvictions would be supported by English lawyers.\r\n\r\nI left Boston with a sad feeling at my heart that a quarrel was\r\nimminent between England and the States, and that any such quarrel\r\nmust be destructive to the cause of the North. I had never believed\r\nthat the States of New England and the Gulf States would again become\r\nparts of one nation, but I had thought that the terms of separation\r\nwould be dictated by the North, and not by the South. I had felt\r\nassured that South Carolina and the Gulf States, across from\r\nthe Atlantic to Texas, would succeed in forming themselves into\r\na separate confederation; but I had still hoped that Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, and Missouri might be saved to the grander empire\r\nof the North, and that thus a great blow to slavery might be the\r\nconsequence of this civil war. But such ascendancy could only fall to\r\nthe North by reason of their command of the sea. The northern ports\r\nwere all open, and the southern ports were all closed. But if this\r\nshould be reversed. If by England's action the southern ports should\r\nbe opened, and the northern ports closed, the North could have no\r\nfair expectation of success. The ascendancy in that case would all be\r\nwith the South. Up to that moment,--the Christmas of 1861,--Maryland\r\nwas kept in subjection by the guns which General Dix had planted\r\nover the city of Baltimore. Two-thirds of Virginia were in active\r\nrebellion, coerced originally into that position by her dependence\r\nfor the sale of her slaves on the cotton States. Kentucky was\r\ndoubtful, and divided. When the federal troops prevailed, Kentucky\r\nwas loyal; when the Confederate troops prevailed, Kentucky was\r\nrebellious. The condition in Missouri was much the same. Those four\r\nStates, by two of which the capital, with its district of Columbia,\r\nis surrounded, might be gained, or might be lost. And these four\r\nStates are susceptible of white labour,--as much so as Ohio and\r\nIllinois,--are rich in fertility, and rich also in all associations\r\nwhich must be dear to Americans. Without Virginia, Maryland, and\r\nKentucky, without the Potomac, the Chesapeake, and Mount Vernon,\r\nthe North would indeed be shorn of its glory! But it seemed to be\r\nin the power of the North to say under what terms secession should\r\ntake place, and where should be the line. A senator from South\r\nCarolina could never again sit in the same chamber with one from\r\nMassachusetts; but there need be no such bar against the border\r\nStates. So much might at any rate be gained, and might stand\r\nhereafter as the product of all that money spent on 600,000 soldiers.\r\nBut if the Northerners should now elect to throw themselves into\r\na quarrel with England, if in the gratification of a shameless\r\nbraggadocio they should insist on doing what they liked, not only\r\nwith their own, but with the property of all others also, it\r\ncertainly did seem as though utter ruin must await their cause. With\r\nEngland, or one might say with Europe, against them, secession must\r\nbe accomplished, not on northern terms, but on terms dictated by the\r\nSouth. The choice was then for them to make; and just at that time it\r\nseemed as though they were resolved to throw away every good card out\r\nof their hand. Such had been the ministerial wisdom of Mr. Seward.\r\nI remember hearing the matter discussed in easy terms by one of the\r\nUnited States senators. \"Remember, Mr. Trollope,\" he said to me, \"we\r\ndon't want a war with England. If the choice is given to us, we had\r\nrather not fight England. Fighting is a bad thing. But remember this\r\nalso, Mr. Trollope--that if the matter is pressed on us, we have\r\nno great objection. We had rather not, but we don't care much one\r\nway or the other.\" What one individual may say to another is not of\r\nmuch moment, but this senator was expressing the feelings of his\r\nconstituents, who were the legislature of the State from whence he\r\ncame. He was expressing the general idea on the subject of a large\r\nbody of Americans. It was not that he and his State had really no\r\nobjection to the war. Such a war loomed terribly large before the\r\nminds of them all. They knew it to be fraught with the saddest\r\nconsequences. It was so regarded in the mind of that senator. But the\r\nbraggadocio could not be omitted. Had he omitted it, he would have\r\nbeen untrue to his constituency.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Boston for Washington nothing was as yet known of what\r\nthe English Government or the English lawyers might say. This was in\r\nthe first week in December, and the expected voice from England could\r\nnot be heard till the end of the second week. It was a period of\r\ngreat suspense, and of great sorrow also to the more sober-minded\r\nAmericans. To me the idea of such a war was terrible. It seemed that\r\nin these days all the hopes of our youth were being shattered. That\r\npoetic turning of the sword into a sickle, which gladdened our hearts\r\nten or twelve years since, had been clean banished from men's minds.\r\nTo belong to a peace-party was to be either a fanatic, an idiot, or\r\na driveller. The arts of war had become everything. Armstrong guns,\r\nthemselves indestructible, but capable of destroying everything\r\nwithin sight, and most things out of sight, were the only recognized\r\nresults of man's inventive faculties. To build bigger, stronger, and\r\nmore ships than the French was England's glory. To hit a speck with\r\na rifle bullet at 800 yards' distance was an Englishman's first duty.\r\nThe proper use for a young man's leisure hours was the practice of\r\ndrilling. All this had come upon us with very quick steps, since the\r\nbeginning of the Russian war. But if fighting must needs be done, one\r\ndid not feel special grief at fighting a Russian. That the Indian\r\nmutiny should be put down was a matter of course. That those Chinese\r\nrascals should be forced into the harness of civilization was a good\r\nthing. That England should be as strong as France,--or perhaps, if\r\npossible, a little stronger,--recommended itself to an Englishman's\r\nmind as a State necessity. But a war with the States of America! In\r\nthinking of it I began to believe that the world was going backwards.\r\nOver sixty millions sterling of stock--railway stock and such\r\nlike--are held in America by Englishmen, and the chances would be\r\nthat before such a war could be finished the whole of that would be\r\nconfiscated. Family connections between the States and the British\r\nisles are almost as close as between one of those islands and\r\nanother. The commercial intercourse between the two countries has\r\ngiven bread to millions of Englishmen, and a break in it would rob\r\nmillions of their bread. These people speak our language, use our\r\nprayers, read our books, are ruled by our laws, dress themselves in\r\nour image, are warm with our blood. They have all our virtues; and\r\ntheir vices are our own too, loudly as we call out against them. They\r\nare our sons and our daughters, the source of our greatest pride, and\r\nas we grow old they should be the staff of our age. Such a war as we\r\nshould now wage with the States would be an unloosing of hell upon\r\nall that is best upon the world's surface. If in such a war we beat\r\nthe Americans, they with their proud stomachs would never forgive\r\nus. If they should be victors, we should never forgive ourselves. I\r\ncertainly could not bring myself to speak of it with the equanimity\r\nof my friend the senator.\r\n\r\nI went through New York to Philadelphia and made a short visit to the\r\nlatter town. Philadelphia seems to me to have thrown off its Quaker\r\ngarb, and to present itself to the world in the garments ordinarily\r\nassumed by large cities; by which I intend to express my opinion\r\nthat the Philadelphians are not in these latter days any better than\r\ntheir neighbours. I am not sure whether in some respects they may not\r\nperhaps be worse. Quakers,--Quakers absolutely in the very flesh of\r\nclose bonnets and brown knee-breeches,--are still to be seen there;\r\nbut they are not numerous, and would not strike the eye if one did\r\nnot specially look for a Quaker at Philadelphia. It is a large town,\r\nwith a very large hotel,--there are no doubt half-a-dozen large\r\nhotels, but one of them is specially great,--with long straight\r\nstreets, good shops and markets, and decent comfortable-looking\r\nhouses. The houses of Philadelphia generally are not so large as\r\nthose of other great cities in the States. They are more modest than\r\nthose of New York, and less commodious than those of Boston. Their\r\nmost striking appendage is the marble steps at the front doors. Two\r\ndoors as a rule enjoy one set of steps, on the outer edges of which\r\nthere is generally no parapet or raised curb-stone. This, to my eye,\r\ngave the houses an unfinished appearance,--as though the marble ran\r\nshort, and no further expenditure could be made. The frost came when\r\nI was there, and then all these steps were covered up in wooden\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe city of Philadelphia lies between the two rivers, the Delaware\r\nand the Schuylkill. Eight chief streets run from river to river, and\r\ntwenty-four cross-streets bisect the eight at right angles. The long\r\nstreets are, with the exception of Market Street, called by the names\r\nof trees,--chesnut, walnut, pine, spruce, mulberry, vine, and so\r\non. The cross-streets are all called by their numbers. In the long\r\nstreets the numbers of the houses are not consecutive, but follow\r\nthe numbers of the cross streets; so that a person living in Chesnut\r\nStreet between Tenth Street and Eleventh Street, and ten doors from\r\nTenth Street, would live at No. 1010. The opposite house would be\r\nNo. 1011. It thus follows that the number of the house indicates the\r\nexact block of houses in which it is situated. I do not like the\r\nright-angled building of these towns, nor do I like the sound of\r\nTwentieth Street and Thirtieth Street; but I must acknowledge that\r\nthe arrangement in Philadelphia has its convenience. In New York I\r\nfound it by no means an easy thing to arrive at the desired locality.\r\n\r\nThey boast in Philadelphia that they have half a million inhabitants.\r\nIf this be taken as a true calculation, Philadelphia is in size the\r\nfourth city in the world,--putting out of the question the cities of\r\nChina, as to which we have heard so much and believe so little. But\r\nin making this calculation the citizens include the population of a\r\ndistrict on some sides ten miles distant from Philadelphia. It takes\r\nin other towns connected with it by railway but separated by large\r\nspaces of open country. American cities are very proud of their\r\npopulation, but if they all counted in this way, there would soon\r\nbe no rural population left at all. There is a very fine bank at\r\nPhiladelphia,--and Philadelphia is a town somewhat celebrated in\r\nits banking history. My remarks here, however, apply simply to the\r\nexternal building, and not to its internal honesty and wisdom, or to\r\nits commercial credit.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia also stands the old house of Congress,--the house in\r\nwhich the Congress of the United States was held previous to 1800,\r\nwhen the Government, and the Congress with it, were moved to the\r\nnew city of Washington. I believe, however, that the first Congress,\r\nproperly so called, was assembled at New York in 1789, the date of\r\nthe inauguration of the first President. It was, however, here, in\r\nthis building at Philadelphia, that the independence of the Union was\r\ndeclared in 1776, and that the constitution of the United States was\r\nframed.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, with Philadelphia for its capital, was once the leading\r\nState of the Union,--leading by a long distance. At the end of the\r\nlast century it beat all the other States in population, but has\r\nsince been surpassed by New York in all respects,--in population,\r\ncommerce, wealth, and general activity. Of course it is known that\r\nPennsylvania was granted to William Penn, the Quaker, by Charles\r\nII. I cannot completely understand what was the meaning of such\r\ngrants,--how far they implied absolute possession in the territory,\r\nor how far they confirmed simply the power of settling and governing\r\na colony. In this case a very considerable property was confirmed, as\r\nthe claim made by Penn's children after Penn's death was bought up by\r\nthe commonwealth of Pennsylvania for £130,000; which in those days\r\nwas a large price for almost any landed estate on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania lies directly on the borders of slave land, being\r\nimmediately north of Maryland. Mason and Dixon's line, of which\r\nwe hear so often, and which was first established as the division\r\nbetween slave soil and free soil, runs between Pennsylvania and\r\nMaryland. The little State of Delaware, which lies between Maryland\r\nand the Atlantic, is also tainted with slavery; but the stain is not\r\nheavy nor indelible. In a population of a hundred and twelve thousand\r\nthere are not two thousand slaves, and of these the owners generally\r\nwould willingly rid themselves if they could. It is, however, a point\r\nof honour with these owners, as it is also in Maryland, not to sell\r\ntheir slaves; and a man who cannot sell his slaves must keep them.\r\nWere he to enfranchise them and send them about their business, they\r\nwould come back upon his hands. Were he to enfranchise them and pay\r\nthem wages for work, they would get the wages but he would not get\r\nthe work. They would get the wages, but at the end of three months\r\nthey would still fall back upon his hands in debt and distress,\r\nlooking to him for aid and comfort as a child looks for it. It is\r\nnot easy to get rid of a slave in a slave State. That question of\r\nenfranchising slaves is not one to be very readily solved.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania the right of voting is confined to free white men. In\r\nNew York the coloured free men have the right to vote, providing they\r\nhave a certain small property qualification, and have been citizens\r\nfor three years in the State;--whereas a white man need have been a\r\ncitizen but for ten days, and need have no property qualification;\r\nfrom which it is seen that the position of the negro becomes worse,\r\nor less like that of a white man, as the border of slave land is more\r\nnearly reached. But in the teeth of this embargo on coloured men, the\r\nconstitution of Pennsylvania asserts broadly that all men are born\r\nequally free and independent. One cannot conceive how two clauses\r\ncan have found their way into the same document so absolutely\r\ncontradictory to each other. The first clause says that white men\r\nshall vote, and that black men shall not, which means that all\r\npolitical action shall be confined to white men. The second clause\r\nsays that all men are born equally free and independent!\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia I for the first time came across live\r\nsecessionists,--secessionists who pronounced themselves to be such. I\r\nwill not say that I had met in other cities men who falsely declared\r\nthemselves true to the Union; but I had fancied, in regard to some,\r\nthat their words were a little stronger than their feelings. When\r\na man's bread,--and much more, when the bread of his wife and\r\nchildren,--depends on his professing a certain line of political\r\nconviction, it is very hard for him to deny his assent to the truth\r\nof the argument. One feels that a man under such circumstances is\r\nbound to be convinced, unless he be in a position which may make\r\na stanch adherence to opposite politics a matter of grave public\r\nimportance. In the North I had fancied that I could sometimes read a\r\nsecessionist tendency under a cloud of unionist protestations. But in\r\nPhiladelphia men did not seem to think it necessary to have recourse\r\nto such a cloud. I generally found in mixed society, even there, that\r\nthe discussion of secession was not permitted; but in society that\r\nwas not mixed, I heard very strong opinions expressed on each side.\r\nWith the unionists nothing was so strong as the necessity of keeping\r\nSlidell and Mason. When I suggested that the English Government would\r\nprobably require their surrender, I was talked down and ridiculed.\r\n\"Never that; come what may.\" Then, within half an hour, I would be\r\ntold by a secessionist that England must demand reparation if she\r\nmeant to retain any place among the great nations of the world;\r\nbut he also would declare that the men would not be surrendered.\r\n\"She must make the demand,\" the secessionist would say, \"and then\r\nthere will be war; and after that we shall see whose ports will be\r\nblockaded!\" The Southerner has ever looked to England for some breach\r\nof the blockade, quite as strongly as the North has looked to England\r\nfor sympathy and aid in keeping it.\r\n\r\nThe railway from Philadelphia to Baltimore passes along the top of\r\nChesapeake Bay and across the Susquehanna river; at least the railway\r\ncars do so. On one side of that river they are run on to a huge\r\nferryboat, and are again run off at the other side. Such an operation\r\nwould seem to be one of difficulty to us under any circumstances;\r\nbut as the Susquehanna is a tidal river, rising and falling a\r\nconsiderable number of feet, the natural impediment in the way of\r\nsuch an enterprise would, I think, have staggered us. We should have\r\nbuilt a bridge costing two or three millions sterling, on which no\r\nconceivable amount of traffic would pay a fair dividend. Here, in\r\ncrossing the Susquehanna, the boat is so constructed that its deck\r\nshall be level with the line of the railway at half tide, so that the\r\ninclined plane from the shore down to the boat, or from the shore up\r\nto the boat, shall never exceed half the amount of the rise or fall.\r\nOne would suppose that the most intricate machinery would have been\r\nnecessary for such an arrangement; but it was all rough and simple,\r\nand apparently managed by two negroes. We should employ a small corps\r\nof engineers to conduct such an operation, and men and women would\r\nbe detained in their carriages under all manner of threats as to the\r\nperil of life and limb; but here everybody was expected to look out\r\nfor himself. The cars were dragged up the inclined plane by a hawser\r\nattached to an engine, which hawser, had the stress broken it, as I\r\ncould not but fancy probable, would have flown back and cut to pieces\r\na lot of us who were standing in front of the car. But I do not\r\nthink that any such accident would have caused very much attention.\r\nLife and limbs are not held to be so precious here as they are in\r\nEngland. It may be a question whether with us they are not almost too\r\nprecious. Regarding railways in America generally, as to the relative\r\nsafety of which, when compared with our own, we have not in England a\r\nhigh opinion, I must say that I never saw any accident or in any way\r\nbecame conversant with one. It is said that large numbers of men and\r\nwomen are slaughtered from time to time on different lines; but if it\r\nbe so, the newspapers make very light of such cases. I myself have\r\nseen no such slaughter, nor have I even found myself in the vicinity\r\nof a broken bone. Beyond the Susquehanna we passed over a creek of\r\nChesapeake Bay on a long bridge. The whole scenery here is very\r\npretty, and the view up the Susquehanna is fine. This is the bay\r\nwhich divides the State of Maryland into two parts, and which is\r\nblessed beyond all other bays by the possession of canvas-back ducks.\r\nNature has done a great deal for the State of Maryland, but in\r\nnothing more than in sending thither these web-footed birds of\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nNature has done a great deal for Maryland; and Fortune also has\r\ndone much for it in these latter days in directing the war from\r\nits territory. But for the peculiar position of Washington as the\r\ncapital, all that is now being done in Virginia would have been done\r\nin Maryland, and I must say that the Marylanders did their best to\r\nbring about such a result. Had the presence of the war been regarded\r\nby the men of Baltimore as an unalloyed benefit, they could not have\r\nmade a greater struggle to bring it close to them. Nevertheless fate\r\nhas so far spared them.\r\n\r\nAs the position of Maryland and the course of events as they took\r\nplace in Baltimore on the commencement of secession had considerable\r\ninfluence both in the North and in the South, I will endeavour\r\nto explain how that State was affected, and how the question was\r\naffected by that State. Maryland, as I have said before, is a slave\r\nState lying immediately south of Mason and Dixon's line. Small\r\nportions both of Virginia and of Delaware do run north of Maryland,\r\nbut practically Maryland is the frontier State of the slave States.\r\nIt was therefore of much importance to know which way Maryland would\r\ngo in the event of secession among the slave States becoming general;\r\nand of much also to ascertain whether it could secede if desirous of\r\ndoing so. I am inclined to think that as a State it was desirous of\r\nfollowing Virginia, though there are many in Maryland who deny this\r\nvery stoutly. But it was at once evident that if loyalty to the North\r\ncould not be had in Maryland of its own free will, adherence to\r\nthe North must be enforced upon Maryland. Otherwise the city of\r\nWashington could not be maintained as the existing capital of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe question of the fidelity of the State to the Union was first\r\ntried by the arrival at Baltimore of a certain Commissioner from\r\nthe State of Mississippi, who visited that city with the object of\r\ninducing secession. It must be understood that Baltimore is the\r\ncommercial capital of Maryland, whereas Annapolis is the seat of\r\nGovernment and the legislature--or is, in other terms, the political\r\ncapital. Baltimore is a city containing 230,000 inhabitants, and is\r\nconsidered to have as strong and perhaps as violent a mob as any\r\ncity in the Union. Of the above number 30,000 are negroes and 2000\r\nare slaves. The Commissioner made his appeal, telling his tale of\r\nsouthern grievances, declaring, among other things, that secession\r\nwas not intended to break up the Government but to perpetuate it,\r\nand asked for the assistance and sympathy of Maryland. This was in\r\nDecember, 1860. The Commissioner was answered by Governor Hicks, who\r\nwas placed in a somewhat difficult position. The existing legislature\r\nof the State was presumed to be secessionist, but the legislature\r\nwas not sitting, nor in the ordinary course of things would that\r\nlegislature have been called on to sit again. The legislature of\r\nMaryland is elected every other year, and in the ordinary course\r\nsits only once in the two years. That session had been held, and the\r\nexisting legislature was therefore exempt from further work,--unless\r\nspecially summoned for an extraordinary session. To do this is within\r\nthe power of the Governor. But Governor Hicks, who seems to have been\r\nmainly anxious to keep things quiet, and whose individual politics\r\ndid not come out strongly, was not inclined to issue the summons.\r\n\"Let us show moderation as well as firmness,\" he said; and that\r\nwas about all he did say to the Commissioner from Mississippi.\r\nThe Governor after that was directly called on to convene the\r\nlegislature; but this he refused to do, alleging that it would not\r\nbe safe to trust the discussion of such a subject as secession\r\nto--\"excited politicians, many of whom having nothing to lose from\r\nthe destruction of the Government, may hope to derive some gain\r\nfrom the ruin of the State!\" I quote these words, coming from the\r\nhead of the executive of the State and spoken with reference to the\r\nlegislature of the State, with the object of showing in what light\r\nthe political leaders of a State may be held in that very State to\r\nwhich they belong! If we are to judge of these legislators from the\r\nopinion expressed by Governor Hicks, they could hardly have been\r\nfit for their places. That plan of governing by the little men has\r\ncertainly not answered. It need hardly be said that Governor Hicks,\r\nhaving expressed such an opinion of his State's legislature, refused\r\nto call them to an extraordinary session.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, 1860, Governor Hicks issued a proclamation to\r\nthe people of Maryland, begging them to be quiet, the chief object\r\nof which, however, was that of promising that no troops should be\r\nsent out from their State, unless with the object of guarding the\r\nneighbouring city of Washington,--a promise which he had no means\r\nof fulfilling, seeing that the President of the United States is\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief of the army of the nation and can summon the\r\nmilitia of the several States. This proclamation by the Governor\r\nto the State was immediately backed up by one from the Mayor of\r\nBaltimore to the city, in which he congratulates the citizens on\r\nthe Governor's promise that none of their troops are to be sent to\r\nanother State; and then he tells them that they shall be preserved\r\nfrom the horrors of civil war.\r\n\r\nBut on the very next day the horrors of civil war began in Baltimore.\r\nBy this time President Lincoln was collecting troops at Washington\r\nfor the protection of the capital; and that army of the Potomac,\r\nwhich has ever since occupied the Virginian side of the river,\r\nwas in course of construction. To join this, certain troops from\r\nMassachusetts were sent down by the usual route, viâ New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Baltimore; but on their reaching Baltimore\r\nby railway, the mob of that town refused to allow them to pass\r\nthrough,--and a fight began. Nine citizens were killed and two\r\nsoldiers, and as many more were wounded. This, I think, was the first\r\nblood spilt in the civil war; and the attack was first made by the\r\nmob of the first slave city reached by the northern soldiers. This\r\ngoes far to show, not that the border States desired secession, but\r\nthat, when compelled to choose between secession and union,--when not\r\nallowed by circumstances to remain neutral,--their sympathies were\r\nwith their sister slave States rather than with the North.\r\n\r\nThen there was a great running about of official men between\r\nBaltimore and Washington, and the President was besieged with\r\nentreaties that no troops should be sent through Baltimore. Now this\r\nwas hard enough upon President Lincoln, seeing that he was bound to\r\ndefend his capital, that he could get no troops from the South, and\r\nthat Baltimore is on the high road from Washington, both to the West\r\nand to the North; but, nevertheless, he gave way. Had he not done\r\nso, all Baltimore would have been in a blaze of rebellion, and the\r\nscene of the coming contest must have been removed from Virginia to\r\nMaryland, and Congress and the Government must have travelled from\r\nWashington north to Philadelphia. \"They shall not come through\r\nBaltimore,\" said Mr. Lincoln. \"But they shall come through the State\r\nof Maryland. They shall be passed over Chesapeake Bay by water to\r\nAnnapolis, and shall come up by rail from thence.\" This arrangement\r\nwas as distasteful to the State of Maryland as the other; but\r\nAnnapolis is a small town without a mob, and the Marylanders had no\r\nmeans of preventing the passage of the troops. Attempts were made to\r\nrefuse the use of the Annapolis branch railway, but General Butler\r\nhad the arranging of that. General Butler was a lawyer from Boston,\r\nand by no means inclined to indulge the scruples of the Marylanders\r\nwho had so roughly treated his fellow-citizens from Massachusetts.\r\nThe troops did therefore pass through Annapolis, much to the disgust\r\nof the State. On the 27th of April Governor Hicks, having now had a\r\nsufficiency of individual responsibility, summoned the legislature\r\nof which he had expressed so bad an opinion; but on this occasion\r\nhe omitted to repeat that opinion, and submitted his views in very\r\nproper terms to the wisdom of the senators and representatives. He\r\nentertained, as he said, an honest conviction that the safety of\r\nMaryland lay in preserving a neutral position between the North and\r\nthe South. Certainly, Governor Hicks, if it were only possible! The\r\nlegislature again went to work to prevent, if it might be prevented,\r\nthe passage of troops through their State; but luckily for them,\r\nthey failed. The President was bound to defend Washington, and the\r\nMarylanders were denied their wish of having their own fields made\r\nthe fighting ground of the civil war.\r\n\r\nThat which appears to me to be the most remarkable feature in all\r\nthis is the antagonism between United States law and individual State\r\nfeeling. Through the whole proceeding the Governor and the State of\r\nMaryland seemed to have considered it legal and reasonable to oppose\r\nthe constitutional power of the President and his Government. It is\r\nargued in all the speeches and written documents that were produced\r\nin Maryland at the time, that Maryland was true to the Union; and yet\r\nshe put herself in opposition to the constitutional military power of\r\nthe President! Certain commissioners went from the State legislature\r\nto Washington, in May, and from their report, it appears that the\r\nPresident had expressed himself of opinion that Maryland might do\r\nthis or that, as long \"as she had not taken and was not about to take\r\na hostile attitude to the Federal Government!\" From which we are to\r\ngather that a denial of that military power given to the President\r\nby the constitution was not considered as an attitude hostile to\r\nthe Federal Government. At any rate, it was direct disobedience\r\nof federal law. I cannot but revert from this to the condition\r\nof the fugitive slave law. Federal law, and indeed the original\r\nconstitution, plainly declare that fugitive slaves shall be given\r\nup by the free-soil States. Massachusetts proclaims herself to be\r\nspecially a federal, law-loving State. But every man in Massachusetts\r\nknows that no judge, no sheriff, no magistrate, no policeman in that\r\nState would at this time, or then, when that civil war was beginning,\r\nhave lent a hand in any way to the rendition of a fugitive slave. The\r\nFederal law requires the State to give up the fugitive, but the State\r\nlaw does not require judge, sheriff, magistrate, or policeman to\r\nengage in such work, and no judge, sheriff, or magistrate will do so;\r\nconsequently that Federal law is dead in Massachusetts, as it is also\r\nin every free-soil State,--dead, except inasmuch as there was life\r\nin it to create ill-blood as long as the North and South remained\r\ntogether, and would be life in it for the same effect if they should\r\nagain be brought under the same flag.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th May the Maryland legislature, having received the\r\nreport of their Commissioners above-mentioned, passed the following\r\nresolution:--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the war against the Confederate States is unconstitutional\r\nand repugnant to civilization, and will result in a bloody and\r\nshameful overthrow of our constitution, and whilst recognizing the\r\nobligations of Maryland to the Union, we sympathize with the South in\r\nthe struggle for their rights; for the sake of humanity we are for\r\npeace and reconciliation, and solemnly protest against this war, and\r\nwill take no part in it.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved,--That Maryland implores the President, in the name of\r\nGod, to cease this unholy war, at least until Congress assembles\"--a\r\nperiod of above six months. \"That Maryland desires and consents to\r\nthe recognition of the independence of the Confederate States. The\r\nmilitary occupation of Maryland is unconstitutional, and she protests\r\nagainst it, though the violent interference with the transit of the\r\nFederal troops is discountenanced. That the vindication of her rights\r\nbe left to time and reason, and that a convention under existing\r\ncircumstances is inexpedient.\"\r\n\r\nFrom which it is plain that Maryland would have seceded as\r\neffectually as Georgia seceded, had she not been prevented by\r\nthe interposition of Washington between her and the Confederate\r\nStates,--the happy intervention, seeing that she has thus been saved\r\nfrom becoming the battle-ground of the contest. But the legislature\r\nhad to pay for its rashness. On the 13th of September thirteen of\r\nits members were arrested, as were also two editors of newspapers\r\npresumed to be secessionists. A member of Congress was also arrested\r\nat the same time, and a candidate for Governor Hicks's place, who\r\nbelonged to the secessionist party. Previously, in the last days of\r\nJune and beginning of July, the chief of the police at Baltimore\r\nand the members of the Board of Police had been arrested by General\r\nBanks, who then held Baltimore in his power.\r\n\r\nI should be sorry to be construed as saying that republican\r\ninstitutions, or what may more properly be called democratic\r\ninstitutions, have been broken down in the States of America. I am\r\nfar from thinking that they have broken down. Taking them and their\r\nwork as a whole, I think that they have shown, and still show,\r\nvitality of the best order. But the written constitution of the\r\nUnited States and of the several States, as bearing upon each other,\r\nare not equal to the requirements made upon them. That, I think,\r\nis the conclusion to which a spectator should come. It is in that\r\ndoctrine of finality that our friends have broken down,--a doctrine\r\nnot expressed in their constitutions, and indeed expressly denied in\r\nthe constitution of the United States, which provides the mode in\r\nwhich amendments shall be made--but appearing plainly enough in every\r\nword of self-gratulation which comes from them. Political finality\r\nhas ever proved a delusion,--as has the idea of finality in all\r\nhuman institutions. I do not doubt but that the republican form of\r\ngovernment will remain and make progress in North America; but such\r\nprolonged existence and progress must be based on an acknowledgment\r\nof the necessity for change, and must in part depend on the\r\nfacilities for change which shall be afforded.\r\n\r\nI have described the condition of Baltimore as it was early in May,\r\n1861. I reached that city just seven months later, and its condition\r\nwas considerably altered. There was no question then whether troops\r\nshould pass through Baltimore, or by an awkward round through\r\nAnnapolis, or not pass at all through Maryland. General Dix, who\r\nhad succeeded General Banks, was holding the city in his grip, and\r\nmartial law prevailed. In such times as those, it was bootless to\r\ninquire as to that promise that no troops should pass southward\r\nthrough Baltimore. What have such assurances ever been worth in such\r\ndays! Baltimore was now a military depot in the hands of the northern\r\narmy, and General Dix was not a man to stand any trifling. He did me\r\nthe honour to take me to the top of Federal Hill, a suburb of the\r\ncity, on which he had raised great earthworks and planted mighty\r\ncannons, and built tents and barracks for his soldiery, and to show\r\nme how instantaneously he could destroy the town from his exalted\r\nposition. \"This hill was made for the very purpose,\" said General\r\nDix; and no doubt he thought so. Generals, when they have fine\r\npositions and big guns and prostrate people lying under their thumbs,\r\nare inclined to think that God's providence has specially ordained\r\nthem and their points of vantage. It is a good thing in the mind of\r\na general so circumstanced that 200,000 men should be made subject\r\nto a dozen big guns. I confess that to me, having had no military\r\neducation, the matter appeared in a different light, and I could\r\nnot work up my enthusiasm to a pitch which would have been suitable\r\nto the General's courtesy. That hill, on which many of the poor of\r\nBaltimore had lived, was desecrated in my eyes by those columbiads.\r\nThe neat earthworks were ugly, as looked upon by me; and though I\r\nregarded General Dix as energetic, and no doubt skilful in the work\r\nassigned to him, I could not sympathize with his exultation.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the days of secession Baltimore had been guarded by\r\nFort MacHenry, which lies on a spit of land running out into the bay\r\njust below the town. Hither I went with General Dix, and he explained\r\nto me how the cannon had heretofore been pointed solely towards the\r\nsea; that, however, now was all changed, and the mouths of his bombs\r\nand great artillery were turned all the other way. The commandant of\r\nthe fort was with us, and other officers, and they all spoke of this\r\nmartial tenure as a great blessing. Hearing them, one could hardly\r\nfail to suppose that they had lived their forty, fifty, or sixty\r\nyears of life in full reliance on the powers of a military despotism.\r\nBut not the less were they American republicans, who, twelve months\r\nsince, would have dilated on the all-sufficiency of their republican\r\ninstitutions, and on the absence of any military restraint in their\r\ncountry, with that peculiar pride which characterizes the citizens\r\nof the States. There are, however, some lessons which may be learned\r\nwith singular rapidity!\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Baltimore when I visited that city. I found,\r\nnevertheless, that cakes and ale still prevailed there. I am inclined\r\nto think that cakes and ale prevail most freely in times that are\r\nperilous, and when sources of sorrow abound. I have seen more\r\nreckless joviality in a town stricken by pestilence than I ever\r\nencountered elsewhere. There was General Dix seated on Federal Hill\r\nwith his cannon; and there, beneath his artillery, were gentlemen\r\nhotly professing themselves to be secessionists, men whose sons and\r\nbrothers were in the southern army, and women--alas! whose brothers\r\nwould be in one army, and their sons in another. That was the part of\r\nit which was most heart-rending in this border land. In New England\r\nand New York men's minds at any rate were bent all in the same\r\ndirection,--as doubtless they were also in Georgia and Alabama. But\r\nhere fathers were divided from sons, and mothers from daughters.\r\nTerrible tales were told of threats uttered by one member of a family\r\nagainst another. Old ties of friendship were broken up. Society had\r\nso divided itself, that one side could hold no terms of courtesy with\r\nthe other. \"When this is over,\" one gentleman said to me, \"every man\r\nin Baltimore will have a quarrel to the death on his hands with some\r\nfriend whom he used to love.\" The complaints made on both sides were\r\neager and open-mouthed against the other.\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn an election for a new legislature of the State\r\nhad taken place, and the members returned were all supposed to be\r\nunionist. That they were prepared to support the Government is\r\ncertain. But no known or presumed secessionist was allowed to vote\r\nwithout first taking the oath of allegiance. The election therefore,\r\neven if the numbers were true, cannot be looked upon as a free\r\nelection. Voters were stopped at the poll and not allowed to\r\nvote unless they would take an oath which would, on their parts,\r\nundoubtedly have been false. It was also declared in Baltimore that\r\nmen engaged to promote the northern party were permitted to vote five\r\nor six times over, and the enormous number of votes polled on the\r\nGovernment side gave some colouring to the statement. At any rate an\r\nelection carried under General Dix's guns cannot be regarded as an\r\nopen election. It was out of the question that any election taken\r\nunder such circumstances should be worth anything as expressing\r\nthe minds of the people. Red and white had been declared to be the\r\ncolours of the Confederates, and red and white had of course become\r\nthe favourite colours of the Baltimore ladies. Then it was given\r\nout that red and white would not be allowed in the streets. Ladies\r\nwearing red and white were requested to return home. Children\r\ndecorated with red and white ribbons were stripped of their bits of\r\nfinery,--much to their infantine disgust and dismay. Ladies would put\r\nred and white ornaments in their windows, and the police would insist\r\non the withdrawal of the colours. Such was the condition of Baltimore\r\nduring the past winter. Nevertheless cakes and ale abounded; and\r\nthough there was deep grief in the city, and wailing in the recesses\r\nof many houses, and a feeling that the good times were gone, never\r\nto return within the days of many of them, still there existed an\r\nexcitement and a consciousness of the importance of the crisis which\r\nwas not altogether unsatisfactory. Men and women can endure to\r\nbe ruined, to be torn from their friends, to be overwhelmed with\r\navalanches of misfortune, better than they can endure to be dull.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is, or at any rate was, an aspiring city, proud of its\r\ncommerce and proud of its society. It has regarded itself as the New\r\nYork of the South, and to some extent has forced others so to regard\r\nit also. In many respects it is more like an English town than most\r\nof its transatlantic brethren, and the ways of its inhabitants are\r\nEnglish. In old days a pack of fox-hounds was kept here,--or indeed\r\nin days that are not yet very old, for I was told of their doings by\r\na gentleman who had long been a member of the hunt. The country looks\r\nas a hunting country should look, whereas no man that ever crossed a\r\nfield after a pack of hounds would feel the slightest wish to attempt\r\nthat process in New England or New York. There is in Baltimore\r\nan old inn with an old sign, standing at the corner of Eutaw and\r\nFranklin Streets, just such as may still be seen in the towns of\r\nSomersetshire, and before it are to be seen old wagons, covered and\r\nsoiled and battered, about to return from the city to the country,\r\njust as the wagons do in our own agricultural counties. I have found\r\nnothing so thoroughly English in any other part of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut canvas-back ducks and terrapins are the great glories of\r\nBaltimore. Of the nature of the former bird I believe all the world\r\nknows something. It is a wild duck which obtains the peculiarity of\r\nits flavour from the wild celery on which it feeds. This celery grows\r\non the Chesapeake Bay, and I believe on the Chesapeake Bay only. At\r\nany rate Baltimore is the head-quarters of the canvas-backs, and it\r\nis on the Chesapeake Bay that they are shot. I was kindly invited to\r\ngo down on a shooting-party; but when I learned that I should have to\r\nensconce myself alone for hours in a wet wooden box on the water's\r\nedge, waiting there for the chance of a duck to come to me, I\r\ndeclined. The fact of my never having as yet been successful in\r\nshooting a bird of any kind conduced somewhat perhaps to my decision.\r\nI must acknowledge that the canvas-back duck fully deserves all the\r\nreputation it has acquired. As to the terrapin, I have not so much to\r\nsay. The terrapin is a small turtle, found on the shores of Maryland\r\nand Virginia, out of which a very rich soup is made. It is cooked\r\nwith wines and spices, and is served in the shape of a hash, with\r\nheaps of little bones mixed through it. It is held in great repute,\r\nand the guest is expected as a matter of course to be helped twice.\r\nThe man who did not eat twice of terrapin would be held in small\r\nrepute, as the Londoner is held who at a city banquet does not\r\npartake of both thick and thin turtle. I must, however, confess that\r\nthe terrapin for me had no surpassing charms.\r\n\r\nMaryland was so called from Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles\r\nI., by which king in 1632 the territory was conceded to the Roman\r\nCatholic Lord Baltimore. It was chiefly peopled by Roman Catholics,\r\nbut I do not think that there is now any such speciality attaching to\r\nthe State. There are in it two or three old Roman Catholic families,\r\nbut the people have come down from the North, and have no peculiar\r\nreligious tendencies. Some of Lord Baltimore's descendants remained\r\nin the State up to the time of the revolution. From Baltimore I went\r\non to Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.",
