[Price 2 Cents.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    STEPHEN H. BRANCH’S ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet Dad and Son Beware!\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper and Mayor Tiemann are old and sacred friends of George\r\nW. Matsell, who are more familiar with each other than they are\r\nwith the Bible, or morning and evening prayers. Mayor Tiemann was\r\nelected with the express condition that Matsell should be restored\r\nto his old position, and Peter Cooper and Mayor Tiemann, and James\r\nW. Gerard, and Ambrose C. Kingsland are at work for their lives to\r\neffect the restoration of Matsell, and all impends on the election of\r\na Commissioner in place of the noble Perrit. Matsell was in the city\r\nat the last Mayoralty election, conspiring against Wood, who saved him\r\nfrom the scaffold, after we convicted him of alienage and perjury,\r\nand the dastard and sacrilegious abjuration of his country. And at\r\nthe late election, he stabbed his benefactor down in the dust, in the\r\nassassin’s darkness, and did not play Brutus for the public virtue, but\r\nto consummate his restoration to an office (he had always degraded)\r\nwhich was in the contract between himself and Cooper, Tiemann, Gerard,\r\nand Kingsland, and other slavish friends. We know them all and the\r\nrendezvous of all their kindred Diavolos, whose names would fill the\r\njaws of the _Alligator_. Matsell professed to enter the city from\r\nIowa with flags and music on the day after Tiemann’s election, but he\r\nwas in the city long before, and concealed in as dark a cavern as the\r\nodious Cataline, while conspiring to foil the patriotic Cicero, and\r\nconsign the eternal city to a million thieves. And we now warn Cooper,\r\nTiemann, Gerard, and Kingsland to beware. For if they foist Matsell on\r\nthe city through the purchase of Nye or Bowen with Mayoralty, Street\r\nCommissioner, or the pap of the Mayor’s Executive vassals, we will make\r\ndisclosures that will make them stare like affrighted cats, (Gerard _a\r\nla_ he-cat, and the others _a la_ she-cats,) and rock the city to its\r\ncarbonic entrails. Talmadge must remain, although he annoyed his nurse\r\nand mother when a brat, and so did we; and in boyhood and early manhood\r\nwe both had worms, and raised Sancho Panza,\r\n\r\n  And we rambled around the town,\r\n  And saw perhaps Miss Julia Brown,\r\n\r\nas we may develop in the publication of our funny reminiscences;\r\nbut we are both growing old, and told our experience at the recent\r\nrevival, and asked admission as pious pilgrims, when the deacons said\r\nthat we should both be put on five year’s trial, but we begged so hard\r\nthey let us in. Talmadge joined the Presbyterians, and he looks pale\r\nand pensive, but we joined the noisy Methodists, and look mighty\r\ncheerful, and sing and dance, and scream like the devil in delirium\r\ntremens, and nervous neighbors murmur at our thundering methodistic\r\ndemonstrations. Talmadge as Recorder was too kind and lenient, but he\r\nerred on the side of humanity, which is preferable to err on the side\r\nof a pale and icy and bloodless liver, though we should steer between\r\nthe heart and liver, and consign the culprits to the pits and gulches\r\nof the navel, where the voracious worms could soon devour them. The\r\nvalor of Talmadge conquered the ruffians of Astor Place, and he has a\r\nRoman and Spartan nature, and is as generous and magnanimous as Clay\r\nor Webster, whom he loved as his own big heart. No man ever had a more\r\ngenial or sympathising bosom, than Frederick A. Talmadge. And William\r\nCurtis Noyes married his favorite daughter, and while, the spotless\r\nNoyes walks the velvet earth, and his father-in-law is Chief of Police,\r\nall will go well. Wm. Curtis Noyes is one of the ablest jurists of our\r\ncountry, and Washington himself had no purer, nor warmer, nor more\r\npatriotic heart. We selected Mr. Noyes as our counsel against little\r\nGeorgy Matsell, when arraigned before the Police Commissioners, and to\r\nhis ability and fidelity are New Yorkers profoundly indebted for the\r\ndownfall of Matsell, and the worst and most formidable banditti that\r\never scourged the Western Continent. Beware, then, Cooper Tiemann,\r\nGerard and Kingsland, and other trembling conspirators, or we will make\r\nyou howl, and open the gates of Tartarus, and set a million dogs and\r\ndevils at your heels, and when they bite, may God have mercy on your\r\npoor old bones. Beware, or we will harrow your superannuated souls into\r\nthe realms of Pluto, where _Robert le Diable_ will grab and burn you\r\nin liquid brimstone, through exhaustless years. Beware of those forty\r\npages yet behind. O, beware, we implore you, in the name of your wives\r\nand children, and your God! Beware of Matsell and his gang, as the big\r\nand little demons of these wicked times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvents and Public Plunderers.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard B. Connolly, the County Clerk, was born in Bandon, Ireland,\r\nand arrived in Philadelphia twenty-five years since, (as his glib,\r\nand slippery, and truthful tongue asseverates,) and thence immigrated\r\nto our metropolis. He became Simeon Draper’s Friday clerk, who taught\r\nhim the politician’s creed of plunder, and has ever used him as a spy\r\nin the democratic legions. Draper got him in the Customs, and kept\r\nhim there through several Administrations. Draper and Connolly long\r\ncontrolled the Ten Governors, and do now. Draper has been in all camps,\r\nand Connolly has figured in democratic conventions, primary and legal,\r\nof all stripes and checks, through which he acquired the immortal name\r\nof Slippery. Dick is an alien, and offered us between the pillars of\r\nPlunder Hall a lucrative position in the office of County Clerk, and\r\nalso proposed to play Judas against Matsell, if we would not expose\r\nhis perjured alienage. We had three interviews, when we assured him\r\nthat we despised both treason and traitor. He then got Alderman John\r\nKelly to read a letter in the Board of Aldermen, declaring that he was\r\nnaturalized in Independence Hall, Philadelphia, whither we repaired,\r\nand got certificates from the clerks, declaring that he was never\r\nnaturalized in Philadelphia, which we published in the _New York Daily\r\nTimes_. In his Aldermanic letter, he declared that his document of\r\nnaturalization was framed, which he regarded as his most valuable piece\r\nof furniture, and cordially invited his friends and the incredulous\r\nto call and behold its graceful decoration of his parlor. The gallant\r\nAlderman John H. Briggs, (the Putnam of the Americans, who braved\r\nand defied all the thieves, and murderers, and demons of hell in the\r\nMatsell campaign,) called to see Dick’s valuable gem of furniture,\r\nbut he could not find it on the wall, nor elsewhere. We then called,\r\nand Dick’s wife told us it was locked in a trunk, and her husband\r\nhad the key. Others called, with similar success. On his election as\r\nCounty Clerk, Dick and Draper got a law enacted at Albany, giving the\r\nCounty Clerk $50,000 fees, which was just so much stolen from the\r\npeople, whom the Municipal, State and National robbers will not let\r\nlive, but strive to rob them of their last crumb, and drive them into\r\nthe winter air. Public plunder is devoted to greasing the political\r\nwheels, and burnishing, and twitching the mysterious wires, through\r\nwhich the honest laborer is burdened with taxes, that mangle his\r\nback like the last feather of the expiring camel. Connolly, Busteed,\r\nDoane, Wetmore, Nathan, Nelson, Draper, and Weed, got the Record\r\nCommissioners appointed, through which $550,000 have been squandered\r\nfor printing the useless County Clerk and Register’s Records, which is\r\nthe boldest robbery of modern times. We never could induce Greeley,\r\nBryant, Webb’s Secretary, the Halls, and others, to breathe a word\r\nagainst this Dev-lin-ish plunder. And Flagg, himself, through his old\r\nprinting friends, Bowne & Hasbrouck, and others, is involved in this\r\nrecord robbery up to his chin, who never uttered a syllable against\r\nit, until we goaded him through our crimson dissection in the _Daily\r\nTimes_, and even then he only damned it with Iago praise. Since July\r\nlast, Flagg has paid more than $300,000 for Record printing, for\r\nwhich, old as he is, he should be consigned to a sunless dungeon, and\r\nrot there, with spiders only for his nurses and mourners. Last summer\r\nFlagg told us there never was a more wicked band of robbers than the\r\nRecord Commissioners, and yet he paid them from July to December the\r\nprodigious sum of over $300,000, and had paid them more than $200,000.\r\nAnd Flagg paid this enormous sum without a murmur, and has no possible\r\nfacility to place the infamy on the scapegoat Smith, who seems to roam\r\nat large unmolested by Flagg, who yet fears Smith’s disclosures of his\r\ndelinquency and superannuation. Flagg sputters a little in his reports,\r\nfor show, against him, but he is not chasing Smith very hotly in the\r\nCourts, nor dare he, as we have good reason to believe. Through the\r\nAlms House, Navy Yard, County Clerks’ Office, Record Commissioners,\r\nmetropolitan and suburban lots, and other plundering sources, Connolly\r\nhas amassed a fortune of nearly a million of dollars, and now has the\r\naudacity to proclaim himself a candidate for Comptroller, at which the\r\nhonorable citizens of New York should rise and paralyse his infamous\r\neffrontery. Not content with indolence all his days,—with robbing the\r\nlaborer and mechanic, and merchant, and widow, and orphan, for whom\r\nhe professes such boundless love, through his spurious and mercenary\r\ndemocracy,—with corrupting the ballot box, and packing juries, to\r\nimprison and hang us according to his caprice and public or private\r\ninterest,—with the election of Mayors and other municipal and even\r\nState and National officers, through his fraudulent canvass of votes\r\nas County Clerk,—and with his awful perjury in connection with his\r\nalienage, he now appears with his stolen money bags, and proclaims\r\nhimself a candidate for Comptroller, for which he should be lashed, and\r\nscourged, and probed to his marrow bones, through the streets of New\r\nYork, beneath the glare of the meridian sun, and the gaze and withering\r\nscorn of every honorable and industrious citizen, whom he has robbed,\r\nthrough intolerable taxation. Connolly has not voted since we exposed\r\nhis perjured alienage in 1855, when he strove to bribe us to shield him\r\nfrom the odium arising from his alienage. A public thief, and perjurer,\r\nand alien, this man or devil announces himself for Comptroller of this\r\nmighty metropolis, with a prospect of nomination and election, unless\r\nhis throat is cut by George H. Purser, a deeper and more dangerous\r\npublic villain than Connolly. Purser has robbed this city for a quarter\r\nof a century, and is also an unnaturalised alien, and we have positive\r\nevidence of the fact, and he knows it. His corrupt lobby operations in\r\nthe Common Council and at Albany would make a large volume. And both\r\nConnolly and Purser are nauseous scabs of the Democratic party, and\r\ngrossly pollute the glorious principles of Jefferson and Jackson. And\r\nnow, where, in the name of God, are the people, or is there no spirit\r\nand integrity, and patriotism, and courage, to resist the infernal\r\npublic thieves of this vandal age? Should the people slumber when a\r\ngang of robbers, and devils, and assassins, and fiends of rapine, are\r\nthundering at the gates of the commercial emporium, and even at the\r\nvery doors and firesides of our sacred domestic castles, and daily and\r\nhourly rob our coffers, and ravish our daughters, and cut our throats,\r\nin open day, and through their hellish robbery, and taxation, drive the\r\nmechanic and laborer, and their dear little ones, to hunger, and rags,\r\nand madness, and crime, and to the dungeon, or scaffold, or suicide?\r\nWhere is the concert of action of Boston and Providence, and throughout\r\nNew England? And where are the pomatum villains of our aristocratic\r\navenues, in this solemn hour? They are in league with your Greeleys,\r\nand Bryants, and Webbs, and Wetmores, and Drapers, and Connollys, and\r\nPursers, and Devlins, and Smiths, and Erbens, devising schemes to\r\nplunder the people here, at Albany and Washington, for gilded means\r\nto support themselves in idleness and extravagance, and to carry the\r\nelections against the gallant Southrons, whose throats they would cut\r\nfrom ear to ear, and deluge this whole land with human blood, ere they\r\nwould toil a solitary day like the honest laborer or mechanic, or\r\nsurrender a farthing of their ungodly plunder, or breathe a syllable in\r\nfavor of the eternal glory of the Union of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, MAY 15, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor and Charley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charley_—That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have\r\ncondemned and noted the devil for taking bribes of the office holders\r\nand contractors, wherein my letters praying on his side, because I knew\r\nthe man, were slighted off.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—You knew better than to pray for the devil.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—I can get no fat meat nor oyster stews, if every devil is\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Let mo tell you, Charley, that you, yourself, should be\r\ncondemned for itching to sell your offices and contracts for gold to a\r\ngang of devils.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—I got the itch! You know that you are great Peter’s son, or,\r\nby golly, you would not say so twice.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—The name of Itch or Scratch honor this corruption, and by the\r\nEternal, if Hickory dont hide his head at the Hermitage.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Hickory!\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Remember November,—the hides of November, O remember. Did not\r\ngreat Fernando bleed for me and Peter and Edward’s sake? Who touched\r\nhis carcase, and did stab, and not for me and Peter and young Edward?\r\nWhat! Shall they who struck the foremost man of all this city, but for\r\nsupporting robbers,—shall we now use our fingers, save to grab the\r\nMayor’s and all the Executive Departments? By all the bellonas and\r\ndoughnuts of the world, I’d rather be a hog and grow as fat as Matsell,\r\nthan to be a cadaverous crow, and live on vultures, and the shadows of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Daniel: I’ll slap your chops. I’ll not stand it. You forget\r\nyourself to pen me in. I’m a contractor, I, older in practice, and\r\nsharper than yourself to make contracts.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Go to: You are not, Charley.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Dam if I aint.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—I say you are not.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—How dare you so excite my dander? Look out for your dimes. I\r\nhad a father, and I was a baker.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Away spare man.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Toads and frogs! Am I Charley, or am I not. Where’s the\r\nlooking glass?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Hear me, for I’m dam’d if I dont belch. Must my bowels yield\r\nto your cholera? Shall I be frightened because the diarrhœa looks\r\nknives and scorpions through the windows of your liver?\r\n\r\n_Charley_—O, me. Must I stand this? O that I had a dough knife, to let\r\nout my honest blood.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—This? ay, and a dam lot more. Growl till your liver bursts. Go\r\nand tell your contractors and office-holders, how hard you have got the\r\ndiarrhœa, and make them tremble, lest you kick the bucket, and they\r\nget fleeced. Must I gouge? Must I lick you. Or must I get between your\r\nduck legs? By all the mush and Graham bread in the coat and boots and\r\nbelly of Horace, you shall digest all the grub and gin you have gulched\r\nto-day, though it do split your spleen and kidneys. And henceforth I’ll\r\nuse you as a brush and ladder for Peter and Edward and myself, to sweep\r\nthe streets, and scale the gilded heights of Record Hall, at whose\r\nprolific and teeming hive we will suck your honey like bumble bees.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—O, where am I?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—In a dam tight place. You say you are a better contractor.\r\nProve it. Make your braggadocio true, and I’ll not grumble. There may\r\nbe better contractors than me, but dam if I believe you are, though.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—O gingerbread! You gouge me every second, Daniel. I said an\r\nolder contractor, not a better. I know you can make better contracts\r\nthan me, in paint and oil and glass and putty, but I’m some on\r\nginger-nuts and doughnuts, and affy-davy’s, and street openings. Did I\r\nsay better?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—I dont care a dam if you did.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—If the devil were here, you would not dare talk thus.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—The devil is hard by, and you fear his claws, and dare not\r\noppose his will.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Dare not?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—No.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—What! dare not oppose the devil?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—What I have said, I have said.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—If you trifle too much with my liver, dam me if I don’t kick\r\nyou, and give you a black eye.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—I dare you to try it. I scout your threats, Charley, for I’m\r\nfortified so strongly through my supposed integrity, that they pass\r\nby me like incarcerated wind, which I can resist with a penny fan,\r\nor potato popgun. I did send to you for the legitimate keys of the\r\nStreet Commissioner, which you refused me, for I despise false keys. By\r\nJuno, I would sell all the paint, and oil, and glass, and putty in my\r\nfactory to the city, at a good price, before I would use false keys,\r\nor bamboozle the dear people, who think me so honest, and love me so\r\nintensely. I sent to you for the keys of Peter and Edward, which you\r\ndenied me. Did not Charley err in that? Would I have treated Charley\r\nso? When Daniel is so mean as to refuse the keys of Blackwell’s Island\r\nto his Charley, be ready, Branch, with all your bombs, and dash out his\r\nhonest and tender brains.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—I denied you not. It’s a dam lie.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—I swear you did.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—I did not. I gave the keys to the Turn-key, and told him to\r\nbring them to you. O! Daniel hath rent my liver, who should overlook my\r\ntrivial faults, and not magnify them so hugely.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—I do, until you exaggerate my little peccadillos.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Daniel hates me.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—I dislike your didos.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—None but an owl could discern my tricks.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—An alligator would not, unless he were hungry, and Charley was\r\nin a tree.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Come, Whiting, and young Conover, come, and revenge\r\nyourselves on Charley, who is weary of this wicked world. Hooted by\r\nthe people, and braved by a Mayor, and checked like a forger, and all\r\nhis thefts detected, and found in a note-book, and recited and sung by\r\nrote, and thrown into my very jaws—O! I could cry like a crocodile,\r\nuntil my eyes were balls of blood and fire. There’s my keys, and razor,\r\nand scissors, and here’s my yearning belly. Within, a liver, and\r\nbladder, and frogs, and kidneys, and tripe, and sausages, tenderer than\r\nmy heart, itself, which nought but worms can ever conquer. If thou are\r\nnot a bogus Mayor, or cunning spoilsman, apply thy scissors, and pluck\r\nthem out, and appease thy insatiate palate. I, that denied thee keys,\r\nwill yield my entrails. Strike, as thou didst at poor Branch’s claim,\r\nfor I do know, that when thou didst hate him worst, thou lov’dst him\r\nbetter than ever thou didst Charley.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Sheathe your scissors. Be waspish when you please,—you shall\r\nhave sea-room. Be tricky when you will,—I’ll call it fun. O Charley!\r\nYou are like Father Peter, who carries lightning as a withered limb\r\nbears fire,—who, tightly squeezed, shows a hasty flash, and straight\r\nis coal again.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—Hath Charley toiled, and sweat, and groaned, and grunted all\r\nhis days, to be the scoff and derision of his Daniel, when clouds and\r\nsorrows fret him?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—When I derided the honest Charley, I had the dyspepsia most\r\nhorribly, with a touch of Peter’s chronic piles.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—O ginger-snaps! Do you acknowledge so much corn? Give me\r\nyour fist.\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Take it, with its nails and knuckles.\r\n\r\n_Charley_—O, Daniel!\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—What’s the matter, Charley?\r\n\r\n_Charley_—I hear the echo clank of a culprit’s chains, and I almost\r\nfeel the hangman’s halter round my neck. And have you not gizzard\r\nenough to forgive me, when that rash humor which the people gave me,\r\nmakes me savage and forgetful?\r\n\r\n_Mayor_—Yes, Charley, and henceforth, when you are over-savage with\r\nyour Daniel, and refuse the keys to gilded treasure, and strive to rob\r\nhis brother Edward, and Father Peter of a million spoils, he’ll say\r\nthat only\r\n\r\n  Horace can deride,\r\n  And black people chide,\r\n  And he’ll let you slide\r\n  Down the rapid tide\r\n  Into the grassy dell,\r\n  Near the borders of——\r\n  Where the first sinners fell,\r\n  And where contractors dwell,\r\n  And all who truth do sell,\r\n  So, Charley, fare thee well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n  In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n  States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith John, James, and Wesley Harper’s permission, I returned to\r\nProvidence, and went with Smith & Parmenter, who published the\r\n“_Literary Cadet and Rhode Island Statesman_,” whose editor was the\r\nhandsome and talented Sylvester S. Southworth, now editor of the “_New\r\nYork Mercury_.” Samuel J. Smith courted Miss McBride, a beautiful\r\nactress, who extended her hand behind her for sewing silk, when her\r\nsister penetrated and broke a needle in the palm or rear of her hand,\r\nand she died in two days of lockjaw. I attended her funeral, and so\r\npiercing were her lover’s cries, and so mournful was the general scene,\r\nthat I had to join the mighty throng in the universal lamentation.\r\nAfter the coffin was lowered, and the first spade of earth imparted\r\nits thrilling reverberation, he became frantic, and leaped into the\r\ngrave, and strove to remove the lid, amid the horror of the vast\r\nassemblage. In those early years, as now, I was extremely susceptible,\r\nand as nature’s evening mantle was closing its sombre folds around\r\nus,—and, as the extraordinary spectacle of the enthusiastic lover had\r\nthrilled and chilled me to the soul, I departed for my abode, amid\r\nthe overwhelming cries of a desolate man, who soon sold his interest\r\nin the “_Statesman_,” and published the “_News_,” which was the first\r\nSunday journal established in New York. I went with John Miller, of\r\nthe _Providence Journal_, with Hugh Brown, who printed the Providence\r\nDirectory—with Mr. Congdon, of New Bedford,—with Beales & Homer, of\r\nthe _Boston Gazette_,—with Mr. Eldridge, of the _Hamden Whig_, of\r\nSpringfield,—with John Russell, of the _Hartford Times_,—with Charles\r\nKing, of the _New York American_, whose publisher was D. K. Minor,—-\r\nwith Michael Burnham, of the _New York Evening Post_, whose editors\r\nwere William Cullen Bryant and William Leggett, whose fervent nature\r\nand jovial risibles I can never forget,—with Thomas Kite, a stingy\r\nQuaker, of Philadelphia, who would not pay me for the fat matter, and\r\nwhen he became so bold as to plunder the title and two blank pages, I\r\npulled off his wig, and run for my life, with Tommy after me, but my\r\nfleetness vanquished, and I kept his wig,—with Francis Preston Blair,\r\nof the _Washington Globe_, whose publisher was Wm. Greer. I now learned\r\nof the sudden death of Charles Manton, of Providence, whom I had most\r\nfondly loved since rosy childhood, whose demise cast a gloom over my\r\nheart which has never been effaced. I left Washington for Philadelphia\r\nin 1830, and took a room with Edward Dodge, with whom I had been a\r\nschoolmate in Providence, and who is now a distinguished banker of\r\nWall street, with whose recent misfortunes I strongly sympathize. I\r\nnow receive a letter from father, requesting my immediate return to\r\nProvidence, and on my arrival, he introduced me to James Fenner, the\r\nGovernor of Rhode Island, and to Gen. Edward J. Mallett, the Postmaster\r\nof Providence, who married Gov. Fenner’s daughter. I became a clerk\r\nin the Post-office, at $400 per annum. [Gen. Mallett’s second wife\r\nwas a widow of the affluent Haight family, of this city, and he was\r\nthe President of the St. Nicholas Bank.—He has just been appointed\r\nby President Buchanan, Commercial Agent to Florence, where he will\r\nprobably die, as he is tottering in the bleak evening of life.] I\r\nhad borrowed money from Israel Post, of New York, before I went to\r\nWashington, and when he learned that I was a clerk in the Post-office,\r\nhe demanded payment, and threatened to write to Gen. Mallett, if I\r\ndid not immediately cancel his claim. I wrote him that I would pay\r\nhim from my salary. He replied, that he would not wait. His letters\r\nwere exciting, and fearing he would write an extravagant letter to\r\nGen. Mallett, and perhaps effect my dismissal, I took the money from\r\nthe till, and inclosed it in a letter, and as I was about to seal and\r\nmail it, Captain Bunker’s admonitions, and my father’s kindness in\r\nprocuring my clerkship, and my horror of a thief, caused me to forbear,\r\namid tears of joy at my victory over the demon of dishonor. Although\r\nthis transpired in the Post-office at midnight, and although I boarded\r\nnear the Post-office, which was a mile from father’s, yet I went home,\r\nagainst a winter’s tempest, and aroused him from his slumber, and told\r\nhim of the horrors of my position. He stood before me in robes of\r\nwhiteness, like a Roman statue, and when I told him that I had taken\r\nand instantly restored the money to the till, big drops rolled from\r\nhis cavern eyes in exhaustless profusion, and after pacing the room in\r\nutter silence, he halted and said:—“Stephen, my dear son, in early\r\nyears, you were dishonest, and I feared you were so now. But your\r\nfirmness and integrity on this occasion, gladden my heart more than I\r\ncan evince in language. It is midnight, and a storm rages with terrific\r\nfury, and I hope you will remain at home to-night, and in the morning\r\nyou shall have the means to cancel the claim of Mr. Post. Take the\r\nlamp and retire, Stephen, and you will go to your repose with my most\r\nfervent blessing.” And as I was about to go, with his hand upon the\r\nlatch, he gazed, and lingered, and hesitated, and advanced and embraced\r\nme as never before, and while he kissed my forehead, his copious and\r\nburning tears rolled down my pallid cheeks. We parted in silence, as\r\nneither could speak. I arose early, and went to the Post-office,\r\nand before meridian, father gave me the money, which I sent to Mr.\r\nPost, which made me the happiest being in Providence. The students of\r\nBrown University daily came for letters, with some of whom I formed\r\nthe warmest friendship, and I soon discovered my superficiality\r\nthrough their superior intelligence, and I resolved to emerge from the\r\nignorance and superstition that beclouded my intellect, and made me\r\nunhappy. I studied Greek and Latin very hard during my leisure hours,\r\nand recited to Hartshorn, Farnsworth, and Gay, and made rapid advances.\r\nThe clerks became jealous soon after I embarked in my intellectual\r\nenterprise, and strove to prejudice Gen. Mallett against me, assuring\r\nhim that I did not come to the office early in the morning, and let\r\nthem go to breakfast, although I hastened to the office immediately\r\nafter I closed my morning meal, and sometimes without it, to please\r\nthe clerks. They also told him that I studied during office hours, and\r\nneglected those who called for letters. Gen. Mallett believed their\r\nfallacious accusations, and often severely denounced me, and I left\r\nthe Post-office, with the approbation of my father, and began the\r\nstudy of law with Gen. Thomas F. Carpenter, one of the most eminent\r\nlawyers of Rhode Island, and a man of noble nature. Gen. Mallett soon\r\nrequested me to return, by direction of Gov. Fenner, who was the\r\nconstant personal and political friend of my father more than forty\r\nyears. I returned, but the clerks again conspired, and apparently\r\ngave Mallett no peace—although I learned that Mallett himself, if\r\nnot their instigator, was, at least, their fellow conspirator, which\r\naroused a hundred tigers in my breast. The clerks adduced another batch\r\nof colored charges, and Mallett belched a scathing phillippic, when I\r\nsprang like a panther at his throat, and gently squeezed and hugged\r\nhim like a bear, until he showed his lying and vituperating tongue,\r\nand rolled his phrenzied eyes, when he made a superhuman effort, and\r\neluded my nails and fingers, and fled into his private office, whither\r\nI pursued him. My father was in the printing office of Wm. Simons on\r\nthe floor above, and hearing my blows and awful anathema of Mallett,\r\nand scratches, and gouges, and wild cat screeches and echos, he rushed\r\ndown stairs, and into the private office of Mallett, and locked the\r\ndoor, and put the key in his pocket, to conceal us from the public\r\ngaze; and after a desperate conflict, he dragged me from Mallett, who\r\nthen seized the poker, and run behind the stove and wood and coal box.\r\nWhile father held, and strove to calm me, Mallett feared I would get\r\nloose, and suspended one leg from the window, and asked father if he\r\nhad not better leap to the ground. Father told him that he might break\r\nhis neck or legs, and that he would strive to hold me until my anger\r\nwas allayed. My eyes glared like Forrest’s in one of his terrible\r\nrevenges, and my tongue projected, and mouth foamed, and my cheeks and\r\nlips were of deathly pallor, and I had the strength of a small panther,\r\nand father exclaimed: “Why, Stephen, don’t you know me? I am your\r\nfather,—and won’t you recognise me, and heed my friendly counsel? It\r\nis the familiar voice of your father that appeals for your restoration\r\nto serenity. Do, I implore you, tranquilise your nerves, and appease\r\nyour fearful wrath, and allay your deadly fury, and gratify your aged\r\nfather, who always loved you.” I faltered and gazed around, and as my\r\nwild and fatal eye balls rested on Mallett, he again cries out: “Judge\r\nBranch: Don’t you really think I had better jump out of the window?”\r\nFather said: “No, I guess not. Stephen will soon abjure his dreadful\r\nanger, and be himself again.” He then bathed my temples, and stroked my\r\ncurly hair and fanned my fevered cheeks, and I slowly emerged from my\r\nprotracted aberration, and took a seat, and father unlocked the door,\r\nand Mallett darted out like a cat from a dark closet, and scaled the\r\nstairs with a solitary stride, and I returned home with father. Gov.\r\nFenner truly loved me, and deeply regretted the sad intelligence of\r\nthe quarrel, and on the following day insisted on my immediate return\r\nto the Post Office, and threatened to kick Mallett and all the clerks\r\ninto the street, because they had long plotted such infamous mischief\r\nto get me out of the office, and to effect, if possible, my earthly\r\nruin. I sincerely thanked the Governor for his friendly feelings, and\r\nassured him that I could not return and dwell with happiness among\r\nsuch a gang of miserable wretches, when he honored me with an elegant\r\ndonation, and expressed the warmest desire for my future welfare. Gov.\r\nFenner told me, in the presence of my father, that he would request\r\nGen. Jackson to remove his son-in-law as Post Master, if he did not\r\ninstantly hurl every clerk into the street, who had conspired against\r\nme. But my father and myself besought the noble Governor to commit no\r\nrashness, as it would be impossible to conduct the affairs of the Post\r\nOffice, in the sudden absence of all the experienced clerks. I then\r\nshook the Governor’s throbbing hands, and, as we parted, I am quite\r\nsure I saw a tear fall from his venerable and intellectual eyes, and I\r\nknow that grateful and hallowed waters fell like equator rain from my\r\npensive vision. I left for Andover, and entered Phillips’ Academy, in\r\nthe Greek and Latin classes, where I formed a devoted friendship with\r\nWin. Augustus White, who was a poor youth, and a beneficiary of the\r\nEducation Society, and who is now an Episcopal minister in Maryland.\r\nI left Andover for Boston, and caught the itch from a filthy bed at\r\na hotel in Washington street. I went to Cambridge, and entered the\r\nlaw school of Judge Story and Professor Greenleaf. A law student from\r\nProvidence asked me to gamble, and I won about $20 in cash, and he\r\ndenounced me, because I would not gamble with him after he had lost all\r\nhe had, and owed me $50. I told him that persons seldom paid gambling\r\ndebts, and I could not stake cash against credit in a game of cards.\r\nI also told him that I would return the $20 I had won, and give him\r\nthe $50 he owed me, if he would never ask me to gamble, when he flew\r\ninto a fearful passion, and said I grossly insulted him. He strove\r\nto irritate me to blows, and I anticipated a scuffle, but he did not\r\ndare strike me, as he doubtless saw fatality and a pale sepulchre in\r\nmy eyes. We had known each other nearly all our days, but dice and\r\ncards separated us for ever, and he is in the grave. News arrived at\r\nCambridge of the great fire of 1835, and I went to New York, to see\r\nmy brothers, and the desolation, and proceeded to Philadelphia, but\r\nmy itch increased, and I returned with forced cars to Cambridge, and\r\nconsulted Dr. Plympton, who gave me ointment, which I applied, and the\r\nitch suddenly disappeared, and commingled with my blood, and raised\r\nBeelzebub with my emotions. I felt cold, and made a rousing fire, and\r\nwent to bed, and had a violent perspiration, and out popped the itch\r\nagain like a porpoise, and made me scratch so hard and incessantly,\r\nthat I could not sleep of nights, and I was in a horrible predicament,\r\nand I got alarmed, and went to Providence, and immediately to bed, as\r\nmy physical energies were utterly exhausted, from loss of rest, and\r\nfrom my eternal scratching, and off I went into a thundering snore. My\r\nbrother William arrived from New York during the night, and got into my\r\nbed, and I slept so soundly that he vainly strove to awake me. I told\r\nhim in the morning that I had the itch, and he laughed heartily, and\r\nI tried to join him, but I could not. He soon returned to New York,\r\nand I to Cambridge, and in about a month, he wrote me that he had got\r\nthe itch, and asked me what he should do to cure it. I told him to\r\napply itch ointment externally, and to gently scratch the developments,\r\nor they would increase like fury, or a snow ball. He then wrote me\r\nthat itch pimples had appeared between his fingers, and on the back\r\nof his hands, and desired to know what to do to screen them, or cure\r\nthem quickly, and spare the mortification. I told him to wear gloves\r\nor mittens constantly as I did, and to pretend that he was learning\r\nthe art of self-defence, and went to a boxing school so often that it\r\nbegan to seem natural to wear gloves or mittens without cessation, or\r\nthrough absence of mind. Brother Bill never troubled me again about\r\nhis itch, and I was glad, as I did not like to commune of itch, even\r\nthrough correspondence with a brother, as my own itch required my\r\nunremitting attention. The students often asked me why I scratched my\r\nlegs and back so much, and why I always had pimples in the rear of\r\nmy hands, and between my fingers, and on my knuckles, and why I wore\r\nboxing gloves so much. I told them that I had the salt rheum that my\r\ndear mother gave me. I went to Andover, in a sleigh, with a student\r\nnamed Terry, who had a sweetheart in the suburbs of the town, with whom\r\nhe lingered until late in the evening. On our return to Cambridge, we\r\ngot lost in the woods, at midnight, and came near freezing. In our\r\nemergence from the forest, and while sharply turning a corner of the\r\ncountry road, we upset, and both were thrown with great violence, on\r\nthe uneven snow and ice. Terry fell on his prominent, though handsome\r\nnose. The night was dark, and his hands were numb, and on applying his\r\nfingers to his nose, he could not feel it, and thought it had frozen,\r\nand broken, and gone, as blood flowed freely from where his nose ought\r\nto be, and once was, and in abject despair, (for Terry dearly loved his\r\nnose,) he exclaimed: “Branch! where are you?” “I am here.” “Well, do\r\ncome here, for the Lord’s sake.” “What’s the matter, Terry?” “Branch,\r\ncan you see my nose?” “No. It is so dark, I cannot see you. Where are\r\nyou, Terry?” “Here.” We then found each other, and he besought me,\r\nin touching accents, to feel for his nose, and I did, and told him\r\nthat I feared his nose was gone, as I could not feel it, nor could I,\r\nbecause my arms and fingers were so numb. Poor Terry wept bitterly,\r\nwhile I laughed into smothered hysterics. We got into the sleigh, and\r\noff we went towards Cambridge, with Terry moaning over the loss of his\r\nnose, and I laughing through the disguise of a cough or sneeze. On our\r\narrival at his College room, I struck a match, and Terry rushed for the\r\nglass, and lo! his mangled nose was there, gleaming and streaming with\r\nicicles of blood, and the pale liquid of nature. He made a fire, and\r\nbathed his wounds, and melted his nosy icicles, and jumped and hopped\r\nand leaped with unwonted ecstacy. The previous cold and sudden heat of\r\nTerry’s fire irritated my itch, and I wanted to scratch my pimples, but\r\ndared not in Terry’s presence, and I put on my coat to go to my college\r\napartment, to bathe my body with itch ointment. But Terry wanted me to\r\nsleep with him. He had a large feather bed, and the fire was blazing,\r\nand I was sure I would get into a perspiration, and give him the itch\r\nif I slept with him. So I declined. But he insisted, and locked the\r\nroom, and hid the key. What to do I did not know. I dared not tell him\r\nI had the itch, but told him that I must go to my room, and get my\r\nlessons for the morrow, to which he would not listen. I had not applied\r\nointment for fifteen hours, and I was anxious to do so that night, and\r\nmade a warm appeal to Terry to unlock the door, but he would not. He\r\nthen made some warm punch, and displayed his crackers, cheese, apples,\r\ncake, and segars, and firmly declared that if I did not sleep with him,\r\nhe would never speak to me again. So I had to stop, and we went to bed,\r\nwhen he proposed to snuggle up a little before we went to sleep, and\r\nI had to let him do it. But the cold had made him sleepy, and he soon\r\nturned over, and away he departed in a roaring sleep, to my infinite\r\ndelight, as the punch and crackling fire had caused my pimples to itch\r\nhorribly for two hours, and I could only slyly and gently scratch them\r\nwhile he was awake. So I went at them with my long nails, which I had\r\ncultivated for scratching, and I soon made the pimples smart and bleed\r\ninstead of itch, which afforded me the same relief that an eel obtains\r\nin his desperate leap from the pan into the lurid coals. The college\r\nbell aroused Terry early, but not me, as I was already aroused, not\r\nhaving closed my eyes, though I pretended (out of compliment to Terry’s\r\nnice punch and feather bed,) to have had the most delightful repose.\r\nSo we arose, and clad ourselves, and combed our hair, and brushed our\r\nteeth, and Terry let me out, and I departed for a two hour’s communion\r\nwith itch ointment. In about three weeks, while Terry was telling a\r\nmost comical story to myself and some students in his room, he suddenly\r\nstopped, and made a desperate grab at the calf of his left leg, which\r\nhe scratched like a cross and sick hen, in pursuit of food for her\r\nhungry chickens, until I thought he would tear his pantaloons. Terry\r\nscratched so hard and long that he excited one of the students, who\r\nbegun to scratch his head, and asked him if he ever discovered fleas in\r\nhis room. Terry looked indignant, and ceased scratching, and continued\r\nhis story. Presently he made a lunge for the other leg, higher up.\r\nThe students stared at Terry, and looked extremely solicitous towards\r\neach other, and two left very suddenly. Terry closed his story, and\r\nthe other students left, leaving myself and Terry, who hauled up his\r\npantaloons, and exclaimed: “Why, Branch, I think I must have fleas,\r\nfor, good God, just look at my legs, they are covered with pimples,\r\nand they itch most awfully.” I inquired if a dog had been in his room\r\nrecently, to which he negatively responded. I then said: “Perhaps you\r\nhave not got fleas, but the itch.” He instantly straightened himself,\r\nand looking me dead in the eye, said: “Branch: If I had the itch, I\r\nthink I would commit suicide.” I replied: “That would be\r\n\r\n  (To be continued to our last groan.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following meritorious gentlemen are wholesale agents for the\r\nAlligator.\r\n\r\n  Ross & Tousey, 121 Nassau street.\r\n  Hamilton & Johnson, 22 Ann street.\r\n  Samuel Yates, 22 Beekman street.\r\n  Mike Madden, 21 Ann street.\r\n  Cauldwell & Long, 23 Ann street.\r\n  Boyle &, Whalen, 32 Ann street and\r\n  Bell & Hendrickson, 25 Ann street.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisements—One Dollar a line\r\n\r\nIN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS\r\n  IN THE\r\n  PICAYUNE.\r\n\r\n  You are sincerely warned not to look at THE PICAYUNE.\r\n\r\n  AVOID THE PICAYUNE!\r\n\r\n  SHUN THE PICAYUNE!\r\n\r\n  Or if you must have it, STEAL it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  P.
