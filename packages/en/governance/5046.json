But it is a matter of historic record.\r\n\r\nBut from this podium, Winston Churchill asked the free world to stand\r\ntogether against the onslaught of aggression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt\r\nspoke of a day of infamy and summoned a nation to arms. Douglas MacArthur\r\nmade an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and served so well.\r\nDwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of\r\nstrength. And John F. Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited this Chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington, critical\r\nof past policies which I believed had failed, I proposed a new spirit of\r\npartnership between this Congress and this administration and between\r\nWashington and our State and local governments. In forging this new\r\npartnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of our\r\nRepublic--prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the blessings\r\nof individual liberty for our children and, someday, for all of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in\r\nour relations with other nations, on the foundation we've carefully laid\r\nfor our economic recovery, and finally, on a bold and spirited initiative\r\nthat I believe can change the face of American government and make it again\r\nthe servant of the people.\r\n\r\nSeldom have the stakes been higher for America. What we do and say here\r\nwill make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit, lumberjacks in the\r\nNorthwest, steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment lines;\r\nto black teenagers in Newark and Chicago; to hard-pressed farmers and small\r\nbusinessmen; and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor the simple\r\nwish of a safe and financially secure future for their children. To\r\nunderstand the state of the Union, we must look not only at where we are\r\nand where we're going but where we've been. The situation at this time last\r\nyear was truly ominous.\r\n\r\nThe last decade has seen a series of recessions. There was a recession in\r\n1970, in 1974, and again in the spring of 1980. Each time, unemployment\r\nincreased and inflation soon turned up again. We coined the word\r\n\"stagflation\" to describe this.\r\n\r\nGovernment's response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply\r\nand increase spending. In the last 6 months of 1980, as an example, the\r\nmoney supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar history--13 percent.\r\nInflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased at\r\nan annual rate of 17 percent. Interest rates reached a staggering 21.5\r\npercent. There were 8 million unemployed.\r\n\r\nLate in 1981 we sank into the present recession, largely because continued\r\nhigh interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction. And there was\r\na drop in productivity, and the already high unemployment increased.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, things are different. We have an economic program in\r\nplace, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past. It\r\ncalls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, and\r\nalready that rate has been cut nearly in half. But reduced spending the\r\nfirst and smallest phase of a 3-year tax rate reduction designed to\r\nstimulate the economy and create jobs. Already interest rates are down to\r\n15 3/4 percent, but they must still go lower. Inflation is down from 12.4\r\npercent to 8.9, and for the month of December it was running at an\r\nannualized rate of 5.2 percent. If we had not acted as we did, things would\r\nbe far worse for all Americans than they are today. Inflation, taxes, and\r\ninterest rates would all be higher.\r\n\r\nA year ago, Americans' faith in their governmental process was steadily\r\ndeclining. Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic about\r\ntheir future. A new kind of defeatism was heard. Some said our domestic\r\nproblems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with this\r\nseemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment.\r\n\r\nThere were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our\r\nadministration and this Congress. It was said we could never work together.\r\nWell, those predictions were wrong. The record is clear, and I believe that\r\nhistory will remember this as an era of American renewal, remember this\r\nadministration as an administration of change, and remember this Congress\r\nas a Congress of destiny.\r\n\r\nTogether, we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in\r\nhalf, we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweeping\r\nchanges in our tax structure since the beginning of this century. And\r\nbecause we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation, we took away\r\ngovernment's built-in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to grow\r\nlarger at the expense of American workers.\r\n\r\nTogether, after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the people\r\nin their States and local communities, we have started returning power and\r\nresources to them.\r\n\r\nTogether, we have cut the growth of new Federal regulations nearly in half.\r\nIn 1981 there were 23,000 fewer pages in the Federal Register, which lists\r\nnew regulations, than there were in 1980. By deregulating oil we've come\r\ncloser to achieving energy independence and helped bring down the cost of\r\ngasoline and heating fuel.\r\n\r\nTogether, we have created an effective Federal strike force to combat waste\r\nand fraud in government. In just 6 months it has saved the taxpayers more\r\nthan $2 billion, and it's only getting started.\r\n\r\nTogether we've begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicate\r\nwasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands of\r\nAmericans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America's social\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nTogether we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures\r\npeace. Our country's uniform is being worn once again with pride.\r\n\r\nTogether we have made a New Beginning, but we have only begun.\r\n\r\nNo one pretends that the way ahead will be easy. In my Inaugural Address\r\nlast year, I warned that the \"ills we suffer have come upon us over several\r\ndecades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go\r\naway . . . because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had it\r\nin the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and\r\ngreatest bastion of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThe economy will face difficult moments in the months ahead. But the\r\nprogram for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out of\r\nits slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the\r\nlatter half of this year. And that is why I can report to you tonight that\r\nin the near future the state of the Union and the economy will be\r\nbetter--much better--if we summon the strength to continue on the course\r\nthat we've charted.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the question: If the fundamentals are in place, what now? Well, two\r\nthings. First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the\r\neconomy. Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program\r\nthat's only just now getting underway, as some would have you believe; they\r\nare the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend.\r\n\r\nSecond, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not\r\nrespond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integrated\r\nplan for recovery. That plan is based on four commonsense fundamentals:\r\ncontinued reduction of the growth in Federal spending; preserving the\r\nindividual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving and\r\ninvestment; removing unnecessary Federal regulations to spark productivity;\r\nand maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy, the latter a\r\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve System.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to\r\nthe policies that gave us a trillion-dollar debt, runaway inflation,\r\nrunaway interest rates and unemployment. The doubters would have us turn\r\nback the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate\r\nreductions already passed by this Congress. Raise present taxes to cut\r\nfuture deficits, they tell us. Well, I don't believe we should buy that\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nThere are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or\r\nsurpluses several years ahead with any degree of accuracy. The budget in\r\nplace, when I took office, had been projected as balanced. It turned out to\r\nhave one of the biggest deficits in history. Another example of the\r\nimponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable--a\r\nchange of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up\r\nor down by some $25 billion.\r\n\r\nAs it now stands, our forecast, which we're required by law to make, will\r\nshow major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars and\r\ndeclining, but still too high. More important, we're making progress with\r\nthe three keys to reducing deficits: economic growth, lower interest rates,\r\nand spending control. The policies we have in place will reduce the deficit\r\nsteadily, surely, and in time, completely.\r\n\r\nHigher taxes would not mean lower deficits. If they did, how would we\r\nexplain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976; yet in that\r\nsame 6-year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history. In\r\n1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion, and in 1980 we had one of our\r\nall-time biggest deficits. Raising taxes won't balance the budget; it will\r\nencourage more government spending and less private investment. Raising\r\ntaxes will slow economic growth, reduce production, and destroy future\r\njobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and more\r\nlikely that those who now have jobs could lose them. So, I will not ask you\r\nto try to balance the budget on the backs of the American taxpayers.\r\n\r\nI will seek no tax increases this year, and I have no intention of\r\nretreating from our basic program of tax relief. I promise to bring the\r\nAmerican people--to bring their tax rates down and to keep them down, to\r\nprovide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in\r\nAmerica's future. I will stand by my word. Tonight I'm urging the American\r\npeople: Seize these new opportunities to produce, to save, to invest, and\r\ntogether we'll make this economy a mighty engine of freedom, hope, and\r\nprosperity again.\r\n\r\nNow, the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations. The\r\nrecession did that. It lowered revenues and increased costs. To some\r\nextent, we're also victims of our own success. We've brought inflation down\r\nfaster than we thought we could, and in doing this, we've deprived\r\ngovernment of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes people\r\ninto higher income tax brackets. And the continued high interest rates last\r\nyear cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more\r\nwaste, and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employees\r\nin the Federal work force by 75,000.\r\n\r\nThe budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major savings\r\nby dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education and by eliminating\r\nineffective subsidies for business. We'll continue to redirect our\r\nresources to our two highest budget priorities--a strong national defense\r\nto keep America free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social\r\nprograms for those who have contributed and those who are in need.\r\n\r\nContrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this\r\nadministration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly or\r\nAmerica's poor. Under the new budget, funding for social insurance programs\r\nwill be more than double the amount spent only 6 years ago. But it would be\r\nfoolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient\r\nand economical.\r\n\r\nThe entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy\r\nhave worthy goals and many deserving recipients. We will protect them. But\r\nthere's only one way to see to it that these programs really help those\r\nwhom they were designed to help. And that is to bring their spiraling costs\r\nunder control.\r\n\r\nToday we face the absurd situation of a Federal budget with three-quarters\r\nof its expenditures routinely referred to as \"uncontrollable.\" And a large\r\npart of this goes to entitlement programs.\r\n\r\nCommittee after committee of this Congress has heard witness after witness\r\ndescribe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife with waste\r\nand fraud. Virtually every American who shops in a local supermarket is\r\naware of the daily abuses that take place in the food stamp program, which\r\nhas grown by 16,000 percent in the last 15 years. Another example is\r\nMedicare and Medicaid--programs with worthy goals but whose costs have\r\nincreased from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion, more than 5 times as\r\nmuch, in just 10 years.\r\n\r\nWaste and fraud are serious problems. Back in 1980 Federal investigators\r\ntestified before one of your committees that \"corruption has permeated\r\nvirtually every area of the Medicare and Medicaid health care industry.\"\r\nOne official said many of the people who are cheating the system were \"very\r\nconfident that nothing was going to happen to them.\" Well, something is\r\ngoing to happen. Not only the taxpayers are defrauded; the people with real\r\ndependency on these programs are deprived of what they need, because\r\navailable resources are going not to the needy, but to the greedy.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to control the uncontrollable. In August we made a start.\r\nI signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44 billion over\r\nthe next 3 years while at the same time preserving essential services for\r\nthe truly needy. Shortly you will receive from me a message on further\r\nreforms we intend to install--some new, but others long recommended by your\r\nown congressional committees. I ask you to help make these savings for the\r\nAmerican taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some $63 billion\r\nover 4 Years and will, without affecting social t security, go a long way\r\ntoward bringing Federal spending under control.\r\n\r\nBut don't be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive\r\nthe elderly, the needy, and the helpless. The. Federal Government will\r\nstill subsidize 95 million meals every day. That's one out of seven of all\r\nthe meals served in America. Head Start, senior nutrition programs, and\r\nchild welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed last\r\nyear. More than one-half billion dollars has been proposed for minority\r\nbusiness assistance. And research at the National Institute of Health will\r\nbe increased by over $100 million. While meeting all these needs, we intend\r\nto plug unwarranted tax loopholes and strengthen the law which requires all\r\nlarge corporations to pay a minimum tax.\r\n\r\nI am confident the economic program we've put into operation will protect\r\nthe needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all Americans. It\r\nwill stimulate the economy, result in increased savings and provide capital\r\nfor expansion, mortgages for homebuilding, and jobs for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nNow that the essentials of that program are in place, our next major\r\nundertaking must be a program--just as bold, just as innovative--to make\r\ngovernment again accountable to the people, to make our system of\r\nfederalism work again.\r\n\r\nOur citizens feel they've lost control of even the most basic decisions\r\nmade about the essential services of government, such as schools, welfare,\r\nroads, and even garbage collection. And they're right. A maze of\r\ninterlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average\r\ncitizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems. They don't know\r\nwhere to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise, who to\r\nblame, who to vote for or against. The main reason for this is the\r\noverpowering growth of Federal grants-in-aid programs during the past few\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\nIn 1960 the Federal Government had 132 categorical grant programs, costing\r\n$7 billion. When I took office, there were approximately 500, costing\r\nnearly a hundred billion dollars--13 programs for energy, 36 for pollution\r\ncontrol, 66 for social services, 90 for education. And here in the\r\nCongress, it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYou know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can\r\nproperly oversee this jungle of grants-in-aid; indeed, the growth of these\r\ngrants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government. As\r\none Democratic Governor put it recently: The National Government should be\r\nworrying about \"arms control, not potholes.\"\r\n\r\nThe growth in these Federal programs has--in the words of one\r\nintergovernmental commission--made the Federal Government \"more pervasive,\r\nmore intrusive, more unmanageable, more ineffective and costly, and above\r\nall, more (un) accountable.\" Let's solve this problem with a single, bold\r\nstroke: the return of some $47 billion in Federal programs to State and\r\nlocal government, together with the means to finance them and a transition\r\nperiod of nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption.\r\n\r\nI will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program. I want\r\nto emphasize, however, that its full details will have been worked out only\r\nafter close consultation with congressional, State, and local officials.\r\n\r\nStarting in fiscal 1984, the Federal Government will assume full\r\nresponsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to go\r\nalong with its existing responsibility for Medicare. As part of a\r\nfinancially equal swap, the States will simultaneously take full\r\nresponsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps.\r\nThis will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need,\r\nbecause it'll be designed and administered closer to the grass roots and\r\nthe people it serves.\r\n\r\nIn 1984 the Federal Government will apply the full proceeds from certain\r\nexcise taxes to a grass roots trust fund that will belong in fair shares to\r\nthe 50 States. The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28 billion\r\na year. Over the next 4 years the States can use this money in either of\r\ntwo ways. If they want to continue receiving Federal grants in such areas\r\nas transportation, education, and social services, they can use their trust\r\nfund money to pay for the grants. Or to the extent they choose to forgo the\r\nFederal grant programs, they can use their trust fund money on their own\r\nfor those or other purposes. There will be a mandatory pass-through of part\r\nof these funds to local governments.\r\n\r\nBy 1988 the States will be in complete control of over 40 Federal grant\r\nprograms. The trust fund will start to phase out, eventually to disappear,\r\nand the excise taxes will be turned over to the States. They can then\r\npreserve, lower, or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage these\r\nprograms as they see fit.\r\n\r\nIn a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end\r\ncumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the Federal level while we\r\nensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they're\r\nmeant to help and the people who pay for them.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility\r\nof State and local governments, we're proposing legislation for an\r\nexperimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the\r\n1980's and '90's. This legislation will permit States and localities to\r\napply to the Federal Government for designation as urban enterprise zones.\r\nA broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attract\r\nnew business, new jobs, new opportunity to America's inner cities and rural\r\ntowns. Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise. Well, I say we\r\nmust free enterprise so that together we can save America.\r\n\r\nSome will also say our States and local communities are not up to the\r\nchallenge of a new and creative partnership. Well, that might have been\r\ntrue 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the Voting Rights\r\nAct, the 10-year extension of which I strongly support. It's no longer true\r\ntoday. This administration has faith in State and local governments and the\r\nconstitutional balance envisioned by the Founding Fathers. We also believe\r\nin the integrity, decency, and sound, good sense of grass roots Americans.\r\n\r\nOur faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.\r\nOur private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful\r\ncommunity models of school, church, business, union, foundation, and civic\r\nprograms that help community needs. Such groups are almost invariably far\r\nmore efficient than government in running social programs.\r\n\r\nWe're not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government\r\nprograms dollar for dollar, service for service. We just want to help them\r\nperform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their\r\nexample. Three hundred and eighty-five thousand corporations and private\r\norganizations are already working on social programs ranging from drug\r\nrehabilitation to job training, and thousands more Americans have written\r\nus asking how they can help. The volunteer spirit is still alive and well\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nOur nation's long journey towards civil rights for all our citizens--once\r\na source of discord, now a source of pride--must continue with no\r\nbacksliding or slowing down. We must and shall see that those basic laws\r\nthat guarantee equal rights are preserved and, when necessary,\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nOur concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable. We launched\r\na new Task Force on Legal Equity for Women and a Fifty States Project that\r\nwill examine State laws for discriminatory language. And for the first time\r\nin our history, a woman sits on the highest court in the land.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the problem of crime--one as real and deadly serious as any in\r\nAmerica today. It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system,\r\nwhich overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society and\r\nthe innocent victims of crime without justice.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase\r\njobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air. We're encouraged\r\nby the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further\r\nprogress as the Senate continues its deliberations.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've concentrated largely, now, on domestic matters. To view the\r\nstate of the Union in perspective, we must not ignore the rest of the\r\nworld. There isn't time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social--or\r\nforeign policy, I should say, a subject I intend to address in detail in\r\nthe near future. A few words, however, are in order on the progress we've\r\nmade over the past year, reestablishing respect for our nation around the\r\nglobe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in the\r\nyear ahead.\r\n\r\nAt Ottawa and Cancun, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and\r\ndeveloping nations. Now, some of those I met with were a little surprised\r\nthat I didn't apologize for America's wealth. Instead, I spoke of the\r\nstrength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them\r\nrealize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom. I\r\nbelieve lasting friendships were made, and the foundation was laid for\r\nfuture cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn the vital region of the Caribbean Basin, we're developing a program of\r\naid, trade, and investment incentives to promote self-sustaining growth and\r\na better, more secure life for our neighbors to the south. Toward those who\r\nwould export terrorism and subversion in the Caribbean and elsewhere,\r\nespecially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness.\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness, and balance. By\r\nrestoring America's military credibility, by pursuing peace at the\r\nnegotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good\r\nfaith, and by regaining the respect of America's allies and adversaries\r\nalike, we have strengthened our country's position as a force for peace and\r\nprogress in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen action is called for, we're taking it. Our sanctions against the\r\nmilitary dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in\r\nPoland--and against the Soviet regime behind that military\r\ndictatorship--clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not\r\nconduct \"business as usual\" with the forces of oppression. If the events in\r\nPoland continue to deteriorate, further measures will follow.\r\n\r\nNow, let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead in\r\nmaking January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland. So, too,\r\nthe European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an international\r\nday of support for Afghanistan. Well, I urge all peace-loving peoples to\r\njoin together on those days, to raise their voices, to speak and pray for\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as\r\nI announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th. We have\r\nproposed to the Soviet Union a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction of\r\nmilitary forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva\r\non intermediate-range nuclear forces. In those talks it is essential that\r\nwe negotiate from a position of strength. There must be a real incentive\r\nfor the Soviets to take these talks seriously. This requires that we\r\nrebuild our defenses.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade, while we sought the moderation of Soviet power through\r\na process of restraint and accommodation, the Soviets engaged in an\r\nunrelenting buildup of their military forces. The protection of our\r\nnational security has required that we undertake a substantial program to\r\nenhance our military forces.\r\n\r\nWe have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe and\r\nAsia, or to develop key relationships with our partners in the Middle East\r\nand other countries. Building a more peaceful world requires a sound\r\nstrategy and the national resolve to back it up. When radical forces\r\nthreaten our friends, when economic misfortune creates conditions of\r\ninstability, when strategically vital parts of the world fall under the\r\nshadow of Soviet power, our response can make the difference between\r\npeaceful change or disorder and violence. That's why we've laid such stress\r\nnot only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program.\r\nYour recent passage of the Foreign Assistance Act sent a signal to the\r\nworld that America will not shrink from making the investments necessary\r\nfor both peace and security. Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism,\r\nnot naivete or self-delusion.\r\n\r\nA recognition of what the Soviet empire is about is the starting point.\r\nWinston Churchill, in negotiating with the Soviets, observed that they\r\nrespect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations.\r\nThat's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses. We intend to\r\nkeep the peace. We will also keep our freedom.\r\n\r\nWe have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements and\r\nworldwide broadcasts. In the face of a climate of falsehood and\r\nmisinformation, we've promised the world a season of truth--the truth of\r\nour great civilized ideas: individual liberty, representative government,\r\nthe rule of law under God. We've never needed walls or minefields or barbed\r\nwire to keep our people in. Nor do we declare martial law to keep our\r\npeople from voting for the kind of government they want.\r\n\r\nYes, we have our problems; yes, we're in a time of recession. And it's\r\ntrue, there's no quick fix, as I said, to instantly end the tragic pain of\r\nunemployment. But we will end it. The process has already begun, and we'll\r\nsee its effect as the year goes on.\r\n\r\nWe speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who\r\novercame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago. But\r\nour glory didn't end with them. Americans ever since have emulated their\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nWe don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They're all around\r\nus. One who sits among you here tonight epitomized that heroism at the end\r\nof the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our Armed Forces. Who\r\nwill ever forget that night when we waited for television to bring us the\r\nscene of that first plane landing at Clark Field in the Philippines,\r\nbringing our POW's home? The plane door opened and Jeremiah Denton came\r\nslowly down the ramp. He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said, \"God\r\nbless America,\" and then thanked us for bringing him home.\r\n\r\nJust 2 weeks ago, in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac, we saw\r\nagain the spirit of American heroism at its finest--the heroism of\r\ndedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters. And we saw\r\nthe heroism of one of our young government employees, Lenny Skutnik, who,\r\nwhen he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line, dived into the\r\nwater and dragged her to safety.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are countless, quiet, everyday heroes of American who\r\nsacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than\r\nthey've known; church and civic volunteers who help to feed, clothe, nurse,\r\nand teach the needy; millions who've made our nation and our nation's\r\ndestiny so very special--unsung heroes who may not have realized their own\r\ndreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams in their children.\r\nDon't let anyone tell you that America's best days are behind her, that the\r\nAmerican spirit has been vanquished. We've seen it triumph too often in our\r\nlives to stop believing in it now.\r\n\r\nA hundred and twenty years ago, the greatest of all our Presidents\r\ndelivered his second State of the Union message in this Chamber. \"We cannot\r\nescape history,\" Abraham Lincoln warned. \"We of this Congress and this\r\nadministration will be remembered in spite of ourselves.\" The \"trial\r\nthrough which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the\r\nlatest (last) generation.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that President and that Congress did not fail the American people.\r\nTogether they weathered the storm and preserved the Union. Let it be said\r\nof us that we, too, did not fail; that we, too, worked together to bring\r\nAmerica through difficult times. Let us so conduct ourselves that two\r\ncenturies from now, another Congress and another President, meeting in this\r\nChamber as we are meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying that we met\r\nthe test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of\r\nliberty--this last, best hope of man on Earth.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, and thank you.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio\r\nand television.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRonald Reagan\r\nJanuary 25, 1983\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored\r\nguests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nThis solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a President of the United\r\nStates has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington first\r\ndid so in 1790. That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new\r\nthings to say about the State of the Union. The very key to our success has\r\nbeen our ability, foremost among nations, to preserve our lasting values by\r\nmaking change work for us rather than against us.\r\n\r\nI would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do\r\ntogether--not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans--to make\r\ntomorrow's America happy and prosperous at home, strong and respected\r\nabroad, and at peace in the world.\r\n\r\nAs we gather here tonight, the state of our Union is strong, but our\r\neconomy is troubled. For too many of our fellow citizens--farmers, steel and\r\nauto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers--this is a painful\r\nperiod. We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an\r\nend. It has fallen to us, in our time, to undo damage that was a long time\r\nin the making, and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a\r\nbetter future for ourselves and our children.\r\n\r\nWe have a long way to go, but thanks to the courage, patience, and strength\r\nof our people, America is on the mend.\r\n\r\nBut let me give you just one important reason why I believe this--it\r\ninvolves many members of this body.\r\n\r\nJust 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisan\r\nCommission on Social Security accomplished the seemingly impossible. Social\r\nsecurity, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster. I, myself,\r\nhave been talking about this problem for almost 30 years. As 1983 began,\r\nthe system stood on the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim of our\r\neconomic ills. First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as\r\nwe tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living. Then\r\nthe recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wage\r\nbase and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million\r\nAmericans who depend on it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and I performed\r\nthe bipartisan--or formed the bipartisan Commission on Social Security,\r\npundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting\r\ninterests would prevent the Commission from agreeing on a plan to save\r\nsocial security. Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are\r\nwrong. Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the Commission\r\novercame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan. They proved\r\nthat, when it comes to the national welfare, Americans can still pull\r\ntogether for the common good.\r\n\r\nTonight, I'm especially pleased to join with the Speaker and the Senate\r\nmajority leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter.\r\n\r\nThere are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken\r\ntogether it performs a package that all of us can support. It asks for some\r\nsacrifice by all--the self-employed, beneficiaries, workers, government\r\nemployees, and the better-off among the retired--but it imposes an undue\r\nburden on none. And, in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the\r\nAmerican people: The integrity of the social security system will be\r\npreserved, and no one's payments will be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe Commission's plan will do the job; indeed, it must do the job. We owe\r\nit to today's older Americans and today's younger workers. So, before we go\r\nany further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the\r\nCommission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and\r\nSpeaker Tip O'Neill for a job well done. I hope and pray the bipartisan\r\nspirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face\r\nthe challenges of the year ahead.\r\n\r\nNearly half a century ago, in this Chamber, another American President,\r\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, in his second State of the Union message, urged\r\nAmerica to look to the future, to meet the challenge of change and the need\r\nfor leadership that looks forward, not backward.\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the world,\" he said, \"change is the order of the day. In every\r\nnation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to (of)\r\nmany kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were\r\nunprepared.\" He also reminded us that \"the future lies with those wise\r\npolitical leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in\r\nGovernment than in politics.\"\r\n\r\nSo, let us, in these next 2 years--men and women of both parties, every\r\npolitical shade--concentrate on the long-range, bipartisan responsibilities\r\nof government, not the short-range or short-term temptations of partisan\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of\r\ngovernment had expected; the recession was deeper than most inside and out\r\nof government had predicted. Curing those problems has taken more time and\r\na higher toll than any of us wanted. Unemployment is far too high.\r\nProjected Federal spending--if government refuses to tighten its own\r\nbelt--will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic\r\nrecovery now underway.\r\n\r\nThis recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and\r\nspending for consumer items and capital goods--the stimulus we need to\r\nrestart our stalled economic engines. The American people have already\r\nstepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed to\r\nmodernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to\r\nbusiness and industry.\r\n\r\nThe inflationary expectations that led to a 21 1/2-percent interest prime\r\nrate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by almost half.\r\nLeaders have started to realize that double-digit inflation is no longer a\r\nway of life. I misspoke there. I should have said \"lenders.\"\r\n\r\nSo, interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital\r\nindustries like housing and autos.\r\n\r\nThe early evidence of that recovery has started coming in. Housing starts\r\nfor the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago, and\r\nhousing permits, a sure indicator of future growth, were up a whopping 60\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nWe're witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that\r\nAmerican industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and\r\nabroad, ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the Nation's work force.\r\nBut our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience. Quick\r\nfixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what\r\nbrought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such a heavy\r\nprice to cure.\r\n\r\nThe permanent recovery in employment, production, and investment we seek\r\nwon't come in a sharp, short spurt. It'll build carefully and steadily in\r\nthe months and years ahead. In the meantime, the challenge of government is\r\nto identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic\r\ntransition for the American people.\r\n\r\nThe Federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.\r\nUnless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could\r\nface the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future.\r\nFailure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion\r\ndollars more in national debt in the next 4 years alone. That would average\r\n$4,300 in additional debt for every man, woman, child, and baby in our\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nTo assure a sustained recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending\r\nunder control to bring those deficits down. If we don't, the recovery will\r\nbe too short, unemployment will remain too high, and we will leave an\r\nunconscionable burden of national debt for our children. That we must not\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nLet's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from. Contrary to the\r\ndrumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we face\r\nare not rooted in defense spending. Taken as a percentage of the gross\r\nnational product, our defense spending happens to be only about four-fifths\r\nof what it was in 1970. Nor is the deficit, as some would have it, rooted\r\nin tax cuts. Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national\r\nproduct remain about the same as they were in 1970. The fact is, our\r\ndeficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic\r\nspending.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970's, the share of our national income devoted to this\r\ndomestic spending increased by more than 60 percent, from 10 cents out of\r\nevery dollar produced by the American people to 16 cents. In spite of all\r\nour economies and efficiencies, and without adding any new programs, basic,\r\nnecessary domestic spending provided for in this year's budget will grow to\r\nalmost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of\r\nour Republic. We need a plan to overcome this danger--a plan based on these\r\nprinciples. It must be bipartisan. Conquering the deficits and putting the\r\nGovernment's house in order will require the best effort of all of us. It\r\nmust be fair. Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from\r\nrecovery, all would share fairly in the burden of transition. It must be\r\nprudent. The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we\r\ncan pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our\r\ncommitment to the truly needy. And finally, it must be realistic. We can't\r\nrely on hope alone.\r\n\r\nWith these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan to\r\nincrease economic growth and reduce deficits.\r\n\r\nFirst, in my budget message, I will recommend a Federal spending freeze. I\r\nknow this is strong medicine, but so far, we have only cut the rate of\r\nincrease in Federal spending. The Government has continued to spend more\r\nmoney each year, though not as much more as it did in the past. Taken as a\r\nwhole, the budget I'm proposing for the fiscal year will increase no more\r\nthan the rate of inflation. In other words, the Federal Government will\r\nhold the line on real spending. Now, that's far less than many American\r\nfamilies have had to do in these difficult times.\r\n\r\nI will request that the proposed 6-month freeze in cost-of-living\r\nadjustments recommended by the bipartisan Social Security Commission be\r\napplied to other government-related retirement programs. I will, also,\r\npropose a 1-year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs, and\r\nfor Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs. And let me say\r\nright here, I'm sorry, with regard to the military, in asking that of them,\r\nbecause for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in reward\r\nfor what the men and women in uniform are doing. But I'm sure they will\r\nunderstand that this must be across the board and fair.\r\n\r\nSecond, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the\r\ngrowth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs. These are the\r\nautomatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply\r\nfrozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970. They are the\r\nlargest single cause of the built-in or structural deficit problem. Our\r\nstandard here will be fairness, ensuring that the taxpayers' hard-earned\r\ndollars go only to the truly needy; that none of them are turned away, but\r\nthat fraud and waste are stamped out. And I'm sorry to say, there's a lot\r\nof it out there. In the food stamp program alone, last year, we identified\r\nalmost $1.1 billion in overpayments. The taxpayers aren't the only victims\r\nof this kind of abuse. The truly needy suffer as funds intended for them\r\nare taken not by the needy, but by the greedy. For everyone's sake, we must\r\nput an end to such waste and corruption.\r\n\r\nThird, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing\r\n$55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years. These are savings\r\nrecommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has assured me they can\r\nbe safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms\r\nreductions or endanger America's security. We will not gamble with our\r\nnational survival.\r\n\r\nAnd fourth, because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of\r\ndeficits over the next several years, I will propose a standby tax, limited\r\nto no more than 1 percent of the gross national product, to start in fiscal\r\n1986. It would last no more than 3 years, and it would start only if the\r\nCongress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program.\r\nAnd there are several other conditions also that must be met, all of them\r\nin order for this program to be triggered.\r\n\r\nNow, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a\r\nremedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely\r\nnecessary. In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the\r\ntax code and make it more fair for all Americans. This is a goal that every\r\nAmerican who's ever struggled with a tax form can understand.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax\r\nreforms that we've already enacted, including the 10-percent tax break\r\ncoming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing which will protect all\r\nAmericans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead.\r\n\r\nNow, I realize that this four-part plan is easier to describe than it will\r\nbe to enact. But the looming deficits that hang over us and over America's\r\nfuture must be reduced. The path I've outlined is fair, balanced, and\r\nrealistic. If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in deficits, aiming\r\ntoward a balanced budget by the end of the decade. It's the only path that\r\nwill lead to a strong, sustained recovery. Let us follow that path\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNo domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent jobs\r\nfor all Americans who want to work. The recovery program will provide jobs\r\nfor most, but others will need special help and training for new skills.\r\nShortly, I will submit to the Congress the Employment Act of 1983, designed\r\nto get at the special problems of the long-term unemployed, as well as\r\nyoung people trying to enter the job market. I'll propose extending\r\nunemployment benefits, including special incentives to employers who hire\r\nthe long-term unemployed, providing programs for displaced workers, and\r\nhelping federally funded and State-administered unemployment insurance\r\nprograms provide workers with training and relocation assistance. Finally,\r\nour proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to\r\nhelp young people get a start in the job market.\r\n\r\nWe must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our unemployed. I\r\nhope we can work together on this. I hope we can work together as we did\r\nlast year in enacting the landmark Job Training Partnership Act. Regulatory\r\nreform legislation, a responsible clean air act, and passage of enterprise\r\nzone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity.\r\n\r\nOne of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade. So, I will\r\npropose a broader strategy in the field of international trade--one that\r\nincreases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America's\r\nfarmers and workers in the world marketplace. We must have adequate export\r\nfinancing to sell American products overseas. I will ask for new\r\nnegotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products\r\ninto foreign markets. We must strengthen the organization of our trade\r\nagencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade\r\npolicy to promote free trade and the increased flow of American goods,\r\nservices, and investments.\r\n\r\nOur trade position can also be improved by making our port system more\r\nefficient. Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our\r\ncoalfields, railroads, trucking industry, and ports. After 2 years of\r\ndebate, it's time for us to get together and enact a port modernization\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nEducation, training, and retraining are fundamental to our success as are\r\nresearch and development and productivity. Labor, management, and\r\ngovernment at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools\r\nof growth. Tax policy, regulatory practices, and government programs all\r\nneed constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness. Every American\r\nhas a role and a stake in international trade.\r\n\r\nWe Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields. We must\r\nkeep that edge, and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics--starting\r\nwith our educational system. While we grew complacent, others have acted.\r\nJapan, with a population only about half the size of ours, graduates from\r\nits universities more engineers than we do. If a child doesn't receive\r\nadequate math and science teaching by the age of 16, he or she has lost the\r\nchance to be a scientist or an engineer. We must join together--parents,\r\nteachers, grass roots groups, organized labor, and the business\r\ncommunity--to revitalize American education by setting a standard of\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nIn 1983 we seek four major education goals: a quality education initiative\r\nto encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction\r\nthrough block grants to the States; establishment of education savings\r\naccounts that will give middle and lower-income families an incentive to\r\nsave for their children's college education and, at the same time,\r\nencourage a real increase in savings for economic growth; passage of\r\ntuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private\r\nor religiously affiliated schools; a constitutional amendment to permit\r\nvoluntary school prayer. God should never have been expelled from America's\r\nclassrooms in the first place.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic\r\nequity for women, and eliminate, once and for all, all traces of unjust\r\ndiscrimination against women from the United States Code. We will not\r\ntolerate wage discrimination based on sex, and we intend to strengthen\r\nenforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents, most of\r\nwhom are women, do not suffer unfair financial hardship. We will also take\r\naction to remedy inequities in pensions. These initiatives will be joined\r\nby others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.\r\n\r\nAlso in the area of fairness and equity, we will ask for extension of the\r\nCivil Rights Commission, which is due to expire this year. The Commission\r\nis an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America, and we\r\nstrongly support its reauthorization. Effective enforcement of our nation's\r\nfair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity. In the\r\nyear ahead, we'll work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for\r\nall Americans.\r\n\r\nThe time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes\r\nand acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.\r\nIt's high time that we make our cities safe again. This administration\r\nhereby declares an all-out war on big-time organized crime and the drug\r\nracketeers who are poisoning our young people. We will also implement\r\nrecommendations of our Task Force on Victims of Crime, which will report to\r\nme this week.\r\n\r\nAmerican agriculture, the envy of the world, has become the victim of its\r\nown successes. With one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself\r\nand 77 other people, America is confronted with record surplus crops and\r\ncommodity prices below the cost of production. We must strive, through\r\ninnovations like the payment-in-kind crop swap approach and an aggressive\r\nexport policy, to restore health and vitality to rural America. Meanwhile,\r\nI have instructed the Department of Agriculture to work individually with\r\nfarmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, our Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives has\r\nsuccessfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business,\r\nlabor, education, and government to address the training needs of American\r\nworkers. Thanks to the Task Force, private sector initiatives are now\r\nunderway in all 50 States of the Union, and thousands of working people\r\nhave been helped in making the shift from dead-end jobs and low-demand\r\nskills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy.\r\nAdditionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion\r\nof private community child care. The new advisory council on private sector\r\ninitiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private\r\ninitiative in 1983.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year, we will also act to improve the quality of life for\r\nAmericans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming\r\nan unbearable financial burden for so many. And we will submit legislation\r\nto provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans.\r\n\r\nI will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will\r\ncontinue our efforts to restore to States and local governments their roles\r\nas dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.\r\n\r\nDuring the next several weeks, I will send to the Congress a series of\r\ndetailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working\r\nwith you on the development of these initiatives.\r\n\r\nSo far, now, I've concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future.\r\nBut in almost every home and workplace in America, we're already witnessing\r\nreason for great hope--the first flowering of the manmade miracles of high\r\ntechnology, a field pioneered and still led by our country.\r\n\r\nTo many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing, cybernetics,\r\nand all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as\r\nmystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when\r\nthat first Model T rattled down Main Street, U.S.A. But as surely as\r\nAmerica's pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century,\r\nthe same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front of\r\nopportunity, the frontier of high technology.\r\n\r\nIn conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries,\r\nbut we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer\r\nof tomorrow. This administration is committed to keeping America the\r\ntechnological leader of the world now and into the 21st century.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn briefly to the international arena. America's leadership in\r\nthe world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values\r\nwhich guide us as a society: free elections, a free press, freedom of\r\nreligious choice, free trade unions, and above all, freedom for the\r\nindividual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state. These values\r\nare the bedrock of our strength. They unite us in a stewardship of peace\r\nand freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in Asia, in Latin America,\r\nand elsewhere. They are also the values which in the recent past some among\r\nus had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common\r\ndemocratic values, and we're applying them as a cornerstone of a\r\ncomprehensive strategy for peace with freedom. In London last year, I\r\nannounced the commitment of the United States to developing the\r\ninfrastructure of democracy throughout the world. We intend to pursue this\r\ndemocratic initiative vigorously. The future belongs not to governments and\r\nideologies which oppress their peoples, but to democratic systems of\r\nself-government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee\r\npersonal freedom.\r\n\r\nBut our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on\r\nstrength--economic strength and military strength. A strong American\r\neconomy is essential to the well-being and security of our friends and\r\nallies. The restoration of a strong, healthy American economy has been and\r\nremains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy. The progress I've\r\nbeen able to report to you tonight will, I know, be as warmly welcomed by\r\nthe rest of the world as it is by the American people.\r\n\r\nWe must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably\r\nlinked to the world economy. We export over 20 percent of our industrial\r\nproduction, and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export. We will\r\ncontinue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of Europe and\r\nJapan and with the International Monetary Fund to ensure it has adequate\r\nresources to help bring the world economy back to strong, noninflationary\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nAs the leader of the West and as a country that has become great and rich\r\nbecause of economic freedom, America must be an unrelenting advocate of\r\nfree trade. As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, our\r\nstrategy cannot be to follow them, but to lead the way toward freer trade.\r\nTo this end, in May of this year America will host an economic summit\r\nmeeting in Williamsburg, Virginia.\r\n\r\nAs we begin our third year, we have put in place a defense program that\r\nredeems the neglect of the past decade. We have developed a realistic\r\nmilitary strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if\r\ndeterrence fails. Our Armed Forces are finally properly paid; after years\r\nof neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied. And\r\nthe American uniform is once again worn with pride. Most of the major\r\nsystems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway, and we\r\nwill be addressing one key system, the MX missile, in consultation with the\r\nCongress in a few months.\r\n\r\nAmerica's foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on realism,\r\nstrength, full partnership, in consultation with our allies, and\r\nconstructive negotiation with potential adversaries. From the Middle East\r\nto southern Africa to Geneva, American diplomats are taking the initiative\r\nto make peace and lower arms levels. We should be proud of our role as\r\npeacemakers.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role in\r\nending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the\r\nPLO from Beirut.\r\n\r\nLast September, I outlined principles to carry on the peace process begun\r\nso promisingly at Camp David. All the people of the Middle East should know\r\nthat in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to build on that\r\nfoundation to bring them the blessings of peace.\r\n\r\nIn Central America and the Caribbean Basin, we are likewise engaged in a\r\npartnership for peace, prosperity, and democracy. Final passage of the\r\nremaining portions of our Caribbean Basin Initiative, which passed the\r\nHouse last year, is one of this administration's top legislative priorities\r\nfor 1983.\r\n\r\nThe security and economic assistance policies of this administration in\r\nLatin America and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical\r\ninvestment in the future of the human race. This undertaking is a joint\r\nresponsibility of the executive and legislative branches, and I'm counting\r\non the cooperation and statesmanship of the Congress to help us meet this\r\nessential foreign policy goal.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the Soviet\r\nUnion. The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership. We're prepared for\r\na positive change in Soviet-American relations. But the Soviet Union must\r\nshow by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rights\r\nand sovereignty of the family of nations. Responsible members of the world\r\ncommunity do not threaten or invade their neighbors. And they restrain\r\ntheir allies from aggression.\r\n\r\nFor our part, we're vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with\r\nthe Soviet Union. Supported by our allies, we've put forward draft\r\nagreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable\r\nlower levels. We insist on an equal balance of forces. And given the\r\noverwhelming evidence of Soviet violations of international treaties\r\nconcerning chemical and biological weapons, we also insist that any\r\nagreement we sign can and will be verifiable.\r\n\r\nIn the case of intermediate-range nuclear forces, we have proposed the\r\ncomplete elimination of the entire class of land-based missiles. We're also\r\nprepared to carefully explore serious Soviet proposals. At the same time,\r\nlet me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms\r\nreductions.\r\n\r\nWith firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate. Deep down, the\r\nSoviets must know it's in their interest as well as ours to prevent a\r\nwasteful arms race. And once they recognize our unshakable resolve to\r\nmaintain adequate deterrence, they will have every reason to join us in the\r\nsearch for greater security and major arms reductions. When that moment\r\ncomes--and I'm confident that it will--we will have taken an important step\r\ntoward a more peaceful future for all the world's people.\r\n\r\nA very wise man, Bernard Baruch, once said that America has never forgotten\r\nthe nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path. Our\r\ncountry is a special place, because we Americans have always been\r\nsustained, through good times and bad, by a noble vision--a vision not only\r\nof what the world around us is today but what we as a free people can make\r\nit be tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWe're realists; we solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no matter\r\nhow loud the chorus of despair around us. But we're also idealists, for it\r\nwas an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nRight now we need both realism and idealism. Millions of our neighbors are\r\nwithout work. It is up to us to see they aren't without hope. This is a\r\ntask for all of us. And may I say, Americans have rallied to this cause,\r\nproving once again that we are the most generous people on Earth.\r\n\r\nWe who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy. And\r\nhere all that time, I thought you were reading the paper.\r\n\r\nThe single thing--the single thing that can start the wheels of industry\r\nturning again is further reduction of interest rates. Just another 1 or 2\r\npoints can mean tens of thousands of jobs.\r\n\r\nRight now, with inflation as low as it is, 3.9 percent, there is room for\r\ninterest rates to come down. Only fear prevents their reduction. A lender,\r\nas we know, must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciated\r\nvalue of the dollars loaned. And that depreciation is, of course, the\r\namount of inflation. Today, interest rates are based on fear--fear that\r\ngovernment will resort to measures, as it has in the past, that will send\r\ninflation zooming again.\r\n\r\nWe who serve here in this Capital must erase that fear by making it\r\nabsolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation; that, together,\r\nwe will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth.\r\n\r\nYes, the problems confronting us are large and forbidding. And, certainly,\r\nno one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and\r\nneighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment. But we\r\nmust and can give them good reason to be hopeful.\r\n\r\nBack over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these\r\nwalls when our nation was threatened; sometimes when its very existence was\r\nat stake. Always with courage and common sense, they met the crises of\r\ntheir time and lived to see a stronger, better, and more prosperous\r\ncountry. The present situation is no worse and, in fact, is not as bad as\r\nsome of those they faced. Time and again, they proved that there is nothing\r\nwe Americans cannot achieve as free men and women.\r\n\r\nYes, we still have problems--plenty of them. But it's just plain\r\nwrong--unjust to our country and unjust to our people--to let those\r\nproblems stand in the way of the most important truth of all: America is on\r\nthe mend.\r\n\r\nWe owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them\r\nin every way we can. No one can quarrel with that. We must and do have\r\ncompassion for all the victims of this economic crisis. But the big story\r\nabout America today is the way that millions of confident, caring\r\npeople--those extraordinary \"ordinary\" Americans who never make the\r\nheadlines and will never be interviewed--are laying the foundation, not\r\njust for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow for\r\nall our people.\r\n\r\nFrom coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories, at new\r\nconstruction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors are\r\nhelping neighbors. And they've already begun the building, the research,\r\nthe work, and the giving that will make our country great again.\r\n\r\nI believe this, because I believe in them--in the strength of their hearts\r\nand minds, in the commitment that each one of them brings to their daily\r\nlives, be they high or humble. The challenge for us in government is to be\r\nworthy of them--to make government a help, not a hindrance to our people in\r\nthe challenging but promising days ahead.\r\n\r\nIf we do that, if we care what our children and our children's children\r\nwill say of us, if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did here\r\nin these temples of freedom, we will work together to make America better\r\nfor our having been here--not just in this year or this decade but in the\r\nnext century and beyond.\r\n\r\nThank you, and God bless you.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:03 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio\r\nand television.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRonald Reagan\r\nJanuary 25, 1984\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored\r\nguests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nOnce again, in keeping with time-honored tradition, I have come to report\r\nto you on the state of the Union, and I'm pleased to report that America is\r\nmuch improved, and there's good reason to believe that improvement will\r\ncontinue through the days to come.\r\n\r\nYou and I have had some honest and open differences in the year past. But\r\nthey didn't keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop a\r\nlong decline that had drained this nation's spirit and eroded its health.\r\nThere is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land. America is back,\r\nstanding tall, looking to the eighties with courage, confidence, and hope.\r\n\r\nThe problems we're overcoming are not the heritage of one person, party, or\r\neven one generation. It's just the tendency of government to grow, for\r\npractices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life we'll\r\never see on this Earth. And there's always that well-intentioned chorus of\r\nvoices saying, \"With a little more power and a little more money, we could\r\ndo so much for the people.\" For a time we forgot the American dream isn't\r\none of making government bigger; it's keeping faith with the mighty spirit\r\nof free people under God.\r\n\r\nAs we came to the decade of the eighties, we faced the worst crisis in our\r\npostwar history. In the seventies were years of rising problems and falling\r\nconfidence. There was a feeling government had grown beyond the consent of\r\nthe governed. Families felt helpless in the face of mounting inflation and\r\nthe indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work, thrift, and\r\nrisktaking. All this was overlaid by an evergrowing web of rules and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nOn the international scene, we had an uncomfortable feeling that we'd lost\r\nthe respect of friend and foe. Some questioned whether we had the will to\r\ndefend peace and freedom. But America is too great for small dreams. There\r\nwas a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival; if you will, a crusade\r\nfor renewal. The American people said: Let us look to the future with\r\nconfidence, both at home and abroad. Let us give freedom a chance.\r\n\r\nAmericans were ready to make a new beginning, and together we have done it.\r\nWe're confronting our problems one by one. Hope is alive tonight for\r\nmillions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax\r\nincreases and crushing inflation. Inflation has been beaten down from 12.4\r\nto 3.2 percent, and that's a great victory for all the people. The prime\r\nrate has been cut almost in half, and we must work together to bring it\r\ndown even more.\r\n\r\nTogether, we passed the first across-the-board tax reduction for everyone\r\nsince the Kennedy tax cuts. Next year, tax rates will be indexed so\r\ninflation can't push people into higher brackets when they get\r\ncost-of-living pay raises. Government must never again use inflation to\r\nprofit at the people's expense.\r\n\r\nToday a working family earning $25,000 has $1,100 more in purchasing power\r\nthan if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 levels. Real\r\nafter-tax income increased 5 percent last year. And economic deregulation\r\nof key industries like transportation has offered more chances--or\r\nchoices, I should say, to consumers and new changes--or chances for\r\nentrepreneurs and protecting safety. Tonight, we can report and be proud of\r\none of the best recoveries in decades. Send away the handwringers and the\r\ndoubting Thomases. Hope is reborn for couples dreaming of owning homes and\r\nfor risktakers with vision to create tomorrow's opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of high-tech\r\nand by small business people with big ideas--people like Barbara Proctor,\r\nwho rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion-dollar advertising agency in\r\nChicago; Carlos Perez, a Cuban refugee, who turned $27 and a dream into a\r\nsuccessful importing business in Coral Gables, Florida.\r\n\r\nPeople like these are heroes for the eighties. They helped 4 million\r\nAmericans find jobs in 1983. More people are drawing paychecks tonight than\r\never before. And Congress helps--or progress helps everyone--well, Congress\r\ndoes too----everyone. In 1983 women filled 73 percent of all the new jobs\r\nin managerial, professional, and technical fields.\r\n\r\nBut we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work,\r\nwondering what will come of their hopes and dreams. Can we love America and\r\nnot reach out to tell them: You are not forgotten; we will not rest until\r\neach of you can reach as high as your God-given talents will take you.\r\n\r\nThe heart of America is strong; it's good and true. The cynics were wrong;\r\nAmerica never was a sick society. We're seeing rededication to bedrock\r\nvalues of faith, family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom--values\r\nthat help bring us together as one people, from the youngest child to the\r\nmost senior citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Congress deserves America's thanks for helping us restore pride and\r\ncredibility to our military. And I hope that you're as proud as I am of the\r\nyoung men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the ramparts in\r\ndefense of freedom and whose dedication, valor, and skill increases so much\r\nour chance of living in a world at peace.\r\n\r\nPeople everywhere hunger for peace and a better life. The tide of the\r\nfuture is a freedom tide, and our struggle for democracy cannot and will\r\nnot be denied. This nation champions peace that enshrines liberty,\r\ndemocratic rights, and dignity for every individual. America's new\r\nstrength, confidence, and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity far\r\nfrom our shores. A world economic recovery is underway. It began here.\r\n\r\nWe've journeyed far, but we have much farther to go. Franklin Roosevelt\r\ntold us 50 years ago this month: \"Civilization can not go back;\r\ncivilization must not stand still. We have undertaken new methods. It is\r\nour task to perfect, to improve, to alter when necessary, but in all cases\r\nto go forward.\"\r\n\r\nIt's time to move forward again, time for America to take freedom's next\r\nstep. Let us unite tonight behind four great goals to keep America free,\r\nsecure, and at peace in the eighties together.\r\n\r\nWe can ensure steady economic growth. We can develop America's next\r\nfrontier. We can strengthen our traditional values. And we can build a\r\nmeaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faith\r\nthat has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom,\r\nprogress, and hope.\r\n\r\nDoing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity, provide\r\ngreater security for all, with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth, our first great\r\ngoal. We might well begin with common sense in Federal budgeting:\r\ngovernment spending no more than government takes in.\r\n\r\nWe must bring Federal deficits down. But how we do that makes all the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nWe can begin by limiting the size and scope of government. Under the\r\nleadership of Vice President Bush, we have reduced the growth of Federal\r\nregulations by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hours of\r\ngovernment-required paperwork each year. This will save the public more\r\nthan $150 billion over the next 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe Grace commission has given us some 2,500 recommendations for reducing\r\nwasteful spending, and they're being examined throughout the\r\nadministration. Federal spending growth has been cut from 17.4 percent in\r\n1980 to less than half of that today, and we have already achieved over\r\n$300 billion in budget savings for the period of 1982 to '86. But that's\r\nonly a little more than half of what we sought. Government is still\r\nspending too large a percentage of the total economy.\r\n\r\nNow, some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by\r\nreducing the portion spent on defense. This ignores the fact that national\r\ndefense is solely the responsibility of the Federal Government; indeed, it\r\nis its prime responsibility. And yet defense spending is less than a third\r\nof the total budget. During the years of President Kennedy and of the years\r\nbefore that, defense was almost half the total budget. And then came\r\nseveral years in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorate\r\nto a very dangerous degree. We are just now restoring, through the\r\nessential modernization of our conventional and strategic forces, our\r\ncapability to meet our present and future security needs. We dare not shirk\r\nour responsibility to keep America free, secure, and at peace.\r\n\r\nThe last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control. But\r\nthe basis for such spending had been laid in previous years. A pattern of\r\noverspending has been in place for half a century. As the national debt\r\ngrew, we were told not to worry, that we owed it to ourselves.\r\n\r\nNow we know that deficits are a cause for worry. But there's a difference\r\nof opinion as to whether taxes should be increased, spending cut, or some\r\nof both. Fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficit\r\ncould inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for business\r\nand industrial expansion. Well, I think that debate is missing an important\r\npoint. Whether government borrows or increases taxes, it will be taking the\r\nsame amount of money from the private sector, and, either way, that's too\r\nmuch. Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on\r\nfamilies struggling to pay their bills. The root of the problem is that\r\ngovernment's share is more than we can afford if we're to have a sound\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nWe must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth. In the\r\nbudget that I will submit on February 1st, I will recommend measures that\r\nwill reduce the deficit over the next 5 years. Many of these will be\r\nunfinished business from last year's budget.\r\n\r\nSome could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort to\r\naddress this problem. I spoke today with Speaker of the House O'Neill,\r\nSenate Majority Leader Baker, Senate Minority Leader Byrd, and House\r\nMinority Leader Michel. I asked them if they would designate congressional\r\nrepresentatives to meet with representatives of the administration to try\r\nto reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan. I know it\r\nwould take a long, hard struggle to agree on a full-scale plan. So, what I\r\nhave proposed is that we first see if we can agree on a down payment.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe there is basis for such an agreement, one that could reduce\r\nthe deficits by about a hundred billion dollars over the next 3 years. We\r\ncould focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that are still\r\npending before the Congress. These could be combined with measures to close\r\ncertain tax loopholes, measures that the Treasury Department has previously\r\nsaid to be worthy of support. In addition, we could examine the possibility\r\nof achieving further outlay savings based on the work of the Grace\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nIf the congressional leadership is willing, my representatives will be\r\nprepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time. I would hope\r\nthe leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop\r\nand enact that down payment.\r\n\r\nBut a down payment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficit\r\nproblem. It could help us start on the right path. Yet, we must do more.\r\nSo, I propose that we begin exploring how together we can make structural\r\nreforms to curb the built-in growth of spending.\r\n\r\nI also propose improvements in the budgeting process. Some 43 of our 50\r\nStates grant their Governors the right to veto individual items in\r\nappropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill. California is\r\none of those 43 States. As Governor, I found this line-item veto was a\r\npowerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending. It works in 43\r\nStates. Let's put it to work in Washington for all the people.\r\n\r\nIt would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment. The\r\nmajority of Americans approve of such an amendment, just as they and I\r\napprove of an amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget. Many States\r\nalso have this protection in their constitutions.\r\n\r\nTo talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a Band-Aid\r\nsolution which does nothing to cure an illness that's been coming on for\r\nhalf a century--to say nothing of the fact that it poses a real threat to\r\neconomic recovery. Let's remember that a substantial amount of income tax\r\nis presently owed and not paid by people in the underground economy. It\r\nwould be immoral to make those who are paying taxes pay more to compensate\r\nfor those who aren't paying their share.\r\n\r\nThere's a better way. Let us go forward with an historic reform for\r\nfairness, simplicity, and incentives for growth. I am asking Secretary Don\r\nRegan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so all\r\ntaxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly. And I believe such a\r\nplan could result in that underground economy being brought into the\r\nsunlight of honest tax compliance. And it could make the tax base broader,\r\nso personal tax rates could come down, not go up. I've asked that specific\r\nrecommendations, consistent with those objectives, be presented to me by\r\nDecember 1984.\r\n\r\nOur second great goal is to build on America's pioneer spirit--I said\r\nsomething funny? I said America's next frontier--and that's to develop that\r\nfrontier. A sparkling economy spurs initiatives, sunrise industries, and\r\nmakes older ones more competitive.\r\n\r\nNowhere is this more important than our next frontier: space. Nowhere do we\r\nso effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make\r\nlife better on Earth. The Space Age is barely a quarter of a century old.\r\nBut already we've pushed civilization forward with our advances in science\r\nand technology. Opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross new\r\nthresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown.\r\n\r\nOur progress in space--taking giant steps for all mankind--is a tribute to\r\nAmerican teamwork and excellence. Our finest minds in government, industry,\r\nand academia have all pulled together. And we can be proud to say: We are\r\nfirst; we are the best; and we are so because we're free.\r\n\r\nAmerica has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reach\r\nfor greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and\r\nworking in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain. Tonight, I am\r\ndirecting NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it\r\nwithin a decade.\r\n\r\nA space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science,\r\ncommunications, in metals, and in lifesaving medicines which could be\r\nmanufactured only in space. We want our friends to help us meet these\r\nchallenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries to\r\nparticipate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand\r\nfreedom for all who share our goals.\r\n\r\nJust as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and Yankee\r\ntraders, space holds enormous potential for commerce today. The market for\r\nspace transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it. Companies\r\ninterested in putting payloads into space must have ready access to private\r\nsector launch services. The Department of Transportation will help an\r\nexpendable launch services industry to get off the ground. We'll soon\r\nimplement a number of executive initiatives, develop proposals to ease\r\nregulatory constraints, and, with NASA's help, promote private sector\r\ninvestment in space.\r\n\r\nAnd as we develop the frontier of space, let us remember our responsibility\r\nto preserve our older resources here on Earth. Preservation of our\r\nenvironment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it's common sense.\r\n\r\nThough this is a time of budget constraints, I have requested for EPA one\r\nof the largest percentage budget increases of any agency. We will begin the\r\nlong, necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a\r\nspecial national resource--the Chesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps, EPA will\r\nspend $410 million. And I will request a supplemental increase of 50\r\nmillion. And because the Superfund law expires in 1985, I've asked Bill\r\nRuckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there'll be\r\nadditional time to complete this important task.\r\n\r\nOn the question of acid rain, which concerns people in many areas of the\r\nUnited States and Canada, I'm proposing a research program that doubles our\r\ncurrent funding. And we'll take additional action to restore our lakes and\r\ndevelop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid rain.\r\n\r\nWe have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources. We'll ask\r\nthe Congress for $157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park and\r\nconservation lands. The Department of the Interior will encourage careful,\r\nselective exploration and production on our vital resources in an Exclusive\r\nEconomic Zone within the 200-mile limit off our coasts--but with strict\r\nadherence to environmental laws and with fuller State and public\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\nBut our most precious resources, our greatest hope for the future, are the\r\nminds and hearts of our people, especially our children. We can help them\r\nbuild tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values. This must\r\nbe our third great goal. For us, faith, work, family, neighborhood,\r\nfreedom, and peace are not just words; they're expressions of what America\r\nmeans, definitions of what makes us a good and loving people.\r\n\r\nFamilies stand at the center of our society. And every family has a\r\npersonal stake in promoting excellence in education. Excellence does not\r\nbegin in Washington. A 600-percent increase in Federal spending on\r\neducation between 1960 and 1980 was accompanied by a steady decline in\r\nScholastic Aptitude Test scores. Excellence must begin in our homes and\r\nneighborhood schools, where it's the responsibility of every parent and\r\nteacher and the right of every child.\r\n\r\nOur children come first, and that's why I established a bipartisan National\r\nCommission on Excellence in Education, to help us chart a commonsense\r\ncourse for better education. And already, communities are implementing the\r\nCommission's recommendations. Schools are reporting progress in math and\r\nreading skills. But we must do more to restore discipline to schools; and\r\nwe must encourage the teaching of new basics, reward teachers of merit,\r\nenforce tougher standards, and put our parents back in charge.\r\n\r\nI will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunities\r\nfor families and to soften the double payment for those paying public\r\nschool taxes and private school tuition. Our proposal would target\r\nassistance to low- and middle-income families. Just as more incentives are\r\nneeded within our schools, greater competition is needed among our schools.\r\nWithout standards and competition, there can be no champions, no records\r\nbroken, no excellence in education or any other walk of life.\r\n\r\nAnd while I'm on this subject, each day your Members observe a 200-year-old\r\ntradition meant to signify America is one nation under God. I must ask: If\r\nyou can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here\r\nleading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed\r\nagain by children in every schoolroom across this land?\r\n\r\nAmerica was founded by people who believed that God was their rock of\r\nsafety. He is ours. I recognize we must be cautious in claiming that God is\r\non our side, but I think it's all right to keep asking if we're on His\r\nside.\r\n\r\nDuring our first 3 years, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore\r\nprotection of the law to unborn children. Now, I know this issue is very\r\ncontroversial. But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child\r\nis not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof that it\r\nisn't? No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the evidence is to\r\nthe contrary. We should rise above bitterness and reproach, and if\r\nAmericans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping,\r\nthen we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion.\r\n\r\nEconomic recovery, better education, rededication to values, all show the\r\nspirit of renewal gaining the upper hand. And all will improve family life\r\nin the eighties. But families need more. They need assurance that they and\r\ntheir loved ones can walk the streets of America without being afraid.\r\nParents need to know their children will not be victims of child\r\npornography and abduction. This year we will intensify our drive against\r\nthese and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family violence.\r\n\r\nAlready our efforts to crack down on career criminals, organized crime,\r\ndrugpushers, and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are having\r\neffect. In 1982 the crime rate dropped by 4.3 percent, the biggest decline\r\nsince 1972. Protecting victims is just as important as safeguarding the\r\nrights of defendants.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for all Americans will increase if we move forward in fair\r\nhousing and work to ensure women's rights, provide for equitable treatment\r\nin pension benefits and Individual Retirement Accounts, facilitate child\r\ncare, and enforce delinquent parent support payments.\r\n\r\nIt's not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our\r\nvalues and shape our future. So, I ask your help in assisting more\r\ncommunities to break the bondage of dependency. Help us to free enterprise\r\nby permitting debate and voting \"yes\" on our proposal for enterprise zones\r\nin America. This has been before you for 2 years. Its passage can help\r\nhigh-unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nA society bursting with opportunities, reaching for its future with\r\nconfidence, sustained by faith, fair play, and a conviction that good and\r\ncourageous people will flourish when they're free--these are the secrets of\r\na strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.\r\n\r\nA lasting and meaningful peace is our fourth great goal. It is our highest\r\naspiration. And our record is clear: Americans resort to force only when we\r\nmust. We have never been aggressors. We have always struggled to defend\r\nfreedom and democracy.\r\n\r\nWe have no territorial ambitions. We occupy no countries. We build no walls\r\nto lock people in. Americans build the future. And our vision of a better\r\nlife for farmers, merchants, and working people, from the Americas to Asia,\r\nbegins with a simple premise: The future is best decided by ballots, not\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nGovernments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war on\r\ntheir neighbors. Only when people are given a personal stake in deciding\r\ntheir own destiny, benefiting from their own risks, do they create\r\nsocieties that are prosperous, progressive, and free. Tonight, it is\r\ndemocracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry, prolonging life, and\r\neliminating drudgery.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping America strong, free, and at peace, there should\r\nbe no Republicans or Democrats, just patriotic Americans. We can decide the\r\ntough issues not by who is right, but by what is right.\r\n\r\nTogether, we can continue to advance our agenda for peace. We can establish\r\na more stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet Union;\r\nstrengthen allied relations across the board; achieve real and equitable\r\nreductions in the levels of nuclear arms; reinforce our peacemaking efforts\r\nin the Middle East, Central America, and southern Africa; or assist\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere;\r\nand assist in the development of democratic institutions throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of the\r\nScowcroft commission, which strengthened our ability to deter war and\r\nprotect peace. In that same spirit, I urge you to move forward with the\r\nHenry Jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the Bipartisan\r\nCommission on Central America.\r\n\r\nYour joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon is\r\nalso serving the cause of peace. We are making progress in Lebanon. For\r\nnearly 10 years, the Lebanese have lived from tragedy to tragedy with no\r\nhope for their future. Now the multinational peacekeeping force and our\r\nmarines are helping them break their cycle of despair. There is hope for a\r\nfree, independent, and sovereign Lebanon. We must have the courage to give\r\npeace a chance. And we must not be driven from our objectives for peace in\r\nLebanon by state-sponsored terrorism. We have seen this ugly specter in\r\nBeirut, Kuwait, and Rangoon. It demands international attention. I will\r\nforward shortly legislative proposals to help combat terrorism. And I will\r\nbe seeking support from our allies for concerted action.\r\n\r\nOur NATO alliance is strong. 1983 was a banner year for political courage.\r\nAnd we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships in the Far\r\nEast. We're committed to dialog, deterrence, and promoting prosperity.\r\nWe'll work with our trading partners for a new round of negotiations in\r\nsupport of freer world trade, greater competition, and more open markets.\r\n\r\nA rebirth of bipartisan cooperation, of economic growth, and military\r\ndeterrence, and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and our\r\nallies abroad underline a fundamental and far-reaching change: The United\r\nStates is safer, stronger, and more secure in 1984 than before. We can now\r\nmove with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace, and we will.\r\n\r\nTonight, I want to speak to the people of the Soviet Union, to tell them\r\nit's true that our governments have had serious differences, but our sons\r\nand daughters have never fought each other in war. And if we Americans have\r\nour way, they never will.\r\n\r\nPeople of the Soviet Union, there is only one sane policy, for your country\r\nand mine, to preserve our civilization in this modern age: A nuclear war\r\ncannot be won and must never be fought. The only value in our two nations\r\npossessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used. But\r\nthen would it not be better to do away with them entirely?\r\n\r\nPeople of the Soviet, President Dwight Eisenhower, who fought by your side\r\nin World War II, said the essential struggle \"is not merely man against man\r\nor nation against nation. It is man against war.\" Americans are people of\r\npeace. If your government wants peace, there will be peace. We can come\r\ntogether in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world for\r\nour children and our children's children. And the whole world will rejoice.\r\nThat is my message to you.\r\n\r\nSome days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us or\r\na friend to help us, we find a person who reminds us what it means to be\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nSergeant Stephen Trujillo, a medic in the 2d Ranger Battalion, 75th\r\nInfantry, was in the first helicopter to land at the compound held by Cuban\r\nforces in Grenada. He saw three other helicopters crash. Despite the\r\nimminent explosion of the burning aircraft, he never hesitated. He ran\r\nacross 25 yards of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wounded\r\nsoldiers. He directed two other medics, administered first aid, and\r\nreturned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends to\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nSergeant Trujillo, you and your fellow service men and women not only saved\r\ninnocent lives; you set a nation free. You inspire us as a force for\r\nfreedom, not for despotism; and, yes, for peace, not conquest. God bless\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are unsung heroes: single parents, couples, church and civic\r\nvolunteers. Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family and\r\ncommunity problems. They soothe our sorrow, heal our wounds, calm our\r\nfears, and share our joy.\r\n\r\nA person like Father Ritter is always there. His Covenant House programs in\r\nNew York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightened\r\nand abused children each year. The same is true of Dr. Charles Carson.\r\nParalyzed in a plane crash, he still believed nothing is impossible. Today\r\nin Minnesota, he works 80 hours a week without pay, helping pioneer the\r\nfield of computer-controlled walking. He has given hope to 500,000\r\nparalyzed Americans that some day they may walk again.\r\n\r\nHow can we not believe in the greatness of America? How can we not do what\r\nis right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on Earth? After\r\nall our struggles to restore America, to revive confidence in our country,\r\nhope for our future, after all our hard-won victories earned through the\r\npatience and courage of every citizen, we cannot, must not, and will not\r\nturn back. We will finish our job. How could we do less? We're Americans.\r\n\r\nCarl Sandburg said, \"I see America not in the setting sun of a black night\r\nof despair... I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun fresh\r\nfrom the burning, creative hand of God... I see great days ahead for men\r\nand women of will and vision.\"\r\n\r\nI've never felt more strongly that America's best days and democracy's best\r\ndays lie ahead. We're a powerful force for good. With faith and courage, we\r\ncan perform great deeds and take freedom's next step. And we will. We will\r\ncarry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light\r\nwhere there was darkness, warmth where there was cold, medicine where there\r\nwas disease, food where there was hunger, and peace where there was only\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nLet us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, that\r\nin our time we did everything that could be done. We finished the race; we\r\nkept them free; we kept the faith.\r\n\r\nThank you very much. God bless you, and God bless America.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:02 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRonald Reagan\r\nFebruary 6, 1985\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored\r\nguests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nI come before you to report on the state of our Union, and I'm pleased to\r\nreport that after 4 years of united effort, the American people have\r\nbrought forth a nation renewed, stronger, freer, and more secure than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFour years ago we began to change, forever I hope, our assumptions about\r\ngovernment and its place in our lives. Out of that change has come great\r\nand robust growth--in our confidence, our economy, and our role in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear. We\r\nbelieve faith and freedom must be our guiding stars, for they show us\r\ntruth, they make us brave, give us hope, and leave us wiser than we were.\r\nOur progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of our\r\nfamilies, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together,\r\nare unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God.\r\n\r\nFour years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people\r\ngreater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more of\r\nwhat they earned. We did what we promised, and a great industrial giant is\r\nreborn.\r\n\r\nTonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth, the\r\nstrongest in 34 years; a 3-year inflation average of 3.9 percent, the\r\nlowest in 17 years; and 7.3 million new jobs in 2 years, with more of our\r\ncitizens working than ever before.\r\n\r\nNew freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success:\r\n\r\nFor an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if (as) the\r\nfamily goes, so goes our civilization;\r\n\r\nFor an America of vision that sees tomorrow's dreams in the learning and\r\nhard work we do today;\r\n\r\nFor an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet,\r\nproudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom;\r\n\r\nFor an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nWe have begun well. But it's only a beginning. We're not here to\r\ncongratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to\r\nfinish what has not yet been done.\r\n\r\nWe're here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real\r\njobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach. We're here to speak\r\nfor the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries\r\nfighting to modernize and compete. And, yes, we're here to stand, and\r\nproudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, for\r\nall who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and\r\nhuman happiness.\r\n\r\nProverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish. When asked what great\r\nprinciple holds our Union together, Abraham Lincoln said: \"Something in\r\n(the) Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country,\r\nbut hope to the world for all future time.\"\r\n\r\nWe honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the\r\ndreams their vision foresaw. My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for\r\ngreatness. The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge--a\r\nsecond American Revolution of hope and opportunity; a revolution carrying\r\nus to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and\r\nspace; a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to\r\nsummon greater strength than we've ever known; and a revolution that\r\ncarries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom. There are no\r\nconstraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no\r\nbarriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect. Already, pushing\r\ndown tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, they're calling it \"the American Miracle.\" Day by day, we're\r\nshattering accepted notions of what is possible. When I was growing up, we\r\nfailed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace.\r\nWell, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are\r\ntransforming our lives.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1950's workers at the AT&T semiconductor plant in Pennsylvania\r\nproduced five transistors a day for $7.50 apiece. They now produce over a\r\nmillion for less than a penny apiece.\r\n\r\nNew laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut\r\ndiagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes, reduce\r\nhospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving human\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nOur automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased worker\r\nproductivity, and is competitive once again.\r\n\r\nWe stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be\r\nmore. Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it's getting younger and\r\nstronger. It doesn't need rest and supervision; it needs new challenge,\r\ngreater freedom. And that word \"freedom\" is the key to the second American\r\nrevolution that we need to bring about.\r\n\r\nLet us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for\r\nfairness and growth. Last year I asked Treasury Secretary-then-Regan to\r\ndevelop a plan to simplify the tax code, so all taxpayers would be treated\r\nmore fairly and personal tax rates could come further down.\r\n\r\nWe have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent, yet the tax system remains\r\nunfair and limits our potential for growth. Exclusions and exemptions cause\r\nsimilar incomes to be taxed at different levels. Low-income families face\r\nsteep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder. The Treasury\r\nDepartment has produced an excellent reform plan, whose principles will\r\nguide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact.\r\n\r\nOne thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise. We\r\nwill not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need. We\r\nwill reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax\r\npreferences. We will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent, and\r\npossibly lower. And we will propose reducing corporate rates, while\r\nmaintaining incentives for capital formation.\r\n\r\nTo encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we\r\nwill propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally\r\nexempt from Federal income tax. To restore fairness to families, we will\r\npropose increasing significantly the personal exemption.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker--I have to get\r\nused to saying that--to begin working with congressional authors and\r\ncommittees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles. We\r\nwill call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman\r\nin this Chamber. Together, we can pass, this year, a tax bill for fairness,\r\nsimplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our dreams and\r\nAmerica the investment capital of the world. So let us begin.\r\n\r\nTax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous\r\npent-up power of our economy. But a second American revolution must carry\r\nthe promise of opportunity for all. It is time to liberate the spirit of\r\nenterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.\r\n\r\nThis government will meet its responsibility to help those in need. But\r\npolicies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroy\r\nself-respect are not progressive; they're reactionary. Despite our strides\r\nin civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not have full\r\nand equal power until they have full economic power.\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in the\r\nabandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build better\r\nlives. This legislation is supported by a majority of you.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans.\r\nLet us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of\r\nentrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year. And, Tip, you could\r\nmake that a birthday present.\r\n\r\nNor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage\r\nproposal. We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate,\r\nfind summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in\r\ntheir futures.\r\n\r\nWe'll continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act, which has a\r\nnearly two-thirds job placement rate. Credits in education and health care\r\nvouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.\r\n\r\nOur administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing\r\nresidents to own and manage their own dwellings. It's time that all public\r\nhousing residents have that opportunity of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom. But\r\nStates and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery,\r\nmust not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nLet us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading\r\nopportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThere are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on\r\ndeficit reductions. Well, the best way to reduce deficits is through\r\neconomic growth. More businesses will be started, more investments made,\r\nmore jobs created, and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes. The\r\nbest way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending\r\nby increasing prosperity. Each added percentage point per year of real GNP\r\ngrowth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly $200 billion\r\nover 5 years.\r\n\r\nTo move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten\r\ngovernment's claim on our total economy. We will not do this by raising\r\ntaxes. We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in\r\nspending by the Federal Government. In our fiscal year 1986 budget, overall\r\ngovernment program spending will be frozen at the current level. It must\r\nnot be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key.\r\n\r\nFirst, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled, and\r\nunemployed will be left intact. Growth of our major health care programs,\r\nMedicare and Medicaid, will be slowed, but protections for the elderly and\r\nneedy will be preserved.\r\n\r\nSecond, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as\r\nwe near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional\r\ncorps. National security is government's first responsibility; so in past\r\nyears defense spending took about half the Federal budget. Today it takes\r\nless than a third. We've already reduced our planned defense expenditures\r\nby nearly a hundred billion dollars over the past 4 years and reduced\r\nprojected spending again this year.\r\n\r\nYou know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time of\r\ndanger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy. Spending for defense\r\nis investing in things that are priceless--peace and freedom.\r\n\r\nThird, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies. For\r\nexample, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares,\r\nbut on Amtrak taxpayers pay about $35 per passenger every time an Amtrak\r\ntrain leaves the station, It's time we ended this huge Federal subsidy.\r\n\r\nOur farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years. Yet I know from\r\nvisiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an orderly\r\ntransition to a market-oriented farm economy. We can help farmers best not\r\nby expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental reforms, keeping\r\ninterest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign trade barriers to\r\nAmerican farm exports.\r\n\r\nWe're moving ahead with Grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and\r\nimprove government's management practices. In the long run, we must protect\r\nthe taxpayers from government. And I ask again that you pass, as 32 States\r\nhave now called for, an amendment mandating the Federal Government spend no\r\nmore than it takes in. And I ask for the authority, used responsibly by 43\r\nGovernors, to veto individual items in appropriation bills. Senator\r\nMattingly has introduced a bill permitting a 2-year trial run of the\r\nline-item veto. I hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk.\r\n\r\nNearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to a\r\ntime of reckoning. Ours is but a moment in history. But one moment of\r\ncourage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nSound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and\r\nstability. We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board,\r\nseeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping\r\ninterest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth.\r\n\r\nReducing unneeded red tape and regulations, and deregulating the energy,\r\ntransportation, and financial industries have unleashed new competition,\r\ngiving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices. In just\r\none set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.\r\nWe seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring\r\nus closer to energy independence. Consistent with safety standards, we will\r\ncontinue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries, we will\r\nsoon end up legislation--or send up legislation, I should say--to return\r\nConrail to the private sector where it belongs, and we will support further\r\nderegulation of the trucking industry.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar the Federal Government does not take from us, every decision\r\nit does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more\r\nabundant, our future more free.\r\n\r\nOur second American revolution will push on to new possibilities not only\r\non Earth but in the next frontier of space. Despite budget restraints, we\r\nwill seek record funding for research and development.\r\n\r\nWe've seen the success of the space shuttle. Now we're going to develop a\r\npermanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise,\r\nbecause in the next decade Americans and our friends around the world will\r\nbe living and working together in space.\r\n\r\nIn the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving\r\nmedicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth. We can make crystals of\r\nexceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs, technologies,\r\nand medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible.\r\n\r\nAs we do all this, we'll continue to protect our natural resources. We will\r\nseek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program to\r\ncontinue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and\r\nthe environment.\r\n\r\nNow, there's another great heritage to speak of this evening. Of all the\r\nchanges that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greater\r\npromise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work,\r\nand neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship;\r\nrenewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered by\r\nour young, who are leading the way. We've rediscovered that work is good in\r\nand of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how\r\nseemingly humble our jobs. We've seen a powerful new current from an old\r\nand honorable tradition--American generosity.\r\n\r\nFrom thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food production\r\nin Africa, to millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools,\r\nand communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home, we\r\nhave refound our values. Private sector initiatives are crucial to our\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nI thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious\r\ngroups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups\r\nenjoy. But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a child\r\nstands in a classroom and breathes a prayer. We ask you again, give\r\nchildren back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking of\r\na human life or it isn't. And if it is--and medical technology is\r\nincreasingly showing it is--it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony that\r\nwhile some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cry\r\nout for children to adopt. We have room for these children. We can fill the\r\ncradles of those who want a child to love. And tonight I ask you in the\r\nCongress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn.\r\n\r\nIn the area of education, we're returning to excellence, and again, the\r\nheroes are our people, not government. We're stressing basics of\r\ndiscipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become\r\ncomputer-smart as well. For 20 years scholastic aptitude test scores of our\r\nhigh school students went down, but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3\r\nyears. We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving\r\nparents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for\r\nhard work and achievement through merit pay.\r\n\r\nOf all the changes in the past 20 years, none has more threatened our sense\r\nof national well-being than the explosion of violent crime. One does not\r\nhave to be attacked to be a victim. The woman who must run to her car after\r\nshopping at night is a victim. The couple draping their door with locks and\r\nchains are victims; as is the tired, decent cleaning woman who can't ride a\r\nsubway home without being afraid.\r\n\r\nWe do not seek to violate the rights of defendants. But shouldn't we feel\r\nmore compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime?\r\nFor the first time in 20 years, the crime index has fallen 2 years in a\r\nrow. We've convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them, as well as\r\nleaders of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers.\r\n\r\nBut we must do more. I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact\r\nproposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers\r\nacquire in good faith. These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus\r\nlaws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of\r\nAmericans, the use of the death penalty where necessary.\r\n\r\nThere can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us\r\nare allowed to roam free. It's time we restored domestic tranquility. And\r\nwe mean to do just that.\r\n\r\nJust as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy,\r\nwe're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world.\r\nOur alliances are stronger than ever. Our economy is stronger than ever. We\r\nhave resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world. And all of\r\nthese together are a great force for peace.\r\n\r\nSince 1981 we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms\r\nagreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear\r\narsenals. Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced\r\nthe Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table. Our negotiators must be\r\nable to go to that table with the united support of the American people.\r\nAll of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons\r\nare banned from this Earth forever.\r\n\r\nEach Member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses,\r\nthus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement. Your vote this\r\nspring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to\r\nmaintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms\r\nreductions.\r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years we've believed that no war will be launched as long\r\nas each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike. Well, I\r\nbelieve there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war. It\r\nis a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear\r\ndefense against ballistic missiles. It's the most hopeful possibility of\r\nthe nuclear age. But it's not very well understood.\r\n\r\nSome say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war\r\nin the heavens and on Earth. Now, some say the research would be expensive.\r\nPerhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself. And\r\nsome say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense system\r\nof their own. Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours;\r\na civil defense system, where we have almost none; and a research program\r\ncovering roughly the same areas of technology that we're now exploring. And\r\nfinally some say the research will take a long time. Well, the answer to\r\nthat is: Let's get started.\r\n\r\nHarry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world's hopes\r\nfor peace and human progress \"lie not in measures of defense or in the\r\ncontrol of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and\r\nself-government.\"\r\n\r\nAnd tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: Freedom\r\nis not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of\r\nall God's children. Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today. It\r\nis in homes that freedom built. Victories against poverty are greatest and\r\npeace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, free\r\nspeech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to\r\ncommunicate these ideals everywhere we can. America's economic success is\r\nfreedom's success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred\r\ndifferent nations. Many countries in east Asia and the Pacific have few\r\nresources other than the enterprise of their own people. But through low\r\ntax rates and free markets they've soared ahead of centralized economies.\r\nAnd now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.\r\n\r\nWe need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and\r\nimplementing trade policy, and we'll be studying potential changes in that\r\nprocess in the next few weeks. We've seen the benefits of free trade and\r\nlived through the disasters of protectionism. Tonight I ask all our trading\r\npartners, developed and developing alike, to join us in a new round of\r\ntrade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen the\r\nglobal economy--and to begin it in this next year.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 3 billion human beings living in Third World countries\r\nwith an average per capita income of $650 a year. Many are victims of\r\ndictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption. Let us\r\nask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance\r\nthat fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these\r\npeople climb from poverty on their own.\r\n\r\nWe cannot play innocents abroad in a world that's not innocent; nor can we\r\nbe passive when freedom is under siege. Without resources, diplomacy cannot\r\nsucceed. Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend\r\nthemselves and give them confidence to work for peace. And I hope that you\r\nin the Congress will understand that, dollar for dollar, security\r\nassistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\nWe must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith\r\nwith those who are risking their lives--on every continent, from\r\nAfghanistan to Nicaragua--to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure\r\nrights which have been ours from birth.\r\n\r\nThe Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban-Soviet bloc\r\nsupport, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free\r\npress, but arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists attacking\r\nneighboring states. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and\r\ntotally consistent with the OAS and U.N. Charters. It is essential that the\r\nCongress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America. I want\r\nto work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to\r\nour own security.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight, I've spoken of great plans and great dreams. They're dreams we\r\ncan make come true. Two hundred years of American history should have\r\ntaught us that nothing is impossible.\r\n\r\nTen years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the exodus\r\nthat followed the fall of Saigon. They came to the United States with no\r\npossessions and not knowing a word of English. Ten years ago--the young\r\ngirl studied hard, learned English, and finished high school in the top of\r\nher class. And this May, May 22d to be exact, is a big date on her\r\ncalendar. Just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate\r\nfrom the United States Military Academy at West Point. I thought you might\r\nlike to meet an American hero named Jean Nguyen.\r\n\r\nNow, there's someone else here tonight, born 79 years ago. She lives in the\r\ninner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin\r\naddicts. The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even dropped on\r\nher doorstep. She helps them with love. Go to her house some night, and\r\nmaybe you'll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor\r\ntalking softly, soothing a child in her arms--Mother Hale of Harlem, and\r\nshe, too, is an American hero.\r\n\r\nJean, Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is\r\nnew again: Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the will,\r\nand the heart. History is asking us once again to be a force for good in\r\nthe world. Let us begin in unity, with justice, and love.\r\n\r\nThank you, and God bless you.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:05 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio\r\nand television.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRonald Reagan\r\nFebruary 4, 1986\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored\r\nguests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing me to delay my address until this evening. We paused\r\ntogether to mourn and honor the valor of our seven Challenger heroes. And I\r\nhope that we are now ready to do what they would want us to do: Go forward,\r\nAmerica, and reach for the stars. We will never forget those brave seven,\r\nbut we shall go forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out that\r\ntonight marks the 10th and last State of the Union Message that you've\r\npresided over. And on behalf of the American people, I want to salute you\r\nfor your service to Congress and country. Here's to you!\r\n\r\nI have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of\r\nunfinished work, and to set our sights on the future. I am pleased to\r\nreport the state of our Union is stronger than a year ago and growing\r\nstronger each day. Tonight we look out on a rising America, firm of heart,\r\nunited in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism. America is on the move!\r\nBut it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land: locked\r\nfactory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices, and interest rates\r\nturning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams.\r\nGovernment growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant,\r\nslamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots\r\nof our freedom. What brought America back? The American people brought us\r\nback with quiet courage and common sense, with undying faith that in this\r\nnation under God the future will be ours; for the future belongs to the\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nTonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of\r\neconomic growth, for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9\r\nmillion new jobs in 3 years, interest rates cut in half, inflation falling\r\nover from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today, and a mighty river of good\r\nworks--a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone. And\r\ndespite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain the\r\nmoral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for the\r\nfuture. Family and community are the costars of this great American\r\ncomeback. They are why we say tonight: Private values must be at the heart\r\nof public policies.\r\n\r\nWhat is true for families in America is true for America in the family of\r\nfree nations. History is no captive of some inevitable force. History is\r\nmade by men and women of vision and courage. Tonight freedom is on the\r\nmarch. The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which the\r\nworld once again turns. We stand for an idea whose time is now: Only by\r\nlifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and\r\ncan peace among all nations be secure. Teddy Roosevelt said that a nation\r\nthat does great work lives forever. We have done well, but we cannot stop\r\nat the foothills when Everest beckons. It's time for America to be all that\r\nwe can be.\r\n\r\nWe speak tonight of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer, more\r\nsecure world. And we speak about the necessity for actions to steel us for\r\nthe challenges of growth, trade, and security in the next decade and the\r\nyear 2000. And we will do it--not by breaking faith with bedrock principles\r\nbut by breaking free from failed policies. Let us begin where storm clouds\r\nloom darkest--right here in Washington, DC. This week I will send you our\r\ndetailed proposals; tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine\r\ngovernment's role: not to control, not to demand or command, not to contain\r\nus, but to help in times of need and, above all, to create a ladder of\r\nopportunity to full employment so that all Americans can climb toward\r\neconomic power and justice on their own.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can't\r\neven pass a Federal budget. We cannot win that race held back by\r\nhorse-and-buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human\r\npotential. We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink.\r\nNow, Mr. Speaker, you know, I know, and the American people know the\r\nFederal budget system is broken. It doesn't work. Before we leave this\r\ncity, let's you and I work together to fix it, and then we can finally give\r\nthe American people a balanced budget.\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress, passage of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings gives us an historic\r\nopportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades:\r\nforcing the Federal Government to live within its means. Your schedule now\r\nrequires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th, the very day\r\nAmerica's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce.\r\nHow often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling from\r\npaycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxes\r\nand bills. And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised. Well, I'm\r\nsorry; they're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts. It's time we\r\nreduce the Federal budget and left the family budget alone. We do not face\r\nlarge deficits because American families are undertaxed; we face those\r\ndeficits because the Federal Government overspends.\r\n\r\nThe detailed budget that we will submit will meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings\r\ntarget for deficit reductions, meet our commitment to ensure a strong\r\nnational defense, meet our commitment to protect Social Security and the\r\ntruly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our commitment to not raise taxes. How\r\nshould we accomplish this? Well, not by taking from those in need. As\r\nfamilies take care of their own, government must provide shelter and\r\nnourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves. But we must revise\r\nor replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the\r\nmoral worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entire\r\ncommunities into a bleak and heartless dependency. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings\r\ncan mark a dramatic improvement. But experience shows that simply setting\r\ndeficit targets does not assure they'll be met. We must proceed with Grace\r\ncommission reforms against waste.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I ask you to give me what 43 Governors have: Give me a\r\nline-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll\r\ntake the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat. This\r\nauthority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent spending\r\nmeasures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit. And\r\nyou can sustain or override my veto; that's the way the system should work.\r\nOnce we've made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains with a\r\nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense. We must\r\nmeet it. Defense is not just another budget expense. Keeping America\r\nstrong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the Federal\r\nGovernment; it is government's prime responsibility. We have devoted 5\r\nyears trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect, and\r\nwe've made important gains. Yet the threat from Soviet forces, conventional\r\nand strategic, from the Soviet drive for domination, from the increase in\r\nespionage and state terror remains great. This is reality. Closing our eyes\r\nwill not make reality disappear. We pledged together to hold real growth in\r\ndefense spending to the bare minimum. My budget honors that pledge, and I'm\r\nnow asking you, the Congress, to keep its end of the bargain. The Soviets\r\nmust know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a\r\nreduced threat, not a reduced resolve.\r\n\r\nKeeping America strong is as vital to the national security as controlling\r\nFederal spending is to our economic security. But, as I have said before,\r\nthe most powerful force we can enlist against the Federal deficit is an\r\never-expanding American economy, unfettered and free. The magic of\r\nopportunity--unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained--isn't this the calling\r\nthat unites us? I believe our tax rate cuts for the people have done more\r\nto spur a spirit of risk-taking and help America's economy break free than\r\nany program since John Kennedy's tax cut almost a quarter century ago.\r\n\r\nNow history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic tax\r\nreform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay their\r\nfair share, but no more. We've come this far. Will you join me now, and\r\nwe'll walk this last mile together? You know my views on this. We cannot\r\nand we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise. True\r\nreform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and that means a top\r\npersonal rate no higher than 35 percent. True reform must be truly fair,\r\nand that means raising personal exemptions to $2,000. True reform means a\r\ntax system that at long last is profamily, projobs, profuture, and\r\npro-America.\r\n\r\nAs we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts for\r\nfreer and fairer trade. We have already taken actions to counter unfair\r\ntrading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets. We will continue\r\nto do so. We will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection\r\nthat in reality pits one American worker against another, one industry\r\nagainst another, one community against another, and that raises prices for\r\nus all. If the United States can trade with other nations on a level\r\nplaying field, we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anywhere\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and\r\nstable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world. We must\r\nnever again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other\r\nexporters. Farmers, in particular, have suffered from past unwise\r\ngovernment policies. They must not be abandoned with problems they did not\r\ncreate and cannot control. We've begun coordinating economic and monetary\r\npolicy among our major trading partners. But there's more to do, and\r\ntonight I am directing Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to determine if the\r\nnations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of\r\nour currencies.\r\n\r\nConfident in our future and secure in our values, Americans are striving\r\nforward to embrace the future. We see it not only in our recovery but in 3\r\nstraight years of falling crime rates, as families and communities band\r\ntogether to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness and to give back to\r\ntheir children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they deserve. We see\r\nit in the renaissance in education, the rising SAT scores for 3 years--last\r\nyear's increase, the greatest since 1963. It wasn't government and\r\nWashington lobbies that turned education around; it was the American people\r\nwho, in reaching for excellence, knew to reach back to basics. We must\r\ncontinue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools, vouchers that\r\ngive parents freedom of choice; and we must give back to our children their\r\nlost right to acknowledge God in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nWe are a nation of idealists, yet today there is a wound in our national\r\nconscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life\r\ngranted by our Creator is denied to the unborn. For the rest of my time, I\r\nshall do what I can to see that this wound is one day healed.\r\n\r\nAs we work to make the American dream real for all, we must also look to\r\nthe condition of America's families. Struggling parents today worry how\r\nthey will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave\r\nthem. In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic\r\nsupport system, has reached crisis proportions--in female and child\r\npoverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools.\r\nAfter hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of\r\nthe poor grows more painful. But the waste in dollars and cents pales\r\nbefore the most tragic loss: the sinful waste of human spirit and\r\npotential. We can ignore this terrible truth no longer. As Franklin\r\nRoosevelt warned 51 years ago, standing before this Chamber, he said,\r\n\"Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.\" And we\r\nmust now escape the spider's web of dependency.\r\n\r\nTonight I am charging the White House Domestic Council to present me by\r\nDecember 1, 1986, an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate\r\naction to meet the financial, educational, social, and safety concerns of\r\npoor families. I'm talking about real and lasting emancipation, because the\r\nsuccess of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become\r\nindependent of welfare. Further, after seeing how devastating illness can\r\ndestroy the financial security of the family, I am directing the Secretary\r\nof Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis Bowen, to report to me by year end\r\nwith recommendations on how the private sector and government can work\r\ntogether to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose\r\nlife savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness\r\nstrikes.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I want to speak directly to America's younger generation,\r\nbecause you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands. With all the\r\ntemptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of the\r\npermissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control. But the call\r\nof the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in the\r\nblind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair. Never has there been a\r\nmore exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic\r\nachievement. As they said in the film \"Back to the Future,\" \"Where we're\r\ngoing, we don't need roads.\"\r\n\r\nWell, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of\r\nsubatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith. Astronomers\r\nbuild a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and\r\npossibly back to the moment of creation. So, yes, this nation remains fully\r\ncommitted to America's space program. We're going forward with our shuttle\r\nflights. We're going forward to build our space station. And we are going\r\nforward with research on a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the\r\nnext decade, take off from Dulles Airport, accelerate up to 25 times the\r\nspeed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within 2\r\nhours. And the same technology transforming our lives can solve the\r\ngreatest problem of the 20th century. A security shield can one day render\r\nnuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear\r\nterror. America met one historic challenge and went to the Moon. Now\r\nAmerica must meet another: to make our strategic defense real for all the\r\ncitizens of planet Earth.\r\n\r\nLet us speak of our deepest longing for the future: to leave our children a\r\nland that is free and just and a world at peace. It is my hope that our\r\nfireside summit in Geneva and Mr. Gorbachev's upcoming visit to America can\r\nlead to a more stable relationship. Surely no people on Earth hate war or\r\nlove peace more than we Americans. But we cannot stroll into the future\r\nwith childlike faith. Our differences with a system that openly proclaims\r\nand practices an alleged right to command people's lives and to export its\r\nideology by force are deep and abiding. Logic and history compel us to\r\naccept that our relationship be guided by realism--rock-hard, cleareyed,\r\nsteady, and sure. Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut in\r\noffensive forces by each side with no cheating. They have made clear that\r\nSoviet compliance with the letter and spirit of agreements is essential. If\r\nthe Soviet Government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms,\r\nthere will be such an agreement.\r\n\r\nBut arms control is no substitute for peace. We know that peace follows in\r\nfreedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied.\r\nSo, we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by\r\nbolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we can.\r\nWe advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf of\r\nlower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the world. We\r\nstrengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come to\r\nthe aid of friends under siege. And we can enlarge the family of free\r\nnations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all God's children to\r\nfollow their dreams.\r\n\r\nTo those imprisoned in regimes held captive, to those beaten for daring to\r\nfight for freedom and democracy--for their right to worship, to speak, to\r\nlive, and to prosper in the family of free nations--we say to you tonight:\r\nYou are not alone, freedom fighters. America will support with moral and\r\nmaterial assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but to\r\nfight and win freedom--to win freedom in Afghanistan, in Angola, in\r\nCambodia, and in Nicaragua. This is a great moral challenge for the entire\r\nfree world.\r\n\r\nSurely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the\r\nsecurity of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests, than\r\nto achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua's democratic\r\nneighbors. This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what\r\nmust be done for that great and good cause. As (former Senator Henry\r\nM.)Scoop Jackson, the inspiration for our Bipartisan Commission on Central\r\nAmerica, once said, \"In matters of national security, the best politics is\r\nno politics.\"\r\n\r\nWhat we accomplish this year, in each challenge we face, will set our\r\ncourse for the balance of the decade, indeed, for the remainder of the\r\ncentury. After all we've done so far, let no one say that this nation\r\ncannot reach the destiny of our dreams. America believes, America is ready,\r\nAmerica can win the race to the future--and we shall. The American dream is\r\na song of hope that rings through night winter air; vivid, tender music\r\nthat warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest\r\nthings: to venture a daring enterprise; to unearth new beauty in music,\r\nliterature, and art; to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip\r\nor a single human cell.\r\n\r\nWe see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli.\r\nAll his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine. And,\r\nRichard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school was\r\nlaunched and lost last week, yet your dream lives. And as long as it's\r\nreal, work of noble note will yet be done, work that could reduce the\r\nharmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the\r\ngolden gateways of the farthest stars.\r\n\r\nWe see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old, Tyrone Ford.\r\nA child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity to\r\nbecome an accomplished pianist and singer. He also directs the choirs of\r\nthree churches and has performed at the Kennedy Center. With God as your\r\ncomposer, Tyrone, your music will be the music of angels.\r\n\r\nWe see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13-year-old Shelby\r\nButler, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol. Seeing\r\nanother girl freeze in terror before an out-of-control school bus, she\r\nrisked her life and pulled her to safety. With bravery like yours, Shelby,\r\nAmerica need never fear for our future.\r\n\r\nAnd we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year old,\r\nTrevor Ferrell. Two years ago, age 11, watching men and women bedding down\r\nin abandoned doorways--on television he was watching--Trevor left his\r\nsuburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and\r\nhomeless. And now 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil. Trevor,\r\nyours is the living spirit of brotherly love.\r\n\r\nWould you four stand up for a moment? Thank you, thank you. You are heroes\r\nof our hearts. We look at you and know it's true: In this land of dreams\r\nfulfilled, where greater dreams may be imagined, nothing is impossible, no\r\nvictory is beyond our reach, no glory will ever be too great.\r\n\r\nSo, now it's up to us, all of us, to prepare America for that day when our\r\nwork will pale before the greatness of America's champions in the 21st\r\ncentury. The world's hopes rest with America's future; America's hopes rest\r\nwith us. So, let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, in\r\nunity, and in love.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, and God bless America.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 8:04 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio\r\nand television.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRonald Reagan\r\nJanuary 27, 1987\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored\r\nguests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nMay I congratulate all of you who are Members of this historic 100th\r\nCongress of the United States of America. In this 200th anniversary year of\r\nour Constitution, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants--men whose\r\nwords and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom. However, we must always\r\nremember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but\r\nfor being young--young with the same energy, spirit, and promise that\r\nfilled each eventful day in Philadelphia's statehouse. We will be guided\r\ntonight by their acts, and we will be guided forever by their words.\r\n\r\nNow, forgive me, but I can't resist sharing a story from those historic\r\ndays. Philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787, and\r\nits newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the Convention delegates\r\nwith elaborate social classifications. Governors of States were called\r\nExcellency. Justices and Chancellors had reserved for them honorable with a\r\ncapital \"H.\" For Congressmen, it was honorable with a small \"h.\" And all\r\nothers were referred to as \"the following respectable characters.\" Well,\r\nfor this 100th Congress, I invoke special executive powers to declare that\r\neach of you must never be titled less than honorable with a capital \"H.\"\r\nIncidentally, I'm delighted you are celebrating the 100th birthday of the\r\nCongress. It's always a pleasure to congratulate someone with more\r\nbirthdays than I've had.\r\n\r\nNow, there's a new face at this place of honor tonight. And please join me\r\nin warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House, Jim Wright. Mr.\r\nSpeaker, you might recall a similar situation in your very first session of\r\nCongress 32 years ago. Then, as now, the speakership had changed hands and\r\nanother great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn--\"Mr. Sam\"--sat in your chair. I\r\ncannot find better words than those used by President Eisenhower that\r\nevening. He said, \"We shall have much to do together; I am sure that we\r\nwill get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and good will.\" Tonight\r\nI renew that pledge. To you, Mr. Speaker, and to Senate Majority Leader\r\nRobert Byrd, who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the Congress,\r\nmay I say: Though there are changes in the Congress, America's interests\r\nremain the same. And I am confident that, along with Republican leaders Bob\r\nMichel and Bob Dole, this Congress can make history.\r\n\r\nSix years ago I was here to ask the Congress to join me in America's new\r\nbeginning. Well, the results are something of which we can all be proud.\r\nOur inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century. The prime\r\ninterest rate has fallen from the 21 1/2 percent the month before we took\r\noffice to 7 1/2 percent today. And those rates have triggered the most\r\nhousing starts in 8 years. The unemployment rate--still too high--is the\r\nlowest in nearly 7 years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new\r\njobs. Over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16, male and female, is\r\nemployed--the highest percentage on record. Let's roll up our sleeves and\r\ngo to work and put America's economic engine at full throttle. We can also\r\nbe heartened by our progress across the world. Most important, America is\r\nat peace tonight, and freedom is on the march. And we've done much these\r\npast years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in\r\nthe world. Our sons and daughters in the services once again wear their\r\nuniforms with pride.\r\n\r\nBut though we've made much progress, I have one major regret: I took a risk\r\nwith regard to our action in Iran. It did not work, and for that I assume\r\nfull responsibility. The goals were worthy. I do not believe it was wrong\r\nto try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to\r\ntry to save lives. And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom\r\nfor our citizens held in barbaric captivity. But we did not achieve what we\r\nwished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. We will get to\r\nthe bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for. But in\r\ndebating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future.\r\nLet it never be said of this generation of Americans that we became so\r\nobsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the\r\ncause of peace and freedom in the world. Much is at stake here, and the\r\nNation and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in the\r\nnational interest or if we let partisanship weaken us. And let there be no\r\nmistake about American policy: We will not sit idly by if our interests or\r\nour friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield to\r\nterrorist blackmail.\r\n\r\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don't we get to work? I\r\nam pleased to report that because of our efforts to rebuild the strength of\r\nAmerica, the world is a safer place. Earlier this month I submitted a\r\nbudget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect\r\nin the last decade. Well, I ask you to vote out a defense and foreign\r\naffairs budget that says yes to protecting our country. While the world is\r\nsafer, it is not safe.\r\n\r\nSince 1970 the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military\r\nforces than we have. Even today, though nearly 1 in 3 Soviet families is\r\nwithout running hot water and the average family spends 2 hours a day\r\nshopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found\r\nthe resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the\r\npast 5 years--clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia,\r\nAfghanistan, and Nicaragua. With 120,000 Soviet combat and military\r\npersonnel and 15,000 military advisers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,\r\ncan anyone still doubt their single-minded determination to expand their\r\npower? Despite this, the Congress cut my request for critical U.S. security\r\nassistance to free nations by 21 percent this year, and cut defense\r\nrequests by $85 billion in the last 3 years.\r\n\r\nThese assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual\r\ninterests. And when the programs are devastated, American interests are\r\nharmed. My friends, it's my duty as President to say to you again tonight\r\nthat there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve. Today\r\nthe brave people of Afghanistan are showing that resolve. The Soviet Union\r\nsays it wants a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, yet it continues a\r\nbrutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. We are\r\nready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal\r\nof all Soviet troops and genuine self-determination for the Afghan people.\r\n\r\nIn Central America, too, the cause of freedom is being tested. And our\r\nresolve is being tested there as well. Here, especially, the world is\r\nwatching to see how this nation responds. Today over 90 percent of the\r\npeople of Latin America live in democracy. Democracy is on the march in\r\nCentral and South America. Communist Nicaragua is the odd man\r\nout--suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent and\r\npromoting subversion in the region. We support diplomatic efforts, but\r\nthese efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war against\r\nthe Nicaraguan people.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to a Western Hemisphere safe from aggression did not occur\r\nby spontaneous generation on the day that we took office. It began with the\r\nMonroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan American\r\npolicy. Franklin Roosevelt said we \"are determined to do everything\r\npossible to maintain peace on this hemisphere.\" President Truman was very\r\nblunt: \"International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy\r\nthe independence of the Americas. We cannot let that happen here.\" And John\r\nF. Kennedy made clear that \"Communist domination in this hemisphere can\r\nnever be negotiated.\" Some in this Congress may choose to depart from this\r\nhistoric commitment, but I will not.\r\n\r\nThis year we celebrate the second century of our Constitution. The\r\nSandinistas just signed theirs 2 weeks ago, and then suspended it. We won't\r\nknow how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple reason:\r\nThere is no free press in Nicaragua. Nicaraguan freedom fighters have never\r\nasked us to wage their battle, but I will fight any effort to shut off\r\ntheir lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without\r\nfreedom. There must be no Soviet beachhead in Central America.\r\n\r\nYou know, we Americans have always preferred dialog to conflict, and so, we\r\nalways remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet Union.\r\nBut more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key element of\r\nthe U.S.-Soviet agenda. Progress is also required on the other items of our\r\nagenda as well--real respect for human rights and more open contacts\r\nbetween our societies and, of course, arms reduction.\r\n\r\nIn Iceland, last October, we had one moment of opportunity that the Soviets\r\ndashed because they sought to cripple our Strategic Defense Initiative,\r\nSDI. I wouldn't let them do it then; I won't let them do it now or in the\r\nfuture. This is the most positive and promising defense program we have\r\nundertaken. It's the path, for both sides, to a safer future--a system that\r\ndefends human life instead of threatening it. SDI will go forward. The\r\nUnited States has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the\r\nSoviet Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction.\r\nBut I will need, and American negotiators in Geneva will need, Congress'\r\nsupport. Enacting the Soviet negotiating position into American law would\r\nnot be the way to win a good agreement. So, I must tell you in this\r\nCongress I will veto any effort that undercuts our national security and\r\nour negotiating leverage.\r\n\r\nNow, today, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerce\r\nacross the world. We will work to expand our opportunities in international\r\nmarkets through the Uruguay round of trade negotiations and to complete an\r\nhistoric free trade arrangement between the world's two largest trading\r\npartners, Canada and the United States. Our basic trade policy remains the\r\nsame: We remain opposed as ever to protectionism, because America's growth\r\nand future depend on trade. But we would insist on trade that is fair and\r\nfree. We are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies.\r\n\r\nNow, from foreign borders let us return to our own, because America in the\r\nworld is only as strong as America at home. This 100th Congress has high\r\nresponsibilities. I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are\r\nsimply the incomplete obligations of the past. The American people deserve\r\nto be impatient, because we do not yet have the public house in order.\r\nWe've had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we've\r\nrescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the Depression. But\r\nthere's more to do. For starters, the Federal deficit is outrageous. For\r\nyears I've asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of our\r\ngovernment. And what the Congress finally needs to do is pass a\r\nconstitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces\r\ngovernment to live within its means. States, cities, and the families of\r\nAmerica balance their budgets. Why can't we?\r\n\r\nNext, the budget process is a sorry spectacle. The missing of deadlines and\r\nthe nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of\r\nbillions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. We ask the\r\nCongress once again: Give us the same tool that 43 Governors have--a\r\nlineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork, those items\r\nthat would never survive on their own. I will send the Congress broad\r\nrecommendations on the budget, but first I'd like to see yours. Let's go to\r\nwork and get this done together.\r\n\r\nBut now let's talk about this year's budget. Even though I have submitted\r\nit within the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction target, I have seen\r\nsuggestions that we might postpone that timetable. Well, I think the\r\nAmerican people are tired of hearing the same old excuses. Together we made\r\na commitment to balance the budget. Now let's keep it. As for those\r\nsuggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the American people have\r\nrepeatedly rejected that shop-worn advice. They know that we don't have\r\ndeficits because people are taxed too little. We have deficits because big\r\ngovernment spends too much.\r\n\r\nNow, next month I'll place two additional reforms before the Congress.\r\nWe've created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense\r\nof priorities. Our national welfare system consists of some 59 major\r\nprograms and over 6,000 pages of Federal laws and regulations on which more\r\nthan $132 billion was spent in 1985. I will propose a new national welfare\r\nstrategy, a program of welfare reform through State-sponsored,\r\ncommunity-based demonstration projects. This is the time to reform this\r\noutmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap. Now, we will\r\nnever abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help.\r\nBut let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare\r\nand made self-supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipients\r\nwant more than anything else. Next, let us remove a financial specter\r\nfacing our older Americans: the fear of an illness so expensive that it can\r\nresult in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and\r\ndeath. I will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the\r\nfear of catastrophic illness.\r\n\r\nNow let's turn to the future. It's widely said that America is losing her\r\ncompetitive edge. Well, that won't happen if we act now. How well prepared\r\nare we to enter the 21st century? In my lifetime, America set the standard\r\nfor the world. It is now time to determine that we should enter the next\r\ncentury having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history. We\r\nwill achieve this, first, by guaranteeing that government does everything\r\npossible to promote America's ability to compete. Second, we must act as\r\nindividuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new\r\nproposals or billions in new funding. Rather, it involves an expenditure of\r\nAmerican spirit and just plain American grit. The Congress will soon\r\nreceive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness,\r\nincluding new science and technology centers and strong new funding for\r\nbasic research. The bill will include legal and regulatory reforms and\r\nweapons to fight unfair trade practices. Competitiveness also means giving\r\nour farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nPreparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children. We need\r\nto set for them new and more rigorous goals. We must demand more of\r\nourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the\r\nyear 2000. Our children should master the basic concepts of math and\r\nscience, and let's insist that students not leave high school until they\r\nhave studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage.\r\nThere's one more thing we can't let up on: Let's redouble our personal\r\nefforts to provide for every child a safe and drug-free learning\r\nenvironment. If our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, we\r\nwill defeat that scourge all over the country.\r\n\r\nFinally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being.\r\nOur nation could not have been conceived without divine help. Why is it\r\nthat we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can't use a schoolroom\r\nfor voluntary prayer? The 100th Congress of the United States should be\r\nremembered as the one that ended the expulsion of God from America's\r\nclassrooms.\r\n\r\nThe quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom but\r\nmust go next to the workplace. More than 20 million new jobs will be\r\ncreated before the new century unfolds, and by then, our economy should be\r\nable to provide a job for everyone who wants to work. We must also enable\r\nour workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace. And I\r\nwill propose substantial, new Federal commitments keyed to retraining and\r\njob mobility.\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks, I'll be sending the Congress a complete series of\r\nthese special messages--on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness,\r\nincluding education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture,\r\nand other subjects. The Congress can give us these tools, but to make these\r\ntools work, it really comes down to just being our best. And that is the\r\ncore of American greatness. The responsibility of freedom presses us\r\ntowards higher knowledge and, I believe, moral and spiritual greatness.\r\nThrough lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of\r\nfreeing people's spirits. But only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar\r\nagainst our own individual standards. Excellence is what makes freedom\r\nring. And isn't that what we do best?\r\n\r\nWe're entering our third century now, but it's wrong to judge our nation by\r\nits years. The calendar can't measure America because we were meant to be\r\nan endless experiment in freedom--with no limit to our reaches, no\r\nboundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes. The United States\r\nConstitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel\r\nthrough history. It grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our\r\nexistence: that we are here to serve Him by living free--that living free\r\nreleases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities; that\r\nwe would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would secure\r\nthem not just for ourselves and for our children but for all mankind.\r\n\r\nOver the years--I won't count if you don't--nothing has been so\r\nheartwarming to me as speaking to America's young, and the little ones\r\nespecially, so fresh-faced and so eager to know. Well, from time to time\r\nI've been with them--they will ask about our Constitution. And I hope you\r\nMembers of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you'll\r\npermit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be\r\nlistening or watching this evening. I've read the constitutions of a number\r\nof countries, including the Soviet Union's. Now, some people are surprised\r\nto hear that they have a constitution, and it even supposedly grants a\r\nnumber of freedoms to its people. Many countries have written into their\r\nconstitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\r\nWell, if this is true, why is the Constitution of the United States so\r\nexceptional?\r\n\r\nWell, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it's so\r\ngreat it tells you the whole story in just three words: We the people. In\r\nthose other constitutions, the Government tells the people of those\r\ncountries what they're allowed to do. In our Constitution, we the people\r\ntell the Government what it can do, and it can do only those things listed\r\nin that document and no others. Virtually every other revolution in history\r\nhas just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. Our\r\nrevolution is the first to say the people are the masters and government is\r\ntheir servant. And you young people out there, don't ever forget that.\r\nSomeday you could be in this room, but wherever you are, America is\r\ndepending on you to reach your highest and be your best--because here in\r\nAmerica, we the people are in charge.\r\n\r\nJust three words: We the people--those are the kids on Christmas Day\r\nlooking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in Korea or\r\naboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. A million miles from home,\r\nbut doing their duty.\r\n\r\nWe the people--those are the warmhearted whose numbers we can't begin to\r\ncount, who'll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will\r\nnever know and MIA families they will never meet. Why? Because that's the\r\nway we are, this unique breed we call Americans.\r\n\r\nWe the people--they're farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a\r\nhungry world. They're the volunteers at the hospital choking back their\r\ntears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life because\r\nof a mother who used drugs. And you'll forgive me a special memory--it's a\r\nmillion mothers like Nelle Reagan who never knew a stranger or turned a\r\nhungry person away from her kitchen door.\r\n\r\nWe the people--they refute last week's television commentary downgrading\r\nour optimism and our idealism. They are the entrepreneurs, the builders,\r\nthe pioneers, and a lot of regular folks--the true heroes of our land who\r\nmake up the most uncommon nation of doers in history. You know they're\r\nAmericans because their spirit is as big as the universe and their hearts\r\nare bigger than their spirits.\r\n\r\nWe the people--starting the third century of a dream and standing up to\r\nsome cynic who's trying to tell us we're not going to get any better. Are\r\nwe at the end? Well, I can't tell it any better than the real thing--a\r\nstory recorded by James Madison from the final moments of the\r\nConstitutional Convention, September 17th, 1787. As the last few members\r\nsigned the document, Benjamin Franklin--the oldest delegate at 81 years and\r\nin frail health--looked over toward the chair where George Washington daily\r\npresided. At the back of the chair was painted the picture of a Sun on the\r\nhorizon. And turning to those sitting next to him, Franklin observed that\r\nartists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a\r\nrising and a setting Sun.\r\n\r\nWell, I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around\r\nFranklin--leaning in to listen more closely to him. And then Dr. Franklin\r\nbegan to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their\r\nefforts, and this is what he said: \"I have often looked at that picture\r\nbehind the President without being able to tell whether it was a rising or\r\nsetting Sun: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a\r\nrising and not a setting Sun.\" Well, you can bet it's rising because, my\r\nfellow citizens, America isn't finished. Her best days have just begun.\r\n\r\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:03 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nThe address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRonald Reagan\r\nJanuary 25, 1988\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and\r\nSenate: When we first met here 7 years ago--many of us for the first\r\ntime--it was with the hope of beginning something new for America. We meet\r\nhere tonight in this historic Chamber to continue that work. If anyone\r\nexpects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my\r\nadministration, I say let's leave that to history; we're not finished yet.\r\nSo, my message to you tonight is put on your work shoes; we're still on the\r\njob.\r\n\r\nHistory records the power of the ideas that brought us here those 7 years\r\nago--ideas like the individual's right to reach as far and as high as his or\r\nher talents will permit; the free market as an engine of economic progress.\r\nAnd as an ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao-tzu, said: \"Govern a great\r\nnation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo it.\" Well, these ideas\r\nwere part of a larger notion, a vision, if you will, of America\r\nherself--an America not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an\r\nAmerica, too, of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods; an America\r\nwhose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper\r\ncommunity of values: the value of work, of family, of religion, and of the\r\nlove of freedom that God places in each of us and whose defense He has\r\nentrusted in a special way to this nation.\r\n\r\nAll of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev was\r\nhere--the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind\r\nbegan with three simple words: \"We the People,\" the revolutionary notion\r\nthat the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around.\r\nAnd there's one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which I would\r\noffer to you now. Just as those who created this Republic pledged to each\r\nother their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too,\r\nAmerica's leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep\r\nforemost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our\r\nparty but what is best for America.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of Jefferson, let us affirm that in this Chamber tonight\r\nthere are no Republicans, no Democrats--just Americans. Yes, we will have\r\nour differences, but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs\r\nwhatever divides us. Those who sent us here to serve them--the millions of\r\nAmericans watching and listening tonight--expect this of us. Let's prove to\r\nthem and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year. We've\r\ndone this before. And as we have worked together to bring down spending,\r\ntax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; America\r\nhas created more jobs and better, higher paying jobs; family income has\r\nrisen for 4 straight years, and America's poor climbed out of poverty at\r\nthe fastest rate in more than 10 years.\r\n\r\nOur record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an\r\neconomic and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives, growth,\r\nand opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector\r\ninitiatives and a 77-percent increase in charitable giving; a revolution\r\nthat at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the\r\nAmerican dream.\r\n\r\nIn international relations, too, there's only one description for what,\r\ntogether, we have achieved: a complete turnabout, a revolution. Seven years\r\nago, America was weak, and freedom everywhere was under siege. Today\r\nAmerica is strong, and democracy is everywhere on the move. From Central\r\nAmerica to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and\r\nhuman rights are taking hold. We've replaced \"Blame America\" with \"Look up\r\nto America.\" We've rebuilt our defenses. And of all our accomplishments,\r\nnone can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are\r\nagain proud to wear our country's uniform.\r\n\r\nAnd in a few moments, I'm going to talk about three developments--arms\r\nreduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic\r\nrevolution--that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have\r\ndared imagine 7 years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great\r\nnightmares of the postwar era. I speak of the startling hope of giving our\r\nchildren a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.\r\n\r\nTonight, then, we're strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. This is\r\nthe state of our Union. And if we will work together this year, I believe\r\nwe can give a future President and a future Congress the chance to make\r\nthat prosperity, that peace, that freedom not just the state of our Union\r\nbut the state of our world.\r\n\r\nToward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. First, steps we can\r\ntake this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children\r\na future of low inflation and full employment. Second, let's check our\r\nprogress in attacking social problems, where important gains have been\r\nmade, but which still need critical attention. I mean schools that work,\r\neconomic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and\r\nfamily values. Our third objective tonight is global: continuing the\r\nexciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world.\r\nFourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade\r\nand a half, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world\r\nfreedom. We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next\r\nPresident inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give that\r\nPresident: a national security that is unassailable and a national defense\r\nthat takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded.\r\n\r\nThis is a full agenda. It's meant to be. You see, my thinking on the next\r\nyear is quite simple: Let's make this the best of 8. And that means it's\r\nall out--right to the finish line. I don't buy the idea that this is the\r\nlast year of anything, because we're not talking here tonight about\r\nregistering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our successes. And\r\nthat's why our focus is the values, the principles, and ideas that made\r\nAmerica great. Let's be clear on this point. We're for limited government,\r\nbecause we understand, as the Founding Fathers did, that it is the best way\r\nof ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every\r\nAmerican of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of American\r\nprosperity and freedom.\r\n\r\nOne other thing we Americans like--the future--like the sound of it, the\r\nidea of it, the hope of it. Where others fear trade and economic growth, we\r\nsee opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities\r\nfor millions in our own land and beyond. Where others seek to throw up\r\nbarriers, we seek to bring them down. Where others take counsel of their\r\nfears, we follow our hopes. Yes, we Americans like the future and like\r\nmaking the most of it. Let's do that now.\r\n\r\nAnd let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by\r\ncontrolling and eventually eliminating the problem of Federal deficits. We\r\nhave had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years. For the\r\nfirst time in 14 years, the Federal Government spent less in real terms\r\nlast year than the year before. We took $73 billion off last year's deficit\r\ncompared to the year before. The deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percent\r\nof the gross national product to only 3.4 percent. And perhaps the most\r\nimportant sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits. You\r\nknow, a few of us can remember when, not too many years ago, those who\r\ncreated the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry\r\nabout the debt, because we owe it to ourselves. Well, at last there is\r\nagreement that we can't spend ourselves rich.\r\n\r\nOur recent budget agreement, designed to reduce Federal deficits by $76\r\nbillion over the next 2 years, builds on this consensus. But this agreement\r\nmust be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past: more\r\nbroken promises and more unchecked spending. As I indicated in my first\r\nState of the Union, what ails us can be simply put: The Federal Government\r\nis too big, and it spends too much money. I can assure you, the bipartisan\r\nleadership of Congress, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our\r\nbudget agreement. And this includes the swift and certain use of the veto\r\npower.\r\n\r\nNow, it's also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle\r\nto controlling Federal deficits. The simple but frustrating problem of\r\nmaking expenses match revenues--something American families do and the\r\nFederal Government can't--has caused crisis after crisis in this city. Mr.\r\nSpeaker, Mr. President, I will say to you tonight what I have said before\r\nand will continue to say: The budget process has broken down; it needs a\r\ndrastic overhaul. With each ensuing year, the spectacle before the American\r\npeople is the same as it was this Christmas: budget deadlines delayed or\r\nmissed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of\r\nbillions of dollars worth of spending into one bill, and a Federal\r\nGovernment on the brink of default.\r\n\r\nI know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said, because you\r\nsuffered so directly. But let's recall that in 7 years, of 91\r\nappropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only\r\n10 made it on time. Last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due by\r\nOctober 1st, none of them made it. Instead, we had four continuing\r\nresolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and 2 days, and 3 days,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nAnd then, along came these behemoths. This is the conference report--1,053\r\npages, report weighing 14 pounds. Then this--a reconciliation bill 6 months\r\nlate that was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15 pounds. And the long-term\r\ncontinuing resolution--this one was 2 months late, and it's 1,057 pages\r\nlong, weighing 14 pounds. That was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink.\r\nYou had 3 hours--yes, 3 hours--to consider each, and it took 300 people at\r\nmy Office of Management and Budget just to read the bill so the Government\r\nwouldn't shut down. Congress shouldn't send another one of these. No, and\r\nif you do, I will not sign it.\r\n\r\nLet's change all this. Instead of a Presidential budget that gets discarded\r\nand a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a\r\nsimple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities\r\nwithin the available revenues? And let's remember our deadline is October\r\n1st, not Christmas. Let's get the people's work done in time to avoid a\r\nfootrace with Santa Claus. And, yes, this year--to coin a phrase--a new\r\nbeginning: 13 individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by Congress.\r\n\r\nI'm also certain you join me in saying: Let's help ensure our future of\r\nprosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will not get to\r\nuse it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must have. Give the\r\nPresident the same authority that 43 Governors use in their States: the\r\nright to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and\r\nenforce budget discipline. Let's approve the line-item veto.\r\n\r\nAnd let's take a partial step in this direction. Most of you in this\r\nChamber didn't know what was in this catchall bill and report. Over the\r\npast few weeks, we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little\r\ncomma here and there. For example, there's millions for items such as\r\ncranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the\r\ncommercialization of wildflowers. And that's not to mention the five or so\r\nmillion ($.5 million) that--so that people from developing nations could\r\ncome here to watch Congress at work. I won't even touch that. So, tonight I\r\noffer you this challenge. In 30 days I will send back to you those items as\r\nrescissions, which if I had the authority to line them out I would do so.\r\n\r\nNow, review this multibillion-dollar package that will not undercut our\r\nbipartisan budget agreement. As a matter of fact, if adopted, it will\r\nimprove our deficit reduction goals. And what an example we can set, that\r\nwe're serious about getting our financial accounts in order. By acting and\r\napproving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a congressional\r\nprocess that is out of control.\r\n\r\nThere is another vital reform. Yes, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings has been\r\nprofoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make\r\nit permanent. Let us do now what so many States do to hold down spending\r\nand what 32 State legislatures have asked us to do. Let us heed the wishes\r\nof an overwhelming plurality of Americans and pass a constitutional\r\namendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the Federal Government\r\nto live within its means. Reform of the budget process--including the\r\nline-item veto and balanced budget amendment--will, together with real\r\nrestraint on government spending, prevent the Federal budget from ever\r\nagain ravaging the family budget.\r\n\r\nLet's ensure that the Federal Government never again legislates against the\r\nfamily and the home. Last September 1 signed an Executive order on the\r\nfamily requiring that every department and agency review its activities in\r\nlight of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family. But\r\nlet us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public\r\npolicy process not just in this administration but in all future\r\nadministrations. It's time for Congress to consider, at the beginning, a\r\nstatement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of\r\nAmerican society, the family.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of the family, let's turn to a matter on the mind of every\r\nAmerican parent tonight: education. We all know the sorry story of the\r\nsixties and seventies--soaring spending, plummeting test scores--and that\r\nhopeful trend of the eighties, when we replaced an obsession with dollars\r\nwith a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up. There's a\r\nlesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times: In\r\na child's education, money can never take the place of basics like\r\ndiscipline, hard work, and, yes, homework.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education--more than we\r\nspend on defense. Yet across our country, Governors like New Jersey's Tom\r\nKean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important\r\nas how much we spend. Opening up the teaching profession to all qualified\r\ncandidates, merit pay--so that good teachers get A's as well as apples--and\r\nstronger curriculum, as Secretary Bennett has proposed for high\r\nschools--these imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular\r\nnew kid in America's schools. How can we help? Well, we can talk about and\r\npush for these reforms. But the most important thing we can do is to\r\nreaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the States, local\r\ncommunities and, most of all, to the parents and teachers.\r\n\r\nMy friends, some years ago, the Federal Government declared war on poverty,\r\nand poverty won. Today the Federal Government has 59 major welfare programs\r\nand spends more than $100 billion a year on them. What has all this money\r\ndone? Well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape. Federal\r\nwelfare programs have created a massive social problem. With the best of\r\nintentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very\r\nsupport system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty: the\r\nfamily. Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one\r\ngeneration to the next, of too many fragmented families.\r\n\r\nIt is time--this may be the most radical thing I've said in 7 years in this\r\noffice--it's time for Washington to show a little humility. There are a\r\nthousand sparks of genius in 50 States and a thousand communities around\r\nthe Nation. It is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire\r\nand become guiding lights. States have begun to show us the way. They've\r\ndemonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more\r\neffective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs\r\nrequiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work. Let us give the\r\nStates more flexibility and encourage more reforms. Let's start making our\r\nwelfare system the first rung on America's ladder of opportunity, a boost\r\nup from dependency, not a graveyard but a birthplace of hope.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the\r\nquality of family life. The first is an untold American success story.\r\nRecently, we released our annual survey of what graduating high school\r\nseniors have to say about drugs. Cocaine use is declining, and marijuana\r\nuse was the lowest since surveying began. We can be proud that our students\r\nare just saying no to drugs. But let us remember what this menace requires:\r\ncommitment from every part of America and every single American, a\r\ncommitment to a drugfree America. The war against drugs is a war of\r\nindividual battles, a crusade with many heroes, including America's young\r\npeople and also someone very special to me. She has helped so many of our\r\nyoung people to say no to drugs. Nancy, much credit belongs to you, and I\r\nwant to express to you your husband's pride and your country's thanks.'.\r\nSurprised you, didn't I?\r\n\r\nWell, now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to\r\nconfront. Tonight, I call America--a good nation, a moral people--to\r\ncharitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on\r\ndemand. To those who say this violates a woman's right to control of her\r\nown body: Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child\r\nis a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness? Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation\r\nthat would stop all Federal funding for abortion and with a human life\r\namendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens\r\nthe life of the mother. Our Judeo-Christian tradition recognizes the right\r\nof taking a life in self-defense. But with that one exception, let us look\r\nto those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt. I pledge to\r\nyou tonight I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full\r\nsharing in family life to millions of Americans so that children who need\r\nhomes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them.\r\n\r\nAnd let me add here: So many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us\r\nthat spiritual values alone are essential to our nation's health and vigor.\r\nThe Congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the Supreme Court,\r\nwith an acknowledgment of the Supreme Being. Yet we are denied the right to\r\nset aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray. I\r\nbelieve Congress should pass our school prayer amendment.\r\n\r\nNow, to make sure there is a full nine member Supreme Court to interpret\r\nthe law, to protect the rights of all Americans, I urge the Senate to move\r\nquickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the highest\r\nCourt in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill\r\nvacancies in the Federal judiciary.\r\n\r\nHere then are our domestic priorities. Yet if the Congress and the\r\nadministration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to\r\nexpand a growing world economy, to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear\r\narms, and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nOur policies consistently received the strongest support of the late\r\nCongressman Dan Daniel of Virginia. I'm sure all of you join me in\r\nexpressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world\r\nis to promote freedom as the key to economic growth. A creative,\r\ncompetitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that\r\nwould close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs.\r\nWe should always remember: Protectionism is destructionism. America's jobs,\r\nAmerica's growth, America's future depend on trade--trade that is free,\r\nopen, and fair.\r\n\r\nThis year, we have it within our power to take a major step toward a\r\ngrowing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to\r\nall the free nations of this Earth. I'm speaking of the historic free trade\r\nagreement negotiated between our country and Canada. And I can also tell\r\nyou that we're determined to expand this concept, south as well as north.\r\nNext month I will be traveling to Mexico, where trade matters will be of\r\nforemost concern. And over the next several months, our Congress and the\r\nCanadian Parliament can make the start of such a North American accord a\r\nreality. Our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade, from the tip\r\nof Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle, unites the people of the Western\r\nHemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange, when all borders\r\nbecome what the U.S.-Canadian border so long has been: a meeting place\r\nrather than a dividing line.\r\n\r\nThis movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is\r\nindivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and\r\nagainst totalitarian rule. This global democratic revolution has removed\r\nthe specter, so frightening a decade ago, of democracy doomed to permanent\r\nminority status in the world. In South and Central America, only a third of\r\nthe people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976. Today over 90 percent of Latin\r\nAmericans live in nations committed to democratic principles. And the\r\nresurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every\r\ncontinent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning, because that nation is so near\r\nour own borders. The recent revelations of a former high-level Sandinista\r\nmajor, Roger Miranda, show us that, even as they talk peace, the Communist\r\nSandinista government of Nicaragua has established plans for a large\r\n600,000-man army. Yet even as these plans are made, the Sandinista regime\r\nknows the tide is turning, and the cause of Nicaraguan freedom is riding at\r\nits crest. Because of the freedom fighters, who are resisting Communist\r\nrule, the Sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights,\r\nnegotiate with church authorities, and release a few political prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on the Sandinistas, their promises and their actions. There is\r\na consensus among the four Central American democratic Presidents that the\r\nSandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to\r\nall of Central America. The Sandinistas again have promised reforms. Their\r\nchallenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy. On Wednesday my\r\nrequest to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted, which reflects\r\nour mutual desire for peace, freedom, and democracy in Nicaragua. I ask\r\nCongress to pass this request. Let us be for the people of Nicaragua what\r\nLafayette, Pulaski, and Von Steuben were for our forefathers and the cause\r\nof American independence.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in Afghanistan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace. We\r\nsupport the Mujahidin. There can be no settlement unless all Soviet troops\r\nare removed and the Afghan people are allowed genuine self-determination. I\r\nhave made my views on this matter known to Mr. Gorbachev. But not just\r\nNicaragua or Afghanistan--yes, everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide\r\nacross the world: freedom fighters rising up in Cambodia and Angola,\r\nfighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred. Their\r\ncause is our cause: freedom.\r\n\r\nYet even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace\r\nand reduce the danger of nuclear war. But let's have no illusions. Three\r\nyears of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have\r\nincreased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizing\r\nearlier hard-won goals. We must face squarely the implications of this\r\nnegative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal both\r\nthis year and in the future.\r\n\r\nThis same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as\r\nwell. But the resolve of America and its NATO allies has opened the way for\r\nunprecedented achievement in arms reduction. Our recently signed INF treaty\r\nis historic, because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most\r\nstringent verification regime in arms control history, including several\r\nforms of short-notice, on-site inspection. I submitted the treaty today,\r\nand I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of\r\nthis landmark agreement. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the INF treaty, we're within reach of an even more\r\nsignificant START agreement that will reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range\r\nmissile--or strategic arsenals by half. But let me be clear. Our approach\r\nis not to seek agreement for agreement's sake but to settle only for\r\nagreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies.\r\nWe will never put our security at risk--or that of our allies--just to reach\r\nan agreement with the Soviets. No agreement is better than a bad\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what we\r\nnever had--a future free of nuclear terror. Reduction of strategic\r\noffensive arms is one step, SDI another. Our funding request for our\r\nStrategic Defense Initiative is less than 2 percent of the total defense\r\nbudget. SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent. SDI\r\nhas the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction. It\r\nreduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind.\r\nStrategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, more\r\nstable basis for deterrence. We must also remember that SDI is our\r\ninsurance policy against a nuclear accident, a Chernobyl of the sky, or an\r\naccidental launch or some madman who might come along.\r\n\r\nWe've seen such changes in the world in 7 years. As totalitarianism\r\nstruggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and\r\nthe aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilient\r\nand resurgent. As the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism\r\non the defensive, we have left behind the days of retreat. America is again\r\na vigorous leader of the free world, a nation that acts decisively and\r\nfirmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests. No legacy\r\nwould make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for\r\nthe cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of\r\nAmerican power from ever occurring again.\r\n\r\nBut my thoughts tonight go beyond this, and I hope you'll let me end this\r\nevening with a personal reflection. You know, the world could never be\r\nquite the same again after Jacob Shallus, a trustworthy and dependable\r\nclerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, took his pen and engrossed\r\nthose words about representative government in the preamble of our\r\nConstitution. And in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was\r\nforever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the Emmitsburg Pike in an\r\nobscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke of our duty to\r\ngovernment of and by the people and never letting it perish from the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nAt the start of this decade, I suggested that we live in equally momentous\r\ntimes, that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government\r\nwould endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a\r\nquiet, pleasant, greening land called America. Not everything has been made\r\nperfect in 7 years, nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years,\r\nbut before us, this year and beyond, are great prospects for the cause of\r\npeace and world freedom.\r\n\r\nIt means, too, that the young Americans I spoke of 7 years ago, as well as\r\nthose who might be coming along the Virginia or Maryland shores this night\r\nand seeing for the first time the lights of this Capital City--the lights\r\nthat cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to\r\nthe memory of our great men--it means those young Americans will find a\r\ncity of hope in a land that is free.\r\n\r\nWe can be proud that for them and for us, as those lights along the Potomac\r\nare still seen this night signaling as they have for nearly two centuries\r\nand as we pray God they always will, that another generation of Americans\r\nhas protected and passed on lovingly this place called America, this\r\nshining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people.\r\n\r\nThank you, and God bless you.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:07 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\r\nHe was introduced by Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nThe address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.",
