THE ELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ALL ELECTIONS BEGIN WITH A BUSTLE\r\n\r\nBefore beginning to describe an election in the provinces, it is proper\r\nto state that the town of Arcis-sur-Aube was not the theatre of the\r\nevents here related.\r\n\r\nThe arrondissement of Arcis votes at Bar-sur-Aube, which is forty miles\r\nfrom Arcis; consequently there is no deputy from Arcis in the Chamber.\r\n\r\nDiscretion, required in a history of contemporaneous manners and morals,\r\ndictates this precautionary word. It is rather an ingenious contrivance\r\nto make the description of one town the frame for events which happened\r\nin another; and several times already in the course of the Comedy of\r\nHuman Life, this means has been employed in spite of its disadvantages,\r\nwhich consist chiefly in making the frame of as much importance as the\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the month of April, 1839, about ten o’clock in the\r\nmorning, the salon of Madame Marion, widow of a former receiver-general\r\nof the department of the Aube, presented a singular appearance. All\r\nthe furniture had been removed except the curtains to the windows,\r\nthe ornaments on the fireplace, the chandelier, and the tea-table. An\r\nAubusson carpet, taken up two weeks before the usual time, obstructed\r\nthe steps of the portico, and the floor had been violently rubbed and\r\npolished, though without increasing its usual brightness. All this was\r\na species of domestic premonition concerning the result of the elections\r\nwhich were about to take place over the whole surface of France. Often\r\nthings are as spiritually intelligent as men,--an argument in favor of\r\nthe occult sciences.\r\n\r\nThe old man-servant of Colonel Giguet, Madame Marion’s older brother,\r\nhad just finished dusting the room; the chamber-maid and the cook were\r\ncarrying, with an alacrity that denoted an enthusiasm equal to their\r\nattachment, all the chairs of the house, and piling them up in the\r\ngarden, where the trees were already unfolding their leaves, through\r\nwhich the cloudless blue of the sky was visible. The springlike\r\natmosphere and sun of May allowed the glass door and the two windows of\r\nthe oblong salon to be kept open.\r\n\r\nAn old lady, Madame Marion herself, now ordered the two maids to place\r\nthe chairs at one end of the salon, four rows deep, leaving between the\r\nrows a space of about three feet. When this was done, each row presented\r\na front of ten chairs, all of divers species. A line of chairs was also\r\nplaced along the wall, under the windows and before the glass door.\r\nAt the other end of the salon, facing the forty chairs, Madame Marion\r\nplaced three arm-chairs behind the tea-table, which was covered with a\r\ngreen cloth, on which she placed a bell.\r\n\r\nOld Colonel Giguet arrived on this battle-field at the moment when his\r\nsister bethought herself of filling the empty spaces on either side\r\nof the fireplace with benches from the antechamber, disregarding\r\nthe baldness of their velvet covers which had done good service for\r\ntwenty-four years.\r\n\r\n“We can seat seventy persons,” she said to her brother triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“God grant that we may have seventy friends!” replied the colonel.\r\n\r\n“If, after receiving every night, for twenty-four years, the whole\r\nsociety of Arcis-sur-Aube, a single one of my regular visitors fails us\r\non this occasion--” began the old lady, in a threatening manner.\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh!” replied the colonel, interrupting his sister, “I’ll name\r\nyou ten who cannot and ought not to come. First,” he said, beginning to\r\ncount on his fingers, “Antonin Goulard, sub-prefect, for one; Frederic\r\nMarest, _procureur-du-roi_, there’s two; Monsieur Olivier Vinet, his\r\nsubstitute, three; Monsieur Martener, examining-judge, four; the justice\r\nof peace--”\r\n\r\n“But I am not so silly,” said the old lady, interrupting her brother in\r\nher turn, “as to expect office-holders to come to a meeting the object\r\nof which is to give another deputy to the Opposition. For all that,\r\nAntonin Goulard, Simon’s comrade and schoolmate, would be very well\r\npleased to see him a deputy because--”\r\n\r\n“Come, sister, leave our own business of politics to us men. Where is\r\nSimon?”\r\n\r\n“He is dressing,” she answered. “He was wise not to breakfast, for he is\r\nvery nervous. It is queer that, though he is in the habit of speaking in\r\ncourt, he dreads this meeting as if he were certain to meet enemies.”\r\n\r\n“Faith! I have often had to face masked batteries, and my soul--I won’t\r\nsay my body--never quailed; but if I had to stand there,” said the old\r\nsoldier, pointing to the tea-table, “and face forty bourgeois gaping\r\nat me, their eyes fixed on mine, and expecting sonorous and correct\r\nphrases, my shirt would be wringing wet before I could get out a word.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, my dear father,” said Simon Giguet, entering from the smaller\r\nsalon, “you really must make that effort for me; for if there is a\r\nman in the department of the Aube whose voice is all-powerful it is\r\nassuredly you. In 1815--”\r\n\r\n“In 1815,” said the little old man, who was wonderfully well preserved,\r\n“I did not have to speak; I simply wrote out a little proclamation\r\nwhich brought us two thousand men in twenty-four hours. But it is a\r\nvery different thing putting my name to a paper which is read by a\r\ndepartment, and standing up before a meeting to make a speech. Napoleon\r\nhimself failed there; at the 18th Brumaire he talked nothing but\r\nnonsense to the Five Hundred.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear father,” urged Simon, “it concerns my life, my fortune, my\r\nhappiness. Fix your eyes on some one person and think you are talking to\r\nhim, and you’ll get through all right.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” cried Madame Marion, “I am only an old woman, but under\r\nsuch circumstances and knowing what depends on it, I--oh! I should be\r\neloquent!”\r\n\r\n“Too eloquent, perhaps,” said the colonel. “To go beyond the mark is not\r\nattaining it. But why make so much of all this?” he added, looking at\r\nhis son. “It is only within the last two days you have taken up this\r\ncandidacy of ideas; well, suppose you are not nominated,--so much the\r\nworse for Arcis, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nThese words were in keeping with the whole life of him who said them.\r\nColonel Giguet was one of the most respected officers in the Grand\r\nArmy, the foundation of his character being absolute integrity joined to\r\nextreme delicacy. Never did he put himself forward; favors, such as he\r\nreceived, sought him. For this reason he remained eleven years a mere\r\ncaptain of the artillery of the Guard, not receiving the rank of major\r\nuntil 1814. His almost fanatical attachment to Napoleon forbade his\r\ntaking service under the Bourbons after the first abdication. In fact,\r\nhis devotion in 1815 was such that he would have been banished with so\r\nmany others if the Comte de Gondreville had not contrived to have his\r\nname effaced from the ordinance and put on the retired list with a\r\npension, and the rank of colonel.\r\n\r\nMadame Marion, _nee_ Giguet, had another brother who was colonel of\r\ngendarmerie at Troyes, whom she followed to that town at an earlier\r\nperiod. It was there that she married Monsieur Marion, receiver-general\r\nof the Aube, who also had had a brother, the chief-justice of an\r\nimperial court. While a mere barrister at Arcis this young man had\r\nlent his name during the Terror to the famous Malin de l’Aube, the\r\nrepresentative of the people, in order to hold possession of the estate\r\nof Gondreville. [See “An Historical Mystery.”] Consequently, all the\r\nsupport and influence of Malin, now become count and senator, was at\r\nthe service of the Marion family. The barrister’s brother was made\r\nreceiver-general of the department, at a period when, far from having\r\nforty applicants for one place, the government was fortunate in getting\r\nany one to accept such a slippery office.\r\n\r\nMarion, the receiver-general, inherited the fortune of his brother the\r\nchief-justice, and Madame Marion that of her brother the colonel of\r\ngendarmerie. In 1814, the receiver-general met with reverses. He died\r\nwhen the Empire died; but his widow managed to gather fifteen thousand\r\nfrancs a year from the wreck of his accumulated fortunes. The colonel of\r\ngendarmerie had left his property to his sister on learning the marriage\r\nof his brother the artillery officer to the daughter of a rich banker of\r\nHamburg. It is well known what a fancy all Europe had for the splendid\r\ntroopers of Napoleon!\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Madame Marion, half-ruined, returned to Arcis, her native\r\nplace, where she bought, on the Grande-Place, one of the finest houses\r\nin the town. Accustomed to receive much company at Troyes, where the\r\nreceiver-general reigned supreme, she now opened her salon to the\r\nnotabilities of the liberal party in Arcis. A woman accustomed to the\r\nadvantages of salon royalty does not easily renounce them. Vanity is the\r\nmost tenacious of all habits.\r\n\r\nBonapartist, and afterwards a liberal--for, by the strangest of\r\nmetamorphoses, the soldiers of Napoleon became almost to a man\r\nenamoured of the constitutional system--Colonel Giguet was, during the\r\nRestoration, the natural president of the governing committee of Arcis,\r\nwhich consisted of the notary Grevin, his son-in-law Beauvisage, and\r\nVarlet junior, the chief physician of Arcis, brother-in-law of Grevin,\r\nand a few other liberals.\r\n\r\n“If our dear boy is not nominated,” said Madame Marion, having first\r\nlooked into the antechamber and garden to make sure that no one\r\noverheard her, “he cannot have Mademoiselle Beauvisage; his success in\r\nthis election means a marriage with Cecile.”\r\n\r\n“Cecile!” exclaimed the old man, opening his eyes very wide and looking\r\nat his sister in stupefaction.\r\n\r\n“There is no one but you in the whole department who would forget the\r\n_dot_ and the expectations of Mademoiselle Beauvisage,” said his sister.\r\n\r\n“She is the richest heiress in the department of the Aube,” said Simon\r\nGiguet.\r\n\r\n“But it seems to me,” said the old soldier, “that my son is not to be\r\ndespised as a match; he is your heir, he already has something from his\r\nmother, and I expect to leave him something better than a dry name.”\r\n\r\n“All that put together won’t make thirty thousand a year, and suitors\r\nare already coming forward who have as much as that, not counting their\r\nposition,” returned Madame Marion.\r\n\r\n“And?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n“They have been refused.”\r\n\r\n“Then what do the Beauvisage family want?” said the colonel, looking\r\nalternately at his son and sister.\r\n\r\nIt may seem extraordinary that Colonel Giguet, the brother of Madame\r\nMarion in whose house the society of Arcis had met for twenty-four\r\nyears, and whose salon was the echo of all reports, all scandals, and\r\nall the gossip of the department of the Aube,--a good deal of it being\r\nthere manufactured,--should be ignorant of facts of this nature. But his\r\nignorance will seem natural when we mention that this noble relic of the\r\nNapoleonic legions went to bed at night and rose in the morning with the\r\nchickens, as all old persons should do if they wish to live out their\r\nlives. He was never present at the intimate conversations which went\r\non in the salon. In the provinces there are two sorts of intimate\r\nconversation,--one, which is held officially when all the company are\r\ngathered together, playing at cards or conversing; the other, which\r\n_simmers_, like a well made soup, when three or four friends remain\r\naround the fireplace, friends who can be trusted to repeat nothing of\r\nwhat is said beyond their own limits.\r\n\r\nFor nine years, ever since the triumph of his political ideas, the\r\ncolonel had lived almost entirely outside of social life. Rising with\r\nthe sun, he devoted himself to horticulture; he adored flowers, and of\r\nall flowers he best loved roses. His hands were brown as those of a real\r\ngardener; he took care himself of his beds. Constantly in conference\r\nwith his working gardener he mingled little, especially for the last two\r\nyears, with the life of others; of whom, indeed, he saw little. He took\r\nbut one meal with the family, namely, his dinner; for he rose too early\r\nto breakfast with his son and sister. To his efforts we owe the famous\r\nrose Giguet, known so well to all amateurs.\r\n\r\nThis old man, who had now passed into the state of a domestic fetich,\r\nwas exhibited, as we may well suppose, on all extraordinary occasions.\r\nCertain families enjoy the benefit of a demi-god of this kind, and plume\r\nthemselves upon him as they would upon a title.\r\n\r\n“I have noticed,” replied Madame Marion to her brother’s question, “that\r\never since the revolution of July Madame Beauvisage has aspired to live\r\nin Paris. Obliged to stay here as long as her father lives, she has\r\nfastened her ambition on a future son-in-law, and my lady dreams now of\r\nthe splendors and dignities of political life.”\r\n\r\n“Could you love Cecile?” said the colonel to his son.\r\n\r\n“Yes, father.”\r\n\r\n“And does she like you?”\r\n\r\n“I think so; but the thing is, to please the mother and grandfather.\r\nThough old Grevin himself wants to oppose my election, my success would\r\ndetermine Madame Beauvisage to accept me, because she expects to manage\r\nme as she pleases and to be minister under my name.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good joke!” cried Madame Marion. “What does she take us for?”\r\n\r\n“Whom has she refused?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Well, within the last three months, Antonin Goulard and the\r\n_procureur-du-roi_, Frederic Marest, have received, so they say,\r\nequivocal answers which mean anything--_except yes_.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” cried the old man throwing up his arms. “What days we\r\nlive in, to be sure! Why, Lucie was the daughter of a hosier, and the\r\ngrand-daughter of a farmer. Does Madame Beauvisage want the Comte de\r\nCinq-Cygne for a son-in-law?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t laugh at Madame Beauvisage, brother. Cecile is rich enough to\r\nchoose a husband anywhere, even in the class to which the Cinq-Cygnes\r\nbelong. But there’s the bell announcing the electors, and I\r\ndisappear--regretting much I can’t hear what you are all going to say.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. REVOLT OF A LIBERAL ROTTEN-BOROUGH\r\n\r\nThough 1839 is, politically speaking, very distant from 1847, we can\r\nstill remember the elections produced by the Coalition, an ephemeral\r\neffort of the Chamber of Deputies to realize the threat of parliamentary\r\ngovernment,--a threat _a la_ Cromwell, which without a Cromwell could\r\nonly end, under a prince “the enemy of fraud,” in the triumph of the\r\npresent system, by which the Chambers and the ministers are like the\r\nwooden puppets which the proprietor of the Guignolet shows exhibits to\r\nthe great satisfaction of wonder-stricken idlers in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe arrondissement of Arcis-sur-Aube then found itself in a singular\r\nposition. It supposed itself free to choose its deputy. From 1816 to\r\n1836 it had always elected one of the heaviest orators of the Left,\r\nbelonging to the famous seventeen who were called “Great Citizens” by\r\nthe liberal party,--namely, Francois Keller, of the house of Keller\r\nBros., the son-in-law of the Comte de Gondreville. Gondreville, one of\r\nthe most magnificent estates in France, is situated about a mile from\r\nArcis.\r\n\r\nThis banker, recently made count and peer of France, expected, no\r\ndoubt, to transfer to his son, then thirty years of age, his electoral\r\nsuccession, in order to make him some day eligible for the peerage.\r\nAlready a major on the staff and a great favorite of the prince-royal,\r\nCharles Keller, now a viscount, belonged to the court party of the\r\ncitizen-king. The most brilliant future seemed pledged to a young man\r\nenormously rich, full of energy, already remarkable for his devotion to\r\nthe new dynasty, the grandson of the Comte de Gondreville, and nephew\r\nof the Marechal de Carigliano; but this election, so necessary to his\r\nfuture prospects, presented suddenly certain difficulties to overcome.\r\n\r\nSince the accession to power of the bourgeois class, Arcis had felt a\r\nvague desire to show itself independent. Consequently, the last election\r\nof Francois Keller had been disturbed by certain republicans, whose red\r\ncaps and long beards had not, however, seriously alarmed the bourgeois\r\nof Arcis. By canvassing the country carefully the radical candidate\r\nwould be able to secure some thirty or forty votes. A few of the\r\ntownspeople, humiliated at seeing their town always treated as a rotten\r\nborough, joined the democrats, though enemies to democracy. In France,\r\nunder the system of balloting, politico-chemical products are formed in\r\nwhich the laws of affinity are reversed.\r\n\r\nNow, to elect young Keller in 1839, after having elected his father for\r\ntwenty years, would show a monstrous electoral servitude, against which\r\nthe pride of the newly enriched bourgeoisie revolved, for they felt\r\nthemselves to be fully worth either Monsieur Malin, otherwise called\r\nComte de Gondreville, the Keller Bros., the Cinq-Cygnes, or even, the\r\nKing of the French.\r\n\r\nThe numerous partisans of old Gondreville, the king of the department\r\nof the Aube, were therefore awaiting some fresh proof of his ability,\r\nalready so thoroughly tested, to circumvent this rising revolt. In order\r\nnot to compromise the influence of his family in the arrondissement of\r\nArcis, that old statesman would doubtless propose for candidate some\r\nyoung man who could be induced to accept an official function and then\r\nyield his place to Charles Keller,--a parliamentary arrangement which\r\nrenders the elect of the people subject to re-election.\r\n\r\nWhen Simon Giguet sounded the old notary Grevin, the faithful friend of\r\nthe Comte de Gondreville, on the subject of the elections, the old\r\nman replied that, while he did not know the intentions of the Comte de\r\nGondreville, he should himself vote for Charles Keller and employ his\r\ninfluence for that election.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this answer of old Grevin had circulated through Arcis, a\r\nreaction against him set in. Although for thirty years this provincial\r\nAristides possessed the confidence of the whole town,--having been\r\nmayor of Arcis from 1804 to 1814 and again during the Hundred Days,--and\r\nalthough the Opposition had accepted him as their leader until the\r\ntriumph of 1830, at which period he refused the honors of the mayoralty\r\non the ground of his great age, and finally, although the town, in order\r\nto manifest its affection for him, elected his son-in-law, Monsieur\r\nBeauvisage, mayor in his stead, it now revolted against him and some\r\nyoung striplings went so far as to talk of his dotage. The partisans of\r\nSimon Giguet then turned to Phileas Beauvisage, the mayor, and won him\r\nover the more easily to their side because, without having quarrelled\r\nwith his father-in-law, he assumed an independence of him which had\r\nended in coldness,--an independence that the sly old notary allowed him\r\nto maintain, seeing in it an excellent means of action on the town of\r\nArcis.\r\n\r\nThe mayor, questioned the evening before in the open street, declared\r\npositively that he should cast his vote for the first-comer on the list\r\nof eligibles rather than give it to Charles Keller, for whom, however,\r\nhe had a high esteem.\r\n\r\n“Arcis shall be no longer a rotten borough!” he said, “or I’ll emigrate\r\nto Paris.”\r\n\r\nFlatter the passions of the moment and you will always be a hero, even\r\nat Arcis-sur-Aube.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le maire,” said everybody, “gives noble proof of his firmness\r\nof character.”\r\n\r\nNothing progresses so rapidly as a legal revolt. That evening\r\nMadame Marion and her friends organized for the morrow a meeting of\r\n“independent electors” in the interests of Simon Giguet, the colonel’s\r\nson. The morrow had now come and had turned the house topsy-turvy to\r\nreceive the friends on whose independence the leaders of the movement\r\ncounted. Simon Giguet, the native-born candidate of a little town\r\njealously desirous to elect a son of its own, had, as we have seen, put\r\nto profit this desire; and yet, the whole prosperity and fortune of the\r\nGiguet family were the work of the Comte de Gondreville. But when it\r\ncomes to an election, what are sentiments!\r\n\r\nThis Scene is written for the information of countries so unfortunate\r\nas not to know the blessings of national representation, and which are,\r\ntherefore, ignorant by what intestinal convulsions, what Brutus-like\r\nsacrifices, a little town gives birth to a deputy. Majestic but natural\r\nspectacle, which may, indeed, be compared with that of childbirth,--the\r\nsame throes, the same impurities, the same lacerations, the same final\r\ntriumph!\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why an only son, whose fortune was sufficient, should\r\nbe, like Simon Giguet, an ordinary barrister in a little country town\r\nwhere barristers are pretty nearly useless. A word about the candidate\r\nis therefore necessary.\r\n\r\nColonel Giguet had had, between 1806 and 1813, by his wife who died in\r\n1814, three children, the eldest of whom, Simon, alone survived. Until\r\nhe became an only child, Simon was brought up as a youth to whom the\r\nexercise of a profession would be necessary. And about the time he\r\nbecame by the death of his brothers the family heir, the young man met\r\nwith a serious disappointment. Madame Marion had counted much, for her\r\nnephew, on the inheritance of his grandfather the banker of Hamburg. But\r\nwhen that old German died in 1826, he left his grandson Giguet a paltry\r\ntwo thousand francs a year. The worthy banker, endowed with great\r\nprocreative powers, having soothed the worries of business by the\r\npleasures of paternity, favored the families of eleven other children\r\nwho surrounded him, and who made him believe, with some appearance of\r\njustice, that Simon Giguet was already a rich man.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, the colonel was bent on giving his son an independent\r\nposition, and for this reason: the Giguets could not expect any\r\ngovernment favors under the Restoration. Even if Simon had not been the\r\nson of an ardent Bonapartist, he belonged to a family whose members had\r\njustly incurred the animosity of the Cinq-Cygne family, owing to\r\nthe part which Giguet, the colonel of gendarmerie, and the Marions,\r\nincluding Madame Marion, had taken as witnesses on the famous trial of\r\nthe Messieurs de Simeuse, unjustly condemned in 1805 for the abduction\r\nof the Comte de Gondreville, then senator, and formerly representative\r\nof the people, who had despoiled the Cinq-Cygne family of their\r\nproperty. [See “An Historical Mystery.”]\r\n\r\nGrevin was not only one of the most important witnesses at that trial,\r\nbut he was one of the chief promoters of the prosecution. That affair\r\ndivides to this day the arrondissement of Arcis into two parties; one of\r\nwhich declares the innocence of the condemned; the other standing by the\r\nComte de Gondreville and his adherents. Though, under the Restoration,\r\nthe Comtesse de Cinq-Cygne used all the influence the return of the\r\nBourbons gave her to arrange things as she wished in the department\r\nof the Aube, the Comte de Gondreville contrived to counterbalance this\r\nCinq-Cygne royalty by the secret authority he wielded over the liberals\r\nof the town through the notary Grevin, Colonel Giguet, his son-in-law\r\nKeller (always elected deputy in spite of the Cinq-Cygnes), and also by\r\nthe credit he maintained, as long as Louis XVIII. lived, in the counsels\r\nof the crown. It was not until after the death of that king that the\r\nComtesse de Cinq-Cygne was able to get Michu appointed judge of the\r\ncourt of assizes in Arcis. She desired of all things to obtain this\r\nplace for the son of the steward who had perished on the scaffold\r\nat Troyes, the victim of his devotion to the Simeuse family, whose\r\nfull-length portrait always hung in her salon, whether in Paris or at\r\nCinq-Cygne. Until 1823 the Comte de Gondreville had possessed sufficient\r\npower over Louis XVIII. to prevent this appointment of Michu.\r\n\r\nIt was by the advice of the Comte de Gondreville that Colonel Giguet\r\nmade his son a lawyer. Simon had all the more opportunity of shining\r\nat the bar in the arrondissement of Arcis because he was the only\r\nbarrister, solicitors pleading their own cases in these petty\r\nlocalities. The young man had really secured certain triumphs in the\r\ncourt of assizes of the Aube, but he was none the less an object of\r\nderision to Frederic Marest, _procureur-du-roi_, Olivier Vinet, the\r\nsubstitute _procureur_, and the judge, Michu,--the three best minds in\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nSimon Giguet, like other men, paid goodly tribute to the mighty power of\r\nridicule that pursued him. He liked to hear himself talk, and he talked\r\non all occasions; he solemnly delivered himself of dry and long-winded\r\nsentences which passed for eloquence among the upper bourgeoisie of\r\nArcis. The poor fellow belonged to that species of bore which desires\r\nto explain everything, even the simplest thing. He explained rain; he\r\nexplained the revolution of July; he explained things impenetrable; he\r\nexplained Louis-Philippe, Odilon Barrot, Monsieur Thiers, the Eastern\r\nQuestion; he explained Champagne; he explained 1788; he explained the\r\ntariff of custom houses and humanitarians, magnetism and the economy of\r\nthe civil list.\r\n\r\nThis lean young man, with a bilious skin, tall enough to justify his\r\nsonorous nullity (for it is rare that a tall man does not have eminent\r\nfaculties of some kind) outdid the puritanism of the votaries of the\r\nextreme Left, all of them so sensitive, after the manner of prudes who\r\nhave their intrigues to hide. Dressed invariably in black, he wore a\r\nwhite cravat which came down low on his chest, so that his face seemed\r\nto issue from a horn of white paper, for the collar of his shirt was\r\nhigh and stiff after a fashion now, fortunately, exploded. His trousers\r\nand his coats were always too large for him. He had what is called\r\nin the provinces dignity; that is to say, he was stiffly erect and\r\npompously dull in manner. His friend, Antonin Goulard, accused him of\r\nimitating Monsieur Dupin. And in truth, the young barrister was apt to\r\nwear shoes and stout socks of black filoselle.\r\n\r\nProtected by the respect that every one bore to his father, and by\r\nthe influence exercised by his aunt over a little town whose principal\r\ninhabitants had frequented her salon for many years, Simon Giguet,\r\npossessing already ten thousand francs a year, not counting the fees\r\nof his profession and the fortune his aunt would not fail to leave him,\r\nfelt no doubt of his election. Nevertheless, the first sound of the bell\r\nannouncing the arrival of the most influential electors echoed in the\r\nheart of the ambitious aspirant and filled it with vague fears. Simon\r\ndid not conceal from himself the cleverness and the immense resources\r\nof old Grevin, nor the prestige attending the means that would surely be\r\nemployed by the ministry to promote the candidacy of a young and dashing\r\nofficer then in Africa, attached to the staff of the prince-royal.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he said to his father, “that I have the colic; I feel a\r\nwarmth at the pit of my stomach that makes me very uneasy.”\r\n\r\n“Old soldiers,” replied the colonel, “have the same feeling when they\r\nhear the cannon beginning to growl at the opening of a battle.”\r\n\r\n“What will it be in the Chamber!” said the barrister.\r\n\r\n“The Comte de Gondreville told me,” said the old colonel, “that he has\r\nknown more than one orator affected with the qualms which precede, even\r\nwith us old fire-eaters, the opening of a battle. But all this is\r\nidle talk. You want to be a deputy,” added the old man, shrugging his\r\nshoulders, “then be one!”\r\n\r\n“Father, the real triumph will be Cecile! Cecile has an immense fortune.\r\nNow-a-days an immense fortune means power.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me! how times have changed! Under the Emperor men had to be\r\nbrave.”\r\n\r\n“Each epoch is summed up in a phrase,” said Simon, recalling an\r\nobservation of the Comte de Gondreville, which paints that personage\r\nwell. He remarked: “Under the Empire, when it was desirable to destroy a\r\nman, people said, ‘He is a coward.’ To-day we say, ‘He is a cheat.’”\r\n\r\n“Poor France! where are they leading you?” cried the colonel; “I shall\r\ngo back to my roses.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, stay, father! You are the keystone of the arch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. OPPOSITION DEFINES ITSELF\r\n\r\nThe mayor, Monsieur Phileas Beauvisage, was the first to present\r\nhimself, accompanied by the successor of his father-in-law, the\r\nbusiest notary in town, Achille Pigoult, grandson of an old man who\r\nhad continued justice of the peace in Arcis during the Revolution, the\r\nEmpire, and the Restoration. Achille Pigoult, thirty-two years of age,\r\nhad been eighteen years a clerk in Grevin’s office with no means of\r\nbecoming himself a notary. His father, son of the justice of peace, had\r\ndied of a so-called apoplexy, having gone wrong in business.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Gondreville, however, with whom old Pigoult had relations\r\ndating back to 1793, lent money for the necessary security, and thus\r\nenabled the grandson of the judge who made the first examination in the\r\nSimeuse case to buy the practice of his master, Grevin. Achille had\r\nset up his office in the Place de l’Eglise, in a house belonging to the\r\nComte de Gondreville, which the latter had leased to him at so low a\r\nprice that any one could see how desirous that crafty politician was to\r\nhold the leading notary of Arcis in the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nYoung Pigoult, a short, skinny man, whose eyes seemed to pierce the\r\ngreen spectacles which could not modify the spitefulness of his glance,\r\nwell-informed as to all the interests of the neighborhood, owing his\r\naptitude in managing affairs to a certain facility of speech, passed\r\nfor what is called a _quizzer_, saying things plainly and with more\r\ncleverness than the aborigines could put into their conversations. Still\r\na bachelor, he was awaiting a rich marriage through the offices of\r\nhis two protectors, Grevin and the Comte de Gondreville. Consequently,\r\nbarrister Giguet was not a little surprised on seeing Achille appear at\r\nthe meeting in company with Monsieur Phileas Beauvisage.\r\n\r\nThe notary, whose face was so seamed by the smallpox that it seemed to\r\nbe covered with a white net, formed a perfect contrast to the rotund\r\nperson of the mayor, whose face resembled a full moon, but a warm\r\nand lively moon; its tones of lily and of rose being still further\r\nbrightened by a gracious smile, the result not so much of a disposition\r\nof the soul as of that formation of the lips for which the word\r\n“simpering” seems to have been created. Phileas Beauvisage was endowed\r\nwith so great a contentment with himself that he smiled on all the world\r\nand under all circumstances. Those simpering lips smiled at a funeral.\r\nThe liveliness that abounded in his infantine blue eyes did not\r\ncontradict that perpetual and well-nigh intolerable smile.\r\n\r\nThis internal satisfaction passed all the more readily for benevolence\r\nand affability, because Phileas had made himself a language of his own,\r\nremarkable for its immoderate use of the formulas of politeness. He\r\nalways “had the honor”; to all his inquiries as to the health of absent\r\npersons he added the adjectives “dear,” “good,” “excellent.” He lavished\r\ncondoling or congratulatory phrases apropos of all the petty miseries\r\nand all the little felicities of life. He concealed under a deluge of\r\ncommonplaces his native incapacity, his total want of education, and\r\na weakness of character which can only be expressed by the old word\r\n“weathercock.” Be not uneasy: the weathercock had for its axis the\r\nbeautiful Madame Beauvisage, Severine Grevin, the most remarkable woman\r\nin the arrondissement.\r\n\r\nWhen Severine heard of what she called her husband’s “freak” as to\r\nthe election, she said to him on the morning of the meeting at Madame\r\nMarion’s:--\r\n\r\n“It was well enough to give yourself an air of independence; but you\r\nmustn’t go to that Giguet meeting unless Achille Pigoult accompanies\r\nyou; I’ve told him to come and take you.”\r\n\r\nGiving Achille Pigoult as mentor to Beauvisage meant sending a spy from\r\nthe Gondreville party to the Giguet assemblage. We may therefore imagine\r\nthe grimace which contracted the puritan visage of Simon, who was\r\nforced to welcome graciously an _habitue_ of his aunt’s salon and an\r\ninfluential elector, in whom, nevertheless, he saw an enemy.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he thought to himself, “what a mistake I made in refusing him\r\nthat security when he asked for it! Old Gondreville had more sense than\r\nI--Good-day to you, Achille,” he said, assuming a jaunty manner; “I\r\nsuppose you mean to trip me up.”\r\n\r\n“Your meeting isn’t a conspiracy against the independence of our votes,”\r\n replied the notary, smiling. “We are all playing above-board, I take\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Above-board,” echoed Beauvisage.\r\n\r\nAnd the mayor began to laugh with that expressionless laugh by which\r\nsome persons end all their sentences; which may, perhaps, be called the\r\n_ritornello_ of their conversation. After which he placed himself in\r\nwhat we must describe as his third position, standing full-front, his\r\nchest expanded, and his hands behind his back. He was dressed in black\r\ncoat and trousers, with an effulgent white waistcoat, opened in such a\r\nway as to show two diamond shirt-buttons worth several thousand francs.\r\n\r\n“We shall fight, but we shall not be the less good friends,” he said.\r\n“That is the essence of constitutional morals; he! he! he! That is how\r\n_I_ understand the alliance of monarchy with liberty; ha! ha! ha!”\r\n\r\nWhereupon the mayor took Simon’s hand, saying:\r\n\r\n“How are you, my good friend? Your dear aunt and our worthy colonel\r\nare no doubt as well to-day as they were yesterday,--that is, I presume\r\nso,--he! he! he!” adding, with an air of perfect beatitude, “perhaps a\r\nlittle agitated by the ceremony now about to take place. Ha! ha! young\r\nman; so we intend to enter a political career? Ha! ha! ha! This is our\r\nfirst step--mustn’t step back--it is a great career. I’d rather it were\r\nyou than I to rush into the storms and tempests of the legislative body,\r\nhi! hi!--however agreeable it may be to see that body in our own person,\r\nhi! hi! hi!--the sovereign power of France in one four hundred and\r\nfifty-third! Hi! hi! hi!”\r\n\r\nThe vocal organ of Phileas Beauvisage had an agreeable sonority\r\naltogether in harmony with the leguminous curves of his face (of the\r\ncolor of a light yellow pumpkin), his solid back, and his broadly\r\nexpanded chest. That voice, bass in volume, could soften to a baritone\r\nand utter, in the giggle with which Phileas ended his phrases, a silvery\r\nnote. When God desired, in order to place all species of mankind in this\r\nhis terrestrial paradise, to create within it a provincial bourgeois,\r\nhis hands never made a more perfect and complete type than Phileas\r\nBeauvisage.\r\n\r\n“I admire,” said that great work, “the devotion of those who fling\r\nthemselves into the tumult of political life; he! he! he! It takes more\r\nnerve than I possess. Who could have told us in 1812 or 1813 that we\r\nshould come to this? As for me, nothing can surprise me in these days,\r\nwhen asphalt, India-rubber, railroads, and steam have changed the ground\r\nwe tread on, and overcoats, and distances, he, he!”\r\n\r\nThese last words were seasoned with a prolonged laugh, and accompanied\r\nby a gesture which he had made more especially his own: he closed his\r\nright fist, struck it into the rounded palm of his left hand, and rubbed\r\nit there with joyous satisfaction. This performance coincided with his\r\nlaughs on the frequent occasions when he thought he had said a witty\r\nthing. Perhaps it is superfluous to add that Phileas Beauvisage was\r\nregarded in Arcis as an amiable and charming man.\r\n\r\n“I shall endeavor,” replied Simon Giguet, “to worthily represent--”\r\n\r\n“The sheep of Champagne,” interpolated Achille Pigoult, interrupting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe candidate swallowed that shaft without reply, for he was forced at\r\nthat moment to go forward and receive two more influential electors.\r\n\r\nOne was the landlord of the Mulet, the best inn in Arcis, standing\r\non the Grande-Place at the corner of the rue de Brienne. This worthy\r\nlandlord, named Poupart, had married the sister of a man-servant\r\nattached to the Comtesse de Cinq-Cygne, the well-known Gothard, one of\r\nthe actors and witnesses in the Simeuse affair.\r\n\r\nPoupart, though a most devoted adherent of the Cinq-Cygne family, had\r\nbeen sounded during the last day or two, by Colonel Giguet’s valet,\r\nwith so much cleverness and perseverance that he thought he was doing an\r\nill-turn to the Comte de Gondreville, the enemy of the Cinq-Cygnes, by\r\ngiving his influence to the election of Simon Giguet; and he was now\r\nconversing on that point with the man who accompanied him, an apothecary\r\nnamed Fromaget, who, as he did not furnish his wares to the chateau de\r\nGondreville, desired nothing better than to cabal against the Kellers.\r\n\r\nThese two individuals of the lesser bourgeoisie could, in consequence\r\nof their connections, determine a certain number of floating votes, for\r\nthey influenced and advised a number of persons to whom the political\r\nopinions of the candidate were a matter of indifference. Consequently,\r\nSimon took possession of Poupart, and delivered the apothecary Fromaget\r\nto his father, who had just come in to make his bow to the electors.\r\n\r\nThe sub-engineer of the arrondissement, the secretary of the mayor’s\r\noffice, four sheriffs, three solicitors, the clerk of the court, and\r\nthe clerk of the justice of the peace, the registry-clerk, and the\r\ntax-collector, all officials under government, two doctors, rivals of\r\nVarlet, Grevin’s brother-in-law, a miller named Laurent Goussard, the\r\nhead of the republicans of Arcis, the two assistant mayors, the printer\r\nand publisher of Arcis, and about a dozen other bourgeois arrived in\r\nsuccession, and walked about the garden until the gathering seemed\r\nnumerous enough to admit of opening the session.\r\n\r\nAt length, about mid-day, fifty men, all in their best clothes,--most of\r\nthem having come out of curiosity to see the handsome salons which were\r\nmuch talked of throughout the arrondissement,--were seated on the chairs\r\nMadame Marion had provided for them. The windows were left open, and\r\npresently so deep a silence reigned that the rustle of Madame Marion’s\r\ngown was heard,--that good woman not being able to resist the pleasure\r\nof descending to the garden and placing herself in a corner whence she\r\ncould listen to what went on in the salon. The cook, the chamber-maid,\r\nand the man-servant stood in the dining-room and shared the emotions of\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said Simon Giguet, “some among you desire to honor my\r\nfather by asking him to preside at this meeting; but Colonel Giguet\r\nrequests me to present his thanks, and express due gratitude for a\r\ndesire in which he sees a reward for his services to the country. We are\r\nin his house; he thinks he ought, therefore, to decline those functions,\r\nand he desires to propose in his stead an honorable merchant on whom\r\nyour suffrages have already bestowed the chief magistracy of this town,\r\nMonsieur Phileas Beauvisage.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo! bravo!”\r\n\r\n“We are, I think, all of one mind in adopting for this\r\nmeeting--essentially friendly, but entirely free, which will prejudice\r\nin no way whatever the great preparatory and primary meeting in which\r\nyou will produce your candidates and weigh their merits--in adopting, as\r\nI said, the parliamentary and constitutional--forms--of the--electoral\r\nChamber.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” cried the assembly with one voice.\r\n\r\n“Consequently,” continued Simon, “I have the honor to request, according\r\nto the wish of all present, that his honor the mayor will now take the\r\nchair.”\r\n\r\nPhileas rose and crossed the salon, conscious that he was becoming as\r\nred as a cherry. Then, when he stood behind the table, he saw, not a\r\nhundred eyes, but a hundred thousand candles. The sun seemed to him to\r\nbe setting fire to the salon, and he had, to use his own expression, a\r\nlump of salt in his throat.\r\n\r\n“Return thanks,” said Simon, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs--”\r\n\r\nSuch total silence ensued that Phileas had a spasm of colic.\r\n\r\n“What must I say, Simon?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” exclaimed Achille Pigoult.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said Simon, goaded by the sarcastic interjection of the\r\nlittle notary, “the honor which you have done to Monsieur le Maire may\r\ntake him unawares, but it cannot surprise him.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” said Beauvisage; “I am too sensible of this attention on\r\nthe part of my fellow-citizens not to be excessively flattered by it.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” cried the notary alone.\r\n\r\n“The devil take me!” thought Beauvisage, “if I am ever caught haranguing\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Will Messieurs Fromaget and Marcelin accept the functions of inspectors\r\nof the ballot?”\r\n\r\n“It would be more regular,” said Achille Pigoult, rising, “if the\r\nmeeting itself nominated those officers,--following, of course, the\r\nparliamentary forms of the Chamber.”\r\n\r\n“That is best,” said the huge Monsieur Mollot, clerk of the court;\r\n“otherwise what is here taking place would be a mere farce; we should\r\nnot be free in our action, in which case we might as well continue to do\r\nthe will of Monsieur Simon Giguet.”\r\n\r\nSimon said a few words to Beauvisage, who rose and delivered himself of\r\na “Messieurs!” in palpitating tones.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Monsieur le president,” said Achille Pigoult, “the chairman\r\npresides, he does not speak.”\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” continued Beauvisage, prompted by Simon, “if we\r\nare--to conform--to parliamentary usage--I shall beg--the honorable\r\ngentleman--Monsieur Pigoult--to address the meeting--from this\r\ntable--here present--”\r\n\r\nPigoult sprang to the table, stood beside it with his fingers resting\r\nlightly on its edge, and gave proof of his boldness by delivering the\r\nfollowing speech without the slightest embarrassment, and somewhat after\r\nthe manner of the illustrious Monsieur Thiers.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs, it was not I who made that proposal for parliamentary\r\nusage; nevertheless I can conceive that an assemblage of some sixty\r\nnotabilities of Champagne needs a chairman to guide it; for no flock can\r\nget on without a shepherd. If we had voted for secret balloting, I am\r\ncertain that the name of our excellent mayor would have been returned\r\nunanimously. His opposition to the candidate put forward by his\r\nrelations proves to us that he possesses civic courage in the highest\r\ndegree, inasmuch as he has dared to free himself from the closest\r\nties--those of family. Patriotism before family! that is indeed so great\r\nan effort that, to make it, we are forced to believe that Brutus from\r\nhis realm of justice still contemplates us after the lapse of two\r\nthousand, five hundred and some years. It seemed natural to Maitre\r\nGiguet, who had the merit of divining our wishes in the choice of a\r\nchairman, to guide us still further in electing inspectors; but, if I am\r\nnot mistaken, you think with me that once is enough--and you are\r\nright. Our mutual friend, Simon Giguet, who intends to offer himself\r\nas candidate, would have the air of assuming mastery, and he might,\r\nconsequently, lose in our minds the good-will we should otherwise bestow\r\nupon a modest attitude like that of his venerable father. Now what is\r\nour worthy chairman doing at this moment by accepting the method of\r\npresiding suggested to him by the candidate? He is depriving us of our\r\nliberty! I ask you: is it proper that the chairman of our choice should\r\ntell us to nominate, by rising or sitting, inspectors of the ballot thus\r\nforced upon us? Have we any liberty of choice? If I were proposed, I\r\nbelieve all present would rise out of politeness; indeed, we should all\r\nfeel bound to rise for one another, and I say there can be no choice\r\nwhere there is no freedom of action.”\r\n\r\n“He is right,” said the sixty auditors.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, let us each write two names on a ballot, and the two\r\ngentlemen who are elected will then feel themselves the real choice of\r\nthis assembly; they will have the right, conjointly with our honorable\r\nchairman, to pronounce upon the majority when we come to a vote on\r\nthe resolutions to be offered. We are here, I think, to promise to a\r\ncandidate the fullest support that each can give at the coming\r\nprimary meeting of all the electors of the arrondissement. This act is\r\ntherefore, and I so declare it, a grave one. Does it not concern one\r\nfour-hundredth part of the governing power,--as our excellent mayor has\r\nlately said with the ready wit that characterizes him and for which we\r\nhave so high an appreciation?”\r\n\r\nDuring these remarks Colonel Giguet was cutting a sheet of paper into\r\nstrips, and Simon had sent for pens and ink.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary discussion on forms had already made Simon extremely\r\nuneasy, and had also aroused the attention of the sixty assembled\r\nbourgeois. Presently they began to write their ballots, and the wily\r\nPigoult contrived to obtain a majority for Monsieur Mollot, the clerk of\r\nthe court, and Monsieur Godivet, the registrar. These nominations were\r\nnaturally very displeasing to Fromaget, the apothecary, and Marcelin the\r\nsolicitor.\r\n\r\n“You enable us,” said Achille Pigoult, “to manifest our independence.\r\nTherefore you may feel more pride in being rejected than you could have\r\nfelt in being chosen.”\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed.\r\n\r\nSimon Giguet then produced silence by demanding speech of the chairman,\r\nwhose shirt was already wet and became still wetter as he mustered all\r\nhis courage to say:--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Simon Giguet has the floor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE FIRST PARLIAMENTARY TEMPEST\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said Simon Giguet, “I ask permission to thank Monsieur\r\nAchille Pigoult, who, although our meeting is altogether friendly--”\r\n\r\n“It is a meeting preparatory to the great primary meeting,” said the\r\nsolicitor Marcelin.\r\n\r\n“That is what I was about to explain,” resumed Simon, “I thank Monsieur\r\nAchille Pigoult for having insisted on the strictness of parliamentary\r\nforms. This is the first time that the arrondissement of Arcis has been\r\nat liberty to use--”\r\n\r\n“At liberty!” said Pigoult, interrupting the orator.\r\n\r\n“At liberty!” cried the assembly.\r\n\r\n“At liberty,” continued Simon Giguet, “to use its rights in the great\r\nbattle of a general election to the Chamber of Deputies; and as, in\r\na few days, we shall have a meeting, at which all electors will be\r\npresent, to judge of the merits of the candidates, we ought to feel\r\nourselves most fortunate in becoming accustomed here, in this limited\r\nmeeting, to the usages of great assemblies. We shall be all the more\r\nable to decide the political future of the town of Arcis; for the\r\nquestion now is to substitute a town’s interests for family interests, a\r\nwhole region for a man.”\r\n\r\nSimon then reviewed the history of the Arcis elections for the last\r\ntwenty years. While approving the constant election of Francois Keller,\r\nhe said the moment had now come to shake off the yoke of the house of\r\nGondreville. Arcis ought to be no more a fief of the liberals than a\r\nfief of the Cinq-Cygnes. Advanced opinions were arising in France of\r\nwhich the Kellers were not the exponents. Charles Keller, having become\r\na viscount, belonged to the court; he could have no independence,\r\nbecause, in presenting him as candidate, his family thought much more\r\nof making him succeed to his father’s peerage than of benefiting his\r\nconstituency as deputy, etc., etc. And, finally, Simon presented himself\r\nto the choice of his fellow-citizens, pledging his word to sit on the\r\nsame bench with the illustrious Odilon Barrot, and never to desert the\r\nglorious flag of Progress.\r\n\r\n_Progress_! one of those words behind which more flimsy ambitions than\r\nideas were trying to group themselves; for, after 1830, it represented\r\nonly the pretensions of a few hungry democrats. Nevertheless, this word\r\nhad still a great effect upon Arcis, and gave stability to whosoever\r\nmight inscribe it on his banner. To call himself a man of progress\r\nwas to declare himself a philosopher in all things and a puritan\r\nin politics; it declared him in favor of railroads, mackintoshes,\r\npenitentiaries, wooden pavements, Negro freedom, savings-banks, seamless\r\nshoes, lighting by gas, asphalt pavements, universal suffrage, and\r\nreduction of the civil list. In short, it meant pronouncing himself\r\nagainst the treaties of 1815, against the Eldest Branch, against the\r\ncolossus of the North, perfidious Albion, against all enterprises, good\r\nor bad, of the government. Thus we see that the word _progress_ might\r\nsignify “No,” as well as “Yes.” It was gilding put upon the word\r\n_liberalism_, a new pass-word for new ambitions.\r\n\r\n“If I have rightly understood what this meeting is for,” said Jean\r\nViolette, a stocking-maker, who had recently bought the Beauvisage\r\nhouse, “it is to pledge ourselves to support, by employing every means\r\nin our power, Monsieur Simon Giguet at the elections as deputy in place\r\nof Comte Francois Keller. If each of us intends to coalesce in this\r\nmanner we have only to say plainly Yes or No on that point.”\r\n\r\n“That is going too quickly to the point! Political affairs do not\r\nadvance in that way, or there would be no politics at all!” cried\r\nPigoult, whose old grandfather, eighty-six years old, had just entered\r\nthe room. “The last speaker undertakes to decide what seems to me,\r\naccording to my feeble lights, the very object we are met to discuss. I\r\ndemand permission to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Achille Pigoult has the floor,” said Beauvisage, at last\r\nable to pronounce that phrase with all his municipal and constitutional\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said the notary, “if there is a house in Arcis in which\r\nno voice should be raised against the influence of the Comte de\r\nGondreville, it is surely the one we are now in. The worthy Colonel\r\nGiguet is the only person in it who has not sought the benefits of the\r\nsenatorial power; he, at least, has never asked anything of the Comte de\r\nGondreville, who took his name off the list of exiles in 1815 and caused\r\nhim to receive the pension which the colonel now enjoys without lifting\r\na finger to obtain it.”\r\n\r\nA murmur, flattering to the old soldier, greeted this observation.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued the orator, “the Marions are covered with the count’s\r\nbenefits. Without that influence, the late Colonel Giguet would not have\r\ncommanded the gendarmerie of the Aube. The late Monsieur Marion would\r\nnot have been chief-justice of the Imperial court without the protection\r\nof the count, to whom I myself have every reason to be thankful. You\r\nwill therefore think it natural that I should be his advocate within\r\nthese walls. There are, indeed, few persons in this arrondissement who\r\nhave not received benefits from that family.”\r\n\r\n[Murmurs.]\r\n\r\n“A candidate puts himself in the stocks,” continued Achille Pigoult,\r\nwarming up. “I have the right to scrutinize his life before I invest him\r\nwith my powers. I do not desire ingratitude in the delegate I may\r\nhelp to send to the Chamber, for ingratitude is like misfortune--one\r\ningratitude leads to others. We have been, he tells us, the\r\nstepping-stone of the Kellers; well, from what I have heard here, I am\r\nafraid we may become the stepping-stone of the Giguets. We live in a\r\npractical age, do we not? Well, then, let us examine into what will be\r\nthe results to the arrondissement of Arcis if Simon Giguet is elected.\r\nThey talk to you of independence! Simon, whom I thus maltreat as\r\ncandidate, is my personal friend, as he is that of all who hear me, and\r\nI should myself be charmed to see him the orator of the Left, seated\r\nbetween Garnier-Pages and Lafitte; but how would that benefit the\r\narrondissement? The arrondissement would lose the support of the Comte\r\nde Gondreville and the Kellers. We all, in the course of five years,\r\nhave had and shall have need of the one and of the others. Some have\r\ngone to the Marechale de Carigliano to obtain the release of a young\r\nfellow who had drawn a bad number. Others have had recourse to the\r\ninfluence of the Kellers in many matters which are decided according to\r\ntheir recommendation. We have always found the old Comte de Gondreville\r\nready to do us service. It is enough to belong to Arcis to obtain\r\nadmission to him without being forced to kick our heels in his\r\nantechamber. Those two families know every one in Arcis. Where is the\r\nfinancial influence of the Giguets, and what power have they with the\r\nministry? Have they any standing at the Bourse? When we want to replace\r\nour wretched wooden bridge with one of stone can they obtain from the\r\ndepartment and the State the necessary funds? By electing Charles Keller\r\nwe shall cement a bond of friendship which has never, to this day,\r\nfailed to do us service. By electing my good, my excellent schoolmate,\r\nmy worthy friend Simon Giguet, we shall realize nothing but losses until\r\nthe far-distant time when he becomes a minister. I know his modesty well\r\nenough to be certain he will not contradict me when I say that I doubt\r\nhis election to the post of deputy.” [Laughter.] “I have come to\r\nthis meeting to oppose a course which I regard as fatal to our\r\narrondissement. Charles Keller belongs to the court, they say to me.\r\nWell, so much the better! we shall not have to pay the costs of his\r\npolitical apprenticeship; he knows the affairs of the country; he knows\r\nparliamentary necessities; he is much nearer being a statesman than\r\nmy friend Simon, who will not pretend to have made himself a Pitt or a\r\nTalleyrand in a little town like Arcis--”\r\n\r\n“Danton went from it!” cried Colonel Giguet, furious at Achille’s speech\r\nand the justice of it.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!”\r\n\r\nThis was an acclamation, and sixty persons clapped their hands.\r\n\r\n“My father has a ready wit,” whispered Simon Giguet to Beauvisage.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand why, apropos of an election,” continued the old\r\ncolonel, rising suddenly, with the blood boiling in his face, “we\r\nshould be hauled up for the ties which connect us with the Comte de\r\nGondreville. My son’s fortune comes from his mother; he has asked\r\nnothing of the Comte de Gondreville. The comte might never have existed\r\nand Simon would have been what he now is,--the son of a colonel of\r\nartillery who owes his rank to his services; a man whose opinions have\r\nnever varied. I should say openly to the Comte de Gondreville if he were\r\npresent: ‘We have elected your son-in-law for twenty years; to-day we\r\nwish to prove that in so doing we acted of our own free-will, and we now\r\nelect a man of Arcis, in order to show that the old spirit of 1789, to\r\nwhich you owe your fortune, still lives in the land of Danton, Malin,\r\nGrevin, Pigoult, Marion--That is all!”\r\n\r\nAnd the old man sat down. Whereupon a great hubbub arose. Achille opened\r\nhis mouth to reply. Beauvisage, who would not have thought himself\r\nchairman unless he had rung his bell, increased the racket, and called\r\nfor silence. It was then two o’clock.\r\n\r\n“I shall take the liberty to observe to the honorable Colonel Giguet,\r\nwhose feelings are easily understood, that he took upon himself to\r\nspeak, which is against parliamentary usage,” said Achille Pigoult.\r\n\r\n“I think it is not necessary to call the colonel to order,” said the\r\nchairman. “He is a father--”\r\n\r\nSilence was re-established.\r\n\r\n“We did not come here,” cried Fromaget, “to say Amen to everything the\r\nMessieurs Giguet, father and son, may wish--”\r\n\r\n“No! no!” cried the assembly.\r\n\r\n“Things are going badly,” said Madame Marion to her cook in the garden.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” resumed Achille, “I confine myself to asking my friend\r\nSimon Giguet, categorically, what he expects to do for our interests.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! yes!” cried the assembly.\r\n\r\n“Since when,” demanded Simon Giguet, “have good citizens like those of\r\nArcis made trade and barter of the sacred mission of deputy?”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to represent the effect produced by noble sentiments on\r\na body of men. They will applaud fine maxims, while they none the less\r\nvote for the degradation of their country, like the galley-slave who\r\nshouted for the punishment of Robert Macaire when he saw the thing\r\nplayed, and then went off and killed his own Monsieur Germeuil.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” cried several true-blood Giguet electors.\r\n\r\n“You will send me to the Chamber,” went on Simon, “if you do send me, to\r\nrepresent principles, the principles of 1789; to be one of the ciphers,\r\nif you choose, of the Opposition, but a cipher that votes with it to\r\nenlighten the government, make war against abuses, and promote progress\r\nin all things--”\r\n\r\n“What do you call progress?” asked Fromaget. “For us, progress means\r\ngetting the waste lands of la Champagne under cultivation.”\r\n\r\n“Progress! I will explain to you what I mean by that,” cried Giguet,\r\nexasperated by the interruption.\r\n\r\n“It is the frontier of the Rhine for France,” put in the colonel, “and\r\nthe destruction of the treaties of 1815.”\r\n\r\n“It is selling wheat dear and keeping bread cheap,” cried Achille\r\nPigoult sarcastically, thinking that he made a joke, but actually\r\nexpressing one of the delusions that reign in France.\r\n\r\n“It is the happiness of all, obtained by the triumph of humanitarian\r\ndoctrines,” continued Simon.\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said Achille to his neighbors.\r\n\r\n“Hush! silence! let us listen!” said various voices.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said the stout Mollot, smiling, “the debate is beginning;\r\ngive your attention to the orator; and let him explain himself.”\r\n\r\n“In all transitional epochs, Messieurs,” continued Simon, gravely, “and\r\nwe are now in such an epoch--”\r\n\r\n“Ba-a-a! ba-a-a!” bleated a friend of Achille Pigoult, who possessed the\r\nfaculty (precious at elections) of ventriloquism.\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter came from the whole assembly, who were Champagnards\r\nbefore all else. Simon Giguet folded his arms and waited till the tumult\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\n“If it was intended to give me a lesson,” he resumed, “and to tell me\r\nthat I belong to the flock of the glorious defenders of the rights of\r\nhumanity, the flock of the immortal priest who pleads for dying Poland,\r\nthe daring pamphleteers, the scrutinizers of the civil test, the\r\nphilosophers who demand sincerity in the working of our institutions, if\r\nthat was the intention of my nameless interrupter, I thank him. To\r\nme, progress is the realization of all that was promised to us by the\r\nrevolution of July; it is electoral reform, it is--”\r\n\r\n“What! are you a democrat?” said Achille Pigoult.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the candidate. “To desire the legitimate and regular\r\ndevelopment of our institutions, is that being a democrat? To me,\r\nprogress is fraternity re-established between the members of the great\r\nFrench family. We cannot conceal from ourselves that many sufferings--”\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock Simon Giguet was still explaining Progress, accompanied\r\nby the rhythmic snores of various electors which denoted a sound\r\nsleep. The malicious Achille Pigoult had urged all present to listen\r\nreligiously to the young orator, who was now floundering in his phrases\r\nand paraphrases hopelessly at random.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE PERPLEXITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN ARCIS\r\n\r\nAt this moment several groups of bourgeois, electors and non-electors,\r\nwere standing before the Chateau d’Arcis, the iron gates of which open\r\non the square near to the door of Madame Marion’s house. This square\r\nis a piece of open ground from which issue several roads and several\r\nstreets. In it is a covered market. Opposite to the chateau, on the\r\nother side of the square, which is neither paved nor macadamized, and\r\nwhere the rain has made various little gutters, is a fine esplanade,\r\ncalled the Avenue of Sighs. Is that to the honor or to the blame of the\r\nleaders of the town? This singular ambibology is no doubt a stroke of\r\nnative wit.\r\n\r\nTwo handsome side avenues, planted with lindens, lead from the square\r\nto a circular boulevard which forms another promenade, though usually\r\ndeserted, where more dirt and rubbish than promenaders may commonly be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nAt the height of the discussion which Achille Pigoult was dramatizing\r\nwith a coolness and courage worthy of a member of a real parliament,\r\nfour personages were walking down one of the linden avenues which led\r\nfrom the Avenue of Sighs. When they reached the square, they stopped as\r\nif by common consent, and looked at the inhabitants of Arcis, who were\r\nhumming before the chateau like so many bees before returning to their\r\nhives at night. The four promenaders were the whole ministerial\r\nconclave of Arcis, namely: the sub-prefect, the _procureur-du-roi_, his\r\nsubstitute, and the examining-judge, Monsieur Martener. The judge of the\r\ncourt, Monsieur Michu, was, as we know already, a partisan of the Elder\r\nBranch and a devoted adherent of the house of Cinq-Cygne.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t understand the action of the government,” repeated the\r\nsub-prefect, Antonin Goulard, pointing to the groups which seemed to\r\nbe thickening. “At such an important crisis to leave me without\r\ninstructions!”\r\n\r\n“In that you are like the rest of us,” said Olivier Vinet, the\r\nsubstitute, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Why do you blame the government?” asked the _procureur-du-roi_,\r\nFrederic Marest.\r\n\r\n“The ministry is much embarrassed,” remarked young Martener. “It knows\r\nthat this arrondissement belongs, in a certain way, to the Kellers, and\r\nit is very desirous not to thwart them. It is forced to keep on good\r\nterms with the only man who is comparable to Monsieur de Talleyrand. It\r\nis not to the prefect, but to the Comte de Gondreville that you ought to\r\nsend the commissary of police.”\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile,” said Frederic Marest, “the Opposition is bestirring itself;\r\nyou see yourselves the influence of Monsieur Giguet. Our mayor, Monsieur\r\nBeauvisage, is presiding over that preparatory meeting.”\r\n\r\n“After all,” said Olivier Vinet slyly to the sub-prefect, “Simon Giguet\r\nis your friend and schoolmate; he will belong to the Thiers’ party; you\r\nrisk nothing in supporting his election.”\r\n\r\n“The present ministry could dismiss me before its fall,” replied the\r\nsub-prefect, “and who knows when I should be reappointed?”\r\n\r\n“Collinet, the grocer!--that makes the sixty-sixth elector who has\r\nentered the Giguet house,” said Monsieur Martener, who was practising\r\nhis trade as examining-judge by counting the electors.\r\n\r\n“If Charles Keller is the ministerial candidate,” resumed the\r\nsub-prefect, “I ought to have been told of it; the government makes a\r\nmistake in giving time for Simon Giguet to get hold of the electors.”\r\n\r\nThese four individuals had now reached, walking slowly, the spot where\r\nthe avenue ceases and becomes an open square.\r\n\r\n“There’s Monsieur Groslier,” said the judge, catching sight of a man on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nThis was the commissary of police; he saw the government of Arcis\r\ncollected on the public square, and he rode up to the four gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur Groslier?” said the sub-prefect, taking the commissary a\r\nlittle apart from his three colleagues.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the commissary of police in a low voice, “Monsieur\r\nla prefet has sent me to tell you some sad news; Monsieur le Vicomte\r\nCharles Keller is dead. The news reached Paris by telegram night before\r\nlast, and the two Messieurs Keller, the Comte de Gondreville, the\r\nMarechale Carigliano, in fact the whole family are now at Gondreville.\r\nAbd-el-Kader has resumed the offensive in Africa; the war is being\r\nvigorously carried on. This poor young man was among the first\r\nvictims of the renewal of hostilities. You will receive confidential\r\ninstructions, so Monsieur le prefet told me, in relation to the coming\r\nelection.”\r\n\r\n“By whom?” asked the sub-prefect.\r\n\r\n“If I knew that, the matter would not be confidential,” replied the\r\ncommissary. “In fact, I think the prefect himself does not know. He told\r\nme that the matter would be a secret one between you and the ministry.”\r\n\r\nThen he rode on, after seeing the sub-prefect lay his fingers on his\r\nlips as a warning to keep silence.\r\n\r\n“Well, what news from the prefecture?” said the _procureur-du-roi_, when\r\nGoulard returned to the group of the three functionaries.\r\n\r\n“Nothing satisfactory,” replied Goulard, stepping quickly, as if he\r\nwanted to get away from the others, who now walked silently toward the\r\nmiddle of the square, somewhat piqued by the manner of the sub-prefect.\r\nThere Monsieur Martener noticed old Madame Beauvisage, the mother of\r\nPhileas, surrounded by nearly all the bourgeois on the square, to whom\r\nshe was apparently relating something. A solicitor, named Sinot, who\r\nnumbered all the royalists of Arcis among his clients, and who had not\r\ngone to the Giguet meeting, now detached himself from the group, and\r\nrunning to the door of the Marion house rang the bell violently.\r\n\r\n“What can be the matter?” said Frederic Marest, dropping his eyeglass,\r\nand calling the attention of his colleagues to this circumstance.\r\n\r\n“The matter is, messieurs,” said the sub-prefect, thinking it useless\r\nto keep a secret which was evidently known to the other party, “that\r\nCharles Keller has been killed in Africa, and that this event doubles\r\nthe chances of Simon Giguet. You know Arcis; there can be no other\r\nministerial candidate than Charles Keller. Any other man would find the\r\nwhole local patriotism of the place arrayed against him.\r\n\r\n“Will they really elect such an idiot as Simon Giguet?” said Olivier\r\nVinet, laughing.\r\n\r\nThis young substitute, then only twenty-three years of age, was the son\r\nof one of our most famous attorney-generals, who had come into power\r\nwith the Revolution of July; he therefore owed his early entrance into\r\npublic life to the influence of his father. The latter, always elected\r\ndeputy by the town of Provins, is one of the buttresses of the Centre\r\nin the Chamber. Therefore the son, whose mother was a Demoiselle de\r\nChargeboeuf [see “Pierrette”], had a certain air of assurance, both\r\nin his functions and in his personal behavior, that plainly showed\r\nthe backing of his father. He expressed his opinion on men and things\r\nwithout reserve; for he confidently expected not to stay very long\r\nat Arcis, but to receive his appointment as _procureur-du-roi_ at\r\nVersailles, a sure step to a post in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe confident air of this little Vinet, and the sort of assumption which\r\nthe certainty of making his way gave to him, was all the more irritating\r\nto Frederic Marest, his superior, because a biting wit accompanied\r\nthe rather undisciplined habits and manners of his young subordinate.\r\nFrederic Marest, _procureur-du-roi_, a man about forty years of age,\r\nwho had spent six years of his life under the Restoration in becoming a\r\nsubstitute only to be neglected and left in Arcis by the government of\r\nJuly, in spite of the fact that he had some eighteen thousand francs a\r\nyear of his own, was perpetually kept on the rack between the\r\nnecessity of winning the good graces of young Vinet’s father--a touchy\r\nattorney-general who might become Keeper of the Seals--and of keeping\r\nhis own dignity.\r\n\r\nOlivier Vinet, slender in figure, with a pallid face, lighted by a pair\r\nof malicious green eyes, was one of those sarcastic young gentlemen,\r\ninclined to dissipation, who nevertheless know how to assume the\r\npompous, haughty, and pedantic air with which magistrates arm themselves\r\nwhen they once reach the bench. The tall, stout, heavy, and grave\r\n_procureur-du-roi_ had lately invented a system by which he hoped to\r\nkeep out of trouble with the exasperating Olivier; he treated him as a\r\nfather would treat a spoilt child.\r\n\r\n“Olivier,” he replied to his substitute, slapping him on the shoulder,\r\n“a man of your capacity ought to reflect that Maitre Giguet is very\r\nlikely to become deputy. You’d have made that remark just as readily\r\nbefore the people of Arcis as before us, who are safe friends.”\r\n\r\n“There is one thing against Giguet,” observed Monsieur Martener.\r\n\r\nThis good young man, rather heavy but full of capacity, the son of a\r\nphysician in Provins, owed his place to Vinet’s father, who was long a\r\nlawyer in Provins and still continued to be the patron of his people as\r\nthe Comte de Gondreville was the patron of the people of Arcis.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked the sub-prefect.\r\n\r\n“Local patriotism is always bitterly against a man who is imposed upon\r\nthe electors,” replied the examining-judge, “but when it happens that\r\nthe good people of Arcis have to elevate one of their own equals to the\r\nChamber, envy and jealousy are stronger than patriotism.”\r\n\r\n“That is very simple,” said the _procureur-du-roi_, “and very true. If\r\nyou can manage to collect fifty ministerial votes you will find yourself\r\nmaster of the coming election,” he added, addressing the sub-prefect.\r\n\r\n“It will do if you produce a candidate of the same calibre as Simon\r\nGiguet,” said Olivier Vinet.\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect allowed an expression of satisfaction to appear upon his\r\nfeatures, which did not escape the notice of his three companions, with\r\nwhom, moreover, he had a full understanding. All four being bachelors,\r\nand tolerably rich, they had formed, without premeditation, an alliance\r\nagainst the dulness of the provinces. The three functionaries had\r\nalready remarked the sort of jealousy that Goulard felt for Giguet,\r\nwhich a few words on their antecedents will explain.\r\n\r\nAntonin Goulard, the son of a former huntsman to the house of Simeuse,\r\nenriched by the purchase of the confiscated property of _emigres_ was,\r\nlike Simon Giguet, a son of Arcis. Old Goulard, his father, left the\r\nabbey of Valpreux (corruption of Val-des-Preux) to live in Arcis after\r\nthe death of his wife, and he sent his son to the imperial lyceum, where\r\nColonel Giguet had already placed his son Simon. The two schoolmates\r\nsubsequently went through their legal studies in Paris together, and\r\ntheir intimacy was continued in the amusements of youth. They promised\r\nto help each other to success in life whenever they entered upon their\r\ndifferent careers. But fate willed that they should end by being rivals.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Goulard’s manifest advantages, in spite of the cross of the\r\nLegion of honor which the Comte de Gondreville had obtained for him\r\nin default of promotion, the offer of his heart and position had been\r\nfrankly declined when, about six months before this history begins, he\r\nhad privately presented himself to Madame Beauvisage as a suitor for her\r\ndaughter’s hand. No step of that nature is ever taken secretly in the\r\nprovinces. The _procureur-du-roi_, Frederic Marest, whose fortune,\r\nbuttonhole, and position were about on a par with those of Antonin\r\nGoulard, had received a like refusal, three years earlier, based on the\r\ndifference of ages. Consequently, the two officials were on terms\r\nof strict politeness with the Beauvisage family, and laughed at them\r\nseverally in private. Both had divined and communicated to each other\r\nthe real motive of the candidacy of Simon Giguet, for they fully\r\nunderstood the hopes of Madame Marion; and they were bent on preventing\r\nher nephew from marrying the heiress whose hand had been refused to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“God grant that I may be master of this election,” said Goulard, “and\r\nthat the Comte de Gondreville may get me made a prefect, for I have no\r\nmore desire than you to spend the rest of my days here, though I was\r\nborn in Arcis.”\r\n\r\n“You have a fine opportunity to be elected deputy yourself, my chief,”\r\n said Olivier Vinet to Marest. “Come and see my father, who will, I\r\nthink, arrive here from Provins in a few hours. Let us propose to him to\r\nhave you chosen as ministerial candidate.”\r\n\r\n“Halt!” said Antonin; “the ministry has its own views about the deputy\r\nof Arcis.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, bah!” exclaimed Vinet, “there are two ministries: the one that\r\nthinks it makes elections, and another that thinks it profits by them.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us complicate Antonin’s difficulties,” said Frederic Marest,\r\nwinking at his substitute.\r\n\r\nThe four officials, who had crossed the open square and were close to\r\nthe Mulet inn, now saw Poupart leaving the house of Madame Marion and\r\ncoming towards them. A moment later, and the _porte cochere_ of that\r\nhouse vomited the sixty-seven conspirators.\r\n\r\n“So you went to that meeting?” said Antonin Goulard to Poupart.\r\n\r\n“I shall never go again, monsieur le sous-prefet,” said the innkeeper.\r\n“The son of Monsieur Keller is dead, and I have now no object in going\r\nthere. God has taken upon himself to clear the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pigoult, what happened?” cried Olivier Vinet, catching sight of\r\nthe young notary.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Pigoult, on whose forehead the perspiration, which had not\r\ndried, bore testimony to his efforts, “Simon has just told some\r\nnews that made them all unanimous. Except five persons,--Poupart, my\r\ngrandfather, Mollot, Sinot, and I,--all present swore, as at the Jeu de\r\nPaume, to employ every means to promote the triumph of Simon Giguet,\r\nof whom I have made a mortal enemy. Oh! we got warm, I can tell you!\r\nHowever, I led the Giguets to fulminate against the Gondrevilles. That\r\nputs the old count on my side. No later than to-morrow he will hear\r\nwhat the _soi-disant_ patriots of Arcis have said about him and his\r\ncorruptions and his infamies, to free their necks, as they called it, of\r\nhis yoke.”\r\n\r\n“Unanimous, were they?” said Olivier Vinet, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Unanimous, _to-day_,” remarked Monsieur Martener.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Pigoult, “the general sentiment of the electors is for\r\none of their own townsmen. Whom can you oppose to Simon Giguet,--a man\r\nwho has just spent two hours in explaining the word _progress_.”\r\n\r\n“Take old Grevin!” cried the sub-prefect.\r\n\r\n“He has no such ambition,” replied Pigoult. “But we must first of\r\nall consult the Comte de Gondreville. Look, look!” he added; “see\r\nthe attentions with which Simon is taking him that gilded booby,\r\nBeauvisage.”\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed to the candidate, who was holding the mayor by the arm\r\nand whispering in his ear. Beauvisage meantime was bowing right and\r\nleft to the inhabitants, who gazed at him with the deference which\r\nprovincials always testify to the richest man in their locality.\r\n\r\n“But there’s no use cajoling _him_,” continued Pigoult. “Cecile’s hand\r\ndoes not depend on either her father or her mother.”\r\n\r\n“On whom, then?”\r\n\r\n“On my old patron, Monsieur Grevin. Even if Simon is elected deputy, the\r\ntown is not won.”\r\n\r\nThough the sub-prefect and Frederic Marest tried to get an explanation\r\nof these words, Pigoult refused to give the reason of an exclamation\r\nwhich seemed to them big with meaning and implying a certain knowledge\r\nof the plans of the Beauvisage family.\r\n\r\nAll Arcis was now in a commotion, not only on account of the fatal event\r\nwhich had just overtaken the Gondreville family, but because of the\r\ngreat resolution come to at the Giguet house, where Madame Marion and\r\nher three servants were hurriedly engaged in putting everything in its\r\nusual order, ready to receive her customary guests, whose curiosity\r\nwould probably bring them that evening in large numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE CAMPAIGN OF 1814 FROM THE HOSIERY POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\nChampagne has all the appearance of a poor region, and it is a poor\r\nregion. Its general aspect is sad; the land is flat. Passing through\r\nthe villages, and even the towns, you will see nothing but miserable\r\nbuildings of wood or half-baked clay; the best are built of brick.\r\nStone is scarcely used at all except on public buildings. At Arcis the\r\nchateau, the law courts, and the church are the only stone buildings.\r\nNevertheless, Champagne, or, if you prefer to say so, the departments of\r\nthe Aube, Marne, and Haut-Marne, richly endowed with vineyards, the fame\r\nof which is world-wide, are otherwise full of flourishing industries.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking of the manufactures of Reims, nearly all the hosiery\r\nof France--a very considerable trade--is manufactured about Troyes. The\r\nsurrounding country, over a circuit of thirty miles, is covered with\r\nworkmen, whose looms can be seen through the open doors as we pass\r\nthrough the villages. These workmen are employed by agents, who\r\nthemselves are in the service of speculators called manufacturers. The\r\nagents negotiate with the large Parisian houses, often with the retail\r\nhosiers, all of whom put out the sign, “Manufacturers of Hosiery.” None\r\nof them have ever made a pair of stockings, nor a cap, nor a sock;\r\nall their hosiery comes chiefly from Champagne, though there are a few\r\nskilled workmen in Paris who can rival the Champenois.\r\n\r\nThis intermediate agency between the producer and the consumer is\r\nan evil not confined to hosiery. It exists in almost all trades, and\r\nincreases the cost of merchandise by the amount of the profit exacted\r\nby the middlemen. To break down these costly partitions, that injure\r\nthe sale of products, would be a magnificent enterprise, which, in its\r\nresults, would attain to the height of statesmanship. In fact, industry\r\nof all kinds would gain by establishing within our borders the cheapness\r\nso essential to enable us to carry on victoriously the industrial\r\nwarfare with foreign countries,--a struggle as deadly as that of arms.\r\n\r\nBut the destruction of an abuse of this kind would not return to modern\r\nphilanthropists the glory and the advantages of a crusade against the\r\nempty nutshells of the penitentiary and negrophobia; consequently, the\r\ninterloping profits of these _bankers of merchandise_ will continue to\r\nweigh heavily both on producers and consumers. In France--keen-witted\r\nland!--it is thought that to simplify is to destroy. The Revolution of\r\n1789 is still a terror.\r\n\r\nWe see, by the industrial energy displayed in a land where Nature is a\r\ngodmother, what progress agriculture might make if capital would go into\r\npartnership with the soil, which is not so thankless in Champagne as it\r\nis in Scotland, where capital has done wonders. The day when agriculture\r\nwill have conquered the unfertile portion of those departments, and\r\nindustry has seconded capital on the Champagne chalk, the prosperity\r\nof that region will triple itself. Into that land, now without luxury,\r\nwhere homes are barren, English comfort will penetrate, money will\r\nobtain that rapid circulation which is the half of wealth, and is\r\nalready beginning in several of the inert portions of our country.\r\nWriters, administrators, the Church from its pulpit, the Press in its\r\ncolumns, all to whom chance has given power to influence the masses,\r\nshould say and resay this truth,--to hoard is a social crime. The\r\ndeliberate hoarding of a province arrests industrial life, and injures\r\nthe health of a nation.\r\n\r\nThus the little town of Arcis, without much means of transition, doomed\r\napparently to the most complete immobility, is, relatively, a rich town\r\nabounding in capital slowly amassed by its trade in hosiery.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Phileas Beauvisage was the Alexander, or, if you will, the\r\nAttila of this business. And here follow the means by which this\r\nhonorable merchant had acquired his supremacy over cotton.\r\n\r\nThe last remaining child of farmers named Beauvisage, tenants of the\r\nsplendid farm of Bellache, a dependency of the Gondreville estate, his\r\nparents made, in 1811, a great sacrifice in order to buy a substitute\r\nand save their only child from conscription. After that, in 1813, the\r\nmother Beauvisage, having become a widow, saved her son once more\r\nfrom enrolment in the Gardes, thanks to the influence of the Comte de\r\nGondreville. Phileas, who was then twenty-one years of age, had been\r\ndevoted for the last three years to the peaceable trade of hosiery.\r\n\r\nComing to the end of the lease of Bellache, old Madame Beauvisage\r\ndeclined to renew it. She saw she had enough to do in her old age in\r\ntaking care of her property. That nothing might give her uneasiness\r\nof mind, she proceeded, by the help of Monsieur Grevin, the notary\r\nof Arcis, to liquidate her husband’s estate, although her son made no\r\nrequest whatever for a settlement. The result proved that she owed him\r\nthe sum of one hundred and fifty thousand francs. The good woman did not\r\nsell her landed property, most of which came from the unfortunate Michu,\r\nthe former bailiff of the Simeuse family; she paid the sum to Phileas\r\nin ready money,--advising him to buy out the business of his employer,\r\nMonsieur Pigoult, the son of the old justice of the peace, whose affairs\r\nwere in so bad a way that his death, as we have said, was thought to be\r\nvoluntary.\r\n\r\nPhileas Beauvisage, a virtuous youth, having a deep respect for his\r\nmother, concluded the purchase from his patron, and as he had the bump\r\nof what phrenologists term “acquisitiveness,” his youthful ardor spent\r\nitself upon this business, which he thought magnificent and desired to\r\nincrease by speculation.\r\n\r\nThe name of Phileas, which may seem peculiar, is only one of the many\r\noddities which we owe to the Revolution. Attached to the Simeuse family,\r\nand consequently, good Catholics, the Beauvisage father and mother\r\ndesired to have their son baptized. The rector of Cinq-Cygne, the Abbe\r\nGoujet, whom they consulted, advised them to give their son for patron\r\na saint whose Greek name might signify the municipality,--for the child\r\nwas born at a period when children were inscribed on the civil registers\r\nunder the fantastic names of the Republican calendar.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, hosiery, a stable business with few risks in ordinary times,\r\nwas subject to all the variations in the price of cotton. This price\r\ndepended at that time on the triumph or the defeat of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon, whose adversaries, the English generals, used to say in Spain:\r\n“The town is taken; now get out your bales.”\r\n\r\nPigoult, former patron of young Phileas, furnished the raw material to\r\nhis workmen, who were scattered all over the country. At the time when\r\nhe sold the business to Beauvisage junior, he possessed a large amount\r\nof raw cotton bought at a high price, whereas Lisbon was sending\r\nenormous quantities into the Empire at six sous the kilogramme, in\r\nvirtue of the Emperor’s celebrated decree. The reaction produced in\r\nFrance by the introduction of the Portuguese cotton caused the death of\r\nPigoult, Achille’s father, and began the fortune of Phileas, who, far\r\nfrom losing his head like his master, made his prices moderate by\r\nbuying cotton cheaply and in doubling the quantity ventured upon by\r\nhis predecessor. This simple system enabled Phileas to triple the\r\nmanufacture and to pose as the benefactor of the workingmen; so that\r\nhe was able to disperse his hosiery in Paris and all over France at\r\na profit, when the luckiest of his competitors were only able to sell\r\ntheir goods at cost price.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1814, Phileas had emptied his warerooms. The\r\nprospect of a war on French soil, the hardships of which were likely to\r\npress chiefly on Champagne, made him cautious. He manufactured nothing,\r\nand held himself ready to meet all events with his capital turned into\r\ngold. At this period the custom-house lines were no longer maintained.\r\nNapoleon could not do without his thirty thousand custom-house officers\r\nfor service in the field. Cotton, then introduced through a thousand\r\nloopholes, slipped into the markets of France. No one can imagine\r\nhow sly and how alert cotton had become at this epoch, nor with what\r\neagerness the English laid hold of a country where cotton stockings sold\r\nfor six francs a pair, and cambric shirts were objects of luxury.\r\n\r\nManufacturers from the second class, the principal workmen, reckoning on\r\nthe genius of Napoleon, had bought up the cottons that came from Spain.\r\nThey worked it up in hopes of being able later to give the law to the\r\nmerchants of Paris. Phileas observed these facts. When the war ravaged\r\nChampagne, he kept himself between the French army and Paris. After each\r\nlost battle he went among the workmen who had buried their products in\r\ncasks,--a sort of silo of hosiery,--then, gold in hand, this Cossack\r\nof weaving bought up, from village to village, below the cost of\r\nfabrication, tons of merchandise which might otherwise become at\r\nany time a prey to an enemy whose feet were as much in need of being\r\n_socked_ as its throat of being moistened.\r\n\r\nPhileas displayed under these unfortunate circumstances an activity\r\nnearly equal to that of the Emperor. This general of hosiery made a\r\ncommercial campaign of 1814 with splendid but ignored courage. A league\r\nor two behind where the army advanced he bought up caps and socks as\r\nthe Emperor gathered immortal palms by his very reverses. The genius was\r\nequal on both sides, though exercised in different spheres; one aimed\r\nat covering heads, the other at mowing them down. Obliged to create some\r\nmeans of transportation in order to save his tons of hosiery, which he\r\nstored in a suburb of Paris, Phileas often put in requisition horses\r\nand army-waggons, as if the safety of the empire were concerned. But\r\nthe majesty of commerce was surely as precious as that of Napoleon. The\r\nEnglish merchants, in buying out the European markets, certainly got the\r\nbetter of the colossus who threatened their trade.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Emperor abdicated at Fontainebleau, Phileas, triumphant,\r\nwas master of the situation. He maintained, by clever manoeuvring, the\r\ndepreciation in cottons, and doubled his fortune at the moment when his\r\nluckiest competitors were getting rid of their merchandise at a loss\r\nof fifty per cent. He returned to Arcis with a fortune of three hundred\r\nthousand francs, half of which, invested on the Grand-Livre at sixty,\r\nreturned him an income of fifteen thousand francs a year. He employed\r\nthe remainder in building, furnishing, and adorning a handsome house on\r\nthe Place du Pont in Arcis.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the successful hosier, Monsieur Grevin was naturally\r\nhis confidant. The notary had an only daughter to marry, then twenty\r\nyears of age. Grevin, a widower, knew the fortune of Madame Beauvisage,\r\nthe mother, and he believed in the energy and capacity of a young man\r\nbold enough to have turned the campaign of 1814 to his profit. Severine\r\nGrevin had her mother’s fortune of sixty thousand francs for her dower.\r\nGrevin was then over fifty; he feared to die, and saw no chance of\r\nmarrying his daughter as he wished under the Restoration--for her, he\r\nhad had ambition. Under these circumstances he was shrewd enough to make\r\nPhileas ask her in marriage.\r\n\r\nSeverine Grevin, a well-trained young lady and handsome, was considered\r\nat that time the best match in Arcis. In fact, an alliance with the\r\nintimate friend of the senator Comte de Gondreville, peer of France, was\r\ncertainly a great honor for the son of a Gondreville tenant-farmer. The\r\nwidow Beauvisage, his mother, would have made any sacrifice to obtain\r\nit; but on learning the success of her son, she dispensed with the duty\r\nof giving him a _dot_,--a wise economy which was imitated by the notary.\r\n\r\nThus was consummated the union of the son of a farmer formerly so\r\nfaithful to the Simeuse family with the daughter of its most cruel\r\nenemy. It was, perhaps, the only application made of the famous saying\r\nof Louis XVIII.: “Union and Oblivion.”\r\n\r\nOn the second return of the Bourbons, Grevin’s father-in-law, old Doctor\r\nVarlet, died at the age of seventy-six, leaving two hundred thousand\r\nfrancs in gold in his cellar, besides other property valued at an\r\nequal sum. Thus Phileas and his wife had, outside of their business, an\r\nassured income of thirty thousand francs a year.\r\n\r\nThe first two years of this marriage sufficed to show Madame Severine\r\nand her father, Monsieur Grevin the absolute silliness of Phileas\r\nBeauvisage. His one gleam of commercial rapacity had seemed to the\r\nnotary the result of superior powers; the shrewd old man had mistaken\r\nyouth for strength, and luck for genius in business. Phileas certainly\r\nknew how to read and write and cipher well, but he had read nothing.\r\nOf crass ignorance, it was quite impossible to keep up even a slight\r\nconversation with him; he replied to all remarks with a deluge of\r\ncommonplaces pleasantly uttered. As the son of a farmer, however,\r\nPhileas was not without a certain commercial good sense, and he was\r\nalso kind and tender, and would often weep at a moving tale. It was\r\nthis native goodness of heart which made him respect his wife, whose\r\nsuperiority had always caused him the deepest admiration.\r\n\r\nSeverine, a woman of ideas, knew all things, so Phileas believed. And\r\nshe knew them the more correctly because she consulted her father on\r\nall subjects. She was gifted with great firmness, which made her the\r\nabsolute mistress in her own home. As soon as the latter result was\r\nattained, the old notary felt less regret in seeing that his daughter’s\r\nonly domestic happiness lay in the autocracy which usually satisfies all\r\nwomen of her nature. But what of the woman herself? Here follows what\r\nshe was said to have found in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE BEAUVISAGE FAMILY\r\n\r\nDuring the reaction of 1815, a Vicomte de Chargeboeuf (of the poorer\r\nbranch of the family) was sent to Arcis as sub-prefect through the\r\ninfluence of the Marquise de Cinq-Cygne, to whose family he was allied.\r\nThis young man remained sub-prefect for five years. The beautiful Madame\r\nBeauvisage was not, it was said, a stranger to the reasons that kept him\r\nin this office for a period far too prolonged for his own advancement.\r\nWe ought to say, however, that these remarks were not justified by any\r\nof the scandals which in the provinces betray those passions that are\r\ndifficult to conceal from the Argus-eyes of a little town. If Severine\r\nloved the Vicomte de Chargeboeuf and was beloved by him, it was in all\r\nhonor and propriety, said the friends of the Grevins and the Marions;\r\nand that double coterie imposed its opinion on the whole arrondissement;\r\nbut the Marions and the Grevins had no influence on the royalists, and\r\nthe royalists regarded the sub-prefect as fortunate in love.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Marquise de Cinq-Cygne heard what was said in the\r\nchateaux about her relation, she sent for him; and such was her horror\r\nfor all who were connected, near or far, with the actors in the judicial\r\ndrama so fatal to her family, that she strictly enjoined him to change\r\nhis residence. Not only that, but she obtained his appointment\r\nas sub-prefect of Sancerre with the promise of advancement to the\r\nprefecture.\r\n\r\nSome shrewd observers declared that the viscount pretended this passion\r\nfor the purpose of being made prefect; for he well knew the hatred\r\nfelt by the marquise for the name of Grevin. Others remarked on the\r\ncoincidence of the viscount’s apparitions in Paris with the visits made\r\nby Madame Beauvisage to the capital on frivolous pretexts. An impartial\r\nhistorian would be puzzled to form a just opinion on the facts of\r\nthis matter, which are buried in the mysteries of private life. One\r\ncircumstance alone seems to give color to the reports.\r\n\r\nCecile-Renee Beauvisage was born in 1820, just as Monsieur de\r\nChargeboeuf left Arcis, and among his various names was that of Rene.\r\nThis name was given by the Comte de Gondreville as godfather of the\r\nchild. Had the mother objected to the name, she would in some degree\r\nhave given color to the rumor. As gossip always endeavors to justify\r\nitself, the giving of this name was said to be a bit of maliciousness on\r\nthe part of the old count. Madame Keller, the count’s daughter, who was\r\nnamed Cecile, was the godmother. As for the resemblance shown in the\r\nperson of Cecile-Renee Beauvisage, it was striking. This young girl was\r\nlike neither father nor mother; in course of time she had become the\r\nliving image of the Vicomte de Chargeboeuf, whose aristocratic manners\r\nshe had also acquired. This double resemblance, both moral and physical,\r\nwas not observed by the inhabitants of Arcis, for the viscount never\r\nreturned to that town.\r\n\r\nSeverine made her husband happy in his own way. He liked good living and\r\neverything easy about him; she supplied him with the choicest wines, a\r\ntable worthy of a bishop, served by the best cook in the department but\r\nwithout the pretensions of luxury; for she kept her household strictly\r\nto the conditions of the burgher life of Arcis. It was a proverb in\r\nArcis that you must dine with Madame Beauvisage and spend your evening\r\nwith Madame Marion.\r\n\r\nThe renewed influence in the arrondissement of Arcis which the\r\nRestoration gave to the house of Cinq-Cygne had naturally drawn closer\r\nthe ties that bound together the various families affected by the\r\ncriminal trial relating to the abduction of Gondreville. [See “An\r\nHistorical Mystery.”] The Marions, Grevins, and Giguets were all the\r\nmore united because the triumph of their political opinions, called\r\n“constitutional,” now required the utmost harmony.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy Severine encouraged her husband to continue\r\nhis trade in hosiery, which any other man but himself would have long\r\nrenounced; and she sent him to Paris, and about the country, on business\r\nconnected with it. Up to the year 1830 Phileas, who was thus enabled\r\nto exercise his bump of “acquisitiveness,” earned every year a sum\r\nequivalent to his expenses. The interest on the property of Monsieur\r\nand Madame Beauvisage, being capitalized for the last fifteen years\r\nby Grevin’s intelligent care, became, by 1830, a round sum of half a\r\nmillion francs. That sum was, in fact, Cecile’s _dot_, which the old\r\nnotary then invested in the Three-per-cents at fifty, producing a safe\r\nincome of thirty thousand a year.\r\n\r\nAfter 1830 Beauvisage sold his business in hosiery to Jean Violette,\r\none of his agents (grandson of one of the chief witnesses for the\r\nprosecution in the Simeuse trial), the proceeds of which amounted to\r\nthree hundred thousand francs. Monsieur and Madame Beauvisage had also\r\nin prospect their double inheritance from old Grevin on one side, and\r\nthe old farmer’s wife Beauvisage on the other. Great provincial fortunes\r\nare usually the product of time multiplied by economy. Thirty years of\r\nold age make capital.\r\n\r\nIn giving to Cecile-Renee a _dot_ of fifty thousand francs a year,\r\nher parents still reserved for themselves the two inheritances, thirty\r\nthousand a year on the Grand Livre, and their house in Arcis.\r\n\r\nIf the Marquise de Cinq-Cygne were only dead, Cecile might assuredly\r\nmarry the young marquis; but the health of that great lady, who was\r\nstill vigorous and almost beautiful at sixty years of age, precluded all\r\nhope of such a marriage if it even entered the minds of Grevin and his\r\ndaughter, as some persons, surprised at their rejection of eligible\r\nsuitors like the sub-prefect and the _procureur-du-roi_, declared that\r\nit did.\r\n\r\nThe Beauvisage residence, one of the best in Arcis, stands on the Place\r\ndu Pont on a line with the rue Vide-Bourse, at the corner of the rue du\r\nPont, which leads to the Place de l’Eglise. Though, like many provincial\r\nhouses, without either court or garden, it produces a certain effect,\r\nin spite of its ornamentation in bad taste. The front door opens on\r\nthe Place; the windows of the ground-floor look out on the street-side\r\ntowards the post-house and inn, and command beyond the Place a rather\r\npicturesque view of the Aube, the navigation of which begins at the\r\nbridge. Beyond the bridge is another little Place or square, on which\r\nlives Monsieur Grevin, and from which the high-road to Sezanne starts.\r\n\r\nOn the street and on the square, the Beauvisage house, painted a\r\nspotless white, looks as though built of stone. The height of the\r\nwindows and their external mouldings contribute to give a certain\r\nstyle to the house which contrasts strongly with the generally forlorn\r\nappearance of the houses of Arcis, constructed, as we have already said,\r\nof wood, and covered with plaster, imitating the solidity of stone.\r\nStill, these houses are not without a certain originality, through the\r\nfact that each architect, or each burgher, has endeavored to solve for\r\nhimself the problem of styles of building.\r\n\r\nThe bridge at Arcis is of wood. About four hundred feet above the bridge\r\nthe river is crossed by another bridge, on which rise the tall wooden\r\nsides of a mill with several sluices. The space between the public\r\nbridge and this private bridge forms a basin, on the banks of which are\r\nseveral large houses. By an opening between the roofs can be seen the\r\nheight on which stands the chateau of Arcis with its park and gardens,\r\nits outer walls and trees which overhand the river above the bridges,\r\nand the rather scanty pastures of the left bank.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the water as it runs through the courses above the dam, the\r\nmusic of the wheels, from which the churned water falls back into the\r\nbasin in sparkling cascades, animate the rue du Pont, contrasting in\r\nthis respect with the tranquillity of the river flowing downward between\r\nthe garden of Monsieur Grevin, whose house is at one angle of the bridge\r\non the left bank, and the port where the boats and barges discharge\r\ntheir merchandise before a line of poor but picturesque houses.\r\n\r\nNothing can better express provincial life than the deep silence that\r\nenvelops the little town and reigns in its busiest region. It is easy\r\nto imagine, therefore, how disquieting the presence of a stranger, if\r\nhe only spends half a day there, may be to the inhabitants; with what\r\nattention faces protrude from the windows to observe him, and also the\r\ncondition of espial in which all the residents of the little place stand\r\nto each other. Life has there become so conventional that, except on\r\nSundays and fete-days, a stranger meets no one either on the boulevards\r\nor the Avenue of Sighs, not even, in fact, upon the streets.\r\n\r\nIt will now be readily understood why the ground-floor of the Beauvisage\r\nhouse is on a level with the street and square. The square serves as its\r\ncourtyard. Sitting at his window the eyes of the late hosier could take\r\nin the whole of the Place de l’Eglise, the two squares of the bridge,\r\nand the road to Sezanne. He could see the coaches arriving and the\r\ntravellers descending at the post-inn; and on court days he could watch\r\nthe proceedings around the offices of the mayor and the justice of\r\npeace. For these reasons, Beauvisage would not have exchanged his house\r\nfor the chateau, in spite of its lordly air, its stone walls, and its\r\nsplendid situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. IN WHICH THE DOT, ONE OF THE HEROINES OF THIS HISTORY, APPEARS\r\n\r\nEntering the Beauvisage house we find a versatile, at the farther end\r\nof which rises the staircase. To right we enter a large salon with\r\ntwo windows opening on the square; to left is a handsome dining-room,\r\nlooking on the street. The floor above is the one occupied by the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large fortune of the Beauvisage husband and wife,\r\ntheir establishment consisted of only a cook and a chamber-maid, the\r\nlatter a peasant, who washed and ironed and frotted the floors rather\r\nthan waited on her two mistresses, who were accustomed to spend their\r\ntime in dressing and waiting upon each other. Since the sale of the\r\nbusiness to Jean Violette, the horse and cabriolet used by Phileas, and\r\nkept at the Hotel de la Poste, had been relinquished and sold.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Phileas reached his house after the Giguet meeting,\r\nhis wife, already informed of the resolutions passed, had put on her\r\nboots and shawl and was preparing to go to her father; for she felt very\r\nsure that Madame Marion would, on that same evening, make her certain\r\novertures relating to Simon and Cecile. After telling his wife of\r\nCharles Keller’s death, Phileas asked her opinion with an artless “What\r\ndo you think of that, wife?” which fully pictured his habit of deferring\r\nto Severine’s opinion in all things. Then he sat down in an arm-chair\r\nand awaited her reply.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Madame Beauvisage, then forty-four years old, was so\r\nwell-preserved that she might, in that respect, rival Mademoiselle Mars.\r\nBy calling to mind the most charming Celimene that the Theatre-Francais\r\never had, an excellent idea of Severine Grevin’s appearance will be\r\nobtained. The same richness of coloring, the same beauty of features,\r\nthe same clearly defined outlines; but the hosier’s wife was short,--a\r\ncircumstance which deprived her of that noble grace, that charming\r\ncoquetry _a la_ Sevigne, through which the great actress commends\r\nherself to the memory of men who saw both the Empire and the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nProvincial life and the rather careless style of dress into which,\r\nfor the last ten years, Severine had allowed herself to fall, gave a\r\nsomewhat common air to that noble profile and those beautiful\r\nfeatures; increasing plumpness was destroying the outlines of a figure\r\nmagnificently fine during the first twelve years of her married life.\r\nBut Severine redeemed these growing imperfections with a sovereign,\r\nsuperb, imperious glance, and a certain haughty carriage of her head.\r\nHer hair, still black and thick and long, was raised high upon her head,\r\ngiving her a youthful look. Her shoulders and bosom were snowy, but they\r\nnow rose puffily in a manner to obstruct the free movement of the neck,\r\nwhich had grown too short. Her plump and dimpled arms ended in pretty\r\nlittle hands that were, alas, too fat. She was, in fact, so overdone\r\nwith fulness of life and health that her flesh formed a little pad,\r\nas one might call it, above her shoes. Two ear-drops, worth about\r\nthree-thousand francs each, adorned her ears. She wore a lace cap with\r\npink ribbons, a mousseline-de-laine gown in pink and gray stripes with\r\nan edging of green, opened at the bottom to show a petticoat trimmed\r\nwith valencienne lace; and a green cashmere shawl with palm-leaves, the\r\npoint of which reached the ground as she walked.\r\n\r\n“You are not so hungry,” she said, casting her eyes on Beauvisage,\r\n“that you can’t wait half an hour? My father has finished dinner and I\r\ncouldn’t eat mine in peace without knowing what he thinks and whether we\r\nought to go to Gondreville.”\r\n\r\n“Go, go, my dear. I’ll wait,” said Phileas, using the “thee” and “thou.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” cried Severine with a significant gesture of her\r\nshoulders. “Shall I never break you of that habit of tutoying me?”\r\n\r\n“I never do it before company--not since 1817,” said Phileas.\r\n\r\n“You do it constantly before the servants and your daughter.”\r\n\r\n“As you will, Severine,” replied Beauvisage sadly.\r\n\r\n“Above all, don’t say a word to Cecile about this resolution of the\r\nelectors,” added Madame Beauvisage, who was looking in the glass to\r\narrange her shawl.\r\n\r\n“Shall I go with you to your father’s?” asked Phileas.\r\n\r\n“No, stay with Cecile. Besides, Jean Violette was to pay the rest of the\r\npurchase-money to-day. He has twenty thousand francs to bring you. This\r\nis the third time he has put us off three months; don’t grant him any\r\nmore delays; if he can’t pay now, give his note to Courtet, the sheriff,\r\nand take the law of him. Achille Pigoult will tell you how to proceed.\r\nThat Violette is the worthy son of his grandfather; I think he is\r\ncapable of enriching himself by going into bankruptcy,--there’s neither\r\nlaw nor gospel in him.”\r\n\r\n“He is very intelligent,” said Beauvisage.\r\n\r\n“You have given him the good-will of a fine business for thirty thousand\r\nfrancs, which is certainly worth fifty thousand; and in ten years he has\r\nonly paid you ten thousand--”\r\n\r\n“I never sued anybody yet,” replied Beauvisage, “and I’d rather lose my\r\nmoney than torment a poor man--”\r\n\r\n“A man who laughs at you!”\r\n\r\nBeauvisage was silent; feeling unable to reply to that cruel remark, he\r\nlooked at the boards which formed the floor of the salon.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the progressive abolition of mind and will in Beauvisage will\r\nbe explained by the abuse of sleep. Going to bed every night at eight\r\no’clock and getting up the next morning at eight, he had slept his\r\ntwelve hours nightly for the last twenty years, never waking; or if that\r\nextraordinary event did occur, it was so serious a matter to his mind\r\nthat he talked of it all day. He spent an hour at his toilet, for his\r\nwife had trained him not to appear in her presence at breakfast unless\r\nproperly shaved, cleaned, and dressed for the day. When he was in\r\nbusiness, he departed to his office after breakfast and returned only\r\nin time for dinner. Since 1832, he had substituted for his business\r\noccupations a daily visit to his father-in-law, a promenade about the\r\ntown, or visits to his friends.\r\n\r\nIn all weather he wore boots, blue coat and trousers, and a white\r\nwaistcoat,--the style of dress exacted by his wife. His linen was\r\nremarkable for its fineness and purity, owing to the fact that Severine\r\nobliged him to change it daily. Such care for his person, seldom taken\r\nin the provinces, contributed to make him considered in Arcis very much\r\nas a man of elegance is considered in Paris. Externally this worthy\r\nseller of cotton hose seemed to be a personage; for his wife had sense\r\nenough never to utter a word which could put the public of Arcis on the\r\nscent of her disappointment and the utter nullity of her husband, who,\r\nthanks to his smiles, his handsome dress, and his manners, passed for a\r\nman of importance. People said that Severine was so jealous of him that\r\nshe prevented him from going out in the evening, while in point of fact\r\nPhileas was bathing the roses and lilies of his skin in happy slumber.\r\n\r\nBeauvisage, who lived according to his tastes, pampered by his wife,\r\nwell served by his two servants, cajoled by his daughter, called himself\r\nthe happiest man in Arcis, and really was so. The feeling of Severine\r\nfor this nullity of a man never went beyond the protecting pity of a\r\nmother for her child. She disguised the harshness of the words she was\r\nfrequently obliged to say to him by a joking manner. No household was\r\never more tranquil; and the aversion Phileas felt for society, where\r\nhe went to sleep, and where he could not play cards (being incapable of\r\nlearning a game), had made Severine sole mistress of her evenings.\r\n\r\nCecile’s entrance now put an end to her father’s embarrassment, and he\r\ncried out heartily:--\r\n\r\n“Hey! how fine we are!”\r\n\r\nMadame Beauvisage turned round abruptly and cast a look upon her\r\ndaughter which made the girl blush.\r\n\r\n“Cecile, who told you to dress yourself in that way?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Are we not going to-night to Madame Marion’s? I dressed myself now to\r\nsee if my new gown fitted me.”\r\n\r\n“Cecile! Cecile!” exclaimed Severine, “why do you try to deceive your\r\nmother? It is not right; and I am not pleased with you--you are hiding\r\nsomething from me.”\r\n\r\n“What has she done?” asked Beauvisage, delighted to see his daughter so\r\nprettily dressed.\r\n\r\n“What has she done? I shall tell her,” said Madame Beauvisage, shaking\r\nher finger at her only child.\r\n\r\nCecile flung herself on her mother’s neck, kissing and coaxing her,\r\nwhich is a means by which only daughters get their own way.\r\n\r\nCecile Beauvisage, a girl of nineteen, had put on a gown of gray silk\r\ntrimmed with gimp and tassels of a deeper shade of gray, making the\r\nfront of the gown look like a pelisse. The corsage, ornamented with\r\nbuttons and caps to the sleeves, ended in a point in front, and was\r\nlaced up behind like a corset. This species of corset defined the back,\r\nthe hips, and the bust perfectly. The skirt, trimmed with three rows of\r\nfringe, fell in charming folds, showing by its cut and its make the hand\r\nof a Parisian dressmaker. A pretty fichu edged with lace covered her\r\nshoulders; around her throat was a pink silk neckerchief, charmingly\r\ntied, and on her head was a straw hat ornamented with one moss rose. Her\r\nhands were covered with black silk mittens, and her feet were in bronze\r\nkid boots. This gala air, which gave her somewhat the appearance of the\r\npictures in a fashion-book, delighted her father.\r\n\r\nCecile was well made, of medium height, and perfectly well-proportioned.\r\nShe had braided her chestnut hair, according to the fashion of 1839, in\r\ntwo thick plaits which followed the line of the face and were fastened\r\nby their ends to the back of her head. Her face, a fine oval, and\r\nbeaming with health, was remarkable for an aristocratic air which she\r\ncertainly did not derive from either her father or her mother. Her eyes,\r\nof a light brown, were totally devoid of that gentle, calm, and almost\r\ntimid expression natural to the eyes of young girls. Lively, animated,\r\nand always well in health, Cecile spoiled, by a sort of bourgeois\r\nmatter-of-factness, and the manners of a petted child, all that\r\nher person presented of romantic charm. Still, a husband capable of\r\nreforming her education and effacing the traces of provincial life,\r\nmight still evolve from that living block a charming woman of the world.\r\n\r\nMadame Beauvisage had had the courage to bring up her daughter to good\r\nprinciples; she had made herself employ a false severity which enabled\r\nher to compel obedience and repress the little evil that existed in the\r\ngirl’s soul. Mother and daughter had never been parted; thus Cecile had,\r\nwhat is more rare in young girls than is generally supposed, a purity of\r\nthought, a freshness of heart, and a naivete of nature, real, complete,\r\nand flawless.\r\n\r\n“Your dress is enough to make me reflect,” said Madame Beauvisage. “Did\r\nSimon Giguet say anything to you yesterday that you are hiding from me?”\r\n\r\n“Dear mamma,” said Cecile in her mother’s ear, “he bores me; but there\r\nis no one else for me in Arcis.”\r\n\r\n“You judge him rightly; but wait till your grandfather has given an\r\nopinion,” said Madame Beauvisage, kissing her daughter, whose reply\r\nproved her good-sense, though it also revealed the breach made in her\r\ninnocence by the idea of marriage.\r\n\r\nSeverine was devoted to her father; she and her daughter allowed no one\r\nbut themselves to take charge of his linen; they knitted his socks for\r\nhim, and gave the most minute care to his comfort. Grevin knew that no\r\nthought of self-interest had entered their affection; the million they\r\nwould probably inherit could not dry their tears at his death; old men\r\nare very sensible to disinterested tenderness. Every morning before\r\ngoing to see him, Madame Beauvisage and Cecile attended to his dinner\r\nfor the next day, sending him the best that the market afforded.\r\n\r\nMadame Beauvisage had always desired that her father would present\r\nher at the Chateau de Gondreville and connect her with the count’s\r\ndaughters; but the wise old man explained, again and again, how\r\ndifficult it would be to have permanent relations with the Duchesse de\r\nCarigliano, who lived in Paris and seldom came to Gondreville, or with\r\nthe brilliant Madame Keller, after doing a business in hosiery.\r\n\r\n“Your life is lived,” he said to his daughter; “find all your enjoyments\r\nhenceforth in Cecile, who will certainly be rich enough to give you an\r\nexistence as broad and high as you deserve. Choose a son-in-law with\r\nambition and means, and you can follow her to Paris and leave that\r\njackass Beauvisage behind you. If I live long enough to see Cecile’s\r\nhusband I’ll pilot you all on the sea of political interests, as I\r\nonce piloted others, and you will reach a position equal to that of the\r\nKellers.”\r\n\r\nThese few words were said before the revolution of July, 1830. Grevin\r\ndesired to live that he might get under way the future grandeur of his\r\ndaughter, his grand-daughter, and his great-grandchildren. His ambition\r\nextended to the third generation.\r\n\r\nWhen he talked thus, the old man’s idea was to marry Cecile to Charles\r\nKeller; he was now grieving over that lost hope, uncertain where to look\r\nin the future. Having no relations with Parisian society, and seeing in\r\nthe department of the Aube no other husband for Cecile than the youthful\r\nMarquis de Cinq-Cygne, he was asking himself whether by the power of\r\ngold he could surmount the animosities which the revolution of July had\r\nroused between the royalists who were faithful to their principles, and\r\ntheir conquerors. The happiness of his grand-daughter seemed to him so\r\ndoubtful if he delivered her into the hands of the proud and haughty\r\nMarquise de Cinq-Cygne that he decided in his own mind to trust to the\r\nfriend of old age, Time. He hoped that his bitter enemy the marquise\r\nmight die, and, in that case, he thought he could win the son through\r\nhis grandfather, old d’Hauteserre, who was then living at Cinq-Cygne and\r\nwhom he knew to be accessible to the persuasions of money.\r\n\r\nIf this plan failed, and Cecile Beauvisage remained unmarried, he\r\nresolved as a last resort to consult his friend Gondreville, who\r\nwould, he believed, find his Cecile a husband, after his heart and his\r\nambition, among the dukes of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. A STRANGER\r\n\r\nSeverine found her father seated on a wooden bench at the end of his\r\nterrace, under a bower of lilacs then in bloom, and taking his coffee;\r\nfor it was half-past five in the afternoon. She saw, by the pain on\r\nher father’s face, that he had already heard the news. In fact, the old\r\ncount had sent a valet to his friend, begging him to come to him.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, old Grevin had endeavored not to encourage his\r\ndaughter’s ambition too far; but now, in the midst of the contradictory\r\nreflections which the melancholy death of Charles Keller caused him, his\r\nsecret escaped his lips.\r\n\r\n“My dear child,” he said to her, “I had formed the finest plans for your\r\nfuture. Cecile was to have been Vicomtesse Keller, for Charles, by my\r\ninfluence, would now have been selected deputy. Neither Gondreville nor\r\nhis daughter Madame Keller would have refused Cecile’s _dot_ of sixty\r\nthousand francs a year, especially with the prospect of a hundred\r\nthousand more which she will some day have from you. You would have\r\nlived in Paris with your daughter, and played your part of mother-in-law\r\nin the upper regions of power.”\r\n\r\nMadame Beauvisage made a sign of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“But we are knocked down by the death of this charming young man, to\r\nwhom the prince royal had already given his friendship. Now this Simon\r\nGiguet, who has thrust himself upon the scene, is a fool, and the worst\r\nof all fools, for he thinks himself an eagle. You are, however, too\r\nintimate with the Giguets and the Marion household not to put the utmost\r\npoliteness into your refusal--but you must refuse him.”\r\n\r\n“As usual, you and I are of the same opinion, father.”\r\n\r\n“You can say that I have otherwise disposed of Cecile’s hand, and\r\nthat will cut short all preposterous pretensions like that of Antonin\r\nGoulard. Little Vinet may offer himself, and he is preferable to the\r\nothers who are smelling after the _dot_; he has talent, and shrewdness,\r\nand he belongs to the Chargeboeufs by his mother; but he has too much\r\ncharacter not to rule his wife, and he is young enough to make himself\r\nloved. You would perish between two sentiments--for I know you by heart,\r\nmy child.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be much embarrassed this evening at the Marions’ to know what\r\nto say,” remarked Severine.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my dear,” said her father, “send Madame Marion to me; I’ll\r\ntalk to her.”\r\n\r\n“I knew, father, that you were thinking of our future, but I had no idea\r\nyou expected it to be so brilliant,” said Madame Beauvisage, taking the\r\nhands of the old man and kissing them.\r\n\r\n“I have pondered the matter so deeply,” said Grevin, “that in 1831 I\r\nbought the Beauseant mansion in Paris, which you have probably seen.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Beauvisage made a movement of surprise on hearing this secret,\r\nuntil then so carefully kept, but she did not interrupt her father.\r\n\r\n“It will be my wedding present,” he went on. “In 1832 I let it for seven\r\nyears to an Englishman for twenty-four thousand francs a year,--a pretty\r\nstroke of business; for it only cost me three hundred and twenty-five\r\nthousand francs, of which I thus recover nearly two hundred thousand.\r\nThe lease ends in July of this year.”\r\n\r\nSeverine kissed her father on the forehead and on both cheeks. This last\r\nrevelation so magnified her future that she was well-nigh dazzled.\r\n\r\n“I shall advise my father,” she said to herself, as she recrossed\r\nthe bridge, “to give only the reversion of that property to his\r\ngrandchildren, and let me have the life-interest in it. I have no idea\r\nof letting my daughter and son-in-law turn me out of doors; they must\r\nlive with me.”\r\n\r\nAt dessert, when the two women-servants were safely at their own\r\ndinner in the kitchen, and Madame Beauvisage was certain of not being\r\noverheard, she thought it advisable to give Cecile a little lecture.\r\n\r\n“My daughter,” she said, “behave this evening with propriety, like a\r\nwell-bred girl; and from this day forth be more sedate. Do not chatter\r\nheedlessly, and never walk alone with Monsieur Giguet, or Monsieur\r\nOlivier Vinet, or the sub-prefect, or Monsieur Martener,--in fact, with\r\nany one, not even Achille Pigoult. You will not marry any of the young\r\nmen of Arcis, or of the department. Your fate is to shine in Paris.\r\nTherefore I shall now give you charming dresses, to accustom you to\r\nelegance. We can easily find out where the Princesse de Cadignan and the\r\nMarquise de Cinq-Cygne get their things. I mean that you shall cease to\r\nlook provincial. You must practise the piano for three hours every day.\r\nI shall send for Monsieur Moise from Troyes until I know what master\r\nI ought to get from Paris. Your talents must all be developed, for you\r\nhave only one year more of girlhood before you. Now I have warned you,\r\nand I shall see how you behave this evening. You must manage to keep\r\nSimon at a distance, but without coquetting with him.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy, mamma; I intend to adore the _stranger_.”\r\n\r\nThese words, which made Madame Beauvisage laugh, need some explanation.\r\n\r\n“Ha! I haven’t seen him yet,” said Phileas, “but everybody is talking\r\nabout him. When I want to know who he is, I shall send the corporal or\r\nMonsieur Groslier to ask him for his passport.”\r\n\r\nThere is no little town in France where, at a given time, the drama or\r\nthe comedy of the _stranger_ is not played. Often the stranger is an\r\nadventurer who makes dupes and departs, carrying with him the reputation\r\nof a woman, or the money of a family. Oftener the stranger is a real\r\nstranger, whose life remains mysterious long enough for the town to busy\r\nitself curiously about his words and deeds.\r\n\r\nNow the probable accession to power of Simon Giguet was not the only\r\nserious event that was happening in Arcis. For the last two days the\r\nattention of the little town had been focussed on a personage just\r\narrived, who proved to be the first Unknown of the present generation.\r\nThe _stranger_ was at this moment the subject of conversation in every\r\nhousehold in the place. He was the beam fallen from heaven into the city\r\nof the frogs.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Arcis-sur-Aube explains the effect which the arrival of\r\na stranger was certain to produce. About eighteen miles from Troyes, on\r\nthe high-road to Paris, opposite to a farm called “La Belle Etoile,”\r\n a county road branches off from the main road, and leads to Arcis,\r\ncrossing the vast plains where the Seine cuts a narrow green valley\r\nbordered with poplars, which stand out upon the whiteness of the chalk\r\nsoil of Champagne. The main road from Arcis to Troyes is eighteen miles\r\nin length, and makes the arch of a bow, the extremities of which are\r\nTroyes and Arcis, so that the shortest route from Paris to Arcis is by\r\nthe county road which turns off, as we have said, near the Belle Etoile.\r\nThe Aube is navigable only from Arcis to its mouth. Therefore this town,\r\nstanding eighteen miles from a high-road, and separated from Troyes by\r\nmonotonous plains, is isolated more or less, and has but little commerce\r\nor transportation either by land or water. Arcis is, in fact, a town\r\ncompletely isolated, where no travellers pass, and is attached to Troyes\r\nand La Belle Etoile by stage-coaches only. All the inhabitants know each\r\nother; they even know the commercial travellers who come, now and then,\r\non business from the large Parisian houses. Thus, as in all provincial\r\ntowns in a like position, a stranger, if he stayed two days, would wag\r\nthe tongues and excite the imaginations of the whole community without\r\nhis name or his business being known.\r\n\r\nNow, Arcis being still in a state of tranquillity three days before\r\nthe morning when, by the will of the creator of so many histories,\r\nthe present tale begins, there was seen to arrive by the county road\r\na stranger, driving a handsome tilbury drawn by a valuable horse,\r\nand accompanied by a tiny groom, no bigger than my fist, mounted on a\r\nsaddle-horse. The coach, connecting with the diligences to Troyes, had\r\nbrought from La Belle Etoile three trunks coming from Paris, marked with\r\nno name, but belonging to this stranger, who took up his quarters at the\r\nMulet inn. Every one in Arcis supposed, on the first evening, that this\r\npersonage had come with the intention of buying the estate of Arcis; and\r\nmuch was said in all households about the future owner of the chateau.\r\nThe tilbury, the traveller, his horses, his servant, one and all\r\nappeared to belong to a man who had dropped upon Arcis from the highest\r\nsocial sphere.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, no doubt fatigued, did not show himself for a time;\r\nperhaps he spent part of the day in arranging himself in the rooms\r\nhe had chosen, announcing his intention of staying a certain time. He\r\nrequested to see the stable where his horses were to be kept, showed\r\nhimself very exacting, and insisted that they should be placed in stalls\r\napart from those of the innkeeper’s horses, and from those of guests who\r\nmight come later. In consequence of such singular demands, the landlord\r\nof the hotel du Mulet considered his guest to be an Englishman.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the first day several attempts were made at the Mulet\r\nby inquisitive persons to satisfy their curiosity; but no light whatever\r\ncould be obtained from the little groom, who evaded all inquiries, not\r\nby refusals or by silence, but by sarcasms which seemed to be beyond his\r\nyears and to prove him a corrupt little mortal.\r\n\r\nAfter making a careful toilet and dining at six o’clock, the stranger\r\nmounted a horse, and, followed by his groom, rode off along the road to\r\nBrienne, not returning till a very late hour to the Mulet. The landlord,\r\nhis wife, and her maids had meantime gained no information from a\r\ncareful examination of his trunks, and the articles about his rooms, as\r\nto the projects or the condition of their mysterious inmate.\r\n\r\nOn the stranger’s return the mistress of the house carried up to him\r\nthe book in which, according to police regulations, he was required to\r\ninscribe his name, rank, the object of his journey, and the place from\r\nwhich he came.\r\n\r\n“I shall write nothing,” he said to the mistress of the inn. “If any one\r\nquestions you, you can say I refused; and you may send the sub-prefect\r\nto see me, for I have no passport. I dare say that many persons will\r\nmake inquiries about me, madame, and you can tell them just what you\r\nlike. I wish you to know nothing about me. If you worry me on this\r\npoint, I shall go to the Hotel de la Poste on the Place du Pont and\r\nremain there for the fortnight I propose to spend here. I should be\r\nsorry for that, because I know that you are the sister of Gothard, one\r\nof the heroes of the Simeuse affair.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, monsieur,” said the sister of the steward of Cinq-Cygne.\r\n\r\nAfter such a beginning, the stranger kept the mistress of the house a\r\nwhole hour and made her tell him all she knew of Arcis, of its fortunes,\r\nits interests, and its functionaries. The next day he disappeared on\r\nhorseback, followed by his tiger, returning at midnight.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand Mademoiselle Cecile’s little joke, which Madame\r\nBeauvisage thought to be without foundation. Beauvisage and Cecile,\r\nsurprised by the order of the day promulgated by Severine, were\r\nenchanted. While his wife went to dress for Madame Marion’s reception,\r\nthe father listened to the many conjectures it was natural a girl should\r\nmake in such a case. Then, fatigued with his day, he went to bed as soon\r\nas his wife and daughter had departed.\r\n\r\nAs may readily be supposed by those who know anything of country towns,\r\na crowd of persons flocked to Madame Marion’s that evening. The triumph\r\nof Giguet junior was thought to be a victory won against the Comte de\r\nGondreville, and to insure forever the independence of Arcis in the\r\nmatter of elections. The news of the death of poor Charles Keller was\r\nregarded as a judgment from heaven, intended to silence all rivalries.\r\n\r\nAntonin Goulard, Frederic Marest, Olivier Vinet, and Monsieur Martener,\r\nthe authorities who, until then, had frequented this salon (the\r\nprevailing opinions of which did not seem to them contrary to the\r\ngovernment created by the popular will in July, 1830), came as usual,\r\npossessed by curiosity to see what attitude the Beauvisage family would\r\ntake under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe salon, restored to its usual condition, showed no signs of the\r\nmeeting which appeared to have settled the destiny of Simon Giguet. By\r\neight o’clock four card-tables, each with four players, were under way.\r\nThe smaller salon and the dining-room were full of people. Never, except\r\non grand occasions, such as balls and fete-days, had Madame Marion seen\r\nsuch an influx at the door of her salon, forming as it were the tail of\r\na comet.\r\n\r\n“It is the dawn of power,” said Olivier Vinet to the mistress of the\r\nhouse, showing her this spectacle, so gratifying to the heart of a\r\nperson who delighted in receiving company.\r\n\r\n“No one knows what there is in Simon,” replied the mother. “We live in\r\ntimes when young men who persevere and are moral and upright can aspire\r\nto everything.”\r\n\r\nThis answer was made, not so much to Vinet as to Madame Beauvisage, who\r\nhad entered the room with her daughter and was now beginning to offer\r\nher congratulations on the event. In order to escape indirect appeals\r\nand pointed interpretations of careless words, Madame Beauvisage took a\r\nvacant place at a whist-table and devoted her mind to the winning of one\r\nhundred fishes. One hundred fishes, or counters, made fifty sous! When a\r\nplayer had lost that sum it was talked of in Arcis for a couple of days.\r\n\r\nCecile went to talk with Mademoiselle Mollot, one of her good friends,\r\nappearing to be seized with redoubled affection for her. Mademoiselle\r\nMollot was the beauty of Arcis, just as Cecile was the heiress. Monsieur\r\nMollot, clerk of the court, lived on the Grande-Place in a house\r\nconstructed in the same manner as that of Beauvisage on the Place du\r\nPont. Madame Mollot, forever seated at the window of her salon on the\r\nground-floor, was attacked (as the result of that situation) by intense,\r\nacute, insatiable curiosity, now become a chronic and inveterate\r\ndisease. The moment a peasant entered the square from the road to\r\nBrienne she saw him, and watched to see what business could have brought\r\nhim to Arcis; she had no peace of mind until that peasant was explained.\r\nShe spent her life in judging the events, men, things, and households of\r\nArcis.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the house of Mollot, father, mother, and daughter, was\r\nto marry Ernestine (an only daughter) to Antonin Goulard. Consequently\r\nthe refusal of the Beauvisage parents to entertain the proposals of\r\nthe sub-prefect had tightened the bonds of friendship between the two\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n“There’s an impatient man!” said Ernestine to Cecile, indicating Simon\r\nGiguet. “He wants to come and talk with us; but every one who comes in\r\nfeels bound to congratulate him. I’ve heard him say fifty times already:\r\n‘It is, I think, less to me than to my father that this compliment of\r\nmy fellow-citizens has been paid; but, in any case, pray believe that\r\nI shall be devoted not only to our general interests but to yours\r\nindividually.’ I can guess those words by the motion of his lips, and\r\nall the while he is looking at you with an air of martyrdom.”\r\n\r\n“Ernestine,” replied Cecile, “don’t leave me the whole evening; I\r\ndon’t want to listen to his proposals made under cover of ‘alases!’ and\r\nmingled with sighs.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you want to be the wife of a Keeper of the Seals?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that’s all nonsense,” said Cecile, laughing.\r\n\r\n“But I assure you,” persisted Ernestine, “that just before you came\r\nin Monsieur Godivet, the registrar, was declaring with enthusiasm that\r\nSimon would be Keeper of the Seals in three years.”\r\n\r\n“Do they count on the influence of the Comte de Gondreville?” asked\r\nthe sub-prefect, coming up to the two girls and guessing that they were\r\nmaking fun of his friend Giguet.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Monsieur Antonin,” said the handsome Ernestine, “you who promised\r\nmy mother to find out all about the _stranger_, what have you heard\r\nabout him?”\r\n\r\n“The events of to-day, Mademoiselle, are so much more important,” said\r\nAntonin, taking a seat beside Cecile, like a diplomat delighted to\r\nescape general attention by conversing with two girls. “All my career as\r\nsub-prefect or prefect is at stake.”\r\n\r\n“What! I thought you allowed your friend Simon to be nominated\r\nunanimously.”\r\n\r\n“Simon is my friend, but the government is my master, and I expect to\r\ndo my best to prevent Simon from being elected. And here comes Madame\r\nMollot, who owes me her concurrence as the wife of a man whose functions\r\nattach him to the government.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure we ask nothing better than to be on your side,” replied the\r\nsheriff’s wife. “Mollot has told me,” she continued in a low voice,\r\n“what took place here to-day--it is pitiable! Only one man showed\r\ntalent, and that was Achille Pigoult. Everybody agrees that he would\r\nmake a fine orator in the Chamber; and therefore, though he has nothing,\r\nand my daughter has a _dot_ of sixty thousand francs, not to speak of\r\nwhat, as an only child, she will inherit from us and also from her uncle\r\nat Mollot and from my aunt Lambert at Troyes,--well, I declare to you\r\nthat if Monsieur Achille Pigoult did us the honor to ask her to wife,\r\nI should give her to him; yes, I should--provided always she liked\r\nhim. But the silly little goose wants to marry as she pleases; it is\r\nMademoiselle Beauvisage who puts such notions into her head.”\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect received this double broadside like a man who knows he\r\nhas thirty thousand francs a year, and expects a prefecture.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle is right,” he said, looking at Cecile; “she is rich enough\r\nto make a marriage of love.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us talk about marriage,” said Ernestine; “it saddens my\r\npoor dear Cecile, who was owning to me just now that in order not to be\r\nmarried for her money, but for herself, she should like an affair with\r\nsome stranger who knew nothing of Arcis and her future expectations as\r\nLady Croesus, and would spin her a romance to end in true love and a\r\nmarriage.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a very pretty idea!” cried Olivier Vinet, joining the group of\r\nyoung ladies in order to get away from the partisans of Simon, the\r\nidol of the day. “I always knew that Mademoiselle had as much sense as\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“And,” continued Ernestine, “she has selected for the hero of her\r\nromance--”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” interrupted Madame Mollot, “an old man of fifty!--fie!”\r\n\r\n“How do you know he is fifty?” asked Olivier Vinet, laughing.\r\n\r\n“How?” replied Madame Mollot. “Why, this morning I was so puzzled that I\r\ngot out my opera-glass--”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” cried the superintendent of _ponts et chaussees_, who was\r\npaying court to the mother to obtain the daughter.\r\n\r\n“And so,” continued Madame Mollot, “I was able to see him shaving; with\r\nsuch elegant razors!--mounted in gold, or silver-gilt!”\r\n\r\n“Gold! gold, of course!” said Vinet. “When things are unknown they\r\nshould always be imagined of the finest quality. Consequently I, not\r\nhaving seen this gentleman, am perfectly sure that he is at least a\r\ncount.”\r\n\r\nThis speech created a laugh; and the laughing group excited the jealousy\r\nof a group of dowagers and the attention of a troop of men in black who\r\nsurrounded Simon Giguet. As for the latter, he was chafing in despair at\r\nnot being able to lay his fortune and his future at the feet of the rich\r\nCecile.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Vinet, “a man distinguished for his birth, for\r\nhis manners, his fortune, his equipages,--a lion, a dandy, a\r\nyellow-kid-glover!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Olivier,” said Ernestine, “he drives the prettiest tilbury you\r\never saw.”\r\n\r\n“What? Antonin, you never told me he had a tilbury when we were\r\ntalking about that conspirator this morning. A tilbury! Why, that’s an\r\nextenuating circumstance; he can’t be a republican.”\r\n\r\n“Mesdemoiselles, there is nothing that I will not do in the interests\r\nof your amusement,” said Antonin Goulard. “I will instantly proceed\r\nto ascertain if this individual is a count, and if he is, what kind of\r\ncount.”\r\n\r\n“You can make a report upon him,” said the superintendent of bridges.\r\n\r\n“For the use of all future sub-prefects,” added Olivier Vinet.\r\n\r\n“How can you do it?” asked Madame Mollot.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied the sub-prefect, “ask Mademoiselle Beauvisage whom she\r\nwould accept as her husband among all of us here present; she will not\r\nanswer. Allow me the same discretion. Mesdemoiselles, restrain your\r\nanxiety; in ten minutes you shall know whether the Unknown is a count or\r\na commercial traveller.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE REVELATIONS OF AN OPERA-GLASS\r\n\r\nAntonin Goulard left the little group of young ladies, in which,\r\nbesides Cecile and Ernestine, were Mademoiselle Berton, daughter of the\r\ntax-collector,--an insignificant young person who played the part of\r\nsatellite to Cecile,--and Mademoiselle Herbelot, sister of the second\r\nnotary of Arcis, an old maid of thirty, soured, affected, and dressed\r\nlike all old maids; for she wore, over a bombazine gown, an embroidered\r\nfichu, the corners of which, gathered to the front of the bodice, were\r\nknotted together after the well-known fashion under the Terror.\r\n\r\n“Julien,” said the sub-prefect to his valet, who was waiting in the\r\nantechamber, “you who served six years at Gondreville ought to know how\r\na count’s coronet is made.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur; it has pearls on its nine points.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. Go to the Mulet, and try to clap your eye on the tilbury of\r\nthe gentleman who is stopping there, and then come and tell me what is\r\npainted on it. Do your business thoroughly, and bring me all the gossip\r\nof the inn. If you see the little groom, ask him at what hour to-morrow\r\nhis master can receive the sub-prefect--in case you find the nine\r\npearls. Don’t drink, don’t gossip yourself, and come back quickly; and\r\nas soon as you get back let me know it by coming to the door of the\r\nsalon.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\nThe Mulet inn, as we have already said, stands on the square, at the\r\nopposite corner to the garden wall of the Marion estate on the other\r\nside of the road leading to Brienne. Therefore the solution of the\r\nproblem could be rapid. Antonin Goulard returned to his place by Cecile\r\nto await results.\r\n\r\n“We talked so much about the stranger yesterday that I dreamed of him\r\nall night,” said Madame Mollot.\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! do you still dream of unknown heroes, fair lady?” said Vinet.\r\n\r\n“You are very impertinent; if I chose I could make you dream of me,” she\r\nretorted. “So this morning when I rose--”\r\n\r\nIt may not be useless to say that Madame Mollot was considered a clever\r\nwoman in Arcis; that is, she expressed herself fluently and abused that\r\nadvantage. A Parisian, wandering by chance into these regions, like the\r\nUnknown, would have thought her excessively garrulous.\r\n\r\n“--I was, naturally, making my toilet, and as I looked mechanically\r\nabout me--”\r\n\r\n“Through the window?” asked Antonin.\r\n\r\n“Certainly; my dressing-room opens on the street. Now you know, of\r\ncourse, that Poupart has put the stranger into one of the rooms exactly\r\nopposite to mine--”\r\n\r\n“One room, mamma!” interrupted Ernestine. “The count occupies three\r\nrooms! The little groom, dressed all in black, is in the first. They\r\nhave made a salon of the next, and the Unknown sleeps in the third.”\r\n\r\n“Then he has half the rooms in the inn,” remarked Mademoiselle Herbelot.\r\n\r\n“Well, young ladies, and what has that to do with his person?” said\r\nMadame Mollot, sharply, not pleased at the interruption. “I am talking\r\nof the man himself--”\r\n\r\n“Don’t interrupt the orator,” put in Vinet.\r\n\r\n“As I was stooping--”\r\n\r\n“Seated?” asked Antonin.\r\n\r\n“Madame was of course as she naturally would be,--making her toilet and\r\nlooking at the Mulet,” said Vinet.\r\n\r\nIn the provinces such jokes are prized, for people have so long said\r\neverything to each other that they have recourse at last to the sort\r\nof nonsense our fathers indulged in before the introduction of English\r\nhypocrisy,--one of those products against which custom-houses are\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\n“Don’t interrupt the orator,” repeated Cecile Beauvisage to Vinet, with\r\nwhom she exchanged a smile.\r\n\r\n“My eyes involuntarily fell on the window of the room in which the\r\nstranger had slept the night before. I don’t know what time he went to\r\nbed, although I was awake till past midnight; but I have the misfortune\r\nto be married to a man who snores fit to crack the planks and the\r\nrafters. If I fall asleep first, oh! I sleep so sound nothing can wake\r\nme; but if Mollot drops off first my night is ruined--”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you ever go off together?” said Achille Pigoult, joining the\r\ngroup. “I see you are talking of sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, naughty boy!” replied Madame Mollot, graciously.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what they mean?” whispered Cecile to Ernestine.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, he was not in at one o’clock in the morning,” continued\r\nMadame Mollot.\r\n\r\n“Then he defrauded you!--came home without your knowing it!” said\r\nAchille Pigoult. “Ha! that man is sly indeed; he’ll put us all in his\r\npouch and sell us in the market-place.”\r\n\r\n“To whom?” asked Vinet.\r\n\r\n“Oh! to a project! to an idea! to a system!” replied the notary, to whom\r\nOlivier smiled with a knowing air.\r\n\r\n“Imagine my surprise,” continued Madame Mollot, “when I saw a stuff, a\r\nmaterial, of splendid magnificence, most beautiful! dazzling! I said to\r\nmyself, ‘That must be a dressing-gown of the spun-glass material I have\r\nsometimes seen in exhibitions of industrial products.’ So I fetched my\r\nopera-glass to examine it. But, good gracious! what do you think I saw?\r\nAbove the dressing-gown, where the head ought to have been, I saw an\r\nenormous mass, something like a knee--I can’t tell you how my curiosity\r\nwas excited.”\r\n\r\n“I can conceive it,” said Antonin.\r\n\r\n“No, you can _not_ conceive it,” said Madame Mollot; “for this knee--”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I understand,” cried Olivier Vinet, laughing; “the Unknown was also\r\nmaking his toilet, and you saw his two knees.”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” cried Madame Mollot; “you are putting incongruities into my\r\nmouth. The stranger was standing up; he held a sponge in his hand above\r\nan immense basin, and--none of your jokes, Monsieur Olivier!--it wasn’t\r\nhis knee, it was his head! He was washing his bald head; he hasn’t a\r\nspear of hair upon it.”\r\n\r\n“Impudent man!” said Antonin. “He certainly can’t have come with ideas\r\nof marriage in that head. Here we must have hair in order to be married.\r\nThat’s essential.”\r\n\r\n“I am therefore right in saying that our Unknown visitor must be fifty\r\nyears old. Nobody ever takes to a wig before that time of life. After a\r\ntime, when his toilet was finished, he opened his window and looked out;\r\nand _then_ he wore a splendid head of black hair. He turned his eyeglass\r\nfull on me,--for by that time, I was in my balcony. Therefore, my dear\r\nCecile, you see for yourself that you can’t take that man for the hero\r\nof your romance.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Men of fifty are not to be despised, if they are counts,” said\r\nErnestine.\r\n\r\n“Heavens! what has age to do with it?” said Mademoiselle Herbelot.\r\n\r\n“Provided one gets a husband,” added Vinet, whose cold maliciousness\r\nmade him feared.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the old maid, feeling the cut, “I should prefer a man of\r\nfifty, indulgent, kind, and considerate, to a young man without a heart,\r\nwhose wit would bite every one, even his wife.”\r\n\r\n“This is all very well for conversation,” retorted Vinet, “but in order\r\nto love the man of fifty and reject the other, it is necessary to have\r\nthe opportunity to choose.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Madame Mollot, in order to stop this passage at arms between\r\nthe old maid and Vinet, who always went to far, “when a woman has\r\nhad experience of life she knows that a husband of fifty or one of\r\ntwenty-five is absolutely the same thing if she merely respects him. The\r\nimportant things in marriage are the benefits to be derived from it. If\r\nMademoiselle Beauvisage wants to go to Paris and shine there--and in\r\nher place I should certainly feel so--she ought not to take a husband\r\nin Arcis. If I had the fortune she will have, I should give my hand to\r\na count, to a man who would put me in a high social position, and I\r\nshouldn’t ask to see the certificate of his birth.”\r\n\r\n“It would satisfy you to see his toilet,” whispered Vinet in her ear.\r\n\r\n“But the king makes counts,” said Madame Marion, who had now joined the\r\ngroup and was surveying the bevy of young ladies.\r\n\r\n“Ah! madame,” remarked Vinet, “but some young girls prefer their counts\r\nalready made.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur Antonin,” said Cecile, laughing at Vinet’s sarcasm.\r\n“Your ten minutes have expired, and you haven’t told us whether the\r\nUnknown is a count or not.”\r\n\r\n“I shall keep my promise,” replied the sub-prefect, perceiving at that\r\nmoment the head of his valet in the doorway; and again he left his place\r\nbeside Cecile.\r\n\r\n“You are talking of the stranger,” said Madame Marion. “Is anything\r\nreally known about him?”\r\n\r\n“No, madame,” replied Achille Pigoult; “but he is, without knowing it,\r\nlike the clown of a circus, the centre of the eyes of the two thousand\r\ninhabitants of this town. I know one thing about him,” added the little\r\nnotary.\r\n\r\n“Oh, tell us, Monsieur Achille!” cried Ernestine, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“His tiger’s name is Paradise!”\r\n\r\n“Paradise!” echoed every one included in the little circle.\r\n\r\n“Can a man be called Paradise?” asked Madame Herbelot, who had joined\r\nher sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n“It tends to prove,” continued the notary, “that the master is an angel;\r\nfor when his tiger follows him--you understand.”\r\n\r\n“It is the road of Paradise! very good, that,” said Madame Marion,\r\nanxious to flatter Achille Pigoult in the interests of her nephew.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Antonin’s valet in the dining-room, “the tilbury has a\r\ncoat of arms--”\r\n\r\n“Coat of arms!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and droll enough they are! There’s a coronet with nine points and\r\npearls--”\r\n\r\n“Then he’s a count!”\r\n\r\n“And a monster with wings, flying like a postilion who has dropped\r\nsomething. And here is what is written on the belt,” added the man,\r\ntaking a paper from his pocket. “Mademoiselle Anicette, the Princesse de\r\nCadignan’s lady’s maid, who came in a carriage” (the Cinq-Cygne carriage\r\nbefore the door of the Mulet!) “to bring a letter to the gentleman,\r\nwrote it down for me.”\r\n\r\n“Give it to me.”\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect read the words: _Quo me trahit fortuna_.\r\n\r\nThough he was not strong enough in French blazon to know the house that\r\nbore that device, Antonin felt sure that the Cinq-Cygnes would not\r\nsend their chariot, nor the Princess de Cadignan a missive by her maid,\r\nexcept to a person of the highest nobility.\r\n\r\n“Ha! so you know the maid of the Princess de Cadignan! happy man!” said\r\nAntonin.\r\n\r\nJulien, a young countryman, after serving six months in the household\r\nof the Comte de Gondreville, had entered the service of the sub-prefect,\r\nwho wanted a servant of the _right style_.\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, Anicette is my father’s god-daughter. Papa, who wanted\r\nto do well by the girl, whose father was dead, sent her to a dressmaker\r\nin Paris because my mother could not endure her.”\r\n\r\n“Is she pretty?”\r\n\r\n“Rather; the proof is that she got into trouble in Paris; but finally,\r\nas she has talent and can make gowns and dress hair, she got a place\r\nwith the princess.”\r\n\r\n“What did she tell you about Cinq-Cygne? Is there much company?”\r\n\r\n“A great deal, monsieur. There’s the princess and Monsieur d’Arthez, the\r\nDuc de Maufrigneuse and the duchess and the young marquis. In fact the\r\nchateau is full. They expect Monseigneur the Bishop of Troyes to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Troubert! I should like to know how long he is going to stay.”\r\n\r\n“Anicette thinks for some time; and she believes he is coming to meet\r\nthe gentleman who is now at the Mulet. They expect more company. The\r\ncoachman told me they were talking a great deal about the election.\r\nMonsieur le president Michu is expected in a few days.”\r\n\r\n“Try to bring that lady’s maid into town on pretence of shopping. Have\r\nyou any designs upon her?”\r\n\r\n“If she has any savings I don’t know but what I might. She is a sly one,\r\nthough.”\r\n\r\n“Tell her to come and see you at the sub-prefecture.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur. I’ll go and tell her now.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say anything about me, or she might not come.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur; haven’t I served at Gondreville?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know why they sent that message from Cinq-Cygne at this hour,\r\ndo you? It is half-past nine o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“It must have been something pressing. The gentleman had only just\r\nreturned from Gondreville.”\r\n\r\n“Gondreville!--has he been to Gondreville?”\r\n\r\n“He dined there, monsieur. If you went to the Mulet you’d laugh! The\r\nlittle tiger is, saving your presence, as drunk as a fiddler. He drank\r\nsuch a lot of champagne in the servants’ hall that he can’t stand on his\r\nlegs; they have been filling him for fun.”\r\n\r\n“And the count?”\r\n\r\n“The count had gone to bed; but as soon as he received the letter he got\r\nup. He is now dressing himself; and they are putting the horse in the\r\ntilbury. The count is to spend the night at Cinq-Cygne.”\r\n\r\n“He must be some great personage.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, monsieur; for Gothard, the steward of Cinq-Cygne, came this\r\nmorning to see his brother-in-law Poupart, and warned him to be very\r\ndiscreet about the gentleman and to serve him like a king.”\r\n\r\n“Vinet must be right,” thought the sub-prefect. “Can there be some cabal\r\non foot?”\r\n\r\n“It was Duc Georges de Maufrigneuse who sent Gothard to the Mulet.\r\nPoupart came to the meeting here this morning only because the gentleman\r\nwished him to do so; if he had sent him to Paris, he’d go. Gothard told\r\nPoupart to keep silent about the gentleman, and to fool all inquisitive\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n“If you can get Anicette here, don’t fail to let me know,” said Antonin.\r\n\r\n“But I could see her at Cinq-Cygne if monsieur would send me to his\r\nhouse at Val-Preux.”\r\n\r\n“That’s an idea. You might profit by the chariot to get there. But what\r\nreason could you give to the little groom?”\r\n\r\n“He’s a madcap, that boy, monsieur. Would you believe it, drunk as he\r\nis, he has just mounted his master’s thoroughbred, a horse that can do\r\ntwenty miles an hour, and started for Troyes with a letter in order that\r\nit may reach Paris to-morrow! And only nine years and a half old! What\r\nwill he be at twenty?”\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect listened mechanically to these remarks. Julien gossiped\r\non, his master listening, absorbed in thought about the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Wait here,” he said to the man as he turned with slow steps to re-enter\r\nthe salon. “What a mess!” he thought to himself,--“a man who dines at\r\nGondreville and spends the night at Cinq-Cygnes! Mysteries indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Well?” cried the circle around Mademoiselle Beauvisage as soon as he\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\n“He is a count, and _vieille roche_, I answer for it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! how I should like to see him!” cried Cecile.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said Antonin, smiling and looking maliciously at Madame\r\nMollot, “he is tall and well-made and does not wear a wig. His little\r\ngroom was as drunk as the twenty-four cantons; they filled him with\r\nchampagne at Gondreville and that little scamp, only nine years old,\r\nanswered my man Julien, who asked him about his master’s wig, with all\r\nthe assumption of an old valet: ‘My master! wear a wig!--if he did I’d\r\nleave him. He dyes his hair and that’s bad enough.’”\r\n\r\n“Your opera-glass magnifies,” said Achille Pigoult to Madame Mollot, who\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, the tiger of the handsome count, drunk as he is, is now riding\r\nto Troyes to post a letter, and he’ll get there, as they say, in\r\nfive-quarters of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to have that tiger,” said Vinet.\r\n\r\n“If the count dined at Gondreville we shall soon know all about him,”\r\n remarked Cecile; “for my grandpapa is going there to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“What will strike you as very strange,” said Antonin Goulard, “is that\r\nthe party at Cinq-Cygne have just sent Mademoiselle Anicette, the maid\r\nof the Princesse de Cadignan, in the Cinq-Cygne carriage, with a note to\r\nthe stranger, and he is going now to pass the night there.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah ca_!” said Olivier Vinet, “then he is not a man; he’s a devil, a\r\nphoenix, he will poculate--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, fie! monsieur,” said Madame Mollot, “you use words that are\r\nreally--”\r\n\r\n“‘Poculate’ is a word of the highest latinity, madame,” replied Vinet,\r\ngravely. “So, as I said, he will poculate with Louis Philippe in the\r\nmorning, and banquet at the Holy-Rood with Charles the Tenth at\r\nnight. There is but one reason that allows a decent man to go to both\r\ncamps--from Montague to Capulet! Ha, ha! I know who that stranger is.\r\nHe’s--”\r\n\r\n“The president of a railway from Paris to Lyons, or Paris to Dijon, or\r\nfrom Montereau to Troyes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” said Antonin. “You have it. There’s nothing but\r\nspeculation that is welcomed everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, just see how great names, great families, the old and the new\r\npeerage are rushing hot-foot into enterprises and partnerships,” said\r\nAchille Pigoult.\r\n\r\n“Francs attract the Franks,” remarked Olivier Vinet, without a smile.\r\n\r\n“You are not an _olive_-branch of peace,” said Madame Mollot, laughing.\r\n\r\n“But is it not demoralizing to see such names as Verneuil, Maufrigneuse,\r\nand Herouville side by side with those of du Tillet and Nucingen in the\r\nBourse speculations?”\r\n\r\n“Our great Unknown is undoubtedly an embryo railway,” said Olivier\r\nVinet.\r\n\r\n“Well, to-morrow all Arcis will be upside-down about it,” said Achille\r\nPigoult. “I shall call upon the Unknown and ask him to make me notary of\r\nthe affair. There’ll be two thousand deeds to draw, at the least.”\r\n\r\n“Our romance is turning into a locomotive,” said Ernestine to Cecile.\r\n\r\n“A count with a railway is all the more marriageable,” remarked Achille\r\nPigoult. “But who knows whether he is a bachelor?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I shall know that to-morrow from grandpapa,” cried Cecile, with\r\npretended enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“What a jest!” said Madame Mollot. “You can’t really mean, my little\r\nCecile, that you are thinking of that stranger?”\r\n\r\n“But the husband is always the stranger,” interposed Olivier Vinet,\r\nmaking a sign to Mademoiselle Beauvisage which she fully understood.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t I think of him?” asked Cecile; “that isn’t compromising.\r\nBesides, he is, so these gentlemen say, either some great speculator, or\r\nsome great seigneur, and either would suit me. I love Paris; and I want\r\na house, a carriage, an opera-box, etc., in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said Vinet. “When people dream, they needn’t refuse\r\nthemselves anything. If I had the pleasure of being your brother I\r\nshould marry you to the young Marquis de Cinq-Cygne, who seems to me a\r\nlively young scamp who will make the money dance, and will laugh at his\r\nmother’s prejudices against the actors in the famous Simeuse melodrama.”\r\n\r\n“It would be easier for you to make yourself prime-minister,”\r\n said Madame Marion. “There will never be any alliance between the\r\ngranddaughter of Grevin and the Cinq-Cygnes.”\r\n\r\n“Romeo came within an ace of marrying Juliet,” remarked Achille Pigoult,\r\n“and Mademoiselle is more beautiful than--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! if you are going to quote operas and opera beauties!” said Herbelot\r\nthe notary, naively, having finished his game of whist.\r\n\r\n“My legal brother,” said Achille Pigoult, “is not very strong on the\r\nhistory of the middle ages.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Malvina!” said the stout notary to his wife, making no reply to\r\nhis young associate.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Monsieur Antonin,” said Cecile to the sub-prefect, “you spoke\r\nof Anicette, the maid of the Princesse de Cadignan; do you know her?”\r\n\r\n“No, but Julien does; she is the goddaughter of his father, and they are\r\ngood friends together.”\r\n\r\n“Then try, through Julien, to get her to live with us. Mamma wouldn’t\r\nconsider wages.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, to hear is to obey, as they say to despots in Asia,”\r\n replied the sub-prefect. “Just see to what lengths I will go in order to\r\nserve you.”\r\n\r\nAnd he left the room to give Julien orders to go with Anicette in the\r\nchariot and coax her away from the princess at any price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. IN WHICH THE CANDIDATE BEGINS TO LOSE VOTES\r\n\r\nAt this moment Simon Giguet, who had got through his bowing and scraping\r\nto all the influential men of Arcis, and who regarded himself as sure of\r\nhis election, joined the circle around Cecile and Mademoiselle Mollot.\r\nThe evening was far advanced. Ten o’clock had struck. After an enormous\r\nconsumption of cakes, orgeat, punch, lemonade, and various syrups, those\r\nwho had come that evening solely for political reasons and who were\r\nnot accustomed to Madame Marion’s floors, to them aristocratic,\r\ndeparted,--all the more willingly, because they were unaccustomed to\r\nsitting up so late. The evening then began to take on its usual air of\r\nintimacy. Simon Giguet hoped that he could now exchange a few words with\r\nCecile, and he looked at her like a conqueror. The look displeased her.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Antonin to Simon, observing on his friend’s face\r\nthe glory of success, “you come at a moment when the noses of all the\r\nyoung men in Arcis are put out of joint.”\r\n\r\n“Very much so,” said Ernestine, whom Cecile had nudged with her elbow.\r\n“We are distracted, Cecile and I, about the great Unknown, and we are\r\nquarrelling for him.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Cecile, “he is no longer unknown; he is a count.”\r\n\r\n“Some adventurer!” replied Simon Giguet, with an air of contempt.\r\n\r\n“Will you say that, Monsieur Simon,” answered Cecile, feeling piqued,\r\n“of a man to whom the Princesse de Cadignan has just sent her servants,\r\nwho dined at Gondreville to-day, and is to spend this evening with the\r\nMarquise de Cinq-Cygne?”\r\n\r\nThis was said sharply, and in so hard a tone that Simon was\r\ndisconcerted.\r\n\r\n“Ah, mademoiselle,” said Olivier Vinet, “if we said to each other’s\r\nfaces what we all say behind our backs, social life wouldn’t be\r\npossible. The pleasures of society, especially in the provinces, are to\r\nslander and backbite our neighbors.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Simon is jealous of your enthusiasm for the mysterious count,”\r\n said Ernestine.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Cecile, “that Monsieur Simon has no right to be\r\njealous of my affections.”\r\n\r\nAfter which remark, uttered in a way to dumfound Simon, Cecile rose;\r\nthe others made way for her and she went to her mother, who was just\r\nfinishing her rubber of whist.\r\n\r\n“My dearest!” cried Madame Marion, hurrying after the heiress, “I think\r\nyou are rather hard on my poor Simon.”\r\n\r\n“What has she done, my dear little kitten?” asked Madame Beauvisage.\r\n\r\n“Mamma, Monsieur Simon called my great Unknown an adventurer!”\r\n\r\nSimon had followed his aunt and was now beside the card-table. The four\r\npersons whose interests were concerned were thus in the middle of the\r\nsalon,--Cecile and her mother on one side of the table, Madame Marion\r\nand her nephew on the other.\r\n\r\n“Really, madame,” said Simon Giguet, “there must be a strong desire to\r\nfind fault and to quarrel with me simply because I happened to say\r\nthat a gentleman whom all Arcis is talking about and who stops at the\r\nMulet--”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he has come here to put himself in competition with you?”\r\n said Madame Beauvisage jestingly.\r\n\r\n“I should be very indignant with him certainly if he were to cause the\r\nslightest misunderstanding between Mademoiselle Cecile and myself,” said\r\nthe candidate, with a supplicating look at the young girl.\r\n\r\n“You gave your opinion, monsieur, in a decisive manner which proves that\r\nyou are very despotic,” she replied; “but you are right; if you wish to\r\nbe minister you ought to be decisive.”\r\n\r\nHere Madame Marion took Madame Beauvisage by the arm and led her to\r\na sofa. Cecile, finding herself alone, returned to her former seat to\r\navoid hearing Simon’s answer to her speech, and the candidate was left\r\nstanding rather foolishly before the table, where he mechanically played\r\nwith the counters.\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Madame Marion in a low voice to Madame\r\nBeauvisage, “you see that nothing can now hinder my nephew’s election.”\r\n\r\n“I am delighted both for your sake and for the Chamber of Deputies,”\r\n said Severine.\r\n\r\n“My nephew is certain to go far, my dear; and I’ll tell you why: his\r\nown fortune, that which his father will leave him and mine, will amount\r\naltogether to some thirty thousand francs a year. When a man is a deputy\r\nand has a fortune like that, he can aspire to anything.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, he has our utmost admiration and our most earnest wishes for\r\nthe success of his political career; but--”\r\n\r\n“I am not asking for an answer,” said Madame Marion, hastily\r\ninterrupting her friend. “I only beg you to reflect on the following\r\nsuggestions: Do our children suit each other? Can we marry them? We\r\nshould then live in Paris during the sessions; and who knows if the\r\ndeputy of Arcis may not be settled there permanently in some fine place\r\nin the magistracy? Look at Monsieur Vinet of Provins, how he has made\r\nhis way. People blamed Mademoiselle de Chargeboeuf for marrying him; yet\r\nshe will soon be wife of the Keeper of the Seals; Monsieur Vinet can be\r\npeer of France whenever he pleases.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I have not the power to marry my daughter according to my own\r\ntastes. In the first place, her father and I leave her absolutely free\r\nto choose for herself. If she wanted to marry the ‘great Unknown’ and we\r\nfound that the match was suitable, we should give our consent. Besides\r\nthis, Cecile is wholly dependent on her grandfather, who intends to give\r\nher on her marriage the Hotel de Beauseant in Paris, which he purchased\r\nfor us six years ago; the value of which is now rated at eight hundred\r\nthousand francs. It is one of the finest houses in the faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain. Moreover, he intends to add two hundred thousand francs\r\nfor the cost of fitting it up. A grandfather who behaves in this way,\r\nand who can influence my mother-in-law to make a few sacrifices for\r\nher granddaughter in expectation of a suitable marriage, has a right to\r\nadvise--”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Madame Marion, stupefied by this confidence, which\r\nmade the marriage of her nephew and Cecile extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n“Even if Cecile had nothing to expect from her grandfather Grevin,”\r\n continued Madame Beauvisage, “she would not marry without first\r\nconsulting him. If you have any proposals to make, go and see my\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; I will go,” said Madame Marion.\r\n\r\nMadame Beauvisage made a sign to Cecile, and together they left the\r\nsalon.\r\n\r\nThe next day Antonin and Frederic Marest found themselves, according\r\nto their usual custom, with Monsieur Martener and Olivier, beneath the\r\nlindens of the Avenue of Sighs, smoking their cigars and walking up and\r\ndown. This daily promenade is one of the petty pleasures of government\r\nofficials in the provinces when they happen to be on good terms with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAfter they had made a few turns, Simon Giguet came up and joined them\r\nsaying to the sub-prefect with a mysterious air:--\r\n\r\n“You ought to be faithful to an old comrade who wishes to get you the\r\nrosette of an officer and a prefecture.”\r\n\r\n“You are beginning your political career betimes,” said Antonin,\r\nlaughing. “You are trying to corrupt me, rapid puritan!”\r\n\r\n“Will you support me?”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, you know very well that Bar-sur-Aube votes here. Who\r\ncan guarantee a majority under such circumstances? My colleague of\r\nBar-sur-Aube would complain of me if I did not unite my efforts with his\r\nin support of the government. Your promise is conditional; whereas my\r\ndismissal would be certain.”\r\n\r\n“But I have no competitors.”\r\n\r\n“You think so,” said Antonin, “but some one is sure to turn up; you may\r\nrely on that.”\r\n\r\n“Why doesn’t my aunt come, when she knows I am on a gridiron!” exclaimed\r\nGiguet, suddenly. “These three hours are like three years!”\r\n\r\nHis secret had escaped him and he now admitted to his friend that Madame\r\nMarion had gone on his behalf to old Grevin with a formal proposal for\r\nCecile’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe pair had now reached the Brienne road opposite to the Mulet\r\nhostelry. While the lawyer looked down the street towards the bridge his\r\naunt would have to cross, the sub-prefect examined the gullies made by\r\nthe rain in the open square. Arcis is not paved. The plains of Champagne\r\nfurnish no material fit for building, nor even pebbles large enough for\r\ncobble-stone pavements. One or two streets and a few detached places\r\nare imperfectly macadamized and that is saying enough to describe their\r\ncondition after a rain. The sub-prefect gave himself an appearance\r\nof occupation by apparently exercising his thoughts on this important\r\nobject; but he lost not a single expression of suffering on the anxious\r\nface of his companion.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the stranger was returning from the Chateau de\r\nCinq-Cygne, where he had apparently passed the night. Goulard resolved\r\nto clear up, himself, the mystery wrapped about the Unknown, who was\r\nphysically enveloped in an overcoat of thick cloth called a _paletot_,\r\nthen the fashion. A mantle, thrown across his knees for a covering, hid\r\nthe lower half of his body, while an enormous muffler of red cashmere\r\ncovered his neck and head to the eyes. His hat, jauntily tipped to\r\none side, was, nevertheless, not ridiculous. Never was a mystery more\r\nmysteriously bundled up and swathed.\r\n\r\n“Look out!” cried the tiger, who preceded the tilbury on horseback.\r\n“Open, papa Poupart, open!” he screamed in his shrill little voice.\r\n\r\nThe three servants of the inn ran out, and the tilbury drove in without\r\nany one being able to see a single feature of the stranger’s face. The\r\nsub-prefect followed the tilbury into the courtyard, and went to the\r\ndoor of the inn.\r\n\r\n“Madame Poupart,” said Antonin, “will you ask Monsieur--Monsieur--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know his name,” said Gothard’s sister.\r\n\r\n“You do wrong! The rules of the police are strict, and Monsieur Groslier\r\ndoesn’t trifle, like some commissaries of police.”\r\n\r\n“Innkeepers are never to blame about election-time,” remarked the little\r\ntiger, getting off his horse.\r\n\r\n“I’ll repeat that to Vinet,” thought the sub-prefect. “Go and ask your\r\nmaster if he can receive the sub-prefect of Arcis.”\r\n\r\nPresently Paradise returned.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur begs Monsieur the sub-prefect to come up; he will be delighted\r\nto see him.”\r\n\r\n“My lad,” said Olivier Vinet, who with the two other functionaries had\r\njoined the sub-prefect before the inn, “how much does your master give a\r\nyear for a boy of your cut and wits?”\r\n\r\n“Give, monsieur! What do you take me for? Monsieur le comte lets himself\r\nbe milked, and I’m content.”\r\n\r\n“That boy was raised in a good school!” said Frederic Marest.\r\n\r\n“The highest school, monsieur,” said the urchin, amazing the four\r\nfriends with his perfect self-possession.\r\n\r\n“What a Figaro!” cried Vinet.\r\n\r\n“Mustn’t lower one’s price,” said the infant. “My master calls me a\r\nlittle Robert-Macaire, and since we have learned how to invest our money\r\nwe are Figaro, plus a savings bank.”\r\n\r\n“How much do you earn?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! some races I make two or three thousand francs--and without selling\r\nmy master, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Sublime infant!” said Vinet; “he knows the turf.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and all gentlemen riders,” said the child, sticking out his tongue\r\nat Vinet.\r\n\r\nAntonin Goulard, ushered by the landlord into a room which had been\r\nturned into a salon, felt himself instantly under the focus of an\r\neyeglass held in the most impertinent manner by the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the sub-prefect with a certain official hauteur, “I\r\nhave just learned from the wife of the innkeeper that you refuse to\r\nconform to the ordinances of the police, and as I do not doubt that you\r\nare a person of distinction, I have come myself--”\r\n\r\n“Is your name Goulard?” demanded the stranger in a high voice.\r\n\r\n“I am the sub-prefect, monsieur,” replied Antonin Goulard.\r\n\r\n“Your father belonged to the Simeuse family?”\r\n\r\n“And I, monsieur, belong to the government; that is how times differ.”\r\n\r\n“You have a servant named Julien, who has tried to entice the Princesse\r\nde Cadignan’s maid away from her?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I do not allow any one to speak to me in this manner,” said\r\nGoulard; “you misunderstand my character.”\r\n\r\n“And you want to know about mine!” returned the Unknown. “Well, I\r\nwill now make myself known. You can write in the landlord’s book:\r\n‘Impertinent fellow. Direct from Paris. Age doubtful. Travelling for\r\npleasure.’ It would be rather a novelty in France to imitate England and\r\nlet people come and go as they please, without tormenting them at every\r\nturn for ‘papers.’ I have no passport; now, what will you do to me?”\r\n\r\n“The _procureur-du-roi_ is walking up and down there under the lindens,”\r\n said the sub-prefect.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Marest! Wish him good-morning from me.”\r\n\r\n“But who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever you wish me to be, my dear Monsieur Goulard,” said the\r\nstranger. “You alone shall decide _what_ I am to be in this department.\r\nGive me some advice on that head. Here, read that.”\r\n\r\nAnd the stranger handed the sub-prefect the following letter:--\r\n\r\n  (Confidential.)       Prefecture of the Aube.\r\n\r\n  Monsieur the Sub-prefect,--You will consult with the bearer of\r\n  this letter as to the election at Arcis, and you will conform to\r\n  all the suggestions and requests he may make to you. I request you\r\n  to conduct this matter with the utmost discretion, and to treat\r\n  the bearer with all the respect that is due to his station.\r\n\r\nThe letter was written and signed by the prefect of the Aube.\r\n\r\n“You have been talking prose without knowing it,” said the Unknown,\r\ntaking back the letter.\r\n\r\nAntonin Goulard, already struck with the aristocratic tone and manners\r\nof this personage, became respectful.\r\n\r\n“How was that, monsieur?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“By endeavoring to entice Anicette. She told us of the attempts of your\r\nman Julien to corrupt her. But my little tiger, Paradise, got the better\r\nof him, and he ended by admitting that you wanted to put Anicette into\r\nthe service of one of the richest families in Arcis. Now, as the\r\nrichest family in Arcis is the Beauvisage family I make no doubt it is\r\nMademoiselle Cecile who covets this treasure.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; then Anicette shall enter the Beauvisage household at once.”\r\n\r\nHe whistled. Paradise presented himself so rapidly that his master said:\r\n“You were listening!”\r\n\r\n“In spite of myself, Monsieur le comte; these partitions are nothing but\r\npaper. But if Monsieur le comte prefers, I will move upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“No, you can listen; it is your perquisite. It is for me to speak low\r\nwhen I don’t want you to know my affairs. Go back to Cinq-Cygne, and\r\ngive this gold piece to that little Anicette from me. Julien shall have\r\nthe credit of enticing her away,” he continued, addressing Goulard.\r\n“That bit of gold will inform her that she is to follow him. Anicette\r\nmay be useful to the success of our candidate.”\r\n\r\n“Anicette?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, it is now thirty-two years since lady’s-maids have served\r\nmy purposes. I had my first adventure at the age of thirteen, like the\r\nregent, the great-great-grandfather of our present King. Do you know the\r\nfortune of this Mademoiselle Beauvisage?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help knowing it, monsieur, for yesterday at Madame Marion’s,\r\nMadame Beauvisage said openly that Monsieur Grevin, Cecile’s\r\ngrandfather, would give his granddaughter the hotel de Beauseant in\r\nParis and two hundred thousand francs for a wedding present.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger’s eyes expressed no surprise. He seemed to consider the\r\nfortune rather paltry.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Arcis well?” he asked of Goulard.\r\n\r\n“I am the sub-prefect and I was born here.”\r\n\r\n“What is the best way to balk curiosity?”\r\n\r\n“By satisfying it. For instance, Monsieur le Comte has a baptismal name;\r\nlet him register that with the title of count.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; Comte Maxime.”\r\n\r\n“And if monsieur will assume the position of a railway official, Arcis\r\nwill be content; it will amuse itself by floating that stick at least\r\nfor a fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“No, I prefer to be concerned in irrigation; it is less common. I have\r\ncome down to survey the wastelands of Champagne in order to reclaim\r\nthem. That will be, my good Monsieur Goulard, a reason for inviting me\r\nto dine with you to-morrow to meet the mayor and his family; I wish to\r\nsee them, and study them.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be only to happy to receive you,” said the sub-prefect; “but I\r\nmust ask your indulgence for the deficiencies of my little household.”\r\n\r\n“If I succeed in managing the election of Arcis according to the wishes\r\nof those who have sent me here, you, my dear friend, will be made a\r\nprefect. Here, read these”; and he held out two letters to his visitor.\r\n\r\n“Very good, Monsieur le comte,” said Antonin, returning them.\r\n\r\n“Make a list of all the votes on which the ministry may count. Above\r\nall, let no one suspect that you and I understand each other. I am a\r\nspeculator in land, and I don’t care a fig for elections.”\r\n\r\n“I will send the commissary of police to force you to inscribe your name\r\non Poupart’s register.”\r\n\r\n“So do. Adieu, monsieur. Heavens! what a region this is,” said the\r\ncount, in a loud voice; “one can’t take a step without having the\r\ncommunity, sub-prefect and all, on one’s back.”\r\n\r\n“You will have to answer to the commissary of police, monsieur,” said\r\nAntonin, in an equally loud tone.\r\n\r\nAnd for the next twenty minutes Madame Mollot talked of the altercation\r\nthat took place between the sub-prefect and the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Well, what wood is the beam that has plumped into our bog made of?”\r\n said Olivier Vinet when Antonin Goulard rejoined them on leaving the\r\nMulet.\r\n\r\n“He is a Comte Maxime who is here to study the geological system\r\nof Champagne, with a view to finding mineral waters,” replied the\r\nsub-prefect, with an easy manner.\r\n\r\n“Say a speculator,” said Oliver.\r\n\r\n“Does he expect to get the natives to lay out capital?” asked Monsieur\r\nMartener.\r\n\r\n“I doubt if our royalists will go into that kind of mining,” remarked\r\nVinet, laughing.\r\n\r\n“What should you think from the air and gestures of Madame Marion?” said\r\nthe sub-prefect turning off the subject by pointing to Madame Marion and\r\nSimon, who were deep in conversation.\r\n\r\nSimon had gone toward the bridge to meet his aunt, and was now walking\r\nwith her up the square.\r\n\r\n“If he was accepted one word would suffice,” said the shrewd Olivier.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said all the officials when Simon came to them under the\r\nlindens.\r\n\r\n“My aunt thinks the matter very hopeful,” replied Simon. “Madame\r\nBeauvisage and old Grevin, who has just gone to Gondreville, were not at\r\nall surprised at my proposals; they talked of our respective fortunes,\r\nand said they wished to leave Cecile perfectly free to make her choice.\r\nBesides which, Madame Beauvisage said that, as for herself, she saw\r\nno objection to an alliance by which she should feel herself honored;\r\nalthough she postponed all answer until after my election, and possibly\r\nmy first appearance in the Chamber. Old Grevin said he should consult\r\nthe Comte de Gondreville, without whose advice he never took any\r\nimportant step.”\r\n\r\n“All of which means,” said Goulard, point-blank, “that you will never\r\nmarry Cecile, my old fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Giguet, ironically.\r\n\r\n“My dear friend, Madame Beauvisage and her daughter spend four\r\nevenings every week in the salon of your aunt; your aunt is the most\r\ndistinguished woman in Arcis; and she is, though twenty years the elder,\r\nan object of envy to Madame Beauvisage; don’t you see, therefore, that\r\nthey wished to wrap up their refusal in certain civilities?”\r\n\r\n“Not to say entire yes or no in such cases,” said Vinet, “is to say\r\n_no_, with due regard to the intimacy of the two families. Though Madame\r\nBeauvisage has the largest fortune in Arcis, Madame Marion is the\r\nmost esteemed woman in the place; for, with the exception of our\r\nchief-justice’s wife, who sees no one now, she is the only woman who\r\nknows how to hold a salon; she is the queen of Arcis. Madame Beauvisage\r\nhas tried to make her refusal polite, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“I think that old Grevin was fooling your mother,” said Frederic Marest.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday you attacked the Comte de Gondreville, you insulted and\r\ngrievously affronted him, and he is to be consulted about your marriage\r\nto Cecile!”\r\n\r\n“Pere Grevin is a sly old dog,” said Vinet.\r\n\r\n“Madame Beauvisage is very ambitious,” pursued Antonin Goulard. “She\r\nknows very well her daughter is to have two millions; she means to be\r\nmother-in-law of a minister, or an ambassador, in order to play the\r\ngreat lady in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why not?” said Simon Giguet.\r\n\r\n“I wish you may get it!” replied the sub-prefect looking at Vinet,\r\nwith whom he went off into a hearty laugh as soon as they were out of\r\nhearing. “He won’t even be deputy,” added Antonin, addressing Vinet;\r\n“the ministry have other views. You will find a letter from your father\r\nwhen you get home, enjoining you to make sure of the votes of all the\r\npersons in your department, and see that they go for the ministerial\r\ncandidate. Your own promotion depends on this; and he requests you to be\r\nvery discreet.”\r\n\r\n“But who is the candidate for whom our ushers and sheriffs and clerks,\r\nand solicitors and notaries are to vote?” asked Vinet.\r\n\r\n“The one I shall name to you.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know my father has written to me, and what he wrote?”\r\n\r\n“The stranger told me--”\r\n\r\n“The man after water?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Vinet, you and I are not to know; we must treat him as a\r\nstranger. He saw your father at Provins as he came through. Just now\r\nthis same man gave me a note from the prefect instructing me to\r\nfollow in every particular the instructions of Comte Maxime about this\r\nelection. I knew very well I should have a battle to fight! Come\r\nand dine somewhere and we will get out our batteries. You are to be\r\n_procureur-du-roi_ at Mantes, and I am to be prefect; but we must _seem_\r\nto have nothing to do with the election, for don’t you see, we are\r\nbetween the hammer and the anvil. Simon is the candidate of a party\r\nwhich wants to overturn the present ministry and may succeed; but for\r\nmen as intelligent as you and I there is but one course to take.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“To serve those who make and unmake ministers. A letter was shown to\r\nme from one of those personages who represent the stable and immovable\r\nthought of the State.”\r\n\r\nBefore going farther, it is necessary to explain who this Unknown person\r\nwas, and what his purpose was in coming to Champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE SALON OF MADAME D’ESPARD\r\n\r\nAbout two months before the nomination of Simon Giguet, at eleven\r\no’clock one evening, in a mansion of the faubourg Saint-Honore belonging\r\nto the Marquise d’Espard, while tea was being served the Chevalier\r\nd’Espard, brother-in-law to the marquise, put down his tea-cup, and,\r\nlooking round the circle, remarked:--\r\n\r\n“Maxime was very melancholy to-night,--didn’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Rastignac, “but his sadness is easily accounted for. He\r\nis forty-eight years old; at that age a man makes no new friends, and\r\nnow that we have buried de Marsay, Maxime has lost the only man capable\r\nof understanding him, of being useful to him, and of using him.”\r\n\r\n“He probably has pressing debts. Couldn’t you put him in the way of\r\npaying them?” said the marquise to Rastignac.\r\n\r\nAt this period Rastignac was, for the second time, in the ministry; he\r\nhad just been made count almost against his will. His father-in-law, the\r\nBaron de Nucingen, was peer of France, his younger brother a bishop,\r\nthe Comte de Roche-Hugon, his brother-in-law, was an ambassador, and he\r\nhimself was thought to be indispensable in all future combinations of\r\nthe ministry.\r\n\r\n“You always forget, my dear marquise,” replied Rastignac, “that our\r\ngovernment exchanges its silver for gold only; it pays no heed to men.”\r\n\r\n“Is Maxime a man who would blow out his brains?” inquired the banker du\r\nTillet.\r\n\r\n“Ha! you wish I were; we should be quits then,” said Comte Maxime de\r\nTrailles, whom everybody supposed to have left the house.\r\n\r\nThe count rose suddenly, like an apparition, from the depths of an\r\narm-chair placed exactly behind that of the Chevalier d’Espard.\r\n\r\nEvery one present laughed.\r\n\r\n“Will you have a cup of tea?” said the young Comtesse de Rastignac, whom\r\nthe marquise had asked to do the honors in her place.\r\n\r\n“Gladly,” replied the count, standing before the fireplace.\r\n\r\nThis man, the prince of fashionable scoundrels, had managed to maintain\r\nhimself until now in the high and mighty position of a dandy in Paris,\r\nthen called _Gants Jaunes_ (lemon-kid-glovers), and since, “lions.”\r\n It is useless to relate the history of his youth, full of questionable\r\nadventures, with now and then some horrible drama, in which he had\r\nalways known how to save appearances. To this man women were never\r\nanything else than a means; he believed no more in their griefs than he\r\ndid in their joys; he regarded them, like the late de Marsay, as naughty\r\nchildren. After squandering his own fortune, he had spent that of a\r\nfamous courtesan, La Belle Hollandaise, the mother of Esther Gobseck.\r\nHe had caused the misery of Madame Restaud, sister of Madame Delphine de\r\nNucingen, the mother of the young Comtesse de Rastignac.\r\n\r\nThe world of Paris offers many unimaginable situations. The Baronne de\r\nNucingen was at this moment in Madame d’Espard’s salon in presence of\r\nthe author of all her sister’s misery, in presence of a murderer who\r\nkilled only the happiness of women. That, perhaps, was the reason why\r\nhe was there. Madame de Nucingen had dined at Madame d’Espard’s with her\r\ndaughter, married a few months earlier to the Comte de Rastignac, who\r\nhad begun his political career by occupying the post of under-secretary\r\nof state in the famous ministry of the late de Marsay, the only real\r\nstatesman produced by the Revolution of July.\r\n\r\nComte Maxime de Trailles alone knew how many disasters he had\r\ncaused; but he had always taken care to shelter himself from blame by\r\nscrupulously obeying the laws of the Man-Code. Though he had squandered\r\nin the course of his life more money than the four galleys of France\r\ncould have stolen in the same time, he had kept clear of justice. Never\r\nhad he lacked in honor; his gambling debts were paid scrupulously.\r\nAn admirable player, his partners were chiefly the great seigneurs,\r\nministers, and ambassadors. He dined habitually with all the members of\r\nthe diplomatic body. He fought duels, and had killed two or three men\r\nin his life; in fact, he had half murdered them, for his coolness and\r\nself-possession were unparalleled. No young man could compare with him\r\nin dress, in the distinction of his manners, the elegance of his witty\r\nspeech, the grace of his easy carriage,--in short, what was called in\r\nthose days “the grand air.” In his capacity of page to the Emperor,\r\ntrained from the age of twelve in the art of riding, he was held to be\r\nthe skilfulest of horsemen. Having always fine horses in his stable, he\r\nraised some, and ruled the fashion in equestrianism. No man could\r\nstand a supper of young bloods better than he; he drank more than the\r\nbest-trained toper, but he came out fresh and cool, and ready to begin\r\nagain as if orgy were his element. Maxime, one of those despised men who\r\nknow how to repress the contempt they inspire by the insolence of their\r\nattitude and the fear they cause, never deceived himself as to his\r\nactual position. Hence his real strength. Strong men are always their\r\nown critics.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration he had made the most of his former condition of\r\npage to the Emperor. He attributed to his pretended Bonapartist opinions\r\nthe rebuffs he met with from the different ministers when he asked for\r\nan office under the Bourbons; for, in spite of his connections, his\r\nbirth, and his dangerous aptitudes, he never obtained anything. After\r\nthe failure of these attempts he entered the secret cabal which led in\r\ntime to the fall of the Elder branch.\r\n\r\nWhen the Younger branch, preceded by the Parisian populace, had trodden\r\ndown the Elder branch and was seated on the throne, Maxime reproduced\r\nhis attachment to Napoleon, for whom he cared as much as for his first\r\nlove. He then did great services to the newcomers, who soon found the\r\npayment for them onerous; for Maxime too often demanded payment of men\r\nwho knew how to reckon those services. At the first refusal, Maxime\r\nassumed at once an attitude of hostility, threatening to reveal\r\nunpleasant details; for budding dynasties, like infants, have much\r\nsoiled linen. De Marsay, during his ministry, repaired the mistake of\r\nhis predecessors, who had ignored the utility of this man. He gave him\r\nthose secret missions which require a conscience made malleable by the\r\nhammer of necessity, an adroitness which recoils before no methods,\r\nimpudence, and, above all, the self-possession, the coolness, the\r\nembracing glance which constitute the hired _bravi_ of thought and\r\nstatesmanship. Such instruments are both rare and necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of calculation, de Marsay maintained Comte Maxime de\r\nTrailles in the highest society; he described him as a man ripened by\r\npassions, taught by experience, who knew men and things, to whom travel\r\nand a certain faculty for observation had imparted an understanding of\r\nEuropean interests, of foreign cabinets, and of all the ramifications\r\nof the great continental families. De Marsay convinced Maxime of the\r\nnecessity of doing himself credit; he taught him discretion, less as a\r\nvirtue than a speculation; he proved to him that the governing powers\r\nwould never abandon a solid, safe, elegant, and polished instrument.\r\n\r\n“In politics,” he said, blaming Maxime for having uttered a threat, “we\r\nshould never _blackmail_ but once.”\r\n\r\nMaxime was a man who could sound the depths of that saying.\r\n\r\nDe Marsay dead, Comte Maxime de Trailles had fallen back into his former\r\nstate of existence. He went to the baths every year and gambled; he\r\nreturned to Paris for the winter; but, though he received some large\r\nsums from the depths of certain niggardly coffers, that sort of half-pay\r\nto a daring man kept for use at any moment and possessing many secrets\r\nof the art of diplomacy, was insufficient for the dissipations of a\r\nlife as splendid as that of the king of dandies, the tyrant of several\r\nParisian clubs. Consequently Comte Maxime was often uneasy about matters\r\nfinancial. Possessing no property, he had never been able to consolidate\r\nhis position by being made a deputy; also, having no ostensible\r\nfunctions, it was impossible for him to hold a knife at the throat of\r\nany minister to compel his nomination as peer of France. At the present\r\nmoment he saw that Time was getting the better of him; for his lavish\r\ndissipations were beginning to wear upon his person, as they had already\r\nworn out his divers fortunes. In spite of his splendid exterior, he knew\r\nhimself, and could not be deceived about that self. He intended to “make\r\nan end”--to marry.\r\n\r\nA man of acute mind, he was under no illusion as to the apparent\r\nconsideration in which he was held; he well knew it was false. No women\r\nwere truly on his side, either in the great world of Paris or among the\r\nbourgeoisie. Much secret malignity, much apparent good-humor, and\r\nmany services rendered were necessary to maintain him in his present\r\nposition; for every one desired his fall, and a run of ill-luck might at\r\nany time ruin him. Once sent to Clichy or forced to leave the country\r\nby notes no longer renewable, he would sink into the gulf where so\r\nmany political carcasses may be seen,--carcasses of men who find no\r\nconsolation in one another’s company. Even this very evening he was in\r\ndread of a collapse of that threatening arch which debt erects over the\r\nhead of many a Parisian. He had allowed his anxieties to appear upon his\r\nface; he had refused to play cards at Madame d’Espard’s; he had talked\r\nwith the women in an absent-minded manner, and finally he had sunk down\r\nsilent and absorbed in the arm-chair from which he had just risen like\r\nBanquo’s ghost.\r\n\r\nComte Maxime de Trailles now found himself the object of all glances,\r\ndirect and indirect, standing as he did before the fireplace and\r\nillumined by the cross-lights of two candelabra. The few words said\r\nabout him compelled him, in a way, to bear himself proudly; and he did\r\nso, like a man of sense, without arrogance, and yet with the intention\r\nof showing himself to be above suspicion. A painter could scarcely have\r\nfound a better moment in which to seize the portrait of a man who, in\r\nhis way, was truly extraordinary. Does it not require rare faculties to\r\nplay such a part,--to enable one through thirty years to seduce\r\nwomen; to constrain one to employ great gifts in an underhand sphere\r\nonly,--inciting a people to rebel, tracking the secrets of austere\r\npoliticians, and triumphing nowhere but in boudoirs and on the\r\nback-stairs of cabinets?\r\n\r\nIs there not something, difficult to say what, of greatness in being\r\nable to rise to the highest calculations of statesmen and then to fall\r\ncoldly back into the void of a frivolous life? Where is the man of iron\r\nwho can withstand the alternating luck of gambling, the rapid missions\r\nof diplomacy, the warfare of fashion and society, the dissipations of\r\ngallantry,--the man who makes his memory a library of lies and craft,\r\nwho envelops such diverse thoughts, such conflicting manoeuvres, in one\r\nimpenetrable cloak of perfect manners? If the wind of favor had blown\r\nsteadily upon those sails forever set, if the luck of circumstances had\r\nattended Maxime, he could have been Mazarin, the Marechal de Richelieu,\r\nPotemkin, or--perhaps more truly--Lauzun, without Pignerol.\r\n\r\nThe count, though rather tall and constitutionally slender, had of late\r\nacquired some protuberance of stomach, but he “restrained it to the\r\nmajestic,” as Brillat-Savarin once said. His clothes were always so well\r\nmade, that he kept about his whole person an air of youth, something\r\nactive and agile, due no doubt to his habits of exercise,--fencing,\r\nriding, and hunting. Maxime possessed all the physical graces and\r\nelegances of aristocracy, still further increased by his personally\r\nsuperior bearing. His long, Bourbonine face was framed by whiskers and a\r\nbeard, carefully kept, elegantly cut, and black as jet. This color,\r\nthe same as that of his abundant hair, he now obtained by an Indian\r\ncosmetic, very costly and used in Persia, the secret of which he kept\r\nto himself. He deceived the most practised eye as to the white threads\r\nwhich for some time past had invaded his hair. The remarkable property\r\nof this dye, used by Persians for their beards only, is that it does not\r\nrender the features hard; it can be shaded by indigo to harmonize well\r\nwith the individual character of the skin. It was this operation that\r\nMadame Mollot may have seen,--though people in Arcis, by way of a jest,\r\nstill ask themselves what it was that Madame Mollot saw.\r\n\r\nMaxime had a very handsome forehead, blue eyes, a Greek nose, a pleasant\r\nmouth, and a well-cut chin; but the circle of his eyes was now marked\r\nwith numberless lines, so fine that they might have been traced by a\r\nrazor and not visible at a little distance. His temples had similar\r\nlines. The face was also slightly wrinkled. His eyes, like those of\r\ngamblers who have sat up innumerable nights, were covered with a\r\nglaze, but the glance, though it was thus weakened, was none the less\r\nterrible,--in fact, it terrified; a hidden heat was felt beneath it, a\r\nlava of passions not yet extinct. The mouth, once so fresh and rosy,\r\nnow had colder tints; it was straight no longer, but inclined to the\r\nright,--a sinuosity that seemed to indicate falsehood. Vice had twisted\r\nthe lips, but the teeth were white and handsome.\r\n\r\nThese blemishes disappeared on a general view of his face and person.\r\nHis figure was so attractive that no young man could compete with Maxime\r\nwhen on horseback in the Bois, where he seemed younger and more graceful\r\nthan the youngest and most graceful among them. The privilege of eternal\r\nyouth has been possessed by several men in our day.\r\n\r\nThe count was all the more dangerous because he seemed to be easy and\r\nindolent, never showing the iron determination which he had about all\r\nthings. This apparent indifference, which enabled him to abet a popular\r\nsedition for the purpose of strengthening the authority of a prince with\r\nas much ability as he would have bestowed upon a court intrigue, had a\r\ncertain grace. People never distrust calmness and uniformity of manner,\r\nespecially in France, where we are accustomed to a great deal of\r\nmovement and stir about the smallest things.\r\n\r\nThe count, who was dressed in the fashion of 1839, wore a black coat,\r\na cashmere waistcoat of dark blue embroidered with tiny flowers of a\r\nlighter blue, black trousers, gray silk stockings, and varnished leather\r\nshoes. His watch, placed in one of his waistcoat pockets, was fastened\r\nby an elegant chain to a button-hole.\r\n\r\n“Rastignac,” he said, accepting the cup of tea which the pretty Madame\r\nde Rastignac offered him, “will you come with me to the Austrian\r\nambassador’s?”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I am too recently married not to go home with my wife.”\r\n\r\n“That means that _later_--” said the young countess, turning round and\r\nlooking at her husband.\r\n\r\n“Later is the end of the world,” replied Maxime. “But I shall certainly\r\nwin my cause if I take Madame for a judge.”\r\n\r\nWith a charming gesture, the count invited the pretty countess to come\r\nnearer to him. After listening a few moments and looking at her mother,\r\nshe said to Rastignac:--\r\n\r\n“If you want to go to the embassy with Monsieur de Trailles, mamma will\r\ntake me home.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later the Baronne de Nucingen and the Comtesse de\r\nRastignac went away together. Maxime and Rastignac followed a little\r\nlater, and when they were both seated in the count’s carriage, the\r\nlatter said:--\r\n\r\n“What do you want of me, Maxime? Why do you take me by the throat in\r\nthis way? What did you say to my wife?”\r\n\r\n“I told her I had something to say to you. You are a lucky fellow,\r\nyou are! You have ended by marrying the only heiress of the Nucingen\r\nmillions--after twenty years at hard labor.”\r\n\r\n“Maxime!”\r\n\r\n“But I! here am I, exposed to the doubts of everybody. A miserable\r\ncoward like du Tillet dares to ask if I have the courage to kill myself!\r\nIt is high time for me to settle down. Does the ministry want to get\r\nrid of me, or does it not? You ought to know. At any rate, you must\r\nfind out,” continued Maxime, making a gesture with his hand to silence\r\nRastignac. “Here is my plan: listen to it. You ought to serve me, for\r\nI have served you, and can serve you again. The life I live now is\r\nintolerable; I want an escape from it. Help me to a marriage which\r\nshall bring me half a million. Once married, appoint me minister to some\r\nwretched little republic in America. I’ll stay there long enough to\r\nmake my promotion to the same post in Germany legitimate. If I am worth\r\nanything, they will soon take me out of it; if I am not worth anything,\r\nthey can dismiss me. Perhaps I may have a child. If so, I shall be stern\r\nwith him; his mother will be rich; I’ll make him a minister, perhaps an\r\nambassador.”\r\n\r\n“Here is my answer,” said Rastignac. “An incessant battle is going\r\non--greater than common people who are not in it have any idea\r\nof--between power in its swaddling-clothes and power in its childhood.\r\nPower in swaddling-clothes is the Chamber of Deputies which, not being\r\nrestrained by an hereditary chamber--”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” said Maxime, “you are now a peer of France.”\r\n\r\n“I should say the same if I were not,” said the new peer. “But don’t\r\ninterrupt me; you are concerned in all this. The Chamber of Deputies is\r\nfated to become the whole government, as de Marsay used to tell us (the\r\nonly man by whom France could have been saved), for peoples don’t die;\r\nthey are slaves or free men, and that’s all. Child-power is the royalty\r\nthat was crowned in August, 1830. The present ministry is beaten; it\r\ndissolves the Chamber and brings on a general election in order to\r\nprevent the coming ministry from calling one; but it does not expect a\r\nvictory. If it were victorious in these elections, the dynasty would be\r\nin danger; whereas, if the ministry is beaten, the dynastic party can\r\nfight to advantage for a long time. The mistakes of the Chamber will\r\nturn to the profit of a will which wants, unfortunately, to be the whole\r\npolitical power. When a ruler is that whole, as Napoleon was, there\r\ncomes a moment when he must supplement himself; and having by that\r\ntime alienated superior men, he, the great single will, can find no\r\nassistant. That assistant ought to be what is called a cabinet; but\r\nthere is no cabinet in France, there is only a Will with a life lease.\r\nIn France it is the government that is blamed, the opposition never; it\r\nmay lose as many battles as it fights, but, like the allies in 1814, one\r\nvictory suffices. With ‘three glorious days’ it overturned and destroyed\r\neverything. Therefore, if we are heirs of power, we must cease to\r\ngovern, and wait. I belong by my personal opinions to the aristocracy,\r\nand by my public opinions to the royalty of July. The house of Orleans\r\nserved me to raise the fortunes of my family, and I shall ever remain\r\nattached to it.”\r\n\r\n“The ‘ever’ of Monsieur de Talleyrand, be it understood,” put in Maxime.\r\n\r\n“At this moment I can’t do anything for you,” continued Rastignac. “We\r\nshall not be in power more than six months longer. Yes, those six months\r\nwill be our last dying agony, I know that; but we know what we were when\r\nwe formed ourselves, a stop-gap ministry and that was all. But you can\r\ndistinguish yourself in the electoral battle that is soon to be fought.\r\nIf you can bring one vote to the Chamber, a deputy faithful to the\r\ndynastic cause, you will find your wishes gratified. I will speak\r\nof your good services, and I will keep my eye on the reports of our\r\nconfidential agents; I may find you some difficult task in which you can\r\ndistinguish yourself. If you succeed, I can insist upon your talents,\r\nyour devotion, and claim your reward. Your marriage, my dear fellow,\r\ncan be made only in some ambitious provincial family of tradespeople or\r\nmanufacturers. In Paris you are too well known. We must therefore look\r\nout for a millionaire parvenu, endowed with a daughter, and possessed\r\nwith a desire to parade himself and his family at the Chateau des\r\nTuileries.”\r\n\r\n“Make your father-in-law lend me twenty-five thousand francs to enable\r\nme to wait as long as that; he will then have an interest in seeing\r\nthat I am not paid in holy-water if I succeed; he will further a rich\r\nmarriage for his own sake.”\r\n\r\n“You are wily, Maxime, and you distrust me. But I like able men, and I\r\nwill attend to your affair.”\r\n\r\nThey reached the Austrian embassy. The Comte de Rastignac saw the\r\nminister of the interior in one of the salons and went to talk with\r\nhim in a corner. Comte Maxime de Trailles, meantime, was apparently\r\nengrossed by the old Comtesse de Listomere, but he was, in reality,\r\nfollowing the course of the conversation between the two peers of\r\nFrance; he watched their gestures, interpreted their looks, and ended by\r\ncatching a favorable glance cast upon him by the minister.\r\n\r\nMaxime and Rastignac left the embassy together about one in the morning,\r\nand before getting into their respective carriages, Rastignac said to\r\nMaxime on the steps of the portico: “Come and see me just before the\r\nelections. Between now and then I shall know in what locality the\r\nchances of the ministry are worst, and what resources two heads like\r\nyours and mine can find there.”\r\n\r\n“But my twenty-five thousand francs are needed,” replied de Trailles.\r\n\r\n“Well, you must hide yourself, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nFifty days later, one morning before dawn, the Comte de Trailles went\r\nto the rue de Varennes, mysteriously in a hired cab. At the gate of the\r\nministry of Public Works, he sent the cab away, looked about him to see\r\nthat he was not watched, and then waited in a little salon on the first\r\nfloor until Rastignac should awake. A few moments later the valet who\r\nhad taken in his card ushered Maxime into the minister’s bed-chamber,\r\nwhere that statesman was making his morning toilet.\r\n\r\n“My dear Maxime,” said the latter, “I can tell you a secret which will\r\nbe in the newspapers two days hence, and which, meantime, you can turn\r\nto your own profit. That poor Charles Keller, who danced the mazurka so\r\nwell, as been killed in Africa. His death leaves a vacancy; he was our\r\ncandidate in the arrondissement of Arcis. Here is a copy of two reports,\r\none from the sub-prefect, the other from the commissary of police,\r\ninforming the ministry that the election of the poor fellow would meet\r\nwith opposition. In that of the commissary of police you will find some\r\ninformation about the state of the town which ought to be useful to\r\na man of your shrewdness; it seems that the ambition of the rival\r\ncandidate comes chiefly from his desire to marry a certain heiress. To\r\none of your calibre that word is enough. The Cinq-Cygnes, the Princesse\r\nde Cadignan, and Georges de Maufrigneuse are living at Cinq-Cygne,\r\nclose to Arcis; you can certainly obtain through them all the Legitimist\r\nvotes, therefore--”\r\n\r\n“Don’t waste your breath,” said Maxime. “Is the commissary still there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Give me a letter to him.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” replied Rastignac, giving Maxime quite a bundle of\r\npapers, “you will find there two letters written to Gondreville for you.\r\nYou have been a page and he has been a senator; you can’t fail therefore\r\nto understand each other. Madame Francois Keller is pious; here is a\r\nletter introducing you to her from the Marechale de Carigliano. The\r\nmarechale has become dynastic; she recommends you warmly, and may go\r\ndown herself. I will only add one word: Distrust the sub-prefect, whom\r\nI think capable of working this candidate, this Simon Giguet, into\r\na support for himself with the president of the council. If you want\r\nletters, powers, credentials, write to me.”\r\n\r\n“And those twenty-five thousand francs?” said Maxime.\r\n\r\n“Sign this note to the order of du Tillet, and here’s the money.”\r\n\r\n“I shall succeed,” said the count, “and you may tell the king that the\r\ndeputy of Arcis shall belong to him body and soul. If I fail, I give you\r\nleave to abandon me.”\r\n\r\nAn hour later Maxime de Trailles was in his tilbury on the road to\r\nArcis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. PREFACE BEFORE LETTERING\r\n\r\nOnce in possession of the information furnished by the landlady of the\r\nMulet and by the sub-prefect Antonin Goulard, Monsieur de Trailles had\r\nsoon arranged his plan of electoral operations, and this plan evinces\r\nitself so readily that the reader must already have perceived it.\r\n\r\nTo the candidacy of Simon Giguet, the wily agent of the government\r\npolicy suddenly and abruptly opposed that of Phileas Beauvisage; and\r\nin spite of the nullity and unfitness of that individual this new\r\ncombination, we must admit, had several incontestable chances of\r\nsuccess. In the light of his municipal halo Beauvisage had one enormous\r\nadvantage with the mass of indifferent voters; as mayor of the town his\r\nname was known to them. Logic has much more to do with the conducting of\r\nmatters and things here below than it seems to have; it is like a woman\r\nto whom, after many infidelities, we still return. What common-sense\r\nprescribes is that voters called upon to choose their representative\r\nin public matters should be thoroughly informed as to his capacity, his\r\nhonesty, and his general character. Too often, in practice, unfortunate\r\ntwists are given to this principle; but whenever the electoral sheep,\r\nleft to their own instincts, can persuade themselves that they are\r\nvoting from their own intelligence and their own lights, we may be\r\ncertain to see them following that line eagerly and with a sentiment\r\nof self-love. Now to know a man’s name, electorally speaking, is a good\r\nbeginning toward a knowledge of the man himself.\r\n\r\nPassing from indifferent to interested electors, we may be sure that\r\nPhileas was certain of rallying to himself the Gondreville party, now\r\ndeprived by death of their own candidate. The question for them was\r\nto punish the presumption of Simon Giguet, and any candidate would be\r\nacceptable to the viceroy of Arcis. The mere nomination of a man against\r\nhis grandson was a flagrant act of hostility and ingratitude, and a\r\ncheck to the count’s provincial importance which must be removed and\r\npunished at any cost.\r\n\r\nStill, when the first news of his electoral ambition reached his\r\nfather-in-law, Beauvisage was met by an astonishment little flattering\r\nto his feelings and not encouraging. The old notary had gauged his\r\nson-in-law once for all, and to his just and upright mind the idea of\r\nPhileas as a public man produced in its way the disagreeable effect that\r\ndiscordant instruments produce upon the ear. If it be true that no man\r\nis a prophet in his own country, he is often even less so in his own\r\nfamily. Still, the first impression once passed, Grevin would doubtless\r\nacclimatize himself to the idea of an expedient which would chime in\r\nwith the plans he had already made for Severine’s future. Besides, for\r\nthe safety of Gondreville’s interests, so seriously threatened, what\r\nsacrifice of his own opinion would the old notary not have made?\r\n\r\nWith the legitimist and the republican parties who could have no weight\r\nin the election, except that of increasing a majority, the candidacy of\r\nBeauvisage had a singular recommendation,--namely, his utter incapacity.\r\nConscious of not possessing sufficient strength to elect a deputy of\r\ntheir own, the two extremes of the antidynastic opposition seized,\r\nalmost with ardor, the opportunity to stick a thorn in the side in what\r\nthey called “the present order of things,” and it might confidently be\r\nexpected that in this frame of mind they would joyfully and with all\r\ntheir hearts support a candidate so supremely ridiculous that a large\r\nslice of the ridicule must fall upon the government which supported him.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the opinions of the Left-Centre which had provisionally\r\nadopted Simon Giguet as its candidate, this move of Beauvisage was\r\nlikely to produce a serious split; for he too had declared himself a\r\nman of the dynastic opposition, and, until further orders, Monsieur\r\nde Trailles (though all the while assuring him of the support of the\r\nministry) encouraged his retaining that political tint, which was\r\nclearly the most popular in that region. But whatever baggage of\r\npolitical convictions the incorruptible deputy of Arcis might bring with\r\nhim to Paris, his horoscope was drawn: it was very certain that after\r\nhis first appearance in the salons of the Tuileries an august seduction\r\nwould make a henchman of him, if ministerial blandishments had not\r\nalready produced that result.\r\n\r\nThe public side of this matter being thus well-planned and provided for,\r\nthe ministerial agent could turn his attention to the personal aspect\r\nof the question, namely, that of turning the stuff he was making into a\r\ndeputy to the still further use of being made into a father-in-law.\r\n\r\nFirst point, the _dot_; second point, the daughter; and both appeared to\r\nsuit him. The first did not dazzle him; but as to the second, he did not\r\nconceal from himself the imperfections of a provincial education which\r\nhe should have to unmake, but this was no serious objection to his\r\nsapient conjugal pedagogy.\r\n\r\nMadame Beauvisage, when the matter was laid before her, swept her\r\nhusband into it at a single bound. Maxime recognized her for an\r\nambitious woman who, in spite of her forty-four years, still had the\r\nair of being conscious of a heart. Hence he saw that the game had better\r\nbegin with a false attack on her to fall back later on the daughter. How\r\nfar these advanced works could be pushed, circumstances would show. In\r\neither case, Maxime was well aware that his title, his reputation as\r\na man of the world, and his masterly power of initiating them into\r\nthe difficult and elegant mysteries of Parisian society were powerful\r\nreasons to bind the two women to him, not to speak of their gratitude\r\nfor the political success of Monsieur Beauvisage of which he was the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nBut however all this might be, his matrimonial campaign offered one very\r\nserious difficulty. The consent of old Grevin would have to be obtained,\r\nand he was not a man to allow Cecile to be married without investigating\r\nto its depths the whole past of a suitor. This inquiry made, was it not\r\nto be feared that the thirty years’ stormy biography of a roue would\r\nseem to the cautious old man a poor security for the future?\r\n\r\nHowever, the species of governmental mission with which Monsieur\r\nde Trailles appeared in Arcis might seem to be an offset and even a\r\ncondonation that would neutralize the effect of such disclosures. By\r\ngetting the Comte de Gondreville to confide the news of that mission to\r\nold Grevin before it was publicly made known, he had flattered the old\r\nman’s vanity and obtained a certain foothold in his mind. Moreover, he\r\ndetermined, when the time came, to forestall the old notary’s distrust\r\nby seeming to distrust himself, and to propose, as a precaution\r\nagainst his old habits of extravagance, to introduce a clause into the\r\nmarriage-contract providing for the separation of property and settling\r\nthe wife’s fortune upon herself. In this way he gave security against\r\nany return to his old habits of prodigality. As for himself, it was his\r\naffair to obtain such empire over his wife by the power of sentiment\r\nthat he could recover practically the marital power of which the\r\ncontract dispossessed him.\r\n\r\nAt first nothing occurred to contradict the wisdom and clearsightedness\r\nof all these intentions. The Beauvisage candidacy being made public took\r\nfire like a train of gunpowder, and Monsieur de Trailles was able to\r\nfeel such assurance of the success of his efforts that he wrote to\r\nRastignac informing him of the fortunate and highly successful progress\r\nof his mission.\r\n\r\nBut, all of a sudden, in face of the triumphant Beauvisage rose another\r\ncandidate; and, be it said in passing for the sake of our history,\r\nthis rivalry presented itself under such exceptional and unforeseen\r\ncircumstances that it changed what might have been a trivial electoral\r\nstruggle into a drama possessing wider and more varied interests.\r\n\r\nThe man who now appears in this narrative will play so considerable a\r\npart in it that it seems necessary to install him, as it were, by means\r\nof retrospective and somewhat lengthy explanations. But to suspend the\r\ncourse of the narrative for this purpose would be to fly in the face\r\nof every rule of art and expose the present pious guardian of literary\r\northodoxy to the wrath of critics. In presence of this difficulty, the\r\nauthor would find himself greatly embarrassed, if his lucky star had not\r\nplaced in his hands a correspondence in which, with a vim and animation\r\nthat he himself could never have imparted to them, all the details that\r\nare essential to a full explanation will be found related.\r\n\r\nThese letters must be read with attention. They bring upon the scene\r\nmany persons already well-known in the Comedy of Human Life, and\r\nthey reveal a vast number of facts necessary to the understanding and\r\ndevelopment of the present drama. Their statements made, and brought to\r\nthe point where we now seem to abandon our narrative, the course of\r\nthat narrative will, without concussion and quite naturally, resume its\r\ncourse; and we like to persuade ourselves that, by thus introducing this\r\nseries of letters, the unity of our tale, which seemed for a moment in\r\ndanger, will be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. LETTERS EXPLANATORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE COMTE DE L’ESTORADE TO MONSIEUR MARIE-GASTON\r\n\r\n            [See “The Memoirs of Two Young Married Women.”]\r\n\r\nDear Monsieur,--In accordance with your desire I have seen the prefect\r\nof police, in order to ascertain if the pious intention of which you\r\nwrote me in your letter, dated from Carrara, would meet with opposition\r\nfrom the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe prefect informed me that the imperial decree of the 23rd Prairial,\r\nyear XII., by which the whole system of burials is still regulated,\r\nestablishes, in the most unequivocal manner, the right of all persons to\r\nbe interred on their own property. You have only to obtain a permit\r\nfrom the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise, and then, without further\r\nformality, you can remove the remains of Madame Marie-Gaston to the\r\nmausoleum you propose to erect in your park at Ville d’Avray.\r\n\r\nBut I shall venture myself to offer an objection. Are you quite sure\r\nthat you will not expose yourself to certain difficulties made by the\r\nChaulieus, with whom you are not on the best of terms?\r\n\r\nWill they not, to a certain extent, be justified in complaining that the\r\nremoval from a public cemetery to private grounds of the body of one who\r\nis dear to them as well as to you, would make their visits to her grave\r\nentirely dependent on your good will and pleasure? For of course, and\r\nthis is evident, you will always have the right to forbid their entrance\r\nto your property.\r\n\r\nI know that, legally, the body of the wife, living or dead, belongs to\r\nthe husband, to the exclusion of her relations, even the nearest; but,\r\nunder the influence of the ill-will of which they have already given you\r\nproof, the relations of Madame Marie-Gaston might have the distressing\r\nidea of carrying the matter into court, and if so, how painful to you!\r\nYou would gain the suit, no doubt, for the Duc de Chaulieu’s influence\r\nis not what it was under the Restoration; but have you reflected on the\r\nvenom which the speech of a lawyer might shed upon such a question? and\r\nremember that he will speak as the echo of honorable affections--those\r\nof a father, mother, and two brothers asking not to be deprived of the\r\nsad happiness of praying at the grave of their lost one.\r\n\r\nIf you will let me express my thought, it is not without keen regret\r\nthat I see you engaged in creating fresh nourishment for your grief,\r\nalready so long inconsolable. We had hoped that, after passing two years\r\nin Italy, you would return to us more resigned, and able to take up an\r\nactive life which might distract your mind. Evidently, this species of\r\ntemple which you propose, in the fervor of your recollections, to erect\r\nin a spot where they are, alas! already too numerous, can only serve to\r\nperpetuate their bitterness; and I cannot approve the revival you are\r\nproposing to make of them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as we should always serve a friend according to his\r\nwishes, not our own, I have done your commission relating to Monsieur\r\nDorlange, the sculptor, but I must tell you frankly that he showed no\r\neagerness to enter into your wishes. His first remark, when I announced\r\nmyself as coming from you, was that he did not know you; and this reply,\r\nsingular as it may seem to you, was made so naturally that at first I\r\nthought there must be some mistake, the result, possibly, of confusion\r\nof name. However, before long your oblivious friend was willing to agree\r\nthat he studied with you at the college of Tours and also that hew as\r\nthe same Monsieur Dorlange who, in 1831 and under quite exceptional\r\ncircumstances, carried off the grand prize for sculpture. No doubt\r\nremained in my mind as to his identity. I attributed his want of\r\nmemory to the long interruption (of which you yourself told me) in your\r\nintercourse. I think that that interruption wounded him more than you\r\nare aware, and when he seemed to have forgotten your very name, it was\r\nsimply a revenge he could not help taking when the occasion offered.\r\n\r\nBut that was not the real obstacle. Remembering the fraternal intimacy\r\nthat once existed between Monsieur Dorlange and yourself, I could not\r\nsuppose his wounded feelings inexorable. So, after explaining to him the\r\nnature of the work you wanted him to do, I was about to say a few words\r\nas to the grievance he might have against you, when I suddenly found\r\nmyself face to face with an obstacle of a most unexpected nature.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he said to me, “the importance of the order you wish to give\r\nme, the assurance that no expense should be spared for the grandeur and\r\nperfection of the work, the invitation you convey to me to go to Carrara\r\nand choose the marble and see it excavated, all that is truly a great\r\npiece of good fortune for an artist, and at any other time I should\r\ngladly have accepted it. But at the present moment, without having\r\nactually decided to abandon the career of Art, I am on the point of\r\nentering that of politics. My friends urge me to present myself at\r\nthe coming elections, and you will easily see that, if elected, my\r\nparliamentary duties and my initiation into an absolutely new life\r\nwould, for a long time at least, preclude my entering with sufficient\r\nabsorption of mind into the work you propose to me.” And then, after\r\na pause, he added; “I should have to satisfy a great grief which seeks\r\nconsolation from this projected mausoleum. Such grief would, naturally,\r\nbe impatient; whereas I should be slow, preoccupied in mind, and\r\nprobably hindered. It is therefore better that the proposal should be\r\nmade elsewhere; but this will not prevent me from feeling, as I ought,\r\nboth gratified and honored by the confidence shown in me.”\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment of asking him whether, in case his election\r\nfailed, I could then renew the proposal, but on the whole I contented\r\nmyself with expressing regret and saying that I would inform you of the\r\nresult of my mission. It is useless to add that I shall know in a few\r\ndays the upshot of this sudden parliamentary ambition which has, so\r\ninopportunely, started up in your way.\r\n\r\nI think myself that this candidacy may be only a blind. Had you not\r\nbetter write yourself to Monsieur Dorlange? for his whole manner, though\r\nperfectly polite and proper, seemed to show a keen remembrance of the\r\nwrong you did him in renouncing his friendship, with that of your other\r\nfriends, at the time of your marriage. I know it may cost you some pain\r\nto explain the really exceptional circumstances of your marriage; but\r\nafter what I have seen in the mind of your old friend, I think, if\r\nyou really wish for the assistance of his great talent, you should\r\npersonally take some steps to obtain it.\r\n\r\nBut if you feel that any such action is more than you have strength for,\r\nI suggest another means. In all matters in which my wife has taken part\r\nI have found her a most able negotiator; and in this particular case\r\nI should feel the utmost confidence in her intervention. She herself\r\nsuffered from the exclusiveness of Madame Marie-Gaston’s love for you.\r\nNo one can explain to him better than she the absorbing conjugal life\r\nwhich drew its folds so closely around you. And it seems to me that the\r\nmagnanimity and comprehension which she always showed to her “dear lost\r\ntreasure,” as she calls her, might be conveyed by her to your friend.\r\n\r\nYou have plenty of time to think over this suggestion, for Madame de\r\nl’Estorade is, just now, still suffering from a serious illness, brought\r\non by maternal terror. A week ago our little Nais came near being\r\ncrushed to death before her eyes; and without the courageous assistance\r\nof a stranger who sprang to the horses’ heads and stopped them short,\r\nGod knows what dreadful misfortune would have overtaken us. This cruel\r\nemotion produced in Madame de l’Estorade a nervous condition which\r\nseriously alarmed us for a time. Though she is now much better, it\r\nwill be several days before she could see Monsieur Dorlange in case her\r\nfeminine mediation may seem to you desirable.\r\n\r\nBut once more, in closing, my dear Monsieur Gaston, would it not be\r\nbetter to abandon your idea? A vast expense, a painful quarrel with the\r\nChaulieus, and, for you, a renewal of your bitter sorrow--this is what\r\nI fear. Nevertheless, I am, at all times and for all things, entirely at\r\nyour orders, as indeed my sentiments of esteem and gratitude command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nParis, February, 1839.\r\n\r\nDear Madame de Camps,--Of all the proofs of sympathy which the accident\r\nto my dear child has brought me, not one has touched me so much as your\r\nexcellent letter.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your affectionate solicitude I must tell you that in that\r\nterrible moment Nais was marvellously calm and self-possessed. It could\r\nnot, I think, be possible to see death nearer; yet neither before nor\r\nafter the accident did my valiant little daughter even blench; her whole\r\nbehavior showed the utmost resolution, and, thank God! her health has\r\nnot suffered for a moment.\r\n\r\nAs for me, in consequence of such terror, I was seized with convulsive\r\nspasms, and for several days, as I now hear, the doctors were very\r\nuneasy, and even feared for my reason. But thanks to the strength of my\r\nconstitution, I am now almost myself again, and nothing would remain of\r\nthis cruel agitation if, by a singular fatality, it were not connected\r\nwith another unpleasant circumstance which has lately seen fit to fasten\r\nupon my life.\r\n\r\nBefore receiving from your letter these fresh assurances of your regard,\r\nI had thought of invoking the help of your friendship and advice; and\r\nto-day, when you tell me that it would make you happy and proud to take\r\nthe place of my poor Louise de Chaulieu, the precious friend of whom\r\ndeath has deprived me, can I hesitate for a moment?\r\n\r\nI take you at your word, and that delightful cleverness with which you\r\nfoiled the fools who commented on your marriage to Monsieur de Camps\r\n[see “Madame Firmiani”], that singular tact with which we saw you steer\r\nyour way through circumstances that were full of embarrassment and\r\ndanger, in short the wonderful art which enabled you to keep both\r\nyour secret and your dignity, I now ask you to put to the service of\r\nassisting me in the dilemma I mentioned just now.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in consulting a physician we naturally want to see him and\r\ntell him our symptoms _viva voce_, and it is here that Monsieur de Camps\r\nwith his industrial genius seems to me most aggravating. Thanks to those\r\nvillanous iron-works which he has taken it into his head to purchase,\r\nyou are almost lost to Paris and to society! Formerly when we had you\r\nhere, at hand, in ten minutes talk, without embarrassment, without\r\npreparation, I could have told you everything; but now I am obliged to\r\nthink over what I have to say, to gather myself together, and pass into\r\nthe solemnity of a written statement.\r\n\r\nBut after all, perhaps it is better to plunge boldly in, and since, in\r\nspite of circumlocutions and preambles, I shall have sooner or later\r\nto come to the point, why not say at once that my trouble concerns the\r\nstranger who saved my daughter’s life.\r\n\r\nStranger! yes, a stranger to Monsieur de l’Estorade and to all who have\r\ntold you about the accident, but not a stranger to me, whom, for the\r\nlast three months, this man has condescended to honor with the most\r\nobstinate attention. That the mother of three children, one of them\r\na big boy of fifteen, should at thirty-three years of age become the\r\nobject of an ardent passion will seem to you, as it does to me, an\r\nimpossible fact; and that is the ridiculous misfortune about which I\r\nwant to consult you.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that this stranger is known to me, I must correct myself; for\r\nI know neither his name, nor his abode, nor anything about him. I have\r\nnever met him in society, and I may add that, although he wears\r\nthe ribbon of the Legion of honor, there is nothing in his air and\r\nmanner--which are totally devoid of elegance--to make me suppose I ever\r\nshall meet him in our world.\r\n\r\nIt was at Saint-Thomas d’Aquin, where, as you know, I go to hear mass,\r\nthat this annoying obsession began. I used almost daily to take my\r\nchildren to walk in the Tuileries, as the house we have hired here\r\nhas no garden. This habit being noticed by my persecutor, I found him\r\nrepeatedly there and wherever else I might be met outside of my own\r\nhome. Perfectly discreet, although so audacious, this singular follower\r\nnever accompanied me to my own door; he kept at a sufficient distance to\r\ngive me the comfort of feeling that his foolish assiduity would not be\r\nobserved by others.\r\n\r\nHeaven only knows the sacrifices and annoyances I have borne to be rid\r\nof him. I never go to church now except on Sundays; I often keep my dear\r\nchildren at home to the injury of their health; or else I make excuses\r\nnot to accompany them, and against all the principles of my education\r\nand prudence, I leave them to the care of the servants. Visits, shopping\r\nI do only in a carriage, which did not prevent my _shadow_ from being\r\nat hand when the accident happened to Nais, and saving her life, an act\r\nthat was brave and providential.\r\n\r\nBut it is precisely this great obligation I am now under which\r\nmakes--does it not, I appeal to you?--a most deplorable complication.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, about thanking him. If I do that, I encourage him,\r\nand he would certainly take advantage of it to change the character of\r\nour present intercourse. But if I pass him without notice--think of it!\r\na mother--a mother who owes him the life of her daughter, to pretend not\r\nto see him! to pass him without a single word of gratitude!\r\n\r\nThat, however, is the intolerable alternative in which I find myself\r\nplaced, and you can now see how much I need the counsels of your\r\nexperience. What can I do to break the unpleasant habit this man has\r\ntaken of being my shadow? How shall I thank him without encouraging him?\r\nor not thank him without incurring self-reproach?\r\n\r\nThose are the problems submitted to your wisdom. If you will do me\r\nthe kindness to solve them--and I know no one so capable--I shall add\r\ngratitude to all the other affectionate sentiments which, as you know, I\r\nhave so long felt for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE COMTE DE L’ESTORADE TO MONSIEUR MARIE-GASTON\r\n\r\nParis, February, 1839.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, my dear Monsieur Gaston, the public journals will have told you\r\nbefore this letter can arrive of the duel fought yesterday between your\r\nfriend Monsieur Dorlange and the Duc de Rhetore. But the papers, while\r\nannouncing the fact as a piece of news, are debarred by custom and\r\npropriety from inferring the motives of a quarrel, and therefore they\r\nwill only excite your curiosity without satisfying it.\r\n\r\nI have, fortunately, heard from a very good source, all the details of\r\nthe affair, and I hasten to transmit them to you; they are, I think, of\r\na nature to interest you to the highest degree.\r\n\r\nThree days ago, that is to say on the very evening of the day when I\r\npaid my visit to Monsieur Dorlange, the Duc de Rhetore occupied a stall\r\nat the Opera-house. Next to him sat Monsieur de Ronquerolles, who has\r\nrecently returned from a diplomatic mission which kept him out of France\r\nfor several years. During the entr’acte these gentlemen did not leave\r\ntheir seats to walk about the foyer; but, as is often done, they stood\r\nup, with their backs to the stage, facing the audience and consequently\r\nMonsieur Dorlange, who was seated directly behind them, seeming to\r\nbe absorbed in an evening newspaper. There had been that day a very\r\nscandalous, or what is called a very interesting, session of the Chamber\r\nof deputies.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between the duke and the marquis having naturally\r\nturned on the events of Parisian society which had taken place during\r\nMonsieur de Ronquerolles’ absence, the latter made the following remark\r\nwhich was of a nature to rouse the attention of Monsieur Dorlange.\r\n\r\n“Your poor sister Madame de Macumer! what a sad end, after her singular\r\nmarriage!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you know,” replied Monsieur de Rhetore, in that high-pitched tone\r\nof his, “my sister had too much imagination not to be romantic\r\nand visionary. She loved her first husband, Monsieur de Macumer,\r\npassionately, but after a time one gets tired of everything, even\r\nwidowhood. This Marie-Gaston crossed her path. He is agreeable in\r\nperson; my sister was rich; he was deeply in debt and behaved with\r\ncorresponding eagerness and devotion. The result was that the scoundrel\r\nnot only succeeded Monsieur de Macumer and killed his wife with\r\njealousy, but he got out of her every penny the law allowed the poor\r\nfoolish woman to dispose of. My sister’s property amounted to at\r\nleast twelve hundred thousand francs, not counting a delightful villa\r\nsplendidly furnished which she built at Ville d’Avray. Half of this that\r\nman obtained, the other half went to the Duc and Duchesse de Chaulieu,\r\nmy father and mother, who were entitled to it by law as heirs ascendant.\r\nAs for my brother Lenoncourt and myself, we were simply disinherited.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as your name, my dear Monsieur Gaston, was uttered, Monsieur\r\nDorlange laid aside his newspaper, and then, as Monsieur de Rhetore\r\nended his remarks, he rose and said:--\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Monsieur le duc, if I venture to correct your statement;\r\nbut, as a matter of conscience, I ought to inform you that you are\r\ntotally misinformed.”\r\n\r\n“What is that you say?” returned the duke, blinking his eyes and\r\nspeaking in that contemptuous tone we can all imagine.\r\n\r\n“I say, Monsieur le duc, that Marie-Gaston is my friend from childhood;\r\nhe has never been thought a _scoundrel_; on the contrary, the world\r\nknows him as a man of honor and talent. So far from killing his wife\r\nwith jealousy, he made her perfectly happy during the three years their\r\nmarriage lasted. As for the property--”\r\n\r\n“Have you considered, monsieur,” said the Duc de Rhetore, interrupting\r\nhim, “the result of such language?”\r\n\r\n“Thoroughly, monsieur; and I repeat that the property left to\r\nMarie-Gaston by the will of his wife is so little desired by him that,\r\nto my knowledge, he is about to spend a sum of two or three hundred\r\nthousand francs in building a mausoleum for a wife whom he has never\r\nceased to mourn.”\r\n\r\n“After all, monsieur, who are you?” said the Duc de Rhetore, again\r\ninterrupting him with ill-restrained impatience.\r\n\r\n“Presently,” replied Monsieur Dorlange, “I shall have the honor to tell\r\nyou; you must now permit me to add that the property of which you say\r\nyou have been disinherited Madame Marie-Gaston had the right to dispose\r\nof without any remorse of conscience. It came from her first husband,\r\nthe Baron de Macumer; and she had, previously to that marriage, given up\r\nher own property in order to constitute a fortune for your brother,\r\nthe Duc de Lenoncourt-Givry, who, as younger son, had not, like you,\r\nMonsieur le Duc, the advantages of an entail.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Monsieur Dorlange felt in his pocket for his card-case.\r\n\r\n“I have no cards with me,” he said at last, “but my name is Dorlange, a\r\ntheatrical name, easy to remember, and I live at No. 42 rue de l’Ouest.”\r\n\r\n“Not a very central quarter,” remarked Monsieur de Rhetore, ironically.\r\nThen turning to Monsieur de Ronquerolles, whom he thus constituted one\r\nof his seconds, “I beg your pardon, my dear fellow,” he said, “for\r\nthe voyage of discovery you will have to undertake for me to-morrow\r\nmorning.” And then almost immediately he added: “Come to the foyer; we\r\ncan talk there with greater _safety_.”\r\n\r\nBy his manner of accenting the last word it was impossible to mistake\r\nthe insulting meaning he intended to attach to it.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen having left their seats, without this scene attracting\r\nany notice, in consequence of the stalls being empty for the most\r\npart during the entr’acte, Monsieur Dorlange saw at some distance the\r\ncelebrated sculptor Stidmann, and went up to him.\r\n\r\n“Have you a note-book of any kind in your pocket?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I always carry one.”\r\n\r\n“Will you lend it to me and let me tear out a page? I have an idea in\r\nmy mind which I don’t want to lose. If I do not see you again after\r\nthe play to make restitution, I will send it to you to-morrow morning\r\nwithout fail.”\r\n\r\nReturning to his place, Monsieur Dorlange sketched something rapidly,\r\nand when the curtain rose and the two gentlemen returned to their seats,\r\nhe touched the Duc de Rhetore lightly on the shoulder and said, giving\r\nhim the drawing:--\r\n\r\n“My card, which I have the honor to present to you.”\r\n\r\nThis “card” was a charming sketch of an architectural design placed in a\r\nlandscape. Beneath it was written “Plan for a mausoleum to be erected to\r\nthe memory of Madame Marie-Gaston, _nee_ Chaulieu, by her husband; from\r\nthe designs of Charles Dorlange, sculptor, 42 rue de l’Ouest.”\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to let Monsieur de Rhetore know more delicately that\r\nhe had to do with a suitable adversary; and you will remark, my dear\r\nMonsieur Gaston, that Monsieur Dorlange made this drawing the means of\r\nenforcing his denial and giving proof of your disinterestedness and the\r\nsincerity of your grief.\r\n\r\nAfter the play was over, Monsieur de Rhetore parted from Monsieur\r\nde Ronquerolles, and the latter went up to Monsieur Dorlange and\r\nendeavored, very courteously, to bring about a reconciliation, remarking\r\nto him that, while he was right in the subject-matter, his method of\r\nproceeding was unusual and offensive; Monsieur de Rhetore, on the other\r\nhand, had shown great moderation, and would now be satisfied with a mere\r\nexpression of regret; in short, Monsieur de Ronquerolles said all that\r\ncan be said on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Dorlange would not listen to anything which seemed a submission\r\non his part, and the next day he received a visit from Monsieur de\r\nRonquerolles and General Montriveau on behalf of the Duc de Rhetore.\r\nAgain an effort was made to induce Monsieur Dorlange to give another\r\nturn to his words. But your friend would not depart from this\r\nultimatum:--\r\n\r\n“Will Monsieur de Rhetore withdraw the words I felt bound to notice; if\r\nso, I will withdraw mine.”\r\n\r\n“But that is impossible,” they said to him. “Monsieur de Rhetore has\r\nbeen personally insulted; you, on the contrary, have not been. Right or\r\nwrong, he has the conviction that Monsieur Marie-Gaston has done him\r\nan injury. We must always make certain allowances for wounded\r\nself-interests; you can never get absolute justice from them.”\r\n\r\n“It comes to this, then,” replied Monsieur Dorlange, “that Monsieur de\r\nRhetore may continue to calumniate my friend at his ease; in the first\r\nplace, because he is in Italy; and secondly, because Marie-Gaston would\r\nalways feel extreme repugnance to come to certain extremities with the\r\nbrother of his wife. It is precisely that powerlessness, relatively\r\nspeaking, to defend himself, which constitutes my right--I will say\r\nmore--my duty to interfere. It was not without a special permission of\r\nProvidence that I was enabled to catch a few of the malicious words that\r\nwere said of him, and, as Monsieur de Rhetore declines to modify any of\r\nthem, we must, if it please you, continue this matter to the end.”\r\n\r\nThe duel then became inevitable; the terms were arranged in the course\r\nof the day, and the meeting, with pistols, was appointed for the day\r\nafter. On the ground Monsieur Dorlange was perfectly cool. When the\r\nfirst fire was exchanged without result, the seconds proposed to put an\r\nend to the affair.\r\n\r\n“No, one more shot!” he said gaily, as if he were shooting in a\r\npistol-gallery.\r\n\r\nThis time he was shot in the fleshy part of the thigh, not a dangerous\r\nwound, but one which caused him to lose a great deal of blood. As they\r\ncarried him to the carriage which brought him, Monsieur de Rhetore, who\r\nhastened to assist them, being close beside him, he said, aloud:--\r\n\r\n“This does not prevent Marie-Gaston from being a man of honor and a\r\nheart of gold.”\r\n\r\nThen he fainted.\r\n\r\nThis duel, as you can well believe, has made a great commotion; Monsieur\r\nDorlange has been the hero of the hour for the last two days; it is\r\nimpossible to enter a single salon without finding him the one topic\r\nof conversation. I heard more, perhaps, in the salon of Madame de\r\nMontcornet than elsewhere. She receives, as you know, many artists and\r\nmen of letters, and to give you an idea of the manner in which your\r\nfriend is considered, I need only stenograph a conversation at which I\r\nwas present in the countess’s salon last evening.\r\n\r\nThe chief talkers were Emile Blondet of the “Debats,” and Monsieur\r\nBixiou, the caricaturist, one of the best-informed _ferrets_ of Paris.\r\nThey are both, I think, acquaintances of yours, but, at any rate, I\r\nam certain of your intimacy with Joseph Bridau, our great painter, who\r\nshared in the talk, for I well remember that he and Daniel d’Arthez were\r\nthe witnesses of your marriage.\r\n\r\n“The first appearance of Dorlange in art,” Joseph Bridau was saying,\r\nwhen I joined them, “was fine; the makings of a master were already so\r\napparent in the work he did for his examinations that the Academy, under\r\npressure of opinion, decided to crown him--though he laughed a good deal\r\nat its programme.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Bixiou, “and that ‘Pandora’ he exhibited in 1837, after his\r\nreturn from Rome, is also a very remarkable figure. But as she won him,\r\nat once, the cross and any number of commissions from the government and\r\nthe municipality, together with scores of flourishing articles in\r\nthe newspapers, I don’t see how he can rise any higher after all that\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Blondet, “is a regular Bixiou opinion.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt; and well-founded it is. Do you know the man?”\r\n\r\n“No; he is never seen anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; he is a bear, but a premeditated bear; a reflecting and\r\ndetermined bear.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see,” said Joseph Bridau, “why this savage inclination for\r\nsolitude should be so bad for an artist. What does a sculptor gain by\r\nfrequenting salons where gentlemen and ladies have taken to a habit of\r\nwearing clothes?”\r\n\r\n“Well, in the first place, a sculptor can amuse himself in a salon;\r\nand that will keep him from taking up a mania, or becoming a visionary;\r\nbesides, he sees the world as it is, and learns that 1839 is not the\r\nfifteenth nor the sixteenth century.”\r\n\r\n“Has Dorlange any such delusions?” asked Emile Blondet.\r\n\r\n“He? he will talk to you by the hour of returning to the life of the\r\ngreat artists of the middle ages with the universality of their studies\r\nand their knowledge, and that frightfully laborious life of theirs;\r\nwhich may help us to understand the habits and ways of a semi-barbarous\r\nsociety, but can never exist in ours. He does not see, the innocent\r\ndreamer, that civilization, by strangely complicating all social\r\nconditions, absorbs for business, for interests, for pleasures, thrice\r\nas much time as a less advanced society required for the same purposes.\r\nLook at the savage in his hut; he hasn’t anything to do. Whereas we,\r\nwith the Bourse, the opera, the newspapers, parliamentary discussions,\r\nsalons, elections, railways, the Cafe de Paris and the National\r\nGuard--what time have we, if you please, to go to work?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful theory of a do-nothing!” cried Emile Blondet, laughing.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear fellow, I am talking truth. The curfew no longer rings at\r\nnine o’clock. Only last night my concierge Ravenouillet gave a party;\r\nand I think I made a great mistake in not accepting the indirect\r\ninvitation he gave me to be present.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said Joseph Bridau, “it is certain that if a man doesn’t\r\nmingle in the business, the interests, and the pleasures of our\r\nepoch, he can make out of the time he thus saves a pretty capital.\r\nIndependently of his orders, Dorlange has, I think, a little competence;\r\nso that nothing hinders him from arranging his life to suit himself.”\r\n\r\n“But you see he goes to the opera; for it was there he found his duel.\r\nBesides, you are all wrong in representing him as isolated from this\r\ncontemporaneous life, for I happen to know that he is just about to\r\nharness himself to it by the most rattling and compelling chains of the\r\nsocial system--I mean political interests.”\r\n\r\n“Does he want to be a statesman?” asked Emile Blondet, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n“Yes, no doubt that’s in his famous programme of universality; and you\r\nought to see the consistency and perseverance he puts into that idea!\r\nOnly last year two hundred and fifty thousand francs dropped into his\r\nmouth as if from the skies, and he instantly bought a hovel in the rue\r\nSaint-Martin to make himself eligible for the Chamber. Then--another\r\npretty speculation--with the rest of the money he bought stock in the\r\n‘National,’ where I meet him every time I want to have a laugh over the\r\nrepublican Utopia. He has his flatterers on the staff of that estimable\r\nnewspaper; they have persuaded him that he’s a born orator and can\r\ncut the finest figure in the Chamber. They even talk of getting up a\r\ncandidacy for him; and on some of their enthusiastic days they go so far\r\nas to assert that he bears a distant likeness to Danton.”\r\n\r\n“But this is getting burlesque,” said Emile Blondet.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if you have ever remarked, my dear Monsieur Gaston, that in\r\nmen of real talent there is always great leniency of judgment. In this,\r\nJoseph Bridau is pre-eminent.\r\n\r\n“I think with you,” he said, “that if Dorlange takes this step, and\r\nenters politics, he will be lost to art. But, after all, why should he\r\nnot succeed in the Chamber? He expresses himself with great facility,\r\nand seems to me to have ideas at his command. Look at Canalis when he\r\nwas made deputy! ‘What! a poet!’ everybody cried out,--which didn’t\r\nprevent him from making himself a fine reputation as orator, and\r\nbecoming a minister.”\r\n\r\n“But the first question is how to get into the Chamber,” said Emile\r\nBlondet. “Where does Dorlange propose to stand?”\r\n\r\n“Why, naturally, for one of the rotten boroughs of the ‘National.’ I\r\ndon’t know if it has yet been chosen.”\r\n\r\n“General rule,” said the writer for the “Debats.” “To obtain your\r\nelection, even though you may have the support of an active and ardent\r\nparty, you must also have a somewhat extended political notoriety, or,\r\nat any rate, some provincial backing of family or fortune. Has Dorlange\r\nany of those elements of success?”\r\n\r\n“As for the backing of a family, that element is particularly lacking,”\r\n replied Bixiou; “in fact, in his case, it is conspicuously absent.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” said Emile Blondet. “Is he a natural child?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be more natural,--father and mother unknown. But I\r\nbelieve, myself, that he can be elected. It is the ins and outs of his\r\npolitical ideas that will be the wonder.”\r\n\r\n“He is a republican, I suppose, if he is a friend of those ‘National’\r\ngentlemen, and resembles Danton?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course; but he despises his co-religionists, declaring they\r\nare only good for carrying a point, and for violence and bullying.\r\nProvisionally, he is satisfied with a monarchy hedged in by republican\r\ninstitutions; but he insists that our civic royalty will infallibly be\r\nlost through the abuse of influence, which he roughly calls corruption.\r\nThis will lead him towards the little Church of the Left-centre; but\r\nthere again--for there’s always a but--he finds only a collection\r\nof ambitious minds and eunuchs unconsciously smoothing the way to a\r\nrevolution, which he, for his part, sees looming on the horizon with\r\ngreat regret, because, he says, the masses are too little prepared,\r\nand too little intelligent, not to let it slip through their fingers.\r\nLegitimacy he simply laughs at; he doesn’t admit it to be a principle\r\nin any way. To him it is simply the most fixed and consistent form of\r\nmonarchical heredity; he sees no other superiority in it than that of\r\nold wine over new. But while he is neither legitimist, nor conservative,\r\nnor Left-centre, and is republican without wanting a republic, he\r\nproclaims himself a Catholic, and sits astride the hobby of that party,\r\nnamely,--liberty of education. But this man, who wants free education\r\nfor every one, is afraid of the Jesuits; and he is still, as in 1829,\r\nuneasy about the encroachments of the clergy and the Congregation. Can\r\nany of you guess the great party which he proposes to create in the\r\nChamber, and of which he intends to be the leader? That of the righteous\r\nman, the impartial man, the honest man! as if any such thing could live\r\nand breathe in the parliamentary cook-shops; and as if, moreover, all\r\nopinions, to hide their ugly nothingness, had not, from time immemorial,\r\nwrapped themselves in that banner.”\r\n\r\n“Does he mean to renounce sculpture absolutely?” asked Joseph Bridau.\r\n\r\n“Not yet; he is just finishing the statue of some saint, I don’t know\r\nwhich; but he lets no one see it, and says he does not intend to send it\r\nto the Exhibition this year--he has ideas about it.”\r\n\r\n“What ideas?” asked Emile Blondet.\r\n\r\n“Oh! that religious works ought not to be delivered over to the judgment\r\nof critics, or to the gaze of a public rotten with scepticism; they\r\nought, he thinks, to go, without passing through the uproar of the\r\nworld, piously and modestly to the niches for which they are intended.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah ca_!” exclaimed Emile Blondet, “and it is this fervent Catholic who\r\nfights a duel!”\r\n\r\n“Better or worse than that. This Catholic lives with a woman whom he\r\nbrought back from Italy,--a species of Goddess of Liberty, who serves\r\nhim as model and housekeeper.”\r\n\r\n“What a tongue that Bixiou has; he keeps a regular intelligence office,”\r\n said some of the little group as it broke up at the offer of tea from\r\nMadame de Montcornet.\r\n\r\nYou see from this, my dear Monsieur Gaston, that the political\r\naspirations of Monsieur Dorlange are not regarded seriously by his\r\nfriends. I do not doubt that you will write to him soon to thank him\r\nfor the warmth with which he defended you from calumny. That courageous\r\ndevotion has given me a true sympathy for him, and I shall hope that\r\nyou will use the influence of early friendship to turn his mind from the\r\ndeplorable path he seems about to enter. I make no judgment on the other\r\npeculiarities attributed to him by Monsieur Bixiou, who has a cutting\r\nand a flippant tongue; I am more inclined to think, with Joseph Bridau,\r\nthat such mistakes are venial. But a fault to be forever regretted,\r\naccording to my ideas, will be that of abandoning his present career\r\nto fling himself into the maelstrom of politics. You are yourself\r\ninterested in turning him from this idea, if you strongly desire to\r\nentrust that work to his hands. Preach to him as strongly as you can the\r\nwisdom of abiding by his art.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the explanation I advised you to have with him, I must\r\ntell you that your task is greatly simplified. You need not enter\r\ninto any of the details which would be to you so painful. Madame de\r\nl’Estorade, to whom I spoke of the role of mediator which I wanted her\r\nto play, accepted the part very willingly. She feels confident of being\r\nable, after half an hour’s conversation, to remove the painful feeling\r\nfrom your friend’s mind, and drive away the clouds between you.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this long letter, I have sent for news of his condition.\r\nHe is going on favorably, and the physicians say that, barring all\r\nunforeseen accidents, his friends need have no anxiety as to his state.\r\nIt seems he is an object of general interest, for, to use the expression\r\nof my valet, people are “making cue” to leave their names at his door.\r\nIt must be added that the Duke de Rhetore is not liked, which may partly\r\naccount for this sympathy. The duke is stiff and haughty, but there is\r\nlittle in him. What a contrast the brother is to her who lives in our\r\ntenderest memory. She was simple and kind, yet she never derogated from\r\nher dignity; nothing equalled the lovable qualities of her heart but the\r\ncharms of her mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORAADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nParis, February, 1839.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more judicious than what you have written me, my dear\r\nfriend. It was certainly to have been expected that my “bore” would have\r\napproached me on the occasion of our next meeting. His heroism gave him\r\nthe right to do so, and politeness made it a duty. Under pain of being\r\nthought unmannerly he was bound to make inquiries as to the results\r\nof the accident on my health and that of Nais. But if, contrary to all\r\nthese expectations, he did not descend from his cloud, my resolution,\r\nunder your judicious advice, was taken. If the mountain did not come\r\nto me, I should go to the mountain; like Hippolyte in the tale of\r\nTheramene, I would rush upon the monster and discharge my gratitude\r\nupon him at short range. I have come to think with you that the really\r\ndangerous side of this foolish obsession on his part is its duration and\r\nthe inevitable gossip in which, sooner or later, it would involve me.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I not only accepted the necessity of speaking to my shadow\r\nfirst, but under pretence that my husband wished to call upon him and\r\nthank him in person, I determined to ask him his name and address, and\r\nif I found him a suitable person I intended to ask him to dinner on the\r\nfollowing day; believing that if he had but a shadow of common-sense,\r\nhe would, when he saw the manner in which I live with my husband, my\r\nfrantic passion, as you call it, for my children, in short, the whole\r\natmosphere of my well-ordered home, he would, as I say, certainly see\r\nthe folly of persisting in his present course. At any rate half the\r\ndanger of his pursuit was over if it were carried on openly. If I was\r\nstill to be persecuted, it would be in my own home, where we are\r\nall, more or less, exposed to such annoyances, which an honest woman\r\npossessing some resources of mind can always escape with honor.\r\n\r\nWell, all these fine schemes and all your excellent advice have come to\r\nnothing. Since the accident, or rather since the day when my physician\r\nfirst allowed me to go out, nothing, absolutely nothing have I seen\r\nof my unknown lover. But, strange to say, although his presence was\r\nintolerably annoying, I am conscious that he still exercises a sort\r\nof magnetism over me. Without seeing him, I feel him near me; his eyes\r\nweigh upon me, though I do not meet them. He is ugly, but his ugliness\r\nhas something energetic and powerfully marked, which makes one\r\nremember him as a man of strong and energetic faculties. In fact, it\r\nis impossible not to think about him; and now that he appears to have\r\nrelieved me of his presence, I an conscious of a void--that sort of void\r\nthe ear feels when a sharp and piercing noise which has long annoyed it\r\nceases. What I am going to add may seem to you great foolishness; but\r\nare we always mistress of such mirages of the imagination?\r\n\r\nI have often told you of my arguments with Louise de Chaulieu in\r\nrelation to the manner in which women ought to look at life. I used\r\nto tell her that the passion with which she never ceased to pursue the\r\nideal was ill-regulated and fatal to happiness. To this she answered:\r\n“You have never loved, my dearest; love has this rare phenomenon about\r\nit: we may live all our lives without ever meeting the being to whom\r\nnature has assigned the power of making us happy. But if the day of\r\nsplendor comes when that being unexpectedly awakes your heart from\r\nsleep, what will you do then?” [See “Memoirs of Two Young Married\r\nWomen.”]\r\n\r\nThe words of those about to die are often prophetic. What if this man\r\nwere to be the tardy serpent with whom Louise threatened me? That he\r\ncould ever be really dangerous to me; that he could make me fail in my\r\nduty, that is certainly not what I fear; I am strong against all such\r\nextremes. But I did not, like you, my dear Madame de Camps, marry a\r\nman whom my heart had chosen. It was only by dint of patience,\r\ndetermination, and reason that I was able to build up the solid and\r\nserious attachment which binds me to Monsieur de l’Estorade. Ought I\r\nnot, therefore, to be doubly cautious lest anything distract me from\r\nthat sentiment, be it only the diversion of my thoughts in this annoying\r\nmanner, to another man?\r\n\r\nI shall say to you, as, MONSIEUR, Louis XIV.’s brother, said to his\r\nwife, to whom he was in the habit of showing what he had written and\r\nasking her to decipher it: See into my heart and mind, dear friend,\r\ndisperse the mists, quiet the worries, and the flux and reflux of will\r\nwhich this affair stirs up in me. My poor Louise was mistaken, was she\r\nnot? I am not a woman, am I, on whom the passion of love could gain a\r\nfoothold? The man who, on some glorious day, will render me happy is\r\nmy Armand, my Rene, my Nais, three angels for whom I have hitherto\r\nlived--there can never be for me, I feel it deeply, another passion!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nParis, March, 1839.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1820 in the course of the same week two _news_ (to use\r\nthe schoolboy phrase of my son Armand) entered the college of Tours. One\r\nhad a charming face, the other would have been thought ugly if health,\r\nfrankness, and intelligence beaming on his features had not compensated\r\nfor their irregularity and inelegance.\r\n\r\nHere you will stop me, and ask whether I have come to the end of my own\r\nadventure, that I should now be writing this feuilleton-story. No, this\r\ntale is really a continuation of that adventure, though it seems little\r\nlike it; so, give it your best attention and do not interrupt me again.\r\n\r\nOne of these lads, the handsome one, was dreamy, contemplative, and a\r\ntrifle _elegaic_; the other, ardent, impetuous, and always in action.\r\nThey were two natures which completed each other; a priceless blessing\r\nto every friendship that is destined to last. Both had the same\r\nbar-sinister on them at their birth. The dreamer was the natural son of\r\nthe unfortunate Lady Brandon. His name was Marie-Gaston; which, indeed,\r\nseems hardly an actual name. The other, born of wholly unknown parents,\r\nwas named Dorlange, which is certainly no name at all. Dorlange, Valmon,\r\nVolmar, Melcourt, are heard upon the stage and nowhere else; already\r\nthey belong to a past style, and will soon rejoin Alceste, Arnolphe,\r\nClitandre, Damis, Eraste, Philinte, and Arsinoe.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the poor ill-born lads should cling together was\r\nthe cruel abandonment to which they were consigned. For the seven years\r\ntheir studies lasted there was not a day, even during the holidays, when\r\nthe door of their prison opened. Now and then Marie-Gaston received\r\na visit from an old woman who had served his mother; through her the\r\nquarterly payment for his schooling was regularly made. That of Dorlange\r\nwas also made with great punctuality through a banker in Tours. A point\r\nto be remarked is that the price paid for the schooling of the latter\r\nwas the highest which the rules of the establishment allowed; hence the\r\nconclusion that his unknown parents were persons in easy circumstances.\r\nAmong his comrades, Dorlange attained to a certain respect which, had\r\nit been withheld, he would very well have known how to enforce with his\r\nfists. But under their breaths, his comrades remarked that he was never\r\nsent for to see friends in the parlor, and that outside the college\r\nwalls no one appeared to take an interest in him.\r\n\r\nThe two lads, who were both destined to become distinguished men, were\r\npoor scholars; though each had his own way of studying. By the time\r\nhe was fifteen Marie-Gaston had written a volume of verses, satires,\r\nelegies, meditations, not to speak of two tragedies. The favorite\r\nstudies of Dorlange led him to steal logs of wood, out of which, with\r\nhis knife, he carved madonnas, grotesque figures, fencing-masters,\r\nsaints, grenadiers of the Old Guard, and, but this was secretly,\r\nNapoleons.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, their school-days ended, the two friends left college together\r\nand were sent to Paris. A place had been chosen for Dorlange in the\r\natelier of the sculptor Bosio, and from that moment a rather fantastic\r\ncourse was pursued by an unseen protection that hovered over him. When\r\nhe reached the house in Paris to which the head-master of the school had\r\nsent him, he found a dainty little apartment prepared for his reception.\r\nUnder the glass shade of the clock was a large envelope addressed to\r\nhim, so placed as to strike his eye the moment that he entered the\r\nroom. In that envelope was a note, written in pencil, containing these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n  The day after your arrival in Paris go at eight in the morning\r\n  punctually to the garden of the Luxembourg, Allee de\r\n  l’Observatoire, fourth bench to the right, starting from the gate.\r\n  This order is strict. Do not fail to obey it.\r\n\r\nPunctual to the minute, Dorlange was not long at the place of rendezvous\r\nbefore he was met by a very small man, whose enormous head, bearing an\r\nimmense shock of hair, together with a pointed nose, chin, and crooked\r\nlegs made him seem like a being escaped from one of Hoffman’s tales.\r\nWithout saying a word, for to his other physical advantages this weird\r\nmessenger added that of being deaf and dumb, he placed in the young\r\nman’s hand a letter and a purse. The letter said that the family of\r\nDorlange were glad to see that he wished to devote himself to art. They\r\nurged him to work bravely and to profit by the instructions of the great\r\nmaster under whose direction he was placed. They hoped he would live\r\nvirtuously; and, in any case, an eye would be kept upon his conduct.\r\nThere was no desire, the letter went on to say, that he should be\r\ndeprived of the respectable amusements of his age. For his needs and\r\nfor his pleasures, he might count upon the sum of six hundred and fifty\r\nfrancs every three months, which would be given to him in the same place\r\nby the same man; but he was expressly forbidden to follow the messenger\r\nafter he had fulfilled his commission; if this injunction were directly\r\nor indirectly disobeyed, the punishment would be severe; it would be\r\nnothing less than the withdrawal of the stipend and, possibly, total\r\nabandonment.\r\n\r\nDo you remember, my dear Madame de Camps, that in 1831 you and I went\r\ntogether to the Beaux-Arts to see the exhibition of works which were\r\ncompeting for the Grand Prix in sculpture? The subject given out for\r\ncompetition was Niobe weeping for her children. Do you also remember my\r\nindignation at one of the competing works around which the crowd was so\r\ncompact that we could scarcely approach it? The insolent youth had dared\r\nto turn that sacred subject into jest! His Niobe was infinitely touching\r\nin her beauty and grief, but to represent her children, as he did,\r\nby monkeys squirming on the ground in the most varied and grotesque\r\nattitudes, what a deplorable abuse of talent--!\r\n\r\nYou tried in vain to make me see that the monkeys were enchantingly\r\ngraceful and clever, and that a mother’s blind idolatry could not be\r\nmore ingeniously ridiculed; I held to the opinion that the conception\r\nwas monstrous, and the indignation of the old academicians who demanded\r\nthe expulsion of this intolerable work, seemed to me most justifiable.\r\nBut the Academy, instigated by the public and by the newspapers, which\r\ntalked of opening a subscription to send the young sculptor to Rome,\r\nwere not of my opinion and that of their older members. The extreme\r\nbeauty of the Niobe atoned for all the rest and the defamer of mothers\r\nsaw his work crowned, in spite of an admonition given to him by the\r\nvenerable secretary on the day of the distribution of the prizes.\r\nBut, poor fellow! I excuse him, for I now learn that he never knew his\r\nmother. It was Dorlange, the poor abandoned child at Tours, the friend\r\nof Marie-Gaston.\r\n\r\nFrom 1827 to 1831 the two friends were inseparable. Dorlange, regularly\r\nsupplied with means, was a sort of Marquis d’Aligre; Gaston, on the\r\ncontrary, was reduced to his own resources for a living, and would have\r\nlived a life of extreme poverty had it not been for his friend. But\r\nwhere friends love each other--and the situation is more rare\r\nthan people imagine--all on one side and nothing on the other is a\r\ndetermining cause for association. So, without any reckoning between\r\nthem, our two pigeons held in common their purse, their earnings, their\r\npains, pleasures, hopes, in fact, they held all things in common, and\r\nlived but one life between the two. This state of things lasted till\r\nDorlange had won the Grand Prix, and started for Rome. Henceforth\r\ncommunity of interests was no longer possible. But Dorlange, still\r\nreceiving an ample income through his mysterious dwarf, bethought\r\nhimself of making over to Gaston the fifteen hundred francs paid to him\r\nby the government for the “prix de Rome.” But a good heart in receiving\r\nis more rare than the good heart that gives. His mind being ulcerated\r\nby constant misfortune Marie-Gaston refused, peremptorily, what pride\r\ninsisted on calling _alms_. Work, he said, had been provided for him by\r\nDaniel d’Arthez, one of our greatest writers, and the payment for that,\r\nadded to his own small means, sufficed him. This proud rejection, not\r\nproperly understood by Dorlange, produced a slight coolness between\r\nthe two friends; nevertheless, until the year 1833, their intimacy\r\nwas maintained by a constant exchange of letters. But here, on\r\nMarie-Gaston’s side, perfect confidence ceased, after a time, to exist.\r\nHe was hiding something; his proud determination to depend wholly on\r\nhimself was a sad mistake. Each day brought him nearer to penury. At\r\nlast, staking all upon one throw, he imprudently involved himself in\r\njournalism. Assuming all the risks of an enterprise which amounted to\r\nthirty thousand francs, a stroke of ill-fortune left him nothing to look\r\nforward to but a debtor’s prison, which yawned before him.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that his meeting with Louise de Chaulieu\r\ntook place. During the nine months that preceded their marriage,\r\nMarie-Gaston’s letters to his friend became fewer and far-between.\r\nDorlange ought surely to have been the first to know of this change in\r\nthe life of his friend, but not one word of it was confided to him.\r\nThis was exacted by the high and mighty lady of Gaston’s love, Louise de\r\nChaulieu, Baronne de Macumer.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for the marriage came, Madame de Macumer pushed this mania\r\nfor secrecy to extremes. I, her nearest and dearest friend, was scarcely\r\ninformed of the event, and no one was admitted to the ceremony\r\nexcept the witnesses required by law. Dorlange was still absent. The\r\ncorrespondence between them ceased, and if Marie-Gaston had entered the\r\nconvent of La Trappe, he could not have been more completely lost to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorlange returned from Rome in 1836, the sequestration of\r\nMarie-Gaston’s person and affection was more than ever close and\r\ninexorable. Dorlange had too much self-respect to endeavor to pass the\r\nbarriers thus opposed to him, and the old friends not only never saw\r\neach other, but no communication passed between them.\r\n\r\nBut when the news of Madame Marie-Gaston’s death reached him Dorlange\r\nforgot all and hastened to Ville d’Avray to comfort his friend. Useless\r\neagerness! Two hours after that sad funeral was over, Marie-Gaston,\r\nwithout a thought for his friends or for a sister-in-law and two nephews\r\nwho were dependent on him, flung himself into a post-chaise and started\r\nfor Italy. Dorlange felt that this egotism of sorrow filled the measure\r\nof the wrong already done to him; and he endeavored to efface from\r\nhis heart even the recollection of a friendship which sympathy under\r\nmisfortune could not recall.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I loved Louise de Chaulieu too tenderly not to continue\r\nour affection for the man who had been so much to her. Before leaving\r\nFrance, Marie-Gaston had requested Monsieur de l’Estorade to take charge\r\nof his affairs, and later he sent him a power-of-attorney to enable him\r\nto do so properly.\r\n\r\nSome weeks ago his grief, still living and active, suggested to him a\r\nsingular idea. In the midst of the beautiful park at Ville d’Avray is a\r\nlittle lake, with an island upon it which Louise dearly loved. To that\r\nisland, a shady calm retreat, Marie-Gaston wished to remove the body of\r\nhis wife, after building a mausoleum of Carrara marble to receive it. He\r\nwrote to us to communicate this idea, and, remembering Dorlange in this\r\nconnection, he requested my husband to see him and ask him to undertake\r\nthe work. At first Dorlange feigned not to remember even the name of\r\nMarie-Gaston, and he made some civil pretext to decline the commission.\r\nBut see and admire the consistency of such determinations when people\r\nlove each other! That very evening, being at the opera, he heard the\r\nDuc de Rhetore speak insultingly of his former friend, and he vehemently\r\nresented the duke’s words. A duel followed in which he was wounded; the\r\nnews of this affair has probably already reached you. So here is a man\r\nfacing death at night for a friend whose very name he pretended not to\r\nknow in the morning!\r\n\r\nYou will ask, my dear Madame de Camps, what this long tale has to do\r\nwith my own ridiculous adventure. That is what I would tell you now if\r\nmy letter were not so immoderately long. I told you my tale would prove\r\nto be a feuilleton-story, and I think the moment has come to make the\r\ncustomary break in it. I hope I have not sufficiently exalted your\r\ncuriosity to have the right not to satisfy it. To be concluded,\r\ntherefore, whether you like it or not, in the following number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nParis, March, 1839.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the long biographical dissertation I lately sent you,\r\nmy dear friend, were taken chiefly from a recent letter from Monsieur\r\nMarie-Gaston. On leaning of the brave devotion shown in his defence his\r\nfirst impulse was to rush to Paris and press the hand of the friend who\r\navenged himself thus nobly for neglect and forgetfulness. Unfortunately\r\nthe evening before his departure he met with a dangerous fall at\r\nSavarezza, one of the outlying quarries of Carrara, and dislocated\r\nhis ankle. Being obliged to postpone his journey, he wrote to Monsieur\r\nDorlange to express his gratitude; and, by the same courier, he sent\r\nme a voluminous letter, relating the whole past of their lifelong\r\nfriendship and asking me to see Monsieur Dorlange and be the mediator\r\nbetween them. He was not satisfied with the expression of his warm\r\ngratitude, he wanted also to show him that in spite of contrary\r\nappearances, he had never ceased to deserve the affection of his early\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nOn receiving Monsieur Gaston’s letter, my first idea was to write to\r\nthe sculptor and ask him to come and see me, but finding that he was not\r\nentirely recovered from his wound, I went, accompanied by my husband and\r\nNais, to the artist’s studio, which we found in a pleasant little house\r\nin the rue de l’Ouest, behind the garden of the Luxembourg, one of the\r\nmost retired quarters of Paris. We were received in the vestibule by a\r\nwoman about whom Monsieur de l’Estorade had already said a word to\r\nme. It appears that the _laureat_ of Rome did not leave Italy without\r\nbringing away with him an agreeable souvenir in the form of a bourgeoise\r\nGalatea, half housekeeper, half model; about whom certain indiscreet\r\nrumors are current. But let me hasten to say that there was absolutely\r\nnothing in her appearance or manner to lead me to credit them. In fact,\r\nthere was something cold and proud and almost savage about her,\r\nwhich is, they tell me, a strong characteristic of the Transteverine\r\npeasant-women. When she announced our names Monsieur Dorlange was\r\nstanding in a rather picturesque working costume with his back to us,\r\nand I noticed that he hastily drew an ample curtain before the statue on\r\nwhich he was engaged.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he turned round, and before I had time to look\r\nat him, imagine my astonishment when Nais ran forward and, with the\r\nartlessness of a child, flung her arms about his neck crying out:--\r\n\r\n“Are! here is my monsieur who saved me!”\r\n\r\nWhat! the monsieur who saved her? Then Monsieur Dorlange must be the\r\nfamous Unknown?--Yes, my dear friend, I now recognized him. Chance, that\r\ncleverest of romance-makers, willed that Monsieur Dorlange and my bore\r\nwere one. Happily, my husband had launched into the expression of his\r\nfeelings as a grateful father; I thus had time to recover myself, and\r\nbefore it became my turn to say a word, I had installed upon my face\r\nwhat you are pleased to call my grand l’Estorade air; under which, as\r\nyou know, I mark twenty-five degrees below zero, and can freeze the\r\nwords on the lips of any presuming person.\r\n\r\nAs for Monsieur Dorlange, he seemed to me less troubled than surprised\r\nby the meeting. Then, as if he thought we kept him too long on the topic\r\nof our gratitude, he abruptly changed the subject.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he said to me, “since we are, as it seems, more acquainted\r\nthan we thought, may I dare to gratify my curiosity?”--\r\n\r\nI fancied I saw the claw of a cat preparing to play with its mouse, so I\r\nanswered, coldly:--\r\n\r\n“Artists, I am told, are often indiscreet in their curiosity.”\r\n\r\nI put a well-marked stiffness into my manner which completed the meaning\r\nof the words. I could not see that it baffled him.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” he replied, “that my question is not of that kind. I only\r\ndesire to ask if you have a sister.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur,” I replied, “I have no sister--none, at least, that I\r\nknow of,” I added, jestingly.\r\n\r\n“I thought it not unlikely, however,” continued Monsieur Dorlange, in\r\nthe most natural manner possible; “for the family in which I have met a\r\nlady bearing the strongest resemblance to you is surrounded by a certain\r\nmysterious atmosphere which renders all suppositions possible.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any indiscretion in asking the name of that family?”\r\n\r\n“Not the least; they are people whom you must have known in Paris in\r\n1829-1830. They lived in great state and gave fine parties. I myself met\r\nthem in Italy.”\r\n\r\n“But their name?” I said.\r\n\r\n“De Lanty,” he replied, without embarrassment or hesitation.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, my dear Madame de Camps, a family of that name did live\r\nin Paris about that time, and you probably remember, as I do, that many\r\nstrange stories were told about them. As Monsieur Dorlange answered my\r\nquestion he turned back towards his veiled statue.\r\n\r\n“The sister whom you have not, madame,” he said to me abruptly, “I shall\r\npermit myself to give you, and I venture to hope that you will see a\r\ncertain family likeness in her.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he removed the cloth that concealed his work, and there _I_\r\nstood, under the form of a saint, with a halo round my head. Could I be\r\nangry at the liberty thus taken?\r\n\r\nMy husband and Nais gave a cry of admiration at the wonderful likeness\r\nthey had before their eyes. As for Monsieur Dorlange, he at once\r\nexplained the cause of his scenic effect.\r\n\r\n“This statue,” he said, “is a Saint-Ursula, ordered by a convent in the\r\nprovinces. Under circumstances which it would take too long to relate,\r\nthe type of this saint, the person whom I mentioned just now, was firmly\r\nfixed in my memory. I should vainly have attempted to create by my\r\nimagination another type for that saint, it could not have been so\r\ncompletely the expression of my thought. I therefore began to model this\r\nfigure which you see from memory, then one day, madame, at Saint-Thomas\r\nd’Aquin, I saw you, and I had the superstition to believe that you were\r\nsent to me by Providence. After that, I worked from you only, and as\r\nI did not feel at liberty to ask you to come to my studio, the best I\r\ncould do was to study you when we met, and I multiplied my chances of\r\ndoing so. I carefully avoided knowing your name and social position, for\r\nI feared to bring you down from the ideal and materialize you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I have often seen you following us,” said Nais, with her clever\r\nlittle air.\r\n\r\nHow little we know children, and their turn for observation! As for my\r\nhusband, it seemed to me that he ought to have pricked up his ears at\r\nthis tale of the daring manner in which his wife had been used as\r\na model. Monsieur de l’Estorade is certainly no fool; in all social\r\nmatters he has the highest sense of conventional propriety, and as for\r\njealousy, I think if I gave him the slightest occasion he would show\r\nhimself ridiculously jealous. But now, the sight of his “beautiful\r\nRenee,” as he calls me, done into white marble in the form of a saint,\r\nhad evidently cast him into a state of admiring ecstasy. He, with Nais,\r\nwere taking an inventory to prove the fidelity of the likeness--yes, it\r\nwas really my attitude, really my eyes, really my mouth, really those\r\ntwo little dimples in my cheeks!\r\n\r\nI felt it my duty to take up the role that Monsieur de l’Estorade laid\r\naside, so I said, very gravely, to the presuming artist:--\r\n\r\n“Do you not think, monsieur, that to appropriate without permission,\r\nor--not to mince my words--steal a person’s likeness, may seem a very\r\nstrange proceeding?”\r\n\r\n“For that reason, madame,” he replied, in a respectful tone, “I was\r\nfully determined to abide by your wishes in the matter. Although my\r\nstatue is fated to be buried in the oratory of a distant convent,\r\nI should not have sent it to its destination without obtaining your\r\npermission to do so. I could have known your name whenever I wished;\r\nI already knew your address; and I intended, when the time came, to\r\nconfess the liberty I had taken, and ask you to visit my studio. I\r\nshould then have said what I say now: if the likeness displeases you\r\nI can, with a few strokes of my chisel, so change it as to make it\r\nunrecognizable.”\r\n\r\nMy husband, who apparently thought the likeness not sufficiently close,\r\nturned, at this moment, to Monsieur Dorlange, and said, with a delighted\r\nair:--\r\n\r\n“Do you not think, monsieur, that Madame de l’Estorade’s nose is rather\r\nmore delicate than you have made it?”\r\n\r\nAll this _unexpectedness_ so upset me that I felt unfitted to intervene\r\non behalf of Monsieur Marie-Gaston, and I should, I believe, have\r\npleaded his cause very ill if Monsieur Dorlange had not stopped me at\r\nthe first words I said about it.\r\n\r\n“I know, madame,” he said, “all that you can possibly tell me about\r\nmy unfaithful friend. I do not forgive, but I forget my wrong. Things\r\nhaving so come about that I have nearly lost my life for his sake, it\r\nwould certainly be very illogical to keep a grudge against him. Still,\r\nas regards that mausoleum at Ville d’Avray, nothing would induce me to\r\nundertake it. I have already mentioned to Monsieur de l’Estorade one\r\nhindrance that is daily growing more imperative; but besides that, I\r\nthink it a great pity that Marie-Gaston should thus ruminate on his\r\ngrief; and I have written to tell him so. He ought to be more of a\r\nman, and find in study and in work the consolations we can always find\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nThe object of our visit being thus disposed of, I saw no hope of getting\r\nto the bottom of the other mystery it had opened, so I rose to take\r\nleave, and as I did so Monsieur Dorlange said to me:--\r\n\r\n“May I hope that you will not exact the injury I spoke of to my statue?”\r\n\r\n“It is for my husband and not for me to reply to that question,” I said;\r\n“however, we can talk of it later, for Monsieur de l’Estorade hopes that\r\nyou will give us the honor of a visit.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur bowed in respectful acquiescence, and we came away,--I, in\r\ngreat ill-humor; I was angry with Nais, and also with my husband, and\r\nfelt much inclined to make him a scene, which he would certainly not\r\nhave understood.\r\n\r\nNow what do you think of all this? Is the man a clever swindler, who\r\ninvented that fable for some purpose, or is he really an artist, who\r\ntook me in all simplicity of soul for the living realization of his\r\nidea? That is what I intend to find out in the course of a few days, for\r\nnow I am committed to your programme, and to-morrow Monsieur and Madame\r\nde l’Estorade will have the honor of inviting Monsieur Dorlange to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nParis, March, 1839.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend,--Monsieur Dorlange dined with us yesterday. My intention\r\nwas to invite him alone to a formal family dinner, so as to have him\r\nmore completely under my eye, and put him to the question at my ease.\r\nBut Monsieur de l’Estorade, to whom I had not explained my charitable\r\nmotives, showed me that such an invitation might wound the sensibilities\r\nof our guest; it might seem to him that the Comte de l’Estorade thought\r\nthe sculptor Dorlange unfitted for the society of his friends.\r\n\r\n“We can’t,” said my husband gaily, “treat him like the sons of our\r\nfarmers who come here with the epaulet of a lieutenant on their\r\nshoulder, and whom we invite with closed doors because we can’t send\r\nthem to the servants’ hall.”\r\n\r\nWe therefore invited to meet him Monsieur Joseph Bridau, the painter,\r\nthe Chevalier d’Espard, Monsieur and Madame de la Bastie (formerly, you\r\nremember, Mademoiselle Modeste Mignon) and the Marquis de Ronquerolles.\r\nWhen my husband invited the latter, he asked him if he had any objection\r\nto meeting the adversary of the Duc de Rhetore.\r\n\r\n“So far from objecting,” replied Monsieur de Ronquerolles, “I am glad of\r\nthe opportunity to meet a man of talent, who in the affair you speak of\r\nbehaved admirably.” And he added, after my husband had told him of our\r\ngreat obligation to Monsieur Dorlange, “Then he is a true hero, your\r\nsculptor! if he goes on this way, we can’t hold a candle to him.”\r\n\r\nIn his studio, with a bare throat leaving his head, which is rather too\r\nlarge for his body, free, and dressed in a sort of Oriental costume,\r\nMonsieur Dorlange looked to me a great deal better than he does in\r\nregular evening dress. Though I must say that when he grows animated in\r\nspeaking his face lights up, a sort of a magnetic essence flows from his\r\neyes which I had already noticed in our preceding encounters. Madame de\r\nla Bastie was as much struck as I was by this peculiarity.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if I told you that the ambition of Monsieur Dorlange is to\r\nbe returned to the Chamber at the coming elections. This was the reason\r\nhe gave for declining Monsieur Gaston’s commission. What Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade and I thought, at first, to be a mere excuse was an actual\r\nreason. At table when Monsieur Joseph Bridau asked him point-blank what\r\nbelief was to be given to the report of his parliamentary intentions,\r\nMonsieur Dorlange formally announced them; from that moment, throughout\r\nthe dinner, the talk was exclusively on politics.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to topics foreign to his studies, I expected to find our\r\nartist, if not a novice, at least very slightly informed. Not at all.\r\nOn men, on things, on the past as on the future of parties, he had very\r\nclear and really novel views, which were evidently not borrowed from the\r\nnewspapers; and he put them forth in lively, easy, and elegant language;\r\nso that after his departure Monsieur de Ronquerolles and Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade declared themselves positively surprised at the strong and\r\npowerful political attitude he had taken. This admission was all the\r\nmore remarkable because, as you know, the two gentlemen are zealous\r\nconservatives, whereas Monsieur Dorlange inclines in a marked degree to\r\ndemocratic principles.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected superiority in my problematical follower reassured\r\nme not a little; still, I was resolved to get to the bottom of the\r\nsituation, and therefore, after dinner I drew him into one of those\r\ntete-a-tetes which the mistress of a house can always bring about.\r\n\r\nAfter talking awhile about Monsieur Marie-Gaston, our mutual friend, the\r\nenthusiasms of my dear Louise and my efforts to moderate them, I asked\r\nhim how soon he intended to send his Saint-Ursula to her destination.\r\n\r\n“Everything is ready for her departure,” he replied, “but I want your\r\n_exeat_, madame; will you kindly tell me if you desire me to change her\r\nexpression?”\r\n\r\n“One question in the first place,” I replied: “Will your work suffer by\r\nsuch a change, supposing that I desire it?”\r\n\r\n“Probably. If you cut the wings of a bird you hinder its flight.”\r\n\r\n“Another question: Is it I, or the _other person_ whom the statue best\r\nrepresents?”\r\n\r\n“You, madame; that goes without saying, for you are the present, she the\r\npast.”\r\n\r\n“But, to desert the past for the present is a bad thing and goes by a\r\nbad name, monsieur; and yet you proclaim it with a very easy air.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Monsieur Dorlange, laughing, “but art is ferocious;\r\nwherever it sees material for its creations, it pounces upon it\r\ndesperately.”\r\n\r\n“Art,” I replied, “is a great word under which a multitude of things\r\nshelter themselves. The other day you told me that circumstances, too\r\nlong to relate at that moment, had contributed to fix the image of which\r\nI was the reflection in your mind, where it has left a vivid memory; was\r\nnot that enough to excite my curiosity?”\r\n\r\n“It was true, madame, that time did not allow of my making an\r\nexplanation of those circumstances; but, in any case, having the honor\r\nof speaking to you for the first time, it would have been strange, would\r\nit not, had I ventured to make you any confidences?”\r\n\r\n“Well, but now?” I said, boldly.\r\n\r\n“Now, unless I receive more express encouragement, I am still unable to\r\nsuppose that anything in my past can interest you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Some acquaintances ripen fast. Your devotion to my Nais\r\nhas advanced our friendship rapidly. Besides,” I added, with affected\r\nlevity, “I am passionately fond of stories.”\r\n\r\n“But mine has no conclusion to it; it is an enigma even to myself.”\r\n\r\n“All the better; perhaps between us we might find the key to it.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Dorlange appeared to take counsel with himself; then, after a\r\nshort pause he said:--\r\n\r\n“It is true that women are admirably fitted to seize the lighter shades\r\nof meaning in acts and sentiments which we men are unable to decipher.\r\nBut this confidence does not concern myself alone; I should have to\r\nrequest that it remain absolutely between ourselves, not even excepting\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade from this restriction. A secret is never safe\r\nbeyond the person who confides it, and the person who hears it.”\r\n\r\nI was much puzzled, as you can well suppose, about what might follow;\r\nstill, continuing my explorations, I replied:--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de l’Estorade is so little in the habit of hearing everything\r\nfrom me, that he never even read a line of my correspondence with Madame\r\nMarie-Gaston.”\r\n\r\nUntil then, Monsieur Dorlange had stood before the fireplace, at one\r\ncorner of which I was seated; but he now took a chair beside me and\r\nsaid, by way of preamble:--\r\n\r\n“I mentioned to you, madame, the family of Lanty--”\r\n\r\nAt that instant--provoking as rain in the midst of a picnic--Madame de\r\nla Bastie came up to ask me if I had been to see Nathan’s last drama.\r\nMonsieur Dorlange was forced to give up his seat beside me, and no\r\nfurther opportunity for renewing the conversation occurred during the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nI have really, as you see now, no light upon the matter, and yet when\r\nI recall the whole manner and behavior of Monsieur Dorlange, whom I\r\nstudied carefully, my opinion inclines to his perfect innocence. Nothing\r\nproves that the love I suspected plays any part in this curious affair;\r\nand I will allow you to think that I and my terrors, with which I\r\ntormented you, were terribly absurd,--in short, that I have played the\r\npart of Belise in the _Femmes Savantes_, who fancies that every man she\r\nsees is fatally in love with her.\r\n\r\nI therefore cheerfully abandon that stupid conclusion. Lover or not,\r\nMonsieur Dorlange is a man of high character, with rare distinction of\r\nmind; and if, as I believe now, he has no misplaced pretensions, it is\r\nan honor and pleasure to count him among our friends. Nais is enchanted\r\nwith her preserver. After he left us that evening, she said to me, with\r\nan amusing little air of approbation,--\r\n\r\n“Mamma, how well Monsieur Dorlange talks.”\r\n\r\nApropos of Nais, here is one of her remarks:--\r\n\r\n“When he stopped the horses, mamma, and you did not seem to notice him,\r\nI thought he was only a man.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean,--only a man?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes! one of those persons to whom one pays no attention. But, oh!\r\nI was so glad when I found out he was a monsieur. Didn’t you hear me cry\r\nout, ‘Ah! you are the monsieur who saved me’?”\r\n\r\nThough her innocence is perfect, there was such pride and vanity in this\r\nlittle speech that I gave her, as you may well suppose, a lecture upon\r\nit. This distinction of man and monsieur is dreadful; but, after all,\r\nthe child told the truth. She only said, with her blunt simplicity, what\r\nour democratic customs still allow us to put in practice, though they\r\nforbid us to put it into words. The Revolution of ‘89 has at least\r\nintroduced that virtuous hypocrisy into our social system.\r\n\r\nBut I refrain from politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nApril, 1839.\r\n\r\nFor the last two weeks we have heard nothing more of Monsieur Dorlange.\r\nNot only has he not seen fit to renew the conversation so provokingly\r\ninterrupted by Madame de la Bastie, but he has not even remembered that\r\nit was proper to leave his card at the house after a dinner.\r\n\r\nWhile we were breakfasting yesterday morning, I happened to make this\r\nremark (though without any sharpness), and just then our Lucas, who, as\r\nan old servant, sometimes allows himself a little familiarity, had the\r\ndoor swung triumphantly open to admit him, bearing _something_, I knew\r\nnot what, wrapped in tissue paper, which he deposited with great care on\r\nthe table, giving a note to Monsieur de l’Estorade at the same time.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” I said to Lucas, on whose face I detected the signs of\r\na “surprise,” at the same time putting out my hand to uncover the\r\nmysterious article.\r\n\r\n“Oh! madame must be careful!” cried Lucas; “it is fragile.”\r\n\r\nDuring this time my husband had read the note, which he now passed to\r\nme, saying:--\r\n\r\n“Read it. Monsieur Dorlange sends us an excuse.”\r\n\r\nThe note said:--\r\n\r\n  Monsieur le Comte,--I think I observed that Madame la comtesse\r\n  granted me rather reluctantly her permission to profit by the\r\n  audacious larceny I committed at her expense. I have, therefore,\r\n  taken upon myself to change the character of my statue, and, at\r\n  the present moment, the _two sisters_ no longer resemble each\r\n  other. Nevertheless, as I did not wish that _all_ should be lost\r\n  to the world, I modelled the head of Saint-Ursula before\r\n  retouching it. From that model I have now made a reduction, which\r\n  I place upon the charming shoulders of a countess not yet\r\n  canonized, thank God! The mould was broken as soon as the one\r\n  cast, which I have now the honor of sending you, was made. This\r\n  fact may, perhaps, give some little additional value to the bust\r\n  in your eyes.\r\n\r\n  Accept, Monsieur le comte, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhile I was reading the note, my husband, Lucas, Rene, and Nais had\r\neagerly extracted me from my swathings, and then, in truth, I appeared\r\nno longer a saint, but a woman of the world. I really thought my husband\r\nand children would go out of their minds with admiration and pleasure.\r\nThe news of this masterpiece spread about the house, and all our\r\nservants, whom we rather spoil, came flocking, one after another, as\r\nif sent for, crying out, “Oh, it is madame’s own self!” I alone did not\r\nshare in the general enthusiasm. As for Monsieur de l’Estorade, after\r\nworking for an hour to find a place in his study where the bust could be\r\nseen in its best light, he came in to say to me:--\r\n\r\n“On my way to the Treasury to-day I shall go and see Monsieur Dorlange,\r\nand if he is at liberty this evening I shall ask him to dine with us.\r\nTo-day is Armand’s half-holiday, and I would like him to see the boy.\r\nThe assembled family can then thank him for his gift.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Dorlange accepted the invitation. At dinner Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade inquired further about his candidacy, giving it however, no\r\napproval. This led straight to politics. Armand, whose mind is naturally\r\ngrave and reflective and who reads the newspapers, mingled in the\r\nconversation. Against the practice of youths of the present day, he\r\nthinks like his father; that is, he is very conservative; though perhaps\r\nless just and wise, as might well be expected in a lad of fifteen. He\r\nwas consequently led to contradict Monsieur Dorlange, whose inclination\r\nas I told you, is somewhat jacobin. And I must say I thought the\r\narguments of my little man neither bad nor ill-expressed. Without\r\nceasing to be polite, Monsieur Dorlange had an air of disdaining a\r\ndiscussion with the poor boy, so much so that I saw Armand on the point\r\nof losing patience and replying sharply. However, as he has been well\r\nbrought up, I had only to make him a sign and he controlled himself; but\r\nseeing him turn scarlet and shut himself up in gloomy silence, I felt\r\nthat his pride had received a blow, and I thought it little generous in\r\nMonsieur Dorlange to crush a young lad in that way.\r\n\r\nI know very well that children in these days make the mistake of wishing\r\nto be personages before their time, and that it often does them good\r\nto suppress such conceit. But really, Armand has an intellectual\r\ndevelopment and a power of reasoning beyond his age. Do you want a proof\r\nof it? Until last year, I had never consented to part with him, and it\r\nwas only as a day scholar that he followed his course of study at the\r\nCollege Henri IV. Well, he himself, for the sake of his studies, which\r\nwere hindered by going and coming to and fro, asked to be placed in\r\nthe regular manner in the school; and he employed more entreaties and\r\narguments with me to put him under that discipline than an ordinary boy\r\nwould have used to escape it. Therefore this manly air and manner, which\r\nin most schoolboys would, of course, be intolerably ridiculous, seems in\r\nhim the result of his natural precocity; and this precocity ought to be\r\nforgiven him, inasmuch as it comes to him from God.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of his unfortunate birth Monsieur Dorlange is less fitted\r\nthan most men to judge of children in their homes, and he therefore,\r\nnecessarily, shows a want of indulgence. But he had better take care; if\r\nhe wishes to pay court to me merely as a friend he has chosen a very bad\r\nmethod of doing so.\r\n\r\nOf course an evening in the midst of the family did not allow of his\r\nreturning to the subject of his private history; but I thought he did\r\nnot show any particular desire to do so. In fact, he occupied himself\r\nmuch more with Nais than with me, cutting out silhouettes in black paper\r\nfor her during nearly the whole evening. I must also mention that Madame\r\nde Rastignac came in and I, on my side, was obliged to give my company\r\nto her. While we were conversing near the fire, Monsieur Dorlange at\r\nthe other end of the room was posing the two children Nais and Rene, who\r\npresently brought me their likenesses snipped out with scissors, Nais\r\nwhispering triumphantly in my ear:--\r\n\r\n“You don’t know; but Monsieur Dorlange is going to make my bust in\r\nmarble.”\r\n\r\nSince this family dinner, civil war has been declared among my children.\r\nNais extols to the skies her “dear preserver,” as she calls him, and is\r\nsupported in her opinion by Rene, who is delivered over to the sculptor\r\nbody and soul in return for a superb lancer on horseback which Monsieur\r\nDorlange cut out for him. Armand, on the contrary, thinks him ugly,\r\nwhich is undeniable; he says he resembles the portraits of Danton which\r\nhe has seen in the illustrated histories of the Revolution, in which\r\nremark there is some truth. He says also that Monsieur Dorlange has\r\ngiven me in my bust the air of a grisette, which is not true at all.\r\nHence, disputes among my darlings which are endless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. DORLANGE TO MARIE-GASTON\r\n\r\nParis, April, 1839.\r\n\r\nWhy do I desert my art, and what do I intend to do in this cursed galley\r\nof politics? This shows what it is, my dear romantic friend, to shut\r\none’s self up for years in a conjugal convent. During that time the\r\nworld has progressed. To friends forgotten at the gate life brings\r\nnew combinations; and the more they are ignored, the more disposed the\r\nforgetter is to cast the blame upon those forgotten; it is so easy to\r\npreach to others!\r\n\r\nLearn, then, my dear inquisitor, that I do not enter politics of my own\r\nvolition. In pushing myself in this unexpected manner into the electoral\r\nbreach, I merely follow an inspiration that has been made to me. A\r\nray of light has come into my darkness; a father has partly revealed\r\nhimself, and, if I may believe appearances, he holds a place in\r\nthe world which ought to satisfy the most exacting ambition. This\r\nrevelation, considering the very ordinary course of my life, has come to\r\nme surrounded by fantastic and romantic circumstances which served to be\r\nrelated to you in some detail.\r\n\r\nAs you have lived in Italy, I think it useless to explain to you the\r\nCafe Greco, the usual rendezvous of the pupils of the Academy and\r\nthe artists of all countries who flock to Rome. In Paris, rue de\r\nCoq-Saint-Honore, we have a distant counterpart of that institution in a\r\ncafe long known as that of the Cafe des Arts. Two or three times a week\r\nI spend an evening there, where I meet several of my contemporaries\r\nin the French Academy in Rome. They have introduced me to a number of\r\njournalists and men of letters, all of them amiable and distinguished\r\nmen, with whom there is both profit and pleasure in exchanging ideas.\r\n\r\nIn a certain corner, where we gather, many questions of a nature to\r\ninterest serious minds are debated; but the most eager interest, namely\r\npolitics, takes the lead in our discussions. In this little club the\r\nprevailing opinion is democratic; it is represented under all its\r\naspects, the phalansterian Utopia not excepted. That’s enough to tell\r\nyou that before this tribunal the ways of the government are often\r\njudged with severity, and that the utmost liberty of language reigns in\r\nour discussions. The consequence is that about a year ago the waiter\r\nwho serves us habitually took me aside one day to give me, as he said, a\r\ntimely warning.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he said, “you are watched by the police; and you would do\r\nwell not to talk like Saint Paul, open-mouthed.”\r\n\r\n“The police! my good friend,” I replied, “why the devil should the\r\npolice watch me? What I say, and a good deal else, is printed every\r\nmorning in the newspapers.”\r\n\r\n“No matter for that, they _are_ watching you. I have seen it. There is\r\na little old man, who takes a great deal of snuff, who is always within\r\nhearing distance of you; when you speak he seems to pay more attention\r\nto your words than to those of the others; and once I saw him write\r\nsomething down in a note-book in marks that were not writing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the next time he comes, point him out to me.”\r\n\r\nThe next time proved to be the next day. The person shown to me was a\r\nshort man with gray hair, a rather neglected person and a face deeply\r\npitted with the small-pox, which seemed to make him about fifty years of\r\nage. He frequently dipped in a large snuffbox; and seemed to be giving\r\nto my remarks an attention I might consider either flattering or\r\ninquisitive, as I pleased; but a certain air of gentleness and integrity\r\nin this supposed police-spy inclined me to the kinder interpretation. I\r\nsaid so to the waiter, who had plumed himself on discovering a spy.\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu_!” he replied, “they always put on that honeyed manner to hide\r\ntheir game.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on a Sunday, at the hour of vespers, in one of my\r\nrambles about old Paris--for which, as you know, I always had a taste--I\r\nhappened to enter the church of Saint-Louis-en-l’Ile, the parish church\r\nof the remote quarter of the city which bears that name. This church\r\nis a building of very little interest, no matter what historians and\r\ncertain “Guides to Paris” may say. I should therefore have passed\r\nrapidly through it if the remarkable talent of the organist who was\r\nperforming part of the service had not induced me to remain.\r\n\r\nTo say that the playing of that man realized my ideal is giving it high\r\npraise, for I dare say you will remember that I always distinguished\r\nbetween organ-players and organists, a superior order of nobility the\r\ntitle of which is not to be given unwittingly.\r\n\r\nThe service over, I had a curiosity to see the face of so eminent an\r\nartist buried in that out-of-the-way place. Accordingly I posted myself\r\nnear the door of the organ loft, to see him as he left the church--a\r\nthing I certainly would not have done for a crowned head; but great\r\nartists, after all, are they not kings by divine right?\r\n\r\nImagine my amazement when, after waiting a few minutes, instead of\r\nseeing a totally unknown face I saw that of a man in whom I recognized\r\nmy listener at the Cafe des Arts. But that is not all: behind him came\r\nthe semblance of a human being in whose crooked legs and bushy\r\ntangled hair I recognized by old tri-monthly providence, my banker, my\r\n_money-bringer_,--in a word my worthy friend, the mysterious dwarf.\r\n\r\nI did not escape, myself, his vigilant eye, and I saw him point me out\r\nto the organist with an eager gesture. The latter turned hastily to\r\nlook at me and then, without further demonstration, continued his way.\r\nMeanwhile the bandy-legged creature went up familiarly to the giver of\r\nholy-water and offered him a pinch of snuff; then without paying any\r\nfurther attention to me, he limped to a low door at the side of the\r\nchurch and disappeared. The evident pains this deformed being had taken\r\nto fix the organist’s attention upon me seemed to me a revelation.\r\nEvidently, the _maestro_ knew of the singular manner by which my\r\nquarterly stipend had reached me; which stipend, I should tell you, had\r\nbeen regularly continued until my orders for work so increased as to put\r\nme beyond all necessity. It was not improbable therefore that this man,\r\nwho listened to me at the Cafe des Arts, was the repository of other\r\nsecrets relating to my early life; and I became most eager to obtain an\r\nexplanation from him; all the more because, as I was now living on\r\nmy own resources, my curiosity could not be punished, as formerly\r\nthreatened, by the withdrawal of my subsidy.\r\n\r\nMaking my decision quickly, I followed the organist at once; but by the\r\ntime I reached the door of the church he was out of sight. However, my\r\nluck prompted me to follow the direction he had taken, and as I reached\r\nthe quai de Bethune I saw him to my great joy rapping at the door of\r\na house. Entering resolutely after him, I asked the porter for the\r\norganist of Saint-Louis-de-l’Ile.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Jacques Bricheteau?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Monsieur Jacques Bricheteau; he lives here I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Fourth floor above the entresol, door to the left. He has just come in,\r\nand you can overtake him on the stairs.”\r\n\r\nRapidly as I ran up, my man had the key of his door already in the lock\r\nwhen I reached him.\r\n\r\n“Have I the honor of speaking to Monsieur Jacques Bricheteau?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know any such person,” he replied with effrontery, unlocking his\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I pronounce the name incorrectly; I mean the organist of\r\nSaint-Louis-de-l’Ile.”\r\n\r\n“I have never heard of any organist in this house.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, monsieur, there is one, for the concierge has just told me\r\nso. Besides I saw you leave the organ loft of that church followed by an\r\nindividual who--”\r\n\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence this singular individual cut short our\r\ninterview by entering his apartment and locking the door behind him. For\r\na moment I thought that I must have been mistaken; but on reflection\r\nI saw that a mistake was impossible. I had to do with a man who, for\r\nyears, had proved his unremitting discretion. No, he was obstinately\r\nbent on avoiding me; I was not mistaken in recognizing him.\r\n\r\nI then began to pull the bell vigorously, being quite resolved to get\r\nsome answer at least to my demand. For some little time the besieged\r\ntook the racket I made patiently; then, all of a sudden, I noticed that\r\nthe bell had ceased to ring. Evidently, the wire was disconnected; the\r\nbesieged was secure, unless I kicked in the door; but that of course,\r\nwas not altogether the thing to do.\r\n\r\nI returned to the porter and, without giving the reasons for my\r\ndiscomfiture, I told him about it. In that way I won his confidence\r\nand so obtained some little information about the impenetrable Monsieur\r\nJacques Bricheteau. Though readily given, this information did not\r\nenlighten me at all as to the actual situation. Bricheteau was said\r\nto be a quiet lodger, civil, but not communicative; though punctual in\r\npaying his rent, his means seemed small; he kept no servant and took his\r\nmeals out of the house. Going out every morning before ten o’clock,\r\nhe seldom came in before night; the inference was that he was either a\r\nclerk in some office, or that he gave music lessons in private houses.\r\n\r\nOne detail alone in the midst of this vague and useless information was\r\nof interest. For the last few months Monsieur Jacques Bricheteau had\r\nreceived a voluminous number of letters the postage on which indicated\r\nthat they came from foreign parts; but, in spite of his desires,\r\nthe worthy concierge had never, he said, been able to decipher the\r\npost-mark. Thus this detail, which might have been very useful to me\r\nbecame for the moment absolutely worthless.\r\n\r\nI returned home, persuading myself that a pathetic letter addressed to\r\nthe refractory Bricheteau would induce him to receive me. Mingling with\r\nmy entreaties the touch of a threat, I let him know that I was firmly\r\nresolved at all costs to get to the bottom of the mystery which weighed\r\nupon my life; the secret of which he evidently knew. The next morning,\r\nbefore nine o’clock, I went to his house, only to learn that after\r\npaying the rent to the end of his term, he had packed up his furniture\r\nand left the house in the early morning, without the porter being able\r\nto discover from the men who removed his property (well-paid to keep\r\nsilence, no doubt) where they were ordered to carry it. These men being\r\nstrangers in the quarter, it was quite impossible to discover them\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nI felt, however, that I still had a clue to him, through the organ at\r\nSaint-Louis, and the following Sunday after high mass I posted myself\r\nas before at the door of the organ loft, determined not to let go of\r\nthe sphinx until I had made him speak. But here again, disappointment!\r\nMonsieur Jacques Bricheteau’s place was taken by a pupil. The same thing\r\nhappened on the three following Sundays. On the fourth, I accosted the\r\npupil and asked him if the master were ill.\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur,” he replied. “Monsieur Bricheteau has asked for leave of\r\nabsence. He will be absent for some time; I believe on business.”\r\n\r\n“Where, then, can I write to him?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t rightly know; but I think you had better address your letter to\r\nhis house; not far from here, quai de Bethune.”\r\n\r\n“But he has moved; didn’t you know it?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; where does he live now?”\r\n\r\nThis was poor luck; to ask information of a man who asked it of me when\r\nI questioned him. As if to put be quite beside myself while I was making\r\nthese inquiries, I saw that damned dwarf in the distance evidently\r\nlaughing at me.\r\n\r\nHappily for my patience and my curiosity, which, under the pressure of\r\nall this opposition was growing terrible, a certain amount of light was\r\ngiven me. A few days after my last discomfiture, a letter reached me\r\nbearing the post-mark Stockholm, Sweden; which address did not surprise\r\nme because, while in Rome, I had been honored by the friendship of\r\nThorwaldsen, the great Swedish sculptor, and I had often met in his\r\nstudio many of his compatriots. Probably, therefore, this letter\r\nconveyed an order from one of them, sent through Thorwaldsen. But, on\r\nopening the letter what was my amazement, and my emotion, in presence of\r\nits opening words:--\r\n\r\n  Monsieur my Son,--\r\n\r\nThe letter was long. I had no patience to read it until I knew the\r\nname I bore. I turned to the signature; again my disappointment was\r\ncomplete--there was no name!\r\n\r\n  Monsieur my Son,\r\n\r\nsaid my anonymous father,--\r\n\r\n  I do not regret that by your passionate insistence on knowing the\r\n  secret of your birth, you have forced the person who has watched\r\n  over you from childhood to come here to confer with me as to the\r\n  course your vehement and dangerous curiosity requires us to\r\n  pursue.\r\n\r\n  For some time past, I have entertained a thought which I bring to\r\n  maturity to-day; the execution of which could have been more\r\n  satisfactorily settled by word of mouth than it can now be by\r\n  correspondence.\r\n\r\n  Immediately after your birth, which cost your mother’s life, being\r\n  forced to expatriate myself, I made in a foreign country a noble\r\n  fortune, and I occupy in the ministry of that country an eminent\r\n  position. I foresee the moment when, free to restore to you my\r\n  name, I shall also be able to secure to you the inheritance of my\r\n  titles and the position to which I have attained.\r\n\r\n  But, to reach that height, the reputation you have, I am told,\r\n  acquired in art is not a sufficient recommendation. It is my wish\r\n  that you should enter political life; and in that career, under\r\n  the present institutions of France, there are not two ways of\r\n  becoming a man of distinction: you must begin by being made a\r\n  deputy. I know that you are not yet of the legal age, and also\r\n  that you do not possess the property qualification. But, in\r\n  another year you will be thirty years old, and that is just the\r\n  necessary time required by law to be a land-owner before becoming\r\n  a candidate for election.\r\n\r\n  To-morrow, therefore, you can present yourself to Mongenod Bros.,\r\n  bankers, rue de la Victoire. A sum of two hundred and fifty\r\n  thousand francs will be paid to you; this you must immediately\r\n  employ in the purchase of real estate, applying part of the\r\n  surplus to obtain an interest in some newspaper which, when the\r\n  right time comes, will support your candidacy, and the rest in\r\n  another expense I shall presently explain to you.\r\n\r\n  Your political aptitude is guaranteed to me by the person who,\r\n  with a disinterested zeal for which I shall ever be grateful, has\r\n  watched over you since you were abandoned. For some time past he\r\n  has secretly followed you and listened to you, and he is certain\r\n  that you will make yourself a dignified position in the Chamber.\r\n  Your opinions of ardent yet moderate liberalism please me; without\r\n  being aware of it, you have very cleverly played into my game. I\r\n  cannot as yet tell you the place of your probable election. The\r\n  secret power which is preparing for that event is all the more\r\n  certain to succeed because its plans are pursued quietly and for\r\n  the present in the shade. But success will be greatly assisted by\r\n  the execution of a work which I shall now propose to you,\r\n  requesting you to accept its apparent strangeness without surprise\r\n  or comment.\r\n\r\n  For the time being you must continue to be a sculptor, and with\r\n  the talents of which you have already given proofs, I wish you to\r\n  make a statue of Saint-Ursula. That is a subject which does not\r\n  lack either interest or poesy. Saint-Ursula, virgin and martyr,\r\n  was, as is generally believed, a daughter of prince of Great\r\n  Britain. Becoming the abbess of a convent of unmarried women, who\r\n  were called with popular naivete the Eleven Thousand Virgins, she\r\n  was martyred by the Huns in the fifth century; later, she was\r\n  patroness of the order of the Ursulines, to which she gave its\r\n  name, and she was also patroness of the famous house of Sorbonne.\r\n  An able artist like yourself could, it seems to me, make much of\r\n  these details.\r\n\r\n  Without knowing the locality of which you will be made the\r\n  representative, it is expedient that you should from the present\r\n  moment, make known your political opinions and your intention of\r\n  becoming a candidate for election. But I cannot too strongly\r\n  insist on your keeping secret the communication now made to you;\r\n  at any rate as much as your patience will allow. Leave my agent in\r\n  peace, and await the slow and quiet development of the brilliant\r\n  future to which you are destined, without yielding to a curiosity\r\n  which might, I warn you, lead to great disasters.\r\n\r\n  If you refuse to enter my plans, you will take from yourself all\r\n  chance of ever penetrating a mystery which you have shown yourself\r\n  so eager to understand. But I do not admit even the supposition of\r\n  your resistance, and I prefer to believe in your deference to the\r\n  wishes of a father who will regard it as the finest day of his\r\n  life when at last it be granted to him to reveal himself to his\r\n  son.\r\n\r\n  P.S. Your statue, which is intended for a convent of Ursuline\r\n  nuns, must be in white marble. Height: one metre seven hundred and\r\n  six millimetres; in other words, five feet three inches. As it\r\n  will not be placed in a niche, you must carefully finish all sides\r\n  of it. The costs of the work are to be taken out of the two\r\n  hundred and fifty thousand francs mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThis letter chilled and pained me. In the first place, it took from me a\r\nhope long cherished,--that of recovering a mother as loving as yours, of\r\nwhose adorable tenderness, dear friend, you have so often told me. After\r\nall, it was a half-light thrown upon the fogs of my life without even\r\nallowing me to know whether I was or was not the child of a legitimate\r\nmarriage. It also seemed to me that such paternal intimations addressed\r\nto a man of my age were much too despotic and imperious. Was it not\r\na strange proceeding to change my whole life as if I were a boy just\r\nleaving school! At first I employed to myself all the arguments against\r\nthis political vocation which you and my other friends have since\r\naddressed to me. Nevertheless curiosity impelled me to go the\r\nMongenods’; and finding there, sure enough, in actual, living money,\r\nthe two hundred and fifty thousand francs announced to me, I was led to\r\nreason in another way.\r\n\r\nI reflected that a will which began by making such an outlay must have\r\nsomething serious in it. And inasmuch as this mysterious father knew all\r\nand I nothing, it seemed to me that to enter on a struggle with him was\r\nneither reasonable nor opportune. In fact, had I any real repugnance to\r\nthe career suggested to me? No. Political interests have always roused\r\nme to a certain degree; and if my electoral attempt should come to\r\nnothing, I could always return to my art without being more ridiculous\r\nthan the other still-born ambitions which each new legislature produces.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I have bought the necessary piece of property, and\r\nmade myself a shareholder in the “National.” I have also made the\r\nSaint-Ursula, and am now awaiting instructions, which seem to me rather\r\nlong in coming, as to her actual destination. Moreover, I have made\r\nknown my parliamentary ambition, and the fact that I intend to stand in\r\nthe coming elections.\r\n\r\nI need not ask you to preserve the utmost secrecy about my present\r\nconfidence. Discretion is a virtue which you practise, to my knowledge,\r\nin too signal a manner to need any exhorting thereto from me. But I am\r\nwrong, dear friend, in making these unkind allusions to the past, for at\r\nthis moment I am, more perhaps than you know, the obliged party. Partly\r\nout of interest in me, but more because of the general aversion your\r\nbrother-in-law’s extreme haughtiness inspires, the democratic party has\r\nflocked to my door to make inquiries about my wound, and the talk and\r\nexcitement about this duel have served me well; there is no doubt that\r\nmy candidacy has gained much ground. Therefore, I say, a truce to your\r\ngratitude; do you not see how much I owe to you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. DORLANGE TO MARIE-GASTON\r\n\r\nParis, April, 1839.\r\n\r\nDear Friend,--For better or for worse, I continue my candidacy without a\r\nconstituency to elect me. This surprises my friends and worries me, for\r\nit is only a few weeks now to the general election; and if it happens\r\nthat all this mysterious “preparation” comes to nought, a pretty figure\r\nI shall cut in the caricatures of Monsieur Bixiou, of whose malicious\r\nremarks on the subject you lately wrote me.\r\n\r\nOne thing reassures me: it does not seem likely that any one would\r\nhave sown two hundred and fifty thousand francs in my electoral furrow\r\nwithout feeling pretty sure of gathering a harvest. Perhaps, to take\r\na cheerful view of the matter, this very slowness may be considered as\r\nshowing great confidence of success.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, I am kept by this long delay in a state of inaction\r\nwhich weighs upon me. Astride as it were of two existences,--one in\r\nwhich I have not set foot, the other in which my foot still lingers,--I\r\nhave no heart to undertake real work; I am like a traveller who, having\r\narrived before the hour when the diligence starts, does not know what to\r\ndo with his person nor how to spend his time. You will not complain,\r\nI think, that I turn this enforced _far niente_ to the profit of our\r\ncorrespondence; and now that I am thus at leisure, I shall take up\r\ntwo points in your last letter which did not seem to me of sufficient\r\nimportance to pay much attention to at the time: I refer to your warning\r\nthat my parliamentary pretensions did not meet the approval of Monsieur\r\nBixiou; and to your suggestion that I might expose myself to falling in\r\nlove with Madame de l’Estorade--if I were not in love with her\r\nalready. Let us discuss, in the first instance, Monsieur Bixiou’s grand\r\ndisapprobation--just as we used to talk in the olden time of the grand\r\ntreachery of Monsieur de Mirabeau.\r\n\r\nI’ll describe that man to you in a single word. Envy. In Monsieur Bixiou\r\nthere is, unquestionably, the makings of a great artist; but in the\r\neconomy of his existence the belly has annihilated the heart and the\r\nhead, and he is now and forever under the dominion of sensual appetites;\r\nhe is riveted to the condition of a _caricaturist_,--that is to say, to\r\nthe condition of a man who from day to day discounts himself in petty\r\nproducts, regular galley-slave pot-boilers, which, to be sure, give him\r\na lively living, but in themselves are worthless and have no future.\r\nWith talents misused and now impotent, he has in his mind, as he has\r\non his face, that everlasting and despairing _grin_ which human thought\r\ninstinctively attributes to fallen angels. Just as the Spirit of\r\ndarkness attacks, in preference, great saints because they recall to him\r\nmost bitterly the angelic nature from which he has fallen, so Monsieur\r\nBixiou delights to slaver the talents and characters of those who he\r\nsees have courageously refused to squander their strength, sap, and aims\r\nas he has done.\r\n\r\nBut the thing which ought to reassure you somewhat as to the danger of\r\nhis calumny and his slander (for he employs both forms of backbiting) is\r\nthat at the very time when he believes he is making a burlesque autopsy\r\nof me he is actually an obedient puppet whose wire I hold in my hands,\r\nand whom I am making talk as I please. Being convinced that a certain\r\namount of noisy discussion would advance my political career, I\r\nlooked about me for what I may call a public crier. Among these\r\ncircus trumpets, if I could have found one with a sharper tone, a more\r\ndeafening blare than Bixiou’s, I would have chosen it. As it was, I\r\nhave profited by the malevolent curiosity which induces that amiable\r\nlepidopter to insinuate himself into all studios. I confided the whole\r\naffair to him; even to the two hundred and fifty thousand francs (which\r\nI attributed to a lucky stroke at the Bourse), I told him all my plans\r\nof parliamentary conduct, down to the number of the house I have bought\r\nto conform to the requirements of the electoral law. It is all jotted\r\ndown in his notebook.\r\n\r\nThat statement, I think, would somewhat reduce the admiration of\r\nhis hearers in the salon Montcornet did they know of it. As for the\r\npolitical horoscope which he has been so kind as to draw for me, I\r\ncannot honestly say that his astrology is at fault. It is very certain\r\nthat with my intention of following no set of fixed opinions, I must\r\nreach the situation so admirably summed up by the lawyer of Monsieur de\r\nla Palisse, when he exclaimed with burlesque emphasis: “What do you do,\r\ngentlemen, when you place a man in solitude? You isolate him.”\r\n\r\nIsolation will certainly be my lot, and the artist-life, in which a man\r\nlives alone and draws from himself like the Great Creator whose work\r\nhe toils to imitate, has predisposed me to welcome the situation.\r\nBut although, in the beginning especially, it will deprive me of all\r\ninfluence in the lobbies, it may serve me well in the tribune, where I\r\nshall be able to speak with strength and _freedom_. Being bound by no\r\npromises and by no party trammels, nothing will prevent me from being\r\nthe man I am, and expressing, in all their sacred crudity, the ideas\r\nwhich I think sound and just. I know very well that before an audience\r\nplain, honest truth may fail to be contagious or even welcome. But have\r\nyou never remarked that, by using our opportunities wisely, we finally\r\nmeet with days which may be called the festivals of morality and\r\nintelligence, days on which, naturally and almost without effort, the\r\nthought of good triumphs?\r\n\r\nI do not, however, conceal from myself that, although I may reach\r\nto some reputation as an orator, such a course will never lead to\r\na ministry, and that it does not bestow that reputation of being a\r\npractical man to which it is now the fashion to sacrifice so much. But\r\nif at arm’s length in the tribune I have but little influence, I shall\r\nmake my mark at a greater distance. I shall speak as it were from a\r\nwindow, beyond the close and narrow sphere of parliamentary discussion,\r\nand above the level of its petty passions and its petty interests. This\r\nspecies of success appears to meet the views of the mysterious paternal\r\nintentions toward me. What they seem to require is that I shall sound\r\nand resound. From that point of view, i’ faith, politics have a poetic\r\nside which is not out of keeping with my past life.\r\n\r\nNow, to take up your other warning: that of my passion born or to be\r\nborn for Madame de l’Estorade. I quote your most judicious deductions\r\nfor the purpose of answering them fully.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, when you left for Italy, Madame de l’Estorade was, you say, in\r\nthe flower of her beauty; and the queer, audacious persistence which I\r\nhave shown in deriving inspiration from her shows that it has not faded.\r\nHence, if the evil be not already done, you warn me to be on my guard;\r\nfrom the admiration of an artist to the adoration of the man there is\r\nbut a step, and the history of the late Pygmalion is commended to my\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, learned doctor and mythologian, allow me this\r\nremark. Being on the spot and therefore much better placed than you\r\nto judge of the dangers of the situation, I can assure you that the\r\nprincipal person concerned does not appear to feel the least anxiety.\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade quarrels with me for one thing only: he thinks my\r\nvisits too few, and my reserve misanthropy.\r\n\r\n_Parbleu_! I hear you say, a husband is always the last to know that\r\nhis wife is being courted. So be it. But the high renown of Madame de\r\nl’Estorade’s virtue, her cold and rather calculating good sense, which\r\noften served to balance the ardent and passionate impetuosity of one you\r\nknew well,--what of that? And will you not grant that motherhood as it\r\nappears in that lady--pushed to a degree of fervor which I might almost\r\ncall fanaticism--would be to her an infallible preservative?\r\n\r\nSo much for her. But it is not, I see, for her tranquillity, it is mine\r\nfor which your friendship is concerned; if Pygmalion had not succeeded\r\nin giving life to his statue, a pretty life his love would have made\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nTo your charitable solicitude I must answer, (1) by asserting my\r\nprinciples (though the word and the thing are utterly out of date); (2)\r\nby a certain stupid respect that I feel for conjugal loyalty; (3) by the\r\nnatural preoccupation which the serious public enterprise I am about to\r\nundertake must necessarily give to my mind and imagination. I must also\r\ntell you that I belong, if not by spiritual height, at least by all the\r\ntendencies of my mind and character, to that strong and serious school\r\nof artists of another age who, finding that art is long and life is\r\nshort--_ars longa et vita brevis_--did not commit the mistake of wasting\r\ntheir time and lessening their powers of creation by silly and insipid\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\nBut I have a better reason still to offer you. As Monsieur de l’Estorade\r\nhas told you of the really romantic incidents of my first meeting with\r\nhis wife, you know already that a _memory_ was the cause of my studying\r\nher as a model. Well, that memory, while it attracted me to the\r\nbeautiful countess, is the strongest of all reasons to keep me from\r\nher. This appears to you, I am sure, sufficiently enigmatical and\r\nfar-fetched; but wait till I explain it.\r\n\r\nIf you had not thought proper to break the thread of our intercourse, I\r\nshould not to-day be obliged to take up the arrears of our confidence;\r\nas it is, my dear boy, you must now take your part in my past history\r\nand listen to me bravely.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, the last year of my stay in Rome, I became quite intimate with\r\na comrade in the Academy named Desroziers. He was a musician and a man\r\nof distinguished and very observing mind, who would probably have gone\r\nfar in his art if malarial fever had not put an end to him the following\r\nyear. Suddenly the idea took possession of us to go to Sicily, one of\r\nthe excursions permitted by the rules of the school; but as we were\r\nradically “dry,” as they say, we walked about Rome for some time\r\nendeavoring to find some means of recruiting our finances. On one of\r\nthese occasions we happened to pass before the Palazzo Braschi. Its\r\nwide-open doors gave access to the passing and repassing of a crowd of\r\npersons of all sorts.\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu_!” exclaimed Desroziers, “here’s the very thing for us.”\r\n\r\nAnd without explaining his words or where he was taking me, he made me\r\nfollow the crowd and enter the palace.\r\n\r\nAfter mounting a magnificent marble staircase and crossing a very long\r\nsuite of apartments rather poorly furnished,--which is customary in\r\nItalian palaces, all their luxury being put into ceilings, statues,\r\npaintings, and other objects of art,--we reached a room that was wholly\r\nhung with black and lighted by quantities of tapers. It was, of course,\r\na _chambre-ardente_. In the middle of it on a raised platform surmounted\r\nby a baldaquin, lay a _thing_, the most hideous and grotesque thing you\r\ncan possibly conceive. Imagine a little old man whose hands and face had\r\nreached such a stage of emaciation that a mummy would have seemed to you\r\nin comparison plump and comely.\r\n\r\nClothed in black satin breeches, a violet velvet coat cut _a la\r\nFrancaise_, a white waistcoat embroidered in gold, from which issued\r\nan enormous shirt-frill of point d’Angleterre, this skeleton had cheeks\r\ncovered with a thick layer of rouge which heightened still further the\r\nparchment tones of the rest of his skin. Upon his head was a blond wig\r\nfrizzed into innumerable little curls, surmounted by an immense plumed\r\nhat jauntily perched to one side in a manner which irresistibly provoked\r\nthe laughter of even the most respectful visitors.\r\n\r\nAfter one glance given to this ridiculous and lamentable exhibition,--an\r\nobligatory part of all funerals, according to the etiquette of the Roman\r\naristocracy,--Desroziers exclaimed: “There’s the end; now come and see\r\nthe beginning.”\r\n\r\nNot replying to any of my questions, because he was arranging a dramatic\r\neffect, he took me to the Albani gallery and placed me before a statue\r\nrepresenting Adonis stretched on a lion’s skin.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of that?” he said.\r\n\r\n“What?” I replied at a first glance; “why, it is as fine as an antique.”\r\n\r\n“Antique as much as I am!” replied Desroziers. “It is a portrait in\r\nyouth of that wizened old being we have just seen dead.”\r\n\r\n“Antique or not, it is a masterpiece,” I said. “But how is all this\r\nbeauty, or its hideous caricature, to get us to Sicily? That is the\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you,” replied Desroziers. “I know the family of that old\r\nscarecrow. His niece married the Comte de Lanty, and they have long\r\nwanted to buy this statue which the Albani museum won’t give up at any\r\nprice. They have tried to have it copied, but they never got anything\r\nsatisfactory. Now, you know the director of the museum well. Get him to\r\nlet you make a copy of it. I give music-lessons to the Comte de Lanty’s\r\ndaughter, Mademoiselle Marianina, and I’ll talk of your copy. If you\r\nsucceed, as of course you will, the count will buy it and pay you forty\r\ntimes the cost of a trip to Sicily.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later I began the work, and, as it suited my taste, I worked so\r\nhotly at it that by the end of three weeks the Lanty family, escorted\r\nby Desroziers, came to see my copy. The count, who seemed to me a good\r\nconnoisseur, declared himself satisfied with the work and bought\r\nit. Mademoiselle Marianina, who was the heiress and favorite of her\r\ngrand-uncle, was particularly delighted with it. Marianina was then\r\nabout twenty-one years old, and I shall not make you her portrait\r\nbecause you know Madame de l’Estorade, to whom her likeness is\r\nextraordinary. Already an accomplished musician, this charming girl had\r\na remarkable inclination for all the arts. Coming from time to time to\r\nmy studio to watch the completion of the statue, a taste for sculpture\r\nseized her, as it did the Princesse Marie d’Orleans, and until the\r\ndeparture of the family, which took place a few months before I myself\r\nleft Rome, Mademoiselle de Lanty took lessons from me in modelling.\r\n\r\nI never dreamed of being another Saint-Preux or Abelard, but I must own\r\nthat I found rare happiness in imparting my knowledge. Marianina was so\r\ngay and happy, her judgment of art so sound, her voice, when she sang,\r\nso stirred my heart, that had it not been for her vast fortune, which\r\nkept me at a distance, I should have run great danger to my peace\r\nof mind. Admitted into the household on the footing of a certain\r\nfamiliarity, I could see that my beautiful pupil took pleasure in our\r\nintercourse, and when the family returned to Paris she expressed the\r\nutmost regret at leaving Rome; I even fancied, God forgive me, that I\r\nsaw something like a tear in her eye when we parted.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Paris, some months later, my first visit was to the\r\nhotel de Lanty. Marianina was too well bred and too kind at heart to\r\nbe discourteous to any one, but I felt at once that a cold restrained\r\nmanner was substituted for the gracious friendliness of the past. It\r\nseemed to me probable that her evident liking, I will not say for me\r\npersonally, but for my conversation and acquirements, had been noticed\r\nby her parents, who had doubtless taught her a lesson; in fact, the\r\nstiff and forbidding manner of Monsieur and Madame de Lanty left me no\r\nother supposition.\r\n\r\nNaturally, I did not call again; but a few months later, when I\r\nexhibited my Pandora in the salon of 1837, I one day saw the whole\r\nLanty family approach it. The mother was on the arm of Comte Maxime de\r\nTrailles, a well-known lion. _Nil admirari_ is the natural instinct\r\nof all men of the world; so, after a very cursory glance at my work,\r\nMonsieur de Trailles began to find shocking faults in it, and in so\r\nhigh and clear a voice that not a word was lost within a certain range.\r\nMarianina shrugged her shoulders as she listened to this profound\r\ndiscourse, and when it was ended she said,--\r\n\r\n“How fortunate you came with us! Without your enlightened knowledge\r\nI might, with the rest of the good public, have thought this statue\r\nadmirable. It is a pity the sculptor is not here to learn his business\r\nfrom you.”\r\n\r\n“He _is_ here, behind you,” said a stout woman, who had once been\r\nmy landlady, and was standing near, laughing heartily. Involuntarily\r\nMarianina turned; when she saw me a vivid color came into her cheeks,\r\nand I slipped away into the crowd. A girl who took my part so warmly,\r\nand then showed such emotion on being detected in doing so, could not be\r\nabsolutely indifferent to me; and as on my first visit I had only, after\r\nall, been coldly received, I decided, after my great success at the\r\nExhibition, in consequence of which I was made a chevalier of the Legion\r\nof honor, to call again upon the Lantys; perhaps my new distinctions\r\nwould procure me a better reception.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Lanty received me without rising, and with the following\r\nastounding apostrophe:--\r\n\r\n“I think you very courageous, monsieur, to venture to present yourself\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“I have never been received in a manner that seemed to require courage\r\non my part.”\r\n\r\n“You have come, no doubt,” continued Monsieur de Lanty, “in search of\r\nyour property which you were careless enough to leave in our hands. I\r\nshall return you that article of gallantry.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he rose and took from a drawer in his secretary an elegant\r\nlittle portfolio, which he gave to me.\r\n\r\nAs I looked at it in a sort of stupefaction, he added:\r\n\r\n“Yes; I know the letters are not there; I presume you will allow me to\r\nkeep them.”\r\n\r\n“This portfolio, the letters you mention--all this is an enigma to me,\r\nmonsieur.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Madame de Lanty entered the room.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” said her husband, roughly.\r\n\r\n“I knew monsieur was here, and as I feared some painful explanation, I\r\ncame to do my duty as a woman, and interpose.”\r\n\r\n“You need fear nothing, madame,” I said; “evidently what is taking place\r\nis the result of some misunderstanding.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! this is too much!” cried Monsieur de Lanty, reopening the drawer\r\nfrom which he had taken the portfolio, and taking out a packet of\r\nletters tied with a rose-colored ribbon. “I think these will put an end\r\nto your _misunderstanding_.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the letters; they were not postmarked, and simply bore my\r\nname, Monsieur Dorlange, in a woman’s handwriting, which was unknown to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” I said, “you know more than I do; you have in your\r\npossession letters that seem to belong to me, but which I have never\r\nreceived.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” cried Monsieur de Lanty, “you are an admirable comedian;\r\nI never saw innocence better played.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur,” I said, “who wrote those letters, and why are they\r\naddressed to me?”\r\n\r\n“It is useless to deny them, monsieur,” said Madame de Lanty; “Marianina\r\nhas confessed all.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Marianina!” I exclaimed. “Then the matter is very simple;\r\nhave the goodness to bring us together; let me hear from her lips the\r\nexplanation of this singular affair.”\r\n\r\n“The evasion is clever,” replied Monsieur de Lanty; “but my daughter\r\nis no longer here: she is in a convent, forever sheltered from your\r\nintrigues and the dangers of her own ridiculous passion. If that is\r\nwhat you came to know, all is said. Let us part, for my patience and\r\nmoderation have a limit, if your insolence has none.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!” I began, angrily; but Madame de Lanty, who was standing\r\nbehind her husband, made me a gesture as if she would fall upon her\r\nknees; and reflecting that perhaps Marianina’s future depended on the\r\nattitude I now took, I controlled myself and left the room without\r\nfurther words.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before I was out of bed, the Abbe Fontanon was\r\nannounced to me. When he entered he proved to be a tall old man with a\r\nbilious skin and a sombre, stern expression, which he tried to soften by\r\na specious manner and a show of gentle but icy obsequiousness.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he said, “Madame la Comtesse de Lanty, whose confessor I\r\nhave the honor to be, requests me to give you a few explanations, to\r\nwhich you have an incontestable right, as to the scene that took place\r\nlast evening between her husband and yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready to listen to you, monsieur,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Lanty,” continued the abbe, “is a bad sleeper; and one\r\nnight last summer he was awakened by the sound of cautious steps.\r\nHe opened his door, and called out to know who was there. He was not\r\nmistaken; some one was there, but did not answer, and disappeared before\r\nMonsieur de Lanty could obtain a light. At first it was thought to be\r\nan attempt at robbery; but on further inquiry it appeared that a\r\n_gentleman_ had taken a room in the neighborhood, and had frequently\r\nbeen seen in company with Mademoiselle Marianina,--in short, the matter\r\nconcerned a love affair and not a robbery. Monsieur de Lanty has long\r\nwatched his daughter, whose ardent inclinations have given him much\r\nanxiety; you yourself, monsieur, caused him some uneasiness in Rome--”\r\n\r\n“Very needless, Monsieur l’abbe,” I said, interrupting him.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I know that your relations to Mademoiselle de Lanty have always\r\nbeen perfectly proper and becoming. But since their return to Paris\r\nanother individual has occupied her mind,--a bold and enterprising man,\r\ncapable of risking everything to compromise and thus win an heiress.\r\nBeing taxed with having encouraged this man and allowed these nocturnal\r\ninterviews, Mademoiselle de Lanty at first denied everything. Then,\r\nevidently fearing that her father, a violent man, would take some\r\nsteps against her lover, she threw herself at his feet and admitted the\r\nvisits, but denied that the visitor was the man her father named to her.\r\nAt first she refused obstinately to substitute another name for the\r\none she disavowed. After some days passed in this struggle, she finally\r\nconfessed to her mother, under a pledge of secrecy, that her father was\r\nright in his suspicions, but she dreaded the results to the family\r\nif she acknowledged the truth to him. The man in question was a noted\r\nduellist, and her father and brother would surely bring him to account\r\nfor his conduct. It was then, monsieur, that the idea occurred to this\r\nimprudent girl to substitute another name for that of her real lover.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I understand,” I said; “the name of a nobody, an artist, a\r\nsculptor, or some insignificant individual of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“You do Mademoiselle de Lanty injustice by that remark,” replied the\r\nabbe. “What decided her to make your name a refuge against the dangers\r\nshe foresaw was the fact that Monsieur de Lanty had formerly had\r\nsuspicions about you, and she thought that circumstance gave color to\r\nher statement.”\r\n\r\n“But, Monsieur l’abbe,” I said, “how do you explain those letters, that\r\nportfolio, which her father produced yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“That again was an invention of Marianina; and I may add that this\r\nduplicity assures me that had she remained in the world her future might\r\nhave been terrible.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to suppose that this tale has been told you by Madame de Lanty?”\r\n\r\n“Confided to me, monsieur, yes. You yourself saw Madame de Lanty’s\r\ndesire to stop your explanations yesterday, lest the truth might\r\nappear to her husband. I am requested by her to thank you for your\r\nconnivance--passive, of course--in this pious falsehood. She felt that\r\nshe could only show her profound gratitude by telling you the whole\r\ntruth and relying upon your discretion.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Mademoiselle Marianina?”\r\n\r\n“As Monsieur de Lanty told you, in a convent in Italy. To avoid scandal,\r\nit was thought best to send her to some safe retreat. Her own conduct\r\nwill decide her future.”\r\n\r\nNow what do you think of that history? Does it not seem to you very\r\nimprobable? Here are two explanations which have each come into my mind\r\nwith the force of a conviction. First, Marianina’s brother has just\r\nmarried into a grand-ducal family of Germany. Immense sacrifices must\r\nhave been required of the de Lanty family to make such an alliance.\r\nWas Marianina’s _dot_, and the fortune she inherited from that old\r\ngrand-uncle, required to pay the costs of that princely union? Secondly,\r\ndid Marianina really feel an attachment for me? And did she, in a\r\ngirlish way, express it on those letters which she never sent? To punish\r\nher, had her parents sent her to a convent? And to disgust me, and throw\r\nme off the track, had the mother invented this history of another love\r\nin which she seemed to make me play so mortifying a part?\r\n\r\nI may add that the intervention of the Abbe Fontanon authorizes such an\r\ninterpretation. I have made inquiries about him, and I find he is one\r\nof those mischievous priests who worm themselves into the confidence of\r\nfamilies for their own ends; he has already destroyed the harmony of\r\none home,--that of Monsieur de Granville, attorney-general of the royal\r\ncourt of Paris under the Restoration.\r\n\r\nAs to the truth or falsehood of these suppositions I know nothing, and,\r\nin all probability, shall continue to know nothing. But, as you can\r\neasily understand, the thought of Marianina is a luminous point to\r\nwhich my eye is forever attached. Shall I love her? Shall I hate her and\r\ndespise her? That is the question perpetually in my mind. Uncertainty\r\nof that kind is far more certain to fix a woman in a man’s soul than to\r\ndislodge her.\r\n\r\nWell, to sum up in two brief sentences my reply to your warnings: As\r\nfor the opinion of Monsieur Bixiou, I care as little for it as for last\r\nyear’s roses; and as for that other danger which you fear, I cannot tell\r\nyou whether I love Marianina or not, but this I know, I do _not_ love\r\nMadame de l’Estorade. That, I think, is giving you a plain and honest\r\nanswer. And now, let us leave our master the Future to do what he likes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE TO MADAME OCTAVE DE CAMPS\r\n\r\nParis, May, 1839.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Dorlange came last evening to take leave of us. He starts\r\nto-day for Arcis-sur-Aube, where the ceremony of inaugurating _his_\r\nstatue takes place. That is also the place selected by the Opposition\r\njournals for his candidacy. Monsieur de l’Estorade declares that the\r\nlocality could not have been worse chosen, and that it leaves his\r\nelection without a chance.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Dorlange paid his visit early. I was alone. Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade was dining with the Minister of the Interior, and the\r\nchildren were in bed. The conversation interrupted by Madame de la\r\nBastie could now be renewed, as I was about to ask him to continue the\r\nhistory, of which he had only told me the last words, when our old Lucas\r\nbrought me a letter. It was from my Armand, to let me know that he had\r\nbeen ill since morning, and was then in the infirmary.\r\n\r\n“Order the carriage,” I said to Lucas, in a state of agitation you can\r\neasily conceive.\r\n\r\n“But, madame,” replied Lucas, “monsieur has ordered the carriage to\r\nfetch him at half-past nine o’clock, and Tony has already started.”\r\n\r\n“Then send for a cab.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that I can find one,” said our old servant, who is a man\r\nof difficulties; “it is beginning to rain.”\r\n\r\nWithout noticing that remark and without thinking of Monsieur Dorlange,\r\nI went hastily to my room to put on my bonnet and shawl. That done, I\r\nreturned to the salon, where my visitor still remained.\r\n\r\n“You must excuse me, monsieur,” I said to him, “for leaving you so\r\nabruptly. I must hasten to the Henri IV. College. I could not possibly\r\npass a night in the dreadful anxiety my son’s letter has caused me; he\r\ntells me he has been ill since morning in the infirmary.”\r\n\r\n“But,” replied Monsieur Dorlange, “surely you are not going alone in a\r\nhired carriage to that lonely quarter?”\r\n\r\n“Lucas will go with me.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Lucas returned; his prediction was realized; there was\r\nnot a coach on the stand; it was raining in torrents. Time was passing;\r\nalready it was almost too late to enter the school, where masters and\r\npupils go to bed at nine o’clock.\r\n\r\n“Put on thick shoes,” I said to Lucas, “and come with me on foot.”\r\n\r\nInstantly I saw his face lengthen. He is no longer young and loves his\r\nease; moreover, he complains every winter of rheumatism. He made various\r\nobjections,--that it was very late; that we should “revolutionize” the\r\nschool; I should take cold; Monsieur Armand could not be very ill if he\r\nwrote himself; in short, it was clear that my plan of campaign did not\r\nsuit my old retainer.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Dorlange very obligingly offered to go himself in my place and\r\nbring me word about Armand; but that did not suit me at all; I felt that\r\nI _must_ see for myself. Having thanked him, I said to Lucas in a tone\r\nof authority:--\r\n\r\n“Get ready at once, for one thing is true in your remarks: it is getting\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\nSeeing himself driven into a corner, Lucas raised the standard of\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n“It is not possible that madame should go out in such weather; and I\r\ndon’t want monsieur to scold me for giving in to such a singular idea.”\r\n\r\n“Then you do not intend to obey me?”\r\n\r\n“Madame knows very well that for anything reasonable I would do what she\r\ntold me if I had to go through fire to obey her.”\r\n\r\n“Heat is good for rheumatism, but rain is not,” I said; then, turning to\r\nMonsieur Dorlange, I added: “As you were so kind as to offer to do this\r\nerrand alone, may I ask you to give me your arm and come with me?”\r\n\r\n“I am like Lucas,” he said, “I do not think this excursion absolutely\r\nnecessary; but as I am not afraid of being scolded by Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade, I shall have the honor to accompany you.”\r\n\r\nWe started. The weather was frightful; we had hardly gone fifty steps\r\nbefore we were soaked in spite of Lucas’s huge umbrella, with which\r\nMonsieur Dorlange sheltered me at his own expense. Luckily a coach\r\nhappened to pass; Monsieur Dorlange hailed the driver; it was empty.\r\nOf course I could not tell my companion that he was not to get in; such\r\ndistrust was extremely unbecoming and not for me to show. But you know,\r\nmy dear friend, that showers of rain have helped lovers from the days\r\nof Dido down. However, Monsieur Dorlange said nothing: he saw my anxiety\r\nand he had the good taste not to attempt conversation, breaking the\r\nsilence only from time to time with casual remarks. When we reached the\r\nschool, after getting out of the carriage to give me his hand he saw for\r\nhimself that he must not enter the house and he therefore got back into\r\nthe carriage to await my return.\r\n\r\nWell, I found Monsieur Armand had hoaxed me. His illness reduced itself\r\nto a headache, which departed soon after he had written me. The doctor,\r\nfor the sake of ordering something, had told him to take an infusion\r\nof linden-leaves, telling him that the next day he could go back to his\r\nstudies. I had taken a club to kill a flea, and committed all sorts of\r\nenormities to get there at an hour when the entire establishment were\r\ngoing to bed, only to find my young gentleman perfectly well and playing\r\nchess with one of the nurses.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the school I found the rain had ceased and the moon was\r\nshining brightly. My heart was full; the reaction from my great anxiety\r\nhad set in and I felt a need of breathing the fresh air. I therefore\r\nproposed to Monsieur Dorlange to dismiss the coach and return on foot.\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity for him to make me that long-delayed\r\nexplanation; but Monsieur Dorlange seemed so little inclined to take\r\nadvantage of it that, using Monsieur Armand’s freak as a text, he read\r\nme a lecture on the danger of spoiling children: a subject which was not\r\nat all agreeable to me, as he must have perceived from the rather stiff\r\nmanner with which I listened to him. Come, thought I, I must and will\r\nget to the bottom of this history; it is like the tale of Sancho’s\r\nherdsman, which had the faculty of never getting told. So, cutting short\r\nmy companion’s theories of education, I said distinctly:--\r\n\r\n“This is a very good time, I think, to continue the confidence you were\r\nabout to make to me. Here we are sure of no interruption.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I shall prove a poor story-teller,” replied Monsieur\r\nDorlange. “I have spent all my fire this very day in telling that tale\r\nto Marie-Gaston.”\r\n\r\n“That,” I answered laughing, “is against your own theory of secrecy, in\r\nwhich a third party is one too many.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Marie-Gaston and I count for one only. Besides, I had to reply to\r\nhis odd ideas about you and me.”\r\n\r\n“What about me?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he imagined that in looking at the sun I should be dazzled by its\r\nrays.”\r\n\r\n“Which means, speaking less metaphorically--?”\r\n\r\n“That, in view of the singularities which accompanied my first knowledge\r\nof you and led me to the honor of your acquaintance, I might\r\nexpose myself to the danger, madame, of not retaining my reason and\r\nself-possession.”\r\n\r\n“And your history refutes this fear in the mind of Monsieur\r\nMarie-Gaston?”\r\n\r\n“You shall judge.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, without further preamble, he told me a long tale which I need\r\nnot repeat here; the gist of it is, however, that Monsieur Dorlange is\r\nin love with a woman who posed in his imagination for Saint-Ursula; but\r\nas this woman appears to be forever lost to him it did not seem to me\r\nimpossible that in the long run he might transfer his sentiments for her\r\nmemory to me. When he had finished his tale he asked if I did not think\r\nit a victorious answer to the ridiculous fears of our friend.\r\n\r\n“Modesty,” I replied, “obliges me to share your security; but they say\r\nthat in the army shots frequently ricochet and kill their victims.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think me capable of the impertinence Marie-Gaston is good\r\nenough to suspect in me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about its being an impertinence,” I said stiffly, “but\r\nif such a fancy came into your mind, I should think you very much to be\r\npitied.”\r\n\r\nHis answer was vehement.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” he said, “you will not have to pity me. In my opinion, first\r\nlove is a vaccination which protects us from a second.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation stopped there. We had now reached my own door, and\r\nI invited Monsieur Dorlange to come in. He accepted my politeness,\r\nremarking that Monsieur de l’Estorade had probably returned and he could\r\nthus take leave of him.\r\n\r\nMy husband was at home. I don’t know whether Lucas, forestalling the\r\nrebuke I intended to give him, had made out a story to excuse himself,\r\nor whether Monsieur de l’Estorade for the first time in his life, felt,\r\nin view of my maternal escapade, a movement of jealousy. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that his manner of receiving me was curt; he called it an\r\nunheard-of thing to go out at such an hour, in such weather, to see\r\na boy who proved, by announcing his own illness, that it was nothing\r\nserious. After letting him talk in this discourteous way for some little\r\ntime, I thought it was time to put an end to the scene, so I said in a\r\nrather peremptory tone:--\r\n\r\n“As I wanted to sleep at night, I went to the school in a pelting rain;\r\nI came back by moonlight; and I beg you to remark that monsieur, who was\r\nso good as to escort me, has come upstairs to bid you good-bye, because\r\nhe leaves Paris to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nI have habitually enough power over Monsieur de l’Estorade to make this\r\ncall to order effective; but I saw that my husband was displeased, and\r\nthat instead of having made Monsieur Dorlange an easy diversion, I had\r\ncalled down upon his head the ill-humor of my ogre, who instantly turned\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nAfter telling him that much had been said about his candidacy during\r\ndinner at the ministry, Monsieur de l’Estorade began to show him all\r\nthe reasons why he might expect an overwhelming defeat; namely, that\r\nArcis-sur-Aube was one of the boroughs where the administration felt\r\nitself most secure; that a man of extraordinary political ability had\r\nalready been sent there to manipulate the election, and had made a\r\nfirst report giving triumphant news of his success. These were only\r\ngeneralities, to which Monsieur Dorlange replied with modesty, but also\r\nwith the air of a man who had resolved who take his chances against all\r\nrisks to which his election might be exposed. Monsieur de l’Estorade\r\nthen produced a final shaft which, under the circumstances, was\r\ncalculated to have a marvellous effect, because it attacked both the\r\ncandidate and his private life.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, my dear monsieur,” said my husband, “when a man starts\r\non an electoral career he must remember that he stakes everything; his\r\npublic life and also his private life. Your adversaries will ransack\r\nyour present and your past with a pitiless hand, and sorrow to him who\r\nhas any dark spots to hide. Now I ought not to conceal from you that\r\nto-night, at the ministers’, much was said about a little scandal which,\r\nwhile it may be venial in the life of an artist, takes proportions\r\naltogether more serious in that of the people’s representative. You\r\nunderstand me, of course. I refer to that handsome Italian woman whom\r\nyou have in your house. Take care; some puritanical elector whose own\r\nmorality may be more or less problematical, is likely to call you to\r\naccount for her presence.”\r\n\r\nThe reply made by Monsieur Dorlange was very dignified.\r\n\r\n“To those,” he said, “who may arraign me on that detail of my private\r\nlife I wish but one thing--that they may have nothing worse upon their\r\nconsciences. If I had not already wearied madame on our way from the\r\nschool with an interminable story, I would tell you the facts relating\r\nto my handsome Italian, and you would see, Monsieur le comte, that her\r\npresence in my house reflects in no way upon me.\r\n\r\n“But,” returned Monsieur de l’Estorade, softening his tone, “you take my\r\nobservation rather too seriously. As I said just now, an artist may have\r\na handsome model in his house--that may be natural enough--but she is\r\nnot a usual piece of furniture in that of a legislator.”\r\n\r\n“No, what seems more to their liking,” replied Monsieur Dorlange, with\r\nsome heat, “is the good they can get for themselves out of a calumny\r\naccepted eagerly and without examination. However, far from dreading\r\ninquiry on the subject you mention, I desire it, and the ministry will\r\ndo me a great service if it will employ the extremely able political\r\npersonage you say they have put upon my path to bring that delicate\r\nquestion before the electors.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really start to-morrow?” asked Monsieur de l’Estorade, finding\r\nthat he had started a subject which not only did not confound Monsieur\r\nDorlange, but, on the contrary, gave him the opportunity to reply with a\r\ncertain hauteur of tone and speech.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and very early too; so that I must now take leave of you, having\r\ncertain preparations still to make.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Monsieur Dorlange rose, and after making me a rather\r\nceremonious bow and not bestowing his hand on Monsieur de l’Estorade,\r\nwho, in turn, did not hold out his own, he left the room.\r\n\r\n“What was the matter with Armand?” asked my husband, as if to avoid any\r\nother explanation.\r\n\r\n“Never mind Armand,” I said, “it is far more interesting to know what\r\nis the matter with you; for never did I see you so out of tune, so sharp\r\nand uncivil.”\r\n\r\n“What! because I told a ridiculous candidate that he would have to go\r\ninto mourning for his reputation?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, that was not complimentary; and in any case the\r\nmoment was ill-chosen with a man on whom my maternal anxiety had just\r\nimposed a disagreeable service.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like meddlers,” retorted Monsieur de l’Estorade, raising his\r\nvoice more than I had ever known him do to me. “And after all, if he had\r\nnot been here to give you his arm you would not have gone.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken; I should have gone alone; for your servant, being\r\nmaster here, refused to accompany me.”\r\n\r\n“But you must certainly admit that if any acquaintance had met you at\r\nhalf-past nine o’clock walking arm-in-arm with Monsieur Dorlange the\r\nthing would have seemed to them, to say the least, singular.”\r\n\r\nPretending to discover what I had known for the last hour, I\r\nexclaimed:--\r\n\r\n“Is it possible that after sixteen years of married life you do me\r\nthe honor to be jealous. Now I see why, in spite of your respect for\r\nproprieties, you spoke to Monsieur Dorlange in my presence of that\r\nItalian woman whom people think his mistress; that was a nice little\r\nperfidy by which you meant to ruin him in my estimation.”\r\n\r\nThus exposed to the light, my poor husband talked at random for a\r\ntime, and finally had no resource but to ring for Lucas and lecture him\r\nseverely. That ended the explanation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this conjugal proceeding, by which my husband,\r\nwishing to do a man some harm in my estimation, gave him the opportunity\r\nto appear to the utmost advantage? For--there was no mistaking it--the\r\nsort of emotion with which Monsieur Dorlange repelled the charge was the\r\ncry of a conscience at peace with itself, and which knows itself able to\r\nconfound a calumny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. DORLANGE TO MARIE-GASTON\r\n\r\nParis, May, 1839.\r\n\r\nOn my return this evening from the Estorades, on whom I had paid my\r\nparting call, I found your letter, my dear friend, in which you announce\r\nyour coming arrival. I shall await you to-morrow during the day, but\r\nin the evening I must, without further delay, start for Arcis-sur-Aube,\r\nwhere, in the course of the next week my political matters will come\r\nto a head. What particular hold I may have on that town, which, as it\r\nappears, I have the ambition to represent, and on what co-operation\r\nand assistance I may rely,--in a word, _who_ is making my electoral\r\nbed,--all that I know as little about as I did last year when I was told\r\nfor the first time that I must enter political life.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I received a second letter from my father, postmarked\r\nParis this time, and not Stockholm. Judging by the style of the\r\ndocument, it would not surprise me if the “eminent services” rendered\r\nin a Northern court by the mysterious author of my days turned out to be\r\nthose of a Prussian corporal. It would be impossible to issue orders\r\nin a more imperative tone, or to dwell more minutely on trifling\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nThe note or memorandum was headed thus: _What my son is to do_.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of these instructions I am to send to its destination the\r\nSaint-Ursula; to superintend the packing and boxing of it myself, and to\r\ndespatch it by the fastest carrier, to Mother Marie-des-Anges, superior\r\nof the convent of the Ursulines at Arcis-sur-Aube.\r\n\r\nThe order went on to say that I was to follow the statue in a few days,\r\nso as to arrive at the said Arcis-sur-Aube not later than the 3rd of\r\nMay. Even the inn at which I was to put up was dictated. I would find\r\nmyself expected at the Hotel de la Poste; so that if I happen to prefer\r\nany of the others I must resign that fancy. I am also enjoined to\r\npublish in the newspapers on the day of my departure the fact that\r\nI present myself as candidate in the electoral arrondissement of\r\nArcis-sur-Aube; avoiding, however, to make any profession of political\r\nfaith, which would be both useless and premature. The document ended\r\nwith an injunction which, while it humiliated me somewhat, gave me a\r\ncertain faith in what was happening. The Mongenod Brothers, and draw for\r\nanother sum of two hundred and fifty thousand francs, which _is to\r\nbe_ deposited in my name, “taking the utmost care,” continued my\r\ninstructions, “when transporting this money from Paris to Arcis-sur-Aube\r\nthat it be not lost or stolen.”\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of that last clause, dear friend? That sum _is to\r\nbe_ deposited; then it is not already there; and suppose it is not\r\nthere?--Besides, what am I to do with it in Arcis? Am I to stand my\r\nelection on English principles? if so, a profession of political faith\r\nwould certainly be useless and premature. As to the advice not to lose\r\nor allow to be stolen the money in my possession, do you not think that\r\nthat is making me rather juvenile? I feel an inclination to suck my\r\nthumb and cry for a rattle. However, I shall let myself go with the\r\ncurrent that is bearing me along, and, notwithstanding the news of your\r\ncoming arrival, after paying a visit to the Brothers Mongenod, I shall\r\nvaliantly start, imagining the stupefaction of the good people of\r\nArcis on seeing another candidate pop up in their midst like a\r\nJack-in-the-box.\r\n\r\nIn Paris I have already fired my gun. The “National” has announced my\r\ncandidacy in the warmest terms; and it seems that this evening, in the\r\nhouse of the Minister of the Interior, where Monsieur de l’Estorade was\r\ndining, I was discussed at some length. I ought to add that, according\r\nto Monsieur de l’Estorade, the general impression is that I shall\r\ncertainly fail of election. The ministry might possibly fear a candidate\r\nfrom the Left centre; but as for the democratic party to which I am\r\nsupposed to belong, they do not even allow that it exists. The Left\r\ncentre candidate has, however, been disposed of by a ministerial envoy\r\nof the ablest and most active description, and at this moment, when I\r\nset off my small balloon, the election of the Conservative candidate is\r\npretty well assured.\r\n\r\nAmong the elements of my inevitable defeat, Monsieur de l’Estorade\r\ncondescended to mention a matter about which, dear friend, I am rather\r\nsurprised that you have not already lectured me. It is one of those\r\nagreeable calumnies put in circulation in the salon Montcornet by the\r\nhonored and honorable Monsieur Bixiou. The scandal concerns a handsome\r\nItalian woman whom I brought back from Italy and with whom I am said to\r\nbe living in a manner not canonical. Come, tell me, what hindered you\r\nfrom asking me to explain this important matter? Did you think the\r\ncharge so shameful that you feared to offend me by alluding to it? Or\r\nhave you such confidence in my morality that you felt no need of being\r\nstrengthened therein? I did not have time to enter upon the necessary\r\nexplanations to Monsieur de l’Estorade, neither have I the leisure to\r\nwrite them to you now. If I speak of the incident it is for the purpose\r\nof telling you of an observation I think I have made, into the truth of\r\nwhich I want you to examine after you get here. It is this:--\r\n\r\nI have an idea that it would not be agreeable to Monsieur de l’Estorade\r\nto see me successful in my electoral campaign. He never gave much\r\napprobation to the plan; in fact he tried to dissuade me, but always\r\nfrom the point of view of my own interests. But to-day, when he\r\nfinds that the plan has taken shape, and is actually discussed in the\r\nministerial salon, my gentleman turns bitter, and he seems to feel\r\na malignant pleasure in prophesying my defeat and in producing this\r\ncharming little infamy under which he expects to bury our friendship.\r\n\r\nWhy so! I will tell you: while feeling some gratitude for the service I\r\ndid him, the worthy man also felt from the height of his social position\r\na superiority over me of which my entrance to the Chamber will now\r\ndispossess him; and it is not agreeable to him to renounce that sense of\r\nsuperiority. After all, what is an artist, even though he may be a man\r\nof genius, compared to a peer of France, a personage who puts his hand\r\nto the tiller and steers the great political and social system; a man\r\nwho has access to kings and ministers, and who would have the right\r\nif, by impossibility, such audacity should seize upon his mind, of\r\ndepositing a black ball against the budget. Well, this privileged being\r\ndoes not like that I, and others like me, should assume the importance\r\nand authority of that insolent elective Chamber.\r\n\r\nBut that is not all. Hereditary statesmen have a foolish pretension:\r\nthat of being initiated by long study into a certain science represented\r\nas arduous, which they call the science of public affairs and which they\r\n(like physicians with medical science) alone have the right to practise.\r\nThey are not willing that an underling, a journalist for instance, or\r\nlower than that, an artist, a cutter of images, should presume to slip\r\ninto their domain and speak out beside them. A poet, an artist, a writer\r\nmay be endowed with eminent faculties, they will agree to that; the\r\nprofession of such men presupposes it; but statesmen they cannot be.\r\nChateaubriand himself, though better placed than the rest of us to make\r\nhimself a niche in the Governmental Olympus, was turned out of doors one\r\nmorning by a concise little note, signed Joseph de Villele, dismissing\r\nhim, as was proper, to Rene, Atala, and other futilities.\r\n\r\nI know that time and that tall posthumous daughter of ours whom we call\r\nPosterity will some day do good justice and plead the right thing in the\r\nright place. Towards the end of 2039, the world, if it deigns to last\r\ntill then, will know what Canalis, Joseph Bridau, Daniel d’Arthez,\r\nStidmann, and Leon de Lora were in 1839; whereas an infinitely small\r\nnumber of persons will know that during the same period Monsieur le\r\nComte de l’Estorade was peer of France, and president of the Cour des\r\ncomptes; Monsieur le Comte de Rastignac minister of Public Works; and\r\nhis brother-in-law, Monsieur le Baron Martial de la Roche-Hugon was a\r\ndiplomat and Councillor of State employed on more or less extraordinary\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nBut while awaiting this tardy classification and distant reform, I think\r\nit well to let our great governing class know from time to time\r\nthat unless their names are Richelieu or Colbert they are liable to\r\ncompetition and are forced to accept it. So, with this aggravating\r\nintention I begin to take pleasure in my enterprise; and if I am\r\nelected, I shall, unless you assure me that I have mistaken de\r\nl’Estorade’s meaning, find occasion to let him and others of his kind\r\nknow that one can, if so disposed, climb over the walls of their little\r\nparks and strut as their equals.\r\n\r\nBut how is it, my dear friend, that I rattle on about myself and say no\r\nword about the sad emotions which must attend your return to France? How\r\ncan you bear them? And instead of endeavoring to lay them aside, I fear\r\nyou are willingly nursing them and taking a melancholy pleasure in their\r\nrevival. Dear friend, I say to you of these great sorrows what I said\r\njust now of our governing class--we should consider them from the point\r\nof view of time and space, by the action of which they become after a\r\nwhile imperceptible.\r\n\r\nDo me a favor! On arriving in Paris without having a house prepared to\r\nreceive you, it would be very friendly--you would seem like the man of\r\nold times--if you would take up your quarters with me, instead of going\r\nto Ville d’Avray, which, indeed, I think dangerous and even bad for you.\r\nStay with me, and you can thus judge of my handsome housekeeper, and you\r\nwill see how much she has been calumniated and misunderstood. You\r\nwill also be near to the l’Estorades in whom I expect you to find\r\nconsolations; and besides, this act would be a charming expiation for\r\nall the involuntary wrongs you have done me. At any rate, I have given\r\nmy orders, and your room is ready for you.\r\n\r\nP.S. You have not yet arrived, dear friend, and I must close this\r\nletter, which will be given to you by my housekeeper when you come by my\r\nhouse, for I am certain that your first visit will be to me.\r\n\r\nI went this morning to the Mongenods’; the two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand francs were there, but with the accompaniment of a most\r\nextraordinary circumstance; the money was in the name of the Comte de\r\nSallenauve, otherwise Dorlange, sculptor, 42 rue de l’Ouest. In spite\r\nof an appellation which has never been mine, the money was mine, and was\r\npaid to me without the slightest hesitation. I had enough presence of\r\nmind not to seem stupefied by my new name and title before the cashier;\r\nbut I saw Monsieur Mongenod the elder in private, a man who enjoys the\r\nhighest reputation at the Bank, and to him I expressed my astonishment,\r\nasking for whatever explanations he was able to give me. He could give\r\nnone; the money came to him through a Dutch banker, his correspondent\r\nat Rotterdam, and he knew nothing beyond that. _Ah ca_! what does it\r\nall mean? Am I to be a noble? Has the moment come for my father to\r\nacknowledge me? I start in a state of agitation and of anxiety which you\r\ncan well understand. Until I hear from you, I shall address my letters\r\nto you here. If you decide not to stay in my house, let me know\r\nyour address at once. Say nothing of what I have now told you to the\r\nl’Estorades; let it remain secret between us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. DORLANGE TO MARIE-GASTON\r\n\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, May 3, 1839.\r\n\r\nDear friend,--Last evening, before Maitre Achille Pigoult, notary of\r\nthis place, the burial of Charles Dorlange took place,--that individual\r\nissuing to the world, like a butterfly from a grub, under the name\r\nand estate of Charles de Sallenauve, son of Francois-Henri-Pantaleon\r\nDumirail, Marquis de Sallenauve. Here follows the tale of certain facts\r\nwhich preceded this brilliant transformation.\r\n\r\nLeaving Paris on the evening of May 1st, I arrived at Arcis, according\r\nto my father’s directions, on the following day. You can believe my\r\nsurprise when I saw in the street where the diligence stopped the\r\nelusive Jacques Bricheteau, whom I had not seen since our singular\r\nmeeting on the Ile Saint-Louis. This time I beheld him, instead of\r\nbehaving like the dog of Jean de Nivelle, come towards me with a smile\r\nupon his lips, holding out his hand and saying:--\r\n\r\n“At last, my dear monsieur, we are almost at the end of all our\r\nmysteries, and soon, I hope, you will see that you have no cause to\r\ncomplain of me. Have you brought the money?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “neither lost nor stolen.” And I drew from my pocket\r\na wallet containing the two hundred and fifty thousand francs in bank\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n“Very good!” said Jacques Bricheteau. “Now let us go to the Hotel de la\r\nPoste; no doubt you know who awaits you there.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed I do not,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“You must have remarked the name and title under which that money was\r\npaid to you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; that strange circumstance struck me forcibly, and has, I\r\nmust own, stirred my imagination.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we shall now completely lift the veil, one corner of which we\r\nwere careful to raise at first, so that you might not come too abruptly\r\nto the great and fortunate event that is now before you.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to see my father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Jacques Bricheteau; “your father is awaiting you; but I\r\nmust warn you against a probable cloud on his manner of receiving you.\r\nThe marquis has suffered much; the court life which he has always led\r\nhas trained him to show no outward emotions; besides, he has a horror of\r\neverything bourgeois. You must not be surprised, therefore, at the cold\r\nand dignified reception he will probably give you; at heart, he is good\r\nand kind, and you will appreciate him better when you know him.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” thought I, “are very comforting assurances, and as I myself am\r\nnot very ardently disposed, I foresee that this interview will be at\r\nsome degrees below zero.”\r\n\r\nOn going into the room where the Marquis awaited me, I saw a very tall,\r\nvery thin, very bald man, seated at a table on which he was arranging\r\npapers. On hearing the door open, he pushed his spectacles up on his\r\nforehead, rested his hands on the arms of his chair, and looking round\r\nat us he waited.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Comte de Sallenauve,” said Jacques Bricheteau, announcing\r\nme with the solemnity of an usher of ambassadors or a groom of the\r\nChambers.\r\n\r\nBut in the presence of the man to whom I owed my life the ice in me was\r\ninstantly melted; I stepped forward with an eager impulse, feeling the\r\ntears rise to my eyes. He did not move. There was not the faintest trace\r\nof agitation in his face, which had that peculiar look of high dignity\r\nthat used to be called “the grand air”; he merely held out his hand,\r\nlimply grasped mine, and then said:\r\n\r\n“Be seated, monsieur--for I have not yet the right to call you my son.”\r\n\r\nWhen Jacques Bricheteau and I had taken chairs--\r\n\r\n“Then you have no objection,” said this strange kind of father, “to\r\nassuming the political position we are trying to secure for you?”\r\n\r\n“None at all,” said I. “The notion startled me at first, but I soon grew\r\naccustomed to it; and to ensure success, I have punctually carried out\r\nall the instructions that were conveyed to me.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” said the Marquis, taking up from the table a gold snuff-box\r\nwhich he twirled in his fingers.\r\n\r\nThen, after a short silence, he added:\r\n\r\n“Now I owe you certain explanations. Our good friend Jacques Bricheteau,\r\nif he will have the kindness, will lay them before you.”\r\n\r\nThis was equivalent to the royal formula of the old regime: “My\r\nchamberlain will tell you the rest.”\r\n\r\n“To go back to the origin of everything,” said Jacques Bricheteau,\r\naccepting the duty thus put upon him, “I must first tell you that you\r\nare not a legitimate Sallenauve. When Monsieur le marquis, here\r\npresent, returned after the emigration, in the year 1808, he made the\r\nacquaintance of your mother, and in 1809 you were born as the fruit of\r\ntheir intercourse. Your birth, as you already know, cost your mother her\r\nlife, and as misfortunes never come singly, Monsieur de Sallenauve was\r\ncompromised in a conspiracy against the imperial power and compelled to\r\nfly the country. Brought up in Arcis with me, the marquis, wishing to\r\ngive me a proof of his friendship, confided to me, on his departure\r\nto this new expatriation, the care of your childhood. I accepted that\r\ncharge, I will not say with alacrity, but certainly with gratitude.”\r\n\r\nAt these words the marquis held out his hand to Jacques Bricheteau, who\r\nwas seated near him, and after a silent pressure, which did not seem to\r\nme remarkably warm, Jacques Bricheteau continued:--\r\n\r\n“The mysterious precautions I was forced to take in carrying out my\r\ntrust are explained by Monsieur le marquis’s position towards the\r\nvarious governments which have succeeded each other in France since\r\nthe period of your birth. Under the Empire, I feared that a government\r\nlittle indulgent to attacks upon itself might send you to share your\r\nfather’s exile; it was then that the idea of giving you a sort of\r\nanonymous existence first occurred to me. Under the Restoration I feared\r\nfor you another class of enemies; the Sallenauve family, which has no\r\nother representatives at the present day than Monsieur le marquis, was\r\nthen powerful. In some way it got wind of your existence, and also of\r\nthe fact that the marquis had taken the precaution not to recognize you,\r\nin order to retain the right to leave you his whole fortune, which, as a\r\nnatural child, the law would in part have deprived you. The obscurity in\r\nwhich I kept you seemed to me the best security, against the schemes of\r\ngreedy relations, and certain mysterious steps taken by them from time\r\nto time proved the wisdom of these precautions. Under the government\r\nof July, on the other hand, it was I myself who I feared might endanger\r\nyou. I had seen the establishment of the new order of things with\r\nthe deepest regret, and not believing in its duration, I took part in\r\ncertain active hostilities against it, which brought me under the ban of\r\nthe police.”\r\n\r\nHere the recollection that Jacques Bricheteau had been pointed out by\r\nthe waiter of the Cafe des Arts as a member of the police made me smile,\r\nwhereupon the speaker stopped and said with a very serious air:--\r\n\r\n“Do these explanations which I have the honor to give you seem\r\nimprobable?”\r\n\r\nI explained the meaning of my smile.\r\n\r\n“That waiter,” said Jacques Bricheteau, “was not altogether mistaken;\r\nfor I have long been employed at the prefecture of police in the\r\nhealth department; but I have nothing to do with police espial; on the\r\ncontrary, I have more than once come near being the victim of it.”\r\n\r\nHere a rather ridiculous noise struck our ears, nothing less than a loud\r\nsnore from my father, who thus gave us to know that he did not take\r\na very keen interest in the explanations furnished in his name with\r\na certain prolixity. I don’t know whether Jacques Bricheteau’s vanity\r\nbeing touched put him slightly out of temper, but he rose impatiently\r\nand shook the arm of the sleeper, crying out:--\r\n\r\n“Hey! marquis, if you sleep like this at the Council of state, upon my\r\nsoul, your country must be well governed!”\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Sallenauve opened his eyes, shook himself, and then said,\r\nturning to me:--\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Monsieur le comte, but for the last ten nights I have\r\ntravelled, without stopping, to meet you here; and though I spent the\r\nlast night in a bed, I am still much fatigued.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he rose, took a large pinch of snuff, and began to walk up and\r\ndown the room, while Jacques Bricheteau continued:--\r\n\r\n“It is a little more than a year since I received a letter from your\r\nfather explaining his long silence, the plans he had made for you, and\r\nthe necessity he was under of keeping his incognito for a few years\r\nlonger. It was at that very time that you made your attempt to penetrate\r\na secret the existence of which had become apparent to you.”\r\n\r\n“You made haste to escape me,” I said laughing. “It was then you went to\r\nStockholm.”\r\n\r\n“No, I went to your father’s residence; I put the letter that he gave me\r\nfor you into the post at Stockholm.”\r\n\r\n“I do not seize your--”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier to understand,” interrupted the marquis. “I do not\r\nreside in Sweden, and we wished to throw you off the track.”\r\n\r\n“Will you continue the explanation yourself?” asked Jacques Bricheteau,\r\nwho spoke, as you may have observed, my dear friend, with elegance and\r\nfluency.\r\n\r\n“No, no, go on,” said the marquis; “you are giving it admirably.”\r\n\r\n“Feeling certain that your equivocal position as to family would injure\r\nthe political career your father desired you to enter, I made that\r\nremark to him in one of my letters. He agreed with me, and resolved\r\nto hasten the period of your legal recognition, which, indeed, the\r\nextinction of the family in its other branch rendered desirable. But the\r\nrecognition of a natural son is a serious act which the law surrounds\r\nwith many precautions. Deeds must be signed before a notary, and to do\r\nthis by power of attorney would involve both in a publicity which he\r\nis anxious for the present to avoid, he being married, and, as it were,\r\nnaturalized in the country of his adoption. Hence, he decided to come\r\nhere himself, obtaining leave of absence for a few weeks, in order\r\nto sign in person all papers necessary to secure to you his name and\r\nproperty in this country. Now let me put to you a final question. Do you\r\nconsent to take the name of de Sallenauve and be recognized as his son?”\r\n\r\n“I am not a lawyer,” I answered; “but it seems to me that, supposing I\r\ndo not feel honored by this recognition, it does not wholly depend on me\r\nto decline it.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” replied Jacques Bricheteau; “under the circumstances\r\nyou could, if you chose, legally contest the paternity. I will also\r\nadd,--and in doing so I am sure that I express the intentions of your\r\nfather,--if you think that a man who has already spent half a million on\r\nfurthering your career is not a desirable father, we leave you free to\r\nfollow your own course, and shall not insist in any way.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, precisely,” said Monsieur de Sallenauve, uttering that\r\naffirmation with the curt intonation and shrill voice peculiar to the\r\nrelics of the old aristocracy.\r\n\r\nPoliteness, to say the least, forced me to accept the paternity thus\r\noffered to me. To the few words I uttered to that effect, Jacques\r\nBricheteau replied gaily:--\r\n\r\n“We certainly do not intend to make you buy a father in a poke.\r\nMonsieur le marquis is desirous of laying before you all title-deeds and\r\ndocuments of every kind of which he is the present holder. Moreover, as\r\nhe has been so long absent from this country, he intends to prove his\r\nidentity by several of his contemporaries who are still living. For\r\ninstance, among the honorable personages who have already recognized\r\nhim I may mention the worthy superior of the Ursuline convent, Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges, for whom, by the bye, you have done a masterpiece.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, yes,” said the marquis, “a pretty thing, and if you turn out as\r\nwell in politics--”\r\n\r\n“Well, marquis,” interrupted Jacques Bricheteau, who seemed to me\r\ninclined to manage the affair, “are you ready to proceed with our young\r\nfriend to the verification of the documents?”\r\n\r\n“That is unnecessary,” I remarked, and did not think that by this\r\nrefusal I pledged my faith too much; for, after all, what signify papers\r\nin the hands of a man who might have forged them or stolen them? But my\r\nfather would not consent; and for more than two hours they spread before\r\nme parchments, genealogical trees, contracts, patents, documents of all\r\nkinds, from which it appeared that the family of Sallenauve is, after\r\nthat of Cinq-Cygne, the most ancient family in the department of\r\nthe Aube. I ought to add that the exhibition of these archives was\r\naccompanied by an infinite number of spoken details which seemed to make\r\nthe identity of the Marquis de Sallenauve indisputable. On all other\r\nsubjects my father is laconic; his mental capacity does not seem to me\r\nremarkable, and he willingly allowed his _mouthpiece_ to talk for him.\r\nBut here, in the matter of his parchments, he was loquaciously full of\r\nanecdotes, recollections, heraldic knowledge; in short, he was exactly\r\nthe old noble, ignorant and superficial in all things, but possessed of\r\nBenedictine erudition where the genealogy of his family was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe _session_ would, I believe, be still going on, if Jacques Bricheteau\r\nhad not intervened. As the marquis was preparing to read a voluminous\r\nmemorandum refuting a chapter in Tallemant des Reaux’ “Historiettes”\r\n which did not redound to the credit of the great house of Sallenauve,\r\nthe wise organist remarked that it was time we dined, if we intended\r\nto keep an appointment already made for seven o’clock at the office of\r\nMaitre Achille Pigoult the notary.\r\n\r\nWe dined, not at the table-d’hote, but in private, and the dinner seemed\r\nvery long on account of the silent preoccupation of the marquis, and the\r\nslowness with which, owing to his loss of teeth, he swallowed his food.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock we went to the notary’s office; but as it is now two\r\no’clock in the morning, and I am heavy with sleep, I shall put off till\r\nto-morrow an account of what happened there.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 4, 5 A.M.\r\n\r\nI reckoned on peaceful slumbers, embellished by dreams. On the contrary,\r\nI did not sleep an hour, and I have waked up stung to the heart by an\r\nodious thought. But before I transmit that thought to you, I must tell\r\nyou what happened at the notary’s.\r\n\r\nMaitre Achille Pigoult, a puny little man, horribly pitted with the\r\nsmall-pox, and afflicted with green spectacles, above which he darts\r\nglances of vivacious intelligence, asked us if we felt warm enough, the\r\nroom having no fire. Politeness required us to say yes, although he had\r\nalready given signs of incendiarism by striking a match, when, from a\r\ndistant and dark corner of the room, a broken, feeble voice, the\r\nowner of which we had not as yet perceived, interposed to prevent the\r\nprodigality.\r\n\r\n“No, Achille, no, don’t make a fire,” said an old man. “There are five\r\nin the room, and the lamp gives out a good heat; before long the room\r\nwould be too hot to bear.”\r\n\r\nHearing these words, the marquis exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n“Ah! this is the good Monsieur Pigoult, formerly justice of the peace.”\r\n\r\nThus recognized, the old man rose and went up to my father, into whose\r\nface he peered.\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu_!” he cried, “I recognize you for a Champagnard of the\r\n_vieille roche_. Achille did not deceive me in declaring that I should\r\nsee two of my former acquaintances. You,” he said, addressing the\r\norganist, “you are little Bricheteau, the nephew of our good abbess,\r\nMother Marie-des-Anges; but as for that tall skeleton, looking like\r\na duke and peer, I can’t recall his name. However, I don’t blame my\r\nmemory; after eighty-six years’ service it may well be rusty.”\r\n\r\n“Come, grandfather,” said Achille Pigoult, “brush up your memory; and\r\nyou, gentlemen, not a word, not a gesture. I want to be clear in my own\r\nmind. I have not the honor to know the client for whom I am asked to\r\ndraw certain deeds, and I must, as a matter of legal regularity, have\r\nhim identified.”\r\n\r\nWhile his son spoke, the old man was evidently straining his memory.\r\nMy father, fortunately, has a nervous twitching of the face, which\r\nincreased under the fixed gaze his _certifier_ fastened upon him.\r\n\r\n“Hey! _parbleu_! I have it!” he cried. “Monsieur is the Marquise de\r\nSallenauve, whom we used to call the ‘Grimacer,’ and who would now be\r\nthe owner of the Chateau d’Arcis if, instead of wandering off, like\r\nthe other fools, into emigration, he had stayed at home and married his\r\npretty cousin.”\r\n\r\n“You are still _sans-culotte_, it seems,” said the marquis, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said the notary, gravely, “the proof I had arranged for\r\nmyself is conclusive. This proof, together with the title-deeds and\r\ndocuments Monsieur le marquis has shown to me, and which he deposits in\r\nmy hands, together with the certificate of identity sent to me by Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges, who cannot, under the rules of her Order, come to\r\nmy office, are sufficient for the execution of the deeds which I have\r\nhere--already prepared. The presence of two witnesses is required for\r\none of them. Monsieur Bricheteau will, of course, be the witness on your\r\nside and on the other my father, if agreeable to you; it is an honor\r\nthat, as I think, belongs to him of right, for, as one may say, this\r\nmatter has revived his memory.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, messieurs, let us proceed,” said Jacques Bricheteau,\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\nThe notary sat down at his desk; the rest of us sat in a circle around\r\nhim, and the reading of the first document began. Its purport\r\nwas to establish, authentically, the recognition made by\r\nFrancois-Henri-Pantaleon Dumirail, Marquis de Sallenauve, of me, his\r\nson. But in the course of the reading a difficulty came up. Notarial\r\ndeeds must, under pain of being null and void, state the domicile of all\r\ncontracting parties. Now, where was my father’s domicile? This part had\r\nbeen left in blank by the notary, who now insisted on filling it before\r\nproceeding farther.\r\n\r\n“As for this domicile,” said Achille Pigoult, “Monsieur le marquis\r\nappears to have none in France, as he does not reside in this country,\r\nand has owned no property here for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said the marquis, seeming to put more meaning into his\r\nwords than they naturally carried, “I am a mere vagabond in France.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Jacques Bricheteau, “vagabonds like you, who can present\r\ntheir sons with the necessary sums to buy estates, are not to be pitied.\r\nStill, the remark is a just one, not only as to France, but as to your\r\nresidence in foreign countries. With your eternal mania for roving, it\r\nis really very difficult to assign you a domicile.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Achille Pigoult, “it does not seem worth while to let so\r\nsmall a matter stop us. Monsieur,” he continued, motioning to me, “is\r\nnow the owner of the Chateau d’Arcis, for an engagement to sell is as\r\ngood as the sale itself. What more natural, therefore, than that\r\nthe father’s domicile should be stated as being on his son’s estate,\r\nespecially as this is really the family property now returned into\r\nthe hands of the family, being purchased by the father for the son,\r\nparticularly as that father is known and recognized by some of the\r\noldest and most important inhabitants of the place?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is true,” said old Pigoult, adopting his son’s opinion\r\nwithout hesitation.\r\n\r\n“In short,” said Jacques Bricheteau, “you think the matter can go on.”\r\n\r\n“You see that my father, a man of great experience, did not hesitate to\r\nagree with me. We say, therefore,” continued the notary, taking up\r\nhis pen, “Francois-Henri-Pantaleon Dumirail, Marquis de Sallenauve,\r\ndomiciled with Monsieur Charles de Sallenauve, his natural son, by\r\nhim legally recognized, in the house known as the Chateau d’Arcis,\r\narrondissement of Arcis-sur-Aube, department of the Aube.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the deed was read and executed without comment.\r\n\r\nThen followed a rather ridiculous scene.\r\n\r\n“Now, Monsieur le comte,” said Jacques Bricheteau, “embrace your\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\nThe marquis opened his arms rather indifferently, and I coldly fell into\r\nthem, vexed with myself for not being deeply moved and for not hearing\r\nin my heart the voice of kindred. Was this barrenness of emotion the\r\nresult of my sudden accession to wealth? A moment later a second deed\r\nmade me possessor, on payment of one hundred and eighty thousand francs\r\nin ready money, of the Chateau d’Arcis,--a grand edifice which had\r\ncaught my eye, on my first arrival in the town, by its lordly and feudal\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“You may congratulate yourselves,” said Achille Pigoult, “that you have\r\ngot that estate for a song.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come!” said Jacques Bricheteau, “how long have you had it on\r\nyour hands to sell? Your client would have let it go for one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand to others, but, as family property, you thought you could\r\nget more from us. We shall have to spend twenty thousand to make the\r\nhouse habitable; the land doesn’t return a rental of more than four\r\nthousand; so that our money, all expenses deducted, won’t return us more\r\nthan two and a half per cent.”\r\n\r\n“What are you complaining about?” returned Achille Pigoult. “You have\r\nemployment to give and money to pay in the neighborhood, and what can be\r\nbetter for a candidate?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that electoral business,” said Jacques Bricheteau; “we will talk\r\nabout that to-morrow when we bring you the purchase-money and your\r\nfees.”\r\n\r\nThereupon we took leave, and returned to the Hotel de la Poste, where I\r\nbade good-night to my father and came to my room to write to you.\r\n\r\nNow I must tell you the terrible idea that drove sleep from my brain\r\nand put the pen once more in my hand,--although I am somewhat distracted\r\nfrom it by writing the foregoing two pages, and I do not see quite as\r\nmuch evidence for my notion as I did before I renewed this letter.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: during the last year many romantic incidents have\r\nhappened to me. You may say that adventure seems to be the logical way\r\nof life for one in my position; that my birth, the chances that brought\r\nyou (whose fate is so like mine) and me together, my relations with\r\nMarianina and my handsome housekeeper, and perhaps I might say with\r\nMadame de l’Estorade, all point to the possession of a fickle star, and\r\nthat my present affair is only one of its caprices.\r\n\r\nTrue; but what if, at the present moment under the influence of that\r\nstar, I were implicated without my knowledge in some infernal plot of\r\nwhich I was made the passive instrument?\r\n\r\nTo put some order into my ideas, I begin by this half-million spent for\r\nan interest which you must agree is very nebulous,--that of fitting me\r\nto succeed my father in the ministry of some imaginary country, the name\r\nof which is carefully concealed from me.\r\n\r\nNext: who is spending these fabulous sums on me? Is it a father tenderly\r\nattached to a child of love? No, it is a father who shows me the\r\nutmost coldness, who goes to sleep when deeds which concern our mutual\r\nexistence are being drawn, and for whom I, on my side, am conscious of\r\nno feeling; in fact, not to mince my words, I should think him a great\r\nbooby of an _emigre_ if it were not for the filial respect and duty I\r\nforce myself to feel for him.\r\n\r\n_But_--suppose this man were not my father, not even the Marquis de\r\nSallenauve, as he asserts himself to be; suppose, like that unfortunate\r\nLucien de Rubempre, whose history has made so much noise, I were caught\r\nin the toils of a serpent like that false abbe Don Carlos Herrera, and\r\nhad made myself liable to the same awful awakening. You may say to me\r\nthat you see no such likelihood; that Carlos Herrera had an object in\r\nfascinating Lucien and making him his double; but that I, an older man\r\nwith solid principles and no love of luxury, who have lived a life of\r\nthought and toil, should fear such influence, is nonsense.\r\n\r\nSo be it. But why should the man who recognizes me as his son conceal\r\nthe very country in which he lives, and the name by which he is known\r\nin that equally nameless Northern land which it is intimated that he\r\ngoverns? Why make such sacrifices for my benefit and show so little\r\nconfidence? And see the mystery with which Jacques Bricheteau has\r\nsurrounded my life! Do you think that that long-winded explanation of\r\nhis explained it?\r\n\r\nAll this, my dear friend, rolling in my head and clashing with that\r\nhalf-million already paid to me, has given substance to a strange idea,\r\nat which you may perhaps laugh, but which, nevertheless, is not without\r\nprecedent in criminal annals.\r\n\r\nI told you just now that this thought invaded me as it were suddenly;\r\nit came like an instinct upon me. Assuredly, if I had had the faintest\r\ninkling of it last evening, I would have cut off my right hand sooner\r\nthan sign that deed by which I have henceforth bound my fate to that\r\nof an unknown man whose past and future may be as gloomy as a canto of\r\nDante’s Hell, and who may drag me down with him into utter darkness.\r\n\r\nIn short, this idea--round which I am making you circle because I cannot\r\nbring myself to let you enter it--here it is, in all its crudity; I\r\nam afraid of being, without my knowledge, the agent, the tool of those\r\nassociations of false coiners who are known in criminal records to\r\nconcoct schemes as complicated and mysterious as the one I am now\r\ninvolved in, in order to put into circulation the money they coin. In\r\nall such cases you will find great coming and going of accomplices;\r\ncheques drawn from a distance on the bankers in great commercial\r\ncentres like Paris, Stockholm, Rotterdam. Often one hears of poor dupes\r\ncompromised. In short, do you not see in the mysterious ways of this\r\nBricheteau something like an imitation, a reflection of the manoeuvres\r\nto which these criminal workers are forced to have recourse, arranging\r\nthem with a talent and a richness of imagination to which a novelist can\r\nscarcely attain?\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: there is about me a thick unwholesome atmosphere,\r\nin which I feel that air is lacking and I cannot breathe. However,\r\nassure me, if you can, persuade me, I ask no better, that this is all an\r\nempty dream. But in any case I am determined to have a full explanation\r\nwith these two men to-morrow, and to obtain, although so late, more\r\nlight than they have yet doled out to me....\r\n\r\nAnother and yet stranger fact! As I wrote those last words, a noise of\r\nhorses’ hoofs came from the street. Distrustful now of everything, I\r\nopened my window, and in the dawning light I saw a travelling carriage\r\nbefore the door of the inn, the postilion in the saddle, and Jacques\r\nBricheteau talking to some one who was seated in the vehicle. Deciding\r\nquickly on my action, I ran rapidly downstairs; but before I reached the\r\nbottom I heard the roll of wheels and the cracking of the postilion’s\r\nwhip. At the foot of the staircase I came face to face with Jacques\r\nBricheteau. Without seeming embarrassed, in fact with the most natural\r\nair in the world, he said to me,--\r\n\r\n“What! my dear ward already up?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; the least I could do was to say farewell to my excellent\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\n“He did not wish it,” replied that damned musician, with an\r\nimperturbability and phlegm that deserved a thrashing; “he feared the\r\nemotions of parting.”\r\n\r\n“Is he so dreadfully hurried that he could not even give a day to his\r\nnew and ardent paternity?”\r\n\r\n“The truth is, he is an original; what he came to do, he has done; after\r\nthat, to his mind, there is nothing to stay for.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I understand; he hastens to those high functions he performs at\r\nthat Northern court!”\r\n\r\nJacques Bricheteau could no longer mistake the ironical tone in which\r\nthese words were said.\r\n\r\n“Until now,” he said, “you have shown more faith.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I confess that faith begins to stagger under the weight of the\r\nmysteries with which it is loaded down without relief.”\r\n\r\n“Seeing you at this decisive moment in your career giving way to doubts\r\nwhich our whole conduct pursued to you through many years ought to\r\nrefute, I should be almost in despair,” replied Jacques Bricheteau, “if\r\nI had none but personal denials and asseverations to offer you. But, as\r\nyou will remember, old Pigoult spoke of an aunt of mine, living in this\r\nneighborhood, where you will soon, I hope, find her position a most\r\nhonorable one. I had arranged that you should see her in the course of\r\nthe day; but now, if you will grant me the time to shave, I will take\r\nyou at once, early as it is, to the convent of the Ursulines. There you\r\nshall question Mother Marie-des-Anges, who has the reputation of a saint\r\nthroughout this whole department, and I think that at the close of your\r\ninterview with her no doubt can remain upon your mind.”\r\n\r\nWhile that devil of a man was speaking, his countenance had so perfect a\r\nlook of integrity and benevolence, his speech, always calm, elegant,\r\nand self-possessed, so impressed the mind of his hearer, that I felt the\r\ntide of my anger going down and my sense of security rising.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his answer _is_ irresistible. The convent of the Ursuline\r\nsisters--heavens and earth! that can’t be the rendezvous of makers of\r\nfalse coin; and if the Mother Marie-des-Anges guarantees my father\r\nto me, as it appears she has already done to the notary, I should be\r\nfoolish indeed to persist in my doubts.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” I said to Jacques Bricheteau, “I will go up and get my hat\r\nand walk up and down the bank of the river until you are ready.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right; and be sure you watch the door of the hotel to see that\r\nI do not give you the slip as I did once upon a time on the Quai de\r\nBethune.”\r\n\r\nImpossible to be more intelligent than that man; he seems to divine\r\none’s thoughts. I was ashamed of this last doubt of mine, and told him\r\nthat, on the whole, I would go and finish a letter while awaiting him.\r\nIt was this letter, dear friend, which I must now close if I wish it to\r\ngo by to-day’s post. I will write you soon of my visit to the convent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. MARIE-GASTON TO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE\r\n\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, May 6, 1839.\r\n\r\nMadame,--In any case I should gladly have profited by the request you\r\nwere so good as to make that I should write to you during my stay in\r\nthis town; but in granting me this favor you could not really know the\r\nfull extent of your charity. Without you, madame, and the consolation\r\nof writing to you sometimes, what would become of me under the habitual\r\nweight of my sad thoughts in a town which has neither society, nor\r\ncommerce, nor curiosities, nor environs; and where all intellectual\r\nactivity spends itself on the making of pickled pork, soap-grease,\r\nstockings, and cotton night-caps. Dorlange, whom I shall not long call\r\nby that name (you shall presently know why) is so absorbed in steering\r\nhis electoral frigate that I scarcely see him.\r\n\r\nI told you, madame, that I resolved to come down here and join our\r\nmutual friend in consequence of a certain trouble of mind apparent in\r\none of his letters, which informed me of a great revolution taking place\r\nin his life. I am able to-day to be more explicit. Dorlange at last\r\nknows his father. He is the natural son of the Marquis de Sallenauve,\r\nthe last living scion of one of the best families in Champagne. Without\r\nexplaining the reasons which have hitherto induced him to keep his son’s\r\nbirth secret, the marquis has now recognized him legally. He has\r\nalso bought and presented to him an estate formerly belonging to the\r\nSallenauve family. This estate is situated in Arcis itself, and its\r\npossession will assist the project of our friend’s election. That\r\nproject dates much farther back than we thought; and it did not take its\r\nrise in the fancy of Dorlange.\r\n\r\nA year ago, the marquis began to prepare for it by sending his son a sum\r\nof money for the purchase of real estate in conformity with electoral\r\nlaws; and it is also for the furtherance of this purpose that he has now\r\nmade him doubly a landowner. The real object of all these sacrifices not\r\nseeming plain to Charles de Sallenauve, doubts have arisen in his mind,\r\nand it was to assist in dispelling them that my friendship for the poor\r\nfellow brought me here.\r\n\r\nThe marquis appears to be as odd and whimsical as he is opulent; for,\r\ninstead of remaining in Arcis, where his presence and his name would\r\ncontribute to the success of the election he desires, the very day after\r\nlegal formalities attending the recognition of his son had been complied\r\nwith, he departed furtively for foreign countries, where he says he has\r\nimportant interests, without so much as taking leave of his son. This\r\ncoldness has poisoned the happiness Charles would otherwise feel in\r\nthese events; but one must take fathers as they are, for Dorlange and I\r\nare living proofs that all cannot have them as they want them.\r\n\r\nAnother eccentricity of the marquis is the choice he has made, as chief\r\nassistant in his son’s election, of an old Ursuline nun, with whom\r\nhe seems to have made a bargain, in which, strange to say, you have\r\nunconsciously played a part. Yes, madame, the Saint-Ursula for which,\r\nunknown to yourself, you were posing, will have, to all appearances, a\r\nconsiderable influence on the election of our friend. The case is this:\r\n\r\nFor many years Mother Marie-des-Anges, superior of the Ursuline convent\r\nat Arcis-sur-Aube, has desired to install in the chapel of her convent\r\nan image of its patron saint. But this abbess, who is a woman of taste\r\nand intelligence, would not listen to the idea of one of those stock\r\nfigures which can be bought ready-made from the venders of church\r\ndecorations. On the other hand, she thought it was robbing her poor to\r\nspend on this purpose the large sum necessary to procure a work of art.\r\nThe nephew of this excellent woman is an organist in Paris to whom the\r\nMarquis de Sallenauve, then in emigration, had confided the care of his\r\nson. When it became a question of making Charles a deputy, the marquis\r\nnaturally thought of Arcis, a place where his family had left so many\r\nmemories. The organist also recollected his aunt’s desire; he knew\r\nhow influential she was in that region because of her saintliness, and\r\nhaving in his nature a touch of that intrigue which likes to undertake\r\nthings difficult and arduous, he went to see her, with the approval of\r\nthe Marquis de Sallenauve, and let her know that one of the most skilful\r\nsculptors in Paris was ready to make her the statue of Saint-Ursula\r\nif she, on her side, would promise to secure the artist’s election as\r\ndeputy from the arrondissement of Arcis.\r\n\r\nThe old nun did not think the undertaking beyond her powers. She now\r\npossesses the object of her pious longings; the statue arrived some days\r\nago, and is already in the chapel of the convent, where she proposes to\r\ngive it, before long, a solemn inauguration. It now remains to be seen\r\nwhether the good nun will perform her part of the contract.\r\n\r\nWell, madame, strange to say, after hearing and inquiring into the whole\r\nmatter I shall not be surprised if this remarkable woman should\r\ncarry the day. From the description our friend gives of her, Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges is a small woman, short and thick-set, whose face\r\nis prepossessing and agreeable beneath its wrinkles and the mask of\r\nsaffron-tinted pallor which time and the austerities of a cloister have\r\nplaced upon it. Carrying very lightly the weight of her corpulence and\r\nalso that of her seventy-six years, she is lively, alert, and frisky\r\nto a degree that shames the youngest of us. For fifty years she has\r\ngoverned in a masterly manner her community, which has always been the\r\nmost regular, the best organized, and also the richest society in the\r\ndiocese of Troyes. Admirably fitted for the training of youth, she\r\nhas long conducted a school for girls, which is famous throughout the\r\ndepartment of the Aube and adjacent regions. Having thus superintended\r\nthe education of nearly all the daughters of the best houses in the\r\nprovince, it is easy to imagine the influence she has acquired among the\r\naristocracy,--an influence she probably intends to use in the electoral\r\nstruggle she has promised to take part in.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it appears that this really extraordinary woman\r\nis the sovereign disposer of the votes of the democratic party in the\r\narrondissement of Arcis. Until now, the existence of that party in Arcis\r\nhas been considered problematical; but it is actually, by its nature,\r\nactive and stirring, and our candidate proposes to present himself\r\nunder its banner. Evidently, therefore, the support the good mother has\r\npromised will be useful and important.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will admire with me the--as one might say--bicephalous\r\nability of this old nun, who has managed to keep well with the nobility\r\nand the secular clergy on the one hand, and on the other to lead with\r\nher wand the radical party, their sworn enemy. Admirable for her charity\r\nand her lucid intellect, respected throughout the region as a saint,\r\nexposed during the Revolution to a dreadful persecution, which she bore\r\nwith rare courage, one can easily understand her close relations with\r\nthe upper and conservative classes; but why she should be equally\r\nwelcome to democrats and to the subverters of order would seem, at\r\nfirst, to pass all belief.\r\n\r\nThe power which she undoubtedly wields over the revolutionary party took\r\nits rise, madame, in a struggle which they formerly had together. In\r\n1793 that amiable party were bent on cutting her throat. Driven from\r\nher convent, and convicted of harboring a “refractory” priest, she was\r\nincarcerated, arraigned before the Revolutionary tribunal, and condemned\r\nto death. The matter was reported to Danton, a native of Arcis, and\r\nthen a member of the National Convention. Danton had known Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges; he thought her the most virtuous and enlightened woman\r\nhe had ever met. Hearing of her condemnation, he was furiously angry,\r\nand wrote, as they said in those days, a high-horse letter to the\r\nRevolutionary tribunal, and, with an authority no human being in Arcis\r\nwould have dared to contest, he ordered a reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe same day he mounted the tribune, and after speaking in general terms\r\nof the “bloody boobies” who by their foolish fury compromised the future\r\nof the Revolution, he told who and what Mother Marie-des-Anges really\r\nwas; he dwelt on her marvellous aptitude for the training of youth, and\r\nhe presented a scheme in which she was placed at the head of a “grand\r\nnational gynaecium,” the organization of which was to be made the\r\nsubject of another decree. Robespierre, who would have thought the\r\nintellect of an Ursuline nun only a more imperative reason for bringing\r\nher under the revolutionary axe, was absent that day from the\r\nsession, and the motion was voted with enthusiasm. The head of Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges being indispensably necessary to the carrying out of\r\nthis decree of the sovereign people, she kept it on her shoulders, and\r\nthe headsman put aside his machine.\r\n\r\nThough the other decree, organising the Grand National Gynaecium,\r\nwas lost sight of in the many other duties that devolved upon the\r\nConvention, the excellent nun carried it out after her fashion. Instead\r\nof something grand and Greek and national, she started in Arcis a\r\nsecular girl’s-school, and as soon as a little quiet was restored to the\r\nminds of the community, pupils flocked in from all quarters. Under the\r\nEmpire Mother Marie-des-Anges was able to reconstitute her Ursuline\r\nsisterhood, and the first act of her restored authority was a\r\nrecognition of gratitude. She decreed that on every year on the 5th of\r\nApril, the anniversary of Danton’s death, a service should be held\r\nin the chapel of the convent for the repose of his soul. To those who\r\nobjected to this edict she answered: “Do you know many for whom it is\r\nmore necessary to implore God’s mercy?”\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration, the celebration of this service became a sort of\r\nscandal; but Mother Marie-des-Anges would never hear of suppressing it,\r\nand the great veneration which has always surrounded her obliged these\r\ncavillers to hold their tongues. This courageous obstinacy had its\r\nreward, under the government of July. To-day Mother Marie-des-Anges is\r\nhigh in court favor, and there is nothing she cannot obtain in the\r\nmost august regions of power; but it is only just to add that she asks\r\nnothing,--not even for her charities, for she provides the means to do\r\nthem nobly by the wise manner in which she administers the property of\r\nher convent.\r\n\r\nHer gratitude, thus openly shown to the memory of the great\r\nrevolutionist, has been of course to the revolutionary party a potent\r\nrecommendation, but not the only one.\r\n\r\nIn Arcis the leader of the advanced Left is a rich miller named Laurent\r\nGoussard, who possesses two or three mills on the river Aube. This man,\r\nformerly a member of the revolutionary municipality of Arcis and the\r\nintimate friend of Danton, was the one who wrote to the latter telling\r\nhim that the axe was suspended over the throat of the ex-superior of the\r\nUrsulines. This, however, did not prevent the worthy _sans-culotte_\r\nfrom buying up the greater part of the convent property when it was sold\r\nunder the name of national domain.\r\n\r\nAt the period when Mother Marie-des-Anges was authorized to reconstitute\r\nher community, Laurent Goussard, who had not made much by his purchase,\r\nwent to see the good abbess, and proposed to her to buy back the former\r\nproperty of her convent. Very shrewd in business, Laurent Goussard,\r\nwhose niece Mother Marie-des-Anges had educated gratuitously, seemed to\r\npique himself on the great liberality of his offer, the terms of\r\nwhich were that the sisterhood should reimburse him the amount of his\r\npurchase-money. The dear man was not however making a bad bargain, for\r\nthe difference in the value of assignats with which he had paid and\r\nthe good sound money he would receive made a pretty profit. But Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges, remembering that without his warning Danton could not\r\nhave saved her, did better still for her first helper. At the time when\r\nLaurent Goussard made his offer the community of the Ursulines was,\r\nfinancially speaking, in an excellent position. Having since its\r\nrestoration received many liberal gifts, it was also enriched by the\r\nsavings of its superior, made from the proceeds of her secular school,\r\nwhich she generously made over to the common fund. Laurent Goussard must\r\ntherefore have been thunderstruck when he read the following letter:--\r\n\r\n  Your proposal does not suit me. My conscience will not allow me to\r\n  buy property below its proper value. Before the Revolution the\r\n  property of our abbey was estimated at--[so much]. That is the\r\n  price I choose to give, and not that to which it has fallen since\r\n  the great depreciation of all property called national. In a word,\r\n  my friend, I wish to pay you more than you ask; let me know if\r\n  that suits you.\r\n\r\nLaurent Goussard thought at first that either she had misunderstood him\r\nor he her. But when it became clear to him that owing to these pretended\r\nscruples of Mother Marie-des-Anges, he was the gainer of fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, he would not do violence to so tender a conscience, and he\r\npocketed this profit (which came to him literally from heaven), but he\r\nwent about relating everywhere the marvellous proceeding, which, as you\r\ncan well imagine, put Mother Marie-des-Anges on a pinnacle of respect\r\n(especially from the holders of other national property) which leaves\r\nher nothing to fear from any future revolution. Personally Laurent\r\nGoussard has become her slave, her henchman. He does no business, he\r\ntakes no step, he never moves a sack of flour without going to her for\r\nadvice; and, as she said in joke the other day, if she took a fancy to\r\nmake a John the Baptist of the sub-prefect, Laurent Goussard would bring\r\nher his head on a charger. That is proof enough that he will also bring\r\nhis vote and that of his friends to any candidate she may favor.\r\n\r\nAmong the clergy Mother Marie-des-Anges has, naturally, many\r\naffiliations,--as much on account of her high reputation for goodness as\r\nfor the habit of her order, but she particularly counts among the\r\nnumber of her most zealous servitors Monseigneur Troubert, bishop of the\r\ndiocese, who, though formerly a familiar of the Congregation [see “The\r\nVicar of Tours”], has nevertheless managed to secure from the dynasty of\r\nJuly an archbishopric which will lead to a cardinalship.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the clergy you have, or you are very near having, the\r\nlegitimist party with you,--a party which, while passionately desirous\r\nof free education and filled with hatred for the July throne, is not\r\naverse, when occasion offers, to yielding to a monstrous union with\r\nthe radical party. Now the head of the legitimists in Arcis and its\r\nneighborhood is, of course, the family of Cinq-Cygne. Never does the old\r\nmarquise, whose haughty nature and powerful will you, madame, know well\r\n[see “An Historical Mystery”],--never does she drive into Arcis from her\r\nchateau of Cinq-Cygne, without paying a visit to Mother Marie-des-Anges,\r\nwho in former days educated her daughter Berthe, now the Duchesse\r\nGeorges de Maufrigneuse.\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the most opposing and resisting side,--that of\r\nthe conservatives, which must not be confounded with the party of the\r\nadministration. Here we find as its leader the Comte de Gondreville,\r\nyour husband’s colleague in the Chamber of peers. Closely allied to the\r\ncount is a very influential man, his old friend Grevin, formerly mayor\r\nand notary of Arcis, who, in turn, draws after him another elector of\r\nconsiderable influence, Maitre Achille Pigoult, to whom, on retiring\r\nfrom active life, he sold his practice as notary.\r\n\r\nBut Mother Marie-des-Anges has a powerful means of access to the Comte\r\nde Gondreville through his daughter, the Marechale de Carigliano. That\r\ngreat lady, who, as you know, has taken to devotion, goes into retreat\r\nevery year at the Ursuline convent. More than that, the good Mother,\r\nwithout giving any explanation, intimates that she has a lever of some\r\nkind on the Comte de Gondreville known to herself only; in fact, the\r\nlife of that old regicide--turned senator, then count of the Empire,\r\nthen peer of France under two dynasties--has wormed itself through too\r\nmany tortuous underground ways not to allow us to suppose the existence\r\nof secrets he might not care to have unmasked.\r\n\r\nNow Gondreville is Grevin,--his confidant, and, as they say, his tool,\r\nhis catspaw for the last fifty years. But even supposing that by\r\nan utter impossibility their close union should, under present\r\ncircumstances, be sundered, we are certainly sure of Achille Pigoult,\r\nGrevin’s successor, on whom, when the purchase of the chateau d’Arcis\r\nwas made in his office by the Marquis de Sallenauve, a fee was bestowed\r\nof such an unusual amount that to accept it was virtually to pledge\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAs for the ruck of the electors, our friend cannot fail to make recruits\r\nthere, by the work he is about to give in repairing the chateau, which,\r\nfortunately for him, is falling into ruin in several places. We must\r\nalso count on the manifesto which Charles de Sallenauve has just issued,\r\nin which he openly declares that he will accept neither favors\r\nnor employment from the government. So that, really, taking into\r\nconsideration his own oratorical talent, the support of the Opposition\r\njournals both here and in Paris, the insults and calumnies which the\r\nministerial journals are already beginning to fire upon him, I feel\r\ngreat hopes of his success.\r\n\r\nForgive me for presenting to you in glowing colors the parliamentary\r\nfuture of a man of whom, you said to me the other day, you felt\r\nyou could not safely make a friend, because of the lofty and rather\r\nimpertinent assumption of his personality. To tell the truth, madame,\r\nwhatever political success may be in store for Charles de Sallenauve,\r\nI fear he may one day regret the calmer fame of which he was already\r\nassured in the world of art. But neither he nor I was born under an\r\neasy and accommodating star. Birth has been a costly thing to us; it is\r\ntherefore doubly cruel not to like us. You have been kind to me because\r\nyou fancy that a lingering fragrance of our dear Louise still clings to\r\nme; give something, I beseech you, of the same kindness to him whom I\r\nhave not hesitated in this letter to call our friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. MARIE-GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE\r\n\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, May 13, 1839.\r\n\r\nMadame,--I see that the electoral fever is upon you, as you are good\r\nenough to send me from Monsieur de l’Estorade so many _discouragements_\r\nwhich certainly deserve consideration.\r\n\r\nWe knew already of the mission given to Comte Maxime de Trailles,--a\r\nmission he endeavored at first to conceal under some irrigating project.\r\nWe even know what you, madame, seem not to know,--that this able\r\nministerial agent has found means to combine with the cares of electoral\r\npolitics those of his own private policy. Monsieur Maxime de Trailles,\r\nif we are rightly informed, was on the point of succumbing to the\r\nchronic malady with which he has been so long afflicted; I mean _debt_.\r\nNot debts, for we say “the debt of Monsieur de Trailles,” as we say\r\n“the debt of England.” In this extremity the patient, resolved on\r\nheroic remedies, adopted that of marriage, which might perhaps be called\r\nmarriage _in extremis_.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short, Monsieur de Trailles was sent to Arcis to\r\nput an end to the candidacy of an upstart of the Left centre, a certain\r\nSimon Giguet; and having brought forward the mayor of the town as\r\nthe ministerial candidate, he finds the said mayor, named Beauvisage,\r\npossessed of an only daughter, rather pretty, and able to bring\r\nher husband five hundred thousand francs amassed in the honorable\r\nmanufacture of cotton night-caps. Now you see, I am sure, the mechanism\r\nof the affair.\r\n\r\nAs for our own claims, we certainly do not make cotton night-caps, but\r\nwe make statues,--statues for which we are decorated with the Legion of\r\nhonor; religious statues, inaugurated with great pomp by Monseigneur the\r\nbishop of the diocese and all the constituted authorities; statues, or\r\nrather _a_ statue, which the whole population of the town has flocked\r\nto the Ursuline convent to behold, where Mesdames the nuns, not a little\r\npuffed up with this magnificent addition to their bijou of a chapel,\r\nhave kept their house and their oratory open to all comers for this\r\nwhole day. Is not that likely to popularize our candidacy?\r\n\r\nThis evening, to crown the ceremony of inaugurating our Saint-Ursula,\r\nwe give in our chateau of Arcis a banquet to fifty guests, among whom we\r\nhave had the malice to invite (with the chief inhabitants of the place)\r\nall the ministerial functionaries and, above all, the ministerial\r\ncandidate. But, in view of our own declared candidacy, we feel pretty\r\nwell assured that the latter will not respond to the invitation. So much\r\nthe better! more room for others; and the missing guests, whose names\r\nwill be made known on the morrow, will be convicted of a _servilism_\r\nwhich will, we think, injure their influence with the population.\r\n\r\nYesterday we paid a visit at the chateau de Cinq-Cygne, where d’Arthez\r\npresented us, in the first place, to the Princesse de Cadignan, who is\r\nwonderfully well preserved. Both she and the old Marquise de Cinq-Cygne\r\nreceived Dorlange--I should say, Sallenauve--in the warmest manner.\r\nIt was from them that we learned the history of Monsieur Maxime de\r\nTrailles’ mission and its present results. It seems that on his arrival\r\nthe ministerial agent received some attentions at Cinq-Cygne,--mere\r\nfloating sticks, to discover the set of his current. He evidently\r\nflattered himself that he should find support at Cinq-Cygne for his\r\nelectioneering intrigue; which is so far from being the case that Duc\r\nGeorges de Maufrigneuse, to whom, as a Jockey Club comrade, he told all\r\nhis projects, gave us the information about them which I have now given\r\nto you, and which, if you will be so kind, I should like you to make\r\nover to Monsieur de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 12th.\r\n\r\nThe dinner has taken place, madame; it was magnificently served, and\r\nArcis will talk about it for some time to come. Sallenauve has in\r\nthat great organist (who, by the bye, showed his talent on the organ\r\nadmirably during the ceremony of inauguration) a sort of steward and\r\nfactotum who leaves all the Vatels of the world far behind him; he\r\nwould never have fallen on his sword for lack of a fish! Colored lamps,\r\ngarlands, draperies, decorated the dining-room; even fireworks were\r\nprovided; nothing was wanting to the fete, which lasted to a late hour\r\nin the gardens of the chateau, where the populace danced and drank to\r\nits heart’s content.\r\n\r\nNearly all the invited guests came except those we desired to\r\ncompromise. The invitations having been sent at short notice, it was\r\namusing to read the notes and letters of excuse, which Sallenauve\r\nordered to be brought to him in the salon as they arrived. As he opened\r\neach he took care to say: “This is from Monsieur the sub-prefect; this\r\nfrom the _procureur-du-roi_; this from Monsieur Vinet the substitute,\r\nexpressing regret that they cannot accept the invitation.” All these\r\nconcerted refusals were received with smiles and whispers by the\r\ncompany; but when a letter arrived from Beauvisage, and Sallenauve read\r\naloud the “impossibility in which he found himself to _correspond_\r\nto his politeness,” the hilarity grew noisy and general, and was only\r\nstopped by the entrance of Monsieur Martener, examining judge, who\r\nperformed an act of courage in coming to the dinner which his colleagues\r\ndeclined. We must remark, however, than an examining-judge has two sides\r\nto him. On that of the judge he is irremovable; he can only be deprived\r\nof the slight increase of salary he receives as an examiner and of the\r\nprivilege of signing warrants and questioning thieves,--splendid rights\r\nof which the chancellor can mulct him by a stroke of his pen. But\r\nallowing that Monsieur Martener was only semi-brave, he was greeted on\r\nthis occasion as a full moon.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Maufrigneuse, d’Arthez, and Monseigneur the bishop, who was\r\nstaying at Cinq-Cygne for a few days, were all present, and this made\r\nmore noticeable the absence of one man, namely, Grevin, whose excuse,\r\nsent earlier in the day, was not read to the company. The non-appearance\r\nof the Comte de Gondreville was explained by the recent death of his\r\ngrandson, Charles Keller; and in sending the invitation Sallenauve had\r\nbeen careful to let him know he should understand a refusal. But that\r\nGrevin, the count’s right arm, should absent himself, seemed to show\r\nthat he and his patron were convinced of the probable election of\r\nBeauvisage, and would have no intercourse with the new candidate.\r\n\r\nThe dinner being given in honor of Saint-Ursula’s installation, which\r\ncould not be celebrated by a banquet in the convent, Sallenauve had a\r\nfine opportunity for the following toast:--\r\n\r\n“To the Mother of the poor; the noble and saintly spirit which, for\r\nfifty years, has shone on Champagne, and to which we owe the vast number\r\nof distinguished and accomplished women who adorn this beautiful region\r\nof our country.”\r\n\r\nIf you know, as I do, madame, what a forlorn, beggarly region Champagne\r\nis, you would say, or something like it, that Sallenauve is a rascally\r\nfellow, and that the passion to enter the legislature makes a man\r\ncapable of shocking deceit. Was it worth while, in fact, for a man who\r\nusually respects himself to boldly tell a lie of criminal dimensions,\r\nwhen a moment later a little unforeseen circumstance occurred which did\r\nmore than all the speeches ever uttered to commend him to the sympathy\r\nof the electors?\r\n\r\nYou told me, madame, that your son Armand found a strong likeness to\r\nthe portraits of Danton in our friend Sallenauve; and it seems that the\r\nboy’s remark was true, for several persons present who had known the\r\ngreat revolutionist during his lifetime made the same observation.\r\nLaurent Goussard, who, as I told you in a former letter, was Danton’s\r\nfriend, was also, in a way, his brother-in-law; for Danton, who was\r\nsomething of a gallant, had been on close terms for several years with\r\nthe miller’s sister. Well, the likeness must be striking, for after\r\ndinner, while we were taking our coffee, the worthy Goussard, whose\r\nhead was a little warmed by the fumes of wine, came up to Sallenauve\r\nand asked him whether he was certain he had made no mistake about his\r\nfather, and could honestly declare that Danton had nothing to do with\r\nhis making.\r\n\r\nSallenauve took the matter gaily, and answered arithmetically,--\r\n\r\n“Danton died April 5, 1794. To be his son, I must have been born no\r\nlater than January, 1795, which would make me forty-four years old\r\nto-day. But the register of my birth, and I somewhat hope my face, make\r\nme out exactly thirty.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are right,” said Laurent Goussard; “figures demolish my idea;\r\nbut no matter,--we’ll vote for you all the same.”\r\n\r\nI think the man is right; this chance resemblance is likely to have\r\ngreat weight in the election. You must remember, madame, that, in spite\r\nof the fatal facts which cling about his memory, Danton is not an object\r\nof horror and execration in Arcis, where he was born and brought up. In\r\nthe first place time has purged him; his grand character and powerful\r\nintellect remain, and the people are proud of their compatriot. In Arcis\r\nthey talk of Danton as in Marseilles they talk of Cannebiere. Fortunate,\r\ntherefore, is our candidate’s likeness to this demigod, the worship\r\nof whom is not confined to the town, but extends to the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThese voters _extra muros_ are sometimes curiously simple-minded, and\r\nobvious contradictions trouble them not at all. Some agents sent into\r\nthe adjacent districts have used this fancied resemblance; and as in a\r\nrural propaganda the object is less to strike fair than to strike hard,\r\nLaurent Goussard’s version, apocryphal as it is, is hawked about the\r\ncountry villages with a coolness that admits of no contradiction.\r\n\r\nWhile this pretended revolutionary origin is advancing our friend’s\r\nprospects in one direction, in another the tale put forth to the worthy\r\nvoters whom it is desirable to entice is different, but truer and not\r\nless striking to the minds of the country-people. This is the gentlemen,\r\nthey are told, who has bought the chateau of Arcis; and as the chateau\r\nof Arcis stands high above the town and is known to all the country\r\nround, it is to these simple folk a species of symbol. They are always\r\nready to return to memories of the past, which is much less dead and\r\nburied than people suppose; “Ah! he’s the _seigneur_ of the chateau,”\r\n they say.\r\n\r\nThis, madame, is how the electoral kitchen is carried on and the way in\r\nwhich a deputy is cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. MARIE-GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE\r\n\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, May 15, 1839.\r\n\r\nMadame,--You do me the honor to say that my letters amuse you, and you\r\ntell me not to fear that I send too many.\r\n\r\nWe are no longer at the Hotel de la Poste, having left it for the\r\nchateau; but thanks to the rivalry existing between the two inns, the\r\nPoste and the Mulet, in the latter of which Monsieur de Trailles has\r\nestablished his headquarters, we are kept informed of what is going\r\non in the town and among our enemies. Since our departure, as our late\r\nlandlord informs us, a Parisian journalist has arrived at his hotel.\r\nThis individual, whose name I do not know, at once announced himself as\r\nJack-the-giant-killer, sent down to reinforce with his Parisian vim and\r\nvigor the polemic which the local press, subsidized by the “bureau of\r\npublic spirit,” has directed against us.\r\n\r\nIn that there is nothing very grave or very gay; since the world was a\r\nworld, governments have always found pens for sale, and never have\r\nthey failed to buy them; but the comedy of this affair begins with the\r\nco-arrival and the co-presence in the hotel of a young lady of very\r\nproblematical virtue. The name of this young lady as it appears on her\r\npassport is Mademoiselle Chocardelle; but the journalist in speaking of\r\nher calls her Antonia, or, when he wants to treat her with more respect,\r\nMademoiselle Antonia.\r\n\r\nNow, what can bring Mademoiselle Chocardelle to Arcis? A pleasure trip,\r\nyou will say, offered to her by the journalist, who combines with\r\nthat object our daily defamation and his consequent earnings from\r\nthe secret-service fund of the government. Not at all; Mademoiselle\r\nChocardelle has come to Arcis on business of her own,--namely, to\r\nenforce a claim.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Charles Keller before his departure for Africa, where\r\nhe met a glorious death, drew a note of hand, payable to Mademoiselle\r\nAntonia on order, for ten thousand francs, “value received in\r\nfurniture,” a charming ambiguity, the furniture having been received by,\r\nand not from, Mademoiselle Chocardelle, who estimated at ten thousand\r\nfrancs the sacrifice she made in accepting it.\r\n\r\nA few days after Charles Keller’s death, the note being almost due,\r\nMademoiselle Antonia went to the counting-room of the Keller Brothers\r\nto inquire about its payment. The cashier, who is crabbed, like all\r\ncashiers, replied that he did not see how Mademoiselle Antonia had the\r\nface to present such a note; at any rate, the heads of the house were\r\nat Gondreville, where the whole family had met after receiving the fatal\r\nnews, and he should pay no such note without referring the matter to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Very good, then I’ll refer it to them myself,” replied Mademoiselle\r\nAntonia. Thereupon she was meditating a departure alone to Arcis, when\r\nthe government felt the need of insulting us with more wit and point\r\nthan provincial journalism can muster, and so confided that employment\r\nto a middle-aged journalist to whom Mademoiselle Antonia had, during the\r\nabsence of Charles Keller, shown some kindness. “I am going to Arcis,”\r\n seems to have been said at the same instant by writer and lady. The most\r\ncommonplace lives encounter similar coincidences.\r\n\r\nNow, madame, admire the manner in which things link together. Setting\r\nforth on a purely selfish financial enterprise, behold Mademoiselle\r\nChocardelle suddenly brought to the point of wielding an immense\r\nelectoral influence! And observe also that her influence is of a nature\r\nto compensate for all the witty pin-pricks of her gallant companion.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle’s affair, it appears, hung fire. Twice she went to\r\nGondreville, and was not admitted. The journalist was busy,--partly\r\nwith his articles, and partly with certain commissions given to him by\r\nMonsieur de Trailles, under whose orders he was told to place himself.\r\nMademoiselle Antonia was therefore much alone; and in the ennui of\r\nsuch solitude, she was led to create for herself a really desperate\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nA few steps from the Hotel de la Poste is a bridge across the Aube;\r\na path leads down beside it, by a steep incline, to the water’s edge,\r\nwhich, being hidden from the roadway above and little frequented, offers\r\npeace and solitude to whoever may like to dream there to the sound of\r\nthe rippling current. Mademoiselle Antonia at first took a book with\r\nher; but books not being, as she says, in her line, she looked about for\r\nother ways of killing her time, and bethought herself of fishing, for\r\nwhich amusement the landlord of the inn supplied her with a rod. Much\r\npleased with her first successes, the pretty exile devoted herself to\r\nan occupation which must be attractive,--witness the fanatics that it\r\nmakes; and the few persons who crossed the bridge could admire at all\r\nhours a charming naiad in a flounced gown and a broad-brimmed straw hat,\r\nengaged in fishing with the conscientious gravity of a _gamin de Paris_.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Mademoiselle Antonia and her fishing have had nothing to\r\ndo with our election; but if you will recall, madame, in the history\r\nof Don Quixote (which I have heard you admire for its common-sense and\r\njovial reasoning) the rather disagreeable adventures of Rosinante and\r\nthe muleteers, you will have a foretaste of the good luck which the\r\ndevelopment of Mademoiselle Antonia’s new passion brought to us.\r\n\r\nOur rival, Beauvisage, is not only a successful stocking-maker and an\r\nexemplary mayor, but he is also a model husband, having never tripped in\r\nloyalty to his wife, whom he respects and admires. Every evening, by her\r\norders, he goes to bed before ten o’clock, while Madame Beauvisage and\r\nher daughter go into what Arcis is pleased to call society. But there is\r\nno more treacherous water, they say, than still water, just as there\r\nwas nothing less proper and well-behaved than the calm and peaceable\r\nRosinante on the occasion referred to.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, while making the tour of his town according to his laudable\r\nofficial habit, Beauvisage from the top of the bridge chanced to catch\r\nsight of the fair Parisian who with outstretched arms and gracefully\r\nbent body was pursuing her favorite pastime. A slight movement, the\r\ncharming impatience with which the pretty fisher twitched her line from\r\nthe water when the fish had not bitten, was perhaps the electric shock\r\nwhich struck upon the heart of the magistrate, hitherto irreproachable.\r\nNo one can say, perhaps, how the thing really came about. But I ought to\r\nremark that during the interregnum that occurred between the making of\r\nsocks and night-caps and the assumption of municipal duties, Beauvisage\r\nhimself had practised the art of fishing with a line with distinguished\r\nsuccess. Probably it occurred to him that the poor young lady, having\r\nmore ardor than science, was not going the right way to work, and the\r\nthought of improving her method may have been the real cause of his\r\napparent degeneracy. However that may be, it is certain that, crossing\r\nthe bridge in company with her mother, Mademoiselle Beauvisage suddenly\r\ncried out, like a true _enfant terrible_,--\r\n\r\n“Goodness! there’s papa talking with that Parisian woman!”\r\n\r\nTo assure herself at a glance of the monstrous fact, to rush down the\r\nbank and reach her husband (whom she found with laughing lips and the\r\nhappy air of a browsing sheep), to blast him with a stern “What are\r\nyou doing here?” to order his retreat to Arcis with the air of a queen,\r\nwhile Mademoiselle Chocardelle, first astonished and then enlightened as\r\nto what it all meant, went off into fits of laughter, took scarcely the\r\ntime I have taken to tell it. Such, madame, was the proceeding by which\r\nMadame Beauvisage, _nee_ Grevin, rescued her husband; and though that\r\nproceeding may be called justifiable, it was certainly injudicious,\r\nfor before night the whole town had heard of the catastrophe, and\r\nBeauvisage, arraigned and convicted by common consent of deplorable\r\nimmorality, saw fresh desertions taking place in the already winnowed\r\nphalanx of his partisans.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Gondreville and Grevin side still held firm, and--would you\r\nbelieve it, madame?--it was again Mademoiselle Antonia to whom we owe\r\nthe overthrow of their last rampart.\r\n\r\nHere is the tale of that phenomenon: Mother Marie-des-Anges wanted an\r\ninterview with the Comte de Gondreville; but how to get it she did not\r\nknow, because to ask for it was not, as she thought, proper. Having, it\r\nappears, unpleasant things to say to him, she did not wish to bring the\r\nold man to the convent expressly to hear them; such a proceeding seemed\r\nto her uncharitable. Besides, things comminatory delivered point-blank\r\nwill often provoke their recipient instead of alarming him; whereas the\r\nsame things slipped in sweetly never fail of their effect. Still, time\r\nwas passing; the election, as you know, takes place to-morrow, Sunday,\r\nand the preparatory meeting of all the candidates and the electors,\r\nto-night. The poor dear saintly woman did not know what course to take,\r\nwhen a little matter occurred, most flattering to her vanity, which\r\nsolved her doubts. A pretty sinner, she was told, who had come to Arcis\r\nto “do” Monsieur Keller the financier, then at Gondreville, out of some\r\nmoney, had heard of the virtues and the inexhaustible kindness of Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges--in short, she regarded her, after Danton, as the most\r\ninteresting object of the place, and deeply regretted that she dared not\r\nask to be admitted to her presence.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the following note was left at the Hotel de la Poste:--\r\n\r\n  Mademoiselle,--I am told that you desire to see me, but that you\r\n  do not know how to accomplish it. Nothing is easier. Ring the\r\n  door-bell of my quiet house, ask to see me, and do not be alarmed\r\n  at my black robe and aged face. I am not one of those who force\r\n  their advice upon pretty young women who do not ask for it, and\r\n  who may become in time greater saints than I. That is the whole\r\n  mystery of obtaining an interview with Mother Marie-des-Anges, who\r\n  salutes you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [Picture of\r\n  small cross.]\r\n\r\nAn invitation so graciously given was not to be resisted; and\r\nMademoiselle Antonia, after putting on the soberest costume she could\r\nget together, went to the convent.\r\n\r\nI wish I could give you the details of that interview, which must have\r\nbeen curious; but no one was present, and nothing was known except what\r\nthe lost sheep, who returned in tears, told of it. When the journalist\r\ntried to joke her on this conversion, Mademoiselle Antonia turned upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue,” she said; “you never in your life wrote a sentence\r\nlike what she said to me.”\r\n\r\n“What did she say to you?”\r\n\r\n“‘Go, my child,’ said that old woman, ‘the ways of God are beautiful,\r\nand little known; there is often more of a saint in a Magdalen than in a\r\nnun.’”\r\n\r\nThe journalist laughed, but scenting danger he said,--\r\n\r\n“When are you going again to Gondreville to see that Keller? If he\r\ndoesn’t pay the money soon, I’ll hit him a blow in some article, in\r\nspite of all Maxime may say.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t play dirty tricks myself,” replied Antonia, with dignity.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you? Do you mean you are not going to present that note again?”\r\n\r\n“Not now,” replied the admirer and probably the echo of Mother\r\nMarie-des-Anges, but using her own language; “I don’t blackmail a family\r\nin affliction. I should remember it on my death-bed, and doubt God’s\r\nmercy.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you make yourself an Ursuline, now that we are here?”\r\n\r\n“Ha, if I only had the courage! I might be happier if I did. But, in\r\nany case, I am not going to Gondreville; Mother Marie-des-Anges has\r\nundertaken to arrange that matter for me.”\r\n\r\n“Foolish girl! Have you given her that note?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to tear it up, but she prevented me, and told me to give it to\r\nher and she would arrange it honestly for my interests.”\r\n\r\n“Very fine! You were a creditor, and now you are a beggar.”\r\n\r\n“No, for I have given the money in alms. I told madame to keep it for\r\nher poor.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! if you add the vice of patronizing convents to your other vice of\r\nfishing in rivers, you will be a pleasant girl to frequent.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t frequent me much longer, for I go to-night, and leave you to\r\nyour dirty work.”\r\n\r\n“Bless me! so you retire to the Carmelites?”\r\n\r\n“The Carmelites!” replied Antonia, wittily; “no, my old fellow, we don’t\r\nretire to the Carmelites unless we leave a king.”\r\n\r\nSuch women, even the most ignorant, all know the story of La Valliere,\r\nwhom they would assuredly have made their patroness if Sister\r\nLouise-of-the-Sacred-Mercy had been canonized.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how Mother Marie-des-Anges managed it, but early this\r\nmorning the carriage of the old Comte de Gondreville stopped before the\r\ngate of the convent; and when the count again entered it he was driven\r\nto the office of his friend Grevin; and later in the day the latter said\r\nto several friends that certainly his son-in-law was too much of a\r\nfool, he had compromised himself with that Parisian woman, and would\r\nundoubtedly lose his election.\r\n\r\nI am told that the rectors of the two parishes in Arcis have each\r\nreceived a thousand crowns for their poor from Mother Marie-des-Anges,\r\nwho informed them that it came from a benefactor who did not wish his\r\nname known. Sallenauve is furious because our partisans are going about\r\nsaying that the money came from him. But when you are running before the\r\nwind you can’t mathematically measure each sail, and you sometimes get\r\nmore of a breeze than you really want.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Maxime de Trailles makes no sign, but there is every reason\r\nto suppose that this failure of his candidate, which he must see is now\r\ninevitable, will bury both him and his marriage. But, at any rate, he is\r\na clever fellow, who will manage to get his revenge.\r\n\r\nWhat a curious man, madame, this organist is! His name is that of one\r\nof our greatest physicians,--though they are not related to each\r\nother,--Bricheteau. No one ever showed more activity, more presence of\r\nmind, more devotion, more intelligence; and there are not two men in all\r\nEurope who can play the organ as he does. You say you do not want Nais\r\nto be a mere piano _strummer_; then I advise you to let this Bricheteau\r\nteach her. He is a man who would show her what music really is; he will\r\nnot give himself airs, for I assure you he is as modest as he is gifted.\r\nTo Sallenauve he is like a little terrier; as watchful, as faithful, and\r\nI may add as ugly,--if so good and frank a countenance as his can ever\r\nbe thought anything but handsome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. MARIE-GASTON TO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE\r\n\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, May 16, 1839.\r\n\r\nMadame,--Last evening the preparatory meeting took place,--a ridiculous\r\nceremony, very annoying to the candidates, which cannot, however, be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is natural that before pledging themselves to a man who is\r\nto represent them for four or five years, voters should want to question\r\nhim, and discover, if possible, what he really is. Is he a man of\r\nintelligence? Does he really sustain the ideas put forth about him? Will\r\nhe be cordial and affable to the various interests which may claim his\r\nsupport? Is he firm in character? Can he defend his ideas--if he has\r\nany? In a word, will the constituency be worthily, faithfully, and\r\nhonestly represented? That is the serious and respectable aspect of this\r\ninstitution, which, not being a part of the law, must, in order to be so\r\nfirmly fixed in our customs, have a sound reason for its existence.\r\n\r\nBut every medal has its reverse; as may be seen in these meetings of\r\ncandidates with electors puffed up by their own self-importance, eager\r\nto exercise for a moment the sovereignty they are about to delegate to\r\ntheir deputy, and selling it as dearly as they can to him. Considering\r\nthe impertinence of certain questions addressed to a candidate, it would\r\nreally seem as if the latter were a serf over whom each elector had\r\nrights of life and death. Not a corner of his private life where the\r\nunhappy man is safe from prying curiosity. All things are possible\r\nin the line of preposterous questioning; for instance: Why does the\r\ncandidate prefer the wine of Champagne to the wine of Bordeaux? At\r\nBordeaux, where wine is a religion, this preference implies an idea of\r\nnon-patriotism and may seriously affect the election. Many voters go\r\nto these meetings solely to enjoy the embarrassment of the candidates.\r\nHolding them as it were in the pillory, they play with them like a child\r\nwith a beetle, an old judge with the criminal he examines, or a young\r\nsurgeon at an autopsy.\r\n\r\nOthers have not such elevated tastes; they come merely to enjoy the\r\nracket, the confusion of tongues which is certain to take place on such\r\noccasions. Some see their opportunity to exhibit a choice talent; for\r\n(as they say in the reports of the Chamber) when “the tumult is at its\r\nheight,” a cock is heard to crow or a dog to howl as if his paw were\r\ntrodden upon,--noises that are imitated with marvellous accuracy. But\r\ntruly, are not fools and stupid beings a majority in the world, and\r\nought they not to have their representative?\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place in a large dance-hall, the loft for the orchestra\r\nforming a sort of private box to which non-voters were admitted, I\r\namong the number. Some ladies had already taken the front seats; Madame\r\nMarion, aunt of Simon Giguet, the Left centre candidate; Madame and\r\nMademoiselle Mollot, wife and daughter of the clerk of the court,\r\nand some others whose names and position I did not catch. Madame and\r\nMademoiselle Beauvisage shone conspicuously, like Brutus and Cassius, by\r\ntheir absence.\r\n\r\nBefore the candidacy of Monsieur Beauvisage was brought forward on the\r\nministerial side after the death of Charles Keller, that of Monsieur\r\nSimon Giguet was thought to be certain of success. Now, in consequence\r\nof that of our friend Sallenauve, who has in turn distanced Beauvisage,\r\nGiguet has fallen a step lower still. His father, a former colonel\r\nof the Empire, is greatly respected throughout this region. As an\r\nexpression of regret for not electing his son (according to all\r\nprobabilities), the electors made him, by acclamation, chairman of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nThe first candidate who was called upon to speak was Simon Giguet; he\r\nmade a long-winded address, full of commonplaces. Few questions were\r\nasked him which deserve a place in the present report. The audience felt\r\nthat the tug of war was elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Beauvisage was then summoned; whereupon Maitre Achille Pigoult\r\nthe notary rose, and asked leave to make a statement.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le maire,” he said, “has, since yesterday, been attacked by--”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” derisive laughter on the part of the electors.\r\n\r\nColonel Giguet rang his bell repeatedly, without being able to enforce\r\nsilence. At the first lull Maitre Pigoult resumed,--\r\n\r\n“I have the honor to inform you, gentlemen, that, attacked by an\r\nindisposition which, not serious in itself--”\r\n\r\nFresh interruption, noisier than the first.\r\n\r\nLike all military men, Colonel Giguet is not patient nor parliamentary;\r\nhe therefore rose and called out vehemently,--\r\n\r\n“Messieurs, we are not at a circus. I request you to behave in a more\r\nseemly manner; if not, I leave the chair.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that men in masses like to be handled roughly;\r\nfor this lesson was greeted with merry applause, after which silence\r\nappeared to be firmly re-established.\r\n\r\n“I regret to inform you,” began Maitre Achille Pigoult, varying his\r\nformula for the third time, “that, attacked by an indisposition happily\r\nnot serious, which may confine him to his chamber--”\r\n\r\n“Throat trouble,” suggested a voice.\r\n\r\n“--our venerable and excellent mayor,” continued Achille Pigoult, taking\r\nno notice of the interruption, “is unable to be present at this meeting.\r\nMadame Beauvisage, with whom I have just had the honor of an interview,\r\nrequests me to inform you that, _for the present_, Monsieur Beauvisage\r\nrenounces the honor of receiving your suffrages, and requests those of\r\nyou who have given him your intelligent sympathy to transfer your votes\r\nto Monsieur Simon Giguet.”\r\n\r\nThis Achille Pigoult is a malicious fellow, who intentionally brought in\r\nthe name of Madame Beauvisage to exhibit her conjugal sovereignty. But\r\nthe assembly was really too provincial to catch the meaning of that\r\nlittle bit of treachery. Besides, in the provinces, women take part in\r\nthe most virile affairs of the men. The well-known saying of the vicar’s\r\nold housekeeper, “We don’t say masses at that price,” would pass without\r\ncomment in Champagne.\r\n\r\nAt last came Sallenauve. I was struck with the ease and quiet dignity\r\nof his manner. That is a very reassuring pledge, madame, of his conduct\r\nunder more trying circumstances; for when a man rises to speak it makes\r\nbut little difference who and what his audience are. To an orator goaded\r\nby fear, great lords and porters are precisely the same thing. They are\r\neyes that look at you, ears that hear you. Individuals are not there,\r\nonly one huge being,--an assembly, felt as a mass, without analyzing the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nAfter enumerating briefly the ties which connected him with this region,\r\nslipping in as he did so an adroit and dignified allusion to his birth\r\nwhich “was not like that of others,” Sallenauve stated clearly his\r\npolitical ideas. A Republic he thought the finest of all governments;\r\nbut he did not believe it possible to establish one in France;\r\nconsequently, he did not desire it. He thought that a truly\r\nparliamentary government, in which court influence should be so\r\nvigorously muzzled that nothing need be feared from its tendency to\r\ninterference and caballing would best conduce to the dignity and the\r\nwelfare of the nation. Liberty and equality, the two great principles\r\nthat triumphed in ‘89, would obtain from such a government the strongest\r\nguarantees. As to the manoeuvring of the royal power against\r\nthose principles, it was not for institutions to check it, but for\r\nmen,--customs, public opinion, rather than laws; and for himself,\r\nSallenauve, he should ever stand in the breach as a living obstacle.\r\nHe declared himself a warm partisan of free education; believed\r\nthat greater economy might be exercised in the budget; that too many\r\nfunctionaries were attached to the government; and, above all, that\r\nthe court was too largely represented in the Chamber. To maintain his\r\nindependence he was firmly resolved to accept no post and no favors from\r\nthe government. Neither ought those who might elect him to expect that\r\nhe would ever take steps on their behalf which were not warranted by\r\nreason and by justice. It was said that the word _impossible_ was not\r\nFrench. Yet there was an impossibility by which he took pride in being\r\nstopped--that of injustice, and that of disloyalty, even the faintest,\r\nto the Right. [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\nSilence being once more restored,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said one of the electors, after obtaining the floor from the\r\nchairman, “you say that you will accept no post under government. Does\r\nnot that imply reproach to public functionaries? My name is Godivet; I\r\nam registrar of the archives, but I do not consider that a reason why I\r\nshould incur the contempt of my fellow-citizens.”\r\n\r\nSallenauve replied,--\r\n\r\n“I am happy, monsieur, to learn that the government has invested a\r\nman like you with functions which you fulfil, I am sure, with perfect\r\nuprightness and great ability; but I venture to ask if you rose to your\r\npresent position at one jump?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, monsieur; I began by being a supernumerary for three\r\nyears; after that I passed through all the grades; and I can show that\r\nfavor had nothing to do with my promotion.”\r\n\r\n“Then, monsieur, what would you say if with my rank as deputy (supposing\r\nthat I obtain the suffrages of this arrondissement) I, who have never\r\nbeen a supernumerary and never passed through any grades, and whose\r\nonly claim upon the administration is that of having voted for it,--what\r\nwould you say if I were suddenly appointed over your head as the\r\ndirector-general of your department?”\r\n\r\n“I should say--I should say, monsieur, that the choice was a good one,\r\nbecause the king himself would have made it.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur, you would not say it, or if you said it aloud, which I\r\nscarcely think possible, you would think in your heart that the choice\r\nwas ridiculous and unjust. ‘How the devil,’ you would say to yourself,\r\n‘could this man, this sculptor, know anything about the intricate\r\nbusiness of registering archives?’ And you would be right in condemning\r\nsuch royal caprice; for what becomes of long and honorable services,\r\njustly acquired rights, and steady promotion under such a system of\r\narbitrary choice? It is that I may not be the accomplice of this crying\r\nabuse, because I think it neither just nor honest nor useful to obtain\r\nin this way important public functions, that I denounce the system and\r\nbind myself to accept no office. Is this, monsieur, pouring contempt on\r\npublic functions? Is it not rather lifting them to higher honor?”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Godivet declared himself satisfied, and said no more.\r\n\r\n“_Ah ca_! monsieur,” cried another elector, after demanding the floor\r\nin the rather tipsy voice, “you say you will ask no favors for your\r\nconstituents; then what good will you be to us?”\r\n\r\n“My friend, I did not say I would ask nothing for my constituents. I\r\nsaid I would ask nothing but what was just; but that, I may add, I shall\r\nask with energy and perseverance, for that is how justice should be\r\nfollowed up.”\r\n\r\n“But,” persisted the voter, “there are various ways of doing justice;\r\nwitness the suit I was made to lose against Jean Remy, with whom I had\r\ntrouble about a boundary--”\r\n\r\nColonel Giguet, interrupting,--\r\n\r\n“Come, come, you are not going, I hope to talk about your private\r\naffairs, and speak disrespectfully of magistrates?”\r\n\r\nThe voter resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Magistrates, colonel, I respect, for I was one myself for six months in\r\n‘93, and I know the law. But, returning to my point, I ask monsieur, who\r\nis here to answer questions, to me as well as to others, what he thinks\r\nabout tobacco licenses.”\r\n\r\n“My opinion on tobacco licenses! That is rather difficult to formulate;\r\nI can, however, say that, if my information is correct, they are usually\r\nvery well distributed.”\r\n\r\n“Hey! hey! you’re a man, you!” cried the inebriate elector, “and I’ll\r\nvote for you, for they can’t fool you,--no! But they do give those\r\nlicenses all wrong! Look at that daughter of Jean Remy. Bad neighbor.\r\nNever owned anything but his cart, and fights every day with his wife--”\r\n\r\n“But, my good fellow,” said the chairman, interposing, “you are abusing\r\nthe patience of this assembly.”\r\n\r\n“No, no! let him talk!” cried voices from all parts of the room.\r\n\r\nThe voter was amusing, and Sallenauve himself seemed to let the chairman\r\nknow he would like to see what the man was driving at.\r\n\r\nThe elector, being allowed to continue, went on:--\r\n\r\n“I was going to say, with due respect to you, colonel, about that\r\ndaughter of Jean Remy’s,--a man I’ll pursue to hell, for my bounds were\r\nin their right place, and them experts was all wrong. Well! what did\r\nthat slut do? Left her father and mother and went to Paris! What did she\r\ndo there? I didn’t go to see, but I’m told she made acquaintance with\r\na deputy, and has got the tobacco license for the rue Mouffetard, the\r\nlongest street in Paris. But I’d like to see my wife, widow of an honest\r\nman, doubled up with rheumatism for having slept in the woods during\r\nthat terror in 1815,--I’d like to see my poor widow get a license!”\r\n\r\n“But you are not dead yet,” they shouted to him from all parts of the\r\nroom. The colonel, meantime, to put an end to the burlesque scene,\r\nnodded to a little confectioner who was waiting for the floor, a\r\nwell-known Republican. The new questioner, in a falsetto voice, put the\r\nfollowing insidious question to the candidate,--a question which might,\r\nby the way, be called national in Arcis,--\r\n\r\n“What does Monsieur think of Danton?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Dauphin,” said the chairman, “I have the honor to remind you\r\nthat Danton belongs to history.”\r\n\r\n“To the Pantheon of history, monsieur; that is the proper expression.”\r\n\r\n“Well, history, or the Pantheon of history, as you please; but Danton is\r\nirrelevant here.”\r\n\r\n“Permit me, Mr. Chairman,” said Sallenauve, “though the question does\r\nnot seem to have much purpose on the bearing of this meeting, I cannot\r\nforego the opportunity thus given me to give proof of the impartiality\r\nand independence with which I can judge that great memory, the fame of\r\nwhich still echoes in this town.”\r\n\r\n“Hear! hear!” cried the assembly, almost unanimously.\r\n\r\n“I am firmly convinced,” resumed Sallenauve, “that if Danton had been\r\nborn in a calm and peaceful epoch like our own, he would have shown\r\nhimself, what in fact he was, a good father, a good husband, a warm and\r\nfaithful friend, a man of kindly temper, who, by the force of his great\r\ntalents, would have risen to some eminent place in the State and in\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes! bravo! very good!”\r\n\r\n“Born, on the contrary, in troublesome times, and amid the storm of\r\nunchained passions, Danton was better constituted than others to kindle\r\nthe flame of that atmosphere of fire. Danton was the torch that fired;\r\nhis scarlet glare lent itself only too readily to scenes of blood\r\nand horror which I must not recall. But, they said, the national\r\nindependence was at stake, traitors and dissemblers must be awed,--in\r\na word, a cruel and awful sacrifice was necessary for the public weal.\r\nMessieurs, I do not accept that theory. To kill, without the necessity\r\ndemonstrated a score of times of legitimate defence, to kill women,\r\nchildren, prisoners, unarmed men, was a crime,--a crime, look at it how\r\nyou will, that was execrable; those who ordered it, those who consented\r\nto it, those who executed it are, to my mind, deserving of the same\r\nreprobation.”\r\n\r\nI wish I could give you an idea, madame, of the tone and expression\r\nof Sallenauve as he uttered this anathema. You know how his face is\r\ntransfigured when an ardent thought comes into his mind. The assemblage\r\nwas mute and gloomy. Evidently he had wounded their sensibilities; but,\r\nunder the curb of his powerful hand, it dared not throw up its head.\r\n\r\n“But,” he continued, “to all consummated and irreparable crimes there\r\nare two issues,--repentance and expiation. His repentance Danton did not\r\nutter,--he was too proud a man,--but he _acted_ it. He was the first,\r\nto the sound of that axe falling without pity and without respite,--the\r\nfirst, at the risk of his own head being the next victim,--to call for a\r\n‘committee of mercy.’ It was the sure, the infallible means of bringing\r\nhim to expiation; and you all know whether, when that day of expiation\r\ncame, he quailed before it. Passing through death,--won by his\r\ncourageous effort to stop the effusion of blood,--it may be truly said\r\nthat the face and the memory of Danton have washed off the bloody stain\r\nwhich September put upon them. Committed, at the age of thirty-five,\r\nto the judgment of posterity, Danton has left us the memory of a great\r\nintellect, a strong and powerful character, noble private qualities,\r\nmore than one generous action,--all derived from his own being; whereas\r\nthe bloody errors he committed were the contagion of his epoch. In a\r\nword, with men of his quality, unjust would be the justice which does\r\nnot temper itself with mercy. And here, messieurs, you have in your\r\nmidst--better than you, better than I, better than all orators and\r\nhistorians--a woman who has weighed and understood Danton, and who says\r\nto the pitiless, with the impulse of her charity, ‘He has gone to God;\r\nlet us pray for him.’”\r\n\r\nThe trap thus avoided by this happy allusion to Mother Marie-des-Anges,\r\nand the assembly evidently satisfied, it might be supposed that the\r\ncandidate had come to the end of his baiting. The colonel was even\r\npreparing to pass to the vote, when several electors sprang up,\r\ndeclaring that two important explanations were still required from the\r\ncandidate. He had said that he should ever be found an obstacle to all\r\nattempts of the royal power to subvert our institutions. What did he\r\nmean by such resistance? Was it armed resistance, the resistance of\r\nriots and barricades?\r\n\r\n“Barricades,” replied Sallenauve, “have nearly always seemed to me\r\nmachines which turned of themselves and crushed the men who raised them.\r\nWe must believe that in the nature of riots there is something which\r\nserves the interests of the government, for I have invariably heard the\r\npolice accused of inciting them. My resistance, that which I spoke of,\r\nwill ever be a legal resistance, pursued by legal means, by the press,\r\nby the tribune, and with patience,--that great force granted to the\r\noppressed and to the vanquished.”\r\n\r\nIf you knew Latin, madame, I should say to you, _In cauda venenum_;\r\nwhich means, “In the tail of the serpent is its venom,”--a remark of\r\nantiquity which modern science does not admit. Monsieur de l’Estorade\r\nwas not mistaken; Sallenauve’s private life was destined to be\r\nransacked, and, no doubt under the inspiration of the virtuous Maxime de\r\nTrailles, the second question put to our friend was about the handsome\r\nItalian woman said to be _hidden_ by him in his house in Paris.\r\n\r\nSallenauve showed no embarrassment at being thus interpellated. He\r\nmerely asked whether the assembly would think proper to spend its time\r\nin listening to a romantic story in which there was no scandal.\r\n\r\nBut here comes Sallenauve himself; he tells me that the electoral\r\ncollege is formed in a manner that leaves little doubt of his election.\r\nI leave my pen to him, to tell you the romantic tale, already, I\r\nbelieve, interrupted on several occasions. He will close this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. CHARLES DE SALLENAUVE TO THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE\r\n\r\n\r\n7 P.M.\r\n\r\nMadame,--The rather abrupt manner in which I parted from you and\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade the evening of our visit to Armand’s school, has\r\nbeen explained to you by the preoccupations of all sorts to which at\r\nthat moment I was a victim. Marie-Gaston tells me that he has kept you\r\ninformed of the subsequent events.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that in the restless and agitated state of mind in which\r\nI then was, the sort of belief which Monsieur de l’Estorade appeared to\r\ngive to the scandal which he mentioned caused me great displeasure and\r\nsome surprise. How, thought I, is it possible that a man of Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade’s morality and intellect can _a priori_ suppose me capable of\r\nsuch disorder, when he sees me anxious to give to my life all the weight\r\nand consideration which the respect of others alone can bestow? Only a\r\nfew moments before this painful conversation I had been on the point\r\nof making you a confidence which would, I presume, have protected me\r\nagainst the unfortunate impression which Monsieur de l’Estorade conveyed\r\nto your mind. As for Monsieur de l’Estorade himself, I was, I confess,\r\nso annoyed at seeing the careless manner in which he made himself the\r\necho of a calumny against which I felt he ought rather to have defended\r\nme that I did not _deign_ to make any explanation to him. I now withdraw\r\nthat word, but it was then the true expression of a displeasure keenly\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my electoral contest, I have been obliged to make\r\npublic the justification I did not make to you; and I have had the\r\nsatisfaction of finding that men in masses are more capable than\r\nindividuals of understanding generous impulses and of distinguishing the\r\nhonest language of truth. Here are the facts which I related, but more\r\nbriefly and with less detail, to my electors.\r\n\r\nA few months before my departure from Rome, I was in a cafe frequented\r\nby the pupils of the Academy, when an Italian musician, named Benedetto,\r\ncame in, as he usually did every evening. Nominally he was a musician\r\nand a tolerable one; but we had been warned that he was also a spy of\r\nthe Roman police. However that might be, he was very amusing; and as we\r\ncared nothing for the police, we not only endured but we encouraged his\r\nvisits,--which was not hard to do in view of his passion for _poncio\r\nspongato_ and _spuma di latte_.\r\n\r\nOn his entrance one evening, a member of our party asked him who was the\r\nwoman with whom he had met him that morning.\r\n\r\n“My wife, signore,” answered the Italian.\r\n\r\n“Yours, Benedetto!--you the husband of such a beauty!”\r\n\r\n“Si, signore.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! you are ugly and drunken, and people say you are police spy;\r\nbut she, on the contrary, is as handsome as Diana the huntress.”\r\n\r\n“I charmed her with my talent; she adores me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if she is your wife, make her pose to our friend here, Dorlange,\r\nwho wants a model for his Pandora. He can’t get a finer one.”\r\n\r\n“That can be managed,” replied the Italian.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was in my studio in company with several young painters\r\nand sculptors when Benedetto came in accompanied by a woman of rare\r\nbeauty, whom I need not describe, for you have seen her, madame, at my\r\nhouse. A joyous hurrah greeted the Italian, who said to me,--\r\n\r\n“_Ecco la Pandora_! Hey! what do you think of her?”\r\n\r\n“Marvellously beautiful; but would she pose?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” exclaimed Benedetto, with an air which seemed to say: “I’d like\r\nto see her refuse.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I remarked, “she would cost too much, a model of her beauty.”\r\n\r\n“No; you need only make my bust--just a plaster cast--and give it to\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” I said. Then I told my friends to go and leave us alone\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNobody minded me. Judging the wife by the husband, the eager young\r\nfellows pressed round her; while she, wounded and angered by the\r\naudacity of their eyes, looked like a caged panther irritated by\r\npeasants at a fair.\r\n\r\nGoing up to her and pulling her aside, Benedetto told her in Italian\r\nthat I wanted to copy her from head to foot, and she must then and there\r\ntake off her clothes. The woman gave him one withering look, and\r\nmade for the door. Benedetto rushed forward to prevent her; while my\r\ncomrades, for the honor of the studio, endeavored to bar his way.\r\n\r\nThen began an argument between the wife and the husband; but, as I saw\r\nthat Benedetto sustained his part of it with great brutality, I was\r\nangry, and, having a pretty vigorous arm, I pushed him aside, and took\r\nthe wife, who was trembling all over, to the door. She said, in Italian,\r\na few words of thanks, and disappeared instantly.\r\n\r\nReturning to Benedetto, who was gesticulating furiously, I told him to\r\nleave the studio, that his conduct was infamous, and if I heard of his\r\nill-treating his wife I would have him punished.\r\n\r\n“_Debole_!” (idiot!) he replied, shrugging his shoulders, and departing\r\namid derisive cheers.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed, and no signs of Benedetto. By the end of a week he\r\nwas forgotten. Three days before my departure from Rome his wife entered\r\nmy studio.\r\n\r\n“You are leaving Rome,” she said, “and I want you to take me with you.”\r\n\r\n“Take you with me!--but your husband?”\r\n\r\n“Dead,” she answered tranquilly.\r\n\r\nA thought crossed my mind.\r\n\r\n“Did you kill him?” I said.\r\n\r\nShe made an affirmative sign, adding, “But I meant to die too.”\r\n\r\n“How was it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“After he offered me that affront,” she replied, “he came home and beat\r\nme, as he often did; then he went out and was gone all day. At night he\r\nreturned with a pistol and threatened to shoot me; but I got the pistol\r\naway from him, for he was drunk. I threw him--the _briccone_!--on his\r\nbed, and he fell asleep. Then I stuffed up the doors and windows, and\r\nlighted the charcoal brazier. My head ached horribly, and I knew nothing\r\nmore till the next day, when I woke up in the hands of my neighbors.\r\nThey had smelt the charcoal, and burst in the door,--but he was dead.”\r\n\r\n“And the law?”\r\n\r\n“I told the judge everything. Besides, _he_ had tried to sell me to\r\nan Englishman,--that’s why he wanted to disgrace me here with you; he\r\nthought I would resist less. The judge told me I might go, I had done\r\nright; then I confessed to a priest, and he gave me absolution.”\r\n\r\n“But, _cara mia_, what can you do in France? Better stay in Italy;\r\nbesides, I am not rich.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled disdainfully.\r\n\r\n“I shall not cost you much,” she said; “on the contrary, I can save you\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“I can be the model for your statues if I choose. Besides which, I am a\r\ncapital housekeeper. If Benedetto had behaved properly, we should have\r\nhad a good home,--_per che_, I know how to make one; and I’ve another\r\ngreat talent too!”\r\n\r\nShe ran to a guitar, which was hanging on the wall, and began to sing a\r\nbravura air, accompanying herself with singular energy.\r\n\r\n“In France,” she said, when she had finished, “I could take lessons and\r\ngo upon the stage, where I know I should succeed; that was Benedetto’s\r\nidea.”\r\n\r\n“But why not do that in Italy?”\r\n\r\n“I am hiding from that Englishman,” she replied; “he wants to carry me\r\noff. I am determined to go to France; I have learned to speak French. If\r\nI stay here, I shall throw myself into the Tiber.”\r\n\r\nBy abandoning such a nature, more terrible than seductive, to itself,\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade will, I think, agree that I was likely to cause\r\nsome misfortune. I consented, therefore, that Signora Luigia should\r\naccompany me to Paris. Since then she has managed my household with\r\ndiscretion and economy. She even offered to pose for my Pandora; but the\r\nmemory of that scene with her husband has, as you may well believe, kept\r\nme from accepting her offer. I have given her a singing-master, and she\r\nis now almost prepared to make her appearance on the stage. But in spite\r\nof her theatrical projects, she, pious like all Italians, has joined the\r\nsisterhood of the Virgin in Saint-Sulpice, my parish church, and during\r\nthe month of May, which began a few days ago, the letter of chairs\r\ncounts on her beautiful voice for part of her receipts. She is assiduous\r\nat the services, confesses, and takes the sacrament regularly. Her\r\nconfessor, a most respectable old man, came to see me lately to request\r\nthat she might not be required to pose for any more of my statues,\r\nsaying that she would not listen to him on that point, believing herself\r\nbound in honor to me.\r\n\r\nMy own intention, if I am elected, which now seems probable, is to\r\nseparate from this woman. In a position which will place me more before\r\nthe public, she would become an object of remark as injurious to\r\nher reputation and future prospects as to mine. I have talked with\r\nMarie-Gaston about the difficulty I foresee in making this separation.\r\nUntil now, my house has been the whole of Paris to this poor woman;\r\nand the thought of flinging her alone into the gulf, of which she knows\r\nnothing, horrifies me.\r\n\r\nMarie-Gaston thinks that the help and advice of a person of her own sex,\r\nwith a high reputation for virtue and good judgment, would be in such\r\na case most efficacious; and he declares that he and I both know a lady\r\nwho, at our earnest entreaty, might take this duty upon herself. The\r\nperson to whom Marie-Gaston makes allusion is but a recent acquaintance\r\nof mine, and I could hardly ask even an old friend to take such a care\r\nupon her shoulders. I know, however, that you once did me the honor to\r\nsay that “certain relations ripen rapidly.” Marie-Gaston insists that\r\nthis lady, being kind and pious and most charitable, will be attracted\r\nby the idea of helping and advising a poor lonely woman. On our return\r\nto Paris, madame, we shall venture to consult you, and you will tell us\r\nwhether we may ask for this precious assistance.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I will ask you to be my intermediary with Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade; tell him the facts I have now told you, and say that I hope\r\nthe little cloud between us may be effectually removed. If I am elected,\r\nwe shall be, I know, in opposite camps; but as my intention is not to\r\ntake a tone of systematic opposition in all the questions which may\r\narise between our parties, I do not think there _need_ be any break\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nBy this time to-morrow, madame, I may have received a checkmate which\r\nwill send me back forever to my studio, or I shall have a foot in a\r\nnew career. Shall I tell you that the thought of the latter result\r\ndistresses me?--doubtless from a fear of the Unknown.\r\n\r\nI was almost forgetting to give you another piece of news. I have\r\nconsulted Mother Marie-des-Anges (whose history Marie-Gaston tells me\r\nhe has related to you) on the subject of my doubts and fears as to the\r\nviolence done to Mademoiselle de Lanty, and she has promised that in\r\ncourse of time she will discover the convent in which Marianina is a\r\nprisoner. The worthy Mother, if she takes this into her head, is almost\r\ncertain to succeed in finding the original of her Saint-Ursula.\r\n\r\nI am not feeling at all easy in mind about Marie-Gaston. He seems to me\r\nin a state of feverish agitation, partly created by the immense interest\r\nhe takes in my success. But I greatly fear that his efforts will\r\nresult in a serious reaction. His own grief, which at this moment he is\r\nrepressing, has not in reality lost its sting. Have you not been struck\r\nby the rather flighty and mocking tone of his letters, some of which he\r\nhas shown to me? That is not in his nature, for in his happiest days\r\nhe was never turbulently gay; and I am sadly afraid that when this\r\nfictitious excitement about my election is over he may fall into utter\r\nprostration. He has, however, consented to come and live with me,\r\nand not to go to Ville d’Avray unless I am with him. Even this act of\r\nprudence, which I asked without hoping to obtain it, makes me uneasy.\r\nEvidently he is afraid of the memories that await him there. Have I the\r\npower to lessen the shock? Old Philippe, who was left in charge of the\r\nplace when he went to Italy, had orders not to move or change anything\r\nwhatever in the house. Our friend is therefore likely to find himself,\r\nin presence of those speaking objects, on the morrow as it were of his\r\nwife’s death. Another alarming thing! he has only spoken of her once,\r\nand will not suffer me to approach the subject. I hope, however, that\r\nthis may be a crisis; once passed, I trust we may, by all uniting,\r\nsucceed in composing his mind.\r\n\r\nVictor or vanquished, I trust to meet you soon, madame, and always as\r\nyour most respectful and devoted servant,\r\n\r\nCharles de Sallenauve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. MARIE-GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L’ESTORADE\r\n\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, May 17, 1839.\r\n\r\nThat stupid riot in Paris, the incredible particulars of which we heard\r\nthis morning by telegraph, came near causing us to lose the election.\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect instantly placarded all over the town the news of this\r\nattempt at insurrection--no doubt instigated by the government to affect\r\nthe elections. “What! elect a democrat!” was repeated everywhere in\r\nArcis, and doubtless elsewhere, “so that his speeches in the Chamber may\r\nbe made the ammunition of insurgents!”\r\n\r\nThat argument threw our phalanx into disorder and hesitation. But the\r\nidea occurred to Jacques Bricheteau to turn the danger itself to good\r\naccount, and he hastily printed on a sheet of paper and distributed all\r\nover the town in enormous quantities the following notice:--\r\n\r\n  A bloody riot took place yesterday in Paris. Questioned as to the\r\n  employment of such guilty and desperate means of opposition, one\r\n  of our candidates, Monsieur de Sallenauve, answered thus: “Riots\r\n  will always be found to serve the interests of the government; for\r\n  this reason the police are invariably accused of inciting them.\r\n  True resistance, that which I stand for, will always be legal\r\n  resistance, pursued by legal means, by the press, by the tribune,\r\n  and with Patience--that great force granted to the oppressed and\r\n  to the vanquished.”\r\n\r\nThese words, you will remember, madame, were those in which Sallenauve\r\nanswered his questioners at the preparatory meeting. Then followed in\r\nlarge letters:--\r\n\r\n  THE RIOT HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED. WHO WILL PROFIT BY IT?\r\n\r\nThat sheet of paper did marvels; it completely foiled the efforts of\r\nMonsieur de Trailles, who, throwing off the mask, had spent his day in\r\nperorating, in white gloves, on the market-place and from the steps of\r\nthe electoral college.\r\n\r\nThis evening the result is known; namely, two hundred and one votes\r\ncast: two for Beauvisage; twenty-nine for Simon Giguet; one hundred and\r\nseventy for Sallenauve.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Monsieur Charles de Sallenauve is proclaimed Deputy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. MONSIEUR DE SALLENAUVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SORROWS OF MONSIEUR DE TRAILLES\r\n\r\nDuring the evening which followed the election in which he had played a\r\npart so humiliating to his vanity, Maxime de Trailles returned to Paris.\r\nIt might be supposed that in making, on his arrival, a rapid toilet and\r\nordering his carriage to be instantly brought round, he was hastening to\r\npay a visit to the Comte de Rastignac, minister of Public Works, to whom\r\nhe must have desired to render an account of his mission, and explain as\r\nbest he could the reasons of its ill-success.\r\n\r\nBut another and more pressing interest seemed to claim him.\r\n\r\n“To Colonel Franchessini’s,” he said to his coachman.\r\n\r\nArriving at the gate of one of the prettiest hotels in the _quartier_\r\nBreda, and nodding to the concierge, he received an affirmative sign,\r\nwhich meant, “Monsieur is at home”; and at the same time a valet\r\nappeared on the portico to receive him.\r\n\r\n“Is the colonel visible?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He has just gone into madame’s room. Does monsieur wish me to call\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll wait for him in the study.”\r\n\r\nThen, like one familiar with the house, and without waiting for the\r\nservant to usher him, he entered a large room on the ground-floor, which\r\nlooked into a garden, and was filled with a miscellaneous collection of\r\narticles testifying to the colonel’s habits and tastes. Books, charts,\r\nand maps certainly justified the word “study”; but, as a frantic\r\nsportsman and member of the Jockey Club, the colonel had allowed\r\nthis sanctum of mental labor and knowledge to become, by degrees, his\r\nsmoking, fencing, and harness room. Pipes and weapons of all shapes and\r\nall lands, saddles, hunting-whips, spurs, bits of many patterns, foils\r\nand boxing-gloves formed a queer and heterogenous collection. However,\r\nby thus surrounding his daily life with the objects of his favorite\r\n_studies_, the colonel proved himself a man who possessed the courage\r\nof his opinions. In fact, he openly said that, beyond a passing notice,\r\nthere was no reading worth a man’s attention except the “Stud Journal.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed, however, that politics had managed in some way\r\nto slip into this existence devoted to muscular exercise and the hippic\r\nscience, for, from a heap of the morning journals disdainfully flung\r\nupon the floor by the worthy colonel, Monsieur de Trailles picked up\r\na copy of the legitimist organ, in which he read, under the heading of\r\nELECTIONS, the following article:\r\n\r\n  The staff of the National Guard and the Jockey Club, which had\r\n  various representatives in the last Chamber, have just sent one of\r\n  their shining notabilities to the one about to open. Colonel\r\n  Franchessini, so well known for his ardor in punishing the\r\n  refractories of the National Guard, has been elected almost\r\n  unanimously in one of the rotten boroughs of the civil list. It is\r\n  supposed that he will take his seat beside the phalanx of other\r\n  henchmen, and show himself in the Chamber, as he has elsewhere,\r\n  one of the firmest supporters of the policy of the _present order\r\n  of things_.\r\n\r\nAs Maxime finished reading the article, the colonel entered.\r\n\r\nAfter serving the Empire for a very short time, Colonel Franchessini\r\nhad become one of the most brilliant colonels of the Restoration; but\r\nin consequence of certain mists which had risen about the perfect\r\nhonorableness of his character he had found himself obliged to send in\r\nhis resignation, so that in 1830 he was fully prepared to devote himself\r\nin the most ardent manner to the dynasty of July. He did not re-enter\r\nmilitary service, because, shortly after his misadventure he had met\r\nwith an Englishwoman, enormously rich, who being taken with his beauty,\r\nworthy at that time of the Antinous, had made him her husband, and the\r\ncolonel henceforth contented himself with the epaulets of the staff\r\nof the National Guard. He became, in that position, one of the most\r\nexacting and turbulent of blusterers, and through the influence of that\r\nquality combined with the fortune his wife had given him, he had\r\njust been elected, as the paper stated, to the Chamber of deputies.\r\nApproaching the fifties, like his friend de Trailles, Colonel\r\nFranchessini had still some pretensions to the after-glow of youth,\r\nwhich his slim figure and agile military bearing seemed likely to\r\npreserve to him for some time longer. Although he had conquered the\r\ndifficulty of his gray hair, reducing its silvery reflections by\r\nkeeping it cut very close, he was less resigned to the scantiness of his\r\nmoustache, which he wore in youthful style, twirled to a sharp point by\r\nmeans of a Hungarian cosmetic, which also preserved to a certain degree\r\nits primitive color. But whoso wants to prove too much proves nothing,\r\nand in the black which the colonel used there was noticeably a raw tone,\r\nand an equality of shade too perfect for truth of nature. Hence his\r\ncountenance, swarthy and strongly marked with the Italian origin\r\nindicated by his name, had an expression of singular rigidity, to which\r\nhis features, now become angular, his piercing glance, and his nose like\r\nthe beak of a bird of prey, did not afford the requisite corrective.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Maxime!” he cried, shaking hands with his visitor, “where the\r\ndevil do you come from? It is more than a fortnight since I have seen\r\nyou at the club.”\r\n\r\n“Where do I come from?” replied Monsieur de Trailles. “I’ll tell you\r\npresently; but first let me congratulate you on your election.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the colonel, with apparent indifference, “_they_ would put\r\nme up; but I assure you, upon my honor, I was very innocent of it all,\r\nand if no one had done more than I--”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear fellow, you are a blessed choice for that arrondissement;\r\nI only wish that the electors I have had to do with were equally\r\nintelligent.”\r\n\r\n“What! have you been standing for election? I didn’t suppose, taking\r\ninto consideration the--rather troubled state of your finances, that you\r\ncould manage it.”\r\n\r\n“True, and I was not electioneering on my own account. Rastignac was\r\nuneasy about the arrondissement of Arcis-sur-Aube, and he asked me to go\r\ndown there for a few days.”\r\n\r\n“Arcis-sur-Aube? Seems to me I read an article about that this morning\r\nin one of those cabbage-leaves. Horrid choice, isn’t it?--some plasterer\r\nor image-maker they propose to send us?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; and it is about that very thing I have come to see you\r\nbefore I see the others. I have just arrived, and I don’t want to go to\r\nRastignac until after I have talked with you.”\r\n\r\n“How is he getting on, that little minister?” said the colonel, taking\r\nno notice of the clever steps by which Maxime was gravitating toward the\r\nobject of his visit. “They seem to be satisfied with him at the palace.\r\nDo you know that little Nucingen whom he married?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I often see Rastignac; he is a very old acquaintance of mine.”\r\n\r\n“She is pretty, that little thing,” continued the colonel, “very pretty;\r\nand I think, the first year of marriage well buried, one might risk\r\none’s self in that direction with some success.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Maxime, “you are a serious man now, a legislator! As\r\nfor me, the mere meddling in electoral matters in the interests of other\r\npeople has sobered me.”\r\n\r\n“Did you say you went to Arcis-sur-Aube to hinder the election of that\r\nstone-cutter?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; I went there to throw myself in the way of the election of\r\na Left-centre candidate.”\r\n\r\n“Pah! the Left, pure and simple, is hardly worse. But take a cigar;\r\nthese are excellent. The princes smoke them.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel rose and rang the bell, saying to the servant when he came,\r\n“A light!”\r\n\r\nThe cigars lighted, Monsieur de Trailles endeavored to prevent another\r\ninterruption by declaring before he was questioned that he had never\r\nsmoked anything more exquisite. Comfortably ensconced in his arm-chair,\r\nthe colonel seemed to offer the hope of a less fugacious attention, and\r\nMonsieur de Trailles resumed:--\r\n\r\n“All went well at first. To crush the candidate the ministry wanted\r\nto be rid of,--a lawyer, and the worst sort of cad,--I unearthed a\r\nstocking-maker, a fearful fool, whom I persuaded to offer himself as\r\ncandidate. The worthy man was convinced that he belonged to the dynastic\r\nopposition. That is the opinion which, for the time being, prevails in\r\nthat region. The election, thanks to me, was as good as made; and, our\r\nman once in Paris, the great Seducer in the Tuileries had only to say\r\nfive words to him, and this dynastic opposer could have been turned\r\ninside out like one of this own stockings, and made to do whatever was\r\nwanted of him.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty well played that!” said the colonel. “I recognize my Maxime.”\r\n\r\n“You will recognize him still farther when he tells you that he was\r\nable, without recourse to perquisites, to make his own little profit out\r\nof the affair. In order to graft a little parliamentary ambition upon\r\nmy vegetable, I addressed myself to his wife,--a rather appetizing\r\nprovincial, though past her prime.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I see; very good!” said Franchessini; “husband made\r\ndeputy--satisfied--shut his mouth.”\r\n\r\n“You are all wrong, my dear fellow; the pair have an only daughter, a\r\nspoilt child, nineteen years old, very agreeable face, and something\r\nlike a million in her pocket.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Maxime, I passed your tailor’s house last night, and it\r\nwas not illuminated.”\r\n\r\n“No; that would have been premature. However, here was the situation:\r\ntwo women frantic to get to Paris; gratitude to the skies for the man\r\nwho would get them an introduction to the Palais-Bourbon; the little\r\none crazy for the title of countess; the mother transported at the idea,\r\ncarefully insinuated by me, of holding a political salon,--you must see\r\nall that such a situation offers, and you know me too well, I fancy, to\r\nsuppose that I should fall below any of its opportunities.”\r\n\r\n“Quite easy in mind as to that,” said the colonel, getting up to open a\r\nwindow and let out the smoke of their two cigars.\r\n\r\n“I was on the point,” continued Maxime, “of pocketing both daughter and\r\n_dot_, when there fell from the skies, or rather there rose from the\r\nnether regions, a Left candidate, the stone-cutter, as you call him, a\r\nman with two names,--in short, a natural son--”\r\n\r\n“Ha!” said the colonel, “those fellows do have lucky stars, to be sure.\r\nI am not surprised if one of them mowed the grass from under your feet.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Maxime, “if we were in the middle ages, I should\r\nexplain by magic and sorcery the utter discomfiture of my candidate,\r\nand the election of the stone-man, whom you are fated to have for your\r\ncolleague. How is it possible to believe, what is however the fact, that\r\nan old _tricoteuse_, a former friend of Danton, and now the abbess of\r\na convent of Ursulines, should actually, by the help of her nephew, an\r\nobscure organist in Paris, have so bewitched the whole electoral college\r\nthat this upstart has been elected by a large majority?”\r\n\r\n“But I suppose he had some friends and acquaintances in the town?”\r\n\r\n“Not the ghost of one,--unless it might be that nun. Fortune, relations,\r\nfather, even a name, he never had until the day of his arrival at Arcis\r\ntwo weeks ago; and now, if you please, the Comte Charles de Sallenauve,\r\nseigneur of the chateau of Arcis, is elected to the Chamber of deputies!\r\nGod only knows how it was done! The pretended head of a former great\r\nfamily, representing himself as absent in foreign lands for many years,\r\nsuddenly appears with this schemer before a notary in Arcis, recognizes\r\nhim at a gallop as his son, buys the chateau of Arcis and presents it\r\nto him, and is off during the night before any one could even know what\r\nroad he took. The trick thus played, the abbess and her aide-de-camp,\r\nthe organist, launched the candidate, and at once republicans,\r\nlegitimists, conservatives, clergy, nobility, bourgeoisie, in fact\r\neverybody, as if by some spell cast upon that region, all did the\r\nbidding of that old witch of a nun, and without the stalwart battalion\r\nof the functionaries (who under my eye stood firm and did not flinch),\r\nhis election would have been, like yours, unanimous.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my poor friend, good-bye to the _dot_.”\r\n\r\n“Not precisely; though it must certainly be adjourned. The father\r\ngrumbles because the blessed tranquillity of his life was disturbed and\r\nhe himself covered with ridicule, though the poor dear man had already\r\nenough of that! The daughter still wants to be a countess, but the\r\nmother takes it hard that her political salon should be floating away\r\nfrom her, and God knows how far I shall be led in order to comfort her.\r\nBesides all this, I myself am goaded by the necessity of having to find\r\nthe solution of my own problem pretty soon. I _had_ found it there: I\r\nintended to marry, and take a year to settle my affairs; at the next\r\nsession I should have made my father-in-law resign and stepped into his\r\nseat in the Chamber; then, you understand, what an horizon before me!”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear fellow, political horizon apart, don’t let that million\r\nslip through your fingers.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens! as for that, except for the delay, I feel safe enough. My\r\nfuture family is about to remove to Paris. After this mortifying defeat,\r\nlife in Arcis will not be endurable. Beauvisage (forgive the name, it is\r\nthat of my adopted family)--Beauvisage is like Coriolanus, ready if he\r\ncan to bring fire and slaughter on his ungrateful birthplace. Besides,\r\nin transplanting themselves hither, these unfortunate exiles know where\r\nto lay their heads, being the owners of the hotel Beauseant.”\r\n\r\n“Owners of the hotel Beauseant!” cried the colonel, in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Yes; Beauseant--Beauvisage; only a termination to change. Ah! my dear\r\nfellow, you don’t know what these provincial fortunes are, accumulated\r\npenny by penny, especially when to the passion for saving is added the\r\nincessant aspiration of that leech called commerce. We must make up our\r\nminds to some course; the bourgeoisie are rising round us like a flood;\r\nit is almost affable in them to buy our chateaus and estates when they\r\nmight guillotine us as in 1793, and get them for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Happily for you, my dear Maxime, you have reduced the number of your\r\nchateaus and estates.”\r\n\r\n“You see yourself that is not so,” replied Maxime, “inasmuch as I am\r\nnow engaged in providing myself with one. The Beauseant house is to be\r\nrepaired and refurnished immediately, and I am charged with the ordering\r\nof the work. But I have made my future mother-in-law another promise,\r\nand I want your help, my dear fellow, in fulfilling it.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a tobacco license, or a stamped-paper office, is it?”\r\n\r\n“No, something less difficult. These damned women, when hatred or a\r\ndesire for vengeance takes possession of them, are marvels of instinct;\r\nand Madame Beauvisage, who roars like a lioness at the very name of\r\nSallenauve, has taken it into her head that beneath his incomprehensible\r\nsuccess there is some foul intrigue or mystery. It is certain that the\r\nappearance and disappearance of this mysterious father have given rise\r\nto very singular conjectures; and probably if the thumb-screws were put\r\nupon the organist, who was, they say, entrusted with the education\r\nof the interesting bastard, we might get the secret of his birth and\r\npossibly other unexpected revelations. Now I have thought of a man on\r\nwhom you have, I believe, great influence, who might in this hunt for\r\nfacts assist us immensely. Don’t you remember the robbery of those\r\njewels from Jenny Cardine, about which she was so unhappy one night at\r\nVery’s? You asked the waiter for pens and paper, and on a simple\r\nnote which you sent at three o’clock in the morning to a Monsieur\r\nSaint-Esteve the police went to work, and before the evening of the next\r\nday the thieves were captured and the jewels restored.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the colonel, “I remember all that; my interference was\r\nlucky. But I must tell you that had I paused to reflect I should not\r\nhave treated Monsieur de Saint-Esteve so cavalierly. He is a man to be\r\napproached with greater ceremony.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah ca_! but isn’t he a former galley-slave, whose pardon you helped to\r\nobtain, and who feels for you the veneration they say Fieschi felt for\r\none of his protectors?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is true. Monsieur de Saint-Esteve, like his predecessor,\r\nBibi-Lupin, has had _misfortunes_; but he is to-day the head of the\r\ndetective police, the important functions of which office he fulfils\r\nwith rare capacity. If the matter concerned anything that comes within\r\nhis department, I should not hesitate to give you a letter to him; but\r\nthe affair you speak of is delicate; and in any case I must first sound\r\nhim and see if he is willing to talk with you.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you managed him despotically. Let us say no more about it, if\r\nyou think it so very difficult.”\r\n\r\n“The greatest difficulty is that I never see him; and I naturally cannot\r\nwrite to him for such an object. I should have to watch for an occasion,\r\na chance meeting. But why don’t you speak of this to Rastignac? He could\r\ngive him an order to act at once.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you understand that Rastignac will receive me very ill indeed? I\r\nhad assured him, by letter, of success, and now I am forced to report\r\nin person our defeat. Besides, on every account, I would rather owe this\r\nservice to your friendship.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it sha’n’t fail you,” said the colonel, rising. “I’ll do my best\r\nto satisfy you; only, there must be a delay.”\r\n\r\nThe visit had lasted long, and Maxime felt that a hint was given him to\r\nabridge it. He therefore took leave, putting into his manner a certain\r\ncoldness which the colonel appeared not to notice.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Monsieur de Trailles departed than Franchessini opened\r\na pack of cards and took out the knave of spades. This he cut up in a\r\ncurious manner, leaving the figure untouched. Placing this species\r\nof hieroglyphic between two sheets of paper, he consigned it to an\r\nenvelope. On this envelope and disguising his hand the colonel wrote as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Monsieur de Saint-Esteve, rue Saint-Anne, near the Quai des\r\n  Orfevres.\r\n\r\nThat done, he rang the bell and gave orders to put up his carriage,\r\nwhich he had ordered before Maxime’s arrival; after which he went out\r\nalone on foot, and threw his singular missive into the first street\r\nletter-box that he passed. He had taken care, before he left the house,\r\nto see if it were properly sealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. A CONVERSATION BETWEEN ELEVEN O’CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT\r\n\r\nAs a result of the elections which had just taken place, the ministry,\r\ncontrary to expectation, maintained a majority in the Chamber,--a\r\ndoubtful and provisional majority which would give it an uncertain and\r\nstruggling existence. But, at any rate, it had obtained that merely\r\nnumerical success which parties seek at any price to prolong their\r\npower. The Te Deum was sung in all its camps,--a paean which serves as\r\nwell to celebrate victorious defeats as honest victories.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day when Colonel Franchessini received the visit\r\nfrom Maxime de Trailles, the general result of the elections was made\r\nknown. The ministers of the left bank, whose wives received on that day,\r\nfound their salons crowded, particularly the Comte de Rastignac, the\r\nminister of Public Works.\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade, too much absorbed in her children to be very exact\r\nin the fulfilment of her social duties, had owed a visit to Madame\r\nde Rastignac ever since the evening when the minister’s wife had\r\ninterrupted her conversation with the sculptor apropos of the famous\r\nstatue. Monsieur de l’Estorade, zealous conservative as we know already,\r\nhad insisted that politics and politeness now combined to oblige them\r\nboth to pay this social debt. Arriving early, in order to be rid the\r\nsooner of such a bore, Madame de l’Estorade found herself seated at\r\nthe upper end of a circle of women, while the men stood about them\r\nconversing. Her chair was side by side with that of Madame de Rastignac.\r\n\r\nIn hoping to make her visit short, Madame de l’Estorade had not counted\r\non the allurements of conversation which, under the circumstances of\r\nthis so-called political victory, laid hold of her husband. A man of\r\nmore influence by his judgment than by his oratory in the Chamber of\r\nPeers, Monsieur de l’Estorade, as he circulated through the salons, was\r\nstopped at every turn by the various notabilities of politics, finance,\r\nand diplomacy, and requested to give his opinion on the future of the\r\nsession now about to begin. To all such questions he replied with more\r\nor less extended observations, and sometimes he had the pleasure of\r\nfinding himself the centre of a group respectfully receptive of his\r\nopinions. This success rendered him very inattentive to the telegraphy\r\nof his wife, who, watching his various evolutions, made him signs\r\nwhenever she could catch his eye that she wished to go away.\r\n\r\nThe years that had elapsed since Monsieur de l’Estorade had obtained the\r\nhand of the beautiful Renee de Maucombe, while they had scarcely dimmed\r\nthe splendor of her beauty, had considerably aged her husband. The\r\ntwenty years’ difference in their ages--he being now fifty-two, she\r\nthirty-two--was growing all the more apparent because even at the time\r\nof the marriage he was turning gray and his health was failing. An\r\naffection of the liver, latent for several years, was now developing,\r\nand at the same time the wilful disposition which is noticeable in\r\nstatesmen and men of ambition made his mouth less sensitive to the\r\nconjugal bit. Monsieur de l’Estorade talked so long and so well that\r\nafter a time the salons thinned, leaving a group of the intimates of\r\nthe house around his wife and their hostess. At this moment the minister\r\nhimself slipped an arm through his, and, leading him up to the group\r\nsurrounding their two wives, Rastignac said to Madame de l’Estorade,--\r\n\r\n“I bring you back your husband; I have just found him in criminal\r\nconversation with a member of the Zollverin, who would probably have\r\nclung to him all night if it had not been for me.”\r\n\r\n“I was myself on the point of asking Madame de Rastignac for a bed, that\r\nI might release her from the burden of my company, which Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade’s interminable conversations have put upon her.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Rastignac protested that, on the contrary, she desired\r\nto enjoy as long as possible Madame de l’Estorade’s company, only\r\nregretting that she had been so often obliged to interrupt their\r\nconversation to receive those strange objects, the newly fledged\r\ndeputies, who had come in relays to make their bow to her.\r\n\r\n“Oh! my dear,” cried Rastignac, “here’s the session about to open, and\r\nwe really must not take these disdainful airs toward the elect of the\r\nnation. Besides which, you will get into difficulties with madame, who,\r\nI am told, is the protectress of one of these sovereigns of late date.”\r\n\r\n“I?” said Madame de l’Estorade, rather surprised, and blushing a little.\r\nShe had one of those complexions, still fresh and dazzling, which are\r\npredisposed to these flushes of color.\r\n\r\n“Ah! true,” said Madame de Rastignac; “I had forgotten that artist who\r\ncut out the pretty figures for your children the last time I had the\r\npleasure of paying you a visit. I own I was far from thinking then that\r\nhe would be one of our masters.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, ever since then,” replied Madame de l’Estorade, “his election\r\nhas been talked about; though it must be owned that until now no one\r\nthought seriously of it.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, rather eagerly, seizing the\r\noccasion to put another star to his reputation for prophecy; “from the\r\nfirst political conversation that I had with him I said--and Monsieur de\r\nRonquerolles is here to bear me out--that I was surprised at the ability\r\nand the breadth of aim he manifested.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said the personage thus interpellated, “he is not an\r\nordinary fellow; but I do not believe in his future. He is a man who\r\ngoes by the first impulsion, and, as Monsieur de Talleyrand has wisely\r\nremarked, the first impulse is the good impulse.”\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur?” inquired Madame de l’Estorade, ingenuously.\r\n\r\n“Well, madame,” replied Monsieur de Ronquerolles, who was vain of his\r\nscepticism, “heroism is not of our day; it is heavy baggage, horribly\r\nembarrassing, which gets us into mud-holes continually.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, I believe that great qualities of heart and mind have\r\nsome share in the composition of a distinguished man.”\r\n\r\n“Qualities of mind? Yes, you are right there, provided always they work\r\nin a certain direction. But as for qualities of the heart in political\r\nlife, what good are they?--to hoist you on stilts with which you can’t\r\nwalk as well as you can on the ground, and from which you are liable to\r\nfall and break your neck at the first push.”\r\n\r\n“At that rate,” said Madame de Rastignac, laughing, while Madame de\r\nl’Estorade was silent, disdaining to reply, “the political world must be\r\npeopled by none but scoundrels.”\r\n\r\n“That is so, madame,--ask Lazarille”; and as he made this allusion to a\r\nfamous stage joke, he laid his hand on the minister’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Rastignac, “I think your generalities are a\r\nlittle too particular.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; but come,” returned Monsieur de Ronquerolles, “let us talk\r\nseriously. To my knowledge, this Monsieur de Sallenauve--that is the\r\nname I think he has taken in exchange for Dorlange, which he himself\r\ncalled theatrical--has done, within a short time, two fine actions. I,\r\nbeing present and assisting, saw him stand up to be killed by the Duc de\r\nRhetore, on account of certain ill-sounding words said about a friend.\r\nThose words, in the first place, he could not help hearing; and having\r\nheard them it was, I will not say his duty, but his _right_ to resent\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Madame de Rastignac, “then it was he who fought that duel\r\npeople said so much about?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame, and I ought to say--for I understand such matters--that at\r\nthe meeting he behaved with consummate bravery.”\r\n\r\nTo avoid the recital of the second fine action, Madame de l’Estorade, at\r\nthe risk of impolitely cutting short a topic thus begun, rose, and made\r\nan almost imperceptible sign to her husband that she wished to go. But\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade took advantage of its faintness to stay where he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Ronquerolles continued:--\r\n\r\n“His other fine action was to throw himself in front of some runaway\r\nhorses to save madame’s daughter from imminent death.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned on Madame de l’Estorade, who, this time, blushed deeply;\r\nbut recovering speech, if only in order to seem composed, she said with\r\nfeeling,--\r\n\r\n“According to your theory of heroism you must think Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve very foolish to have thus risked his life and his future; but\r\nI assure you that there is one woman who will never agree with you, and\r\nthat is--the mother of my child.”\r\n\r\nAs she said the words, tears were in Madame de l’Estorade’s voice; she\r\npressed Madame de Rastignac’s hand affectionately, and made so decided a\r\nmovement to leave the room that she finally put in motion her immovable\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Madame de Rastignac, as she accompanied her to\r\nthe door, “for having broken a lance with that cynic; Monsieur de\r\nRastignac’s past life has left him with odious acquaintances.”\r\n\r\nAs she resumed her place, Monsieur de Ronquerolles was saying,--\r\n\r\n“Ha! saved her child’s life indeed! The fact is that poor l’Estorade is\r\nturning as yellow as a lemon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, monsieur, but that is shocking,” cried Madame de Rastignac. “A\r\nwoman whom no breath of slander has ever touched; who lives only for her\r\nhusband and children; whose eyes were full of tears at the mere thought\r\nof the danger the child had run!--”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! madame,” retorted Monsieur de Ronquerolles, paying no heed to\r\nthe rebuke, “all I can say is that newfoundlands are always dangerous.\r\nIf Madame de l’Estorade becomes too much compromised, she has one\r\nresource,--she can marry him to the girl he saved.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Ronquerolles had no sooner said the words than he perceived\r\nthe horrible blunder he had committed in making such a speech before\r\nMademoiselle de Nucingen. He colored high,--a most unusual sign in\r\nhim,--and the solemn silence which seemed to wrap all present completed\r\nhis discomfiture.\r\n\r\n“This clock must be slow,” said the minister, catching at any words\r\nthat would make a sound and break up an evening that was ending\r\nunfortunately.\r\n\r\n“True,” said de Ronquerolles, looking at his watch; “it is a quarter to\r\ntwelve.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed to Madame de Rastignac ceremoniously, and went away, followed\r\nby the rest of the company.\r\n\r\n“You saw his embarrassment,” said Rastignac to his wife; “he had no\r\nmalicious intention in what he said.”\r\n\r\n“It is of no consequence. I was saying just now to Madame de\r\nl’Estorade’s that your past life had given you a number of detestable\r\nacquaintances.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, the King himself is compelled to smile graciously on men\r\nhe would fain put in the Bastille,--if we still had a Bastille and the\r\nCharter permitted him.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Rastignac made no reply, and without bidding her husband\r\ngood-night, she went up to her room. A few moments later the minister\r\nwent to the private door which led into it, and not finding the key in\r\nthe lock, he said, “Augusta!” in the tone of voice a simple bourgeois\r\nmight have used in such a case.\r\n\r\nFor all answer, he heard a bolt run hastily on the other side of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he thought to himself with a gesture of vexation, “there are some\r\npasts very different from that door,--they are always wide open to the\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\nThen, after a moment’s silence, he added, to cover his retreat,\r\n“Augusta, I wanted to ask you what hour Madame de l’Estorade receives. I\r\nought to call upon her to-morrow, after what happened here to-night.”\r\n\r\n“At four o’clock,” said the young wife through the door,--“on her return\r\nfrom the Tuileries, where she takes the children to walk every day.”\r\n\r\nOne of the questions that were frequently put by Parisian society after\r\nthe marriage of Madame de Rastignac was: “Does she love her husband?”\r\n\r\nThe doubt was permissible. The marriage of Mademoiselle de Nucingen was\r\nthe unpleasant and scarcely moral product of one of those immoral\r\nunions which find their issue in the life of a daughter, after years and\r\nsatiety have brought them to a condition of dry-rot and paralysis. In\r\nsuch marriages of _convenience_ the husband is satisfied, for he\r\nescapes a happiness which has turned rancid to him, and he profits by\r\na speculation like that of the magician in the “Arabian Nights” who\r\nexchanges old lamps for new. But the wife, on the contrary, must ever\r\nfeel a living memory between herself and her husband; a memory which may\r\nrevive, and while wholly outside of the empire of the senses, has the\r\nforce of an old authority antagonistic to her young influence. In such a\r\nposition the wife is a victim.\r\n\r\nDuring the short time we have taken to give this brief analysis of a\r\nsituation too frequently existing, Rastignac lingered at the door.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said at last, deciding to retire, “good-night, Augusta.”\r\n\r\nAs he said the words, rather piteously, the door opened suddenly,\r\nand his wife, throwing herself into his arms, laid her head upon his\r\nshoulder sobbing.\r\n\r\nThe question was answered: Madame de Rastignac loved her husband; but\r\nfor all that, the distant muttering of a subterranean fire might be\r\nheard beneath the flowers of their garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A MINISTER’S MORNING\r\n\r\nThe next day, when Rastignac entered his office, the adjoining\r\nwaiting-room was already occupied by eleven persons waiting with letters\r\nof introduction to solicit favors, also two peers of France and several\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\nPresently a bell rang. The usher, with an eagerness which communicated\r\nitself to all present, entered the sanctum; an instant later he came\r\nout, bearing this stereotyped message:--\r\n\r\n“The minister is obliged to attend a Council. He will, however, have the\r\nhonor to receive the gentlemen of the two Chambers. As for the others,\r\nthey can call again at another time.”\r\n\r\n“What other time?” asked one of the postponed; “this is the third time\r\nin three days that I have come here uselessly.”\r\n\r\nThe usher made a gesture which meant, “It is not my affair; I follow my\r\norders.” But hearing certain murmurs as to the _privilege_ granted to\r\nhonorable members, he said, with a certain solemnity,--\r\n\r\n“The honorable gentlemen came to discuss affairs of public interest with\r\nhis Excellency.”\r\n\r\nThe office-seekers, being compelled to accept this fib, departed. After\r\nwhich the bell rang again. The usher then assumed his most gracious\r\nexpression of face. By natural affinity, the lucky ones had gathered in\r\na group at one end of the room. Though they had never seen one another\r\nbefore, most of them being the offspring of the late national lying-in,\r\nthey seemed to recognize a certain representative air which is very\r\ndifficult to define, though it can never be mistaken. The usher, not\r\nventuring to choose among so many eminent personages, turned a mute,\r\ncaressing glance on all, as if to say,--\r\n\r\n“Whom shall I have the honor of first announcing?”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Colonel Franchessini, “I believe I have seen you all\r\narrive.”\r\n\r\nAnd he walked to the closed door, which the usher threw open, announcing\r\nin a loud, clear voice,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Colonel Franchessini!”\r\n\r\n“Ha! so you are the first this morning,” said the minister, making a few\r\nsteps towards the colonel, and giving him his hand. “What have you come\r\nfor, my dear fellow?--a railroad, a canal, a suspension bridge?”\r\n\r\n“I have come, my good-natured minister, on private business in which you\r\nare more interested than I.”\r\n\r\n“That is not a judicious way of urging it, for I warn you I pay little\r\nor no attention to my own business.”\r\n\r\n“I had a visit from Maxime this morning, on his return from\r\nArcis-sur-Aube,” said the colonel, coming to the point. “He gave me all\r\nthe particulars of that election. He thinks a spoke might be put in the\r\nwheel of it. Now, if you have time to let me make a few explanations--”\r\n\r\nThe minister, who was sitting before his desk with his back to the\r\nfireplace, turned round to look at the clock.\r\n\r\n“Look here, my dear fellow,” he said, “I’m afraid you will be long, and\r\nI have a hungry pack outside there waiting for me. I shouldn’t listen to\r\nyou comfortably. Do me the favor to go and take a walk and come back at\r\ntwelve o’clock to breakfast. I’ll present you to Madame de Rastignac,\r\nwhom you don’t know, I think, and after breakfast we will take a few\r\nturns in the garden; then I can listen to you in peace.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, I accept that arrangement,” said the colonel, rising.\r\n\r\nAs he crossed the waiting-room, he said,--\r\n\r\n“Messieurs, I have not delayed you long, I hope.”\r\n\r\nThen, after distributing a few grasps of the hand, he departed.\r\n\r\nThree hours later, when the colonel entered the salon where he was\r\npresented to Madame de Rastignac, he found there the Baron de Nucingen,\r\nwho came nearly every day to breakfast with his son-in-law before\r\nthe Bourse hour, Emile Blondet of the “Debats,” Messieurs Moreau (de\r\nl’Oise), Dionis, and Camusot, three deputies madly loquacious, and two\r\nnewly elected deputies whose names it is doubtful if Rastignac knew\r\nhimself. Franchessini also recognized Martial de la Roche-Hugon, the\r\nminister’s brother-in-law, and the inevitable des Lupeaulx, peer of\r\nFrance. As for another figure, who stood talking with the minister\r\nfor some time in the recess of a window, the colonel learned, after\r\ninquiring of Emile Blondet, that it was that of a former functionary of\r\nthe upper police, who continued, as an amateur, to do part of his former\r\nbusiness, going daily to each minister under all administrations with as\r\nmuch zeal and regularity as if he were still charged with his official\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rastignac seen at close quarters seemed to the colonel a\r\nhandsome blonde, not at all languishing. She was strikingly like\r\nher mother, but with that shade of greater distinction which in the\r\ndescendants of parvenus increases from generation to generation as they\r\nadvance from their source. The last drop of the primitive Goriot blood\r\nhad evaporated in this charming young woman, who was particularly\r\nremarkable for the high-bred delicacy of all her extremities, the\r\nabsence of which in Madame de Nucingen had shown the daughter of Pere\r\nGoriot.\r\n\r\nAs the colonel wished to retain a footing in the house he now entered\r\nfor the first time, he talked about his wife.\r\n\r\n“She lived,” he said, “in the old English fashion, in her _home_; but he\r\nshould be most glad to bring her out of her retreat in order to present\r\nher to Madame de Rastignac if the latter would graciously consent.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the minister, dropping the arm of Emile Blondet, with whom\r\nhe had been conversing, “let us go into the garden,”--adding, as soon as\r\nthey were alone, “We want no ears about us in this matter.”\r\n\r\n“Maxime came to see me, as I told you,” said the colonel, “on his return\r\nfrom Arcis-sur-Aube, and he is full of an idea of discovering something\r\nabout the pretended parentage of this sculptor by which to oust him--”\r\n\r\n“I know,” interrupted Rastignac; “he spoke to me about that idea, and\r\nthere’s neither rhyme nor reason in it. Either this Sallenauve has some\r\nvalue, or he is a mere cipher. If the latter, it is useless to employ\r\nsuch a dangerous instrument as the man Maxime proposes to neutralize a\r\npower that does not exist. If, on the other hand, this new deputy\r\nproves really an orator, we can deal with him in the tribune and in the\r\nnewspapers without the help of such underground measures. General rule:\r\nin a land of unbridled publicity like ours, wherever the hand of the\r\npolice appears, if even to lay bare the most shameful villany, there’s\r\nalways a hue and cry against the government. Public opinion behaves like\r\nthe man to whom another man sang an air of Mozart to prove that Mozart\r\nwas a great musician. Was he vanquished by evidence? ‘Mozart,’ he\r\nreplied to the singer, ‘may have been a great musician, but you, my dear\r\nfellow, have a cold in your head.’”\r\n\r\n“There’s a great deal of truth in what you say,” replied Franchessini;\r\n“but the man whom Maxime wants to unmask may be one of those\r\nhonest mediocrities who make themselves a thorn in the side of all\r\nadministrations; your most dangerous adversaries are not the giants of\r\noratory.”\r\n\r\n“I expect to find out the real weight of the man before long,” replied\r\nRastignac, “from a source I have more confidence in than I have in\r\nMonsieur de Trailles. On this very occasion he has allowed himself to be\r\ntripped up, and now wants to compensate by heroic measures for his own\r\nlack of ability. As for your other man, I shall not employ him for the\r\npurpose Maxime suggests, but you may tell him from me--”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Franchessini, with redoubled attention.\r\n\r\n“--that if he meddles in politics, as he shows an inclination to do,\r\nthere are certain deplorable memories in his life--”\r\n\r\n“But they are only memories now; he has made himself a new skin.”\r\n\r\n“I know all about him,” replied Rastignac; “do you suppose there are\r\nno other detectives in Paris? I know that since 1830, when he took\r\nBibi-Lupin’s place as chief of the detective police, he has given his\r\nlife a most respectable bourgeois character; the only fault I find is\r\nthat he overdoes it.”\r\n\r\n“And yet--” said the colonel.\r\n\r\n“He is rich,” continued Rastignac, not heeding the interruption. “His\r\nsalary is twelve thousand francs, and he has the three hundred thousand\r\nLucien de Rubempre left him,--also the proceeds of a manufactory of\r\nvarnished leather which he started at Gentilly; it pays him a large\r\nprofit. His aunt, Jacqueline Collin, who lives with him, still does a\r\nshady business secretly, which of course brings in large fees, and I\r\nhave the best of reasons for believing that they both gamble at the\r\nBourse. He is so anxious to keep out of the mud that he has gone to the\r\nother extreme. Every evening he plays dominoes, like any bourgeois, in\r\na cafe near the Prefecture, and Sundays he goes out to a little box of a\r\nplace he has bought near the forest of Romainville, in the Saint-Gervais\r\nmeadows; there he cultivates blue dahlias, and talked, last year, of\r\ncrowning a Rosiere. All that, my dear colonel, is too bucolic to allow\r\nof my employing him on any political police-work.”\r\n\r\n“I think myself,” said Franchessini, “that in order not to attract\r\nattention, he rolls himself too much into a ball.”\r\n\r\n“Make him unwind, and then, if he wants to return to active life and\r\ntake a hand in politics, he may find some honest way of doing so. He’ll\r\nnever make a Saint Vincent de Paul,--though the saint was at the galleys\r\nonce upon a time; but there are plenty of ways in which he could get a\r\nthird or fourth class reputation. If Monsieur de Saint-Esteve, as he now\r\ncalls himself, takes that course, and I am still in power, tell him to\r\ncome and see me; I might employ him then.”\r\n\r\n“That is something, certainly,” said Franchessini, aloud; but he thought\r\nto himself that since the days of the pension Vauquer the minister\r\nhad taken long strides and that roles had changed between himself and\r\nVautrin.\r\n\r\n“You can tell him what I say,” continued Rastignac, going up the steps\r\nof the portico, “but be cautious how you word it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy,” replied the colonel. “I will speak to him\r\njudiciously, for he’s a man who must not be pushed too far; there are\r\nsome old scores in life one can’t wipe out.”\r\n\r\nThe minister, by making no reply to this remark, seemed to admit the\r\ntruth of it.\r\n\r\n“You must be in the Chamber when the king opens it; we shall want all\r\nthe enthusiasm we can muster,” said Rastignac to the colonel, as they\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nThe latter, when he took leave of Madame de Rastignac, asked on what day\r\nhe might have the honor of presenting his wife.\r\n\r\n“Why, any day,” replied the countess, “but particularly on Fridays.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. A CATECHISM\r\n\r\nRastignac called on Madame de l’Estorade the next day at the hour named\r\nto him by his wife. Like all those present at the scene produced by\r\nMonsieur de Ronquerolles, the minister had been struck by the emotion\r\nshown by the countess, and, without stopping to analyze the nature of\r\nthe sentiment she might feel for the man who had saved her child, he was\r\nconvinced of her serious interest in him.\r\n\r\nBy the suddenness and the masterly stroke of his election, Sallenauve\r\nhad become an object of strong interest to the minister,--all the\r\nmore because up to the last moment his candidacy was not seriously\r\nconsidered. It was now known that in the preparatory meeting he had\r\ngiven proofs of talent. To his active and dangerous party, which had but\r\nfew representatives in the Chamber, he might become an organ that would\r\necho far. By his peculiar position of birth and fortune, whatever\r\nmight be the truth of it, he was one who could do without the favors of\r\ngovernment; and all information obtained about him went to show that he\r\nwas a man of grave character and opinions, who could not be turned from\r\nhis chosen way.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the cloud upon his life might at a given moment serve\r\nto neutralize his honor; and Rastignac, while rejecting the proposal of\r\nde Trailles and Franchessini to put the mystery into the hands of the\r\npolice, did not himself renounce a means which, dangerous as it seemed\r\nto him, he might use if occasion warranted.\r\n\r\nIn this situation Madame de l’Estorade could be useful to him in two\r\nways. Through her he could meet the new deputy accidentally, without\r\nappearing to seek him, and thus study him at his ease, in order to know\r\nif he had a vulnerable point accessible to persuasion. And, secondly,\r\nif he found him unpersuadable, he could let Madame de l’Estorade know\r\nin confidence of the secret inquiry about to be carried on into\r\nSallenauve’s antecedents, which, conveyed by her to the deputy,\r\nwould have the effect of making him cautious and, consequently, less\r\naggressive.\r\n\r\nHowever, his immediate plan suffered some modification; for Madame\r\nde l’Estorade was not at home, and he was just leaving the house when\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade returned on foot.\r\n\r\n“My wife will be here soon,” he said; “she has gone to Ville d’Avray\r\nwith her daughter, and Monsieur and Madame Octave de Camps. Monsieur\r\nMarie-Gaston, one of our good friends,--you know, the charming poet who\r\nmarried Louise de Chaulieu,--has a country-house in that neighborhood,\r\nwhere his wife died. He returned there to-day for the first time since\r\nhis misfortune; and these ladies have had the charity to meet him there,\r\nand so lessen the first shock of his recollections.”\r\n\r\n“I can therefore hardly hope to see her to-day; and it was to her, and\r\nnot to you, my dear count, that I came to offer my excuses for the scene\r\nof last night which seemed to annoy her much. Say to her, if you please,\r\nthat I will take another opportunity of doing so,--By the bye,” he\r\nadded, “the election of your friend Sallenauve is making a devilish\r\ntalk; the king spoke to me about it this morning, and I did not please\r\nhim by repeating the favorable opinion you expressed of the new deputy\r\nlast night.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but you know the tribune is a reef on which reputations are often\r\nwrecked. I am sorry you represented Sallenauve to the king as being on\r\nintimate terms with us. I have nothing to do with elections; but I may\r\nsay that I did all I could to dissuade this objectionable candidate from\r\npresenting himself.”\r\n\r\n“Of course the king cannot blame you for merely knowing an Opposition\r\ndeputy.”\r\n\r\n“No; but last night, in your salon, you seemed to imply that my wife\r\nwas much interested in him. I did not wish to contradict you before\r\nwitnesses; besides, really, one can’t repudiate a man to whom we\r\nare under a great obligation. But my wife, ever since the day he was\r\nnominated, feels that our gratitude has become a burden. She was saying\r\nto me the other day that we had better let the acquaintance die out.”\r\n\r\n“Not, I hope, until you have done me a service by means of it,” said\r\nRastignac.\r\n\r\n“At your orders, my dear minister, in all things.”\r\n\r\n“I want to meet this man and judge him for myself. To send him an\r\ninvitation to dinner would be useless; under the eye of his party, he\r\nwould not dare accept it, or if he did, he would be on his guard, and\r\nI should not see him as he is. But if I met him accidentally, I should\r\nfind him without armor, and I could feel for his vulnerable spots.”\r\n\r\n“To invite you both to dine with me might be open to the same objection;\r\nbut I could, one of these evenings, make sure of a visit from him, and\r\nlet you know--Stop!” cried Monsieur de l’Estorade; “a bright idea has\r\ncome to me.”\r\n\r\n“If it is really bright,” thought Rastignac, “it is fortunate I did not\r\nmeet the wife.”\r\n\r\n“We are just about to give a children’s ball,--a fancy of my little\r\ngirl, to which Madame de l’Estorade, weary of refusing, has at last\r\nconsented; the child wishes it to be given in celebration of her rescue.\r\nOf course, therefore, the rescuer is a necessary and integral part of\r\nthe affair. Come to the ball, and I promise you noise enough to cover\r\nall investigations of your man; and certainly premeditation will never\r\nbe suspected at such a meeting.”\r\n\r\n“You are too good,” replied Rastignac, pressing the peer’s hand\r\naffectionately. “Perhaps we had better say nothing about it to Madame de\r\nl’Estorade; a mere hint given to our man would put him on his guard, and\r\nI want to spring upon him suddenly, like a tiger on his prey.”\r\n\r\n“That’s understood--complete surprise to everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu, then,” said Rastignac; “I shall make the king laugh to-morrow at\r\nthe notion of children plotting politics.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” replied Monsieur de l’Estorade, philosophically, “but isn’t that\r\nhow life itself is carried on?--great effects from little causes.”\r\n\r\nRastignac had scarcely departed before Madame de l’Estorade returned\r\nwith Nais and Monsieur and Madame de Camps.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said her husband, “you have just missed a charming visitor.”\r\n\r\n“Who was it?” asked the countess, indifferently.\r\n\r\n“The minister of Public Works, who came to make you his excuses. He\r\nnoticed with regret the disagreeable impression made upon you by the\r\ntheories of that scamp de Ronquerolles.”\r\n\r\n“He has taken a good deal of trouble for a very small matter,” said\r\nMadame de l’Estorade, not sharing her husband’s enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“But all the same,” he replied, “it was very gracious of him to think\r\nof your feelings.” Then, in order to change the conversation, he asked\r\nMadame de Camps about their visit.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she replied, “the place is enchanting; you have no idea of its\r\nelegance and _comfort_.”\r\n\r\n“How about Gaston?” asked Monsieur de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“He was, I won’t say very calm,” replied Madame de l’Estorade, “but\r\nat any rate master of himself. His condition satisfied me all the more\r\nbecause the day had begun by a serious annoyance to him.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Sallenauve could not come with him,” replied Nais, taking\r\nupon herself to reply.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those children brought up in a hot-house, who put\r\nthemselves forward much oftener than they ought to do.\r\n\r\n“Nais,” said Madame de l’Estorade, “go to Mary and tell her to do up\r\nyour hair.”\r\n\r\nThe child understood perfectly well that she was sent away for speaking\r\nimproperly, and she made a face as she left the room.\r\n\r\n“This morning,” said Madame de l’Estorade as soon as Nais had shut the\r\ndoor, “Monsieur Gaston and Monsieur de Sallenauve were to start together\r\nfor Ville d’Avray, and meet us there, as agreed upon. But last night\r\nthey had a visit from that organist who took such an active part in the\r\nelection. He came to hear the Italian housekeeper sing and judge if she\r\nwere ready to go upon the stage.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade; “of course Sallenauve wants to\r\nget rid of her now that he has ceased to make statues.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied Madame de l’Estorade, with a slight tone of asperity.\r\n“In order to put a stop to all calumny Monsieur de Sallenauve wishes her\r\nto carry out her idea of going on the stage; but he wanted, in the\r\nfirst place, an opinion he could trust. Monsieur Gaston and Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve accompanied the organist to Saint-Sulpice, where, during the\r\nservices of the Month of Mary, the Italian woman sings every evening.\r\nAfter hearing her, the organist said she had a fine contralto that was\r\nworth, at the lowest, sixty thousand francs a year.”\r\n\r\n“Just the revenue of my iron-works,” remarked Monsieur de Camps.\r\n\r\n“That evening,” continued Madame de l’Estorade, “Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\ntold his housekeeper the opinion given of her talent, and with great\r\nkindness and delicacy let her know that she must now carry out her\r\nintention of supporting herself in that way. ‘Yes,’ she replied, ‘I\r\nthink the time has come. We will talk of it later’; and she stopped the\r\nconversation. This morning when the breakfast hour came, there was no\r\nsign of her. Thinking she must be ill, Monsieur de Sallenauve sent\r\nan old charwoman who does the rough work of the house to her room. No\r\nanswer. Much disturbed, Monsieur Gaston and Monsieur de Sallenauve went\r\nthemselves to see what it meant. After knocking and calling in vain,\r\nthey determined to open the door, the key of which was outside. In the\r\nroom no housekeeper! but in place of her a letter addressed to Monsieur\r\nde Sallenauve, in which she said that finding herself an embarrassment\r\nto him, she had retired to the house of one of her friends, thanking him\r\nfor all his goodness to her.”\r\n\r\n“The bird has found its wings,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, “and takes\r\nflight.”\r\n\r\n“That is not Monsieur de Sallenauve’s idea,” replied the countess; “he\r\ndoes not believe in such ingratitude. He is confident that, feeling\r\nherself a burden to him and yielding to the desperation which is natural\r\nto her, she felt obliged to leave his house without giving him a chance\r\nin any manner to provide for her future.”\r\n\r\n“A good riddance!” remarked Monsieur de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“Neither Monsieur de Sallenauve nor Monsieur Gaston takes that stoical\r\nview of it. In view of the headstrong nature of the woman, they fear\r\nsome violence to herself, which, as we know, she once attempted. Or else\r\nthey dread some evil adviser. The charwoman states that two or three\r\nvisits have been lately made at the house by a lady of middle age,\r\nrichly dressed, in a carriage, whose manner was singular, and who seemed\r\nto desire secrecy in speaking with Luigia.”\r\n\r\n“Some charitable woman, of course,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade; “the\r\nrunaway is given to piety.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate the truth must be discovered, and it was that which kept\r\nMonsieur de Sallenauve from accompanying Monsieur Gaston to Ville\r\nd’Avray.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” remarked Monsieur de l’Estorade, “in spite of their respective\r\nvirtue, it is my opinion he holds by her.”\r\n\r\n“In any case,” returned Madame de l’Estorade, emphasizing the word, “she\r\ndoes not _hold_ by him.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree with you,” said Madame de Camps; “to avoid a man is often\r\nthe greatest proof of love.”\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade looked at her friend with a vexed air, and a slight\r\ntinge of color came into her cheeks. But no one took notice of it, for\r\nat this moment the servant threw open the door and announced dinner.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the theatre was proposed; that is one of the amusements\r\nthat Parisians miss the most in the provinces. Monsieur Octave de Camps,\r\ncoming from his “villanous iron-works,” as Madame de l’Estorade called\r\nthem, had arrived in Paris eager for this pleasure, which his wife, more\r\nserious and sober, did not enjoy to the same extent. Therefore, when\r\nMonsieur de Camps proposed going to the Porte-Saint-Martin to see a\r\nfairy piece then much in vogue, Madame Octave replied:--\r\n\r\n“Neither Madame de l’Estorade nor I have the least desire to go out this\r\nevening; we are very tired with our expedition. Take Rene and Nais; they\r\nwill enjoy the fairies far more than we.”\r\n\r\nThe two children awaited in deep anxiety the permission which Madame\r\nde l’Estorade finally granted; and a few moments later the two friends,\r\nleft to themselves, prepared for an evening of comfortable talk.\r\n\r\n“I am not at home to any one,” said Madame de l’Estorade to Lucas, as\r\nsoon as her family had departed.\r\n\r\n“Now that we are alone,” said Madame de Camps, “I shall proceed to\r\nblows; I have not travelled two hundred miles to wrap up in cotton-wool\r\nthe truth I have come to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Ready to hear it,” said Madame de l’Estorade, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Your last letter, my dear, simply frightened me.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Because I told you I was trying to keep a man at a distance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why keep him at a distance? If Monsieur de Camps or Monsieur\r\nGaston or Monsieur de Rastignac were to make a practice of coming here\r\nhabitually, would you trouble yourself about them?”\r\n\r\n“No; but they have not the same claim upon me: it is that I fear.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, do you think Monsieur de Sallenauve loves you?”\r\n\r\n“No; I am now quite sure to the contrary; and I also think that on my\r\nside--”\r\n\r\n“We’ll talk about that presently; now I want to ask if you desire\r\nMonsieur de Sallenauve to love you?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven forbid!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, the best possible way to make him do so is to wound his\r\nself-love, and show yourself unjust and ungrateful to him; you will only\r\nforce him to think the more of you.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear friend, isn’t that a very far-fetched observation?”\r\n\r\n“Did you never observe that men are more taken by our snubs than by our\r\ncaresses? Severity fixes their attention upon us.”\r\n\r\n“If that were so, all the men we disdain and never think of would sigh\r\nfor us.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! my dear, don’t make me talk such nonsense. To take fire, a man must\r\nhave some degree of combustibility; and if that _other_ person is lost\r\nto him forever, why shouldn’t he, as you said yourself, ricochet upon\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“That other person is not lost to him; he expects, more than ever, to\r\nfind her by the help of a very clever seeker, the mother-superior of a\r\nconvent at Arcis.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; then why employ the delay in holding him at arm’s-length,--a\r\nproceeding which will only draw him towards you?”\r\n\r\n“My dear moralist, I don’t admit your theory in the least. As for\r\nMonsieur de Sallenauve, he will be much too busy with his duties in\r\nthe Chamber to think of me. Besides, he is a man who is full of\r\nself-respect; he will be mortified by my manner, which will seem to him\r\nboth ungrateful and unjust. If I try to put two feet of distance between\r\nus, he will put four; you may rely on that.”\r\n\r\n“And _you_, my dear?” asked Madame de Camps.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?--I?”\r\n\r\n“You who are not busy, who have no Chamber to occupy your mind; you who\r\nhave, I will agree, a great deal of self-respect, but who know as little\r\nabout the things of the heart as the veriest school-girl,--what\r\nwill become of you under the dangerous system you are imposing upon\r\nyourself?”\r\n\r\n“If I don’t love him when near, I shall certainly love him still less at\r\na distance.”\r\n\r\n“So that when you see him take his ostracism coolly, your self-love as a\r\nwoman will not be piqued.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not; that is precisely the result I desire.”\r\n\r\n“And if you find, on the contrary, that he complains of you, or if\r\nhe does not complain, that he suffers from your treatment, will your\r\nconscience tell you absolutely nothing?”\r\n\r\n“It will tell me that I am doing right, and that I could not do\r\notherwise.”\r\n\r\n“And if success attends him and fame with its hundred voices talks of\r\nhim, how will you think of him?”\r\n\r\n“As I think of Monsieur Thiers and Monsieur Berryer.”\r\n\r\n“And Nais, who adores him and will probably say, the first time he dines\r\nwith you, ‘Ah! mamma, how well he talks!’--”\r\n\r\n“If you are going to argue on the chatter of a child--”\r\n\r\n“And Monsieur de l’Estorade, who already irritates you? He is beginning\r\nto-day to sacrifice him to the spirit of party; shall you silence\r\nhim every time he makes some malevolent insinuation about Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve, and denies his honor and his talent?--you know the judgment\r\npeople make on those who do not think as we do.”\r\n\r\n“In short,” said Madame de l’Estorade, “you are trying to make me admit\r\nthat the surest way to think of a person is to put him out of sight.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, my dear,” said Madame de Camps, with a slight touch of\r\ngravity. “I have read and re-read your letters. You were there your\r\nown self, more natural and less quibbling than you are now, and an\r\nimpression has remained upon my mind: it is that Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\nhas touched your heart, though he may not have entered it.”\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade made a gesture of denial, but the confessor went\r\non:--\r\n\r\n“I know that idea provokes you; you can’t very well admit to me what you\r\nhave studiously denied to yourself. But what is, is. We don’t say of\r\na man, ‘A sort of magnetism issues from him, one feels his eye without\r\nmeeting it’; we don’t cry out, ‘I am invulnerable on the side of love,’\r\nwithout having had some prickings of it.”\r\n\r\n“But so many things have happened since I wrote that nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“True, he was only a sculptor then, and before long he may be a\r\nminister,--not like Monsieur de Rastignac, but like our great poet,\r\nCanalis.”\r\n\r\n“I like sermons with definite deductions,” said Madame de l’Estorade,\r\nwith a touch of impatience.\r\n\r\n“That is what Vergniaud said to Robespierre on the 31st of May, and I\r\nreply, with Robespierre, Yes, I’ll draw my conclusion; and it is\r\nagainst your self-confidence as a woman, who, having reached the age\r\nof thirty-two without a suspicion of what love is, cannot admit that at\r\nthis late date she may be subjected to the common law.”\r\n\r\n“But what I want is a practical conclusion,” said Madame de l’Estorade,\r\ntapping her foot.\r\n\r\n“My practical conclusion,--here it is,” replied Madame Octave. “If you\r\nwill not persist in the folly of swimming against the current, I see\r\nno danger whatever in your being submerged. You are strong; you have\r\nprinciples and religion; you adore your children; you love Monsieur\r\nde l’Estorade, their father, in them. With all that ballast you cannot\r\nsink.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Madame de l’Estorade, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n“Well, there is no need to have recourse to violent measures, the\r\nsuccess of which is very problematical. Remain as you are; build no\r\nbarricades when no one attacks you. Don’t excite tempests of heart and\r\nconscience merely to pacify your conscience and quiet your heart, now\r\nruffled only by a tiny breeze. No doubt between a man and a woman the\r\nsentiment of friendship does take something of the character ordinarily\r\ngiven to love; but such friendship is neither an impossible illusion nor\r\nis it a yawning gulf.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Madame de l’Estorade, with a thoughtful air, “do you wish\r\nme to make a friend of Monsieur de Sallenauve?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, in order not to make him a fixed idea, a regret, a\r\nstruggle,--three things which poison life.”\r\n\r\n“But my husband, who has already had a touch of jealousy?”\r\n\r\n“As for your husband, I find him somewhat changed, and not for the\r\nbetter. I miss that deference he always showed to you personally, to\r\nyour ideas and impressions,--a deference which honored him more than he\r\nthought, because there is true greatness in the power to admire. I\r\nmay be mistaken, but it seems to me that public life is spoiling him\r\na little. As you cannot be with him in the Chamber of peers, he is\r\nbeginning to suspect that he can have a life without you. If I were you,\r\nI should watch these symptoms of independence, and not let the work of\r\nyour lifetime come to nought.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my dear,” said Madame de l’Estorade, laughing, “that you\r\nare giving me advice that may end in fire and slaughter?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I am a woman forty-five years of age, who has always seen\r\nthings on their practical side. I did not marry my husband, whom I\r\nloved, until I had convinced myself, by putting him to the test, that\r\nhe was worthy of my esteem. I don’t make life; I take it as it\r\ncomes,--trying to put order and _possibility_ into all the occurrences\r\nit brings to me. I an neither the frenzied passion of Louise de\r\nChaulieu, nor the insensible reason of Renee de Maucombe. I am a Jesuit\r\nin petticoats, persuaded that rather wide sleeves are better than\r\nsleeves that are tight to the wrist; and I have never gone in search of\r\nthe philosopher’s stone--”\r\n\r\nAt this instant Lucas opened the door of the salon and announced,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Comte de Sallenauve.”\r\n\r\nHis mistress gave him a look inquiring why he had disobeyed her orders,\r\nto which Lucas replied by a sign implying that he did not suppose the\r\nprohibition applied in this instance.\r\n\r\nMadame de Camps, who had never yet seen the new deputy, now gave her\r\nclosest attention to a study of him.\r\n\r\nSallenauve explained his visit by his great desire to know how matters\r\nhad gone at Ville d’Avray, and whether Marie-Gaston had been deeply\r\naffected by his return there. As for the business which detained him\r\nin Paris, he said he had so far met with no success. He had seen\r\nthe prefect of police, who had given him a letter to Monsieur\r\nde Saint-Esteve, the chief of the detective police. Aware of the\r\nantecedents of that man, Monsieur de Sallenauve expressed himself as\r\nmuch surprised to find a functionary with extremely good manners and\r\nbearing; but he held out faint hope of success. “A woman hiding in\r\nParis,” he said, “is an eel in its safest hole.” He (Sallenauve) should\r\ncontinue the search the next day with the help of Jacques Bricheteau;\r\nbut if nothing came of it, he should go in the evening to Ville d’Avray,\r\nfor he did not, he said, share Madame de l’Estorade’s security as to\r\nGaston’s state of mind.\r\n\r\nAs he was taking leave, Madame de l’Estorade said to him,--\r\n\r\n“Do not forget Nais’ ball which takes place the day after to-morrow.\r\nYou will affront her mortally if you fail to be present. Try to bring\r\nMonsieur Gaston with you. It might divert his mind a little.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. CHILDREN\r\n\r\nOn his return from the theatre Monsieur Octave de Camps declared that it\r\nwould be long before they caught him at a _fairy_ piece again. But Nais,\r\non the contrary, still under the spell of its marvels gave a lively\r\nrecital of the scene, which showed how much her imagination was capable\r\nof being stirred.\r\n\r\nAs Madame de Camps and her husband walked away together, the former\r\nremarked,--\r\n\r\n“That child is really very disquieting. Madame de l’Estorade develops\r\nher too much; I should not be surprised if she gave her a great deal of\r\ntrouble in future years.”\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to mark the precise moment in our contemporary\r\nhabits and customs when a new species of religion, which might be called\r\nchild-idolatry, appeared. Nor shall we find it easier to discover by\r\nwhat species of influence this worship has reached its present enormous\r\ndevelopment among us. But, although unexplained, the fact exists and\r\nought to be recorded by every faithful historian of the great and the\r\nlittle movements of society. In the family of to-day children have taken\r\nthe place of the household gods of the ancients, and whoever does not\r\nshare this worship is not a morose and sour spirit, nor a captious and\r\nannoying reasoner,--he is simply an atheist.\r\n\r\nTry to amuse one of these beloved adored ones, all puffed up, as they\r\nnaturally are, by a sense of their importance, with dolls and toys\r\nand Punch-and-Judys, as in the days of our unsophisticated innocence!\r\nNonsense! Boys must have ponies and cigarettes, and the reading of\r\nnovelettes; and girls, the delight of playing hostess, giving afternoon\r\ndances, and evening parties at which the real Guignol of the Champs\r\nElysees and Robert Houdin appear,--the entertainment being announced\r\non the invitation cards. Sometimes, as now in the case of Nais de\r\nl’Estorade, these little sovereigns obtain permission to give a ball in\r\n_grown-up_ style,--so much so, that policemen are stationed about the\r\ndoors, and Delisle, Nattier, and Prevost provide the toilets and the\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nWith the character we have already seen in Nais, it may be said that no\r\none was better fitted than she for the duties that devolved upon her\r\nby the abdication of her mother. This abdication took place before the\r\nevening of the ball itself, for it was Mademoiselle Nais de l’Estorade\r\nwho, in her own name, invited her guests to do her the honor to pass\r\nthe evening _chez elle_; and as Madame de l’Estorade would not allow the\r\nparody to go as far as printed cards, Nais spent several days\r\nwriting her notes of invitation, taking care to put in the corner, in\r\nconspicuous letters, the sacramental word, “Dancing.”\r\n\r\nNothing could be more curious, or, as Madame de Camps might have said,\r\nmore alarming, than the self-possession of this little girl of fourteen,\r\nbehaving precisely as she had seen her mother do on like occasions;\r\nstationed, to receive her company, at the door of the salon, and marking\r\nby her manner the proper grades of welcome, from eager cordiality to a\r\ncoldness that verged on disdain. To her best friends she gave her hand\r\nin truly English style; for the rest she had smiles, apportioned to the\r\ndegrees of intimacy,--simple inclination of the head for unknown\r\nguests or those of less account; with little speeches now and then, and\r\ndelicious mamma-like airs for the tiny children whom it is necessary to\r\nask to these juvenile routs, however dangerous and difficult to manage\r\nthat element may be.\r\n\r\nWith the fathers and mothers of her guests, as the ball was not given\r\nfor them, Nais as a general thing reversed the nature of the Gospel\r\ninvocation, _Sinite parvulos venire ad me_, and was careful not to\r\npass the limit of cold though respectful politeness. But when Lucas,\r\nfollowing the instructions he had received, reversed the natural order\r\nof things and announced, “Mesdemoiselles de la Roche-Hugon, Madame la\r\nBaronne de la Roche-Hugon, and Madame la Comtesse de Rastignac,” the\r\nlittle strategist laid aside her reserve, and, running up to the wife of\r\nthe minister, she took her hand and pressed it to her lips with charming\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nAfter the dancing began, Nais was unable to accept all the invitations\r\nwhich the elegant young lions vied with one another in pressing upon\r\nher; in fact, she grew sadly confused as to the number and order of\r\nher engagements,--a circumstance which very nearly led, in spite of the\r\n_entente cordiale_, to an open rupture between France and perfidious\r\nAlbion. A quadrille doubly promised, to a young English peer aged ten\r\nand a pupil in the Naval School of about the same years, came very near\r\nproducing unpleasant complications, inasmuch as the young British scion\r\nof nobility had assumed a boxing attitude. That fray pacified, another\r\nannoying episode occurred. A small boy, seeing a servant with a tray of\r\nrefreshments and being unable to reach up to the objects of his greed,\r\nhad the deplorable idea of putting his hand on the edge of the tray and\r\nbending it down to him. Result: a cascade of mingled orgeat, negus,\r\nand syrups; and happy would it have been had the young author of this\r\nmischief been the only sufferer from the sugary torrent; but, alas!\r\nnearly a dozen innocent victims were splashed and spattered by the\r\ndisastrous accident,--among them four or five bacchantes, who were\r\nfurious at seeing their toilets injured, and would fain have made an\r\nOrpheus of the clumsy infant. While he was being rescued with great\r\ndifficulty from their clutches by the German governess, a voice was\r\nheard amid the hubbub,--that of a pretty little blonde, saying to a\r\nsmall Scottish youth with whom she had danced the whole evening,--\r\n\r\n“How odd of Nais to invite little boys of that age!”\r\n\r\n“That’s easily explained,” said the Scottish youth; “he’s a boy of the\r\nTreasury department. Nais had to ask him on account of her parents,--a\r\nmatter of policy, you know.”\r\n\r\nThen, taking the arm of one of his friends, the same youth continued:--\r\n\r\n“Hey, Ernest,” he said, “I’d like a cigar; suppose we find a quiet\r\ncorner, out of the way of all this racket?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t, my dear fellow,” replied Ernest, in a whisper; “you know\r\nLeontine always makes me a scene when she smells I’ve been smoking, and\r\nshe is charming to me to-night. See, look at what she has given me!”\r\n\r\n“A horse-hair ring!” exclaimed the Scot, disdainfully, “with two locked\r\nhearts; all the boys at school have them.”\r\n\r\n“What have you to show that’s better?” replied Ernest, in a piqued tone.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the Scot, with a superior air, “something much better.”\r\n\r\nAnd drawing from the pouch which formed an integral part of his costume\r\na note on violet paper highly perfumed,--\r\n\r\n“There,” he said, putting it under Ernest’s nose, “smell that!”\r\n\r\nIndelicate friend that he was, Ernest pounced upon the note and took\r\npossession of it. The Scottish youth, furious, flung himself upon the\r\ntreacherous French boy; on which Monsieur de l’Estorade, a thousand\r\nleagues from imagining the subject of the quarrel, intervened and parted\r\nthe combatants, which enabled the ravisher to escape into a corner of\r\nthe salon to enjoy his booty. The note contained no writing. The young\r\nscamp had probably taken the paper out of his mother’s blotting-book.\r\nA moment after, returning to his adversary and giving him the note, he\r\nsaid in a jeering tone,--\r\n\r\n“There’s your note; it is awfully compromising.”\r\n\r\n“Keep it, monsieur,” replied the Scot. “I shall ask for it to-morrow\r\nin the Tuileries, under the horse-chestnuts; meantime, you will please\r\nunderstand that all intercourse is at an end between us.”\r\n\r\nErnest was less knightly; he contented himself with putting the thumb\r\nof his right hand to his nose and spreading the fingers,--an ironical\r\ngesture he had acquired from his mother’s coachman; after which he ran\r\nto find his partner for the next quadrille.\r\n\r\nBut what details are these on which we are wasting time, when we know\r\nthat interests of the highest order are moving, subterraneously, beneath\r\nthe surface of the children’s ball.\r\n\r\nArriving from Ville d’Avray late in the afternoon, Sallenauve had\r\nbrought Madame de l’Estorade ill news of Marie-Gaston. Under an\r\nappearance of resignation, he was gloomy, and, singular to say, he had\r\nnot visited the grave of his wife,--as if he feared an emotion he might\r\nnot have the power to master. It seemed to Sallenauve that his friend\r\nhad come to the end of his strength, and that a mental prostration of\r\nthe worst character was succeeding the over-excitement he had shown at\r\nhis election. One thing reassured the new deputy, and enabled him to\r\ncome to Paris for, at any rate, a few hours. A friend of Marie-Gaston,\r\nan English nobleman with whom he had been intimate in Florence, came out\r\nto see him, and the sad man greeted the new-comer with apparent joy.\r\n\r\nIn order to distract Sallenauve’s thoughts from this anxiety, Madame de\r\nl’Estorade introduced him to Monsieur Octave de Camps, the latter having\r\nexpressed a great desire to know him. The deputy had not talked\r\nten minutes with the iron-master before he reached his heart by the\r\nmagnitude of the metallurgical knowledge his conversation indicated.\r\n\r\nDuring the year in which he had been preparing for a parliamentary life,\r\nSallenauve had busied himself by acquiring the practical knowledge which\r\nenables an orator of the Chamber to take part in all discussions and\r\nhave reasons to give for his general views. He had turned his attention\r\nmore especially to matters connected with the great question of the\r\nrevenue and taxation; such, for instance, as the custom-house, laws of\r\nexchange, stamp duties, and taxation, direct and indirect. Approaching\r\nin this manner that problematical science--which is, nevertheless, so\r\nsure of itself!--called political economy, Sallenauve had also studied\r\nthe sources which contribute to form the great current of national\r\nprosperity; and in this connection the subject of mines, the topic\r\nat this moment most interesting to Monsieur de Camps, had not been\r\nneglected by him. We can imagine the admiration of the iron-master, who\r\nhad studied too exclusively the subject of iron ore to know much about\r\nthe other branches of metallurgy, when the young deputy told him,\r\napropos of the wealth of our soil, a sort of Arabian Nights tale, which,\r\nif science would only take hold of it, might become a reality.\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, do you really believe,” cried Monsieur de Camps, “that,\r\nbesides our coal and iron mines, we possess mines of copper, lead, and,\r\npossibly, silver?”\r\n\r\n“If you will take the trouble to consult certain specialists,” replied\r\nSallenauve, “you will find that neither the boasted strata of Bohemia\r\nand Saxony nor even those of Russia and Hungary can be compared to those\r\nhidden in the Pyrenees, in the Alps from Briancon to the Isere, in\r\nthe Cevennes on the Lozere side, in the Puy-de-Dome, Bretagne, and the\r\nVosges. In the Vosges, more especially about the town of Saint-Die, I\r\ncan point out to you a single vein of the mineral of silver which\r\nlies to the depth of fifty to eighty metres with a length of thirteen\r\nkilometres.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, why has such untold metallurgical wealth never been\r\nworked?”\r\n\r\n“It has been, in former days,” replied Sallenauve, “especially during\r\nthe Roman occupation of Gaul. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the\r\nwork was abandoned; but the lords of the soil and the clergy renewed it\r\nin the middle ages; after that, during the struggle of feudality against\r\nthe royal power and the long civil wars which devastated France, the\r\nwork was again suspended, and has never since been taken up.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of what you say?”\r\n\r\n“Ancient authors, Strabo and others, all mention these mines, and the\r\ntradition of their existence still lingers in the regions where they are\r\nsituated; decrees of emperors and the ordinances of certain of our kings\r\nbear testimony to the value of their products; in certain places more\r\nmaterial proof may be found in excavations of considerable depth and\r\nlength, in galleries and halls cut in the solid rock,--in short, in the\r\nmany traces still existing of those vast works which have immortalized\r\nRoman industry. To this must be added that the modern study of\r\ngeological science has confirmed and developed these irrefutable\r\nindications.”\r\n\r\nThe imagination of Monsieur Octave de Camps, hitherto limited to the\r\ndevelopment of a single iron-mine, took fire, and he was about to\r\nask his instructor to give him his ideas on the manner of awakening a\r\npractical interest in the matter, when Lucas, throwing wide open the\r\ndouble doors of the salon, announced in his loudest and most pompous\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur the minister of Public Works.”\r\n\r\nThe effect produced on the elders of the assembly was electric.\r\n\r\n“I want to see what sort of figure that little Rastignac cuts as a\r\nstatesman,” said Monsieur de Camps, rising from his seat; but in his\r\nheart he was thinking of the government subsidy he wanted for his\r\niron-mine. The new deputy, on his side, foresaw an inevitable meeting\r\nwith the minister, and wondered what his friends in the Opposition would\r\nsay when they read in the “National” that a representative of the Left\r\nwas seen to have an interview with a minister celebrated for his art in\r\nconverting political opponents. Anxious also to return to Marie-Gaston,\r\nhe resolved to profit by the general stir created by the minister’s\r\narrival to slip away; and by a masterly manoeuvre he made his way slyly\r\nto the door of the salon, expecting to escape without being seen. But\r\nhe reckoned without Nais, to whom he was engaged for a quadrille. That\r\nsmall girl sounded the alarm at the moment when he laid his hand on the\r\nhandle of the door; and Monsieur de l’Estorade, mindful of his promise\r\nto Rastignac, hastened to put a stop to the desertion. Finding his quiet\r\nretreat impossible, Sallenauve was afraid that an open departure after\r\nthe arrival of the minister might be construed as an act of puritanical\r\nopposition in the worst taste; he therefore accepted the situation\r\npromptly, and decided to remain.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade knew that Sallenauve was far too wise to be the\r\ndupe of any artifices he might have used to bring about his introduction\r\nto the minister. He therefore went straight to the point, and soon after\r\nRastignac’s arrival he slipped his arm through that of the statesman,\r\nand, approaching the deputy, said to him,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur the minister of Public Works, who, on the eve of the battle,\r\nwishes me to introduce him to a general of the enemy’s army.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le ministre does me too much honor,” replied Sallenauve,\r\nceremoniously. “Far from being a general, I am a private soldier, and a\r\nvery unknown one.”\r\n\r\n“Hum!” said the minister; “it seems to me that the battle at\r\nArcis-sur-Aube was not an insignificant victory; you routed our ranks,\r\nmonsieur, in a singular manner.”\r\n\r\n“There was nothing wonderful in that; you must have heard that a saint\r\nfought for us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, at any rate,” said Rastignac, “I prefer this result to the one\r\narranged for us by a man I thought cleverer than he proved to be, whom\r\nI sent down there. It seems that Beauvisage is a perfect nonentity;\r\nhe’d have rubbed off upon us; and after all, he was really as much Left\r\ncentre as the other man, Giguet. Now the Left centre is our real enemy,\r\nbecause it is aiming to get our portfolios.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, “after what we heard of the man, I\r\nthink he would have done exactly what was wanted of him.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend, don’t believe that,” said the minister. “Fools are\r\noften more tenacious of the flag under which they enlisted than we think\r\nfor. Besides, to go over to the enemy is to make a choice, and that\r\nsupposes an operation of the mind; it is much easier to be obstinate.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with the minister,” said Sallenauve; “extreme innocence\r\nand extreme rascality are equally able to defend themselves against\r\nseduction.”\r\n\r\nHere Monsieur de l’Estorade, seeing, or pretending to see, a signal made\r\nto him, looked over his shoulder and said,--\r\n\r\n“I’m coming.”\r\n\r\nAnd the two adversaries being thus buckled together, he hastened away as\r\nif summoned to some duty as master of the house.\r\n\r\nSallenauve was anxious not to seem disturbed at finding himself alone\r\nwith the minister. The meeting having come about, he decided to endure\r\nit with a good grace, and, taking the first word, he asked if the\r\nministry had prepared, in view of the coming sessions, a large number of\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n“No, very few,” replied Rastignac. “To tell the truth, we do not expect\r\nto be in power very long; we brought about an election because in the\r\ngeneral confusion into which the press has thrown public opinion, our\r\nconstitutional duty was to force that opinion to reconstitute itself;\r\nbut the fact is, we did not expect the result to be favorable to us, and\r\nwe are therefore taken somewhat unawares.”\r\n\r\n“You are like the peasant,” said Sallenauve, laughing, “who, expecting\r\nthe end of the world, did not sow his wheat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we don’t look upon our retirement as the end of the world,” said\r\nRastignac, modestly; “there are men to come after us, and many of\r\nthem well able to govern; only, as we expected to give but few more\r\nrepresentations in that transitory abode called ‘power,’ we have\r\nnot unpacked either our costumes or our scenery. Besides, the coming\r\nsession, in any case, can only be a business session. The question now\r\nis, of course, between the palace, that is, personal influence, and the\r\ndoctrine of parliamentary supremacy. This question will naturally come\r\nup when the vote is taken on the secret-service fund. Whenever, in one\r\nway or the other, that is settled, and the budget is voted, together\r\nwith a few bills of secondary interest, Parliament has really completed\r\nits task; it will have put an end to a distressing struggle, and the\r\ncountry will know to which of the two parties it can look for the\r\ndevelopment of its prosperity.”\r\n\r\n“And you think,” said Sallenauve, “that in a well-balanced system of\r\ngovernment that question is a useful one to raise?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Rastignac, “we have not raised it. It is born perhaps\r\nof circumstances; a great deal, as I think, from the restlessness of\r\ncertain ambitions, and also from the tactics of parties.”\r\n\r\n“So that, in your opinion, one of the combatants is not guilty and has\r\nabsolutely nothing to reproach himself with?”\r\n\r\n“You are a republican,” said Rastignac, “and therefore, _a priori_, an\r\nenemy to the dynasty. I think I should lose my time in trying to change\r\nyour ideas on the policy you complain of.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken,” said the theoretical republican deputy; “I have no\r\npreconceived hatred to the reigning dynasty. I even think that in\r\nits past, _striped_, if I may say so, with royal affinities and\r\nrevolutionary memories, it has all that is needed to respond to the\r\nliberal and monarchical instincts of the nation. But you will find it\r\ndifficult to persuade me that in the present head of the dynasty we\r\nshall not find extreme ideas of personal influence, which in the long\r\nrun will undermine and subvert the finest as well as the strongest\r\ninstitutions.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Rastignac, ironically, “and they are saved by the famous\r\naxiom of the deputy of Sancerre: ‘The king reigns, but does not\r\ngovern.’”\r\n\r\nWhether he was tired of standing to converse, or whether he wished to\r\nprove his ease in releasing himself from the trap which had evidently\r\nbeen laid for him, Sallenauve, before replying, drew up a chair for his\r\ninterlocutor, and, taking one himself, said,--\r\n\r\n“Will you permit me to cite the example of another royal behavior?--that\r\nof a prince who was not considered indifferent to his royal prerogative,\r\nand who was not ignorant of constitutional mechanism--”\r\n\r\n“Louis XVIII.,” said Rastignac, “or, as the newspapers used to call him,\r\n‘the illustrious author of the Charter’?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; and will you kindly tell me where he died?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu_! at the Tuileries.”\r\n\r\n“And his successor?”\r\n\r\n“In exile--Oh! I see what you are coming to.”\r\n\r\n“My conclusion is certainly not difficult to guess. But have you fully\r\nremarked the deduction to be drawn from that royal career?--for which I\r\nmyself feel the greatest respect. Louis XVIII. was not a citizen king.\r\nHe granted this Charter, but he never consented to it. Born nearer to\r\nthe throne than the prince whose regrettable tendencies I mentioned\r\njust now, he might naturally share more deeply still the ideas,\r\nthe prejudices, and the infatuations of the court; in person he was\r\nridiculous (a serious princely defect in France); he bore the brunt of a\r\nnew and untried regime; he succeeded a government which had intoxicated\r\nthe people with that splendid gilded smoke called glory; and if he was\r\nnot actually brought back to France by foreigners, at any rate he came\r\nas the result of the armed invasion of Europe. Now, shall I tell you\r\nwhy, in spite of all these defects and disadvantages, in spite, too, of\r\nthe ceaseless conspiracy kept up against his government, it was given to\r\nhim to die tranquilly in his bed at the Tuileries?”\r\n\r\n“Because he had made himself a constitutional king,” said Rastignac,\r\nwith a slight shrug of his shoulders. “But do you mean to say that we\r\nare not that?”\r\n\r\n“In the letter, yes; in the spirit, no. When Louis XVIII. gave his\r\nconfidence to a minister, he gave it sincerely and wholly. He did\r\nnot cheat him; he played honestly into his hand,--witness the famous\r\nordinance of September 5, and the dissolution of the Chamber, which was\r\nmore Royalist than himself,--a thing he had the wisdom not to desire.\r\nLater, a movement of public opinion shook the minister who had led him\r\nalong that path; that minister was his favorite, his son, as he called\r\nhim. No matter; yielding to the constitutional necessity, he bravely\r\nsent him to foreign parts, after loading him with crosses and\r\ntitles,--in short, with everything that could soften the pain of his\r\nfall; and he did not watch and manoeuvre surreptitiously to bring him\r\nback to power, which that minister never regained.”\r\n\r\n“For a man who declares he does not hate us,” said Rastignac, “you\r\ntreat us rather roughly. According to you we are almost faithless to the\r\nconstitutional compact, and our policy, to your thinking ambiguous and\r\ntortuous, gives us a certain distant likeness to Monsieur Doublemain in\r\nthe ‘Mariage de Figaro.’”\r\n\r\n“I do not say that the evil is as deep as that,” replied Sallenauve;\r\n“perhaps, after all, _we_ are simply a _faiseur_,--using the word, be it\r\nunderstood, in the sense of a meddler, one who wants to have his finger\r\nin everything.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur, but suppose we are the ablest politician in the country.”\r\n\r\n“If we are, it does not follow that our kingdom ought not to have the\r\nchance of becoming as able as ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu_!” cried Rastignac, in the tone of a man who comes to the\r\nclimax of a conversation, “I wish I had power to realize a wish--”\r\n\r\n“And that is?”\r\n\r\n“To see you grappling with that ability which you call meddlesome.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, Monsieur le ministre, that we all spend three fourths\r\nof life in wishing for the impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Why impossible? Would you be the first man of the Opposition to be seen\r\nat the Tuileries? An invitation to dinner given publicly, openly, which\r\nwould, by bringing you into contact with one whom you misjudge at a\r\ndistance--”\r\n\r\n“I should have the honor to refuse.”\r\n\r\nAnd he emphasized the words _have the honor_ in a way to show the\r\nmeaning he attached to them.\r\n\r\n“You are all alike, you men of the Opposition!” cried the minister;\r\n“you won’t let yourselves be enlightened when the opportunity presents\r\nitself; or, to put it better, you--”\r\n\r\n“Do you call the rays of those gigantic red bottles in a chemist’s shop\r\n_light_, when they flash into your eyes as you pass them after dark?\r\nDon’t they, on the contrary, seem to blind you?”\r\n\r\n“It is not our rays that frighten you,” said Rastignac; “it is the dark\r\nlantern of your party watchmen on their rounds.”\r\n\r\n“There may be some truth in what you say; a party and the man who\r\nundertakes to represent it are in some degree a married couple, who in\r\norder to live peaceably together must be mutually courteous, frank, and\r\nfaithful in heart as well as in principle.”\r\n\r\n“Well, try to be moderate. Your dream is far more impossible to realize\r\nthan mine; the day will come when you will have more to say about the\r\ncourtesy of your chaste better half.”\r\n\r\n“If there is an evil for which I ought to be prepared, it is that.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so? With the lofty and generous sentiments so apparent in\r\nyour nature, shall you remain impassive under political attack,--under\r\ncalumny, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“You yourself, Monsieur le ministre, have not escaped its venom; but it\r\ndid not, I think, deter you from your course.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Rastignac, lowering his voice, “suppose I were to tell you\r\nthat I have already sternly refused to listen to a proposal to search\r\ninto your private life on a certain side which, being more in the shade\r\nthan the rest, seems to offer your enemies a chance to entrap you.”\r\n\r\n“I do not thank you for the honor you have done yourself in rejecting\r\nwith contempt the proposals of men who can be neither of my party nor of\r\nyours; they belong to the party of base appetites and selfish passions.\r\nBut, supposing the impossible, had they found some acceptance from\r\nyou, pray believe that my course, which follows the dictates of my\r\nconscience, could not be affected thereby.”\r\n\r\n“But your party,--consider for a moment its elements: a jumble of\r\nfoiled ambitions, brutal greed, plagiarists of ‘93, despots disguising\r\nthemselves as lovers of liberty.”\r\n\r\n“My party has nothing, and seeks to gain something. Yours calls itself\r\nconservative, and it is right; its chief concern is how to preserve its\r\npower, offices, and wealth,--in short, all it now monopolizes.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, we are not a closed way; we open our way, on the\r\ncontrary, to all ambitions. But the higher you are in character and\r\nintellect, the less we can allow you to pass, dragging after you your\r\ntrain of democrats; for the day when that crew gains the upper hand it\r\nwill not be a change of policy, but a revolution.”\r\n\r\n“But what makes you think I want an opening of any kind?”\r\n\r\n“What! follow a course without an aim?--a course that leads nowhere? A\r\ncertain development of a man’s faculties not only gives him the right\r\nbut makes it his duty to seek to govern.”\r\n\r\n“To watch the governing power is a useful career, and, I may add, a very\r\nbusy one.”\r\n\r\n“You can fancy, monsieur,” said Rastignac, good-humoredly, “that if\r\nBeauvisage were in your place I should not have taken the trouble to\r\nargue with him; I may say, however, that he would have made my effort\r\nless difficult.”\r\n\r\n“This meeting, which _chance_ has brought about between us,” said\r\nSallenauve, “will have one beneficial result; we understand each\r\nother henceforth, and our future meetings will always therefore be\r\ncourteous--which will not lessen the strength of our convictions.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must say to the king--for I had his royal commands to--”\r\n\r\nRastignac did not end the sentence in which he was, so to speak, firing\r\nhis last gun, for the orchestra began to play a quadrille, and Nais,\r\nrunning up, made him a coquettish courtesy, saying,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le ministre, I am very sorry, but you have taken my partner,\r\nand you must give him up. He is down for my eleventh quadrille, and if I\r\nmiss it my list gets into terrible confusion.”\r\n\r\n“You permit me, monsieur?” said Sallenauve, laughing. “As you see, I am\r\nnot a very savage republican.” So saying, he followed Nais, who led him\r\nalong by the hand.\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade, comprehending that this fancy of Nais was rather\r\ncompromising to the dignity of the new deputy, had arranged that several\r\npapas and mammas should figure in the same quadrille; and she herself\r\nwith the Scottish lad danced _vis-a-vis_ to her daughter, who beamed\r\nwith pride and joy. In the evolutions of the last figure, where Nais had\r\nto take her mother’s hand, she said, pressing it passionately,--\r\n\r\n“Poor mamma! if it hadn’t been for _him_, you wouldn’t have me now.”\r\n\r\nThis sudden reminder so agitated Madame de l’Estorade, coming as it did\r\nunexpectedly, that she was seized with a return of the nervous trembling\r\nher daughter’s danger had originally caused, and was forced to sit down.\r\nSeeing her change color, Sallenauve, Nais, and Madame Octave de Camps\r\nran to her to know if she were ill.\r\n\r\n“It is nothing,” she answered, addressing Sallenauve; “only that my\r\nlittle girl reminded me suddenly of the utmost obligation we are under\r\nto you, monsieur. ‘Without _him_,’ she said, ‘you would not have me.’\r\nAh! monsieur, without your generous courage where would my child be\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, don’t excite yourself,” interposed Madame Octave de Camps,\r\nobserving the convulsive and almost gasping tone of her friend’s voice.\r\n“It is not reasonable to put yourself in such a state for a child’s\r\nspeech.”\r\n\r\n“She is better than the rest of us,” replied Madame de l’Estorade,\r\ntaking Nais in her arms.\r\n\r\n“Come, mamma, be reasonable,” said that young lady.\r\n\r\n“She puts nothing in the world,” continued Madame de l’Estorade, “before\r\nher gratitude to her preserver, whereas her father and I have scarcely\r\nshown him any.”\r\n\r\n“But, madame,” said Sallenauve, “you have courteously--”\r\n\r\n“Courteously!” interrupted Nais, shaking her pretty head with an air of\r\ndisapproval; “if any one had saved my daughter, I should be different to\r\nhim from that.”\r\n\r\n“Nais,” said Madame de Camps, sternly, “children should be silent when\r\ntheir opinion is not asked.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, joining the group.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Madame de Camps; “only a giddiness Renee had in\r\ndancing.”\r\n\r\n“Is it over?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am quite well again,” said Madame de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“Then come and say good-night to Madame de Rastignac, who is preparing\r\nto take leave.”\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to get to the minister’s wife, he forgot to give\r\nhis own wife his arm. Sallenauve was more thoughtful. As they walked\r\ntogether in the wake of her husband, Madame de l’Estorade said,--\r\n\r\n“I saw you talking for a long time with Monsieur de Rastignac; did he\r\npractise his well-known seductions upon you?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he succeeded?” replied Sallenauve.\r\n\r\n“No; but such attempts to capture are always disagreeable, and I beg\r\nyou to believe that I was not a party to the plot. I am not so violently\r\nministerial as my husband.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I as violently revolutionary as they think.”\r\n\r\n“I trust that these annoying politics, which have already produced a\r\njar between you and Monsieur de l’Estorade, may not disgust you with the\r\nidea of being counted among our friends.”\r\n\r\n“That is an honor, madame, for which I can only be grateful.”\r\n\r\n“It is not an honor but a pleasure that I hoped you would find in it,”\r\n said Madame de l’Estorade, quickly. “I say, with Nais, if I had saved\r\nthe life of a friend’s child, I should cease to be ceremonious with\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, and without listening to his answer, she disengaged her arm\r\nquickly from that of Sallenauve, and left him rather astonished at the\r\ntone in which she had spoken.\r\n\r\nIn seeing Madame de l’Estorade so completely docile to the advice, more\r\nclever than prudent, perhaps, of Madame de Camps, the reader, we think,\r\ncan scarcely be surprised. A certain attraction has been evident for\r\nsome time on the part of the frigid countess not only to the preserver\r\nof her daughter, but to the man who under such romantic and singular\r\ncircumstances had come before her mind. Carefully considered, Madame de\r\nl’Estorade is seen to be far from one of those impassible natures which\r\nresist all affectionate emotions except those of the family. With a\r\nbeauty that was partly Spanish, she had eyes which her friend Louise\r\nde Chaulieu declared could ripen peaches. Her coldness was not what\r\nphysicians call congenital; her temperament was an acquired one.\r\nMarrying from _reason_ a man whose mental insufficiency is very\r\napparent, she made herself love him out of pity and a sense of\r\nprotection. Up to the present time, by means of a certain atrophy of\r\nheart, she had succeeded, without one failure, in making Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade perfectly happy. With the same instinct, she had exaggerated\r\nthe maternal sentiment to an almost inconceivable degree, until in that\r\nway she had fairly stifled all the other cravings of her nature. It must\r\nbe said, however, that the success she had had in accomplishing this\r\nhard task was due in a great measure to _the circumstance_ of Louise de\r\nChaulieu. To her that dear mistaken one was like the drunken slave whom\r\nthe Spartans made a living lesson to their children; and between the two\r\nfriends a sort of tacit wager was established. Louise having taken the\r\nside of romantic passion, Renee held firmly to that of superior reason;\r\nand in order to win the game, she had maintained a courage of good sense\r\nand wisdom which might have cost her far more to practise without this\r\nincentive. At the age she had now reached, and with her long habit\r\nof self-control, we can understand how, seeing, as she believed, the\r\napproach of a love against which she had preached so vehemently, she\r\nshould instantly set to work to rebuff it; but a man who did not feel\r\nthat love, while thinking her ideally beautiful, and who possibly\r\nloved elsewhere,--a man who had saved her child from death and asked\r\nno recompense, who was grave, serious, and preoccupied in an absorbing\r\nenterprise,--why should she still continue to think such a man\r\ndangerous? Why not grant to him, without further hesitation, the\r\nlukewarm sentiment of friendship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. CURIOSITY THAT CAME WITHIN AN ACE OF BEING FATAL\r\n\r\nOn returning to Ville d’Avray, Sallenauve was confronted by a singular\r\nevent. Who does not know how sudden events upset the whole course of our\r\nlives, and place us, without our will, in compromising positions?\r\n\r\nSallenauve was not mistaken in feeling serious anxiety as to the mental\r\nstate of his friend Marie-Gaston.\r\n\r\nWhen that unfortunate man had left the scene of his cruel loss\r\nimmediately after the death of his wife, he would have done a wiser\r\nthing had he then resolved never to revisit it. Nature, providentially\r\nordered, provides that if those whose nearest and dearest are struck by\r\nthe hand of death accept the decree with the resignation which ought to\r\nfollow the execution of all necessary law, they will not remain too long\r\nunder the influence of their grief. Rousseau has said, in his famous\r\nletter against suicide: “Sadness, weariness of spirit, regret, despair\r\nare not lasting sorrows, rooted forever in the soul; experience will\r\nalways cast out that feeling of bitterness which makes us at first\r\nbelieve our grief eternal.”\r\n\r\nBut this truth ceases to be true for imprudent and wilful persons, who\r\nseek to escape the first anguish of sorrow by flight or some violent\r\ndistraction. All mental and moral suffering is a species of illness\r\nwhich, taking time for its specific, will gradually wear out, in the\r\nlong run, of itself. If, on the contrary, it is not allowed to consume\r\nitself slowly on the scene of its trouble, if it is fanned into flame by\r\nmotion or violent remedies, we hinder the action of nature; we deprive\r\nourselves of the blessed relief of comparative forgetfulness, promised\r\nto those who will accept their suffering, and so transform it into a\r\nchronic affection, the memories of which, though hidden, are none the\r\nless true and deep.\r\n\r\nIf we violently oppose this salutary process, we produce an acute evil,\r\nin which the imagination acts upon the heart; and as the latter from\r\nits nature is limited, while the former is infinite, it is impossible\r\nto calculate the violence of the impressions to which a man may yield\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhen Marie-Gaston returned to the house at Ville d’Avray, after two\r\nyears’ absence, he fancied that only a tender if melancholy memory\r\nawaited him; but not a step could he make without recalling his lost\r\njoys and the agony of losing them. The flowers that his wife had loved,\r\nthe lawns, the trees just budding into greenness under the warm breath\r\nof May,--they were here before his eyes; but she who had created this\r\nbeauteous nature was lying cold in the earth. Amid all the charms and\r\nelegances gathered to adorn this nest of their love, there was nothing\r\nfor the man who rashly returned to that dangerous atmosphere but sounds\r\nof lamentation, the moans of a renewed and now ever-living grief.\r\nAlarmed himself at the vertigo of sorrow which seized him, Marie-Gaston\r\nshrank, as Sallenauve had said, from taking the last step in his ordeal;\r\nhe had calmly discussed with his friend the details of the mausoleum he\r\nwished to raise above the mortal remains of his beloved Louise, but he\r\nhad not yet brought himself to visit her grave in the village cemetery\r\nwhere he had laid them. There was everything, therefore, to fear from\r\na grief which time had not only not assuaged, but, on the contrary, had\r\nincreased by duration, until it was sharper and more intolerable than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe gates were opened by Philippe, the old servant, who had been\r\nconstituted by Madame Gaston majordomo of the establishment.\r\n\r\n“How is your master?” asked Sallenauve.\r\n\r\n“He has gone away, monsieur,” replied Philippe.\r\n\r\n“Gone away!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur; with that English gentleman whom monsieur left here with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“But without a word to me! Do you know where they have gone?”\r\n\r\n“After dinner, which went off very well, monsieur suddenly gave orders\r\nto pack his travelling-trunk; he did part of it himself. During that\r\ntime the Englishman, who said he would go into the park and smoke, asked\r\nme privately where he could go to write a letter without monsieur seeing\r\nhim. I took him to my room; but I did not dare question him about\r\nthis journey, for I never saw any one with such forbidding and\r\nuncommunicative manners. By the time the letter was written monsieur\r\nwas ready, and without giving me any explanation they both got into\r\nthe Englishman’s carriage, and I heard one of them say to the coachman,\r\n‘Paris.’”\r\n\r\n“What became of the letter?” asked Sallenauve.\r\n\r\n“It is there in my room, where the Englishman gave it me secretly. It is\r\naddressed to monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Fetch it at once, my dear man,” cried Sallenauve.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the letter, his face seemed to Philippe convulsed.\r\n\r\n“Tell them not to unharness,” he said; and he read the letter through a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nWhen the old servant returned after executing the order, Sallenauve\r\nasked him at what hour they had started.\r\n\r\n“About nine,” answered Philippe.\r\n\r\n“Three hours in advance!” muttered the deputy, looking at his watch, and\r\nreturning to the carriage which had brought him. As he was getting into\r\nit, the old majordomo forced himself to say,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur found no bad news in that letter, did he?”\r\n\r\n“No; but your master may be absent for some time; keep the house in good\r\norder.” Then he said to the coachman, “Paris!”\r\n\r\nThe next day, quite early in the morning, Monsieur de l’Estorade was in\r\nhis study, employed in a rather singular manner. It will be remembered\r\nthat on the day when Sallenauve, then Dorlange the sculptor, had sent\r\nhim the bust of Madame de l’Estorade, he had not found a place where, as\r\nhe thought, the little masterpiece had a proper light. From the moment\r\nthat Rastignac hinted to him that his intercourse with the sculptor,\r\nnow deputy, might injure him at court, he had agreed with his son Armand\r\nthat the artist had given to Madame de l’Estorade the air of a grisette;\r\nbut now that Sallenauve, by his resistance to ministerial blandishments,\r\nhad taken an openly hostile attitude to the government, that bust seemed\r\nto the peer of France no longer worthy of exhibition, and the worthy man\r\nwas now engaged in finding some dark corner where, without recourse to\r\nthe absurdity of actually hiding it, it would be out of range to the\r\neyes of visitors, whose questions as to its maker he should no longer\r\nbe forced to answer. He was therefore perched on the highest step of\r\nhis library ladder, holding in his hands the gift of the sculptor, and\r\npreparing to relegate it to the top of a bookcase, where it was destined\r\nto keep company with an owl and a cormorant shot by Armand during the\r\nrecent holidays and stuffed by paternal pride, when the door of the\r\nstudy opened and Lucas announced,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Philippe.”\r\n\r\nThe age of the old majordomo and the confidential post he occupied in\r\nMarie-Gaston’s establishment seemed to the factotum of the house of\r\nl’Estorade to authorize the designation of “monsieur,”--a civility\r\nexpectant of return, be it understood.\r\n\r\nDescending from his eminence, the peer of France asked Philippe what\r\nbrought him, and whether anything had happened at Ville d’Avray. The old\r\nservant related the singular departure of his master, and the no less\r\nsingular departure of Sallenauve without a word of explanation; then he\r\nadded,--\r\n\r\n“This morning, while putting monsieur’s room in order, a letter\r\naddressed to Madame le comtesse fell out of a book. As the letter was\r\nsealed and all ready to be sent, I supposed that monsieur, in the hurry\r\nof departure, had forgotten to tell me to put it in the post. I thought\r\ntherefore I had better bring it here myself. Perhaps Madame la comtesse\r\nwill find in it some explanation of this sudden journey, about which I\r\nhave dreamed all night.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade took the letter.\r\n\r\n“Three black seals!” he said.\r\n\r\n“The color doesn’t surprise me,” replied Philippe; “for since Madame’s\r\ndeath monsieur has not laid off his mourning; but I do think three seals\r\nare rather strange.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade; “I will give the letter to my\r\nwife.”\r\n\r\n“If there should be anything in it to ease my mind about monsieur, would\r\nMonsieur le comte be so kind as to let me know?” said Philippe.\r\n\r\n“You can rely on that, my good fellow. _Au revoir_.”\r\n\r\n“I beg Monsieur le comte’s pardon for offering an opinion,” said the\r\nmajordomo, not accepting the leave just given him to depart; “but in\r\ncase the letter contained some bad news, doesn’t Monsieur le comte think\r\nthat it would be best for him to know of it, in order to prepare Madame\r\nla comtesse for the shock?”\r\n\r\n“What! Do you suppose--” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, not finishing his\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; but monsieur has been very gloomy the last few days.”\r\n\r\n“To break the seal of a letter not addressed to us is always a serious\r\nthing to do,” remarked the peer of France. “This bears my wife’s\r\naddress, but--in point of fact--it was never sent to her; in short, it\r\nis most embarrassing.”\r\n\r\n“But if by reading it some misfortune might be averted?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; that is just what keeps me in doubt.”\r\n\r\nHere Madame de l’Estorade cut the matter short by entering the room.\r\nLucas had told her of the unexpected arrival of Philippe.\r\n\r\n“Is anything the matter?” she asked with anxious curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions Sallenauve had expressed the night before as to\r\nMarie-Gaston’s condition returned to her mind. As soon as Philippe had\r\nrepeated the explanations he had already given to her husband, she broke\r\nthe seals of the letter.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the contents of that disquieting epistle, nothing\r\nwas reflected on Madame de l’Estorade’s face.\r\n\r\n“You say that your master left Ville d’Avray in company with an English\r\ngentleman,” she said to Philippe. “Did he seem to go unwillingly, as if\r\nyielding to violence?”\r\n\r\n“No, far from that, madame; he seemed to be rather cheerful.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is nothing that need make us uneasy. This letter was\r\nwritten some days ago, and, in spite of its three black seals, it has no\r\nreference to anything that has happened since.”\r\n\r\nPhilippe bowed and went away. As soon as husband and wife were alone\r\ntogether, Monsieur de l’Estorade said, stretching out his hand for the\r\nletter,--\r\n\r\n“What did he write about?”\r\n\r\n“No, don’t read it,” said the countess, not giving him the letter.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It would pain you. It is enough for me to have had the shock; I could\r\nscarcely control myself before that old servant.”\r\n\r\n“Does it refer to suicide?”\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade nodded her head in affirmation.\r\n\r\n“A real, immediate intention?”\r\n\r\n“The letter is dated yesterday morning; and apparently, if it had not\r\nbeen for the providential arrival of that Englishman, the poor fellow\r\nwould have taken advantage of Monsieur de Sallenauve’s absence last\r\nnight to kill himself.”\r\n\r\n“The Englishman must have suspected his intention, and carried him\r\noff to divert him from it. If that is so, he won’t let him out of his\r\nsight.”\r\n\r\n“And we may also count on Monsieur Sallenauve, who has probably joined\r\nthem by this time.”\r\n\r\n“Then I don’t see that there is anything so terrible in the letter”; and\r\nagain he offered to take it.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Madame de l’Estorade, drawing back, “if I ask you not to read\r\nit. Why give yourself painful emotions? The letter not only expresses\r\nthe intention of suicide, but it shows that our poor friend is\r\ncompletely out of his mind.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant piercing screams from Rene, her youngest child, put\r\nMadame de l’Estorade into one of those material agitations which she\r\nless than any other woman was able to control.\r\n\r\n“My God!” she cried, as she rushed from the study, “what has happened?”\r\n\r\nLess ready to be alarmed, Monsieur de l’Estorade contented himself by\r\ngoing to the door and asking a servant what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing, Monsieur le comte,” replied the man. “Monsieur Rene in\r\nshutting a drawer pinched his finger; that is all.”\r\n\r\nThe peer of France thought it unnecessary to convey himself to the scene\r\nof action; he knew, by experience in like cases, that he must let his\r\nwife’s exaggerated maternal solicitude have free course, on pain of\r\nbeing sharply snubbed himself. As he returned to his desk, he noticed\r\nlying on the ground the famous letter, which Madame de l’Estorade\r\nhad evidently dropped in her hasty flight. Opportunity and a certain\r\nfatality which appears to preside over the conduct of all human affairs,\r\nimpelled Monsieur de l’Estorade, who thought little of the shock his\r\nwife had dreaded for him, to satisfy his curiosity by reading the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nMarie-Gaston wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Madame,--This letter will seem to you less amusing than those I\r\n  addressed to you from Arcis-sur-Aube. But I trust you will not be\r\n  alarmed by the decision which I now announce. I am going to rejoin\r\n  my wife, from whom I have been too long separated; and this\r\n  evening, shortly after midnight, I shall be with her, never to\r\n  part again.\r\n\r\n  You have, no doubt, said to yourselves--you and Sallenauve--that I\r\n  was acting strangely in not visiting her grave; that is a remark\r\n  that two of my servants made the other day, not being aware that I\r\n  overheard them. I should certainly be a great fool to go and look\r\n  at a stone in the cemetery which can make me no response, when\r\n  every night, at twelve o’clock, I hear a little rap on the door of\r\n  my room, and our dear Louise comes in, not changed at all, except,\r\n  as I think, more plump and beautiful. She has had great trouble in\r\n  obtaining permission from Marie, queen of angels, to withdraw me\r\n  from earth. But last night she brought me formal leave, sealed\r\n  with green wax; and she also gave me a tiny vial of hydrocyanic\r\n  acid. A single drop of that acid puts us to sleep, and on waking\r\n  up we find ourselves on the other side.\r\n\r\n  Louise desired me to give you a message from her. I am to tell you\r\n  that Monsieur de l’Estorade has a disease of the liver and will\r\n  not live long, and that after his death you are to marry\r\n  Sallenauve, because, on the _other side_, husbands and wives who\r\n  really love each other are reunited; and she thinks we shall all\r\n  four--she and I and you and Sallenauve--be much happier together\r\n  than if we had your present husband, who is very dull, and whom\r\n  you married reluctantly.\r\n\r\n  My message given, nothing remains for me, madame, but to wish you\r\n  all the patience you need to continue for your allotted time in\r\n  this low world, and to subscribe myself\r\nYour very affectionately devoted\r\n\r\nMarie-Gaston.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, after reading this letter, it had occurred to Monsieur de l’Estorade\r\nto look at himself in the glass, he would have seen, in the sudden\r\nconvulsion and discoloration of his face, the outward and visible signs\r\nof the terrible blow which his unfortunate curiosity had brought down\r\nupon him. His heart, his mind, his self-respect staggered under one and\r\nthe same shock; the madness evident in the sort of prediction made about\r\nhim only added to his sense of its horror. Presently convincing himself,\r\nlike a mussulman, that madmen have the gift of second sight, he believed\r\nhe was a lost man, and instantly a stabbing pain began on his liver\r\nside, while in the direction of Sallenauve, his predicted successor,\r\nan awful hatred succeeded to his mild good-will. But at the same time,\r\nconscious of the total want of reason and even of the absurdity of the\r\nimpression which had suddenly surged into his mind, he was afraid lest\r\nits existence should be suspected, and he looked about him to see in\r\nwhat way he could conceal from his wife his fatal indiscretion, the\r\nconsequences of which must forever weigh upon his life. It was certain,\r\nhe thought, that if she found the paper in his study she would deduce\r\ntherefrom the fact that he had read it. Rising from his desk, he softly\r\nopened the door leading from the study to the salon, crossed the latter\r\nroom on tiptoe, and dropped the letter at the farther end of it, as\r\nMadame de l’Estorade might suppose she had herself done in her hasty\r\ndeparture. Then returning to his study, he scattered his papers over his\r\ndesk, like a school-boy up to mischief, who wants to mislead his master\r\nby a show of application, intending to appear absorbed in his accounts\r\nwhen his wife returned. Useless to add that he listened with keen\r\nanxiety lest some other person than she should come into the salon; in\r\nwhich case he determined to rush out and prevent other eyes from reading\r\nthe dreadful secrets contained in that paper.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, the voice of Madame de l’Estorade, speaking to some\r\none at the door of the salon, reassured him as to the success of his\r\ntrick, and a moment later she entered the study accompanied by Monsieur\r\nOctave de Camps. Going forward to receive his visitor, he was able\r\nto see through the half-opened door the place where he had thrown the\r\nletter. Not only had it disappeared, but he detected a movement which\r\nassured him that Madame de l’Estorade had tucked it away in that part\r\nof her gown where Louis XIV. did not dare to search for the secrets of\r\nMademoiselle d’Hautefort.\r\n\r\n“I have come, my dear friend,” said Monsieur de Camps, “to get you to go\r\nwith me to Rastignac’s, as agreed on last night.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said the peer, putting away his papers with a feverish\r\nhaste that plainly indicated he was not in his usual state of mind.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you feel well?” asked Madame de l’Estorade, who knew her husband\r\nby heart too well not to be struck by the singular stupefaction of his\r\nmanner, while at the same time, looking in his face, she saw the signs\r\nof internal convulsion.\r\n\r\n“True,” said Monsieur de Camps, “you certainly do not look so well as\r\nusual. If you prefer it, we will put off this visit.”\r\n\r\n“No, not at all,” replied Monsieur de l’Estorade. “I have tired myself\r\nwith this work, and I need the air. But what was the matter with Rene?”\r\n he inquired of his wife, whose attention he felt was unpleasantly fixed\r\nupon him. “What made him cry like that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a mere nothing!” she replied, not relaxing her attention.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear fellow,” said the peer, trying to take an easy tone,\r\n“just let me change my coat and I’ll be with you.”\r\n\r\nWhen the countess was alone with Monsieur de Camps, she said, rather\r\nanxiously,--\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think Monsieur de l’Estorade seems very much upset?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; as I said just now, he does not look like himself. But the\r\nexplanation he gave seems sufficient. This office life is bad for the\r\nhealth. I have never been as well as since I am actively engaged about\r\nmy iron-works.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly,” said Madame de l’Estorade, with a heavy sigh; “he\r\nought to have a more active life. It seems plain that there is something\r\namiss with his liver.”\r\n\r\n“What! because he is so yellow? He has been so ever since I have known\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur, I can’t be mistaken! There is something seriously the\r\nmatter with him; and if you would kindly do me a service--”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I am always at your orders.”\r\n\r\n“When Monsieur de l’Estorade returns, speak of the injury to Rene’s\r\nfinger, and tell me that little wounds like that sometimes have serious\r\nconsequences if not attended to at once, and that will give me an excuse\r\nto send for Doctor Bianchon.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Monsieur de Camps; “but I really don’t think a\r\nphysician is necessary. Still, if it reassures you--”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Monsieur de l’Estorade reappeared. He had almost\r\nrecovered his usual expression of face, but he exhaled a strong odor of\r\n_melisse des Carmes_, which indicated that he had felt the need of that\r\ntonic. Monsieur de Camps played his part admirably, and as for Madame\r\nde l’Estorade it did not cost her much trouble to simulate maternal\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she said to her husband, when Monsieur de Camps had delivered\r\nhimself of his medical opinion, “as you return from Monsieur de\r\nRastignac’s, please call on Doctor Bianchon and ask him to come here.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, shrugging his shoulders, “the idea\r\nof disturbing a busy man like him for what you yourself said was a mere\r\nnothing!”\r\n\r\n“If you won’t go, I shall send Lucas; Monsieur de Camps’ opinion has\r\ncompletely upset me.”\r\n\r\n“If it pleases you to be ridiculous,” said the peer of France, crossly,\r\n“I have no means of preventing it; but I beg you to remark one thing: if\r\npeople disturb physicians for mere nonsense, they often can’t get them\r\nwhen they are really wanted.”\r\n\r\n“Then you won’t go for the doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Not I,” replied Monsieur de l’Estorade; “and if I had the honor of\r\nbeing anything in my own house, I should forbid you to send anybody in\r\nmy place.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, you are the master here, and since you put so much feeling\r\ninto your refusal, let us say no more; I will bear my anxiety as best I\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“Come, de Camps,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade; “for if this goes on, I\r\nshall be sent to order that child’s funeral.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear husband,” said the countess, taking his hand, “you must be\r\nill, to say such dreadful things in that cool way. Where is your usual\r\npatience with my little maternal worries, or your exquisite politeness\r\nfor every one, your wife included?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, getting more excited instead of\r\ncalmer, under this form of studied though friendly reproach, “your\r\nmaternal feelings are turning into monomania, and you make life\r\nintolerable to every one but your children. The devil! suppose they are\r\nyour children; I am their father, and, though I am not adored as\r\nthey are, I have the right to request that my house be not made\r\nuninhabitable!”\r\n\r\nWhile Monsieur de l’Estorade, striding about the room, delivered himself\r\nof this philippic, the countess made a despairing sign to Monsieur de\r\nCamps, as if to ask him whether he did not see most alarming symptoms in\r\nsuch a scene. In order to cut short the quarrel of which he had been the\r\ninvoluntary cause, the latter said, as if hurried,--\r\n\r\n“Come, let us go!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Monsieur de l’Estorade, passing out first and neglecting\r\nto say good-bye to his wife.\r\n\r\n“Ah! stay; I have forgotten a message my wife gave me,” said Monsieur\r\nde Camps, turning back to Madame de l’Estorade. “She told me to say she\r\nwould come for you at two o’clock to go and see the spring things at the\r\n‘Jean de Paris,’ and she has arranged that after that we shall all four\r\ngo to the flower-show. When we leave Rastignac, l’Estorade and I will\r\ncome back here, and wait for you if you have not returned before us.”\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade paid little attention to this programme, for a\r\nflash of light had illumined her mind. As soon as she was alone, she\r\ntook Marie-Gaston’s letter from her gown, and, finding it folded in the\r\nproper manner, she exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Not a doubt of it! I remember perfectly that I folded it with the\r\nwriting outside, as I put it back into the envelope; he must have read\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Madame de l’Estorade and Madame de Camps met in the same\r\nsalon where they had talked of Sallenauve a few days earlier.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! what is the matter with you?” cried Madame de Camps,\r\nseeing tears on the face of her friend, who was finishing a letter she\r\nhad written.\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade told her all that had happened, and showed her\r\nMarie-Gaston’s letter.\r\n\r\n“Are you very sure,” asked Madame de Camps, “that your husband has read\r\nthe luckless scrawl?”\r\n\r\n“How can I doubt it?” returned Madame de l’Estorade. “The paper can’t\r\nhave turned of itself; besides, in recalling the circumstances, I have a\r\ndim recollection that at the moment when I started to run to Rene I felt\r\nsomething drop,--fate willed that I should not stop to pick it up.”\r\n\r\n“Often, when people strain their memories in that way they fasten on\r\nsome false indication.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear friend, the extraordinary change in the face and behavior\r\nof Monsieur de l’Estorade, coming so suddenly as it did, must have\r\nbeen the result of some sudden shock. He looked like a man struck by\r\nlightning.”\r\n\r\n“But if you account for the change in his appearance in that way, why\r\nlook for symptoms of something wrong with his liver?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! this is not the first time I have seen symptoms of that,” replied\r\nMadame de l’Estorade. “But you know when sick people don’t complain, we\r\nforget about their illness. See,” and she pointed to a volume lying open\r\nbeside her; “just before you came in, I found in this medical dictionary\r\nthat persons who suffer from diseases of the liver are apt to be morose,\r\nirritable, impatient. Well, for some time past, I have noticed a great\r\nchange in my husband’s disposition. You yourself mentioned it to me\r\nthe other day. Besides, the scene Monsieur de Camps has just\r\nwitnessed--which is, I may truly say, unprecedented in our household--is\r\nenough to prove it.”\r\n\r\n“My dear love, you are like those unpleasant persons who are resolved\r\nto torture themselves. In the first place, you have looked into medical\r\nbooks, which is the very height of imprudence. I defy you to read a\r\ndescription of any sort of disease without fancying that either you or\r\nsome friends of yours have the symptoms of it. In the next place, you\r\nare mixing up things; the effects of fear and of a chronic malady are\r\ntotally different.”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not mixing them up; I know what I am talking about. You don’t\r\nneed to be told that if in our poor human machine some one part gets out\r\nof order, it is on _that_ that any strong emotion will strike.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Madame de Camps, not pursuing the medical discussion, “if\r\nthe letter of that unhappy madman has really fallen into the hands of\r\nyour husband, the peace of your home is seriously endangered; that is\r\nthe point to be discussed.”\r\n\r\n“There are not two ways to be followed as to that,” said Madame de\r\nl’Estorade. “Monsieur de Sallenauve must never set foot in this house\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“That is precisely what I came to speak about to-day. Do you know that\r\nlast night I did not think you showed the composure which is so marked a\r\ntrait in your character?”\r\n\r\n“When?” asked Madame de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“Why, when you expressed so effusively your gratitude to Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve. When I advised you not to avoid him, for fear it would\r\ninduce him to keep at your heels, I never intended that you should\r\nshower your regard upon his head in a way to turn it. The wife of so\r\nzealous a dynastic partisan as Monsieur de l’Estorade ought to know what\r\nthe _juste milieu_ is by this time.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear, I entreat you, don’t make fun of my poor husband.”\r\n\r\n“I am not talking of your husband, I am talking of you. Last night you\r\nso surprised me that I have come here to take back my words. I like\r\npeople to follow my advice, but I don’t like them to go beyond it.”\r\n\r\n“At any other time I should make you explain what horrible impropriety\r\nI have committed under your counsel; but fate has interposed and settled\r\neverything. Monsieur de Sallenauve will, at any cost, disappear from our\r\npath, and therefore why discuss the degree of kindness one might have\r\nshown him?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Madame de Camps, “since I must tell you all, I have come\r\nto think him a dangerous acquaintance,--less for you than for some one\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Madame de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“Nais. That child, with her passion for her ‘preserver,’ makes me really\r\nuneasy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the countess, smiling rather sadly, “are you not giving too\r\nmuch importance to childish nonsense?”\r\n\r\n“Nais is, of course, a child, but a child who will ripen quickly into a\r\nwoman. Did you not tell me yourself that you were sometimes frightened\r\nat the intuition she showed in matters beyond her years?”\r\n\r\n“That is true. But what you call her passion for Monsieur de Sallenauve,\r\nbesides being perfectly natural, is expressed by the dear little thing\r\nwith such freedom and publicity that the sentiment is, it seems to me,\r\nobviously childlike.”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t trust to that; especially not after this troublesome being\r\nceases to come to your house. Suppose that when the time comes to\r\nmarry your daughter, this fancy should have smouldered in her heart and\r\nincreased; imagine your difficulty!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! between now and then, thank Heaven! there’s time enough,” replied\r\nMadame de l’Estorade, in a tone of incredulity.\r\n\r\n“Between now and then,” said Madame de Camps, “Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\nmay have reached a distinction which will put his name on every lip; and\r\nNais, with her lively imagination, is more likely than other girls to be\r\ndazzled by it.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear love, look at the disproportion in their ages.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Sallenauve is thirty, and Nais will soon be fourteen; that\r\nis precisely the difference between you and Monsieur de l’Estorade.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you may be right,” said Madame de l’Estorade, “and the sort of\r\nmarriage I made from reason Nais may want to make from folly. But you\r\nneedn’t be afraid; I will ruin that idol in her estimation.”\r\n\r\n“But there again, as in the comedy of hatred you mean to play for\r\nMonsieur de l’Estorade’s benefit, you need moderation. If you do not\r\nmanage it by careful transitions, you may miss your end. Never allow\r\nthe influence of circumstances to appear when it is desirable than an\r\nimpulse or an action should seem spontaneous.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Madame de l’Estorade, excitedly, “do you think that my\r\nhatred, as you call it, will be acted? I do hate him, that man; he is\r\nour evil genius!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, my dear, be calm! I don’t know you--you, you have always\r\nbeen Reason incarnate.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lucas entered the room and asked his mistress if she\r\nwould receive _a_ Monsieur Jacques Bricheteau. Madame de l’Estorade\r\nlooked at her friend, as if to consult her.\r\n\r\n“He is that organist who was so useful to Monsieur de Sallenauve during\r\nthe election. I don’t know what he can want of me.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Madame de Camps, “receive him. Before beginning\r\nhostilities it is always well to know what is going on in the enemy’s\r\ncamp.”\r\n\r\n“Show him in,” said the countess.\r\n\r\nJacques Bricheteau entered. Expecting to be received in a friendly\r\ncountry, he had not taken any particular pains with his dress. An old\r\nmaroon frock-coat to the cut of which it would have been difficult to\r\nassign a date, a plaid waistcoat buttoned to the throat, surmounted by a\r\nblack cravat worn without a collar and twisted round the neck, yellowish\r\ntrousers, gray stockings, and laced shoes,--such was the more than\r\nnegligent costume in which the organist allowed himself to appear in a\r\ncountess’s salon.\r\n\r\nRequested briefly to sit down, he said,--\r\n\r\n“Madame, I hope I am not indiscreet in thus presenting myself without\r\nhaving the honor of being known to you, but Monsieur Marie-Gaston told\r\nme of your desire that I should give music-lessons to your daughter. At\r\nfirst I replied that it was impossible, for all my time was occupied;\r\nbut the prefect of police has just afforded me some leisure by\r\ndismissing me from a place I filled in his department; therefore I am\r\nnow happy to place myself at your disposal.”\r\n\r\n“Your dismissal, monsieur, was caused by your activity in Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve’s election, was it not?” asked Madame de Camps.\r\n\r\n“As no reason was assigned for it, I think your conjecture is probably\r\ncorrect; especially as in twenty years I have had no trouble whatever\r\nwith my chiefs.”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be denied,” said Madame de l’Estorade, sharply, “that you have\r\nopposed the views of the government by this proceeding.”\r\n\r\n“Consequently, madame, I have accepted this dismissal as an expected\r\nevil. What interest, after all, had I in retaining my paltry post,\r\ncompared to that of Monsieur de Sallenauve’s election?”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry,” resumed Madame de l’Estorade, “to be unable to accept\r\nthe offer you are good enough to make me. But I have not yet considered\r\nthe question of a music-master for my daughter; and, in any case, I\r\nfear that, in view of your great and recognized talent, your instruction\r\nwould be too advanced for a little girl of fourteen.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jacques Bricheteau, smiling, “no one has recognized my\r\ntalent, madame. Monsieur de Sallenauve and Monsieur Marie-Gaston have\r\nonly heard me once or twice. Apart from that I am the most obscure of\r\nprofessors, and perhaps the dullest. But setting aside the question\r\nof your daughter’s master, I wish to speak of a far more important\r\ninterest, which has, in fact, brought me here. I mean Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve.”\r\n\r\n“Has Monsieur de Sallenauve,” said Madame de l’Estorade, with marked\r\ncoldness of manner, “sent you here with a message to my husband?”\r\n\r\n“No, madame,” replied Jacques Bricheteau, “he has unfortunately given me\r\nno message. I cannot find him. I went to Ville d’Avray this morning, and\r\nwas told that he had started on a journey with Monsieur Marie-Gaston.\r\nThe servant having told me that the object and direction of this journey\r\nwere probably known to you--”\r\n\r\n“Not in any way,” interrupted Madame de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\nNot as yet perceiving that his visit was unacceptable and that\r\nno explanation was desired, Jacques Bricheteau persisted in his\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n“This morning, I received a letter from the notary at Arcis-sur-Aube,\r\nwho informs me that my aunt, Mother Marie-des-Anges, desires me to be\r\ntold of a scandalous intrigue now being organized for the purpose of\r\nousting Monsieur de Sallenauve from his post as deputy. The absence of\r\nour friend will seriously complicate the matter. We can take no steps\r\nwithout him; and I cannot understand why he should disappear without\r\ninforming those who take the deepest interest in him.”\r\n\r\n“That he has not informed you is certainly singular,” replied Madame\r\nde l’Estorade, in the same freezing tone; “but as for my husband or me,\r\nthere is nothing to be surprised about.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this discourteous answer was too plain for Jacques\r\nBricheteau not to perceive it. He looked straight at the countess,\r\nwho lowered her eyes; but the whole expression of her countenance, due\r\nnorth, confirmed the meaning he could no longer mistake in her words.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, madame,” he said, rising. “I was not aware that the future\r\nand the reputation of Monsieur de Sallenauve had become indifferent to\r\nyou. Only a moment ago, in your antechamber, when your servant hesitated\r\nto take in my name, Mademoiselle, your daughter, as soon as she heard I\r\nwas the friend of Monsieur de Sallenauve, took my part warmly; and I\r\nhad the stupidity to suppose that such friendliness was the tone of the\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\nAfter this remark, which gave Madame de l’Estorade the full change for\r\nher coin, Jacques Bricheteau bowed ceremoniously and was about to\r\nleave the room, when a sudden contradiction of the countess’s comedy of\r\nindifference appeared in the person of Nais, who rushed in exclaiming\r\ntriumphantly,--\r\n\r\n“Mamma, a letter from Monsieur de Sallenauve!”\r\n\r\nThe countess turned crimson.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by running in here like a crazy girl?” she said\r\nsternly; “and how do you know that this letter is from the person you\r\nmention?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied Nais, twisting the knife in the wound, “when he wrote you\r\nthose letters from Arcis-sur-Aube, I saw his handwriting.”\r\n\r\n“You are a silly, inquisitive little girl,” said her mother, driven by\r\nthese aggravating circumstances quite outside of her usual habits of\r\nindulgence. “Go to your room.” Then she added to Jacques Bricheteau, who\r\nlingered after the arrival of the letter,--\r\n\r\n“Permit me, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“It is for me, madame, to ask permission to remain until you have\r\nread that letter. If _by chance_ Monsieur de Sallenauve gives you any\r\nparticulars about his journey, you will, perhaps, allow me to profit by\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Sallenauve,” said the countess, after reading the letter,\r\n“requests me to inform my husband that he has gone to Hanwell, county of\r\nMiddlesex, England. You can address him there, monsieur, to the care of\r\nDoctor Ellis.”\r\n\r\nJacques Bricheteau made a second ceremonious bow and left the room.\r\n\r\n“Nais has just given you a taste of her quality,” said Madame de Camps;\r\n“but you deserved it,--you really treated that poor man too harshly.”\r\n\r\n“I could not help it,” replied Madame de l’Estorade; “the day began\r\nwrong, and all the rest follows suit.”\r\n\r\n“Well, about the letter?”\r\n\r\n“It is dreadful; read it yourself.”\r\n\r\n  Madame,--I was able to overtake Lord Lewin, the Englishman of whom\r\n  I spoke to you, a few miles out of Paris. Providence sent him to\r\n  Ville d’Avray to save us from an awful misfortune. Possessing an\r\n  immense fortune, he is, like so many of his countrymen, a victim\r\n  to _spleen_, and it is only his natural force of character which\r\n  has saved him from the worst results of that malady. His\r\n  indifference to life and the perfect coolness with which he spoke\r\n  of suicide won him Marie-Gaston’s friendship in Florence. Lord\r\n  Lewin, having studied the subject of violent emotions, is very\r\n  intimate with Doctor Ellis, a noted alienist, and it not\r\n  infrequently happens that he spends two or three weeks with him at\r\n  Hanwell, Middlesex Co., one of the best-managed lunatic asylums in\r\n  England,--Doctor Ellis being in charge of it.\r\n\r\n  When he arrived at Ville d’Avray, Lord Lewin saw at once that\r\n  Marie-Gaston had all the symptoms of incipient mania. Invisible to\r\n  other eyes, they were apparent to those of Lord Lewin. In speaking\r\n  to me of our poor friend, he used the word _chiffonait_,--meaning\r\n  that he picked up rubbish as he walked, bits of straw, scraps of\r\n  paper, rusty nails, and put them carefully into his pocket. That,\r\n  he informed me, is a marked symptom well known to those who study\r\n  the first stages of insanity. Enticing him to the subject of their\r\n  conversations in Florence, he obtained the fact that the poor\r\n  fellow meditated suicide, and the reason for it. Every night,\r\n  Gaston told him, his wife appeared to him, and he had now resolved\r\n  to _rejoin_ her, to use his own expression. Instead of opposing\r\n  this idea, Lord Lewin took a tone of approval. “But,” he said,\r\n  “men such as we ought not to die in a common way. I myself have\r\n  always had the idea of going to South America, where, not far from\r\n  Paraguay, there is one of the greatest cataracts in the world,\r\n  --the Saut de Gayra. The mists rising from it can be seen at a\r\n  distance of many miles. An enormous volume of water is suddenly\r\n  forced through a narrow channel, and rushes with terrific force\r\n  and the noise of a hundred thunder-claps into the gulf below.\r\n  There, indeed, one could find a noble death.”\r\n\r\n  “Let us go there,” said Gaston.\r\n\r\n  “Yes,” said Lord Lewin, “I am ready to go at once; we must sail\r\n  from England; it will take a few weeks to get there.”\r\n\r\n  In this way, madame, he enticed our poor friend to England, where,\r\n  as you will already have supposed, he has placed him in charge of\r\n  Doctor Ellis, who, they say, has not his equal in Europe for the\r\n  treatment of this particular form of mental aberration.\r\n\r\n  I joined them at Beauvais, and have followed them to Hanwell,\r\n  taking care not to be seen by Marie-Gaston. Here I shall be\r\n  detained until the doctor is able to give a decided opinion as to\r\n  the probable results of our friend’s condition. I greatly fear,\r\n  however, that I cannot possibly return to Paris in time for the\r\n  opening of the session. But I shall write to the president of the\r\n  Chamber, and in case any questions regarding my absence should\r\n  arise, may I ask Monsieur de l’Estorade to do me the favor of\r\n  stating that, to his knowledge, I have been absolutely forced by\r\n  sufficient reasons to absent myself? He will, of course,\r\n  understand that I ought not to explain under any circumstances the\r\n  nature of the affair which has taken me out of the country at this\r\n  unlucky time; but I am certain it will be all-sufficient if a man\r\n  of Monsieur de l’Estorade’s position and character guarantees the\r\n  necessity of my absence.\r\n\r\n  I beg you to accept, madame, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAs Madame de Camps finished reading the letter, the sound of a carriage\r\nentering the courtyard was heard.\r\n\r\n“There are the gentlemen,” said the countess. “Now, had I better show\r\nthis letter to my husband or not?”\r\n\r\n“You can’t avoid doing so,” replied Madame de Camps. “In the first\r\nplace, Nais will chatter about it. Besides, Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\naddresses you in a most respectful manner, and there is nothing in the\r\nletter to feed your husband’s notion.”\r\n\r\n“Who is that common-looking man I met on the stairs talking with Nais?”\r\n said Monsieur de l’Estorade to his wife, as he entered the salon.\r\n\r\nAs Madame de l’Estorade did not seem to understand him, he added,--\r\n\r\n“He is pitted with the small-pox, and wears a maroon coat and shabby\r\nhat.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Madame de Camps, addressing her friend; “it must be the man\r\nwho was here just now. Nais has seized the occasion to inquire about her\r\nidol.”\r\n\r\n“But who is he?” repeated Monsieur de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“I think his name is Bricheteau; he is a friend of Monsieur de\r\nSallenauve,” replied Madame de Camps.\r\n\r\nSeeing the cloud on her husband’s brow, Madame de l’Estorade hastened to\r\nexplain the double object of the organist’s visit, and she gave him the\r\nletter of the new deputy. While he was reading it, Madame de l’Estorade\r\nsaid, aside, to Monsieur de Camps,--\r\n\r\n“He seems to me much better, don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; there’s scarcely a trace left of what we saw this morning. He was\r\ntoo wrought up about his work. Going out did him good; and yet he met\r\nwith a rather unpleasant surprise at Rastignac’s.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” asked Madame de l’Estorade, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“It seems that the affairs of your friend Sallenauve are going wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks for the commission!” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, returning the\r\nletter to his wife. “I shall take very good care not to guarantee his\r\nconduct in any respect.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard anything disagreeable about him?” asked Madame de\r\nl’Estorade, endeavoring to give a tone of indifference to her question.\r\n\r\n“Yes; Rastignac has just told me of letters received from Arcis, where\r\nthey have made the most compromising discoveries.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what did I tell you?” cried Madame de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean? What _did_ you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“I told you some time ago that the acquaintance was one that had better\r\nbe allowed to die out. I remember using that very expression.”\r\n\r\n“But _I_ didn’t draw him here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can’t say that I did; and just now, before I knew of these\r\ndiscoveries you speak of, I was telling Madame de Camps of another\r\nreason why it was desirable to put an end to the acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Madame de Camps, “your wife and I were just discussing, as\r\nyou came in, the sort of frenzy Nais has taken for what she calls her\r\n‘preserver.’ We agreed in thinking there might be future danger in that\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n“From all points of view,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, “it is an\r\nunwholesome acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Monsieur de Camps, who was not in the secret of\r\nthese opinions, “that you go too fast. They may have made what they call\r\ncompromising discoveries about Monsieur de Sallenauve; but what is\r\nthe value of those discoveries? Don’t hang him till a verdict has been\r\nrendered.”\r\n\r\n“My husband can do as he likes,” said Madame de l’Estorade; “but as for\r\nme, I shall drop the acquaintance at once. I want my friends to be, like\r\nCaesar’s wife, beyond suspicion.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, “there’s that unfortunate\r\nobligation--”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear,” cried Madame de l’Estorade, “if a galley-slave saved my\r\nlife, must I admit him to my salon?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! dearest,” exclaimed Madame de Camps, “you are going too far.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said the peer of France, “there is no need to make an\r\nopen rupture; let things end quietly between us. The dear man is now in\r\nforeign parts, and who knows if he means to return?”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Monsieur de Camps, “has he left the country for a mere\r\nrumor?”\r\n\r\n“Not precisely for that reason,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade; “he found\r\na pretext. But once out of France, you know--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe in that conclusion,” said Madame de l’Estorade; “I\r\nthink he will return, and if so, my dear, you really must take your\r\ncourage in both hands and cut short his acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“Is that,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, looking attentively at his wife,\r\n“your actual desire?”\r\n\r\n“Mine?” she replied; “if I had my way, I should write to him and say\r\nthat he would do us a favor by not reappearing in our house. As that\r\nwould be rather a difficult letter to write, let us write it together,\r\nif you are willing.”\r\n\r\n“We will see about it,” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, brightening up\r\nunder this suggestion; “there’s no danger in going slow. The most\r\npressing thing at this moment is the flower-show; I think it closes at\r\nfour o’clock; if so, we have only an hour before us.”\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade, who had dressed before the arrival of Madame de\r\nCamps, rang for her maid to bring her a bonnet and shawl. While she\r\nwas putting them on before a mirror, her husband came up behind her and\r\nwhispered in her ear,--\r\n\r\n“Then you really love me, Renee?”\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy, to ask me such a question as that?” she answered,\r\nlooking at him affectionately.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I must make a confession: that letter, which Philippe\r\nbrought--I read it.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am not surprised at the change in your looks and manner,” said\r\nhis wife. “I, too, will make you a confession: that letter to Monsieur\r\nde Sallenauve, giving him his dismissal,--I have written it; you will\r\nfind it in my blotting-book. If you think it will do, send it.”\r\n\r\nQuite beside himself with delight at finding his proposed successor\r\nso readily sacrificed, Monsieur de l’Estorade did not control his joy;\r\ntaking his wife in his arms, he kissed her effusively.\r\n\r\n“Well done!” cried Monsieur de Camps, laughing; “you have improved since\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“This morning I was a fool,” said the peer of France, hunting in the\r\nblotting-book for the letter, which he might have had the grace to\r\nbelieve in without seeing.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Madame de Camps, in a low voice to her husband, to prevent\r\nfurther remarks. “I’ll explain this queer performance to you by and by.”\r\n\r\nRejuvenated by ten years at least, the peer of France offered his arm\r\nto Madame de Camps, while the amateur iron-master offered his to the\r\ncountess.\r\n\r\n“But Nais!” said Monsieur de l’Estorade, noticing the melancholy face of\r\nhis daughter, who was looking over the stairs at the party. “Isn’t she\r\ngoing too?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the countess; “I am displeased with her.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, bah!” said the father, “I proclaim an amnesty. Get your hat,” he\r\nadded, addressing his daughter.\r\n\r\nNais looked at her mother to obtain a ratification, which her knowledge\r\nof the hierarchy of power in that establishment made her judge to be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n“You can come,” said her mother, “if your father wishes it.”\r\n\r\nWhile they waited in the antechamber for the child, Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade noticed that Lucas was standing up beside a half-finished\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“Whom are you writing to?” he said to his old servant.\r\n\r\n“To my son,” replied Lucas, “who is very impatient to get his sergeant’s\r\nstripes. I am telling him that Monsieur le comte has promised to speak\r\nto his colonel for him.”\r\n\r\n“True, true,” said the peer of France; “it slipped my memory. Remind me\r\nof it to-morrow morning, and I’ll do it the first thing after I am up.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le comte is very good--”\r\n\r\n“And here,” continued his master, feeling in his waistcoat pocket, and\r\nproducing three gold pieces, “send that to the corporal, and tell him to\r\ndrink a welcome to the stripes.”\r\n\r\nLucas was stupefied. Never had he seen his master so expansive or so\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\nWhen Nais returned, Madame de l’Estorade, who had been admiring herself\r\nfor her courage in showing displeasure to her daughter for half an hour,\r\nembraced her as if they were meeting after an absence of two years;\r\nafter which they started for the Luxembourg, where in those days the\r\nHorticultural Society held its exhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE WAY TO MANAGE POLITICAL INTRIGUES\r\n\r\nToward the close of the audience given by the minister of Public\r\nWorks to Monsieur Octave de Camps, who was presented by the Comte de\r\nl’Estorade, an usher entered the room, and gave the minister the card\r\nof the attorney-general, Monsieur Vinet, and that of Monsieur Maxime de\r\nTrailles.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Rastignac; “say to those gentlemen that I will receive\r\nthem in a few moments.”\r\n\r\nShortly after, Monsieur de l’Estorade and Monsieur de Camps rose to take\r\nleave; and it was then that Rastignac very succinctly let the peer know\r\nof the danger looming on the horizon of his friend Sallenauve. Monsieur\r\nde l’Estorade exclaimed against the word _friend_.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, my dear minister,” he said, “why you insist on giving\r\nthat title to a man who is, really and truly, a mere acquaintance, and,\r\nI may add, a passing acquaintance, if the rumors you have just mentioned\r\nto us take actual shape.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear you say that,” said the minister, “because the\r\nfriendly relations which I supposed you to hold towards him would have\r\nembarrassed me a good deal in the hostilities which I foresee must break\r\nout between him and the government.”\r\n\r\n“Most grateful, I am sure, for that sentiment,” replied the peer of\r\nFrance; “but be kind enough to remember that I give you _carte blanche_.\r\nYou are free to handle Monsieur de Sallenauve as your political enemy,\r\nwithout a moment’s fear of troubling me.”\r\n\r\nThereupon they parted, and Messieurs Vinet and de Trailles were\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general, Vinet, was the most devoted and the most consulted\r\nchampion of the government among its various officials. In a possible\r\nreconstitution of the ministry he was obviously the candidate for the\r\nportfolio of justice. Being thoroughly initiated into all the business\r\nof that position, and versed in its secret dealings, nothing was hatched\r\nin that department on which he was not consulted, if not actually\r\nengaged. The electoral matters of Arcis-sur-Aube had a double claim to\r\nhis interest, partly on account of his wife, a Chargeboeuf of Brie, and\r\na relative of the Cinq-Cygnes, but chiefly because of the office held\r\nby his son in the local administration. So that when, earlier in the\r\nmorning, Monsieur de Trailles carried to Rastignac a letter from\r\nMadame Beauvisage, wife of the defeated governmental candidate, full\r\nof statements injurious to the new deputy, the minister had replied,\r\nwithout listening to any explanations,--\r\n\r\n“See Vinet about it; and tell him, from me, to come here with you.”\r\n\r\nNotified by de Trailles, who offered to fetch him in his carriage, Vinet\r\nwas ready enough to go to the minister; and now that we find the three\r\ntogether in Rastignac’s study, we shall be likely to obtain some better\r\nknowledge of the sort of danger hanging over Sallenauve’s head than\r\nwe gained from Jacques Bricheteau’s or Monsieur de l’Estorade’s very\r\ninsufficient information.\r\n\r\n“You say, my dear friends,” said the minister, “that we can win a game\r\nagainst that puritan, who seemed to me, when I met him at l’Estorade’s\r\nlast evening, to be an out-and-out enemy to the government?”\r\n\r\nAdmitted to this interview without official character, Maxime de\r\nTrailles knew life too well to take upon himself to answer this query.\r\nThe attorney-general, on the contrary, having a most exalted sense\r\nof his own political importance, did not miss the opportunity to put\r\nhimself forward.\r\n\r\n“When Monsieur de Trailles communicated to me this morning a letter from\r\nMadame Beauvisage,” he hastened to say, “I had just received one from my\r\nson, conveying to me very much the same information. I am of Monsieur\r\nde Trailles’ opinion, that the affair may become very serious for our\r\nadversary, provided, however, that it is well managed.”\r\n\r\n“I know, as yet, very little about the affair,” remarked the minister.\r\n“As I wished for your opinion in the first place, my dear Vinet, I\r\nrequested Monsieur de Trailles to postpone his explanation of its\r\ndetails until you could be present at the discussion.”\r\n\r\nThis time Maxime was plainly authorized and even required to speak, but\r\nagain Vinet stole the opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Here is what my son Olivier writes me, and it is confirmed by the\r\nletter of Madame Beauvisage, in whom, be it said in passing, my dear\r\nminister, you have lost a most excellent deputy. It appears that on the\r\nlast market-day Maitre Achille Pigoult, who is left in charge of the\r\naffairs of the new deputy, received a visit from a peasant-woman of\r\nRomilly, a large village in the neighborhood of Arcis. The mysterious\r\nfather of the deputy, the so-called Marquis de Sallenauve, declared\r\nhimself to be the last remaining scion of the family; but it seems\r\nthat this woman produced papers in due form, which show her to be\r\na Sallenauve in the direct line, and within the degree of parentage\r\nrequired to constitute her an heir.”\r\n\r\n“Was she as ignorant of the existence of the Marquis de Sallenauve as\r\nthe marquis seems to have been of hers?” asked Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“That does not clearly appear from what she says,” replied the\r\nattorney-general; “but it might so happen among relations so curiously\r\nplaced.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, if you please,” said Rastignac; “before we draw conclusions we\r\nmust know the facts, which, as you are aware, is not always done in the\r\nChamber of deputies.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, sometimes, for the ministers,” remarked Maxime, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is right,” said Vinet; “hail to the man who can muddle\r\nquestions. But to return to our peasant-woman. Not being satisfied,\r\nnaturally, with Maitre Pigoult’s reception of her news, she went into\r\nthe market-square, and there by the help of a legal practitioner from\r\nher village, who seems to have accompanied her, she spread about reports\r\nwhich are very damaging to my worthy colleague in the Chamber. She said,\r\nfor instance, that it was not true that the Marquis de Sallenauve was\r\nhis father; that it was not even true that the Marquis de Sallenauve was\r\nstill living; and moreover that the spurious Sallenauve was a man of no\r\nheart, who had repudiated his real parents,--adding that she could, by\r\nthe help of the able man who accompanied her, compel him to disgorge the\r\nSallenauve property and ‘clear out’ of the place.”\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to that,” said Rastignac; “but this woman must, of\r\ncourse, have papers to prove her allegations?”\r\n\r\n“That is the weak point of the matter,” replied Vinet. “But let me go\r\non with my story. The government has at Arcis a most intelligent and\r\ndevoted functionary in the commissary of police. Circulating among the\r\ngroups, as he usually does on market days, he heard these statements\r\nof the peasant-woman, and reported them at once, not to the mayor, who\r\nmight not have heeded them, but to Madame Beauvisage.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah ca_!” said Rastignac, addressing Maxime; “was the candidate you\r\ngave us such a dolt as that?”\r\n\r\n“Just the man you needed,” replied Maxime,--“silly to the last degree,\r\nand capable of being wound round anybody’s finger. I’ll go any lengths\r\nto repair that loss.”\r\n\r\n“Madame Beauvisage,” continued Vinet, “wished to speak with the woman\r\nherself, and she ordered Groslier--that’s the commissary of police--to\r\nfetch her with a threatening air to the mayor’s office, so as to give\r\nher an idea that the authorities disapproved of her conduct.”\r\n\r\n“Did Madame Beauvisage concoct that plan?” asked Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Maxime, “she is a very clever woman.”\r\n\r\n“Questioned closely by the mayoress,” continued Vinet, “who took care to\r\nhave the mayor present, the peasant-woman was far from categorical. Her\r\ngrounds for asserting that the new deputy could not be the son of the\r\nmarquis, and the assurance with which she stated that the latter had\r\nlong been dead were not, as it appears, very clearly established; vague\r\nrumors and the deductions drawn by the village practitioner seem to be\r\nall there was to them.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Rastignac, “what does all this lead to?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely nothing from a legal point of view,” replied the\r\nattorney-general; “for supposing the woman were able to establish the\r\nfact that this recognition of the said Dorlange was a mere pretence, she\r\nhas no status on which to proceed farther. By Article 339 of the Civil\r\nCode direct heirship alone has the right to attack the recognition of\r\nnatural children.”\r\n\r\n“Your balloon is collapsing fast,” said the minister.\r\n\r\n“So that the woman,” continued Vinet, “has no object in proceeding, for\r\nshe can’t inherit; it belongs to the government to pursue the case of\r\nsupposition of person; she can do no more than denounce the fact.”\r\n\r\n“From which you conclude?” said Rastignac, with that curtness of speech\r\nwhich to a prolix speaker is a warning to be concise.\r\n\r\n“From which I conclude, judicially speaking, that the Romilly\r\npeasant-woman, so far as she is concerned, will have her trouble for her\r\npains; but, speaking politically, the thing takes quite another aspect.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see the political side,” said the minister; “up to this point, I\r\nsee nothing.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” replied the attorney-general, “you will admit that\r\nit is always possible to bring a bad case?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“And I don’t suppose it would signify much to you if the woman did\r\nembark in a matter in which she can lose nothing but her costs?”\r\n\r\n“No, I assure you I am wholly indifferent.”\r\n\r\n“In any case, I should have advised you to let things take their course.\r\nThe Beauvisage husband and wife have engaged to pay the costs and also\r\nthe expense of keeping the peasant-woman and her counsel in Paris during\r\nthe inquiry.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Rastignac, still pressing for a conclusion, “the case is\r\nreally begun. What will be the result?”\r\n\r\n“What will be the result?” cried the attorney-general, getting excited;\r\n“why, anything you please if, _before the case comes for trial_,\r\nyour newspapers comment upon it, and your friends spread reports\r\nand insinuations. What will result? why, an immense fall in public\r\nestimation for our adversary suspected of stealing a name which does\r\nnot belong to him! What will result? why, the opportunity for a fierce\r\nchallenge in the Chamber.”\r\n\r\n“Which you will take upon yourself to make?” asked Rastignac.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I don’t know about that. The matter would have to be rather\r\nmore studied, and the turn the case might take more certain, if I had\r\nanything to do with it.”\r\n\r\n“So, for the present,” remarked the minister, “the whole thing amounts\r\nto an application of Basile’s famous theory about calumny: ‘good to set\r\na-going, because some of it will always stick.’”\r\n\r\n“Calumny!” exclaimed Vinet, “that remains to be seen. Perhaps a good\r\nround of gossip is all that can be made of it. Monsieur de Trailles,\r\nhere, knows better than I do the state of things down there. He can\r\ntell you that the disappearance of the father immediately after the\r\nrecognition had a bad effect upon people’s minds; and every one in\r\nArcis has a vague impression of secret plotting in this affair of the\r\nelection. You don’t know, my dear minister, all that can be made in the\r\nprovinces of a judicial affair when adroitly manipulated,--cooked, as I\r\nmay say. In my long and laborious career at the bar I saw plenty of that\r\nkind of miracle. But a parliamentary debate is another thing. In that\r\nthere’s no need of proof; one can kill one’s man with probabilities and\r\nassertions, if hotly maintained.”\r\n\r\n“But, to come to the point,” said Rastignac, “how do you think the\r\naffair ought to be managed?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” replied Vinet, “I should leave the Beauvisage\r\npeople to pay all costs of whatever kind, inasmuch as they propose to do\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“Do I oppose that?” said the minister. “Have I the right or the means to\r\ndo so?”\r\n\r\n“The affair,” continued Vinet, “should be placed in the hands of some\r\ncapable and wily solicitor, like Desroches, for example, Monsieur de\r\nTrailles’ lawyer. He’ll know how to put flesh on the bones of a case you\r\njustly consider rather thin.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is certainly not my place to say to Monsieur de Trailles\r\nor any other man, ‘I forbid you to employ whom you will as your\r\nsolicitor.’”\r\n\r\n“Then we need some pleader who can talk in a moving way about that\r\nsacred thing the Family, and put himself into a state of indignation\r\nabout these surreptitious and furtive ways of entering its honored\r\nenclosure.”\r\n\r\n“Desroches can point out some such person to you. The government cannot\r\nprevent a man from saying what he pleases.”\r\n\r\n“But,” interposed Maxime, who was forced out of his passive role by the\r\nminister’s coldness, “is _not preventing_ all the help we are to expect\r\nin this affair from the government?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t expect us, I hope, to take this matter upon ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“No, of course not; but we have certainly supposed that you would take\r\nsome interest in the matter.”\r\n\r\n“But how?--in what way?”\r\n\r\n“Well, as Monsieur le procureur said just now, by giving a hint to the\r\nsubsidized newspapers, by stirring up your friends to spread the news,\r\nby using a certain influence which power always exerts on the minds of\r\nmagistrates.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, no!” replied Rastignac. “When you want the government for\r\nan accomplice, my dear Maxime, you must provide a better-laid plot\r\nthan that. From your manner this morning I supposed there was really\r\nsomething in all this, and so I ventured to disturb our excellent\r\nattorney-general, who knows how I value his advice. But really, your\r\nscheme seems to me too transparent and also too narrow not to be doomed\r\nto inevitable defeat. If I were not married, and could pretend to the\r\nhand of Mademoiselle Beauvisage, perhaps I should feel differently; of\r\ncourse you will do as you think best. I do not say that the government\r\nwill not wish you well in your attempt, but it certainly cannot descend\r\nto make it with you.”\r\n\r\n“But see,” said Vinet, interposing to cut off Maxime’s reply, which\r\nwould doubtless have been bitter; “suppose we send the affair to the\r\ncriminal courts, and the peasant-woman, instigated by the Beauvisage\r\ncouple, should denounce the man who had sworn before a notary, and\r\noffered himself for election falsely, as a Sallenauve: the question is\r\none for the court of assizes.”\r\n\r\n“But proofs? I return to that, you must have proof,” said Rastignac.\r\n“Have you even a shadow of it?”\r\n\r\n“You said yourself, just now,” remarked Maxime, “that it was always\r\npossible to bring a bad case.”\r\n\r\n“A civil case, yes; but to fail in a criminal case is a far more serious\r\nmatter. It would be a pretty thing if you were shown not to have a\r\nleg to stand on, and the case ended in a decision of _non-lieu_. You\r\ncouldn’t find a better way to put our enemy on a pedestal as high as the\r\ncolumn of July.”\r\n\r\n“So,” said Maxime, “you see absolutely nothing that can be done?”\r\n\r\n“For us, no. For you, my dear Maxime, who have no official character,\r\nand who, if need be, can support the attack on Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\npistol in hand, as it were, nothing hinders you from proceeding in the\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” said Maxime, bitterly, “I’m a sort of free lance.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; you are a man intuitively convinced of facts impossible\r\nto prove legally, and you do not give way before the judgment of God or\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Trailles rose angrily. Vinet rose also, and, shaking hands\r\nwith Rastignac as he took leave of him, he said,--\r\n\r\n“I don’t deny that your course is a prudent one, and I don’t say that in\r\nyour place I should not do the same thing.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu, Maxime; without bitterness, I hope,” said Rastignac to Monsieur\r\nde Trailles, who bowed coldly and with dignity.\r\n\r\nWhen the two conspirators were alone in the antechamber, Maxime turned\r\nto his companion.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand such squeamishness?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” replied Vinet, “and I wonder to see a clever man like you\r\nso duped.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, duped to make you lose your time and I mine by coming here to\r\nlisten to a lecture on virtue!”\r\n\r\n“That’s not it; but I do think you guileless to be taken in by that\r\nrefusal to co-operate.”\r\n\r\n“What! do you think--”\r\n\r\n“I think that this affair is risky; if it succeeds, the government, arms\r\nfolded, will reap the benefit. But if on the contrary we fail, it will\r\nnot take a share in the defeat. But you may be sure of this, for I\r\nknow Rastignac well: without seeming to know anything, and without\r\ncompromising himself in any way, he will help us, and perhaps more\r\nusefully than by open connivance. Think! did he say a single word on\r\nthe morality of the affair? Didn’t he say, again and again, ‘I don’t\r\noppose--I have no right to prevent’? And as to the venom of the case,\r\nthe only fault he found was that it wasn’t sure to kill. But in truth,\r\nmy dear monsieur, this is going to be a hard pull, and we shall want all\r\nthe cleverness of that fellow Desroches to get us through.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think I had better see him?”\r\n\r\n“Better see him! why, my good friend, you ought to go to him at once.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be better if he talked with you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, no!” exclaimed Vinet. “I may be the man to put the question\r\nin the Chamber; and if Desroches were seen with me, I should lose my\r\nvirginity.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took leave of Maxime with some haste, on the ground that\r\nhe ought then to be at the Chamber.\r\n\r\n“But I,” said Maxime, running after him,--“suppose I want to consult you\r\nin the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I leave to-night for my district, to get things into order before the\r\nopening of the new session.”\r\n\r\n“But about bringing up the question which you say may devolve on you?”\r\n\r\n“I or another. I will hasten back as soon as I can; but you understand,\r\nI must put my department in order for a six months’ absence.”\r\n\r\n“A good journey to you, then, Monsieur le procureur-general,” replied\r\nMaxime, sarcastically.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Monsieur de Trailles had a period of discouragement,\r\nresulting from the discovery that these two political Bertrands meant\r\nthat his paw should pull the chestnuts from the fire. Rastignac’s\r\nbehavior particularly galled him. His mind went back to their first\r\ninterview at Madame Restaud’s, twenty years earlier, when he himself\r\nheld the sceptre of fashion, and Rastignac, a poor student, neither knew\r\nhow to come into a room nor how to leave it. [See “Pere Goriot.”] And\r\nnow Rastignac was peer of France and minister, while he, Maxime, become\r\nhis agent, was obliged with folded arms to hear himself told that his\r\nplot was weak and he must carry it out alone, if at all.\r\n\r\nBut this discouragement did not last.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” he cried to himself, “I _will_ carry it out; my instinct tells\r\nme there is something in it. What nonsense!--a Dorlange, a nobody, to\r\nattempt to checkmate Maxime de Trailles and make a stepping-stone of my\r\ndefeat! To my solicitor’s,” he said to the coachman, opening the door of\r\nthe carriage himself.\r\n\r\nDesroches was at home; and Monsieur de Trailles was immediately admitted\r\ninto his study.\r\n\r\nDesroches was a lawyer who had had, like Raffaelle, several manners.\r\nFirst, possessor of a practice without clients, he had made fish of\r\nevery case that came into his net; and he felt himself, in consequence,\r\nlittle respected by the court. But he was a hard worker, well versed in\r\nall the ins and outs of chicanery, a keen observer, and an intelligent\r\nreader of the movements of the human heart. Consequently he had made for\r\nhimself, in course of time, a very good practice; he had married a rich\r\nwoman, and the moment that he thought himself able to do without crooked\r\nways he had seriously renounced them. In 1839 Desroches had become an\r\nhonest and skilful solicitor: that is to say, he assumed the interests\r\nof his clients with warmth and ability; he never counselled an openly\r\ndishonorable proceeding, still less would he have lent a hand to it.\r\nAs to that fine flower of delicacy to be met with in Derville and some\r\nothers like him, besides the sad fact that it is difficult to keep its\r\nfragrance from evaporating in this business world of which Monsieur de\r\nTalleyrand says, “Business means getting the property of others,” it is\r\ncertain that it can never be added to any second state of existence.\r\nThe loss of that bloom of the soul, like that of other virginities, is\r\nirreparable. Desroches had not aspired to restore it to himself. He\r\nno longer risked anything ignoble or dishonest, but the good tricks\r\nadmitted the code of procedure, the good traps, the good treacheries\r\nwhich could be legitimately played off upon an adversary, he was very\r\nready to undertake.\r\n\r\nDesroches was moreover a man of parts and witty; loving the pleasures of\r\nthe table, and like all men perpetually the slaves of imperious toil,\r\nhe felt the need of vigorous amusement, taken on the wing and highly\r\nspiced. While purifying after a fashion his judicial life, he still\r\ncontinued the legal adviser of artists, men of letters, actresses,\r\ncourtesans, and elegant bohemians like Maxime de Trailles, because he\r\nliked to live their life; they were sympathetic to him as he to them.\r\nTheir witty _argot_, their easy morals, their rather loose adventures,\r\ntheir expedients, their brave and honorable toil, in a word, their\r\ngreatness and their weakness,--he understood it all marvellously well;\r\nand, like an ever-indulgent providence, he lent them his aid whenever\r\nthey asked for it. But in order to conceal from his dignified and more\r\nvaluable clients whatever might be compromising in the _clientele_ he\r\nreally preferred, Desroches had his days of domesticity when he was\r\nhusband and father, especially on Sundays. He appeared in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne in a modest caleche beside his wife (whose ugliness revealed\r\nthe size of her _dot_), with three children on the front seat, who were\r\nluckless enough to resemble their mother. This family picture, these\r\nvirtuous Dominical habits, recalled so little the week-day Desroches,\r\ndining in cafes with all the male and female _viveurs_ of renown,\r\nthat one of them, Malaga, a circus-rider, famous for her wit and vim,\r\nremarked that lawyers ought not to be allowed to masquerade in that way\r\nand deceive the public with fictitious family joys.\r\n\r\nIt was to this relative integrity that de Trailles now went for counsel,\r\nas he never failed to do in all the many difficulties he encountered in\r\nlife. Following a good habit, Desroches listened, without interrupting,\r\nto the long explanation of the case submitted to him. As Maxime hid\r\nnothing from this species of confessor, he gave his reasons for wishing\r\nto injure Sallenauve, representing him, in all good faith, as having\r\nusurped the name under which he was elected to the Chamber,--his hatred\r\nmaking him take the possibility for positive evidence.\r\n\r\nIn his heart, Desroches did not want to take charge of an affair in\r\nwhich he saw not the slightest chance of success; but he showed his lax\r\nintegrity by talking over the affair with his client as if it were an\r\nordinary case of legal practice, instead of telling him frankly his\r\nopinion that this pretended “case” was a mere intrigue. The number\r\nof things done in the domain of evil by connivance in speech, without\r\nproceeding to the actual collusion of action, are incalculable.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” said Desroches, when the matter was all explained,\r\n“a civil suit is not to be thought of. Your Romilly peasant-woman might\r\nhave her hands full of proofs, but she has no ground herself to stand\r\nupon; she has no legal interest in contesting the rights of this\r\nrecognized natural son.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is what Vinet said just now.”\r\n\r\n“As for the criminal case, you could, no doubt, compel it by giving\r\ninformation to the police authorities of this alleged imposture--”\r\n\r\n“Vinet,” interrupted Maxime, “inclined to the criminal proceeding.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but there are a great many objections to it. In the first place,\r\nin order that the complaint be received at all, you must produce\r\na certain amount of proof; then, supposing it is received, and the\r\nauthorities are determined to pursue the case, you must have more\r\nevidence of criminality than you have now; and, moreover, supposing that\r\nyou can show that the so-called Marquis de Sallenauve committed a fraud,\r\nhow will you prove that the so-called son was privy to it? He might have\r\nbeen the dupe of some political schemer.”\r\n\r\n“But what interest could such a schemer have in giving Dorlange the many\r\nadvantages he has derived from the recognition?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear fellow, in political manners all queer proceedings are\r\npossible; there is no such fertile source for compilers of _causes\r\ncelebres_ and novelists. In the eyes of the law, you must remember, the\r\ncounterfeiting of a person is not always a crime.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” asked Maxime.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Desroches, taking up the Five Codes; “do me the favor to\r\nread Article 5 of the Penal Code, the only one which gives an opening to\r\nthe case you have in mind.”\r\n\r\nMaxime read aloud the article, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n“‘Any functionary or public officer who, in the exercise of his\r\nfunction, shall commit forgery--either by false signatures, by\r\nalterations of deeds, writings, or signatures, or by counterfeiting\r\npersons--’ There, you see,” said Maxime, interrupting himself,--“‘by\r\ncounterfeiting persons--’”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” insisted Desroches.\r\n\r\n“‘--by counterfeiting persons,’” resumed de Trailles, “‘either by\r\nwritings made or intercalated in the public records or other documents,\r\nshall be punished by imprisonment at hard labor for life.’”\r\n\r\nMaxime lingered lovingly over the last words, which gave his revenge a\r\nforetaste of the fate that awaited Sallenauve.\r\n\r\n“My dear count,” said Desroches, “you do as the barristers do; they read\r\nto the jury only so much of a legal document as suits their point of\r\nview. You pay no attention to the fact that the only persons affected by\r\nthis article are _functionaries_ or _public officers_.”\r\n\r\nMaxime re-read the article, and convinced himself of the truth of that\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n“But,” he objected, “there must be something elsewhere about such a\r\ncrime when committed by private individuals.”\r\n\r\n“No, there is not; you can trust my knowledge of jurisprudence,--the\r\nCode is absolutely silent in that direction.”\r\n\r\n“Then the crime we wish to denounce can be committed with impunity?”\r\n\r\n“Its repression is always doubtful,” replied Desroches. “Judges do\r\nsometimes make up for the deficiency of the Code in this respect. Here,”\r\n he added, turning over the leaves of a book of reference,--“here are two\r\ndecisions of the court of assizes, reported in Carnot’s Commentary on\r\nthe Penal Code: one of July 7, 1814, the other April 24, 1818,--both\r\nconfirmed by the court of appeals, which condemn for forgery, by\r\n‘counterfeiting persons,’ individuals who were neither functionaries\r\nnor public officers: but these decisions, unique in law, rest on the\r\nauthority of an article in which the crime they punish is not even\r\nmentioned; and it is only by elaborate reasoning that they contrived to\r\nmake this irregular application of it. You can understand, therefore,\r\nhow very doubtful the issue of such a case would be, because in the\r\nabsence of a positive rule you can never tell how the magistrates might\r\ndecide.”\r\n\r\n“Consequently, your opinion, like Rastignac’s, is that we had better\r\nsend our peasant-woman back to Romilly and drop the whole matter?”\r\n\r\n“There is always something to be done if one knows how to set about it,”\r\n replied Desroches. “There is a point that neither you nor Rastignac nor\r\nVinet seems to have thought of; and that is, to proceed in a criminal\r\ncase against a member of the national representation, except for\r\nflagrant crime, requires the consent and authority of the Chamber.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Maxime, “but I don’t see how a new difficulty is going to\r\nhelp us.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t be sorry to send your adversary with the galleys,” said\r\nDesroches, laughing.\r\n\r\n“A villain,” added Maxime, “who may make me lose a rich marriage; a\r\nfellow who poses for stern virtue, and then proceeds to trickery of this\r\nkind!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you must resign yourself to a less glorious result; but you can\r\nmake a pretty scandal, and destroy the reputation of your man; and that\r\nought, it seems to me, to serve your ends.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,--better that than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, here’s what I advise. Don’t let your peasant-woman lodge\r\nher complaint before the criminal court, but make her place in the\r\nhands of the president of the Chamber of deputies a simple request for\r\npermission to proceed. Probably the permission will not be granted, and\r\nthe affair will have to stop at that stage; but the matter being once\r\nmade known will circulate through the Chambers, the newspapers will get\r\nhold of it and make a stir, and the ministry, _sub rosa_, can envenom\r\nthe vague accusation through its friends.”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu_! my dear fellow,” cried Maxime, delighted to find a way\r\nopen to his hatred, “you’ve a strong head,--stronger than that of these\r\nso-called statesmen. But this request for permission addressed to the\r\npresident of the Chamber, who is to draw it up?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! not I,” said Desroches, who did not wish to mix himself up any\r\nfarther in this low intrigue. “It isn’t legal assistance that you\r\nwant; this is simply firing your first gun, and I don’t undertake that\r\nbusiness. But you can find plenty of briefless barristers always ready\r\nto put their finger in the political pie. Massol, for instance, can draw\r\nit up admirably. But you must not tell him that the idea came from me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! as for that,” said Maxime, “I’ll take it all on my own shoulders.\r\nPerhaps in this form Rastignac may come round to the project.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but take care you don’t make an enemy of Vinet, who will think you\r\nvery impertinent to have an idea which ought, naturally, to have come\r\ninto the head of so great a parliamentary tactician as himself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, before long,” said Maxime, rising, “I hope to bring the Vinets\r\nand Rastignacs, and others like them, to heel. Where do you dine this\r\nevening?” he added.\r\n\r\n“In a cave,” replied Desroches, “with a band.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s that?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose, in the course of your erotic existence, you have had\r\nrecourse to the good offices of a certain Madame de Saint-Esteve?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Maxime, “I have always done my own business in that line.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Desroches, “you conquer in the upper ranks, where, as a\r\ngeneral thing, they don’t use go-betweens. But, at any rate, you have\r\nheard of Madame de Saint-Esteve?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; her establishment is in the rue Neuve-Saint-Marc, and it was\r\nshe who got that pot of money out of Nucingen for La Torpille. Isn’t she\r\nsome relation to the chief of detective police, who bears the same name,\r\nand used to be one of the same kind as herself?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that,” said Desroches, “but what I can tell you\r\nis that in her business as procuress--as it was called in days less\r\ndecorous than our own--the worthy woman has made a fortune, and now,\r\nwithout any serious change of occupation, she lives magnificently in\r\nthe rue de Provence, where she carries on the business of a matrimonial\r\nagency.”\r\n\r\n“Is that where you are going to dine?” asked Maxime.\r\n\r\n“Yes, with the director of the London opera-house, Emile Blondet, Finot,\r\nLousteau, Felicien Vernon, Theodore Gaillard, Hector Merlin, and Bixiou,\r\nwho was commissioned to invite me, as it seems they are in want of my\r\n_experience_ and _capacity for business_!”\r\n\r\n“_Ah ca_! then there’s some financial object in this dinner?”\r\n\r\n“No; it merely concerns a theatrical venture,--the engagement of a prima\r\ndonna; and they want to submit the terms of the contract to my judgment.\r\nYou understand that the rest of the guests are invited to trumpet the\r\naffair as soon as the papers are signed.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the object of all this preparation?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! a _star_,--destined, they say, to European success; an Italian,\r\ndiscovered by a Swedish nobleman, Comte Halphertius, through the\r\nmedium of Madame de Saint-Esteve. The illustrious manager of the London\r\nopera-house is negotiating this treaty in order that she shall make her\r\nfirst appearance at his theatre.”\r\n\r\n“Well, adieu, my dear fellow; a pleasant dinner,” said Maxime, preparing\r\nto depart. “If your star shines in London, it will probably appear\r\nin our firmament next winter. As for me, I must go and attend to the\r\nsunrise in Arcis. By the bye, where does Massol live?”\r\n\r\n“Faith! I couldn’t tell you that. I never myself trust him with a case,\r\nfor I will not employ barristers who dabble in politics. But you can\r\nget his address from the ‘Gazette des Tribuneaux’; he is one of their\r\nreporters.”\r\n\r\nMaxime went to the office of that newspaper; but, probably on account\r\nof creditors, the office servant had express orders not to give the\r\nbarrister’s address, so that, in spite of his arrogant, imperious\r\nmanner, Monsieur de Trailles obtained no information. Happily, he\r\nbethought him that he frequently saw Massol at the Opera, and he\r\nresolved to seek him there that evening. Before going to dinner, he\r\nwent to the lodgings in the rue Montmartre, where he had installed\r\nthe Romilly peasant-woman and her counsel, whom Madame Beauvisage had\r\nalready sent to Paris. He found them at dinner, making the most of the\r\nBeauvisage funds, and he gave them an order to come to his apartment the\r\nnext day at half-past eleven without breakfasting.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he found Massol, as he expected, at the opera-house.\r\nGoing up to the lawyer with the slightly insolent manner which was\r\nnatural to him, he said,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I have an affair, half legal, half political, which I desire\r\nto talk over with you. If it did not demand a certain amount of secrecy,\r\nI would go to your office, but I think we could talk with more safety\r\nin my own apartment; where, moreover, I shall be able to put you in\r\ncommunication with other persons concerned in the affair. May I hope\r\nthat to-morrow morning, at eleven o’clock, you will do me the favor to\r\ntake a cup of tea with me?”\r\n\r\nIf Massol had had an office, he might possibly not have consented, for\r\nthe sake of his legal dignity, to reverse the usual order of things; but\r\nas he perched rather than lodged in any particular place, he was glad of\r\nan arrangement which left his abode, if he had any, incognito.\r\n\r\n“I shall have the honor to be with you at the hour named,” he replied\r\nceremoniously.\r\n\r\n“Rue Pigalle,” said Maxime, “No. 6.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” returned Massol,--“a few steps from the corner of the rue\r\nde la Rochefoucauld.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES\r\n\r\nA few evenings after the one on which Sallenauve and Marie-Gaston had\r\ntaken Jacques Bricheteau to Saint-Sulpice to hear the Signora Luigia’s\r\nvoice, the church was the scene of a curious little incident that\r\npassed by almost wholly unperceived. A young man entered hastily by a\r\nside-door; he seemed agitated, and so absorbed in some anxiety that he\r\nforgot to remove his hat. The beadle caught him by the arm, and his face\r\nbecame livid, but, turning round, he saw at once that his fears were\r\ncauseless.\r\n\r\n“Is your hat glued on your head, young man?” said the beadle, pompously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, pardon me, monsieur,” he replied, snatching it off; “I forgot\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThen he slipped into the thickest of the crowd and disappeared.\r\n\r\nA few seconds after the irruption of this youth the same door gave\r\naccess to a man around whose powerful, seamed face was the collar of a\r\nwhite beard, which, combined with a thick shock of hair, also white but\r\nslightly reddish in tone and falling almost to his shoulders, gave him\r\nvery much the air of an old Conventional, or a Bernardin de Saint-Pierre\r\nwho had had the small-pox. His face and his hair placed him in the\r\nsixties, but his robust figure, the energetic decision of his movements,\r\nand, above all, the piercing keenness of the glance which he cast about\r\nhim on entering the church, showed a powerful organization on which the\r\npassage of years had made little or no impression. No doubt, he was in\r\nsearch of the young fellow who had preceded him; but he did not commit\r\nthe mistake of entering the crowd, where he knew of course that the\r\nyouth had lost himself. Like a practised hunter, he saw that pursuit was\r\nuseless, and he was just about to leave the church when, after a short\r\norgan prelude, the contralto of the signora delivering its solemn notes\r\ngave forth that glorious harmony to which is sung the Litany of the\r\nVirgin. The beauty of the voice, the beauty of the chant, the beauty\r\nof the words of the sacred hymn, which the fine method of the singer\r\nbrought out distinctly, made a singular impression on the stalwart\r\nstranger. Instead of leaving the church, he put himself in the shadow of\r\na column, against which he leaned as he stood; but as the last notes of\r\nthe divine canticle died away among the arches of the church, he knelt\r\non the pavement, and whoever had chanced to look that way would have\r\nseen two heavy tears rolling slowly down his cheeks. The benediction\r\ngiven, and the crowd dispersing, he rose, wiped his eyes, and,\r\nmuttering, “What a fool I am!” left the church. Then he went to the\r\nPlace Saint-Sulpice, and, beckoning to a coach on the stand, he said to\r\nthe driver,--\r\n\r\n“Rue de Provence, my man, quick! there’s fat in it.”\r\n\r\nReaching the house, he went rapidly up the stairway, and rang at the\r\ndoor of an apartment on the first floor.\r\n\r\n“Is my aunt at home?” he inquired of the Negro who opened it. Then he\r\nfollowed the man, and was presently ushered into a salon where the Negro\r\nannounced,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Saint-Esteve.”\r\n\r\nThe salon which the famous chief of the detective police now entered was\r\nremarkable for the luxury, but still more for the horribly bad taste,\r\nof its appointments. Three women of advanced age were seated round a\r\ncard-table earnestly employed in a game of dominoes. Three glasses and\r\nan empty silver bowl which gave forth a vinous odor showed that the\r\nworship of double-sixes was not without its due libations.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, mesdames,” said the chief of police, sitting down; “for I\r\nhave something to say to each of you.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll listen presently,” said his aunt; “you can’t interrupt the game.\r\nIt won’t be long; I play for four.”\r\n\r\n“White all round!” said one of the hags.\r\n\r\n“Domino!” cried the Saint-Esteve. “I win; you have four points between\r\nyou two, and the whites are all out. Well, my dear, what is it?” she\r\nsaid, turning to her nephew, after a rather stormy reckoning among the\r\nwitches was over.\r\n\r\n“You, Madame Fontaine,” said the chief of police, addressing one of the\r\nvenerable beings, whose head was covered with disorderly gray hair and\r\na battered green bonnet,--“you neglect your duty; you have sent me no\r\nreport, and, on the contrary, I get many complaints of you. The prefect\r\nhas a great mind to close your establishment. I protect you on account\r\nof the services you are supposed to render us; but if you don’t render\r\nthem, I warn you, without claiming any gifts of prediction, that your\r\nfate-shop will be shut up.”\r\n\r\n“There now!” replied the pythoness, “you prevented me from hiring\r\nMademoiselle Lenormand’s apartment in the rue de Tournon, and how can\r\nyou expect me to make reports about the cooks and clerks and workmen and\r\ngrisettes who are all I get where I am? If you had let me work among the\r\ngreat folks, I’d make you reports and plenty of them.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you can say that, Madame Fontaine,” said Madame de\r\nSaint-Esteve. “I am sure I send you all my clients. It was only the\r\nother day,” continued the matrimonial agent, “I sent you that Italian\r\nsinger, living with a deputy who is against the government; why didn’t\r\nyou report about that?”\r\n\r\n“There’s another thing,” said the chief of police, “which appears\r\nin several of the complaints that I received about you,--that nasty\r\nanimal--”\r\n\r\n“What, Astaroth?” said Madame Fontaine.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that batrachian, that toad, to come down to his right name. It\r\nseems he nearly killed a woman who was pregnant--”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” interrupted the sorceress, “if I am to tell fortunes\r\nalone, you might as well guillotine me at once. Because a fool of a\r\nwoman lay-in with a dead child, must toads be suppressed in nature? Why\r\ndid God make them?”\r\n\r\n“My dear woman,” said the chief, “did you never hear that in 1617 a\r\nlearned man was put to death for having a toad in a bottle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know that; but we are not in those light ages,” replied Madame\r\nFontaine, facetiously.\r\n\r\n“As for you, Madame Nourrisson, the complaint is that you gather your\r\nfruit unripe. You ought to know by this time the laws and regulations,\r\nand I warn you that everything under twenty-one years of age is\r\nforbidden. I wonder I have to remind you of it. Now, aunt, what I have\r\nto say to you is confidential.”\r\n\r\nThus dismissed, two of the Fates departed.\r\n\r\nSince the days when Jacques Collin had abdicated his former kingship\r\nand had made himself, as they say, a new skin in the police force,\r\nJacqueline Collin, though she had never put herself within reach of\r\nthe law, had certainly never donned the robe of innocence. But having\r\nattained, like her nephew, to what might fairly be called opulence, she\r\nkept at a safe and respectful distance from the Penal Code, and under\r\ncover of an agency that was fairly avowable, she sheltered practices\r\nmore or less shady, on which she continued to bestow an intelligence and\r\nan activity that were really infernal.\r\n\r\n“Aunt,” said Vautrin, “I have so many things to say to you that I don’t\r\nknow where to begin.”\r\n\r\n“I should think so! It is a week since I’ve seen you.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, I must tell you that I have just missed a splendid\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of chance?” asked Jacqueline.\r\n\r\n“In the line of my odious calling. But this time the capture was worth\r\nmaking. Do you remember that little Prussian engraver about whom I sent\r\nyou to Berlin?”\r\n\r\n“The one who forged those Vienna bank bills in that wonderful way?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I just missed arresting him near Saint-Sulpice. But I followed him\r\ninto the church, where I heard your Signora Luigia.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Jacqueline, “she has made up her mind at last, and has left\r\nthat imbecile of a sculptor.”\r\n\r\n“It is about her that I have come to talk to you,” said Vautrin.\r\n“Here are the facts. The Italian opera season in London has begun\r\nbadly,--their prima donna is taken ill. Sir Francis Drake, the\r\nimpresario, arrived in Paris yesterday, at the Hotel des Princes, rue\r\nde Richelieu, in search of a prima donna, at any rate _pro tem_. I have\r\nbeen to see him in the interests of the signora. Sir Francis Drake is\r\nan Englishman, very bald, with a red nose, and long yellow teeth. He\r\nreceived me with cold politeness, and asked in very good French what my\r\nbusiness was.”\r\n\r\n“Did you propose to him Luigia?”\r\n\r\n“That was what I went for,--in the character, be it understood, of\r\na Swedish nobleman. He asked if her talent was known. ‘Absolutely\r\nunknown,’ I replied. ‘It is risky,’ said Sir Francis; ‘nevertheless\r\narrange to let me hear her.’ I told him that she was staying with her\r\nfriend Madame de Saint-Esteve, at whose house I could take the liberty\r\nto invite him to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“When?” asked Jacqueline.\r\n\r\n“To-day is the 19th; I said the 21st. Order the dinner from Chevet for\r\nfifteen persons, and send for your client Bixiou to make you out the\r\nlist. Tell him you want the chief men of the press, a lawyer to settle\r\nthe terms of the contract, and a pianist to accompany the signora. Let\r\nher know what hangs upon it. Sir Francis Drake and I will make up the\r\nnumber. Useless to tell you that I am your friend Comte Halphertius,\r\nwho, having no house in Paris, gives this dinner at yours. Mind that\r\neverything is done in the best taste.”\r\n\r\nIn designating Bixiou to his aunt as the recruiting-officer of the\r\ndinner, Vautrin knew that through the universality of his relations with\r\nwriting, singing, designing, eating, living, and squirming Paris, no one\r\nwas as capable as he of spreading the news of the dinner broadcast.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock precisely all the guests named by Desroches to Maxime,\r\nplus Desroches himself, were assembled in the salon of the rue de\r\nProvence, when the Negro footman opened the door and announced Sir\r\nFrancis Drake and his Excellency the Comte Halphertius. The dress of\r\nthe Swedish nobleman was correct to the last degree,--black coat, white\r\ncravat, and white waistcoat, on which glowed the ribbon of an order\r\nhanging from his neck; the rest of his decorations were fastened to his\r\ncoat by chainlets. At the first glance which he cast upon the company,\r\nVautrin had the annoyance of beholding that Jacqueline’s habits and\r\ninstincts had been more potent than his express order,--for a species of\r\ngreen and yellow turban surmounted her head in a manner which he felt to\r\nbe ridiculous; but thanks to the admirable manner in which the rest of\r\nhis programme had been carried out, the luckless coiffure was forgiven.\r\n\r\nAs for Signora Luigia, dressed in black, which was customary with her,\r\nand having had the good sense to reject the services of a _coiffeur_,\r\nshe was royally beautiful. An air of melancholy gravity, expressed by\r\nher whole person, inspired a sentiment of respect which surprised the\r\nmen who on Bixiou’s invitation were there to judge of her. The only\r\nspecial presentation that was made among the guests was that of\r\nDesroches to Vautrin, which Bixiou made in the following lively\r\nformula:--\r\n\r\n“Maitre Desroches, the most intelligent solicitor of modern times--Comte\r\nHalphertius of Sweden.”\r\n\r\nAs for Sir Francis Drake, he seemed at first inclined to disdain the\r\ninfluence of the dramatic newspapers, whose representatives were there\r\nassembled; but presently recognizing Felicien Vernou and Lousteau, two\r\nnoted men of that secondary press, he greeted them heartily and shook\r\nthem by the hand.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner was announced, Comte Halphertius judged it advisable to\r\nmake a little speech.\r\n\r\n“Dear madame,” he said to his aunt, “you are really a fairy godmother.\r\nThis is the first time I have ever been in a Parisian salon, and here\r\nyou have assembled to meet me all that literature, the arts, and the\r\nlegal profession can offer of their best. I, who am only a\r\nnorthern barbarian,--though our country, too, can boast of its\r\ncelebrities,--Linnaeus, Berzelius, Thorwaldsen, Tegner, Franzen, Geier,\r\nand the charming novelist Frederika Bremer,--I find myself a cipher in\r\nsuch company.”\r\n\r\n“But in Bernadotte France and Sweden clasped hands,” replied Madame de\r\nSaint-Esteve, whose historical erudition went as far as that.\r\n\r\n“It is very certain,” said Vautrin, “that our beloved sovereign, Charles\r\nXIV.--”\r\n\r\nThe announcement of dinner by a majordomo, who threw open the double\r\ndoors of the salon, put an end to this remark. Jacqueline took Vautrin’s\r\narm, saying in a whisper as they walked along,--\r\n\r\n“Have I done things all right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Vautrin, “it is all in good style, except that devil of a\r\nturban of yours, which makes you look like a poll-parrot.”\r\n\r\n“Why, no,” said Jacqueline, “not at all; with my Javanese face” (she was\r\nborn on the island of Java), “oriental things set me off.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Saint-Esteve placed Sir Francis Drake upon her right, and\r\nDesroches on her left; Vautrin sat opposite, flanked on either side by\r\nEmile Blondet, of the “Debats,” and the Signoria Luigia; the rest of the\r\ncompany placed themselves as they pleased. The dinner, on the whole, was\r\ndull; Bixiou, at Madame de Saint-Esteve’s request, had warned the party\r\nto risk nothing that might offend the chaste ears of the pious Italian.\r\nForced to mind their morals, as a celebrated critic once observed, these\r\nmen of wit and audacity lost their spirit; and, taking refuge in the\r\nmenu, which was excellent, they either talked together in a low voice,\r\nor let the conversation drag itself along in bourgeois commonplaces.\r\nThey ate and they drank, but they did not dine. Bixiou, incapable of\r\nbearing this state of things during a whole dinner, determined to\r\ncreate a reaction. The appearance of this Swedish magnate, evidently on\r\nintimate terms with the Saint-Esteve, puzzled him. He noticed a certain\r\ninsufficiency in Vautrin, and thought to himself that if he were really\r\na great nobleman, he would be more equal to the occasion, and give\r\na tone to the feast. He determined, therefore, to test him, and thus\r\nprovide amusement, at any rate, for himself. So, at the end of the\r\nsecond course, he suddenly said from his end of the table,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le comte, you are too young, of course, to have known Gustavus\r\nIII., whom Scribe and Auber have set in opera, while the rest of us\r\nglorify him in a _galop_.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Vautrin, jumping at the chance thus given\r\nhim, “I am nearly sixty years of age, which makes me thirteen in 1792,\r\nwhen our beloved sovereign was killed by the assassin Ankarstroem, so\r\nthat I can well remember that period.”\r\n\r\nThus, by means of a little volume entitled “Characters and Anecdotes of\r\nthe Court of Sweden,” printed in 1808, and bought on the quays in the\r\ninterests of his Swedish incarnation, the chief of the detective police\r\nevaded the trap. He did better. The faucet being open, he poured forth\r\nsuch an abundance of erudition and detailed circumstances, he related\r\nso many curious and secret anecdotes, especially relating to the _coup\r\nd’etat_ by which, in 1772, Gustavus III. had freed his crown,--in short,\r\nhe was so precise and so interesting that as they left the table Emile\r\nBlondet said to Bixiou,--\r\n\r\n“I thought, as you did, that a foreign count in the hands of a marriage\r\nagent was a very suspicious character; but he knows the court of\r\nSweden in a way that it was quite impossible to get out of books. He is\r\nevidently a man well born; one might make some interesting articles out\r\nof the stories he has just told.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bixiou, “and I mean to cultivate his acquaintance; I could\r\nmake a good deal out of him in the Charivari.”\r\n\r\n“You have better find out first,” said Desroches, “whether he has enough\r\nFrench humor to like being caricatured.”\r\n\r\nPresently the first notes of the piano gave notice that the Signora\r\nLuigia was about to mount the breach. She first sang the romance in\r\n“Saul” with a depth of expression which moved the whole company, even\r\nthough that areopagus of judges were digesting a good dinner, as to\r\nwhich they had not restrained themselves. Emile Blondet, who was more\r\nof a political thinker than a man of imagination, was completely carried\r\naway by his enthusiasm. As the song ended, Felicien Vernou and Lousteau\r\nwent up to Sir Francis Drake and reproached him for wishing to take\r\nsuch a treasure from France, at the same time flattering him for his\r\ncleverness as an impresario.\r\n\r\nLa Luigia then sang an air from the “Nina” of Paesiello; and in\r\nthat--the part being very dramatic--she showed a talent for comedy\r\nsecond only to her vocal gift. It was received with truly genuine\r\napplause; but what assured and completed her success with these trained\r\njudges was her modesty and the sort of ignorance in which she still\r\nremained of her amazing talent,--in the midst, too, of praises which\r\nmight have turned her head. Accustomed to frenzied self-love and\r\nthe insolent pretensions of the veriest sparrow of the opera, these\r\njournalists were amazed and touched by the humility, the simplicity of\r\nthis empress, who seemed quite astonished at the effect she produced.\r\n\r\nThe success of the trial passed all expectation. There was but one voice\r\nas to the desirability of immediately engaging her; and Sir Francis\r\nDrake, Vautrin, and Desroches presently passed into an adjoining room\r\nto draw up the terms of the contract. As soon as that was done, Vautrin\r\nreturned to the salon for _la diva_, requesting her to hear the contract\r\nread and to affix her signature. Her departure for London without\r\nfurther delay was fixed for the following day in company with Sir\r\nFrancis Drake.\r\n\r\nA few days later the packet-boat from Boulogne conveyed to England\r\nanother personage of this history. Jacques Bricheteau, having obtained\r\nSallenauve’s present address from Madame de l’Estorade, and considering\r\nthe danger which threatened the new deputy extremely urgent, decided not\r\nto write, but to go himself to England and confer with him in person.\r\nWhen he reached London, he was surprised to learn that Hanwell was the\r\nmost celebrated insane asylum in Great Britain. Had he reflected on the\r\nmental condition of Marie-Gaston, he might have guessed the truth. As\r\nit was, he felt completely bewildered; but not committing the blunder\r\nof losing his time in useless conjectures, he went on without a moment’s\r\ndelay to Hanwell, which establishment is only about nine miles from\r\nLondon, pleasantly situated at the foot of a hill on the borders of\r\nMiddlesex and Surrey.\r\n\r\nAfter a long detention in the waiting-room, he was at last enabled\r\nto see his friend at a moment when Marie-Gaston’s insanity, which for\r\nseveral days had been in the stages of mania, was yielding to the care\r\nof the doctor, and showed some symptoms of a probable recovery. As soon\r\nas Sallenauve was alone with the organist, he inquired the reason that\r\nled him to follow him; and he heard, with some emotion, the news of the\r\nintrigues which Maxime de Trailles had apparently organized against him.\r\nReturning to his original suspicions, he said to Jacques Bricheteau,--\r\n\r\n“Are you really sure that that person who declared himself my father was\r\nthe Marquis de Sallenauve, and that I am truly his son?”\r\n\r\n“Mother Marie-des-Anges and Achille Pigoult, by whom I was warned\r\nof this plot, have no more doubt than I have of the existence of the\r\nMarquis de Sallenauve; this gossip with which they threaten you has, in\r\nmy judgment, but one dangerous aspect. I mean that by your absence you\r\nare giving a free field to your adversaries.”\r\n\r\n“But,” replied the deputy, “the Chamber will not condemn me without a\r\nhearing. I wrote to the president and asked for leave of absence, and I\r\ntook the precaution to request de l’Estorade, who knows the reason of my\r\nabsence, to be kind enough to guarantee me, should my absence be called\r\nin question.”\r\n\r\n“I think you also wrote to Madame de l’Estorade, didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I wrote only to her,” replied Sallenauve. “I wanted to tell her about\r\nthe great misfortune of our mutual friend, and, at the same time, I\r\nasked her to explain to her husband the kind service I requested him to\r\ndo for me.”\r\n\r\n“If that is so,” said Bricheteau, “you need not count for one moment\r\non the l’Estorades. A knowledge of this trick which is being organized\r\nagainst you has reached their ears and affected their minds, I am very\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\nHe then related the reception he had met with from Madame de l’Estorade,\r\nand the uncivil remarks she had made about Sallenauve, from which he\r\nconcluded that in the struggle about to take place no assistance could\r\nbe relied on from that direction.\r\n\r\n“I have every reason to be surprised,” said Sallenauve, “after the warm\r\nassurances Madame de l’Estorade has given me of an unfailing good-will.\r\nHowever,” he added, philosophically, “everything is possible in this\r\nworld; and calumny has often undermined friendship.”\r\n\r\n“You understand, therefore,” said Bricheteau, “that it is all-important\r\nto start for Paris, without a moment’s delay. Your stay here, all things\r\nconsidered, is only relatively necessary.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Sallenauve, “the doctor considers that my\r\npresence here may be of the utmost utility. He has not yet let me see\r\nthe patient, because he expects to produce some great result when I do\r\nsee him.”\r\n\r\n“That is problematical,” returned Jacques Bricheteau; “whereas by\r\nstaying here you are compromising your political future and your\r\nreputation in the most positive manner. Such a sacrifice no friendship\r\nhas the right to demand of you.”\r\n\r\n“Let us talk of it with the doctor,” said Sallenauve, unable to deny the\r\ntruth of what Bricheteau said.\r\n\r\nOn being questioned, the doctor replied that he had just seen symptoms\r\nin the patient which threatened another paroxysm.\r\n\r\n“But,” cried Sallenauve, eagerly, “you are not losing hope of a cure,\r\nare you, doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Far from that. I have perfect faith in the ultimate termination of the\r\ncase; but I see more delay in reaching it than at first I expected,”\r\n replied the doctor.\r\n\r\n“I have recently been elected to our Chamber of deputies,” said\r\nSallenauve, “and I ought to be in my seat at the opening of the session;\r\nin fact, my interests are seriously concerned, and my friend Monsieur\r\nBricheteau has come over to fetch me. If therefore I can be sure that my\r\npresence here is not essential--”\r\n\r\n“By all means go,” said the doctor. “It may be a long time before I\r\ncould allow you to see the patient; therefore you can leave without\r\nthe slightest self-reproach. In fact, you can really do nothing here at\r\npresent. Trust him to Lord Lewin and me; I assure you that I shall make\r\nhis recovery, of which I have no doubt, a matter of personal pride and\r\nself-love.”\r\n\r\nSallenauve pressed the doctor’s hand gratefully, and started for London\r\nwithout delay. Arriving there at five o’clock, the travellers were\r\nunable to leave before midnight; meantime their eyes were struck at\r\nevery turn by those enormous posters which English _puffism_ alone\r\nis able to produce, announcing the second appearance in Her Majesty’s\r\ntheatre of the Signora Luigia. The name alone was enough to attract\r\nthe attention of both travellers; but the newspapers to which they had\r\nrecourse for further information furnished, as is customary in England,\r\nso many circumstantial details about the prima donna that Sallenauve\r\ncould no longer doubt the transformation of his late housekeeper into an\r\noperatic star of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nGoing to the box-office, which he found closed, every seat having been\r\nsold before mid-day, Sallenauve considered himself lucky to obtain two\r\nseats from a speculator, at the enormous cost of five pounds apiece.\r\nThe opera was “La Pazza d’Amore” of Paesiello. When the curtain rose,\r\nSallenauve, who had spent the last two weeks at Hanwell, among the\r\ninsane, could all the more appreciate the remarkable dramatic talent his\r\nlate housekeeper displayed in the part of Nina. Even Bricheteau, though\r\nannoyed at Sallenauve’s determination to be present, was so carried\r\naway by the power of the singer that he said to his companion rather\r\nimprudently,--\r\n\r\n“Politics have no triumphs as that. Art alone is deity--”\r\n\r\n“And Luigia is its prophet!” added Sallenauve.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, had the Italian opera-house in London presented a more\r\nbrilliant sight; the whole audience was in a transport of enthusiasm,\r\nand bouquets fairly rained upon the stage.\r\n\r\nAs they left the theatre, Bricheteau looked at his watch; it was a\r\nquarter to eleven; they had thus ample time to take the steamer leaving,\r\nas the tide served, at midnight. But when the organist turned to make\r\nthis remark to Sallenauve, who was behind him, he saw nothing of his\r\nman; the deputy had vanished!\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the maid of the Signora Luigia entered her mistress’s\r\ndressing-room, which was filled with distinguished Englishmen presented\r\nby Sir Francis Drake to the new star, and gave her a card. On reading\r\nthe name the prima donna turned pale and whispered a few words to the\r\nwaiting-woman; then she seemed so anxious to be rid of the crowd who\r\nwere pressing round her that her budding adorers were inclined to be\r\nangry. But a great singer has rare privileges, and the fatigue of the\r\npart into which the _diva_ had just put so much soul seemed so good\r\nan excuse for her sulkiness that her court dispersed without much\r\nmurmuring.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, the signora rapidly resumed her usual dress, and the\r\ndirectors’ carriage took her back to the hotel where she had stayed\r\nsince arriving in London. On entering her salon she found Sallenauve,\r\nwho had preceded her.\r\n\r\n“You in London, monsieur!” she said; “it is like a dream!”\r\n\r\n“Especially to me,” replied Sallenauve, “who find you here, after\r\nsearching hopelessly for you in Paris--”\r\n\r\n“Did you take that pains?--why?”\r\n\r\n“You left me in so strange a manner, and your nature is so rash,\r\nyou knew so little of Paris, and so many dangers might threaten your\r\ninexperience, that I feared for you.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose harm did happen to me; I was neither your wife, nor your\r\nsister, nor your mistress; I was only your--”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said Sallenauve, hastily, “that you were my friend.”\r\n\r\n“I was--under obligation to you,” she replied. “I saw that I was\r\nbecoming an embarrassment in your new situation. What else could I do\r\nbut release you from it?”\r\n\r\n“Who told you that you were an embarrassment to me? Have I ever said\r\nor intimated anything of the kind? Could I not speak to you, as I\r\ndid, about your professional life without wounding so deeply your\r\nsensibility?”\r\n\r\n“People feel things as they feel them,” replied Luigia. “I had the\r\ninward consciousness that you would rather I were out of your house than\r\nin it. My future you had already given me the means to secure; you see\r\nfor yourself it is opening in a manner that ought to reassure you.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me so brilliant that I hope you will not think me\r\nindiscreet if I ask whose hand, more fortunate than mine, has produced\r\nthis happy result.”\r\n\r\n“That of a great Swedish nobleman,” replied Luigia, without hesitation.\r\n“Or rather, I should say, as the friend of a lady who took an interest\r\nin me, he procured me an engagement at Her Majesty’s Theatre; the kind\r\nencouragement of the public has done the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Say, rather, your own talent; I was present at the performance this\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\nMaking him a coquettish courtesy, Luigia said,--\r\n\r\n“I hope you were satisfied with your humble servant.”\r\n\r\n“Your musical powers did not surprise me, for those I knew already; but\r\nthose transports of dramatic passion, your powerful acting, so sure of\r\nitself, did certainly astonish me.”\r\n\r\n“It comes from having suffered much,” replied Luigia; “suffering is a\r\ngreat teacher.”\r\n\r\n“Suffered? Yes, I know you did, in Italy. But I have liked to feel that\r\nafter your arrival in France--”\r\n\r\n“Always; I have always suffered,” she said in a voice of emotion. “I was\r\nnot born under a happy star.”\r\n\r\n“That ‘always’ seems like a reproach to me,” said Sallenauve, “and yet I\r\ndo not know what wrong I can have done you.”\r\n\r\n“You have done me no wrong; the harm was there!” she cried, striking her\r\nbreast,--“within me!”\r\n\r\n“Probably some foolish fancy, such as that of leaving my house suddenly,\r\nbecause your mistaken sense of honor made you think yourself in my way.”\r\n\r\n“Not mistaken,” she replied. “I know what was in your thoughts. If only\r\non account of what you had done for me, I knew I could never aspire to\r\nyour esteem.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Luigia, I call such ideas absurd. Have I ever shown you\r\nany want of consideration? How could I? Your conduct has always been\r\nexemplary.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I tried to do everything that would give you a good opinion of me;\r\nbut I was none the less the widow of Benedetto.”\r\n\r\n“What! can you suppose that that misfortune, the result of a just\r\nvengeance--”\r\n\r\n“Ah! no, it is not the death of that man that lowered me in your eyes;\r\non the contrary. But I had been the wife of a buffoon, of a police-spy,\r\nof a base man, ready to sell me to any one who would give him money.”\r\n\r\n“As long as that situation lasted, I thought you deeply to be pitied;\r\nbut despised, never!”\r\n\r\n“And,” continued the Italian, more excitedly, “we had lived two years\r\nunder the same roof, you and I alone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I found my comfort in it.”\r\n\r\n“Did you think me ugly?”\r\n\r\n“You know better than that, for I made my finest statue from you.”\r\n\r\n“Foolish?”\r\n\r\n“No one was ever foolish who could act such a part as you did to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must see that you despised me.”\r\n\r\nSallenauve seemed wholly surprised by this deduction; he thought himself\r\nvery clever in replying,--\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that if I had behaved to you in any other manner you\r\nwould have the right to say that I despised you.”\r\n\r\nBut he had to do with a woman who in everything, in her friendships, her\r\nhatreds, her actions, as in her words, went straight to her point. As if\r\nshe feared not to be fully understood, she went on:--\r\n\r\n“To-day, monsieur, I can tell you all, for I speak of the past; the\r\nfuture has opened before me, as you see. From the day you were good to\r\nme and by your generous protection I escaped an infamous outrage, my\r\nheart has been wholly yours.”\r\n\r\nSallenauve, who had never suspected that feeling, and, above all, was\r\nunable to understand how so artlessly crude an avowal of it could be\r\nmade, knew not what to answer.\r\n\r\n“I am not ignorant,” continued the strange woman, “that I should have\r\ndifficulty in rising from the degradation in which I appeared to you at\r\nour first meeting. If, at the time you consented to take me with you to\r\nParis, I had seen you incline to treat me with gallantry, had you shown\r\nany sign of turning to your profit the dangerous situation in which I\r\nhad placed myself, my heart would instantly have retired; you would have\r\nseemed to me an ordinary man--”\r\n\r\n“So,” remarked Sallenauve, “to love you would have been insulting; not\r\nto love you was cruel! What sort of woman are you, that either way you\r\nare displeased?”\r\n\r\n“You ought not to have loved me,” she replied, “while the mud was still\r\non my skirts and you scarcely knew me; because then your love would have\r\nbeen the love of the eyes and not of the soul. But when, after two years\r\npassed beside you, you had seen by my conduct that I was an honorable\r\nwoman; when, without ever accepting a pleasure, I devoted myself to the\r\ncare of the house and your comfort without other relaxation than the\r\nstudy of my art; and when, above all, I sacrificed to you that modesty\r\nyou had seen me defend with such energy,--then you were cruel not to\r\ncomprehend, and never, never will your imagination tell you what I have\r\nsuffered, and all the tears you have made me shed.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Luigia, I was your host, and even had I suspected what you\r\nnow reveal to me, my duty as an honorable man would have commanded me to\r\nsee nothing of it, and to take no advantage of you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is not the reason; it is simpler than that. You saw nothing\r\nbecause your fancy turned elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and if it were so?”\r\n\r\n“It ought not to be so,” replied Luigia, vehemently. “That woman is not\r\nfree; she has a husband and children, and though you did make a saint of\r\nher, I presume to say, ridiculous as it may seem, that she is not worth\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nSallenauve could not help smiling, but he answered very seriously,--\r\n\r\n“You are totally mistaken as to your rival. Madame de l’Estorade was\r\nnever anything to me but a model, without other value than the fact that\r\nshe resembled another woman. That one I knew in Rome before I knew you.\r\nShe had beauty, youth, and a glorious inclination for art. To-day she\r\nis confined in a convent; like you, she has paid her tribute to sorrow;\r\ntherefore, you see--”\r\n\r\n“What, three hearts devoted to you,” cried Luigia, “and not one\r\naccepted? A strange star is yours! No doubt I suffer from its fatal\r\ninfluence, and therefore I must pardon you.”\r\n\r\n“You are good to be merciful; will you now let me ask you a question?\r\nJust now you spoke of your future, and I see it with my own eyes. Who\r\nare the friends who have suddenly advanced you so far and so splendidly\r\nin your career? Have you made any compact with the devil?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Luigia, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Don’t laugh,” said Sallenauve; “you chose to rush alone and unprotected\r\ninto that hell called Paris, and I dread lest you have made some fatal\r\nacquaintance. I know the immense difficulties and the immense dangers\r\nthat a woman placed as you are now must meet. Who is this lady that you\r\nspoke of? and how did you ever meet her while living under my roof?”\r\n\r\n“She is a pious and charitable woman, who came to see me during your\r\nabsence at Arcis. She had noticed my voice at Saint-Sulpice, during the\r\nservices of the Month of Mary, and she tried to entice me away to her\r\nown parish church of Notre-Dame de Lorette,--it was for that she came to\r\nsee me.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me her name.”\r\n\r\n“Madame de Saint-Esteve.”\r\n\r\nThough far from penetrating the many mysteries that surrounded\r\nJacqueline Collin, Sallenauve knew Madame de Saint-Esteve to be a woman\r\nof doubtful character and a matrimonial agent, having at times heard\r\nBixiou tell tales of her.\r\n\r\n“But that woman,” he said, “has a shocking notoriety in Paris. She is an\r\nadventuress of the worst kind.”\r\n\r\n“I suspected it,” said Luigia. “But what of that?”\r\n\r\n“And the man to whom she introduced you?”\r\n\r\n“He an adventurer? No, I think not. At any rate, he did me a great\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“But he may have designs upon you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, people may have designs upon me,” replied Luigia, with dignity,\r\n“but they cannot execute them: between those designs and me, there is\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“But your reputation?”\r\n\r\n“That was lost before I left your house. I was said to be your mistress;\r\nyou had yourself to contradict that charge before the electoral college;\r\nyou contradicted it, but you could not stop it.”\r\n\r\n“And my esteem, for which you profess to care?”\r\n\r\n“I no longer want it. You did not love me when I wished for it; you\r\nshall not love me now that I no longer wish it.”\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” exclaimed Sallenauve.\r\n\r\n“There are two reasons why it cannot be,” said the singer. “In the first\r\nplace, it is too late; and in the second, we are no longer on the same\r\npath.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that?”\r\n\r\n“I am an artist and you have ceased to be one. I rise; you fall.”\r\n\r\n“Do you call it falling to rise, perhaps, to the highest dignities of\r\nthe State?”\r\n\r\n“To whatever height you rise,” said Luigia, passionately, “you will ever\r\nbe below your past and the noble future that was once before you--Ah!\r\nstay; I think that I have lied to you; had you remained a sculptor, I\r\nbelieve I should have borne still longer your coldness and your disdain;\r\nI should have waited until I entered my vocation, until the halo round\r\na singer’s head might have shown you, at last, that I was there beside\r\nyou. But on the day that you apostatized I would no longer continue my\r\nhumiliating sacrifice. There is no future possible between us.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” said Sallenauve, holding out his hand, which she did not\r\ntake, “that we cannot even be friends?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied; “all is over--past and gone. We shall hear of each\r\nother; and from afar, as we pass in life, we can wave our hands in\r\nrecognition, but nothing further.”\r\n\r\n“So,” said Sallenauve, sadly, “this is how it all ends!”\r\n\r\nLa Luigia looked at him a moment, her eyes shining with tears.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” she said in a resolute and sincere tone: “this is possible.\r\nI have loved you, and after you, no one can enter the heart you have\r\ndespised. You will hear that I have lovers; believe it not; you will not\r\nbelieve it, remembering the woman that I am. But who knows? Later your\r\nlife may be swept clean of the other sentiments that have stood in my\r\nway; the freedom, the strangeness of the avowal I have just made to you\r\nwill remain in your memory, and then it is not impossible that\r\nafter this long rejection you may end by desiring me. If that should\r\nhappen,--if at the end of many sad deceptions you should return, in\r\nsheer remorse, to the religion of art,--then, then, supposing that long\r\nyears have not made love ridiculous between us, remember this evening.\r\nNow, let us part; it is already too late for a _tete-a-tete_.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, she took a light and passed into an inner room, leaving\r\nSallenauve in a state of mind we can readily imagine after the various\r\nshocks and surprises of this interview.\r\n\r\nOn returning to his hotel he found Jacques Bricheteau awaiting him.\r\n\r\n“Where the devil have you been?” cried the organist, impatiently. “It is\r\ntoo late now to take the steamboat.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sallenauve, carelessly, “then I shall have a few hours\r\nlonger to play truant.”\r\n\r\n“But during that time your enemies are tunnelling their mine.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care. In that cave called political life one has to be ready\r\nfor anything.”\r\n\r\n“I thought as much!” exclaimed Bricheteau. “You have been to see Luigia;\r\nher success has turned your head, and the deputy is thinking of his\r\nstatues.”\r\n\r\n“How often have I heard you say yourself that Art alone is great?”\r\n\r\n“But an orator,” replied Bricheteau, “is also an artist, and the\r\ngreatest of all. Others speak to the heart and the mind, but he to the\r\nconscience and the will of others. At any rate, this is no time to look\r\nback; you are engaged in a duel with your adversaries. Are you an honest\r\nman, or a scoundrel who has stolen a name? There is the question which\r\nmay, in consequence of your absence, be answered against you in the\r\nChamber.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to feel that you have led me into a mistaken path; I had in my\r\nhands a treasure, and I have flung it away!”\r\n\r\n“Happily,” said the organist, “that’s only an evening mist which the\r\nnight will dissipate. To-morrow you will remember the engagement you are\r\nunder to your father, and the great future which is before you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. IN THE CHAMBER\r\n\r\nThe king had opened the Chamber, but Sallenauve was not present, and\r\nhis absence was causing a certain sensation in the democratic ranks. The\r\n“National” was particularly disturbed. As a stockholder of the paper,\r\ncoming frequently to its office before the election, and even consenting\r\nto write articles for it, how strange that on the eve of the opening of\r\nthe session the newly elected deputy should not come near it!\r\n\r\n“Now that he is elected,” said some of the editorial staff, remarking\r\non the total disappearance of the man whom they considered they had done\r\ntheir part to elect, “does monsieur think he can treat us scurvily?\r\nIt is getting too much the habit of these lordly deputies to be very\r\nobsequious as long as they are candidates, and throw us away, after they\r\nhave climbed the tree, like an old coat.”\r\n\r\nLess excitable, the editor-in-chief calmed this first ebullition, but\r\nSallenauve’s absence from the royal session seemed to him very strange.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when the bureaus are constituted, presidents and\r\nsecretaries appointed, and committees named, Sallenauve’s absence\r\nwas still more marked. In the bureau for which his name was drawn,\r\nit happened that the election of its president depended on one vote;\r\nthrough the absence of the deputy of Arcis, the ministry gained that\r\nadvantage and the Opposition lost it. Much discontent was expressed by\r\nthe newspapers of the latter party; they did not, as yet, openly attack\r\nthe conduct of the defaulter, but they declared that they could not\r\naccount for it.\r\n\r\nMaxime de Trailles, on the other hand, fully prepared and on the watch,\r\nwas waiting only until the routine business of the bureaus and the\r\nappointment of the committees was disposed of to send in the petition of\r\nthe Romilly peasant-woman, which had been carefully drawn up by Massol,\r\nunder whose clever pen the facts he was employed to make the most\r\nof assumed that degree of probability which barristers contrive to\r\ncommunicate to their sayings and affirmations. But when Maxime had\r\nthe joy of seeing that Sallenauve’s absence in itself was creating a\r\nprejudice against him, he went again to Rastignac and asked him if he\r\ndid not think it better to hasten the moment of attack, since everything\r\nseemed so favorable.\r\n\r\nThis time Rastignac was much more explicit: Sallenauve’s absence abroad\r\nseemed to him the conduct of a man who feared exposure and had lost his\r\nhead. He therefore advised de Trailles to have the petition sent in\r\nat once, and he made no difficulty about promising his assistance to a\r\nconspiracy which appeared to be taking color, the result of which must\r\nbe, in any case, a very pretty scandal. The next day the first trace\r\nof his subterranean influence was visible. The order of the day in the\r\nChamber was the verification of powers,--that is, the admission of newly\r\nelected members. The deputy appointed to report on the elections in the\r\ndepartment of the Aube was a strong partisan of the ministry, and, in\r\nconsequence of a confidential communication made to him that morning,\r\nthe following paragraph appeared in his report:--\r\n\r\n  The action of the electoral college of Arcis was regular. Monsieur\r\n  de Sallenauve produced in proper time all the necessary papers\r\n  proving his eligibility; his admission therefore would seem to\r\n  present no difficulty. But rumors of a singular nature have been\r\n  current since the election as to the name and identity of the new\r\n  deputy; and, in support of these rumors, a petition to authorize a\r\n  criminal prosecution has been laid before the president of the\r\n  Chamber. This petition states an extremely serious fact, namely:\r\n  that Monsieur de Sallenauve has usurped the name he bears; and\r\n  this usurpation, being made by means of an official document,\r\n  assumes the character of forgery committed by substitution of\r\n  person. A most regrettable circumstance,\r\n\r\ncontinued the report,\r\n\r\n  is the absence of Monsieur de Sallenauve, who instead of instantly\r\n  contradicting the accusation made against him, has not appeared\r\n  since the opening of the Chamber at any of its sessions, and it is\r\n  not even known where he is. Under these circumstances, his\r\n  admission, the committee think, cannot be granted; and they feel\r\n  it therefore their duty to refer the matter to the Chamber.\r\n\r\nDaniel d’Arthez, a deputy of the legitimist opposition, who had been\r\nfavorable to the election of Sallenauve, hastened, after the reading of\r\nthis report, to ask for the floor, and entreated the Chamber to remark\r\nthat its adoption would be wholly unjustifiable.\r\n\r\n“The point for the committee to decide,” he said, “was the regularity\r\nof the election. The report distinctly states that this is not called in\r\nquestion. The Chamber can, therefore, do only one thing; namely,\r\nadmit by an immediate vote the validity of an election about which\r\nno irregularity is alleged. To bring in the question of authorizing\r\na criminal investigation would be an abuse of power; because by not\r\nallowing discussion or defence, and by dispensing with the usual forms\r\nof procedure which guarantee certain rights to a party implicated, the\r\nChamber would be virtually rejecting the action of the electors in the\r\nexercise of their sovereign functions. Every one can see, moreover,”\r\n added the orator, “that to grant the right of criminal investigation in\r\nthis connection is to prejudge the merits of the case; the presumption\r\nof innocence, which is the right of every man, is ignored--whereas in\r\nthis case the person concerned is a man whose integrity has never been\r\ndoubted, and who has just been openly honored by the suffrages of his\r\nfellow citizens.”\r\n\r\nThe discussion was prolonged for some time, the ministerial orators, of\r\ncourse, taking the other side, until an unfortunate event occurred.\r\nThe senior deputy, acting as president (for the Chamber was not yet\r\nconstituted), was a worn-out old man, very absent-minded, and wholly\r\nunaccustomed to the functions which his age devolved upon him. He\r\nhad duly received Monsieur de Sallenauve’s letter requesting leave of\r\nabsence; and had he recollected to communicate it, as in duty bound, to\r\nthe Chamber at the proper time, the discussion would probably have been\r\nnipped in the bud. But parliamentary matters are apt to go haphazard;\r\nwhen, reminded of the letter by the discussion, he produced it, and when\r\nthe Chamber learned that the request for leave of absence was made for\r\nan indefinite period and for the vague purpose of “urgent affairs,” the\r\neffect was lamentable.\r\n\r\n“It is plain,” said all the ministerial party, “that he has gone to\r\nEngland to escape an investigation; he feared the result; he feels\r\nhimself unmasked.”\r\n\r\nThis view, setting aside political prejudices, was shared by the sterner\r\nminds of all parties, who refused to conceive of a man not hastening to\r\ndefend himself from such a blasting accusation. In short, after a very\r\nkeen and able argument from the attorney-general, Vinet, who had taken\r\nheart on finding that the accused was likely to be condemned by default,\r\nthe question of adjournment was put to the vote and passed, but by a\r\nvery small majority; eight days being granted to the said deputy to\r\nappear and defend himself.\r\n\r\nThe day after the vote was passed Maxime de Trailles wrote to Madame\r\nBeauvisage as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Madame,--The enemy received a severe check yesterday. In the\r\n  opinion of my friend Rastignac, a very intelligent and experienced\r\n  judge in parliamentary matters, Dorlange can never recover from\r\n  the blow, no matter what may happen later. If we cannot succeed in\r\n  producing positive proof to support the statement of our good\r\n  peasant-woman, it is possible that this rascal, supposing always\r\n  that he ventures to return to France, may be admitted to the\r\n  Chamber. But if he is, he can only drag on a despised and\r\n  miserable existence; he will be driven to resign, and then the\r\n  election of Monsieur Beauvisage is beyond all doubt; for the\r\n  electors, ashamed to have forsaken him for such a rascal, will be\r\n  only too glad to reinstate themselves in public opinion by the\r\n  choice of an honorable man--who was, in fact, their first choice.\r\n\r\n  It is to your rare sagacity, madame, that this result is due; for\r\n  without that species of second sight which showed you the chances\r\n  hidden in the revelation of that woman, we should have missed our\r\n  best weapon. I must tell you though you may think this vanity,\r\n  that neither Rastignac nor the attorney-general, in spite of their\r\n  great political acumen, perceived the true value of your\r\n  discovery; and I myself, if I had not had the good fortune of your\r\n  acquaintance, and thus been enabled to judge of the great value of\r\n  all ideas emanating from you, even I might have shared the\r\n  indifference of the two statesmen to the admirable weapon which\r\n  you have placed in our hands. I have now succeeded in proving to\r\n  Rastignac the shrewdness and perspicacity you have shown in this\r\n  matter, and he sincerely admires you for them. Therefore, madame,\r\n  when I have the happiness of belonging to you by the tie we\r\n  proposed, I shall not have to initiate you into politics, for you\r\n  have already found your way there.\r\n\r\n  Nothing further can take place for a week, which is the period of\r\n  delay granted by the Chamber. If the defaulter does not then\r\n  appear, I am confident his election will be annulled. You can\r\n  easily believe that between now and then all my efforts will be\r\n  given to increase the feeling in the Chamber against him, both by\r\n  arguments in the press and by private conversations. Rastignac has\r\n  also given orders among the ministerial adherents to that effect.\r\n  We may feel confident, therefore, that by the end of another week\r\n  our enemy will find public opinion solidly against him.\r\n\r\n  Will you permit me, madame, to recall myself to the memory of\r\n  Mademoiselle Cecile, and accept yourself, together with Monsieur\r\n  Beauvisage, the assurance of my most respectful sentiments.\r\n\r\nA hint from certain quarters given to the ministerial journals now\r\nbegan to surround Sallenauve’s name with an atmosphere of disrespect and\r\nridicule; insulting insinuations colored his absence with an appearance\r\nof escaping the charges. The effect of these attacks was all the\r\ngreater because Sallenauve was very weakly defended by his political\r\nco-religionists, which was scarcely surprising. Not knowing how to\r\nexplain his conduct, the Opposition papers were afraid to commit\r\nthemselves in favor of a man whose future was daily becoming more\r\nnebulous.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before the day on which the time granted for an\r\nexplanation would expire, Sallenauve being still absent, a ministerial\r\npaper published, under the heading of “A Lost Deputy,” a very witty\r\nand insolent article, which was read by every one and created a great\r\nsensation. During that evening Madame de l’Estorade went to see Madame\r\nde Camps, whom she found alone with her husband. She was greatly\r\nagitated, and said, as soon as she entered the room,--\r\n\r\n“Have you read that infamous article?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Madame Octave, “but Monsieur de Camps was just telling\r\nme about it. It is really shameful that the ministry should not only\r\ncountenance, but instigate such villanies.”\r\n\r\n“I am half crazy,” said Madame de l’Estorade; “the whole blame rests on\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“That is saying too much,” said Madame Octave.\r\n\r\n“No,” said her husband, “I agree with madame; all the venom of this\r\naffair could have been destroyed by one action of de l’Estorade’s, and\r\nin refusing to make it he is, if not the author, at least the accomplice\r\nof this slander.”\r\n\r\n“Your wife has told you--” began Madame de l’Estorade in a reproachful\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Madame de Camps; “it was necessary to explain to my husband\r\nthe sort of madness that seemed to have taken possession of M. de\r\nl’Estorade; but what I said to him was not unfaithful to any secret that\r\nconcerned you personally.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you are such a united pair,” said Madame de l’Estorade, with a\r\nheavy sigh. “I don’t regret that you have told all that to your husband;\r\nin fact, two heads are better than one to advise me in the cruel\r\nposition in which I am placed.”\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” asked Madame de Camps.\r\n\r\n“My husband is losing his head,” replied the countess. “I don’t see a\r\ntrace of his old moral sense left in him. Far from understanding that he\r\nis, as Monsieur de Camps said just now, the accomplice of the shameful\r\nattack which is going on, and that he has not, like those who started\r\nit, the excuse of ignorance, he actually seems to take delight in this\r\nwickedness. Just now he brought me that vile paper triumphantly, and\r\nI could scarcely prevent his being very angry with me for not agreeing\r\nwith his opinion that it was infinitely witty and amusing.”\r\n\r\n“That letter of Monsieur Gaston’s was a terrible shock to him,” said\r\nMadame de Camps,--“a shock not only to his heart but to his body.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that,” said her husband; “but, hang it! a man is a man, and he\r\nought to take the words of a maniac for what they are worth.”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly very singular that Monsieur de Sallenauve does not\r\nreturn,” said Madame Octave; “for that Joseph Bricheteau, to whom you\r\ngave his address, must have written to him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried the countess, “there’s fatality in the whole thing.\r\nTo-morrow the question of confirming the election or not comes up in\r\nthe Chamber; and if Monsieur de Sallenauve is not here by that time, the\r\nministry expects to annul it.”\r\n\r\n“It is infamous,” said Monsieur de Camps, “and I have a great mind to go\r\nto the president of the Chamber, and tell him how matters are.”\r\n\r\n“I would have asked you to do so at the risk of my husband suspecting\r\nmy interference, but one thing restrained me. Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\nparticularly desires that Monsieur Gaston’s mental condition be not made\r\npublic.”\r\n\r\n“It is evident,” said Madame de Camps, “that do defend him in any way\r\nwould go against his wishes. After all, the decision against him in\r\nthe Chamber is very doubtful, whereas Monsieur Gaston’s madness, if\r\nmentioned publicly, would never be forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“But I have not told you the worst so far as I am concerned,” said\r\nMadame de l’Estorade. “Just before dinner my husband imparted to me an\r\nabsolutely Satanic desire of his--order, I might call it.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” asked Madame de Camps, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“He wishes me to go with him to the Chamber to-morrow,--to the gallery\r\nreserved for the peers of France,--and listen to the discussion.”\r\n\r\n“He is actually, as you say, losing his head,” cried Monsieur de Camps;\r\n“he is like Thomas Diafoirus, proposing to take his fiance to enjoy a\r\ndissection--”\r\n\r\nMadame de Camps made her husband a sign which meant, “Don’t pour oil on\r\nthe fire.” Then she asked the countess whether she had tried to show M.\r\nde l’Estorade the impropriety of that step.\r\n\r\n“The moment I began to object,” replied the countess, “he was angry, and\r\nsaid I must be very anxious to keep up our intimacy with ‘that man’\r\nwhen I rejected such a natural opportunity to show publicly that the\r\nacquaintance was at an end.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, you will have to go,” said Madame de Camps. “The peace\r\nof your home before everything else! Besides, considering all things,\r\nyour presence at the discussion may be taken as a proof of kindly\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\n“For sixteen years,” remarked Monsieur de Camps, “you have ruled and\r\ngoverned in your home; and here, at last, is a revolution which cruelly\r\noverturns your power.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, monsieur, I beg you to believe that that sovereignty--which I\r\nalways sought to conceal--I never used arbitrarily.”\r\n\r\n“As if I did not know that!” replied Monsieur de Camps, taking Madame de\r\nl’Estorade’s hand and pressing it affectionately. “I am, nevertheless,\r\nof my wife’s opinion: you will have to drink this cup.”\r\n\r\n“But I shall die of shame in listening to the ministerial infamies; I\r\nshall feel that they are cutting the throat of a man whom two words from\r\nme could save.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Monsieur de Camps, “and a man, too, who has done you a\r\nvast service. But you must choose: do you prefer to bring hell into your\r\nhome, and exasperate the unhealthy condition of your husband’s mind?”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, dearest,” said Madame de Camps. “Tell Monsieur de\r\nl’Estorade that I want to go to this session, and ask him for a permit;\r\ndon’t yield the point to any objections. I shall then be there to take\r\ncare of you, and perhaps protect you from yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I did not dare ask it of you,” replied Madame de l’Estorade. “We don’t\r\nusually invite friends to see us commit bad actions; but since you are\r\nso kind as to offer, I can truly say I shall be less wretched if you are\r\nwith me. Now good-bye; I don’t want my husband to find me out when he\r\ncomes home. He is dining with Monsieur de Rastignac, where, no doubt,\r\nthey are plotting for to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, go; and I will write you a note in the course of an hour, as if I\r\nhad not seen you, asking you to get me a permit for to-morrow’s session,\r\nwhich I am told will be very interesting.”\r\n\r\n“To be reduced to conspiracy!” cried Madame de l’Estorade, kissing her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“My dear love,” said Madame de Camps, “they say the life of a Christian\r\nis a struggle, but that of a woman married in a certain way is a pitched\r\nbattle. Have patience and courage.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the two friends separated.\r\n\r\nThe next day, about two o’clock, Madame de l’Estorade, accompanied by\r\nher husband and Madame Octave de Camps, took their places in the gallery\r\nreserved for the members of the peerage. She seemed ill, and answered\r\nlanguidly the bows and salutations that were addressed to her from all\r\nparts of the Chamber. Madame de Camps, who was present for the first\r\ntime in the parliamentary precincts, made two observations: first,\r\nshe objected strongly to the slovenly costume of a great many of the\r\n“honorable gentlemen”; and she was also amazed at the number of bald\r\nheads she looked down upon from the gallery. Monsieur de l’Estorade took\r\npains to point out to her all the notabilities present: first, the great\r\nmen whom we need not mention, because their names are in everybody’s\r\nmemory; next, the poet Canalis, whose air she thought Olympian;\r\nd’Arthez, who pleased her by his modesty and absence of assumption;\r\nVinet, of whom she remarked that he was like a viper in spectacles;\r\nVictorin Hulot, a noted orator of the Left Centre. It was some\r\ntime before she could accustom herself to the hum of the various\r\nconversations, which seemed to her like the buzzing of bees around their\r\nhive; but the thing that most amazed her was the general aspect of this\r\nassemblage of legislators, where a singular _laisser-aller_ and a total\r\nabsence of dignity would never have led her to suppose she was in the\r\nhall of the representatives of a great people.\r\n\r\nIt was written that on this day no pain or unpleasantness should be\r\nspared to Madame de l’Estorade. Just before the sitting began, the\r\nMarquise d’Espard, accompanied by Monsieur de Ronquerolles, entered the\r\npeers’ gallery and took her seat beside the countess. Though meeting\r\nconstantly in society, the two women could not endure each other.\r\nMadame de l’Estorade despised the spirit of intrigue, the total lack of\r\nprinciple, and the sour, malevolent nature which the marquise covered\r\nwith an elegant exterior; and the marquise despised, to a still\r\ngreater degree, what she called the _pot-au-feu_ virtues of Madame de\r\nl’Estorade. It must also be mentioned that Madame de l’Estorade was\r\nthirty-two years old and her beauty was still undimmed, whereas Madame\r\nd’Espard was forty-four, and, in spite of the careful dissimulations of\r\nthe toilet, her beauty was fairly at an end.\r\n\r\n“You do not often come here, I think,” said Madame d’Espard, after the\r\nusual conventional phrases about the _pleasure_ of their meeting had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n“I never come,” replied Madame de l’Estorade.\r\n\r\n“And I am most assiduous,” said Madame d’Espard.\r\n\r\nThen, pretending to a sudden recollection, she added,--\r\n\r\n“Ah! I forgot; you have a special interest, I think, on this occasion. A\r\nfriend of yours is to be _judged_, is he not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Monsieur de Sallenauve has been to our house several times.”\r\n\r\n“How sad it is,” said the marquise, “to see a man who, Monsieur de\r\nRonquerolles tells me, had the making of a hero in many ways, come down\r\nto the level of the correctional police.”\r\n\r\n“His crime so far,” said Madame de l’Estorade, dryly, “consists solely\r\nin his absence.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” continued the marquise, “he seems to be a man eaten up\r\nby ambition. Before his parliamentary attempt, he made, as you doubtless\r\nknow, a matrimonial attempt upon the Lantys, which ended in the\r\nbeautiful heiress of that family, into whose good graces he had\r\ninsinuated himself, being sent to a convent.”\r\n\r\nMadame de l’Estorade was not much surprised at finding that this\r\nhistory, which Sallenauve had told her as very secret, had reached the\r\nknowledge of Madame d’Espard. The marquise was one of the best\r\ninformed women in Paris; her salon, as an old academician had said\r\nmythologically, was the Temple of Fame.\r\n\r\n“I think the sitting is about to begin,” said Madame de l’Estorade;\r\nfearing some blow from the claws of the marquise, she was eager to put\r\nan end to the conversation.\r\n\r\nThe president had rung his bell, the deputies were taking their seats,\r\nthe curtain was about to rise. As a faithful narrator of the session we\r\ndesire our readers to attend, we think it safer and better in every\r\nway to copy _verbatim_ the report of the debate as given in one of the\r\nmorning papers of the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\nChamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\n  In the chair, M. Cointet (vice-president).\r\n\r\n(Sitting of May 28.)\r\n\r\n  At two o’clock the president takes his seat.\r\n\r\n  M. the Keeper of the Seals, M. the minister of the Interior, M.\r\n  the minister of Public Works, are on the ministerial bench.\r\n\r\n  The minutes of the last session are read, approved, and accepted.\r\n\r\n  The order of the day is the verification of the powers and the\r\n  admission of the deputy elected by the arrondissement of\r\n  Arcis-sur-Aube.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--M. the reporter, from the Committee on the\r\n  elections of the department of the Aube, has the floor.\r\n\r\n  _The Reporter_.--Gentlemen, the singular and regrettable situation\r\n  in which Monsieur de Sallenauve has placed himself has not\r\n  terminated in the manner that was hoped and expected last week.\r\n  The period of delay expired yesterday; Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\n  continues to absent himself from your sittings, and no letter has\r\n  reached M. le president asking for further leave of absence. This\r\n  indifference to the functions which Monsieur de Sallenauve\r\n  appeared to have solicited with so much eagerness [slight\r\n  agitation on the Left] would be, in any case, a grave mistake; but\r\n  when connected with an accusation that seriously compromises the\r\n  deputy elect, it must be regarded as altogether unfortunate for\r\n  his reputation. [Murmurs on the Left. Approbation from the\r\n  Centre.] Compelled to search for the solution of a difficulty\r\n  which may be said to be without precedent in parliamentary annals,\r\n  your committee, in the adoption of suitable measures, finds itself\r\n  divided into two very distinct opinions. The minority whom I\r\n  represent--the committee consisting of but three members--thinks\r\n  that it ought to submit to you a resolution which I shall call\r\n  radical, and which has for its object the cutting short of the\r\n  difficulty by returning the question to its natural judges. Annul\r\n  _hic et nunc_ the election of Monsieur de Sallenauve, and send him\r\n  back to the voters by whom he was elected and of whom he is so\r\n  unfaithful a representative. Such is one of the solutions I have\r\n  the honor to present to you. [Agitation on the Left.] The\r\n  majority, on the contrary, are of opinion that the will of the\r\n  electors cannot be too highly respected, and that the faults of a\r\n  man honored by their confidence ought not to be discussed until\r\n  the utmost limits of forbearance and indulgence have been passed.\r\n  Consequently your committee instruct me to suggest that you grant\r\n  to Monsieur de Sallenauve a further delay of fifteen days [murmurs\r\n  from the Centre; “Very good! very good!” from the Left]; being\r\n  satisfied that if after that delay Monsieur de Sallenauve does not\r\n  present himself or give any other sign of existence, it will be\r\n  sufficient proof that he has thrown up his election, and the\r\n  Chamber need not be dragged on his account into irritating and\r\n  useless debates. [Murmurs of various kinds.]\r\n\r\n  M. le Colonel Franchessini, who during the foregoing speech was\r\n  sitting on the ministers’ bench in earnest conversation with the\r\n  minister of Public Works, here demanded the floor.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--M. de Canalis has already asked for it.\r\n\r\n  _M. de Canalis_.--Gentlemen, M. de Sallenauve is one of those bold\r\n  men who, like myself, are convinced that politics are not\r\n  forbidden fruit to any form of intellect, and that in the poet, in\r\n  the artist, as well as in the magistrate, the administrator, the\r\n  lawyer, the physician, and the property-holder, may be found the\r\n  stuff that makes a statesman. In virtue of this community of\r\n  opinion, M. de Sallenauve has my entire sympathy, and no one can\r\n  be surprised to see me mount this tribune to support the proposal\r\n  of the majority of your committee. I cannot, however, agree to\r\n  their final conclusion; and the idea of our colleague being\r\n  declared, without discussion, dismissed from this Chamber through\r\n  the single fact of his absence, prolonged without leave, is\r\n  repugnant to my reason and also to my conscience. You are told:\r\n  “The absence of M. de Sallenauve is all the more reprehensible\r\n  because he is under the odium of a serious accusation.” But\r\n  suppose this accusation is the very cause of his absence--[“Ha!\r\n  ha!” from the Centre, and laughter.] Allow me to say, gentlemen,\r\n  that I am not, perhaps, quite so artless as Messieurs the laughers\r\n  imagine. I have one blessing, at any rate: ignoble interpretations\r\n  do not come into my mind; and that M. de Sallenauve, with the\r\n  eminent position he has filled in the world of art, should seek to\r\n  enter the world of politics by means of a crime, is a supposition\r\n  which I cannot admit _a priori_. Around a birth like his two\r\n  hideous spiders called slander and intrigue have every facility to\r\n  spread their toils; and far from admitting that he has fled before\r\n  the accusation that now attacks him, I ask myself whether his\r\n  absence does not mean that he is now engaged in collecting the\r\n  elements of his defence. [Left: “Very good!” “That’s right.”\r\n   Ironical laughter in the Centre.] Under that supposition--in my\r\n  opinion most probable--so far from arraigning him in consequence\r\n  of this absence, ought we not rather to consider it as an act of\r\n  deference to the Chamber whose deliberations he did not feel\r\n  worthy to share until he found himself in a position to confound\r\n  his calumniators?\r\n\r\n  _A Voice_.--He wants leave of absence for ten years, like\r\n  Telemachus, to search for his father. [General laughter.]\r\n\r\n  _M. de Canalis_.--I did not expect so poetical an interruption;\r\n  but since the memory of the Odyssey has been thus evoked, I shall\r\n  ask the Chamber to kindly remember that Ulysses, though disguised\r\n  as a beggar and loaded with insults, was yet able to string his\r\n  bow and easily get the better of his enemies. [Violent murmurs from\r\n  the Centre.] I vote for leave of absence for fifteen days, and\r\n  that the Chamber be again consulted at the expiration of that\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  _M. le Colonel Franchessini_.--I do not know if the last speaker\r\n  intended to intimidate the Chamber, but, for my part, such\r\n  arguments have very little power upon me, and I am always ready to\r\n  send them back whence they came. [Left: “Come! come!”]\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--Colonel, no provocations!\r\n\r\n  _M. le Colonel Franchessini_.--I am, however, of the opinion of\r\n  the speaker who preceded me; I do not think that the delinquent\r\n  has fled to escape the accusation against him. Neither that\r\n  accusation, nor the effect it will produce upon your minds, nor\r\n  even the quashing of his election would be able at this moment to\r\n  occupy his mind. Do you wish to know what M. de Sallenauve is\r\n  doing in England? Then read the English papers. For the last week\r\n  they have rung with the praises of a new prima donna who has just\r\n  made her first appearance at the London opera-house. [Violent\r\n  murmurs; interruption.]\r\n\r\n  _A Voice_.--Such gossip is unworthy of this Chamber!\r\n\r\n  _M. le Colonel Franchessini_.--Gentlemen, being more accustomed to\r\n  the frankness of camps than to the reticence of these precincts, I\r\n  may perhaps have committed the impropriety of thinking aloud. The\r\n  preceding speaker said to you that he believed M. de Sallenauve\r\n  was employed in collecting his means of defence; well, I do not\r\n  say to you “I believe,” I tell you I _know_ that a rich stranger\r\n  succeed in substituting his protection for what which Phidias, our\r\n  colleague, was bestowing on his handsome model, an Italian woman\r\n  --[Fresh interruption. “Order! order!” “This is intolerable!”]\r\n\r\n  _A Voice_.--M. le president, silence the speaker!\r\n\r\n  Colonel Franchessini crosses his arms and waits till the tumult\r\n  subsides.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--I request the speaker to keep to the question.\r\n\r\n  _M. le Colonel Franchessini_.--The question! I have not left it.\r\n  But, inasmuch as the Chamber refuses to hear me, I declare that I\r\n  side with the minority of the committee. It seems to me very\r\n  proper to send M. de Sallenauve back to his electors in order to\r\n  know whether they intended to send a deputy or a lover to this\r\n  Chamber--[“Order! order!” Loud disturbance on the Left. The tumult\r\n  increases.]\r\n\r\n  M. de Canalis hurries to the tribune.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--M. le ministre of Public Works has asked for the\r\n  floor; as minister of the king he has the first right to be heard.\r\n\r\n  _M. de Rastignac_.--It has not been without remonstrance on my\r\n  part, gentlemen, that this scandal has been brought to your\r\n  notice. I endeavored, in the name of the long friendship which\r\n  unites me to Colonel Franchessini, to persuade him not to speak on\r\n  this delicate subject, lest his parliamentary inexperience,\r\n  aggravated in a measure by his witty facility of speech, should\r\n  lead him to some very regrettable indiscretion. Such, gentleman,\r\n  was the subject of the little conversation you may have seen that\r\n  he held with me on my bench before he asked for the floor; and I\r\n  myself have asked for the same privilege only in order to remove\r\n  from your minds all idea of my complicity in the great mistake he\r\n  has just, as I think, committed by condescending to the private\r\n  details he has thought fit to relate to this assembly. But as,\r\n  against my intention, and I may add against my will, I have\r\n  entered the tribune, the Chamber will permit me, perhaps,\r\n  --although no ministerial interest is here concerned,--to say a\r\n  few words. [Cries from the Centre: “Go on!” “Speak!”]\r\n\r\n  M. le ministre then went on to say that the conduct of the absent\r\n  deputy showed contempt for the Chamber; he was treating it lightly\r\n  and cavalierly. M. de Sallenauve had asked for leave of absence;\r\n  but how or where had he asked for it? From a foreign country! That\r\n  is to say, he began by taking it, and then asked for it! Did he\r\n  trouble himself, as is usual in such cases, to give a reason for\r\n  the request? No; he merely says, in his letter to your president,\r\n  that he is forced to absent himself on “urgent business,”--a very\r\n  convenient excuse, on which the Chamber might be depopulated of\r\n  half its members. But, supposing that M. de Sallenauve’s business\r\n  was really urgent, and that he thought it of a nature not to be\r\n  explained in a letter that would necessarily be made public, why\r\n  had he not written confidentially to the president, or even\r\n  requested a friend in some responsible position, whose simple word\r\n  would have sufficed, to assure the Chamber of the necessity of the\r\n  deputy’s absence without requiring any statement of private\r\n  reasons?\r\n\r\n  At this point M. de Rastignac’s remarks were interrupted by a\r\n  commotion in the corridor to the right. Several deputies left\r\n  their seats; others jumped upon the benches, apparently\r\n  endeavoring to see something. The minister, after turning to the\r\n  president, from whom he seemed to be asking an explanation, went\r\n  back to the ministerial bench, where he was immediately surrounded\r\n  by a number of the deputies of the Centre, among whom, noticeable\r\n  for the vehemence of his gestures, was M. le procureur-general\r\n  Vinet. Groups formed in the audience chamber; the sitting was, in\r\n  fact, informally suspended.\r\n\r\n  After a few moments’ delay M. le president rings his bell.\r\n\r\n  _The Ushers_.--Take your seats, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  The deputies hasten on all sides to do so.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--M. de Sallenauve has the floor.\r\n\r\n  M. de Sallenauve, who, during the few moments that the sitting was\r\n  interrupted by his entrance, has been talking with M. de Canalis\r\n  and M. d’Arthez, goes to the tribune. His manner is modest, but he\r\n  shows no sign of embarrassment. Every one is struck by his\r\n  resemblance to the portraits of one of the most fiery of the\r\n  revolutionary orators.\r\n\r\n  _A Voice_.--It is Danton--without the small-pox!\r\n\r\n  _M. de Sallenauve_.--[Profound silence.] Gentlemen, I do not\r\n  misjudge my parliamentary value; I know that the persecution\r\n  directed apparently against me personally is, in point of fact,\r\n  aimed at the political opinions I have the honor to represent.\r\n  But, however that may be, my election seems to have been viewed by\r\n  the ministry as a matter of some importance. In order to oppose\r\n  it, a special agent and special journalists were sent to Arcis;\r\n  and a humble employe under government, with a salary of fifteen\r\n  hundred francs, was dismissed, after twenty years of faithful and\r\n  honorable service, for having aided in my success. [Loud murmurs\r\n  from the Centre.] I thank my honorable interrupters, feeling sure\r\n  that their loud disapprobation is given to this strange dismissal,\r\n  which is not open to the slightest doubt. [Laughter on the Left.]\r\n  As for me, gentlemen, who could not be dismissed, I have been\r\n  attacked with another weapon,--sagacious calumny, combined with my\r\n  fortunate absence--\r\n\r\n  _The Minister of Public Works_.--Of course the government sent you\r\n  out of the country.\r\n\r\n  _M. de Sallenauve_.--No, Monsieur le ministre. I do not attribute\r\n  my absence to either your influence or your suggestions; it was\r\n  necessitated by imperious duty, and it had no other instigation or\r\n  motive. But, as to the part you have really taken in the\r\n  denunciation set on foot against me, I am about to tell the facts,\r\n  and the Chamber will consider them. [Close attention.] The law, in\r\n  order to protect the independence of the deputy, directs that no\r\n  criminal prosecution can be begun against a member of the national\r\n  representation without the preliminary consent of the Chamber;\r\n  this fact has been turned with great adroitness against me. If the\r\n  complaint had been laid before the magistrates, it could not have\r\n  been admitted even for an instant; it is simply a bare charge, not\r\n  supported by evidence of any kind; and I have never heard that the\r\n  public authorities are in the habit of prosecuting citizens on the\r\n  mere allegation of the first-comer. We must therefore admire the\r\n  subtlety of mind which instantly perceived that, by petitioning\r\n  you for leave to prosecute, all the benefits of the accusation,\r\n  politically speaking, would be obtained without encountering the\r\n  difficulty I have mentioned in the courts. [Excitement.] Now, to\r\n  what able parliamentary tactician must we ascribe the honor of\r\n  this invention? You know already, gentleman, that it is due\r\n  ostensibly to a woman, a peasant-woman, one who labors for her\r\n  living; hence the conclusion is that the peasant-women of\r\n  Champagne have an intellectual superiority of which, up to this\r\n  time, neither you nor I were at all aware. [Laughter.] It must be\r\n  said, however, that before coming to Paris to lodge her complaint,\r\n  this woman had an interview with the mayor of Arcis, my opponent\r\n  on the ministerial side in the late election. From this conference\r\n  she obtained certain lights. To which we must add that the mayor,\r\n  taking apparently much interest in the charge to be brought\r\n  against me, agreed to pay the costs, not only of the\r\n  peasant-woman’s trip to Paris, but also those of the village\r\n  practitioner by whom she was accompanied. [Left: “Ha! ha!”] This\r\n  superior woman having arrived in Paris, with whom did she\r\n  immediately communicate? With the special agent sent down to Arcis\r\n  by the government to ensure the success of the ministerial\r\n  candidate. And who drew up the petition to this honorable Chamber\r\n  for the necessary authority to proceed to a criminal prosecution?\r\n  Not precisely the special ministerial agent himself, but a\r\n  barrister under his dictation, and after a breakfast to which the\r\n  peasant-woman and her adviser were invited in order to furnish the\r\n  necessary information. [Much excitement. “Hear! hear!”]\r\n\r\n  _The Minister of Public Works from his seat_.--Without discussing\r\n  the truth of these statements, as to which I have personally no\r\n  knowledge, I affirm upon my honor that the government is\r\n  completely ignorant of the proceedings now related, which it\r\n  blames and disavows in the most conclusive manner.\r\n\r\n  _M. de Sallenauve_.--After the formal declaration which I have had\r\n  the good fortune to evoke it would ill become me, gentlemen, to\r\n  insist on tracing the responsibility for this intrigue back to the\r\n  government. But what I have already said will seem to you natural\r\n  when you remember that, as I entered this hall, the minister of\r\n  Public Works was in the tribune, taking part, in a most unusual\r\n  manner, in a discussion on discipline wholly outside of his\r\n  department, and endeavoring to persuade you that I had conducted\r\n  myself towards this honorable body with a total want of reverence.\r\n\r\n  The minister of Public Works said a few words which did not reach\r\n  us. Great disturbance.\r\n\r\n  _M. Victorin Hulot_.--M. le president, have the goodness to\r\n  request the minister of Public Works not to interrupt the speaker.\r\n  He can answer.\r\n\r\n  _M. de Sallenauve_.--According to M. le comte de Rastignac, I\r\n  showed essential disrespect to the Chamber by asking, in a foreign\r\n  country, for leave of absence, which it was obvious I had already\r\n  taken before making my request. But, in his extreme desire to find\r\n  me to blame, the minister lost sight of the fact that at the time\r\n  I left France the Chamber had not met, no president existed, and\r\n  therefore in making my request at that time to the president of\r\n  this assembly I should simply have addressed a pure abstraction.\r\n  [Left: “True!”] As for the insufficiency of the motives with which\r\n  I supported my request, I regret to have to say to the Chamber\r\n  that I cannot be more explicit even now; because in revealing the\r\n  true cause of my absence I should betray the secret of an\r\n  honorable man, and not my own. I did not conceal from myself that\r\n  by this reticence I exposed my proceedings to mistaken\r\n  interpretations,--though I certainly did not expect it to give\r\n  rise to accusations as burlesque as they are odious. [Much\r\n  excitement.] In point of fact, I was so anxious not to neglect any\r\n  of the duties of my new position that I did precisely what the\r\n  minister of Public Works reproaches me for not doing. I selected a\r\n  man in a most honorable position, who was, like myself, a\r\n  repository of the secret I am unable to divulge, and I requested\r\n  him to make all necessary explanations to the president of this\r\n  Chamber. But, calumny having no doubt worked upon his mind, that\r\n  honorable person must have thought it compromising to his name and\r\n  dignity to do me this service. The danger to me being now over, I\r\n  shall not betray his prudent incognito. Though I was far indeed\r\n  from expecting this calculating selfishness, which has painfully\r\n  surprised and wounded me, I shall be careful to keep this betrayal\r\n  of friendship between myself and his own conscience, which alone\r\n  shall reproach him for the wrong he has done me.\r\n\r\n  At this moment a disturbance occurred in the peers’ gallery; a\r\n  lady had fainted; and several deputies, among them a physician,\r\n  left the hall hastily. The sitting was momentarily suspended.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--Ushers, open the ventilators. It is want of air\r\n  that has caused this unfortunate accident. M. de Sallenauve, be\r\n  good enough to resume your speech.\r\n\r\n  _M. de Sallenauve_.--Two words, gentleman, and I have finished. I\r\n  think the petition to authorize a criminal prosecution has already\r\n  lost something of its weight in the minds of my least cordial\r\n  colleagues. But I have here a letter from the Romilly\r\n  peasant-woman, my relation, duly signed and authenticated,\r\n  withdrawing her charge and confirming all the explanations I have\r\n  just had the honor to give you. I might read this letter aloud to\r\n  you, but I think it more becoming to place it in the hands of M. le\r\n  president. [“Very good! very good!”] As for my illegal absence, I\r\n  returned to Paris early this morning, and I could have been in my\r\n  seat at the opening of the Chamber; but, as M. de Canalis has told\r\n  you, I had it much at heart not to appear in this hall until I\r\n  could disperse the cloud which has so strangely appeared around my\r\n  reputation. It has taken me the whole morning to obtain these\r\n  papers. And now, gentlemen, you have to decide whether a few\r\n  hours’ delay in taking his seat in this Chamber justifies you in\r\n  sending a colleague back to his electors. But after all, whatever\r\n  is done, whether some persist in thinking me a forger, or a\r\n  libertine, or merely a negligent deputy, I feel no anxiety about\r\n  the verdict of my electors. I can confidently assert that after a\r\n  delay of a few weeks I shall return to you.\r\n\r\n  _Cries on all sides_.--The vote! the vote!\r\n\r\n  On leaving the tribune M. de Sallenauve receives many\r\n  congratulations.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--I put to vote the admission of M. de Sallenauve\r\n  as the deputy elected by the arrondissement of Arcis.\r\n\r\n  Nearly the whole Chamber rises and votes the admission; a few\r\n  deputies of the Centre alone abstain from taking part in the\r\n  demonstration.\r\n\r\n  M. de Sallenauve is admitted and takes the oath.\r\n\r\n  _The President_.--The order of the day calls for the reading of\r\n  the Address to the Throne, but the chairman of the committee\r\n  appointed to prepare it informs me that the document in question\r\n  cannot be communicated to the Chamber before to-morrow. Nothing\r\n  else being named in the order of the day, I declare this sitting\r\n  adjourned.\r\n\r\n  The Chamber rose at half-past four o’clock.\r\nTRANSLATOR’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Note.--“The Deputy of Arcis,” of which Balzac wrote and published\r\n  the first part in 1847, was left unfinished at his death. He\r\n  designated M. Charles Rabou, editor of the “Revue de Paris,” as\r\n  the person to take his notes and prepare the rest of the volume\r\n  for the press. It is instructive to a student of Balzac to see how\r\n  disconnected and out of proportion the story becomes in these\r\n  later parts,--showing plainly that the master’s hand was in the\r\n  habit of pruning away half, if not more, of what it had written,\r\n  or--to change the metaphor and give the process in his own\r\n  language--that he put _les grands pots dans les petits pots_, the\r\n  quarts into the pint pots. “If a thing can be done in one line\r\n  instead of two,” he says, “I try to do it.”\r\n\r\n  Some parts of this conclusion are evidently added by M. Rabou, and\r\n  are not derived from Balzac at all,--especially the unnecessary\r\n  reincarnation of Vautrin. There is no trace of the master’s hand\r\n  here. The character is made so silly and puerile, and is so out of\r\n  keeping with Balzac’s strong portrait, which never weakens, that\r\n  the translator has thought best, in justice to Vautrin, to omit\r\n  all that is not absolutely necessary to connect the story.\r\nADDENDUM\r\n\r\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\r\n\r\nArthez, Daniel d’       A
