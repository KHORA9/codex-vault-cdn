I have embodied in\r\nmy book—if I may say so without sounding the loud timbrel too\r\nvain-gloriously—considerable experience as a journalist of General\r\nElections and by-elections in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nand of thirty-five years’ observation of the two Houses of Parliament\r\nfrom the Reporters’ Gallery, supplemented by a study of their history\r\nand traditions, laws and procedure, the careers of leading statesmen,\r\nand the political principles by which they guided their management of\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nThere are many valuable text-books on the Constitution by learned\r\nlawyers and philosophical writers. My book does not aspire to be\r\nclassed with these grave and profound treatises. They are of high\r\ndocumentary value, but I think it is doubtful whether one can really\r\nget to know Parliament from a study of them alone. They ignore the\r\nhuman side of Parliament. Often they seem to present Parliament as a\r\nmere abstraction—a thing of rules, principles and theories unrelated\r\nto the human personalities who compose its membership. Parliament\r\ncannot be divorced from life any more than Literature. Rightly to\r\nappreciate Parliament in its strength and in its weakness you must\r\nhave an acquaintance with it in being, and an understanding of\r\nthe politicians who, whether in office or out of office, whether\r\nin Government or Opposition, bend it, or try to bend it, to their\r\nwill. Mr. Speaker Lowther, presiding at a lecture on the House of\r\nCommons, told a story which serves to illustrate the difference\r\nbetween theory and experience. When Sir William Anson, the author, as\r\nMr. Lowther truly said, of “a very grave and almost classical work”\r\non the British Constitution, was being escorted up the floor of the\r\nHouse of Commons to take the oath and his seat for the first time,\r\nan old and witty Radical member who happened to be sitting beside\r\nMr. Lowther said to him: “Is this the gentleman who has written a\r\ngreat work on the House of Commons?” “Yes, that is the very man,”\r\nreplied Mr. Lowther. “Well,” the other remarked, “he will find it a\r\nvery different place from what he thought it was.” It is idle for\r\nhistorical writers to try to depreciate the importance of personality\r\nin affairs. Certainly in Parliament it is personality that, even more\r\nthan opinion, is the determining factor in every great political\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nI trace the progress of a Parliament, its unfolding and development,\r\nfrom the General Election, when it is constituted by the votes\r\nof the people, until the day the Sovereign, on the advice of the\r\nCabinet, pronounces the sentence of its dissolution. I describe\r\nits framework and machinery, its chief officers, its ceremonies,\r\nusages and customs, its contrasts of solemnity and gaiety; the Party\r\nforces which move it and direct its course; how Administrations\r\nare made; the duties of Ministers; the pleasures and woes of the\r\nM.P.; how Public and Private Bills are passed; how Supplies are\r\nvoted; the mode in which the proceedings of both Houses are reported\r\nfor the newspapers; and the varied elements, aspects and usages\r\nof Parliament, whether it be regarded as the historic temple of\r\nBritish liberties, equally ancient and venerable with Westminster\r\nAbbey over the way; the scene of great achievements in oratory\r\nand statesmanship; the institution by which, as the incarnation\r\nof the current political thought of the day, questions affecting\r\nthe well-being of the community are determined by legislators and\r\nadministrators, or the field upon which the continuous and exciting\r\nduel between Parties is fought at close quarters, with all the whims,\r\noddities, weaknesses of human nature as well as with its noble\r\nqualities. I have made some excursions into the domain of history.\r\nThat, of course, was inevitable in writing about Parliament, whose\r\nroots lie so deep in the past. But I have avoided as much as\r\npossible the broad beaten tracks, and have turned down unfrequented\r\nor little-trodden by-ways in search of fresh and apt anecdotes to\r\nenliven my descriptions, in fact and in experience, of the Pageant of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThere is one general observation which I should like to make, and\r\nit may not be out of place to make it here. My studies have led to\r\nthe discovery that there has hardly ever been a time when it has not\r\nbeen asserted by someone or other, in writing or in speech, that\r\nthe authority of Parliament and the esteem in which it is held have\r\nsadly declined. There is nothing surprising in that. Cynics and wits\r\nof all ages have tried their hand at making great institutions,\r\nas well as great men, butts at which to shoot their ridicule and\r\ncontempt. Parliament has not escaped the common fate of the mighty\r\nand the sublime. It has been described as inefficient and corrupt.\r\nIts downfall has often been prophesied. Yet its foundations were\r\nnever deeper or better laid than they are to-day, broad-based as they\r\nare on electoral comprehensiveness and the people’s will. Parliament\r\nas I have presented it—even with all reverence and admiration—may\r\nnot be perfect. It has its faults. After all, its legislators and\r\nadministrators are but human. But it is, perhaps, as fine and perfect\r\nan instrument of democratic government as can humanly be devised.\r\nAncient and renowned as it is, it stands not remote and apart. On\r\nthe contrary, it is of the fabric of the life of the people. It\r\nmakes a living reality of the great principle—“Government of the\r\npeople, by the people, for the people.” It is the country’s chief\r\npolitical instrument of progressive civilization. It is idle, in\r\nthe light of experience, to talk of its being clumsy, inefficient,\r\nslow. More than ever does it make possible the closest and quickest\r\nimpact of the country’s mind upon government and administration. In\r\nthe World War it signally proved its practical and speedy utility.\r\nStatesmen obtained quickly and surely all the measures they deemed\r\nnecessary for the national safety and the enemy’s defeat. Whenever\r\nParliament seems to have lost caste the cause may be traced, not\r\nto the institution itself but to its membership, the confusion of\r\nits Parties, the weakness of its Ministry. The remedy is not to\r\ndestroy it, and put in its place some untried mode of government\r\nand administration; but, by changing its composition, to restore it\r\nto the proper service of the Nation. Parliament is fully capable of\r\naccomplishing whatever may be asked of it, in the changing thoughts\r\nof men, probably, till the end of all time, and of doing so soberly\r\nand slowly by process of evolution, or with revolutionary rapidity\r\nand completeness, as the situation demands.\r\n\r\n                                                    MICHAEL MACDONAGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n         PREFACE                                                     5\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n      I.

A NIGHT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS                           235\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAGEANT OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE MEMBER AND THE CONSTITUENCY\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nAt the General Election the Party in office throws down its superb\r\nchallenge to the Party in Opposition. “We appeal,” they say, “to\r\nthe solemn judgment of the Nation on the political issues in\r\ncontention between us.” This invoking of the electors’ decision\r\nat once raises a question of political morality as well as of\r\nconstitutional practice—the relation in which a Member of Parliament\r\nrightly stands to his constituency. Is the M.P. a representative\r\nor a delegate? As these capacities may be said to be in a sense\r\nidentical, it is well to put the question in a fuller and more\r\ndefinite form. Is the M.P. an agent sent to the House of Commons\r\nby the electors of a certain geographical district to state their\r\nopinions solely and act in accordance with them, or may he exercise\r\nhis own independent judgment, even against the will of those to\r\nwhom he owes his seat in the Assembly? Edmund Burke dealt with this\r\nquestion on the hustings at Bristol, during the General Election\r\nof 1774, in a speech that is memorable in political literature as\r\na classic statement of the constitutional position of an M.P., in\r\nthe opinion of the representative, at least, and also, it must be\r\nsaid, in the opinion of a large body of the electors. Burke said\r\nit ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live\r\nin the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most\r\nunreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought\r\nto have great weight with him, their opinions high respect, their\r\nbusiness unremitted attention. “But,” Burke goes on, “his unbiased\r\nopinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought\r\nnot to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.\r\nThese he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and\r\nthe Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of\r\nwhich he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you not his\r\nindustry only, but his judgment, and he betrays instead of serves\r\nyou if he sacrifices it to your opinions.” Nevertheless, Burke was\r\nreturned to the House of Commons as Member for Bristol in 1774, for\r\nno more exalted reason than that his political views were in accord\r\nwith those of the majority of the constituency in regard to the\r\nmatters that then divided Tories and Whigs.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Burke supported two Bills that were presented to the House\r\nof Commons, one relaxing some of the restrictions on Irish trade,\r\nthe other removing some of the civil disabilities of the Roman\r\nCatholics. These votes were in conformity with Burke’s mature\r\njudgment as a statesman as well as with his Irish prepossessions.\r\nBut they were also directly in opposition to the material interests\r\nand the religious tenets of the people of Bristol. That being so,\r\nBurke fell into disfavour, and, however honourably his unpopularity\r\nwas earned, it was inevitable that he should be brought to account\r\nby his constituents on the first opportunity. This was afforded by\r\nthe General Election of 1780. In a noble speech from the hustings\r\nin defence of his action, he exclaimed: “I did not obey your\r\ninstructions. No; I conformed to the instructions of truth and\r\nNature, and maintained your interests against your opinions with a\r\nconstancy that became me.” He went on, in passages of moving power\r\nand earnestness, to declare that he did not stand before them accused\r\nof any venality or neglect of duty. “No,” he cried, “the charges\r\nagainst me are all of one kind: that I have pushed the principles\r\nof general justice and benevolence too far, further than a cautious\r\npolicy would warrant, and further than the opinions of many would go\r\nalong with me. In every accident which may happen through life—in\r\npain, in sorrow, in depression, and distress, I will call to mind\r\nthis accusation and be comforted.” But the popular prejudice against\r\nBurke—a prejudice aroused solely by the expression of his liberality\r\nand broad-mindedness in action—was too strong to be overcome. The\r\ngreat statesman and philosopher was compelled to retire early from\r\nthe contest, badly beaten.\r\n\r\nThe electors of Bristol have been put in the pillory for intolerance\r\nand selfishness, while Burke stands, for all time, a shining\r\nexample of self-sacrificing devotion to independence of mind. Many\r\nyears have passed since then—years of steady advance in political\r\nenlightenment, and in public duty on the part of electors as well as\r\nof representatives—and questions, more vital and fundamental, arise\r\nconstantly for settlement. Yet where to-day is the constituency ready\r\nto elect a man who is opposed to its political views, however great a\r\ngenius he may be, and however stainless his honour? There is nothing\r\nmore certain than that Bristol would expel Burke in the twentieth\r\ncentury as it expelled him in the eighteenth, if his political\r\nopinions were distasteful to the majority of the electors, or if his\r\nparliamentary actions were opposed to what they conceived to be their\r\ninterests. A hundred years hence the Nation may have reason to bewail\r\nour obtuseness, and, in resentment of the trouble we have caused\r\nthem, bitterly to cry out—“Fools, fools, fools!” The thought does\r\nnot disturb our political equanimity. We are resolved to yield our\r\nopinions, prepossessions, prejudices to no man who would tell us to\r\nthink and act differently—aye, though he be our M.P.!\r\n\r\nIn no constituency will the plea be accepted that the Member must\r\nbe allowed to decide what is best ultimately for it against its\r\nopinions, or even against its prejudices—if, indeed, the one can be\r\ndistinguished from the other in politics. It is not only that in this\r\nconflict of one mind against many the wrong-headedness is just as\r\nmuch likely to exist in the representative as in the constituents.\r\nWhat is more, the representative system is a check, not on the\r\npeople, but for the people. The chief function of the House of\r\nCommons is to protect the people’s rights and extend their social\r\nwell-being; and as under our democratic system the people are free to\r\nvote as they please and for whom they please, it is inevitable that\r\nthey should constitute themselves, in each constituency, the supreme\r\njudge as to the man best fitted faithfully to discharge a trust that\r\nmeans so much to them. That is not to say that a Member of Parliament\r\nis expected to outrage his honour and conscience by supporting\r\nmeasures which he secretly abhors, or believes in his heart to be\r\ndetrimental in the long run to the true interests of the Nation,\r\nbecause they find favour with a majority of his constituents, and to\r\noppose them would entail the loss of his seat. He votes, of course,\r\naccording to his convictions. Nor is it necessary for him to comport\r\nhimself in an attitude of servility towards the electorate. Once he\r\nis returned he may, if he so pleases, entirely change his politics,\r\nand cross the floor of the House of Commons without having beforehand\r\nto go back to his constituency, as a delegate in a like situation\r\nwould be bound to refer to the body or society of which he was the\r\nchosen spokesman. The constituency has no immediate control over the\r\nrepresentative. They cannot forthwith deprive him of his authority\r\nand position, as a society or other body can recall and supersede\r\na delegate. But the representative who votes according to personal\r\nconvictions which are out of harmony with the political principles of\r\nthe majority of his constituency must be ready to pay the penalty of\r\nthis conflict between his opinion and their judgment—the penalty of\r\nbeing summarily dismissed, like Burke, at the earliest opportunity.\r\nIn a word, such a representative is rejected by the constituency\r\nfor the very same reason that the country frequently discharges a\r\nGovernment at the General Election—incompatibility of political\r\ntemper. The feeling of most electors is that they would be false to\r\nthemselves—false, at any rate, to their opinions—were they to vote\r\nfor a candidate with whom they were in disagreement on political\r\nissues, no matter how great he might be as a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nGoldsmith, in well-known lines, gently reproves Burke as one—\r\n\r\n      Who, born for the universe, narrowed his mind,\r\n      And to Party gave up what was meant for mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it would be truer to say that Burke was politically\r\nundone because he gave his grand talents to what he regarded as the\r\nservice of mankind rather than to Party, particularly in relation to\r\nthe French Revolution, when the action of his Party was, in his view,\r\nopposed to the real interests of humanity. Moreover, Goldsmith uses\r\nthe word “Party” in a disparaging sense. His idea of Party politics\r\nseems to have been that it was a game unscrupulously played for the\r\nstakes of mere power and influence, greater wealth and station; and\r\nthere are people even to-day who agree with him. It is a strange\r\nnotion, and one that appears to me to be entirely without foundation.\r\nUndoubtedly the inspiring force of Party is a sincere regard for\r\nthe good of the Commonwealth. It is true there are politicians,\r\nwith little principle and less scruple, who become Party men for\r\nthe advancement of personal ambitions which are mean and unworthy\r\nin the circumstances. But all the Party movements—Conservative,\r\nUnionist, Liberal, Radical, Labour, Irish Nationalist, Free Trade,\r\nProtection—are each, in the main, an honest effort, however you or I\r\nmay think it mistaken, to effect the greatest good of the greatest\r\nnumber. As to the ultimate object, all Parties are agreed. It is the\r\nmethods by which this common end had best be attained that creates\r\nthe fundamental differences between Parties and excites political\r\nantagonisms.\r\n\r\n“Party,” says Burke, “is a body of men united for promoting by their\r\njoint endeavour the national interest upon some particular principle\r\nupon which they are all agreed.” No one else has written more\r\npowerfully in support of the view that Party discipline is essential\r\nto strong and stable parliamentary government. Yet Burke himself\r\nwas a most indifferent Party man. He had that stern independence\r\nof judgment which, refusing to yield even in details, is fatal\r\nto the unity of purpose and action without which efficient Party\r\norganization is impossible. From the Party point of view, Burke, with\r\nall his political philosophy, was just what Fox described him—“a\r\ndamned wrong-headed fellow!” The theory advanced by Burke that a\r\nMember of Parliament ought to be returned unfettered by political\r\npledges because it is his bounden duty to exercise his free and\r\nindependent judgment, irrespective of the constituency’s opinions\r\nand desires, on the public questions that arise for decision, is an\r\nexalted counsel of perfection. Perhaps it makes a demand too stern\r\nand unbending for human nature under any form of Constitution,\r\nhowever Utopian or perfect. In a Parliament based on the Party system\r\nit is impossible of acceptance. The power of the House of Commons\r\nis exercised not according to any fixed rule of law, but according\r\nto certain broad general principles—Justice, Equity, Reason—and the\r\ncurrent interpretation of these principles is guided by the dominant\r\npolitical opinions of the day.\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament are, in practice if not in form, Party\r\ndelegates. To them the majority of the electorate have relegated\r\ntheir authority to support or oppose in the House of Commons the\r\ncontroversial political questions of the time in the light of certain\r\nParty principles. Whatever local character the M.P. possesses may be\r\nsaid to disappear as soon as he presents the return of the writ to\r\nthe Clerk at the Table of the House of Commons, shakes hands with the\r\nSpeaker, and then, amid Party cheers, makes his way to the Liberal,\r\nor Unionist, or Labour benches, according to the Party views he was\r\nreally chosen to support. By that action he stands revealed as a\r\nParty delegate. And yet he is a representative, in a sense deeper\r\nand wider than that which prevailed of old, before the uprise of the\r\npowerful Party organization. He is a representative not solely of the\r\nlocal views of his constituency, but of one section of the paramount\r\nand possibly abiding opinions of the Nation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe country being, in the main, divided politically into three chief\r\ngroups of thought—Conservative, Liberal and Labour—the machinery\r\nfor the promotion of political principles and Party interests is\r\nprincipally supplied by three great rival organizations. These are\r\nthe National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations,\r\ncontrolled by the Conservative Central Office; the National Liberal\r\nFederation, controlled by the Liberal Central Association; and the\r\nLabour Party, controlled by the National Executive. Each of these\r\norganizations is aided by several subsidiary but independent bodies,\r\nwhich are formed for the promotion of sectional political interests\r\nwithin the main movement to which they are attached.\r\n\r\nThe systems of the National Union, the Liberal Federation and the\r\nLabour Party are much alike in methods. Those of the two ancient\r\npolitical Parties may be taken for the purposes of illustration. In\r\nmost constituencies there is a branch of each organization. These\r\nlocal bodies elect the council for the county or for the borough.\r\nThese councils send delegates to the annual conferences of the\r\nConservative Union, or the Liberal Federation, by which the programme\r\nof each Party is considered, revised and confirmed, and a central\r\nexecutive is appointed with supreme authority. The branches look\r\nafter Party interests locally. The Federation, or the Union, speak\r\nfor the Liberalism or Conservatism of the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nBut in reality Party organization is controlled, for the\r\nConservatives by the Conservative Central Office, and for the\r\nLiberals by the Liberal Central Association. Both the Union and the\r\nFederation are founded upon a popular and representative basis, and\r\ntheir annual meetings, at least, are open to the Press. They each\r\nfulfil the double functions of educating political thought in the\r\ncountry, and of enabling the Party leaders in Parliament to gauge\r\nthe drift of opinion within the Party on current questions of the\r\nday. But of the working of the Conservative Central Office and the\r\nLiberal Central Association little or nothing is made public—nothing,\r\nat any rate, that is really important. What is known is that each\r\nconsists of a staff of officials directed by a Chief Agent, who\r\nis appointed by the parliamentary leaders of the Party. The Chief\r\nParty Whip in the House of Commons is also a leading director of\r\nthe affairs of each of these central bodies. In each is vested the\r\nexpenditure of the Party fund, subscribed by wealthy supporters, and\r\npopularly supposed to be immense. Each has a voice in the selection\r\nof candidates. The favour of headquarters is often the best passport\r\nto selection by the local association. Each body has an agent\r\npermanently residing in constituencies where political opinion is\r\npretty evenly divided. “Give the men a smoking concert,” these Party\r\nagents are advised in a little book called _How to Win an Election_,\r\n“where they can obtain a reasonable quantity of good, pure, wholesome\r\nbeer, rather than a tea opened with a touch of the religious\r\nelement.” Each body also has gentlemen continually on the road—rival\r\npolitical travellers, as it were, bringing round to the electors\r\nthe newest and most attractive samples of principles, Liberal or\r\nConservative.\r\n\r\nSuch is the British variant of the American Caucus. It was imported\r\nfrom the country of its origin, in 1873, by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain—a\r\nman who has profoundly influenced Party tactics and strategy, as\r\nwell as political opinion, in Great Britain—and was first set up\r\nin Birmingham under the direction of Mr. Francis Schnadhorst. The\r\nCaucus was at once attacked as a most mischievous element in public\r\nlife. It was contended by old-fashioned Liberals and Tories alike\r\nthat it would make impossible the free expression of the will of\r\nthe constituency. The electors would become an unthinking, passive\r\nmass under the dominion of headquarters, and the destiny of the\r\nNation—controlled as it is by the exercise of the franchise—would\r\npass into the hands, perhaps, of unprincipled and artful demagogues.\r\nBut the Caucus had come to stay. It was adopted by the Conservatives\r\nas well as by the Liberals. In fact, the idea of forming a Party\r\norganization in this country first originated with Disraeli.\r\n\r\nIn the General Election of 1868 the Conservative Government, of which\r\nDisraeli was Prime Minister, was hopelessly beaten at the polls.\r\nThere was practically no organization of the Conservatives at the\r\ntime, and the work of bringing it into existence was entrusted by\r\nDisraeli to a young barrister who had been in the House of Commons\r\nfor a year or two—John Eldon Gorst. Gorst began by establishing\r\nthe “Central Conservative Office.” He then proceeded to create a\r\npermanent system of local bodies throughout the country for the\r\nregistration of voters, linked them up in the National Union, and\r\nkept at headquarters a register of approved candidates from which\r\nthe local bodies could make their own selection. The dissolution of\r\nthe Liberal Parliament in 1874, unexpected though it was, found the\r\nConservatives accordingly quite prepared, and they returned from\r\nthe polls victorious. The Liberals then set earnestly to work on the\r\nsame lines, and, improving upon the Conservative example, produced an\r\neven more perfect electoral machine. In 1877 Schnadhorst founded the\r\nNational Liberal Federation, and, becoming the chief organizer and\r\nelectoral adviser of the Liberal Party, it was to his exertions that\r\nthe immense Gladstonian victory of 1880 was mainly due. Schnadhorst,\r\non his retirement in 1887, was presented with 10,000 guineas by the\r\nLiberal Party as a slight recognition of his great services to their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the rise of the highly developed and powerful Central Party\r\norganization was a destined stage of political development in Great\r\nBritain as well as in the United States. An essential adjunct of a\r\nconstitutional system like the British—the two fundamental principles\r\nof which are democracy and Party government—is the Party organization\r\nfor the education of public opinion in its tenets, and for having its\r\nforces ready to take the field at the General Election, the outcome\r\nof which is the supremacy of one Party or the other in the House\r\nof Commons for a term of years, and, consequently, the paramount\r\ninfluence of one set of political principles or the other in the\r\ngovernment of the Nation. Moreover, the effect of Party organization\r\nhas, on the whole, been beneficent. It is hardly too much to say that\r\nto it is due the healthy political vitality of Great Britain. It has\r\naroused an interest in public affairs and government, and by the\r\npropagation of ideas it has given to the democracy coherent political\r\nconvictions. If public opinion were unorganized, its aimless ebbing\r\nand flowing—knowing not what it really desired—its tendency to\r\nseparate into numerous factions, some of them, possibly, with wild\r\nand visionary aims, would have led in time to the instability of the\r\nConstitution. The Party system, on the other hand, has undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to the strength and security of the State by bringing\r\nabout the convergence of the various streams of political thought\r\ninto three main channels, each with settled principles, Conservative,\r\nLiberal and Labour in tendency, and pursuing ends that are on the\r\nwhole national as well as rational.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWOOING OF THE ELECTORS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nParty organization reached its highest point of perfection and\r\ninfluence before the outbreak of the World War in 1914. Yet even at\r\nthat period it was remarkable how small both the Conservative Union\r\nand the Liberal Association were in actual membership. It was unusual\r\nto find among one’s acquaintances, however wide the circle, anyone\r\nwho belonged to either organization. Their power lay in propaganda\r\nand direction. And if millions of voters acknowledged their sway,\r\nthere were other millions, though not quite so many, perhaps, over\r\nwhom they had no influence. At many General Elections before the War\r\nnot more than 50 or 60 per cent. of the electors went to the polls.\r\nThe absentees were equally numerous in electoral contests immediately\r\nafter the War.\r\n\r\nWho are they, these silent voters, who constitute so unknown a\r\nquantity, so sore a puzzle, to the Party managers, and sometimes\r\nconfound their nicest calculations? A man’s politics depends upon his\r\nindividual temperament and point of view, but, like his religion, it\r\nis largely the accident of his birth and home environment or early\r\neducation. I have seen an election address in which the candidate\r\nsaid: “I was born a Conservative on August 29, 1848.” Another man\r\nis a Liberal because of the chance that it was Liberalism and not\r\nConservatism which he unconsciously imbibed at his father’s knee. In\r\nfact, the sentry in Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera was not far\r\nwrong in singing that every little boy or girl who’s born into the\r\nworld alive—\r\n\r\n      Is either a little Liberal,\r\n      Or else a little Conservative.\r\n\r\nBut the silent voter seems to have disdained to adopt fixed and\r\nsettled political opinions—like the generality of mankind—either by\r\ninheritance or by an effort of thought. It may be that he is ignorant\r\nof the object of politics, in the general sense of the word; it\r\nmay be that he knows what it implies, but thinks it unimportant.\r\nAt any rate, the cries of Party make no appeal to him. He owes\r\nallegiance to none of the three great political organizations, nor\r\nto any of the many smaller groups formed for the advancement of\r\nparticular purposes. He is scornful of the mere Party man. “Hack,”\r\nindeed, is the word he contemptuously uses. In his opinion ordinary\r\npoliticians are but gramophones which mechanically grind out echoes\r\nof the catch cries that emanate from the Party headquarters or the\r\nParty newspapers. Indeed, the Party system appears to him a thing\r\neminently absurd. He sees nothing in it but three scolding political\r\norganizations condemning each other’s methods and belittling each\r\nother’s achievements, bent solely on the possession of office with\r\nits attendant prestige and benefits. In his self-righteousness he\r\naccounts himself the ideal elector who, animated by a high sense of\r\npublic duty, refuses to espouse any side in the Party struggle, and,\r\ntaking the welfare of the Nation as his guiding light, brings free\r\nand reasoned judgment to bear upon the rival political policies at\r\nissue in the General Election. On the other hand, the staunch Party\r\nadherent calls him a “wobbler”—a sort of backboneless creature who\r\ncannot stand steadily upon his legs, much less four square to all the\r\nwinds that blow, and who, when he votes, is influenced by some petty\r\nmood of the moment.\r\n\r\nBut whatever he may be—whether the idealistic free and enlightened\r\nelector, or a creature of unstable mind, whether he represents a\r\nlow standard of political intelligence, or the highest form of\r\nintegrity applied to politics—undoubtedly he it is who swings the\r\nelectoral pendulum. He is the human instrument for the working out\r\nof that curious law of electioneering by which, before the World\r\nWar, with but little irregularity, one Party succeeded the other in\r\noffice, since the first really democratic extension of the franchise\r\nby Disraeli’s Reform Act of 1867, when the principle of household\r\nsuffrage was established. The “wobblers” are not organized. They\r\nhave no newspapers. No common consciousness of similar aims unifies\r\nor unites them. They do not appear upon platforms nor in audiences,\r\nnor do they feel impelled to write to the Press. They keep their\r\nown counsel, and rarely talk politics even in their own circles.\r\nThey are, in fact, ignorant of each other’s existence. Yet their\r\npolitical influence is immense. It is not that they succeed in having\r\nthemselves largely represented in Parliament. A peer who sits on the\r\n“cross benches” in the House of Lords—right in the middle of the\r\nfloor, unattached, between the Government and the Opposition—is the\r\nclosest analogue of the “wobbler” to be found in Parliament. Nor\r\nare they successful in having their political views considered in\r\nlegislation and administration. Indeed, it is likely that they are a\r\nvery varied lot in ideas, sentiments, and tastes. Almost invariably\r\nnon-politicians are dead against change. So long as things go on\r\npretty much as usual they are content to stand aside. But if it\r\nwere possible to hold a convention of “wobblers,” and they drew up\r\na political programme, we should have, no doubt, a fearful mixture\r\nof Toryism, Liberalism, Socialism, of the principles of free trade\r\nand tariff reform, of open doors and closed ports, of loaves big and\r\nlittle, of nationalization and private enterprise, of the whole hog\r\nor none.\r\n\r\nThe power which is wielded by this silent reserve of voters, as\r\nopposed to the crowd who belong to organizations, or who go to\r\nmeetings and make their opinions known, is this—that in many\r\nconstituencies where the steadfast Liberal, Conservative, and Labour\r\nsupporters are evenly balanced, they exercise, as it were, the\r\ncasting vote. In them may be said to lie the decision of the fateful\r\nquestion of the General Election—Shall the Government of the British\r\nEmpire be Conservative or Liberal or Labour for a term of years? In\r\nthe mass they may be moved by opposing sentiments and motives, they\r\nmay be pursuing widely different ends. Many of them, no doubt, are\r\nof the kind who can only support a cause so long as it is favoured\r\nby fortune. But, as a rule, they are friendly disposed towards the\r\n“outs.” “Let the ‘outs’ have a turn of office,” they say, as they\r\nplace their cross on the ballot paper in the polling booth. Thus\r\nswings the electoral pendulum to and fro.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there is a wave of national feeling—whether it be\r\nenthusiasm for the new cause, or absolute weariness of the old,\r\nwhich, as in the extraordinary General Election of 1906 that brought\r\nthe Liberals back to power after many years in the wilderness, sweeps\r\nover the country like a tidal wave overthrowing the barriers set up\r\nby the Party organizations and obliterating the lines of orthodox\r\nParty politics. Then it is that the non-political electors who do\r\nnot trouble to vote on ordinary occasions flock to the polls in\r\ntheir hundreds of thousands, that numbers of voters who held their\r\nopinions weakly go over to the other side, and that the candidates\r\nof the Party in power are made to feel the full weight of their\r\ncombined wrath. But this rarely happens. In the periods of calm which\r\nmore often mark the public life of England, when there are no really\r\nfundamental or vital differences between parties, and interest in\r\npolitics is, therefore, at a low ebb, when the General Election means\r\nno more than a struggle to get one set of Ministers out and another\r\nset of Ministers in, victory for Liberalism, Conservatism, or Labour\r\ndepends on organization and persistent urging during the actual\r\ncontest, each on their own particular supporters, to fail not, on\r\ntheir Party allegiance, to go to the polling booths.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe contrast between elections in the nineteenth and in the twentieth\r\ncenturies is very striking and interesting. We see the good effects\r\nof Party in sweeping away electoral corruption, and also its\r\ndrawbacks in limiting the scope of independent opinion and character.\r\nOne of the most remarkable elections ever held was that which led to\r\nthe return of John Stuart Mill for Westminster, as an independent\r\nMember, in 1865. Mill’s views were uncommon at the time. He held that\r\na Member of Parliament should not have to incur one farthing of cost\r\nfor undertaking a public duty. The expenses of an election ought, in\r\nhis opinion, to be borne as a public charge, either by the State or\r\nby the locality. Mill also contended that the M.P. should not be\r\nexpected to give any of his time or labour to the local interests.\r\nHe declared that he himself had no desire to enter Parliament. He\r\nthought he could do more as a writer in the way of propagating\r\nhis opinions. He declined to conduct a personal canvass of the\r\nconstituency. Mill thus set at defiance all the accepted notions of\r\nright electioneering. A well-known literary man, he relates, was\r\nheard to say that the Almighty Himself would have no chance of being\r\nelected on such a programme. Yet Mill was returned by a majority of\r\nsome hundreds over his “Conservative competitor,” as he calls his\r\nopponent. And all his expenses were paid by the constituency. It was\r\nimpossible in the state of Party feeling even then existing that so\r\nindependent a Member as Mill could be allowed to remain very long in\r\nParliament. So Mill was thrown out at the General Election of 1868.\r\n“That I should not have been elected at all would not have required\r\nany explanation,” he writes in his _Autobiography_. “What excites\r\ncuriosity is that I should have been elected the first time, or,\r\nhaving been elected then, should have been defeated afterwards.”\r\nThe explanation was that his writings gave as much confidence\r\nto Conservatives as they did to the Liberals that he would be a\r\nsupporter of their cause. The reason he was rejected was that in\r\nParliament he pleased neither the one nor the other.\r\n\r\nMacaulay, like Mill, was opposed to canvassing. He declared that an\r\nelector who surrendered his vote to supplication, or to the caresses\r\nof his baby, forgot his duty as much as if he sold it for a banknote.\r\nIn his contest for the representation of Leeds, in 1832, he refrained\r\nfrom asking a single elector personally for his vote. He wrote:\r\n\r\n  The suffrage of an elector ought not to be asked or to be given\r\n  as a personal favour. It is as much for the interest of the\r\n  constituents to choose well, as it can be for the interest of the\r\n  candidate to be chosen. To request an honest man to vote against\r\n  his conscience is an insult. The practice of canvassing is quite\r\n  reasonable under a system in which men are sent to Parliament to\r\n  serve themselves. It is the height of absurdity under a system in\r\n  which men are sent to Parliament to serve the public.\r\n\r\nGladstone, on the other hand, nor only recognized that canvassing\r\nwas essential to successful electioneering, but also positively\r\nenjoyed it. He, too, was a candidate in that General Election which\r\nfollowed the passing of the great Reform Bill of 1832. He once said,\r\ntowards the end of his long life, that in all the stirring and\r\nmomentous political scenes in which he had been an actor—fighting\r\nfor a seat in the House of Commons, making Cabinets, taking part in\r\nhistoric decisions on peace and war—there was nothing to compare for\r\nexcitement with his first contest for Newark in 1832, out of which\r\nhe came victorious. There were 2,000 houses in the borough. It was\r\nthen the custom for the candidates in all elections personally to\r\nvisit every house, whether occupied by a voter or not, to solicit the\r\nelector for his vote and the non-elector for his or her influence.\r\nGladstone went five times to every house in Newark, thus making\r\n10,000 calls in all. In the twentieth century most candidates\r\nare disposed to dispense with canvassing altogether. It must be\r\nrepugnant to sensitive souls, or to those with a quick response to\r\nthe ridiculous, to have to go from house to house following the\r\ntraditionally seductive ways of the aspirant to a seat in the House\r\nof Commons. Perhaps the prettiest compliments that have ever been\r\npaid, outside those of the lover to his mistress, have been paid by\r\ncandidates canvassing electors. Kissing even played a leading part\r\nin the art in the gallant days of old. The custom had its drawbacks.\r\nDid not the eloquent auctioneer who offered for sale the notorious\r\nborough of Gatton, in Surrey, with its estate and mansion as well\r\nas the power of electing two M.P.’s, set out, among its advantages:\r\n“No claims of insolent electors to evade; no impossible promises\r\nto make; no tinkers’ wives to kiss”! So kissing by candidates has\r\nfallen into disfavour, and the most candidates are expected to do is\r\nto pinch the cheeks of babies or chuck them under the chin, in the\r\nhope of inducing the parents to recognize the merits of the Unionist\r\nor Liberal or Labour cause. Perhaps canvassing ought to be included\r\nin the practices which are declared by statute to be illegal at\r\nelections. But its effect on the issue of the contest, especially\r\nin constituencies where the Parties are rather evenly divided, is\r\nsometimes decisive. The feeling of many electors is that in their\r\nvotes they possess a favour to bestow. They like to be asked for it,\r\nand the candidate who comes to their houses, hat in hand, soliciting\r\ntheir support, usually gets it, at least from the non-party electors\r\nor the “wobblers.”\r\n\r\nIn days gone by, even candidates with the highest sense of virtue\r\nand honour, public and private, had to woo the electors by a\r\nlavish expenditure of money. Lord Cochrane stood as a Whig for\r\nHoniton at a by-election in the spring of 1806 against Augustus\r\nCavendish Bradshaw, who sought “a renewal of the confidence of the\r\nconstituency” on accepting a place in the Tory Government. Bradshaw\r\nhad paid five guineas a vote at the former election, and on this\r\noccasion expected to get returned unopposed at the reduced rate of\r\ntwo guineas; but on the appearance of Cochrane in the field he was\r\ncompelled to raise his bounty to the old figure. “You need not ask\r\nme, my lord, who I vote for,” said a burgess to Cochrane; “I always\r\nvote for Mister Most.” The gallant seaman, however, refused to bribe\r\nat all, and got well beaten in consequence. How he turned his defeat\r\nto account makes an amusing story. After the election he sent the\r\nbellman round the town, directing those who had voted for him to go\r\nto his agent, Mr. Townsend, and receive ten guineas. The novelty of\r\na defeated candidate paying double the current price of a vote—or,\r\nindeed, paying anything at all—made a great sensation. Cochrane\r\nstates in his _Autobiography of a Seaman_ that his agent assured him\r\nhe could have secured his return for less money. As the popular voice\r\nwas in his favour a trifling judicious expenditure would have turned\r\nthe scale. “I told Mr. Townsend,” he writes, “that such payment would\r\nhave been bribery, which would not have accorded with my character as\r\na reformer of abuses—a declaration which seemed highly to amuse him.\r\nNotwithstanding the explanation that the ten guineas was paid as a\r\nreward for having withstood the influence of bribery, the impression\r\nproduced on the electoral mind by such unlooked-for liberality was\r\nsimply this—that if I gave ten guineas for being beaten, my opponent\r\nhad not paid half enough for being elected: a conclusion which, by a\r\nsimilar process of reasoning, was magnified into the conviction that\r\neach of his voters had been cheated out of five pounds five.” In the\r\nOctober following there was a General Election. Cochrane was again a\r\ncandidate for Honiton, and, although he had said nothing about paying\r\nfor his votes, was returned at the head of the poll. The burgesses\r\nwere convinced that on this occasion he was “Mister Most.” Surely it\r\nwas impossible to conceive any limits to the bounty of a successful\r\ncandidate who in defeat was so generous as voluntarily to pay ten\r\nguineas a vote! They got—not a penny! Cochrane told them that bribery\r\nwas against his principles. What the trustful electors said about\r\ntheir representative would not bear repetition here. But there was\r\nanother dissolution a few months afterwards, and Cochrane did not\r\ndare to face outraged Honiton.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIt was not often, however, that burgesses were outwitted by a\r\ncandidate. A story that is told of the Irish borough of Cashel\r\nshows how the voters usually scored. The electors, locally known\r\nas “Commoners,” fourteen in number, were notoriously corrupt, and\r\nalways sold their votes to the highest bidder. It was for this\r\nconstituency, by the way, that that very prim and straight-laced\r\nman, Sir Robert Peel, was first returned to Parliament in 1809. The\r\nusual price of a vote in Cashel was £20. The popular candidate at one\r\nelection, anxious to win the seat honestly and not to spend a penny\r\nin corruption, got the parish priest to preach a sermon at Mass, on\r\nthe Sunday before the polling, against the immorality of trafficking\r\nin the franchise. The good man, indeed, went so far in the course of\r\nhis impressive sermon as to declare that those who betrayed a public\r\ntrust by selling their votes would go to hell. Next day the candidate\r\nmet one of the electors and asked what was the effect of Sunday’s\r\nsermon. “Your honour,” said he, “votes have risen. We always got\r\n£20 for a vote before we knew it was a sin to sell it; but as his\r\nreverence tells us that we will be damned for selling our votes, we\r\ncan’t for the future afford to take less than £40.” The borough was\r\nultimately disfranchised for corruption.\r\n\r\nBribery did not always mean the direct purchase of votes for money\r\ndown. Many whimsical dodges were adopted to influence voters\r\nwithout running any great risk from the law. Cheap articles were\r\nbought from the voters at fancy prices, or a valuable commodity was\r\nsold to them at a fraction of its value. At an election at Sudbury\r\nin 1826 a candidate purchased from a greengrocer two cabbages for\r\n£10 and a plate of gooseberries for £25. He paid the butcher, the\r\ngrocer, the baker, the tailor, the printer, the billsticker, at\r\nequally extravagant rates. At Great Marlow an elector got a sow and\r\na litter of nine for a penny. Candidates also suddenly developed\r\nhobbies for buying birds, animals, and articles of various kinds\r\nwhich caught their eye during the house-to-house canvass. Some were\r\nenthusiastic collectors of old almanacs; others were passionately\r\nfond of children’s white mice. “Name your price,” said the candidate.\r\n“Is a pound too much?” replied the voter. “Nonsense, man,” said\r\nthe candidate; “here are two guineas.” Rivers of beer were also\r\nset flowing in the constituencies. The experience of the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury (the philanthropist and friend of the working classes)\r\nwas common. As Lord Ashley he contested Dorset in the anti-Reform\r\ninterest at the General Election of 1831, which followed the\r\nrejection of the first Reform Bill, and was defeated. His expenses\r\namounted to £15,600, of which £12,525 was paid to the owners of inns\r\nand public-houses for refreshments—“free drinks” to the people.\r\nIn those days some of the most respectable as well as renowned\r\nof parliamentarians got their chance by means of a judicious\r\ndistribution of five-pound notes among the electors.\r\n\r\nWhen bribery was thus avowed and flagrant, no limit could be placed\r\nto the possible cost of a seat in the House of Commons. Success\r\nwas won, or defeat sustained, in many an election at the price of\r\nbankruptcy and ruin. The most expensive contest in the annals of\r\nelectioneering was the fight in 1807 for the representation of\r\nYorkshire. The candidates were Lord Milton, son of Earl Fitzwilliam\r\n(Whig); the Hon. Henry Lascelles, son of Lord Harewood (Tory); and\r\nWilliam Wilberforce, the famous advocate of the abolition of slavery\r\n(Independent). The poll was taken in the Castle yard at York in\r\nthirteen booths, which, in accordance with the existing law, were\r\nkept open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for fifteen days. Wilberforce and\r\nMilton were returned. The total number of electors polled was 23,007,\r\nand the three candidates spent between them £300,000, or about £13\r\nfor each vote polled. Wilberforce’s bill ran into £58,000, which had\r\nto be defrayed by public subscription. A good deal of this money went\r\ninto the pockets of the electors. Therefore it is hardly surprising\r\nto read in the debates on the Reform Bill of 1832 the contention\r\nadvanced that a seat in the House was private property, that the\r\npossession of a vote was a source of income, and consequently that\r\nto take one or the other from a man without compensation, by the\r\nabolition of small boroughs and fancy franchises, was as much robbery\r\nas to deprive a fundholder of his dividends, or a landlord of his\r\nrents.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nAll this but emphasizes the purity of the wooing of the electors\r\nto-day. The various stringent Acts against bribery and corruption\r\ncarried in the latter half of the nineteenth century have not been\r\npassed in vain. In 1854 bribery was made a criminal offence by the\r\nCorrupt Practices Prevention Act. Election petitions by defeated\r\ncandidates claiming seats on the ground that there had been corrupt\r\npractices were formerly tried by committees of the House of Commons.\r\nOften the decisions were partisan, and directly in the teeth of the\r\nevidence. Yet the House of Commons for centuries so jealously guarded\r\nits own jurisdiction over all matters relating to the election of\r\nits members that it rejected proposals of a judicial tribunal. At\r\nlength in 1868 the Parliamentary Elections Act was passed, and since\r\nthen two Judges of the King’s Bench Division try petitions, and\r\nreport the result to the Speaker. After the General Election of 1880\r\nthere were no fewer than ninety-five petitions impugning returns\r\non various grounds, including bribery, intimidation, personation\r\nof dead or absent voters, and most of them were sustained. After\r\nthe General Election of 1885 there was not a single petition.\r\nBetween these electoral contests a statute was passed—the Corrupt\r\nand Illegal Practices Prevention Act of 1883—which has done much to\r\nmake parliamentary elections pure. Its main purpose was the fixing\r\nof a maximum scale of electioneering expenditure, varying in amount\r\naccording to the character and extent of the constituency, and each\r\ncandidate was required to make a statement of his expenses to the\r\nreturning officer within thirty-five days after the contest. The\r\nexpenditure of an election—other than the personal expenses of the\r\ncandidate and the returning officers’ charges—was limited by this\r\nAct in England and Scotland to £350 for the first 2,000 electors\r\nin boroughs, and £650 for the first 2,000 electors in counties,\r\nwith accretions of £30 in the case of boroughs, and £60 in the case\r\nof counties, for every additional 1,000 electors. The personal\r\nexpenses of a candidate were confined to £100. The General Election\r\nof 1880—the last election in which expenditure within the law was\r\npractically unlimited, and, as the disclosures in the hearing of\r\nthe petitions showed, was most excessive—cost the candidates over\r\n£2,000,000, or about 15s. for each vote polled. The General Election\r\nof 1885, the first held under the Corrupt Practices Act of 1883, cost\r\nonly £1,026,646, or 4s. 5d. per vote. The tendency of the expenditure\r\nis still downwards. Under the Representation of the People Act, 1918,\r\nthe expenses of a candidate must not exceed an amount equal to 7d.\r\nfor each elector on the register, in the case of counties, and 5d. in\r\nthe case of boroughs, exclusive of personal expenses. The fee paid\r\nto the election agent must not exceed £75 in counties and £50 in\r\nboroughs.\r\n\r\nStill, the question is sometimes asked in all seriousness: Is\r\nelectioneering really any purer now than it was in the days before\r\nthe first Reform Act? It is admitted that seats in the House of\r\nCommons are no longer openly purchased, that individual voters are\r\nno longer directly bribed. But it is said that the old blunt and\r\nbarefaced forms of corruption have simply given place to newer and\r\nsubtler methods of bribery, which are just as dishonourable to\r\nthose who give and those who take. A candidate does not now buy a\r\nconstituency; he “nurses” it. In other words, he tries to secure\r\nthe good will and support of the electors by subscriptions and\r\ndonations for various local objects. Against this practice, with\r\nits many by-ways of expenditure, there is no law. The objects for\r\nwhich money is thus spent divide themselves into two classes—religion\r\nand philanthropy, sport and amusements. Is a peal of bells required\r\nfor the parish church? Does the chapel aspire to a steeple? Is a\r\nbilliard-table wanted by the young men’s society? Are coal and\r\nblankets needed by the poor during the winter? The open-handed\r\ncandidate is only waiting for a hint in order to supply the necessary\r\ncheque. Then there are football and cricket clubs to which the\r\ncandidate is expected to give financial assistance. And give it\r\nhe does gladly, for, as he says, it is the duty of public men to\r\nencourage national sports and pastimes. If the stories one hears be\r\ntrue, it would seem, indeed, as if the old tradition that a vote is a\r\nsaleable commodity, and that parliamentary elections are held, not so\r\nmuch that the country may be governed in accordance with the wishes\r\nof the people as that the constituency may profit financially in\r\none way or another by the return of a representative, still to some\r\nextent survives. It is even said that impudent individual demands are\r\nmade on the purse of the candidate. They range from five shillings\r\nfor getting a voter’s clothes or tools out of pawn to a five-pound\r\nnote for sending an invalid supporter to the seaside.\r\n\r\nBut these attempts to blackmail the candidate are, when all is said\r\nand done, exceedingly rare. According as the franchise has been\r\nbroadened, as the property qualification for the vote has been\r\nreduced, the purer have elections become. This is due to some extent\r\npartly to the fear of the law against corrupt and illegal practices,\r\nand partly to the size of the constituencies, which are now so large\r\nthat the purchase of a sufficient number of votes to decide the issue\r\nis beyond the capacity of most purses. But I think it is more due to\r\nthe sturdy pride and self-respect of the new electors, the working\r\nclasses generally, as well as their sense of public duty, which have\r\nput an end to the old petitional extension of hands for doles in\r\nreturn for votes. Happily, there is no gainsaying the seriousness\r\nand responsibility with which, on the whole, the franchise is now\r\nexercised. Taking them all in all, the voters go to the polling\r\nbooths animated by a fine public spirit—respect for the Constitution,\r\ndevotion to the State—which it is not too much to say is aroused and\r\nkept purely aflame by their different political convictions, anti\r\nwithout a thought of individual gain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Party organization makes a representative largely\r\nindependent, not only of the local whims and caprices of his\r\nconstituency, but of any section of the electors who may look\r\nfor favours in return for their support. The representative may\r\noccasionally be hard pressed by local interests, but as a rule\r\nthese are regarded as subsidiary to Party considerations, to the\r\nsupreme purpose of each Party to obtain control of the machinery\r\nof Government. Therefore the secret of success in the wooing\r\nof the electors to-day is not the distribution of blankets or\r\nbilliard-tables. It might perhaps be said that it is not even wit,\r\nwisdom and eloquence in the candidate—though, of course, these\r\npossessions greatly count—much less complete independence of Party\r\nin public affairs. It is adherence to one Party ticket or the\r\nother; it is agreement with the Party opinions of the majority of\r\nthe constituency. The victorious candidate does not always owe his\r\nelection to his personal success in turning the majority of the\r\nvoters round to his side. As a rule, his election means simply that\r\nhe has had the good fortune to present himself to a constituency\r\nwhich, in the main, was already in agreement with his political\r\nopinions. And instead of five-pound notes, he is expected to\r\ndistribute only Party promises and pledges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA NEW PARLIAMENT IN THE MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n“Register, register, register!” Such was the emphasized advice which\r\nSir Robert Peel gave to his Tory followers so long ago as 1837. At\r\nthat time Party organization as we now understand it was unknown, and\r\neach elector had to see for himself that he got on the register. The\r\nmotto of all political Parties in these days of thorough organization\r\nis more than ever, “Register, register, register!” For when the\r\nGeneral Election comes the fate of Parties is decided beforehand\r\nby the extent to which their respective adherents have got on the\r\nregister of voters. The Party complexion of the successful candidate\r\nin any constituency is always a reflection of the predominant\r\npolitical colour of the register of voters.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the register of voters, which was first provided\r\nfor by the Reform Act of 1832, is the duty of the local authorities,\r\nand is discharged, under the Representation of the People Act,\r\n1918, at the public expense, one-half being paid out of the local\r\nrates and the other out of the National Exchequer. The registration\r\nofficers are the town clerk in borough divisions, and the clerk of\r\nthe county council in county divisions. The qualifications for a vote\r\nare, for men, twenty-one years of age and six months’ residence as a\r\nhouseholder or lodger, or occupation of business premises; and for\r\nwomen, thirty years of age, possessing herself the local government\r\nfranchise by reason of six months’ ownership or tenancy of land or\r\npremises in her own right, or being the wife of a local government\r\nelector. Voters’ lists are first compiled by the registration\r\nofficers from the rate-books, supplemented by a house-to-house\r\ninquiry to get the names of householders whose rates are paid\r\nthrough the landlord and of persons qualified as wives or lodgers.\r\nPrinted copies of these provisional or draft lists are exhibited\r\nfor public reference in the town or county halls, post offices,\r\npublic libraries, and at the doors of churches and chapels in each\r\nconstituency. This is done to afford all concerned an opportunity of\r\nseeing whether they are on the lists, and, if necessary, of giving\r\nnotice to the returning officer of claims to make corrections or\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nIt is curious what little attention is given to these huge and\r\nunwieldy bundles of printed matter. Few voters are moved to examine\r\nthem. Small boys take a real interest in them, and that is usually\r\nof an impish and destructive kind. Otherwise the lists are too\r\noften left neglected. The average man apparently never troubles\r\nhimself about his vote until a contest arises in his constituency\r\nor the General Election approaches. There seems to be in his mind\r\nthe supposition that it is the duty of some person or some body—he\r\nfrequently knows not who or what—to see that he shall be in the\r\nposition to vote when the time comes for the exercise of this\r\nprivilege of his citizenship. And in a sense the average man is\r\nright. There is a person keenly anxious that he should get the vote\r\nto which he is entitled—the local agent of the Conservative, Liberal,\r\nor Labour Party.\r\n\r\nTo this most important branch of political work the central offices\r\nof the great political organizations give the closest attention. At\r\none time large sums of money were spent in registration, provided\r\npartly from the funds of the central offices, and partly by the\r\nsitting Members, to maintain their interest, as it was called, or\r\nby prospective candidates of other politics who were “nursing”\r\nconstituencies. No sooner did a stranger come to reside in a\r\nconstituency—especially where Parties are somewhat evenly balanced,\r\nand where, in consequence, the rival Party organizations were highly\r\nactive—than he was waited upon by the Party canvassers to ascertain\r\nhis political opinions. The local organization of the Party to which\r\nhe gave adhesion saw that his name duly appeared on the register of\r\nvoters. That is so to some extent yet, though it is not carried to\r\nthe same degree of Party competition as formerly. The Representation\r\nof the People Act, 1918, lifted registration above being a mere\r\nwrangle between rival political agents over the body of the claimant\r\nto a vote, by establishing the principle that it was the business of\r\nthe State to see that every qualified person was put on the register\r\nof voters, despite the disfranchising activity of the Party agents\r\nand the ignorance or apathy of the individual citizen. Each Party now\r\nconfines its operations to seeing that qualified voters of its own\r\npolitical colour are put on the register and kept there. And it must\r\nbe said that as the result of their competing watchfulness a register\r\nas complete and accurate as possible is usually obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Representation of the People Act, 1918, also reformed the\r\nprocedure of the courts for correcting and amending the voters’ lists\r\nand passing them finally as the register of voters. Formerly these\r\ncourts were presided over by revising barristers who were lawyers of\r\nnot less than seven years’ standing appointed by the senior Judge\r\nof the summer assizes for the constituencies within his circuit,\r\nand were paid 200 guineas each for deciding claims and objections.\r\nThe political Parties used to be represented in the revision courts\r\nby their agents, who left nothing undone to put on the register as\r\nmany as possible of their own supporters, and to put off as many as\r\npossible of their opponents. Since 1918 the revision of the lists has\r\nbeen done by the town clerks, or the clerks of the county councils,\r\nas registration officers. I saw some of the reformed revision\r\ncourts at work in London for the first time in 1918. The procedure\r\nwas quite simple. The town clerk sat at the head of the table with\r\nthe voters’ lists before him, and the overseer by his side to help\r\nhim in his duties. At the table also were the agents of the local\r\nParty organizations. The lists were gone through. Errors in the\r\nspelling of names or the numbering of residences were corrected;\r\nduplicate entries were struck out. It was all done smoothly and\r\nrapidly. There was none of the old contention between the Party\r\nagents for the insertion of this name or the omission of that which\r\nI frequently had to listen to in the old revision courts. Claims\r\nwere numerous, and the disposition was to allow them. On the other\r\nhand, the objections were few, and were mostly formal. When the full\r\nregister of voters for each division is printed a copy is to be\r\nseen and consulted at the office of the registration officer of the\r\ndivision—the town hall or the county council hall. The part of the\r\nregister relating to each unit of the division, ward, or district is\r\nhung in local post offices, the public libraries and church porches.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nEverything is now in readiness for the dissolution of Parliament. The\r\ntwo Houses of Lords and Commons are dissolved by Royal Proclamation\r\nissued by the King “by and with the advice of Our Privy Council”\r\n(which means the Ministers) and under the Great Seal of the United\r\nKingdom. In order to keep the existence of Parliament as nearly\r\ncontinuous as possible, a new Parliament is summoned at the same\r\nmoment that the old is dissolved. Hence in the Royal Proclamation the\r\nSovereign declares his desire to meet as soon as may be his people,\r\nand to have their advice in Parliament, and accordingly requires the\r\nLord Chancellors of Great Britain and Ireland to issue forthwith the\r\nwrits for causing the Lords spiritual and temporal and Commons who\r\nare to serve in the said Parliament to be duly returned and give\r\ntheir attendance. Thereupon the machinery of a General Election is\r\nput into motion by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery (an officer of\r\nthe Crown in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor in Parliament, with\r\noffices in the precincts of the House of Lords), and does not cease\r\nworking until the two Houses are again constituted and in session.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of writs are issued from the Crown Office. There\r\nare the writs of summons to attend in Parliament, which are sent\r\nto the temporal and spiritual peers. There are three classes of\r\npeerages which carry an hereditary right to a seat in the House of\r\nLords—peerages of England created before 1707; peerages of Great\r\nBritain, created between the Union with Scotland in 1707 and the\r\nUnion with Ireland in 1801; and peerages of the United Kingdom\r\ncreated since 1801. The twenty-six Bishops who hold peerages by right\r\nof office and the twenty-eight Irish representative peers who are\r\nelected for life by the peerage of Ireland also receive writs, but\r\nsixteen Scottish representative peers elected for each Parliament\r\nby the peerage of Scotland assembled at Holyrood House, Edinburgh,\r\ndo not. However, the writs with which we are now more particularly\r\nconcerned are those for the election of the Commons of Great Britain.\r\nThey are sent by the Clerk of the Crown to the returning officers\r\nof the constituencies—in county areas the sheriffs, in urban areas\r\nthe mayor or chairman of the borough council—commanding them, in the\r\nname of the King, to “cause election to be made according to law” of\r\nMembers to serve in the new Parliament; and “to cause the names of\r\nsuch Members, when so elected, whether they be present or absent, to\r\nbe certified to us in Our Chancery without delay.” The writs for a\r\nGeneral Election are, in fact, always prepared in the Crown Office\r\nand ready to be issued in case there might be any sudden dissolution\r\nof Parliament before it has run its prescribed term of five years.\r\nThey are printed on parchment in imitation copper-plate handwriting,\r\nwith blanks for names and dates to be filled in by a penman, and are\r\noblong in shape, about 15 inches across by 12 inches in length.\r\n\r\nYears ago the transmission of the writs was a dignified and onerous\r\nand also a profitable duty. Messengers of the Great Seal, as they\r\nwere called, were despatched through the country post-haste with\r\nthe writs for personal delivery to the returning officers, and they\r\ncollected five guineas for a writ for a borough and ten guineas for a\r\nwrit for a city or a county. Under this system grave irregularities\r\nprevailed. Candidates schemed to get early possession of the writs\r\nin order to forestall, by hastening the election, any threatened\r\nopposition; and the Messengers of the Great Seal, it was said, were\r\ndisposed to give a writ to the candidate who would pay most for it.\r\nBut an Act passed in 1813 provided for the conveyance and delivery of\r\nthe writs through the prosaic but purer agency of the Post Office.\r\nPrecautions are taken to avoid any chance of their going astray.\r\nThey are placed in envelopes of strong cartridge paper with a lining\r\nof glazed calico, each addressed to the respective returning officer,\r\nand are conveyed to the General Post Office, London, by one of the\r\nclerks of the Crown Office, designated for this occasion, “Messenger\r\nof the Great Seal,” who receives from an official appointed by\r\nthe Postmaster-General a written acknowledgment of the delivery\r\nof his precious charge. The writs are then despatched through the\r\nfirst available post as registered letters. With each there is sent\r\nan injunction to the postmaster of the place where the returning\r\nofficer resides to have the writ safely and speedily delivered, and\r\nto get a receipt from the returning officer. This receipt the local\r\npostmaster transmits to the Postmaster-General, who in turn has the\r\nparticulars entered in a book which is available for inspection by\r\nany person interested. In what is known as the London Metropolitan\r\narea, extending into four counties—Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and\r\nEssex—personal service of the writs to the returning officers of the\r\ndivisions by the Messenger of the Great Seal is still in vogue, the\r\nmessenger travelling in a motor-car instead of on horseback, and\r\ndemanding no fees for his services.\r\n\r\nNomination day is the same in all constituencies, as provided by the\r\nRepresentation of the People Act, 1918. On the day appointed, the\r\neighth day after the date of the Royal Proclamation, the returning\r\nofficer attends at the municipal buildings, or the courthouse,\r\nwithin certain fixed hours—usually from 10 a.m. till noon—to receive\r\nnominations of candidates. The nomination paper sets out the name,\r\nabode, profession or calling of the candidate, and the names and\r\naddresses of two registered electors, who propose and second him,\r\nand of eight other assenting burgesses. Each candidate provides\r\nhimself with several nomination papers, filled up by electors from\r\nvarious classes or sections of the constituency, with a view to\r\nshow the representative character of his supporters, and also to\r\nsecure himself from the risk of the nomination being declared null\r\nand void by the returning officer owing to some irregularity in\r\nthe original nomination paper. The Ballot Act requires that the\r\nnomination paper must be handed in to the returning officer by the\r\ncandidate personally, or by his proposer or seconder. At one election\r\nthe nomination paper was given in by the agent of the candidate, and\r\nthis was held to be fatal to the nomination. It was a small technical\r\npoint, and since then it has come to be understood generally by\r\nagents of all Parties that no advantage is to be taken of such slips\r\nor oversights.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nMembership of the House of Commons is remarkably free and\r\nunrestricted. Under the American Constitution it is necessary for a\r\nMember of Congress—whether he sits in the House of Representatives or\r\nin the Senate—to reside in the state by which he is returned. There\r\nis no such rule in the case of Members of Parliament. It was provided\r\nby a statute of Henry V that “knights of the shires and citizens and\r\nburgesses should be dwelling and resident” within the constituencies\r\nthey represented. But this residential qualification had been evaded\r\nor fallen into disuse long before 1620, when a committee of the House\r\nof Commons recommended its abolition. It was not formally repealed,\r\nhowever, until 1774. The Act (14 Geo. III, C. 58) declared that the\r\nlaws as to residence, passed in the fifteenth century, “have been\r\nfound by long usage to be unnecessary and have become obsolete”; and\r\nin order to “obviate all doubt that may arise upon the same” it was\r\nordered that the statute book should be cleared of all enactments\r\nrelating “to the residence of persons to be elected to serve in\r\nParliament.”\r\n\r\nIn view of the common interests of the country and its complete\r\ncoherence in social and economic life, it would be idle to limit\r\nthe electors in their choice of representatives to local residents.\r\nMoreover, such a restriction would tend to the exclusion from\r\nParliament of able and distinguished men whose reputation is national\r\nrather than local. But one regrettable result of this freedom of\r\nselection is that the varying idiosyncrasies of the different parts\r\nof the country are no longer reflected, distinctly and sharply, in\r\nthe House of Commons. The representatives are not, in many cases,\r\nracy of the soil of their constituencies. Each of them is not\r\npermeated with the spirit of the place for which he sits—thinking\r\nits local thought, speaking its dialect, having its accent on his\r\ntongue. A man with an Irish brogue may sit for a London constituency.\r\nA South of England man may represent the northernmost constituency\r\nin Scotland. This typical Yorkshireman finds a seat in the West\r\nof England; that unmistakable Devon man speaks for a place in\r\nLancashire. The manufacturer is returned by an agricultural county;\r\nthe country squire by an industrial borough. It is true that in\r\nthe main the representatives of Wales and Scotland are essentially\r\nWelsh and Scottish, though less so with respect to Scotland than\r\nwith respect to the other Celtic fringe. The English membership,\r\nwhich constitutes the vast bulk of the House, is also strong in\r\nEnglish characteristics; but the views, feelings and interests of a\r\nparticular locality are seldom expressed in its voice and with its\r\nmanner by its representative. Though a local man is still supposed to\r\nbe, more or less, a strong candidate, in truth local representation\r\nin Parliament is fast losing its local character and ceasing to\r\nhave any local purpose at all under the operation of the Caucus,\r\nor the system of rigidly organized political Parties. Members of\r\nParliament are no longer chosen specially to safeguard the local\r\ninterests of their constituencies. Their chief purpose is to have the\r\ncountry governed and administered by the light of their political\r\nprinciples. This Member is said to sit for Hodgeshire, that other\r\nfor Cottonopolis. What they really represent, generally speaking, is\r\nthe Conservative Central Office, or the Liberal Central Office, or\r\nthe Labour Executive. But while membership of the House of Commons\r\nis now thoroughly political, it is, for that very reason, also\r\nthoroughly national. “Every Member, though chosen by one particular\r\ndistrict, when elected and returned serves for the whole Realm.” So\r\nwrote Blackstone, in his _Commentaries on the Laws of England_, about\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. It was, then, perhaps, but a\r\npious aspiration. It is now undoubtedly an accomplished fact, at\r\nleast in the sense that the representative serves for the whole Realm\r\naccording to the political principles which he is returned to uphold.\r\n\r\nThe property qualifications which formerly made a seat in the House\r\nof Commons the privilege of the rich were abolished in 1858. At no\r\ntime was it possible for any man but a man of substantial means to\r\ngain access to the House. But it was not till 1711, in the reign of\r\nQueen Anne, that an Act was passed providing that all Members—except\r\nthe eldest sons of peers and the representatives of the Universities\r\nand of Scottish constituencies—must possess an income from land to\r\nthe extent of £600 a year in the case of a knight of the shire, and\r\nof £300 a year in the case of a citizen of a city and a burgess\r\nof a borough—the three classes into which Members of the House of\r\nCommons were then divided. The enactment was designed to perpetuate\r\nthe ascendancy in the House of Commons of the country or Tory Party,\r\nwhich they themselves feared was being threatened by the rich\r\nmanufacturers and traders who were being returned by the cities and\r\ntowns. Swift described it in the _Examiner_ as “the greatest security\r\nthat was ever contrived for preserving the Constitution, which\r\notherwise might in a little time be wholly at the mercy of the monied\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\nThe law, however, was evaded frequently by fictitious conveyances\r\nof property. Any candidate could be required to make a declaration\r\nbefore the returning officer that he possessed the necessary amount\r\nof income from land on the application of his rival or of any two\r\nelectors; and, in order to be ready for this emergency, should it\r\narise, it was the custom for landless men to have transferred to\r\nthem by relatives or friends on the eve of the election sufficient\r\nlanded property to qualify, which they returned again to the donors\r\nas soon as the election was over. To put a stop to this practice an\r\nAct was passed in 1760, during the reign of George II, by which a\r\nMember, when he came to the Table of the House of Commons to take the\r\noath of allegiance and sign the roll, had not only to swear that he\r\npossessed £600 a year or £300 a year from land—according as he was a\r\nknight of the shire or a citizen or burgess—but to provide the Clerk\r\nwith a schedule setting out in detail the situation and extent of the\r\nqualifying property. Even so, membership of the House of Commons was\r\nnot restricted to the genuine possessors of landed estate. Temporary\r\ntransfers of property in land notoriously went on all the same. The\r\nonly difference was that the transfer was now not for the election\r\nonly but for the life of the Parliament. Landed relatives or friends\r\nwere still accommodating. The rich but landless man could obtain\r\nfrom his bank a rent-charge on some of the landed property which\r\nit possessed in the way of business; and for the man with no great\r\nbalance at his bankers there were attorneys ready to provide him with\r\nthe qualification for a fee of 100 guineas. It was well known that\r\nthose brilliant parliamentarians, Burke, Pitt, Fox and Sheridan, were\r\nthus fictitiously qualified one way or another.\r\n\r\nBut why should the property qualification be restricted to incomes\r\nfrom real estate? Why should not incomes from personal property\r\nalso qualify? It was inevitable that these questions should be\r\nasked insistently and urgently with the increasing rise of wealthy\r\nmerchants and manufacturers ambitious of taking part in public life.\r\nNevertheless, it was not until 1838—six years after the great Reform\r\nAct, which really opened the doors of the House of Commons to the\r\nmiddle classes—that it was provided by a statute passed by the Whig\r\nParliament that general property or professional incomes should also\r\nserve to qualify. In all other respects the law remained unchanged.\r\nThe county Member had still to have an income of £600 a year, the\r\nborough Member had still to have an income of £300 a year, and both\r\nwere still required to swear to their qualifications at the Table of\r\nthe House and supply particulars to the Clerk.\r\n\r\nTwenty years elapsed before the property test for the House of\r\nCommons was finally abolished. The year before—that is to say, in\r\n1857—there was a painful parliamentary scandal in connection with\r\nthe property qualification. The return of Edward Auchmuty Glover for\r\nBeverley was petitioned against, and as the result of the trial the\r\nelection was declared void on the ground that he was not possessed\r\nof the qualifying income. Glover was, by order of the House, tried\r\nat the Old Bailey for having made a false declaration at the Table\r\nthat he was qualified. The jury convicted, but recommended the\r\nprisoner to mercy, as this was the first prosecution for such\r\nan offence, and as it was notorious that declarations as to the\r\npossession of the property qualification were loosely made by\r\nMembers of Parliament. A sentence of three-months’ imprisonment as\r\na first-class misdemeanant was, however, imposed. In the following\r\nyear Locke King—a private Member who cleared the statute book of many\r\nobsolete measures—introduced a Bill for the abolition of the property\r\nqualification, which, though it encountered considerable opposition\r\nin both Houses, went through; and since June, 1858, the penniless\r\nman, as well as the landless man, has been eligible for membership of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFrom this arises a constitutional anomaly which appears strange\r\nindeed. A pauper without a penny in the world, homeless and voteless,\r\nmay be elected a Member of Parliament, while only a man of property\r\nand position, to the extent at least of being a householder or a\r\nlodger of six months’ standing, and a payer of poor rate, directly\r\nor indirectly, is qualified to vote for a Member of Parliament.\r\nMr. Joseph Chamberlain, in a speech on the franchise laws which I\r\nheard him make in the House of Commons in 1895, gave a striking\r\nillustration of the absurdity to which the law in practice led. He\r\nsaid that his son, Austen Chamberlain, who gave him the pleasure of\r\nhis society by residing with him, being neither a householder nor\r\na lodger, was not entitled to the vote; and yet the law not only\r\nallowed his disfranchised son to sit in the House of Commons but to\r\nbecome a Member of the Government, he being at the time Civil Lord\r\nof the Admiralty. Mr. Austin Chamberlain was subsequently appointed\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, the greatest and most responsible post\r\nin the Government next to that of the Prime Minister; and in the\r\nyears he was the head of the Department controlling the raising\r\nand expenditure of the national taxation—being still unmarried and\r\nresiding with his father—his name was not to be found on the burgess\r\nrolls of the Kingdom in respect of any rating qualification. I find\r\nthat in the General Election of 1906 Mr. Austen Chamberlain voted in\r\nthe City of London as a liveryman of the Cordwainers’ Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain disqualifications for Membership of the\r\nHouse of Commons. Aliens cannot compete for a seat. The candidate\r\nmust either be a natural born British subject or a naturalized\r\nforeigner. Colonials and native Indians are, of course, eligible.\r\nBut any British subject may not be nominated. The candidate must\r\nbe of the age of twenty-one years. Yet the production of a birth\r\ncertificate is not required by the returning officer. There are at\r\nleast two notable instances of “infants” having sat in the House of\r\nCommons. Charles James Fox was returned for Midhurst before he was\r\ntwenty, and Lord John Russell for Tavistock before he was twenty-one.\r\nMental imbecility is a disqualification. It would, perhaps, be too\r\nmuch to say that the candidate is required to be of sound mind and\r\nunderstanding, but he must not obviously be a lunatic or idiot. If\r\nhe should lose his senses after election his case is provided for\r\nby “An Act to amend the law in regard to the vacating of seats in\r\nthe House of Commons,” which was passed in 1886. It enacts that if a\r\nMember is committed as a lunatic to any asylum it is the duty of the\r\nmedical doctor who made the committal and the superintendent of the\r\nasylum to report the case without delay to the Speaker. The Speaker\r\nthen directs the Commissioners of Lunacy to examine the Member,\r\nand if they report that the Member is of unsound mind six months\r\nare allowed to elapse, when they again examine and report, and if\r\nthey still find the Member insane the two reports are laid on the\r\nTable of the House, and the seat thereby becomes vacant. Blindness\r\nis not a disqualification—not even for the Treasury Bench. There\r\nis the remarkable case of Mr. Henry Fawcett, who, in spite of this\r\ngreat physical disability, sat for Hackney, was Postmaster-General\r\nin the Gladstone Administration of 1880, and was the originator of\r\nthe postal order, parcel post, and Post Office annuities. Are deaf\r\nand dumb persons disqualified by reason of their physical defects?\r\nThey are said to be, but as there is no case in point, the matter is\r\nsomewhat in doubt.\r\n\r\nEnglish peers and peers of Great Britain and the United Kingdom are\r\nineligible for election to the House of Commons, being, of course,\r\nhereditary Members of the House of Lords. The second Lord Selborne\r\nsat as Lord Wolmer in the House of Commons for West Edinburgh, when,\r\non the death of his father in 1895, he succeeded to the peerage.\r\nAs he desired to remain in the House of Commons, he raised the\r\npoint that a peer, as such, was not debarred from sitting in that\r\nHouse until he received his writ of summons to the other House as\r\na Lord of Parliament, and declared his intention to be not to make\r\nthe necessary application for such writ of summons. The House of\r\nCommons appointed a Select Committee to inquire into the matter, and\r\non their report that Lord Wolmer had succeeded to a peerage of the\r\nUnited Kingdom the constituency of West Edinburgh was declared to\r\nbe vacant, and a new writ was at once issued for the election of a\r\nMember for the seat. It is the succession to a peerage, and not the\r\nreceipt of the writ of summons to the House of Lords, which is held\r\nto disqualify for membership of the House of Commons. Scottish peers\r\nare also precluded. Even those outside the sixteen representative\r\npeers of Scotland—elected by the general body of the Scottish peerage\r\nto sit for each Parliament in the House of Lords—are ineligible for\r\nelection to the House of Commons. The Irish peerage is not under this\r\npolitical disability. By the Act of Union between Great Britain and\r\nIreland an Irish peer—providing he is not one of the twenty-eight\r\nIrish representative peers elected by the general body of the Irish\r\npeerage to sit for life in the House of Lords—may be returned by any\r\nconstituency in England or Scotland. But he is disqualified for an\r\nIrish seat. The most famous instance was that of Lord Palmerston,\r\nwho was an Irish peer and sat in the House of Commons for an English\r\nconstituency for close on sixty years.\r\n\r\nClergymen of the Church of England, of the Church of Scotland, and\r\nRoman Catholic priests are disqualified. The statutory exclusion of\r\nclergymen from the House of Commons dates from the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century. Until then the question was involved in doubt and\r\nuncertainty. It was first raised in a concrete form by the return of\r\nthe famous Radical parson, Horne Tooke, in 1801 for the nomination\r\nborough of Old Sarum. He held no benefice in the Church, but as in\r\nlaw he was still a clerk in Holy Orders it was contended that he\r\nwas ineligible. A Select Committee appointed to inquire into the\r\nprecedents reported that they were not sufficiently clear to warrant\r\nthe exclusion of Tooke; but though he was, accordingly, allowed to\r\nretain his seat, an Act was immediately passed which closed the doors\r\nof the House of Commons to clergymen of the Established Church and\r\nministers of the Church of Scotland. Church of England parsons who,\r\nunder the provisions of the Clerical Disabilities Act of 1870, divest\r\nthemselves of their Orders become thereby eligible for election, and\r\nseveral ex-clergymen have sat in the House of Commons. Roman Catholic\r\npriests are expressly incapacitated by a clause of the Emancipation\r\nAct of 1829, which admitted Roman Catholic laymen to Parliament. The\r\nAct of 1801 does not apply to ministers of dissenting Churches, and\r\nthey therefore are qualified to sit in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOffice of various kinds is a disqualification. Judges of the High\r\nCourt and county court judges are ineligible. In the time of the\r\nStuarts a resolution of the House of Commons precluded Judges of\r\nthe High Court from sitting in Parliament. During the Commonwealth,\r\nwhen the House of Lords was abolished, Sir Matthew Hale and other\r\ndistinguished Judges sat in the House of Commons. It was not until\r\nthe passing of the Judicature Act, 1875, that Judges of the High\r\nCourt came under a statutory disability to sit in the House of\r\nCommons. County court judges had already been precluded by an Act\r\npassed in 1847. A Recorder may sit in the House of Commons, but not\r\nfor the city or borough in which he exercises his jurisdiction in\r\ncriminal matters. The civil servants on the permanent staff of the\r\nvarious Departments of Government are debarred from sitting in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Yet commissioned officers of the Army and Navy\r\nare qualified. But Army officers become M.P.’s at the sacrifice of\r\nhalf their pay, though they remain on the active list. Government\r\ncontractors for work to be done or goods to be supplied in the public\r\nservice are ineligible. No returning officer may stand for the place\r\nwhere he is commanded by writ from the Crown Office to hold an\r\nelection. A bankrupt is disqualified. He may be nominated, but if\r\nelected he cannot sit.\r\n\r\nBut though all property qualifications have been abolished, the\r\naspirant for a seat in Parliament must have money in his purse,\r\nor raise it from some other source. The expenses of the returning\r\nofficer for the provision of polling stations and the fee for his\r\nofficial services were formerly paid by the candidates. If there was\r\nno contest, the candidate on nomination paid £25. In the event of a\r\ncontest the charges were considerably higher. They ran in boroughs\r\nfrom £100 up to £700, and in counties from £150 to £1,000, according\r\nto the number of electors on the register, and were apportioned\r\nequally between the candidates. As provided by the Representation of\r\nthe People Act, 1918, the returning officer’s expenses are now paid\r\nby the Treasury. But each candidate must deposit with his nomination\r\npaper a sum of £150, which is returned to him if he wins as soon\r\nas he has taken the oath as a Member of Parliament, and even if he\r\nloses, provided he obtains more than one-eighth of the votes polled.\r\nIn all other cases the deposit is, as the Act says, “forfeited to\r\nHis Majesty,” save in University elections, where it is retained by\r\nthe University. This provision was designed to discourage “freak”\r\ncandidatures. It costs more to lose than to win an election.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nPolling at a General Election is held on the one day. It is the\r\nninth day after nomination day, as provided by the Representation\r\nof the People Act, 1918. Before the day of polling a group of men\r\nwait upon the returning officer of the constituency. They are\r\nusually rate-collectors or other officials of the local municipal\r\nbodies. Vested by the returning officer with his authority and\r\nresponsibilities, they are to represent him in the polling booths.\r\nEach booth is in charge of a presiding officer, and he is allowed a\r\npoll clerk for every 500, or part of 500, electors on his section\r\nof the register of voters. The presiding officer and their clerks\r\nmust not have been employed in any capacity by any of the candidates\r\nduring a contest.\r\n\r\nEach presiding officer and poll clerk signs a declaration in which\r\nhe undertakes to maintain and to aid in maintaining the secrecy of\r\nthe voting. They are also told that for any breach of faith in this\r\nrespect they are liable to six months’ imprisonment with hard labour.\r\nMore than that, another section of the Ballot Act is read by the\r\nreturning officer which states that if they supply a ballot paper to\r\nany unauthorized person, or fraudulently put into the ballot box any\r\npaper but the official ballot paper, or destroy any ballot paper, or\r\nopen, or in any way tamper with the ballot box, they are liable to\r\nimprisonment for any term not exceeding two years. “I hope none of\r\nyou gentlemen will get it,” adds the returning officer, indulging in\r\nthe time-honoured joke of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe returning officer may use as a polling booth, free of charge, the\r\nrooms of any school which is in receipt of a parliamentary grant, or\r\nany building maintained out of the local rates. Failing these, he\r\nmay hire any other place, with some important exceptions, such as an\r\ninn or beerhouse—unless by consent of all the candidates given in\r\nwriting—or a church, chapel, or other place of public worship. The\r\npolling booth must be opened at eight o’clock in the morning on the\r\nday of the election. It is the duty of the presiding officer and his\r\nclerks to be there at least a quarter of an hour earlier. The ballot\r\nbox—made of steel, enamelled in black, with a slot in the lid—is\r\nalready in the booth. The presiding officer finds inside the box the\r\nballot papers, also pencils, pens, blotting-paper, drawing pins,\r\nred tape and sealing-wax, and copies of the Old and New Testament\r\nfor administering the oath should occasion for it arise. There are\r\nalso copies of so much of the register of voters as applies to the\r\ndistrict for which the polling booth is intended. He also finds\r\nin the box that which is guarded with the most jealous care—the\r\nofficial mark for the stamping of the ballot papers. The returning\r\nofficer is bound to keep the form of this stamp absolutely secret\r\nuntil the morning of the poll. It must not be a stamp that has been\r\nused at elections for the same constituency during the preceding\r\nseven years. This official mark may consist of any device—a letter\r\nof the alphabet, a cross, or a circle—which can be stamped upon the\r\nballot paper. No ballot paper without this identification is counted.\r\nOwing to these precautions it is absolutely impossible for ballot\r\npapers to be surreptitiously printed, marked in favour of one of the\r\ncandidates, and slipped into the ballot box as genuine votes. Then\r\nthe presiding officer shows the empty ballot box to those present\r\nin the station in an official capacity, so that they can testify\r\nthat when the polling began there was nothing in it, and proceeds\r\nto lock it and seal it in such a manner that it cannot again be\r\nopened without breaking the seal. The slit of the ballot box must be\r\nso constructed that the voting papers dropped through it cannot be\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nAll is now ready for the polling. In the booth are those only who are\r\nauthorized to be present. Each candidate is represented by a polling\r\nagent to look after his interest. But the complete control of the\r\nbooth lies in the presiding officer, and there are constables present\r\nto carry out his commands. He can have removed from the booth any\r\nperson who misconducts himself or who disputes his lawful orders. He\r\nmay in certain circumstances give a disorderly person into custody.\r\nBut he must be careful that any action he may take does not prevent a\r\nperson entitled to vote from voting.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock sharp the doors of the polling station are opened.\r\nUsually a number of electors are waiting outside, some to compete\r\nfor the empty distinction of recording the first vote, and some\r\nanxious to discharge the task or duty before going about the day’s\r\nbusiness. The official register sets forth the name, address, number,\r\nand qualification of every man and woman in the district entitled\r\nto vote. When the poll clerk is satisfied with the identity of the\r\napplicant, the white ballot paper is stamped with the official mark,\r\nback and front, and handed to the elector, and a short horizontal\r\nline or tick is drawn against his name on the register to show that\r\nhe has voted. The ballot papers are made up like cheque-books, each\r\npaper having a counterfoil, and are numbered consecutively on the\r\nback. As the poll clerk gives a ballot paper to an elector he writes\r\non the counterfoil the elector’s number on the register. Thus the\r\nvote of every elector can be traced should any circumstances arise to\r\nmake this necessary.\r\n\r\nThe voter, provided with the ballot paper, retires to a compartment\r\nwhere, alone and aloof and screened from observation, he or she\r\nplaces his or her two pencil strokes, the simple “X,” and that only,\r\nin the space to the right of the name of the candidate by whom he\r\nor she wishes to be represented in Parliament. Then, folding up the\r\nballot paper so as to conceal the mark, but leaving the official\r\nstamp exposed in order to satisfy the presiding officer or the poll\r\nclerk, by a cursory glance, that it is the genuine paper, the voter\r\ndrops it into the ballot box through the slit in the lid, and with\r\na pleasant sense of self-importance immediately quits the polling\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nBut the polling does not always proceed with this easy and monotonous\r\nregularity. Not infrequently a boisterous elector enters to whom the\r\nsolemnity of the booth or the secrecy of the ballot makes no appeal.\r\n“Your name and address, please,” says the poll clerk. “My name’s\r\nTed Lillywhite, and no mistake, and I live at 70 Carpenter Street,\r\nand don’t you forget it,” answers the elector stiffly. He gets the\r\nballot paper, and without any attempt at concealment makes a big\r\nsprawling cross opposite the name of Smith, and, as he drops the\r\npaper with a flourish into the ballot box, cries: “There! I’ve voted\r\nfor Smith, good man and true, and I’d like all the world to know it.”\r\nAnother man comes in only to find that despite the vigilance of the\r\ncandidates’ polling agents—or, it may be, with the connivance of one\r\nor other of them—someone has already voted in his name. The man is\r\nasked on oath by the presiding officer if he is the person he claims\r\nto be, and if he swears that he is, a pink ballot paper officially\r\nknown as a “tendered vote” is given him. The vote, however, is not\r\nput into the ballot box, but is given to the presiding officer,\r\nwho places it in an envelope specially provided for the purpose.\r\nAll particulars of the voter—name, number on the register, and any\r\nremarks the presiding officer may have to make—are entered on what\r\nis termed the tendered votes list, which is delivered at the close\r\nof the poll to the returning officer. There is also the clumsy voter\r\nwho spoils his ballot paper. The presiding officer may, if it be\r\nproved to his satisfaction that the paper was inadvertently spoiled,\r\ncancel it and supply the voter with another. There is the elector\r\nwho is blind, or has no hands, or is incapacitated by any physical\r\ncause from marking the ballot paper himself. There is the elector who\r\ndeclares his inability to read. There is also the elector who, being\r\na Jew, is precluded by his religious belief from marking his vote\r\nhimself should the polling be on a Saturday, which is his Sabbath.\r\nThese are dealt with alike. The presiding officer, in the presence\r\nof the candidates’ agents, marks the ballot paper in accordance\r\nwith the wishes of the voter and places it in the ballot box. The\r\ngreatest problem of all that confronts the presiding officer is the\r\nrecording of the vote of a deaf and dumb elector who can neither read\r\nnor write. A list of the votes so marked, and the reasons for so\r\nmarking them, must be kept by the presiding officer and supplied to\r\nthe returning officer. The presiding officer may also put questions\r\nto ascertain whether a person who asks for a ballot paper has already\r\nvoted in other constituencies in which he is entitled to vote. A man\r\nmay vote by reason of a residence qualification in one constituency\r\nand give one more vote in another constituency where he is registered\r\nfor a business premises qualification, or as a University elector. A\r\nwoman can vote in only one constituency where she is registered by\r\nvirtue of her own or her husband’s local government qualification,\r\nbut she can vote also at a University, if she is on its register.\r\n\r\nThe poll closes at eight or nine o’clock. Ballot papers cannot be\r\ngiven out after that time. But any voters who have received papers\r\nbefore the hour has struck may put their votes into the ballot\r\nbox. The presiding officer, in the presence of the agents of the\r\ncandidates, then stops up the slot of the ballot box and seals\r\nit, so as to prevent the insertion of any more voting papers. The\r\nballot box, securely locked, bound in red tape and sealed, is then\r\nbrought by the presiding officer to the place appointed for the\r\ncounting of the votes, which is usually the town hall or county\r\nhall, and is delivered up to the returning officer, together with a\r\nstatement in writing of the number of ballot papers supplied to the\r\npolling station, and accounting for them under the heads of “used,”\r\n“unused,” and “spoilt,” and also the counterfoils of the used ballot\r\npapers, the unused ballot papers, the marked copies of the register\r\nof voters, and the list of tendered votes, all of which had been\r\ncarefully made up in separate parcels and sealed before leaving the\r\npolling station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY’S VERDICT\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nHow simple and decorous is a parliamentary election nowadays compared\r\nwith the tumultuous polling when voting was open, before the Ballot\r\nAct of 1872! In remote times an election was decided by a show of\r\nhands at a public meeting of the electors. The right of a candidate\r\nto challenge the decision on a show of hands and demand a poll was\r\nestablished in the reign of James I. However, it continued to be\r\nthe practice for the sheriff or returning officer on the day of\r\nnomination still to ask for a show of hands on behalf of each of the\r\ncandidates, and to declare for the one in whose support the larger\r\nnumber of hands had been uplifted. But as the majority of the crowd\r\nwere usually non-voters, the demand for a poll by the other candidate\r\nfollowed as a matter of course. Formerly the election might last for\r\na month, and the voting stations might be kept open until late into\r\nthe night. Early in the nineteenth century a limit of fifteen days\r\nwas fixed for the polling. The Reform Act of 1832 further reduced the\r\nperiod to two days, and provided also that the voting should take\r\nplace between the hours of nine and four o’clock, with the option of\r\nopening an hour earlier on the second day, if the candidates agreed.\r\n\r\nBut on the polling days—whether forty, fifteen, or two—disorder and\r\nviolence were common throughout the country at the General Election.\r\nIndeed, one of the first acts of a candidate was to have organized\r\na mob of bludgeon men to protect himself and his adherents during\r\nthe campaign, and also, of course, to intimidate the supporters of\r\nhis opponent. Between the rival mobs the constituency was kept in a\r\nstate of excitement and uproar during the polling. The most trying\r\npart of the contest was the ordeal of the hustings. These were\r\ntemporary platforms erected in the square, at the market cross, or\r\nin some other open place of the borough or chief county town, where\r\nthe candidates were proposed and seconded. The speeches were usually\r\nlittle better than mere dumb show. Each of the rival politicians\r\nmade determined but usually vain efforts to convince the shrieking\r\nmob, amid showers of stones, mud, rotten eggs and dead cats, of\r\nthe sublime virtue of his opinions, or of the utter depravity of\r\nthe views of his opponent. The sort of item that was common in a\r\ncandidate’s election bill before the Ballot Act was this: “To the\r\nemployment of 200 men to obtain a hearing, 460s.” These men believed\r\nthat the best way “to obtain a hearing” for their employer was to\r\nprevent his rival being heard; and as the hired mob on the other\r\nside was likewise animated by the same conviction, both candidates\r\nwere equally shouted down. There is, for instance, the evidence of\r\nBernal Osborne, a famous wit and Member of the House of Commons.\r\n“The honourable gentleman talked about the voice of the electors,”\r\nhe said in a debate on old open-voting ways. “As if the individual\r\nvoice of an elector was ever heard at a nomination, and as if there\r\nwas not a general agreement to roar, to hiss, and become debased with\r\ndrink! The true-born Englishman is said to delight in that day. Now,\r\nwho are the true-born Englishmen?” he asked; and answered, “Why, the\r\nrepresentatives of muscular Christianity—prize-fighters and people of\r\nthat sort. I have spent as much money in retaining the services of\r\nthose gentlemen as anybody in this House. One of my most efficient\r\nsupporters in Nottingham was a man who was always clothed as a\r\nclergyman of the Church of England, but who was really an ex-champion\r\nof England, Bendigo by name.”\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the treatment a candidate had to expect at the\r\nhustings, and of the style of speaking which was thought appropriate\r\nto the occasion, listen to Disraeli addressing the Buckinghamshire\r\nelectors at Aylesbury. Received with a cry of “You look rather\r\nwhite,” he thus retorted: “I can tell you that it is at least not\r\nthe white feather I show. [Laughter and cheers, mixed with howling.]\r\nIf any member of the melodious company of owls [loud laughter]\r\nwishes to address you after me, I hope that you will give him a\r\nfair hearing. [Interruption.] I can tell the honourable gentleman\r\nwho makes this interruption that if it were possible for him to\r\nexpress the slightest common sense in decent language, I should be\r\nready to hear him. In the meantime I must say, from the symptoms of\r\nintelligence which he has presented to us to-day, I hope he is not\r\none whom I number amongst my supporters.” (Cheers and laughter.)\r\nDisraeli, still directing his attention to his opponents, further\r\nsaid: “Your most brilliant argument is a groan, and your happiest\r\nrepartee a hiss.” A voice then exclaimed: “Speak quick, speak quick!”\r\nfor he was a slow speaker, and he retorted: “It is very easy for you\r\nto speak quick, when you only utter a stupid monosyllable; but when I\r\nspeak I must measure my words. [Loud cheers and laughter]. I have to\r\nopen your great thick head. [Laughter]. What I speak is to enlighten\r\nyou. If I bawl like you, you will leave this place as ignorant as you\r\nentered it.” (Cheers and laughter.)\r\n\r\nAnother picture of a scene at the hustings which I call up from my\r\nreading on the subject is of a painful kind. It was in the year 1865,\r\nwhen there was a contest for Westminster, and from the hustings\r\nerected in Covent Garden, at the base of St. Paul’s Church, John\r\nStuart Mill, the Radical candidate, addressed the crowd. In his\r\npamphlet, _Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform_, Mill bluntly said that\r\nthe working classes, though ashamed of lying, were yet generally\r\nliars. This statement was printed on a placard by Mill’s opponent\r\nand aroused against Mill the animosity of the working men of the\r\ndivision. At one meeting he was asked whether he had really written\r\nsuch a thing. He at once answered, “I did,” and scarcely were the\r\nwords out of his mouth when, as he states in his _Autobiography_,\r\nvehement applause burst forth. The working men present were,\r\naccording to Mill, so used to equivocation and evasion, that this\r\ndirect avowal took their fancy, and instead of being affronted, they\r\nconcluded at once that Mill was a person whom they could trust. But\r\nMill does not mention the hostile reception he got when he appeared\r\non the hustings. Before the speaking commenced a member of the crowd\r\nasked an enthusiastic supporter of Mill which of the gentlemen on\r\nthe hustings was the candidate. “There,” exclaimed the admirer, as\r\nhe pointed at the author of the treatise _On Liberty_, “there is the\r\ngreat man.” “Then,” said the other, taking a dead cat from under\r\nhis coat and flinging it at Mill, “let him take that.” When Mill\r\nafterwards spoke he was pelted by the porters of Covent Garden with\r\nthe garbage of the market.\r\n\r\nThe mob influence exercised at elections—often the determining\r\ninfluence—might be intimidatory, but it was not always venal. These\r\nunsavoury arguments, dead cats and rotten apples, were at times the\r\nexpression of sincere political convictions on the part of people\r\nwithout votes. As it was only by the use of violence in some form\r\nor another that non-voters could have weight in public affairs,\r\nthe Chartists were opposed to the introduction of secret voting so\r\nlong as the franchise was restricted to the comparatively few. They\r\nadmitted that the ballot would be an excellent thing if universal\r\nsuffrage were established under it. Until then they avowed their\r\ndetermination to see to it that the unfranchised part of public\r\nopinion should not be deprived of the chance of influencing the\r\nelectors, under a system of open voting, by the methods of blacking\r\neyes and smashing windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTo convince Parliament of the beneficence of secret voting at\r\nelections took forty years of unremitting advocacy, though meanwhile\r\nthe franchise had been enlarged. Grote, the historian of Greece, who\r\nsat as a Radical for the City of London from 1832 to 1841, annually\r\nmoved a resolution in favour of the ballot. It was always rejected.\r\nOn the retirement of Grote into private life in 1841 Henry Berkeley\r\ncontinued to move the motion every year, with the same want of\r\nsuccess until 1851, when, despite the opposition of the then Whig\r\nGovernment, headed by Lord John Russell, he carried it by a majority\r\nof thirty-seven. Nevertheless, twenty-one years were yet to elapse\r\nbefore the ballot was finally established by Act of Parliament.\r\nA Select Committee of the House of Commons, which sat in 1868 to\r\ninquire into corrupt practices at elections, reported in favour\r\nof the ballot as a measure likely to conduce to the tranquillity,\r\npurity, and freedom of contests. The undue influence which was\r\nexercised in various forms at open elections is strikingly set forth\r\nin the evidence taken by that committee. Its most common shape was\r\nthe direct physical terrorism exercised by hired mobs. There was also\r\nthe more subtle intimidation of tenants by landlords, of workmen by\r\nemployers, of servants by masters, of tradesmen and shop-keepers\r\nby customers, and, more reprehensible still, the undue spiritual\r\ninfluence of ministers of religion, who, in the guidance of their\r\nflocks as to the way they should vote, did not scruple to invoke the\r\nterrors of the world to come.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Select Committee, which appeared in 1869,\r\ngreatly helped to turn public opinion in favour of the ballot. In\r\nthe following year W. E. Forster, a Member of the then Liberal\r\nGovernment, with Gladstone as Prime Minister, introduced a Bill\r\nabolishing nominations at the hustings and introducing vote by\r\nballot. It passed through the House of Commons, only to be rejected\r\nby the House of Lords by 97 votes to 48, on the motion of the Earl\r\nof Shaftesbury. The arguments against the measure had been set\r\nforth long before by John Stuart Mill, one of the ablest and most\r\ndistinguished opponents of secret voting. As the franchise was a\r\npublic trust, confided to a limited number of the community, the\r\ngeneral public, for whose benefit it was exercised, were entitled\r\nto see how it was used, openly and in the light of day. The ballot,\r\ntherefore, meant power without responsibility. It was also cowardly\r\nand skulking. Under its shelter the elector was likely to fall\r\ninto the temptation of casting a mean and dishonest vote for his\r\nown benefit as an individual, or for that of the class to which he\r\nbelonged. The Bill was reintroduced in the following session of 1872.\r\nIt passed again through the Commons, was sent up to the Lords, and,\r\ndespite the renewed opposition of Lord Shaftesbury, was carried to\r\nthe Statute Book. Since then the elector has been free to vote as he\r\npleased, according to the dictates of his conscience, his political\r\nconvictions, his foolish whims and his wayward fancies without\r\nanyone knowing a bit about it. The Ballot Act was not, however, made\r\nthe permanent law of the land. In the House of Lords an amendment\r\nlimiting the operation of the Bill to eight years was accepted\r\nby the Government. Therefore, from 1880 the Ballot Act had to be\r\nrenewed every year by being included in the Expiring Laws Continuance\r\nAct—otherwise the measure would have had to be reintroduced and\r\ncarried through all its stages in both Houses—until 1918, when a\r\nclause of the Representation of the People Act transformed it from an\r\nannual into a permanent statute. Yet there is one election to which\r\nthe Ballot Act does not apply—an election for the representation of\r\na University. During the time allowed for the polling—about five\r\ndays—electors can vote either personally or by proxy papers, which,\r\nhaving been signed before a justice of the peace, are sent by post\r\nto the University, and in either case the votes are openly declared\r\nbefore the presiding officer.\r\n\r\nIn the _Life of Grote_ there is recorded an interesting conversation\r\nbetween him and his wife on the subject of secret voting after the\r\nBallot Act had been passed. “You will feel great satisfaction at\r\nseeing your once favourite measure triumph over all obstacles,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Grote to her husband one morning at breakfast. “Since the\r\nwide expansion of the voting element, I confess that the value of\r\nthe ballot has sunk in my estimation,” the historian replied. “I\r\ndon’t, in fact, think the electors will be affected by it one way\r\nor another, so far as Party interests are concerned.” “Still,” said\r\nthe wife, “you will at all events get at the genuine preference of\r\nthe constituency.” “No doubt,” said Grote; “but then, again, I have\r\ncome to perceive that the choice between one man and another among\r\nthe English people signifies less than I used formerly to think it\r\ndid. The English mind is much of one pattern, take whatsoever class\r\nyou will. The same favourite prejudices, amiable and otherwise;\r\nthe same antipathies, coupled with ill-regulated though benevolent\r\nefforts to eradicate human evils, are wellnigh universal. A House\r\nof Commons cannot afford to be above its own constituents in\r\nintelligence, knowledge, or patriotism.” But this must be said—thanks\r\nto the ballot, all parties are united in eliminating from the\r\nstock of political arguments rotten eggs, stale fish, dead cats,\r\nover-ripe fruit and decaying vegetables, and, in agreeing that in\r\nelectioneering it is better to count heads than to break them.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nOne of the most memorable of General Elections under the Ballot Act\r\nsurely was that held in December, 1918, following the passing of the\r\nRepresentation of the People Act and the close of the World War,\r\nwhen women voted for the first time. The scenes I saw in London on\r\nthe polling day, that historic Saturday, made a profound impression\r\non me. Women in thousands flocked to the booths as well as men.\r\nMany wives and mothers of the working class brought their babies\r\nin perambulators. What did they think of it all? They were not\r\nsubdued in demeanour and thoughtful, in keeping with the greatness\r\nand gravity of the occasion. On the contrary, they were joking and\r\nlaughing, as if quite elated at the notion that they should be voting\r\nfor a Member of Parliament—and a Parliament in which, as it turned\r\nout, a representative of their own sex was to sit for the first time\r\nin the person of Lady Astor, of the Sutton Division of Plymouth.\r\n\r\nEven so, was not this the last word in ordered and organized\r\ndemocracy? Could there be, I asked myself, a more advanced and\r\nstriking manifestation of the free citizenship in the most\r\nperfectly planned Republic? Then I wondered what the Barons of\r\nMagna Charta—whose statues I have so often looked upon in the House\r\nof Lords—would have thought of it, those feudal lords who, over\r\n600 years before, extracted from an absolute King the first great\r\nenunciation of constitutional liberty? Nay, why go back so far and\r\nremotely? What would the working men who, as a protest against the\r\ndenial of electoral reform in July, 1866, tore down the railings of\r\nHyde Park, have thought of it? What they wanted was the extension of\r\nthe franchise to male householders. They could never have imagined\r\nthat their grand-daughters would have that which they themselves\r\ndid not then possess—the vote for a Parliament the least fettered in\r\nthe world by a written Constitution and the most omnipotent in the\r\nexercise of its legislative powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe counting of the votes takes place on the night of the polling\r\nday, or the next day as the returning officer may appoint. In county\r\nconstituencies, where the polling stations are many miles apart, it\r\nis impossible to commence counting the votes until the next morning;\r\nbut in boroughs, where all the ballot boxes are delivered up to the\r\nreturning officer within a quarter, or at most half an hour, of the\r\nclose of the poll at 8 or 9 p.m., the counting is got through as a\r\nrule by eleven o’clock. No person may be present at the counting of\r\nthe votes besides the returning officer and his counting clerks, the\r\ncandidates and their agents, except by the authority of the returning\r\nofficer, and everyone present is placed under an obligation to\r\nmaintain, and aid in maintaining, the secrecy of the voting.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that is done is to check the number of votes in each\r\nballot box with the return furnished by the presiding officer of\r\nthe number of ballot papers issued at the polling booth, in order\r\nto see if they tally. All the ballot papers from all the boxes are\r\nthen mixed up together in one great heap, so as to make it impossible\r\nto find out how the voting went in any particular polling district.\r\nThe ballot papers are next placed on the table faces upward, so that\r\nthe number printed in each case on the back—the only thing which\r\nmight give a clue to the identification of a voter—shall not be\r\nseen. Any person who attempts to obtain the number of a voting paper\r\nin violation of the secrecy of the ballot is liable to six months’\r\nimprisonment. The ballot papers are then distributed among the large\r\nstaff of counting clerks seated at scattered tables in the room, and\r\nthe counting of the votes recorded for the several candidates begins.\r\nThere are two ways of counting in vogue. In one—the London way—the\r\nclerks are divided into pairs. One clerk is provided with a sheet\r\nof foolscap containing the names of the candidates with a number\r\nof squares under each, and the other clerk goes through the ballot\r\npapers calling out the name of the candidate opposite to which the\r\nvoter has placed his cross. If the vote is given for “Robinson,” a\r\nstroke is inserted in one of the squares under Robinson’s name; if\r\nit is given for “Smith,” a stroke is put in one of the squares under\r\nthe name of Smith. Provision is made on each sheet for 250 votes to\r\nbe thus counted, and when either of the candidates has received that\r\nnumber the figures for each are put at the foot—“Robinson, 250,”\r\n“Smith, 76”—and the sheet is passed on to the returning officer.\r\nUnder the other system of counting, each clerk places on the table in\r\nfront of him the ballot papers for each candidate in separate piles,\r\nmakes them up into packets of fifty, placing an elastic band round\r\neach, and hands them over to the returning officer.\r\n\r\nThe work of the counting clerks is closely watched by an agent\r\nrepresenting each of the candidates. All votes about which there is\r\nany doubt are referred to the returning officer. Any paper which has\r\non it any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified is\r\nrejected. Some electors are so vehemently partisan that, not content\r\nwith making the simple “X,” they add personal remarks about the\r\ncandidates or comments on the political issues as the strong feelings\r\nof the moment prompt them. I remember at one election where only\r\nLiberal and Socialist candidates stood many angry Conservatives wrote\r\nacross their ballot papers such phrases as “Betwixt the devil and\r\nthe deep sea,” and “God help England!” Every voting paper so defaced\r\nis cast aside. Any paper which contains votes for more candidates\r\nthan the elector is entitled to vote for is also void. There are\r\nalso voting papers about which hang the element of uncertainty. On\r\nsome the “X” is made on the candidate’s name; on others it commences\r\nin one square and ends in another. Other electors, again, impishly\r\ndesirous no doubt of puzzling everybody concerned, make their “X”\r\nmeet exactly on the line which separates the names of the candidates.\r\nEach paper thus irregularly marked is judged on its own merits, but\r\nthe guiding rule is that the vote is given to the candidate whose\r\nname appears within that section of the voting paper where the lines\r\nof the voter’s cross touch each other.\r\n\r\nThe candidates are also present in the room with some of their\r\nleading and more intimate supporters, and often with their wives,\r\nawaiting with such composure as they can command the result which\r\nis to realize or disappoint their hopes and ambitions. Sometimes\r\nthe candidates never get into personal touch with one another until\r\nthey meet in the counting-room. And though Party feeling usually\r\nruns high, those contests are not without their charming amenities.\r\nIt was on such an occasion that Thackeray was paid what he thought\r\nwas the greatest compliment of his life. He contested Oxford in the\r\nLiberal interest in 1857, and, meeting his opponent, Edward Cardwell,\r\nhe remarked: “Well, I hope the best man will win.” “I hope not,”\r\nreplied the Tory candidate. Notwithstanding all the care of the\r\nofficials, aided by the vigilance of the candidates’ agents, mistakes\r\nare occasionally made, and, what is more annoying and perplexing, are\r\nnot discovered until after the result of the count is supposed to\r\nhave been ascertained, though not officially declared in the room. A\r\nbundle of counted ballot papers may fall unnoticed under the table,\r\nor may be erroneously placed in the batch of the wrong candidate.\r\nSurely no disappointment more bitter can befall a man than that of\r\nthe candidate who within five or ten minutes of his feeling certain\r\nof being duly returned to Parliament finds there has been an error in\r\nthe counting, and that he has really been beaten after all.\r\n\r\nThe returning officer cannot vote at the election; but should there\r\nbe a tie between the candidates he may, if a registered elector,\r\ngive a casting vote. At a by-election for South Northumberland in\r\nApril, 1878, the candidates, Albert Grey (afterwards Earl Grey) and\r\nEdward Ridley (subsequently a Judge of the High Court), polled the\r\nsame number of votes—2,912—a thing unprecedented in the case of a big\r\ncounty constituency. The sheriff declined to give a casting vote as\r\nreturning officer, although himself an elector, preferring to make a\r\ndouble return by declaring both candidates elected. A few days later\r\nMr. Grey and Mr. Ridley presented themselves at the Table of the\r\nHouse of Commons, the oaths were administered to them, both signed\r\nthe roll, and both duly took their seats. They were not, however,\r\nallowed to vote. In the scrutiny which followed it was found that\r\na few of the voting papers were spoiled, and Mr. Ridley, having a\r\nmajority of the correct votes, was awarded the seat.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in 1886, Mr. Addison, Q.C., was returned in the Conservative\r\ninterest for Ashton-under-Lyne by the casting vote of the returning\r\nofficer, who was also chief magistrate of the town. Mr. Addison sat\r\nin the House of Commons for six years, according to the jocular\r\ndescription of his opponents, as “the Hon. Member for the Mayor of\r\nAshton-under-Lyne.” In the event of a tie, the casting vote of the\r\nreturning officer is only operative if exercised on the declaration\r\nof the poll. In October, 1892, at a by-election for the Cirencester\r\ndivision of Gloucester, Colonel Chesters Master, the Conservative\r\ncandidate, was declared Member, having defeated Mr. Harry Lawson\r\n(afterwards Lord Burnham), the Liberal candidate, by a majority of\r\nthree. A scrutiny of votes was demanded by Mr. Lawson, and this\r\nshowed that both candidates had polled the same number of votes. The\r\nsheriff, having ceased to be returning officer on the declaration of\r\nthe poll, could not give a casting vote, and accordingly there had\r\nto be a new election, when Mr. Lawson was elected by a majority of\r\nupwards of 100.\r\n\r\nSuch awkward incidents, however, are very uncommon. The returning\r\nofficer, at the conclusion of the count, has usually no other duty\r\nto discharge than publicly to declare the candidate to whom the\r\nmajority of votes was given duly elected to Parliament, and he sends\r\nforthwith the return to the writ of election, bearing the name of the\r\nsuccessful candidate, to the Clerk of the Crown at Westminster. The\r\nvoting papers, the counterfoils, the marked copies of the register of\r\nvoters, and all other official documents relating to the election,\r\nare also made up in a bag and sealed by the returning officer and\r\nforwarded to the Crown Office. To give an idea of the enormous amount\r\nof official papers used at a General Election, I have been told at\r\nthe Crown Office that they weigh from 22 to 25 tons. In case there\r\nmight be a demand for a scrutiny and recount of the voting papers in\r\nany constituency, or a petition presented to declare the return null\r\nand void under the Corrupt Practices Act, all these documents are\r\nstored in the cellars of the Crown Office for a year and a day before\r\nthey are destroyed. The writs are kept by the Clerk of the Crown\r\nuntil the Parliament is dissolved, when they are sent to the Public\r\nRecord Office, where they are preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nA candidate declared elected by the returning officer, but whose\r\nreturn is questioned by petition, takes the oath and his seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons and serves in the usual course until the report of\r\nthe two Judges who tried the petition is delivered to the Speaker\r\nand is by him communicated to the House. Jesse Collings, in January,\r\n1886, as Member for Ipswich, while a petition against his return was\r\npending, which resulted in his being unseated for reasons for which\r\nhe was personally blameless, moved and carried the small holdings\r\nresolution, the famous “three acres and a cow,” which defeated Lord\r\nSalisbury’s Government and brought back to power again the Liberals\r\nunder Gladstone. I remember a petition arising out of a contest at\r\nExeter in the General Election of 1910 which had a curious result.\r\nThe Liberal candidate was declared returned by a majority of four.\r\nThe Judges who tried the petition disallowed five votes for the\r\nLiberal given by five men who were held to have been unlawfully\r\nemployed as bill distributors during the election, and accordingly\r\nthe seat was given to the Conservative candidate by a majority of\r\none. On the day the decision of the Judges was announced by the\r\nSpeaker I witnessed a very uncommon incident. This was the appearance\r\nof the wigged and gowned Clerk of the Crown, bringing the return to\r\nthe writ for the Exeter election, and at the Table, in the presence\r\nof the Speaker and the Commons, amending the return by substituting\r\n“H. E. Duke” for “H. St. Maur” as the Member to serve for the\r\nborough. Immediately afterwards Mr. Duke took his seat in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nIt is a long and elaborate process, this obtaining of the Verdict\r\nof the country; and rightly so, having regard to the momentousness\r\nof the issues that may be at stake. The philosophy expressed at\r\na General Election may not always be thought very high or noble.\r\nOften it has but root in an idea of material well-being—that men and\r\nwomen who labour with their hands may enjoy a little more of the\r\npleasures of life before the time comes for them to lie down and die.\r\nAnd that is a most excellent thing, and well worth striving for.\r\nBut it is quite possible to have inaugurated at a General Election\r\na mighty movement towards an entirely new conception or order of\r\nlife, like the foundation of Christianity, the Reformation, or the\r\nFrench Revolution, and bring it about by the peaceful processes of\r\nparliamentary evolution. To say the least, a Nation can unitedly\r\nrise to a height of great glory by marching to the polling booths,\r\nand, by its votes, securing the success of a high moral cause.\r\nAnyway, nothing should be done to detract from the importance and\r\nimpressiveness of the General Election. The one substitute for the\r\nballot box that remains in this age is the match-box, not only as the\r\nsymbol but as the instrument of Revolution by fire and blood, with\r\nthe aid of a tin of petrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nAt every General Election there is seen the old and familiar, but\r\never curious and interesting, spectacle of about twelve or thirteen\r\nhundred men—who, though selected at random from the general mass, yet\r\nvary so much in position, ability and temperament that they may be\r\nsaid to reflect collectively the very image of the Nation—engaged in\r\nwooing the constituencies which have at their disposal the 707 seats\r\nin the House of Commons. What are the irresistible allurements that\r\ncompel this large body of men, the majority of them actively engaged\r\nevery day in business or professional life, to spend their money and\r\ntime, their strength and temper, in order that they may be given the\r\nchance of making a gift of their professional capacity and business\r\nexperience to the Nation, expecting in return, as regards the mass of\r\nthem, neither fee nor reward beyond a salary of £400 a year?\r\n\r\nMacaulay on the subject is well worth giving ear to. Writing to his\r\nsister Hannah (subsequently Lady Trevelyan) on June 17, 1833, after a\r\nfew years’ experience of the House of Commons, he says:\r\n\r\n  I begin to wonder what the fascination is which attracts men, who\r\n  could sit over their tea and their book in their own cool, quiet\r\n  room, to breathe bad air, hear bad speeches, lounge up and down the\r\n  long gallery, and doze uneasily on the green benches till three in\r\n  the morning. Thank God, these luxuries are not necessary for me.\r\n  My pen is sufficient for my support, and my sister’s company is\r\n  sufficient for my happiness. Only let me see her well and cheerful,\r\n  and let offices in Government and seats in Parliament go to those\r\n  who care for them. If I were to leave public life to-morrow, I\r\n  declare that, except for the vexation which it might give you and\r\n  one or two others, the event would not be in the slightest degree\r\n  painful to me.\r\n\r\nSir George Trevelyan, in his _Life of Lord Macaulay_, not only\r\ncorroborates his uncle as to the inexplicability of the charm of\r\nthe House of Commons, but gives also from personal experience a\r\nstill more forbidding description of what he calls “the tedious and\r\nexhaustive routine” of an M.P.’s life:\r\n\r\n  Waiting the whole evening to vote, and then walking half a mile at\r\n  a foot’s-pace round and round the crowded lobbies; dining amidst\r\n  clamour and confusion, with a division twenty minutes long between\r\n  two of the mouthfuls; trudging home at three in the morning through\r\n  the slush of a February thaw; and sitting behind Ministers in the\r\n  centre of a closely packed bench during the hottest week of the\r\n  London summer.\r\n\r\nIf this were all that was to be said, it would, indeed, be hard to\r\nunderstand why a seat in the House of Commons should be regarded as\r\nan object to be sighed for, and schemed for, and fought for, and paid\r\nfor by thousands of very astute and able men. The constituencies are\r\nnot engaged at the General Election in fastening this burden upon\r\nunwilling shoulders. How incomprehensible, then, is the action of\r\nthese who, having had experience of the hard and thankless lot of the\r\nMember of Parliament, its mental strain, its physical discomforts,\r\nyet labour unceasingly night and day during the weeks of the General\r\nElection to induce the electors to send them back again to the dreary\r\nround of routine tasks at Westminster. Indeed, Macaulay himself felt\r\nkeenly the loss of his seat for Edinburgh in 1847, though at the time\r\nhe was absorbed in his _History of England_; and in 1852, with his\r\ngreat work still uncompleted, he was delighted to be returned again\r\nto Parliament by his old constituency. But the truth is, we have been\r\ngiven thus far only the dark side of the picture. There is a silver\r\nlining also to the cloud. The life of a representative of the people\r\nhas of course its compensations.\r\n\r\nStill, the tribulations of an M.P. are undoubtedly many. There are,\r\nto begin with, the torments of the post. Cobden, in a letter to a\r\nfriend early in 1846, when his name as the leader of the agitation\r\nfor the repeal of the Corn Laws was in all men’s mouths, gives a\r\nglimpse into the contents, half laughable and half pathetic, of the\r\nletter-bag of an M.P. He says:\r\n\r\n  First, half the mad people in the country who are still at large,\r\n  and they are legion, address their incoherent ravings to the most\r\n  notorious man of the hour. Next, the kindred tribe who think\r\n  themselves poets, who are more difficult than the mad people to\r\n  deal with, send their doggerel and solicit subscriptions to their\r\n  volumes, with occasional requests to be allowed to dedicate them.\r\n  Then there are the Jeremy Diddlers, who begin their epistles with\r\n  high-flown compliments upon my services to the millions, and\r\n  always wind up with a request that I will bestow a trifle upon\r\n  the individual who ventures to lay his distressing case before\r\n  me. To add to my miseries, people have now got an idea that I am\r\n  influential with the Government, and the small place-hunters are at\r\n  me.\r\n\r\nCobden supplied a specimen of the begging letters he was accustomed\r\nto receive. It was from a lady asking him to become her “generous and\r\nnoble-minded benefactor.” As she desired to begin to do something\r\nfor herself, she hoped he would procure her a loan of £5,000 “to\r\nenable her to rear poultry for London and other large market towns.”\r\nIn another letter, written July 14, 1846, after the taxes on\r\nbread-stuffs had been repealed and the Corn Law League disbanded,\r\nCobden says:\r\n\r\n  I thought I should be allowed to be forgotten after my address\r\n  to my constituents. But every post brings me twenty or thirty\r\n  letters—and such letters! I am teased to death by place-hunters of\r\n  every degree, who wish me to procure them Government appointments.\r\n  Brothers of peers—aye, “honourables”—are amongst the number. I have\r\n  but one answer for all: “I would not ask a favour of the Ministry\r\n  to serve my own brother.” I often think what must be the fate of\r\n  Lord John, or Peel, with half the needy aristocracy knocking at the\r\n  Treasury doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nHappily, things have greatly improved since the time of Cobden. It\r\nis probable that the average elector still fails to see that his\r\nrepresentative deserves any gratitude or thanks for his services in\r\nParliament. On the contrary, the elector may think that it is he\r\nwho is entitled to some return for having helped his representative\r\nto a seat in the House of Commons in preference to another who was\r\nequally eager for the honour. The spectacle of so many men competing\r\nfor the voluntary service of the State in the capacity of a Member\r\nof Parliament cannot but tend to convince the ordinary elector that\r\nhe is conferring a favour on the particular candidate for whom he\r\nvotes. Constituents, certainly, are often very exacting. And as the\r\nrepresentative desires to retain his seat, he cannot afford to ignore\r\na letter from even the humblest and obscurest of the electors. The\r\nGeneral Election may come round again with unexpected suddenness,\r\nbringing with it the day of reckoning for the Member who has been\r\nneglectful of communications from his constituents. Then it is that\r\nthe voter, however humble, however obscure, can help to make or mar\r\nthe prospect of the Member’s return to Westminster. The worst of\r\nit is that some constituents will unreasonably persist in asking\r\nfor things impossible. In the post-bag of the M.P. appointments\r\nused to be greatly in demand. There was a time when the M.P. had\r\nsome patronage to distribute in the way of nominations to posts\r\nin the Customs and the Inland Revenue, for which no examination\r\nwas required, should the Party he supported be in power. But that\r\ngood time, or bad, is gone and for ever. The throwing open of the\r\nCivil Service to competition deprived the M.P. of this sort of\r\nsmall change, which he once was able to scatter among the electors\r\nso as to reward past services and secure future support. Now he\r\nhas absolutely nothing in his gift, except, perhaps, a nomination\r\nfor any vacant sub-post office in his constituency. Yet numbers of\r\nthe electors still imagine there are many comfortable posts in the\r\npublic service which are to be had merely for the saying of a word by\r\ntheir representatives to the Minister of the Department concerned.\r\nAn example of what the M.P. has occasionally to put up with may be\r\nseen in the terms of a blunt and abusive epistle—admittedly a very\r\nrare one—sent by a disappointed office-seeker to the man he says “he\r\ncarried in on his own shoulders” at the last election. It opened:\r\n“You’re a fraud, and you know it. I don’t care a rap for the billet\r\nor the money either, but you could hev got it for me if you wasn’t\r\nso mean. Two pound a week ain’t any more to me than 40 shillin’s is\r\nto you, but I objekt to bein’ maid a fool of.” It went on: “Soon\r\nafter you was elected by my hard workin’, a feller here wanted to\r\nbet me that You wouldn’t be in the House more than a week before you\r\nmade a ass of yourself. I bet him a Cow on that as I thort you was\r\nworth it then. After I got Your Note sayin’ you deklined to ackt in\r\nthe matter I driv the Cow over to the Feller’s place an’ told him he\r\nhad won her.” And thus concluded: “That’s orl I got by howlin’ meself\r\nHoarse for you on pole day, an’ months befoar. I believe you think\r\nyou’ll get in agen. I don’t. Yure no man. An’ I doant think yure much\r\nof a demercrat either. I lowers meself ritin to so low a feller, even\r\ntho I med him a member of parlerment.”\r\n\r\nOther electors argue that as M.P.’s are law-makers they should\r\nconsequently be able to rescue law-breakers from the clutches of the\r\npolice and gaolers. Accordingly there are appeals for the remission\r\nof fines imposed on children for breaking windows, and even to get\r\nsentences of penal servitude revoked. The respectable tradesman on\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy, who could be restored to a sound financial\r\nposition by the loan of £100, is perhaps the worst pest of all\r\nthe cadging letter-writers. He usually declares that he not only\r\nvoted for his representative, but also attended every meeting that\r\ngentleman addressed in the course of the election. The best reply the\r\nM.P. could make to such an attempt to fleece him is to advise his\r\ncorrespondent to attend more to business and less to politics; but he\r\nprobably never makes it, for he can rarely afford to speak out his\r\nmind to a constituent. An Irish Member who was elected for an Ulster\r\nconstituency after a close contest showed me a letter he got from\r\none of his supporters asking for some favour. “I voted for you under\r\nthirteen different names,” said the writer, “and could I do more for\r\nyou than that?” No Member would think of offending so invaluable a\r\nsupporter. Inventors are also of the plagues from which the M.P.\r\nsuffers. The man who knows how to make soap out of sawdust writes\r\nglowing letters about the fortune awaiting a company which would work\r\nthe process. Almost every post brings samples of tonics and boxes of\r\nlozenges calculated to transform the harshest croak into the clearest\r\nand mellowest of voices. “I shall be thankful for a testimonial,”\r\nsaid the maker of one mixture, “that after you had used my specific\r\nthe House was spellbound by the music of your tones, and I guarantee\r\nto extend your fame by publishing it, with your portrait, broadcast.”\r\nTradesmen are very importunate. For instance, the Labour Members\r\nreceive circulars from too enterprising firms soliciting their custom\r\nfor things which, it was declared, were most requisite for the\r\nmaintenance of the state and dignity becoming a Member of Parliament.\r\nFrom one firm a Member, fresh from working in the coalmines, had a\r\ntender for a Court dress of black velvet, to cost, with sword, only\r\n£50. A company of wine merchants offered to stock with the choicest\r\nbrands the wine-cellar of the establishment they presumed he was\r\nabout to set up in London.\r\n\r\nThe day after the announcement of a birth in a Member’s family a van\r\npulled up at the entrance to the Houses of Parliament containing\r\nthree different sorts of perambulators. The tradesman who brought\r\nthem was extremely indignant because the police refused him admission\r\nto the House to display their good points and conveniences to the\r\nhappy father! Poets ask for subscriptions to publish their works,\r\nor, enclosing some doggerel verses as samples, appeal for orders for\r\nodes for the next General Election. “If you would quote in the House\r\na verse from my volume, _Twitterings in the Twilight_, what a grand\r\nadvertisement I’d get!” wrote one rhymester to his representative.\r\n“You might say something like this: ‘One of the most delightful\r\ncollections of poems it has ever been my good fortune to come across\r\nis Mr. Socrates Wilkin’s _Twitterings in the Twilight_. Could the\r\nsituation in which the Empire finds itself be more happily touched\r\noff than in the following verse of that eminent poet?’ and then\r\ngo on to quote some lines from my book, which I enclose.” Members\r\nwho are lawyers and doctors are expected by a large section of\r\ntheir constituents to give professional advice for nothing. If one\r\nof these unreasonable persons has a dispute with his landlord as\r\nto the amount of rent due, or finds it impossible to recover a\r\ndebt, he expects, as a matter of course, his representative, if a\r\ngentleman learned in the law, to help him out of his difficulty; or,\r\nif a doctor, he favours him with long and incoherent accounts of\r\nmysterious complaints from which he has suffered for years. The M.P.\r\nis also expected to throw oil on disturbed domestic waters. Here is a\r\nspecimen of a communication which is by no means uncommon:\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n  Me and the wife had a bit of a tiff last Saturday night, and she\r\n  won’t make it up. If you just send her a line saying Bill’s all\r\n  right, she will come round. She thinks the hell of a lot of you\r\n  since you kissed the nipper the day you called for our votes.\r\n\r\nBut pity the poor M.P. who receives from a female voter so\r\nembarrassing a letter as the following:\r\n\r\n  HONOURED SIR,\r\n\r\n  I hear that Mr. Balfour is not a married man. Something tells me\r\n  that I would make the right sort of wife for him. I am coming to\r\n  London to-morrow, and will call at the House of Commons to see you,\r\n  hoping you will get me an introduction to the honourable gentleman.\r\n  I am only thirty years of age, and can do cooking and washing.\r\n\r\n                                                         AGNES MERTON.\r\n\r\n  P.S.—Perhaps if Mr. Balfour would not have me, you would say a word\r\n  for me to one of the policemen at the House.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening the Member who received this strange epistle\r\ncautiously ventured into the Central Hall, and, sure enough, espied\r\nan eccentric-looking woman in angry controversy with a constable, who\r\nwas trying to induce her to go away. But she refused to leave, and\r\nultimately found sympathetic companions in the crazy old party who\r\nhas haunted the place for years in the hope that some day she will\r\ninduce the Government to restore the £5,000,000 of which she declares\r\nthey have robbed her, and the other lady, younger, but just as mad,\r\nwho is convinced that some M.P. has married her secretly and left her\r\nto starve, and has come to Westminster to claim him “before all the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe Member of Parliament is liable to receive other communications\r\nof even less flattering and more exasperating character. Bribes are\r\noccasionally dangled before him through the post. Will he allow his\r\nname to be used in the floating of a company, or in the advertising\r\nof some article of common use or a patent medicine? Will he use his\r\ninfluence in obtaining a Government contract for a certain firm? If\r\nhe will, there is a cheque for so-and-so at his disposal. In the\r\ncourse of a debate in the House of Commons on the payment of Members,\r\nJohn Burns, for many years a well-known Liberal Minister, evoked\r\nboth laughter and applause by reading his reply to an offer of £50\r\nreceived during his previous service as a Labour representative if\r\nhe obtained for a person in Belfast a vacant collectorship of taxes.\r\n“Sir,” he wrote, “you are a scoundrel. I wish you were within reach\r\nof my boot.”\r\n\r\nBut the sane and the righteous give the M.P. more annoyance\r\nthan the knavish and the crazy. Think of the numerous local\r\nfunctions—religious, social, and political—to which the Member of\r\nParliament is invited! When a meeting is being organized in the\r\nconstituency, naturally the first thought of its promoters is to\r\ntry to get the Member to attend. The more conspicuous he is in\r\nParliament, and therefore the more likely to attract an audience,\r\nthe greater is the number of these invitations; and if he fails to\r\nrespond, the more widespread is the dissatisfaction among his baulked\r\nconstituents. He is expected to preside at the inaugural meetings of\r\nlocal amateur dramatic societies and local naturalists’ field clubs,\r\nand “to honour with his presence” the beanfeasts of local friendly\r\nsocieties. The literary institution, designed to keep young men of\r\nthe constituency out of the public-houses, must be opened by him. He\r\nmust attend entertainments of a mixed political and musical sort, at\r\nwhich his speech is sandwiched between a sentimental song and a comic.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the Member of Parliament is most worried by the appeals\r\nto his generosity and charity which pour in upon him in aid of\r\nchurches, chapels, mission-halls, schools, working men’s institutes,\r\nhospitals, asylums, cricket and football clubs, and in fact societies\r\nand institutions of all sorts and sundry. It is only proper that if\r\nmoney be needed for an excellent local purpose, the representative\r\nof the district in Parliament should be included in the appeal. Many\r\nwealthy Members of Parliament spend from £1,000 to £4,000 a year on\r\nlocal charities, and they spend it willingly when the objects appear\r\nto them to be deserving. But of the 707 M.P.’s there are never a\r\ngreat many who can be described as wealthy.\r\n\r\nBesides that, many representatives—among them being some of the\r\nmost charitable of men—always refuse to send contributions to local\r\nobjects, influenced by a sense of honour and the fear that it might\r\nbe regarded as bribing the electors. In so doing they run a grave\r\nrisk of being misunderstood by their constituents. If a Member of\r\nParliament should refuse to help in providing them with coals,\r\nblankets, footballs, cricket-bats, big drums, billiard-tables, church\r\nsteeples, sewing-machines, he is set down as mean, and numbers of\r\nhis constituents vow that he shall not have their votes again at the\r\nGeneral Election. There is a story told that when John Morley was\r\nseeking re-election for Newcastle-on-Tyne an elector who was asked to\r\nvote for this statesman of the highest and purest ideals indignantly\r\nexclaimed: “Not me! What has John Morley ever done for the Rugger\r\nFootball Club?”\r\n\r\nThe representative is to be commended by all means in resisting these\r\nillegitimate demands. Macaulay, when Member for Edinburgh, was asked\r\nto subscribe to a local football club. “Those were not the conditions\r\nupon which I undertook to represent Edinburgh,” he answered. “In\r\nreturn for your generous confidence I offer parliamentary service,\r\nand nothing else. The call that is now made is one so objectionable\r\nthat I must plainly say I would rather take the Chiltern Hundreds\r\nthan comply with it. If our friends want a Member who will find\r\nthem in public diversions, they can be at no loss. I know twenty\r\npeople who, if you elect them to Parliament, would gladly treat\r\nyou to a race and a race-ball each month. But I shall not be very\r\neasily induced to believe that Edinburgh is disposed to select\r\nher representatives on such a principle.” On the other hand, there\r\nis something to be said for the constituents. Surely they may very\r\nproperly ask: “From whom can we more reasonably seek aid for our\r\ndeserving local charities than from our Member of Parliament?” They\r\nrecall to mind his accessibility and graciousness while he was\r\n“nursing” the constituency. Was he not ever ready to preside at the\r\nsmoking concerts of the Sons of Benevolence, to sing songs or recite\r\nat the mothers’ meetings, to hand round the cake at the children’s\r\ntea parties, to kick off at the football contests?\r\n\r\nHis speeches are also remembered. Did he not regard service in the\r\nHouse of Commons while he was seeking it more as a distinction and\r\nprivilege than as a public duty? Did he not tell the electors from\r\na hundred platforms that for all time he was absolutely at their\r\nservice? Did he not come to them literally hat in hand begging the\r\nfavour—mind you, the “favour”—of their vote and influence? Yet to\r\nthis cynical end has it all come, that, badgered by requests for\r\nsubscriptions to this, that or the other, he replies—to quote the\r\nprompt, emphatic and printed answer which one representative has sent\r\nto all such appeals: “I was elected for —— as Member of Parliament,\r\nnot as Relieving Officer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons itself some disappointments also await the\r\nM.P. The motives which induce men to seek for a seat in Parliament\r\nare many and diverse; but there is hardly a doubt whatever that the\r\nmain reason is a genuine desire to serve the State and promote the\r\nwell-being and happiness of the community. Accordingly, in the first\r\nflush of enthusiasm after election our representatives zealously set\r\nabout informing themselves of the subjects which are likely to engage\r\ntheir attention in Parliament. But soon comes a rude awakening,\r\nbringing with it the first of the disappointments that await them.\r\nThey find that to instruct themselves properly in questions that are\r\nripening for legislation would leave them very little time for the\r\ncalls of business and social life.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast table of the M.P. is heaped almost every morning during\r\nthe session with parliamentary papers of one kind or another—Blue\r\nBooks, Bills, reports and returns. Blue Books are popularly supposed\r\nto be unattractive reading. This is a mistake. They may look\r\nominously ponderous in outward appearance, but their matter is not\r\ntherefore portentously dull. With a little delving, illuminating\r\nfacts for the serious student of the condition of the people—the\r\nsupreme and all-embracing question of politics—come to light. There\r\nare, however, not only too much of them, but too many. On an average,\r\neighty are issued every year, making an impossible demand on the\r\nattention of even the most conscientious representative. The Bills\r\nare more inviting than the Blue Books, for, embodying as they do\r\nthe fads and hobbies of the 707 Members of the House of Commons,\r\nthey bring one into touch with curious manifestations of common\r\nhuman nature and individual political ideals. About 300 of them are\r\nintroduced every session. After the formality of a first reading,\r\nthey are printed and circulated among the representatives, who are\r\nexpected to make themselves acquainted with their provisions.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that many M.P.’s give up this task in despair.\r\nInstead of attempting to arrive at independent conclusions by\r\npersonal investigation and study, they are content to rely upon\r\ntheir Party leaders to direct them on the right path in regard to\r\nGovernment measures dealing with the main public questions of the\r\nday, and upon their Whips as to whether they should oppose or support\r\nthe Bills of private Members. Yet it is not always plain sailing,\r\neven when the lazy course is pursued of just giving one’s ear to the\r\nleaders on both sides attacking and defending. “The worst effect\r\non myself resulting from listening to the debates in Parliament,”\r\nwrites Monckton Milnes, “is that it prevents me from forming any\r\nclear political opinion on any subject.” Of the 300 Bills brought\r\nin every session, very few are passed. So supreme is the command of\r\nthe Ministry over the time of the House of Commons that the private\r\nMembers have little chance of carrying legislation. Only the Bills\r\nof the Government set out on their course through both Houses of\r\nParliament with a fair prospect of reaching the Statute Book.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the M.P. who is ambitious “the listening Senate to\r\ncommand,” also soon discovers that the opportunities for talking are\r\nflagrantly restricted in the interest of the Government. He may have\r\ndevoted many days to the making and colouring of artificial flowers\r\nof rhetoric with which to decorate his speech in a great debate.\r\nSometimes he may get the chance to deliver it in a House almost\r\nempty, and containing but two interested listeners—one the hon.\r\nMember who hopes to follow, and is impatient of his prolixity, and\r\nthe other his wife in the Ladies’ Gallery, fuming at the indifference\r\nwith which his eloquent periods are being received. That is bad\r\nenough; but there is a worse fate still. He may sit night after night\r\non the pounce to “catch the Speaker’s eye” and yet fail to fix the\r\nattention of that wandering orb. Meanwhile he may hear his arguments\r\nand his epigrams made use of by luckier men, who probably got them\r\nin the Library from the same shelf, the same book, the same page as\r\nhimself. Finally, the debate may be brought to an end, leaving him\r\nbaulked in his design, with a mind further oppressed by the burden\r\nof a weighty unspoken speech. Then his constituents say unpleasant\r\nthings of him because they do not see his name in the newspaper\r\nreports. He is neglecting his duty, or he is an empty-minded “silent\r\nMember,” who, having nothing to say, says it.\r\n\r\nThere is an old proverb at Westminster which declares that “they are\r\nthe wisest part of Parliament who use the greatest silence.” Again,\r\nin the opinion of the leaders of the Party in office he is the most\r\nuseful of Members who never consumes valuable time by speaking, but\r\nis ever at hand to vote when the bells ring out the summons to the\r\ndivision. The man who always votes at his Party’s call and never\r\ndreams of thinking for himself at all is to be found by the score\r\nin the House of Commons. But to many another M.P. it must be a sore\r\ntrial to find his opinions often dictated by his leaders and his\r\nmovements in and out of the House controlled by the Whips. Party\r\ndiscipline is strict in all the political groups, and violations of\r\nit are rarely condoned. The speech of the Member who is sincere and\r\ncourageous enough to take up an attitude independent of his Party\r\nin regard to some question of the day is received with jeers by his\r\ncolleagues, and, what is perhaps more disconcerting, with cheers by\r\nthe fellows on the other side. There are, to be sure, representatives\r\nto whom the House of Commons is but a vastly agreeable diversion\r\nfrom other pleasures and pursuits. Imagine the feelings of such an\r\neasy-going Member when, on a dull night off, an urgently worded\r\nand heavily underscored communication from the Whips demanding his\r\nimmediate attendance is delivered by special messenger at some most\r\ninopportune moment, perhaps as he is just sitting down to a pleasant\r\ndinner or is leaving his house for the Frivolity Theatre. If, prone\r\nas he is to yield to the temptation of the flesh, he should ignore\r\nthis peremptory call of Party duty, he is held guilty, like the crank\r\nand the faddist, of a grave breach of discipline. His past services\r\nin the division lobbies—on nights when the proceedings in the House\r\nwere to him a most enjoyable lark—are forgotten. He gets a solemn\r\nlecture from the Chief Whip on the enormity of his offence. Worse\r\nstill, his name is published in an official black list of defaulters,\r\nor a nasty paragraph exposing his neglect of duty appears in the\r\nnewspaper which most widely circulates in his constituency.\r\n\r\nAnd yet what model M.P., Liberal or Unionist or Labour, with all his\r\nsincere attention to the desires, the whims, the caprices of his\r\nconstituents, with all his willing surrender of private judgment to\r\nhis leaders, of personal pleasures to the Whips, can confidently feel\r\nthat his seat is safe? It is hard to get into Parliament. To remain\r\nthere is just as difficult. The insecurity of the tenure of a seat in\r\nthe House of Commons is perhaps the greatest drawback of public life.\r\nMany a man with ambition and talent for office does years of splendid\r\nservice for his Party in Opposition. The General Election comes. His\r\nParty is victorious at the polls. But he himself has been worsted in\r\nthe fight, and he has the mortification of seeing another receive the\r\noffice which would have been his in happier circumstances. To such\r\na man with his capacity for public life, with his keen enjoyment of\r\nthe Party fights in Parliament, existence outside must be barren and\r\ndreary indeed. Yet never again may he cross the charmed portals of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE FASCINATION OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nBut now that the litany of the cares and disappointments of a Member\r\nof Parliament is exhausted, there remain many compensations which\r\nmake a seat in the House of Commons an object greatly to be coveted,\r\nand well worth the physical labour, the mental worry, the demands\r\non the purse, which are involved in its attainment. Its rewards are\r\nchiefly moral and social. The gratification of having won the trust\r\nof a large body of the public comes first, perhaps. Then there is\r\nthe sense of the power and influence of the legislator. The House of\r\nCommons is the greatest and most renowned of national assemblies.\r\nTo be a Member of it is a great honour. The letters “M.P.” add\r\ndistinction to a name. That is a proper source of pride on the part\r\nof the Member himself. It is also a mark for the deference of others.\r\nThe “M.P.” is lifted out of the common run of humanity. Most of us\r\nwould look a second time at a man casually encountered in the street\r\nif we were told he was an “M.P.”\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has been called, as everyone knows, “the best\r\nclub in London.” The phrase, by the way, was used for the first\r\ntime in a novel called _Friends of Bohemia, or Phases of London\r\nLife_, written in the mid-Victorian era by E. M. Whitty, then a\r\nsketch-writer in the Reporters’ Gallery. Some say the House has lost\r\nits proud pre-eminence in that respect. There is an entire absence of\r\nclass feelings and social distinctions in the House. That the cook’s\r\nson is the equal of the duke’s son is, perhaps, more unreservedly\r\nadmitted by the duke’s son than by the cook’s son. On the other hand,\r\nthe Members will tell you that they differ too widely in class,\r\nwealth, avocations, business pursuits, and, above all, in political\r\nideas and principles, for them to be clubbable in the mass by reason\r\nof mental affinity or association of interests. Yet there is no doubt\r\nwhatever that in regard to one of the objects of a club, ministering\r\nto the personal needs and comforts of its members, the House is far\r\nbetter equipped now than ever it was in its most socially select\r\nperiod, before the Reform Act of 1832.\r\n\r\nAt that time hungry Members were able to obtain but a steak or a\r\nchop, or a pork pie, at Bellamy’s famous restaurant, which stood in\r\nOld Palace Yard immediately adjoining the old Houses of Parliament.\r\nNow they have an elaborate restaurant, very properly subsidized out\r\nof the public funds, and managed by a Kitchen Committee elected by\r\nthemselves. Before the World War an excellent meal of three courses\r\ncould be had for a shilling; and to realize what might then have\r\nbeen obtained for five shillings would stagger the imagination of a\r\ngourmand. Prices still remain below those charged for similar meals\r\nin a first-class restaurant. Even the secrets of the cellars have\r\nbeen recklessly disclosed to the electors. There is the “Valentia\r\nVat,” holding 1,000 gallons of the rarest Scotch whisky. But our\r\nrepresentatives are not stimulated by whisky alone, whether Scotch or\r\nIrish. We are also told that the cellars are always well stocked with\r\nwines.\r\n\r\nIn the old House of Commons, which was swept away by the great fire\r\nof 1834, there was but one smoking-room. What it was like Macaulay\r\ndescribes in a letter to his sister, dated July 23, 1832. “I am\r\nwriting here at eleven o’clock at night,” he said, “in the filthiest\r\nof filthy atmospheres, in the vilest of all vile company, and with\r\nthe smell of tobacco in my nostrils.” In the Palace of Westminster\r\nto-day there are several rooms devoted to the enjoyment of tobacco.\r\nThe engaging spectacle to be witnessed, by all accounts, in the\r\nchief smoking-room any night of a session suggests the question: Is\r\nthere any reality in Party conflicts? If half what M.P.’s say of\r\neach other be true, a man who is not a politician and is careful\r\nof his reputation would not like to be discovered associating with\r\nthem. Yet opponents who have just been raging furiously against\r\neach other in the Chamber, are, we are told, to be seen exchanging\r\nopinions of politics, questions and personalities, with mutual good\r\nhumour, frankness and confidence over coffee and cigarettes, in the\r\ndelightful companionship of the smoking-rooms. Political controversy\r\nhas there its fangs drawn. The only emulation between Members of\r\nopposite political parties when they foregather in clouds of tobacco\r\nsmoke is as to who will say the cheeriest word and tell the most\r\namusing story, with the result that many fast friendships between\r\nthem are formed.\r\n\r\nChess is also played. It is the only game permitted at Westminster.\r\nOne year there was a great match played over the telegraph wires\r\nbetween the House of Commons and the United States Congress, and\r\nthough at one time the defeat of America seemed imminent, the match\r\nended in a draw. In 1920 the introduction of billiards and cards was\r\nagain suggested. “It is contrary to the traditions of the House that\r\ncards and billiards should be played within the precincts,” said Sir\r\nAlfred Mond, First Commissioner of Works, in reply. Then there is\r\nthat most agreeable of all the adjuncts of the House, the Library. It\r\nconsists of five pleasant rooms overlooking the river. The bookcases\r\nare of carved oak; the volumes are beautifully bound; Members move\r\nabout silently, for all sound is deadened by the thick carpets, and\r\nthe atmosphere is delightfully pervaded with the aroma of Russian\r\nleather. The books are about 50,000 in number, mainly historical,\r\nconstitutional, legal, and political—just the works, in fact, where\r\nMembers are certain to find the necessary material for confuting each\r\nother’s arguments.\r\n\r\nThe Ladies’ Gallery, and the development of the Terrace from a\r\nlounge for Members, which was its original purpose, into a society\r\nresort, have added greatly to the attractiveness of the House of\r\nCommons. They explain the remarkable expansion, within recent years,\r\nof what may be called the fashionable side of Parliament. It must\r\nnot be supposed that this admission of ladies into Parliament by a\r\nside-door—unknown to the Constitution long before they were made\r\neligible for election by statute—has had the result of making Members\r\nneglectful of their duties. On the contrary, the social functions at\r\nWestminster during the session have the effect of keeping members,\r\nand the young members especially, more regular in their attendance,\r\nor, at least, more within hearing of the division bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBesides that, many Members of Parliament derive pleasure even from\r\nexperiences which by others are regarded as worries and vexations.\r\nTheir correspondence, with all its manifestations of strange\r\nphases of human nature, is a source of entertainment to some, and\r\nit ministers to the sense of self-importance of others. There are\r\nMembers who give an ear of affable condescension to eccentric\r\nfrequenters of the Central Hall, such as the mad engineer with\r\nhis scheme for uniting Ireland with Great Britain by a bridge\r\nthrown across the Channel, via the Isle of Man, thus consummating\r\na real tangible union between the two countries. They have a smile\r\nof welcome and a hearty handshake for all and sundry from their\r\nconstituencies who call upon them at St. Stephen’s. There are Members\r\nto whom the pressing invitations to attend bazaars, flower shows,\r\ntea meetings, smoking concerts, cricket and football matches, are\r\nflattering evidence of their popularity, and they are accepted\r\naccordingly with a rare delight.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons affords a splendid field—no better in the whole\r\nwide world—for the vain and ambitious who yearn for applause or\r\ncrave for power. Any Member can easily emerge from the obscurity of\r\nthe back benches into the full glare of the limelight. Let him but\r\nflagrantly break one of the rules of order, and his name will appear\r\nas a headline in a thousand newspapers. Then there are the material\r\nrewards. The young and ambitious are offered the dazzling prospect\r\nof office. The possession of any post in the Administration, even\r\nthe humblest, carries with it a seat on the Treasury Bench, side\r\nby side with eminent statesmen whose names are household words. It\r\ncarries also the right, when addressing the House, to stand at the\r\nTable before the famous despatch box, to lean elbow on it, and even\r\nto thump it, as an added emphasis in the very passion of argument, as\r\nwas done by all the renowned parliamentarians of the past. It is true\r\nthat keen and fierce is the competition for the higher offices in the\r\nAdministration. The House of Commons, with all its constitutional\r\nsupremacy as an institution, is composed of human beings. That being\r\nso, it is not free from the unamiable characteristics of intrigue\r\nand envy; and the qualities of resolute will and tenacity of purpose\r\nare, indeed, necessary in the ambitious young Member if he is to\r\nescape from being pushed aside or being trampled upon in the race\r\nfor office. Once on the Treasury Bench, however, he has won half\r\nthe battle for a post in the very hierarchy of the Government—the\r\nexclusive ring of Cabinet Ministers.\r\n\r\nYet the number of men in the House of Commons without social or\r\npolitical ambition is remarkably large; men, too, who are absolutely\r\nunknown outside their constituencies. They are in Parliament\r\nliterally for their health. During the day they are engaged in the\r\ndirection of great industrial and commercial undertakings, and in the\r\nevening they go down to Westminster for that rest and recuperation\r\nwhich comes with change of scene and occupation. They find the duties\r\nof an M.P. very agreeable, on the whole. The responsibilities of the\r\nposition sit lightly upon them. They find a joy in all the details of\r\nparliamentary life.\r\n\r\nMany old men, who have spent themselves in trade or finance, take to\r\npolitics in the evening of their days as a mild relaxation or hobby,\r\nand a means of prolonging life. There was once a great merchant who,\r\nwhen he left for ever his desk in the city, after an association of\r\nhalf a century, found the separation a terrible strain, and seemed\r\nlikely to pine and mope his way quickly to the grave. His medical\r\nadviser recommended him to find a seat in the House of Commons as a\r\ndistraction to relieve the monotony of his existence. But the old man\r\ndid not like the suggestion. He knew nothing of public questions.\r\nThe financial intelligence was the only portion of his morning paper\r\nwhich he had carefully studied for fifty years. “If you do not go\r\ninto the House of Commons, you will have to go to Paradise,” said the\r\ndoctor; “it is the only alternative.” “Then I will choose the House\r\nof Commons,” said the old City man, with a sigh of resignation. And\r\nhow glad he was when he became a Member! At last, something of the\r\njoy of life had really come to him.\r\n\r\nTo sit silently on the green benches during a debate, save when they\r\ncheer a supporter, or roar at an opponent, and to walk through the\r\ndivision lobbies, voting as directed by the Whips, amply satisfy\r\nthe desire of not a few Members for political thought and labour.\r\nIt is an existence that excites and soothes by turns. Disraeli once\r\nsaid to a friend who had just entered the House of Commons: “You\r\nhave chosen the only career in which a man is never old. A statesman\r\ncan feel and inspire interest longer than any other man.” A seat\r\nin the House does not, of course, make one a statesman. But, as a\r\ngeneral proposition, there is much force in Disraeli’s saying. Old\r\nmen find the fountain of youth in the halls of Westminster. It is\r\nall nonsense what one sometimes reads about the weary and trying\r\nround of parliamentary life. There are men in the House of Commons\r\nwho, after twenty, thirty, forty years of service, show no symptoms\r\nof physical exhaustion, and who will tell you that Parliament is\r\nthe most interesting and most entertaining place in the world. John\r\nMorley once spoke of the daily round of an M.P. as “business without\r\nwork and idleness without rest.” During the years he was engaged\r\nin writing his _Life of Gladstone_ he took no active part in the\r\ncontroversies of the House of Commons. But he could not keep entirely\r\naway from the place. How often had I seen that fine philosophical\r\nwriter at this particular period of his career sitting on the front\r\nOpposition Bench, at the gangway corner, his arms folded, his legs\r\ncrossed, listening, like an ordinary mortal, for hours to Members\r\nventuring to say this, not hesitating to say that, going one step\r\nfurther, adding another word, on subjects that must have had no\r\ninterest for him. The spell of the House of Commons was upon him.\r\nHe could not keep away. He had to come down, even as a distraction,\r\njust to see if anything was going on. Nothing was going on, but he\r\nremained for hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nParliamentary life has a fascination which few men, having once\r\nbreathed its intoxicating atmosphere, can successfully withstand. Its\r\ncall is irresistible. Cobden thus wrote from a retreat in Wales, in\r\nJuly, 1846, after the object of his parliamentary career, the repeal\r\nof the Corn Laws, had been achieved:\r\n\r\n  I am going into the wilderness to pray for a return of the taste I\r\n  once possessed for nature, and simple, quiet life. Here I am, one\r\n  day from Manchester, in the loveliest valley out of Paradise. Ten\r\n  years ago, before I was an agitator, I spent a day or two in this\r\n  house. Comparing my sensations now with those I then experienced,\r\n  I feel how much I have lost in winning public fame. The rough\r\n  tempest has spoiled for me a quiet haven. I feel I shall never be\r\n  able to cast anchor again. It seems as if some mesmeric hand were\r\n  on my brain, or that I was possessed by an unquiet fiend urging me\r\n  forward in spite of myself.\r\n\r\nHowever disappointed a Member may be in failing to realize his dreams\r\nof political ambition and social success, there remains for him the\r\nconsoling thought—indeed, the great reward—that he has the honour of\r\nserving the State, of helping in the management of national affairs,\r\nof guiding the destinies of a mighty Commonwealth. No wonder that\r\nmost Members quit this exalted and historic scene reluctantly, with\r\nthe deepest regret—aye, with breaking hearts. Should so great a\r\nmisfortune befall them of being rejected from further service by\r\ntheir constituents at the General Election, they long to return again\r\nto the green benches. Complacently to settle down to the humdrum of\r\nprivate life is for many of them impossible.\r\n\r\nEven the old and worn agitators who have voluntarily resigned\r\npine to be in the thick of the shoutings of the rival Parties,\r\nand the trampings through the division lobbies. There was William\r\nWilberforce, the emancipator of the slaves. Sir Samuel Romilly, who\r\nsat in the House of Commons in 1807, when slavery within the British\r\nEmpire was finally abolished, said of Wilberforce: “He can lay his\r\nhead upon his pillow and remember that the slave trade was no more.”\r\nBut was Wilberforce content to be out of Parliament even in his\r\nextreme old age? Hannah Macaulay relates that in 1830, while staying\r\nat Highwood Hill, the guest of Wilberforce, she got a letter from\r\nher brother, enclosing an offer to him from Lord Lansdowne of the\r\nseat for the pocket borough of Calne. She showed the communication to\r\nWilberforce. “He was silent for a moment,” she writes, “and then his\r\nmobile face lighted up, and he slapped his hand to his ear and cried:\r\n‘Ah! I hear that shout again! Hear, hear! What a life it was!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPALACE OF WESTMINSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Westminster, in which Lords and Commons meet—the\r\nlargest and most imposing Gothic building in the world—may be\r\nregarded, rising so nobly on the left bank of the Thames, as\r\nan expression in architecture of the dignity and stability of\r\nParliament, and the honour in which it is held by the Nation. Most\r\nvisitors to the Palace reach it by Whitehall or Victoria Street. On\r\nthat side are the entrances to both Houses. It is more picturesque,\r\nbut less imposing, than the river front. The inclusion of Westminster\r\nHall—the only overground portion of the old Palace saved from the\r\nfire of 1834—enforced the breaking up of the western or land front\r\nof the new Palace into a variety of façades. The light and shade\r\nproduced by the massive grey masonry of the ancient Hall, mingling\r\nwith the Gothic gracefulness of the new Palace, is very beautiful,\r\nand also pregnant with historic meaning. It reminds one of the\r\nsurvival of tradition in the forms and ceremonies of Parliament.\r\nThe effect of this blending of the past and present is heightened\r\nby the close contiguity of the venerable Abbey, and the open grassy\r\nspace, known as Parliament Square, with its effigies of great\r\nVictorian statesmen—Sir Robert Peel, Lord Palmerston, the Earl of\r\nDerby, and Lord Beaconsfield—which front the forecourt of the Palace;\r\nand the striking figure of Oliver Cromwell, with sword and Bible,\r\non the sunken grass plot by the side of Westminster Hall. To the\r\ncontemplative mind the long history of government and administration\r\nis presented—its struggles, its controversies, its failures, its\r\nsuccesses.\r\n\r\nBut the most impressive view of the Palace to the eye is obtained\r\nfrom the opposite bank of the Thames. Standing beneath the aged and\r\nhoary Lambeth Palace on the Surrey side—town house of the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury—and looking across the river, especially when the\r\nmighty waterway is at its full tide, one realizes more completely\r\nthe Gothic stateliness of this temple of legislation, the outcome of\r\nthe constructive genius of Sir Charles Barry, and the graceful fancy\r\nof Augustus Welby Pugin. The long façade above the river wall and\r\nterrace, its uniform symmetry, the lightness and grace of its stone\r\ncarving, the many steeples and pinnacles—beginning with the delicate\r\ntracery of the lofty Clock Tower, close to Westminster Bridge, and\r\nterminating with the solid massiveness of the colossal Victoria\r\nTower—form altogether a most imposing masterpiece in architecture,\r\nworthy of the ancient and august National Assembly which deliberates\r\nwithin its walls, that mother of representative institutions which\r\nperhaps is the greatest gift of the English race to mankind. So it is\r\nthat something of the secret of the high place which Parliament holds\r\nin popular esteem and pride may be found in the grandeur of its home.\r\nAt any rate, the spectacle presented by the Palace of Westminster\r\ndoes impress the mind with the glory of the purpose of Parliament and\r\nits might. Here we see the apotheosis of politics, the science of the\r\nprogress and well-being of humanity, and the temple in which it is\r\nfittingly served.\r\n\r\nThus at Westminster we have not only the flower or the fruit of the\r\nnational life in the guidance of the State aright, but its roots\r\nand fibres going deep down to the very bedrock of the past. For\r\nmore than six centuries the grand inquest of the Nation has sat at\r\nWestminster. At first it was a council of the great and wise summoned\r\nby the King personally. When Edward I, “the great law-giver,”\r\nsent to the sheriffs writs for the election of two knights for\r\neach shire, two citizens for each city, two burgesses for each\r\nborough, in addition to himself calling together the prelates and\r\nthe nobles, the principle of popular election came into operation.\r\nThe Parliament thus elected and known as the “Model Parliament” was\r\nreally representative of the Nation at large. It met in the Palace\r\nof Westminster so long ago as November, 1295. For over a century\r\nthe three estates of the realm—the Prelates, the Nobles, and the\r\nCommons—deliberated together. The division of Parliament into two\r\nHouses—one for the Peers, spiritual and temporal, and the other for\r\nthe Commons—took place in 1377, the last year of the reign of Edward\r\nIII. The Lords have always met in the Palace of Westminster. The\r\nCommons for the best part of two centuries assembled in the Chapter\r\nHouse, or the Refectory, of Westminster Abbey. They held their last\r\nsitting there on the day that Henry VIII died.\r\n\r\nHenry’s son and successor, Edward VI, gave St. Stephen’s\r\nChapel—within the Palace of Westminster—to the Commons for their\r\nmeeting place in 1547, the first year of his reign, and there the\r\nrepresentatives of the people regularly met and deliberated until\r\nthe place was destroyed by fire in 1834. This Chapel, built by\r\nEdward III in 1327, the first year of his reign, on the ruins of the\r\noriginal St. Stephen’s Chapel (which was provided by King Stephen\r\nin 1147 for the use of the inhabitants of the Palace, and dedicated\r\nby him to the first Christian martyr) was in the beautiful Gothic\r\nof the period, and Italian artists were brought to London to adorn\r\nits walls with religious frescoes. After the Reformation, when the\r\nChapel was transferred from the Crown to the House of Commons, these\r\nmural paintings were covered over with a plain, decorous wainscot,\r\nwhich in the gay times of Charles II was in turn hidden behind rich\r\ntapestry hangings. These tapestries disappeared in the alterations\r\nmade by Sir Christopher Wren in 1707, after the Union of England and\r\nScotland, so as to provide accommodation for the forty-five Members\r\nfrom Scotland. The Chamber underwent a final transformation in 1800,\r\nwhen, as a result of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, seats\r\nfor 100 additional Members had to be found. The old wainscot was\r\nthen taken down; and although the paintings of the Italian artists\r\nof the fourteenth century were found to be in a perfect state of\r\npreservation, they were demolished likewise to make room for the\r\nrequired two extra lines of benches on each side. There were now five\r\nrows of benches on either side, divided, as in the present Chamber,\r\nby a gangway. The Speaker’s Chair was at the top of the Chamber,\r\nwhere the altar originally stood. It was a carved oak armchair,\r\nsurmounted with the Royal Arms of England. Below it, as now, was the\r\nClerk’s table.\r\n\r\nThe old House of Lords, like the old House of Commons, was an oblong\r\nchamber with rows of benches on each side running up from the floor\r\nto the walls. On the walls hung tapestries, divided into compartments\r\nby oak frames, illustrating scenes from the defeat of the Spanish\r\nArmada in 1588, and with medallion portraits of the principal English\r\nnaval captains woven in the borders. They were the gifts of the\r\nStates of Holland to Queen Elizabeth in commemoration of England’s\r\ngreat deliverance and the ruined dream of Spain. The Throne on which\r\nall the Sovereigns of England from 1550 to 1834—from Edward VI to\r\nWilliam IV—sat on the assembling of Parliament was at the top of the\r\nChamber. It was a carved gilt armchair standing on a dais. The seat\r\nwas lined with crimson velvet. Two gilt Corinthian pillars supported\r\na canopy, also of crimson velvet, and the whole was surmounted by a\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nBetween the two Houses lay the Painted Chamber, a survival of the\r\noriginal Palace, erected by Edward the Confessor, who indeed used\r\nthis particular room as a sleeping apartment and died in it. Its\r\nwalls were painted with battle scenes by direction of Henry III in\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century, and hence its name. Here the\r\nCourt, before which Charles I was arraigned, sat for the concluding\r\ndays of the trial. Here Oliver Cromwell and Henry Martin blacked each\r\nother’s faces in fun, like giddy young schoolboys, as they signed the\r\nwarrant which condemned the King to the headsman’s axe. The Chamber\r\nwas also used for conferences between representatives of both Houses\r\nwhen they differed in regard to a Bill. At these meetings the Peers\r\nwere seated and wore their hats, while the Commons had humbly to\r\nstand uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThus the old Palace of Westminster was historically of great\r\ninterest. But it had no pretensions to beauty. It was just an\r\narchitectural patchwork, added to from time to time without any sense\r\nof order or unity of design. Interiorily, it was also confined and\r\nuncommodious. Yet the idea of pulling it down to give place to a\r\nbuilding of nobler proportions and one more suitable to its great\r\npurpose was not relished. In the very last session of the Commons\r\nthat was held in St. Stephen’s Chapel Joseph Hume proposed that new\r\nHouses of Parliament should be built in the Green Park. The motion\r\nwas rejected. Four or five months later, as the buildings were\r\nenveloped in flames, one of the spectators wittily cried out: “There\r\nis Joe Hume’s motion being carried without a division.”\r\n\r\nThe great conflagration which destroyed the Palace was on the night\r\nof Thursday, October 16, 1834. The Whig Ministry, under Earl Grey,\r\nthat carried the Reform Act of 1832, broke up in July on the question\r\nof appropriating a portion of the revenues of the Church in Ireland\r\nto secular purposes, and was succeeded by another Whig Administration\r\nwith Lord Melbourne as Prime Minister. Parliament was prorogued on\r\nAugust 15th by King William IV in person. It was to meet again on\r\nOctober 23rd. When that day came the ancient Palace of Westminster\r\nwas a thing of the past. At first it was thought the fire was\r\nthe work of political incendiaries. But a Committee of the Privy\r\nCouncil found, after a long and searching investigation, that it was\r\ndue solely to human stupidity. An immense quantity of old wooden\r\n“tallies” or notched sticks, originally used as receipts for sums\r\npaid into the Exchequer, had accumulated at Westminster, and, after\r\nthe abolition of this barbaric mode of keeping the national accounts\r\nand the substitution of pens, ink and paper, in 1826, the sticks were\r\nused as firewood in the Government offices. As the room in which\r\nthe remaining “tallies” were stored at Westminster was required for\r\nanother purpose, two men were employed all day, on October 16, 1834,\r\nin getting rid of the sticks by burning them in the stove under the\r\nHouse of Lords by which that Chamber was heated. At five o’clock they\r\nwent home. At half-past six the House of Lords was found to be on\r\nfire. The heat from the over-charged flues had ignited the panelling\r\nof the Chamber. The progress of the flames could not be stayed, and\r\ngradually the conflagration swept over the whole mass of buildings.\r\nThus did the ancient Palace of Westminster disappear through an act\r\nof almost incredible carelessness. All that remained of the historic\r\nfabric were the cloisters of the old St. Stephen’s Chapel (or House\r\nof Commons), the crypt beneath the Chapel, in which the Speaker used\r\nto entertain Members at dinners and other social functions, and,\r\nhappily, Westminster Hall, with its centuried associations of great\r\nmen and historic deeds. Practically everything else was destroyed,\r\nincluding the Throne in the House of Lords and the Chair in the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nOn October 23, 1834, the day appointed for the reassembling of\r\nParliament, the two Houses met for a brief and formal sitting amid\r\nacres of still smouldering ruins, the Lords within the charred walls\r\nof their library, and the Commons in an adjoining committee-room.\r\nIt was decided temporarily to fit up the House of Lords for the use\r\nof the Commons, and the Painted Chamber for the use of the Lords,\r\nand a sum of £30,000 was voted for the purpose. A Royal Commission\r\nwas also appointed to superintend the construction of a new Palace\r\nof Westminster. Parliament then adjourned. On November 14th King\r\nWilliam dismissed the Melbourne Ministry, and Sir Robert Peel was\r\ncommanded to form a new Administration. On the advice of the Prime\r\nMinister, the King dissolved Parliament on December 29th, and the\r\nnew Parliament met on February 19, 1835, in the temporary buildings,\r\nwhich continued to be used till the completion of the present Palace\r\nof Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAmong the immense crowd which witnessed the grand and terrible\r\nspectacle of the burning of the old Houses of Parliament on that\r\nnight in October 1834 was an architect named Charles Barry. He had\r\nknown and loved the ancient and historic pile from his earliest\r\nyears, for, born in 1795, the son of a stationer who had a shop in\r\nBridge Street, opposite the Houses of Parliament, he had grown to\r\nmanhood under its very shadow. Parliament decided to have an open\r\ncompetition for designs of the new legislative buildings. The only\r\ncondition imposed was that the style should be either Gothic or\r\nElizabethan. As many as ninety-seven architects entered the lists.\r\nThe successful competitor was Barry for his Gothic plan. He was\r\nforty years old at the time. In superintending the building and\r\ninternal decoration of the Palace—subject to the control of the\r\nRoyal Commission—Barry was assisted by Augustus Welby Pugin, another\r\narchitect and an authority on the Gothic style. Hume’s idea of\r\nremoving the Houses of Parliament to the Green Park was revived, but\r\nthe historic associations of Westminster made too great an appeal.\r\nMoreover, was not the Duke of Wellington of opinion—far-seeing man\r\nthat he was—that the site by the river was the best, as it would be\r\nfool-hardy to have the Houses of Parliament accessible on all sides\r\nto an attacking mob?\r\n\r\nThe river wall was begun in 1837. The buildings were not commenced\r\nuntil three years later. The selection of the stone received the\r\nanxious consideration of the Commissioners. Finally the hard\r\nmagnesian limestone from Anston, in Yorkshire, was selected for the\r\nexterior of the buildings, and French Caen stone for the interior.\r\nThen, on April 27, 1840, the first stone—it may be seen from\r\nWestminster Bridge in the south-east angle of the plinth of the\r\nSpeaker’s House—was laid without any public ceremony by the wife of\r\nthe architect, and the vast edifice was raised on a bed of concrete,\r\n12 feet thick. Exactly seven years later—April 15, 1847—the Lords\r\nfirst occupied their House; and at the opening of the session of\r\n1852, on November 4th, the Commons assembled in their new Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the building was beset with many difficulties and\r\nvexations for the designer. The Palace was originally expected to be\r\nfinished in six years, at a cost of £800,000, exclusive of furniture\r\nand fittings. Twenty years passed before it was fully completed, and\r\nover £2,000,000 was expended upon it. The Treasury refused to pay\r\nBarry an architect’s professional fees of 5 per cent. upon the outlay\r\non the works executed under his direction, and fixed his remuneration\r\nat £25,000, or £23,000 less than he held he was entitled to. His\r\ndesigns were also subjected to continuous criticism and attack by\r\nother architects. However, he was knighted on the completion of his\r\nsplendid work. Dying suddenly at Clapham Common on May 12, 1860, his\r\nremains were honoured by a grave in Westminster Abbey. His statue by\r\nJohn Henry Foley stands at the foot of the great staircase leading to\r\nthe committee-rooms of the Houses of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nProbably no feature of London is so familiar in the metropolis, or\r\nso widely known by name in the provinces, as the famous clock of the\r\nHouses of Parliament. No visitor to London would think of returning\r\nhome without having seen “Big Ben” and heard him chiming the quarters\r\nand booming out the hour. During the summer season hundreds of\r\nthousands of strangers, not only from the provinces, but from far-off\r\nlands, gaze up at his massive, honest face, proud and delighted to\r\nhave made the acquaintance of so great a London celebrity. It is the\r\nlargest clock in the world. Each of the four dials, there being one\r\nfor each point of the compass, is of white enamelled glass and 23\r\nfeet in diameter. The minute marks on the dial look as if they were\r\nclose together. They are 14 inches apart. The numerals are two feet\r\nlong. The minute hand is 14 feet, and the hour hand six feet. To wind\r\nthe clock takes about five hours. The time is regulated by electric\r\ncommunication with Greenwich Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe clock has a large bell to toll the hours and four smaller ones\r\nto chime the quarters. The large bell is called “Big Ben,” after Sir\r\nBenjamin Hall, who was First Commissioner of Works when the Clock\r\nTower was erected. It weighs 13½ tons. Twenty men could stand under\r\nit. For a clapper it has a piece of iron 2 feet long, 12 inches in\r\ndiameter, and weighing 12 cwt. No wonder, then, that there are few\r\nthings more impressive than “Big Ben” tolling the hour of twelve, in\r\nhis slow, measured and solemn tones, especially at midnight, when\r\nthe roar of London is hushed in slumber. And what is said by the\r\nfull chime of bells before the striking of each hour? Here is the\r\nverse, simple and beautiful, to which the chime—a run of notes from\r\nthe accompaniment to “I know that my Redeemer liveth” in Handel’s\r\n_Messiah_—is set:\r\n\r\n      Lord, through this hour\r\n        Be Thou our guide,\r\n      That by Thy Power\r\n        No foot may slide.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of Parliament a brilliant steady light, blazing\r\nfrom a lantern over “Big Ben,” may be seen at night from most parts\r\nof London. It indicates that the House of Commons is sitting. So\r\nlong as the representatives of the people are in conclave, the light\r\nflashes its white flame through the darkness. It vanishes the moment\r\nthe House rises. A wire runs from the lantern down to a room under\r\nthe floor of the House of Commons, and when the question, “That this\r\nHouse do now adjourn” is agreed to, a man stationed below pulls a\r\nswitch, which instantly extinguishes the light. When this beacon was\r\nfirst set on high, and for many years after, it shone only towards\r\nthe west, for it was thought unlikely than an M.P. would dwell in, or\r\neven visit, any other quarter of the town. But with the extension of\r\nthe franchise Parliament became democratized, and a new lantern was\r\nprovided which sheds its beams in the direction of Peckham as well\r\nas of Pall Mall. The light should be regarded by all who see it as a\r\nsacred symbol of the fire of liberty, law and justice ever burning in\r\nthe House of Commons. Another comparatively recent innovation is the\r\nflying of the Union Jack from the iron flagstaff, 64 feet high, which\r\ntops the 336 feet of the Victoria Tower, on days that Parliament is\r\nsitting. Only the Royal Standard was seen, before that, on the rare\r\noccasions that Queen Victoria came to open Parliament in person.\r\nSmall as the Union Jack seems to the upturned gaze of persons in the\r\nstreets, it is of remarkable dimensions, being 60 feet long and 45\r\nfeet wide. I saw one day the flag of another country flying for the\r\nfirst time side by side with the Union Jack over the Victoria Tower.\r\nIt was the Stars and Stripes. The day was April 20, 1917—the day on\r\nwhich the United States joined France, Italy and England in the War\r\nagainst Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Westminster covers an area of nine acres. Eleven courts\r\nor quadrangles give light and air to its 1,200 or 1,300 rooms, its\r\nhundred staircases, and its two miles of corridors. In the very heart\r\nof the Palace is the great Central Hall, above which rises a tower\r\nterminating in a spire, and right and left of the Hall are the two\r\nHouses of Parliament—the Commons’ Chamber nearer to the Clock Tower,\r\nthe Lords’ Chamber nearer to the Victoria Tower—while about them lie\r\nthe retiring rooms of their respective Members and the homes of their\r\nprincipal officers. There, used to be twenty official residences in\r\nthe Palace. They have been considerably reduced in order to provide\r\nmore accommodation for Members. Still, on the Commons side, the\r\nSpeaker, the Clerk and the Sergeant-at-Arms are commodiously housed.\r\nIn the old Palace a Minister had no escape from the House of Commons\r\nexcept the Library or smoking-room, which were available to all\r\nMembers, and one gathers from the published recollections of old\r\nparliamentarians that it was not seemly for a Cabinet Minister to be\r\nseen there. “The place for a Minister,” it used to be said, “if _at_\r\nthe House, is _in_ the House.” In the new Palace every Minister has\r\na private room in the corridors at the back of the Speaker’s Chair,\r\nin which he may transact departmental business and receive visitors,\r\nwhen his presence in the House is not particularly required.\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance to the Palace of Westminster is by St.\r\nStephen’s Porch, in Old Palace Yard. Immediately to the left\r\nextends the wonderful and impressive Westminster Hall, the\r\nthrilling associations of which must quicken the pulses of the\r\nleast imaginative. Straight ahead lies St. Stephen’s Hall, leading\r\nto the Central Hall of the Houses of Parliament. This noble hall\r\nis traversed daily, during the session, by thousands of the public\r\non their way to or from the Legislative Chambers. How many pay\r\nheed to its strange vicissitudes? It occupies the site of old St.\r\nStephen’s Chapel (originally the Chapel Royal of the ancient Palace\r\nof Westminster), in which, as I have said, the Commons sat regularly\r\nfrom the sixteenth century to the nineteenth. In the building of the\r\nnew Palace, St. Stephen’s Hall was raised on the vaulted foundations\r\nof St. Stephen’s Chapel. The positions of the Speaker’s Chair and the\r\nTable are marked by brass plates set in the floor of St. Stephen’s\r\nHall. Here it was that one of the most historic of parliamentary\r\nincidents took place. On this very spot stood Charles I and Mr.\r\nSpeaker Lenthal when the King demanded whether there were then\r\npresent in the House the five Members, including Pym and Hampden,\r\nwho had promoted the Grand Remonstrance against his unconstitutional\r\naction, and the Speaker made his famous reply: “I have neither eyes\r\nto see nor tongue to speak in this place, but as the House is pleased\r\nto direct me, whose servant I am,” and when the angry cries of\r\n“Privilege, Privilege!” raised by Members were the presage of civil\r\nwar. St. Stephen’s Hall fittingly contains statues of twelve of the\r\ngreatest and wisest statesmen whose voices so often rang through\r\nthe old House of Commons. The statesmen thus honoured are Selden,\r\nHampden, Falkland, Clarendon, Somers, Walpole, Chatham, Mansfield,\r\nBurke, Fox, Pitt and Grattan; and the selection was made by the\r\nhistorians Macaulay and Hallam.\r\n\r\nBeneath St. Stephen’s Hall is the old crypt of St. Stephen’s Chapel.\r\nLike the Chapel, it was originally used for religious services. For\r\ncenturies after the Reformation it was used as a place for shooting\r\nrubbish. About a quarter of a century before the fire of 1834 it\r\nwas converted into a dining-room in which the dinners given by the\r\nSpeaker to Members took place. After the fire the crypt was restored\r\nto its original purpose, and for a time was a place of worship for\r\nthe numerous residents within the area of the Palace of Westminster.\r\nIt is the most beautiful place in the Palace, with its altar, inlaid\r\nmarble floor, walls of mosaic and groined ceiling. It is also a place\r\nof solitude and silence. Not for years has it been used as a place of\r\nworship. The only sound to which it now re-echoes is the cry of the\r\ninfant as the water of baptism is poured on its head. One of the few\r\nprivileges of an M.P. is that a child born to him may be christened\r\nin St. Stephen’s Crypt.\r\n\r\nA new Member is not many hours in the Palace of Westminster before he\r\nhas secured the special peg for his hat and overcoat in the beautiful\r\ncloisters of old St. Stephen’s, which has been turned into a\r\ncloak-room for the Commons; obtained one of the long rows of lockers,\r\nor presses, in the corridors, immediately surrounding the Chamber,\r\nto which each Member is entitled, for storing books and papers;\r\nenjoyed a pipe or cigar in the smoking-room; had a meal in one of\r\nthe several dining-rooms; read the newspapers in the news-room, or\r\nmade himself acquainted with some of the contents of the extensive\r\nLibrary; strolled on the Terrace; had tea in the tea-room, and\r\ndispatched numbers of letters on the official stationery of the House\r\nto relatives and friends giving his first impressions of the scene\r\nwhere glory or obscurity awaits him as a representative of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nOne of the most pleasant adjuncts of the House of Commons is the\r\nlarge and lofty suite of rooms overlooking the Thames, which is\r\ndevoted to the Library. But there is more in these apartments than\r\nbooks. They also contain some rare and most interesting historical\r\nrelics, parliamentary and political. Here in a glass case is shown\r\na manuscript volume, stained and mouldered, of the old Journals of\r\nthe House of Commons. The writing on the pages that are open is not\r\neasily decipherable. But it is well worth while endeavouring to\r\nperuse it, for it is the official chronicle of the raid of Charles I\r\non the House of Commons. The shaky handwriting tells of the agitation\r\nof the Clerk when he made the record.\r\n\r\nIn the Library is also to be seen a memento of a curious privilege\r\nenjoyed of old by Members of Parliament. This is a collection of\r\nenvelopes franked by eminent Members of both Houses. It comprises\r\nabout 10,000 signatures, and covers the period from 1784 to 1840,\r\nwhen franking was abolished. By the system of franking, Peers and\r\nCommons had the free delivery of letters posted by themselves and\r\ntheir friends. It was introduced in 1660 to relieve Members of some\r\nof the expenses incurred in the discharge of their national duties.\r\nBut this freedom of the Post Office was not confined to letters.\r\nHousehold furniture and even a pack of hounds were sent free through\r\nthe post by M.P.’s in England, and in Ireland an M.P. franked his\r\nwife and children from Galway to Dublin and back on a holiday trip.\r\nMembers also signed packets of letters wholesale and gave them away\r\nto friends. One noble lord thereby franked the tidings of his own\r\ndeath. He died suddenly at his desk after addressing some covers to\r\nfriends, and the family economically used the covers to tell those\r\nfriends that he had passed away. Ultimately, in the last decade of\r\nthe eighteenth century, the daily allowance to each Member of both\r\nHouses was limited to ten sent by himself and fifteen received by\r\nhim. All such letters had to bear on their covers the signatures of\r\nthose who franked them. In the House of Commons collection are to\r\nbe seen the autographs of archbishops and bishops, of Peers and of\r\nCommoners, including such celebrities as Nelson, Byron, Canning, Fox,\r\nPeel, Palmerston, Wellington, Clive, Cobbett, Grattan, O’Connell and\r\nGladstone. In the year 1837 as many as 7,400,000 franked letters\r\nwere posted, at an estimated loss to the revenue of the Post Office\r\nof over £1,000,000. At the same time all sorts of devices had to be\r\nresorted to by the poor to evade the heavy postage, from 10d. to 1s.\r\n6d., which was then charged for letters. Rowland Hill, the author of\r\nthe penny postal system, used to underline words in newspapers which\r\nhe sent home—a Whig politician’s name to indicate that he was well,\r\nand a Tory’s that he was ill. Franking was abolished in 1840, on the\r\nestablishment of the penny post. Members, however, are still entitled\r\nto the privilege of sending free through the post a limited number\r\nof copies of a Bill to their constituents, by endorsing the covering\r\nwrapper with their signatures.\r\n\r\nThe table of the old House of Commons, which was designed by Sir\r\nChristopher Wren in 1706, and at which Burke, Pitt, Fox, Canning\r\nand Peel stood while addressing the House, was found in the ruins,\r\nafter the fire of 1834, almost uninjured. It is now preserved\r\nin the tea-room. In one of the smoking-rooms is to be seen an\r\ninteresting memorial of Henry Broadhurst, one of the first of the\r\nLabour members. In a glass case are the mallet and chisels used by\r\nhim as a stonemason employed on the buildings of the new Palace of\r\nWestminster, which he was afterwards to enter, not only as a Member,\r\nbut as a Minister, for he served as Under-Secretary of the Home\r\nDepartment in 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe old Houses of Parliament had no such pleasant lounge as the\r\nTerrace, which extends the whole length of the river front. On\r\nsummer nights Members who desired a blow of fresh air promenaded old\r\nWestminster Bridge. “It was a beautiful, rosy, dead calm morning when\r\nwe broke up a little before five to-day,” wrote Francis Jeffrey, M.P.\r\nand editor of the _Edinburgh Review_, to a friend on April 20, 1831,\r\nin reference to a late and stormy sitting over the first Reform Bill,\r\n“and I took three pensive turns along the solitude of Westminster\r\nBridge, admiring the sharp clearness of St. Paul’s, and all the city\r\nspires soaring up in a cloudless sky, the orange-red light that was\r\nbeginning to play on the trees of the Abbey and the old windows of\r\nthe Speaker’s house, and the flat green mist of the river floating\r\nupon a few lazy hulks on the tide and moving low under the arches.\r\nIt was a curious contrast with the long previous imprisonment in\r\nthe stifling, roaring House, amid dying candles, and every sort of\r\nexhalation.” If Jeffrey could return from the Shades and see the\r\nTerrace, especially on a fine afternoon in June or July, when “five\r\no’clock tea” is being served, how amazed he would be, and how he\r\nwould curse his fate that he should have been born a century or so\r\ntoo soon! Perhaps? For there are legislators who think that “Tea on\r\nthe Terrace” is a function lowering to the dignity of Parliament.\r\nA part of the Terrace is reserved for their sole use by a notice,\r\n“For Members Only,” where they may ruminate in gloomy aloofness\r\nundisturbed by the smiles of beauty and the rustle of her skirts.\r\n\r\nAs the new Member explores the corridors and rooms, he will see\r\nthe walls hung with portraits of all the Prime Ministers, all the\r\nSpeakers, and a long line of Chancellors of the Exchequer, besides\r\nthose of other distinguished politicians who never attained to\r\noffice. Apart from their innate interest as counterfeit presentments\r\nof great statesmen, in mezzotints or line engravings, these pictures\r\nshould stimulate the ambition of the new Member to make a name\r\nfor himself. There is one way in which the new Member may employ\r\nhis leisure at Westminster with profit to the tax-payer. That\r\nis to follow the excellent example set by Passmore Edwards, the\r\nphilanthropist, who sat in Parliament for a number of years in the\r\nlast quarter of the nineteenth century. Writing in his autobiography,\r\n_A Few Footprints_, he says:\r\n\r\n  I would write the words “Waste not, want not” over the doors of\r\n  parliament houses, palaces, cottages, workshops and kitchens; and\r\n  if the spirit and meaning of the motto were put in practice the\r\n  world would spin through space with a double joy. While a Member\r\n  of Parliament I always, when opportunity offered, lowered the gas\r\n  within reach that was burning to waste. I did so for a double\r\n  reason—to prevent waste and to preserve the purity of the air of\r\n  the House; but I never saw or heard of any other Member or servant\r\n  of the House doing a similar thing.\r\n\r\n“True political economy,” Edwards adds, “is in reality true moral\r\neconomy. I hate waste anywhere and everywhere.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nASSEMBLING OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe procedure of Parliament is very ancient. An old-world spirit\r\nanimates especially the quaint and curious ceremonies that mark the\r\nassembling of a new Parliament. The House of Commons is crowded.\r\nWhat a number of strange faces are in the throng! It is easy to\r\ndistinguish the new Members by the eager looks of curiosity and\r\nwonder, not unmixed with triumph, with which they gaze on every\r\nfeature of the historic Chamber and follow every movement of the\r\nofficials, and the shyness with which they cheer, or indulge in\r\nforms of applause unfamiliar to the House, such as the clapping of\r\nhands, as their leaders appear and take their places on the two front\r\nbenches—the Treasury Bench on one side and the Opposition Bench on\r\nthe other. But this shyness soon disappears. There is a story told\r\nthat an old Member was thus addressed by a new Member at the opening\r\nof a new Parliament: “If you please, sir, where do the Members for\r\nboroughs sit?” The incident was told to Disraeli, who was much\r\ndiverted. “Yes,” said he, “and in three months we shall have that\r\nMember bawling and bellowing and making such a row there will be no\r\nholding him!” At one time county Members and borough Members were\r\ndistinct not only in class, but in manners and dress. The ancient\r\ndistinction between “Knight of the Shire,” “Citizen of the City,”\r\n“Burgess of the Borough,” was removed by the Ballot Act of 1872, all\r\nrepresentatives being grouped as “Members of the House of Commons.”\r\n\r\nAs yet they are without a head. They have no Speaker. In fact, the\r\nHouse of Commons has not yet been constituted. It is only when the\r\nSpeaker is elected and the Members have taken the oath of allegiance\r\nand signed the Roll that the House really begins its corporate\r\nexistence. The first thing to be done, therefore, is for this throng\r\nto obtain that coherency, that solidarity, which is given to an\r\nassembly by the appointment of a president. Until the Speaker is\r\nelected, the Clerk, sitting in wig and gown at the Table, assumes the\r\ndirection of affairs. But before the Commons can appoint a Speaker\r\nthey must have the consent of the Sovereign, and that is given them\r\nat the Bar of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the buzz of conversation, the interchange of jokes, and the\r\nlaughter which follows, are stilled by a stentorian cry of “Black\r\nRod.” It comes from the door-keeper in the lobby outside. Presently\r\n“Black Rod,” the messenger of the House of Lords, appears. He is\r\nnever allowed free access to the House of Commons. The doors are\r\nclosed in his face by the Serjeant-at-Arms, and he has to knock for\r\nadmission before it is granted to him. He walks slowly up the floor,\r\ncarrying in his right hand a short ebony rod tipped with gold, the\r\nemblem of his office. On reaching the Table “Black Rod” delivers\r\nhis message, which is an invitation to the Commons to come to the\r\nHouse of Lords. Then, retreating backwards down the floor to the\r\nBar, he waits until joined by the Clerk, when the two officials walk\r\nacross the intervening lobbies to the House of Lords, followed by a\r\nstruggling crowd of new Members, determined not to miss anything,\r\nshoving and jostling each other in their eagerness to secure good\r\nplaces in the “Gilded Chamber.”\r\n\r\n“Gilded Chamber,” indeed! Gladstone’s most appropriate description of\r\nthe House of Lords springs at once to the mind, such is its gorgeous\r\ncolouring in which gold predominates, and its glow and sparkle,\r\nespecially when the electric lights are on. The first thing that\r\narrests the eye of the spectator is the Throne, provided with two\r\nchairs for the King and Queen, and emblazoned with the Royal Arms,\r\non a dais at the top of the Chamber. It is unoccupied, but seated on\r\na bench beneath it, all in a row, are five Lords, arrayed in ample\r\nred robes, slashed with ermine or white fur, and three-cornered hats.\r\nThese are the Lords Commissioners, to whom the King delegates his\r\nauthority in matters parliamentary when his Majesty is not present in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commons, headed by the Clerk, stand huddled together at\r\nthe Bar, the Lord Chancellor—the central personage among the Lords\r\nCommissioners—without rising from his seat or even lifting his hat\r\nby way of salutation, informs them that his Majesty has been pleased\r\nto issue Letters Patent under the Great Seal constituting a Royal\r\nCommission to do all things in his Majesty’s name necessary to the\r\nholding of the Parliament. He then addresses the Members of the two\r\nHouses of the Legislature in the following words:\r\n\r\n  My Lords and Gentlemen,—We have it in command from his Majesty\r\n  to let you know that his Majesty will, as soon as the Members of\r\n  both Houses shall be sworn, declare the causes of his calling this\r\n  Parliament; and it being necessary that a Speaker of the House of\r\n  Commons shall be first chosen, it is his Majesty’s pleasure that\r\n  you, gentlemen of the House of Commons, repair to the place where\r\n  you are to sit and there proceed to the choice of some proper\r\n  person to be your Speaker, and that you present such person whom\r\n  you shall so choose here to-morrow at twelve o’clock for his\r\n  Majesty’s Royal approbation.\r\n\r\nThen the Clerk and the Members of the House of Commons, without a\r\nword having been spoken on their side, return to their Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe election of Speaker is at once proceeded with in the House\r\nof Commons. There is no ceremony at Westminster more novel and\r\ninteresting, and none that illustrates more strikingly the continuity\r\nthrough the centuries of parliamentary customs. The Clerk of the\r\nHouse of Commons presides. He sits in his own seat at the Table.\r\nImmediately behind him is the untenanted high-canopied Chair of the\r\nSpeaker. The Mace, that glittering emblem of the Speaker’s authority,\r\nis invisible. The Clerk may not speak a word in the discharge of\r\nhis duties on this great occasion. All he is permitted to do is to\r\nrise and silently point with outstretched finger at the Member who,\r\naccording to previous arrangement, is to propose the candidate for\r\nthe Chair, and later on to indicate in the same dumb way the Member\r\nwho is to second the motion. If there is to be no contest, and at\r\nthe assembling of a new Parliament the former Speaker is invariably\r\nre-elected unanimously, the motion that he “do take the Chair of this\r\nHouse as Speaker” is made by a leading unofficial Ministerialist,\r\nand seconded by an old and respected Member of the Opposition. The\r\nGovernment take no part in the ceremony so far, in accordance with\r\nan old-established tradition that the election or re-election of a\r\nSpeaker is the independent and unfettered action of the House. The\r\nmotion is not put to the House in the customary manner. The Clerk\r\ndoes not say, “The question is that James William Lowther do take the\r\nChair of this House as Speaker.” The Speaker-designate rises in his\r\nplace on one of the back benches and humbly submits himself to the\r\nwill of the House. The Commons express their unanimous approval of\r\nthe motion by cheers without question put. Thus the Speaker-Elect is\r\nliterally “called” to the Chair by the House.\r\n\r\nIn one respect only has time altered the symbolic details of the\r\nceremony. In the long, long ago it was the custom for the Member\r\nchosen for the Chair humbly to protest that of all the House he was\r\nthe least suited for the exalted position. An amusing instance of\r\nthis modest declaration of unfitness comes down to us from the days\r\nof Queen Elizabeth. The House of Commons having met for the choice\r\nof a Speaker, Mr. Serjeant Yelverton was proposed by Sir William\r\nKnowles. “I know him,” said Knowles, “to be a man wise and learned,\r\nsecret and circumspect, religious and faithful, every way able to\r\nfill the place.” “Aye, aye, aye,” cried the whole House; “let him be\r\nSpeaker.” Then rose the modest, blushing Yelverton. He said he was at\r\na loss to account for his selection for the Chair, lacking as he did\r\nevery quality that was necessary in a Speaker. He had no merit and no\r\nability. He was moreover a poor man with a large family. Nor was he\r\nof a sufficiently imposing presence. The Speaker ought to be a big\r\nman, stately and comely, well-spoken, his voice great, his carriage\r\nmajestical, his nature haughty, and his purse plentiful and heavy.\r\nBut, contrarily, he was of a small body, he spoke indifferently, his\r\nvoice was low, his carriage of the commonest fashion, his nature soft\r\nand yielding, and his purse light. He adjured the House to consider\r\nwell before it made the grievous mistake of appointing to the Chair\r\na man so totally unfitted for the post. But the House, mightily\r\nimpressed by these humble expostulations, so becoming in a candidate\r\nfor the Speakership, persisted in unanimously electing Mr. Serjeant\r\nYelverton; as, indeed, Mr. Serjeant Yelverton, despite all his\r\nprotestations of unworthiness, well and gladly knew they would do.\r\n\r\nIt is not so long since another amusing piece of comedy used to be\r\nenacted on this otherwise serious and solemn occasion. The proposer\r\nand seconder of the Speaker-designate were required in the prescribed\r\nparliamentary phrase to “take him out of his place” and conduct\r\nhim to the Chair; while he was obliged to wriggle his shoulders as\r\nif he were struggling to free himself from their hands and escape\r\nfrom the House. Surely they were not serious—he meant to convey—in\r\nconferring upon one so lowly and unworthy an office so dignified\r\nand exalted? This display of mock modesty is now a thing of the\r\npast. The only part of it that survives is that the proposer and\r\nseconder approach the Speaker-designate, and when they are within\r\na few paces of him, the Speaker-designate rises and walks to the\r\nChair, his sponsors following close behind. The Speaker-designate\r\ndoes not, however, immediately go into the Chair. Standing on the\r\ndais, he again thanks the House for the high honour conferred on him,\r\nand then takes his seat as “Speaker-Elect,” as he is called at this\r\nstage of his evolution. The glittering Mace, which all the time lay\r\nhidden under the Table, is now placed by the Serjeant-at-Arms in its\r\nusual position within sight of all eyes to indicate that the House\r\nis sitting. Then follow congratulations generally offered by the\r\nLeader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition, after which the\r\nHouse adjourns. The first day’s ceremony of the opening of the new\r\nParliament is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nBut although the Commons have chosen one of their number “to take\r\nthe Chair of this House as Speaker,” the Constitution requires that\r\nbefore he can enter upon the duties of his office he must submit\r\nhimself in the House of Lords for the Sovereign’s ratification of\r\nhis election. Until the approval of the Crown has been signified\r\nhe continues to be styled “Mr. Speaker-Elect.” Next day sees the\r\ncompletion of the ceremony of Mr. Speaker’s election. He enters the\r\nChamber, by way of the lobby, heralded by the ushers who preceded\r\nhim, crying “Way for the Speaker-Elect” with an emphasis on “elect,”\r\nand attended by the Serjeant-at-Arms. It is also evident from the\r\ndress of the choice of the Commons, that his evolution as Mr. Speaker\r\nis not yet complete. He is still, as it were, in the chrysalis or\r\ntransition state. He is seen to be only half-made up, wearing, it is\r\ntrue, the customary Court dress—cutaway coat, knee-breeches, silk\r\nstockings, and shoes—but not the customary full-flowing silk gown,\r\nand with only a small bob-wig—that is, the short wig of counsel when\r\npractising in courts of law—instead of the customary full-bottomed\r\nwig with wings, which fall over his shoulders. Further, it is\r\nnoticeable that the Serjeant-at-Arms does not carry the Mace on his\r\nshoulder—as he usually does—but holds it reclining in the hollow of\r\nhis left arm, his right hand grasping its end.\r\n\r\nThe Lords assemble on the second day of the new Parliament at the\r\nsame hour as the Commons, and once more is “Black Rod” despatched\r\nto invite the attendance of Members of the Lower House to the House\r\nof Peers, to hear the Royal will in regard to the election of\r\nthe Speaker. On arriving at the Upper Chamber, the Speaker-Elect\r\nstands at the centre of the Bar, with “Black Rod” to his right, the\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms (who has left the Mace outside) to his left, and\r\nhis proposer and seconder immediately behind in the forefront of the\r\ncrowd of Commons who have followed him across the lobbies. He bows\r\nto the Lords Commissioners, who, in all the glory of scarlet robes\r\nand cocked hats, are again seated on the form in front of the Throne,\r\nand they who yesterday encountered the Commons without lifting a\r\nhat, now acknowledge the salutation of the Speaker-Elect by thrice\r\nrespectfully bending their uncovered heads. Then the Speaker-Elect\r\naddresses them as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have to acquaint your Lordships that, in obedience to his Royal\r\n  commands, his Majesty’s faithful Commons have, in the exercise of\r\n  their undoubted right and privilege, proceeded to the choice of\r\n  a Speaker. Their choice has fallen upon myself, and I therefore\r\n  present myself at your Lordship’s Bar humbly submitting myself for\r\n  his Majesty’s gracious approbation.\r\n\r\nTo this the Lord Chancellor, addressing the Speaker-Elect by name,\r\nreplies:\r\n\r\n  We are commanded to assure you that his Majesty is so fully\r\n  sensible of your zeal for the public service, and your undoubted\r\n  efficiency to execute all the arduous duties of the position which\r\n  his faithful Commons have selected you to discharge, that he does\r\n  most readily approve and confirm your election as Speaker.\r\n\r\nHis election having thus been ratified by the Sovereign, Mr. Speaker\r\n“submits himself in all humility to his Majesty’s royal will and\r\npleasure”; and if, says he, in the discharge of his duties, and\r\nin maintaining the rights and privileges of the Commons’ House of\r\nParliament, he should fall inadvertently into error, he “entreats\r\nthat the blame may be imputed to him alone, and not to his Majesty’s\r\nfaithful Commons.” Assertions of the rights and privileges of the\r\nHouse of Commons follow fast on expressions of loyalty to the\r\nThrone during the ten minutes that the Speaker, surrounded by “the\r\nfaithful Commons,” stands at the Bar of the House of Lords, and\r\nholds this significant historical colloquy—which has been repeated\r\nat every election of Speaker on the assembling of a new Parliament\r\nfor many centuries—with the Lord Chancellor, not as the President\r\nof the House of Lords, but as the representative of the Sovereign;\r\nfor the next duty of the Speaker is to request from the Sovereign\r\nrecognition of all the ancient rights and privileges of Members of\r\nParliament, which are “readily granted” by the Sovereign, speaking\r\nthrough the Lord Chancellor. This ends the ceremonial. The Speaker\r\nand the Commons return to their Chamber as they came. But, see, the\r\nMace is now borne high on the shoulder of the Serjeant-at-Arms, and\r\nhear the usher announcing “Mr. Speaker” and “Way for Mr. Speaker.”\r\nThe Speaker passes through the Chamber to his rooms, and in a few\r\nminutes comes back arrayed in the complete robes of his office. Then,\r\nstanding on the dais of the Chair, he reports what took place in\r\nthe House of Lords. It is one of the curious customs of Parliament\r\nthat the Speaker always assumes that he has been to the House of\r\nLords alone, and that the Commons are in absolute ignorance of what\r\nhas happened there. Without the slightest tremor of emotion, or the\r\nfaintest indication of satisfaction, the Commoners learn that their\r\n“ancient rights and undoubted privileges” have been fully confirmed,\r\nparticularly freedom from arrest and molestation, liberty of speech\r\nin their debates, and free access to the Sovereign. They know full\r\nwell that if they do anything criminal they may feel the dread touch\r\nof the policeman on their shoulders—freedom from arrest for debt was\r\nabolished long ago—and they know also that even if they would they\r\ncould not disturb the domestic privacy of the King. So the solemn\r\nannouncement evokes not a solitary cheer. But there is loud applause\r\nupon the Speaker thus finally concluding: “I have now again to make\r\nmy grateful acknowledgments to the House for the honour done to me\r\nin placing me again in the Chair, and to assure it of my complete\r\ndevotion to its service.” The ancient and picturesque ceremony of the\r\nelection of Speaker of the House of Commons is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nAt the assembling of every new Parliament the Members for the City\r\nof London, in accordance with an ancient custom, have the privilege\r\nof sitting on the Treasury Bench with the Ministers, though for the\r\nopening day only. I have frequently read in the newspapers that this\r\nprivilege was given to the City of London by way of commemorating the\r\nprotection afforded to the Five Members on that historic day, January\r\n4, 1642, when Charles I came down to the House of Commons to arrest\r\nthem for their opposition to his will, and found to his discomfiture\r\nthat “the birds had flown,” to use his own words. The statement\r\nis not well established. It is a singular thing that no written\r\nrecord of the origin or existence of the custom is to be found at\r\nthe Guildhall any more than at the House of Commons. But there is\r\nauthority for saying that the right was exercised in the time of\r\nElizabeth, and over seventy years before the conflict between Charles\r\nI and the Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe earliest reference to it is contained in a Report on the\r\nProcedure of the English Parliament prepared in 1568 at the request\r\nof the then Speaker of the Irish Parliament by Hooker, a well-known\r\nantiquarian of the time, who was a Member both of the English and\r\nIrish Parliaments. This report was printed and presented to the Irish\r\nParliament, and was reprinted in London about 1575 under the title\r\nof “The Order and Usuage of the Keeping of a Parliament in England.”\r\nIt is set out fully in Lord Mountmorres’s _History of the Principal\r\nTransactions in the Irish Parliament from 1634 to 1666_, published\r\nin 1792. Hooker, describing the seating of Members in the House of\r\nCommons, says:\r\n\r\n  Upon the lower row on both sides the Speaker, sit such personages\r\n  as be of the King’s Privy Counsel, or of his Chief Officers; but as\r\n  for any other, none claimeth, or can claim, any place, but sitteth\r\n  as he cometh, saving that on the right hand of the Speaker next\r\n  beneath the said Counsels, the Londoners and the citizens of York\r\n  do sit, and so in order should sit all the citizens accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the representatives of York as well as those\r\nof London sat, according to Hooker, on the Front Bench to the right\r\nof the Speaker. Probably the privilege was conferred upon London\r\nand York as being the first and second cities of the Kingdom. But\r\nit seems clear that the privilege was not at first confined merely\r\nto the opening day of a new Parliament, but was exercised at every\r\nsitting of the House of Commons. The only other authoritative\r\nstatement on this subject which I have found is in Oldfield’s\r\n_Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland_, published in\r\n1816. The passage is as follows: “It (York City) sends two Members to\r\nParliament, who are chosen by the freemen in general, and who enjoy\r\nthe privilege of sitting in their scarlet gowns next the Members\r\nfor London on the Privy Councillors’ bench on the first day of the\r\nmeeting of every new Parliament.” In 1910, the then representatives\r\nof York, A. Rowntree and John Butcher, with a view to asserting this\r\nprivilege in the same manner as it is asserted by the representatives\r\nof the City of London, laid the facts before Mr. Speaker Lowther.\r\nAfter a full consideration of the matter he gave it as his opinion\r\nthat, assuming the right to have once existed, it must be considered,\r\nin the absence of any evidence of having been used in modern times,\r\nto have lapsed, and could not now be properly claimed or exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day that the new Parliament meets for\r\nbusiness—the day on which the King’s Speech is read—the corridors,\r\nvaults and cellars of the Palace of Westminster are searched to see\r\nthat all is well with the building and safe for the King, Lords and\r\nCommons to assemble within it—a ceremony (for it is now only that)\r\nwhich is repeated on the opening day of every session. It recalls the\r\nGunpowder Plot of Guy Fawkes to blow up the Parliament in 1605.\r\n\r\nThe Commons possess but one memento of Guy, that most notorious of\r\nall anti-parliamentarians. In a glass case in the Members’ Library\r\nmay be seen a long, narrow key with a hinge in the centre for\r\nfolding it up—so that it might be carried more conveniently in the\r\npocket—which was found on Fawkes when he was captured. It was the key\r\nto the cellar of gunpowder extending under the House of Lords, though\r\nit was really part of an adjoining empty house which the conspirators\r\nhad taken for their purpose. The custom of searching the Houses of\r\nParliament is popularly supposed to date from the Gunpowder Plot,\r\nbut it did not commence until eighty-five years later. According to\r\na document preserved in the House of Lords, an anonymous warning\r\nreceived in 1690 by the Marquess of Carmarthen, setting forth, “There\r\nis great cause to judge that there is a second Gunpowder Plot, or\r\nsome other such great mischief, designing against the King and\r\nParliament by a frequent and great resort of notorious ill-willers at\r\nmost private hours to the house of one Hutchinson in the Old Palace\r\nYard, Westminster, situate very dangerous for such purpose,” led\r\nto a thorough examination of the buildings, and though nothing was\r\nthen found, from that time to this the search appears to have been\r\nregularly made year after year.\r\n\r\nThe search party consists of twelve Yeomen of the Guard from\r\nthe Tower in all the picturesque glory of their Tudor uniforms,\r\naccompanied by representatives of the Lord Great Chamberlain and the\r\nOffice of Works, and the two police inspectors of the Houses of Lords\r\nand Commons. They tramp through the miles of corridors and lobbies,\r\nlooking carefully into every nook and corner, and down in the\r\nequally extensive basements they examine everything with the utmost\r\nminuteness, going among gas pipes, steam pipes, hot-water pipes,\r\nelectric-light conductors, to make sure that no explosives have\r\nbeen deposited there. When the search was first ordered, years and\r\nyears ago, the Yeomen of the Guard were directed to carry lanterns\r\nto light their way through the dark passages. The corridors and\r\ncellars are now flooded with electric light. But the search party,\r\nstill obeying the old order, march along swinging their lanterns. And\r\nstill the solemn function ends up with service of cake and wine to\r\nthe old Beefeaters, and the drinking of long life to the King, with\r\na hip-hip hurrah! Only in one respect is there a departure from the\r\nold procedure. At one time it was customary, when the inspection was\r\nover, for the Lord Great Chamberlain to send a mounted soldier with\r\nthe message “All’s well” to the Sovereign. The mounted soldier no\r\nlonger rides post-haste to the King at Buckingham Palace; but every\r\nyear the Vice-Chamberlain lets his Majesty know, by private wire,\r\nthat everything is ready for his coming to meet the Lords and Commons\r\nin the House of Lords to announce from the Throne the business for\r\nwhich he has summoned Parliament to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTAKING THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nLet us linger awhile in the Upper Chamber to note what happens when,\r\non the second day of the opening of a new Parliament, the Commons\r\nreturn to their own House, having at their head no longer a mere\r\n“Speaker-Elect,” but a fully-fledged “Mr. Speaker,” who has been\r\ncompletely evolved from the chrysalis state by the magic influence\r\nof the Royal approbation. As the noise of the retreating feet of the\r\nexultant Commons irreverently breaks for a minute or so the solemn\r\nstillness of the House of Lords, the five Lords Commissioners rise\r\nfrom their bench, and with slow, toilsome footsteps, as if the weight\r\nof their ample scarlet robes trailing on the ground behind them\r\nimpede their progress, disappear behind the Throne. After a brief\r\ninterval the Lord Chancellor reappears, attired in his customary\r\nrobes—which, like the Speaker’s, consist of a full-bottomed wig and\r\na flowing black gown worn over levee dress—and takes his seat on the\r\nWoolsack. The junior bishop among the Lords Spiritual present reads\r\nthe prayers, while the peers stand with bowed and reverent heads.\r\nThen the process of swearing-in begins. The Lord Chancellor is the\r\nfirst to come to the table; and, with a copy of the New Testament\r\nin his right hand, and a large paste-board card containing the\r\nwords of the oath, in his left, he repeats, after the Clerk of the\r\nParliaments, the declaration that he will be faithful and bear true\r\nallegiance to his Majesty; after which he kisses the book, and writes\r\nhis name on the Roll of Parliament. It is the first signature on the\r\nvirgin sheet. The roll is of a different kind in each House. In the\r\nUpper Chamber it is really a roll. It consists of one long sheet of\r\npaper, about 16 inches in width, which winds round a roller. The\r\npeers simply write their ordinary signatures, such as “Birkenhead,”\r\n“Morley,” “Rosebery,” “Salisbury,” or “Lansdowne.”\r\n\r\nAs the Lord Chancellor returns to the Woolsack, Garter King of\r\nArms (the head of The Heralds’ College), appears, in his gorgeous\r\ntabard, emblazoned back and front with the Royal Arms and many quaint\r\ndevices, and delivers to the Clerk the Roll of the Lords. The Clerk\r\nof the Crown in Chancery, wearing wig and gown, also enters and\r\npresents a certificate of the return of the sixteen representative\r\nScottish peers, who are elected for every new Parliament by the\r\npeerage of Scotland. Then the peers come to the table without any\r\norder or precedence being observed, and each, having first handed\r\nover his writ of summons, a small piece of limp parchment, to the\r\nClerk, takes the oath, and subscribes the Roll.\r\n\r\n“Once a peer, a peer for life,” it is said, truly enough, and yet\r\nevery Lord of Parliament must receive, at the dissolution, a fresh\r\nsummons from the Crown, and must take a fresh oath of allegiance,\r\nbefore he can resume his legislative duties in the new Parliament.\r\nThe writs are issued from the Crown Office at Westminster to “the\r\nLords spiritual and temporal” individually. The mediæval quaintness\r\nof the summons—it has been in use for over six centuries—is shown in\r\nits principal passage:\r\n\r\n  We strictly enjoining, command you upon the faith and allegiance by\r\n  which you are bound to Us, that the weightiness of the said affairs\r\n  and imminent perils considered (waiving all excuses), you be at the\r\n  said day and place personally present with Us, and with the said\r\n  Prelates, Great Men, and Peers, to treat and give your council upon\r\n  the affairs aforesaid. And this, as you regard Us and Our honour\r\n  and the safety and defence of the said United Kingdom and Church\r\n  and dispatch of the said affairs, in no wise do you omit.\r\n\r\nThe writ sent to the spiritual peers is the same, save that they are\r\ncommanded to attend upon their “faith and love” instead of their\r\n“faith and allegiance,” as in the case of the peers temporal. The\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury and York, and the Bishops of London, Durham\r\nand Winchester, become Lords of Parliament immediately on their\r\nconsecration, but the other prelates of the Church Establishment\r\nmust await, in the order of seniority of consecration, writs of\r\nsummons to the House of Lords, according as vacancies arise by death\r\nor resignation in the estate of the Lords spiritual. The number of\r\nspiritual peers is limited to twenty-six, and as there are thirty-six\r\ndioceses in the Established Church, ten of the prelates are therefore\r\nnot Lords of Parliament, but all of them—save the Bishop of Sodor\r\nand Man—may hope, in time, to have seats in the House of Lords\r\nby succession. It is an interesting fact that the making of an\r\naffirmation instead of taking the oath—a not infrequent occurrence\r\nin the Commons—is rarely to be seen in the Lords. The only time I\r\nhave witnessed it was when Viscount Morley of Blackburn (better known\r\nin literature and politics as John Morley) came to the table on his\r\nfirst introduction to the House of Lords in May 1908, and the Clerk\r\nproduced, in the usual course, the New Testament and the copy of\r\nthe oath. Lord Morley refused to be sworn, and insisted on making\r\naffirmation instead. As there was no precedent for such a demand in\r\nthe House of Lords, no form of affirmation was available; but after a\r\nhurried consultation between the Lord Chancellor and the Clerk, the\r\nterms of the oath, with the appeal to the Almighty, “So help me, God”\r\nomitted, were made to serve the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons the procedure of swearing-in members is\r\nsomewhat different. The Speaker is the first to take the oath. As\r\nsoon as he returns to the Chair, in the full garb of his office,\r\nhe stands on the dais, and repeats the words of the oath after the\r\nClerk. It is a very simple declaration, and is the same in both\r\nHouses:\r\n\r\n  I, —— ——, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and\r\n  bear true allegiance to his Majesty King George, his heirs and\r\n  successors, according to law. So help me, God.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker then signs the Test Roll, which, differing in form from\r\nthe Roll of Parliament in the Upper House, is a large book strongly\r\nbound in leather, with brass clasps, opening at the bottom instead of\r\nat the sides, and with a sheet of blotting-paper between every two\r\nleaves. A new Test Roll is provided for each new Parliament.\r\n\r\nAfter the Speaker, Members are sworn in in batches. To expedite\r\nmatters, two tables are brought into the Chamber, and, being placed\r\nin line with the Clerk’s Table, are each supplied with copies of\r\nthe New Testament and five large paste-boards, on which the oath\r\nis printed in bold type. At each table one of the clerks-assistant\r\nstands, and administers the oath to the Members, as they present\r\nthemselves in groups of five, two or three holding between them a\r\nTestament, and each having in his left hand one of the oath-cards,\r\nthe words of which they repeat, and then kiss the book. The first to\r\ntake the oath and sign the roll after the Speaker are the Leader of\r\nthe House and the Leader of the Opposition. Members of “his Majesty’s\r\nmost honourable Privy Council,” and the Ministers, past and present,\r\nnext have precedence, and take the oath separately from the other\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\nIn the Lords, as we have seen, each peer, before taking the oath and\r\nsubscribing the Roll, gives the Clerk his writ of summons. But in the\r\nCommons no proof of identity—no evidence that they are duly elected\r\nM.P.’s—is required from the gentlemen that present themselves at\r\nthe Table to take the oath and subscribe the Test Roll. It is true\r\nthat the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery receives at his office at\r\nWestminster from the returning officer of every constituency what is\r\ncalled the return of the writ—that is, actually the writ of election,\r\nwith the name of the elected representative certified on the back—and\r\nthat the names of the Members, with the constituency each represents,\r\nare inscribed in a book, called the “Return Book,” which is delivered\r\nby the Clerk of the Crown to the Clerk of the House of Commons on the\r\nday the new Parliament opens.\r\n\r\nBut though ordinarily all the approaches to the Chamber are guarded\r\nby vigilant policemen and door-keepers, who know every Member of\r\nthe House, it is obviously impossible at the opening of a new\r\nParliament—when there is a large influx of new Members—for the\r\nofficials on duty to be able to discriminate between those who say\r\nthey are representatives and those who may be strangers. It would\r\nnot be difficult, therefore, for an impostor of nerve and audacity,\r\nwith some knowledge of the House and its ways, to enter the House\r\nby personating some Member whom he knew could not be in attendance,\r\nto vote in a division on the Speakership, should there be a contest\r\nfor the Chair, and even to take the oath and subscribe the Roll.\r\nThere is no case of personation on record, but it is possible in the\r\ncircumstances. The Return Book is a conspicuous object on the Table\r\nduring the swearing-in of Members. It is there for reference by the\r\nClerk, in the event of a question arising as to the identity of any\r\nperson who may present himself. However, as it contains merely the\r\nname of each Member and his constituency, and not his portrait and\r\ndescription, it is hardly an insuperable bar to personation, and\r\naccordingly, in the case of new Members, the question of identity\r\nhas to be taken on trust by the Clerk. But there is no doubt that a\r\nMember who for any reason did not want to take the oath could quite\r\neasily evade the obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIn the case of a contested election for the Speakership, Members\r\nwould of course have to vote without having been sworn. What, it may\r\nbe asked, would happen in the event of a Member, after the election\r\nof the Speaker, sitting and voting without having taken the oath and\r\nsigned the Roll? The penalties provided by an Act passed in 1866 are\r\na fine of £500 for each commission of the offence of voting, and\r\nthe immediate deprivation of the seat, which, _ipso facto_, becomes\r\nvacant. The payment of the fines, when the offence has been committed\r\nthrough mistake, ignorance, or inadvertence, can be remitted by an\r\nAct of Indemnity, but it is contended that nothing can avoid the\r\ninstant vacating of the seat. I remember hearing it persistently\r\nwhispered that one Member elected at a certain General Election\r\nhad never taken the oath or signed the Roll. The matter, however,\r\nwas never brought to the notice of the House. A peer who takes his\r\nseat and votes without having previously subscribed to the oath\r\nis likewise liable for every such vote to a penalty of £500. Peers\r\nhave so inadvertently violated the law. Each explained that having\r\ntaken the oath and signed the Roll on his accession to the peerage\r\nhe thought he was not obliged to do so again when a new Parliament\r\nassembled. This excuse was accepted in the case of four peers in\r\n1906. Bills of Indemnity were then said to be no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nThe swearing-in of Members returned to the House of Commons at the\r\nGeneral Election of 1918—the first after the World War—had one new\r\nfeature. It was introduced owing to changes in the law of election\r\nmade by the Reform Act of 1918. It is provided by that Act that\r\na candidate must lodge £150 with the returning officer at his\r\nnomination, which sum is not given back until the returning officer\r\nis officially informed that the candidate, if elected, has taken the\r\noath and signed the Roll. Accordingly, to provide a means of ready\r\ndiscovery as to whether a particular Member had or had not subscribed\r\nto the oath, two clerks sat at the Table, with printed lists of the\r\nnames and constituencies, which they ticked off as the name and the\r\nconstituency of each Member was announced by the Clerk of the House\r\nin the course of the introduction of the Member to the Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nAs Members take the oath, they proceed, in single file, to subscribe\r\nthe Test Roll, over which the Clerk stands sentinel. Each Member\r\nwrites his full name and that of his constituency. He is then\r\nintroduced by the Clerk to the Speaker, who shakes hands with him.\r\nSo the process of swearing-in goes on for two or three days. It is\r\nslow and tedious work, and the House is not a lively place while it\r\nis in progress. Occasionally a special incident relieves the tedium\r\nof the proceedings. Some Members claim to make an affirmation instead\r\nof being sworn, on the ground that he has no religious belief, or\r\nthat the taking of an oath is contrary to his religious belief. The\r\naffirmation is in the same form as the oath, except that the words\r\n“Solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm” are substituted\r\nfor the word “swear,” and the words, “So help me, God” are omitted.\r\nThese have to sign their names on a different part of the Test Roll.\r\nIt is no unusual thing either to see a Member, wearing his hat, sworn\r\non a book provided by himself. He belongs to the Jewish persuasion,\r\nwhich requires the oath to be taken with covered head on a copy of\r\nthe Pentateuch, or first five books of the Old Testament. Others\r\nprefer to swear with uplifted hand instead of by kissing the New\r\nTestament. The oath is administered in about a minute to each batch.\r\nIt is in signing the Test Roll that time is consumed. The Member who\r\nhas not his glasses adjusted, or who searches on the Table for the\r\npen that suits him best, with which to inscribe his name on the roll\r\nof fame in bold and lasting caligraphy, may block a group anxious\r\nto get to the lunch-rooms or smoking-rooms, and may prove the same\r\nkind of nuisance to his fellows as the man who wants to change a\r\nfive-pound note at the railway booking-office, though there is a\r\nlong and impatient queue behind, and the train is on the point of\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nAs “Mr. Speaker” does not speak in the debates, the title of\r\nthe President of the House of Commons appears, at first sight,\r\nparadoxical. The original function of the office was to sum up, like\r\nthe Judge at a trial, the arguments of both sides at the close of\r\na debate. “If any doubt arise upon a Bill,” says an Order passed\r\nin 1604, “the Speaker to explain, but not to sway the House with\r\nargument or dispute.” Mr. Speaker had also to “speak” the views of\r\nthe House in its contentions with the Crown, about supplies and\r\ntaxes, before the Revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Speaker to-day are not so anxious or troublesome.\r\nThe occasions on which he conveys the views or desires of the Commons\r\nto the Sovereign, or his representatives, the Lords Commissioners\r\nin the House of Lords, are rare, and always formal or ceremonious.\r\nHe has been relieved long since of the invidious task of summing\r\nup a debate in which the contending parties had argued out their\r\ndifferences. His duties are now more appropriate to his office, as\r\ncontroller and guide of a deliberative Assembly. He keeps the talk\r\nstrictly to the subject of discussion. He decides points of order.\r\nHe interprets the rules of the House. He is ever ready to assist\r\nMembers in doubt or difficulty about a question, a motion or a Bill.\r\nHe guards with jealous care the authority, honour and dignity of\r\nthe House. He is most concerned with the maintenance of its great\r\ntraditions of good order, decorum, and freedom of opinion.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Mr. Speaker must be scrupulously fair, absolutely just,\r\nin rulings which may affect any of the political sections of the\r\nAssembly. For the most precious attribute of the Chair of the\r\nHouse of Commons is impartiality. The Speaker, like the King, is\r\nsupposed to have no politics. That has become almost a recognized\r\nconstitutional principle. Of course, he is returned to the House\r\noriginally as a supporter of one or other of the political parties.\r\nIt follows also that on his first appointment to the Chair he is\r\nnecessarily the choice, or the nominee, of the political Party\r\nwhich at the time is supreme. The Chair of the House of Commons,\r\nwhen vacated by resignation or death, has always been considered\r\nthe legitimate prize of the Party then in office or in power.\r\nAccordingly the Speaker has invariably been chosen from the ranks of\r\nthe Ministerialists. All the Speakers of the nineteenth century—Sir\r\nHenry Addington, Sir John Freeman-Mitford, Charles Abbot, Charles\r\nManners-Sutton, James Abercromby, Charles Shaw-Lefevre, John Evelyn\r\nDenison, Henry Bouverie Brand, Arthur Wellesley Peel and William\r\nCourt Gully—were so chosen and appointed, and so was James William\r\nLowther, the first Speaker elected in the twentieth century. But\r\nwhether the Speaker is first designated by the Government, or, in\r\ncase of a division, is carried by the majority of the Government,\r\nwhen he is being conducted by his proposer and seconder from his\r\nplace on the benches to the Chair, he, as it were, doffs his Party\r\ncolours, be they buff or blue, and wears, instead, the white flower\r\nof a neutral political life; and, once in the Chair, he is regarded\r\nas the choice of the whole House, from which his authority is\r\nderived and of which, to use the ancient phrase, he is “the mouth.”\r\nHenceforth he sits above all Parties. As Speaker he has no political\r\nopinions. So he remains Speaker—being re-elected unanimously at the\r\nfirst meeting of each new Parliament—until he decides to resign or is\r\nremoved by death. This concurrence of both sides in the appointment\r\nof Mr. Speaker adds immensely to his judicial independence in\r\npresiding over the Party conflicts which are waged on the floor of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOnce only has a Speaker been dismissed on the assembling of a new\r\nParliament because he was supposed to be hostile to the Party\r\nwhich came back from the country in a majority. This was Charles\r\nManners-Sutton. A Tory himself, he was the nominee of the Tory\r\nAdministration in office at the resignation of Charles Abbot in 1817.\r\nThe moderate Conservatives and Whigs put forward Charles William\r\nWynn. His brother, Sir Watkin Wynn, who was also in the House, and\r\nhe were known as “Bubble and Squeak,” on account of the peculiarity\r\nof their voices. Indeed, Canning thought the only objection to Wynn\r\nas a candidate for the Chair was that Members might be tempted to\r\naddress him as “Mr. Squeaker.” However, Manners-Sutton was elected\r\nby the large majority of 160; and in accordance with precedent he\r\nwas reappointed to the position after General Elections in 1819,\r\n1820, 1826, 1830 and 1831. In July 1832, during the struggle over\r\nthe great Reform Bill, he intimated his wish to retire at the close\r\nof the Parliament. A vote of thanks for his services was unanimously\r\npassed, on the motion of Lord Althorp, the Whig Leader of the House,\r\nan annuity of £4,000 was granted to him, and one of £3,000, after\r\nhis death, to his heir male. But the Whig Ministers, returned again\r\nto power at the General Election which followed the passing of the\r\nReform Act, were apprehensive that a new and inexperienced Speaker\r\nwould be unable to control the first reformed Parliament in which, it\r\nwas feared, there might be discordant and unruly elements, and they\r\ninduced Manners-Sutton to consent to occupy the Chair for some time\r\nlonger. The Radicals, however, decided to oppose his re-election.\r\nAccordingly, at the meeting of the new Parliament on January 29,\r\n1833, after Manners-Sutton had been proposed by Lord Morpeth and\r\nseconded by Sir Francis Burdett, both Whigs, Edward John Littleton\r\nwas put up in opposition to him by Joseph Hume and Daniel O’Connell.\r\nA division was taken, and Littleton was rejected by 241 votes to 31,\r\nor the enormous majority of 210. Thereupon Charles Manners-Sutton was\r\ndeclared elected Speaker unanimously.\r\n\r\nWhen a new Parliament next assembled, on February 19, 1835, the\r\nTories were in office, the Whigs having been summarily dismissed\r\nby William IV; but, as the result of the General Election which\r\nfollowed, a majority of Whigs confronted Sir Robert Peel, Prime\r\nMinister, in the House of Commons, determined to fight him on every\r\nissue. Charles Manners-Sutton was again nominated for the Chair,\r\nthis time his proposer and seconder being Tories. That he was a\r\nstaunch Tory everybody was well aware. But he was charged with overt\r\nacts of partisanship, in breach of the principle that as Speaker\r\nhe was bound to be absolutely impartial. It was said that he had\r\nbeen concerned in the Tory opposition to the reform of Parliament,\r\nand had, in fact, tried to constitute an anti-Reform Administration\r\nhimself. It was further said that he had helped in the overthrow of\r\nthe late Whig Government, and that, had the Tories been successful\r\nat the polls, he would have been appointed to high office in Peel’s\r\nCabinet. Though he denied these charges, the Whigs as a Party opposed\r\nhis re-election to the Chair; and their nominee, James Abercromby,\r\nwas carried in a most exciting contest by the narrow majority of\r\n10, or by 316 votes to 306. “Such a division was never known before\r\nin the House of Commons,” writes Charles Greville in his _Memoirs_.\r\n“Much money was won and lost. Everybody betted. I won £55.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, speaking in the 1835 debate, said the House of\r\nCommons was under no obligation in a new Parliament to re-elect the\r\nSpeaker, unless he had won for himself the confidence and esteem not\r\nof his own Party alone, but of the general body of Members. Even so,\r\nno attempt has since been made to depose a Speaker on Party grounds,\r\neven when a General Election has upset the balance of Parties in the\r\nHouse of Commons. On the retirement of Abercromby in May 1839, the\r\nWhigs, being still in office, nominated Charles Shaw-Lefevre; the\r\nTories ran Henry Goulburn, and the former was elected by a majority\r\nof 18, or by 317 votes against 299. The General Election of 1841\r\nresulted in a change of Government. The Melbourne Administration,\r\nwhich elected Shaw-Lefevre to the Chair, was overthrown at the\r\npolls, and the Tories came back with a large majority. Many of\r\nthe victors in the electoral contest were disposed to follow the\r\nexample set by their opponents in 1835, and make a Party question\r\nof the Speakership of the new Parliament. But their leader and\r\nPrime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, refused to countenance this line\r\nof action. “I do not think it necessary,” said he, in a speech\r\nsupporting the re-election of Shaw-Lefevre in August 1841, “that\r\nthe person elected to the Chair, who has ably and conscientiously\r\nperformed his duty, should be displaced because his political\r\nopinions are not consonant with those of the majority of the House.”\r\nThe re-election of Shaw-Lefevre was, accordingly, unanimous. Peel’s\r\nwise view of the Speakership has since prevailed. The continuity of\r\nthe office has not been broken since the dismissal of Manners-Sutton\r\nin 1835. John Evelyn Denison was unanimously chosen to succeed\r\nShaw-Lefevre in 1857, Henry Bouverie Brand to succeed Denison in\r\n1872, and Arthur Wellesley Peel to succeed Brand in 1884. The Whigs,\r\nor Liberals, were in office on each occasion that the Speakership\r\nbecame vacant by resignation in those years. And the Conservatives,\r\non their return to power, reappointed Denison in 1866, Brand in 1874,\r\nand Peel in 1886.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the election of William Court Gully\r\nas Speaker gave both to the principle that the Chair is above\r\nthe strife and the prejudices of Party, and the precedent of its\r\noccupant’s continuity of office, an accession of strength which\r\nperhaps makes them stable and decisive for all time. Gully had sat\r\nin the House as a Liberal for ten years when, on the retirement of\r\nPeel in May 1895, he was nominated for the Chair by the Liberal\r\nGovernment. The Unionist Opposition proposed Sir Matthew White\r\nRidley, a highly respected member of their Party, and a man of long\r\nand varied experience in parliamentary affairs. On a division Gully\r\nwas elected by the narrow majority of 11. The voting was: Gully,\r\n285; White Ridley, 274. It was publicly declared at the time that,\r\nas the Unionists had disapproved the candidature of Gully, they held\r\nthemselves free to put a nominee of their own in the Chair should\r\nthey have a majority in the next new Parliament. A few weeks later\r\nthe Liberal Government was defeated in the House of Commons, and\r\na dissolution followed. It is the custom to allow the Speaker a\r\nwalk-over in his constituency at the General Election. But Gully’s\r\nseat at Carlisle was on this occasion contested, and his Unionist\r\nopponent received from Arthur Balfour, then Leader of the Unionist\r\nParty, a letter warmly endorsing his candidature and wishing him\r\nsuccess. In his address to the constituents Gully made no reference\r\nto politics. As Speaker of the House of Commons, he could have\r\nnothing to say to Party controversy. Like his predecessors, he\r\nrecognized that a Speaker cannot descend into the rough strife of\r\nthe electoral battle, not even to canvass the electors, without\r\nimpairing the independence and the dignity of the Chair of the House\r\nof Commons. The contest ended in his re-election by a substantial\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThe Unionists came back triumphant from the country. There was still\r\na feeling in the Party, though not, indeed, prevailing to any wide\r\nextent, that the Speaker of the new Parliament should be chosen from\r\nits ranks. It was pointed out that for sixty years there had not\r\nbeen a Conservative Speaker—Manners-Sutton having been the last—and,\r\napart altogether from the legitimate ambition of the Conservatives\r\nto have a Speaker of their own way of thinking, it was argued that\r\nin building up the body of precedents which guide, if they do not\r\ncontrol, the duties of the Chair, Conservative opinion ought to have\r\nits proper share, if these precedents are truly to reflect the sense\r\nof the House generally. But tradition and practice in the House of\r\nCommons were too powerful to be overborne. At the meeting of the\r\nnew Parliament, in August 1895, Gully was unanimously re-elected to\r\nthe Chair. The aloofness and supremacy of the Speakership has one\r\nfine effect. It gives to the House, despite its Party divisions, an\r\nennobling sense of national unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe Speaker forfeits—actually, though perhaps not theoretically—his\r\nrights as the representative of a constituency in the House. He\r\nis disqualified from speaking in the debates and voting in the\r\ndivisions. The constituency which he represents is, therefore, in\r\na sense disfranchised. But there is no record of a constituency\r\never having objected to its representative being made Speaker. No\r\ndoubt it appreciates the distinction. Formerly it was customary\r\nfor the Speaker to join in the debates and divisions when the House\r\nwas in Committee, he having left the Chair, and the proceedings\r\nbeing presided over by the Chairman. In Committee on the Bill for\r\nthe Union of Great Britain and Ireland, Mr. Speaker Addington, on\r\nFebruary 12, 1799, declared that, while he was in favour of the\r\nplan, he was strongly opposed to Catholic emancipation with which\r\nPitt was disposed to accompany it. If it were a question, he said,\r\nbetween the re-enactment of all the Popery laws for the repression of\r\nIreland, or the Union, coupled with Catholic emancipation, for the\r\npacification of Ireland, he would prefer the former. Again, during\r\nthe Committee stage of the Bill introduced by Henry Grattan, in 1813,\r\nto qualify Roman Catholics for election as Members of Parliament, an\r\namendment to omit the vital words, “to sit and vote in either House\r\nof Parliament,” was moved by Mr. Speaker Abbot (strongly opposed,\r\nlike Addington, to the removal of the Catholic disabilities), and\r\nhaving been carried by a majority, though only a small one of four\r\nvotes, proved fatal to the measure. Manners-Sutton also exercised his\r\nright to speak in Committee three times on such highly controversial\r\nquestions as Catholic emancipation and the claims of Dissenters\r\nto be admitted to the Universities, to both of which he, like his\r\npredecessors in the Chair, answered an uncompromising “No.”\r\n\r\nBut so high has the Chair of the House of Commons been since lifted\r\nabove the conflicts of politics, that partisanship so aggressive\r\nwould not now be tolerated in the Speaker. On the last two occasions\r\nthat a Speaker interested himself in proceedings in Committee, the\r\nquestions at issue had no relation whatever to Party politics. In\r\n1856 Shaw-Lefevre spoke in defence of the Board of Trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum, of which he was a member. In 1870 Evelyn Denison\r\nvoted to exempt horses employed on farms from a licence duty which\r\nwas proposed in the Budget. This was the last occasion that a Speaker\r\nin wig and gown passed through the division lobby to record his vote,\r\nand it is probable that never again will a Speaker speak or vote in\r\nCommittee. Indeed, Mr. Speaker Gully directed that his name should\r\nbe removed from the printed lists supplied to the clerks in the\r\ndivision lobbies for the purpose of recording how members voted. The\r\nonly vote which a Speaker now gives is a casting vote, should the\r\nnumbers on each side in a division be equal. It is the custom for the\r\nSpeaker to give his casting vote in such a way as to avoid making\r\nthe decision final—thus giving the House another opportunity of\r\nconsidering the question—and to state his reasons, which are entered\r\nin the _Journals_.\r\n\r\nOccasions for the Speaker’s casting vote rarely arise. Peel was\r\ncalled upon to give it but once during his eleven years of office;\r\nthat was on the Marriages Confirmation (Antwerp) Bill in July,\r\n1887. The object of the measure was to confirm marriages solemnized\r\nat Antwerp by a Dr. Potts, chaplain to a British and American\r\nchapel from 1880 to 1884, the invalidity of which was caused by a\r\ntechnicality. The tie was a motion to adjourn the debate, and Mr.\r\nSpeaker Peel gave his casting vote for the adjournment. Gully’s\r\nexperience in this respect was singular. On the sole occasion he was\r\ncalled upon to give his casting vote no tie really existed. It was on\r\nMay 11, 1899, in connection with the second reading of the Vehicles\r\n(Lights) Bill. “The tellers for the Ayes and the Noes came up to the\r\nTable almost at the same time,” said Gully, describing the incident.\r\n“One of the tellers gave his number as forty, and the teller for the\r\nAyes was then turned to and asked his number. In point of fact the\r\nteller for the Ayes had succeeded by a majority of three. His number\r\nshould have been forty-three, but he was so elated at hearing of a\r\nvictory which he had not expected that at the moment he only repeated\r\nwhat the other Member had said, and he said ‘forty,’ whereupon there\r\nwas a tie. I then gave my vote for the Ayes, doing that which a\r\nSpeaker always did on such occasions, although I do not think I had\r\nformed any opinion at all upon the Bill. Still, in doing what I did\r\nI pursued the proper course, because it gave the opportunity on the\r\nthird reading for the expression of a decided opinion on the Bill.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n“ORDER, ORDER!”\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities, then, which make a successful President of\r\nthe representative Chamber? “Go and assemble yourselves together, and\r\nelect one, a discreet, wise, and learned man, to be your Speaker.”\r\nSuch were the words a Lord Chancellor in the reign of Elizabeth\r\naddressed to a new House of Commons. The order in which the qualities\r\ndeemed essential for the Speaker are arranged is not without its\r\nsignificance. Discretion comes first. It might be given the second\r\nplace and the third also. Marked ability is by no means indispensable\r\nin a Speaker. Intellectually his duties are not searching. But\r\nundoubtedly in the twentieth century, as in the sixteenth, the\r\nfaculty which is of the highest importance in the art of the\r\nSpeakership is sagacity, prudence, circumspection—making allowances\r\nfor the weaknesses and eccentricities of human nature.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn Denison had sat in the House for more than thirty years\r\nwhen, in 1857, he was chosen Speaker. Nevertheless, he was awed by\r\nthe responsibilities of the Chair. In such a position timorousness\r\nor irresolution would be fatal. To Denison the prospect was not made\r\nless formidable by the reply which he got from his predecessor on\r\ninquiring whether there was anyone to whom he could go for advice\r\nand assistance on trying occasions. “No one,” said Shaw-Lefevre;\r\n“you must learn to rely entirely upon yourself.” “And,” proceeds\r\nDenison in his _Diary_, “I found this to be very true. Sometimes a\r\nfriend would hasten to the Chair and offer advice. I must say, it\r\nwas for the most part lucky I did not follow the advice. I spent the\r\nfirst few years of my Speakership like the captain of a steamer on\r\nthe Thames, standing on the paddle-box, ever on the look-out for\r\nshocks and collisions.” But these “shocks and collisions” are rarely\r\nuncommon or unfamiliar. The House of Commons has not had a life\r\nand growth of several centuries without providing an abundance of\r\nprecepts and examples for the guidance of its Speaker. Very little\r\nhappens in the House of Commons that has not happened there often\r\nbefore. Almost every contingency that can possibly arise is covered\r\nby a precedent, and if a Speaker be but acquainted with the forms\r\nand procedure of the House and the rulings of his predecessors, both\r\nof which hedge his course, he cannot go far astray. Nor is it the\r\nfact that there is no one to whom he can go for advice. It is the\r\ncustom for Members to give the Speaker private notice of questions on\r\npoints of order; unless, of course, such as spring up unexpectedly in\r\ndebate; and for aid in the decision of these questions the Speaker\r\nhas not only the clerks who sit at the Table below him to refer to,\r\nif necessary, as to custom and procedure, but also a counsel outside\r\nto direct him on points of law. “I used to study the business of\r\nthe day carefully every morning,” says Denison, “and consider what\r\nquestions could arise upon it. Upon these questions I prepared myself\r\nby referring to the rules, or, if needful, to precedents.” It is also\r\nthe practice for the clerks to have an audience with the Speaker\r\nevery day before the House meets, to draw his attention to points of\r\norder that are likely to arise, and to confer with him generally on\r\nthe business of the day. Therefore it is a rare experience for the\r\nSpeaker to be brought suddenly face to face with an unprecedented\r\nsituation. And in such a difficulty he has the advantage of being\r\nable, as the supreme authority in the House, to impose his ruling\r\nunquestioned on all concerned, even should he have gone beyond his\r\nexact functions and powers as the director of debate, the preserver\r\nof order, the guardian of the rights of Members. Mr. Speaker Lowther\r\nwas asked, May 14, 1920, how a mistake he might make could be\r\nredressed. His reply, greeted with loud laughter, was “The Chair,\r\nlike the Pope, is infallible.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that smooth and easy is the way\r\nof the President of the House of Commons. The whole art of the\r\nSpeakership does not consist in presenting a dignified, ceremonial\r\nfigure, in wig and gown, on a carved and canopied Chair, and having a\r\nmastery of the technicalities of procedure. The situation that tests\r\nmost severely the mettle of the Speaker is one that not infrequently\r\narises in the House of Commons, when there is what the newspapers\r\ncall “a scene,” and he is expected to stand forth on the dais of\r\nthe Chair the one calm, serious, stern and impartial personality,\r\nlooming above the noise and recrimination which arises from the\r\nbenches below. It is not cleverness that is then the indispensable\r\nquality in a Speaker. More to the purpose, for the controlling\r\nand the moderating of the passions of a popular assembly, are the\r\nsuperficial gifts of an impressive presence, an air of authority, a\r\nready tongue, and a resonant voice. Still, the control of the House\r\nin such an emergency will depend not so much upon the appearance, the\r\ntemperament, the elocution of Mr. Speaker, as upon the measure of the\r\nconfidence and respect of Members which he has previously won by more\r\nsterling qualities; and the qualities upon which the trust of the\r\nHouse of Commons in its Speaker reposes most securely and abidingly\r\nare strength of character, fairness of mind, urbanity of temper, or a\r\ncombination of tactful firmness with strict impartiality.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is difficult for the Speaker to appear impartial at all\r\nmoments and to all sections of the House. Some passing feeling of\r\nsoreness will inevitably be felt by Members censured, or placed at a\r\ndisadvantage in Party engagements, by decisions of the Chair. But if\r\nthe Speaker has not impressed the House generally with his discretion\r\nand judgment, with confidence in the impartiality of his rulings,\r\nwith the conviction that he regards himself as the guardian of the\r\nHouse, and not the auxiliary of the Government in getting business\r\ndone, that feeling of soreness will not be, as it ought to be, brief\r\nand transient, and the Speaker will find on a crucial occasion that\r\nthe Assembly has passed from his control.\r\n\r\nEven so, the Speaker must not be too stern in action or demeanour.\r\nI have witnessed many violent scenes in the House of Commons, and I\r\nhave invariably noticed that, in a clash of will and tempers, genial\r\nexpostulation by the Chair is most potent in the restoration of\r\norder. Disraeli said of Denison that even “the rustle of his robes,”\r\nas he rose to rebuke a breach of order, was sufficient to awe the\r\nunruly Member into submission. But Members are not disposed to forget\r\nthat, after all, the Speaker is but the servant of the House. There\r\nwas once a very proud and haughty Speaker, Sir Edward Seymour by\r\nname, in the reign of Charles II. “You are too big for the Chair and\r\nfor us,” said a Member smarting under a reprimand or a ruling. “For\r\nyou, that think yourself one of the governors of the world, to be\r\nour servant is incongruous.” The Speaker must not be too fastidious\r\nor impatient with the commonplace or the eccentric. He should have\r\na genial tolerance of the extravagant in personality and character,\r\nwhich is certain to appear in company of 707 men, chosen from all\r\nclasses and all parts of the kingdom, and which, indeed, makes the\r\nHouse of Commons a place of infinite interest, abounding in humour\r\nand comedy. Moreover, the House will not tolerate the despot or the\r\nmaster in an officer of its own creation. Indeed, it is a mistake\r\nto suppose that the Speaker wields unfettered authority, that his\r\nindividual will is law in the House of Commons. It is true that his\r\ncontrolling powers are great, and that his rulings on points of order\r\nand procedure are final. But the will which he imposes upon the House\r\nis not his own: it is the law of the House itself, for everything he\r\ndoes must be in accordance with rule and precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBut suppose a Speaker, who, of course, puts his own interpretation\r\non precedents and Standing Orders, ultimately finds that he has made\r\na wrong ruling, what ought he to do in the way of rectifying it?\r\nThomas Moore relates in his _Diary_ an extraordinary discussion on\r\nthis point with Manners-Sutton after dinner one evening in 1829 at\r\nthe Speaker’s house. “Dwelt much on the advantages of humbug,” writes\r\nMoore, in reference to Manners-Sutton; “of a man knowing how to take\r\ncare of his reputation, and to keep from being _found out_, so as\r\nalways to pass for cleverer than he is.” Moore says he himself argued\r\nthat this denoted a wise man, not a humbug. If by that line of policy\r\na man induced his fellow-men to give him credit for being cleverer\r\nthan he really was, the fault could not be his, so long as he did not\r\nhimself advance any claim to it as his due. The moment he _pretended_\r\nto be what he was not, then began humbug, but not sooner. The poet\r\nthen goes on:\r\n\r\n  He still pushed his point, playfully, but pertinaciously, and in\r\n  illustration of what he meant put the following case: “Suppose\r\n  a Speaker rather new to his office, and a question brought into\r\n  discussion before him which Parties are equally divided upon,\r\n  and which he sees will run to very inconvenient lengths if not\r\n  instantly decided. Well, though ignorant entirely on the subject,\r\n  he assumes an air of authority, and gives his decision, which sets\r\n  the matter at rest. On going home he finds that he has decided\r\n  quite wrongly; and then, without making any further fuss about the\r\n  business, he quietly goes and _alters_ the _entry_ on the Journals.”\r\n\r\nMoore again insisted that wisdom, and not humbug, was the\r\ncharacteristic of such an action. “To his _supposed_ case all I had\r\nto answer,” the poet writes, “was that I still thought the man a\r\nwise one, and no humbug; by his resolution in a moment of difficulty\r\nhe prevented a _present_ mischief, and by his withdrawal of a wrong\r\nprecedent averted a _future_ one.”\r\n\r\nThere are only two instances of the action of a Speaker being made\r\nthe subject of a motion of censure, followed by a division. In\r\nneither case, however, was the motion carried. On July 11, 1879,\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell moved a vote of censure on Mr. Speaker\r\nBrand on the ground that he had exceeded his duty in directing\r\nthe clerks at the Table to take notes of the speeches of the\r\nNationalist Members, then inaugurating their policy of obstructing\r\nthe proceedings of the House. The motion was lost by 421 votes to 29,\r\nor a majority of 392—one of the largest recorded in the history of\r\nParliament. The Irish Members were also the movers of the other vote\r\nof censure on the Speaker. On March 20, 1902, Joseph Chamberlain,\r\nthen Colonial Secretary, speaking on the concluding stages of the\r\nSouth African War, quoted a saying of Vilonel, the Boer General,\r\nthat the enemies of South Africa were those who were continuing a\r\nhopeless struggle. “He is a traitor,” interjected John Dillon, the\r\nIrish Nationalist, and Chamberlain retorted; “The hon. gentleman\r\nis a good judge of traitors.” Dillon appealed to the Chair whether\r\nthe expression of the Colonial Secretary was not unparliamentary.\r\n“I deprecate interruptions and retorts,” replied Mr. Speaker Gully,\r\n“and if the hon. gentleman had not himself interrupted the right\r\nhon. gentleman, he would not have been subjected to a retort.” “Then\r\nI desire to say that the right hon. gentleman is a damned liar!”\r\nexclaimed Dillon. He was thereupon “named” by the Speaker, and, on\r\nthe motion of Arthur Balfour, was suspended from the service of the\r\nHouse. On May 7th J. J. Mooney, a Member of the Irish Party, moved\r\nthat the Speaker ought to have ruled that the words applied by the\r\nColonial Secretary to Dillon were unparliamentary, and accordingly\r\nhave directed Chamberlain to withdraw them. On a division the action\r\nof the Chair was supported by 398 votes to 63, or a majority of 335.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIf the duties of the Speakership are arduous, its dignity is high\r\nand its emoluments handsome. In former times the Speaker was paid\r\na salary of £5 a day, and a fee of £5 on every Private Bill. This\r\nfluctuating income was replaced by a fixed salary of £6,000 a year\r\non the election of Henry Addington to the Chair in 1789. It was also\r\ndecided at the same time that a sum of £1,000 equipment money was\r\nto be given to the Speaker on his first appointment. In the reign\r\nof William IV the salary was reduced to £5,000 to be paid, free\r\nof all taxes, out of the Consolidated Fund direct, without having\r\nto be voted every year by the House of Commons. At the same time\r\nan official secretary, with a salary of £500, was attached to the\r\noffice. The Speaker also has a residence, furnished by the State\r\nand free of rent, rates and taxes, with coal and light supplied.\r\nThe Speaker’s house is in that conspicuous wing of the Palace of\r\nWestminster, with its carved stonework and gothic windows, extending\r\nfrom the Clock Tower to the river. It was first occupied by John\r\nEvelyn Denison in 1857. Here the Speaker gives several official\r\nentertainments during session. There are dinners to the Ministers,\r\nto the leader Members of the Opposition, and to private Members.\r\nAccording to long-established custom, a Member who accepts an\r\ninvitation to dine with Mr. Speaker is required to appear either in\r\nuniform or Court dress, ordinary evening dress being debarred. As\r\na result, many eminent parliamentarians, such as William Cobbett,\r\nJoseph Hume, Richard Cobden, John Bright, Joseph Cowen, all sturdy\r\ndemocrats and Radicals, who could not bring themselves to wear Court\r\ndress, never had the pleasure of dining as guests of Mr. Speaker.\r\nThe rule is still enforced. The only departure from it was made by\r\nMr. Speaker Peel during the short Liberal Parliament of 1895, when\r\nhe had a separate dinner party of the Labour Members of the House,\r\nand told them they might come in any dress they pleased. But that\r\nprecedent, at least, has not once been followed at Westminster,\r\nthough subsequent Speakers have in such cases given luncheons instead\r\nof dinners. The Speaker is attired at these dinners in a black velvet\r\nCourt suit, knee-breeches with silk stockings, a steel-handled\r\nsword by his side, and lace ruffles round his neck and wrists. The\r\ntable and huge sideboards in the oak-panelled rooms are spread with\r\nmagnificent old plate, and the walls are hung with portraits of many\r\nfamous “First Commoners.”\r\n\r\nThe Speaker is the First Commoner of the Realm, according to an Act\r\nof Parliament passed in 1688 (1 William and Mary, c. 21) after the\r\nRevolution. It provided that the Speaker’s place in the order of\r\nprecedence is next after the peers of the Realm. In 1919 the Speaker\r\nwas raised a great many steps in the scale. By an Order in Council\r\nissued by King George V it was ordained that he “shall have, hold and\r\nenjoy place, pre-eminence and precedence, immediately after the Lord\r\nPresident of the Council,” which makes him the seventh subject of\r\nthe Realm. The order is: Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chancellor,\r\nArchbishop of York, Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lord\r\nPresident of the Council, the Speaker.\r\n\r\nThe Speakership is one of the highest prizes of political ambition.\r\nIn dignity and importance it is next, perhaps, to the office of\r\nPrime Minister. Four Speakers have resigned in order to become\r\nPrime Ministers. One of them, Henry Addington, after being Speaker\r\nfor twelve years, was summoned by George III, in 1801, to form an\r\nAdministration in succession to Pitt’s, which failed to complete its\r\nIrish policy at the Union, owing to the King’s rooted objection to\r\nCatholic emancipation. The only position for which the Speakership\r\nwould be relinquished is certainly that of Prime Minister. Sir John\r\nFreeman-Mitford, who followed Addington in the Chair, resigned after\r\na year’s service in order to become Lord Chancellor of Ireland;\r\nbut he did so only at the earnest solicitation of the King and\r\nthe solatium of a salary of £10,000 per year and a peerage as\r\nLord Redesdale. The Lord Chancellorship of Ireland is a high and\r\nhonourable position, but it is unlikely that anyone would now give\r\nup the Speakership of the House of Commons for it. Charles Abbot\r\nresigned the Chief Secretaryship for Ireland—a post of greater\r\npolitical importance than that of the Lord Chancellorship—in order to\r\nsucceed Freeman-Mitford as Speaker in 1802. Abbot refused the offer\r\nof a Secretaryship of State from Perceval, the Prime Minister, in\r\n1809 during his occupancy of the Chair; and Manners-Sutton could have\r\nbeen Home Secretary in the Administration formed in 1827 by Canning,\r\nbut he did not think it good enough.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Ministers have been willing to give up their\r\nportfolios for the Speaker’s Chair. Spring Rice, Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer of the Melbourne Administration, had his heart set on that\r\ncoveted office. He was in the running for the Speakership in 1835,\r\nwhen James Abercromby was elected. In 1838 Abercromby intimated to\r\nLord Melbourne his intention to resign—throwing a curious side-light\r\non the relations at the time between Mr. Speaker and the Treasury\r\nBench—because from the attitude of Lord John Russell, the Leader of\r\nthe House, he felt he no longer possessed that degree of Ministerial\r\nconfidence which, in his opinion, was essential to the due conduct of\r\npublic business and the maintenance of the authority of the Chair.\r\nThe Prime Minister induced Abercromby to postpone his resignation,\r\nand at the same time satisfied the renewed pretensions of his\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer with the promise that he should be the\r\nGovernment candidate for the Chair whenever it became vacant. But\r\nwhen Abercromby retired in the following year it was found that\r\nSpring Rice was not acceptable to the Radicals, and Shaw-Lefevre was\r\nselected in order to maintain the unity of the Party and preserve\r\nthe Liberal succession to the Chair. Again, on the resignation of\r\nArthur Wellesley Peel in 1895, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was\r\nwilling to lay down his portfolio as Secretary of State for War\r\nin the then Liberal Government for the object of his ambition—the\r\nSpeakership; and it is said that he reluctantly yielded to the urgent\r\nrepresentations of his colleagues that the Party could ill spare his\r\nservices. Just ten years later he became Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nStill, the office has, as a rule, fallen to unofficial Members, or to\r\nMembers who have held subordinate Ministerial appointments. Denison,\r\nin the opening passages of his _Diary_, states that on April 8, 1857,\r\nhe was seated in his library at Ossington, when the letters were\r\nbrought in, and among them was the following:\r\n\r\n                                                94 PICCADILLY,\r\n                                                      _April 7, 1857_.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR DENISON,\r\n\r\n  We wish to be allowed to propose you for the Speakership of the\r\n  House of Commons. Will you agree?\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                           PALMERSTON.\r\n\r\nDenison says the proposal took him by surprise. “Though,” he writes,\r\n“I had attended of late years to several branches of the private\r\nbusiness, and had taken more part in the public business of the House\r\nof Commons, I had never made the duties of the Chair my special\r\nstudy.” William Court Gully had been ten years in Parliament before\r\nhis elevation to the Speaker’s Chair, but he was one of that large,\r\nmodest band of “silent Members” who, confining themselves to voting\r\nin the division lobbies, are unknown in debate, and, consequently,\r\nare never mentioned in the papers. Moreover, being a busy lawyer,\r\nGully took little or no part in the routine work of the House, such\r\nas service on Committees upstairs, which is supposed to afford a good\r\ntraining for the Speakership. Indeed, the Chair may be said to be the\r\none great prize that is open to the occupants of the back benches\r\nas well as the front benches who possess the necessary physical and\r\nmental qualities. Personal appearance is undoubtedly an essential\r\nqualification for the office. This includes the possession of clear\r\nvision. A Speaker with spectacles would look incongruous in an\r\nassembly where the competition to catch his eye is so keen.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe term of office of Mr. Speaker is usually short. Arthur Onslow,\r\nwho was elected in 1726, continued in possession of the Chair for\r\nthirty-five years, through five successive Parliaments, apparently\r\nwithout ruffling a hair of his wig. So long an occupancy is now\r\nwellnigh impossible. For one thing, the duties of Mr. Speaker are\r\nphysically more responsible and irksome. The sessions are longer,\r\nthe sittings of the House more protracted, and the fatigue of the\r\nprolonged and often tedious hours in the Chair must be most severe\r\nmentally and physically. Besides, there has grown up of late a\r\npreference for a certain maturity of age in the Speaker. Arthur\r\nOnslow was only thirty-six when he was called to the office. Henry\r\nAddington, who occupied the Speaker’s Chair at the opening of the\r\nnineteenth century, was thirty-two only on his appointment. William\r\nCourt Gully, who was in possession of the Chair at the opening of\r\nthe twentieth century, had passed his sixtieth year on his election.\r\nThe occupancy of the office must be comparatively brief if men are\r\nappointed to it only when their heads are grey or bald. Of recent\r\nSpeakers, Henry Bouverie Brand sat for twelve years, Arthur Wellesley\r\nPeel eleven years, William Court Gully ten years, James William\r\nLowther sixteen years.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker receives a pension of £4,000 a year. John Evelyn Denison\r\nrefused this retiring allowance. “Though without any pretensions\r\nto wealth,” he wrote to Gladstone, then Prime Minister, “I have a\r\nprivate fortune which will suffice, and for the few years of life\r\nthat remain to me I should be happier in feeling that I am not a\r\nburden to my fellow-countrymen.” He retired in February 1872, and\r\ndied, without heir, in March 1873. A peerage is also conferred\r\non the Speaker when he resigns. This was not the custom in the\r\neighteenth century. When Arthur Onslow retired in 1761, after his\r\nlong service of thirty-five years, George III, in reply to the\r\naddress of the Commons to confer on Onslow “some signal mark of\r\nhonour,” gave him a pension of £3,000 a year for the lives of himself\r\nand his son, but no peerage. The custom began in the nineteenth\r\ncentury with Charles Abbot, who, on retiring in 1817, was made\r\nBaron Colchester. Since then every Speaker has been “called to the\r\nHouse of Lords”—Manners-Sutton as Lord Canterbury; Abercromby as\r\nLord Dunfermline; Shaw-Lefevre as Lord Eversley; Denison as Lord\r\nOssington; Brand as Lord Hampton; Peel as Lord Peel; Gully as Lord\r\nSelby.\r\n\r\nBut he is Speaker no longer; another presides in his place; and\r\nwhat a shadowy personage he seems, even as a Lord, compared with\r\nthe resounding fame and distinction that were his in the glorious\r\nyears when he filled with pomp and dignity the Chair of the House of\r\nCommons!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOW A GOVERNMENT IS MADE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nMacaulay, writing to his sister Hannah on December 19, 1845, says:\r\n“It is an odd thing to see a Ministry making. I never witnessed the\r\nprocess before. Lord John Russell has been all day in his inner\r\nlibrary. His antechamber has been filled with comers and goers, some\r\ntalking in knots, some writing notes at tables. Every five minutes\r\nsomebody is called into the inner room. As the people who have been\r\ncloseted come out, the cry of the whole body of expectants is: ‘What\r\nare you?’ I was summoned almost as soon as I arrived, and found Lord\r\nAuckland and Lord Clarendon sitting with Lord John. After some talk\r\nabout other matters, Lord John told me that he had be trying to\r\nascertain my wishes, and that he found I wanted leisure and quiet\r\nmore than salary and business. Labouchere had told him this. He\r\ntherefore offered me the Pay Office, one of the three places which,\r\nas I have told you, I should prefer. I at once accepted it.”\r\n\r\nBut this Ministry was fated not to be formed. Both Lord Grey and Lord\r\nPalmerston, two leading members of the Whig Party, wanted the Foreign\r\nOffice, and neither would recognize a superior claim in the other.\r\nMacaulay, from whose very lips the cup of office was thus rudely\r\ndashed, bore the disappointment philosophically. On the day after\r\nhe had sent the letter, from which I have quoted, he wrote another\r\nto his sister, saying: “All is over. Late at night, just as I was\r\nundressing, a knock was given at the door of my chambers. A messenger\r\nhad come from Lord John with a short note. The quarrel between Lord\r\nGrey and Lord Palmerston had made it impossible to form a Ministry.\r\nI went to bed and slept sound.”\r\n\r\nWhen we come to consider the interesting business of making a\r\nGovernment, the first question that arises is—What is the chief\r\ntest of a man’s capacity for office? Under our Constitution, with\r\nits free and unfettered Parliament, of which the Ministers must be\r\nMembers, a deliberative assembly where everything is made the subject\r\nof talk, talk, talk, and provided with a Reporters’ Gallery for the\r\ndissemination of its debates through the Press, it is inevitable that\r\na man’s fitness for a post in the Administration should be decided\r\nmainly by his gift of speech. It must often prove a false standard\r\nof judgment in regard to genuine ability and character. Glibness of\r\ntongue, or even oratory, is certainly not an essential qualification\r\nfor the administrative duties of government. Still, the fact remains\r\nthat the ready talker with but little practical experience of affairs\r\nhas a better chance of office than the man of trained business\r\ncapacity who is tongue-tied. Perhaps debaters are really more useful\r\nto a Government than business men in an arena of conflict like the\r\nHouse of Commons. There are some excellent anecdotes pointing to such\r\na conclusion. Disraeli, forming an Administration, offered the Board\r\nof Trade to a man who wanted instead the Local Government Board, as\r\nhe was better acquainted with the municipal affairs of the country\r\nthan its commerce. “It doesn’t matter,” said Disraeli; “I suppose you\r\nknow as much about trade as Blank, the First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nknows about ships.” John Bright once said he asked Richard Lalor\r\nSheil, an eloquent speaker, but unconnected with commerce, how it\r\nhappened that he was appointed to the Board of Trade. “I think,”\r\nreplied Sheil, “the only reason is I was found to know less of trade\r\nthan any other man in the House of Commons.” Bright himself was made\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade in 1869. It used to be said in the\r\nDepartment that, so unfitted was he for administration, he did not\r\nknow even how to tie up official papers with red tape.\r\n\r\nWhen, at an earlier period of political history, Sidney Herbert,\r\nLord Herbert of Lea, resigned the War Office, Palmerston fixed upon\r\nSir George Cornewall Lewis to succeed him, and argued the point with\r\nLady Theresa Lewis, saying that the duties would not be military,\r\nbut civil. “He would have to look after the accounts,” said the\r\nPrime Minister. “He never can make up his own,” replied the wife.\r\n“He will look after the commissariat,” said the Prime Minister. “He\r\ncannot order his own dinner,” replied the wife. “He will control\r\nthe clothing department,” said the Prime Minister. “If my daughters\r\ndid not give the orders to his tailor, he would be without a coat,”\r\nreplied the wife. Cornewall Lewis, however, accepted the offer, and\r\nhis Under-Secretary soon afterwards discovered him in Pall Mall\r\nreading a work on the military tactics of the Lycaonians. Sir Arthur\r\nHelps, the essayist, who was Clerk of the Privy Council, used to tell\r\nthe story that once when there was a difficulty in finding a Colonial\r\nSecretary, Lord Palmerston said: “Well, I’ll take the colonies\r\nmyself,” and presently remarked to Helps: “Just come upstairs with\r\nme for half an hour and show me where these places are on the map.”\r\nCharles James Fox is said to have confessed his ignorance of what\r\nConsols meant. He gathered from the newspapers that they were “things\r\nwhich rose and fell”; and he was always delighted when they fell,\r\nbecause he noticed, that for some unaccountable reason, it very\r\nmuch annoyed Pitt, as Chancellor of the Exchequer. That, no doubt,\r\nwas Fox’s fun. But we are told of Lord Randolph Churchill, on the\r\nauthority of his son and biographer, Winston Churchill, that when, as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, Treasury returns worked out in decimal\r\nfigures were laid before him, he inquired what “these damned dots”\r\nsignified. I myself heard Sir Edward Carson, a distinguished lawyer,\r\nspeaking as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1917, during the Great\r\nWar, declare that he entered the Admiralty in a state of extreme\r\nignorance. “Someone asked me the day I went there how I felt,” he\r\nwent on to say, “and I said, ‘My only qualification is that I am\r\nabsolutely at sea.’”\r\n\r\nAfter all, perhaps, it is a matter of no very great concern. Are\r\nthere not capable permanent officials in the various Departments\r\nof the State, whose duty it is to see that administration is\r\nefficient and economical? The simple task of the Minister, as he\r\nsits behind the scenes in a room at Whitehall, is as a rule to see\r\nthat things are done in harmony with the political policy of his\r\nParty. What seems to be absolutely necessary to the prosperity of\r\nan Administration is that in the Houses of Parliament—open as they\r\nare to the gaze and hearing of the country—it should have at its\r\nservice a number of able debaters. The measures of the Government\r\nhave to be submitted to the judgment of a deliberative Assembly, and\r\na newspaper-reading public; and accordingly a successful Minister\r\nis he whose ready gift of clear and forcible exposition of Party\r\nprinciples and policies enables him to expound and defend these\r\nmeasures. Gladstone, when forming his first Government in 1868,\r\ninvited John Bright to join it, giving him his choice of any office,\r\nexcept the War Office or the Admiralty, which, as he was a Quaker and\r\na man of peace, would hardly suit him. Bright selected the position\r\nof President of the Board of Trade. As I have said, he never gave\r\nevidence of any special business capacity, but he was the greatest\r\norator of his day; he had uttered in the House of Commons and on\r\nthe public platform the most beautiful and also the most scornful\r\npassages that ever fell from the lips of man; he possessed debating\r\ngifts which enabled him to place a political question in a light that\r\nmade it shine beyond its deserts, and that being so he was deemed fit\r\nfor a place of importance and emolument in the new Government. What\r\nis the good of a Minister rising to the Table of the House of Commons\r\nwith an unanswerable case if he be unable to state it—if he be choked\r\nwith arguments for which he can find no utterance?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that when a General Election has pronounced\r\nthe sentence of condemnation on the existing Government, and men of\r\nanother Party are called to the service of the country, selection\r\nfor office is restricted mainly to those who have won distinction as\r\ndebaters in Opposition. On the benches to the left of Mr. Speaker are\r\nalways numbers of young men ambitious of office, eagerly pushing\r\nthemselves to the front on that conspicuous field of political\r\nactivity, under the eyes of the Reporters’ Gallery, most constant\r\nin their attendance, ever watching for an opportunity to strike\r\na blow at once for their Party and their own reputation, in the\r\nhope that in the day of victory they shall have the proper reward\r\nof their services. Some of them are capable of talking well upon\r\nany subject. These aspire to be Secretaries of State. Others, not\r\nso remarkable for general ability or so glib of tongue, confine\r\nthemselves to particular departments of administration. It is the\r\nendeavour of each to obtain a mastery of the business details of\r\nsome special office—Foreign, Home, Treasury, Colonial, Army, Navy,\r\nPost Office, Pensions, Trade, Transport, or Agriculture—looking for\r\nan Under-Secretaryship, in the expectation of ultimately attaining,\r\nafter some years of diligent and capable service, to Cabinet rank.\r\nYet the qualities needed for success in office are often entirely\r\ndifferent from those that bring fame and renown in Opposition.\r\nGladstone said of Robert Lowe, whom he appointed Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer in his first Administration on the strength of the\r\nreputation which that slashing debater had made in Opposition, that\r\nhe was “splendid in attack, but most weak in defence”; “that he was\r\ncapable of tearing anything to pieces, but of constructing nothing.”\r\nBut it is only after the brilliant swashbuckler of Opposition has\r\nbeen tried in office that his incapacity and weakness in the true\r\ngifts of statesmanship are discovered.\r\n\r\nBesides the pushful young men in the ranks on the back benches, with\r\ntheir abounding sense of fitness for office, there are the veterans\r\nof the Front Opposition Bench, survivors of the Ministry of the Party\r\nwhen it was last in power. Some of these, it often happens, are\r\nmen who have grown old and worn in the service, as their wrinkled\r\nfaces, bald heads, and stooped forms testify; but their interest in\r\npublic affairs has not in the least abated, and they still crave to\r\nbe placed at the head of Departments. It might be supposed that the\r\nweighty responsibility of office is a burden to be avoided rather\r\nthan coveted by old parliamentarians; the world has such pleasant\r\ndelights, apart from politics, with which they might occupy the\r\nleisure of the close of their day. But that is an idle supposition.\r\nIt is true that in the Senate of Rome, to which election was for\r\nlife, there was a special law providing that no senator over sixty\r\nshould be summoned to its meetings. Did any Roman ever willingly\r\nacquiesce in it except the physically incapable? In modern England\r\nhuman nature is exactly what it was in ancient Rome. The grievance of\r\nthe Front Bench man approaching seventy would be, not that he should\r\nbe dragged from seclusion and quiet to sit for hours of a morning in\r\na room at Whitehall, reading documents, and attend at the House of\r\nCommons till late at night, but that he should be set aside in the\r\ndistribution of offices when his Party has again triumphed at the\r\npolls. And he has tradition and custom at his back, in support of\r\nhis desire, as well as his past services. It is held that a member\r\nof either House of Parliament who has already been in the Cabinet is\r\nentitled to high office again whenever his Party comes back to power;\r\nand that, should he be passed over, should he be put on the retired\r\nlist, he has every reason to feel affronted.\r\n\r\nThese are the two classes—the old but the tried, the able but the\r\nuntrained young—from which the Prime Minister draws the members of\r\nhis Administration. As I have indicated, he has not an absolutely\r\nfree choice. He may not sit down in his study and, surveying the\r\nmost prominent members of his Party in both Houses, select for\r\noffice those who have proved themselves possessed of the qualities\r\nof character, ability, experience, and training. His task it is\r\nto satisfy, as far as possible, claims as conflicting as they are\r\nstrong, and, at the same time, give to his Administration that weight\r\nand authority which is necessary to win and hold, in some measure,\r\nthe confidence of the country. It is said that Gladstone, who formed\r\nno fewer than four Administrations—an almost unprecedented record in\r\nconstitutional history—used to draw up on separate slips of paper a\r\nlist of the various offices, placing opposite each the names of three\r\nor four more or less eligible men as alternatives, and then, by a\r\nprocess of sifting, evolve the definite list. But this method, which\r\nno doubt most Prime Ministers adopt more or less, is not at all the\r\nsimple matter it looks. It has to be followed out with exceeding\r\ncare and circumspection. For every post in the Ministry there are at\r\nleast three or four influential aspirants, old or young, each of whom\r\nthinks the office on which his mind is set is his by every title of\r\npersonal fitness and devotion to the Party. To adjust these rival\r\nclaims is, as I have said, no easy thing for the Prime Minister. Some\r\nof the office-seekers, those especially who know there are strong\r\nrivals in the field, insist upon personal interviews, in order to\r\nset forth their pretensions fully and unanswerably, and the serious\r\nloss the Party, if not the nation, would suffer were it not to have\r\nthe advantage of their services. Every post brings shoals of letters\r\nfrom Members of Parliament, and leading Party men in the country,\r\nstrongly urging the appointment of this person or that to a post in\r\nthe Ministry, or his inclusion in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nAnother important consideration of which the Prime Minister is\r\nobliged to take heed is the distribution of the offices of the\r\nAdministration between the House of Lords and the House of Commons.\r\nIt was provided by the Government of India Act, 1858—creating a\r\nfifth Secretary of State, that for India, the others being for\r\nForeign Affairs, Home, the Colonies, and War—that four Secretaries\r\nof State and four Under-Secretaries may sit as members of the House\r\nof Commons at the same time.[1] In 1864 notice was taken that five\r\nUnder-Secretaries were sitting in the House of Commons in violation\r\nof this statutory provision, and a motion was made that the seat of\r\nthe fifth Under-Secretary was thereby vacated. The House referred\r\nthe matter to a Committee, who reported that the seat of the\r\nUnder-Secretary last appointed was not vacated, but as the law had\r\nbeen inadvertently infringed, it was thought necessary to pass a\r\nBill of Indemnity. By the Air Force Act, 1917, a sixth Secretary\r\nof State, that for Air, was created, and the number of Principal\r\nSecretaries of State and Under-Secretaries capable of sitting in\r\nthe House of Commons was increased to five. The Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer must be in the representative Chamber, as the hereditary\r\nHouse cannot impose taxation. The holders of all the other prominent\r\noffices may be in one House or the other, as the Prime Minister\r\nthinks most convenient. But it has now become a rule, from which\r\nprobably there will never be a departure, of placing the Home\r\nSecretary—the Minister whose department comes most closely into\r\ntouch with the ordinary life of the citizen—and his Under-Secretary\r\nin the House of Commons. The Foreign Secretary, whose duties are\r\nmost delicate and responsible, has usually been given the greater\r\nfreedom and leisure of the House of Lords. Arthur Balfour declared in\r\nthe House of Commons, during the Session of 1905, that the Foreign\r\nSecretary would never again be seen in that Chamber, unless the\r\nHouse was prepared to release him from the ordinary obligations of a\r\nMinister. “Because, if you ask him,” continued the Prime Minister,\r\n“to come down to answer questions, or when his own office is under\r\ndiscussion; if you require him to come down, as my other right hon.\r\nfriends are required to come down, whenever there is a Government\r\ndivision or an important Government debate; if you require him to\r\nbe here throughout the whole night, and at the same time to carry\r\non the work of such an office as the Foreign Office—he cannot do\r\nit. I respectfully say it with full knowledge both of what the\r\nHouse of Commons requires and what is required of the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs.” Sir Edward Grey subsequently sat in the House of\r\nCommons for ten years, as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but\r\nconcessions in regard to answering questions and general attendance\r\nwere granted him of the kind indicated by Balfour. The other\r\nSecretaries of State—War, Colonies, India—may be in either the House\r\nof Lords or the House of Commons, subject to the statutory provisions\r\nI have mentioned, but in whatever Chamber the Principal Secretary may\r\nbe, the Under-Secretary of the same department must be in the other.\r\nThe religion of aspirants to office must also be taken into account\r\nby the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThere are two positions in the Government for which Roman Catholics\r\nare ineligible—the Lord Chancellorship of England and the Lord\r\nLieutenancy of Ireland. In 1891 Gladstone brought in a Bill “for the\r\nremoval of the religious disabilities of Roman Catholics to hold\r\nthe offices of Lord Chancellor of England and Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland.” It was opposed by the Unionist Government then in power,\r\nand was defeated by 256 votes to 223. It was known as “The Ripon and\r\nRussell Relief Bill,” as it was well understood that if the Bill were\r\ncarried Gladstone, on his return to office, intended to make the then\r\nLord Ripon, who was a Catholic, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and Sir\r\nCharles Russell, also a Catholic, Lord Chancellor of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe process by which the Government is formed is, constitutionally,\r\nmost interesting; but even in the best of circumstances, and apart\r\naltogether from the limitations to his unfettered choice which I\r\nhave set out, it must indeed be harassing to the Prime Minister.\r\nIf his power and influence are great, so are his embarrassments\r\nand difficulties. “Lord Grey is in a dreadful state of anxiety and\r\nannoyance; thinks he shall break down under his load,” wrote Lord\r\nTavistock to his brother, Lord John Russell, in 1830, during the\r\nmaking of the first Reform Administration. Disraeli, speaking in\r\nthe House of Commons in March 1873, described the constitution of a\r\nnew Government as “a work of great time, great labour, and of great\r\nresponsibility,” and declared that the task had to be discharged\r\nsolely by the Prime Minister. “It is a duty which can be delegated\r\nto no one,” he said. “All the correspondence and all the interviews\r\nmust be conducted by himself, and, without dwelling on the sense of\r\nresponsibility involved, the perception of fitness requisite, and\r\nthe severe impartiality necessary in deciding on contending claims,\r\nthe mere physical effort is not slight.” The only Prime Minister,\r\nperhaps, who approached the task of making an Administration with\r\na sense of gaiety not unmingled with irresponsibility was Lord\r\nPalmerston. He had the engaging weakness of putting square men in\r\nround holes and round men in square holes, and the reconstruction\r\nof the Ministry which sometimes followed as a consequence was, to\r\nhim, only a fresh source of laughter. “Ah, ha!” he would cry, “what\r\na delightful comedy of errors!” Gladstone, while revelling in the\r\npower and authority of the position, was deeply impressed also by\r\nits gravity and solemnity. He writes in his diary, January 29, 1886:\r\n“At a quarter after midnight in came Sir H. Ponsonby with verbal\r\ncommunication from Her Majesty, which I at once accepted.” It was the\r\ncommand to form his third Administration, that which came quickly to\r\ngrief on the question of Home Rule. Next day, Saturday, was spent by\r\nGladstone in consultation with his principal colleagues. After church\r\non Sunday, from one o’clock till eight, political business engrossed\r\nhis attention. “At night came a painful and harassing succession of\r\nletters,” he writes, “and my sleep for once gave way; yet for the\r\nsoul it was profitable, driving me to the hope that the strength of\r\nGod might be made manifest in my weakness.” Next morning he went down\r\nto Osborne to attend the Queen, had two audiences with her Majesty,\r\nan hour and a half in all, and in the evening returned to London.\r\nHe writes in his diary the following day: “I kissed hands, and am\r\nthereby Prime Minister for the third time. But, as I trust, for a\r\nbrief time only—slept well. D. G.”\r\n\r\nJohn Morley, summarizing in his _Life of Gladstone_ the\r\ncorrespondence which Gladstone received while he was engaged in\r\nforming an Administration, writes: “One admirable man with intrepid\r\n_naïveté_ proposed himself for the Cabinet, but was not admitted;\r\nanother no less admirable was pressed to enter, but felt that he\r\ncould be more useful as an independent Member, and declined—an\r\nhonourable transaction, repeated by the same person on more than one\r\noccasion later. To one excellent member of his former Cabinet the\r\nPrime Minister proposed the Chairmanship of Committees, and it was\r\nwith some tartness refused. Another equally excellent member of the\r\nold Administration he endeavoured to plant out in the Viceregal Lodge\r\nin Dublin, without the Cabinet, but in vain. To a third he proposed\r\nthe Indian Viceroyalty, and received an answer that left him ‘stunned\r\nand out of breath.’”\r\n\r\nIt is also entertaining to study the varied feelings with which\r\npoliticians have received the offer of office. “Dear Henry,” wrote\r\nRobert Lowe in a brief, laconic note to his brother in December 1868,\r\n“I am Chancellor of the Exchequer with everything to learn. Yours\r\naffectionately.” It was the surprise appointment of Gladstone’s first\r\nAdministration, for Lowe had previously shown but little interest in\r\nfinance. His administration of the office soon ended in an abortive\r\nattempt to impose a tax on matches. In another letter to a friend,\r\nLowe said: “I have this day accepted the office of Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer in Gladstone’s Government. I am almost angry with myself\r\nfor not being more pleased. One gets these things, but gets them too\r\nlate. Ten years ago I should have been very differently affected.\r\nHowever, it is something to have done what I said I would do.” It was\r\na curious frame of mind in which to enter upon a great office. He had\r\nsaid he would be a Cabinet Minister, and the thing had come to pass.\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\nThat eminent lawyer, John Duke Coleridge, returned home from a\r\nconcert on the night of December 4, 1868, to find—as he records in\r\nhis diary—“Gladstone’s messenger waiting with an offer of the S.G.,\r\nCollier to be A.G.” The letter of the Prime Minister was written\r\nfrom “11 Carlton House Terrace,” and marked “Most Private.” “I need\r\nnot spend words,” said Gladstone, “in assuring you that I anticipate\r\ngreat advantage to the new Government from your most valuable\r\naid, and that I look forward with great pleasure to the relations\r\nwhich will, I hope, be established between us.” Coleridge sent the\r\nmessenger back with a note refusing the post absolutely. He doubted\r\nwhether, as Solicitor-General, he could serve with satisfaction under\r\nthe proposed Attorney-General, Sir Robert Collier. “I know well,”\r\nhe wrote, “that a man who once puts office by puts it by probably\r\nfor ever; and you will not suppose that I send this answer without\r\nregret and a considerable struggle. But I am sure it is my duty to do\r\nit.” Next morning Coleridge received another letter inviting him to\r\ncome to 11 Carlton House Terrace. “So I had to go to him,” Coleridge\r\nwrites on December 5th. “He was most kind, and urged me to accept.”\r\nTwo days later he says: “So the deed is done, and I suppose in a few\r\ndays I shall be Minister.” On Saturday, December 10th, he went down\r\nto Windsor, “with a lot of Ministers coming in and going out,” had\r\nluncheon, saw the Queen, and was knighted. “I could not help it,”\r\nhe adds. What chance had his weak human disinclination for office\r\nagainst the working of resistless, inevitable Fate?\r\n\r\nAt a Press Club dinner in London, John Morley related the\r\ncircumstances in which he received and accepted in 1886 the offer\r\nof the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, with a seat in the\r\nCabinet. “It was whilst I was writing a leading article for a certain\r\nperiodical,” said he, “that I received a letter from an illustrious\r\nstatesman, who was then forming a Government, offering me a post in\r\nhis Cabinet.” “Gentlemen,” he added, amid the cheers and the laughter\r\nof the company, “so strong in me was the journalistic instinct that,\r\nafter accepting the illustrious statesman’s offer, I went back and\r\nfinished that leading article. And I can assure you that neither the\r\ngrammar nor the style of the latter half of the article fell short\r\nof my usual standard.” One of the most humanly interesting books\r\ndealing with public life in England is _From a Stonemason’s Bench to\r\nthe Treasury Bench_, in which Henry Broadhurst tells the story of his\r\ncareer. In 1886 he was Secretary to the Parliamentary Committee of\r\nthe Trades Union Congress and a Member of Parliament. One busy day at\r\nhis office a letter was handed to him by a messenger, and, opening\r\nthe envelope, he found the following communication:\r\n\r\n  (Secret)\r\n\r\n                                  21 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, S.W.\r\n                                                  _February 5, 1886._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. BROADHURST,\r\n\r\n  I have great pleasure in proposing to you that you should accept\r\n  office as Under-Secretary of State in the Home Department. Alike\r\n  on private and on public grounds, I trust it may be agreeable to\r\n  you to accept this appointment, which should remain strictly secret\r\n  until your name shall have been laid before her Majesty.\r\n\r\n                     I remain, with much regard, sincerely yours,\r\n                                                      W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom, Broadhurst immediately called upon the Prime\r\nMinister. He said that if it were Mr. Gladstone’s wish that he should\r\njoin the Administration, he hoped it would be in some capacity less\r\nimportant than that of Under-Secretary of the Home Office. But the\r\nPrime Minister would not listen to any objections to the offer.\r\n“I’ll answer for you myself,” said he, playfully. “You must prepare\r\nat once to enter upon the duties of the office.” Broadhurst adds:\r\n“I can honestly declare that I left Mr. Gladstone’s house without\r\nany of those feelings of exhilaration and pleasing excitement which\r\nthe gift of office is generally supposed to awake in the breast of\r\nthe politician.” He lived the hard struggle of his early years over\r\nagain in the next half-hour. “The lowly beginning of my career,”\r\nhe says, “its labours at the forge and the stonemason’s shop, the\r\nprivations, the wanderings, and my varying fortunes, stood out in my\r\nmind’s eye as clearly as so many living pictures. Especially did my\r\nmemory recall the months I had spent working on the very Government\r\nbuildings which I was about to enter as a Minister of the Crown.”\r\nHe deplored the lack of education in his early days, and visions\r\nof failure and humiliation in the discharge of his new duties, in\r\nconsequence, tormented him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDISAPPOINTED HOPES\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIt is probably as annoying to an expectant Minister to be offered\r\nwhat he regards as an inferior post as to be entirely ignored. Sir\r\nRobert Peel, in December 1834, offered Lord Ashley (subsequently the\r\nEarl of Shaftesbury) a seat on the Board of Admiralty, which Lord\r\nAshley, thinking it altogether beneath him, promptly refused. “Had\r\nI not,” he writes in his _Diary_, “by God’s grace and the study of\r\nreligion subdued the passion of my youth, I should now have been\r\nheart-broken. Canning, eight years ago, offered me, as a neophyte,\r\na seat at one of the Boards, the first step in a young statesman’s\r\nlife. If I am not now worthy of more, it is surely better to cease\r\nto be a candidate for public honours. Yet Peel’s letter, so full\r\nof flummery, would lead anyone to believe that I was a host of\r\nexcellency. The thing is a contradiction.” Nevertheless, it is\r\ninteresting to note that he accepted the post subsequently. He\r\nsatisfied himself that it was of more importance than he at first\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nNo politician had such curious adventures as an aspirant to office,\r\nand certainly no one has confessed so freely the bitterness of\r\nhis disappointments, as Shaftesbury, whose name is so honourably\r\nassociated with legislation for the protection of women and children\r\nemployed in factories. In 1839 Peel was again engaged in making a\r\nGovernment. Queen Victoria had hardly been two years on the Throne,\r\nand was only twenty years of age. Peel invited Lord Ashley to accept\r\na post in the Royal Household, urging that he desired to have around\r\n“this young woman, on whose moral and religious character depends\r\nthe welfare of millions of human beings,” persons whose conversation\r\nwould tend to her moral improvement. Lord Ashley acknowledges that he\r\nwas “thunderstruck” when he received Peel’s letter, as he expected a\r\nfar higher position than what he describes as “a mere Court puppet.”\r\nBut in his reply he said, somewhat sarcastically, that if Peel\r\ndesired it, he was willing to take “the office of chief scullion to\r\nthe Court.” However, this Administration was not constituted. It\r\nwas wrecked on what is known as “the Bedchamber question.” As one\r\nof the ladies of the Bedchamber, the Mistress of the Robes, who was\r\nmost closely in attendance upon Queen Victoria, was related to some\r\nof the outgoing Whig Ministers, by whom she had been appointed—the\r\noffice being at the time political, and its occupant bound to go out\r\non a change of Government—Peel insisted upon her resignation. The\r\nQueen refused to consent to such a course, as one repugnant to her\r\nfeelings, and Peel, thereupon refusing to form an Administration, the\r\nMelbourne Ministry were recalled to office. Two years later Peel was\r\nengaged once more in making a Government—this time Queen Victoria\r\nraised no objection to the Mistress of the Robes being changed—and\r\nagain he offered Lord Ashley a place in the Royal Household, as a\r\nman who was deeply religious and moral. Lord Ashley now believed\r\nthat Peel simply wanted to muzzle him, the leader of the growing\r\nhumanitarian movement for the State regulation of factories. He\r\nrefused the office. “I told Peel,” he wrote, “the case was altered;\r\nthe Court was no longer the same; the Queen was two years older, had\r\na child, and a husband to take care of her.” So he declined to devote\r\nhimself to ordering dinners and carrying a white wand. He discovered\r\nsubsequently, to his deep mortification, that Peel had already\r\noffered the post of Vice-Chamberlain of the Household to Lord ——\r\n(“the hero of Madame Grisi,” as Ashley describes him); and that Lord\r\n—— exclaimed: “Thank God, my character is too bad for a Household\r\nplace!” Lord Ashley argued that “morality, therefore, was not the\r\nreason for putting me at Court.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 1855, the Coalition Government of Lord Aberdeen\r\nand Lord John Russell resigned, being defeated on a vote of\r\ncensure charging them with mismanagement of the Crimean War. Lord\r\nPalmerston received the commands of Queen Victoria to form an\r\nAdministration. He, too, desired to have a Ministry of both Liberals\r\nand Conservatives. On February 7th he wrote to Ashley—now the Earl\r\nof Shaftesbury and a Conservative—offering him the Chancellorship\r\nof the Duchy of Lancaster with a seat in the Cabinet. That was in\r\nthe morning. In the afternoon Shaftesbury received a brief note from\r\nPalmerston requesting him to “consider the offer as suspended,”\r\nin consequence of unforeseen difficulties, which, it subsequently\r\ntranspired, were the claims of the Liberals for a greater share\r\nof place and power in the new Government. This explanation came\r\nto Shaftesbury from Lady Palmerston. “Palmerston is distracted\r\nwith all the worry he has to go through,” she wrote. In a P.S. she\r\nadded: “It is no pleasure to form a Government when there are so\r\nmany unreasonable people to please, and so many interested people\r\npressing for their own gratification and vanity, without any regard\r\nto the public good or the interests of the Government and country.”\r\nShaftesbury thus poured out his virtuously indignant soul on the\r\nsubject to his son: “The selfishness, the meanness, the love of place\r\nand salary, the oblivion of the country, of man’s welfare and God’s\r\nhonour, have never been more striking and terrible than in this\r\ncrisis. These, added to the singular conceit of all the candidates\r\nfor office (and all have aspired to the highest), have thrown\r\nstumbling-blocks in Palmerston’s path at every step. The greediness\r\nand vanity of our place-hunters have combined to make each one of\r\nthem a union of the vulture and the peacock.”\r\n\r\nShaftesbury declares that he had then no desire for place; and it\r\nis impossible to doubt the genuineness of the thanksgiving on his\r\n“escape from office” in which he indulges. A month later some of\r\nthe Members of the Administration resigned, and Palmerston again\r\noffered Shaftesbury the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster.\r\nBut Shaftesbury was still reluctant. “I could not satisfy myself,”\r\nhe says, “that to accept office was a Divine call. I was satisfied\r\nthat God had called me to labour among the poor.” However, one\r\nmorning he received this note from Lady Palmerston: “Palmerston is\r\nvery anxious now that you should put on your undress uniform and be\r\nat the Palace a quarter before three to be sworn in. Pray do this,\r\nand I am sure you will not repent it.” Shaftesbury gave way to these\r\npleading entreaties. The result was certainly curious. “I went and\r\ndressed,” he writes in his _Diary_, “and then, while I was waiting\r\nfor the carriage, I went down on my knees and prayed for counsel,\r\nwisdom and understanding. Then there was someone at the door, as\r\nI thought to say that the carriage was ready. But instead of that\r\na note, hurriedly written in pencil, was put into my hand. It was\r\nfrom Palmerston—‘Don’t go to the Palace.’” Many would have groaned\r\nin the anguish of their souls over this crowning disappointment.\r\nShaftesbury declares he danced with joy. “It was to my mind,” he\r\nsays, “as distinctly an act of special Providence as when the hand\r\nof Abraham was stayed and Isaac escaped.” Palmerston’s sudden change\r\nof mind is no doubt accounted for in a passage which I find in the\r\n_Autobiography_ of the eighth Duke of Argyll, who was a member of\r\nPalmerston’s Cabinet. He states that one day Palmerston astonished\r\nall his colleagues by proposing that Lord Shaftesbury should be\r\none of their number. “I was far too fond of Shaftesbury, and had\r\nmuch too great a respect for him to say one word in opposition,”\r\nArgyll writes; “but I saw that it rather took away the breath from\r\na good many of my colleagues. His fervid nature, his uncompromising\r\ntemperament, and his somewhat individual opinions were evidently not\r\nconsidered as promising well for united councils. My opinion, which,\r\nhowever, I kept to myself, was that he was a far more valuable man\r\nout of office than in it.” Argyll adds: “Palmerston evidently saw\r\nthat the proposal was not very well received, and we heard nothing\r\nmore of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIn July 1886 Henry Cecil Raikes, a distinguished Conservative\r\nM.P., awaited, with hope and misgiving alternating in his breast,\r\na letter from Lord Salisbury—then engaged in forming his first\r\nUnionist Administration—inviting him to join the Cabinet. As the\r\nlist of Ministerial appointments announced in the Press grew towards\r\ncompletion, and nothing was heard from the Prime Minister, the fear\r\ngrew upon him that he was about to be shelved. But he had staunch\r\nfriends at the Carlton Club, and they took the unusual course of\r\naddressing a “round-robin” to Salisbury, earnestly requesting him not\r\nto forget “the long and arduous services to the Party” of Henry Cecil\r\nRaikes. A day or two later Raikes received the following letter from\r\nthe Prime Minister:\r\n\r\n                                   20 ARLINGTON STREET, S.W.,\r\n                                                      _July 28, 1886_.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR RAIKES,\r\n\r\n  Are you disposed to join us as Postmaster-General? I am very\r\n  anxious to meet your views. I wish I was in a position to do so\r\n  more fully. But that is a species of regret which clogs me at every\r\n  step of the arduous task in which I am engaged. I shall be very\r\n  glad if we are able to persuade you to associate yourself with\r\n  us—for the present in this office.\r\n\r\n                                    Believe me, yours very truly,\r\n                                                            SALISBURY.\r\n\r\nOnly the minor post of Postmaster-General, when he had expected the\r\nHome Office, which carries a seat in the Cabinet! But to refuse an\r\noffer of office because it does not come up to one’s expectations\r\noften means the exclusion from office for ever. Raikes accordingly\r\ndecided to take the post of Postmaster-General. “He fully recognized\r\nthe difficulties of his chief’s position,” writes his son and\r\nbiographer, “and, of course, was not blind to the fact that if he\r\nwere to refuse this office he would probably be throwing away the\r\nsubstance for the shadow, and would cut himself off from any but a\r\nremote chance of future advancement.” It is not every politician who\r\nhas had an offer of an office which was less than he expected that\r\ncan follow the example of Henry Brougham, who contemptuously tore\r\nup the letter of Earl Grey offering him the post of Attorney-General\r\nin the first Reform Administration. Brougham wanted the Lord\r\nChancellorship, and would not be put off with anything else; and\r\nthough Grey was reluctant to trust Brougham in so exalted a post,\r\nBrougham had his way, for he was in the strong position of being\r\nindispensable to the new Government, not only in his own estimation,\r\nwhich did not so much matter, but also in the estimation of many\r\nleading Whigs, which did. But Raikes knew that he could be done\r\nwithout, and, sensible man, he accepted what was offered. Naturally\r\nhe was mortified that the Secretaryship of State for the Home\r\nDepartment was carried off by an entirely outside and unsuspected\r\nrival, Henry Matthews (afterwards Lord Llandaff), who was discovered\r\nin the Law Courts as a powerful advocate and pleader by Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nIs there anything more poignant in the history of the making of\r\nGovernments than the entreaty addressed by Benjamin Disraeli to\r\nSir Robert Peel, in 1841, that he should not be forgotten in the\r\ndistribution of the offices in the Tory Administration which was then\r\nbeing formed? Writing from Grosvenor Gate on September 5, 1841, and\r\naddressing “Dear Sir Robert,” Disraeli said he should not dwell upon\r\nhis services to the Tory Party, though since 1834 he had fought four\r\ncontests, expended large sums of money, and exerted his intelligence\r\nto the utmost for the propagation of Peel’s policy. He adds: “But\r\nthere is one peculiarity in my case on which I cannot be silent. I\r\nhave had to struggle against a storm of political hate and malice,\r\nwhich few men ever experienced, from the moment—at the instigation\r\nof a member of your Cabinet—I enrolled myself under your banner,\r\nand I have only been sustained under these trials by the conviction\r\nthat the day would come when the foremost man of this country would\r\npublicly testify that he had some respect for my ability and my\r\ncharacter.” Then, throwing all reserve aside, he ends his letter\r\nwith the following outburst of genuine feeling: “I confess to be\r\nunrecognized at this moment by you appears to me to be overwhelming,\r\nand I appeal to your own heart—to that justice and magnanimity which\r\nI feel are your characteristics—to save me from an intolerable\r\nhumiliation.”\r\n\r\nThe same post brought the Prime Minister a most appealing letter\r\nsigned, “Mary Anne Disraeli,” addressed “Dear Sir Robert Peel,” and\r\nmarked “Confidential.” She begins: “I beg you not to be angry with\r\nme for my intrusion, but I am overwhelmed with anxiety. My husband’s\r\npolitical career is for ever crushed if you do not appreciate him.\r\nMr. Disraeli’s exertions are not unknown to you; but there is much he\r\nhas done that you cannot be aware of, though they have no other aim\r\nbut to do you honour, no wish for recompense, but your approbation.”\r\nHer husband had made Peel’s opponents his personal enemies, she goes\r\non; he had stood four expensive elections since 1834. “Literature,”\r\nshe concludes, “he has abandoned for politics. Do not destroy all his\r\nhopes, and make him feel his life has been a mistake.”\r\n\r\nPeel’s reply was cold and formal. He disliked Disraeli, regarding\r\nhim as a political adventurer, and disliked him personally. “My\r\ndear sir,” he addresses him, and, fastening on the statement that\r\nDisraeli had joined the Tory Party at the instigation of a member\r\nof Peel’s former Cabinet, he declares that no one had ever got from\r\nhim the slightest authority to make such a communication. Then Peel\r\ngives a remarkable account of the difficulties which beset him in\r\nconstituting the new Government:\r\n\r\n  But, quite independently of this consideration, I should have been\r\n  very happy, had it been in my power, to avail myself of your offer\r\n  of service; and your letter is one of the many I receive which too\r\n  forcibly impress upon me how painful and invidious is the duty\r\n  which I have been compelled to undertake. I am only supported in it\r\n  by the consciousness that my desire has been to do justice.\r\n\r\n  I trust, also, that when candidates for parliamentary office calmly\r\n  reflect on my position, and the appointments I have made—when they\r\n  review the names of those previously connected with me in public\r\n  life whom I have been absolutely compelled to exclude, the claims\r\n  founded on acceptance in 1834 with the almost hopeless prospects\r\n  of that day, the claims, too, founded on new Party combinations—I\r\n  trust they will then understand how perfectly insufficient are\r\n  the means at my disposal to meet the wishes that are conveyed to\r\n  me by men whose co-operation I should be proud to have and whose\r\n  qualifications and pretensions for office I do not contest.\r\n\r\nDisraeli, writing from Grosvenor Gate, September 8, 1841, hastens to\r\nexplain that he never intended to even suggest, much less to say,\r\nthat a promise of official promotion had ever been made to him at\r\nany time by any member of Peel’s Cabinet. “Parliamentary office,” he\r\nsays, “should be the recognition of Party services and parliamentary\r\nability, and as such only was it to me an object of ambition.” He\r\nends with a dignified touch of pathos: “If such a pledge had been\r\ngiven me by yourself, and not redeemed, I should have taken refuge in\r\nsilence. Not to be appreciated may be mortification; to be baulked\r\nof a promised reward is only a vulgar accident of life, to be borne\r\nwithout a murmur.”\r\n\r\nFive years passed, and in the debate on the third reading of the\r\nBill for the repeal of the Corn Duties, Disraeli, from the back\r\nMinisterial benches, made a scathing attack upon Peel and what he\r\ncalled his betrayal of the Tory Party in bringing in such a Bill to\r\nestablish Free Trade. The Prime Minister, in reply, disclosed to the\r\ncountry the curious incidents of 1841. “It is still more surprising,”\r\nsaid he, “that if such were the hon. gentleman’s views of my\r\ncharacter he should have been ready, as I think he was, to unite his\r\nfortunes with mine in office, thereby implying the strongest proof\r\nwhich a public man can give of confidence in the honour and integrity\r\nof a Minister of the Crown.” Disraeli rose at once to make a personal\r\nexplanation. He denied that his opposition to the Free Trade policy\r\nof the Prime Minister was inspired by his disappointment of office.\r\nHe was not an applicant for office in 1841. “I never shall—it is\r\ntotally foreign to my nature—make an application for any place,” he\r\ncried. “Whatever occurred in 1841 between the right hon. gentleman\r\nand myself,” said he, “was entirely attributable to the intervention\r\nof another gentleman, whom I supposed to be in the confidence of\r\nthe right hon. baronet, and I daresay it may have arisen from a\r\nmisconception.” The correspondence which I have quoted was not\r\npublished until long afterwards. The abrupt ending of the incident\r\nin the House of Commons is strange in the light thrown upon it by\r\nthe correspondence. According to the report in _Hansard_, Peel made\r\nno reply to Disraeli. Peel held the correspondence in his hands, and\r\nresisted the temptation to read it and crush Disraeli, because he was\r\nadvised by one of his colleagues that the disclosure of a private\r\napplication for office would be contrary to the high and honourable\r\ntraditions of statesmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nGladstone agreed with Peel that it was not advisable to put a man\r\ninto the Cabinet without a previous official training. It was also\r\nGladstone’s custom, once he had invited a man to office, to hold on\r\nto him to the last possible moment. “The next most serious thing to\r\nadmitting a man into the Cabinet,” said he, mentioning one of the\r\nprinciples which guided him in the making of a Government, “is to\r\nleave a man out who has once been in.” Still, there were occasions\r\nwhen he was compelled to pass over an old comrade-in-arms on the\r\nground of age. He was himself seventy-one years of age when, in 1880,\r\nhe was called upon to form his second Government. To one old member\r\nof his former Administration he wrote: “I do not feel able to ask\r\nyou to resume the toils of office.” He admitted that he himself was\r\n“the oldest man of his political generation,” and that, therefore,\r\nhe should be a solecism in the Government which he was engaged in\r\nconstructing. “I have been brought,” he added, “by the seeming force\r\nof exceptional circumstances to undertake a task requiring less of\r\nyears and more of vigour than my accumulating store of the one and\r\nwaning residue of the other.” Here we have the answer to the question\r\nof age and office. The exclusion of a veteran politician from office\r\nis not a matter of the number of years he has counted. Is he an\r\nextinct political volcano as well as an old man? May he safely be\r\nset aside? On the answer which the Prime Minister gives to these\r\nquestions in his own mind depends the fate of the office-seeker of\r\nadvanced years. Gladstone was eighty-four in 1893, but he was still\r\ninevitable as Prime Minister. If the strong young man of achievement,\r\nand still greater promise, cannot be ignored, neither can the old\r\nman, who, having built up a commanding reputation, takes care that it\r\nis duly and fittingly recognized.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular thing that, among the twelve hundred men or so who\r\nconstitute the two Houses of Parliament, there has never been any\r\nreluctance to take office. Probably the only instance of a public\r\nman who had a positive repugnance of office was Lord Althorp, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons in the\r\nGrey and Melbourne Administrations from November 1830 to December\r\n1834. Office destroyed all his happiness, he declared, and so\r\naffected his mind that he had to remove his pistols from his bedroom\r\nlest he should be tempted to shoot himself. He remained in office\r\nbecause he felt that one in his rank and position—born, as it were,\r\nto the purple, a member of one of the great territorial families,\r\nwho boast of long lines of ancestors in the public service—could no\r\nmore set aside the responsibility of office than the earldom and\r\nbroad acres of which he was also the heir. The one consolation he\r\nderived from the death of his brother, Earl Spencer, was that his own\r\naccession to the House of Lords compelled him to lay down the burden\r\nof Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir George Cornewall Lewis seems to\r\nhave been animated by somewhat the same uncommonly high sense of\r\nduty. When Palmerston, in the forming of his Administration in 1855,\r\noffered him the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer which Gladstone\r\nhad vacated, he says he entertained the strongest disinclination\r\nto accept the office. “I felt, however,” he writes, “that in the\r\npeculiar position of the Government”—they were in difficulties over\r\nthe Crimean War—“refusal was scarcely honourable, and would be\r\nattributable to cowardice, and I therefore, most reluctantly, made up\r\nmy mind to accept it.”\r\n\r\nBut these cases of objection to office on the part of public men,\r\nhowever wealthy or however old, are exceedingly rare. The hunt for\r\nposts when a new Government is being formed after a dissolution\r\nis eager and untiring. The old men, who will not admit that\r\ntheir weight of years unfits them for the cares of office, haunt\r\nthe political clubs and Downing Street, so as to keep themselves\r\nconspicuous in the eyes of the new Prime Minister. But they cannot\r\nall get “jobs,” to use a word commonly employed while a Government\r\nis being made. Some of them must be sacrificed; there are so many\r\nable and pushful young men to be provided for. The same cry is\r\nheard in politics as in other walks of life: “Why should these old\r\nfellows lag superfluous on the stage?” But “the old gang”—as they are\r\ncalled by the young—will not retire from public life voluntarily and\r\ngracefully. It is not alone that they instinctively revolt against\r\nthe assumption that their capacity for work is at an end, but they\r\nalso dislike change of habits and pursuits, and, above all, they\r\ndesire for a little longer to play a leading part on the prominent\r\nstage of Parliament. Public life, therefore, retires from them. It is\r\nonly the few who have made a great reputation and acquired a great\r\nauthority that cannot lightly be set aside. For most politicians, no\r\nmatter how fine their services in the past, a time comes when they\r\nare designated “old fogeys,” and, while still anxious to be once more\r\nMinisters of the Crown, they experience the humiliation, as they look\r\nupon it, of being shunted for ever. It is idle to talk of acquiescing\r\npatiently in the inevitable. Political history affords many a sad\r\ninstance of such a fate being regarded as one of the sorest of the\r\ninjustices of life.\r\n\r\nThe young and pushful have their disappointments and vexations also.\r\nDisraeli—according to Buckle, his biographer—having completed his\r\nAdministration in 1874, wrote to a lady friend: “I have contrived in\r\nthe minor and working places to include every representative man,\r\nthat is to say, everyone who might be troublesome—all those sort\r\nof men who would have made a Tory cave.” He adds: “There are some\r\nterrible disappointments, but I have written soothing letters, which,\r\non the whole, have not been without success.” But not altogether.\r\nFor in another letter, written in 1876, Disraeli says that at a\r\ndinner party he met Lord Randolph Churchill—“he glaring like one\r\npossessed of a devil, and quite uncivil when I addressed him rather\r\ncordially.” “Why?” he asks, and answering, he says it was perhaps\r\nthat “I gave the lordship of the Treasury to Crichton instead of\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nThe making of a Government may be completed in a week if all goes\r\nwell. Should there be difficulties in reconciling the claims of\r\ninfluential rivals for particular offices, it may extend over a\r\nfortnight. And what does it all signify to the people or nation?\r\nCharles Dickens was disposed to take an ironic view of the matter,\r\nif we judge from some passages in _Bleak House_. “The limited choice\r\nof the Crown,” he writes, “in the formation of a new Ministry would\r\nlie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle, supposing it to be\r\nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be\r\nassumed to be the case, in consequence of the breach arising out\r\nof that affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and\r\nthe Leadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to\r\nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,\r\nwhat are you to do with Noodle? You can’t offer the Presidency of the\r\nCouncil. That is reserved for Poodle. You can’t put him in the Woods\r\nand Forests. That is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What follows?\r\nThat the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces because you\r\ncan’t provide for Noodle!” That, however, does not quite settle the\r\nmatter. May it not be said, rather—Happy country which has so many\r\nable and honest men striving for the opportunity of toiling in its\r\nservice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE KING AND HIS MINISTERS AND THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe list of the proposed Administration is submitted by the Prime\r\nMinister to the King for approval. Constitutionally, the Sovereign\r\nhas the right of veto, and may require any of the Ministerial\r\nappointments to be cancelled. This prerogative is now rarely, if\r\never, enforced. So far as is known, Queen Victoria was the last\r\nSovereign to raise objections to certain of the names proposed to\r\nher. When Gladstone was forming his Government in 1880, she wished\r\nfor Lord Hartington at the War Office, in place of Mr. Childers; but\r\nshe was induced to give way. It was said in 1893, when Gladstone\r\nwas again forming an Administration, that Henry Labouchere was not\r\nincluded solely because Queen Victoria refused her sanction. In the\r\nremoter past there are instances of the Sovereign not merely vetoing\r\nan appointment, but also of making one. But when George IV attempted\r\nto appoint Herries in 1827 Chancellor of the Exchequer, objection was\r\nsuccessfully maintained. By modern usage, therefore, the position\r\nmay be said to be that the Sovereign has the right to veto an\r\nappointment, but not to make one.\r\n\r\nThe Administration having been completely formed, a day is appointed\r\nby the King for taking leave of the outgoing Ministers, and receiving\r\nthe incoming Ministers, at meetings of the Privy Council. The\r\ncustomary procedure is for the Clerk of the Council to collect all\r\nthe seals of office from the various Departments beforehand and take\r\nthem to Buckingham Palace for the ceremony. Only certain Ministers\r\nhold seals as insignia of office. The retiring Prime Minister has no\r\nseal to hand over, even though he may also hold, as he usually does,\r\nthe office of First Lord of the Treasury; and therefore the new Prime\r\nMinister has none to receive. The Ministers having seals of office\r\nare the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Privy Seal, the five Secretaries\r\nof State—Home Department, Foreign Affairs, Colonies, War, and India\r\n(all of whom are constitutionally of co-equal and co-ordinate\r\nauthority, and fully authorized to transact, if need be, each other’s\r\nbusiness)—the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chancellor of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster, and the Secretary for Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe seals of office are sets of three seals, each made of metal,\r\nknown respectively as the signet, the smaller seal, and the cachet.\r\nIt is only at the Foreign Office that full use is made of the\r\nthree. The signet is affixed to instruments for the ratification of\r\ntreaties. The smaller seal is used for Royal Warrants countersigned\r\nby the Secretary. The cachet is used for the purpose of sealing\r\nletters sent by the King to Foreign Sovereigns on matters of State.\r\nTwo seals only are used at the Colonial Office, the signet and the\r\nsmaller seal; while at the Home Office and the India Office the\r\nsmaller seal is used for all purposes. All the seals bear the Royal\r\nArms, but have no image or device appropriate to the office of which\r\neach is the symbol. Each Minister receives the seals of his office\r\nenclosed in a velvet case from the King. No doubt curiosity impels\r\nhim to examine the seals on that great day when he enters office, but\r\nhe probably never sees them again until that other notable day when\r\nhe quits office by handing the seals back to the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe outgoing Ministers are first received by the King in the Council\r\nChamber. The seals being sorted out, each Minister takes his and\r\ndelivers it up to the King, thereby relinquishing his office.\r\nMinisters without seals resign office by formally taking leave of the\r\nKing. Later on, the new Ministers arrive at the Palace. The second\r\nCouncil is then held. The first thing done is to administer the\r\nPrivy Councillor’s oath to such Cabinet Ministers as are not yet\r\nmembers of the Privy Council. Each swears to be “a true and faithful\r\nservant unto the King’s Majesty,” and to reveal it to his Majesty\r\nshould he come to know of “any manner of thing to be attempted, done\r\nor spoken, against his Person, Honour, Crown, or Dignity Royal,”\r\nand then proceeds to take a further oath upon which the secrecy of\r\nCabinet proceedings rests. The passage is as follows:\r\n\r\n  You shall, in all things to be moved, treated and debated in\r\n  Council, faithfully and truly declare your Mind and Opinion\r\n  according to your Heart and Conscience; and shall keep secret all\r\n  Matters committed and revealed unto you, or that shall be treated\r\n  of secretly in Council. And if any of the said Treaties or Councils\r\n  shall touch any of the Counsellors, you shall not reveal it unto\r\n  him, but shall keep the same until such time as, by the Consent of\r\n  his Majesty, or of the Council, Publication shall be made thereof.\r\n\r\nThe oath winds up, “So help you God and the Holy contents of this\r\nbook,” though by an Act of 1889 affirmation may be substituted for\r\nthe oath.\r\n\r\nDisraeli, who knew something about the formation of Ministries,\r\nhas described the antithesis of the Ministry of All the Talents,\r\nin his novel _Endymion_, as the Ministry of Untried Men. There is\r\nmuch fact and some fiction in the description. The Ministry was the\r\none formed by Lord Derby in 1852, with Disraeli himself in it as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. Derby, leader of the Protectionists,\r\nseemed to have a difficult task, for, barring himself, there was no\r\none to choose who had already held office. The task, Disraeli tells\r\nus, was accomplished in this way: “A dozen men without the slightest\r\nexperience of official life had to be sworn in as Privy Councillors\r\nbefore they could receive the seals and insignia of their intended\r\noffices. On their knees, according to official custom, a dozen\r\nmen, all in the act of genuflexion at the same moment, and headed,\r\ntoo, by one of the most powerful peers in the country, the Lord of\r\nAlnwick Castle himself, humbled themselves before a female Sovereign,\r\nwho looked serene and imperturbable before a spectacle never seen\r\nbefore, and which in all probability will never be seen again. One\r\nof the band, a gentleman without any experience whatever, was not\r\nonly placed in the Cabinet, but was absolutely required to become\r\nthe Leader of the House of Commons, which had never occurred before,\r\nexcept in the instance of Mr. Pitt in 1782.” Lord Beaconsfield’s\r\nconfession, it is well to recall, appeared after his final\r\ndisappearance from the political scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole Cabinet has thus qualified for admission to the Privy\r\nCouncil, his Majesty declares Lord President of the Council the\r\nMinister appointed to that office, who thereupon takes the oath to\r\n“well and truly serve his Majesty,” and kisses his Majesty’s hand.\r\nThe other Ministers take a similar oath in due order, beginning with\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, who receives the Great Seal, followed by the\r\nPrime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury; and those who are\r\nentitled to seals receive them from the King, while the others kiss\r\nhis Majesty’s hand in acceptance of office. Thus does the Sovereign\r\nratify the selections of the Prime Minister for the various posts in\r\nthe Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nLord Campbell relates in his _Diary_ that in 1859, as the members\r\nof the Palmerston Administration, in which he held the office of\r\nLord Chancellor, were going down to Windsor by special train, they\r\npassed another express returning to London with the outgoing Premier,\r\nLord Derby, and his colleagues. What an opening for aspiring young\r\nstatesmen if a wicked wag of a railway director had ordered the two\r\ntrains to be put on the same line, was the genial comment of the\r\nLord Chancellor! Sir Stafford Northcote, who was a Minister in the\r\nnext Derby Administration, formed in July 1866, also gives some\r\ninteresting glimpses of the proceedings associated with a change of\r\nGovernment. He writes: “Queen’s carriages met us at the terminus\r\nand took us to Windsor Castle. As we went upstairs we met the late\r\nMinisters coming down, and shook hands with them. While we were\r\nwaiting in the long room there was a sharp thunderstorm, and there\r\nwas another while we were at luncheon, after taking office. The\r\nslopes of the Terrace looked as if there had been a fall of snow.\r\nSome thought this a bad omen for us. Disraeli had a bad omen of his\r\nown as we came down, for, thinking there was a seat at the end of the\r\nsaloon carriage, he sat down there, and found himself unexpectedly\r\non the floor.” This Administration lasted scarcely two years;\r\nbut, despite the ill-omened accident to Disraeli, it was for that\r\nstatesman a fortunate Administration. In it he first filled the great\r\noffice of Prime Minister, to which he succeeded on the resignation of\r\nLord Derby, on account of failing health, early in 1868.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Windsor Castle. Sir Stafford Northcote goes on to\r\nsay: “Lord Derby was first sent for by the Queen, and had a short\r\naudience. We were then all taken along the corridor to the door\r\nof a small room, or, rather, closet. Lord Derby, Lord Chelmsford,\r\nand Walpole were called in; then the five new members of the Privy\r\nCouncil—Duke of Buckingham, Carnarvon, Cranborne, Hardy, and I—were\r\ncalled in together, and knelt before the Queen while we took the\r\noath of allegiance; then we kissed hands, rose, and took the Privy\r\nCouncillor’s oath standing. The Queen then named the Duke of\r\nBuckingham Lord President of the Council, and we all retired. The\r\nPrince of Wales and Duke of Edinburgh were in the room. We were then\r\ncalled in one by one and kissed hands on appointment to office, Lord\r\nDerby going first, then the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President,\r\nthe Lord Privy Seal, the Secretaries of State (all together), the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, etc. The seals were delivered to all\r\nthese, except the Lord President. Lord Derby then had a long audience\r\nwith the Queen, while we went to luncheon. Returned by special\r\ntrain at four o’clock.” John Bright was the only Minister who, so\r\nfar as I know, was relieved of the obligation to kneel and kiss the\r\nSovereign’s hands on receiving the seals of office. When he went to\r\nWindsor on his appointment as President of the Board of Trade, Queen\r\nVictoria, a great admirer of his speeches, sent Helps, Clerk to the\r\nPrivy Council, to tell Bright she would dispense with the ceremony if\r\nthat was more agreeable to his feelings as a Quaker, and he availed\r\nhimself of this “considerate permission,” as he regarded it.\r\n\r\nHow a Minister (Henry Chaplin, afterwards Lord Chaplin) held the\r\nseals of the Secretary of State for War, for the briefest period\r\npossible, is mentioned in the diary of Lord Cranbrook, when he enters\r\nthe visit to Windsor of the Conservative Ministry of 1885 upon taking\r\noffice. “There was no contretemps but the careless omission of the\r\nkissing hands by Northcote, which was soon set right; and her Majesty\r\ngave Chaplin the War Office seals by mistake, easily rectified.\r\nStill, there should be some distinctive mark on each set.”\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nBut all is not over yet. A Member of the House of Commons who accepts\r\nan office of profit under the Crown thereby vacates his seat, and\r\nmust seek re-election. This applies to the heads of all the great\r\nDepartments. Minor Ministerial posts, such as the Secretary to the\r\nTreasury, the Under-Secretaries of State, the Parliamentary and\r\nFinancial Secretaries of various Departments, are exempted from\r\nthis parliamentary law, as they are regarded as holding office not\r\nby appointment of the Crown, but by appointment of the Ministers\r\nin charge of the different offices. The object of compelling a\r\nMinister to submit his acceptance of office to the judgment of his\r\nconstituents, which was first established by an Act of the reign\r\nof Queen Anne—Succession to the Crown Act, 1707—was to restrain\r\nthe corrupt influence of the Crown over Parliament by its power of\r\nconferring place on servile and obsequious Members. The danger the\r\nstatute was designed to avert has, happily, past long since and\r\ngone for ever. The Act of Anne, however, continues in operation\r\ndespite the fact that, owing to the complete revolution which has\r\nsince been effected in the Constitution, it is entirely remote from\r\nthe realities of these democratic times. The only modification\r\nof the original Act is a provision in the Reform Act of 1867, by\r\nwhich a Minister who is transferred to another office “in lieu of\r\nand in immediate succession the one to the other” need not submit\r\nhimself to his constituents. A constitutional difficulty arose on\r\nthe taking over of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer by Gladstone\r\non the resignation of Lowe in 1873, during a parliamentary recess,\r\nGladstone at the time being First Lord of the Treasury and Prime\r\nMinister. Did the right hon. gentleman come under the provision of\r\nthe Act of 1867, and therefore not obliged to seek re-election? The\r\nlaw officers of the Crown—Coleridge, Attorney-General, and Jessel,\r\nSolicitor-General—came to the conclusion that the seat was not\r\nvacated; and their opinion was supported by Sir Erskine May, Clerk\r\nof the House of Commons. On the other hand, Lord Chancellor Selborne\r\nadvanced the opposite view, holding that, as Gladstone had taken\r\nthe office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, not in lieu of and in\r\nimmediate succession to, but in addition to, the office of First Lord\r\nof the Treasury, he must submit himself to his constituents. But this\r\nGladstone was reluctant to do, as his seat for Greenwich was believed\r\nto be unsafe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Conservative Opposition sought to make the situation\r\nmore embarrassing for the Government. The Speaker is not empowered\r\nto issue his warrant for a new election during the Recess in the\r\nroom of any Member who since the Prorogation has accepted any office\r\nwhereby he has vacated his seat, unless on receipt of a certificate\r\nfrom two Members and a notification from the Member himself of the\r\nfact of such acceptance of office. What happened in this particular\r\ncase is thus described by John Morley in his _Life of Gladstone_:\r\n“The unslumbering instinct of Party had quickly got upon a scent, and\r\ntwo keen-nosed sleuth-hounds of the Opposition, four or five weeks\r\nafter Mr. Gladstone had taken the seals of the Exchequer, sent to\r\nthe Speaker a certificate in the usual form, stating a vacancy at\r\nGreenwich, and requesting him to issue a writ for a new election. The\r\nSpeaker reminded them, in reply, that the issue of writs during the\r\nrecess in cases of acceptance of office required notification to him\r\nfrom the Member accepting, and he had received no such notification.”\r\nIn the midst of the controversy Parliament was dissolved, and with it\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nGovernments have tried to repeal the statute of Queen Anne. Arthur\r\nBalfour, who thought the law not only antiquated, but inimical to\r\ngood government, once, when Prime Minister, brought in a Bill to\r\nabolish it. “I remember in my early days,” said he, in the session\r\nof 1905, “the Party to which I belong—it was in 1880—derived\r\ninfinite enjoyment from the satisfaction of turning the late Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt out of his seat at Oxford on his taking office as\r\nHome Secretary. He found a seat after considerable inconvenience\r\nto Mr. Gladstone’s Government; and in my opinion, although it gave\r\nus great satisfaction as a good practical joke, it was a severe\r\ncondemnation of the system on which we now carry on business, and\r\nwhich no practical assembly in the world but our own would tolerate\r\nfor an instant.” Balfour failed, however, to get the House of Commons\r\nto agree to his Bill. I have heard several debates on the subject.\r\nThe chief argument of the Treasury Bench for the repeal of the Act\r\nwas that by reason of it no Prime Minister has ever been able to\r\nexercise a really free choice in the selection of his colleagues in\r\nthe Administration; for often he has had to put a square man into\r\na round hole, because the round man that would fit the round hole\r\nadmirably held an unsafe seat, and therefore might not be re-elected.\r\nBut the view of the back benches always has been that the Act\r\nsupports the control of the House over the Government, and gives to\r\nthe constituency the opportunity of expressing its opinion as to the\r\naction of its representative in accepting office under the Crown.\r\nThis view has always prevailed. During the Great War the principle\r\nwas twice suspended by emergency Acts. Members who accepted office\r\nin the two Coalition Governments of the War—one under Asquith in May\r\nand June 1915, and the other under Lloyd George in December 1916 and\r\nJanuary 1917—were expressly absolved from the necessity of seeking\r\nre-election. But when the second Coalition Government, after the\r\nGeneral Election of December 1918, submitted to the new Parliament,\r\nas their first measure, a Bill to repeal the statute of Queen Anne,\r\nfeeling against it was very strong, and all that the House of Commons\r\nwould assent to was to suspend for nine months the obligation on\r\nMembers to go to their constituencies on the acceptance of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nWith the re-election of the Ministers the work is at an end.\r\nThe Administration has been duly constituted, according to\r\nlong-established custom. However smoothly and rapidly it may have\r\nprogressed, there are certain to be many sore hearts—those of the\r\nyoung with disappointed hopes, and, more pathetic still, those of the\r\nold, who are deemed to be no longer fit for office. But what of the\r\noutgoing Ministers? They no longer carry out of office the little\r\nperquisites which were permitted to some of their predecessors. At\r\none time each Secretary of State, for instance, received on his\r\nappointment a silver inkstand, which he could retain and hand down\r\nas a keepsake to his children; but Gladstone, when Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, abolished this custom, and the only souvenir of office an\r\noutgoing Minister can take with him now is the red despatch box in\r\nwhich he used to carry his official papers to the House of Commons.\r\nHow do they take their dismissal by the country? “There are two\r\nsupreme political pleasures in life,” says Lord Rosebery. “One is\r\nideal, the other real. The ideal is when a man receives the seals of\r\noffice from the hands of his Sovereign; the real, when he hands them\r\nback.” It is the saying of a man who was sick and tired of office.\r\nBut I beg leave to doubt its general application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nOFFICE AND ITS SPOILS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWhy do every Government cling so tenaciously to the responsibility\r\nand drudgery of office? Wherefore the feverish eagerness of every\r\nOpposition to take the burdens of the Empire upon their shoulders?\r\nDo the “Spoils of Office” account for the great trouble there always\r\nis in compelling the “ins” to get out, and the little persuasion\r\nnecessary to induce the “outs” to come in? Surely here is a matter of\r\nhigh public interest, which is well worth investigation.\r\n\r\nThe salaries of most of the chief offices of the Ministry were\r\nsettled at their present figures by an arrangement made so long ago\r\nas 1831. During the Administration of Earl Grey (better known as the\r\nReform Ministry) fixed incomes of £5,000 a year for the Secretaries\r\nof State, and £2,000 a year for the Presidents of Boards were agreed\r\nto on the recommendation of a Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons. In 1850 the emoluments of office were again reviewed by\r\na Select Committee, and they reported in favour of the retention,\r\npractically, of the 1831 settlement. Included in this Committee of\r\nfifteen members were such rigid economists as Molesworth, Cobden,\r\nBright, and Ricardo, who grudged almost every penny spent for\r\nState purposes. “For these offices,” they said in their report,\r\n“it is requisite to secure the services of men who combine the\r\nhighest talents with the greatest experience in public affairs; and\r\nconsidering the rank and importance of the offices and the labour and\r\nresponsibility incurred by those who hold them, your Committee are\r\nof opinion that the salaries of these officers were settled in 1831\r\nat the lowest amount consistent with the requirements of the public\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nThe differences in the emoluments of the more important offices of\r\nCabinet rank have been a source of embarrassment to many a Prime\r\nMinister engaged in forming a Government. It has often happened\r\nthat a man offered a post with the lower salary has considered\r\nhimself slighted by his political chief. To give one conspicuous\r\ninstance, the appointment of Joseph Chamberlain to the Board of\r\nTrade by Gladstone in 1880 was resented by the Radicals, if not by\r\nChamberlain himself, as a belittling of his services and abilities.\r\nThis feeling did not tend to the harmony of the inner councils of the\r\nLiberal Government; and yet the only foundation for it was that the\r\nPresidency of the Board of Trade had only £2,000 a year as compared\r\nwith the £5,000 of a Secretary of State, for intrinsically it was a\r\nhigh and important office.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the Cabinet Ministers of the first War Coalition Government,\r\nunder Asquith, decided to put their varying salaries, big and little,\r\ninto a common fund, and then divide the amount equally among all.\r\nThe “pooling” was entirely novel. Its purpose was to mitigate the\r\npersonal hardship caused to certain Ministers who, in the reshuffle\r\nof offices necessary in order to include Unionists in the Coalition\r\nGovernment, had their emoluments reduced, or else to afford a salve\r\nto their offended dignity. To give one example, so distinguished a\r\nMinister as Winston Churchill would otherwise have lost £2,500 a\r\nyear by his transfer from the office of First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\npaid £4,500, to the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,\r\npaid £2,000. But the general effect of this adoption by the combined\r\nLiberals and Unionists in the Cabinet of the trade union principle\r\nof paying one rate of wages, was to more than double the salaries of\r\nsome Ministers, and more than half the salaries of others. The sum\r\nthat each received was £2,446. The chief sacrifices were made by the\r\nLord Chancellor, whose salary is £10,000, and the Attorney-General,\r\nwhose salary, exclusive of fees, is £7,000. The Prime Minister’s\r\nsalary was excluded from the pool. In the House of Commons the\r\narrangement was criticized on the ground that it was come to “behind\r\nthe back of Parliament,” and altered the remuneration of Ministers\r\nwhich Parliament had sanctioned. Mr. Asquith strongly deprecated the\r\ndiscussion. He absolutely declined to admit the right of the House of\r\nCommons to inquire how Ministers proposed to spend their salaries.\r\n“For my part,” he added, “I will never consent to hold office in\r\nthis House under the Crown, subject to the condition that the House\r\nof Commons or any other body in this country is entitled to inquire\r\nhow I spend the money which I receive. If my right hon. friends\r\nand colleagues—for I have no concern in the matter myself—choose\r\nby domestic arrangement among themselves to determine how their\r\nparticular salaries are going to be allocated, I submit that that\r\nis not a matter for the House or the public.” The payment to each\r\nMinister of the salary attached by Parliament to his office was\r\nresumed under the second Coalition Government formed by Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, head of the Government and its maker, receives\r\nno salary. The position was even unknown to the Constitution until\r\n1905, when it was formally recognized and given high precedence by\r\nKing Edward VII on the appointment of Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman to it\r\nin succession to Mr. Arthur Balfour. Some office of State carrying a\r\nsalary is accordingly held by the Prime Minister. It is usually that\r\nof First Lord of the Treasury, or, as he is fully described, “First\r\nCommissioner for executing the Office of the Lord High Treasurer of\r\nhis Majesty’s Exchequer,” which carries a salary of £5,000 a year\r\nand that famous official residence, No. 10 Downing Street. There is\r\na country house, “Chequers,” in Buckingham, the gift in 1920 of Lord\r\nLee of Farnham. The post is a sinecure in the departmental sense, no\r\nduties being attached to it, which leaves the holder of it free to\r\ndischarge his most responsible, varied, and laborious task as Prime\r\nMinister. This includes the general supervision of every Department\r\nof the State, domestic, colonial, and foreign, and the direction and\r\ncontrol of the political policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nOf the Prime Ministers who have sat in the House of Commons, some\r\nhave been not only First Lord of the Treasury, but Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer also. Pitt was Chancellor of the Exchequer as well as\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury in his long term of office from 1783 to\r\n1801. Henry Addington, who succeeded Pitt as Prime Minister, was\r\nalso Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the Treasury.\r\nPitt, on returning to power in 1804, again filled the two offices;\r\nand the precedent was followed by Perceval and Canning when each was\r\nPrime Minister. Sir Robert Peel, in his first brief three-months’\r\nadministration of 1834-35, was also First Lord of the Treasury\r\nand Chancellor of the Exchequer. Gladstone, both in his first\r\nAdministration, 1868-74, and in his second, 1880-85, was for a time\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer as well as First Lord of the Treasury.\r\nThe Prime Ministers, from Pitt to Canning, who were Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer and First Lord of the Treasury, drew the salaries of\r\nboth offices, then amounting to £10,398; but it was decided by the\r\nCommittee of 1831 that in the event of the two positions being again\r\nfilled by one Minister, half the salary of the second office should\r\nbe withheld. Peel and Gladstone, accordingly, were paid only at the\r\nrate of £7,500 a year—the full salary of each office being fixed at\r\n£5,000 in 1831—for the time that each was First Lord of the Treasury\r\nand Chancellor of the Exchequer. Lord Salisbury made a new departure\r\nas Prime Minister by acting as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\r\nin his three Administrations, 1885, 1886, and 1895, at a salary\r\nof £5,000. The labours of these Prime Ministers, who, in addition\r\nto supervising everything, administered a special Department, and\r\nparticularly a Department so onerous as that of the Treasury or the\r\nForeign Office, must indeed have been immense. It is improbable, now\r\nthat the labours and responsibilities of office are ever increasing,\r\nthat this herculean task will ever be undertaken again. But it shows\r\nthat our Prime Ministers have never shirked work while enjoying the\r\nemoluments of office, to use the consecrated phrase.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Treasury, in the control of the imposition of\r\ntaxes and the expenditure of the national revenue, is not the First\r\nLord of the Treasury, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is a\r\nhard-worked Minister and not often is his task of making ends meet\r\nbrightened by the sunshine of popular favour. “You have held for a\r\nlong time the most unpopular office of the State,” Gladstone, as\r\nPrime Minister, wrote to his fallen Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nRobert Lowe, who had come to grief over an attempt to impose a tax\r\nupon matches in 1873. “No man can do his duty in that office and be\r\npopular while he holds it,” he went on. “I could easily name the two\r\nworst Chancellors of the Exchequer of the last forty years; against\r\nneither of them did I ever hear a word while they were in (I might\r\nalmost add, nor for them after they were out): ‘Blessed are ye when\r\nmen shall revile you.’ You have fought for the public tooth and nail.\r\nYou have been under a storm of unpopularity; but not a fiercer one\r\nthan I had to stand in 1860, when hardly anyone dared to say a word\r\nfor me; but, certainly, it was one of my best years of service, even\r\nthough bad be the best.” The salary attached to this arduous office\r\nbefore 1831 was £5,398, which was made up of fees from different\r\nsources. On the recommendation of the Committee of 1831 it was\r\nreduced to a fixed sum of £5,000. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has\r\nalso an official residence, 11 Downing Street.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who assists the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer in the administration of his department, is paid\r\n£2,000 a year. There are also three Junior Lords of the Treasury.\r\nAs such they have no official duties whatever. What, then, do they\r\ndo for their salary of £1,000 a year each? According to an amusing\r\ndefinition of their duties given by Canning, they are always to be\r\nat St. Stephen’s, to keep a House and to cheer the Ministers. They\r\nare, in fact, the assistant Whips of the Party in office. The Chief\r\nWhip also fills a sinecure post of £2,000 a year, which used to be\r\nstyled the Patronage Secretary to the Treasury, and has of late years\r\nbeen called the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.[2] The\r\nConstitution knows not the Whips. They are provided for by offices\r\nto which there are salaries, but no duties attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nVery important Ministers are the six Secretaries of State. For a\r\ncentury before 1782 there were two joint Secretaries of State. One\r\nhad the management of affairs relating to the northern States of\r\nEurope; the other dealt with matters affecting the southern countries\r\nof the Continent, and Home affairs, which included Ireland and the\r\nColonies. In 1782 there was a redistribution of their duties, and\r\neach got a distinctive title. The former was called “Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs,”[3] and was given control of the relations\r\nof the Kingdom with all foreign States; and the latter was styled\r\n“Secretary of State for the Home Department,” which included Great\r\nBritain, Ireland, and the Colonies. There was also at this time a\r\nMinister called “Secretary at War,” responsible for the land forces\r\nof the Crown, who, by a singular arrangement, was a subordinate of\r\nthe Home Office. In 1794 the Secretary of State for War was created;\r\nand in 1801 the affairs of the Colonies were by another strange\r\narrangement transferred to him from the Home Department. But in 1854,\r\non the outbreak of the Crimean War, the War Minister was relieved\r\nof all Colonial business, which was vested in a new Secretary of\r\nState for the Colonies. In 1858, after the Indian Mutiny, when the\r\nauthority and power of the East India Company were taken over by\r\nthe Imperial Government, the Secretary of State for India was first\r\nappointed. The office of Secretary of State for Air which, as I have\r\nalready said, was created in 1917, during the Great War, is held\r\nconjointly with the Secretaryship for War. The Air Minister, as\r\nPresident of the Air Council, is responsible for the administration\r\nof the Air Force and the defence of the realm by air. The salary\r\nof a Secretary of State is £5,000 per annum. Each is assisted in\r\nthe work of his department by an Under-Secretary of State, who is\r\npaid £1,500. The War Office has an additional parliamentary official\r\nknown as the Financial Secretary, who also receives £1,500. In 1919\r\na new Under-Secretaryship was attached to the Foreign Office, called\r\n“Secretary of the Overseas Trade Department” (it has relations\r\nwith the Board of Trade also), with a salary of £1,500 a year. The\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty is paid £4,500 a year for directing the\r\naffairs of the Navy. He, like the Secretary of State for War, has two\r\nsubordinates in Parliament—the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary\r\nto the Admiralty, concerned chiefly with the men and the pay and\r\nconditions of service, who gets £2,000, and the Civil Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, responsible for harbour works and docks, who gets £1,000 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe Administration includes three offices of high standing, having\r\nlittle if any departmental duties, but carrying salaries of £2,000\r\neach, which are usually given to elderly men of long service, so\r\nthat the Cabinet might have the advantage of their ripe experience\r\nand sage councils. The first in dignity is the Lord President of\r\nthe Council. He presides at the meetings of the Privy Council; but\r\npractically the only occasion on which all its members are summoned\r\nis at the demise of the Crown, when it becomes the duty of that\r\nancient body to meet for the purpose of proclaiming the accession\r\nof the new Sovereign. Formerly the Lord President was the chairman\r\nof certain committees of the Privy Council, which no longer exist.\r\nIn 1837, when Lord John Russell took the first step to establish\r\na system of national education, a Committee of the Privy Council\r\nwas appointed to administer the moneys which Parliament voted for\r\nthe purpose, and at its deliberations the Lord President presided.\r\nIn 1855 a new office was created—that of Vice-President of the\r\nCouncil—which in time became vested with the control of education,\r\nand that, too, disappeared when the Board of Education, with a\r\nMinister at its head, was created in 1902. In like manner, the\r\nduties of the Privy Council in regard to trade were transferred to\r\nthe Board of Trade, and its duties in regard to public health were\r\ntransferred to the Local Government Board. Again, the Lord President\r\nsupervised the exercise of the statutory powers of the Privy Council\r\nin connection with the prevention of cattle disease; but the creation\r\nof a Board of Agriculture took that work out of his hands and left\r\nhim without any business, save that of the nominal supervision of\r\nthe administrative functions of the Privy Council. The office of\r\nLord Privy Seal is a survival from the historic past when the Privy\r\nCouncil sought to restrain executive acts of the Crown by insisting\r\nthat the Lord Chancellor should not affix the imprimatur of the Great\r\nSeal to any grant, or patent, or writ which the Sovereign desired to\r\nissue, without their authorization in the form of a warrant under the\r\nPrivy Seal. In these days of Government by Parliament, the Lord Privy\r\nSeal has nothing to do. Another office of dignity rather than of\r\nresponsibility is that of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\r\nHis duties in relation to the revenues of the Duchy, which are vested\r\nin the Sovereign and exempt from parliamentary control are purely\r\nnominal, so that he is free to come to the assistance of any Minister\r\nwhen hard pressed in Parliament, or by departmental work outside.\r\n“So far from resembling an epicurean divinity,” said Lord Dufferin\r\nin 1871, when some noble lords called his position a sinecure, “the\r\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster seems to me to be a kind of\r\ncharwoman and maid-of-all-work to the Government.”\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nOne of the busiest of Ministers is the President of the Board of\r\nTrade. The work of the department is most diversified. It covers all\r\nmatters affecting trade and commerce, industries and manufactures,\r\nthe mercantile marine, and commercial relations with foreign\r\ncountries. The salary of the President, formerly £2,000, was raised\r\nto £5,000 in 1909. Attached to the Board of Trade are a Parliamentary\r\nSecretary and a Secretary of Mines (created in 1920), both of whom\r\nare paid £1,500 a year. The Board of Trade holds a titular position\r\nthat distinguishes it from the other Government departments. It was\r\nconstituted in 1786 for the consideration of all matters relating\r\nto trade and foreign plantations. As a board it is a relic of olden\r\nand more leisurely times when much of the work done by the heads\r\nof the departments and chief clerks was revised by commissioners\r\nseated round a board or table. Now, however, only the name survives.\r\nThe Board of Trade never meets. It had, as ex-officio members\r\nsuch exalted personages as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord\r\nChancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, and also one whose\r\noffice came to an end as long ago as 1800—the Speaker of the Irish\r\nParliament. When Mr. Lloyd George was President of the Board of Trade\r\nhe was asked whether the Archbishop of Canterbury had attended any\r\nmeetings of the Board, and in an amusing equivocation replied that\r\nhis Grace “had not missed a single meeting to which he had been\r\nsummoned.” Sydney Buxton, another President of the Board of Trade,\r\nwas asked why the place of the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons\r\non the Board had not been filled up. “After keeping open his place\r\nfor more than a century,” he replied, “I should be sorry now to close\r\nthe door to his possible return to the Board.” He added, amid the\r\nrenewed laughter of the House, “that he should also greatly regret\r\nlosing the Archbishop of Canterbury as a colleague.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Health has charge of the public health and controls\r\nlocal authorities. The Local Government Board, which was created\r\nin 1871, was transformed into the Ministry of Health in 1918. The\r\nMinister’s salary is £5,000, and that of his Parliamentary Secretary\r\n£2,000. In 1889 the Board of Agriculture was established. The powers\r\nof the Board of Trade relating to fisheries were transferred to\r\nthis department in 1903, when its title was changed to that of “The\r\nBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries.” In 1919 the Board became a\r\nMinistry. It is responsible to Parliament for the Office of Woods and\r\nForests which administers Crown lands. The Minister of Agriculture\r\nis paid £2,000, and his Parliamentary Secretary £1,200. In 1902\r\nthe Board of Education entered upon its independent existence\r\namong the Departments of the State. The President of the Board of\r\nEducation has a salary of £2,000, and is assisted in administering\r\nthe system of national education by a Parliamentary Secretary, who\r\ngets £1,200. The First Commissioner of Works, head of the Office of\r\nWorks, which performs overseeing duties in connection with Royal\r\npalaces, State buildings and Royal parks, has £2,000 per annum.\r\nThe Postmaster-General receives £500 a year more, or £2,500, in\r\nconsideration of his more onerous duties and responsibilities in\r\nthe control of the postal and telegraph services, and there is an\r\nAssistant Postmaster-General, who is paid £1,200.\r\n\r\nTwo new Ministries were created during the Great War to control and\r\nadminister affairs which arose out of it—ways and communication, by\r\nthe Ministry of Transport; and the allotment and payment of pensions\r\nto disabled soldiers and sailors, and to the relations of the\r\nkilled, by the Ministry of Pensions.[4] The Labour Ministry, for the\r\nenforcement of legal regulations in mines, factories and workshops,\r\nwas brought into being in the same period. These four Ministers are\r\npaid £2,000 each, and their Parliamentary Secretaries £1,200 each.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Secretary for Ireland has £4,425 a year. The salary was\r\nformerly £5,500. The Committee on Official Salaries, in 1850,\r\nrecommended its reduction to £3,000, but it was fixed at £4,000,\r\nwith an extra allowance of £425 for the special travelling and other\r\nexpenses of the post. The Chief Secretary has also an official\r\nresidence in the Phœnix Park, Dublin. He is paid double the salary\r\nof an Under-Secretary of State—besides his extra allowance—on\r\naccount of being obliged to reside part of the year in London and\r\npart in Dublin. Formerly the Chief Secretary was subordinate to the\r\nHome Office, but he has been for many years independent of that\r\ndepartment. His full title is “Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland.” The relations between the Lord-Lieutenant and his\r\nChief Secretary have, however, become inverted in recent times. The\r\nChief Secretary is now solely responsible to Parliament for Irish\r\naffairs; and the Viceroyalty has become more and more a position\r\nof dignity rather than of power. The most highly paid office in the\r\nAdministration is that of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, the salary\r\nbeing £20,000 a year, with an allowance of £3,000 for outfit on\r\nappointment, and an official residence in the Phœnix Park, known as\r\nthe Viceregal Lodge, as well as apartments in Dublin Castle. There\r\nis also a political office of Vice-President of the Irish Department\r\nof Agriculture, created in 1899, to which a salary of £1,200 a\r\nyear is attached. For Scotland there is a Secretary, responsible,\r\nlike the Chief Secretary for Ireland, for a large number of public\r\ndepartments, paid £2,000 a year, and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary\r\nfor Health, paid £1,200 a year.\r\n\r\nThe salary attached to the office of Lord Chancellor of England\r\nis £10,000—£4,000 as Speaker of the House of Lords, and £6,000\r\nas Judge. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland is paid £6,000 a year.\r\nIndeed, the best paid offices are the legal. The Attorney-General\r\ngets £7,000, and the Solicitor-General £6,000; and both receive,\r\nin addition, high fees for cases they conduct in the law courts on\r\nbehalf of the Crown. During 1913-14, the financial year before the\r\nGreat War, the Attorney-General was paid, in all, £18,397; and the\r\nSolicitor-General, £19,027. The fees of the Attorney-General in the\r\nyear after the War, 1918-19, amounted to £8,500, and those of the\r\nSolicitor-General to £10,300. They are the confidential advisers of\r\nthe Cabinet on questions of law. Both also expound and defend in the\r\nHouse of Commons the legal provisions of Government measures and\r\nproposals. The Attorney-General for Ireland, as chief law officer and\r\nlaw adviser of the Crown in Ireland, gets £5,000 a year and fees;\r\nand the Lord Advocate of Scotland, who holds a similar position in\r\nregard to Scotland, also gets £5,000 a year, but no fees. Ireland and\r\nScotland have each a Solicitor-General, who is paid £2,000.\r\n\r\nThere are posts in the Royal Household which are political, and\r\ntherefore, like offices in the Administration, are vacated at a\r\nchange of Government. The best paid of these Ministers is the Master\r\nof the Horse, who gets £2,500 a year, the use of a Royal carriage\r\nand horses, and the services of four of the King’s footmen. He\r\nhas authority over all matters relating to the royal stables, the\r\nKing’s equerries, pages, grooms, coachmen, and is responsible for\r\narranging the details of Royal processions, such as the procession\r\nfrom Buckingham Palace to Westminster when the King goes in State\r\nto open Parliament. The Lord Chamberlain, who has the regulation of\r\nCourts and levees, and admission to them; and the Lord Steward, who\r\nhas control of matters “below stairs,” just as the Lord Chamberlain\r\nhas of those “above stairs,” are each paid £2,000. Then there\r\nare the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, and the Captain of the\r\nYeomen of the Guard, who each draw salaries of £1,000 a year. The\r\nfunctions of these ancient bodyguards of the Sovereign are now\r\nentirely ceremonial. There are also seven Lords-in-Waiting—one for\r\nevery day in the week—who are paid £600 a year each. Only peers are\r\neligible for all the foregoing Household appointments. There are\r\nthree other posts, carrying salaries of £700 each, which are always\r\ngiven to Members of the other House—Comptroller of the Household,\r\nwho conveys messages from the Commons to the Sovereign, Treasurer\r\nof the Household, and Vice-Chamberlain. The duties of these offices\r\nare practically nominal, and the holders of them, whether Lords or\r\nCommons, act as assistant Whips in their respective Houses, or do all\r\nsorts of odd jobs for the Government. Finally, there is one unpaid\r\nMinister, and he is, strange to say, called “Paymaster-General.” He\r\nis the head of the office which makes the payments required by the\r\ndifferent departments of State out of the sums voted for the purpose\r\nby the House of Commons, and placed to his account by the Treasury.\r\nHe issues the warrants which puts thousands of pounds into the\r\npockets of his colleagues in the Ministry, but not a brass farthing\r\ninto his own. What a tantalizing position! It is the office that is\r\nthe attraction. For the Paymaster-General, though he gets no salary,\r\nis proud to know that he is a Member of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPENSIONS FOR MINISTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIt appears to be widely supposed that Ministers of the Crown receive\r\npensions on retirement. The position is that a Minister of the Crown\r\nmay obtain a pension if he has held office for four or five years.\r\nBut he is not entitled to it as a right on account of his service.\r\nHe must apply for it to the First Lord of the Treasury, and make a\r\ndeclaration that his private income or resources are inadequate to\r\nthe maintenance of the social position proper to one who has been a\r\nMinister of the Crown. Only two Members of the Government receive\r\npensions automatically on retiring from office, the Lord Chancellor\r\nof England, whose pension is £5,000, and the Lord Chancellor of\r\nIreland, whose pension is £4,000 a year. These two pensions are\r\npayable as a matter of course, however brief may have been the\r\nperiod of service. Nor is there any limitation to the number of\r\nsuch pensions that may be paid at the same time. At the close of\r\nthe World War in 1918 there were living four ex-Lord Chancellors\r\nof England—Lord Halsbury, Lord Loreburn, Lord Haldane, and Lord\r\nBuckmaster—all of whom are paid the £5,000 a year, and a fifth, Lord\r\nFinlay, who, it was understood, waived his right to the retiring\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nThe other political pensions are, as I have said, conditional.\r\nJohnson felt it necessary to define the English use of the word\r\n“pension” as: “Pay given to a State hireling for treason to his\r\ncountry.” Johnson, however, afterwards did something to make this\r\nform of royal bounty respectable by himself accepting £300 a year\r\nfrom George III. Undoubtedly in the corrupt stage of political\r\nlife during the eighteenth century there were numerous pensions and\r\nsinecure offices for Ministers who were needy, or simply greedy.\r\nA Committee of the House of Commons reported in 1802 that for\r\ntwenty years previous a sum of £115,000 had been annually spent on\r\npensions. But as political morality developed with the progress of\r\nthe nineteenth century, or as the tax-payer grew impatient of his\r\nincreasing burdens, this system of growing rich or repairing broken\r\nfortunes at the public expense gradually came to an end. The granting\r\nof political pensions was for the first time regulated by an Act\r\npassed by the Reform Government of Earl Grey in 1834—the “4 and 5\r\nWilliam V, c. 24,” which is described as an Act, “to alter, amend,\r\nand consolidate the laws for regulating pensions, compensations, and\r\nallowances to be made to persons in respect of their having held\r\ncivil offices of his Majesty’s service.”\r\n\r\nThe statute which now governs the granting of pensions to\r\nex-Ministers is the Political Offices Pension Act, 1869. It was\r\nGladstone, then in the first year of office as Prime Minister, who\r\nbrought in the measure. The only serious opposition to it came from\r\nHenry Fawcett (afterwards Postmaster-General in Gladstone’s second\r\nAdministration), who thought that no Minister should be entitled\r\nto a political pension unless he had been obliged to give up his\r\nprofession or business on taking office, and found it impossible to\r\nresume it on retirement. Gladstone explained that his scheme was no\r\nmore than a necessary amendment of the Act of 1834, which authorized\r\npensions varying from £800 to £2,000, according to length of service\r\nand the emoluments received, and after a short discussion, with one\r\ndivision—94 to 15—the Bill was passed.\r\n\r\nThree classes of pensions for ex-Ministers were thus created:\r\n\r\n  First-class pensions of £2,000 for four years’ service in an office\r\n  of not less than £5,000 a year.\r\n\r\n  Second-class pensions of £1,200 for five years’ service in an\r\n  office of less than £5,000 a year and not less than £2,000 a year.\r\n\r\n  Third-class pensions of £800 for five years’ service in an office\r\n  of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe period of service may be continuous, or at different times,\r\nand in different offices of the same class. “No new pension shall\r\nbe granted in any class while four pensions in that class are\r\nsubsisting,” says that Act; “nor shall more than one pension be\r\ngranted in the same year.”\r\n\r\nThe Political Offices Pensions Act, 1869, embodies the following\r\nsection of the Act of 1834:\r\n\r\n  And whereas the principle of the regulations for granting\r\n  allowances of this nature is and ought to be founded on a\r\n  consideration not only of the services performed by the individual\r\n  to the State, but of the inadequacy of his private fortune to\r\n  maintain his station in life; be it therefore enacted that from\r\n  and after the passing of this Act, whenever any person shall seek\r\n  to obtain one of the pensions before mentioned his application for\r\n  that purpose shall be made in writing to the Commissioners of his\r\n  Majesty’s Treasury, to which he shall subscribe his name, and which\r\n  shall contain not only a statement of the services performed by him\r\n  and the grounds on which such pension is claimed, but a specific\r\n  declaration that the amount of his income from other sources is\r\n  so limited as to bring him within the intent and meaning of this\r\n  Act and the principle hereinabove declared, and without such\r\n  declaration no pension as hereinbefore provided or authorized shall\r\n  be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that Benjamin Disraeli was a pensioner\r\nunder the Act of 1834. There is but an obscure and passing reference\r\nto it in Buckle’s _Life of Lord Beaconsfield_. Lord Derby granted\r\nhim a first-class pension in June, 1859. Disraeli was the only Prime\r\nMinister of modern times who received a political pension. He was\r\nin receipt of it when he died as Lord Beaconsfield in April, 1881.\r\nThe pension was, of course, suspended while he was in office as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer or First Lord of the Treasury (including\r\nhis two terms as Prime Minister), but the total amount drawn by\r\nhim in pensions, between 1859 and 1881, was £26,456 6s. 7d. Other\r\ndistinguished pensioners under the Act of 1834 were Spencer Walpole,\r\nthree times Home Secretary, who from May, 1867, until his death in\r\nMay, 1898, received in the aggregate a sum of £62,032 19s. 4d.; Sir\r\nGeorge Grey, four times Home Secretary, who from 1857 to 1882 drew\r\n£39,070 2s. 6d.; and Thomas Milner Gibson, President of the Board of\r\nTrade, who was paid £35,275 1s. 3d. between 1866 and 1884.\r\n\r\nThe first beneficiary under the Act of 1869 was Charles Pelham\r\nVilliers, the associate of Cobden and Bright in the agitation for\r\nFree Trade. He entered Parliament for Wolverhampton in 1835, and sat\r\nfor the same constituency until his death in 1898 at the great age\r\nof ninety-six. For some years at the end of his long career as a\r\nmember of Parliament he was Father of the House of Commons. Villiers\r\nhas a place among the few public men who have had statues erected\r\nto them in their lifetime. He was so honoured by Wolverhampton\r\nten years before his death. Villiers held office in two Liberal\r\nAdministrations, having been Judge Advocate-General for six years,\r\nand for the same period President of the Poor Law Board, an office\r\nlong since merged in the Local Government Board, now the Ministry of\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\nVilliers was awarded a second-class pension of £1,200 by Gladstone\r\non August 19, 1869, a few days after the Political Offices Pensions\r\nAct became law. Although this amount was reduced to £450 a year until\r\nJanuary 5, 1874, as Villiers had also a pension of £750 from the\r\nSuitors’ Fee Fund of the Court of Chancery—is there not quite a touch\r\nof eighteenth-century sinecure in this?—Villiers received altogether,\r\nunder the Act of 1869, the large sum of £30,810 12s. 8d., and was\r\ndrawing the pension at his death in 1898. It may be said that no man\r\nbetter earned a pension than Villiers. His record of public service\r\nis unparalleled in the annals of the House of Commons. But on the\r\nproving of his will it was found that he had been a very wealthy man.\r\nHe left, in fact, a fortune of £250,000.\r\n\r\nGladstone, subsequently to the award of the pension to Villiers,\r\nmade a rule by which every ex-Minister to whom he, as First Lord\r\nof the Treasury, granted a pension was required not only to make\r\nthe statutory declaration that he was unable to maintain his social\r\nstation, but was also obliged to engage to surrender the pension\r\nshould he come into a private fortune, or obtain a highly paid\r\nappointment. Villiers, it seems, had an accession of fortune, but\r\nevidently he did not consider that the new engagement applied to him,\r\nas he had not signed it.\r\n\r\nAs these pensions are paid, not out of monies voted by Parliament,\r\nbut directly out of the Consolidated Fund, like the salaries and\r\nretiring allowances of the Judges, they cannot be raised as a subject\r\nof debate in the House of Commons. Attention, however, was drawn by\r\nmeans of questions to Villiers’ case, and subsequently to the case of\r\nViscount Cross, who died in March, 1914, leaving a personal estate\r\nof the value of £72,299, after having drawn a second-class pension\r\nof £2,000 for over twenty years, which amounted in the aggregate to\r\n£40,760. It appeared that Lord Cross, like Villiers, did not sign the\r\ndeclaration to surrender his pension in the event of an improvement\r\nin his pecuniary circumstances. As Lord Beaconsfield left £84,000\r\nat his death, his case differs only in one respect from those of\r\nVilliers and Cross—he had been twice Prime Minister of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe First Lord of the Treasury is restricted by precedent to granting\r\nthese political pensions only to ex-Ministers of his own Party.\r\nIn 1883 an application was made to Gladstone for a pension for a\r\nConservative ex-Minister. It was refused on the ground “that no\r\npolitical pension has been granted by any Minister during the last\r\nfifty years, except to one with whom he stood on terms of general\r\nconfidence and co-operation.” The Prime Minister went on to say,\r\n“the examination of private circumstances, such as I consider the\r\nAct to require, is, for its nature, difficult and invidious; but the\r\nexamination of competing cases in the ex-official corps is a function\r\nthat could not be discharged with the necessary combination of free\r\nresponsible action and of exemption from offence and suspicion.”\r\nGladstone therefore declined to “create a precedent of deviation from\r\na course undeviatingly pursued by my predecessors of all Parties.”\r\nLord Morley, who gives this letter in his _Life of Gladstone_,\r\nobserves in a note: “Mr. Gladstone had suffered an unpleasant\r\nexperience in another case of the relations brought about by the\r\nrefusal of a political pension, after inquiry as to the accuracy of\r\nthe necessary statement as to the applicant’s need of it.”\r\n\r\nWe are told also in the same work that Gladstone, in his last term of\r\noffice, came to hold strongly the view that these political pensions,\r\nwhich he himself created, should be abolished. Lord Morley says he\r\nwas only deterred from trying to carry out his views by the reminder\r\nfrom younger Ministers, not themselves applicants, nor ever likely to\r\nbe, that it would hardly be a gracious thing to cut off benefactions\r\nat a time when the bestowal of them was passing away from him, though\r\nhe had used them freely while they were within his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nI do not think it can be maintained that the salaries of Ministers\r\nare more than fair remuneration, considering the weighty and\r\nabsorbing duties and responsibilities of the offices, and also\r\nthe difficulty of attaining to them and the uncertainty of their\r\ntenure.[5] It is far from being an easy matter to become a Minister\r\nof the Crown. The posts are few, and the competition among the many\r\naspirants to them is very keen. Most Members of Parliament never\r\nreach it, even though they may have had long and brilliant careers in\r\npublic life. Fox, who was forty years in Parliament—having entered\r\nthe House of Commons when he was nineteen, and retained his seat\r\nuntil his death at the age of fifty-nine—held Cabinet office for\r\nonly about eighteen months. In 1782 he was Secretary of State for\r\nthree months in the Rockingham Administration; in 1783 he filled the\r\nsame office for nine months during his coalition with Lord North,\r\nwho was the joint Secretary of State, with the Duke of Portland, as\r\nPremier, nominally rather than effectually at the head of affairs.\r\nThen followed twenty-three years of Opposition during the long and\r\nbrilliant ascendancy of William Pitt. In January 1806 Pitt died, and\r\nin the Grenville Government which followed Fox returned to office\r\nfor the third time as Secretary of State. Once more his tenure of\r\nthe office was brief. After eight months it was brought to an end by\r\nhis premature death in September, 1806. Fox was a rake, and, being\r\na younger son, naturally was always in debt. But he never mourned\r\nfor the spoils of office, so that he could the more freely indulge\r\nin his tastes as a man of pleasure. He desired office that he might\r\nembody his political ideas in Acts of Parliament. He moved his famous\r\nresolution for the abolition of the slave trade in June 1806; his\r\nhealth had broken down, and conscious that the end was near at hand,\r\nhe declared that after forty years of public life he should retire,\r\nfeeling that he had done his duty, if he carried his motion. The\r\nmotion was carried by a majority of 99—114 voting for it, and only 15\r\nagainst. It was practically his last appearance in the House. A few\r\ndays later disease compelled him to retire.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, William Pitt, as a Minister, was the spoiled\r\ndarling of fortune. In 1782, at the age of twenty-three, he\r\nwas appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Shelburne\r\nAdministration. He was out of office for the nine months in 1783,\r\nduring which Fox and North were in power. But in December of that\r\nyear, on the dismissal of the Coalition Government, he became First\r\nLord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Prime Minister,\r\nand he was not yet twenty-five. He held these offices for the\r\nunbroken term of seventeen years. As First Lord of the Treasury he\r\nhad £5,000 a year, and £5,398 a year as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nHe had, besides, the official residence in Downing Street. The\r\nClerkship of the Pells, a sinecure office worth £3,000 a year, fell\r\nvacant on Pitt’s accession to power; and in that age of jobs it was\r\ndeemed a remarkable instance of disinterestedness that, instead of\r\ntaking the place himself, and thus acquiring an independence for\r\nlife, he gave it to a friend. But on the death of Lord North in\r\n1792, George III appointed him to the sinecure office of Lord Warden\r\nof the Cinque Ports, with a salary of £4,000—reduced by payments to\r\nsubordinates to £3,080—and the seaside residence of Walmer Castle.\r\nFor eight years, therefore, he had £10,398 per annum, and for\r\nanother nine years, £13,478 per annum, from the State. Yet on his\r\nresignation in 1801—owing to the refusal of the King to sanction\r\nthe emancipation of the Catholics, without which Pitt regarded the\r\nUnion with Ireland which he had just carried as incomplete—he was\r\nin debt to the amount of £45,000. As his official salaries were\r\nstopped—though, of course, he retained the £4,000 a year as Lord\r\nWarden—he was in danger of being thrown into prison as a debtor. The\r\nmerchants of London offered him a free gift of £100,000, and the\r\nKing tendered him £30,000 from his Privy Purse, so that he might\r\nextricate himself from his unpleasant predicament. He declined both\r\noffers. He, however, accepted from fourteen personal friends and\r\npolitical supporters £11,700 as a loan, by which he was enabled to\r\ndischarge the most pressing of his creditors. In May 1804 he returned\r\nto power as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nand Prime Minister, and again drew the double salaries of £10,398\r\nuntil he died, in office, on January 23, 1806. His debts were paid by\r\nParliament. They amounted to the enormous sum of £40,000, exclusive\r\nof the £11,700 advanced to him in 1801 by his friends, who now\r\ndeclined repayment.\r\n\r\nWhat was the explanation of Pitt’s indebtedness? His private life\r\nseems to have been remarkably pure. His one dissipation was an\r\nextra bottle of port. He was a bachelor. A man of cold and shy\r\nmanners, he had few friends—his nose, as Romney said, was turned up\r\nto all mankind—he mixed little in society, and he was not given to\r\nhospitality. Yet with £13,478 a year, and town and seaside houses,\r\n“free of coal, candles and taxes”—to quote the official phrase of\r\nthe time—in each of which he maintained but a plain and inexpensive\r\nestablishment, he died at the early age of forty-seven, owing\r\n£51,700. The only explanation of the mystery that has been advanced\r\nis that, so absorbed was Pitt in public life, and so indifferent was\r\nhe to money, he neglected his private affairs and was robbed by his\r\nservants. It was an hereditary weakness, perhaps. His father, the\r\nfirst Earl of Chatham, of whose private life Lord Chesterfield wrote,\r\n“It was stained by no vices, nor sullied by any meanness,” died in\r\ndebt to the extent of £20,000, which Parliament paid, as well as\r\nsettling an annuity of £4,000 a year on his successors in the earldom.\r\n\r\n“Dispensing for near twenty years the favours of the Crown,”\r\nsays Canning in the epitaph he wrote of William Pitt, “he lived\r\nwithout ostentation, and he died poor.” Further than this it\r\nis now impossible to carry the story of the material result to\r\nhimself of Pitt’s official career. But these happy words are of\r\ngeneral application as a tribute to the devotion, honesty, and\r\nself-sacrifice of the Ministers of the Crown. There is no instance\r\nof a Prime Minister who grew rich in office. Spencer Perceval, who\r\nwas assassinated in the Lobby of the House of Commons, on May 11,\r\n1812, left his family so ill-provided for that Parliament had to come\r\nto their assistance. As is usual in such cases, Parliament acted\r\nhandsomely. It made a grant of £50,000 to the family, and voted to\r\nthe widow a pension of £2,000 a year, which on her death was to be\r\ncontinued to the eldest son and increased to £3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nWhen Lord John Russell was Prime Minister and First Lord of the\r\nTreasury he publicly declared that no man without a private fortune\r\ncould hope to fill any of the high offices of the State with freedom\r\nfrom pecuniary worries. “For my part,” he said, “I never had a debt\r\nin my life until I was First Lord of the Treasury.” A Minister was\r\nobliged largely to increase his personal expenditure in order to\r\nmeet the social calls of his office. He must live in a better style\r\nas a Member of the Government than as a Member of the Opposition. A\r\nlarge house, servants, and carriages were essential to the adequate\r\nfulfilling of his social obligations as a Minister. “If I recollect\r\naright,” said Lord John Russell to the Select Committee on Official\r\nSalaries in 1850, “when Monsieur de Tercy went from France to\r\nendeavour to make peace with the Dutch Government, he was very much\r\nstruck, on calling upon the Grand Pensionary, to find the door opened\r\nby a servant-maid, and he thought it showed very great republican\r\nsympathy; and no doubt it was very becoming. But I think that if\r\nLord Palmerston had only a housemaid to open the door, and Foreign\r\nMinisters called there, everybody would say that he was very mean\r\nand unfit for his situation.” Palmerston was, at the time, Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs, and, being a wealthy man, was noted\r\nfor his lavish hospitality. In fact, the £5,000 a year which the\r\nhead of the Foreign Office is paid does not always cover the cost of\r\nliving, and the social entertainments which he has annually to give.\r\nIn addition to maintaining a position of great dignity in a becoming\r\nmanner, he is expected regularly to entertain at his own expense the\r\nmembers of the various foreign diplomatic missions in London. Lord\r\nRosebery has said that when he was Foreign Secretary in 1893 he spent\r\nhalf of his year’s salary upon two receptions at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nGladstone, like Lord John Russell, lived well in office and simply in\r\nopposition. On his appointment as Prime Minister for the first time\r\nin 1868 he took a house in that region of the rich and fashionable,\r\nCarlton House Terrace. After his defeat in the General Election\r\nof 1875 he wrote to his wife saying that they must retrench their\r\nexpenditure. “The truth is,” he said, “that innocently and from\r\nspecial causes we have on the whole been housed better than according\r\nto our circumstances. All along Carlton House Terrace, I think, you\r\nwould not find anyone with less than £20,000 a year, and most of them\r\nwith much more.” His official salary was but £5,000, and when it was\r\nstopped he retired to Harley street. During his two other terms of\r\noffice as Prime Minister he inhabited the official house in Downing\r\nStreet. Gladstone had a passion for public economy. He even grudged\r\nthe spending of a small sum of money to make bright with flowers the\r\nlittle garden at the back of No. 10 Downing Street, so eager was his\r\ndesire to limit the demands on the National Exchequer. But he always\r\nconsidered that he had well earned his allowance as Minister. Mr.\r\nJohn Bright, it seems, had a compunctious visiting of shame every\r\ntime that the quarterly cheque for his official salary arrived, and\r\nonce he disclosed his feelings to Gladstone. “There I don’t agree\r\nwith you, Bright,” said Gladstone. “I’d rather take my official money\r\nthan anything I receive from land, for I know I have earned every\r\npenny of it.”\r\n\r\nThe emoluments of office were an important consideration to some\r\nof the greatest men in political history. Burke, Pitt, Sheridan,\r\nPerceval and Canning had no hereditary fortunes, and if there were\r\nnot adequate salaries attached to office they could not have given\r\ntheir great abilities to the services of the country in government\r\nand administration. Edmund Burke, whose movement for economic\r\nreform in the conduct of State affairs led to the abolition of\r\nmany political sinecures, insisted, nevertheless, that reasonable\r\nemoluments should be paid to Ministers. He said:\r\n\r\n  I will even go so far as to affirm that if men were willing to\r\n  serve in such situations without salary, they ought not to be\r\n  permitted to do it. Ordinary service must be secured by the motives\r\n  to ordinary integrity. I do not hesitate to say that the State\r\n  which lays its foundation in rare and heroic virtues will be sure\r\n  to have its superstructure in the basest profligacy and corruption.\r\n  An honourable and fair profit is the best security against avarice\r\n  and rapacity, as in all things else a lawful and regulated\r\n  enjoyment is the best security against debauchery and excess.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the salaries of office were meagre, statesmanship would\r\nbecome entirely an appendage of wealth. In former times most of\r\nthe highest offices of the Government were filled by territorial\r\nmagnates, Whig or Tory—members of aristocratic families with ample\r\nprivate means as well as great traditions of public service. To\r\nthese men, possessed of personal fortunes of £15,000, £20,000 or\r\n£40,000 a year, the salaries of office may have been regarded as\r\nunconsidered trifles. And yet, strangely enough, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when rich noblemen, their relatives and dependants were\r\nat the head of affairs, the political seems to have been quite a\r\nlucrative profession, for a Minister often held his majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons together, not so much by principles, as by places\r\nand pensions.\r\n\r\nBut the old custom of confining the highest of the offices of State\r\nexclusively to men of hereditary position and wealth and leisure\r\ncame to an end by the middle of the nineteenth century. The tendency\r\nto open the arena of statesmanship to all members of the Party in\r\npower of proved ability and distinction, but irrespective of birth\r\nor rank or fortune, was strikingly shown in the Administration\r\nwhich Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman formed in 1905, when John Burns,\r\na manual worker from an engineering shipyard, was made President\r\nof the Local Government Board and a Cabinet Minister; and as this\r\ntendency is bound to become wider and wider still as time progresses,\r\nthe salaries of Ministers must be at least sufficient to provide a\r\nlivelihood in order to attract to the service of the State men well\r\nequipped for it in intellectual ability, and experience in affairs,\r\nbut without private means.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, remains that the emoluments of office are not\r\nthe allurement of the public service, and they never can be in any\r\nconceivable circumstances under the Party system, and the frequent\r\nchanges of Government which it involves. Those who make politics a\r\ncalling are very few in number. As a rule, men do not enter upon a\r\npolitical career with the object of making fortunes as statesmen, or\r\neven of securing a livelihood, in the way that men study medicine\r\nto become doctors, or law to become barristers. The uncertainty of\r\nattaining office and, in the event of success, the precariousness\r\nand brevity of its tenure will always make statesmanship the most\r\nunreliable of callings in the eyes of those bent on having a good\r\nbalance at their bankers. The emoluments of office are really not so\r\nmuch salaries as prizes.\r\n\r\nIf two able young men of equal mental endowment were to set out on\r\nthe same day to make their way in the world, one going into commerce\r\nor the professions, and the other into politics, it is almost a\r\ncertainty that when the time came for retirement the man who had\r\nselected a professional or business avocation, and was successful,\r\nwould be ten times as wealthy, at the very least, as the man who gave\r\nhimself to the service of the State, even though he had attained to\r\nthe most renowned and exalted office of Prime Minister. Members of\r\nParliament are, as a rule, engaged in commercial and professional\r\noccupations, and they follow politics as a concurrent career. The\r\nfew who show a special aptitude for leadership and office ultimately\r\nreach the Treasury Bench, but they hold on, nevertheless, to the\r\nestablished and secure positions on which they continue to depend for\r\ntheir bread-and-butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n“Spoils of Office!” The phrase was long since emptied entirely of its\r\neighteenth-century suggestion of “grab,” and remembering the public\r\nrage for economy, which is likely to endure for ever and ever on\r\naccount of national necessities, it may be accepted that “spoils,”\r\nin the sense of pecuniary rewards, will less and less attach to\r\nservice of the State. The responsibility and distinction of governing\r\nthe country will, happily, always be attractive, and it will always\r\nbring the chance of gaining the greatest of most alluring “spoil” of\r\nall—that of doing something to maintain the renown of the country for\r\nhonour and the prosperity and happiness of its people.\r\n\r\n“This won’t do. You have taken the Queen’s shilling.” So said\r\nDisraeli to a Member of his Administration who was absent without due\r\ncause from a division in the House of Commons. It is not often that\r\na Minister has to be reprimanded by his chief for want of devotion\r\neither to his Party or to the State. Happy country! Men of the\r\nhighest class in ability and integrity are ever ready to take its\r\nburdens upon their shoulders. It does not, of course, follow that\r\nhonest and disinterested men are always the best of politicians.\r\nPersonal integrity and intellectual ability are, indeed, some\r\nassurance of wisdom in the guidance of the State. But they are not\r\nan infallible guarantee. If they were, there would never be a need\r\nfor a change of Government. It has happened, now and then, that the\r\nprinciples of an Administration were large and lofty enough almost\r\nto bring the nation to ruin. But this much is true—that if Ministers\r\ncling to office in times of Party stress and conflict, it is not\r\nbecause of its emoluments. It is, in the main, because of a real\r\nconcern for the welfare of the Commonwealth. They are convinced that\r\nthe administration of public affairs in the light of their Party\r\nprinciples is essential to the salvation of the country. That and,\r\nfearing they would be beaten at the polls, the human weakness, “to\r\nkeep the other fellows out.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe Speech from the Throne, or, as it is popularly called, “The\r\nKing’s Speech,” which at the opening of every session of Parliament\r\nis read to Peers and Commons assembled in the House of Lords by the\r\nSovereign himself, is always awaited with considerable interest, and,\r\nat times of high political excitement, with some apprehension not\r\nunmingled with vows of defiance. For in it the legislative programme\r\nof the Government is disclosed. As such it is the text on which the\r\nOpposition develop their attack.\r\n\r\nTo call the Speech the “King’s Speech” is a polite fiction—aye,\r\nthough, should his Majesty be absent, the Lord Chancellor, before\r\nhe reads it, is careful to say—following an ancient custom, which\r\nchanges in the Constitution have long since deprived of its old\r\nsignificance—that it is in “his Majesty’s own words.” The Sovereign\r\nhas practically little or no share in its original composition. It is\r\nreally the Speech of the Cabinet. But there was a time when the King\r\nreally spoke in the Speech. Parliament could not then assemble until\r\nthe King thought fit personally to summon it. When it did meet, the\r\nKing appointed and declared the business in his Speech, and Lords and\r\nCommons were expected to confine themselves strictly to the tasks\r\nthus prescribed. This prerogative is still theoretically vested\r\nin the Crown. Parliament can be summoned only by the Sovereign,\r\nbut since the Revolution of 1688 the Sovereign in summoning it has\r\nacted on the advice of the Ministers. Parliament cannot proceed with\r\nbusiness until the Speech from the Throne has been delivered; but\r\nsince the Revolution, also, neither House—as we shall see later—is\r\nbound to confine itself to the “causes of summons” set forth in the\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\nThe first draft of the Speech is usually written by the Prime\r\nMinister. What Bills are to be submitted to Parliament is first\r\ndecided by the Cabinet, but the general contents of the Speech,\r\nand certainly its phraseology, may be ascribed to the head of the\r\nGovernment. The draft is submitted to a full meeting of the Cabinet,\r\nwhere it is discussed point by point; and probably undergoes some\r\nalteration in the way of an omission here, an addition there, or\r\na qualification of some particular statement. Then a copy of the\r\nSpeech is sent to the King for his approval. In _Selections from\r\nthe Correspondence of Queen Victoria_ (published 1907) there is a\r\nmemorandum, written by Prince Albert and dated December 9, 1854, of\r\nan interview with Lord Aberdeen, then Prime Minister, which describes\r\na “scene” in the Cabinet Council over the preparation of the Speech\r\nthat Queen Victoria was to read at the opening of Parliament. Lord\r\nJohn Russell had to withdraw a scheme of parliamentary reform at the\r\noutbreak of the Crimean War, and now wanted to bring it on again,\r\ngreatly to the annoyance of Lord Palmerston, for the War was not yet\r\nover. Prince Albert writes:\r\n\r\n  Later, when they came to the passage about Education, Lord\r\n  John made an alteration in the draft, adding something about\r\n  strengthening the institutions of the country. Lord Palmerston\r\n  started up and asked: “Does that mean Reform?” Lord John answered:\r\n  “It might or might not.” “Well, then,” said Lord Palmerston, with\r\n  a heat of manner which struck the whole Cabinet, and was hardly\r\n  justified by the occasion, “I wish it to be understood that I\r\n  protest against any direct or indirect attempt to bring forward the\r\n  Reform question again!” Lord John, nettled, muttered to himself,\r\n  but loud enough to be heard by everybody: “Then I shall bring\r\n  forward the Reform Bill at once.”\r\n\r\nThat the “King’s Speech” is the Speech of the Ministers has been\r\nadmitted by reigning Sovereigns even in the eighteenth century when\r\nconstitutional monarchy was not quite firmly established, and, at\r\nany rate, when Kings were disposed to act independently of their\r\nadvisers. In 1756, a too enterprising and most audacious bookseller\r\nwas prosecuted for publishing a spurious Speech on the eve of the\r\nopening of Parliament. “I hope,” said George II, “the fellow’s\r\npunishment will be light, for I have read both Speeches, the real and\r\nthe false, and, so far as I understand them, I like the printer’s\r\nspeech better than my own.” The fellow was heavily fined and sent\r\nto Newgate by the Lords and the mock Speech was burnt by the common\r\nhangman in New Palace Yard and at the Royal Exchange as a “scandalous\r\nlibel and a high contempt of his Majesty.” But the King had the\r\nfine remitted and the term of imprisonment curtailed. “Well, Lord\r\nChancellor,” said George III to Lord Eldon, as he was leaving the\r\nHouse of Lords after opening Parliament, “did I deliver the Speech\r\nwell?” “Very well indeed, sir,” was the reply. “I’m surprised at\r\nthat,” said the King, “for there was nothing in it.” The voice was\r\nthe voice of the King, but the words were the words of his Ministers.\r\nStill, the King must surely be allowed some latitude of opinion in\r\nregard to the King’s Speech beyond a formal expression of approval.\r\nThe truth is that if he chooses he may suggest alterations, and\r\ninsist upon them, no doubt, provided modifications of policy are not\r\nimplied. He probably softens an expression now and then, or adds a\r\ngracious sentence. Did not George III insert in his first Speech the\r\nfamous words, “Born and bred in this country, I glory in the name of\r\nBriton!” He was the first English-born King since the Revolution.\r\nGeorge I could not speak a word of English. He and his Prime\r\nMinister, Walpole, discussed affairs of State in bad Latin. George\r\nII publicly proclaimed himself a foreigner every time he read the\r\nSpeech to the “Gendlemen of de Houze of Gommons.” The historic phrase\r\nof George III has been ascribed to the influence of his early friend\r\nand adviser, the Scottish John Stuart, third Earl of Bute, which, it\r\nwas said, explained the degradation of the proud name of “Englishman”\r\ninto the commonplace “Briton.” But the King always insisted that the\r\ninspiration of the sentence, as well as its composition, was entirely\r\nhis own. A story is told which lends confirmation to his claim.\r\nNotwithstanding the birth and training in which he gloried, he wrote\r\nEnglish ungrammatically and was a bad speller; and thus “Briton” in\r\nthe renowned sentence, as written by the royal hand, was actually\r\nmisspelt “Britain.” “What a lustre does it cast upon the name of\r\nBriton when you, sir, are pleased to esteem it among your glories,”\r\nsaid the House of Lords in their Address thanking the King for his\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThat there have been many cases of dispute between the Sovereign and\r\nhis Ministers, in recent years, at least, as to either the measures\r\nset out in the Speech or the phraseology of its sentences is very\r\nunlikely. Only two instances during the long reign of Queen Victoria\r\nhave come to light. In 1859, Austria, struggling to maintain her\r\nposition in Italy, was at war with Sardinia, and the intervention of\r\nFrance on the side of Sardinia was regarded in some circles in this\r\ncountry as a characteristic act of aggression by the Emperor, Louis\r\nNapoleon. The draft of the proposed Speech from the Throne submitted\r\nto Queen Victoria contained the following passages:\r\n\r\n  Receiving assurances of friendship from both the contending\r\n  parties, I intend to maintain a strict and impartial neutrality,\r\n  and hope, with God’s assistance, to preserve to my people the\r\n  blessing of continued peace.\r\n\r\n  I have, however, deemed it necessary, in the present state of\r\n  Europe, with no object of aggression, but for the security of my\r\n  dominions, and for the honour of my Crown, to increase my Naval\r\n  Forces to an amount exceeding that which has been sanctioned by\r\n  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sent to the Premier, Lord Derby, the following criticism:\r\n\r\n                                              BUCKINGHAM PALACE,\r\n                                                       _June 1, 1859_.\r\n\r\n  The Queen takes objection to the wording of the two paragraphs\r\n  about the war and our armaments. As it stands, it conveys the\r\n  impression of a determination on the Queen’s part of maintaining\r\n  a neutrality—_à tout prix_—whatever circumstances may arise which\r\n  would do harm abroad, and be inconvenient at home. What the Queen\r\n  may express is her wish to remain neutral, and her hope that\r\n  circumstances may allow her to do so. The paragraph about the Navy,\r\n  as it stands, makes our position still more humble, as it contains\r\n  a public apology for arming, and yet betrays fear of our being\r\n  attacked by France.\r\n\r\nThe Queen then suggested two amended forms for these passages, in\r\nwhich she said she had taken pains to preserve Lord Derby’s words,\r\nas far as was possible, with an avoidance of the objections before\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n  I continue to receive, at the same time, assurances of friendship\r\n  from both contending parties. It being my anxious desire to\r\n  preserve to my people the blessing of uninterrupted peace, I trust\r\n  in God’s assistance to enable me to maintain a strict and impartial\r\n  neutrality.\r\n\r\n  Considering, however, the present state of Europe, and the\r\n  complications which a war, carried on by some of the Great Powers,\r\n  may produce, I have deemed it necessary, for the security of my\r\n  dominions and the honour of my Crown, to increase my Naval Forces\r\n  to an amount exceeding that which has been sanctioned by Parliament.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, in his reply, contended that the country was unanimous\r\nin favour of a strictly neutral policy. Its sympathies were neither\r\nwith France nor with Austria, but, were it not for the intervention\r\nof France, it would generally be in favour of Italy. He went on to\r\nsay that the Opposition Press were insinuating that the neutrality of\r\nthe Government covered wishes and designs in favour of Austria; and\r\nany words in the Speech from the Throne which should imply a doubt\r\nof strict impartiality would certainly provoke a hostile amendment\r\nin the interest of Sardinia, which might possibly be carried, and\r\nin such circumstances her Majesty would be placed in the painful\r\nposition of having to select an Administration pledged against the\r\ninterests of Austria and of Germany. He thought the Queen’s suggested\r\nwords in regard to the Navy—“complications which a war carried on\r\nby some of the Great Powers may produce”—would inevitably lead to a\r\ndemand for an explanation of the “complications” which the Government\r\nforesaw as likely to lead to war. The Prime Minister went on to say:\r\n\r\n  In humbly tendering to your Majesty his most earnest advice that\r\n  your Majesty will not insist on the proposed Amendments in his\r\n  draft Speech he believes that he may assure your Majesty that he\r\n  is expressing the unanimous opinion of his colleagues. Of their\r\n  sentiments your Majesty may judge by the fact that in the original\r\n  draft he had spoken of your Majesty’s “intention” to preserve peace\r\n  “so long as it might be possible”; but by universal concurrence\r\n  these latter words were struck out; and the “hope” was, instead of\r\n  them, substituted for the “intention.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to this letter, Queen Victoria wrote that there was, in\r\nfact, no difference between her and Lord Derby. She had suggested\r\nthe verbal amendments merely with a view to indicate the nature of\r\nthe difficulty as it presented itself to her. Whatever decision\r\nLord Derby might on further reflection come to, she was prepared\r\nto accept. In the Speech read by the Queen from the Throne the two\r\nparagraphs were somewhat modified in the sense her Majesty desired.\r\n\r\nFive years later, in 1864, another difference arose between Queen\r\nVictoria and her advisers in regard to statements in the Speech.\r\nDenmark and Germany were at war over the right to the Duchies of\r\nSchleswig and Holstein—obtained finally by Germany—and the draft of\r\nthe Speech submitted to Queen Victoria contained a paragraph plainly,\r\nif not menacingly, expressing the sympathy of England with Denmark.\r\nTo this the Queen objected. In her opinion the best policy for this\r\ncountry was to stand neutral, and though the stubborn Palmerston,\r\nwho was then Prime Minister, was, as usual, disposed to show fight,\r\nshe finally had her way. The Speech as read in the House of Lords\r\ndeclared that—\r\n\r\n  Her Majesty has been unremitting in her endeavours to bring about\r\n  a peaceful settlement of the differences which on this matter have\r\n  arisen between Germany and Denmark, and to ward off the dangers\r\n  which might follow from a beginning of warfare in the North of\r\n  Europe, and her Majesty will continue her efforts in the interest\r\n  of peace.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient for the King formally to express approval of\r\nthe draft of the Speech submitted to him by his advisers. He must\r\nsign the Speech in the presence of the Ministers, thus giving them a\r\nguarantee of assurance that he will deliver that particular Speech,\r\nand no other, to the two Houses of Parliament. Consequently, at a\r\nmeeting of the “King in Council,” or, in other words, the Privy\r\nCouncil, at which, however, only Cabinet Ministers are present, the\r\nKing endorses the Speech with his signature. When next his Majesty\r\nsees the Speech, a printed copy of it is presented to him on the\r\nThrone of the House of Lords by the kneeling Lord Chancellor in the\r\npresence of the Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Speech is written in a prescribed form. Each one bears the\r\nclosest resemblance outwardly to its predecessors. It is divided into\r\nthree sections. The first section, addressed generally to Members of\r\nboth Houses, “My Lords and Gentlemen,” deals exclusively with foreign\r\naffairs; then there is a brief paragraph referring to the Estimates,\r\nwhich specially concerns “Gentlemen of the House of Commons,” as the\r\nsole custodians and guardians of the public purse (or “Members of the\r\nHouse of Commons” as the phrase became when the first female Member,\r\nLady Astor, was elected in 1919); and the third section, which opens\r\nagain with “My Lords and Gentlemen,” contains some general remarks on\r\nhome affairs, and sets out the legislative programme of the Session.\r\n“I pray,” the Speech usually concludes, “that Almighty God may\r\ncontinue to guide you in the conduct of your deliberations, and bless\r\nthem with success.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThese Speeches possess a double interest, as the literary\r\ncompositions and the political manifestoes of the most eminent\r\nstatesmen of the Nation. To me it has been a pleasant occupation\r\ndipping into them, here and there, in the volumes of _Hansard_ and\r\nextracting a few notes personal to the Sovereign, or references\r\nto some of the great political issues of the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century and the opening decades of the twentieth. There\r\nis a popular supposition that “the King’s Speeches” are the worst\r\npossible models of “the King’s English.” The condemnation is too\r\nsweeping. Unquestionably there are Speeches with sentences doubtful\r\nin grammar, as well as feeble and pointless. The writing of most\r\nof them, however, is pure and concise. It is possible to trace in\r\nthem the characteristic styles and different moods of mind of the\r\nPrime Ministers by whom they were written. Disraeli’s Speeches stand\r\nput as the most ornate. He used more rhetoric than other Premiers\r\ndeemed to be necessary or desirable. In one there is a picture of\r\n“the elephants of Asia carrying the artillery of Europe over the\r\nmountains of Rasselas”; in another the founding of British Columbia\r\ncalls up a vision of her Majesty’s dominions in North America\r\n“peopled by an unbroken chain, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, of a\r\nloyal and industrious population of subjects of the British Crown.”\r\nNothing could be more effective from an elocutionary point of view.\r\nThe “Speeches” of Lord Melbourne trembled at times on the verge of\r\npuerility. Palmerston’s waved the Union Jack in relation to foreign\r\naffairs, and his off-hand “Ha, ha!” was heard in references to things\r\ndomestic. Gladstone and Salisbury drafted “Speeches” equally noted\r\nfor freshness and strength of expression. Lloyd George composed\r\nthe longest and most comprehensive and possibly the most historic\r\n“Speeches”—those that immediately followed the conclusion of the\r\nWorld War. They were obviously addressed not so much to Lords and\r\nCommons as to the people at large.\r\n\r\n  The early age at which I am called to the sovereignty of this\r\n  Kingdom renders it a more imperative duty that under Divine\r\n  Providence I should place my reliance upon your cordial\r\n  co-operation, and upon the loyal affection of all my people. I\r\n  ascend the Throne with a deep sense of the responsibility which\r\n  is imposed upon me; but I am supported by the consciousness of my\r\n  own right intentions, and by my dependence upon the protection of\r\n  Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThese are the concluding words of the Speech from the Throne read\r\nby Victoria, the girl-Queen, to her first Parliament, on November\r\n20, 1837. “Never,” wrote Mrs. Kemble, “have I heard any spoken words\r\nmore musical in their gentle distinctness than the ‘My Lords and\r\nGentlemen’ which broke the breathless stillness of the illustrious\r\nassembly, whose gaze was riveted on that fair flower of Royalty.”\r\nIt was a new Parliament, fresh from the country, after the General\r\nElection which, as the law then required, followed the demise of the\r\nCrown owing to the death of William IV. The scene on that historic\r\noccasion in the old House of Lords was most brilliant. To the right\r\nof the young Queen stood her mother, the Duchess of Kent. On her\r\nleft was Viscount Melbourne, the Prime Minister. At the foot of the\r\nThrone were grouped other great officers of State. The benches were\r\ncrowded with peers in their robes—amongst whom Wellington, Brougham,\r\nLyndhurst, were distinguished figures—and with peeresses in Court\r\nplumes and diamonds. At the Bar were assembled the Commons, Mr.\r\nSpeaker Abercromby at their head, and in the throng might be seen\r\nsuch eminent statesmen and notabilities as Lord John Russell, Sir\r\nRobert Peel, Lord Palmerston, Daniel O’Connell, Stanley (afterwards\r\nLord Derby), and two young Members, Gladstone, who already had four\r\nyears’ experience of Parliament, and Disraeli, just returned at the\r\nGeneral Election for Maidstone, who were destined to become the two\r\ngreatest political protagonists of the nineteenth century. Writing to\r\nhis sister on November 21, 1837, Disraeli thus comically describes\r\nhow the Commons went to the House of Lords, and what they saw there:\r\n\r\n  The rush was terrific; Abercromby himself nearly thrown down and\r\n  trampled upon, and his macebearer banging the Members’ heads with\r\n  his gorgeous weapon and cracking skulls with impunity. I was\r\n  fortunate enough to escape, however, and also to ensure an entry.\r\n  It was a magnificent spectacle. The Queen looked admirable; no\r\n  feathers, but a diamond tiara. The peers in robes, the peeresses\r\n  and the sumptuous groups of courtiers rendered the affair most\r\n  glittering and imposing.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between this splendid and joyful ceremony and the\r\npathetic scene that was witnessed in the same Chamber, just a year\r\nearlier, when Parliament was opened by William IV for the last\r\ntime! The aged King, wrapped in his ample purple robes, and his\r\ngrey locks surmounted by the Imperial Crown, stood on the Throne\r\nstruggling with dim eyes in the twilight of the Chamber to read the\r\nSpeech prepared for him by Lord Melbourne. He stammered slowly, and\r\nalmost inaudibly, through the first few sentences, pausing now and\r\nthen over a difficult word, and querulously appealing to the Prime\r\nMinister “What is it, Melbourne?” loudly enough to be heard by the\r\nAssembly. At last, losing all patience, he angrily exclaimed, in\r\nthe full-blooded language of the period, “Damn it, I can’t see!”\r\nCandles were instantly brought in and placed beside the King. “My\r\nLords and Gentlemen,” said he, “I have hitherto not been able,\r\nfor want of light, to read this Speech in a way its importance\r\ndeserves; but as lights are now brought me, I will read it again from\r\nthe commencement, and in a way which, I trust, will command your\r\nattention.” Then in a pitiful effort to prove to Peers and Commons\r\nthat his mental and physical powers were by no means failing, he\r\ncommenced the Speech again and read it through in a fairly clear\r\nvoice and with some emphasis.\r\n\r\nIt was at the opening of the third session of the first Parliament\r\nof Queen Victoria, on January 16, 1840, Lord Melbourne being still\r\nPremier, that her Majesty read from her Speech the announcement of\r\nher approaching marriage to Prince Albert. Writing to the Prince a\r\nfew days previously, she said the reading of the Speech was always\r\na nervous proceeding, and it would be made an “awful affair” by the\r\nannouncement of her engagement. “I have never failed yet,” she added,\r\n“and this is the sixth time that I have done it, and yet I am just as\r\nfrightened as if I had never done it before. They say that feeling of\r\nnervousness is never got over, and that William Pitt himself never\r\ngot up to make a speech without thinking he should fail. But then I\r\nonly read my speech.” The passage in the Speech from the Throne in\r\nreference to her marriage is as follows:\r\n\r\n  My Lords and Gentlemen,—Since you were last assembled I have\r\n  declared my intention of allying myself in marriage with Prince\r\n  Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. I humbly implore that the Divine\r\n  blessing may prosper this union, and render it conducive to the\r\n  interests of my people, as well as to my own domestic happiness;\r\n  and it will be to me a source of the most lively satisfaction to\r\n  find the resolution I have taken approved by my Parliament. The\r\n  constant proofs which I have received of your attachment to my\r\n  person and family persuade me that you will enable me to provide\r\n  for such an establishment as may appear suitable to the rank of the\r\n  Prince and the dignity of the Crown.\r\n\r\nMrs. Simpson, in her _Many Memories of Many People_, writes that\r\nher first recollection of the opening of Parliament was on this\r\nauspicious occasion. “I sat up in a little gallery over the Woolsack\r\nbetween the beautiful Lady Dufferin and Miss Pitt,” she says. “I\r\nremember well the Queen’s sweet voice and that the paper shook in\r\nher hand. By her side stood Lord Melbourne, repeating inaudibly—we\r\ncould see his lips move—every word she uttered.”\r\n\r\nOn the next occasion her Majesty opened Parliament, February 3, 1842,\r\nSir Robert Peel being Prime Minister, she announced in the Speech\r\nanother joyful event in her domestic life, the birth of the Prince of\r\nWales, which took place on November 9, 1841. The Speech said:\r\n\r\n  My Lords and Gentlemen,—I cannot meet you in Parliament assembled\r\n  without making a public acknowledgment of my gratitude to Almighty\r\n  God on account of the birth of the Prince, my son—an event which\r\n  has completed the measure of my domestic happiness, and has been\r\n  hailed with every demonstration of affectionate attachment to my\r\n  person and government by my faithful and loyal people.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Consort died on December 14, 1861, at the early age of\r\nforty-two years. At the opening by Commission of the next session\r\nof Parliament, Lord Palmerston being Prime Minister, the domestic\r\naffliction of the Sovereign was thus announced in “the Queen’s\r\nSpeech”:\r\n\r\n  My Lords and Gentlemen,—We are commanded by her Majesty to assure\r\n  you that her Majesty is persuaded that you will deeply participate\r\n  in the affliction by which her Majesty has been overwhelmed by the\r\n  calamitous, untimely and irreparable loss of her beloved Consort,\r\n  who has been her comfort and support. It has been, however,\r\n  soothing to her Majesty, while suffering most acutely under this\r\n  awful dispensation of Providence, to receive from all classes of\r\n  her subjects the most cordial assurances of their sympathy with her\r\n  sorrow, as well as their appreciation of the noble character of\r\n  him, the greatness of whose loss to her Majesty and to the nation\r\n  is so justly and so universally felt and lamented.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nSix years elapsed before Queen Victoria was seen again at\r\nWestminster. She opened the Conservative Parliament which assembled\r\non February 10, 1866. The ceremony, by her command, was plain and\r\nsimple. She declined to wear the purple robe of State, and had it\r\nplaced over the Chair of the Throne. Her attire consisted of a black\r\ndress and a widow’s white cap, the only touch of bright colour being\r\nthe blue sash of the Garter across her breast. For the first time\r\nalso she did not read the Speech from the Throne. She reverted to an\r\nancient practice by deputing the Lord Chancellor, Cranworth, to read\r\nit. The Speech announced the termination of the long and bloody Civil\r\nWar in America. “The abolition of slavery,” it added, “is an event\r\ncalling forth the cordial sympathies and congratulations of this\r\ncountry, which has always been foremost in showing its abhorrence for\r\nan institution repugnant to every feeling of justice and humanity.”\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria next opened the first session of the Liberal\r\nParliament on February 11, 1869, in which Gladstone for the first\r\ntime was Prime Minister. The great measure of that session was the\r\nBill for the disestablishment and disendowment of the Church in\r\nIreland. “The ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland,” said the\r\nQueen’s Speech, “will be brought under your consideration at a very\r\nearly date.” It went on to say:\r\n\r\n  I am persuaded that in the prosecution of the work you will bear\r\n  careful regard to every legitimate interest which it may involve,\r\n  and that you will be governed by the constant aim to promote the\r\n  welfare of religion through the principles of equal justice, to\r\n  secure the action of the individual feeling and opinion of Ireland\r\n  on the side of loyalty and law, to efface the memory of former\r\n  contentions and to cherish the sympathies of an affectionate people.\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for the meeting of Parliament in the following\r\nyear, 1870, Gladstone was most anxious that it should be opened by\r\nthe Queen. The chief business was to be a Bill dealing with the\r\nIrish land question. Gladstone said to Lord Granville: “It would be\r\nalmost a crime in a Minister to omit anything that might serve to\r\nmark and bring home to the minds of men the gravity of the occasion.”\r\n“Moreover,” he added, “I am persuaded that the Queen’s own sympathies\r\nwould be—not as last year—in the same current as ours.” This shows\r\nhow important it was for the success of the Government’s legislative\r\nprogramme that Parliament should, in the opinion of Gladstone, be\r\nopened with the impressiveness that attends the ceremony when it is\r\nperformed by the Sovereign in person. But her Majesty was unable,\r\nor disinclined, to comply with his request. The opening passage\r\nof the Speech from the Throne is significant, in the light of\r\nwhat happened—as we now know—behind the scenes. It runs: “We have\r\nit in command from her Majesty again to invite you to resume your\r\narduous duties, and to express the regret of her Majesty that recent\r\nindisposition has prevented her from meeting you in person, as had\r\nbeen her intention, at a period of remarkable public interest.”\r\n\r\nThe last time that Queen Victoria appeared at Westminster was on\r\nJanuary 21, 1886, at the assembling of a new Parliament, with the\r\nConservatives in office but not in power. “The Queen’s Speech” which\r\nwas read on that occasion was perhaps—having regard to what occurred\r\nsubsequently in Parliament—the most remarkable of Victoria’s long\r\nreign. The session of 1886, which was destined to be made historic\r\nby Gladstone’s first attempt to carry Home Rule, was opened with a\r\nSpeech from the Throne strongly reprobating any disturbance of the\r\nLegislative Union.\r\n\r\nThe events which led up to this extraordinary constitutional\r\nsituation may be briefly related. In June 1885 the Gladstone\r\nAdministration, defeated on an amendment to their Budget condemning\r\nthe increases proposed in the beer and spirit duties, resigned, and\r\nthey were succeeded by a Conservative Government, with Lord Salisbury\r\nas Prime Minister for the first time. There was a General Election in\r\nNovember, and the Liberals came back from the polls in triumph. The\r\nGovernment, although in a minority, did not resign. They decided to\r\nmeet Parliament, not to put their fortune to the test, for they knew\r\nthat was hopeless, but in order to have a Speech from the Throne in\r\nwhich there should be an emphatic declaration against any attempt to\r\ndisturb the legislative relations between Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nand the session was opened in person by Queen Victoria to show her\r\nsympathy with the maintenance of the Union. The Speech from the\r\nThrone, as in every instance of the opening of Parliament by the\r\nQueen since the death of the Prince Consort, was read by the Lord\r\nChancellor. The principal passage, relating to the Irish situation,\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have seen with deep sorrow the renewal, since I last addressed\r\n  you, of the attempt to excite the people of Ireland to hostility\r\n  against the Legislative Union between that country and Great\r\n  Britain. I am resolutely opposed to any disturbance of that\r\n  fundamental law, and in resisting it I am convinced that I shall be\r\n  supported by my Parliament and my people.\r\n\r\nThat Gladstone was committed to Home Rule was well known at the\r\ntime, and it was hoped by the Conservatives that this declaration\r\nwould prove embarrassing to him. Five days later the Government were\r\ndefeated on an amendment to the Address in reply to the Speech in\r\nfavour of small allotments for agricultural labourers. Gladstone\r\nonce again returned to office. The new Liberal Government accepted\r\nthe Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, drawn up by\r\ntheir Conservative predecessors, only adding to it the amendment\r\nexpressing regret that there was no promise in the Speech of\r\nlegislation to enable agricultural labourers to obtain allotments and\r\nsmall holdings. At that time the Address was an echo of the Speech\r\nitself. The Sovereign was thanked, separately and specifically, for\r\nevery expression of promise, hope or regret contained in the Speech.\r\nHere is one sentence from the Address, agreed to by the Liberal\r\nGovernment, which, in view of the introduction of the Home Rule Bill\r\nby Gladstone as Prime Minister a few months later, is one of the\r\ncuriosities of constitutional history:\r\n\r\n  We humbly thank your Majesty for informing us that your Majesty\r\n  has seen with deep sorrow the renewal, since your Majesty last\r\n  addressed us, of the attempt to excite the people of Ireland to\r\n  hostility against the Legislative Union between that country and\r\n  Great Britain; that your Majesty is resolutely opposed to any\r\n  disturbance of that fundamental law; and that in resisting it your\r\n  Majesty is convinced that your Majesty will be heartily supported\r\n  by your Parliament and your People.\r\n\r\nSure enough, the Home Rule Bill brought in by the Prime Minister in\r\nJune was rejected by a majority of thirty.\r\n\r\nKing Edward VII opened his first Parliament on February 14, 1901,\r\nthe Unionists being in office and Lord Salisbury Prime Minister. His\r\nMajesty said:\r\n\r\n  I address you for the first time at a moment of national sorrow,\r\n  when the whole country is mourning the irreparable loss which we\r\n  have so recently sustained, and which has fallen with peculiar\r\n  severity upon myself. My beloved Mother, during her long and\r\n  glorious reign, has set an example before the world of what a\r\n  monarch should be. It is my earnest desire to walk in her footsteps.\r\n\r\nOf the Speeches of King George V, one of the most interesting was\r\nthat which he read at the opening of Parliament in 1914—six months\r\nbefore the outbreak of the Great War—when the country was in turmoil\r\nover the question of Home Rule and seemed to be drifting into Civil\r\nWar. One of its passages was said at the time to have been personally\r\nwritten by the King, with a view to mitigating the excesses of Party\r\nspirit. It runs:\r\n\r\n  I regret that the efforts which have been made to arrive at a\r\n  solution by agreement of the problems connected with the Government\r\n  of Ireland have, so far, not succeeded. In a matter in which the\r\n  hopes and the fears of so many of my subjects are keenly concerned,\r\n  and which, unless handled now with foresight, judgment, and in the\r\n  spirit of mutual concession, threatens grave future difficulties,\r\n  it is My most earnest wish that the good will and co-operation\r\n  of men of all Parties and creeds may heal dissension and lay the\r\n  foundations of a lasting settlement.\r\n\r\nIt was the good fortune of George V to be able to announce at the\r\nopening of the new Parliament on February 11, 1919, “the end of the\r\nstruggle between German tyranny and European freedom” and “the dawn\r\nof a new era.” The Speech was of unprecedented length, as well as of\r\nhistoric importance. One of its most striking passages was this:\r\n\r\n  To build a better Britain we must stop at no sacrifice of\r\n  interest or prejudice to stamp out unmerited poverty, to diminish\r\n  unemployment and mitigate its sufferings, to provide decent homes,\r\n  to improve the nation’s health, and to raise the standard of\r\n  well-being throughout the community.\r\n\r\nNever before was the question of the condition of the people enlarged\r\nupon so emphatically and boldly in the Speech from the Throne. His\r\nMajesty added the warning:\r\n\r\n  We shall not achieve this end by undue tenderness towards\r\n  acknowledged abuses, and it must necessarily be retarded by\r\n  violence and even by disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nFor many years the Commons went to the House of Lords in a way that\r\nwas most unseemly in answer to the message of Black Rod, to hear\r\nthe Speech from the Throne read by the Sovereign. So great was the\r\nrush and crush at one of the earlier openings of Parliament by Queen\r\nVictoria, that Joseph Hume, as he bitterly complained in the House of\r\nCommons, neither saw her Majesty nor heard her voice, although he was\r\nwithin touch of the Speaker as he stood at the Bar. “I was crushed\r\ninto a corner,” he said, “my head being knocked against a post,\r\nand I might have been much injured if a stout Member had not come\r\nto my assistance.” Dickens, who was present at the ceremony a few\r\nyears later, said the Speaker was like a schoolmaster with a mob of\r\nunmannerly boys at his heels. “He is propelled,” the novelist wrote,\r\n“to the Bar of the House with the frantic fear of being knocked down\r\nand trampled upon by the rush of M.P.’s.” In 1851 the Speaker was so\r\npushed and hustled that his wig was knocked awry and his robe torn.\r\nFrank Hugh O’Donnell relates in his book on _The Irish Parliamentary\r\nParty_ how at one opening of Parliament in the later ’seventies he\r\nsaved Disraeli from being knocked down by squaring his shoulders and\r\nelbows to keep off the pressure of the mob of M.P.’s from the frail\r\nperson of the Prime Minister. Disraeli sent his secretary, Montagu\r\nCory, to thank O’Donnell. The last time such a scene was enacted was\r\nin 1901, at the first opening of Parliament by King Edward. Since\r\n1902 the Strangers’ Gallery of the House of Lords has been set apart\r\nfor Members of the House of Commons, and they are allowed access to\r\nit before the King appears in the Chamber and Black Rod is sent to\r\ncommand the attendance of the Commons at the Bar. It is a spectacle\r\nwell worth seeing—the King crowned and in his purple robes and\r\nstanding on the Throne, surrounded by his Ministers, addressing the\r\nassembled Lords and Commons. It is the most noble and impressive\r\nsight to be seen at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe Speech is read in both Houses—in the Lords by the Lord\r\nChancellor, in the Commons by the Speaker—when they reassemble after\r\nthe ceremony of the opening of Parliament by the King. But before\r\nthis is done each House gives a first reading to a Bill, in obedience\r\nto a Standing Order in the Lords, and in the Commons by ancient\r\ncustom. The incident escapes the attention of most Lords and Commons,\r\nso unostentatiously is it done, and probably its constitutional\r\nsignificance is lost to most of those who may chance to notice it.\r\nIn the Lords the Bill is called “Select Vestries Bill,” and in the\r\nCommons the “Bill for the more effectual Preventing of Clandestine\r\nOutlawries.” It may seem a matter of form, the procedure being that\r\nthe Clerk in each House simply reads the title of his Bill, but it\r\nis meant to assert the right of Parliament to act as it thinks fit,\r\nwithout reference to any outside authority, to debate matters other\r\nthan “the causes of summons” set forth in the Speech from the Throne.\r\nNeither of these Bills is ever heard of again during the session.\r\nThe Outlawries Bill, which does service in the House of Commons,\r\nhas been preserved in the drawers of the Table since the opening of\r\nthe present Chamber in 1852. For one moment, at the opening of each\r\nsession, it is produced by the Clerk, and is seen no more for another\r\ntwelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nDEBATE ON THE ADDRESS TO THE KING\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe Commons hear the Speech from the Throne twice—by the Sovereign\r\nin the House of Lords and again at its subsequent recital in their\r\nown Chamber by the Speaker. Macaulay states in his _History_ that\r\nthe first Speech of James II to Parliament in 1685—notable for its\r\nextraordinary admonition to the Commons, that if they wished to\r\nmeet frequently they must treat him generously in the matter of\r\nsupplies—was greeted with loud cheers by the Tory Members assembled\r\nat the Bar of the House of Lords. “Such acclamations were then\r\nusual,” says the historian. “It has now been during many years\r\nthe grave and decorous usage of Parliaments to hear in respectful\r\nsilence all expressions, acceptable or unacceptable, which are\r\nuttered from the Throne.” The recital of the King’s Speech by Mr.\r\nSpeaker to the House of Commons was unmarked by any demonstration of\r\nParty feeling for two centuries and a quarter. But at the opening\r\nof the last session of the Balfour Parliament, in February 1905,\r\nthere was a breach of the traditional decorum, which, as a change in\r\nparliamentary manners, is noteworthy enough to be placed on record.\r\nThe promise in the Speech of economy, “so far as the circumstances\r\nof the case admitted,” was received with derisive laughter on the\r\nOpposition benches, while the mention of the “prospect” of a promised\r\nRedistribution Bill, by which Ireland was to lose twenty-two seats,\r\nprovoked loud and angry cries of defiance from the Irish Members.\r\nSince then the reading of the Speech by the Speaker in the Commons,\r\nwhether at the opening of a new Parliament or a new session,\r\nis usually greeted with Ministerial shouts of approbation or\r\nOpposition cries of dissent. These Party cheers constitute a complete\r\nacknowledgment that the King’s Speech is the speech, not of the King,\r\nbut of his Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIn each House a motion for an Address to the King for his “most\r\ngracious Speech” is submitted on behalf of the Government. The\r\nproposer and seconder of the Address in each House are in uniform or\r\nfull dress. This is the only occasion, be it noted, when a Member,\r\nwhether of the Peerage or of the Commons, is permitted to appear in\r\nParliament otherwise than in civilian clothes, a rule which, probably\r\nin the history of Parliament, was suspended only during the Great\r\nWar, when many Members wore khaki. The uniforms of the Militia or\r\nYeomanry are much affected, and, failing the commission to wear\r\nthem, Court costume or levee dress is the rule. Another order, which\r\nprohibits Members of either House from “carrying a lethal weapon,” is\r\nalso suspended for the occasion in favour of the sword of the soldier\r\nor courtier. There is, however, one instance of the Address having\r\nbeen seconded by a Member who wore no costume of ceremony. That was\r\nwhen Charles Fenwick, the Labour representative, who at the opening\r\nof the first session of the Liberal Parliament of 1893-95 discharged\r\nthat function in his ordinary everyday clothes.\r\n\r\nIn March 1894 the same Liberal Administration being in office—save\r\nthat Lord Rosebery had succeeded Gladstone as Premier—an amendment to\r\nthe Address moved by Labouchere, Member for Northampton, hostile to\r\nthe House of Lords, was carried against the Government by the narrow\r\nmajority of two—147 votes to 145. It declared “that the power now\r\nenjoyed by persons not elected to Parliament by the possessors of\r\nthe parliamentary franchise to prevent Bills being submitted to your\r\nMajesty for your Royal approval shall cease,” and expressed the hope\r\nthat “if it be necessary your Majesty will, with and by the advice of\r\nyour responsible Ministers, use the powers vested in your Majesty to\r\nsecure the passing of this much-needed reform.” The method suggested\r\nby Labouchere was the creation of 500 peers who would be willing to\r\ncarry through the House of Lords a Bill for the abolition of that\r\nChamber and themselves. Sir William Harcourt, Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer and Leader of the House of Commons, declined to treat the\r\nreverse as a vote of censure, or to add the amendment to the Address.\r\n“The Address in answer to the Speech from the Throne,” said he, “is\r\na proceeding for which her Majesty’s Government make themselves\r\nresponsible—responsible as the representatives of the majority in\r\nthe House of Commons from whom that Address proceeds. I think that\r\nis a clear constitutional principle which nobody will be disposed\r\nto dispute. The Government could not present to the Sovereign in a\r\nformal manner a document of which they are not prepared to accept the\r\nentire and immediate responsibility.” He concluded by inviting the\r\nHouse to negative the amended Address, and to adopt a new Address,\r\nwhich simply assured her Majesty “that the measures recommended to\r\nour consideration shall receive our most careful attention.” This\r\nmotion was seconded by John Morley.\r\n\r\nThe fact that neither of these Ministers wore Court dress or uniform\r\nled that humourist, Colonel Saunderson, Member for North Armagh,\r\nto indulge in a characteristic joke. Rising to a point of order,\r\nhe asked the Speaker whether it was not contrary to the immemorial\r\npractice of the House for the mover of the Address to appear without\r\nthe uniform befitting his rank? If, he continued, the Speaker\r\nshould answer that question in the affirmative, he would move the\r\nadjournment of the House for twenty minutes, so as to give the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer an opportunity of arraying himself in\r\ngarments suitable to the occasion. The Speaker took no notice of\r\nthe question, for, of course, it was not seriously intended. What\r\nColonel Saunderson wanted was a laugh, and that he got in the fullest\r\nmeasure. The incident, unprecedented in parliamentary history, ended\r\nwith the unanimous adoption of the new Address.\r\n\r\nAnother strange thing happened in relation to the Speech from the\r\nThrone at the opening of a new session on February 12, 1918. I was in\r\nthe Reporters’ Gallery of the House of Lords when the Lord Chancellor\r\nread the Speech at the reassembling of the House after the opening\r\nceremony by the King. As he was reading the document, Lord Curzon,\r\nLeader of the House, handed him a slip of paper. The Lord Chancellor\r\nthen said that the following passage had been accidentally omitted\r\nfrom the printed copy of the King’s Speech, which was supplied to him\r\nand distributed to their lordships:\r\n\r\n  I have summoned representatives of my Dominions and of my Indian\r\n  Empire to a further session of the Imperial War Cabinet in order\r\n  that I may again receive their advice on questions of moment\r\n  affecting the common interests of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt had also been omitted, by some oversight, from the copy of the\r\nSpeech given by the Lord Chancellor to the King to read from the\r\nThrone. Attention was called to the matter in the House of Commons.\r\nThe Member for Carlisle, Mr. Denman, pointed out that this paragraph\r\nwas to be found in the Lords’ record of the King’s Speech, but not in\r\nthe record of the King’s Speech printed in the Votes and Proceedings\r\nof the Commons. He thought it desirable that the records of both\r\nHouses as to what was actually contained in the King’s Speech should\r\nbe identical. The Speaker, Mr. Lowther, said the hon. Member seemed\r\nto want him to put into the mouth of the King words which his Majesty\r\ndid not use—a remark that was received with laughter. He explained\r\nthat the copy of the Speech which he had read to the Commons had\r\nbeen supplied to him by the Home Secretary, and he assumed it to be\r\naccurate. It was brought to his notice afterwards that the copy of\r\nthe Speech which he had read did not correspond with the copy which\r\nhad been read by the King, and therefore he caused the official\r\nrecord to be amended so as to correspond exactly with the actual\r\nSpeech which his Majesty had read from the Throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIt is a compliment to be invited to move or second the motion for the\r\nAddress in reply to the Speech. Young Ministerialists of promise in\r\nthe House of Commons are generally selected for the distinction. As\r\na rule, one represents an urban and the other a rural constituency;\r\none is associated with agriculture and the other with trade. The\r\ndebate which follows is always of interest, and usually is a good\r\ntest of the debating quality of the House. The Opposition give battle\r\nto the Ministerialists. The policy of the Government is attacked\r\nalong the whole line in a series of amendments to the Address.\r\n\r\nIn former times the Address—as I have already mentioned—used to be an\r\nelaborate answer to the Speech, paragraph by paragraph, expressing\r\napproval of its every declaration, and thanking the Sovereign in each\r\ninstance for the great condescension and wisdom of his words. This\r\npractice was abandoned owing to the waste of time it involved, and\r\nfor many years the Address has assumed a more simple and rational\r\nform. From the Commons it consists of a simple resolution in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  That a humble Address be presented to his Majesty, as followeth:\r\n\r\n  Most Gracious Sovereign,—We, your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal\r\n  subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\n  Ireland in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank your Majesty\r\n  for the most gracious Speech which your Majesty has addressed to\r\n  both Houses of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Addresses from the Lords and Commons, in reply to the Speech,\r\nwere at one time presented to the Sovereign at Buckingham Palace,\r\nnominally by “the whole House” in each case, but really by the\r\nLord Chancellor for the Lords and by the Speaker for the Commons,\r\neach being attended by the proposer and seconder and a few of the\r\nMinisters in either House. All the Members of each House, however,\r\nwere supposed to have the privilege of “free access” to the Throne\r\non these occasions; and, moreover, they might, if they so pleased,\r\nenter the presence of the Sovereign in ordinary attire, instead of\r\nin the regulation gold-braided coat and knee-breeches. The ceremony\r\nof presenting the Address by the whole House is now obsolete.\r\nThe course which has been followed in recent years is that the\r\nAddresses are presented by two Ministers who are members of the Royal\r\nHousehold. These Ministers also bring back to both Houses the King’s\r\nacknowledgment of the Addresses.\r\n\r\nA message from the Crown, or, as it is styled officially, “a message\r\nunder the Royal sign-manual,” is presented to both Houses with some\r\nceremony. In the Lords, the Lord Steward of the Household, wearing\r\nhis official uniform, holding a white wand in one hand and a roll of\r\nparchment in the other, rises in his place at an opportune moment\r\nand announces that he has a message from the King. He then hands his\r\nroll of parchment to the Lord Chancellor, who reads it to the House.\r\nIn the Commons the incident is perhaps a little more picturesque.\r\nThe Comptroller of the Household appears at the Bar unannounced.\r\nUnlike the incursions of “Black Rod” from the House of Lords, who is\r\nalways heralded by the loud cry of the door-keeper, and must knock\r\nat the door to obtain admittance, the Royal Messenger who brings the\r\nKing’s acknowledgment of the Address has free entry to the House.\r\nHe comes in, without fuss or noise, and, his duty discharged, is\r\nallowed to depart silently and in peace. Standing at the Bar, in\r\nhis dark uniform relieved by a liberal display of gold braid and\r\ngilt buttons, and carrying his long white wand, he announces to the\r\nHouse—the Speaker standing and the Members uncovering while the\r\nMessage from the King is being delivered—that he brings his Majesty’s\r\nmost grateful thanks for the Address from his faithful Commons. Then\r\nadvancing to the Table, he hands the document to the Clerk, and it\r\nis passed on to the Speaker, by whom it is read to the House. The\r\nComptroller of the Royal Household retires, stepping backwards,\r\nbowing to the Chair, until the Bar is reached, when, turning round,\r\nhe disappears through the swing-doors. But this happens a week or\r\nmore after the Address has been adopted, and the work of Parliament\r\nhas begun in real earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE SERJEANT-AT-ARMS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n“Order, order!” These are the words that are most frequently heard in\r\nthe House of Commons. They run like a refrain, appealing, warning,\r\nand, at times, even menacing, through the babble and confusion of\r\nthe Party conflict. “Order, order!” Members shout at each other with\r\nbitterness and defiance across the floor. “Order, order!” cries Mr.\r\nSpeaker, when he observes any breach of decorum or rises to intervene\r\nin an altercation.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous object in the House of Commons is a large armchair of\r\nheavy oak, upholstered in dark green leather, at the Bar, raised a\r\nfew feet above the level of the floor, just inside the swing-doors of\r\nthe main entrance to the Chamber. It is the Serjeant-at-Arms’ chair.\r\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms is the chief executive officer of the House of\r\nCommons. He it is who is charged with the duty of preserving decorum\r\nin the Chamber and its precincts, of executing the warrants of the\r\nHouse against persons it has adjudged guilty of breaches of its\r\nprivileges or contempt of its dignity; and it is he who backs with\r\nforce, when force is necessary, the “Order, order!” of Mr. Speaker.\r\nHe sits in his chair, facing the Speaker, picturesquely clad in a\r\nblack cutaway coat, open at the breast to show the daintiest of\r\nruffles in the whitest of cambric (of which fops in the times of the\r\nGeorges were so fond), knee-breeches, black silk stockings, and shoes\r\nwith silver buckles; and, as the symbol of the power and authority of\r\nhis office, a rapier in its scabbard is girt to his side. His voice\r\nis very rarely heard in the House. It is seldom necessary for the\r\nSpeaker to give him an order in words, and a reply or explanation\r\nfrom him is scarcely ever needed.\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms is appointed by the King personally. An officer\r\nof his Majesty’s Forces—alternately soldier and sailor—usually\r\ngets the position. He is styled “Serjeant-at-Arms in Ordinary to\r\nhis Majesty,” and his duty is, as described in the patent of his\r\nappointment, “to attend upon his Majesty when there is no Parliament,\r\nand for the time of every Parliament to attend upon the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons.” He has a salary of £1,200 and an official\r\nresidence in the Palace of Westminster. The Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms,\r\nwho, wearing the same official dress as the Serjeant-at-Arms, takes\r\nturns at sitting on guard in the big chair at the Bar, has a salary\r\nof £800 a year, and also lives in the Palace rent free. There is\r\nalso an assistant Serjeant-at-Arms, who usually attends to the\r\nadministrative work of the office outside the Chamber. He has £500\r\na year and £150 as an allowance for a house. The department of the\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms costs about £14,000 a year, for, in addition to his\r\ndeputy and assistant, there are also two door-keepers and eighteen\r\nmessengers (recognized by their brass chains and badges of Mercury),\r\nwho are his first reserves in the maintenance of order in the House.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone to “strangers” who have offended the dignity and\r\nmajesty of the House of Commons that the Serjeant-at-Arms is an\r\nawe-inspiring personage. Even the representatives of the people may\r\nhave occasion to shiver at the dread touch of his hand on their\r\nshoulder. Of the large number of new Members returned at a General\r\nElection few are probably aware of the fact (which, indeed, is not\r\ngenerally known even to old Members) that the Clock Tower contains\r\na suite of rooms for the confinement of representatives who may\r\nbe pronounced guilty by the House of some serious breach of its\r\nprivileges or some outrage on its decorum. A Member of Parliament\r\narrested on the warrant of the Speaker was formerly sent, like\r\nstrangers guilty of breaches of privilege, to Newgate or to the\r\nTower. But in the building of the Palace of Westminster prison\r\naccommodation was specially provided for Members and strangers\r\ncommitted by the House to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\nThe prison of the House of Commons is not, however, a dungeon vile,\r\ndeep down below the vaults of the Palace, a dark and slimy place into\r\nwhich the light of day never enters. It is situated about half-way up\r\nthe Clock Tower, and under the home of that popular London celebrity,\r\nBig Ben, probably the best known clock in the whole world. There are\r\ntwo suites of apartments, each consisting of two bedrooms—one for the\r\nprisoner and the other for one of the Serjeant-at-Arms’ messengers,\r\nwho acts as gaoler—and a sitting-room. There is, therefore,\r\naccommodation for two prisoners and two gaolers in the Clock Tower,\r\nwhich so far has been found more than sufficient.\r\n\r\nAccess to these rooms is obtained only through the residence of\r\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms, who is responsible for the safe keeping of a\r\nprisoner of Parliament. Their windows command a view of the Thames\r\nand Westminster Bridge on one side and of Palace Yard on the other.\r\nImprisonment under any conditions is, perhaps, an undesirable\r\nposition, but it must be said that in the Clock Tower it is deprived\r\nof all its terrors and most of its inconveniences. The prisoner\r\nmay rise when he pleases; his meals are supplied from the catering\r\ndepartment of the House of Commons, and he can have what he likes—at\r\nhis own expense. After breakfast he is allowed an hour’s recreation\r\non the terrace, accompanied by his gaoler and a police-officer in\r\nplain clothes, and he may take the air also in the evening. Should\r\nhis term of imprisonment extend over Sunday, he may attend service in\r\nSt. John’s Church, close to the Palace of Westminster, to which he is\r\naccompanied by his guards.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the House of Commons, in recent times, was to commit\r\na person guilty of any violation of its privileges to the custody\r\nof the Serjeant-at-Arms, to be detained during its pleasure. The\r\nimprisonment generally continued until the prisoner expressed\r\ncontrition for his offence, or the House in its mercy resolved that\r\nhe be discharged. But before he was free to go he had to pay a\r\nsubstantial fee to the Serjeant-at-Arms for locking him up and seeing\r\nthat he did not escape. The House, however, has no power to keep a\r\nperson in custody during its recess. If, therefore, the confinement\r\nshould last until the prorogation of Parliament, he may not only\r\nclaim his release but decline to make good the Serjeant-at-Arms’ bill\r\nof costs. The last occupant of the prison was Charles Bradlaugh, the\r\nMember for Northampton. His confinement for twenty-four hours, in\r\n1880, was an episode in his long contest with the House of Commons\r\nover his claim to be allowed, as an atheist, to take his seat without\r\nhaving to use, in the oath of allegiance, the expression, “So help\r\nme, God!” Bradlaugh, in a conversation about his prison experiences,\r\nstated that while the rooms were comfortable, and the confinement by\r\nno means irksome, the noisy passage of time as recorded by Big Ben in\r\nbooming the quarters and the hours at night allowed him but little\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nContumacy on the part of a Member nowadays would hardly be visited\r\nby imprisonment. Among the expressions which are considered out of\r\norder are treasonable or seditious words, the use of the Sovereign’s\r\nname offensively, or, with a view to influence debate, disparaging\r\nreferences to the character and proceedings of Parliament, personal\r\nattacks on Members, allusions to matters pending judicial decision\r\nin the courts of law, and insulting reflections on Judges or\r\nother persons in high authority. The Speaker, or the Chairman of\r\nCommittees, has also the power, after having called attention three\r\ntimes to the conduct of a Member who persists in irrelevance, or in\r\ntedious repetition, to direct him to discontinue his speech. If a\r\nMember’s conduct is grossly disorderly, or if he refuses to apologize\r\nfor an unparliamentary expression, the Speaker or Chairman orders\r\nhim to withdraw immediately from the House and its precincts for\r\nthe remainder of the sitting, and should he refuse to leave he may\r\nbe forcibly removed by the Serjeant-at-Arms and his messengers. If\r\nsuspension for the remainder of the sitting be deemed by the Speaker\r\nan inadequate punishment for the breach of order, the offending\r\nmember may be named. The Speaker simply says, “I name you, James\r\nThomas Millwright.” The motion of suspension which follows the\r\nnaming of a Member is moved by the Leader of the House or, in his\r\nabsence, by another Minister. It is simply and briefly worded, to\r\nthis effect: “I beg to move that James Thomas Millwright, Member for\r\nLittle Peddlington, be suspended from the service of the House.”\r\nIt is put to the House immediately, no amendment or debate, or\r\neven an explanation by the offending Member, being allowed. If the\r\noffence has been committed in Committee, the proceedings are at\r\nonce suspended, the Speaker is sent for, the House resumes, and the\r\nChairman reports the circumstances. The motion of suspension is\r\nthen moved by the Minister and put by the Speaker. The Member thus\r\nsuspended must forthwith quit the precincts of the House, a term\r\nofficially interpreted as “the area within the walls of the Palace\r\nof Westminster.” It will be noticed that the period of suspension is\r\nnot mentioned in the motion. Formerly, the Standing Orders provided\r\nthat for the first offence it was to be one week, for the second a\r\nfortnight, and for each further offence one month. But by amendments\r\nto the Orders made in February 1902 the suspension continues in force\r\ntill the end of the session, unless previously rescinded. Suspension\r\ninvolves the forfeiture of the right of entry to the lobby, the\r\nsmoking-room and dining-room, the library, the terrace, and indeed\r\nto any portion of the Palace; but it does not exempt the Member from\r\nserving on any committee for the consideration of a Private Bill to\r\nwhich he has been appointed, and that is considered an additional\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\nIf too large a number of Members to be coped with effectively by\r\nthe force at the command of the Serjeant-at-Arms should disregard\r\nthe authority of the Chair, the Speaker, by powers vested in him in\r\nFebruary 1902, may forthwith adjourn the House. The new Standing\r\nOrder was designed to cope with such a scene of disorder as that\r\nwhich occurred a short time previously, when a force of police was\r\nbrought into the Chamber by Mr. Speaker Gully to remove some Irish\r\nMembers who, as a protest against being closured in debate, refused\r\nto take part in the division that was challenged on the question\r\nunder discussion. “In the case of grave disorder arising in the\r\nHouse,” it runs, “the Speaker may, if he thinks it necessary to do\r\nso, adjourn the House without question put, or suspend any sitting\r\nfor a time to be named by him.” In other words, the Speaker can turn\r\nout the lights and the reporters, leaving the disorderly Members to\r\ncool their anger in privacy and in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe House has also the power of expulsion. This punishment is\r\nresorted to only in the case of a Member guilty of a gross criminal\r\noffence. Strangely enough, it does not disqualify for re-election,\r\nif the expelled Member could persuade a constituency to accept him.\r\nBut to name a Member is the highest coercive authority vested in\r\nthe Speaker for dealing with disorderly conduct in the House. It\r\nshould be a very grave breach of the privileges of the House, or\r\nvery indecorous conduct within its walls, that nowadays would land a\r\nMember in the prison of the Clock Tower.\r\n\r\nBut to see the Serjeant-at-Arms in all his glory one must have the\r\ngood fortune to be present on one of those rare occasions when some\r\noutside violator of the privileges of the House is brought to the Bar\r\nfor judgment. Parliament can itself redress its wrongs and vindicate\r\nits privileges. It acknowledges no higher authority. It has the\r\npower summarily to punish disobedience of its orders and mandates,\r\nindignities offered to its proceedings, assaults upon the persons or\r\nreflections upon the characters of its Members, or interference with\r\nits officers in the discharge of their duties. The Serjeant-at-Arms\r\ncan arrest, under the warrant of the Speaker issued by order of the\r\nHouse, any person anywhere within the limits of the kingdom. In the\r\nexecution of the warrant he can call on the aid of the civil power.\r\nIf he thinks it necessary, he can even summon the military to his\r\nassistance. He can break into a private residence between sunrise and\r\nsunset, if he has reason to suspect that the person he is in search\r\nof is inside.\r\n\r\nThe most famous case of house-breaking in execution of a warrant\r\nof the Commons was the forcible entrance into the residence of Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett, in Piccadilly, by the Serjeant-at-Arms, supported\r\nby police and military, and the arrest of the Radical Member for\r\nWestminster and his commitment to the Tower. Burdett was pronounced\r\nguilty of a breach of privilege in April 1810 by declaring in a\r\nletter to his constituents that the Commons had exceeded their\r\npowers in sending to prison John Gale Jones, the revolutionary\r\norator, and an order for his commitment to the Tower was carried by a\r\nMajority of 38—190 against 152. Burdett barricaded his house against\r\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms. An entrance was effected by climbing the area\r\nrailings and breaking open the area door. The Serjeant-at-Arms found\r\nBurdett in the drawing-room upstairs. “Sir,” said Burdett, “do you\r\ndemand me in the name of the King? In that case I am prepared to\r\nobey.” “No, sir,” replied the Serjeant-at-Arms, “I demand you in\r\nthe name and by the authority of the Commons of England.” Burdett\r\nprotested that the law of the land was being violated, but he was\r\ncarried off and lodged in the Tower. An action which he afterwards\r\nbrought against the Speaker for false imprisonment failed on\r\nthe ground that the Commons are the supreme guardian of its own\r\nprivileges and upholder of its authority. Neither does any suit lie\r\nagainst the Serjeant-at-Arms. Arising out of proceedings brought in\r\n1884 by Charles Bradlaugh for assault against the Serjeant-at-Arms\r\nin having him removed by force from the House of Commons, Lord Chief\r\nJustice Coleridge laid it down that the Serjeant-at-Arms was not\r\nliable for damages in the execution of his duty, and that the court\r\nhad no jurisdiction over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms brings his prisoner to the House of Commons. A\r\nbrass rod is pulled out from the receptacle in which it is telescoped\r\nat the Bar, and stretched across the line which marks the technical\r\nboundary of the Chamber. The fixing of that glittering rod is\r\nalmost as fearfully thrilling as the putting on of the black cap\r\nby the Judge to impose the sentence of death, and I have seen both\r\nspectacles. Behind the rod stands the prisoner. To his right is the\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms, carrying the glittering Mace on his shoulder. At\r\nthe other end of the Chamber, standing on the dais of the Chair, is\r\nMr. Speaker in his flowing silk gown, his face sternly set under his\r\nhuge wig—an awful figure indeed—delivering in the weightiest words\r\nhe can command, amid the dramatic hush of the crowded Chamber, the\r\nsentence or reprimand of the House on the scorner or violator of\r\nits ancient privileges. On such occasions, the Mace being off the\r\ntable, no Member can address the House. It would be out of order for\r\na Member to put a question direct to the prisoner at the Bar. If\r\ntherefore a Member desires to put such a question he must write it\r\ndown and submit it to the Speaker, who alone has then the right of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nIn former times the prisoner at the Bar was compelled to kneel\r\ndown while the Speaker delivered the sentence or censure of the\r\nHouse. In February 1751 a Scottish gentleman named Alexander\r\nMurray (brother of the Master of Elibank), having, in the course\r\nof a contested election at Westminster, under the very shadow of\r\nthe House, spoken disrespectfully of the authority of that august\r\nassembly, was brought to the Bar in custody. But so unimpressed was\r\nhe by the crowded benches, by Mr. Speaker Onslow in wig and gown, by\r\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms with the Mace on his shoulder, that he flatly\r\ndeclined to kneel, though the Speaker sternly roared at him, “Your\r\nobeisance, sir! You forget yourself! On your knees, sir!” “Sir,”\r\nsaid Murray, “I beg to be excused; I never kneel but to God.” “On\r\nyour knees, sir!” again cried the Speaker. “Your obeisance—you\r\nmust kneel.” But down on his knees Murray stoutly declined to go.\r\n“That,” said he, “is an attitude of humbleness which I adopt only\r\nwhen I confess my sins to the Almighty.” The House declared that\r\nthis obstinacy aggravated his original offence. “Having in a most\r\ninsolent, audacious manner, at the Bar of the House, absolutely\r\nrefused to go upon his knees,” so ran the resolution of the House,\r\n“he is guilty of a high and most dangerous contempt of the authority\r\nand privileges of this House.” Murray was committed to Newgate, and\r\nso close was his confinement that he was denied the visits of friends\r\nand the use of pen, ink and paper. Committal to prison by Parliament\r\nlapses, as I have said, at the end of the session. That being so,\r\nwhen Parliament was prorogued the doors of Murray’s prison had to\r\nbe flung open. The House of Commons, however, was not satisfied\r\nthat three or four months’ incarceration had adequately purged the\r\nScotsman of his impudent offence. It has power to re-arrest when\r\nParliament meets again. Accordingly, in the new session a fresh\r\nwarrant for Murray’s committal was made out, and the Serjeant-at-Arms\r\nwent to his house to arrest him; but he had fled, and though a reward\r\nof £500 was offered for his discovery, he was never captured.\r\n\r\nTwenty years afterwards the custom requiring prisoners to kneel at\r\nthe Bar was abolished. The last prisoner to suffer this indignity\r\nwas a journalist—Mr. Baldwin, the publisher of _The St. James’s\r\nChronicle_. On March 14, 1771, he was arrested for publishing\r\na report of the proceedings of the House, and was compelled to\r\nprostrate himself abjectly at the Bar while the Speaker scolded\r\nhim for having dared to inform the electors of the doings of\r\ntheir representatives in Parliament. In 1772 a Standing Order was\r\npassed—inspired, as John Hatsell, the Clerk of the House, ingenuously\r\nsuggests, by “the humanity of the House”—by which it was ordered that\r\nin future delinquents should receive the Speaker’s judgment standing.\r\nPerhaps the House was moved to take this action by the cutting irony\r\nof a remark made by Baldwin. On rising from his knees, after being\r\ncensured, he said, as he brushed the dust from his clothes, “What a\r\ndamned dirty House!” Perhaps the House preferred to allow culprits to\r\nstand at the Bar rather than run the risk, by making them kneel, of\r\nexposing its majestic self any longer to such ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe peers, however, have never formally renounced this custom by\r\nStanding Order. Warren Hastings was obliged to kneel at the Bar\r\nof the House of Lords on being admitted to bail, in 1787, on his\r\nimpeachment; and again, at the opening of his trial in the following\r\nyear, he remained on his knees until directed to rise by the\r\nLord Chancellor. “I can,” he afterwards wrote, half pathetically\r\nand half indignantly, “with truth affirm that I have borne with\r\nindifference all the base treatment I have had dealt to me—all\r\nexcept the ignominious ceremonial of kneeling before the House.”\r\nEven on being called to the Bar to hear his acquittal announced by\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, eight years subsequently, he had to undergo the\r\nsame humiliating ordeal. But the Lords have not for many years now\r\nrequired a prisoner at the Bar to kneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nPersons of all sorts and descriptions, as the Journals of the House\r\nshow, have stood at the Bar of the Commons not only for disobedience\r\nof the orders of the House, for indignities offered to it, for\r\ninsults to Members, for reflections on their character and conduct in\r\nParliament, for interference with the officers of the House in the\r\ndischarge of their duties, but also to give evidence in inquiries\r\ninstituted by the House, to plead some cause, or to receive the\r\nthanks of the House for services to the State. In each case the\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms, with the Mace on his shoulder, was a prominent\r\nfigure in the scene. Samuel Pepys stood at the Bar to defend himself\r\nagainst charges of dereliction of duty as registrar of the Navy\r\nBoard. To fortify himself for the ordeal he drank at home a half-pint\r\nof mulled sack, and just before being called to the Bar he added a\r\ndram of brandy. So completely did he answer the accusations that he\r\nand his fellow-officials were acquitted of all blame. Titus Oates,\r\nthe perjurer, stood there to relate the particulars of his Popish\r\nPlot. Dr. Sacheverell, the Jacobite divine, stood there in 1709 to\r\nanswer the charge of preaching “a scurrilous and seditious libel” in\r\nSt. Paul’s Cathedral—that famous sermon in which he asserted that\r\nit was sinful for subjects to resist the authority of the King.\r\nWellington sat on a chair, set for him within the Bar, in 1814,\r\nto receive the thanks of the House of Commons for his services\r\nin the Peninsular campaign. Mrs. Clarke, the discarded mistress\r\nof the Duke of York, appeared there in 1809, to give evidence in\r\nsupport of the charge brought against his Royal Highness of having,\r\nas Commander-in-Chief, corruptly bartered in the sale of Army\r\nCommissions, an accusation that was declared not proven, though it\r\nled to the Duke’s resignation. Warren Hastings stood there as a\r\nwitness, close on thirty years after his impeachment. Members cheered\r\nhim on his appearance, and when he retired they rose and uncovered.\r\nDaniel O’Connell, the first Roman Catholic elected to Parliament\r\nsince the Revolution, stood there is 1828 to plead, and plead in\r\nvain, that he should be allowed to take his seat without having to\r\nsubscribe to the oath which declared his faith to be idolatrous\r\nand blasphemous, an abjuration, however, that was abolished by the\r\nCatholic Emancipation Act which was passed in the following year.\r\n\r\nPersons not so distinguished or notorious have also stood at\r\nthe Bar, in the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, charged with\r\nwhimsical breaches of privilege. A man named Hyde, who tried to\r\nobtain admission to Westminster Hall at the impeachment of Warren\r\nHastings, was rudely jostled into Palace Yard by a policeman. Hyde\r\nhad the constable served with a summons for assault. For this Hyde\r\nwas arrested by the Serjeant-at-Arms, on the order of the House,\r\nbrought to the Bar, and actually committed to prison for a breach\r\nof privilege in having attempted to bring an officer of the House\r\nbefore the ordinary legal tribunals of the land. But perhaps the\r\nmost amusing instance remains to be told. Dick Martin, a well-known\r\nIrish Member in the early years of the nineteenth century (founder\r\nof the excellent Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals),\r\nwas greatly perturbed to find in a London newspaper some passages\r\nof his speech in the House, the previous night, printed in italics.\r\nHe complained to the House of having been misrepresented, and the\r\nreporter (who happened to be a fellow-countryman of Mr. Martin) was\r\nbrought to the Bar for a breach of privilege. The journalist pleaded\r\nthat the report was absolutely correct. “It may be,” replied the\r\nindignant Irish representative, “but I defy the gentleman to prove\r\nthat I spoke in italics!” In this case the culprit was dismissed amid\r\nthe laughter of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA NIGHT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is the supreme authority in this land. It\r\nshould, therefore, be a consoling thought to the people that every\r\nsitting of the House is opened with a prayer for Divine light and\r\nguidance in the exercise of its unlimited powers of legislation.\r\nBoth Houses of Parliament have used the prayer since the Restoration\r\nof Charles II in 1660. Besides the spiritual benefit that a Member\r\nderives from attendance at the service, he also gets the material\r\nadvantage of a seat during the sitting, which, as the Chamber\r\nprovides places only for about half its membership, is an additional\r\ninducement to be present at prayers.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker stands at the head of the Table. By his side is the\r\nChaplain in gown and bands. Standing in files along the benches\r\nare the Members—the two great political Parties facing each other\r\nacross the floor. The service opens with the 67th Psalm, with its\r\naspirations for the enlargement of God’s Kingdom, to the joy of the\r\npeople and the increase of God’s blessings. “O let the nations be\r\nglad and sing for joy, for Thou shalt judge the people righteously\r\nand govern the nations upon earth.” The sublime maxims of the Lord’s\r\nPrayer are recited. For social policy: “Thy will be done on earth as\r\nit is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread;” and for foreign\r\naffairs, “And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that\r\ntrespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.” There are\r\nprayers for the King and Queen. Then follows the invocation to God\r\non behalf of the House of Commons, at which the Members turn to the\r\nwalls with bowed heads.\r\n\r\nThe Chaplain prays:\r\n\r\n  Send down the Heavenly Wisdom from above to direct and guide us\r\n  in all our consultations; and grant that we, having Thy fear\r\n  always before our eyes, and laying aside all private interests,\r\n  prejudices, and partial affections, the result of all our counsels\r\n  may be to the Glory of Thy blessed Name, the maintenance of true\r\n  religion and justice, the safety, honour and happiness of the King,\r\n  the public welfare, peace and tranquillity of the realm, and the\r\n  uniting and knitting together of the hearts of all persons and\r\n  estates within the same in true Christian love and charity one\r\n  towards another, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\r\n\r\nStrangers are not admitted to the galleries until prayers are\r\nover. If they were present they could not fail to notice a strange\r\nthing. That is, that the Treasury Bench is always empty during the\r\nservice. Ministers may be really more in need of prayers than private\r\nMembers, but then their seats in the Chamber are secured to them by\r\nprescriptive right.\r\n\r\nThe first sight of the plain architectural features of the House\r\nof Commons must be disappointing to anyone swayed by the great\r\nand stirring historical associations of the place. If there be\r\nany secular institution to which something of religious solemnity\r\nshould attach, it surely is the free Legislature of a Nation, where\r\nthe habits, customs and institutions of the people are largely\r\nmoulded, where, at any rate, the morality or ethics of the country\r\nfind expression in laws. The Chamber is unadorned. The prevailing\r\ncolour is dull brown, conveyed by the oak framework of galleries\r\nand panelled walls plainly carved. In the daylight a warm dimness\r\nprevails. At night the Chamber looks more impressive, when a mellow\r\nradiance streaming from the lights through its glass ceiling\r\nfalls upon the crowded benches. But to the uninstructed stranger\r\naccidentally straying into it on an off-day, its stiff arrangement of\r\ntiers of benches, upholstered in dark green, on each side, and the\r\nabsence of any pictorial background, would suggest an assembly-room\r\nor debating-hall, with a certain air of distinction, it is true, but\r\nlacking character and soul. Is it really in this simple Chamber of\r\nmodest dimensions and severe aspect that the elected and principal\r\nHouse of the Imperial Parliament is content to meet? Is it here that\r\nsince 1852—the year the Chamber was first occupied—so many exciting\r\nand momentous battles over political principles have been fought? Is\r\nit from this narrow hall that influences radiate which are felt to\r\nthe farthest confines of the world, in the wigwams of savage tribes\r\nas well as in the Chancelleries of the Great Powers? You would do\r\nwell, indeed, when you visit the House of Commons and desire to fall\r\nunder its spell, to come with your historical memories refreshed, for\r\nyou will there see nothing in the way of portraits of its immortal\r\nMembers, or pictures from its storied past, to tell of its greatness\r\nand renown.\r\n\r\nWhat emotions have there found vent! These walls, sheathed in oak,\r\nhave echoed to the voices of the great Parliamentarians of three\r\nreigns—Victoria, Edward and George—Palmerston, Lord John Russell,\r\nCobden, Disraeli, Bright, Parnell, Randolph Churchill, Gladstone,\r\nChamberlain, Balfour, Asquith, John Redmond, Lloyd George, Winston\r\nChurchill, Lord Hugh Cecil—laying down beneficent truths or\r\npernicious fallacies. Think of the groans of despair and the shouts\r\nof exultation these forcible and vibrating personages have aroused!\r\nWith what volumes of sound, rising from the hearts of men and\r\nexpressive of every phase of human feeling—joy and grief, pathos and\r\nhumour, pity and contempt, exasperation and rage—has the Chamber\r\nreverberated. Fine things have been said here, and mean things. Great\r\nideas have been expressed by great men who worthily served them.\r\nThe storms of passion, evoked by the clash between opposing reason\r\nand thought in the political controversies that have been fought\r\nout there at close quarters, have made the atmosphere of the House\r\nof Commons humid and warm with emotion, and one with a mind at all\r\nsympathetically attuned to the spirit of places cannot be there very\r\nlong before the effluence that emanates from these panelled walls is\r\nthrilling him through and through.\r\n\r\nYet there are objects within the Chamber, made sacred almost by\r\nhistory and tradition, which at once catch the eye. The visitor will\r\nnotice with becoming awe the high-canopied Chair, surmounted by an\r\noak carving of the Royal Arms, and will look with fitting reverence\r\non Mr. Speaker in his big grey wig and black silk gown. At the\r\nhead of the Table, beneath the Speaker, sits the Clerk of the House\r\nand the two assistant clerks, all in the gowns and short wigs of\r\nbarristers-at-law, busily discharging their multifarious duties,\r\nsuch as sub-editing papers handed in by Members containing questions\r\nto be addressed to Ministers, amendments to be moved to Bills, and\r\nnotices of motions to be proposed should opportunity offer, and also\r\ntaking minutes of the proceedings for the Journals of the House. The\r\nTable is indeed a “substantial piece of furniture,” as Disraeli once\r\ndescribed it when he spoke of his satisfaction that it lay between\r\nhim and Gladstone, who had just concluded a fierce declamatory\r\nattack. It contains pens, ink and stationery for the use of Members,\r\nvolumes of the Standing Orders and other works of reference. At\r\nthe end of the Table, on either side, are two brass-bound oaken\r\nboxes. These are the famous “dispatch-boxes” on which Ministers and\r\nex-Ministers lay their notes when addressing the House, and following\r\nthe traditional example of great statesmen in the past, thump to give\r\nemphasis to an argument or, metaphorically, to bash the head of an\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThe Table is also made to serve a part in parliamentary procedure.\r\nImportant documents, such as the reports of Committees, and Foreign\r\nOffice papers have to be “laid on the Table,” or, in other words,\r\npresented to the House, before they can properly be made public;\r\nand Orders of Departments have likewise to be “laid” for specified\r\nperiods preliminary to their coming into operation. Even the\r\nfloor-covering of the Chamber is a chapter from history. See the red\r\nborder-lines on the matting right down the floor, about two feet\r\nfrom the front benches below the gangways. The opposing parties must\r\nnot step beyond that line while in the act of speaking. And why?\r\nBecause centuries ago Members were as ready to enforce an argument\r\nwith the sword as with the tongue, and, to hedge them in, these lines\r\nof demarcation were drawn down the centre of the House. But of all\r\nthe objects in the House calculated to awaken historic memories the\r\nMace, perhaps, is the most potent. Made of silver and gilt with gold,\r\nits large globular head surmounted by a cross and ball, its staff\r\nartistically embellished, it lies a prominent and luminous object,\r\nwhen the Speaker is in the Chair, on raised supports at the end of\r\nthe Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBusiness begins the moment the Speaker takes the Chair. It is noted\r\nfor its miscellaneous character. Private Bills—or Bills introduced\r\non behalf of the promoters of commercial or municipal undertakings\r\nwhich interfere with rights of property—are first considered. But\r\nthe proceedings are formal, and devoid of interest. Petitions are\r\nalso presented to the House at this stage of the sitting. A Member\r\nrises in his place and, stating that he has a petition to present,\r\nreads a brief summary of its purport. It invariably ends with the\r\nphrase, “And your petitioners will ever pray, etc.” No one has ever\r\nseen the sentence completed. What, then, can “etc.” imply? It seems\r\na slovenly and irreverent way of saying one’s prayers, reminiscent\r\nof the backwoodsman who chalked up his pious wishes at the head of\r\nhis bed, and, when tumbling in at night, jerked his thumb over his\r\nshoulder saying, “Lord, them’s my sentiments.” “Will the honourable\r\nMember bring it up?” says the Speaker, referring, of course, to the\r\npetition. The Member walks up the floor and drops the roll into\r\nthe yawning mouth of a big black bag, hanging at the back of the\r\nChair. More often than not there is no public mention whatever of\r\nthe petition in the House. The Member to whom it is sent contents\r\nhimself with privately stowing it away into the bag, without anyone\r\nbeing made a bit the wiser as to its nature or signatures. Through\r\nthe yawning mouth of this big black bag petitions may be said to drop\r\nout of sight and out of mind into the limbo of waste and forgotten\r\nthings. Their presentation is recorded in the Journals of the House.\r\nBut they make no impression whatever on the minds of Members as to\r\nthe grievances they are intended to expose, and they are heard of\r\nno more, except the Committee on Petitions, before whom, in due\r\ncourse, they come for scrutiny, find some of the regulations have\r\nbeen violated—that, for instance, the prayer of a petition, instead\r\nof being in writing, is printed, or lithographed, or typewritten,\r\nor that several of the signatures are in the same handwriting, or\r\ndenote persons manifestly fictitious, such as “Charles Piccadilly,”\r\n“John Trafalgar Square”—put down by jokers—when the petition is\r\neither returned for correction to the Member who presented it or its\r\nrejection is recommended. Two municipal bodies have the privilege\r\nof presenting petitions ceremoniously at the Bar of the House of\r\nCommons—the Corporation of the City of London and the Corporation\r\nof Dublin. In the early decades of the nineteenth century petitions\r\nwere read in full by Members who presented them, and there were\r\ngreat debates arising out of them on such questions as Negro slavery\r\nwithin the Empire, the political emancipation of Catholic or Jew, and\r\nparliamentary reform. I have seen, in the later years of the same\r\ncentury, huge petitions with hundreds of thousands of signatures\r\ntrundled up the floor of the House like enormous cartwheels or big\r\ndrums. They related usually to proposed changes in primary education\r\nor the liquor laws—the two chief subjects of controversy in the dull\r\nand happy time I speak of. But the sending of petitions is almost a\r\nthing of the past. The House has become indifferent to any form of\r\npersuasion save that of elections.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber has now rapidly filled up for “question time,” which\r\nis often the most interesting part of a sitting. One of the most\r\nprecious and highly cherished privileges of a Member is the right to\r\nquestion Ministers—before the House proceeds to business—in relation\r\nto public affairs, matters of administration, policy or legislation.\r\nMoreover, these interrogations and replies are an unfailing source of\r\ninterest and also of entertainment. The House then invariably wears\r\nan alert and animated aspect. The benches on both sides are thronged.\r\nEvery Member is supplied with a copy of the official programme called\r\nthe “Orders of the Day”—a white folio paper of many pages, in which\r\nthe questions are printed, with other matter relating to the business\r\narranged for the sitting—and one of the most characteristic sights\r\nwhich the House affords is the flutter of these papers on the crowded\r\nbenches, as the questions are put and answered. The proceedings are\r\nfollowed with the closest attention, with, in fact, an absorbed\r\ninterest which during a debate is evoked only by a really great\r\nspeech on a subject of the first importance. The questions deal with\r\nall sorts of topics, illustrating at once the freedom of inquiry\r\nwithin the House and the jurisdiction of Parliament within the\r\nfar-spreading Empire.\r\n\r\nQuestions are given in writing to the Clerks at the Table. “A\r\nquestion,” according to the Standing Orders, “must not contain any\r\nargument, inference, imputation, epithet or ironical expression.” The\r\njudge of the regularity of a question is the Speaker. He disallows\r\nit if in his opinion it is an abuse of the right of questioning, the\r\nsole object of which is to obtain information from the Government.\r\nQuestions are sometimes altered by the Clerks on the ground of\r\nimpropriety of expression. Members occasionally complain of this\r\ncensorship. The Irish Party once resented the insertion at the Table\r\nof the word “Roman” before “Catholic” in a question handed in by\r\none of their Members. Mr. Speaker Lowther was greatly surprised\r\nthat they should have regarded the word as offensive, but promised,\r\nin deference to their feelings, it would not be used again. On the\r\nother hand, they rejoiced over their success in having the term\r\n“land-grabbers”—one of ill-omen, in Irish agrarian agitation—passed\r\nin a question and thus appearing for the first time on the official\r\nrecords of Parliament. I can also recall instances of Members who\r\nrefused to put questions as they appeared in print. They were so\r\ndifferent from the form in which they had been given in manuscript to\r\nthe Clerks that their authors absolutely disowned them. But however\r\nquestions may be sub-edited, it is rarely that one is rejected\r\naltogether by the Speaker. A question addressed to a Minister must,\r\nof course, relate to some public affair with which he is officially\r\nconcerned, or to a matter of policy or administration for which he is\r\nresponsible. Subject to these limitations a Member may put down four\r\nquestions daily interrogating Ministers on any subject, no matter\r\nhow local or trivial, for there are little things as well as great\r\nthings in regard to which the House daily exercises supervision or\r\nrequires to be informed. The Minister, however, may decline to answer\r\na question on the ground that it is against the public interest. This\r\nstops the irresponsible interference of Members in the most delicate\r\nfunctions of the Executive, which, if allowed, especially in foreign\r\naffairs, might be productive of embarrassing and perhaps hazardous\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nQuestions of an urgent character, or of exceptional importance, may\r\nbe asked without being printed in the “Orders of the Day,” provided\r\nprivate notice—or notice, by letter—has been given to the particular\r\nMinister and the consent of the Speaker has been previously obtained.\r\nThese special interrogations are always put when the printed\r\nquestions are disposed of. But the usual custom is for two or three\r\ndays’ notice to be given, in order to afford time for the preparation\r\nof the replies. It is not the Ministers who discharge the task of\r\nobtaining the information that is asked for. The questions are sent\r\nto the different departments, to whose parliamentary chiefs they are\r\naddressed, and the answers are drafted by the permanent staff. In\r\nmost cases all the Minister has to do with the replies is to read\r\nthem in the House of Commons. The day’s questions are printed, as I\r\nhave said, in the “Orders of the Day.” They are prefixed with the\r\nnames of the Members responsible for them and are also numbered. The\r\nway in which they are put is direct and simple. Each Member rises\r\nin his place when called on, in succession, by the Speaker, and\r\nsays: “I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department\r\nquestion No. 1,” or, “I beg to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty\r\nquestion No. 40.” The Treasury Bench, be it understood, is crowded\r\nwith Ministers, each of them in possession of a bundle of typewritten\r\nanswers supplied to him by the clerks of his department. Accordingly,\r\nthe Home Secretary looks up question No. 1, or the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty question No. 40, from his bundle and reads it to the House.\r\n\r\nThe growth of this practice of questioning Ministers has been very\r\nremarkable. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nthat it became an established feature of the proceedings of the House\r\nof Commons. In 1849 a special place was assigned to questions in\r\nthe “Orders of the Day.” Before that year they were few in number;\r\nthey referred mainly to the arrangement and progress of business,\r\nand were rarely printed. The first time a question appeared in the\r\n“Orders of the Day” was in 1835. But after 1849 questions were\r\nprinted regularly in the “Orders of the Day,” and the subjects\r\ninquired about—confined, previously, to pending legislation—extended\r\ngradually to public affairs and matters of administration. Still, it\r\nwas rare to see more than twelve, or at the most twenty, questions on\r\nthe paper for thirty years subsequently. In the session of 1860 the\r\nnumber of questions asked was 699; in 1870, 1,203; in 1880, 1,546;\r\nin 1890, 4,407, and in 1920 over 5,000. The questions occasionally\r\nexceed 200 per day. The average number is about 150. All this shows\r\nhow interpellation, like other functions of the House of Commons,\r\ncame almost haphazardly into operation, and now rests immovably\r\non the foundation of privilege. And the Committee on National\r\nExpenditure reported during the Great War that each question costs\r\nthe country thirty shillings.\r\n\r\nUntil 1880 it was the practice of Members to read every question when\r\nputting it to the Minister, although it was printed in the “Orders of\r\nthe Day.” On July 8, 1880, after question time, Joseph Cowen called\r\nattention to the fact that two hours had been occupied in asking\r\nand answering questions. Yet the number of questions put that day\r\nwas only thirty. He added that, having taken the time on his watch,\r\nhe had found the mere reading of the questions occupied an hour;\r\nand he asked the Speaker whether, as the questions were printed in\r\nthe “Orders of the Day,” it was necessary they should be read. Mr.\r\nSpeaker Brand, in reply, said: “It has been the general practice for\r\nmany years for hon. Members, in putting questions, to read these\r\nquestions, and it has been generally found to be a convenient course.\r\nThere is, however, no absolute rule on the subject.” From that day,\r\nhowever, the reading of questions was gradually discontinued; and\r\nquestions were put simply by a reference to the numbers as they\r\nappeared in the “Orders of the Day.” It was only a month later that\r\nan Irish Member, named Finigan, on reading a question, was received\r\nwith loud cries of “Order!” The Speaker was asked whether it was not\r\n“a great abuse of the rules of the House” for the hon. Member to\r\nhave read his question. “The matter is not so much one of order as\r\nof propriety,” replied Mr. Speaker Brand. “I consider that the hon.\r\nMember in reading the question of which he has given notice was,\r\nstrictly speaking, not out of order. With regard to the propriety\r\nof his doing so, I give no opinion.” This was the last occasion a\r\nquestion appearing in the “Orders of the Day” was read on being put\r\nto the Minister.\r\n\r\nOften the real interest of a question and answer only develops when\r\nthe Minister has read his typewritten reply. This arises from the\r\ncustom of putting what are known as supplementary questions. “Arising\r\nout of the right hon. gentleman’s answer, may I ask ——?” the Member\r\nbegins. His purpose is to extract further information from the\r\nreluctant Minister. If the subject is controversial, the Minister is\r\nmade the target of inquisitorial arrows, which he meets or parries as\r\nbest he can. Mr. Speaker Peel never attempted to set up any limit to\r\nthe liberty of a Member—dissatisfied with the answer to the question\r\nhe had placed on the paper or, as often happened, anxious to show off\r\nhis humour—to cross-examine, as it were, the Minister by means of\r\nsupplementary questions.\r\n\r\nI remember many instances of Arthur Balfour, when Chief Secretary\r\nfor Ireland, being subjected for a quarter of an hour to a harassing\r\nfusillade of supplementary questions arising out of the question on\r\none paper, and Mr. Speaker Peel saw no occasion for interference.\r\nBut a totally different line was taken by Mr. Speaker Gully. When\r\na Member rose to put a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker Gully\r\ninterposed with a cry of “Order, order!” and informed the hon.\r\ngentleman that his question did not arise out of the question on\r\nthe paper. The rule regulating supplementary questions previously\r\nwas that they must arise out of the answer of the Minister. Some\r\nMembers, notably the most pertinacious hecklers of the Government,\r\nchafed under this unwonted restraint, and occasionally showed signs\r\nof a disposition to revolt against the Chair, but Gully had might\r\non his side, at least, and could not be trifled with. Mr. Speaker\r\nLowther was disposed to follow the precedent set by Gully. “If,” he\r\nsaid on one occasion, “questions are at all important they should\r\nbe put on the notice-paper, and if they are not important, they\r\nshould not be asked.” Under Peel there was no limit to the duration\r\nof question time. It was limited to an hour under Lowther, and a\r\npoint he repeatedly urged was that supplementary questions were\r\nunfair to Members who had questions on the notice-paper because they\r\nlessened the chance of these questions being reached within the time\r\nallowed. The answer to such questions as are not reached within the\r\nhour, and therefore are not read by the Ministers, are printed with\r\nthose orally given by the Ministers in the official report of the\r\nproceedings of the House. Of questions generally it may be said that\r\nwhile great principles are frequently raised or indirectly suggested\r\nby them, many of them are concerned with what appears to be small\r\ndetails of administration interesting only to the individuals whom\r\nthey affect.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nNew Members are introduced after questions. Quaint indeed are the\r\ncontradictions of parliamentary procedure. Rules that are entirely\r\ndifferent regulate the taking of the oath of allegiance and their\r\nseats in the House of Commons by M.P.’s returned at the General\r\nElection, and M.P.’s who come in at by-elections. We have seen on\r\nthe opening days of Parliament hundreds of men appear at Westminster\r\nand being permitted to take the oath and their seats without any\r\nexamination of credentials or any evidence of identification.\r\nIt was quite possible, on the occasion of a large influx of new\r\nrepresentatives, unknown by appearance to the officials, for a\r\n“stranger,” impudent enough and sufficiently strong of nerve, to\r\npass in with the crowd, and snatch the fearful joy of sitting on\r\nthe sacred Treasury Bench or Opposition Bench—in front even of the\r\nbrass-bound box associated with leadership and quite close to the\r\nMace—without anyone saying him nay. On the other hand, there is an\r\nelaborate ceremony of introduction prescribed for those returned at\r\nby-elections. The new Member has to be escorted to the Table, to take\r\nthe oath of allegiance and sign the Test Roll, by two full-blown\r\nMembers of the House. This custom has survived from a remote past\r\nwhen, in order to prevent personation, two Members of the House\r\nwere required to identify the claimant of a seat after a by-election\r\nas the person named by the returning officer in the return to the\r\nwrit. This precaution has been unnecessary for many a year. But\r\nsuch is the reluctance of the House of Commons to part with any of\r\nits historic ceremonies, such is its scrupulous regard for ancient\r\nprecedents—no matter how incongruous they may appear owing to the\r\nchanges effected by time—that this formality is still retained; and\r\nthough a representative may appear at the Bar of the House as the\r\nunanimous choice of a constituency of 20,000 electors, and produce\r\nthe certificate of the official return of his election, he will not\r\nbe sworn in and permitted to take his seat unless two Members act as\r\nhis sponsors, and so declare that, as the conjurers say, there is\r\npositively no deception.\r\n\r\nThere is the famous case of Dr. Kenealy, counsel for “The Claimant,”\r\nin the Tichborne Trial, who was disbarred by the Benchers of\r\nGrey’s Inn, and afterwards returned for Stoke-upon-Trent at a\r\nby-election in February 1875. He came to the Table alone. It is\r\nnot clearly established whether he failed to find two Members who\r\nwould accompany him as sponsors, or whether he wanted to put to the\r\ntest a custom which, in his opinion, was no part of constitutional\r\nlaw. At any rate, the Speaker informed him that as he had not been\r\nintroduced by two Members, in accordance with the ancient usage of\r\nthe House—founded on a Standing Order dating from 1688—he could\r\nnot be sworn in or take his seat. Kenealy was, therefore, obliged\r\nto withdraw from the House. No objection could be raised to Dr.\r\nKenealy’s election. He produced the certificate of his return as\r\nMember for Stoke-upon-Trent. Everyone in the House knew that he was\r\nthe person named in the official document. He laboured under no legal\r\ndisability. Had he been returned at the General Election he could\r\nhave taken, without question, the oath and his seat. But coming\r\nin at a by-election he was not allowed to do so solely because of\r\nhis inability to comply with what, after all, in this age is but a\r\nmere ceremonial function. The position was, indeed, absurd. It was\r\nimpossible that a duly elected representative of the people could be\r\nexcluded from Parliament for so unsubstantial a cause. Accordingly, a\r\nspecial resolution, moved by Disraeli, who was then Prime Minister,\r\nwas carried dispensing with the ancient introductory ceremony in the\r\nparticular case of Dr. Kenealy. In the course of the discussion John\r\nBright and another Member named Whalley intimated that they were\r\nwilling to walk up the floor with Kenealy “out of deference,” as\r\nBright put it, “to the will of a large constituency.” The Member for\r\nStoke-upon-Trent once more came to the Table unaccompanied; the oath\r\nwas administered to him and he signed the Roll—the sole instance of a\r\ndeparture from a custom observed since 1688. Kenealy then disappeared\r\nin the mass of Members among whom he could not count two friends.\r\n“He was in the House, but not of it,” said Joseph Cowen, speaking in\r\n1881. He was effectually and completely boycotted.\r\n\r\nSometimes the new M.P., returned at a by-election, forgets to\r\nbring to the Table the certificate of the return to the writ. This\r\ndocument, which is sent by the Clerk of the Crown to the Clerk of\r\nthe House, is given to the new Member on application at the Vote\r\nOffice, in the Lobby, just before the ceremony of initiation, and\r\nmust be presented to the Clerk of the House at the Table as evidence\r\nthat he is the person named in the return to the writ as having been\r\nduly elected, before the oath can be administered to him. As a rule,\r\ntherefore, the new Member takes care that he has this indispensable\r\nofficial paper in his possession before he starts to walk, between\r\nhis two sponsors, from the Bar to the Table. But Hardinge Giffard,\r\nafterwards Earl Halsbury and Lord Chancellor, when elected at a\r\nby-election in 1877, found on reaching the Table that the little blue\r\ndocument was missing. In his consternation he hurriedly turned out\r\nall the contents of his pockets, piling them upon the Table—letters,\r\na purse, some loose coppers and silver, a bunch of keys, a briar-wood\r\npipe—all sorts of things but the essential certificate. In this case\r\nthe Speaker refused to accept any evidence—not even the testimony\r\nof identification by the two sponsors—but the Clerk of the Crown’s\r\ncertificate that the man at the Table was the man that had been\r\nduly returned at the recent election for Launceston. The House, of\r\ncourse, was amused at the spectacle. Happily, one of the Whips who\r\nwent in search of the missing return found it in the hat of the new\r\nMember, under the cross-bench below the Bar, where Hardinge Giffard\r\nhad sat with his sponsors awaiting the time for the Speaker to make\r\nthe customary announcement—“New Members desirous of taking their\r\nplaces will, please, come to the Table.”\r\n\r\nYet it would seem, after all, as if the production of the certificate\r\nof the return to the writ were not absolutely necessary before a\r\nnew Member, coming in at a by-election, can take his seat. On March\r\n11, 1848, Mr. Hames was elected for the Irish borough of Kinsale;\r\non the 15th he took the oath and his seat, but it was not until the\r\n18th that the return to the writ was received by the Clerk of the\r\nCrown. The Clerk of the House of Commons had neglected to ask for\r\nthe certificate on the appearance of the new Member at the Table,\r\nthinking that the formality might be dispensed with as the return\r\nto the writ had not arrived. When the mistake was discovered there\r\nwas great wagging of official heads. But none of the authorities\r\ncould suggest a way out of the difficulty. It was unprecedented. The\r\nClerk went about haunted by visions of the deepest dungeon under\r\nthe moat of the Tower of London. At last a committee of the House\r\nwas appointed to make inquiries; and after due investigation they\r\nreported that the Clerk had done a perfectly sensible thing, however\r\nunwittingly. They said it was true that the return to the writ had\r\nalways been required by the House as “the best evidence of a Member’s\r\ntitle to be sworn.” “Nevertheless,” continued they, “the absence\r\nof that proof cannot affect the validity of the election, nor the\r\nright of a person duly elected to be held a Member of the House.”\r\nTruly, a most proper decision! Still, the committee recommended a\r\nstrict adherence to the practice of requiring the production of the\r\ndocument. This much, at least, can be said for it, that it is a\r\npicturesque detail in the initiation of a new Member of the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nThe House then comes to the real business of the sitting. At this\r\nstage of the proceedings leave may be asked for to move the\r\nadjournment of the House, but, even if it be granted, action is not\r\nimmediately taken. The object of such a motion is to obtain from\r\nthe Government an explanation of some act of commission or omission\r\non their part; of something which, in the opinion of the Opposition\r\nor any other section of the House, they have wrongly done or left\r\nundone. The matter complained of must be—as the Standing Order\r\nsays—“a definite matter of urgent public importance” in the opinion\r\nof the Speaker, and the motion must also have the concurrence of at\r\nleast forty members. Therefore, when a Member rises after questions\r\nand asks leave to move the adjournment of the House, stating at the\r\nsame time the object he has in view, the Speaker, should he consider\r\nthe subject definite and urgent, asks whether the hon. Member is\r\nsupported by forty Members. Immediately the Members in favour of\r\nthe motion rise in their places, and if they muster forty, leave\r\nis granted, but the debate stands over until a quarter past eight\r\no’clock. Forty members make a quorum, without which no business\r\ncan be done. If leave is not given because it lacks the necessary\r\nsupport, the Member who asks for it may challenge a division in\r\nthe hope of winning in the lobbies, or for the purpose of getting\r\na record of those for and against his motion. I remember in the\r\nsession of 1912 when George Lansbury the Socialist startled everyone\r\nby claiming that a division should be taken on a motion for the\r\nadjournment, in support of which only 38 Members had risen. The\r\nSpeaker, Mr. Lowther, had recourse to the little book containing\r\nthe rules of the House which he always has by him on the arm of the\r\nChair, for this was probably the first time that such a request had\r\nbeen made, and satisfied himself that Lansbury was within his rights.\r\nThe motion was lost by 115 against 86.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThis being disposed of, the Speaker rises and says: “The Clerk will\r\nnow proceed to read the Orders of the Day,” and the Clerk, with a\r\ncopy of the Order Paper in his hand, reads the title of the first\r\nof the list of Bills down for consideration. It may be the second\r\nreading or the third reading stage, at which, on all great Bills,\r\nthere is usually a big debate. Disraeli is said to have described\r\nthe House of Commons as a dull place, with some great moments. In\r\nmy opinion, it would be difficult for the House of Commons ever to\r\nbe downright dull. Its great moments are, indeed, many. The variety\r\nand vitality of the questions at issue there and its personalities\r\nsecure it against tediousness. For Disraeli—as for most of those\r\nwho have once breathed its intoxicating atmosphere—it always had\r\nan absorbing charm. Joseph Gilles Biggar, one of the best known of\r\nthe Irish Party, lived in the House and for the House. Outside it\r\nhe had no interest or amusement. I happened to be talking to him\r\nin the Lobby during a sitting that was supposed to be dull, when a\r\ncolleague asked him whether he might go to a theatre for the evening.\r\nBiggar was then the Chief Whip of the Nationalist Party, and a stern\r\nmartinet. “Theatre!” he exclaimed contemptuously. “This is better\r\nthan a play, Mister. It is all real here.” Yet he was the man who,\r\nby the invention of obstruction, and its use, did most violence to\r\nits time-honoured and dearly cherished customs. The House of Commons\r\nis, indeed, a most alluring place. It has an interest of the highest\r\ndramatic intensity on the occasion of a big debate relating to the\r\npredominant political question of the day, which deeply stirs Party\r\npassions and prejudices, and brings down into the arena of the floor\r\nthe great chiefs to fight for principle with the keen and subtle\r\nweapon of the tongue.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Speaker.” So begins each Member who rises to address the House.\r\nOf all the speakers in the Chamber, Mr. Speaker speaks seldomest, and\r\nin the fewest words. The Speaker sits in his high-canopied Chair,\r\nnot to talk but to listen to talkers. Hours may pass, and “Order,\r\norder,” may be the only words spoken by Mr. Speaker. He guides the\r\ndeliberations of the House. He names the Member who is to continue\r\nthe debate. This is not a matter simply of “catching the Speaker’s\r\neye,” as it is popularly called. The Speaker does not always name\r\nthe Member upon whom his eye may first rest. On both sides of the\r\nHouse Members jump to their feet, eager to join in the debate, each\r\nstraining forward, or shaking his notes to attract the attention\r\nof Mr. Speaker. The Speaker’s selection of one from among these\r\ncompetitors to fix his wandering eye is careful and deliberate. If\r\nan opponent of the Bill has just spoken, it is almost certain that a\r\nsupporter will be selected to follow. The aim of the Speaker is to\r\nsecure that, as far as possible, every phase of opinion shall find\r\nexpression. In this he is assisted by lists given to him beforehand\r\nby the Whips of the different Parties, containing the names of\r\ntheir chief spokesmen in the debate. Therefore it is that Members\r\non opposite sides follow each other alternately, the only exception\r\nto the rule being that should a Minister, or one of the leading\r\noccupants of the Front Opposition Bench, intervene at any moment,\r\nhe has the right, more or less prescriptive, to be called on by the\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker follows the flow of discursive talk with what appears\r\nto be the most absorbing interest. Indeed, it is into his ears that\r\nthe Member “in possession of the House”—to use the traditional\r\nphrase—pours all his views and prognostications, all his fears and\r\nexpectations. It is, “Now, Mr. Speaker, let me say,” or “With great\r\nrespect, Mr. Speaker, I submit.” Accordingly, the Speaker may not\r\nbetake himself, even for a little while, to his own select and\r\nprofitable thoughts. He must always be seized of the drift of the\r\nargument of the Member who is addressing him. At any moment he may be\r\ncalled upon to rule a point of order. His faculties must always be\r\nwide awake. At any moment some emergency may arise, without the least\r\nforewarning, when all his authority, tact, and common sense will be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIt is said there are Judges of the High Court who can sleep during\r\nthe speeches of counsel, and wake up at the moment that the\r\nslumberous presentation of argument is concluded. The atmosphere of\r\nthe House of Commons is often drowsy. Members may be seen asleep on\r\nthe benches at all hours. Yet it is a remarkable fact that there is\r\nonly one instance on record of a Speaker—impassive figure though\r\nhe be, in a big wig and a flowing gown, reclining in a large Chair\r\nunder a spreading canopy—having been caught nodding or napping. It\r\nwas to Shaw-Lefevre, the only Speaker over whom tired Nature asserted\r\nitself, and whose weighted lids, despite his desperate resistance,\r\nwere finally closed in slumber, that Mackworth Praed addressed these\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n      Sleep, Mr. Speaker; it’s only fair,\r\n      If you don’t in your bed, you should in your Chair,\r\n      Longer and longer still they grow,\r\n      Tory and Radical, Aye and No.\r\n      Talking by night and talking by day;\r\n      Sleep, Mr. Speaker, sleep while you may.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Printed in Great Britain by_\r\n                       UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED\r\n                          WOKING AND LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This statutory provision was temporarily suspended during the\r\nGreat War. It was provided by an Act passed in December 1916, making\r\ncertain new Ministerial appointments, and additional Secretaries or\r\nUnder-Secretaries, that during the continuance of the War, and for\r\nsix months afterwards, the limitation on the number of Principal\r\nSecretaries and Under-Secretaries who may sit and vote in the House\r\nof Commons, shall not have effect.\r\n\r\n[2] In the Coalition Government during the Great War there were two\r\nChief Whips, one Liberal, the other Unionist, each styled “Joint\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,” and paid £2,000.\r\n\r\n[3] Sir Edward Grey, speaking at a public meeting in 1911, when he\r\nwas Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, humorously objected to\r\nbeing referred to as the “Foreign Secretary.” “I am told,” said\r\nhe, “it gives the impression that, if I am not in the service of\r\nforeigners, I am at least an alien.”\r\n\r\n[4] Three other Ministries were temporarily created for the purposes\r\nof the War—Munitions and Shipping and Food. They were brought to an\r\nend in 1921.\r\n\r\n[5] A Committee of the House of Commons appointed to consider the\r\nsalaries of Ministers, owing to the great rise in the cost of living,\r\nfollowing the World War, recommended, in 1921, that the salary of the\r\nPrime Minister be raised to £8,000, that the salary of all Ministers\r\nof Cabinet rank be £5,000; that the salary of second class Ministers\r\nbe £3,000, third class Ministers, £2,000, and that Under-Secretaries\r\nand Parliamentary Secretaries be paid £1,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added,\r\n  when a predominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg 21: ‘emanate fron the’ replaced by ‘emanate from the’.\r\n  Pg 25: ‘by a votor’ replaced by ‘by a voter’.\r\n  Pg 29: ‘petitions impunging’ replaced by ‘petitions impugning’.\r\n  Pg 37: ‘in order to forestal’ replaced by ‘in order to forestall’.\r\n  Pg 38: ‘in still in vogue’ replaced by ‘is still in vogue’.\r\n  Pg 41: ‘the custon for’ replaced by ‘the custom for’.\r\n  Pg 82: ‘seemed eminent’ replaced by ‘seemed imminent’.\r\n  Pg 92: ‘appropriating portion’ replaced by ‘appropriating a portion’.\r\n  Pg 95: ‘It weights’ replaced by ‘It weighs’.\r\n  Pg 98: ‘not tongue to’ replaced by ‘nor tongue to’.\r\n  Pg 163: ‘George Cornewell’ replaced by ‘George Cornewall’.\r\n  Pg 174: ‘red dispatch box’ replaced by ‘red despatch box’.\r\n  Pg 198: ‘or the prefessions’ replaced by ‘or the professions’.\r\n  Pg 228: ‘the House wi hout’ replaced by ‘the House without’.\r\n  Pg 247: ‘said Joseph Cowan’ replaced by ‘said Joseph Cowen’.",
