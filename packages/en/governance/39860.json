Several friendly reviewers of that work objected, not\r\nunjustly, that its title was something of a misnomer, or at least an\r\nimperfect indication of its contents. It had, as a matter of fact,\r\noriginated remotely in a lecture delivered as preliminary to a course on\r\n\"Modern English Politicians\" (from Bolingbroke to Gladstone), the aim of\r\nthe prefatory address being to trace in older politics, home and\r\nforeign, general laws which should partly serve as guides to modern\r\ncases, or at least as preparation for their scientific study; while the\r\nmain course dealt with modern political problems as they have arisen in\r\nthe careers and been handled by the measures of modern English\r\nstatesmen. It was that opening exposition, developed into an essay, and\r\npublished as a series of magazine articles, that had been further\r\nexpanded into this treatise, by way of covering the ground more\r\nusefully; and the original name is therefore retained as a sub-title.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to explain that the book makes no pretension\r\nto being a complete or systematic treatment of political history, or of\r\npolitical forms and theories. The object in view from the first has\r\nbeen, not the technical anatomy or documentary history of institutions,\r\nbut the bringing into light of the ruling forces in all political life,\r\nancient and modern alike. It seeks to help the reader to fulfil the\r\nprecept of Montaigne: \"_Qu'il ne luy apprenne pas tant les histoires\r\nqu'a en juger._\"\r\n\r\nSince it was first written, there has been so much fresh sociological\r\nstudy of history that I need not repeat the justification originally\r\noffered for my undertaking. Alike as to ancient and modern history, the\r\neffort of scholars is now more and more towards comprehension of\r\nhistoric causation in terms of determining conditions, the economic\r\nabove all; so much so that I have profited somewhat in my revision from\r\nvarious recent works, and might with more leisure have done so more\r\nfully. Revised as it is, however, the book may serve to expound views of\r\nhistory which are still not generally accepted, and to call in question\r\nfallacious formulas which seem to me still unduly common.\r\n\r\nOn any view, much remains to be done before the statement of historic\r\ncausation can reach scientific thoroughness; and it may well be that\r\nsome of my theories will incur modification. All I claim for them is\r\nthat they are made in the light of a study of the concrete process; and\r\nI am satisfied that fuller light is to be obtained only in that\r\ndirection. In the end, doubtless, conflicts of historical interpretation\r\nwill turn upon problems of psychology. A contemporary German expert of\r\ndistinction, Prof. Lamprecht, in his able lectures on the problem _What\r\nis History?_ (Eng. trans. 1905), lays it down that the main problem of\r\nevery scientific history of mankind is the \"deducing from the history of\r\nthe most important communities of men the evolution of the breadth of\r\nconsciousness\"; and again that \"the full historical comprehension of a\r\nsingle change or of a single phenomenon, with their historical\r\nsignificance, can only be acquired from the most general principles;\r\nthat is to say, from the application of the highest universal-historical\r\ncategories.\" If I understand Prof. Lamprecht aright, he here means\r\nsimply that we properly understand the motivation of men in the past in\r\nterms of our own psychosis, conceived as in touch only with their data.\r\nThis seems to me substantially sound. But on the other hand I doubt the\r\nutility of his apparent purpose of explaining modern historic\r\ndevelopments in terms of special psychic changes or movements in\r\ncommunities, considered as forces. That way seems to lie reversion to\r\nthe old and vain device of explaining the course of nations in terms of\r\ntheir \"characters.\"\r\n\r\nIn any case, however, we have Prof. Lamprecht's avowal that \"It would be\r\na study of great value to establish, by comparative work in universal\r\nhistory, what are the constantly recurring economic factors of each\r\nperiod which are so uniformly followed by the development of other\r\nhigher intellectual values.\" That is as full a recognition of the\r\n\"economic factor\" as I am concerned to contend for, if it be understood\r\nthat economic motives are on the one hand recognised as affecting social\r\naction in general, and on the other that varying forms of social\r\nmachinery react variously on intellectual life. Upon such hypotheses the\r\nfollowing inquiry proceeds; to such conclusions it leads.\r\n\r\nObviously all critical exposition, historical or other, is an attempt to\r\ninfluence the psychic processes of the reader, to make him \"feel\" this\r\nand \"think\" that; and in this sense any resulting change of conduct\r\nmeans the play of \"the psychic factor.\" But that is only another way of\r\nsaying that the psychic factor is conditioned by material circumstances,\r\nby knowledge, and by ignorance. To insist on the perpetual social\r\nsignificance of all three is the general aim of this book.\r\n\r\n_September, 1912._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL FORCES IN ANCIENT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJECT MATTER\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nPolitics, in its most general and fundamental character, is the strife\r\nof wills on the ground of social action. As international politics is\r\nthe sum of the strifes and compromises of States, so home politics is\r\nthe sum of the strifes and compromises of classes, interests, factions,\r\nsects, theorists, in all countries and in all ages. In studying it,\r\nthen, we study the evolution of an aggregate, a quasi-organism, in terms\r\nof the clashing forces of its units and of their spontaneous\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThis may seem too obvious and simple a truth to need formal telling; and\r\nyet no truth is more often missed or set aside by writers who deal with\r\npolitical history. The past course of nations, when it is sought to be\r\nexplained at all, is by two writers out of three accounted for by\r\ncertain supposed qualities of character in the given nation as a whole,\r\ninstead of by the specially conditioned play of forces common to all\r\npeoples.[1] For instance, M. Taine, in the preface to the first volume\r\nof his fascinating work, _Les origines de la France contemporaine_, goes\r\nabout to justify his own political indifferentism by stating that in\r\neighty years his country had thirteen times changed its constitution.\r\n\"_We_,\" he says, have done this; and \"_we_ have not yet found that which\r\nsuits _us_.\"[2] It is here implied that a body of men collectively and\r\nconcurrently seeking for a fixed constitution have failed, and that the\r\nfailure is discreditable--that those who thus seek and fail have been\r\nbadly employed. It is by implication denied that successive changes of a\r\nconstitution may fitly be regarded as a process of growth and healthy\r\nadjustment of parts: the ideal of political health is assumed to be a\r\nstate of fixity. Thus does indifferentism, naturally if not necessarily,\r\nmiss the point of view from which itself is to be studied as one of the\r\nforces whose conflict the true historian ought to analyse.\r\n\r\nThere is no national \"we\" aiming collectively at a fixed and final\r\nconstitution; nor are the successive constitutions of France as such\r\nmore significant of failure or permanent harm than the successive\r\nchanges in the professedly unchanged constitution of Great Britain,\r\nthough the violent kinds of change are as such harmful. If M. Taine had\r\nbut applied with rigour the logic he once before prescribed, soundly if\r\nwittily, for all problems alike, he could not have begun his history\r\nwith that delusive abstraction of a one-minded community, failing to\r\nachieve \"their\" or \"its\" purpose. \"_Je n'en sais rien_,\" he remarks with\r\na shrug, over the protest of M. Royer-Collard that certain scientific\r\nreasoning will make Frenchmen revolutionary; \"_est-ce qu'il y a des\r\nFrancais?_\"[3] In dead earnest he now assumes that France consists just\r\nof the single species \"Frenchmen,\" whose constitution-building is a\r\ncorporate attempt to build a French house to live in; when all that is\r\ntruly historical in his own book goes to show clearly enough that French\r\nconstitutions, like all others, are products of ever-varying and\r\nconflicting passions and interests of sets of people in France who are\r\n\"Frenchmen\" merely when they happen to act in concert against other\r\ngeographical groups. At no moment were all of the French people\r\nconsenting parties to any one of the thirteen constitutions. Then there\r\nwas no collective failure.\r\n\r\nOf course M. Taine knew this well enough in his capacity of narrator;\r\nbut as teacher he could not escape from the rut dug for his thought by\r\nhis fatalism. He must needs make the synthetic abstraction of \"we,\"\r\nwhich excludes the political analysis essential to any practical\r\nexplanation; and it inevitably followed that his generalisations were\r\nmerely pseudo-biological, and not what is most wanted in\r\nhistory--sociological truth rooted in psychology and biology. In\r\ndenuding himself alike of hopes and fears, M. Taine really gave the\r\ngreat illustration of the truth of his own penetrating comment on\r\nMerimee,[4] that he who will be duped by nothing ends in being the dupe\r\nof his distrust. He will not be duped by this ideal or that; he will not\r\ncare enough for any to have a strong wish to see it realised; and so he\r\ncomes to be duped by the wish to disprove all, to work down all\r\nsociology to the plane of cynical pseudo-biology. The enthusiastic\r\namateur can show it, can convict the critic of hearing only the devil's\r\nadvocate in every moral process,[5] and of becoming at length the\r\nhistoric oracle of those, of all readers, who are most alien to his\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nSuch an outcome, in the work of such a critic, is vividly instructive.\r\nAt worst, indeed, he has a positive value as the extremest reactionist\r\nagainst the merely partisan method of history, which is almost all we\r\nhave had in England since the French Revolution, down to the other day.\r\nAfter M. Taine has passed, fools' paradises must needs fall in market\r\nvalue. But when the devil's advocate has made his round, we must still\r\nplough and eat, and the paradises must just be laid out for new sowing.\r\nThe evil of theoretical extremes is not so much their falsehood as their\r\nirrelevance. If we are to instruct each other in conduct, it must be in\r\nterms of sympathies and antipathies; and if we are to profit by a study\r\nof politicians, who are among the most generally typical of men, and of\r\npolitics, which is the expression of so much of life, we must go about\r\nit as humanists and not as fatalists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nHumanity, however, will not suffice to save us from false philosophy if,\r\nas humanists, we seek to gain our polemical ends by M. Taine's didactic\r\nmethods. He, naturally so much of an analyst, took to pseudo-synthesis\r\nwhen he wished with little labour to discredit certain popular\r\naspirations. But pseudo-synthesis is the favourite expository process of\r\nmany men with ardent aspirations, and of many writers who are friendly\r\nenough to the aspirations of their fellows. By pseudo-synthesis I mean\r\nthat process, above exemplified, of \"cooking\" an intricate moral problem\r\nby setting up one or more imaginary entities, to whose volition or\r\npotency the result is attributed. It was the method of medieval science;\r\nand it is still popular among the experts as well as the amateurs of\r\nhistorical science. It was the ordinary expedient of Comte, in whose\r\npages history becomes a Jonsonian masque of personified abstractions;\r\nand Buckle too often resorts to it. But hear a learned and judicious\r\nEnglish Liberal, not to be suspected of doctrinary extravagance:--\r\n\r\n     \"As in time past Rome had sacrificed domestic freedom that she\r\n     might be the mistress of others, so now\" [in the later Empire] \"to\r\n     be universal she, the conqueror, had descended to the level of the\r\n     conquered\" [in respect of Caracalla's edict giving to all subjects\r\n     of the Empire the rights of Roman citizenship]. \"But the sacrifice\r\n     had not wanted its reward. From her came the laws and the language\r\n     that had overspread the world; at her feet the nations laid the\r\n     offerings of their labour; she was the head of the Empire and of\r\n     civilisation.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe \"she\" of this passage I take to be as purely imaginary an entity as\r\nPhlogiston; and it is not easy to see how a method of explanation which\r\nin physical science is found worse than barren can give any edification\r\nin the study of history. To say nothing of the familiar explanation that\r\nCaracalla's sole motive in conferring the citizenship on the provincials\r\nwas the desire to lay on them corresponding taxes,[7] the proposition\r\nhas no footing in political actualities. \"Rome's self-abnegation that\r\nshe might Romanise the world\"[8] expresses no fact in Roman volition,\r\nthought, or deed; it is not the mention of a sentiment which swayed\r\nmen's action, but the attempt to reduce a medley of actions to the\r\nsemblance of a joint volition. There was no \"Rome\" capable of\r\n\"self-abnegation\" and susceptible of \"reward.\" Why, then, should it be\r\nsaid? It is said either because the writer permits himself to fill in a\r\nperspective with a kind of pigment which he would not employ in his\r\nforeground, or because he is still too much under the sway of old\r\nmethods when he is generalising conventional knowledge instead of\r\nanalytically reaching new.[9] Either way the lapse is only too\r\nintelligible. And if an innovating expert, dealing with old facts, runs\r\nsuch risks, great must be those run by plain people when they seek to\r\nattain a generalised knowledge of facts which are the battle-ground of\r\ncurrent ideals. Only by perpetual analysis can we hope partly to escape\r\nthe snare of the pseudo-synthetic, the traps of rhetoric and exegetic\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nThe term \"pseudo-synthesis\" implies, of course, that there may be a true\r\nsynthesis. What is necessary to such synthesis is that there shall have\r\nbeen a preliminary analysis; but a synthesis once justly made is the\r\ngreatest of helps to new analyses. Now there is one such which may\r\nsafely be brought to bear on the study of practical politics, because it\r\nis an axiom alike of inorganic physics and of biology, and a commonplace\r\nof human science, though seldom used as a means of historic\r\ngeneralisation. This is the simple principle that all energy divides\r\nostensibly into forces of attraction and of repulsion.\r\n\r\n     [The principle thus stated should be compared with the theorem of\r\n     Kant as to the correlative forces of sociability and unsociability\r\n     (_Idee zu einer allgemein Geschichte_), and the important and\r\n     luminous formula of Professor Giddings, that all sociological\r\n     processes, properly so called, turn upon \"consciousness of kind\"\r\n     (_Principles of Sociology_, 1896, 3rd ed. pp. 17-19, and Preface;\r\n     and in earlier writings by Professor Giddings, there mentioned).\r\n     The scientific value of that formula is obvious; but other ways of\r\n     stating the case may still serve a purpose. The view in the text I\r\n     find to have been partly anticipated by Shaftesbury, _Essay on the\r\n     Freedom of Wit and Humour_, 1709, pt. iii, Sec. 2 (_Characteristics_,\r\n     ed. 1733, i, pp. 111-12), who is followed by Eusebe Salverte, _De\r\n     la Civilisation depuis les premiers Temps historiques_, 1813, p.\r\n     53. Shaftesbury even anticipates in part the formula of Professor\r\n     Giddings in the passage: \"If anything be natural, in any Creature\r\n     or any Kind, 'tis that which is preservative of the Kind itself,\"\r\n     and in the sequel. As Professor Giddings traces (pref. to 3rd ed.\r\n     p. x) the first suggestion of his \"consciousness of kind\" to Adam\r\n     Smith's _Theory of the Moral Sentiments_, which is certainly in\r\n     the line of descent from Shaftesbury, there may really be a causal\r\n     connection.]\r\n\r\nThat principle obviously holds of the relations of men in society as it\r\ndoes of their muscular action and of their moral and intellectual life;\r\nand so fundamental is the fact that when we study human history in view\r\nof it, we find it more and more difficult to suppose that it will ever\r\ncease to hold. That is to say, it is almost impossible to conceive state\r\nof life in which the forces of attraction and repulsion shall not\r\noperate energetically in the moral and intellectual relations of human\r\nbeings. From the primitive and the barbaric stages in which the sight of\r\nan alien moves the savage to such destructive rage as is seen in some\r\ndogs at the sight of others, or in which a difference of personal odour\r\nrouses a no less spontaneous repulsion--as in Chinese against Europeans,\r\nor in Europeans against Chinese[10]--down to the fierce battle in\r\nself-governing countries over every innovating law, or that strife of\r\nopinion in which these lines play their part, the clash of opposing\r\ntendencies is perpetual, ubiquitous, inevitable. And so difficult is it\r\nto conceive any cessation that at once many observers leap from the\r\ngeneral principle to the particular conclusion that all the _modes_ in\r\nwhich the action and reaction, the attractions and repulsions of\r\nindividuals and groups, have operated in the past must needs operate in\r\nthe future. They conclude, that is, that the particular phenomenon of\r\nWAR, above all, is chronic, and can never definitely disappear. Thus M.\r\nZola, looking around him and finding strife everywhere, decides that all\r\nthe past _forms_ of strife are inevitably recurrent.[11] It may be well\r\nat the outset to insist that the general principle involves no such\r\nparticular necessity.\r\n\r\nWar is simply a form in which the instincts of attraction and repulsion\r\nhave operated in human societies during ages in which certain\r\npsychological and physiological types have been normal. It may very well\r\nrecur, with growing infrequency, for a long time to come; but it is not\r\nrationally to be regarded as a necessary function of the grand\r\nbiological forces. What does seem certain is a different thing--that the\r\nforces of attraction and repulsion will always operate in _some_ form;\r\nand that the very fact of their finding less expression in the mode of\r\nphysical strife will imply their coming into play in other modes, such\r\nas the strife of ideals, doctrines, and class interests as they are\r\nexpressed in politics without bloodshed. The general law is that the\r\nforces of attraction and repulsion, as exhibited in human thought or\r\nfeeling, run during the earlier stages of growth in channels which may\r\nbe broadly regarded as animal; and that when altered political and\r\nsocial conditions partly or wholly close these channels, the biological\r\nforces open for themselves new ones.\r\n\r\nWar is precisely the blindest, the least rational, the least human of\r\nall the forms of human conflict, inasmuch as it is the collective\r\nclashing of communities whose members, divided among themselves by many\r\nreal differences of interest, bias, and attraction, are set against each\r\nother, as wholes--if by anything higher than animal pugnacity--either by\r\nthe mere ideals or appetites of rulers or leaders, or by more or less\r\nimaginary differences of interest, seen under the moral illusion of the\r\nmost primitive of social instincts--the _sensus gregis_. As evolution\r\nproceeds, the blind form may be expected to disappear, and the more\r\nreasoned forms--that is, the inter-social and intellectual--to develop.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is one of the shortcomings of Buckle that, though he at\r\nleast once (_Introd. to Hist. of Civ. in Eng._, Routledge's ed. p. 352)\r\nrecognises the futility of explaining history in terms of national\r\ncharacter, he repeatedly lapses to that method, and speaks of peoples as\r\nif they were of one will, bent, and mind.

The habit of summing up all Roman\r\nhistory as so many planned actions of \"the Romans,\" or of \"Rome,\" is in\r\nsingular contrast with the imbroglio of the records. In the social stage\r\ndiscovered to us by the analysis of the oldest known institutions,\r\n\"early\" Rome is already an artificial political organism, far removed\r\nfrom the simple life of tribal barbarism.[12] There are three tribes;\r\nthe very name of tribe, it may be, comes from the number three[13] in\r\nthe flection _tribus_; and the subdivisions are fixed by the numbers\r\nthree and ten.[14] Behind the artificial \"tribe\" is a past in which, it\r\nmay be, a group of villages forms the _pagus_ or settlement.[15]\r\n\r\nAlready privilege and caste are fully established, even between classes\r\nof freemen; and only by inference can we reach the probable first bases\r\nof civic union among the ruling caste. They were clearly a caste of\r\nconquerors. Their _curiae_, apparently the oldest form of group after the\r\nfamily or the clan,[16] are artificially arranged, numbering thirty,\r\neach _curia_ containing nominally a hundred _gentes_, each _gens_\r\nnominally ten families.\r\n\r\n     Eduard Meyer (_Geschichte des Alterthums_, ii, 511) decides for the\r\n     view of L. Lange, that the historic appellation of Roman citizens,\r\n     _Quirites_, derives from _curia_. The ancients had several theories\r\n     as to the name. One (Festus) was that the Sabine goddess Curis gave\r\n     her name to the Sabine town Cures (cp. Athene, Athenai), whence,\r\n     according to the legend, had come a band under Titus Tatius, who\r\n     conquered the Capitoline and Quirinal hills, and had for tribe-god\r\n     Quirinus. Cp. Ihne, _Early Rome_, p. 82. Mommsen (Eng. tr. 1862, i,\r\n     57, 78, _notes_) has secured currency for the other tradition,\r\n     argued for by F.W. Newman (_Regal Rome_, 1852, pp. 55-56), that the\r\n     root is the Sabine word _curis, quiris_, a spear. For this somewhat\r\n     unplausible theory there is support in the fact that in the cognate\r\n     Gaelic _coir_, pronounced quir, means a spear, and that there is\r\n     derived thence _curiadh_, a warrior. Mommsen is followed by\r\n     Merivale, _General History of Rome_, 5th ed. p. 13; and Greenidge,\r\n     _Roman Public Life_, p. 33. Pott and Becker, who derived _Quirites_\r\n     from _curia_, explain the latter word as _co-viria_, the band of\r\n     warriors. And as the view that \"Athene\" comes from \"Athenai,\" not\r\n     _vice versa_, has the stronger claims to acceptance, the more\r\n     acceptable presumption is that \"Curis\" and Quirinus evolved from\r\n     the _curia_. If _Quirites_ meant spearmen, how could Caesar be\r\n     understood to cow mutineers by simply addressing them as Quirites\r\n     [= citizens]? The curia theory is supported by the facts that \"the\r\n     Roman constitutional tradition ... makes the division into curies\r\n     alone originate with the origin of the city\"; that it \"appears as\r\n     an essential part of the Latin municipal system;\" and that of all\r\n     the old divisions it seems to be the only one that \"really\r\n     fulfilled important functions in the primitive constitutional\r\n     organisation\" (Mommsen, B. i, ch. v, pp. 73-75).\r\n\r\nThese _curiae_ may be conceived as derived from inner tribal or clan\r\ngroups formed in the conquering stage, since they are ostensibly united\r\nby their collective or curial _sacra_, the rites for which the grouped\r\n_gentes_--who each have their private _sacra_--assemble in a special\r\nplace, under a special priest. They still retain the usage of a common\r\nbanquet,[17] the earliest form of collective religion known to us.[18]\r\nApart from the members of the _curiae_ are the conquered _plebs_,[19]\r\n\"the many\" not enslaved, but payers of tribute; without share in the\r\n_curiae_ or vote in the _comitia_, or assembly, and without part in the\r\ncurial or other _sacra_.\r\n\r\n     On this head there has been some gratuitous confusion. Schwegler\r\n     (i, 621 _sq._) gives convincing reasons for the view that in early\r\n     times the plebs were not members of the _curiae_. Cp. Ihne, as\r\n     cited, pp. 110, 127; and Fustel de Coulanges, p. 278 _sq._ Meyer\r\n     (ii, 513, 521) asserts, on the contrary, without any specification\r\n     of periods, that the _curiae_ included plebeians as well as\r\n     patricians. The contradiction seems to arise out of inattention to\r\n     chronology, or a misreading of Mommsen. That historian rightly sets\r\n     forth in his history (B. ii, ch. i; Eng. trans. ed. 1862, i,\r\n     264-65) that the plebs were not admitted into the _comitia curiata_\r\n     before the \"Servian\" period; adding that these bodies were \"at the\r\n     same time\" almost totally deprived of their prerogatives. In his\r\n     _Roemisches Forschungen_, 1864, i, 144 _sq._, he shows that they\r\n     were admitted in the \"_historic_ period\"--when the _comitia_ in\r\n     question had ceased to have any legal power, and when, as he\r\n     elsewhere states, the admission \"practically gave little more than\r\n     the capacity for adrogation\" (_Roemisches Staatsrecht_, Bd. iii,\r\n     Abth. i, p. 93). Here again he states that \"to equal rights in the\r\n     curies, especially to the right of vote in the comitia, the\r\n     plebeians attained only in the later times\" (_Id._ p. 72). Yet\r\n     Professor Pelham, in asserting (p. 21; cp. p. 46) that \"the\r\n     _primitive_ Roman people of the thirty _curiae_ included all the\r\n     freemen of the community, _simple as well as gentle_,\" gives the\r\n     note: \"The view here taken on the vexed question of the purely\r\n     patrician character of the _curiae_ is that of Mommsen (_Roem.\r\n     Forschungen_, vol. i).\"\r\n\r\n     When this error is corrected, the question ceases to be vexed.\r\n     Schwegler has disposed of the blunder of Dionysius, who ascribes to\r\n     the plebeians a share in the _curiae_ from the beginning; and it is\r\n     not disputed that they were allowed to enter when the _comitia\r\n     curiata_ had been practically superseded by the _comitia\r\n     centuriata_. It is to be noted that the denial of the inclusion of\r\n     the plebeians in the original _curiae_ does not apply to the\r\n     _clientes_, whose status, though non-patrician, had been different\r\n     from that of the true plebs. M. Delaunay, who argues that the\r\n     plebeians were all along admitted to the _curiae_, adds the\r\n     qualification: \"Doubtless not the entire mass of the plebeians, but\r\n     only those who were ... attached to the gentes\" (Robiou et\r\n     Delaunay, _Les Institutions de l'ancienne Rome_, 1884, i, 21). But\r\n     who were these _gentilitia_ if not the _clientes_? (cp. _loc. cit._\r\n     p. 26).\r\n\r\n     The _populus_ at this stage, then, is not \"the people\" in the\r\n     modern sense; it is the aggregate of the privileged _curiae_, and\r\n     does not include the plebs,[20] which at this stage is not even\r\n     part of the army. But a separate quasi-plebeian class, the\r\n     _clientes_ of the patricians, are in a state of special dependence\r\n     upon the latter, and in a subordinate fashion share their\r\n     privileges.\r\n\r\n     The _clientes_ have very much the air of being primarily the\r\n     servile or inferior part of the early clan or _gens_, as distinct\r\n     from its \"gentlemen.\" Cp. Burton, _Hist. of Scotland_, viii,\r\n     524-25, as to the lower and the higher (duniewassal) orders in the\r\n     Scottish Highland clans. \"In the old life of the _pagus_ and the\r\n     _gens_ the weaker sought the protection of the stronger by a\r\n     willing vassalage\" (Greenidge, _Roman Public Life_, p. 6). The\r\n     _clientes_ are the nominal as distinct from the real \"family\" of\r\n     the chief or _patronus_. M. Delaunay (_Les Institutions de\r\n     l'ancienne Rome_, as cited, i, 27) thinks with Mommsen (so also\r\n     Dupond, pp. 20-21) that they were mainly freedmen, but gives no\r\n     evidence. As to the meaning and etymology of the word (_clientes_\r\n     from _cluere_ or _cliere_, \"to listen\" or \"obey\"), cp. Newman,\r\n     _Regal Rome_, p. 49; Ortolan, p. 29; Mommsen, _Roemisches\r\n     Staatsrecht_, III, i, 1887, p. 63. The theory that the plebeians\r\n     were all _clientes_ (Ortolan, pp. 25, 27) seems untenable, though\r\n     Mommsen (_Staatsrecht_, III, i, 63) pronounces that \"all\r\n     non-patricians were clients\"; and Meyer (ii, 521) appears to\r\n     acquiesce. Only in theory can the mass of the plebs have been\r\n     clients at any time. Cp. Fustel de Coulanges, pp. 277-78. The\r\n     _clientes_, it seems clear, were as such admitted to the _comitia_,\r\n     whereas the plebs were not. See the citations of Fustel de\r\n     Coulanges from Livy, ii, 56-64; also iii, 14 (Dupond, p. 22, doubts\r\n     the fact). On any view, the _clientela_ rapidly dwindled, passing\r\n     into the plebs (cp. Dupond, p. 23; Livy, vi, 18). As to its early\r\n     status see Fustel de Coulanges, p. 273 _sq._ Ortolan, after\r\n     representing all plebeians as clients, speaks (p. 31) of plebeians\r\n     belonging to no gens (so Aulus Gellius, x, 20).\r\n\r\n     Wealth is not yet a matter of land-owning--the main element of\r\n     property is cattle;[21] and the bulk of the land is _ager\r\n     occupatorius_, a great \"common\" on which all men's cattle feed.\r\n     The voteless free plebeian has simply his home and homestead, \"toft\r\n     and croft,\" the latter being two yokes (= five roods) of land, on\r\n     which he raises the grain and olives and vegetables that feed his\r\n     household.[22] This goes to his heir. Here arises another problem.\r\n     E.W. Robertson (as last cited) decides that the \"two yokes\" can\r\n     have been only \"the homestead, and could not have included the farm\r\n     or property attached to it.\" The _heredium_, he holds, following\r\n     Pliny (_Hist. Nat._, xix, 19), and citing Livy (vi, 36), was only\r\n     in the _hortus_, the house and garden, \"and not in the arable or\r\n     pasture land.\" But surely the arable was on a different footing\r\n     from the pasture land (_ager compascus_). Corn was not grown in\r\n     common, unless it were by the _gentes_ (Mommsen, vol. i, pp. 38,\r\n     72, 193). The solution seems to be that given by Greenidge, that as\r\n     \"the _heredium_ consisted only of two _jugera_ (Festus, p. 53), an\r\n     amount obviously insufficient for the maintenance of a family,\"\r\n     \"there must have been _ager privatus_ as well, owned by some larger\r\n     unit, and this unit would naturally have been the gens\" (_Roman\r\n     Public Life_, p. 15).\r\n\r\n     Among general historians of Rome Mommsen seems to be the first to\r\n     note this circumstance, and he gives neither details nor evidence.\r\n     Schwegler, discussing (i, 619) the theory of Puchta that there was\r\n     no private property in Rome before the \"arrival\" of the plebs,\r\n     admits that among the ancient Germans the land was yearly\r\n     apportioned among the groups as such, but finds that \"Roman\r\n     tradition tells of nothing of the kind.\" (So Greenidge, p. 15.) In\r\n     any case, Mommsen, while insisting that \"the fields (_sic_) of the\r\n     gentes (_Geschlechts-Genossen_) in the earliest period lay\r\n     together\" (_Staatsrecht_, III, i, 24; cp. p. 94), admits that such\r\n     gentile ownership had at an early stage disappeared (_frueh\r\n     verschwundenen_). There was then no communal tillage in the\r\n     historic period. Cincinnatus, in the legend, returns to the plough\r\n     on his own croft. Further, the early complaints cited by Livy as to\r\n     the \"two yokes\" being \"hardly enough to raise a roof on or to make\r\n     a grave in\" were addressed by the tribunes on behalf of plebeians\r\n     to patricians who each had above five hundred yokes. The non-client\r\n     plebeians then had no share in the land of the _gentes_ or clans,\r\n     being themselves in large part dispossessed by conquest.\r\n\r\n     Meyer (ii, 519) pronounces that the plot of two yokes was, \"of\r\n     course, no farm, but a kitchen-garden,\" adding: \"It is also the\r\n     personal land of the small farmers and day-labourers who look after\r\n     the lands of the large landholders, not the original private\r\n     holding in contrast to the mark belonging in common to the _gens_\r\n     (_Geschlecht_) or commune (_Gauverband_).\" But on the previous page\r\n     Meyer says that \"the land was settled not by the _gentes_, but\r\n     communally (_genossenschaftlich_) by unions of equal freemen.\" If\r\n     these, then, were the _curiae_ (the Mark, says Meyer in this\r\n     connection, did _not_ belong to the _gentes_), they did not include\r\n     the plebs; and we come back to the datum that the free plebeian had\r\n     no means of support save his five roods and what beasts he had on\r\n     the public pasture. The pasture-land, again, is surmised by Mommsen\r\n     (ch. xiii, p. 201) to have been small in area relatively to the\r\n     arable-land communally owned and cultivated by the _gentes_ or\r\n     clans--a proposition irreconcilable with the evidence as to the\r\n     quantity of cattle. As to the two yokes of land, Schwegler decides\r\n     (i, 618) that it was \"nowise inadequate\" as arable-land, in view of\r\n     the extraordinary fruitfulness of Italy, and, further, of the\r\n     circumstance that \"the free burghers had also the use of the common\r\n     land\" (for pasture). We are to remember that Italian land could\r\n     yield two crops in a year. (Niebuhr, _Lebensnachrichten_, ii, 245,\r\n     cited by Schwegler.)\r\n\r\n     On the general problem as to why or how the land once communally\r\n     tilled ceased to be so, we have still no better light than the old\r\n     generalisation of Hobbes in reply to his own question: \"Upon what\r\n     impulsives, when all was equally every man's in common, men did\r\n     rather think it fitting that every man should have his inclosure?\"\r\n     \"I found,\" he puts it, \"that from a community of goods there must\r\n     needs arise contention whose enjoyment should be greatest, and from\r\n     that contention all kind of calamities must unavoidably ensue.\"\r\n     [Epistle Dedicatory to _Philosophical Rudiments concerning\r\n     Government and Civil Society_ (translation of _De Cive_), 1651. Cp.\r\n     Goldwin Smith, _The United States_, 1893, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe patrician, of course, had a larger homestead, at least \"four yokes\"\r\nin the earlier stages; later seven; later still twenty-five.[23] But the\r\npatricians were \"a class of occupying landholders rather than\r\nproprietary landowners.\"[24] The \"public land\" was literally so, save in\r\nso far as the patricians would have the ampler (and often untaxed or\r\nlow-rented) use of it for their much larger herds;[25] or, it may be,\r\nfor cultivation by their clients or slaves. _Heredia_, however, were\r\nsaleable, and herein lay one usual path to the dispossession and\r\nenslavement of freemen; while at all stages there went on that pressure\r\nof population on means of subsistence which underlies all economic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThus far, however, mere conquest has done less to impoverish and enslave\r\nthe mass than the economic process is to do later. The conquerors,\r\nprobably highland herdsmen to begin with, take estates for themselves,\r\nbut leave the mass of the conquered in possession or use of land for\r\nwhich they pay tribute, and upon which they can independently live.[26]\r\nAnd thus far they live mainly as small pastoral farmers.[27]\r\n\r\nTrade and artisanship were for long but slightly developed, and were\r\nmainly in the hands of slaves, dependent \"clients,\" or foreigners; and\r\nartisans and aliens were not admitted into the legions.[28] The ruling\r\ncaste occupied, potentially[29] if not constantly, the city proper, the\r\ntwo or three fortified hills[30] on which at this stage it stands. They\r\nwere certainly not the founders. The Palatine and the Quirinal hills had\r\nbeen occupied by Latins and Sabines respectively long before the time\r\ntraditionally assigned to the \"founding\" of Rome; and there were\r\ncommunities there before them. Modern excavators trace many successive\r\nstrata of civilisation before that which we call the Roman; and the\r\nprobability is that the Romans of history, like the kindred Sabines,\r\nconquered a previous city \"aristocracy\" of kindred race, whose place and\r\npossessions they took. The previous inhabitants had presumably grown\r\nweak for self-defence by reason of some such disintegrating economic\r\nevolution as was soon to affect the conquerors themselves. Such a\r\ndisintegration may well have taken place in the case of Alba Longa, of\r\nwhich the prior supremacy seems entirely credible.[31] But before Alba\r\nLonga there had been a civilisation[32] on the Roman hills which perhaps\r\noutwent in economic evolution anything attained in the Roman period\r\nuntil the last century of the Republic.\r\n\r\n     This was already inferred in the eighteenth century by Ferguson\r\n     (_History of the Roman Republic_, 1783, ch. i, _note_; perhaps\r\n     following Maffei [1727], cited by Schwegler, i, 807), from the\r\n     nature of the remains of the great _cloacae_, which he held could\r\n     not have been built by any of the early Roman kings. That view is\r\n     since adopted by various authorities; see Middleton's _Remains of\r\n     Ancient Rome_, 1892, i, 104-107; and Robiou et Delaunay, _Les\r\n     Institutions de l'ancienne Rome_, 1884, vol. ii, ch. i, Sec. 1. Cp.\r\n     Merivale, _General History of Rome_, pp. 9-11; Burton, _Etruscan\r\n     Bologna_, 1876, pp. 170-74. Livy (i, 38) ascribes great _cloacae_ to\r\n     the legendary Tarquin the elder. Professor Ettore Pais, on the\r\n     other hand, confidently decides that the _cloaca maxima_ belongs to\r\n     the republican period, and dates it about 170 B.C. In any case, we\r\n     know that an ante-Roman civilisation underlies the historic, and\r\n     may now decide with Mr. Mahaffy that \"as civilisation of some kind\r\n     was vastly older on the Hill of Troy than any of us had imagined,\r\n     so the site of every historic city is likely to have been the\r\n     habitation of countless generations\" (_Survey of Greek Civ._ 1897,\r\n     p. 28).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThere had in fact been a \"decline and fall of Rome\" before the Rome we\r\nknow began to be. Relatively to their predecessors, the early Romans\r\nwere even as the northerners who in a later age were to capture historic\r\nRome--vigorous barbarians beginning a new era on a footing of fraternity\r\nin conquest; and the condition of their early success as State-builders\r\nseems to have been precisely the joining of several tribe-groups in a\r\nreal federation,[33] securing local peace as between the hill-holders.\r\nIt has been said that Rome grew up without any known aid from men of\r\npolitical genius such as Solon.[34] But men of genius have counted for\r\nsomething in all stages of upward human evolution. The guiders of early\r\nRome are lost in a cloud of myth and fable; but some man or men of civic\r\nfaculty there must have been to shape tendency, though doubtless a main\r\nfactor in the early union was the simple _collocation_ of the hills\r\nfirst fortified. Granting that Servius Tullius is a mythical king, the\r\nelaborate constitution assigned to him stood for _some_ planning by able\r\nmen, and has several main points in common with that given to Athens by\r\nSolon.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the part played by individual leaders, Roman or Etruscan,\r\nthere clearly came into play in early Rome as in Athens the important\r\nfactor of mixture of stocks. Romans and Sabines united to begin with;\r\nand the conquered plebs, destined later to enter the constitution and\r\nshare in all the civic offices, represented some such source of\r\nrecuperation to the Roman aristocracy as did the Saxons to that of\r\nEngland after the Norman Conquest. If we add the probable factor of an\r\nEtruscan element, Rome is to be conceived as standing for a ruling class\r\nof more various faculty than was to be found in any of the rival\r\ncommunities singly. The progressive absorption of the most enterprising\r\nof the plebeians was again, probably, an exception to the rule of Italic\r\nlife as to that of other races, so that in following the class struggles\r\nof Rome we are to note not so much the violence of the process as the\r\nfact that, so far as it went, it was relatively fortunate. And its\r\nsuccess, again, is conceivably due to the fact, among others, that from\r\nan early period the region of the seven defensible hills was a refuge or\r\ncentre for men breaking away from the other Italian communities, where\r\nconservatism held firm.\r\n\r\nBehind the legend of the flocking of all manner of \"broken men\" to the\r\nstandard of Romulus lies the probability that the ancient \"asylum\"\r\nbehind the Capitol brought a variety of types to the place; and as in\r\nAthens so in Rome, such variety of stock might well raise the level of\r\nfaculty. But it was a faculty for aggression. Given the initial\r\nfederation of Romans and Sabines, the one general force of comity or\r\ncohesion, apart from the more public cults, is the bond of mere\r\ncollective antagonism to other communities. The total polity is one of\r\nwar; and never in the history of civilisation has that ground of comity\r\nlong averted the economic process by which social inequality deepens and\r\nwidens. It is thus entirely credible that, through this economic\r\nprocess, which we shall trace later, the early Roman polity came to a\r\npass at which its conquest by Etruscan \"kings\" was welcomed by the\r\nplebs, sinking into poverty or held in outlawry under primitive\r\n\"capitalistic\" exploitation. There is no clear historic record of the\r\nprocess; but all the better evidence goes to prove its occurrence.[35]\r\n\r\nThe most plausible theory of the constitution ascribed to Servius\r\nTullius is that it was imposed by Etruscan conquerors. The earlier\r\nRomans had been quasi-sacerdotally ruled by priest-kings of the\r\nprimitive type, \"kings of the sacrifice,\" whose religious powers were\r\nbalanced by the secular interest of the patrician heads of\r\nfamilies--themselves priests of their family cults. The \"Servian\"\r\nconstitution put down the _rex sacrificulus_, divided the city into four\r\ntribes, and its territory into twenty-six districts, each under a\r\nheadman or headmen. The city at the same time was in part new walled,\r\nand the seven hills united; while the mass of the free population were\r\ndivided into five classes according to their property, and enrolled for\r\nmilitary purposes in 193 \"centuries.\" In the first and richest class\r\nwere forty centuries of men above forty-six for the defence of the city,\r\nand forty of younger men for service in the field; while the second,\r\nthird, and fourth classes were divided into twenty centuries each, and\r\nthe fifth class into thirty. The poorest of all were grouped in a\r\nseparate century, the \"Proletarians,\" or \"breeders,\" without military\r\nduties; and the trumpeters, armourers, and carpenters in four more. New\r\nassemblies, the _comitia centuriata_, were formed, in which all members\r\nof the centuries shared, the old _comitia curiata_ being thus virtually\r\nsuperseded. The military organisation was made the basis of a fiscal\r\none, in which the classes were taxed on the capital value of their\r\nproperty. As freedom from direct taxation was the mark of the ancient\r\n\"free\" communities in general, the whole arrangement seems to be one\r\nthat only a conqueror could have imposed; and the tradition ran that\r\nServius was regarded as the friend of the poor, who made his birthday an\r\nannual festival.\r\n\r\nBut plebeian distress was probably not the sole, perhaps not the\r\nprimary, factor in the convulsion. All along, the process of inequality\r\nhad gone on among plebeians and patricians alike, some of the former\r\nrising to wealth and some of the latter sinking to relative poverty.\r\nThus arises in effect the struggle of a \"middle class\" to share the\r\npolitical and social privileges of the \"upper\"; and there is reason to\r\nthink that the Etruscan conquest was furthered by rich plebeians as\r\nagainst the patricians. The new constitution was what the Greeks called\r\na \"timocracy,\" or \"rule of property\"; and though in respect of the\r\n_comitia centuriata_ plebeians were admitted to the franchise, it was\r\nunder such provisions as to voting that the richer classes easily held\r\nthe balance of power.[36] At the same time the patricians retained the\r\nreligious power of the old kings, as custodians of the ritual\r\nmysteries--a great source of dominion. Thus the crisis was only\r\ntemporarily relieved, and the struggle was renewed again and again, both\r\nunder and after the kings. We can broadly divine that the anti-patrician\r\nrule of the king, who would rely on the plebs, unified against him the\r\npatricians or \"free\" citizens, who sought to keep down the masses;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the increasing outlaw plebs was unified by its\r\nsheer need.[37]\r\n\r\nAs to the rule of the kings, whether native or Etruscan, no exact\r\nknowledge is now possible. We can but trace some of their functions in\r\ncertain constitutional forms. Thus the Senate, or Council of the Elders,\r\nappears to have been the council of the king, selected by him, but\r\ncapable of nominating his successor.[38] Whatever were its original\r\nfunction, it became in time the supreme power in the State, growing\r\nalike in numbers and in power, overruling or eclipsing the _comitia\r\ncuriata_, _comitia centuriata_, and other bodies in which the general\r\nmass, first of patrician citizens and later of enfranchised plebeians,\r\nwere enrolled.[39] But it is not through the complicated archaeology of\r\nthe Roman constitution, latterly compiled with such an infinity of\r\nscholarly labour, that the nature of Roman evolution is really to be\r\nknown. The technique of the system resulted from an endless process of\r\ncompromise among social forces; and it is in the actual clash and play\r\nof those forces, as revealed in the simple records, that the human\r\nsignificance of it all is to be felt. In this way we substitute for a\r\nvague and false conception of unitary growth one of perpetual strife of\r\nclasses, interests, and individualities.\r\n\r\nIn the doubtful transition period, as the tradition goes, it is in the\r\ntime of discontented plebeian subjection, after the expulsion of the\r\nking (510 B.C.), that the Etruscan enemy captures the city (497); and\r\nthe surmise that the battle of Lake Regillus was not really a Roman\r\nvictory[40] is partly strengthened by the fact that soon after it there\r\noccur the division into twenty-five tribes, the tumults of the nexi, and\r\nthe successful Secession of the Plebs, ending in their incorporation,\r\nwith two tribunes to represent their interests (494). There is a clear\r\npresumption that only from a weakened patriciate, forced to seek union,\r\ncould the plebs have won their tribunate and enfranchisement. On the\r\nother hand, it is after victories over the Volscians that the consul\r\nSpurius Cassius, who had proposed to divide among landless men the land\r\nconquered from the Hernicans, is said to have been executed (485) by the\r\ntriumphant aristocracy; and it is in another period of security, when\r\nthe Veientines and Sabines are depressed (473), that the tribune Cneius\r\nGenucius is murdered for having ventured to bring a consular to trial.\r\nAlways we are in presence of a brutal caste, in the main utterly\r\nselfish, some of whose members are at all times as prone to the use of\r\nthe dagger as an Italian _camorra_ of our own day. Yet it is by the\r\nforcing of concessions on this caste that the Roman polity is kept\r\nvigorous and adaptable in comparison with those of the surrounding\r\nStates which Rome subordinated or overran.\r\n\r\nWhile Rome thrives, a new project for popular law reform is defeated\r\n(462); and it is after Cincinnatus, according to the legend, barely\r\nsaves the State (458) that the tribunes are raised from five to ten, and\r\nthe land is divided among the poor (456); though at the same time\r\ndecemvirs are appointed and the conservative Twelve (at first Ten)\r\nTables are drawn up (451-450). Thus partially strengthened, the plebs\r\nare able soon to force the abdication of the decemvirate (449) by the\r\nold menace of their withdrawal; and for a time the commonalty\r\nsufficiently holds its own, getting (445) the right of marriage with\r\npatricians, and (444) the institution of military tribunes with consular\r\npower;[41] though fresh distribution of land is prevented, and the\r\npatricians learn to divide the tribunes against each other. Thus class\r\ndissension goes on till the Gauls capture the city (390), multitudes of\r\nthe Romans flying to Veii. Then it is that the plebeian party, after the\r\nGauls have gone, are willing to transfer the seat of government to Veii;\r\nand the threat would doubtless win them some concessions in the\r\nrebuilding of Rome. But population always blindly increases; and the\r\ncancer of poverty spreads, despite the chronic planting of colonies in\r\nsubject territory. Manlius is executed for trying to relieve debtors;\r\nbut some land is reluctantly distributed. New wars create new popular\r\ndistress, and new colonies fail to relieve it. At length the Licinian\r\nlaws, relieving debtors and limiting estates, are proposed (376), and\r\nafter nine years of agitation are passed at the crisis (367) at which\r\nthe Gauls (who themselves had in the meantime undergone dissensions)\r\nagain attack Rome; while the powers of the consuls (limited in 443 by\r\nthe appointment of two Censors) are now further limited by the creation\r\nof a Praetor (patrician) and of Curule _aediles_, alternately taken from\r\nthe two strata.\r\n\r\nThis makes a temporary palliation, and in time the now privileged\r\nplebeians[42] lean to the patrician side and status; while fresh wars\r\nwith Hernicans, Gauls, Etruscans, and Samnites check class strife, and\r\nthe patricians recover preponderance, passing a law (358) to check \"new\r\nmen.\" This is immediately followed by counter measures, limiting\r\ninterest to ten per cent. and putting a five per cent. tax on\r\nmanumissions; but the eternal distress of debtors is renewed, and a vain\r\nattempt is made to meet it (352) by State loans, and again by reducing\r\ninterest to five per cent. (347). Increase of plebeian poverty again\r\ncauses reactions, and after a mutiny futile laws are passed prohibiting\r\ninterest altogether (342); the dictator Publilius carries popular\r\npolitical laws (339) checking the power of the Senate, and debtors are\r\nonce more protected (326). After many wars, checking all domestic\r\nprogress, popular distress causes a last Secession of the Plebs (287)\r\nand new political concessions to them; but still wars multiply, till all\r\nItaly is Romanised (266). The now mixed warlike aristocracy of birth,\r\nwealth, and office monopolises power in the Senate; and the residual\r\nplebs gradually ceases to be a distinct moral force, its last great\r\nstruggle being made under the Gracchi, to whom it gives no valid\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIf we consider this evolution purely as a play of domestic political\r\nforces, we recognise it from first to last as a simple conflict of class\r\nneeds and interests, partially modified at times by movements of true\r\npublic spirit on the part of such men as the patricians who supported\r\nthe Licinian laws, and such men as the Gracchi. The State-organism is\r\nthe result of the struggles and pressures of its elements. What happened\r\nin the chronic readjustments was never a democratisation of the State,\r\nbut at most an institutional protection of the poorer plebeians, and an\r\nadmission of the richer to something like equal status with the\r\noptimates. Never was the \"people\" really united by any common home\r\ninterest beyond the need of extorting some privileges. Only to that\r\nextent were the richer plebeians at one with the poorer; and there can\r\nbe little doubt that as soon as the former secured the privileges they\r\ncraved they tended to abuse them as the patricians had done. There was\r\nno _personnel_ adequate to the effective working of the Licinian laws in\r\nface of a perpetual process of conquest which infallibly evoked always\r\nthe instinct of acquisition, and never the science which might have\r\ncontrolled it. The early division of the State-territory into\r\ntwenty-five tribes (495), of whom twenty-one were rural, determined the\r\nlimitation of the political problem to the simple sharing of land; and\r\nevery effort of public-spirited men to arrest the aggregation of lands\r\nin the hands of a few meant a convulsive explosion of resistance by the\r\nwealthy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Polonian prattle of Cicero to his son we can gather how all\r\nschemes of reconstruction were viewed by the ruling class, whether in\r\nretrospect or prospect. The slaying of Tiberius Gracchus by Scipio\r\nNasica is a standing theme of praise;[43] the lesson of the course of\r\nthings social towards a steep sunderance of \"haves\" and \"have-nots\" is\r\nangrily evaded. Cicero knew as well as any the need for social\r\nreconstruction in Rome;[44] and he repeatedly records the sagacity of\r\nLucius Marcus Philippus, who had been tribune and consul in Cicero's\r\nboyhood. As consul, Philippus had resisted the attempts of M. Livius\r\nDrusus to reform the Senate and provide for the poorer citizens and the\r\nItalians; but inasmuch as he had during his tribuneship avowed the fact\r\nthat there were not left two thousand men in the State who owned\r\nproperty, Cicero denounces the avowal as pernicious.[45] The ideal\r\naristocratic course was to resist all political change and slay those\r\nwho attempted it--Drusus as the Gracchi before him. It was as a\r\nconsummation of that policy that there exploded the so-called Marsian or\r\nSocial War, in which Rome and the Italian States around her grappled and\r\ntore for years together like their ancestors of the tribal period;\r\nwhereafter Marians and Sullans in turn rent Rome, till Sulla's iron\r\ndictatorship, restoring class supremacy, marked the beginning of the end\r\nof self-governing institutions, and prepared for the day of autocracy,\r\nwhich was not to come without another agony of long-protracted civil\r\nwar. It is the supreme proof of the deadliness of the path of conquest\r\nthat for most Romans the end of Roman \"freedom\" was a relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nThe effect of continuous foreign war in frustrating democracy is here\r\nplain. On the one hand, the peasant-farmers are reduced to debt and\r\nslavery by their inability to farm their lands in war-time, while the\r\npatrician's lands are worked by his slaves. On the other hand, their\r\ndistress is met by a share in the lands conquered; and after the\r\nsoldiers are allowed pay (406 B.C.) they are more and more ready to join\r\nin conquest. Not only is popular discontent put off by the prospect of\r\nforeign plunder, but the perpetual state of aggressive war, while\r\ntending first to pauperise most of the small cultivators who make the\r\narmy, breeds a new public spirit on a low plane, a sinister fraternity\r\nof conquest. Ethics must needs worsen throughout the State when the\r\nprimitive instinct of strife developed into a policy of plunder; and\r\nworsened ethics means a positive weakening of a society's total\r\nstrength. There is no lesson that men are slower to learn--and this\r\nnaturally, because they see the success of unjust conquest--yet there\r\nis no truth easier to prove from history. Early Rome was strong as\r\nagainst strong enemies, because not only were its people hardily bred,\r\nbut the majority were on the whole satisfied that they had just laws:\r\nthe reciprocal sense of recognised _rights_ sustained public spirit at\r\nthe possible maximum. But the rights are thoroughly selfish at best; and\r\nit is the diversion of their selfishness to the task of continuous\r\nconquest that \"saves\" the community from early dissolution, preserving\r\nit for the life of dominion, which in turn destroys the old forces of\r\ncohesion, and leaves a community fit only for subjection to a military\r\nautocracy. The society of mutual selfish rights has a measure of\r\ncohesion of its own, up to the point of conflict between the \"haves\" and\r\nthe \"have-nots.\" An outwardly similar cohesion can, indeed, be sustained\r\nfor a time by mere concurrence in piracy; but it lies in the very nature\r\nof society that union so engineered, cohesion so secured, is fleeting.\r\nMen whose main discipline is the practice of tyranny over aliens become\r\nsimply incapable of strict reciprocity towards kin, and there must ensue\r\neither internecine strife or the degradation of the weaker elements, or\r\na sequence of these results.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened in Rome. One of the first political signs of the\r\ncontagion of the life of rapine in the later Republic is the growth of\r\npublic bribery as a means to further wealth. Administrative posts being\r\nthe chief of these means, candidates for them set about buying votes in\r\nthe modern manner.[46] As early as 432 B.C. the law against canvassing\r\nby candidates[47] (_lex de ambitu_) suggests the recognition of\r\nelectoral corruption; and later there followed a whole series of futile\r\nvetoes--futile because the social conditions grew always morally worse.\r\nThe _lex AEmilia Baebia_ (182 B.C.) forbade all money gifts by candidates;\r\nand twenty-three years later another law decreed that offenders should\r\nbe exiled. This also failing, there followed the _leges tabellariae_,\r\nestablishing the ballot (139-137). Still the disease persisted, because\r\nthere was no stop now possible to the career of conquest, which had\r\nundermined the very instincts whereon law depends; and on the\r\ntreacherous struggle for place and pelf by way of bribery there\r\nsupervened the direct grapple over the ill-gotten gains. The Roman\r\nruling class had evolved into a horde of filibustering fortune-hunters,\r\nas did the Greeks under and after Alexander; and the political sequels\r\nof despotism and civil war were substantially the same.\r\n\r\nThe process was gradual, and the phenomena are at times apt to delude\r\nus. When a political machinery was set up that conduced to systematic\r\nand extending warfare in which the commonwealth was often at stake, the\r\ncommunity had a new albeit fatal bond of cohesion, and the destructive\r\nor repulsive energies for generations found a wide field outside of the\r\nState. It is when the aristocratic Republic, succeeding finally in the\r\nlong struggle with Carthage for the wealth of Sicily and Spain and the\r\ncontrol of the Mediterranean, has further overrun Greece and pretty well\r\nexhausted the immediate fields of conquest, that the forces of repulsion\r\nagain begin to work destructively within the body politic itself, and\r\nmen and classes become the fools of their animosities. The wars of\r\nfaction, the popular propaganda of the Gracchi, the murderous strifes of\r\nMarius and Sulla, the rivalries of Pompey and Crassus, Conservatives and\r\nDemocrats, Caesar and Pompey, the pandemonium on Caesar's death, all in\r\nturn represent the renewed operation within the State of the crude\r\nenergies of cohesion and strife which had been so long employed in\r\nforeign war. And the strife is progressively worse, because the\r\nmaterials are more complex and more corrupt. The aristocracy are more\r\narrogant and hardened, the free farmer class has in large part\r\ndisappeared, and the populace are more debauched.[48]\r\n\r\nThe perpetual wars had multiplied slaves; and the slaves added a new and\r\ndesperate element to the social problem. It was the proof of the fatal\r\nlack in Rome of vital ethical feeling--or, let us say, of social\r\nscience--that this deadly iniquity was never effectually recoiled from,\r\nor even impugned as it had been, before Aristotle, among the more highly\r\nevolved of the Greeks.[49] As wealth and luxury, pride and power\r\naccumulated, the usage of slave labour spread ever further and ate ever\r\ndeeper into the population, brutalising alike the enslaved and the free.\r\n\r\n     It was doubtless a partial recognition of this that motived, in\r\n     Cicero's day, the large number of affranchisements of slaves\r\n     (Wallon, _Hist. de l'Esclavage_, ii, 409). But fresh enslavements\r\n     went on; the amelioration consisted in the brevity of the period of\r\n     enslavement in cases of good conduct. And the evil was in the main\r\n     a product of conquest. It is fairly established by Dureau de la\r\n     Malle (_Econ. polit. des Romains_, 1840, vol. i, liv. ii, ch. 2)\r\n     that down to the second Punic War Roman slaves were few. They would\r\n     be for the most part _nexi_, victims of debt. As conquests\r\n     multiplied prisoners, the class increased rapidly. Broadly\r\n     speaking, the house servants were all slaves, as were the bulk of\r\n     the shepherds in the great _latifundia_, the crews of the galleys,\r\n     and many of the artisans. The total number has doubtless been\r\n     greatly exaggerated, both in ancient and modern times, as has been\r\n     the population of the imperial city. Athenaeus is responsible for\r\n     many wild estimates. (Cp. Letronne, as cited by Dureau, liv. ii,\r\n     ch. 4.) Dureau arrives by careful calculation at an estimate of an\r\n     Italian population of some five millions about the year 529 A.U.C.,\r\n     of whom some two and three quarter millions were free and some two\r\n     and a quarter millions were slaves or _metaeci_, aliens without\r\n     political rights (i, 296). The population of Rome as late as\r\n     Aurelian he puts at between 500,000 and 600,000 (i, 368). (See\r\n     Prof. Bury's note in his ed. of Gibbon, iii, 308, for different\r\n     views. Gibbon, Bunsen, and Hodgkin put the figure at about a\r\n     million.) The exact proportion of slaves to free is not of the\r\n     essence of the problem. A society with nine slaves for every eleven\r\n     free was sufficiently committed to degeneration.\r\n\r\nBut the fatality of war was as irresistible as the fatality of plebeian\r\ndegradation; and the collapse of the slave war in Sicily (132), and the\r\npolitical movement of the Gracchi, alongside of the new warlike triumphs\r\nin Spain and Southern Gaul (121--the first great successes since the\r\nfall of Carthage), illustrate the general principle that a ruling class\r\nor house may always reckon on checking domestic criticism and popular\r\nself-assertion by turning the animal energies of the people to animal\r\nstrife with another nation, in which case union correlates with strife.\r\nWars imply comradeship and the putting aside of domestic strife for the\r\ntime being; and a war with Illyria was made the pretext for suspending\r\nthe operation of the new land law passed by the elder Gracchus when the\r\nyounger later sought to carry it out. The triumphs of Marius, again,\r\nover Jugurtha and the Cimbri availed nothing to unify the parties in the\r\nState, or to secure his own. In democratising the army by drawing on a\r\ndemoralised _demos_, he did but make it a more facile tool for the\r\ngeneral, a thing more detached from the body politic.[50] The tendency\r\nof all classes in Rome to unite against the claims of the outside\r\nItalians was from the first a stumbling-block to the democrats within\r\nRome; and the final identification of the popular interest, in the\r\nperiod of Marius and Sulla, with an anti-Roman policy among the Marians,\r\ngave to Sulla, strong in the prestige of recent conquest, the position\r\nof advantage, apart from his own strength. Further, as Montesquieu very\r\njustly notes, civil wars turn an entire nation into soldiers, and give\r\nit a formidable advantage over its enemies when it regains unity.[51]\r\nBut this again is only for a time; there is no enduring society where\r\nthere is no general sense of reciprocal justice among free men; and\r\nsystematic militarism and plunder are the negation of moral reciprocity.\r\n\r\nOne partial exception, it is true, must be made. In the early days of\r\nthe Republic the poor soldier stood to lose his farm by his patriotism.\r\nSoon the fighters had to be paid; and from the day of Marius onwards\r\nRoman commanders perforce provided for their veterans--so often their\r\naccomplices in the violation of their country's laws and liberties. The\r\nprovision was made on the one hand by donations from the loot, on the\r\nother by grants of land taken from others, it might be in Italy itself.\r\nSulla so rewarded his sworders; the triumvirs took the land of eighteen\r\nItalian towns to divide among their legionaries.[52] To the end the\r\nemperors had constantly to provide for their time-expired men by\r\nconfiscations. Thus did empire pay for its instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nThe animal energies themselves, in time, are affected by domestic\r\nconditions; and when Caesar comes on the scene Rome is visibly far on the\r\nway to a state of things such as had long before appeared in older\r\ncivilisations[53]--a state of things commonly but rather loosely called\r\ndegenerate, in which the animal energies are grown less robust, and the\r\nlife therefore in some respects more civilised. Such a course had been\r\nrun in Italy long before the rise of Rome, notably in Etruria, where,\r\nafter a conquest of aborigines by a small body of invaders,[54] who were\r\nin touch with early Greek culture, the civilisation remains at that\r\narchaic stage while Greek civilisation continues to progress.[55] There,\r\nwith a small aristocracy lording it over a people of serfs,[56] progress\r\nof all kinds was arrested, and even the religion of the conquerors\r\nassimilated to that of the aborigines.[57] In the Rome of Caesar we see,\r\nafter much fluctuation, with a more complex and less enfeebled structure\r\nof population, the beginnings of the same fixation of classes; while, at\r\nthe same time, there has been such psychological variation as can begin\r\nto give new and ostensibly higher channels to the immanent forces of\r\nunion and strife. This is the social condition that, given the required\r\nmilitary evolution, above all lends itself to imperialism or absolute\r\nmonarchy; which system in turn best maintains itself by a policy of\r\nconquest, so employing the animal energies and keeping up the cohesive\r\nforce of militarist pride throughout all classes. Even now, of course,\r\nin a semi-enslaved populace, as in a slave population pure and\r\nsimple,[58] there were possibilities of insurrection; and it was at\r\nlength empirically politic for the emperors to give the populace its\r\ndaily bread and its daily games, as well as to keep it charmed with the\r\nspectacle of conquest. The expedient of doles of food did not at once\r\ncondemn itself by dangerously multiplying mouths, because, although it\r\nwas only in the upper classes that men commonly refused to marry and\r\nhave legitimate children, population was now restrained by the\r\npreventive checks of vice, city life, and wholesale abortion,[59] which\r\nare so much more effective--alike against child and mother[60]--than the\r\nrandom resort to infanticide, though that too had greatly increased.[61]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as the field of practicable conquest again approaches\r\nexhaustion and no sufficiently strong rival arises to conquer the\r\nconquerors, nothing can hinder that people of all classes, having no\r\nideals tending to social and intellectual advance, and no sufficient\r\nchannel for the instinct of union in the politics of the autocracy,\r\nshall find some channels of a new kind.[62] These are opened in due\r\ncourse, and take the shape especially of religious combinations or\r\nchurches. Such modes had appeared even in the earlier stages of civic\r\ndisintegration, when the semi-private or sectarian cults had begun to\r\ncompete successfully with the public or civic. They did so by appealing\r\nmore freshly and directly to the growths of emotional feeling (the\r\noutcome in part of physiological modification)[63] which no longer found\r\noutlet in primary forms, such as warfare and primitive revelry. After\r\nhaving themselves consented in times of panic to the introduction of\r\nseveral cults in the name of the public interest, the ruling classes,\r\ninstinctively conservative by the law of their existence, take fright at\r\nthe startling popularity of the unofficial Bacchic mysteries, and decide\r\nto stamp out the movement.[64] But the attempt is futile, the causal\r\nconditions remaining; and soon Judaism, Osirianism, Mithraism, the\r\nworships of Attis, Adonis, Bacchus, Isis, Serapis, all more or less\r\nbound up with divination and sorcery, make way in the disintegrating\r\nbody politic.[65] The wheel of social evolution had, so to speak, \"gone\r\nfull circle\" since the first Roman _curia_, the basis of the State,\r\nsubsisted as groups with their special _sacra_, finding in these their\r\nreason for cohering. Decadent Rome, all other principles of subordinate\r\ncohesion having been worked out, resolves itself once more into groups\r\nsimilarly motived. But the principle is newly conditioned, and the\r\n_sacra_ now begin the struggle for existence among themselves. The rise\r\nof Christianity is simply the success of a system which, on a good\r\neconomic foundation, copied from that of the Jewish synagogues,\r\nassimilates the main attractions of similar worships, while availing\r\nitself of exoteric and democratic as well as esoteric methods. It thus\r\nnecessarily gains ground among the multitude, rich as well as poor;[66]\r\nand its ultimate acceptance by the autocrat was due to the very\r\nexclusiveness which at first made it intolerable. Once diffused widely\r\nenough to set up the largest religious organisation in the Empire, it\r\nbecame the best possible instrument of centralisation and control, and\r\nas such it was accepted and employed.[67]\r\n\r\nAnd now again we see how inevitably the force of attraction correlates\r\nwith the force of repulsion. The new channels of the spirit of union,\r\nbeing dug not by reason but by ignorance, become new channels for the\r\nreverse flow of the spirit of strife; and as sectarian zeal spreads, in\r\nthe absence of openings, good or bad, for public spirit, there arise new\r\nforms of domestic hate and struggle. Crude religious fervours,\r\nexcluding, or arising in lack of, the play of the saner and higher forms\r\nof thought and feeling, beget crude antipathies;[68] and Christianity\r\nleads back to bloody strifes and seditions such as had not been seen\r\nsince the fall of the Republic. There is not intellectuality enough to\r\nraise men above this new superinduced barbarism of ignorant instinct;\r\nhalf of the old Christendom, disintegrated like the old politics, is\r\noverrun by a more robust barbarism that adopts a simpler creed; and the\r\nnew barbaric Christendom exhibits in its turn all the modes of operation\r\nof the biological forces that had been seen in the old.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered Roman evolution in terms of a moral estimate\r\nof the reactions of classes. But lest we lose sight of the principle of\r\ntotal causation, it is fitting to restate the process in terms of that\r\nconception, thus explaining it non-morally. We may view Rome, to begin\r\nwith, as a case of the unique aggrandisement of a State in virtue of fit\r\nconditions and institutions. Thus (1) the comparatively uncommercial\r\nsituation of the early Latins, leaving them, beyond cattle-breeding and\r\nagriculture, no occupation save war for surplus energy, and no readier\r\nway of acquiring wealth;[69] (2) the physical collocation of a group of\r\nseven defensive hills, so close that they must be held by a federated\r\ngroup;[70] (3) the ethnic collocation of a set of tribe groups of nearly\r\nequal vigour and ardour, strengthening each other's sinews by constant\r\nstruggling; (4) the creation (not prescient, but purely as a provision\r\nagainst kingship) of the peculiar institution of the annual\r\nconsulate,[71] securing a perpetuity of motive to conquest and a\r\ncontinuous flow of administrative energy;[72] (5) the peculiar need,\r\nimposed by this very habit of all-round warfare, for accommodation\r\nbetween the ruling and ruled classes, and for the safeguarding of the\r\ninterests of the latter by laws and franchises; (6) the central position\r\nof Rome in Italy, enabling her to subdue it piecemeal; and finally (7)\r\nthe development by all these means of a specialist aristocracy,\r\nhabitually trained to administration[73]--all these genetic conditions\r\ncombined to build up the most remarkable military empire the world has\r\never seen. They obtrude, it is clear, half of the explanation of the\r\nfact that the Romans rose to empire where the much more early civilised\r\nGreek cities of Italy did not.\r\n\r\nOf the latter fact we still receive the old explanation that it came of\r\n\"the habit, which had ever been the curse of Hellenism, of jealous\r\nseparation and frequent war between town and town, as well as internal\r\nfeuds in the several cities themselves.\"[74] But this is clearly no\r\n_vera causa_, as these symptoms are duplicated in the history of Rome\r\nitself. The determining forces must, then, be looked for in the special\r\nconditions. The Greeks, indeed, brought with them the tradition of the\r\nseparate City-State; but just as the cities remained independent in\r\nGreece by reason of natural conditions,[75] so the Greek cities of Italy\r\nremained isolated and stationary at a certain strength, because their\r\nbasis and way of life were commercial, so that while they restricted\r\neach other's growth or dominance they were in times of peace mutually\r\nnutritive. They wanted customers, not plunder. For the Romans plunder\r\nwas the first social need after agriculture, and as they began they\r\ncontinued. When Jugurtha learned that anything could be had of the\r\nRomans for gold, he had but read an open secret.\r\n\r\nOf course, the functions that were originally determined by external\r\nconditions came in time to be initial causes--the teeth and claws, so to\r\nspeak, fixing the way of life for the body politic. The upper-class\r\nRomans became, as it were, the experts, the specialists of war and\r\nempire and administration. Until they became wholly demoralised by\r\nhabitual plunder, they showed, despite their intense primeval\r\nsuperstition of citizenship,[76] a degree of sagacity in the\r\nconciliation of their defeated rivals which was a main cause of their\r\nbeing able to hold out against Hannibal, and which contrasts markedly\r\nwith the oppressive and self-defeating policy of imperial Carthage,\r\nAthens, and Sparta. Their tradition in part was still that of conquering\r\nherdsmen, not wholly turned into mere exploiters of humanity. Pitted\r\nagainst any monarch, they were finally invincible, because a\r\nstill-growing class supplied their administrators, as the swarming\r\nprovinces supplied their soldiers, and because for all alike war meant\r\nplunder and new lands, as well as glory. Pitted against a republic like\r\nCarthage, even when its armies were led by a man of genius, they were\r\nstill insuppressible, inasmuch as Carthage was a community of traders\r\nemploying mercenaries, where Rome was a community in arms, producing\r\ngenerals as Carthage produced merchants. Mithridates failed in turn, as\r\nHannibal failed. The genius of one commander, exploiting passive\r\nmaterial, could not avail against the accumulated faculty for\r\norganisation in the still self-renewing Roman patriciate.[77]\r\n\r\nCarthage had, in fact, preceded Rome on the line of the evolution of\r\nclass egoism. Herself an expression of the pressure of the social\r\nproblem in the older Semitic world, she began as a colony, staved off\r\ndomestic strife by colonies, by empire, and by doles,[78] and was\r\nalready near the economic stage reached only centuries later by the\r\nRoman Empire. Save for Rome, her polity might have endured on the\r\nimperialist basis for centuries; but, as it was, it was socially\r\nexhausted relatively to the task and the danger, depending as it did on\r\nhired foreign troops and coerced allies. It is idle to speak, as men\r\nstill do, of Hannibal's stay in Capua as a fatal mistake.[79] Had\r\nHannibal taken Rome, the ultimate triumph of the Romans would have been\r\njust as certain. Their State was bound to outlast the other, so long as\r\nit maintained to any extent its old basis of a fecund rural population\r\nof free cultivators, supplying a zealous soldiery, headed by a\r\nspecialised class equally dependent on conquest for all advancement. For\r\nthe trading Carthaginians, war was, beyond a certain point, a mere act\r\nof self-defence; they could not have held and administered Italy had\r\nthey taken it. The supreme general could last only one lifetime; the\r\nnation of warriors still yielded a succession of captains, always\r\nlearning something more of war, and raising the standard of capacity as\r\nthe progress of machinery widens the scope of all engineers.\r\n\r\n     The author of a recent and meritorious _History of Rome_, Mr.\r\n     Shuckburgh, is satisfied to quote (p. 231) from Polybius, as\r\n     explaining the fall of Carthage, the generalisation that \"Italians\r\n     as a nation are by nature superior to Phoenicians and Libyans,\r\n     both in strength of body and courage of soul\"; and to add: \"That is\r\n     the root of the matter, from which all else is a natural growth.\"\r\n     This only leaves us asking: \"What was the natural root of the\r\n     alleged physiological superiority?\" There must have been reasons.\r\n     If they were \"racial\" or climatic, whence the later implied\r\n     degeneration of the Romans in body or soul, or both? We are driven\r\n     to the explanation lying in polity and institutions, which it\r\n     should have been Mr. Shuckburgh's special aim to give, undertaking\r\n     as he does to deal with \"the state of the countries conquered by\r\n     the Romans.\" And such explanations are actually offered by Polybius\r\n     (vi, 53).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6\r\n\r\nAnd yet the deterioration of the Roman State is visibly as sure a\r\nsequence as its progress. Nothing that men might then have proposed\r\ncould save it. In Cicero's day the Senate had become a den of thieves.\r\nThe spectacle of the wealth of Lucullus, taken in Napoleonic fashion\r\nfrom the opulent East, set governor after governor elsewhere upon a\r\ncourse of ruthless extortion which depraved Rome as infallibly as it\r\ndevastated the subject States.\r\n\r\nRoman exploitation of conquest began in the relatively moderate fashion\r\nof self-supporting victors willing to live and let live. Sicily was at\r\nfirst (210) taxed by Marcellus in a fashion of which Livy makes\r\nboast;[80] and after the suppression of the slaves' revolt in 131 B.C.,\r\nthe system was further reformed. Seventeen towns, retaining their lands,\r\npaid a fixed tax to the Republic; eight were immune, save for an annual\r\ncontribution of 800,000 _modius_ of wheat for free doles in Rome; and\r\nthe rest of the island paid a tenth of all produce, as under Hiero.[81]\r\nLater, the realms of the kings of Macedonia, Pergamos, and Bithynia, and\r\nthe lands of Cyrene and Cyprus, were made the public patrimony of the\r\nconquering State. Sardinia, Spain, North Africa, and Asia were in\r\ngeneral taxed a tenth of their produce of all kinds. As the exploitation\r\nwent on, individual governors added to all this regular taxation a vast\r\nirregular plunder on their own account; and nearly every attempt to\r\nimpeach them was foiled by their accomplices in the Senate.[82] Verres\r\nin Sicily, Fonteius in Southern Gaul, Piso in Macedonia, Appius in\r\nCilicia, Flaccus in Asia Minor, wrung infinite gold and loot\r\nimmeasurable from the victim races by every device of rapacious\r\nbrigandage, trampling on every semblance of justice, and then devised\r\nthe ironic infamy of despatching corrupted or terrorised deputations of\r\ncitizens to Rome to testify to the beneficence of their rule.[83]\r\n\r\nIt was a riot of robbery in which no public virtue could live. To\r\nmoralise on the scarcity of Catos is an ill way of spending time if it\r\nbe not recognised that Catos had latterly become as impossible as eaters\r\nof acorns in the upper grades of the ever-plundering State. Cato himself\r\nis a product of the last vestiges of the stage before universal\r\nconquest; and he begins to show in his own later years all the symptoms\r\nof the period of lawless plutocracy. To yearn for a series of such\r\nfigures is to ask that men shall be capable of holding doggedly by an\r\nethic of honest barbarism while living the lives of pirates and slavers,\r\naccording no moral sympathy to the larger world of aliens and slaves,\r\nyet cherishing a high public spirit for the small world of the patrician\r\nState. The man himself was a mere moral anomaly; and in Cato the\r\nYounger, dreaming to the last of a loyal republican life, but always\r\nready at his fellow-citizens' behest to go and beat down the rights or\r\nliberties of any other State,[84] we have the paternal bias reproduced\r\nin an incurable duality. He sought for honour among thieves, himself\r\nbeing one. Concerning the Catonic attitude towards the \"degeneration\" of\r\nRoman patrician life in the age of conquest, it has been truly said that\r\n\"the policy of shameless selfishness which was pursued by the Roman\r\nSenate during this period, and reached its climax in their abominable\r\nconduct towards the unhappy, prostrate city of Carthage--the frivolous\r\nwars, tending to nothing but aggrandisement and enrichment, waged by\r\nRome continuously after the second Punic War--destroyed the old Roman\r\ncharacter[85] far more effectually than Grecian art and philosophy could\r\never have done. Henceforth there was a fearful increase in internal\r\ncorruption, immorality, bribery, an insatiable eagerness for riches,\r\ndisregarding everything else and impudently setting aside laws, orders\r\nof the Senate, and legal proceedings, making war unauthorised,\r\ncelebrating triumphs without permission, plundering the provinces,\r\nrobbing the allies.\"[86] And the ideal of conquest inspired it all.\r\n\r\nWe have only to ask ourselves, What was the administrative class to do?\r\nin order to see the fatality of its course. The State must needs go on\r\nseeking conquest, by reason alike of the lower-class and the upper-class\r\nproblem. The administrators must administer, or rust. The moneyed men\r\nmust have fresh plunder, fresh sources of profit. The proletaries must\r\nbe either fed or set fighting, else they would clamour and revolt. And\r\nas the frontiers of resistance receded, and new war was more and more a\r\nmatter of far-reaching campaigns, the large administering class at home,\r\nmen of action devoid of progressive culture, ran to brutal vice and\r\nfrantic sedition as inevitably as returned sailors to debauch; while the\r\ndistant leader, passing years of camp life at the head of professional\r\ntroops, became more and more surely a power extraneous to the Republic.\r\nWhen a State comes to depend for its coherence on a standing army, the\r\nhead of the army inevitably becomes the head of the State. The Republic\r\npassed, as a matter of course, into the Empire, with its army of\r\nmercenaries, the senatorial class having outlived the main conditions of\r\nits health and energetic stability; the autocracy at once began to\r\ndelete the remaining brains by banishing or slaying all who openly\r\ncriticised it;[87] and the Empire, even while maintaining its power by\r\nthe spell of its great traditional organisation, ran through stage after\r\nstage of civic degeneration under good and bad emperors alike, simply\r\nbecause it had and could have no intellectual life commensurate with its\r\nphysical scope. Its function involved moral atrophy. It needs the\r\nstrenuous empiricism of a Mommsen to find ground for comfort in the\r\napparition of a Caesar in a State that must needs worsen under Caesars\r\neven more profoundly than it did before its malady gave Caesar his\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nNot that the Empire could of itself have died as an organism. There are\r\nno such deaths in politics; and the frequent use of the phrase testifies\r\nto a hallucination that must greatly hamper political science. The\r\nancient generalisation[88] to the youth, maturity, and decrepitude and\r\ndeath of States is true only in respect of their variations of relative\r\nmilitary and economic strength, which follow no general rule.\r\n\r\n     The comparison of the life of political bodies to that of\r\n     individuals was long ago rightly rejected as vicious by Volney\r\n     (_Lecons d'Histoire_, 1794, 6ieme Seance), who insisted that\r\n     political destruction occurred only through vices of polity,\r\n     inasmuch as all polities have been framed with one of the three\r\n     intentions of _increasing_, _maintaining_, or _overthrowing_. The\r\n     explanation is obscure, but the negation of the old formula is\r\n     just. The issue was taken up and pronounced upon to the same effect\r\n     in the closing chapter of C.A. Walckenaer's _Essai sur l'histoire\r\n     de l'espece humaine_, 1798. (Professor Flint, in his _History of\r\n     the Philosophy of History_, cites Walckenaer, but does not mention\r\n     Volney's _Lecons_.) Le Play, in modern times, has put the truth\r\n     clearly and strongly: \"At no epoch of its history is a people\r\n     fatally doomed either to progress or decline. It does not\r\n     necessarily pass, like an individual, from youth to old age\" (cited\r\n     by H. Higgs in _American Quarterly Journal of Economics_, July,\r\n     1890, p. 428). It is to be regretted that Dr. Draper should have\r\n     adhered to the fallacy of the necessary decay and death of nations\r\n     in his suggestive work on the _Intellectual Development of Europe_\r\n     (ed. 1875, i, 13-20; ii, 393-98). He was doubtless influenced by\r\n     the American tendency to regard Europe and Asia as groups of \"old\r\n     countries.\" The word \"decay\" may of course be used with the\r\n     implication of mere \"sickness,\" as by Lord Mahon in the opening\r\n     sentence of his _Life of Belisarius_; but even in that use it gives\r\n     a lead to fallacy.\r\n\r\nHad there been no swarming and aggressive barbarians, standing to later\r\nRome as Rome had done to Carthage--collectively exigent of moral\r\nequality as Romans had once been, and therefore conjunctly mighty as\r\nagainst the morally etiolated Italians--the Western Roman Empire would\r\nhave gone on just as the Eastern[89] so long did, just as China has so\r\nlong done--would have subsisted with little or no progress, most factors\r\nof progress being eliminated from its sphere. It ought now to be\r\nunnecessary to point out that Christianity was no such factor, but\r\nrather the reverse, as the history of Byzantium so thoroughly proves. No\r\nChristian writer of antiquity, save perhaps Augustine[90] in a moment of\r\nmoral aspiration, shows any perception of the political causation of\r\nthe decay and fall of the Empire.[91] The forces of intellectual\r\nprogress that did arise and collapse in the decline and the Dark Ages\r\nwere extra-Christian heretical forces--Sabellian, Arian, Pelagian,\r\nanti-ritualistic, anti-monastic, Iconoclastic. These once deleted,\r\nChristianity was no more a progressive force among the new peoples than\r\nit was among the old; and the later European progress demonstrably came\r\nfrom wholly different causes--new empire, forcing partial peace; Saracen\r\ncontact, bringing physics, chemistry, and mathematics; new discovery,\r\nmaking new commerce; recovery of pagan lore, making new speculation;\r\nprinting, making books abundant; gunpowder, making arms a specialty; and\r\nthe fresh competition and disruption of States, setting up fruitful\r\ndifferences, albeit also preparing new wars. To try to trace these\r\ncauses in detail would be to attempt a complete sociological sketch of\r\nEuropean history, a task far beyond the scope of the present work;\r\nthough we shall later make certain special surveys that may suffice to\r\nillustrate the general law. In the meantime, the foregoing and other\r\nbird's-eye views of some ancient developments may illustrate those of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Cp. A.

The\r\ncattle then were presumably sold to the people of the Etruscan and\r\nCampanian cities. Professor Ferrero leaves this problem in a state of\r\nmystery. The early Romans, he writes, had \"few head of cattle\" (i, 2);\r\nbut land capture, he admits, meant increase (p. 5); and at the time of\r\nthe Roman Protectorate over all Italy (266 B.C.) he recognises \"vast\r\nwandering herds of oxen and sheep, without stable or pen\" (p. 9),\r\nconducted by slave shepherds. On such lands there must have been a\r\nconsiderable amount of cattle-breeding at a much earlier period. On the\r\nother hand, noting that the Romans early imported terracottas and metals\r\nfrom Etruria, Phoenicia, and Carthage, \"besides ivory-work and\r\nornaments, perfumes for funerals, purple for the ceremonial robes of the\r\nmagistrates, and a few slaves\" (p. 3), Professor Ferrero lightly affirms\r\nthat \"it was not difficult to pay for these in exports: timber for\r\nshipbuilding, and salt, practically made up the list.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Cp.

Origen had set the note a century before\r\nConstantine (_Contra Celsum_, viii, 68-72).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGREEK POLITICAL EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe politico-economic history of Greece has been less cleared up than\r\nthat of Rome, by reason not only of the greater complexity of the\r\nproblem, but of the predominance of literary specialism in Greek\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\n     The modern Greek historian, Paparrigopoulo, has published in French\r\n     an _Histoire de la Civilisation hellenique_ (Paris, 1878), which\r\n     condenses his learned Greek work in five volumes; but the general\r\n     view, though sometimes suggestive, is both scanty and superficial\r\n     as regards ancient Greek history, and runs to an unprofitable\r\n     effort at showing the \"unity\" of all Hellenic history, Pagan and\r\n     Christian, in terms of an assumed conception of Hellenic character.\r\n\r\n     The posthumous _Griechische Culturgeschichte_ of Jakob Burckhardt\r\n     (1898) throws little light on social evolution. Trustworthy,\r\n     weighty, and lucid, like all Burckhardt's work, it is rather a\r\n     survey of Greek moral conditions than a study of social\r\n     development, thus adding something of synthesis to the previous\r\n     scholarly literature on the subject without reducing the phenomena\r\n     to any theory of causation. It includes, however, good studies of\r\n     vital social developments, such as slavery, to which Grote and\r\n     Thirlwall paid surprisingly little attention, and which Mahaffy\r\n     handles inadequately. This is also to be studied in W.R.\r\n     Patterson's _Nemesis of Nations_ (1907)--with some caution as\r\n     regards the political generalisations.\r\n\r\n     Since the first edition of the present work there has appeared, in\r\n     Dr. G.B. Grundy's _Thucydides and the History of his Age_ (1911) a\r\n     new recognition of the fundamental character of economic conditions\r\n     in Greek as in other history. Dr. Grundy, finding no academic\r\n     precedent for his sociological method, has urged as new truths\r\n     propositions which for economic historians are or should have been\r\n     axioms. The result, however, is a really stimulating and valuable\r\n     presentment of Greek history in terms of causal forces.\r\n\r\n     The chapters on Greece in Dr. Cunningham's _Western Civilisation_\r\n     (1898), though they contain not a few explanations of Greek\r\n     culture-phenomena on the old lines, in terms of themselves, are\r\n     helpful for the purposes of the present inquiry, since they really\r\n     study causation, as do Meyer's _Wirthschaftliche Entwickelung des\r\n     Alterthums_ and some other recent German treatises, of which Dr.\r\n     Cunningham makes use.\r\n\r\n     Much use, however, remains to be made of these and previous expert\r\n     studies. Boeckh's great work on the _Public Economy of the\r\n     Athenians_, which, though containing economic absurdities, hardly\r\n     deserves even in that regard the strictures passed on it by the\r\n     first English translator (Sir G.C. Lewis, 1828; 2nd ed. 1842;\r\n     superior American ed. tr. from 2nd German ed. by A. Lamb, 1857),\r\n     has not very fruitfully affected the later historians proper. The\r\n     third German edition by Fraenkel, 1886, typifies the course of\r\n     scholarship. It corrects details and adds a mass of _apparatus\r\n     criticus_ equal in bulk to the whole original work, but supplies no\r\n     new ideas. Heeren's section on Greece in his _Ideen_, etc.,\r\n     translated as a _Sketch of the Political History of Ancient Greece_\r\n     (1829), and also as part of Heeren's _Thoughts on the Politics_,\r\n     etc., of _the Ancient World_, is too full of early misconceptions\r\n     to be well worth returning to, save for its general view. On the\r\n     other hand, Grote's great _History of Greece_, though unmatched in\r\n     its own species, and though a far more philosophical performance\r\n     than that of Mitford (which Professor Mahaffy and the King of\r\n     Greece agree in preferring for its doctrine), is substantially a\r\n     narrative and critical history on the established lines, and does\r\n     not aim at being more than incidentally sociological; and that of\r\n     Bishop Thirlwall, though in parts superior in this regard, is\r\n     substantially in similar case. At several points, indeed, Grote\r\n     truly illuminates the sociological problem--notably in his view of\r\n     the reactions between the Greek drama and the Greek life. Of the\r\n     German general histories, that of Holm (Eng. tr. 4 vols. 1894-98)\r\n     is a trustworthy and judicious embodiment of the latest research,\r\n     but has no special intellectual weight, and is somewhat needlessly\r\n     prolix. The history of Dr. Evelyn Abbott, so far as it has gone,\r\n     has fully equal value in most respects; but both leave the need for\r\n     a sociological history unsatisfied. Mr. Warde Fowler's _City State\r\n     of the Greeks and Romans_ (1893) points in the right direction, but\r\n     needs following up.\r\n\r\n     Apart from Burckhardt and Cunningham, the nearest approach yet made\r\n     to a sociological study of Greek civilisation is the series of\r\n     works on Greek social history by Professor Mahaffy (_Social Life in\r\n     Greece_; _Greek Life and Thought from the Age of Alexander to the\r\n     Roman Conquest_; _The Greek World under Roman Sway_; _Problems of\r\n     Greek History_; and _Survey of Greek Civilisation_). These learned\r\n     and brilliant volumes have great value as giving more vivid ideas\r\n     of Greek life than are conveyed by any of the regular histories,\r\n     and as constantly stimulating reflection; but they lack method,\r\n     omit much, and abound regrettably in capricious and inconsistent\r\n     dicta. The _Survey_ is disappointing as emphasising rather than\r\n     making good the defects of the previous treatises. G.F.\r\n     Hertzberg's _Geschichte Griechenlands unter der Herrschaft der\r\n     Roemer_ (1866), and indeed all his works on Greek history, are\r\n     always worth consulting.\r\n\r\n     Some help may be had from the volume on Greece in the _Industrial\r\n     History of the Free Nations_ by W.T. M'Cullagh (1846); but that\r\n     fails to throw any light on what should have been its primary\r\n     problem, the rise of Greek industry, and is rather sentimental than\r\n     scientific in spirit. For later Greece, Finlay (_History of Greece\r\n     from its Conquest by the Romans_, revised ed. 7 vols. 1877) becomes\r\n     illuminating by his interest in economic law, though he holds\r\n     uncritically enough by some now exploded principles, and exhibits\r\n     some religious prejudice. His somewhat entangled opening sections\r\n     express his difficulties as a pioneer in sociological\r\n     history--difficulties only too abundantly apparent in the following\r\n     pages. Professor J.B. Bury's _History of the Later Roman Empire_ (2\r\n     vols. 1889) is an admirable work; but it does not attempt, save\r\n     incidentally, to supersede Finlay in matters economic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nThe political history of ancient Greece, similarly summarised, will\r\nserve perhaps even better the purpose of illuminating later evolution.\r\nThat history has served historian after historian as a means of modern\r\npolemic. The first considerable English historians of Greece, Gillies\r\nand Mitford, pointed to the evil fate of Greek democracy as a conclusive\r\nargument against countenancing democracy now; never stopping to ask\r\nwhether ancient monarchies had fared any better than the democracies.\r\nAnd it is perfectly true that present-day democracies will tend to bad\r\nfortune just as did the ancient unless they bottom themselves more\r\nfirmly and guide themselves by a deeper political science. It will not\r\nsuffice that we have rejected the foundation of slavery, on which all\r\nthe Greek polities rested. The strifes between the demos and the\r\naristocracy in the Greek City-States would have arisen just as surely,\r\nthough more slowly, if the demos, instead of being an upper-grade\r\npopulace owning slaves, had included the whole mass of the artisan and\r\nserving class.[92] Where population increases at anything like the\r\nnatural animal rate, and infanticide is not overwhelming, poverty must\r\neither force emigration or breed strife between the \"have-nots\" and the\r\n\"haves,\" barring such continuous stress of war as suffices at once to\r\nthin numbers and yield conquerors the lands of the slain losers. During\r\nsome centuries the pressure was in part relieved by colonisation, as had\r\nalready happened among the Phoenicians;[93] the colonies themselves in\r\nturn, with their more rapid evolution, developing the inevitable strife\r\nof rich and poor more quickly and more violently than the mother\r\ncities.[94] Among these, it was when that relief seemed to be exhausted\r\nthat strife became most dangerous, being obscurely perceived to be a\r\nmeans to advancement and prosperity for individuals, as well as for the\r\nState which could extort tribute or plunder from the others. War,\r\nhowever, limits agriculture, so that food supply is kept proportionately\r\nsmall; and with peace the principle of population soon overtakes lost\r\nground; so that, though the Greek States like others tended to gain in\r\nsolidarity under the stimulus of foreign war, the pressure of poverty\r\nwas always breeding fresh division.\r\n\r\nIf we take up Grecian history after the settling down of the prehistoric\r\ninvasions, which complicated the ordinary process of rupture and\r\nfission, that process is seen occurring so frequently, and in so many\r\ndifferent States, that there can be no question as to the presence of a\r\ngeneral sociological law, not to be counteracted in any community save\r\nby a radical change of conditions. Everywhere the phenomena are broadly\r\nthe same. The upper class (\"upper\" in virtue either of primary\r\nadvantages or of special faculty for acquiring wealth) attains to\r\nproviding for its future by holding multitudes of poorer citizens in\r\ndebt--the ancient adumbration of the modern developments of landlordism,\r\nnational debts, and large joint-stock enterprises, which yield\r\ninheritable incomes. In early times, probably, debt led as often to\r\nadult enslavement in Greece as in Rome;[95] but in a world of small and\r\nwarring City-States, shaken by domestic division, constantly making\r\nslaves by capture and purchase, and always exposed to the risk of their\r\ninsurrection, this was too dangerous a course to be long persisted\r\nin,[96] and the creditor was led to press his mortgaged debtor in other\r\nways. The son or the daughter was sold to pay the father's dues, or to\r\nserve in perpetual payment of interest; and the cultivator's share was\r\never at the lowest point. The pressure increases till the mass of\r\ndebtors are harassed into insurrection, or are used by an adventurer to\r\nestablish himself as despot.[97] Sometimes, in later days, the documents\r\nof debt are publicly destroyed;[98] sometimes the land is divided\r\nafresh.[99] Landholders burdened with debt would vote for the former\r\ncourse and resist the latter;[100] and as that was clamoured for at\r\nAthens in early times, it may be presumed that in some places it was\r\nresorted to. Sometimes even a refunding of interest would be insisted\r\non.[101] Naturally such means of rectification availed only for a\r\nmoment; the despot stood a fair chance of being assassinated; the\r\ntriumphant demos would be caballed against; the exiled nobles, with the\r\ncold rage of Theognis in their hearts, would return; and the last state\r\nof the people would be worse than the first; till again slackened\r\nvigilance on one side, and intolerable hardship on the other, renewed\r\nthe cycle of violent change.\r\n\r\nIn the course of ages there was perforce some approach to\r\nequipoise;[102] but it was presumably at the normal cost of a definite\r\nabasement of the populace;[103] and it was by a famous stroke of\r\nstatecraft that Athens was able so to solve her first great crisis as to\r\nmake possible some centuries of expanding democratic life. The name of\r\nSolon is associated with an early crisis (594 B.C.) in which debt and\r\ndestitution among the Athenian demos (then still for the most part small\r\ncultivators, for whom the city was a refuge fortress, but as a rule no\r\nlonger owning the land they tilled) brought matters to the same point as\r\nwas marked in Rome by the Secession of the Plebs. The Athenian oligarchy\r\nwas very much like the Roman; and when the two sides agreed to call in\r\nSolon as arbitrator it was with a fairly general expectation that he\r\nwould take the opportunity to become tyrant. The people knew him to be\r\nopposed to plutocratic tyranny; the nobles and traders, anxious for\r\nsecurity, thought him sure to be their friend; and both sorts had small\r\nobjection to such a one as \"despot.\" But Solon, a noble of moderate\r\nmeans, who had gained prestige in the wars of Athens with her\r\nneighbour, Megara, and some knowledge of life as a travelling trader,\r\nbrought to his problem a higher vision than that of a Roman patrician,\r\nand doubtless had a less barbarous stock to deal with. Later ages,\r\nloosely manipulating tradition, ascribed to him a variety of laws that\r\nhe cannot have made;[104] but all the records concur in crediting him\r\nwith a \"Seisachtheia,\" a \"shaking-off-of-burdens,\" and a healing of the\r\nworst of the open wounds of the body politic. All existing mortgages\r\nwere cancelled; all enslavement for debt was abolished; Athenians who\r\nhad been sold into alien slavery were bought back (probably by a\r\ncontribution from relieved debtors[105]); and the coinage was\r\nrecast--whether or not by way of reducing State payments is not clear.\r\n\r\n     Grote (ii, 471), while eulogising Solon's plan as a whole, accepts\r\n     the view that he debased the money-standard; while Boeckh\r\n     (_Metrologie_, ch. 15) holds him to have further altered the\r\n     weights and measures. For the former view there is clear support in\r\n     Plutarch (_Solon_, c. 15), and for the latter in the lately\r\n     recovered Aristotelian _Polity of Athens_ (c. 10). But when Messrs.\r\n     Mitchell and Caspari, in their abridgment of Grote (p. 45), declare\r\n     that the latter document makes clear that the coinage measure was\r\n     solely for the promotion of trade, and entirely independent of the\r\n     Seisachtheia (so also Bury, p. 183), they unduly stress the\r\n     evidence. The document, which is hardly Aristotelian in structure,\r\n     proceeds doubtfully on tradition and not upon record; and there may\r\n     be some truth in the old view of Androtion (Plut. c. 15), that\r\n     Solon only reduced the rate of interest while altering the\r\n     money-standard. The point is really obscure. Cp. Abbott, _Hist. of\r\n     Greece_, i, 407-8; Grote, ii, 472-76; Meyer, ii, 651-52; Cox, _Gen.\r\n     Hist. of Greece_, 2nd ed. pp. 76-79. So far are we from exact\r\n     knowledge that it is still a moot point whether the tenant\r\n     _Hektemorioi_ or \"Sixth-men\" _paid_ or _received_ a sixth part of\r\n     their total product. Cp. Mitchell and Caspari, abr. of Grote, p.\r\n     14, _note_; Cox, _Gen. Hist. of Greece_, 2nd ed. p. 77; Bury,\r\n     _Hist. of Greece_, ed. 1906, p. 181; Meyer, ii, 642; Abbott, _Hist.\r\n     of Greece_, i, 289.\r\n\r\nWhile the burdened peasants and labourers were thus ostensibly given a\r\nnew economic outlook on life, they were further humanised by being given\r\na share in the common polity. To the Ecclesia or \"Congregation\" of the\r\npeople Solon gave the power of electing the public magistrates; and by\r\nway of controlling somewhat the power of the Areopagus or Senate, he\r\nestablished a \"pre-considering\" Council or \"Lower House\" of Four\r\nHundred, chosen from all save the poor class, thus giving the State\r\n\"two anchors.\" And though the executive was in the hands of the\r\naristocracy, subject only to popular election, the burdens of the\r\ncommunity were soundly adjusted by a new or improved classification of\r\ncitizens according to their incomes (\"timocracy\"), which worked out\r\nsomewhat as a graduated income-tax, whether by way of a money-rate or in\r\nrespect of their share in military duties and public \"liturgies,\" which\r\nhad to be maintained by the richer citizens.\r\n\r\n     As to this vexed question, see Boeckh, _Staatsaushaltung der\r\n     Athener_, B. iv, c. 5 (Grote's ref. wrong), as expounded and\r\n     checked by Grote (ii, 485-88). Messrs. Mitchell and Caspari, in\r\n     their abridgment of Grote (pp. 22, 49, _notes_), reject the whole\r\n     interpretation (which is reached by a combination of ancient data,\r\n     Plutarch [c. 18] telling nothing as to taxation). But they adduce\r\n     only the negative argument that \"as we know that Peisistratos, the\r\n     champion of the poorer classes, subsequently levied a uniform tax\r\n     of five or ten per cent., it is absurd to suppose that the highly\r\n     democratic principle of a sliding-scale had been previously adopted\r\n     by Solon. Peisistratos would not have dared to attempt a reaction\r\n     from a sliding-scale income-tax to a sort of poll-tax.\" To this it\r\n     might be replied that the \"flat rate\" of Peisistratos--which ought\r\n     to modify the conception of him as the \"friend of the poor\"--may\r\n     have been an addition to previous taxes; and that the division of\r\n     citizens into income-classes must have stood for _something_ in the\r\n     way of burdens. The solution would seem to be that these were not\r\n     regular money taxes. \"Regular direct taxes were as little known in\r\n     free Athens as in any other ancient State; they are the marks of\r\n     absolute monarchy, of unfreedom\" (Meyer, ii, 644). \"Seemingly, it\r\n     was not until later times that this distribution of classes served\r\n     the purposes of taxation\" (Maisch, _Manual of Greek Antiquities_,\r\n     Eng. tr. p. 40). But already the cost of certain public services,\r\n     classed under the head of \"liturgies,\" was laid upon the rich; and\r\n     there may well have been a process of collective contribution\r\n     towards these at a time when very rich citizens cannot have been\r\n     numerous.\r\n\r\n     Doubtless the graduated income-tax would have been unworkable in a\r\n     systematic way, though in the \"Servian\" timocracy of early Rome a\r\n     _tributum_ seems to have been imposed on the classes (Livy, ii, 9).\r\n\r\nAt yet other points Solon prepared the ground for the democratic\r\nstructure of the later Athenian polity. By overthrowing the sacrosanct\r\npower of the aristocratic priestly houses, who had aggrandised\r\nthemselves by it like the nobles of early Rome, he prevented the growth\r\nof a hierocracy. By constituting out of all the citizens, including the\r\nThetes or peasant cultivators, a kind of universal jury-court, out of\r\nwhich the panels of judges were to be taken by lot, he put the people on\r\nthe way of becoming a court of appeal against the upper-class archons,\r\nwho recruited the Areopagus. \"The constitution of the judicial courts\r\n(_Heliaia_) out of the whole people was the secret of democracy which\r\nSolon discovered. It is his title to fame in the history of the growth\r\nof popular government in Europe.\"[106]\r\n\r\nThe whole reform was indeed a great achievement; and so far definitive\r\nthat from that time forward Athens needed no further resort to\r\n\"Seisachtheia\" or to alteration of the money-standard. Solon had in fact\r\neliminated the worst disruptive force at work in the community--the\r\nenslavement of the debtor; a reform so radical,[107] when considered as\r\none man's work, that to note its moral limits may seem to imply\r\nblindness to its value. Henceforth, on the lines of the democracy which\r\nhe made possible, Athenians were so far homogeneous that their slaves\r\nwere aliens. Beyond that point they could not rise; after Solon, as\r\nbefore, they were at daggers drawn with neighbouring Statelets, and to\r\nthe end it remained tolerable to them to enslave the men of other\r\nGreek-speaking communities. Floated over the first reef by Solon, they\r\nnever found a pilot to clear the second--the principle of group-enmity.\r\nUpon that the Hellenic civilisation finally foundered.\r\n\r\nEven in respect of what he achieved, Solon received but a chequered\r\nrecognition in his own time. The peasantry had expected him to divide\r\nthe land among them;[108] and when they found that the abolition of\r\nenslavement for debt did not mean much less stress of life, they were\r\nready to forfeit all the political rights he had given them for some\r\nmore tangible betterment.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact that a generation later Peisistratos was able to become\r\ntyrant in the teeth of the aged Solon's vehement opposition is\r\nintelligible only as standing for the feeling of many of the common\r\npeople that through a _tyrannos_ alone could their interests be\r\nmaintained against the perpetual conspiracy of the upper class to\r\noverreach them.[109] It may be that Solon had alienated the rural folk\r\nby his concern for commerce, which would be likely to mean the\r\nencouragement of imports of food.[110] Peisistratos, we know, was the\r\nleader of the _Diakrioi_, the herdsmen and crofters of the uplands, and\r\nwas \"accounted the most thorough democrat\" as against the landlords of\r\nthe plains (_Pediaioi_), led by Lycurgos, and the traders of the coast\r\n(_Paraloi_), led by Megacles.[111] The presumption is that by this time\r\nthe fertile plain-lands were largely owned by rich men, who worked them\r\nby hired labour; but the nature of the conflicting forces is not now to\r\nbe clearly ascertained. The credit given afterwards to Peisistratos for\r\nmaintaining the Solonian laws points to an understanding between him and\r\nthe people;[112] and their acceptance of him in Solon's despite suggests\r\nthat they even identified the latter with the failure of his laws to\r\nsecure them against further aristocratic oppression.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Solon's recasting of the political structure of the State\r\ndetermined the future evolution. As Athens grew more and more of an\r\nindustrial and trading city, her people reverted more and more surely to\r\nthe self-governing ideal; albeit the Solonian constitution preserved the\r\nunity of the State, keeping all the people of Attica \"Athenians.\" The\r\nrule of Peisistratos was twice upset, and that of his house in all did\r\nnot last much above fifty years. When the last member was driven out by\r\nKleisthenes (510 B.C.), the constitution was re-established in a more\r\ndemocratic form than the Solonian; all freemen of Attica became burghers\r\nof Athens; and thousands of unenfranchised citizens and emancipated\r\nslaves obtained full rights of citizenship. For better and for worse,\r\nrepublican Athens was made--a new thing in the ancient world, for\r\nhitherto \"democratical government was a thing unknown in Greece--all\r\nGrecian governments were either oligarchical or despotic, the mass of\r\nthe freemen having not yet tasted of constitutional privilege.\"[113]\r\n\r\nWhat followed was an evolution of the old conflicting forces on a new\r\nconstitutional basis, the balance of power and prestige being on the\r\nside of the demos and its institutions, no longer on that of a\r\nland-owning and dominant aristocracy. But the strife never ceased.\r\nKleisthenes himself found \"the Athenian people excluded from everything\"\r\nonce more, and, \"being vanquished in the party contest with his rival,\r\ntook the people into partnership.\"[114] The economic tendencies of all\r\ncivic life reproduced the hostility again and again. One of the most\r\nremarkable of the laws of Solon was that which disfranchised any citizen\r\nwho in a \"stasis\" or seditious feud stood aloof and took no side.[115]\r\nHe had seen the risks of such apathy in the attempt of Kylon, in his\r\nyouth, to become despot of Athens; and his fears were realised when\r\nPeisistratos seized power. The law may have helped to promote\r\npublic-spirited action; but in the nature of things it was hardly\r\nnecessary when once democracy was established. Again and again the demos\r\nhad to fight for its own hand against the cliques who sought to restore\r\noligarchy; and apathy was not likely to be common. The perpetual\r\ngeneration of fresh poverty through rapid increase of population, and\r\nthe inevitable resort to innovating fiscal and other measures to relieve\r\nit, sufficed to provide grounds of class strife while free Athens\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nIt lies on the face of Aristotle's _Politics_, however, that even if the\r\npopulation difficulty had been solved otherwise than by exodus, and even\r\nif the Athenians could have guarded against class strife among\r\nthemselves, the fatality of war in the then civilised world would have\r\nsufficed to bring about political dissolution. As he profoundly\r\nobserves, the training of a people to war ends in their ruin, even when\r\nthey acquire supremacy, because their legislators have not \"taught them\r\nhow to rest.\"[116] Add the memorable testimony of Thucydides concerning\r\nthe deep demoralisation wrought by the Peloponnesian War--a testimony\r\nsupported by every page of the history of the time. Even the sinister\r\nvirtue of uniting a people within itself was lacking to the perpetual\r\nwarfare of the Greeks: the internal hatreds seemed positively to worsen\r\nin the atmosphere of the hatreds of the communities. But while the\r\nspirit of strife is universal, peoples are inevitably trained to war;\r\nand even if the Greek States could have so far risen above their\r\nfratricidal jealousies as to form a stable union, it must needs have\r\nturned to external conquest, and so run the downward course of the\r\npost-Alexandrian Hellenistic Empires, and of the Roman Empire, which in\r\nturn sank to dissolution before the assaults of newer militarisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nNothing can save any democratic polity from the alternatives of insane\r\nstrife and imperial subjection but a vital prosperous culture, going\r\nhand in hand with a sound economy of industry. The Greek democracies in\r\ntheir different way split on the rock that wrecked the Roman Republic:\r\nthere was (1) no general mental development commensurate with the\r\npolitical problems which arose for solution, and (2) there was no\r\napproach to a sound economics. The first proposition will doubtless be\r\ndenied by those who, nourished on the literature of Greece, have come to\r\nsee in its relative excellence, the more confidently because of the\r\nabiding difficulty of mastering it, the highest reach of the faculties\r\nof thought and expression. But this judgment is fundamentally astray,\r\nbecause of the still subsisting separation, in the literary mind, of the\r\nidea of literary merit from the idea of scientific sanity. Men\r\nthemselves too often vowed to the defence and service of a mythology are\r\nslow to see that it was not for nothing that the Athenian people\r\nbottomed its culture to the last on myth and superstition. Yet a little\r\nreflection might make it clear that the community which forced Socrates\r\nto drink the hemlock for an alleged and unproved scepticism, and\r\nAnaxagoras to fly for a materialistic hypothesis concerning the sun,\r\ncould have no political enlightenment adequate to the Athenian needs. We\r\nsee the superstitious Athenian demos playing the part of the ignorant\r\nmultitude of all ages, eager for a master, incapable of steadfast\r\nself-rule, begging that the magnificent Alcibiades, who led the sacred\r\nprocession to Eleusis in despite of the Spartans near at hand, shall put\r\ndown his opponents and reign at Athens as king[117]--this after he had\r\nbeen exiled by the same demos on a charge of profane parody of the\r\nEleusinian mysteries, and sacerdotally declared accursed for the\r\noffence.[118] A primitive people may stumble along in primitive\r\nconditions by dint of elementary political methods; but a civilised\r\npeople with a complex political problem can solve it only by means of a\r\ncorrespondingly evolved science. And the Athenian people, with their\r\npurely literary and aesthetic culture, never as a body reached even a\r\nmoderate height of ethical and scientific thought,[119] or even any such\r\ngeneral aesthetic well-being as we are apt to credit them with. Moderns\r\nthink of them, as the great song of Euripides has it, \"lightly lifting\r\ntheir feet in the lucid air,\"[120] and are indulgently ready to take by\r\nthe letter the fine panegyric of the Athenian polity by Pericles,[121]\r\nforgetting that statesmen in all ages have glorified their State, always\r\nmaking out the best case, always shunning discouragement for their\r\nhearers, and making little account of evil. But Burckhardt, after his\r\nlong survey, decides with Boeckh that \"the Hellenes were more unhappy\r\nthan most men think;\"[122] and the saying holds good of their political\r\nand intellectual life above all things.\r\n\r\nOur more idealising scholars forget that the philosophy of the\r\nphilosophers was a specialism, and that the chance of hearing a tragedy\r\nof Sophocles or a comedy of Aristophanes was no training in political\r\nconduct for a people whose greatest philosopher never learned to see the\r\nfatality of slavery. On the economic side, Periclean Athens was nearly\r\nas ill founded as aristocratic Rome. Citizens often with neither\r\nprofessions nor studies, with no ballasting occupation for head or hand;\r\naverage men paid from the unearned tribute of allied States to attend to\r\naffairs without any fundamental study of political conditions; citizens\r\nwhose work was paid for in the same fashion; citizens of merely\r\nempirical education, for whom politics was but an endless web of\r\ninternational intrigue, and who had no higher ideal than that of the\r\nsupremacy of their own State in Hellenedom or their own faction in the\r\nState--such men, it is now easy to see, were incapable of saving Athens,\r\nmuch less of unifying Greece. They were politically raised to a\r\nsituation which only wise and deeply instructed men could fill, and they\r\nwere neither wise nor deeply instructed, however superior their\r\nexperience might make them relatively to still worse trained\r\ncontemporaries, or to populations living under a systematic despotism.\r\n\r\nOn some of the main problems of life the majority had thought no further\r\nthan their ancestors of the days of the kings. The spell of religion had\r\nkept them ignorant and superstitious.[123] In applied ethics they had as\r\na body made no progress: the extension of sympathy, which is moral\r\nadvance, had gone no further than the extortion of civic status and\r\npower by some new classes, leaving a majority still enslaved. Above all,\r\nthey could not learn the lesson of collective reciprocity; could not see\r\nthe expediency of respecting in other communities the liberty they\r\nprized as their own chief good. Athens in her turn \"became an imperial\r\nor despot city, governing an aggregate of dependent subjects all without\r\ntheir own active concurrence, and in many cases doubtless contrary to\r\ntheir own sense of political right.... But the Athenians committed the\r\ncapital fault of taking the whole alliance into their own hands, and\r\ntreating the allies purely as subjects, without seeking to attach them\r\nby any form of political incorporation or collective meeting and\r\ndiscussion--without taking any pains to maintain community of feeling or\r\nidea of a joint interest--without admitting any control, real or even\r\npretended, over themselves as managers. Had they attempted to do this,\r\nit might have proved difficult to accomplish--so powerful was the force\r\nof geographical dissemination, the tendency to isolated civic life, and\r\nthe repugnance to any permanent extramural obligations, in every Grecian\r\ncommunity. But they do not appear to have ever made the attempt. Finding\r\nAthens exalted by circumstances to empire, and the allies degraded into\r\nsubjects, the Athenian statesmen grasped at the exaltation as a matter\r\nof pride as well as profit. Even Pericles, the most prudent and\r\nfar-sighted of them, betrayed no consciousness that an empire without\r\nthe cement of some all-pervading interest or attachment, although not\r\npractically oppressive, must nevertheless have a natural tendency to\r\nbecome more and more unpopular, and ultimately to crumble in\r\npieces.\"[124]\r\n\r\nIn fine, a democracy, the breath of whose nostrils is justice,\r\nsystematically refused to do as it would be done by; and as was Athens,\r\nso were the rest of the Greek States. When the Athenians told the\r\nprotesting Melians, in effect, that might is right,[125] they did even\r\nas Sparta and Thebes had done before them.[126] Hence the instinct of\r\njustice was feeble for all purposes, and the domestic strife of factions\r\nwas nearly as malignant and animalised as in Borgian Italy. Mother\r\ncities and their colonies fought more destructively with each other than\r\nwith aliens; Athens and Syracuse, Corinth and Corcyra, strove more\r\nmalignantly than did Greek with barbarian. It was their rule after a\r\nvictory to slay their prisoners.[127] Such men had not learned the\r\nsecret of stable civic evolution; animal instinct was still enthroned\r\nagainst law and prudence. Unearned income, private and public; blindly\r\ntyrannous political aggression; ferocious domestic calumny; civic and\r\nracial disruption--these were the due phases and fruits of the handling\r\nof a great political problem by men who in the mass had no ideals of\r\nincreasing knowledge, of growing tolerance, of widening justice, of\r\nfraternity.[128] Stoic and Epicurean wisdom and righteousness came too\r\nlate to save free Hellas: they were the fruits of retrospect in\r\ndecadence. The very art and literature which glorified Athens were in\r\nlarge part the economic products of impolicy and injustice, being\r\nfostered by the ill-gotten wealth accruing to the city from her\r\ntributary allies and subject States, somewhat as the art of the great\r\nperiod in Italy was fed by the wealth of the Church and of the merchant\r\nprinces who grew by the great river of trade. In the one case as in the\r\nother, there was no polity, no science, equal to the maintenance of the\r\nresult when the originating conditions disappeared. Greek art and\r\nletters passed away because they were ill rooted. Nobly incorrupt for\r\nhimself, Pericles thus fatally fostered a civic corruption that no\r\nleader's virtues could countervail, and his policy in this regard was\r\nprobably the great force of frustration to his scheme for a pan-Hellenic\r\ncongress at Athens, to promote free trade and intercourse.[129]\r\n\r\n     For various views on this matter cp. Heeren, Eng. tr. of Researches\r\n     on the _Political History of Ancient Greece_, pp. 129-34;\r\n     Thirlwall, _History of Greece_, ch. xviii (1st ed. iii, 62-70);\r\n     Grote, iv, 490-504; Abbott, _History of Greece_, i, 405-9; Holm,\r\n     _History of Greece_, Eng. tr. ii, 268, note 8 to ch. xvii (a\r\n     vindication). Grote, who vindicates the policy of Pericles with\r\n     much care, endorses the statesman's own plea that his use of the\r\n     confederate treasure in ennobling the city gave her a valuable\r\n     prestige. But even to the Athenian opposition this answer was\r\n     indecisive, for, as Grote records, the argument of Thucydides was\r\n     that Athens was \"disgraced in the eyes of the Greeks\" by her use of\r\n     the treasure. This meant that her prestige was fully balanced by\r\n     hatred, so that the civic gain was a new danger.\r\n\r\nNot that matters would have gone a whit better if, as our Tory\r\nhistorians used retrospectively to prescribe, democracy had been\r\npermanently subverted by aristocracy. No other ideal then in vogue would\r\nhave produced even so much \"good life\" as was actually attained. We know\r\nthat the rich and the great in the Greek cities were the worst citizens,\r\nin the sense of being the least law-abiding; and that the lower-class\r\nAthenians who served in the fleet were the best disciplined; the\r\nmiddle-class hoplites less so; and the rich men who formed the cavalry\r\nthe least orderly of all.[130] Above all, the aristocrats were cruel and\r\nrapacious when in power as the demos never were, even when they had\r\noverthrown the guiltiest of their tyrants.[131] The leading aristocrats\r\nwere simply weaker versions of the demagogues, making up for their\r\nweakness by their cruelty; and nothing can be more misleading than to\r\ntake the account given of Kleon by Aristophanes for even a semblance of\r\nthe truth. The great humorist saw nothing as it really was: his very\r\ngenius was as it were a many-faceted mirror that could reflect no whole,\r\nand left his practical judgment worth less than that of any of the men\r\nhe ridiculed. Kleon is to be conceived as a powerful figure of the type\r\nof a New York Tammany \"Boss,\" without culture or philosophy, but shrewd,\r\nexecutive, and abounding in energy. The aristocrats were but slighter\r\negoists with a varnish of education, as far as he from a worthy\r\nphilosophy. And the philosophers _par excellence_, Plato and Aristotle,\r\nwere equally incapable of practical statesmanship. The central truth of\r\nthe entire process is that free Greece fell because her children never\r\ntranscended, in conception or in practice, that primary ethic of egoism\r\nin which even love for one's country is only a reflex of hate for\r\nanother people. This is clear in the whole play of the astounding\r\nhatreds of Athenians for Athenians through every struggle of Athens for\r\nher life. The treasons of Alcibiades are evoked and amply balanced by\r\nthe murderous plots of his fellows against him: every figure in the line\r\nof leaders, from Solon's self, is hated by some hetairia; the honest\r\nAnytus, the perfect type of brainless conservatism sitting in the chair\r\nof sociological judgment, can be appeased only by the slaying of\r\nSocrates; and to the end the egoisms of Demosthenes, AEschines, and\r\nIsocrates are at grapple, with the national assassin in sight.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the prevailing consciencelessness, the universal lust to\r\ntyrannise, that really consummates the political dissolution. It was not\r\nthe battle of Chaeronea that made an end of Greek independence. That\r\ndisaster would have been retrieved like others if only the Greeks had\r\npersistently cared to retrieve it. They fell because they took the bribe\r\nof empire. Philip held it out at once by his offer of facile terms to\r\nAthens: he was planning in his own way what the pragmatic Isocrates took\r\nfor the ideal Hellenic course, a Hellenic war of conquest against\r\nPersia; and it was that very war, made by Alexander, that transformed\r\nthe Greeks into a mere diluvium of fortune-hunters, turning away from\r\nevery ideal of civic stability and dignity to the overrunning of alien\r\npopulations and the getting of alien gold. Given the process of historic\r\ndetermination, moral bias becomes a fatality; and when it is fixed,\r\n\"'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.\" Republican Greece passed\r\naway because there were no more republican Greeks, but only a rabble of\r\nimperialists. Here again appears the fatality of their past: it was the\r\nsombre memory of unappeasable civil strife, of eternal inequality and\r\nenvy and class attrition, that made the new promise so dazzling; any\r\nfuture seemed fairer than the recent past. But it was through the\r\nimmediate bait to their cupidity that the Greeks were led out of their\r\nold man-making life of turbulent counterpoise, the sphere of free\r\nequals, into the new unmanning life of empire, the sphere of slaves.\r\nThey were easy victims. The men of Aristotle's day had once more before\r\ntheir eyes, in the squalid drama of Philip's house--in the spectacle of\r\nalienated wife and son deriding and hating the laurelled conqueror and\r\nexulting in his murder--the old lesson of autocracy, its infallible\r\ndishonour, its depravation, its dissolution of the inmost ties of\r\ncordial life. But any countervailing ideal that still lived among them\r\nwas overborne by the tide of triumphant conquest; and, with Aristotle\r\nand Plato in her hand, Greece turned back to the social ethic of the\r\nHeraclidae.\r\n\r\nAnd when once the Circean cup of empire had been drained by the race,\r\nthere was no more returning to the status of republican manhood. The new\r\nself-governing combination of cities which arose in Achaia after the\r\ndisintegration of Alexander's empire might indeed conceivably have\r\nreached a high civilisation in time; but the external conditions, as\r\nsummed up in the existence of Rome, were now overwhelmingly\r\nunfavourable. The opportunity for successful federalism was past. As it\r\nwas, the Achaian and AEtolian Leagues were but politic unions as much for\r\naggression as for defence, even as the Spartan reformers, Agis and\r\nCleomenes, could never rise above the ideal of Spartan self-assertion\r\nand domination. Thus we have on one hand the Spartan kings, concerned\r\nfor the well-being of the mass of the people (always excepting the\r\nhelots) as a means to restore Spartan pre-eminence; and on the other\r\nhand the Achaian federation of oligarchies, hating the doctrine of\r\nsympathy for the demos as much as they hated Sparta--the forces of union\r\nand strife always repelling the regimen of peace, to say nothing of\r\nfraternity. The spectacle of Cleomenes and Philopoemen at deadly odds\r\nis the dramatic summary of the situation; the ablest men of the later\r\nGreek age could not transcend their barbarian heredity.\r\n\r\n     The statement of Freeman (_History of Federal Government in Greece\r\n     and Italy_, ed. 1893, p. 184) that a federal system in Greece was\r\n     \"utterly impossible,\" is true in the bare philosophic sense that\r\n     that was impossible which did not happen; but such a proposition\r\n     would hold equally true of anything else that did not happen at a\r\n     given time; and it merely creates confusion to affirm it of one\r\n     item in particular. Pericles schemed something like a federal\r\n     union;[132] and had his practice been in accord with his ideal, it\r\n     might conceivably have been at least tried. M. Fustel de Coulanges\r\n     well points out how the primary religious conception of the ancient\r\n     City-State expelled and negatived that of a composite State (_La\r\n     Cite antique_, l. iii, ch. xiv, p. 239); that is a process of\r\n     rational explanation. But unless we conceive the \"failures\" of the\r\n     past as lessons to be profited by, there can be neither a social\r\n     nor a moral science. Freeman, however, actually proceeds to say\r\n     that Greek federation was utterly undesirable--an extraordinary\r\n     doctrine in a treatise devoted to studying and advocating\r\n     federalism. On the principles thus laid down, Dr. Freeman's\r\n     denunciation of Austria and France in modern times is irrational,\r\n     since that which has happened in these countries is that which\r\n     alone was possible; and the problem as to the desirable is\r\n     hopelessly obscured.\r\n\r\n     To say that \"Greece united in a federal bond could never have\r\n     become the Greece\" we admire (_id._ p. 184), is only to vary the\r\n     verbalism. Granted that Hellenic greatness _as we know it_ was\r\n     \"inseparably limited to the system of independent city\r\n     commonwealths,\" it remains a rational proposition that had the\r\n     Greek cities federated they could have developed their general\r\n     culture further than they actually did, though the special\r\n     splendour of Periclean Athens could not in that case have been so\r\n     quickly attained. And as the _fall_ of Greece is no less\r\n     \"inseparably linked\" with the separateness of the States, Dr.\r\n     Freeman's proposition suggests or implies an assertion of the\r\n     desirableness of that fall. Mr. T. Whittaker, in his notable essay\r\n     on _The Liberal State_ (1907, pp. 70-72), rightly puts it as a\r\n     fatality of the Greek State that it could neither enter into nor\r\n     absorb a larger community, but recognises this as a failure to\r\n     solve the great problem. When, however, he writes that \"the free\r\n     development of Athens as an autonomous State would have been\r\n     restricted by a real federation in which other States had a voice\r\n     of their own,\" he partly sets up the difficulty created by Freeman.\r\n     Wherein would Athens have suffered as to freedom?\r\n\r\nThe lesson for modern democracies from the story of the ancient is thus\r\nclear enough. To flourish, they must have peace; they must sooner or\r\nlater practise a scientific and humane restraint of population--the\r\nsooner the better, as destruction of surplus population is always going\r\non, even with emigration; they must check inequality, which is the\r\nfountain of domestic dispeace; and they must maintain a progressive and\r\nscientific culture. And the lesson is one that may now be acted on as it\r\nnever could have been before. There is no longer a reserve of fecund\r\nbarbarism ready to overwhelm a civilisation that ceases to be\r\npugnacious; and the civilised States have it in their own power to\r\nsubmit their quarrels to bloodless arbitrament. The inveterate strifes\r\nof the Greeks belong to a past stage of civilisation, and were in any\r\ncase the product of peculiar geographical conditions, Greece being\r\nphysically divided, externally among islands, and internally into a\r\nmultitude of glens, which in the days of City-State life and primitive\r\nmeans of communication preserved a state of cantonal separateness and\r\nfeud, just as did the physical conditions of the Scottish Highlands in\r\nthe days before effective monarchic rule.\r\n\r\n     This permanent dissociation of the City-States was only a more\r\n     intractable form of the primary divisions of the districts. Thus in\r\n     Attica itself the divisions of party largely followed the\r\n     localities: \"There were as many parties among them as there were\r\n     different tracts of land in their country\"--the mountain-dwellers\r\n     being democratic, while the plain-dwellers were for an oligarchy,\r\n     and the coast-dwellers sought a mixed government. (Plutarch,\r\n     _Solon_, cc. 13, 29; Aristotle, _Polity of Athens_, c. 13.) See the\r\n     question further discussed below, ch. iv, Sec. 2 (_c_).\r\n\r\nIndeed, the fulness of the autonomous life attained by the separate\r\ncities was a psychological hindrance to their political union, given the\r\nprimary geographical sunderance. Thus we have in the old Amphictyonic\r\ncouncils the evidence of a measure of peaceful political attraction\r\namong the tribes before the cities were developed;[133] yet on those\r\nancient beginnings there was no political advance till the rise of\r\nformal federalism in the AEtolian and Achaian Leagues after the death of\r\nAlexander. And that federalism was not ethically higher than the spirit\r\nof the ancient Amphictyonic oath, preserved by AEschines. The balance of\r\nthe forces of separateness and political wisdom is to be conceived in\r\nterms of a given degree of culture relatively to a given set of physical\r\nconditions. Happily the deadlock in question no longer subsists for\r\ncivilised States.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is now possible a scientific control of population, without\r\ninfanticide, without vice, without abortion. There has been attained a\r\ndegree of democratic stability and enlightenment which given peace,\r\npermits of a secure gradual extension of the principle of equality by\r\nsound machinery. And there is now accumulated a treasury of seminal\r\nknowledge which makes possible an endless intellectual progress, the\r\ngreat antiseptic of political decay, provided only that the foregoing\r\nconditions are secured. This is, in brief, the programme of progressive\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Cp.

It would be needless to point out, were it not well to\r\nanticipate objection, that the foregoing summaries are not offered as a\r\ncomplete theory of progress even as commonly conceived, much less as\r\nsufficing to dismiss the dispute[134] as to what progress is, or what\r\nbasis there is for the modern conceptions bound up with the word. Our\r\ngeneralisations proceed on the assumption--not of course that human\r\naffairs must constantly improve in virtue of some cosmic law, but--that\r\nby most men of any education a certain advance in range of knowledge, of\r\nreflection, of skill, of civic amenity, of general comfort, is held to\r\nbe attainable and desirable; that such advances have clearly taken place\r\nin former periods; and that the due study of these periods and of\r\npresent conditions may lead to a further and indefinitely prolonged\r\nadvance. Conceiving progress broadly as occurring by way of rise in the\r\nquantity and the quality of pleasurable and intelligent life, we beg the\r\nquestion, for the purposes of this inquiry, as against those who may\r\nregard such a tendency with aversion, and those who may deny that such\r\nincrease ever takes place. Taking as proved the evolution of mankind\r\nfrom lower forms of animal life, we conceive such evolution as\r\nimmeasurably slow in the period before the attainment of agriculture,\r\nwhich may serve as the stage at which what we term \"civilisation\"\r\nbegins. Only with agriculture begins the \"civitas,\" as distinct from the\r\nhorde or tribe. Thenceforth all advance in arts and ethics, no less than\r\nin political co-ordination, counts as \"civilisation.\" The problem is,\r\nhow to diagnose advance.\r\n\r\nAll of us, roughly speaking, understand by progress the moving of things\r\nin the way we want them to go; and the ideals underlying the present\r\ntreatise are easily seen, though it does not aim at an exhaustive survey\r\nof the conditions and causes of what it assumes to be progressive forms\r\nor phases of civilisation. To reach even a working theory, however, we\r\nhave to make, as it were, cross-sections in our anatomy, and to view the\r\nmovement of civilisation in terms of the conditions which increase men's\r\nstock of knowledge and extend their imaginative art. To lay a\r\nfoundation, we have to subsume Buckle's all-important generalisation as\r\nto the effect of food and life conditions in differentiating what we may\r\nbroadly term the primary from the secondary civilisation. Thus we think\r\nfrom \"civilisation\" to _a_ civilisation.\r\n\r\n     Buckle drew his capital distinction, so constantly ignored by his\r\n     critics, between \"European\" and \"non-European\" civilisations. This\r\n     broadly holds good, but is a historical rather than a sociological\r\n     proposition. The process of causation is one of life conditions;\r\n     and the first great steps in the higher Greek civilisation were\r\n     made in Asia Minor, in contact with Asiatic life, even as the\r\n     earlier civilisations, such as the \"Minoan\" of Crete, now being\r\n     traced through recovered remains, grew up in contact with both\r\n     Egypt and the East. (Cp. Prof. Burrows, _The Discoveries in Crete_,\r\n     1907, chs. v, ix.) The distinction here made between \"primary\" and\r\n     \"secondary\" civilisations is of course merely relative, applying as\r\n     it does only to the historic period. We can but mark off the known\r\n     civilisations as standing in certain relations one to another. Thus\r\n     the Roman civilisation was in reality complex before the conquest\r\n     of Greece, inasmuch as it had undergone Italo-Greek and Etruscan\r\n     influences representing a then ancient culture. But the Roman\r\n     militarist system left the Roman civilisation in itself\r\n     unprogressive, and prevented it from being durably fertilised by\r\n     the Greek.\r\n\r\nProceeding from general laws to particular cases, we may roughly say\r\nthat:--\r\n\r\n(1) Primary civilisations arise in regions specially favourable to the\r\nregular production of abundant food, and lying inland, so as not to\r\noffer constant temptation to piratical raids. (Fertile coast land is\r\ndefensible only by a strong community.)\r\n\r\n(2) Such food conditions tend to maintain an abundant population,\r\nreadily lending itself to exploitation by rulers, and so involving\r\ndespotism and subordination. They also imply, as a rule, level\r\nterritories, which facilitate conquest and administration, and thus also\r\ninvolve military autocracy.\r\n\r\n     The general law that facile food conditions, supporting large\r\n     populations in a primary civilisation, generate despotisms, was\r\n     explicitly put in the eighteenth century by Walckenaer (_Essai sur\r\n     l'histoire de l'espece humaine_, 1798, l. v, ch. iv, p. 198).\r\n     Montesquieu, whose reasonings on climate and soil tend to be\r\n     fanciful and non-economic (cp. Volney, _Lecons d'Histoire_, 6ieme\r\n     seance; and Buckle, Routledge's ed. pp. 24, 468-69), noted the fact\r\n     that sterile Attica was relatively democratic, and fertile\r\n     Lakedaimon aristocratic; and further (following Plutarch) decides\r\n     that mountaineers tend to be democratic, plain-dwellers subject to\r\n     rulers, and coast-dwellers something midway between (_Esprit des\r\n     Lois_, l. xviii, ch. i). He is right in his facts, but misses the\r\n     economic explanation. The fact that mountaineers as such are not\r\n     easy to conquer, doubtless counts for a good deal. See it touched\r\n     on in Gray's unfinished poem on the _Alliance between Government\r\n     and Education_, written before the appearance of the _Esprit des\r\n     Lois_, and stopped by Gray on the ground that \"the Baron had\r\n     forestalled some of his best thoughts\" (Gray's _Works_, ed. 1821,\r\n     p. 274). The point is discussed more fully in Dr. Dunbar's _Essays\r\n     on the History of Mankind_, 1780, Essay vi.\r\n\r\n(3) If the nation with such conditions is well aloof from other nations,\r\nin virtue of being much more civilised than its near neighbours, and of\r\nbeing self-sufficing as regards its produce, its civilisation (as in the\r\ncases of China and Incarial Peru and ancient Egypt) is likely to be\r\nextremely conservative. Above all, lack of racial interbreeding involves\r\nlack of due variation. No \"pure\" race ever evolved rapidly or highly.\r\nEven the conservative primary civilisations (as the Egyptian, Chinese,\r\nand Akkadian) rested on much race mixture.\r\n\r\n     As Dr. Draper has well pointed out (_Intellect. Develop. of\r\n     Europe_, ed. 1875, i, 84-88), the peculiar regularity of Egyptian\r\n     agriculture, depending as it did on the Nile overflow, which made\r\n     known in advance the quantity of the crops, lent itself especially\r\n     to a stable system of life and administration. The long-lasting\r\n     exclusion of foreigners there, as in China and in Sparta, would\r\n     further secure sameness of culture; and only by such causes can\r\n     special unprogressiveness anywhere arise. Sir Henry Maine's\r\n     formula, marking off progressive and unprogressive civilisations as\r\n     different species, is merely verbal, and is not adhered to by\r\n     himself. (The point is discussed at some length by the present\r\n     writer in _Buckle and his Critics_, pp. 402-8.) Maine's distinction\r\n     was drawn long ago by Eusebe Salverte (_De la Civilisation depuis\r\n     les premiers temps_, 1813, p. 22, _seq._), who philosophically goes\r\n     on to indicate the conditions which set up the differentiation;\r\n     though in later references (_Essai sur les noms d'hommes_, 1824,\r\n     pref. p. ii; _Des Sciences occultes_, 1829, pref. p. vi) he recurs\r\n     to the empirical form of his proposition, which is that adhered to\r\n     by Maine.\r\n\r\n(4) When an old civilisation comes in steady contact with that of a race\r\nof not greatly inferior but less ancient culture, physically so situated\r\nas to be much less amenable to despotism (that is, in a hilly or\r\notherwise easily defensible region), it is likely so to fecundate the\r\nfresher civilisation that the latter, if not vitiated by a bad political\r\nsystem, will soon surpass it,[135] provided that the latter community in\r\nturn is duly crossed as regards its stock, and that the former has due\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n(5) In other words, a primitive but not barbarous people, placed in a\r\nregion not highly fruitful but not really unpropitious to human life, is\r\nthe less likely to fall tamely under a despotism because its population\r\nis not so easily multiplied and maintained;[136] and such a people, when\r\nphysiologically variated by a mixture of stocks, and when mentally\r\nfecundated by contact with older civilisations, tends to develop what we\r\nterm a secondary civilisation, higher in all respects than those which\r\nhave stimulated it.[137]\r\n\r\n(6) A very great disparity in the culture-stages of meeting races,\r\nhowever, is as unfavourable to the issue of a higher civilisation from\r\ntheir union as to a useful blending of their stocks.[138] Thus it fares\r\nill with the contact of higher and lower races even in a climate equally\r\nfavourable to both; and where it is favourable to the latter only, there\r\nis likely to be no immediate progress in the lower race, while in the\r\nterms of the case the higher will deteriorate or disappear.[139]\r\n\r\n(7) Where a vigorous but barbarian race overruns one much more\r\ncivilised, there is similarly little prospect of immediate gain to\r\nprogress, though after a period of independent growth the newer\r\ncivilisation may be greatly fecundated by intelligent resort to the\r\nremains of the older.\r\n\r\n     The cases of China and the Roman Empire may serve as illustrations.\r\n     They were, however, different in that the northern invasion of Rome\r\n     was by relatively considerable masses, while the Tartar conquerors\r\n     of China were easily absorbed in the vast native population.\r\n\r\n(8) Where, again, independent States at nearly the same stage of\r\ncivilisation, whether speaking the same or different languages, stand in\r\na position of commerce and rivalry, but without desperate warfare, the\r\nfriction and cross-fertilisation of ideas, together with the mixture of\r\nstocks, will develop a greater and higher intellectual and artistic life\r\nthan can conceivably arise in one great State without great or close\r\nrivals, since there one set of ideals or standards is likely to overbear\r\nall others, with the result of partly stereotyping taste and opinion.\r\n\r\n     This point is well put by Hume as to Greece, in his essay _Of the\r\n     Rise of the Arts and Sciences_ (1752); and after him by Gibbon, ch.\r\n     53, Bohn ed. vi, 233; Cp. Heeren, _Pol. Hist. of Ancient Greece_,\r\n     Eng. tr. p. 42; Walckenaer, _Essai_ cited, p. 338; Ferguson, _Essay\r\n     on the History of Civil Society_, 1767, pp. 182, 183; Dunbar,\r\n     _Essays on the History of Mankind_, 1780, pp. 257, 271; Goguet, _De\r\n     l'origine des lois, des arts, et des sciences_, 1758, iii Epoque,\r\n     L. ii, ch. 2; Salverte, _De la Civilisation_, 1813, pp. 83-88;\r\n     Grote, _History of Greece_, pt. ii, ch. i, ed. 1888, ii, 156;\r\n     Cunningham, _Western Civilisation_, i, 75. Grote brings out very\r\n     clearly the \"mutuality of action and reaction\" in the case of the\r\n     maritime Greeks as compared with the others and with other nations.\r\n     See also Hegel, _Philos. der Geschichte_, Th. ii, Absch. i (ed.\r\n     1840, p. 275). Hegel, besides noting the abstract element of\r\n     geographical variety, points to the highly mixed character of the\r\n     Greek stocks, especially in Attica. So Salverte, as cited. The same\r\n     principle is rightly put by Guizot (_Hist. de la civilisation en\r\n     France_, i, lecon 2), and accepted by J.S. Mill (_On Liberty_, ch.\r\n     iii, end), as a main explanation of the intellectual progress of\r\n     modern Europe. It is therefore worth weighing as regards given\r\n     peoples, by those who, like Mr. Bryce, see nothing but harm in the\r\n     subdivision of Germany after the Thirty Years' War (_Holy Roman\r\n     Empire_, 8th ed. p. 346). Against the undoubted evils connected\r\n     with the partition system ought to be set the intellectual gains\r\n     which latterly arose from it when the intellectual life of Germany\r\n     had, as it were, recovered breath.\r\n\r\n(9) Thus, while an empire with a developed civilisation may communicate\r\nit to uncivilised conquered peoples not too far below its own\r\nanthropological level, the secondary civilisation thus acquired is in\r\nits nature less \"viable,\" less capable of independent evolution, than\r\none set up by the free commerce of trading peoples. The most rapid\r\ngrowths of civilisation appear always to have occurred by way of the\r\nmultiplying of free contacts among trading communities, and among the\r\nfree colonies of such.[140] The \"money economy\" they introduced was a\r\ngreat instrument of social and industrial evolution;[141] and on such\r\ncity civilisations the ancient empires themselves seem always to have\r\nproceeded.[142]\r\n\r\n(10) Every phase of civilisation has its special drawbacks, so that\r\ngreat retrogression may follow on great development, especially when\r\nadventitious sources of wealth are the foundation of a luxurious\r\nculture. In some cases a great development may be dependent on an\r\nexhaustible source of wealth, as in the case of Britain's coal supply,\r\nthe empire of ancient Rome, the primacy of the Pope before the\r\nReformation, or even the Periclean empire of Athens, and the trade\r\nmonopolies of Venice, the Hansa Towns, and the Dutch Republic.\r\n\r\n(11) The expression \"decay\" as applied to a people, however, has only a\r\nrelative significance: used absolutely, it stands for a delusion.\r\nEconomic conditions may worsen, and military power decline; but such\r\nprocesses imply no physiological degeneration. All the \"dead\"\r\ncivilisations of the past were _overthrown or absorbed by military\r\nviolence_; and there is no known case of a nation physically well placed\r\ndying out.\r\n\r\n     Professor W.D. Whitney, who is usually so well worth listening to,\r\n     fails to recognise this fact in his interesting essay on \"China and\r\n     the Chinese\" (_Oriental and Linguistic Studies_, 2nd series). He\r\n     declares that \"according to the ordinary march of events in human\r\n     history, the Chinese empire should have perished from decay, and\r\n     its culture either have become extinct or have passed into the\r\n     keeping of another race, more than two thousand years ago. It had\r\n     already reached the limit to its capacity of development\" (p. 88).\r\n     Similarly Ratzel pronounces (_History of Mankind_, Eng. tr. 1896,\r\n     i, 26) that \"Voltaire hits the point when he says Nature has given\r\n     the Chinese the organ for discovering all that is _useful_ to them,\r\n     but not for going _any further_.\" Voltaire never penned such a\r\n     \"bull.\" He wrote (_Essai sur les moeurs_, Avant-Propos, ch. i),\r\n     \"Il _semble_ que la Nature ait donne,\" and \"_necessaire_,\" not\r\n     \"useful.\" Even that has a touch of paralogism; but the great\r\n     essayist goes on to suggest two causes for Chinese\r\n     conservatism--their ancestral piety and the nature of their method\r\n     of writing. The first is a pseudo-explanation; the second is a\r\n     _vera causa_, though only one of those involved. The German\r\n     specialist of to-day is really further from the scientific point of\r\n     view than the French wit of the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\n     going on as he does to decide that \"defect in their endowments\"\r\n     causes the mediocrity of the Chinese, and \"also is the sole cause\r\n     of the rigidity in their social system.\"\r\n\r\n     This is a vain saying; and it is no less vain to go on to ask, as\r\n     Professor Whitney does, what has become of Egypt, of the\r\n     Phoenicians and Hebrews, of the Persians, of Greece and Rome, and\r\n     of Spain. The answer is easy. Egypt was conquered, and the old race\r\n     still reproduces itself, in vassalage. The \"Pelasgic\" civilisation\r\n     of ancient Greece was absorbed by the Greek invaders. The\r\n     \"Mycenaean\" and \"Minoan\" civilisations, as seen in ancient Troy and\r\n     \"Minoan\" Crete, were conquered and partly absorbed. The\r\n     Phoenicians and Hebrews were destroyed or absorbed. The Persians\r\n     are at present retrograde, but may rise again.[143] Rome and Greece\r\n     were successively overrun by barbarism. Spain, like Italy,\r\n     retrograded, but, like Italy, is on the path of regeneration. In\r\n     all these cases the process of causation is obvious. No nation dies\r\n     or disappears save by violence; and, given the proper conditions,\r\n     all races are capable of progress indefinitely. China, though\r\n     unprogressive in comparison with a European State, has changed in\r\n     many respects within two thousand years--nay, within twenty.[144]\r\n     Professor Whitney adopts an empirical convention, and accordingly\r\n     misses any real elucidation of the problem of Chinese sociology,\r\n     which he assumes to solve (p. 87) by saying we must look for our\r\n     explanations \"deep in the foundations of the national character\r\n     itself.\" That is to say, the national character is determined by\r\n     the national character.\r\n\r\n     It is surely time that this palaeo-theological fashion of explaining\r\n     human affairs were superseded by the more fruitful method of\r\n     positive science, even as regards China, which is perhaps the worst\r\n     explained of all sociological cases. Like others, it had been\r\n     intelligently taken up by sociologists of the eighteenth century\r\n     before the conservative reaction (see the _Esprit des Lois_, vii,\r\n     6; viii, 21; x, 15; xiv, 8; xviii, 6; xix, 13-20; Dunbar's\r\n     _Essays_, as cited, pp. 257, 258, 262, 263, 321; and Walckenaer,\r\n     _Essai_ cited, pp. 175, 176); but that impetus seems to have been\r\n     thus far almost entirely lost. Voltaire's fallacy is remembered and\r\n     his truth ignored; and the methods of theology continue to be\r\n     applied to many questions of moral science after they have been\r\n     wholly cast out of physics and biology. The old \"falsisms\" of\r\n     empirical politics are repeated even by professed biologists when\r\n     they enter on the field of social science. Thus we have seen them\r\n     accepted by Dr. Draper, and we find Professor Huxley (_Evolution\r\n     and Ethics_, Romanes Lecture for 1893, p. 4) rhetorically putting\r\n     \"that successive rise, apogee, and fall of dynasties and states\r\n     which is the most prominent topic of civil history,\" as\r\n     scientifically analogous to the process of growth and decay and\r\n     death in the human organism. Any comparative study of history shows\r\n     the analogy to be spurious. Professor Whitney was doubtless\r\n     influenced, like Dr. Draper, by the American habit of regarding\r\n     European and ancient civilisations as necessarily decrepit because\r\n     \"slow\" and \"old.\" Cp. Draper as cited, ii, 393-98.\r\n\r\nIn the cases above dealt with, however, and in many others, there is\r\nseen to have been _intellectual_ decay, in the sense of, first, a\r\ncessation of forward movement, and, next, a loss of the power to\r\nappreciate ideas once current. A common cause of such paralysis of the\r\nhigher life is the malignant action of dogmatic religious systems, as in\r\nthe cases of Persia, Jewry, Byzantium, Islam, Spain under Catholicism,\r\nand Scotland for two centuries under Protestantism. Such paralysis by\r\nreligion may arise alike in a highly-organised but isolated State like\r\nByzantium, and in a semi-civilised country like Anglo-Saxon\r\nEngland.[145] The special malignity of dogma in these cases is itself of\r\ncourse a matter for analysis and explanation. Other cases are partly to\r\nbe explained by (_a_) the substitution of systematic militarism, always\r\nfatal to progressive culture, for a life of only occasional warfare,\r\nfavourable to study among the leisured class.[146] But (_b_) there is\r\nreason to surmise a further and profoundly important cause of\r\nintellectual retrogression in the usage which develops the culture of a\r\npeople for the most part in one sex only. The thesis may be ventured\r\nthat whereas vigorous and creative brains may arise in abundance in a\r\nyoung civilisation, where the sexes are physiologically not far removed\r\nfrom the approximate equality of the semi-barbarous stage, the\r\npsychological divergence set up by mentally and physically training the\r\nmales and not the females is likely to be unfavourable to the breeding\r\nof mentally energetic types.\r\n\r\n(12) Whether or not the last hypothesis be valid, it is clear that the\r\nco-efficient or constituent of intellectual progress in a people, given\r\nthe necessary conditions of peace and sufficient food, is multiplication\r\nof ideas; and this primarily results from international contact, or the\r\ncontact of wholly or partly independent communities of one people.\r\nMultiplication of arts and crafts is of course included under the head\r\nof ideas. But unless the stock of ideas is not merely in constant\r\nprocess of being added to among the studious or leisured class, but\r\ndisseminated among the other classes, stagnation will take place among\r\nthese, and will inevitably infect the educated class.\r\n\r\n     De Tocqueville, balancing somewhat inconclusively, because always\r\n     _in vacuo_, the forces affecting literature in aristocratic and\r\n     democratic societies, says decisively enough (_Democratie en\r\n     Amerique_, ed. 1850, ii, 62-63) that \"Toute aristocratie qui se met\r\n     entierement a part du peuple devient impuissante. Cela est vrai\r\n     dans les lettres aussi bien qu'en politique.\" This holds clearly\r\n     enough of Italian literature in the despotic period. Mr. Godkin's\r\n     criticism (_Problems of Modern Democracy_, p. 56) that \"M. de\r\n     Tocqueville and all his followers take it for granted that the\r\n     great incentive to excellence, in all countries in which excellence\r\n     is found, is the patronage and encouragement of an aristocracy,\" is\r\n     hardly accurate. De Tocqueville puts the case judicially enough, so\r\n     far as he goes; and Mr. Godkin falls into strange extravagance in\r\n     his counter statement that there is \"hardly a single historical\r\n     work composed prior to the end of the last [eighteenth] century,\r\n     except perhaps Gibbon's, which, judged by the standard that the\r\n     criticism of our day has set up, would not, though written for the\r\n     'few,' be pronounced careless, slipshod, or superficial.\"\r\n     Tillemont, by the testimony of Professor Bury, was a more thorough\r\n     worker in his special line than Gibbon. It would be easy to name\r\n     scores of writers in various branches of history in the seventeenth\r\n     and eighteenth centuries whom no good critic to-day would call\r\n     careless or slipshod; and if Hume and Robertson, Clarendon and\r\n     Burnet, be termed superficial, the \"standard\" will involve a\r\n     similar characterisation of most historical writers of our own day.\r\n     As regards present-day literary productions, De Tocqueville and Mr.\r\n     Godkin alike omit the necessary economic analysis.\r\n\r\n(13) In the intellectual infectiousness of all class degradation,\r\nproperly speaking, lies the final sociological (as apart from the\r\nprimary ethical) condemnation of slavery. The familiar argument that\r\nslavery first secured the leisure necessary for culture, even were it\r\nwholly instead of being merely partially true, would not rebut the\r\ncensure that falls to be passed on slavery in later stages of\r\ncivilisation. All the ancient States, before Greece, stood on slavery:\r\nthen it was not slavery that yielded her special culture. What she\r\ngained from older civilisations was the knowledge and the arts developed\r\nby _specialisation_ of pursuits; and such specialisation was not\r\nnecessarily dependent on slavery, which could abound without it. It was\r\nin the special employment, finally, of the exceptionally large _free_\r\npopulation of Athens that the greatest artistic output was reached.[147]\r\nIn later periods, the slave population was the great nucleus of\r\nsuperstition and anti-culture.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, then, as education is in only a small degree compatible with\r\ntoilsome poverty, the betterment of the material conditions of the\r\ntoiling class is essential to progress in ideas. That is to say,\r\ncontinual progress implies gradual elimination of class inequality, and\r\ncannot subsist otherwise. At the same time, a culture-class must be\r\nmaintained by new machinery when leisured wealth is got rid of.[148]\r\n\r\n(14) Again, it follows from the foregoing (4-10) that the highest\r\ncivilisation will be that in which the greatest number of varying\r\nculture-influences meet,[149] in the most happily-crossed stock, under\r\nclimatic conditions favourable to energy, on a basis of a civilisation\r\nsufficiently matured.[150] But in order to the effectual action of such\r\nvarious culture-influences through all classes of the nation in which\r\nthey meet, there is needed a constant application of social or political\r\nregimen. In the lack of that, a great conflux of culture-forces may miss\r\nfruition. A mere fortuitous depression of the rich class, and elevation\r\nof the poor, will not suffice to place a society on a sound or even on\r\nan improved footing. Such a change occurred in ancient Athens after\r\nSalamis, when the poorer sort, who had constituted the navy,\r\nflourished[151] as against the richer, who had been the land soldiery,\r\nand whose lands had been ravaged. But the forces of disintegration\r\nplayed afresh. Yet again, transient financial conditions, such as those\r\nof Italy before the Reformation, of Holland until the decline of its\r\nfishing and trade, and of Venice until its final commercial decay, may\r\nsustain a great artistic life, art having always depended on private or\r\npublic demand. Thus with a change in the geographical course of trade, a\r\ngreat phase of culture-life may dwindle. So many and so complex are the\r\nforces and conditions of progress in civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that most of the foregoing propositions have\r\ndirect reference to well-known facts of history. Thus (_a_) ancient\r\nEgypt represents a primary civilisation, marked indeed by some\r\nfluctuations connected with dynastic changes which involved mixture of\r\nstocks, but on the whole singularly fixed; while ancient Greek\r\ncivilisation was emphatically a secondary one, the fruit of much\r\nrace-mixture and many interacting culture-forces, all facilitated by the\r\ncommercial position and coast-conformation of Hellas.\r\n\r\n     This view is partly rejected by Grote in two passages (pt. i, chs.\r\n     xvi, xvii, ed. 1888, i, 326, 413) in which he gives to the\r\n     \"inherent and expansive force\" of \"the Greek mind\" the main credit\r\n     of Greek civilisation. But his words, to begin with, are confused\r\n     and contradictory: \"The transition of the Greek mind from its\r\n     poetical to its comparatively positive stage was self-operated,\r\n     accomplished by its own inherent and expansive force--_aided\r\n     indeed, but by no means either impressed or provoked_ from\r\n     without.\" In the second place, there is no basis for the denial of\r\n     \"impression or provocation\" from without. And finally, what is\r\n     decisive, the historian himself has in other passages acknowledged\r\n     that the Greeks received from Asia and Egypt just such\r\n     \"provocation\" as is seen to take place in varying degrees in the\r\n     culture-contacts of all nations (chs. xv, xvi, pp. 307, 329). Of\r\n     the contact with Egypt he expressly says that it \"enlarged the\r\n     range of their thoughts and observations.\" His whole treatment of\r\n     the rise of culture, however, is meagre and imperfect relatively to\r\n     his ample study of the culture itself. Later students grow more and\r\n     more unanimous as to the composite character of the Greek-speaking\r\n     stock in the earliest traceable periods of Hellenic life (cp. Bury,\r\n     _History of Greece_, ed. 1906, pp. 39-42, and Professor Burrows,\r\n     _The Discoveries in Crete_, 1907, p. 144), and the consequent\r\n     complexity of the entire Hellenic civilisation. The case is\r\n     suggestively put by Eduard Meyer (_Geschichte des Alterthums_, ii,\r\n     155) in the observation that while the west coast of Greece had as\r\n     many natural advantages as the eastern, it remained backward in\r\n     civilisation when the other had progressed far. \"_Here there lacked\r\n     the foreign stimulus_: the west of Greece is away from the source\r\n     of culture. Here, accordingly, primitive conditions continued to\r\n     rule, while in the east a higher culture evolved itself.... Corinth\r\n     in the older period played no part whatever, whether in story or in\r\n     remains.\" The same proposition was put a generation ago by A.\r\n     Bertrand, who pointed out that the coasts of Elis and Messenia are\r\n     \"incomparably more fertile\" than those of Argolis and Attica\r\n     (_Etudes de mythologie et d'archeologie grecques_, 1858, pp.\r\n     40-41); and again by Winwood Reade in _The Martyrdom of Man_ (1872,\r\n     p. 64): \"A glance at the map is sufficient to explain why it was\r\n     that Greece became civilised before the other European lands. It is\r\n     nearest to those countries in which civilisation first arose ...\r\n     compelled to grow towards Asia as a tree grows towards the light.\"\r\n     But to this generalisation should be put the qualifying clause\r\n     (above, p. 55) that fertile coasts when developed are defensible\r\n     only by a strongly organised community. Thus an early exploitation\r\n     of Elis and Messenia would be checked by piracy.\r\n\r\n     The question as to the originality of Greek culture, it is\r\n     interesting to note, was already discussed at the beginning of the\r\n     eighteenth century. See Shaftesbury's _Characteristics_, Misc. iii,\r\n     ch. i.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Greek land as a whole, especially the Attic, was only\r\nmoderately fertile, and therefore not so cheaply and redundantly\r\npopulated as Egypt.\r\n\r\n     The bracing effect of their relative poverty was fully recognised\r\n     by the Greeks themselves. Cp. Herodotus, vii, 102, and Thucydides,\r\n     i, 123. See on the same point Heeren, _Political History of Ancient\r\n     Greece_, Eng. tr. pp. 24-33; Thirlwall, _History of Greece_, small\r\n     ed. i, 12; Duncker, _Gesch. des Alterthums_, iii, ch. i, Sec. 1;\r\n     Wachsmuth, _Hist. Antiq. of the Greeks_, Sec. 8; Duruy, _Hist.\r\n     Grecque_, 1851, p. 7; Grote, part ii, ch. i (ed. 1888, ii, 160);\r\n     Boeckh, _Public Economy of Athens_, B. i, c. 8; Niebuhr,\r\n     _Lectures_, li (Eng. tr. 3rd ed. p. 265); Mahaffy, _Rambles and\r\n     Studies in Greece_, 4th ed. pp. 137, 164-67. Dr. Grundy\r\n     (_Thucydides and the History of his Age_, 1911, p. 58 _sq._) lays\r\n     stress on the fertility of the valleys, but recognises the\r\n     smallness of the fertile areas.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hellas was further so decisively cut up into separate cantons by\r\nits mountain ranges, and again in respect of the multitude of the\r\nislands, that the Greek districts were largely foreign to each\r\nother,[152] and their cultures had thus the advantage of reacting and\r\ninteracting, as against the disadvantage of their incurable political\r\nseparateness--that disadvantage in turn being correlative with the\r\nadvantage of insusceptibility to a despotism.\r\n\r\n     The effect of geographical conditions on Greek history is discussed\r\n     at length in Conrad Bursian's essay, _Ueber den Einfluss des\r\n     griechischen Landes auf den Charakter seiner Bewohner_, which I\r\n     have been unable to procure or see; but I gather from his\r\n     _Geographie von Griechenlands_ that he takes the view here set\r\n     forth. Cp. Senior's _Journal kept in Turkey and Greece_, 1859, p.\r\n     255, for a modern Greek's view of the state of his nation,\r\n     \"divided into small districts by mountain ranges intersecting each\r\n     other in all directions without a road or canal\"; the deduction\r\n     from the same perception made by the young Arthur Stanley\r\n     (Prothero's _Life of Dean Stanley_, 1-vol. ed. p. 143); and the\r\n     impression retained from his travels by M. Bertrand, _Etudes de\r\n     mythologie et d'archeologie grecques_, 1858, p. 199.\r\n\r\n     The profound importance of the geographical fact has been\r\n     recognised more or less clearly and fully by many writers--_e.g._,\r\n     Hume, essay Of the _Rise and Progress of the Arts and the Sciences_\r\n     (ed. 1825 of _Essays_, i, 115-16); Gillies, _History of Greece_,\r\n     1-vol. ed. p. 5; Heeren, as cited, pp. 35, 75; Duncker, as last\r\n     cited, also ch. iii, Sec. 12 (2te Aufl. 1860, p. 601); Duruy, ch. i;\r\n     Cox, _General History of Greece_, bk. i, ch. i; Thirlwall, ch. x;\r\n     Wachsmuth, Eng. tr. i, 87; Comte, _Cours de Philosophie Positive_,\r\n     Lecon 53ieme; Grote, pt. ii, ch. i (ii, 155); Finlay, _History of\r\n     Greece_, Tozer's ed. i, 28; K.O. Mueller, _Introd. to Scientific\r\n     Mythology_, Eng. tr. p. 179; Hegel, as last cited; Hertzberg,\r\n     _Geschichte von Hellas und Rom_, 1879 (in Oncken's series), i, 9;\r\n     Winwood Reade, _The Martyrdom of Man_, 1872, p. 65 sq.; Bury,\r\n     _History of Greece_, ed. 1906, pp. 2-4; Fyffe (very explicitly),\r\n     _Primer of Greek History_, p. 8--but it is strangely overlooked by\r\n     writers to whom one turns for a careful study of causes. Even\r\n     Grote, after having clearly set forth (ii, 150) the predetermining\r\n     influence of land-form, attributes Greek divisions to the\r\n     \"character of the race,\" which even in this connection, however, he\r\n     describes as \"splitting _by natural fracture_ into a multitude of\r\n     self-administering, indivisible cities\" (pt. ii, ch. 28,\r\n     beginning); and Sir George Cox, after specifying the geographical\r\n     factor, speaks of it as merely \"fostering\" a love of isolation\r\n     _resulting_ from \"political creed.\" Freeman (_History of Federal\r\n     Government_) does not seem to apply the geographical fact to the\r\n     explanation of any phase of Greek history, though he sees in Greece\r\n     (ed. 1893, pp. 92, 554) \"each valley and peninsula and island\r\n     marked out by the hand of nature for an independent being,\" and\r\n     quotes (p. 559) Cantu as to the effect of land-form on history in\r\n     Italy. In so many words he pronounces (p. 101) that the love of\r\n     town-autonomy was \"inherent in the Greek mind.\" Mr. Warde Fowler\r\n     (_City-State of the Greeks and Romans_) does not once give heed to\r\n     the geographical conditions of causation, always speaking of the\r\n     Greeks as lacking the \"faculty\" of union as compared with the\r\n     Latins, though the Eastern Empire finally showed greater cohesive\r\n     power than the Western. Even Mr. Fyffe (_Primer_ cited, p. 127),\r\n     despite his preliminary recognition of the facts, finally speaks of\r\n     the Greeks as relatively lacking in the \"gift for government.\"\r\n\r\n     The same assumption is made in Lord Morley's _Compromise_ (ed.\r\n     1888, p. 108) in the allusion to \"peoples so devoid of the\r\n     sovereign faculty of political coherency as were the Greeks and\r\n     the Jews.\" Lord Morley's proposition is that such peoples may\r\n     still evolve great civilising ideas; but though that is true, the\r\n     implied thesis as to \"faculty\" weakens even the truth. The case of\r\n     the Jews is to be explained in exactly the same way as that of the\r\n     Greeks, the face of Palestine being disjunct and segregate in a\r\n     peculiar degree. Other \"Semites,\" living in great plains, were\r\n     united in great monarchies. The sound view of the case as to Rome\r\n     is put by Hertzberg: \"Soll man im Gegensatze zu der hellenischen\r\n     Geschichte es in kuerzester Fassung bezeichnen, so kann man etwa\r\n     sagen, die italische Landesnatur stellte der Ausbildung eines\r\n     grossen _einheitlich_ geordneten Staates durchaus nicht die\r\n     gewaltigen Hindernisse entgegen, wie das in Griechenland der Fall\r\n     war\" (_Gesch. von Hellas und Rom_, ii, 7). Cp. Shuckburgh, _History\r\n     of Rome_, 1894, p. 9, as to \"the vast heights which effectually\r\n     separate tribes.\" Dr. Cunningham puts it (_Western Civilisation_,\r\n     i, 152, 160) that Roman expansion in Italy came of the need to\r\n     reach a true frontier of defence, in the lack of physical barriers\r\n     to the early States. (So Lord Cromer, _Anc. and Mod. Imperialism_,\r\n     1910, p. 19.) It seems more plausible to say that all of the States\r\n     concerned were positively disposed to conquest, and that the\r\n     physical conditions of Italy made possible an overrunning which in\r\n     early Greece was impossible.\r\n\r\n     The theory of \"faculty,\" consistently applied on Mr. Fowler's and\r\n     Lord Morley's lines, would credit the French with an innate gift of\r\n     union much superior to that of the Germans--at least in the modern\r\n     period--and the Chinese with the greatest \"faculty\" of all. But the\r\n     long maintenance of one rule over all China is clearly due in large\r\n     part to the \"great facility of internal intercourse\" (Davis, _The\r\n     Chinese_, Introd.) so long established. The Roman roads were half\r\n     the secret of the cohesion of the Empire. Dr. Draper suggests,\r\n     ingeniously but inaccurately, that Rome had strength and permanence\r\n     because of lying east and west, and thus possessing greater racial\r\n     homogeneity than it would have had if it lay north and south\r\n     (_Intel. Devel. of Europe_, _i_, 11). On the other hand,\r\n     mountainous Switzerland remains still cantonally separate, though\r\n     the pressure of surrounding States, beginning with that of Austria,\r\n     forced a political union. Compare the case of the clans of the\r\n     Scottish Highlands down to the road-making period after the last\r\n     Jacobite rising. See the principle discussed in Mr. Spencer's\r\n     _Principles of Sociology_, i, Sec. 17.\r\n\r\n     It may be well, before leaving the subject, to meet the important\r\n     criticism of the geographical principle by Fustel de Coulanges (_La\r\n     Cite antique_, liv. iii, ch. xiv, p. 238, edit. 1880). Noting that\r\n     the incurable division of the Greeks has been attributed to the\r\n     nature of their land, and that it has been said that the\r\n     intersecting mountains established lines of natural demarcation\r\n     among men, he goes on to argue: \"But there are no mountains\r\n     between Thebes and Plataea, between Argos and Sparta, between\r\n     Sybaris and Crotona. There were none between the towns of Latium,\r\n     or between the twelve cities of Etruria. Physical nature has\r\n     doubtless some influence on the history of peoples, but the beliefs\r\n     of men have a much greater. Between two neighbouring cities there\r\n     was something more impassable than a mountain--to wit, the series\r\n     of sacred limits, the difference of cults, the barrier which each\r\n     city set up between the stranger and its Gods.\"\r\n\r\n     All this, so far as it goes, is substantially true, but it does not\r\n     at all conflict with the principle as above set forth. Certainly\r\n     all cities, like all tribes, were primarily separatist; though even\r\n     in religious matters there was some measure of early peaceful\r\n     inter-influence, and a certain tendency to syncresis as well as to\r\n     separateness. (Cp. K.O. Mueller, _Dorians_, Eng. tr. i, 228.) But\r\n     the principle is not special to the cities of Greece. Cities and\r\n     tribes were primarily separatist in Babylonia and in Egypt. How,\r\n     then, were these regions nevertheless monarchised at an early\r\n     period? Clearly by reason of the greater invitingness and\r\n     feasibility of conquest in such territories--for their unification\r\n     was forcible. The conditions had thus both an objective and a\r\n     subjective, a suggestive and a permissive force, both lacking in\r\n     Greece. Again, the twelve cities of Etruria _formed a league_. If\r\n     they did so more readily and effectually than the Greeks, is not\r\n     the level character of their territory, which made them\r\n     collectively open to attack, and facilitated intercourse, one of\r\n     the obviously probable causes? No doubt the close presence of\r\n     hostile and alien races was a further unifying force which did not\r\n     arise in Greece. Etruria, finally, like Latium, was unified by\r\n     conquest; the question is, Why was not Greece? There is no answer\r\n     save one--that in the pre-Alexandrian period no Greek State had\r\n     acquired the military and administrative skill and resources needed\r\n     to conquer and hold such a divided territory. Certainly the\r\n     conditions conserved the ideal of separateness and non-aggression\r\n     or non-assimilation, so that cities which had easy access to each\r\n     other respected each other's ideal. But here again it was known\r\n     that an attempt at conquest would probably lead to alliances\r\n     between the attacked State and others; and the physical conditions\r\n     prevented any State save Macedonia from becoming overwhelmingly\r\n     strong. To these conditions, then, we always return, not as to sole\r\n     causes, but as to determinants.\r\n\r\n(_d_) In Egypt, again, culture was never deeply disseminated, and before\r\nAlexander was hardly at all fecundated by outside contact. In Greece\r\nthere was always the great uncultured slave substratum; and the arrest\r\nof freedom, to say nothing of social ignorance, female subjection, and\r\nsexual perversion, ultimately kept vital culture stationary. In Rome,\r\nmilitarism and the multiplication of the slave class, along with the\r\ndeletion of the independent and industrious middle class, made\r\nprogressive culture impossible, as surely as it broke down\r\nself-government. In all cases alike, over-population, not being met by\r\nscience, either bred poverty or was obviated by crime and vice.\r\n\r\nThe so-called regeneration of Europe by the barbarian conquest, finally,\r\nwas simply the beginning of a long period of corrupted and internecine\r\nbarbarism, the old culture remaining latent; and not till after many\r\ncenturies did the maturing barbaric civilisation in times of compulsory\r\npeace reach the capacity of being fecundated by the intelligent\r\nassimilation of the old. But after the Renaissance, as before, the\r\ndiseases of militarism and class privilege and the political subjection\r\ncaused a backthrow and intellectual stagnation, which was assisted by\r\nthe commercial decline brought upon Italy; so that in the feudal period,\r\nin one State after another, we have the symptoms of, as it were, senile\r\n\"decay\" and retrogression.[153] In all cases this is to be set down\r\nproximately to the deficit of new ideas, and in some to excess of\r\nstrife, which exhausted spare energy among the leisured class, deepened\r\nthe misery of the toilers, and normally prevented the intelligent\r\nintercourse of peoples. It is become a commonplace of historical\r\nphilosophy that the Crusades wrought for good inasmuch as they meant\r\nfresh communication between East and West. Yet it may be doubted whether\r\nmuch more was not done through the quiet contacts of peace between\r\nSaracen and Christian in Western Europe, and by the commerce with the\r\nEast which preceded the Crusades,[154] than by the forced intercourse\r\nfollowing on religious war. In any case, the transition from quasi-decay\r\nto progress in Christendom is clearly due to the entrance of new ideas\r\nof many species from many directions into the common stock; Greek\r\nletters, Saracen physics, and new geographical discovery all combining\r\nto generate thought.\r\n\r\nThe case of Japan, again, compares with both that of ancient Greece and\r\nthat of modern Europe. Its separate civilisation, advantageously placed\r\nin an archipelago, drew stimulus early in the historic period from that\r\nof China; and, while long showing the Chinese unprogressiveness in other\r\nrespects, partly in virtue of the peculiar burdensomeness of the\r\nChino-Japanese system of ideograms, it made remarkable progress on the\r\nside of art. The recent rapid industrial development (injurious to the\r\nartistic life) is plainly a result of the European and American\r\ncontact; and if only the mechanism of reading and writing be made\r\nmanageable on the European lines, and the snare of militarism be\r\nescaped, the Japanese civilisation may develop mentally as much as it is\r\ndoing industrially and in military organisation.\r\n\r\nIt suffices the practical political student, then, to note that progress\r\nis thus always a matter of intelligible causation; and, without\r\nconcerning himself about predicting the future or estimating the sum of\r\npossibilities, to take up the tasks of contemporary politics as all\r\nother tasks are taken up by practical men, as a matter of adaptation of\r\nmeans to ends. The architect and engineer have nothing to do with\r\ncalculating as to when the energy of the solar system will be wholly\r\ntransmuted. As little has the politician to do with absolute estimates\r\nof the nature of progress. All alike have to do with the study of laws,\r\nforces, and economics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nWe may now, then, set forth the all-pervading biological forces or\r\ntendencies of attraction and repulsion in human affairs as the main\r\nprimary factors in politics or corporate life, which it is the problem\r\nof human science to control by counteracting or guiding; and we may\r\nwithout further illustration set down the principal modes in which these\r\ninstincts appear. They are, broadly speaking:--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Animal pugnacities and antipathies of States or peoples,\r\n     involving combinations, sanctified from the first by religion, and\r\n     surviving as racial aspirations in subject peoples.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Class divisions, economically produced, resulting in class\r\n     combinations and hostilities within a State, and, in particular,\r\n     popular desire for betterment.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The tendency to despotism as a cure for class oppression or\r\n     anarchy; and the spirit of conquest.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) The beneficent lure of commerce, promoting intercourse,\r\n     countered by the commercial jealousies of States.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Designs of rulers, giving rise to popular or aristocratic\r\n     factions--complicated by questions of succession and loyalism.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) Religious combinations, antipathies, and ambitions,\r\n     international or sectarian. In more educated communities, ideals of\r\n     government and conduct.\r\n\r\nIn every one of these modes, be it observed, the instinct of repulsion\r\ncorrelates with the instinct of attraction. The strifes are the strifes\r\nof combinations, of groups or masses united in themselves by sympathy,\r\nin antipathy to other groups or masses. The _esprit de corps_ arises\r\nalike in the species, the horde, the tribe, the community, the class,\r\nthe faction, the nation, the trade or profession, the Church, the sect,\r\nthe party. Always men unite to oppose; always they must love to hate,\r\nfraternise to struggle.\r\n\r\n     The analogies in physics are obvious, but need not here be dwelt\r\n     upon. There is a risk of losing concrete impressions, which are\r\n     here in view, in a highly generalised statement of cosmic\r\n     analogies. But it may be well to point out that a general view will\r\n     perfectly reconcile the superficially conflicting doctrines of\r\n     recent biologists, as to \"progress by struggle\" and \"progress by\r\n     co-operation.\" Both statements hold good, the two phases being\r\n     correlatives.\r\n\r\nI have said that it is extremely difficult to imagine a state of society\r\nin which there shall be no public operation of any one of these forces.\r\nI am disposed to say it is impossible, but for scientific purposes\r\nprefer to put simply the difficulties of the conception. A cessation of\r\nwar is not only easily conceivable, but likely; but a cessation of\r\nstrife of aspiration would mean a state of biological equilibrium\r\nthroughout the civilised world. Now, pure equilibrium is by general\r\nconsent a state only momentarily possible; and the state of dissolution\r\nof unions, were that to follow, would involve strife of opinion at least\r\nup to a certain point. But just as evolution is now visibly towards an\r\nabandonment of brute strife among societies, so may it be reasonably\r\nexpected that the strife of ideals and doctrines within societies,\r\nthough now perhaps emotionally intense in proportion to the limitation\r\nof brute warfare, will gradually be freed of malevolent passion as\r\norganisms refine further. Passion, in any case, has hitherto been at\r\nonce motive-power and hindrance--the omnipresent force, since all ideas\r\nhave their correlative emotion. A perception of this has led to some\r\nneedless dispute over what is called the \"economic theory\" of history;\r\ncritics insisting that men are ruled by non-economic as well as economic\r\nmotives.[155] The solution is perfectly simple. Men are proximately\r\nruled by their passions or emotions; and the supremacy of the economic\r\nfactor consists in its being, for the majority, the most permanent\r\ndirector or stimulant of feeling. Therefore, the great social\r\nrectification, if it ever come, must needs be economic.\r\n\r\nCertainly, on the principle laid down, there is a likelihood that strife\r\nof ideals and doctrines may be for a time intensified by the very\r\nprocess of social reform, should that go to lessen the stress of the\r\nindustrial struggle for existence. It is easy to see that England has in\r\nthe past hundred and twenty years escaped the stress of domestic strife\r\nwhich in France wrought successive revolutions, not so much by any\r\nvirtue in its partially democratic constitution as by the fact that on\r\nthe one hand a war was begun with France by the English ruling classes\r\nat an early stage of the first revolution, and that on the other hand\r\nthe animal energies of the middle and lower classes were on the whole\r\nfreer than those of the French to run in the channels of industrial\r\ncompetition. People peacefully fighting each other daily in trade, not\r\nto speak of sports, were thereby partly safeguarded from carrying the\r\ninstincts of attraction and repulsion in politics to the length of\r\ninsurrection and civil war. When the strife of trade became congested,\r\nthe spirit of political strife, fed by hunger, broke out afresh, to be\r\nagain eased off when the country had an exciting foreign war on hand. So\r\nobvious is this that it may be the last card of Conservatism to play off\r\nthe war spirit against the reform spirit, as was done with some\r\ntemporary success in England by Beaconsfield, and as is latterly being\r\ndone by his successors.[156] The climaxing movement of political\r\nrationalism is evidently dependent on the limitation of the field of\r\nindustrial growth and the absence of brute warfare. And if, as seems\r\nconceivable, political rationalism attains to a scientific provision for\r\nthe well-being of the mass of the people, we shall have attained a\r\ncondition in which the forces of attraction and repulsion, no longer\r\nflowing freely in the old social channels, may be expected to dig new\r\nones or deepen those lately formed. The future channels, generally\r\nspeaking, would tend to lie in the regions of political, ethical, and\r\nreligious opinion; and the partial disuse of any one of these will tend\r\nto bring about the deepening of the others.\r\n\r\nBut this is going far ahead; and it is our business rather to make\r\nclear, with the help of an analysis of analogous types of civilisation,\r\nwhat has happened in the modern past of our country. The simple general\r\nlaws under notice are universal, and will be found to apply in all\r\nstages of history, though the interpretation of many phases of life by\r\ntheir means may be a somewhat complex matter.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the life of China[157] (above discussed) and that of India\r\nmay at first sight seem to give little colour to the assumption of a\r\nconstant play of social attraction and repulsion. The \"unprogressiveness\r\nof Asia\" is dwelt on alike by many who know Asia and many who do not.\r\nBut this relative unprogressiveness is to be explained, like European\r\nprogress, in terms of the conditions. China is simply a case of\r\ncomparative culture-stability and culture-isolation. The capital\r\ncondition of progress in civilisation has always been, as aforesaid, the\r\ncontact of divergent races whose independent culture-elements, though\r\ndifferent, are not greatly different in grade and prestige. Now, the\r\noutside contacts of China, down till the eighteenth century, had been\r\neither with races which had few elements of civilisation to give her,\r\nlike the Mongols, or with a civilisation little different from or less\r\nvigorous than her own, like that of India. Even these contacts counted\r\nfor much, and Chinese history has been full of political convulsions,\r\ndespite--or in keeping with--the comparative stagnation of Chinese\r\nculture. (On this see Peschel, _Races of Men_, Eng. tr. pp. 361-74. Cp.\r\nHuc, _Chinese Empire_, Eng. tr. ed. 1859, p. xvii; Walckenaer, _Essai\r\nsur l'histoire de l'espece humaine_, 1798, pp. 175, 176; and Maine,\r\n_Early History of Institutions_, pp. 226, 227). The very pigtail which\r\nfor Europe is the symbol of Chinese civilisation is only two hundred\r\nyears old, having come in with the Mantchoo dynasty; and the policy of\r\nsystematically excluding foreigners dates from the same period (Huc, p.\r\n236). \"No one,\" writes Professor Flint, \"who has felt interest enough in\r\nthat singular nation to study the researches and translations of\r\nRemusat, Pauthier, Julien, Legge, Plath, Faber, Eitel, and others, will\r\nhesitate to dismiss as erroneous the commonplace that it has been an\r\nunprogressive nation\" (_History of the Philosophy of History_, vol. i,\r\n1893, p. 88).\r\n\r\nChina was in fact progressive while the variety of stocks scattered over\r\nher vast area reacted on each other in virtue of variety of government\r\nand way of life:[158] it was when they were reduced under one imperial\r\ngovernment that unity of state-system, coupled with the exclusion of\r\nforeign contacts, imposed stagnation. But the stagnation was real, and\r\nother factors contributed to its continuance. The fecundity of the soil\r\nhas always maintained a redundant and therefore a poor and ignorant\r\npopulation--a condition which we have described as fatal to progress in\r\nculture if not counteracted, and which further favours the utter\r\nsubjection of women and the consequent arrest of half the sources of\r\nvariation. Mencius, speaking to the rulers of his day (3rd c. B.C.),\r\ndeclared with simple profundity that \"They are only men of education\r\nwho, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart.\r\nAs to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood it follows that\r\nthey will not have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart\r\nthere is nothing they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of\r\nmoral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license\" (Legge, _Life and\r\nWorks of Mencius_, 1875, p. 49). That lesson the rulers of China could\r\nnot learn, any more than their European congeners.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, therefore, accede to Professor Flint's further remark that\r\n\"The development and filiation of thought is scarcely less traceable in\r\nthe history and literature of China than of Greece\"--that is, if it be\r\nmeant that Chinese history down till our own day may be so compared with\r\nthe history of pagan Greece. The forces of fixation in China have been\r\ntoo strong to admit of this. The same factors have been at work in\r\nIndia, where, further, successive conquests, down till our own, had\r\nresults very similar to those of the barbarian conquest of the Roman\r\nEmpire. Yet at length, next door to China, in Japan, there has rapidly\r\ntaken place a national transformation that is not to be paralleled in\r\nthe world's history; and in India the Congress movement has developed in\r\na way that twenty years ago was thought impossible.[159] And while these\r\nthings are actually happening before the world's eyes, certain\r\nEnglishmen vociferate more loudly than ever the formula of the\r\n\"unchangeableness of Asia.\" A saner, though still a speculative view, is\r\nput forth by Mr. C.H. Pearson in his work on _National Character_. It\r\nwas anticipated by--among others--M. Philarete Chasles. See his\r\n_L'Angleterre politique_, edit. 1878, pp. 250, 251. And Walckenaer, over\r\na hundred years ago (_Essai_ cited, p. 368), predicted the future\r\ncivilisation of the vast plains of Tartary.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: On this may be consulted a suggestive paper by Mr. Lowes\r\nDickinson in the _Free Review_, April, 1894, and an instructive study by\r\nMr. T.

It is\r\nalways useful in economic science, despite protests to the contrary, to\r\nconsider bare processes irrespectively of ethical feeling; and the\r\nadvantage accrues similarly in the \"economic interpretation of\r\nhistory.\"[160] We have sufficiently for our purpose considered Roman\r\nhistory under the aspects of militarism and class egoism: it remains to\r\nconsider it as a series of economic phenomena.\r\n\r\n     This has been facilitated by many special studies. Gibbon covers\r\n     much of the ground in chapters 6, 14, 17, 18, 29, 35, 36 and 41;\r\n     and Professor Guglielmo Ferrero sheds new light at some points in\r\n     his great work, _The Greatness and Decline of Rome_ (Eng. trans. 5\r\n     vols. 1907-1911), though his economics at times calls for revision.\r\n     Cp.

Among many learned and instructive German treatises\r\n     may be noted the Preisschrift of R. Poehlmann, _Die Uebervoelkerung\r\n     der antiken Grossstaedte_, Leipzig, 1884. Special notice is due to\r\n     the recent work of W.R. Patterson, _The Nemesis of Nations_,\r\n     1907--a valuable study of slavery.\r\n\r\nAs we have first traced them, the Romans are a cluster of agricultural\r\nand pastoral tribes, chronically at war with their neighbours, and\r\ncentring round certain refuge-fortresses on one or two of the \"Seven\r\nHills.\" Whether before or after conquest by monarchic Etruscans, these\r\ntribes tended normally to fall into social grades in which relative\r\nwealth and power tended to go together. The first source of subsistence\r\nfor all was cattle-breeding and agriculture, and that of the richer was\r\nprimarily slave labour, a secondary source being usury. Slaves there\r\nwere in the earliest historic times. But from the earliest stages wealth\r\nwas in some degree procured through war, which yielded plunder in the\r\nform of cattle,[161] the principal species of riches in the ages before\r\nthe precious metals stood for the command of all forms of wealth. Thus\r\nthe rich tended to grow richer even in that primitive community, their\r\nriches enabling them specially to qualify themselves for war, so getting\r\nmore slaves and cattle, and to acquire fresh slave labour in time of\r\npeace, while in time of war the poor cultivator ran a special risk of\r\nbeing himself reduced to slavery at home, in that his farm was untilled,\r\nwhile that of the slave-owner went on as usual.[162] Long before the\r\nages described as decadent, the lapse of the poor into slavery was a\r\nfrequent event. \"The law of debt, framed by creditors, and for the\r\nprotection of creditors, was the most horrible that has ever been known\r\namong men.\"[163] When the poorer cultivator borrowed stock or seed from\r\nthe richer, he had first to pay a heavy interest; and when in bad years\r\nhe failed to meet that liability he could be at once sold up and finally\r\nenslaved with his family, so making competition all the harder for the\r\nother small cultivators. As against the plainly disintegrating action of\r\nsuch a system, however, wars of conquest and plunder became to some\r\nextent a means of popular salvation, the poorer having ultimately their\r\nnecessary share in the booty, and, as the State grew, in the conquered\r\nlands. Military expansion was thus an economic need.\r\n\r\nIn such an inland community, commerce could grow but slowly, the\r\nproducts being little adapted for distant exchange. The primitive\r\nprejudice of landholders against trade, common to Greece and Rome, left\r\nboth handicraft and commerce largely to aliens and pariahs.[164] The\r\ntraders, as apart from the agriculturists and vine-and olive-growers,\r\nwould as a rule be foreigners, \"non-citizens,\" having no political\r\nrights; and their calling was from the first held in low esteem by the\r\nricher natives, were it only because in comparison it was always apt to\r\ninvolve some overreaching of the agriculturist,[165] which as between\r\nman and man could be seen to be a bad thing by moralists who had no\r\nscruples about usury and enslavement for debt. And as the scope of the\r\nState increased from age to age, the patrician class found ready to its\r\nhand means of enrichment which yielded more return with much less\r\ntrouble than was involved in commerce. The prejudice against trade was\r\nno bar to brigandage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the first practical problem of all communities,\r\ntaxation, was intelligently faced by the Roman aristocracy from the\r\noutset. The payment of the _tributum_ or occasional special tax for\r\nmilitary purposes was a condition of the citizen franchise, and so far\r\nthe patricians were all burdened where the unenfranchised plebeians were\r\nnot. But this contribution \"was looked upon as a forced loan, and was\r\nrepaid when the times improved.\"[166] And there were other\r\ncompensations. The use of the public pastures (which seem at one time to\r\nhave been the sole source of the State's revenue[167]), and the\r\ncultivation of public land, were operations which could be so conducted\r\nas to pay the individual without paying the State. It is clear that\r\nfrauds in this connection were at all times common: the tithes and rents\r\ndue on the _ager publicus_ were evaded, and the land itself appropriated\r\nwherever possible by the more powerful, though still called public\r\nproperty.[168] \"The poorer plebeian, therefore, always strove to have\r\nconquered lands divided, and not kept as _ager publicus_; while the\r\nlandless men who got allotments at a distance were inclined to regard\r\ntheir migration as an almost equal grievance. If the rich men, they\r\nargued, had not monopolised the public pastures with their herds, and\r\ntreated the lands which they leased at a nominal rental as their own,\r\nthere would have been enough land at home to divide among those who had\r\nbeen ruined while serving their country in arms.\"[169]\r\n\r\nBut as the sphere of conquest widened, another economic phase\r\nsupervened. Where newly conquered territory was too distant to tempt any\r\nsave the poorest citizens, or to be directly utilised by the rich, it\r\ncould still be made _ager publicus_ and rented to its own inhabitants;\r\nand the collection of this and other exactions from subject provinces\r\ngradually grew to be a main source of Roman wealth. For the mere\r\ncattle-looting of the early days there was substituted the systematic\r\nextortion of tribute. \"In antiquity conquest meant essentially the power\r\nto impose a tribute upon the conquered\";[170] and \"until the time of\r\nAugustus the Romans had maintained their armies by seizing and\r\nsquandering the accumulated [bullion] capital hoarded by all the nations\r\nof the world.\"[171] Meanwhile the upper classes were directly or\r\nindirectly supported by the annual tribute which from the time of the\r\nconquest of Greece was drawn solely from the provinces. Paulus Emilius\r\nbrought from the sack of Hellas so enormous a treasure in bullion, as\r\nwell as in objects of art, that the exaction of the _tributum_ from\r\nRoman citizens, however rich, was felt to have become irrational; and\r\nhenceforth, until Augustus re-imposed taxation to pay his troops, Italy\r\nsponged undisguisedly on the rest of the Empire.[172] Caesar's\r\nexpeditions were simply quests for plunder and revenue; and the reason\r\nfor his speedy retreat from Britain, for which there have been framed so\r\nmany superfluous explanations, is plainly given in the letter of Cicero\r\nin which he tells of the news sent him from Britain by his brother--\"no\r\nhope of plunder.\"[173] But the supreme need was a regular annual\r\ntribute, preferably in bullion, but welcome as corn. On the one hand the\r\nexacted revenue supported the military and the bureaucracy; on the other\r\nhand, the business of collecting taxes and tribute was farmed out in the\r\nhands of companies of _publicani_, mainly formed of the so-called\r\nknights, the _equites_ of the early days; in whose hands rich senators,\r\nin defiance of legal prohibition, placed capital sums for\r\ninvestment,[174] as they had previously used foreigners, who were free\r\nto take usury where a Roman was not. Of such money-makers Gallia\r\nProvincia was already full in the days of Cicero.[175] Roman\r\nadministration was thus a matter of financially exploiting the Empire in\r\nthe interest of the Roman moneyed classes;[176] and the ruthless skill\r\nwith which the possibilities of the situation were developed is perhaps\r\neven now not fully realised. The Roman financier could secure a tribute\r\nupon tribute by lending to a subject city or State the money demanded of\r\nit by the government, and charge as much interest on the loan as the\r\nborrowers could well pay. We know that the notoriously conscientious\r\nBrutus, of sacred memory, thus lent, or backed a friend who lent, money\r\nto tribute-payers at 48 per cent., or at least demanded 48 per cent. on\r\nhis loans, and sought to use the power of the executive to extort the\r\nusury.[177]\r\n\r\nAll this, we are to remember, went on without any furtherance of total\r\ndomestic wealth-production. When corn-growing fell off, irrecoverably\r\ndepressed by the unearned import from the richer soils of tributary\r\nprovinces, there was a transference, partly economic, partly luxurious,\r\nof agricultural labour to vine-and olive-culture, and a wholesale\r\nturning of arable land to pasture. Some export of wine and olives\r\nfollowed, though the rich Romans tended to drink the wines of Greece.\r\nBut Italy had ceased to be self-supporting. The produce she imported was\r\nfar in excess of her power of export;[178] so that in sheer\r\nfactitiousness the revenue of Rome is without parallel in history.\r\nModern England, which has grown rich by burning up its coal in\r\nmanufacture or selling it outright, but in the process has acquired a\r\nshare in the national and municipal debts of all other countries--England\r\nis stable in comparison. While it lasts, the coal educes manufactures,\r\nwhich also earn imports and constitute loans. So with the recent\r\nexploitation of German iron; though in that case there has been much\r\nof sheer national waste in the wholesale export of iron at \"dumping\"\r\nprices in times of trade depression. But the history of Rome\r\nwas a progressive paralysis of Italian production; and the one way in\r\nwhich the administration can be said to have counteracted the\r\nprocess--as apart from the spontaneous resort to vine-and olive-culture\r\nand to slave manufactures--was by forcing more-or-less unprofitable\r\nmining for gold and silver wherever any could be got, thus giving what\r\nstimulus can be given to demand by the mere placing of fresh bullion on\r\nthe market. Roman civilisation was thus irrevocably directed to an\r\nillusory end, with inevitably fatal results. Bullion had come to\r\nstandfor public wealth, and wars were made for mines as well as for\r\ntribute, Spain in particular being prized for her mining resources. As a\r\nnecessary sequence, therefore, copper money was ousted by silver (B.C.\r\n269), and silver finally, after a long transition period, by gold, about\r\nthe time of Severus.[179] The silver had been repeatedly debased when\r\nthe treasury was in difficulties;[180] and in the later days of the\r\nEmpire it seems to have been base beyond all historic parallel,[181]\r\nthough a large revenue was extorted till the end. Between revenue and\r\ntax-farming profits and the yield of the mines, the Roman moneyed class\r\nmust indeed have spent a good deal, so long as the tributaries were not\r\nexhausted. But their economic demand was mainly for--(_a_) foods,\r\nspices, wines, cloths, gems, marbles, and wares produced by the more\r\nprosperous provinces; (_b_) expensive forms of food, fish, and fowl,\r\nraised chiefly on the estates run by their own class; (_c_) some wares\r\nof home production; and (_d_) _services_[182] from artists, architects,\r\nmaster craftsmen, slaves, mimes, parasites, and meretrices, whose\r\neconomic demand in turn would as far as possible go in the same\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAs for the mass of the town people, slave or free, which ought on\r\ncommon-sense principles to have been employed either in industry or on\r\nthe land, it was by a series of hand-to-mouth measures on the part of\r\nthe government, and by the operation of ordinary self-interest on the\r\npart of the rich class, made age by age more unproductive industrially\r\nand more worthless politically. Despite such a reform as the Licinian\r\nlaw of 367 B.C.,[183] which for a time seems to have restored a yeoman\r\nclass to the State and greatly developed its fighting power, the forces\r\nof outside competition and of capitalism gradually ousted the yeomen\r\ncultivators all over Italy, leaving the land mainly in the hands of the\r\npatricians and financiers of the city, who exploited it either by slave\r\nlabour or by grinding down the former cultivators as tenants. Even on\r\nthis footing, a certain amount of industry would be forced on the towns.\r\nBut not only was that also largely in the hands of slave-masters, with\r\nthe result that demotic life everywhere was kept on the lowest possible\r\nplane: the emperors gradually adopted on humane grounds a policy which\r\ndemoralised nearly all that was left of sound citizenship.\r\n\r\nAs of old, monarchy in the hands of the more rational and conscientious\r\nmen tended to seek for the mass of the people some protection as against\r\nthe upper class; and the taxes and customs laid on by Augustus, to the\r\ndisgust of the Senate, were an effort in this direction. But this was\r\nrather negative than positive protection, and the effort inevitably went\r\nfurther. In the last rally of what may be termed conscientious\r\naristocratic republicanism, such as it was, we find Caius Gracchus, as\r\ntribune, helping the plebs by causing grain to be sold at a half or a\r\nfourth of its market value--an expedient pathetically expressive of the\r\nhopeless distance that then lay between public spirit and social\r\nscience. Both of the Gracchi sought by violent legal measures to wring\r\nthe appropriated public lands from the hands of the rich, with the\r\ninevitable result of raising against themselves a host of powerful\r\nenemies. The needed change could not be so effected. But even if it had\r\nbeen, it could not have endured. The Greek advisers of Tiberius\r\nGracchus, Blossius of Cumae and Diophanes of Mitylene,[184] looked solely\r\nto redistribution, taking for granted the permanence of slavery, the\r\ndeadliest of all inequalities. The one way, if there were any, in which\r\nthe people could be saved was by a raising of their social status; and\r\nthat was impossible without an arrest of slavery and a cessation of\r\nextorted tribute. But no Roman thinker save the Gracchi and their\r\npredecessors and imitators seems ever to have dreamt of the former, and\r\nno one contemplated the latter remedy. Least of all were the Roman\r\nruling class likely to think of either; and though Tiberius Gracchus did\r\navowedly seek to substitute free for slave labour,[185] and wrought to\r\nthat end; and though Caius Gracchus did in his time of power employ a\r\nlarge amount of free labour on public works, one such effort counted for\r\nnothing against the normal attitude of the patriciate. In order to fight\r\nthe Senate he had to conciliate the _publicani_ and money-lenders as\r\nwell as the populace, and the reforms of the two brothers came to\r\nnothing.[186]\r\n\r\nThere is no record that in the contracts between the treasury and the\r\ncompanies of _publicani_ any stipulation was ever made as to their\r\nemploying free labour, or in any way considering the special needs of\r\nthe populations among whom they acted.[187] Thus a mere cheapening of\r\nbread could do nothing to aid free labour as against capitalism using\r\nslaves. On the contrary, such aids would tend irresistibly to multiply\r\nthe host of idlers and broken men who flocked to Rome from all its\r\nprovinces, on the trail of the plunder. Industrial life in Rome was for\r\nmost of them impossible, even were they that way inclined;[188] and the\r\nunceasing inward flow would have been a constant source of public danger\r\nhad the multitude not been somehow pacified. The method of free or\r\nsubsidised distribution of grain,[189] however, was so easy a way of\r\nkeeping Rome quiet, in the period of rapidly spreading conquest and\r\nmounting tribute, that in spite of the resistance of the moneyed\r\nclasses[190] it was adhered to. Sulla naturally checked the practice,\r\nbut still it was revived; and Caesar, after his triumph in Africa, found\r\nthe incredible number of 320,000 citizens in receipt of regular doles of\r\ncheapened or gratis corn. He in turn, though he had been concerned in\r\nextending it,[191] took strong measures to check the corrosion, reducing\r\nthe roll to 150,000;[192] but even that was in effect a confession that\r\nthe problem was past solution by the policy, so energetically followed\r\nby him, of re-colonising in Italy, Corinth, Carthage, Spain, and Gaul.\r\nAnd if Caesar sought to limit the gifts of bread, he seems to have\r\noutgone his predecessors in his provision of the other element in the\r\npopular ideal--the circus; his shows being bloodier as well as vaster\r\nthan those of earlier days.[193] A public thus treated to sport must\r\nneeds have cheap food as well.\r\n\r\nOf this policy, the economic result was to carry still further the\r\ndepression of Italian agriculture. The corn supplied at low rates or\r\ngiven away by the administration was of course bought or taken in the\r\ncheapest markets--those of Sardinia and Sicily, Egypt, Africa, and\r\nGaul--and importation once begun would be carried to the utmost lengths\r\nof commercialism. Italian farms, especially those at a distance from\r\nthe capital,[194] could not compete with the provinces save by still\r\nfurther substituting large slave-tilled farms for small holdings, and\r\ngrinding still harder the face of the slave. When finally Augustus,[195]\r\ndefinitely establishing the system of lowered prices and doles,\r\nsubsidised the trade in the produce of conquered Egypt to feed his\r\npopulace, and thus still further promoted the importation of the\r\ncheapest foreign grain, the agriculture of a large part of Italy, and\r\neven of parts of some provinces, was practically destroyed.\r\n\r\n     It has been argued by M'Culloch (_Treatises and Essays: History of\r\n     Commerce_, 2nd ed. p. 287, _note_) that it is impossible that the\r\n     mere importation of the corn required to feed the populace--say a\r\n     million quarters or more--could have ruined the agriculture of\r\n     Italy. This expresses a misconception of what took place. The doles\r\n     were not universal, and the emperors naturally preferred to limit\r\n     themselves as far as possible to paying premiums for the\r\n     importation and cheap sale of corn. (Cp. Suetonius, _Claudius_, c.\r\n     19, and the Digest, iii, 4, 1; xiv, i, 1, 20; xlvii, ix, 3, 8; l,\r\n     v, 3, etc.) All of the conquered provinces, practically, had to pay\r\n     a tithe of their produce; and where corn was specially cheap it\r\n     would be likely to come to Rome in that form. (Cp. Dureau de la\r\n     Malle, _Econ. polit. des Romains_, ii, 424 _sq._) Many of the\r\n     patrician families, besides, owned great estates in Africa, and\r\n     they would receive their revenues in produce. Egyptian, Sardinian,\r\n     Sicilian, and African corn could thus easily undersell Italian for\r\n     ordinary consumption. For the rest, the produce of Egypt would be a\r\n     means of special revenue to the emperor. Cp. M'Culloch's own\r\n     statement, p. 291.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Ferrero (_Greatness and Decline of Rome_, Eng. trans. ii,\r\n     App. A) has independently (but in agreement with Weber and\r\n     Salvioli) carried M'Culloch's thesis further, and has opposed the\r\n     view that the \"competition\" of Sicilian and African wheat \"was the\r\n     cause of the agricultural depression from which Italy began to\r\n     suffer in 150 B.C.\" His own theory is the singular one that the\r\n     \"depression\" was caused by \"the increased cost of living\" arising\r\n     out of luxurious habits! This untenable and indeed unintelligible\r\n     conclusion he ostensibly reaches by a series of arguments that are\r\n     alternately incoherent and rotatory, of propositions some of which\r\n     are rebutted by himself, and of assumptions that are plainly\r\n     astray. The dispute may be condensed thus:--\r\n\r\n     (1) \"In antiquity,\" the Professor begins, \"each district consumed\r\n     its own wheat\"; yet he goes on to mention that in the fifth and\r\n     fourth centuries B.C. Attica was \"obliged to import, even in good\r\n     seasons, between 12,000,000 and 15,000,000 bushels.\" This\r\n     contradiction he appears to think is saved by the addendum that\r\n     \"the amount in question is a very small one, compared with the\r\n     figures of modern commerce.\" Naturally it is, Athens being a small\r\n     State compared with those of to-day. But the contradiction stands\r\n     unresolved. And it follows that larger towns, not placed in\r\n     fruitful \"districts,\" would have proportionally larger imports.\r\n\r\n     (2) \"Moreover,\" writes the Professor, \"while the industrial\r\n     countries of to-day seek so far as possible to check the import of\r\n     cereals by protective duties, Athens used every expedient of war\r\n     and diplomacy to render the supply of imported corn both regular\r\n     and abundant.\" It is startling to find a professor of history, a\r\n     sociological historian, unaware that Britain, Belgium, and Holland\r\n     have no import duties on corn. (The most exclusive State in that\r\n     matter is Portugal, which, with no pretensions to be an industrial\r\n     State, prohibits corn imports altogether.)\r\n\r\n     (3) More plausibly, Prof. Ferrero argues that the policy of Athens\r\n     proves that \"corn was not easily transported for sale beyond the\r\n     local market.\" But the efforts of the Athenians \"to obtain the\r\n     mastery of the Black Sea, and especially of the Bosphorus, _in\r\n     order to capture the corn trade for themselves_, or to entrust it,\r\n     on their own conditions, to whom they pleased,\" proves that the\r\n     difficulties of transport were mainly those set up by hostile\r\n     States or pirates, and that--as the Professor admits--the fertile\r\n     Crimea, with its sparse population, yielded an easy surplus for\r\n     export.\r\n\r\n     (4) All this, however, is only partially relevant to the question\r\n     of the supplies of Rome from Sicily, Sardinia, Africa, and Spain in\r\n     the second century B.C. Did such supplies come, or did they not? As\r\n     the Professor admits, they were \"vital\" to the Roman military\r\n     policy; and \"she had immense granaries at her disposal whenever she\r\n     required them.\" But such sources of supply meant a certain large\r\n     normal production; and this would enter Italy in time of peace. If\r\n     it was purposely maintained in view of the needs of war-time, so\r\n     much the more surely would it undersell Italian wheat, raised on a\r\n     less fruitful soil. In no other way could Sicily and Africa yield\r\n     either annual tribute to Rome or rents to Roman owners of land in\r\n     those countries. The first effect of the importation would be to\r\n     add the pressure of lowered prices to the discouragement already\r\n     offered to private cultivators by the inducements of loot in war,\r\n     fleecings in administration of newly conquered countries, commerce,\r\n     and usury. Of this discouragement the sequel would be the attempt\r\n     to run by slave labour the large estates in which the old farms\r\n     were merged. But slave labour is apt to be bad labour, and\r\n     agriculture could not thereby be restored.\r\n\r\n     (5) The thesis that agriculture was _depressed_ by high cost of\r\n     living (= high prices for agricultural products) it is not easy to\r\n     treat with seriousness. The simple fact is that sea-carriage to\r\n     Rome from Sicily, Spain, and Africa must have been cheaper than\r\n     land carriage from most parts of Italy to the capital. As Prof.\r\n     Ferrero notes, food prices in the valley of the Po were very\r\n     low--obviously because cost of carriage either to Rome or to the\r\n     southern seaports deterred export.\r\n\r\n     (6) Prof. Ferrero's fallacy is capped by his proposition that \"the\r\n     economic crisis from which Italy has been suffering during the last\r\n     twenty years is due to the increased cost of living occasioned by\r\n     the introduction, from 1848 onwards, of the industrial civilisation\r\n     of England and France into an old agricultural society.\" The\r\n     confusion here defies analysis. Suffice it to say that the high\r\n     cost of living in modern Italy is due to tariffs and high taxation.\r\n     Sugar is dear there not because Italians consume it\r\n     luxuriously--they do not and cannot--but because a particularly\r\n     unintelligent policy of Protection causes them to pay for beetroot\r\n     sugar produced in a country ill-suited to the growth of beetroot.\r\n     Living costs more in Germany, France, and the United States than in\r\n     Britain, not because those countries have only recently become\r\n     \"luxurious,\" but because they heavily tax imports. Costs of living\r\n     in Rome certainly rose as Romans raised their standards of\r\n     consumption; but their importation of corn from conquered provinces\r\n     kept food prices lower than they would have been otherwise; and\r\n     Italian agriculture was largely abandoned in favour of easier ways\r\n     of making money.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Ferrero supplies a partial confutation of his economic theory\r\n     by his own account (i, 311) of how, in the time of Pompey, \"once\r\n     more the precious metals were _cheap and abundant_\" after a time of\r\n     scarcity, and the decadent slave system of agriculture was\r\n     superseded by new forms of production. (See above, p. 79, _note_.)\r\n     But abundant bullion means high prices for produce, which the\r\n     Professor has declared to be a cause of depression! As to the new\r\n     production, the process certainly cannot have taken place with the\r\n     rapidity which his description suggests. \"The hideous\r\n     slave-shelters or compounds [_ergastula_], with their gangs of\r\n     forced labourers, vanished from the scene, together with the huge\r\n     desolate tracts of pasture where they had spent their days [?], to\r\n     be replaced by vineyards, olive-groves, and orchards, now planted\r\n     in all parts of the peninsula, ... estates on which the new slave\r\n     immigrants contentedly cultivated the vine or the olive, or bred\r\n     animals for the stable or transport, under the direction of a Greek\r\n     or Oriental bailiff; ... pleasant cottages of landlords, who farmed\r\n     their own holdings with the help of a few slaves.\" All this cannot\r\n     have happened in the time of Pompey. But in any case, inasmuch as\r\n     bullion was rife, prices in general must have been high, yet\r\n     without \"depression\"; and the new demand for wine and olives, in\r\n     the terms of the case, made their cultivation remunerative. But\r\n     \"huge pastures\" cannot have been \"replaced\" by vineyards and\r\n     olive-groves; and Italian agriculture did not in imperial times\r\n     become again the thing it had been.\r\n\r\nIt was not that, as Pliny put it in the perpetually quoted phrase,[196]\r\nthe _latifundia_, the great estates, had ruined Italy and began to ruin\r\nthe provinces; it was that, first, the fertile conquered provinces,\r\nnotably Sicily, undersold Italy; whereafter the economically advantaged\r\ncompetition of Egypt, as imperially exploited, and of the African\r\nprovinces, undersold the produce of most of the other regions, and would\r\nhave done so equally had their agriculture remained in the hands of\r\nsmall farmers. The _latifundia_ were themselves effects of the policy of\r\nconquest and annexation. The theory that \"those large pastoral estates,\r\nand that slave-cultivation, which had so powerful and so deleterious an\r\ninfluence over Italian husbandry and population, may be principally\r\nascribed to the confiscations and the military colonies of Sulla and his\r\nsuccessors,\" is clearly wide of the mark.\r\n\r\n     So M'Culloch, _Treatises and Essays: Colonial System of the\r\n     Ancients_, p. 426. No doubt agriculture went rapidly from bad to\r\n     worse in the convulsions of Sulla's rule, when whole territories\r\n     passed into the hands of his partisans. These would be bent on the\r\n     use of slave labour, and would take to the forms of production\r\n     which gave them the best money return. On the other hand, in an age\r\n     of chronic confiscation of whole areas, steady men were not likely\r\n     to be attracted to the land. See Prof. Pelham's _Outlines_, p. 213;\r\n     Dureau de la Malle, _Econ. polit. des Romains_, vol. ii, liv. iii,\r\n     ch. 22.\r\n\r\nLarge capitalistic estates were beginning to arise in Attica in the time\r\nof Solon, and were normal in the time of Xenophon.[197] In Carthage,\r\nwhere they likewise arose in due economic course, they do not seem to\r\nhave hurt agriculture, though worked by slave labour;[198] and, on the\r\nother hand, the Roman military colonies were an attempt, albeit vain, to\r\nrestore a free farming population. In Italy the disease was older than\r\nSulla. When Tiberius Gracchus was passing through Etruria on his way\r\nfrom Spain, fifty years before the rule of Sulla, he saw no free\r\nlabourers, but only slaves in chains.[199] The true account of the\r\nmatter is this: that if Italy had not conquered Sicily, North Africa,\r\nEgypt, and the other fertile provinces, their competition could not have\r\ncome to pass as it did; for any imports in that case would have had to\r\nbe paid for by exports, and Italy had nothing adequate to export. It was\r\nthe power to exact tribute, or otherwise the appropriation of conquered\r\nterritory as estates by the nobles,[200] that upset the economic\r\nbalance. Not merely in order to support the policy of cheap or free\r\nfood--which was extended to other large Italian cities--but because corn\r\nwas the staple product of Sicily and Egypt and North Africa, the tribute\r\ncame in large measure in the form of foods; and in so far as it came in\r\nbullion, the coin had to be speedily re-exported to pay for further food\r\nand for the manufactures turned out by the provinces, and bought by the\r\nItalian rich. Save in so far as rich amateurs of agriculture went on\r\nfarming at small profit or at a loss,[201] Italy produced little beyond\r\nolives and wine and cattle,[202] and ordinary wares for home\r\nconsumption. Industrially considered, the society of the whole peninsula\r\nwas thus finally a mere shell, doing its exchanges mainly in virtue of\r\nthe annual income it extorted from provincial labour, and growing more\r\nand more worthless in point of character as its vital basis grew more\r\nand more strictly factitious. It would be accurate to say of the Empire,\r\nas represented by part of Italy and the capital, that it was a vast\r\neconomic simulacrum. The paternal policy of the emperors,[203] good and\r\nbad, wrought to pretty much the same kind of result as the egoism of the\r\nupper classes had done; and though their popular measures must have\r\nexasperated the Senate, that body had in general to tolerate their\r\nwell-meaning deeds as it did their crimes.[204]\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps better understand the case by supposing a certain\r\neconomic development to take place in England in the distant future. At\r\npresent we remain, as we are likely long to remain, economically\r\nadvantaged or beneficed for manufacture by our coalfields, which are\r\nunequalled in Europe, though Germany, through the invention which made\r\nher phosphoric iron workable, has a larger store of the chief industrial\r\nmetal. In return for our coal and manufactures and our shipping\r\nservices, we import foods and goods that otherwise we could not pay for;\r\nand the additional revenue from British investments in foreign debts and\r\nenterprises further swells the food and raw material import, thus\r\ndepressing to a considerable extent _our_ agriculture under a system of\r\nlarge farms. When in the course of centuries the coalfields are\r\nexhausted, unless it should be found that the winds and tides can be\r\nmade to yield electric power cheaply enough, our manufacturing\r\npopulation will probably dwindle. Either the United States will\r\nsupersede us with their stores of coal, or--if, as may well be, their\r\nstores are already exhausted by a vaster exploitation--China may take\r\nthe lead. The chief advantage left us would be the skill and efficiency\r\nof our industrial population--an important but incalculable factor.[205]\r\nA \"return to the land,\" if not achieved beforehand, might in that case\r\nbe assumed to be inevitable; but should Australian, Indian, and North\r\nand South American wheat-production continue (as it may or may not) to\r\nhave the same relative advantages of soil, our remaining city\r\npopulations would continue to buy foreign corn; and the land might still\r\nbe largely turned to pasture. That remaining city population, roughly\r\nspeaking, would in the terms of the case consist of (_a_) those persons\r\ndrawing incomes from foreign investments; (_b_) those workmen,\r\ntradesmen, and professional people who could still be successfully\r\nemployed in manufactures, or whom the interest-drawing classes employed\r\nto do their necessary home-work, as the Romans perforce employed to the\r\nlast many workmen and doctors and scribes, slave or free; (_c_) those\r\nwho might earn incomes by seafaring; and (_d_) the official\r\nclass--necessarily reduced, like every other. Until the incomes from\r\nforeign investments had in some measure disappeared, the country could\r\nnot gravitate down to an economically stable recommencement in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nWe need not consider curiously whether things would or will happen in\r\nexactly this way: the actual presumption is that before coal is\r\nexhausted the whole social structure will be modified; and it is\r\nconceivable that the idle class may have been eliminated. But we are\r\nsupposing a less progressive evolution for illustration's sake. Suffice\r\nit that such a development would be in a measure economically analogous\r\nto what took place in ancient Rome. If the upper-class population of\r\nsuch a hypothetical future in England, instead of receiving only\r\ndividends from foreign stocks and pensions from the revenue of India,\r\nwere able to extort an absolute tribute from India and other dominions,\r\nthe parallel would be so much the closer. What held together the Roman\r\nEmpire so long was, on the one hand, the developed military and\r\njuridical organisation with its maintaining revenue, and on the other\r\nhand the absence of any competent antagonist. Could a Mithridates or an\r\nAlexander have arisen during the reign of one of the worse emperors, he\r\nmight more easily have overrun the Roman world than Rome did Carthage.\r\nAs it was, all the civilised parts of the Empire shared its political\r\nanaemia; and indeed the comparative comfort of the Roman peace, with all\r\nits burden of taxation, was in many of the provinces a sufficient though\r\nprecarious ground for not returning to the old life of chronic warfare,\r\nat least for men who had lost the spirit of reasoned political\r\nself-assertion.\r\n\r\nUnder good emperors, the system worked imposingly enough; and Mommsen,\r\nechoing Gibbon, not unwarrantably bids us ask ourselves whether the\r\nsouth of Europe has ever since been better governed than it was under\r\nthe Antonines.[206] The purely piratical plunder carried on by governors\r\nunder the Republic was now, no doubt, in large measure restricted. But,\r\nto say nothing of the state of character and intellect, the economic\r\nevisceration was proceeding steadily alike under good emperors and bad,\r\nand the Stoic jurists did but frame good laws for a worm-eaten society.\r\nSo long as the seat of empire remained at Rome, drawing the tribute\r\nthither, the imperial system would give an air of solidity to Italian\r\nlife; but when the Roman population itself grew cosmopolitanised in all\r\nits classes, taking in all the races of the Empire, the provinces were\r\nin the terms of the case as Roman as the capital; and there was no\r\nspecial reason, save the principle of concentration, why the later\r\nemperors should reside there. Where of old the provincial governors had\r\nextorted from their subjects fortunes for themselves, to be spent in\r\nRome like the public tribute, they would now tend to act as permanent\r\ndwellers in their districts.[207] Once the palace was set up elsewhere,\r\nthe accessories of administration inevitably followed; and the\r\ntransference of official and other population would partly balance the\r\nrestriction of food supply caused by the deflection of Egyptian\r\ncorn-tribute to Constantinople--a loss that had to be made good by a\r\ndrain on Libya and Carthage.[208] But when under Valentinian and Valens\r\nthe Empire came to be definitely divided, the western section, whose\r\nmain source of revenue was the African province, speedily fell into\r\nfinancial straits. Valentinian had on his hands in the ten years of his\r\nreign three costly wars--one to recover Britain, one to repel the\r\nAlemanni from Gaul, one to recover Africa from Firmus; and it was\r\napparently the drain on revenue thus set up, aggravated by an African\r\nfamine,[209] that drove Gratian on his accession to the step of\r\nconfiscating the revenues of the pagan cults.[210] So great was the\r\nState's need that even the pagan Eugenius could not restore the pagan\r\nrevenues. Thenceforth the financial decay headed the military; and we\r\nshall perhaps not be wrong in saying that the growth of medieval Italy,\r\nthe new and better-rooted life which was to make possible the\r\nRenaissance, obscurely began when Italy, stripped of Gaul and Spain and\r\nAfrica, and cut off from the East, which held Egypt, was deprived of its\r\nunearned income, and the populace had in part to turn for fresh life to\r\nagriculture and industry. The flight of the propertied families at each\r\nsuccessive sack of Rome by Goth and Vandal must have left freedom to\r\nmany, and room for new enterprise to the more capable, though in some\r\ndistricts there seems to have been absolute depopulation. And while\r\nItaly thus fell upon a wholesomer poverty,[211] the provinces would be\r\nless impoverished.\r\n\r\nSome of the ruin, indeed, has not been remedied to this day. Part of the\r\ncurse of conquest was the extension of the malarious area of Italian\r\nsoil, always considerable. The three temples to the Goddess Fever in\r\nRome were the recognition of a standing scourge, made active by every\r\noverflow of the Tiber; and pestilent areas were common throughout the\r\nland. But when the great plain of Latium was well peopled, the feverous\r\narea was in constant process of reduction by agriculture and drainage;\r\nand the inhabitants had become in large part immune to infection.[212]\r\nIn the early, the \"Social\" and the later civil wars it was devastated\r\nand depopulated to such an extent that Pliny[213] could enumerate\r\nfifty-three utterly eliminated stocks or \"peoples,\" and could cite the\r\nrecord of thirty-three towns which had stood where now were the Pontine\r\nmarshes.[214] As early as 340 B.C. the land round Rome was counted\r\nunhealthy, so that veterans were loth to settle on it;[215] but\r\npopulation went back instead of forward. It is thus true that the\r\nmalaria of the Campagna and other districts was an ancient trouble;[216]\r\nbut it was the perpetual march of conquest, for ever sending forth to\r\nmore attractive soils the stocks who might have re-peopled and recovered\r\nit, that made that and so much more of Italy fixedly pestilential down\r\nto modern times. Thus the paralysis of Italian production by conquest\r\nwas a twofold process, direct and indirect.\r\n\r\nIn ancient as in later times, doubtless, attempts were made to bring\r\nback to human habitation the stricken deserts that stained Italy like a\r\nleprosy. Thus Caesar sought early to repeople Campania from the idle\r\npopulace of Rome.[217] But to maintain steady cultivation in unhealthy\r\nregions there was needed an immune stock, and that was reproducible only\r\nby the old way of savage, self-preserving persistence on the part of\r\nhardy and primitive rustics working their own land. The new imported\r\nstocks, slave or free, wilted away before the scourge of fever; and the\r\n\"principle of population,\" weakened in the spring, failed to surmount\r\nthe resistance of Nature. Under the early Empire the labour needed for\r\nthe culture of the Campagna had to be brought in annually from distant\r\ndistricts; and when the invading Goths in the fifth century devastated\r\nthe whole area there was no energy left to recover it.\r\n\r\n     [The theories once current as to ancient knowledge of prophylactics\r\n     in the shape of perfumes and the habitual use of woollen clothing\r\n     may be dismissed as fanciful. The rational conclusion is that the\r\n     early races developed a relative immunity, which was possessed\r\n     neither by the eastern stocks imported in the period of conquest\r\n     nor by the later invading Teutons. It is noteworthy, however, that\r\n     at all times the dwellers in the tainted areas learned something of\r\n     the necessary hygiene. See Dureau de la Malle, as cited. His\r\n     investigation is interesting as showing how, in the early decades\r\n     of the nineteenth century, long before Pasteur, biology had reached\r\n     the perception that fevers come of an organic infection. It was\r\n     doubtless such knowledge that led the Romans to burn their dead.]\r\n\r\nThere remains the question, What is the precise economic statement of\r\nthe final collapse? It is easy to figure that in terms of _(a)_\r\nincreasing barbarian enterprise, stimulated by the personal experience\r\nof the many barbarians who served the Empire, and of _(b)_ increasing\r\nmoral weakness on the part of the whole administrative system. And\r\ndoubtless this change in the balance of military energy was decisive.\r\nWhen utter weaklings sat by heredity in the imperial chair, at best\r\ncontemptuously tolerated by their alien officers, the end was\r\nnecessarily near. The most incurable disease of empire was just empire;\r\nages of parasitism had made the Roman ruling class incapable of\r\nenergetic action; and the autocracy had long withheld from citizens the\r\nuse of arms. But the long subsistence of the Eastern Empire as\r\ncontrasted with the Western proves that not only had the barbarians an\r\neasier task against Italy in terms of its easiness of invasion, but the\r\ndefence was there relatively weaker in terms of lack of resources. This\r\nlack has been wholly or partly explained by quite a number of\r\nwriters[218] as a result of a failure in the whole supply of the\r\nprecious metals--a proposition which may be understood of either a\r\nfalling-off in the yield of the mines or a general withdrawal of bullion\r\nfrom the Empire. It is difficult to see how either explanation can\r\nstand. There was already an immense amount of bullion in the Empire, and\r\na general withdrawal could take place only by way of export to the\r\nbarbarian east in return for commodities.[219] But the eastern provinces\r\nof the Empire were still in themselves abundantly productive, and after\r\nthe fall of Rome they continued to exhibit industrial solvency. No doubt\r\nthe plunder of Rome by Alaric (409-10) greatly crippled the west, and\r\nthe loss of Gaul and Spain was worse; but while the Empire retained\r\nAfrica it had a source of real revenue. The beginning of the end, or\r\nrather the virtual end, came with the conquest of the African province\r\nby the Vandals (430-40). In 455 came the sack of Rome by the Vandals,\r\nwhereafter there remains only a shadow of the Roman Empire, till\r\nOdoaker, dismissing Augustulus, makes himself king of Italy.\r\n\r\nAs for the falling-off in the yield of the Spanish mines, to which some\r\nwriters seem to attribute the whole collapse, it could only mean that\r\nthe Roman Government at length realised what had been as true before\r\nand has been as true since, that _all_ gold-mining, save in the case of\r\nthe richest and easiest mines, separately considered, or of groups of\r\nmines which have been acquired at less cost than went to find and open\r\nthem, is carried on at a loss as against the standing competition of the\r\ngreat mass of precious metal above-ground at any moment, the output of\r\nunknown barbarian toil and infinite slave labour, begun long before the\r\nage of written history.[220] When it was reluctantly realised that the\r\ncost of working either the gold or the silver mines was greater to the\r\nState than their product,[221] they would be abandoned; though under a\r\nfree government private speculators would have been found ready to risk\r\nmore money in reopening them immediately. As a matter of fact, the\r\nSpanish mines were actually worked by the Saracens in the Middle Ages,\r\nand have been since. The Romans had made the natural blunder of greed in\r\ntaking all gold and silver mines into the hands of the State,[222] where\r\nspeculative private enterprise would have gone on working them at a\r\nloss, and so adding--vainly enough--to the total bullion in circulation,\r\non which the State could levy its taxes. Even as it was, when they were\r\nlosing nothing, but rather checking loss, by abandoning the mines, a\r\nfalling-off in revenue from one source could have been made good by\r\ntaxation if the fiscal system had remained unimpaired, and if the former\r\nincome of Italy had not been affected by other causes than a stoppage of\r\nmining output.\r\n\r\nIf the mere cessation of public gold-mining were the cause of a general\r\nweakening of the imperial power, and by consequence the cause of the\r\ncollapse in Italy, it ought equally to have affected the Eastern Empire,\r\nwhich we know to have possessed a normal sufficiency of bullion all\r\nthrough the Dark and Middle Ages, though it had no mines left.[223] The\r\nfact is that, when Valentinian and Valens divided the Empire between\r\nthem, the former chose the western half because he shared the delusion\r\nthat the Spanish mines were a greater source of real wealth than the\r\nfruitful provinces of the east. Those could always procure the bullion\r\nthey required, because they had produce to exchange for it. Gold mines\r\neven of average fertility could have availed no more; and if Italy had\r\nremained agriculturally productive she could have sustained herself\r\nwithout any mines.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Cunningham, in his study of the economic conditions of the\r\n     declining Empire, appears to lay undue stress on the factor of\r\n     scarcity of bullion, and does not duly recognise the difference of\r\n     progression between the case of Italy and that of the east. \"The\r\n     Roman Empire,\" he writes (p. 187, _note_), lacked both treasure and\r\n     capital, \"and _it perished_.\" When? The eastern seat of the Empire\r\n     survived the western by a thousand years. \"It seems highly\r\n     improbable,\" he argues again (p. 185), \"that the drain of silver to\r\n     the east, which continued during the Middle Ages, was suspended at\r\n     any period of the history of the Empire.\" But such a drain (which\r\n     means a depletion) cannot go on for twelve hundred years; and it\r\n     was certainly not a drain of silver to the east that ruined the\r\n     Byzantine Empire. Finlay's dictum (i, 52) that the debasement of\r\n     the currency between Caracalla and Gallienus \"annihilated a great\r\n     part of the trading capital in the Roman Empire and rendered it\r\n     impossible to carry on commercial transactions, not only with\r\n     foreign countries but even with distant provinces,\" is another\r\n     erroneous theorem.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that the Italian collapse occurred as it did because,\r\nafter the fall of the three great possessions, Gaul, Spain, and Africa,\r\nthere was left only the central State, made impotent by long parasitism\r\nto meet the growing barbarian pressure. Italy in the transition period\r\ncan have yielded very little revenue, though Rome had for the barbarians\r\nplenty of hoarded plunder; and the country had long ceased to yield good\r\ntroops. Gaul itself had been monstrously taxed; and it must have been no\r\nless a prudent than a benevolent motive that led Julian to reduce to\r\nL2,000,000 the revenue of L7,000,000 extorted by Constantine and\r\nConstantius.[224] The greater the depression in the sources of income,\r\nand the greater the costs of the frontier wars, the harder became the\r\npressure of the fiscal system, till the burdens laid on the upper\r\ncitizens who formed the curia[225] put them out of all heart for\r\npatriotic action, and drove many to flight, to slavery, or the cloister.\r\nTowards the end, indeed, there was set up a rapid process of economic\r\nchange which substituted for slaves a class of serfs, _coloni_,\r\n_adscriptitii_, and so on, who though tied to the land paid a rent for\r\nit and could keep any surplus; but under this system agriculture was\r\nthus far no more a source of revenue than before. Latterly the very wine\r\nof Italy grew worthless, and its olives decayed;[226] so that in once\r\nfruitful Campania, \"the orchard of the south,\" Honorius in the year 395\r\nhad to strike from the fiscal registers, as worthless, more than three\r\nhundred thousand acres of land[227]--an eighth of the whole province.\r\nAfter the ruinous invasions of Rhadagast and Alaric, fresh remissions of\r\ntaxation had to be given, so that as the danger neared the defence\r\nweakened.[228] In the east, again, there was no impulse to succour the\r\nfalling west; and indeed there was not the ability. The fiscal power of\r\nthe Emperor was inelastic; his revenues, extorted by cruel pressure,\r\nneeded careful husbanding; his own world needed all his attention; and\r\nthe eastern upper class of clerics and officials were not the people to\r\nstrain themselves for the mere military retention of Britain or Gaul or\r\nItaly, as Rome would have done in the republican period, or as the\r\nemperors would have done before the period of decentralisation. For the\r\nrich agricultural provinces of Africa they did strive with success when\r\nBelisarius overthrew the Vandals; and in that age, when Italy had once\r\nmore become revenue-yielding through the revival of her agriculture, it\r\nwas worth the while of the east to reconquer Italy also; but the old\r\nspirit of resolute dominion and aggression was gone. Armies could still\r\nbe enrolled and generalled if there was pay for them; but the pay\r\nfailed, not because bullion was lacking, but because the will and power\r\nto supply and apply it in the old fashion was lacking. The new age,\r\nafter Theodosius, looked at these matters in a different light--the\r\nlight of commercial self-interest and Christian or eastern disregard for\r\nRoman tradition and prestige. The new religion, Christianity, was a\r\ndirect solvent of imperial patriotism in the old sense, transferring as\r\nit did the concern of serious men from this world to the next, and from\r\npolitical theory to theological. In Italy, besides, the priesthood could\r\ncount on making rather more docile Christians of the invaders than it\r\nhad done of the previous inhabitants; so that Christian Rome, once\r\noverrun, must needs remain so.\r\n\r\n     [Finlay (ed. cited i, 294) suggests that \"probably the knowledge\r\n     which the Emperor Justin and his cabinet must have possessed of the\r\n     impossibility of deriving any revenue from the agricultural\r\n     districts of Italy offers the simplest explanation of the\r\n     indifference manifested at Constantinople to the Lombard invasion.\"\r\n     But he had already noted (p. 236, _note_) that a great revival of\r\n     agriculture took place in the reign of Theodoric. Then it could\r\n     only be through the exhaustion of the subsequent wars that Italy\r\n     was incapable of yielding a revenue. The true explanation of\r\n     Justin's inaction is probably not indifference but impotence, the\r\n     Empire's resources being then drained.\r\n\r\n     After the invasion of the Lombards the clergy and Senate of Rome\r\n     had to send a large sum in bullion to induce the Emperor Maurice to\r\n     listen to their prayers for help. Still the help could not be\r\n     given, though, save in the case of the coast towns (see below, p.\r\n     188), tribute was paid to Byzantium till the final breach between\r\n     Rome and Leo the Iconoclast. (Gibbon, Bohn ed. v, 114.)\r\n\r\n     Guizot (_Histoire de la Civilisation en France_, 13e ed. i, 75, 76)\r\n     notes the fundamental difference in the attitude of the Church\r\n     under the old and eastern emperors and under the Teutonic rule.\r\n     Symonds (_Renaissance in Italy_, 2nd ed. i, 43) thinks this was a\r\n     result of Theodoric's not having made Rome his headquarters, and\r\n     his having treated it with special respect. But the clergy of Gaul\r\n     at once gained an ascendency over the Frankish kings, and the popes\r\n     would probably have done as well with resident emperors as with\r\n     absentees. Their great resource was that of playing one Christian\r\n     monarch against another--a plan not open to the patriarch of\r\n     Constantinople.]\r\n\r\nThat the Empire could still at a push raise armies and find for them\r\ngenerals who could beat back the barbarians was sufficiently shown in\r\nthe careers of Stilicho and Aetius and Belisarius; but the extreme\r\nparsimony with which Justinian supported his great commander in Italy is\r\nsome proof of the economic difficulty of keeping up, even in a period of\r\nprudent administration,[229] a paid force along the vast frontiers of\r\nwhat had been Hadrian's realm. Only as ruled by one central system,\r\ninspired by an ideal of European empire, and using the finance and force\r\nof the whole for the defence of any part, could that realm have been\r\npreserved; and when Diocletian, while holding mechanically by the ideal\r\nof empire, began the disintegration of its executive, he began the\r\nending of the ideal. The creation of an eastern capital was now\r\ninevitable; and when once the halving of the Empire had become a matter\r\nof course, the west, hollow at the core, was fated to fall. We should\r\nthus not be finally wrong in saying that \"the Roman idea\" died out\r\nbefore the Western Empire could fall; provided only that we recognise\r\nthe economic and other sociological causation of the process.\r\n\r\nIt remains to note, finally, that the process cannot possibly be\r\nexplained by the theory that the Eastern Empire was successfully unified\r\nby Christianity, and that the Western remained divided by reason of the\r\nobstinate adherence of the Roman aristocracy to Paganism. The framer of\r\nthis theory confutes it by affirming that in Greece \"the popular element\r\n... by its alliance with Christianity, infused into society the energy\r\nwhich saved the Eastern Empire,\" while admitting that in Italy also the\r\n\"great body of the [city] population\" had embraced Christianity. Surely\r\nthe popular Christian element ought to have saved Italy also if it were\r\nthe saving force. Italy was essentially Christian in the age of\r\nBelisarius: if there was any special element of disunion it was the\r\nmutual hatred of Arians and Athanasians and other sects, which had\r\nabundantly existed also in the east, where it finally furthered the\r\nSaracen conquest of the Asiatic provinces and Egypt,[230] but as\r\nregarded the central part of the Empire was periodically got rid of by\r\nthe suppression of all heresy.[231] Eastern unification, such as it was,\r\nhad thus been the work, not of \"Christianity,\" or of any sudden spirit\r\nof unity among the Greeks, but of the Imperial Government, which in the\r\nEast had sufficient command of, and needed for its own sake to use, the\r\nresources that we have seen lost to Italy.[232] As for the established\r\nreligion, it was the insoluble conflict of doctrine as to images that\r\nfinally, in the reign of Leo the Iconoclast, arrayed the Papacy against\r\nthe Christian Emperor, and completed the sunderance of Greek and Latin\r\nChristendom; while in the East the patriarch of Jerusalem became the\r\nminister of the Moslem conquerors in the seventh century, as did the\r\npatriarch of Constantinople in the fifteenth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: The phrase of Professor Thorold Rogers, whose application\r\nof the principle, however, does not carry us far.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Dr. Cunningham overlooks this form of gain-getting by\r\nwar, when he says that the early Romans had no direct profit from it\r\n(_Western Civilisation_, i, 154), but mentions it later (p. 157).

A world in which\r\naristocrats were finally wont to take an oath to hate and injure the\r\ndemos[233] was on no very hopeful economic footing, whatever its glory\r\nin literature and art. Nor did the most comprehensive mind of all the\r\nancient world see in slavery anything but an institution to be defended\r\nagainst ethical attack as a naturally right arrangement.[234] In view of\r\nall this, we may reasonably hold that even if there had been no\r\nMacedonian dominance and no Roman conquest, Greek civilisation would not\r\nhave gone on progressing indefinitely after the period which we now mark\r\nas its zenith--that the evil lot of the lower strata must in time have\r\ninfected the upper. What we have here briefly to consider, however, is\r\nthe actual economic course of affairs.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of such a generalisation, we may rank the Greek\r\ncommunities under two classes: (1) those whose incomes, down through the\r\nhistoric period, continued to come from land-owning, whether with slave\r\nor free labour, as Sparta; and (2) those which latterly flourished\r\nchiefly by commerce, whether with or without military domination, as\r\nAthens and Corinth. In both species alike, in all ages, though in\r\ndifferent degrees as regards both time and place, there were steep\r\ndivisions of lot between rich and poor, even among the free. Nowhere,\r\nnot even in early \"Lycurgean\" Sparta, was there any system aiming at the\r\nmethodical prevention of large estates, or the prevention of poverty,\r\nthough the primitive basis was one of military communism, and though\r\ncertain sumptuary laws and a common discipline were long maintained.\r\n\r\n     Grote's examination (pt. ii, ch. vi; ed. cited, ii, 308-30) of\r\n     Thirlwall's hypothesis (ch. viii; 1st ed. i, 301, 326) as to an\r\n     equal division of lands by Lycurgus, seems to prove that, as\r\n     regards rich and poor, the legendary legislator \"took no pains\r\n     either to restrain the enrichment of the former or to prevent the\r\n     impoverishment of the latter\"--this even as regards born Spartans.\r\n     As to the early military communism of Sparta and Crete, see Meyer,\r\n     _Geschichte des Alterthums_, ii, Sec. 210; and as to the economic\r\n     process see Fustel de Coulanges, _Nouvelles recherches sur quelques\r\n     problemes d'histoire_, 1891, pp. 99-118.\r\n\r\nAthens, on the other hand, was so situated as to become a place of\r\nindustry and commerce; and from about the time of her great land-crisis,\r\nsolved by Solon, her industrial and commercial interests determined her\r\neconomic development. It follows from the success of Peisistratos that\r\nthe mass of the people, blind to the importance of the political rights\r\nconferred upon them, were conscious of no such betterment from Solon's\r\n\"shaking-off-of-burdens\" as could make them averse to the rule of a\r\n\"tyrant\" who even laid upon them a new tax. The solution may perhaps lie\r\nin points of fiscal policy to which we have now no clear clue. Of Solon\r\nit is recorded[235] that he made a law against the export of any food\r\nproduce of Attica save oil--the yield of the olive. This implied that of\r\nthat product only was there in his opinion a redundancy; and we have it\r\nfrom the same source that he \"saw that the soil was so poor that it\r\ncould only suffice for the farmers,\" and so \"gave great honour to\r\ntrade,\" and \"made a law that a son was not obliged to support his father\r\nif his father had not taught him a trade.\"[236] Himself a travelled\r\nmerchant, he further recognised that \"merchants are unwilling to\r\ndespatch cargoes to a country which has nothing to export\"; and we are\r\nled to infer that he encouraged on the one hand the export of\r\nmanufactures, _plus_ oil, and on the other the importation of corn and\r\nother food. In point of fact, grain was already being imported in\r\nincreasing quantity from the recently colonised lands of Sicily and the\r\nCrimea;[237] and if the imports were free or lightly taxed the inland\r\ncultivators would have a local grievance in the depression of the prices\r\nof their produce.\r\n\r\nThe town and coast-dwellers, on the other hand, found their account in\r\nthe carriage and development of manufactures--vases, weapons, objects of\r\nart--which, with the oil, and latterly the wine export, bought them\r\ntheir food from afar. Athens could thus go on growing in a fashion\r\nimpossible to an agricultural community on the same soil; and could so\r\nescape that fate of shrinkage in the free class which ultimately fell\r\nupon purely agricultural Sparta. The upshot was that, after as before\r\nSolon, Athens had commercial interests among her pretexts for war, and\r\nso widened the sphere of her hostilities, escaping the worst forms of\r\n\"stasis\" in virtue of the expansibility of commerce and the openings for\r\nnew colonisation which commerce provided and widened. But colonisation\r\nthere had to be. Precisely by reason of her progressiveness, her\r\nopenness to the alien, her trade and her enterprise, Attica increased in\r\npopulation at a rate which enforced emigration, while the lot of the\r\nrural population did not economically improve, and the probable change\r\nfrom corn-growing to olive-culture[238] would lessen the number of\r\npeople employed on the land. Even apart from the fact of the popular\r\ndiscontent which welcomed the _tyrannis_ of Peisistratos, we cannot\r\ndoubt that Solon's plans had soon failed to exclude the old phenomena of\r\npoverty. The very encouragement he gave to artisans to immigrate,[239]\r\nwhile it made for the democratic development and naval strength of\r\nAthens, was a means of quickening the approach of a new economic crisis.\r\nAnd yet he seems to have recognised the crux of population. The\r\ntraditional permission given by the sage to parents to expose infants,\r\nimplicitly avows the insoluble problem--the \"cursed fraction\" in the\r\nequation, which will not disappear; and in the years of the approach of\r\nPeisistratos to power we find Athens sending to Salamis (about 570) its\r\nfirst _kleruchie_, or civic colony-settlement on subject territory--this\r\nby way of providing for landless and needy citizens.[240] It was the\r\neasiest compromise; and nothing beyond compromise was dreamt of.\r\n\r\n     [The statement that Solon by law permitted the exposure of infants\r\n     is made by Malthus, who gives no authority, but is followed by\r\n     Lecky. The law in question is not mentioned by Plutarch, and I do\r\n     not find it noticed by any of the historians. It is stated,\r\n     however, by Sextus Empiricus (_Hypotyp_. iii, 24) that Solon made a\r\n     law by which a parent could put his child to death; and this\r\n     passage, which is cited by Hume in his _Essay on the Populousness\r\n     of Ancient Nations_, is doubtless Malthus's authority. Nothing\r\n     nearer to the purpose is cited by Meursius in his monograph on\r\n     Solon; but this could very well stand as a permission of\r\n     infanticide, especially seeing that the practice is presumptively\r\n     prehistoric. Petit writes: \"Quemadmodum liberos tollere in patris\r\n     erat positum potestate, ita etiam necare et exponere, idque, meo\r\n     judicio, non tam moribus quam lege receptum fuit Athenis\" (_Leges\r\n     Atticae_, fol. 219, ed. Wesseling, 1742). Grote (ii, 470, _note_)\r\n     pronounces that the statement of Sextus \"cannot be true, and must\r\n     be copied from some untrustworthy authority,\" seeing that Dionysius\r\n     the Halicarnassian (ii, 26) contrasts the large scope of the\r\n     _patria potestas_ among the Romans with the restrictions which all\r\n     the Greek legislators, Solon included, either found or introduced.\r\n     Dr. Mahaffy (_Social Life in Greece_, 3rd ed. p. 165) believes \"the\r\n     notion of exposing infants from _economical_ motives not to have\r\n     prevailed till later times\" than the seventh century B.C., but he\r\n     gives no reason for fixing any date. We may take it as certain that\r\n     while the laws of Lycurgus, like the Roman Twelve Tables, enjoined\r\n     or permitted the destruction of sickly or deformed infants, the\r\n     general Greek usage allowed exposure. The express prohibition of it\r\n     at Thebes (AElian, _Var. Hist._ ii, 7) implies its previous\r\n     normality there and elsewhere (cp. however, Aristotle, _Pol._ vii,\r\n     16); and the _sale_ of children by their (free) parents was further\r\n     permitted, except in Attica (Ingram, _History of Slavery_, p. 16);\r\n     while even there a freeman's children by a slave concubine were\r\n     slaves.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the laws even of Sparta, framed with a view to the\r\nmilitary strength of the State considered as the small free population,\r\nwere ultimately evaded in the interests of property-holding, till the\r\nnumber of \"pure Spartans\" dwindled to a handful.[241] Under a system of\r\nprimogeniture, with a rigid severance between the upper class and the\r\nlower, there could in fact be no other outcome. Here, apart from the\r\nrevolts of the helots and the chronic massacres of these by their lords,\r\nwhich put such a stamp of atrocity on Spartan history,[242] the stress\r\nof class strife seems to have been limited among the aristocracy, not\r\nonly by systematic infanticide, but by the survival of polyandry,\r\nseveral brothers often having one wife in common.[243] Whether owing to\r\ninfanticide, or to in-breeding, or to preventives, families of three and\r\nfour were uncommon and considered large, and special privileges offered\r\nto the fathers.[244] As always, such devices failed against the\r\npressures of the main social conditions. All the while, of course, the\r\n_perioikoi_ and the enslaved helots multiplied freely; hence the policy\r\nof specially thinning down the latter by over-toil[245] as well as\r\nmassacre. In other States, where the polity was more civilised, many\r\nobservers perceived that the two essential conditions of stability were\r\n(_a_) absolute or approximate equality of property, and (_b_) restraint\r\nof population, the latter principle being a notable reaction of reason\r\nagainst the normal practice of encouraging or compelling marriage.[246]\r\nAristotle said in so many words that to let procreation go unchecked \"is\r\nto bring certain poverty on the citizens; and poverty is the cause of\r\nsedition and evil\";[247] and he cites previous publicists who had sought\r\nto solve the problem. Socrates and Plato had partly contemplated it; and\r\nthe idealist, as usual, had proposed the more brutal methods;[248] but\r\nAristotle, seeing more clearly the population difficulty, perhaps on\r\nthat account is the less disposed towards communism.\r\n\r\n     As medical knowledge advanced, it seems certain, the practice of\r\n     abortion must have been generally added to that of infanticide in\r\n     Greece, as later in Rome. See Aristotle, _Politics_, vii, 16;\r\n     Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, c. 3; and Plato, _Theaetetus_, p. 149\r\n     (Jowett's trans. iv, 202), as to the normal resort to abortion. The\r\n     Greeks must have communicated to the Romans the knowledge of the\r\n     arts of abortion, as they did those of medicine generally. But it\r\n     does not appear that with all these checks population really fell\r\n     off in Greece until after the time of Alexander. Before that time\r\n     it may very well have fallen off in Athens when she lost her\r\n     position as sovereign and tribute-drawing State. The tribute would\r\n     tend to maintain a population in excess of the natural amount. Dr.\r\n     Mahaffy (_Rambles and Studies in Greece_, 4th ed. p. 11--a passage\r\n     not squared with the data in _Greek Life and Thought_, pp. 328,\r\n     558) accepts the old view of a general and inexplicable\r\n     depopulation. One of the _loci classici_ on that head, in the\r\n     treatise _On the Cessation of Oracles_ (viii) attributed to\r\n     Plutarch but probably not by him, is searchingly examined by Hume\r\n     at the close of his essay _Of the Populousness of Ancient Nations_,\r\n     and the critic comes to the conclusion that the extreme decay there\r\n     asserted cannot have taken place. He was in all probability right\r\n     in arguing that the number of slaves in Attica had been enormously\r\n     exaggerated in the figures of Athenaeus (cp. Cunningham, _Western\r\n     Civilisation_, i, 109, note). There is reason to conclude, however,\r\n     that Hume was unduly incredulous on some points. Strabo (refs. in\r\n     Thirlwall, viii, 460) had found an immense decay of population in\r\n     Greece more than a century before Plutarch; and his details prove a\r\n     process of shrinkage which must have lasted long. In any case, a\r\n     relative depopulation took place after the conquests of Alexander,\r\n     from the operation of socio-economic causes, which are indicated by\r\n     Finlay (_History of Greece_, Tozer's ed. i, 15; cp. Mahaffy, _Greek\r\n     Life and Thought_, p. 328, and _The Greek World under Roman Sway_,\r\n     1890, p. 218). Broadly speaking, the Greeks went to lands where\r\n     wealth was more easily acquired than in their own. Further\r\n     depopulation took place under the Romans, partly from direct\r\n     violence and deportation, partly from fiscal pressure, partly from\r\n     the economic causes already noted.\r\n\r\nThirlwall, in his closing survey, proceeding on Polybius,[249]\r\nconfidently decides that the main cause of depopulation was domestic and\r\nmoral. Such a theory cannot be sustained. Polybius evidently had no\r\nclear idea of the facts, since he asserts that \"in our time\" and\r\n\"rapidly\" there took place in Greece a \"failure of offspring\" (or\r\n\"dearth of children\"), which left cities desolate and land waste; and\r\ngoes on to ascribe it to habits of luxury, which either kept men from\r\nmarrying or made them refuse to rear more than a few of their children.\r\nThe whole theorem is haphazard. Cities and lands could not have been so\r\ndepopulated.[250] There must have been, in addition to slaughter, a\r\ndrain of population to lands where the conditions were more\r\nadvantageous. Nor is there any good reason for believing that\r\nchild-exposure had suddenly and immensely increased. Thirlwall says that\r\nmarriages were \"unfruitful\"; but this is not the statement of Polybius.\r\nIt is true that paederasty would count for much in lowering character;\r\nbut it had been common in Greece centuries before the time of Polybius,\r\nand had not affected fecundity. As we have seen,[251] fecundity fell in\r\nSparta for other reasons.\r\n\r\nAs between Sparta and Athens, the main difference was that Athenian life\r\nwas for a long period more or less expansive, while that of Sparta, even\r\nin the period of special vigour, was steadily contractive, as regarded\r\nquantity and quality of \"good life.\" At Sparta, as above noted, the\r\nnormal play of self-interest in the governing class brought about a\r\ncontinuous shrinkage in the number of enfranchised citizens and of\r\nthose holding land, till there were only 700 of the former and 100 of\r\nthe latter--this when there were still 4,500 adult Spartans of \"pure\"\r\ndescent, and 15,000 Laconians capable of military service. Even of the\r\nhundred landowners many were women, the estates having thus evidently\r\naggregated by descent through heiresses.[252] It mattered little that\r\nthis inner ring of rich became, after the triumph over Athens and in the\r\npost-Alexandrian period, as luxurious as the rest of Greece:[253] the\r\nevil lay not in the mode of their expenditure, but in the mode of their\r\nrevenue. Agis IV and his successor Cleomenes thought to put the\r\ncommunity on a sound footing by abolition of debts and forcible division\r\nof the land; but even had Agis triumphed at home or Cleomenes maintained\r\nhimself abroad, the expedient could have availed only for a time.\r\nAccumulation would instantly recommence in the absence of a scientific\r\nand permanent system.\r\n\r\n     Schemes for promoting equality had been mooted in Greece from an\r\n     early period (see Aristotle, _Politics_, ii, 6, 7, 8). Thus,\r\n     \"Pheidon the Corinthian, one of the oldest of legislators, thought\r\n     that the families and number of citizens ought to continue the\r\n     same.\" Phaleas of Chalcedon proposed to keep fortunes and culture\r\n     equal; and Hippodamus the Milesian had a system of equality for a\r\n     State of 10,000 persons. Some States, too, put restraints on the\r\n     accumulation of land. But, save for transient successes, such as\r\n     that of Solon at Athens, and of the compromise at Tarentum (see\r\n     Aristotle, v, 5; and Mueller, _Dorians_, Eng. tr. ii, 184-86), there\r\n     was no adequate adjustment of means to ends, as indeed there could\r\n     not be. Aristotle's own practical suggestions show the hopelessness\r\n     of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial cities, where industry was encouraged and wealth\r\ntended to take the form of invested capital, it could not readily get\r\ninto so few hands; and as commerce developed and the investments were\r\nmore and more in that direction, there would arise an idle rich class\r\nwhich could be best got at by way of taxation. In such communities,\r\nthough the division and hostility of rich and poor were as unalterable\r\nas in Sparta, there was more elasticity of adjustment; so that we see\r\nmaritime and trading communities like Heracleia and Rhodes maintaining\r\ntheir oligarchic government, with vicissitudes, down into the Roman\r\nperiod,[254] somewhat as Venice in a later age outlasted the other\r\nchief republics of Italy. The ruin of Corinth, though indirectly\r\npromoted by class strifes,[255] need not have occurred but for the Roman\r\noverthrow.[256]\r\n\r\nAs regards Athens, it is necessary to guard against some misconceptions\r\nconcerning the life conditions even of the Periclean period. Public\r\nbuildings apart, it was not a rich or rich-looking city; on the\r\ncontrary, partly by reason of the force of democratic sentiment, its\r\nhouses were mostly mean, the well-to-do people presumably having their\r\nbetter houses in the country, where the land was now mostly owned by\r\nthem. After the destruction of the city by Xerxes (480 B.C.), the first\r\nneed was felt to be its refortification on a larger scale, even\r\nsepulchres as well as the remains of private houses being made to yield\r\nmaterials for the walls.[257] At the same time the Piraeus and Munychia\r\nwere walled on a still greater scale--the whole constituting a public\r\nwork of extraordinary scope, rapidly carried through by the co-operation\r\nof the whole of the citizens. The further gradual rebuilding of the\r\ncity, as well as the fresh flocking of the foreign trading population to\r\nthe now safe Piraeus, would help, with the public works of Pericles, to\r\nset up the conditions of general prosperity which prevailed before the\r\nPeloponnesian war.[258] According to Demosthenes, the public men of the\r\ngeneration of Salamis had houses indistinguishable from those of\r\nordinary people, whereas in the orator's own day the statesmen had\r\nhouses actually finer than the public buildings.[259] This would be the\r\nnatural result of the control of the confederate treasure resulting from\r\nthe Athenian supremacy. But Dicaearchus belongs to the same period, and\r\nhis account represents the mass of the city as poor in appearance, the\r\nhouses small and with projecting stairways, and the streets\r\ncrooked.[260] We know further from Xenophon that there were many empty\r\nspaces, some of them doubtless made by the customary destruction of the\r\nhouses of those ostracised. There was thus a considerable approach to a\r\nrather straitened equality among the mass of the town-dwelling free\r\ncitizens, who, despite the meanness of their houses, had luxuries in the\r\nform of the public baths and gymnasia.\r\n\r\nBefore Salamis, again, the revenue drawn from the leases of the silver\r\nmines of Laurium had been equally divided among the enfranchised\r\ncitizens--an arrangement which had yielded only a small sum to each,\r\nbut which represented a notable adumbration of a communal system, with\r\nthe fatal implication of a basis in slavery.[261] The devotion of this\r\nfund[262] to the building of a navy was the making of the Athenian\r\nmaritime power; whence in turn came the ability of Athens to extort\r\ntribute from the allied States, and therewith to achieve relatively the\r\ngreatest and most effective expenditure on public works[263] ever\r\nattempted by any government. It was this specially created demand for\r\nand endowment of the arts and the drama that raised Athens to the\r\nartistic and literary supremacy of the ancient world, and, by so\r\ncreating a special intellectual soil, prepared the ensuing supremacy of\r\nAthenian philosophy.[264] But the Periclean policy of endowment went far\r\nbeyond even the employment of labour by the State on the largest scale;\r\nit set up the principle of supplying something like an income to\r\nmultitudes of poorer free citizens--an experiment unique in history. The\r\nmain features of the system were: (1) Payments for service to the\r\nmembers of the Council of Five Hundred; (2) payments to all jurors, an\r\norder numbering some six thousand; (3) the _theorikon_ or allowance of\r\ntheatre money to all the poorer citizens; (4) regular payments to the\r\nsoldiers and sailors; (5) largesses of corn, or sales at reduced prices;\r\n(6) sacrificial banquets, shared in by the common people; (7) the\r\nsending out of \"kleruchies,\" or bodies of quasi-colonists, who were\r\nbilleted on the confederate cities, to the number of five or six\r\nthousand in ten years. Without taking the _a priori_ hostile view of the\r\naristocratic faction, who bitterly opposed all this--a view endorsed\r\nlater by Plato and Socrates--the common-sense politician must note the\r\nutter insecurity of the whole development, depending as it did\r\nabsolutely on military predominance.[265] The mere cessation of the\r\nexpenditure on public works at the fall of Athens in the Peloponnesian\r\nwar was bound to affect class relations seriously; and parties, already\r\nbitter, were henceforth more decisively so divided.[266]\r\n\r\nIn the second period of Athenian ascendency, after the fall of the\r\nThirty Tyrants and of Sparta, when the virtual pensioning of citizens\r\nbegun by Pericles had been carried to still further lengths,[267] we\r\nfind Xenophon, the typical Greek of culture and military experience,\r\nproposing a financial plan[268] whereby Athens, instead of keeping up\r\nthe renewed practice of oppressing the confederate cities in order to\r\npay pensions to its own poorer citizens, should derive a sufficient\r\nrevenue from other sources. In particular he proposed (1) the\r\nencouraging of foreigners to settle in the city in larger numbers, by\r\nexempting them from military service and from all forms of public\r\nstigma, and by giving them the waste grounds to build on. The taxes they\r\nwould have to pay as aliens would serve as revenue to maintain the\r\ncitizens proper. (2) A fund should be established for the encouragement\r\nof trade which in some unexplained way should yield a high interest,\r\npaid by the State, to all investors. (3) The State should build inns,\r\nshops, warehouses, and exchanges, chiefly for the use of the foreigners,\r\nand so further increase its revenue. (4) It should build ships for the\r\nmerchant trade, and charter them out upon good security. (5) Above all,\r\nit should develop by slave labour the silver mines of Laurium, to the\r\nyield of which there was no limit. The public, in fact, might there\r\nemploy thrice as many slaves as the number of citizens; and it should\r\nfurther set about finding new mines.\r\n\r\nWe have here the measure of the Athenian faculty to solve the democratic\r\nproblem as then recognised. The polity of Pericles was bound to perish,\r\nalike because it negated international ethics and because it had no true\r\neconomic basis. The comparatively well-meaning plan of Xenophon could\r\nnot even be set in motion, so purely fanciful is its structure. The\r\nincome of the poorer citizens is to come from the taxes and rents paid\r\nby foreigners, and from mines worked by slave labour; the necessary army\r\nof slaves has to be bought as a State investment. It is as if the Boers\r\nof the Transvaal had proposed to live idly in perpetuity on the dues\r\npaid by the immigrants, all the while owning all the mines and drawing\r\nall the profits. It is hardly necessary to say, with Boeckh,[269] that\r\nthe thesis as to the yield of the mines was a pure delusion; and that\r\nthe idea of living on the taxation of foreigners was suicidal.[270] The\r\nold method, supplemented perforce by some regular taxation of the\r\ntaxable citizens, and by the special exaction of \"liturgies\" or payments\r\nfor the religious festival drama and other public services from the\r\nrich, was maintained as long as might be; industry tending gradually to\r\ndecay, though the carrying trade and the resumed concourse of foreigners\r\nfor a time kept Athens a leading city. Never very rich agriculturally,\r\nthe middle and upper classes had for the rest only their manufactures\r\nand their commerce as sources of income; and as the manufactures were\r\nmostly carried on by slave labour, and were largely dependent on the\r\nState's control of the confederate treasure, the case of the poorer free\r\ncitizens must necessarily worsen when that control ceased. About 400\r\nB.C. the Athenians had still a virtual monopoly of the corn trade of\r\nBosporus, on which basis they could develop an extensive shipping, which\r\nwas a source of many incomes; but even these would necessarily be\r\naffected by the new regimen which began with the Macedonian conquest.\r\n\r\n     The attempt of Boeckh (bk. i, ch. viii) to confute the ordinary\r\n     view as to the poverty of the Attic soil cannot be maintained. (See\r\n     above, p. 99.) Niebuhr (_Lectures on Roman History_, Eng. tr. 3rd\r\n     ed. p. 264) doubtless goes to the other extreme in calling the\r\n     Greeks bad husbandmen. Compare the contrary view of Cox, _General\r\n     History_, 2nd ed. p. 4. But even good husbandry on a poor soil\r\n     could not compete with the output of Bosporus and Egypt. And in the\r\n     Peloponnesian war Attic agriculture sank to a low level (Curtius'\r\n     _History_, Eng. tr. iv, 71; bk. v, ch. ii).\r\n\r\n     As to the incomes made in the Bosporus corn-trade, cp. Grote, x,\r\n     410, 412, 413. When it became possible thus to draw a revenue from\r\n     investment, the Athenian publicists rapidly developed the\r\n     capitalist view that the lending of money capital is the support of\r\n     trade. See Demosthenes, as cited by Boeckh, bk. i, ch. ix.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nIn the economic readjustments, finally, which followed on the rise and\r\nsubdivision of the empire of Alexander, Greece as a whole took a\r\nsecondary place in the Hellenistic world, though Macedonia kept much of\r\nits newly acquired wealth. While commerce passed with industry and\r\npopulation to the new eastern cities, the remaining wealth of Greece\r\nproper would tend to pass into fewer hands,[271] thus _pro tanto_\r\nnarrowing more than ever the free and cultured class, and relatively\r\nenlarging that of the slaves.\r\n\r\n     [Boeckh (bk. i, ch. viii) dwells on the variety of manufactures,\r\n     and here gives a juster view than does Dr. Mahaffy, who (_Social\r\n     Life in Greece_, 3rd ed. p. 406) oddly speaks of the lack of\r\n     machinery as making \"any large employment of hands in manufacture\r\n     impossible.\" But the main manufacture, that of arms, was peculiarly\r\n     dependent on the Athenian command of the confederate treasure; and\r\n     it does not appear that the other manufactures were a source of\r\n     much revenue till just before the period of political decline, when\r\n     other causes combined to check Athenian trade. By that time the\r\n     aristocratic class had weakened in their old prejudice against all\r\n     forms of commerce (Mahaffy, as cited; Boeckh, as cited), which had\r\n     hitherto kept it largely in the hands of aliens, this long after\r\n     the time when, at Corinth and other ports, the ruling class had\r\n     been constituted of the rich traders; and after the special efforts\r\n     of Solon to encourage and enforce industry. Apart from this\r\n     prejudice, which in many States put a political disability on\r\n     traders, commerce had always been hampered by war and bad policy.\r\n     Dr. Mahaffy (_Social Life_, p. 405) somewhat over-confidently\r\n     follows Heeren and Boeckh in deciding that none of the Greek trade\r\n     laws were in the interests of particular trades or traders; but\r\n     even if they were not, they none the less hampered all commerce.\r\n     Cp. Boeckh, bk. i, ch. ix. As Hume observed, the high rates of\r\n     profit and interest prevailing in Greece show an early stage of\r\n     commerce. Cp. Boeckh, bk. i, chs. ix, xxii.]\r\n\r\nThose who had not shared in the plunder of Asia, to begin with, would\r\nfind themselves badly impoverished, for the new influx of bullion would\r\nraise all prices. It is notable, on the other hand, that philosophy,\r\nformerly the study of men with, for the most part, good incomes, and\r\nthence always associated more or less with the spirit of\r\naristocracy,[272] was now often cultivated by men of humble status.[273]\r\nThe new rich then appear to have already fallen away somewhat from the\r\nold Athenian standards; while the attraction of poorer men was\r\npresumably caused in part by the process of endowment of the philosophic\r\nschools begun by Plato in his will--an example soon followed by\r\nothers.[274] It is probable that as much weight is due to this economic\r\ncause as to that of political restraint in the explanation of the\r\nprosperity of philosophy at Athens at a time when literature was\r\nrelatively decaying.\r\n\r\nThe Roman conquest, again, further depressed Greek fortunes by absolute\r\nviolence, hurling whole armies of the conquered into slavery,[275] and\r\nlater setting up a new foreign attraction to the Greeks of ready wit and\r\nsmall means. They presumably began to flock to Rome or Egypt or Asia\r\nMinor as the conditions in Greece worsened; and that process in turn\r\nwould be promoted by the gradual worsening of the Roman financial\r\npressure. It is notable that a rebellion of Attic slaves occurred in 133\r\nB.C., synchronously with the first slave-rising in Sicily--a proof of\r\nfresh oppression all round.[276] The Romans had retained the Greek\r\nsystems of municipal government, and had begun by putting on light\r\ntaxes.[277] But these surely increased;[278] and the Mithridatic war, in\r\nwhich Athens had taken the anti-Roman side, changed all for the worse.\r\nSulla took the city after a difficult siege, massacred most of the\r\ncitizens, and entirely destroyed the Piraeus; whereafter Athens\r\npractically ceased for centuries to be a commercial centre. Corinth,\r\nwhich had been razed to the ground by Mummius, was ultimately\r\nreconstructed by Caesar as a Roman colony, and secured most of what\r\ncommerce Greece retained. Twenty years before, Pompey had put down the\r\nCilician pirates, a powerful community of organised freebooters that had\r\narisen out of the disbanding of the hired forces of Mithridates and\r\nother Eastern monarchs on the triumph of the Romans, and was further\r\nswelled by a large inflow of poverty-stricken Greeks. While it lasted,\r\nit greatly multiplied the number of slaves for the Roman market by\r\nsimple kidnapping.\r\n\r\n     [The great mart for such sales was Delos, which was practically a\r\n     Roman emporium (Strabo, bk. xiv, c. v, Sec. 1). Mahaffy (_Greek World\r\n     under Roman Sway_, p. 154) regards the pirates as largely\r\n     anti-Roman, especially in respect of their sacking of Delos. But\r\n     previously they sold their captives there; and Dr. Mahaffy (p. 7)\r\n     recognises the connection. The pirates, in short, became anti-Roman\r\n     when the Romans, who had so long tolerated them as slave-traders\r\n     (as the rulers of Cyprus and Egypt had done before), were driven to\r\n     keep them in check as pirates.]\r\n\r\nThus all the conditions deteriorated together; and the suppression of\r\nthe pirate state found Greece substantially demoralised, the prey of\r\ngreedy proconsuls, poor in men, rich only in ancient art and in wistful\r\nmemories. In the civil wars before and after Caesar's fall, Greece was\r\nharried by both sides in turn; and down to the time of Augustus\r\ndepopulation and impoverishment seem to have steadily proceeded under\r\nRoman rule.[279] Every special contribution laid on the provinces by the\r\nrulers was made an engine of confiscation; citizens unable to pay their\r\ntaxes were sold as slaves; property owners were forced to borrow at\r\nusurious rates in the old Roman fashion; and the parasitic class of\r\nso-called Roman citizens, as such free of taxation, tended to absorb the\r\nremaining wealth.[280] This wealth in turn tended to take the shape of\r\nluxuries bought from the really productive provinces; and the fatality\r\nof the unproductive communities, lack of the bullion which they in a\r\ndouble degree required, for the time overtook Greece very much as it\r\novertook Italy. Both must have presented a spectacle of exterior\r\nsplendour as regarded their monuments and public buildings, and as\r\nregarded the luxury that was always tending to concentrate in fewer\r\nhands, usurers plundering citizens and proconsuls plundering usurers;\r\nbut the lot of the mass of the people must have been depressed to the\r\nverge of endurance if depopulation had not spontaneously yielded relief.\r\nAs it was, the Greek populations would tend to consist more and more of\r\nthe capitalistic, official, and parasitic classes on the one hand, and\r\nof slaves and poor on the other.[281]\r\n\r\nThe general depopulation of subject Greece is thus perfectly\r\nintelligible. The \"race\" had not lost reproductive power; and even its\r\nnewer artificial methods of checking numbers were not immeasurably more\r\nactive than simple infanticide or exposure had been in the palmy days.\r\nIn the ages of expansion the whole Hellenic world in nearly all its\r\ncities and all its islands swarmed with a relatively energetic\r\npopulation, who won from conditions often in large part unpropitious a\r\nsufficiency of subsistence on which to build by the hands of slaves a\r\nwonderful world of art. To these conditions they were limited by racial\r\nhostilities; everywhere there was substantial though convulsive\r\nequipoise among their own warring forces, and between those of their\r\nfrontier communities and the surrounding \"barbarians.\" The conquest of\r\nAlexander (heralded and invited by the campaign of the Ten Thousand) at\r\none blow broke up this equipoise: organised Greek capacity, once\r\nforcibly unified, triumphed over the now lower civilisations of Egypt\r\nand the East, and Greek population at once began to find its economic\r\nlevel in the easier conditions of some of the conquered lands. They\r\nflocked to Egypt and elsewhere in the Mediterranean basin as they do at\r\nthe present time, for similar economic reasons. Nothing could now\r\nrestore the old conditions; but the Roman conquest and tyranny forced on\r\nthe disintegration till Greece proper was but the glorious shell of the\r\nlife of the past, inhabited by handfuls of a semi-alien population,\r\ngrown in a sense psychically degenerate under evil psychic conditions.\r\nIn the lower strata of this population began the spread of Christianity,\r\npassing sporadically from Syria to the Greek cities, as at the same time\r\nto Egypt and Rome. A new conception of life was generated on the plane\r\nthat typified it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nIt is a great testimony to the value of sheer peace that in the Roman\r\nEmpire of the second century, with an incurable economic malady, as it\r\nwere, eating into its nerve centres, and with no better provision for\r\nthe higher life than the schools of rhetoric and the endowments of the\r\nGreek philosophic chairs, there was yet evolved a system of law and\r\nadministration which, even under the frightful chances of imperial\r\nsuccession, sustained for centuries a vast empire, and imposed itself as\r\na model on the very barbarism that overthrew it. And it is this system\r\nwhich connects for us the life conditions of Greece as the Romans held\r\nit, with its artistic shell almost intact despite all the Roman\r\nplunder,[282] and those of the strangely un-Hellenic Greek-speaking\r\nworld which we know as Byzantium, with its capital at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe economic changes in this period can be traced only with difficulty\r\nand uncertainty; but they must have been important. The multiplication\r\nof slaves, which was a feature of the ages of the post-Alexandrian\r\nempires, the Roman conquest, and the Cilician pirate state, would\r\nnecessarily be checked at a certain stage, both in town and country, by\r\nthe continued shrinkage of the rich class. Agriculture in Greece, as in\r\nItaly, could not compete with that of Egypt; and slave-farming, save in\r\nspecial cultures, would not be worth carrying on. In the towns, again,\r\nthe manufactures carried on by means of slaves had also dwindled\r\ngreatly; and the small wealthy class could not and would not maintain\r\nmore than a certain number of slaves for household purposes. The records\r\nof the religious associations, too, as we shall see, seem to prove that\r\nmen who were slaves in status had practical freedom of life, and the\r\npower of disposing of part of their earnings; whence it may be inferred\r\nthat many owners virtually liberated their slaves, though retaining a\r\nlegal claim over them. In this state of things population would\r\ngradually recover ground, albeit on a low plane. The type of poor\r\nsemi-Greek now produced would live at a lower standard of comfort than\r\nhad latterly been set for themselves by the more educated, who would\r\nlargely drift elsewhere; and a home-staying population living mainly on\r\nolives and fish could relatively flourish, both in town and country. On\r\nthat basis, in turn, commerce could to some extent revive, especially\r\nwhen Nero granted to the Greeks immunity from taxation.[283] We are\r\nprepared then, in the second century, under propitious rulers like\r\nHadrian and the Antonines, to find Greek life materially improved.[284]\r\nThe expenditure of Hadrian on public works, and the new endowments of\r\nthe philosophic schools at Athens by the Antonines, would stimulate such\r\na revival; and the Greek cities would further regain ground as Italy\r\nlost it, with the growth of cosmopolitanism throughout the Empire. While\r\ndomestic slavery would still abound, the industries in Athens under the\r\nimperial rule would tend to be carried on by freedmen.\r\n\r\nA further stimulus would come from the overthrow of the Parthian empire\r\nof the Arsacidae by Artaxerxes, 226 A.C. The Arsacidae, though often at\r\nwar with the Romans, still represented the Hellenistic civilisation,\r\nwhereas the Sassanidae zealously returned to the ancient Persian\r\nreligion, the exclusiveness of which would serve as a barrier to Western\r\ncommerce,[285] even while the cult of Mithra, Hellenised to the extent\r\nof being specially associated with image-worship, was spreading widely\r\nin the West. Commerce would now tend afresh to concentrate in Greece,\r\nthe Indian and Chinese trade passing north and south of Persia.[286] The\r\nremoval of the seat of government from Rome by Diocletian, greatly\r\nlessening the Italian drain on the provinces, would still further assist\r\nthe Greek revival after the Gothic invasion had come and gone. Thus we\r\nfind the larger Greek world in the time of Constantine grown once more\r\nso important that in the struggle between him and Licinius his great\r\nnaval armament, composed chiefly of European Greeks, was massed in the\r\nrestored Piraeus. The fleet of Licinius, made up chiefly by Asiatic and\r\nEgyptian Greeks, already showed a relative decline on that side of the\r\nEmpire's resources.[287] When, finally, Constantine established the new\r\nseat of empire at Byzantium, he tended to draw thither all the streams\r\nof Greek commerce, and to establish there, as the centre of the revenues\r\nof the Eastern Empire, some such population as had once flourished in\r\nRome; with, however, a definite tendency to commerce and industry in the\r\nlower class population as well as in the middle class. To the government\r\nof this population was brought the highly developed organisation of the\r\nlater Pagan Empire, joined with an ecclesiastical system from which\r\nheresy was periodically eliminated by the imperial policy, aided by the\r\npositive intellectual inferiority of the new Greek-speaking species.\r\nThere was prosperity enough for material life; and the political and\r\nreligious system was such as to prevent the normal result of prosperity,\r\nculture, from developing independently. The much-divided Greek world had\r\nat last, after countless convulsions, been brought to a possibility of\r\nquasi-inert equilibrium, an equilibrium which enabled it to sustain and\r\nrepel repeated and destructive irruptions of northern barbarism,[288]\r\nand on the whole to hold at bay, with a shrunken territory, its\r\nneighbouring enemies for a thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nWe have passed, then, through a twilight age, to find a new civilised\r\nempire ruled on the lines of the old, but with a single, albeit\r\nmuch-divided religion, and that the Christian, all others having been\r\nextirpated not by persuasion but by governmental force, after the new\r\ncreed, adapting itself to its economic conditions, had secured for\r\nitself and its poor adherents, mainly from superstitious rich women, an\r\namount of endowment such as no cult or priesthood possessed in the days\r\nof democracy. This process of endowment itself originated, however, in\r\npagan practice; for in the days of substitution of emotional Eastern\r\ncults for the simpler worships of early Hellas, there had grown up a\r\nmultitude of voluntary societies for special semi-religious,\r\nsemi-festival purposes--_thiasoi_, _eranoi_, and _orgeones_, all\r\ncultivating certain alien sacrifices and mysteries, as those of\r\nDionysos, Adonis, Sabazios, Sarapis, Cotytto, or any other God called\r\n\"Saviour.\"[289] These societies, unlike the older Hellenic associations\r\nof the same names[290] for the promotion of native worships, were freely\r\nopen to women, to foreigners, and even to slaves;[291] they were\r\nabsolutely self-governing; the members subscribed according to their\r\nmeans; and we find them flourishing in large numbers in the age of the\r\nAntonines,[292] when the old state cults were already deserted, though\r\nstill endowed. They represent, as has been said, the reappearance of the\r\ndemocratic spirit and the gregarious instinct in new fields and in lower\r\nstrata when general and practical democracy has been suppressed. In some\r\nsuch fashion did the Christian Church begin, employing the attractions\r\nand the machinery of many rival cults. Its final selection and\r\nestablishment by the Empire represented in things religious a process\r\nanalogous to that which had forcibly unified the competing republics of\r\nGreece in one inflexible and unprogressive organisation. Nothing but\r\ngovernmental force could have imposed doctrinal unity on the chaos of\r\nsects into which Christianity was naturally subdividing; but the power\r\nof conferring on the State Church special revenues was an effective\r\nmeans of keeping it practically subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe historian who has laid down the proposition that religious unity was\r\nthe cause of the survival of the Eastern Empire when the Western\r\nfell,[293] has made the countervailing admission that between Justinian\r\nand Heraclius there was an almost universal centrifugal tendency in the\r\nByzantine State, which was finally overcome only by \"the inexorable\r\nprinciple of Roman centralisation,\"[294] at a time when it was nearly\r\ndestroyed by its enemies and its own dissentient forces.[295] Province\r\nafter province had been taken by the Persians in the East; Slavs and\r\nAvars were driving back the population from the northern frontiers, even\r\nharrying the Peloponnesus; discontent enabled Phocas to dethrone and\r\nexecute Maurice (602 A.C.); and Phocas in turn was utterly defeated by\r\nthe Persian foe; when Heraclius appeared, to check the continuity of\r\ndisaster, and to place the now circumscribed Empire on a footing of\r\npossible permanence. But it is important to realise how far the economic\r\nand external conditions conduced to his success, such as it was.\r\nHitherto the populace of Constantinople had been supported, like that of\r\nimperial Rome, by regular allowances of bread to every householder,\r\nprovided from the tributary grain supplies of Egypt. The Persian\r\nconquest of Egypt in the year 616 stopped that revenue; and the\r\nemperor's inability to feed the huge semi-idle populace became a cause\r\nof regeneration, inasmuch as the State was forcibly relieved of the\r\nburden, and many of the idlers became available for the army about to be\r\nled by the emperor against the menacing Persians. He was reduced,\r\nhowever, to the expedient of offering to continue the supply on a\r\npayment of three pieces of gold from each claimant, and finally to\r\nbreaking that contract; whereafter, on his proposing to transfer his\r\ncapital to Carthage to escape the discontent, the populace and the\r\nclergy implored him to remain, and thus enabled him to exact a large\r\nloan from the latter,[296] and to dominate the nobility who had hitherto\r\nhampered his action. The victories of Heraclius over the Persians,\r\nhowever, only left the eastern and Egyptian provinces to fall under the\r\nArabs; the first financial result of his successes having been to tax to\r\nexasperation the recovered lands in order to repay the ecclesiastical\r\nloan with usury; and the circumscribed Empire under his successors could\r\nnot, even if the emperors wished, resume the feeding of the mass of the\r\ncitizens. Constantinople, though still drawing some tribute from the\r\nremaining provinces in Italy, was thus perforce reduced to a safe\r\neconomic basis, even as the people in general had been coerced into\r\nunited effort by the imminent danger from Persia.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, with many vicissitudes of military fortune, the\r\ncontracted Byzantine State endured in virtue of its industrial and\r\ncommercial basis and its consequent maritime and military strength,\r\nmanaged with ancient military science against enemies less skilled. The\r\nnew invention of \"Greek fire,\" like all advances in the use of missiles\r\nin warfare, counted for much; but the decisive condition of success was\r\nthe possession of continuous resources. Justinian, among many measures\r\nof mere oppression and restriction, had contrived to introduce from the\r\nfar East the silk manufacture, which for the ancient and medieval\r\nEuropean world was of enormous mercantile importance. Such a staple,\r\nand the virtual control of the whole commerce between northern and\r\nwestern Europe and the East, kept Byzantium the greatest trading power\r\nin Christendom until the triumph of the Italian republics. Even the\r\nSaracen conquests in Asia and Africa did not seriously affect this\r\nsource of strength; for the Saracen administration, though often wise\r\nand energetic, was in Egypt too often convulsed by civil wars to permit\r\nof trade flourishing there in any superlative degree. The Byzantines\r\ncontinued to trade with India by the Black Sea and Central Asian route;\r\nand their monopolies and imposts, however grievous, were relatively\r\nbearable compared with the afflictions of commerce under other powers.\r\nAs of old, the Greeks or Greek-speaking folk were the traders of the\r\nMediterranean, the Saracen navy never reaching sufficient power to check\r\nthem; and when finally its remnants took to piracy, they served rather\r\nto cut off all weaker competition than to affect the preponderating\r\nnaval power of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn this period of prevailing commercial vigour, from the sixth to the\r\neleventh century, the life of the Greek Empire was substantially civic,\r\nthe rural districts remaining desolate, and agriculture extremely\r\nfeeble,[297] though the Sclavonian immigrants who now inhabited the\r\nPeloponnesus[298] must have lived by that means. Under such\r\ncircumstances the towns would be fed by imported grain, presumably that\r\nof the Crimea; but as they did not grow in size, at least in the case of\r\nthe capital, their industrial prosperity must have largely depended on\r\nthe restriction of population, whether by vice, preventive checks,\r\nmisery, or the sheer unhealthiness of city life, which at the present\r\nday prevents so many Eastern cities from maintaining themselves save by\r\ninflux from the country.[299] It is misleading to point to the legal\r\nveto on infanticide as a great Christian reform without taking these\r\nthings into account. The presumption is that misery, vice,\r\nchild-exposure, and abortion, rather than prudence, kept the poor\r\npopulation within the limits of subsistence.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Oman (_Byzantine Empire_, p. 145) takes the popular view as to\r\n     the reformative effect of Christianity. He goes on to describe\r\n     Constantine as providing for the children of the destitute to\r\n     prevent their exposure, but does not mention that the same thing\r\n     had been done under the Antonines, and that Constantine permitted\r\n     the finder of an exposed child to enslave it. The punishment of all\r\n     exposure as infanticide, under Valentinian, was only an adoption of\r\n     the pagan practice at Thebes (AElian, _Var. Hist._ ii, 7). But in\r\n     spite of all enactments, under Christian as under pagan rule,\r\n     exposure and positive infanticide continued, though Christian\r\n     sentiment never gave it the toleration exhibited in the drama of\r\n     Menander. As to the historic facts, cp. Lecky, _Hist. of European\r\n     Morals_, 6th ed. ii, 24-33.\r\n\r\n     Broadly speaking, it was inevitable that in such a population as is\r\n     pictured for us by Chrysostom--a multitude profoundly ignorant,\r\n     superstitious, excitable, sensuous--all the vices of the\r\n     Graeco-Roman period should habitually flourish, while poverty must\r\n     have been normally acute after the stoppage of regular free bread.\r\n     On the general moral environment, cp. the author's _Short History\r\n     of Freethought_, 2nd ed. i, 249-50.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in the same way, to substitute an accurate for a\r\nconventional view as to the treatment of slaves under the Christian\r\nEmpire. We are still told[300] that the Christian doctrine or\r\nimplication of religious equality had the effect first of greatly\r\nmodifying the evils of slavery and finally of abolishing it. Research\r\nproves that the facts were otherwise. We have already seen how economic\r\ncauses partially limited slavery before Christianity was heard of; and\r\nin so far as the limitation was maintained,[301] the efficient causes\r\nremain demonstrably economic.[302] Indeed, no other causes can be shown\r\nto have existed. Not only is slavery endorsed in the Gospels,[303] and\r\ntreated by Paul as not merely compatible with but favourable to\r\nChristian freedom on the part of the slave,[304] but the early\r\nChristians, commonly supposed to have been the most incorrupt, held\r\nslaves as a matter of course.[305] In the laws of Justinian not a word\r\nis said as to slavery being opposed to either the spirit or the letter\r\nof Christianity; and the only expressions that in any degree deprecate\r\nit are in terms of the Stoic doctrine of the \"law of nature,\"[306] which\r\nwe know to have been already current in the time of Aristotle,[307] and\r\nto have become widespread in the age of the Antonines, under Stoic\r\nauspices. That \"law of nature,\" however, was never allowed to override a\r\ndefinite law of society; and the Christian influence on the other hand\r\nset up a new set of arguments for slavery.[308] Among the Christian\r\nVisigoths, slaves who married without authority from their masters were\r\nforcibly separated; and the slave who dared to marry a free-woman was\r\nburnt alive with his wife; while \"the bishops were among the largest\r\nslave-holders in the realm; and baptised Christians were bought and sold\r\nwithout a blush by the successors of St. Paul and Santiago.\"[309] It\r\ncannot even be said of the Byzantines, any more than of the Protestants\r\nof the southern United States of fifty years ago, that they were more\r\nhumane to their slaves than the earlier pagans had been; for we find\r\nChristian Byzantine matrons causing their slave-girls to be tied up and\r\nbrutally flogged;[310] even as we have the testimony of Salvian to the\r\natrocities committed by Christian slave-owners in Gaul.[311] The\r\nadmission that the Church, even when encouraging laymen to free their\r\nslaves, insisted on retaining its own,[312] is the proof that the urging\r\nforce was not even then doctrinal, but the perception that the Church's\r\nsecular interests were served by the growth of an independent population\r\noutside its own lands.[313] The spirit of the Justinian code, despite\r\nits allusion to the law of nature, and the spirit of the enactments of\r\nthe early Councils of the Church, are alike opposed to any idea of\r\nspiritual equality between bond and free.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the simple restriction of conquest limited the\r\npossibilities of slavery for Byzantium. Captives were enslaved to the\r\nlast,[314] but of these there was no steady supply. In the rural\r\ndistricts, again, the fiscal conditions made for at least nominal\r\nfreedom, as is shown by the historian who has most closely analysed the\r\nconditions:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Roman financial administration, by depressing the higher\r\n     classes and impoverishing the rich, at last burdened the small\r\n     proprietors and cultivators of the soil with the whole weight of\r\n     the land-tax. The labourer of the soil then became an object of\r\n     great interest to the treasury, and ... obtained almost as\r\n     important a position in the eyes of the fisc as the landed\r\n     proprietor himself. The first laws which conferred any rights on\r\n     the slave are those which the Roman government enacted to prevent\r\n     the landed proprietors from transferring their slaves, engaged in\r\n     the cultivation of lands assessed for the land-tax, to other\r\n     employments which, though more profitable to the proprietor of the\r\n     slave, would have yielded a smaller or less permanent return to the\r\n     imperial treasury.[315] The avarice of the imperial treasury, by\r\n     reducing the mass of the free population to the same degree of\r\n     poverty as the slaves, had removed one cause of the separation of\r\n     the two classes. The position of the slave had lost most of its\r\n     moral degradation, and [he] occupied precisely the same political\r\n     position in society as the poor labourer from the moment that the\r\n     Roman fiscal laws compelled any freeman who had cultivated lands\r\n     for the space of thirty years to remain for ever attached, with his\r\n     descendants, to the same estate.[316] The lower orders were from\r\n     that period blended into one class; the slave rose to be a member\r\n     of this body; the freeman descended, but his descent was necessary\r\n     for the improvement of the great bulk of the human race, and for\r\n     the extinction of slavery. _Such was the progress of civilisation\r\n     in the Eastern Empire._ The measures of Justinian which, by their\r\n     fiscal rapacity, tended to sink the free population to the same\r\n     state of poverty as the slaves, really prepared the way for the\r\n     rise of the slaves _as soon as any general improvement took place\r\n     in the condition of the human race_.\"[317]\r\n\r\nFor the rest, it cannot be supposed that the \"freedom\" thus constituted\r\nhad much actuality. Sons of soldiers and artisans were held bound to\r\nfollow their father's profession, as in the hereditary castes of the\r\nEast,[318] and none of the fruits of freedom are to be traced in\r\nByzantine life. Still, the fact remains that the commercial and\r\nindustrial life sustained the political, and that the political began\r\ndefinitely to fail when the commercial did. Constantinople could hardly\r\nhave collapsed as it did before the Crusaders if its commerce had not\r\nalready begun to dwindle through interception by Venice and the Italian\r\ntrading cities. As soon as these were able to trade directly with the\r\nEast they did so, thus withdrawing a large part of the stream of\r\ncommerce from Byzantium; and when, finally, they acquired the secret of\r\nher silk manufacture, her industrial revenue was in turn undermined. On\r\nthe economic weakening, the political followed; and the Eastern Empire\r\nfinally fell before the Turks, very much as the Western had fallen\r\nbefore the Goths.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Aristotle, _Politics_, v, 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: _Id._ i, 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: Plutarch, _Solon_, c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: _Id._ c. 22.

It may be\r\nwell, then, to consider some of these developments as processes of\r\nsocial causation, in terms of the general principles above outlined.\r\n\r\n     [A rational view was reached by the sociologists of the eighteenth\r\n     century, by whom the question of culture beginnings was much\r\n     discussed--_e.g._, Goguet's _De l'origine des lois, des arts, et\r\n     des sciences_, 1758; Ferguson's _Essay on the History of Civil\r\n     Society_, 1767; and Hume's essay on the _Rise and Progress of the\r\n     Arts and Sciences_. At the end of the century we find the solution\r\n     scientifically put by Walckenaer: \"Ainsi le germe de genie et des\r\n     talens existe dans tous les tems, mais tous les tems ne sont pas\r\n     propres a le faire eclore\" (_Essai sur l'histoire de l'espece\r\n     humaine_, 1798, 1. vi, ch. xx, _Des siecles les plus favorables aux\r\n     productions de genie_, pp. 348, 349). In England forty years later\r\n     we find Hallam thus exemplifying the obscurantist reaction: \"There\r\n     is only one cause for the want of great men in any period--nature\r\n     does not think fit to produce them. They are no creatures of\r\n     education and circumstances\" (_Literature of Europe_, pt. i, ch.\r\n     iii, Sec. 35). A kindred though much less crude view underlies Sir\r\n     Francis Galton's argument in _Hereditary Genius_. Cp. the present\r\n     writer's paper on \"The Economics of Genius,\" in _The Forum_, April,\r\n     1898 (rep. in _Essays in Sociology_, vol. ii), and the able essay\r\n     of Mr. Cooley, there cited. My esteemed friend, Mr. Lester Ward\r\n     (_Dynamic Sociology_, ii, 600, 601), seems to me, as does Mill\r\n     (_System of Logic_, bk. vi, ch. iv, Sec. 4; cp. Bain, _J.S. Mill_, p.\r\n     146), to err somewhat on the opposite side to that of Hallam and\r\n     Galton, in assuming that faculty is nearly equal in all, given only\r\n     opportunity.]\r\n\r\nAnd first as to Greece. As against the common conception of the Hellenic\r\npeople as \"innately\" artistic, it may be well to cite the judgment of an\r\nartist who, if not more scientific in his method of reaching his\r\nopinion, has on the whole a better right to it in this case than has the\r\naverage man to his. It is a man of genius who writes[319]: \"A favourite\r\nfaith, dear to those who teach, is that certain periods were especially\r\nartistic, and that nations, readily named, were notably lovers of art.\r\nSo we are told that the Greeks were, as a people, worshippers of the\r\nbeautiful, and that in the fifteenth century art was ingrained in the\r\nmultitude....Listen! There never was an artistic period. There never was\r\nan Art-loving nation.\" This, which was sometime a paradox, is when\r\ninterpreted one of the primary truths of sociology.\r\n\r\nOur theorist goes on to describe the doings of the first artist, and the\r\nslow contagion of his example among men similarly gifted, till the\r\nartistic species had filled the land with beautiful things, which were\r\nuncritically used by the non-artistic; \"and the Amateur was unknown--and\r\nthe Dilettante undreamed of.\" Such is the artist's fairy tale of\r\nexplanation. The probable fact is that the \"first artists\" in historic\r\nGreece were moved to imitative construction by samples of the work of\r\nforeigners. If, on the other hand, we decide that the \"race\" had evolved\r\nrelatively high artistic capacities before it reached its Greek or Asian\r\nhome,[320] it will still hold good that the early AEgean evolution owed\r\nmuch to ancient Oriental and Egyptian example. The Greeks as we know\r\nthem visibly passed from primitive to high art in all things. Having\r\nfirst had fetish Gods of unshapen stone, they made Gods in crudely human\r\nshape, at first probably of wood, later of stone. So with vases,\r\ngoblets, tables, furniture, and ware of all sorts, all gradually\r\ndeveloping in felicity of form up to a certain point, whereafter art\r\nworsened. What we require to know is the why of both processes.\r\n\r\n_Pace_ the artist, it is clear that artistic objects were multiplied\r\nmainly because they were in steady economic demand. The shaping impulse\r\nis doubtless special, and in its highest grades rare; but there must\r\nalso have been special conditions to develop it in one country in the\r\nspecial degree. That is to say, the faculty for shaping, for design, was\r\noftener appealed to in Greece than elsewhere, and was allowed more\r\nfreedom in the response, thus reaching new excellence. The early Greeks\r\ncan have had no very delicate taste, satisfied as they were with statues\r\nas primitive as the conventional Assyrian types they copied.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Burrows, in his valuable work on _The Discoveries in Crete_\r\n     (1907), somewhat confuses one of his problems by assuming that, on\r\n     a given chronological view, the creators of the early AEgean\r\n     civilisation were \"the most progressive and artistic part of the\r\n     race\" (p. 193). No such assumption can be valid on any chronology.\r\n     Every \"part\" of a race, broadly speaking, has the same total\r\n     potentialities. The determinants are the special _evocative_\r\n     conditions, which may be either culture contacts or economic\r\n     fostering. A rational view of the growth of Greek art is put by Dr.\r\n     Mahaffy, despite his endorsement of Mr. Freeman's extravagant\r\n     estimate of Athenian intelligence:--\"However national and diffused\r\n     it [art] became, this was due to careful study, and training, and\r\n     legislation, and not to a sort of natural compulsion.... As natural\r\n     beauty was always the exception among Greek men, so artistic talent\r\n     was also rare and special\" (_Social Life in Greece_, 3rd ed. p.\r\n     430). All the remains, as well as every principle of sociological\r\n     science, go to support this view of the case. When Reber asserts\r\n     (_Hist. of Ancient Art_, Eng. tr. 1883, p. 264) that \"the very\r\n     first carvings of Greece had a power of development which was\r\n     wanting in all the other nations of that period,\" he is setting up\r\n     an occult principle and obscuring the problem. The other nations of\r\n     _that period_ were not in progressive stages; but some of them had\r\n     progressed in art in their time. And many of the \"very first\" Greek\r\n     works--that is, of the \"historic\" period, as distinguished from the\r\n     \"Minoan\"--are enormously inferior to some very ancient Egyptian\r\n     work.\r\n\r\nThe development of taste was itself the outcome of a thousand steps of\r\ncomparison and specialisation, art growing \"artistic\" as children grow\r\nin reasonableness and in nervous co-ordination. And the special\r\nconditions of historic Greece were roughly these:--\r\n\r\n(1) The great primary stimulus to Greek art, science, and thought,\r\nthrough the contact of the early settlers in Asia Minor with the remains\r\nof the older Semitic civilisation,[321] and the further stimuli from\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n(2) Multitude of autonomous communities, of which the members had\r\nintercourse as kindred yet critical strangers, emulous of each other,\r\nbut mixing their stocks, and so developing the potentialities of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n(3) Multitude of religious cults, each having its local temples, its\r\nlocal statues, and its local ritual practices.\r\n\r\n(4) The concourse in Athens, and some other cities, of alert and capable\r\nmen from all parts of the Greek-speaking world,[322] and of men of other\r\nspeech who came thither to learn.\r\n\r\n(5) The special growth of civic and peaceful population in Attica by the\r\nfree incorporation of the smaller towns in the franchise of Athens.\r\nAthens had thus the largest number of free citizens of all the Greek\r\ncities to start with,[323] and the maximum of domestic peace.\r\n\r\n(6) The maintenance of an ideal of cultured life as the outcome of these\r\nconditions, which were not speedily overridden either by (_a_)\r\nsystematic militarism, or (_b_) industrialism, or (_c_) by great\r\naccumulation of wealth.\r\n\r\n(7) The special public expenditure of the State, particularly in the age\r\nof Pericles, on art, architecture, and the drama, and in stipends to the\r\npoorer of the free citizens.\r\n\r\nThus the culture history of Greece, like the political, connects vitally\r\nfrom the first with the physical conditions. The disrupted character of\r\nthe mainland; the diffusion of the people through the AEgean Isles; the\r\nspreading of colonies on east and west, set up a multitude of separate\r\nCity-States, no one of which could decisively or long dominate the rest.\r\nThese democratic and equal communities reacted on each other, especially\r\nthose so placed as to be seafaring. Their separateness developed a\r\nmultitudinous mythology; even the Gods generally recognised being\r\nworshipped with endless local particularities, while most districts had\r\ntheir special deities. For each and all of these were required temples,\r\naltars, statues, sacred vessels, which would be paid for by the\r\npublic[324] or the temple revenues, or by rich devotees; and the\r\ncountless myths, multiplied on all hands because of the absence of\r\nanything like a general priestly organisation, were an endless appeal to\r\nthe imitative arts. Nature, too, had freely supplied the ideal medium\r\nfor sculpture and for the finest architecture--pure marble. And as the\r\npolitical dividedness of Hellenedom prevented even an approach to\r\norganisation among the scattered and independent priests, so the\r\npriesthood had no power and no thought of imposing artistic limitations\r\non the shapers of the art objects given to their temples. In addition to\r\nall this, the local patriotism of the countless communities was\r\nconstantly expressed in statues to their own heroes, statesmen, and\r\nathletes. And in such a world of sculpture, formative art must needs\r\nflourish wherever it could ornament life.\r\n\r\nWe have only to compare the conditions in Judea, Persia, Egypt, and\r\nearly Rome to see the enormous differentiation herein implied. In\r\nMazdean Persia and Yahwistic Judea there was a tabu on all divine\r\nimages, and by consequence on all sculpture that could lend itself to\r\nidolatry.[325] (This tabu, like the monotheistic idea, was itself the\r\noutcome of political and social causation, which is in large part\r\ntraceable and readily intelligible.) In Italy, in the early historic\r\nperiod, outside of Etruria, there had been no process of culture-contact\r\nsufficient to develop any of the arts in a high degree; and the relation\r\nof the Romans to the other Italian communities in terms of situation and\r\ninstitutions[326] was fatally one of progressive conquest. Their\r\nspecialisation was thus military or predaceous; and the formal\r\nacceptance of the deities of the conquered communities could not prevent\r\nthe partial uniformation of worship. Thus Rome had nearly everything to\r\nlearn from Greece in art as in literature. In Egypt, again, where\r\nsculpture had at more than one time, in more than one locality, reached\r\nan astonishing excellence,[327] the easily maintained political\r\ncentralisation[328] and the commercial isolation made fatally for\r\nuniformity of ideal; and the secure dominion of the organised\r\npriesthood, cultured only sacerdotally, always strove to impose one\r\nstolid conventional form on all sacred and ritual sculpture,[329] which\r\nwas copied in the secular, in order that kings should as much as\r\npossible resemble Gods. Where the bulk of Greece was \"servile to all the\r\nskyey influences,\" physically as well as mentally, open on all sides to\r\nall cultures, all pressures, all stimuli, Egypt and Judea and Persia\r\nwere relatively iron-bound, and early Rome relatively inaccessible.\r\n\r\nFinally, as militarism never spread Spartan-wise over pre-Alexandrian\r\nGreece, and her natural limitations prevented any such exploitation of\r\nlabour as took place in Egypt, the prevailing ideal in times of peace,\r\nat least in Attica, was that of the cultured man, kalokagathos,\r\nsupported by slave labour but not enormously rich, who stimulated art as\r\nhe was stimulated by it. Assuredly he was in many cases a dilettante, if\r\nnot an amateur, else had art been in a worse case.\r\n\r\n     It is to be remembered that in later Greece, from about the time of\r\n     Apelles, all free children were taught to draw (Pliny, _Hist. Nat._\r\n     xxxv, 36, 15); and long before, the same authority tells us, art\r\n     was taken up by men of rank. The introduction of painting into the\r\n     schools at Sicyon took place about 350 B.C., and thence the\r\n     practice spread all over Hellas. Aristotle, too (_Politics_, v\r\n     [viii], 3), commends the teaching of drawing to children, noting\r\n     that it enables men to judge of the arts and avoid blunders in\r\n     picture-buying--though he puts this as an inferior and incidental\r\n     gain. Thus the educated Greeks were in a fairly good sense all\r\n     dilettanti and amateurs. On the whole subject see K.J. Freeman,\r\n     _Schools of Hellas_, 1908, pp. 114-17.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nIn literature Greek development is as clearly consequent as in art. The\r\nHomeric poems are the outcome of a social state in which a class of\r\nbards could find a living by chanting heroic tales to aristocratic\r\nhouseholds. Lyric genius is indeed something specially incalculable; and\r\nit is startling to realise that about the time of the rude rule of\r\nPeisistratos at Athens, Sappho in Lesbos was not merely producing the\r\nperfect lyrics which to this day men reckon unmatched, but was the\r\ncentre of a kind of school of song. But Lesbos was really the home of an\r\nancient culture--\"the earliest of all the AEolic settlements, anterior\r\neven to Kyme\"[330]--and Sappho followed closely upon the lyrists\r\nPittakos and Alkaios. So that here too there is intelligible causation\r\nin environment as well as genius. In other directions it is patent. The\r\ndrama, tragic and comic alike, was unquestionably the outcome of the\r\npublic worship of the Gods, first provided for by the community, later\r\noften exacted by it from rich aspirants to political power. Greek drama\r\nis a clear evolution, on the tragic side, from the primitive ritual of\r\nDionysos, Beer-God or Wine-God; individual genius and communal fostering\r\ncombining to develop a primitive rite into a literary florescence.[331]\r\nFor all such developments special genius is as a matter of course\r\nrequired, but potential genius occurs in all communities in given forms\r\nat a given culture stage; and what happened in Athens was that the\r\nspecial genius for drama was specially appealed to, evoked, and\r\nmaintained. AEschylus in Egypt and Aristophanes in Persia must have died\r\nwith all their drama in them. Further, as Grote has so luminously\r\nshown,[332] the juridical life of Athens, with its perpetual play of\r\nspecial pleading in the dikasteries, was signally propitious to the\r\nspirit of drama. The constant clashing and contrast of ethical points of\r\nview, the daily play of eristic thought, was in itself a real drama\r\nwhich educated both dramatists and audience, and which inevitably\r\naffected the handling of moral problems on the stage. Athens may thus be\r\nsaid to have cultivated discussion as Sparta cultivated \"Laconism\"; and\r\nboth philosophy and drama in Greece are steeped in it. Myths thus came\r\nto be handled on the stage with a breadth of reflection which was\r\nnowhere else possible.\r\n\r\nHistoriography, science, and philosophy, again, were similarly fostered\r\nby other special conditions. Abstract and physical science began for\r\nGreece in the comparison and friction of ideas among leisured men,\r\nthemselves often travelled, living in inquisitive communities often\r\nvisited by strangers. What Egypt and Syria and Phoenicia had to give\r\nin medical lore, in geometry, and in astronomy, was assimilated and\r\nbuilt upon, in an atmosphere of free thought and free discussion, whence\r\ncame all manner of abstract philosophy, analytical and ethical. Plato\r\nand Aristotle are the peaks of immense accumulations of more primitive\r\nthought beginning on the soil laid by Semitic culture in Asia Minor;\r\nSocrates was stimulated and drawn out by the Athenian life on which he\r\ndidactically reacted; Hippocrates garnered the experience of many\r\nmedical priests. History was cultivated under similar conditions of\r\nmanifold intercourse and intelligent inquisitiveness. Herodotus put down\r\nthe outcome of much questioning during many travels, and he had an\r\nappreciative public with similar tastes.[333] The manifold life of\r\nHellas and her neighbours, Egypt, Persia, Syria, was an endless ground\r\nfor inquiry and anecdote. The art of writing, acquired long before from\r\nPhoenicia, was thus put to unparalleled uses; and at length the theme\r\nof the Peloponnesian war, in which all the political passions of Hellas\r\nwere embroiled for a generation, found in Thucydides a historian\r\nproduced by and representative of all the critical judgment of the\r\ncritical Athenian age. Plutarch, in a later period, condenses a library\r\nof lesser writers.\r\n\r\nThus in respect of every characteristic and every special attainment of\r\nGreek life we can trace external causation, from the geographical\r\nconditions upwards, without being once tempted to resort to the\r\nverbalist explanation of \"race qualities\" or \"national genius.\" If\r\nHellas developed otherwise than Phoenicia from any given date onwards,\r\nthe causes lay either in the environment or in the set previously given\r\nto Phoenician life by its special antecedents, which in turn were\r\ndetermined by environment. To suppose that \"the Greeks\" started\r\nprimordially with a unique connatural bent to a relatively \"ideal\"\r\nmethod of life, preferring culture to riches and art to luxury, is to\r\nentail the further assumption of a separate biological evolution from\r\nthe pre-human stage. To put the problem clearly, let us say that if we\r\nsuppose the ancestors of the Greeks three millenniums before Homer to\r\nhave been planted in Australia, with none of the domesticable animals\r\nwhich have played so decisive a part in the development of human\r\nsocieties, there is no good reason to think that the \"race\" would have\r\nrisen to any higher levels than had been reached by the Australian\r\naborigines at the time of their discovery by Europeans. One of the most\r\nremarkable things about those aborigines is their disproportionately\r\nhigh cranial capacity, which seems compatible with a mental life that\r\ntheir natural environment has always precluded. Many plain traces of\r\ngross primeval savagery remain in Greek literature and religion; and to\r\ncredit all Greek progress to a unique racial faculty is to turn the back\r\nupon all the accumulating evidence which goes to show that from the\r\nfirst entrance of the Greeks into Greece they blended with and\r\nassimilated the culture of the races whom they found there.[334] The\r\nfutility of the whole racial thesis becomes evident, finally, the moment\r\nwe reflect how unequal Greek culture was; how restricted in Hellas, how\r\nspecial to Athens was it on the intellectual side when once Athens had\r\nreached her stature; how blank of thought and science was all Hellenic\r\nlife before the contact of Semitic survivals in Ionia; how backward were\r\nmany sections of the pagan Hellenic stock to the last; and how backward\r\nthey have been since the political overturn in antiquity.\r\n\r\n     The vitiating concept of racial genius appears incidentally, but\r\n     definitely, in Dr. Cunningham's contrast of Phoenicians and\r\n     Greeks as relatively wealth-seekers and culture-seekers, ingrained\r\n     barbarians and ingrained humanists (_Western Civilisation_, pp. 72,\r\n     73, 98, 99, etc.), and in his phrase as to the persistent\r\n     \"principles which the Greek and the Phoenician respectively\r\n     represented.\" The antithesis, it is here maintained, is spurious.\r\n     Many Greeks were in full sympathy with the Phoenician norm; many\r\n     Phoenicians must have been capable of delighting in the Greek\r\n     norm had they been reared to it. At a given period the\r\n     Phoenicians had a higher life than the Greeks; and had the\r\n     Phoenicians evolved for ages in the Greek environment, with an\r\n     equivalent blending of stocks and cross-fertilisation of cultures,\r\n     they could have become all that the Greeks ever were. The assertion\r\n     that when we see \"the destruction and degradation of human life in\r\n     the march of material progress, we see what is alien to the Greek\r\n     spirit\" (_id._ p. 99) will not bear examination. Greek slavery,\r\n     like every other, was just such a degradation of human life. And to\r\n     speak of a \"consciousness of her mission\" on the part of \"Athens\"\r\n     (_id._ pp. 72, 73) is to set up a pseudo-entity and a moral\r\n     illusion.\r\n\r\n     It is remarkable that even among students well abreast of\r\n     evolutionary thought there is still a strong tendency to think of\r\n     Greek civilisation in terms of some occult virtue of \"Hellenic\r\n     spirit,\" something unique in social phenomena, something not to be\r\n     accounted for like the process of evolution in other races. Thus so\r\n     accomplished and critical a thinker as Prof. Gilbert Murray seems\r\n     to account for every Greek advance beyond savagery as a result of\r\n     \"Hellenism.\" _E.g._, \"Human sacrifice, then, is one of the\r\n     barbarities which Hellenism successfully overcame\" (_The Rise of\r\n     the Greek Epic_, 1907, p. 16); \"Solved by the progressive, or, I\r\n     may say, by the Hellenic spirit\" (_Id._ p. 25). In this way the\r\n     discrediting and abandonment of the use of poisoned arrows in the\r\n     \"Homeric\" period (_Id._ pp. 120-21) seems to be ascribed either to\r\n     the Homeric or to the Hellenic \"spirit.\"\r\n\r\n     Now, Mr. Murray himself incidentally notes (p. 121) that poisoned\r\n     weapons are forbidden in the Laws of Manu; and it might be pointed\r\n     out that even among the barbaric and ill-advantaged Somali, when\r\n     visited by Burton fifty years ago, the use of poisoned arrows was\r\n     already restricted to \"the servile class\" (_First Footsteps in East\r\n     Africa_, ed. 1910, p. 45; cp. p. 74). The use of poisoned arrows,\r\n     in short, is common in savagery, and is transcended by all races\r\n     alike when they rise some way above that level. The \"Hellenes,\" to\r\n     start with, were savages like the rest, and rose like others in\r\n     virtue of propitious conditions. So with human sacrifice. According\r\n     to Herodotus, the Egyptians had abandoned it before the Greeks.\r\n     Shall we describe the Egyptian progress as a matter of \"Egypticism\"\r\n     or \"the Egyptian spirit\"?\r\n\r\n     Defences of the Greeks, such as that made so ably by Mr. Murray\r\n     against the aspersions cast upon \"Paganism\" by uncritical\r\n     Christians, are to be sympathetically received in the light of\r\n     their purport; but the true historical method is surely not to\r\n     exhibit the historic Greeks as \"antitheses\" to \"the pagan man\" of\r\n     modern anthropology, but to show Christians how they and their\r\n     creed have evolved from savagery even as did the Greeks. (Cp. the\r\n     author's _Christianity and Mythology_, 2nd ed. p. 77 _sq._, as to\r\n     the pro-Hellenic handling of Greek phenomena by other scholars.)\r\n\r\nShould the general line of causation here set forth be challenged, it\r\nwill suffice, by way of test, to turn to the special case of Sparta. If\r\nit were \"Greek character\" that brought forth Greek art, letters, and\r\nscience, they ought to have flourished in Greek Sparta as elsewhere. It\r\nis, however, the notorious historic fact that during all the centuries\r\nof her existence, after the pre-Lycurgean period, Sparta contributed to\r\nthe general deed of man virtually nothing, either in art or letters, in\r\nscience or philosophy.\r\n\r\n     The grounds for holding that choral poetry flourished pre-eminently\r\n     at Sparta (see K.O. Mueller, _History of the Dorians_, Eng. tr. ii,\r\n     383) are not very strong. See Busolt, _Griechische Geschichte_,\r\n     1885, i, 158, 159, for what can be finally said on this head. Ernst\r\n     Curtius (_Griechische Geschichte_, 1858, i, 240) writes on this\r\n     subject as a romantic enthusiast. Burckhardt (_Griechische\r\n     Culturgeschichte_, i, 116-19) examines the subject with his usual\r\n     care, but decides only that the Spartans employed music with a\r\n     special eye to military education. And Mueller acknowledges that\r\n     though many Spartan lyrists are named, \"there has not been\r\n     preserved a single fragment of Spartan lyric poetry, with the\r\n     exception of Alkman's,\" the probable reason being \"a certain\r\n     uniformity and monotony in their productions, such as is perceived\r\n     in the early works of art.\" On the whole question cp. K.J.\r\n     Freeman's _Schools of Hellas_, chs. i and xi.\r\n\r\nIn the story of Hellas, Sparta stands almost alone among the peoples as\r\nyielding no foothold to the life of the mind, bare of nearly all memory\r\nof beauty,[335] indigent in all that belongs to the spirit, morally\r\nsterile as steel. Yet \"the Dorians of Laconia are perhaps the only\r\npeople in Greece who can be said to have preserved in any measure the\r\npurity of their Greek blood.\"[336] Before such a phenomenon the dogma of\r\nrace-character instantly collapses, whereas in terms of the reaction of\r\nconditions the explanation is entirely adequate. As thus:--\r\n\r\n1. Sparta was by situation one of the most secluded of the Greek States.\r\nIn the words of Euripides, it was \"hollow, surrounded by mountains,\r\nrugged, and difficult of access to an enemy.\"[337] Compared in\r\nparticular with Athens, it was not only landward and mountain-walled,\r\nbut out of the way of all traffic.[338]\r\n\r\n2. From the first the Spartans were balanced in a peculiar degree by the\r\nstrength of the Achaians, who were in the Peloponnesus before them, the\r\nhostilities between the invaders and the older inhabitants lasting\r\nlonger in the valley of the Eurotas than anywhere else.[339] The Spartan\r\nmilitarism was thus a special product of circumstances, not a result of\r\nDoric \"character,\" since other Dorian communities did not develop it.\r\n\r\n3. Being thus so little open to commercial influence, and so committed\r\nto a life of militarism, Sparta was susceptible of a rigidity of\r\nmilitary constitution that was impossible elsewhere in the Hellenic\r\nworld, save to some extent in the similarly aristocratic and undeveloped\r\ncommunities of Thessaly and Crete, each similarly noted for\r\nunintellectuality. Whatever be the political origins of these societies,\r\nit is clear that that of Sparta could not have been built up or\r\nmaintained save under conditions of comparative isolation.\r\n\r\n     Grote, always somewhat inclined to racial explanations, argues (ed.\r\n     1888, ii, 262), as against K.O. Mueller, who had still stronger\r\n     leanings of the kind, that the Spartans were not the \"true Doric\r\n     type,\" in that their institutions were peculiar to themselves,\r\n     distinguishing them \"not less from Argos, Corinth, Megara,\r\n     Epidaurus, Sikyon, Korkyra, or Knidus, than from Athens or Thebes.\"\r\n     This is doubtless true as against Mueller (cp. Kopstadt, cited by\r\n     Grote; Cox, _General History of Greece_, 1877, p. 28; and Menard,\r\n     _Histoire des Grecs_, 1884, pp. 218, 221), but the suggestion that\r\n     the Spartans varied in respect of being _less_ \"Doric\" is equally\r\n     astray. Grote goes on to note that \"Krete was the only other\r\n     portion of Greece in which there prevailed institutions in many\r\n     respects analogous, yet still dissimilar in those two attributes\r\n     which form the real mark and pinch of Spartan legislation--viz.,\r\n     the military discipline and rigorous private training. There were\r\n     doubtless Dorians in Krete, but we have no proof that these\r\n     peculiar institutions belonged to them more than to the other\r\n     inhabitants of the island.\" The argument cuts both ways. If it was\r\n     not definitely \"Dorian\" to have such institutions, neither was it\r\n     un-Dorian. As Cox observes (p. 30), the Spartan constitution in its\r\n     earlier stages \"much resembled the constitution of the Achaians as\r\n     described in the _Iliad_.\" Equally arbitrary seems Grote's argument\r\n     (i, 451) that \"the low level of taste and intelligence among the\r\n     Thessalians, as well as certain points of their costume,\r\n     assimilates them more to Macedonians or Epirots than to Hellenes.\"\r\n     He notes the equally low level of taste and intelligence among the\r\n     Spartans, who as a rule could not read or write (ii, 307), and to\r\n     whom he might as well have assimilated the Thessalians as to the\r\n     Macedonians. In all cases alike culture conditions supply the true\r\n     explanation. All through Greece, barring Sparta, stocks were\r\n     endlessly mixed. M. Menard well points out in reply to Mueller that\r\n     it is impossible to associate types of government with any of the\r\n     special \"races\"--that as against Sparta there were \"Ionian\r\n     aristocracies at Marseilles and at Chalkis, and Dorian democracies\r\n     at Tarentum and Syracuse,\" while most of the Greek cities had by\r\n     turns aristocratic and democratic constitutions.\r\n\r\n4. As regards Sparta, the specialisation of all life on the military\r\nside developed a spirit of peculiar separateness and arrogance,[340]\r\nwhich clinched the geographical influence. Where Greeks of all States\r\nwere admitted to the Eleusinian festivals, Sparta kept hers for her own\r\npeople.[341] This would limit her literary mythology, and by consequence\r\nher art.\r\n\r\n     Among the names of Greek sculptors only three belong to Sparta, and\r\n     these are all of the sixth century B.C., the beginning of the\r\n     historic period. After that, nothing. See Radford's _Ancient\r\n     Sculpture_, Chron. List at end. Thus Sparta positively retrogressed\r\n     into militarism. \"There is evidence in the character of Alkman's\r\n     poetry that he did not sing to a Sparta at all resembling the\r\n     so-called Sparta of Lycurgus\" (Mahaffy, _Problems in Greek\r\n     History_, p. 77; cp. Burckhardt, _Griechische Culturgeschichte_, i,\r\n     117).\r\n\r\n5. Not only does military specialism preclude, so far as it goes, more\r\nintellectual forms of activity: it develops in the highest degree the\r\nconservative spirit[342] when thoroughly rooted in law and custom. Nor\r\nis it any more favourable to moral feeling in general.[343]\r\n\r\nAs offset to all this it may be urged that the middle unenfranchised\r\nclass (the _Perioikoi_) in Sparta, the _Penestai_ in Thessaly, and the\r\nordinary citizens in Crete, were in some ways superior types to part of\r\nthe similar classes of Attica; while the slaves, as having some military\r\nlife, were, despite the flavour of the name \"Helot,\" above the\r\naverage.[344] But even if that were so, it would not affect the problem\r\nas to culture development, and its solution in terms of the primary and\r\nsecondary conditions of life for the given communities.\r\n\r\n     It is to be noted that in Crete, less isolated by nature and way of\r\n     life than either Sparta or Thessaly, less rigidly militarised than\r\n     they and more democratic in constitution, there were more stirrings\r\n     of mind. Epimenides, the author of the famous saying that the\r\n     Cretans were always \"liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons,\" was\r\n     himself a distinguished Cretan. But Crete on the whole counts for\r\n     very little in Greek culture-history. Cp. K.J. Freeman, _Schools of\r\n     Hellas_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nSuch being, in brief, the process of the building up of culture for\r\nGreece, it remains to note the causes of the process of retrogression,\r\nwhich also connects broadly with the course of politics. Indeed, the\r\nmere expansion of Hellenistic life set up by the empire-making of\r\nAlexander might alone account for a complete change in the conditions\r\nand phases of Greek civilisation. In the new Hellenistic world wealth\r\nand power were to be won with ease and with amenity[345] where of old\r\nthere was only an alien barbarism, or at least a society which to the\r\ncultured Greek was barbaric. When such cities as Alexandria and Antioch\r\nbeckoned the Greek scholar of small means, impoverished Athens could\r\nhardly retain him. Her extorted revenue in her most powerful\r\nperiod,[346] as we saw, was the source of her highest flight of artistic\r\nsplendour; and even after the Peloponnesian War, with greatly lessened\r\npower, Athens was the most desirable dwelling-place in Hellas. After\r\nAlexander, all this was insensibly changed: Athens, though for a time\r\nfilled with Greeks enriched by the plunder of Persia, must needs\r\ngradually dwindle to the point at which the slight natural advantages of\r\nher soil, industry, and situation would maintain her; and the life of\r\nideas, such as it finally was, passed inevitably to Alexandria, where it\r\nwas systematically encouraged and protected, in the fashion in which\r\nwell-meaning autocrats do such things. But while these new developments\r\nwere not inconsiderable, and included some rare felicities, they were on\r\nthe whole fatally inferior to the old, and this for reasons which would\r\nequally affect what intellectual life was left in Greece proper.\r\n\r\nThe forces of hindrance were political and psychological;[347] and they\r\noperated still more powerfully under the Romans than under the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander. The dominance of the Greeks over the other\r\nraces in the eastern provinces did not make them more than a class of\r\nprivileged tools of Rome; and they deteriorated none the less.[348] When\r\nfor the stimulating though stormy life of factious self-government there\r\nwas substituted the iron hand of a conqueror, governing by military\r\nforce, there was need of a new and intelligent discipline if the mental\r\natmosphere were not to worsen. All civilisation, in so far as it\r\nproceeds from and involves a \"leisured class,\" sets up a perpetual risk\r\nof new morbid phases. Men must have some normal occupation if their life\r\nis to be sound; and where that occupation is not handicraft it can be\r\nkept sound and educative only by the perpetual free effort of the\r\nintelligence towards new truth, new conception, and new\r\npresentment.[349] Nor can this effort conceivably take place on any wide\r\nscale, and with any continuity, save in a community kept more or less\r\ngenerally alert by the agitation of vital issues. For a generation or\r\ntwo after Alexander, it is true, there is no arrest in the production\r\nof good philosophic minds among the Greeks; indeed, the sudden forcing\r\nback of all the best remaining minds on philosophy, as the one mental\r\nemployment left to self-respecting men of leisure,[350] raised the\r\nstandards of the study, and led to the ethical systems of Epicurus and\r\nZeno, certainly fit in their way to stand beside those of Plato and\r\nAristotle. So, too, the thrusting back of the drama (which in the hands\r\nof Aristophanes had meddled audaciously with every public question) on\r\nthe study of private life, developed in the highest degree the domestic\r\nand psychological bent of the later comedy,[351] very much as the\r\nautocracy has developed the novel in contemporary Russia. But the\r\nschools of Epicurus and Zeno, both of which outlasted in moral credit\r\nand in moral efficacy that of Plato,[352] and the new comedy of\r\nMenander, alike represent the as yet unexhausted storage of the mental\r\nenergy generated by the old political life; and the development is not\r\nprolonged in either case. Evidently something vital was lost: only a\r\nrenewal of the freer life could make possible a continuous advance in\r\nintellectual power.\r\n\r\nOn this it is important to insist, as there are plausible grounds for\r\ncontrary inferences, which are often drawn. All supposed exceptions to\r\nthe law, however, will be found on analysis to be apparent only. A\r\ntyranny may indeed give economic encouragement to art and culture, and a\r\nrepublic may fail to do so; but the work of the tyranny is inevitably\r\nundone or kept within a fixed limit by its own character; while, if the\r\nfree community be but fairly well guided, its potentialities are\r\nunlimited. This is the solution of much modern dispute between the\r\nschools of _laissez-faire_ and protection. A Velasquez, who might\r\notherwise have been condemned to seek his market with coarser wares, may\r\ndevelop to perfection at the court of an autocrat of fine taste; but\r\neven he partly depends for his progress on intelligent communion, which\r\nthe autocrat in this case chances to yield him. And from Velasquez\r\nonward there is no progress. So, in autocratic Assyria, sculpture\r\nreaches a certain point and becomes for ever conventionalised. In Egypt\r\nit conforms more or less exactly to the general stereotyping of life. We\r\nmay grant, with some emphatic qualifications, that in some cases \"with\r\nthe tyrant _began_ the building of large temples, ... the patronage of\r\nclever handicrafts, the promoting of all the arts,\"[353] and that he may\r\nhave patronised men of letters; but as regards the temples it is certain\r\nthat in Hellas he was not the chief temple-builder; and it is also quite\r\ncertain that the tyrant never evolved a single generation of important\r\nwriters, thinkers, and artists, any more than of intelligent,\r\nself-respecting, and self-governing citizens. The latter constituted, in\r\nfact, the necessary nutritive soil for the former in the communities of\r\nantiquity.[354] It has been said[355] that \"at the end of the third\r\ncentury of Rome, when its inhabitants had hardly escaped from the hands\r\nof Porsena, Syracuse contained more men of high genius than any other\r\ncity in the world. These were collected at the court of the first Hiero,\r\nduring his short reign of ten years, and among them were the greatest\r\npoets of the age: Pindar ... Simonides ... AEschylus.\" This is true; but\r\nHiero had not been the means of evolving the powers of any one of the\r\nthree. Pindar is manifestly the product of the diversified life of the\r\nfree States; Simonides, though much patronised by aristocrats, began to\r\n\"find himself\" as a chorus teacher at Carthea in Ceos, won countless\r\nprizes at the Greek festivals,[356] and spent only the latter part of\r\nhis life with Hiero; AEschylus is the product of the Attic theatre. Not\r\nthe tyranny, but democracy, had been the _alma mater_. It is true that\r\nAthens after AEschylus played the \"despot city\" in finance, but she so\r\nfar preserved at home the democratic atmosphere, in which, according to\r\nDemosthenes, slaves had more freedom of speech than citizens in many\r\nother places.[357] Lesbos had her oscillations between oligarchy and\r\ndespotism; but the group in which Sappho stood was that of Pittakos and\r\nAlkaios--the elected ten-years dictator who finally laid down his\r\ndictatorship, and the fierce singer who assailed him. Not in the \"Roman\r\npeace\" of a fixed despotism did Lesbian song reach its apex.\r\n\r\n     The old problem of the culture-value of the tyrant has been raised\r\n     afresh by Messrs. Mitchell and Caspari, in their abridgment of\r\n     Grote's _History of Greece_. Grote's enthusiasm for democracy, they\r\n     contend, \"undoubtedly prevented him from doing full justice to much\r\n     that was good in the non-democratic governments of Greece,\"\r\n     notably \"in his estimate of the so-called 'tyrants' of the Greek\r\n     world and in his attitude towards the Macedonian Empire\" (pref. to\r\n     work cited, p. xv). Part of their discussion is beside the case,\r\n     and proves only their general hostility to Grote as \"a\r\n     rationalist,\" to whom \"every problem was a matter for rational\r\n     discussion\" (p. xiii). They first assert that Grote's chapter\r\n     heading, \"Age of the Despots,\" is \"subtly misleading,\" inasmuch as\r\n     there were despots at various periods in Greek history--as has been\r\n     insisted by Professor Mahaffy. Then they avow that \"this fact is\r\n     mentioned by Grote himself,\" and that he \"quite properly\r\n     distinguishes\" between the early and the late tyrannies.\r\n\r\n     The counter-claim is first put in the propositions (1) that an\r\n     early Greek \"tyranny\" was in effect \"a union of one powerful\r\n     personality with the poorer and hitherto unrepresented classes,\"\r\n     favourable to individual life among the latter; and (2) that the\r\n     tyrants by preserving peace and giving the people individual\r\n     freedom of life promoted \"the accumulation of wealth and the\r\n     extension of trade at home and abroad, and enriched the Greek mind\r\n     by familiarising it with the natural and artistic products of other\r\n     lands\" (p. xvii). There is really nothing here that Grote denied;\r\n     nor do the critics attempt to show that he denies it. Grote\r\n     actually said, before them, that \"the demagogue despots are\r\n     interesting as the first evidence of the growing importance of the\r\n     people in political affairs. The demagogue stood forward as\r\n     representing the feelings and interests of the people against the\r\n     governing few.... Even the worst of the despots was more formidable\r\n     to the rich than to the poor; and the latter may perhaps have\r\n     gained by the change....\" (_History_, pt. ii, ch. ix, ed. 1888, ii,\r\n     397). As regards the case of Peisistratos, on which Messrs.\r\n     Mitchell and Caspari chiefly found their plea, Grote notes that his\r\n     \"was doubtless practically milder\" than the average despotism, but\r\n     that \"cases of this character were rare.\" And to _this_ thesis,\r\n     which is backed by an overwhelming mass of Greek testimony, from\r\n     Herodotus to Aristotle and Plato, the critics offer no kind of\r\n     answer.\r\n\r\n     They do, however, claim for \"the tyrants\" in general that \"in the\r\n     first place their orderly government provided _for the first time_\r\n     the conditions which are essential to artistic and literary\r\n     production. Secondly, it was their policy to foster in all possible\r\n     ways everything that contributed to the magnificence of the\r\n     States.\" If it be meant to include under the head of _tyrannoi_ the\r\n     early feudal chieftains before whom the bards chanted, the issue is\r\n     merely confused. If not, the proposition is untenable. If again it\r\n     be argued that the Mausoleum was a finer thing than the Parthenon,\r\n     or quite as well worth having, the real issue is missed.\r\n\r\n     It is significant that Grote's anti-rationalistic critics make no\r\n     attempt to gauge the respective effects of \"tyrannic\" and\r\n     democratic or oligarchic rule on the _inner_ life of men, which is\r\n     what Grote chiefly considered. Neither is this, the vital issue,\r\n     once faced in the essay of Hegewisch \"On the Epoch of Roman History\r\n     most Fortunate for the Human Race\" (French trans. by Solvet, 1834),\r\n     or in the encomiums of Gibbon, Mommsen, and Renan, before cited (p.\r\n     89, _note_). As has been shown above, there is no instance of a new\r\n     and great intellectual development taking its rise or visibly going\r\n     forward (save as at Alexandria under the Ptolemies) under the\r\n     auspices of even a good despot in antiquity; though such a despot\r\n     might at times usefully preserve the peace and cherish writers and\r\n     artists. Here, then, is a sociological clue that should be\r\n     followed. The reasonable inference seems to be that democratic\r\n     conditions, other things being equal, tend most to elicit human\r\n     faculty.\r\n\r\nAnd where in modern times certain of the less democratic nations may be\r\nsaid to have developed certain forms of culture more widely and\r\nenergetically than do certain of the more democratic States--as Germany\r\nher learned class, in comparison with France and England and the United\r\nStates; or modern Russia in comparison with the States in the matter of\r\nthe higher fiction--it can easily be shown (1) that these developments\r\narise not in virtue of but in reaction against autocracy, and (2) that\r\nthey were possible only in virtue of the evocative influence of\r\ncommunities living more freely. Modern communities differ vitally from\r\nthe ancient in that printing has created a species of intercourse which\r\noverleaps all political and geographical restrictions, so that a\r\npolitically tyrannised community can yet receive and respond to the\r\nstimulus of another. But the stimulus is still indispensable. Thus the\r\nintellectual expansion of France after the death of Louis XIV[358] drew\r\ngerminally from the culture of the England of the day; and that of\r\nGermany later in the century was equally a sequence from that and from\r\nthe ferment in France. Given the cluster of independent States, each\r\nwith its court and its university, which made up the Germany of the\r\nperiod, the revived spirit of free thought bore the more and the better\r\nfruit because of the multitude of the reactions involved in the\r\ncircumstances. For the time, the slackened and lightened petty\r\nautocracies counted for intellectual democracy, though even Kant was\r\nmade to feel the pressure of censorship. It was not regal or ducal rule\r\nthat made Lessing or Herder or Schiller or Goethe; and it was not mere\r\nkingly encouragement that bred scholars like Hermann and Wachsmuth and\r\nButtmann and Bekker and Boeckh and Heeren and Ottfried Mueller. The\r\nschool of Tuebingen was the outcome of a movement that proximately began\r\nin English Deism; and even the personal bias of Frederick counted for\r\nmuch less in the evolution than the general contagion of European\r\ndebate. In the University of Berlin, organised after Jena, the inspiring\r\nprinciple was that of intellectual freedom; and the moving spirits took\r\nexpress pains to guard against the tyranny of convention which they saw\r\nruling in the universities of England. For the rest, the production of a\r\nvery large class of scholarly specialists in Germany was made possible\r\nprimarily by the number of universities set up in the days of\r\nseparatism, and secondarily by the absence of such economic conditions\r\n(all resting on possession of coal and maritime situation) as drew\r\nEnglish energy predominantly to industry and commerce. It is true that\r\nif a democratic society to-day does not make express economic provision\r\nfor a scholarly and cultured class, it is likely to lack such, because\r\nthe leisured or idle class in all countries grows less capable of, and\r\nless inclined to, such intellectual production as it contributed to the\r\nserious literature of England during the nineteenth century. But such\r\neconomic provision has been still more necessary in monarchic\r\ncommunities. Finally, at every stage Germany has been reacted upon by\r\nFrance and England; and it is notable that while, in the last\r\ngeneration, under a strengthening militarism and imperialism, the number\r\nof trained German specialists was maintained, the number of Germans able\r\nto stir and lead European thought fell off.[359]\r\n\r\nIn the same way the phenomenon of a group of great novelists in the\r\nautocratic Russia of our own age is no fruit of autocracy, save in the\r\nsense that autocratic government checks all other forms of criticism of\r\nlife, all liberal discussion, and so drives men back on artistic forms\r\nof writing which offer no disturbing social doctrine. And the artistic\r\ndevelopment itself is made possible only by the culture previously or\r\ncontemporaneously accumulated in other and freer communities, from whose\r\nmental life the cultivated Russian draws his. It was to some extent a\r\nsimilar restrictive pressure that specially developed the drama in\r\nFrance under the Third Empire. Apart from the peculiar case of the\r\nItalian cities of the Renaissance, discussed hereinafter, the most that\r\ncan be said for the \"tyrant\" in modern Europe is that Richelieu and\r\nColbert promoted science in France; that the German principalities of\r\nthe eighteenth century fostered music at their courts; that George III\r\ndid much for Handel in England; and that the King of Bavaria did still\r\nmore for Wagner. On the other hand, the system of national and municipal\r\ntheatres on the Continent was an essential adjunct even in this regard;\r\nand the mere comparative freedom accorded to the drama in Elizabethan\r\nEngland, at a time when surplus intellectual energy lacked other\r\nstimuli, sufficed to develop that art in one generation to a degree\r\nnever so speedily reached elsewhere, save in republican Athens. Where\r\nthe \"tyrant\" is most useful is in such a civilisation as that of the\r\nSaracens, for which autocracy is the only alternative to anarchy, and\r\nwhere, on a basis of derived culture, he can protect and rapidly further\r\nthe useful arts and all manner of special studies. But even he cannot\r\ncommand a great intellectual art, or an inwardly great literature.[360]\r\nIt will hardly be pretended that the freethinking which went on in\r\nMoslem Persia and Spain in the eighth and later centuries was evoked by\r\nthe Caliphs, though some of them for a time protected it. The Ptolemies\r\nfor a while fostered science at Alexandria; but under Roman rule--surely\r\nas tyrannous--it died out. And even under the Ptolemies science was a\r\nhothouse plant which never throve in the open.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that first the rule of Alexander and his successors,\r\nand later the rule of Rome, over Greece and the Graecised East, put a\r\ncheck on the intellectual forces there, against which there was no\r\ncounteractive in existence. There remained no other free communities\r\nwhose culture could fecundate that of the Greek and other cities held in\r\ntutelage.\r\n\r\n     The city of Rhodes, which recovered its independence at the death\r\n     of Alexander, and maintained its self-government down till the\r\n     Roman period, was, in point of fact, latterly distinguished for its\r\n     art (Mahaffy, _Greek Life and Thought_, pp. 334-38), thus\r\n     illustrating afresh the value of free life as an art stimulus; but\r\n     its pre-eminently commercial activity, as in the case of Corinth,\r\n     and as later in the case of Venice, kept it relatively\r\n     undistinguished in literature. Rich merchants commissioned pictures\r\n     and statues, but not philosophies or books. Holm (Eng. trans. iv,\r\n     492) calls Rhodes a _seat_ of philosophy, etc., naming Theophrastus\r\n     and Eudemus. But they both studied and settled at Athens.\r\n\r\nFrom the whole history there emerges the demonstration of what might\r\nreasonably be put _a priori_--that for a whole community, once\r\nself-governing, to acquiesce in an all-embracing foreign despotism meant\r\nthe settling of lethargy on half of its mental life.[361] What the\r\nthinkers left in Greece _could_ do was to lend philosophic ideas and\r\nmethod to the jurists at work on the problem of adapting Roman law to\r\nthe needs of a world-empire, and this was done to good purpose; but it\r\nwas the last genuine task that the circumstances permitted of. To\r\ndiscuss vitally the problems of politics would have meant challenging\r\nthe despotism. There remained, it is true, philosophy and the arts; and\r\nthese were still cultivated; but they finally subsisted at the level of\r\nthe spirit of a community which felt itself degenerate from its past,\r\nand so grew soon hopelessly imitative. No important work, broadly\r\nspeaking, can ever be done save by men who, like the most gifted Greeks\r\nof the palmy days (innovating in drama and improving on the science of\r\nthe foreigner), feel themselves capable of equalling or transcending the\r\npast;[362] and that feeling seems to have become impossible alike for\r\nthe students and the sculptors of Greece soon after the Macedonian\r\nconquest, or at least after the Roman. Plato and Pheidias, Aristotle and\r\nPraxiteles, AEschylus and Epicurus, figured as heights of irrecoverable\r\nachievement; and the pupillary generations brooded dreamily over Plato\r\nor drew serenity from Epicurus as their bent lay, and produced statues\r\nof alien rulers, or of the deities of alien temples, where their\r\nancestors had portrayed heroes for the cities and Gods for the shrines\r\nof Greece. Beneath the decadence of spirit there doubtless lay, not\r\nphysiological decay, as is sometimes loosely assumed, but a certain\r\narrest of psychological development--an arrest which, as above\r\nsuggested, may be held to have set in when the life and culture of the\r\n\"family women\" in the Greek cities began decisively to conform to the\r\nAsiatic standard, the men cultivating the mind, while the women were\r\nconcerned only with the passive life of the body. In this one matter of\r\nthe equal treatment of the sexes Sparta transcended the practice of\r\nAthens, her narrow intellectual life being at least the same for both;\r\nand to this element of equilibrium was probably due her long maintenance\r\nof vigour at the level of her ideal.\r\n\r\n     [As, however, the Spartan women, whatever their training, could not\r\n     finally live the martial life of the men, the results of their\r\n     chiefly animal training were not exemplary. See the question\r\n     vivaciously discussed by De Pauw, _Recherches philosophiques sur\r\n     les Grecs_, 1787, ptie. iv, sect. x, Sec. 1--a work which contains\r\n     many acute observations, as well as a good many absurdities. The\r\n     Spartan women, it appears, were in a special degree carried away by\r\n     the Bacchic frenzy. Aelian, _Var. Hist._ iii, 42. Cp. Aristotle,\r\n     _Politics_, ii, 9 (and other testimonies cited by Hermann, _Manual\r\n     of the Political Antiquities of Greece_, Sec. 27, 12), as to their\r\n     general licence.]\r\n\r\nThe arrested psychological development, it need hardly be added, would\r\ntend to mean not merely unoriginal thinking among those who did think,\r\nbut finally a shrinkage of the small number of those who cared greatly\r\nfor thinking. Even in the independent period, the mental life of Greece\r\ndrew perforce from a relatively small class--chiefly the leisured middle\r\nclass and the exceptional artificers or slaves who, in a democratic\r\ncommunity, could win culture by proving their fitness for it. Under the\r\nRoman rule the endowed scholars (sophists) and artists alike would tend\r\nto minister to Roman taste, and as _that_ deteriorated its ministers\r\nwould. Rome, it is easy to see, went the downward intellectual way in\r\nthe imperial age with fatal certainty; and her subject States\r\nnecessarily did likewise at their relative distance. Finally, when\r\nChristianity became the religion of the Empire, all the sciences and all\r\nthe fine arts save architecture and metal-work were rapidly stupefied,\r\nthe Emperor vetoing free discussion in the fifth century, and the Church\r\nlaying the dead hand of convention on all such art as it tolerated, even\r\nas the priesthood of Egypt had done in their day. It is positively\r\nstartling to trace the decline of the fine arts after the second\r\ncentury. On the arch of Constantine, at Rome, all the best sculpture is\r\nan appropriation from the older arch of Trajan: under the first\r\nChristian emperor there are no artists capable of decently embellishing\r\nhis monument in the ancient metropolis. All the forms of higher faculty\r\nseem to have declined together; and as the decay proceeded the official\r\nhostility to all forms of free thought strengthened.\r\n\r\n     [See Finlay, _History of Greece_, as cited, i, 284-85, as to the\r\n     veto on discussion by Theodosius. In the next century Justinian\r\n     suppressed the philosophic schools at Athens. Finlay, in one\r\n     passage (i, 221), speaks of them as nearly extinct before\r\n     suppression; but elsewhere (pp. 277-81) he gives an entirely\r\n     contrary account. There are too many such contradictions in his\r\n     pages. Cp. Hertzberg, _Geschichte Griechenlands seit dem Absterben\r\n     des antiken Lebens_, 1876, i, 78-84.]\r\n\r\nBy the time of Constantine, even the coinage had come to look like that\r\nof a semi-barbarian State; and thought, of course, had already stagnated\r\nwhen Christianity conquered the \"educated\" classes. But these classes\r\nthemselves were speedily narrowed nearly to those of the priests and the\r\nbureaucracy, save in so far as commerce maintained some semi-leisure.\r\nBarbarian invasion and imperial taxation combined in many districts to\r\nexterminate the former leisured and property-owning class. It is indeed\r\nan exaggeration to say that \"the labourer and the artisan alone could\r\nfind bread ... and, with the extinction of the wealthy and educated\r\nclasses, the local prejudices of the lower orders became the law of\r\nsociety.\"[363] But the last clause is broadly true. In this society the\r\npriest, with his purely pietistic tastes and knowledge, became the type\r\nand source of culture.\r\n\r\nA cultured modern Greek apologist of the Byzantine Empire[364] has\r\nanxiously sought to combine with the thesis that Christianity is a\r\ncivilising force, the unavoidable admission that Byzantine civilisation\r\nwas intellectually stationary for a thousand years. It is right that\r\nevery possible plea for that ill-famed civilisation should be carefully\r\nattended to, even when it takes the form of reminding us[365] that after\r\nall the sixth century produced Procopius and Agathias; the seventh,\r\nGeorge of Pisidia; the eighth, John of Damascus; the ninth, Photius; and\r\nso on--one man or two per century who contrived to be remembered without\r\nbeing annalised as emperor. Of rather more importance is the item that\r\nChristian Constantinople at one point, following Egyptian and Roman\r\nprecedent, improved on the practice of heathen Athens, in that the women\r\nof the imperial court and of the upper classes seem to have received a\r\nfair share of what culture there was.[366] It is further a matter of\r\nbare justice to note that Byzantium had all along to maintain itself\r\nagainst the assaults of Persia, of Islam, of barbarism, heathen and\r\nChristian, and of Latin Christendom. But there must all the same be made\r\nthe grieving admission that \"We certainly do not find in the Byzantine\r\nauthors the same depth and originality which mark the ancient writers\r\nwhom they copied\";[367] and that this imitation \"was unhappily the\r\nessential weakness of Byzantine literature.\" That is to say, the\r\nintelligence of the Christian Empire, like that of the Greece of the\r\npost-Macedonian and the Roman domination, looked back to pagan Athens as\r\nto an irrecoverable greatness. In that case, if we are to assume\r\ncomparative equality of culture between the sexes, there is no escape\r\nfrom the conclusion that Christianity was in itself a force of fixation\r\nor paralysis, the subsequent counteraction of which in Europe was a\r\nresult of many causes--of any cause but the creed and lore itself. The\r\ncreed, in fact, was a specific cause of isolation, and so of\r\nintellectual impoverishment. As was well said by Gibbon, the mental\r\nparalysis of the Byzantines was \"the natural effect of their solitary\r\nand insulated state.\"[368] The one civilisation from which Byzantium\r\nmight latterly have profited--the Saracen--was made tabu by creed, which\r\nwas further the efficient cause of the sunderance of Byzantine and\r\nItalian life.\r\n\r\nHad the external conditions, indeed, permitted of the maintenance of the\r\nearlier manifold Empire of Constantine, the mere conditions of social\r\ndiversity which prepared the countless strifes of speculative sects in\r\nEgypt and Syria might have led to intellectual progress, were it only by\r\narousing in the more rational minds that aversion to the madness of all\r\nthe wrangling sects which we detect in Procopius.[369] The disputes of\r\nthe Christians were indeed the most absurd that had ever been carried on\r\nin the Greek tongue; and in comparing the competing insanities it is\r\nhard to imagine how from among themselves they could have evoked any\r\nform of rational thought. But as in Northern Europe in a later age, so\r\nin the Byzantine Empire, the insensate strifes of fanatics, after\r\nexhausting and decimating themselves, might have bred in a saner\r\nminority a conviction of the futility of all wars of creed--this if only\r\nexternal peace could have been secured. But the attacks, first of Persia\r\nand later of Islam, both determined religious enemies, with whom, on\r\nChristian principles, there could be no fruitful intercourse, shore away\r\nall the outlying and diversified provinces, leaving to Byzantium\r\nfinally only its central and most homogeneous section, where the power\r\nof the organised Church, backed by a monarchy bent on spiritual as on\r\npolitical unity, could easily withstand the slight forces of\r\nintellectual variation that remained. The very misfortunes of the\r\nEmpire, connected as they were with so many destructive earthquakes and\r\npestilences,[370] would, on the familiar principle of Buckle, deepen the\r\nhold of superstition on the general mind. On the other hand, the final\r\nChristianising of the Bulgarian and Slav populations on the north, while\r\nsafeguarding the Empire there, yielded it only the inferior and\r\nretarding culture-contact of a new pietistic barbarism, more childish in\r\nthought than itself. We can see the fatality of the case when we\r\ncontemplate the great effort of Leo the Isaurian in the eighth century\r\nto put down image-worship by the arm of the executive. No such effort\r\ncould avail against the mindless superstition of the ignorant mass,\r\nrich[371] and poor, on whom the clerical majority relied for their\r\nexistence. A Moslem conqueror, with outside force to fall back upon,\r\nmight have succeeded; but Leo was only shaking the bough on which he\r\nsat.[372] It seems clear that the Iconoclastic emperors were politically\r\nas well as intellectually progressive in comparison with the orthodox\r\nparty. The worshipped images which they sought to suppress were\r\nartistically worthless, and they aimed at an elevation of the people.\r\n\"If the Iconoclastic reformers had had their way, perhaps the history of\r\nthe agricultural classes would have been widely different. The abolition\r\nof the principle which the first Christian emperors had adopted, of\r\nnailing men to the clod, was part of the programme which was carried out\r\nby the Iconoclastic emperors and reversed by their successors.\"[373]\r\nThus did it come about that Christian Byzantium found the rigid\r\nintellectual equilibrium in which it outlasted, at a lower level of\r\nmental life, the Caliphate which sought its destruction, but only to\r\nfall finally before the more vigorous barbarism of the Turks.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: Whistler, _The Gentle Art of Making Enemies_, 1890, pp.\r\n138, 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: Cp.

The Emperor is really honouring his\r\nown line rather than the artist when he covers him with rewards.... It\r\nis not by making sketches for the Knackfusses to carry out that the\r\nEmperor will raise art in Prussia from its present stagnation, but by\r\nallowing the dangerous breath of liberty to blow through the art world.\r\nThe fine arts are under the drill-sergeant, and produce recruits who\r\nhave everything except art in them.

The fact that such a fructification of an alien\r\ncivilisation could take place while the transmitting community showed no\r\nsimilar gain, is tolerably decisive as to _(a)_ the constrictive force\r\nof religious systems under certain conditions, and _(b)_ the nullity of\r\nthe theory of race genius. Yet these very circumstances have been made\r\nthe ground of a preposterous impeachment of the \"Semitic\" character in\r\ngeneral, and of the Arab in particular.\r\n\r\nConcerning no \"race\" save the Celtic has there been more unprofitable\r\ntheorising than over the Semitic. One continental specialist after\r\nanother[374] has explained Semitic \"faculty\" in terms of Semitic\r\nexperience, always to the effect that a nation has a genius for becoming\r\nwhat it becomes, but only when it has become so, since what it does not\r\ndo it has, by implication, no faculty for doing.[375] The learned\r\nSpiegel, for instance, in his work on the antiquities of Iran,\r\ninexpensively accounts for the Jewish opposition to sculpture as a\r\nmatter of race taste,[376] without even asking how a practice to which\r\nthe race was averse had to be forbidden under heavy penalties, or why\r\nthe same course was held in Aryan Persia. Connecting sculpture with\r\narchitecture, he pronounces the Semites averse to that also; and as\r\nregards the undeniable building tendencies of the Babylonians, he argues\r\nthat we know not \"how far entirely alien models were imitated by the\r\nSemites.\"[377] Only for music does he admit them to have any independent\r\ninclination; and their lack of epos and drama as such is explained, not\r\nby the virtual inclusion of their epopees and early dramatic writings in\r\ntheir Sacred Books, and the later tabu on secular literature, but by\r\nprimordial lack of faculty for epos and drama. The vast development of\r\nimaginative fiction in the _Arabian Nights_ is credited bodily to the\r\n\"Indo-Germanic\" account, because it has Hindu affinities, and took place\r\nin Persia; and, of course, the Semites are denied a mythology, as by M.\r\nRenan, no question being raised as to what is redacted myth in the\r\nSacred Books. For the rest, \"the Semite\" is not fitted to shine in\r\nscience, being in all his branches \"almost totally devoid of\r\nintellectual curiosity,\" so that what philosophy and science he has are\r\nnot \"his own\"; and he is equally ill-fitted for politics, wherein,\r\nhaving no political idea save that of the family, he oscillates between\r\n\"unlimited despotism and complete anarchy.\"[378] Apart from music, his\r\none special faculty is for religion.\r\n\r\nContemporary anti-Semitism may fairly be surmised to underlie in part\r\nsuch performances in pseudo-sociology, which, taken by themselves, set\r\nup a depressing suspicion that numbers of deeply learned specialists\r\ncontrive to spend a lifetime over studies in departments of the history\r\nof civilisation without learning wherein the process of civilisation\r\nconsists. On Spiegel's method--which is that of Mommsen in dealing with\r\nthe early culture-history of Rome--the Germanic nations must be adjudged\r\nto be naturally devoid of faculty for art, architecture, drama,\r\nphilosophy, science, law, and order, since they had none of those things\r\ntill they got them in the Middle Ages through the reviving civilisation\r\nof the Mediterranean and France. And as the Greeks certainly received\r\ntheir first impulse to philosophy and science through contact with the\r\nsurvivals of the old Semitic civilisations in Ionia, they in turn must\r\nbe pronounced to have \"neither a philosophy nor a science of their own\";\r\nwhile the Spartans were no less clearly devoid of all faculty for the\r\nepic and the drama. It is the method of Moliere's doctors, with their\r\n_virtus dormitivus_ of opium, applied to sociology.\r\n\r\nThe method, nevertheless, is steadily popular, and is no less freely\r\napplied to the phenomena of Arab retrogression than to those of\r\nimperfect development in the Semitic life of antiquity, with some\r\nedifying results as regards consistency. Says a French medical writer:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is no such thing as an original Arab medical science. Arab\r\n     medical science was a slavish imitation from the Greek. And the\r\n     same remark is true of all the sciences. The Arabs have never been\r\n     inventors. They are enthusiasts, possessed with a passion for\r\n     anything new, which renders their enthusiasm itself evanescent. And\r\n     in consequence of this incapacity for perseverance, they soon\r\n     forgot the lessons in medical science which they had once acquired\r\n     from the Greeks, and have fallen back into a state of the most\r\n     absolute ignorance.\"[379]\r\n\r\nThe method by which Arab defects are here demonstrated from the arrest\r\nof Arab civilisation is a simple extension of that by which Spiegel\r\ndemonstrates the original deficiencies of the ancient Semites, and\r\nMommsen the incapacity of the Latins to do what they did not do. A\r\ncertain race or nation, having at one time attained a considerable\r\ndegree of civilisation, and afterwards lost it, is held to have thus\r\nshown a collective incapacity for remembering what \"it\" or \"they\" had\r\nlearned. The \"they\" here is the correlative of M. Taine's \"we\"--a\r\npseud-entity, entirely self-determining and strictly homogeneous. The\r\nracial misfortune is set down to a fault pervading the whole national\r\ncharacter or intellect, and peculiar to it in comparison with other\r\nnational characters. Conditions count for nothing; totality of inherited\r\ncharacter, acting _in vacuo_, is at once the summary and the judgment.\r\nAnyone who has followed the present argument with any assent thus far\r\nwill at once grant the futility of such doctrine. \"The Arabs\" had\r\nneither more nor less collective faculty of appreciation and oblivion\r\nthan any other equally homogeneous people at the same culture-stage. It\r\nis quite true that they had not an \"original medical science.\" But\r\nneither have any other historical \"they\" ever had such. The Greeks\r\ncertainly had not. The beginnings of medical knowledge for all mankind\r\nlay of necessity in the primeval lore of the savage; and the nations\r\nwhich carried it furthest in antiquity were just those who learned what\r\nothers had to give, and improved upon it. The Greeks must have learned\r\nfrom Asia, from Egypt,[380] from Phoenicia; and the Romans learned\r\nfrom the Greeks. The Arabs, coming late into the sphere of the higher\r\ncivilisation, and crossing their stock in the East with those of Persia,\r\nin the West with the already much-mixed stocks of Spain, passed quite as\r\nrapidly as the Greeks had done from the stage of primitive thought in\r\nall things to one of comparative rationality as regards medicine and\r\nthe exact sciences; and this not in virtue of any special \"enthusiasm\"\r\nfor new ideas, but by the normal way of gradual collection of\r\nobservations and reflection upon them, in communities kept alert by\r\nvariety of intercourse, and sufficiently free on the side of the\r\nintellectual life. Such was the state of the Saracens in Persia and\r\nSpain in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries; and their social\r\nevolution before and after is all a matter of natural sequence, not\r\nproceeding upon any peculiarity of collective character, but\r\nrepresenting the normal reactions of character at a given culture-stage\r\nin special political circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhat is peculiar to the Saracen civilisation is its sudden origin\r\n(taking Islam as a history by itself)[381] under conditions reached\r\nelsewhere only as climax in a long evolution. The rise of Islam has the\r\ntwofold aspect of a barbarian campaign of plunder and a crusade of\r\nfanaticism; and though the prospect and the getting of plunder were\r\nneeded to ripen the fanaticism to full bloom,[382] the latter was\r\nultimately a part of the cementing force that turned a horde into a\r\ncommunity. The great facilitating conditions for both were the feeble\r\ncentralised system maintained by the Christianised Empire, and the\r\ndisintegrating force of Christianity as a sectarian ferment. In Egypt,\r\nfor instance, the hatred between rival schools of Christian metaphysic\r\nsecured for the Arabs an unresisted entrance into Alexandria.[383] It\r\nneeded only a few generations of contact with higher culture in a richer\r\nenvironment to put the Saracens, as regards art and science, very much\r\non a level with the stagnating Byzantines; and where the latter,\r\npossessed of their scientific and philosophical classics, but imprisoned\r\nby their religion, made no intellectual progress whatever, the former,\r\non the same stimulus, progressed to a remarkable degree. There has been\r\nmuch dispute as to the exact measure of their achievements; but three\r\nthings are clear: (1) that they carried the mathematics of astronomy\r\nbeyond the point at which it had been left by the Greeks; (2) that they\r\nlaid the foundations of chemistry; and(3) that they intelligently\r\ncarried on surgery and medicine when the Byzantines, having early in the\r\nChristian period destroyed the Asklepions, which were in some degree\r\nthe schools of the medicine of antiquity, had sunk to the level of using\r\nprayers and incantations and relics as their regular means of cure.\r\nCuriously enough, too, the Saracens had the merit, claimed for the\r\nByzantines, of letting their women share rather freely in their culture\r\nof all kinds.[384] What is more, the later Saracens of Spain, whatever\r\nthe measure of their own scientific progress, were without question a\r\ngreat seminal force in the civilisation of Western Christendom, which\r\ndrew from them its beginnings in mathematics, philosophy, chemistry,\r\nastronomy, and medicine, and to some extent even in literature[385] and\r\narchitecture,[386] to say nothing of the effect on the useful arts of\r\nthe contact of the Crusaders with the Saracens of the East.\r\n\r\n     As to Arab medicine, see Withington, as cited, pp. 139, 170; and\r\n     Sprengel, _History of Medicine_, French tr. vol. ii (1815), pp.\r\n     262-64--a passage which contradicts Sprengel's previous\r\n     disparagements. Compare p. 343. The _histoire particuliere_ in this\r\n     chapter (v of Sect. 6) generally countervails the hostile\r\n     summaries. Sprengel proceeded on the prejudice (i, 215) that there\r\n     was no \"rational science\" anywhere before the Greeks; as if there\r\n     were not many irrational elements in the science not only of the\r\n     Greeks but of the moderns. A much better qualified historian of\r\n     Arab medicine, Dr. Lucien Leclerc, writes (_Histoire de la medecine\r\n     arabe_, 1876, i, 462) that in the eleventh century \"the medical\r\n     productions [of the Arabs] continue to develop an independent\r\n     aspect, and have already a certain stamp of originality. Already\r\n     the Arabs feel themselves rich on their own footing. We see\r\n     appearing certain writings not less remarkable for the novelty of\r\n     the form than for the value of the substance.\" Again, Dr. Ernst von\r\n     Meyer, the historian of chemistry, sums up (_Hist. of Chemistry_,\r\n     M'Gowan's tr. 2nd ed. p. 28), that \"the germs of chemical knowledge\r\n     attained to a marvellous growth among the Arabians.\" It may be\r\n     noted that there is record of a hospital in Bagdad at the beginning\r\n     of the ninth century, and that there were many there in the tenth\r\n     (Leclerc, i, 559).\r\n\r\n     A rational argument is brought against Semitic \"faculty\" by Dr.\r\n     Cunningham, it should be admitted, in the contention that the\r\n     Phoenicians figured poorly as copyists of Greek art (_Western\r\n     Civilisation_, p. 69, following Renan). But this argument entirely\r\n     ignores the element of time that is needed to develop any art in\r\n     any civilisation. The Phoenician civilisation was overthrown\r\n     before it had time to assimilate Greek art developments, which\r\n     themselves were the work of centuries even in a highly favourable\r\n     set of conditions. Noeldeke, though less unscientific than Spiegel,\r\n     partly follows him in insisting that Phoenician architecture\r\n     copied Egyptian, and that the later Semites copied the Greek, as if\r\n     the Greeks in turn had not had predecessors and guides. Starting\r\n     with the fixed fallacy that the Semites were \"one-sided,\" he\r\n     reasons in a circle to the effect that their one-sidedness was\r\n     \"highly prejudicial to the development of science,\" while compelled\r\n     to admit the importance of the work of the Babylonians in\r\n     astronomy. (_Sketches from Eastern History_, Eng. tr. pp. 15-18.)\r\n\r\nIt is now current doctrine that \"for nearly eight centuries, under her\r\nMohammedan rulers, Spain set to all Europe a shining example of a\r\ncivilised and enlightened State. Her fertile provinces, rendered doubly\r\nprolific by the industry and engineering skill of her conquerors, bore\r\nfruit an hundredfold. Cities innumerable sprang up in the rich valleys\r\nof the Guadalquivir and the Guadiana.... Art, literature, and science\r\nprospered as they prospered nowhere else in Europe. Students flocked\r\nfrom France and Germany and England to drink from the fountain of\r\nlearning which flowed only in the cities of the Moors. The surgeons and\r\ndoctors of Andalusia were in the van of science; women were encouraged\r\nto devote themselves to serious study; and the lady doctor was not\r\nunknown among the people of Cordova. Mathematics, astronomy and botany,\r\nhistory[?], philosophy and jurisprudence[?] were to be mastered in\r\nSpain, and Spain alone. The practical work of the field, the scientific\r\nmethods of irrigation, the arts of fortification and shipbuilding, the\r\nhighest and most elaborate products of the loom, the graver and the\r\nhammer, the potter's wheel and the mason's trowel, were brought to\r\nperfection by the Spanish Moors.\"\r\n\r\n     See Stanley Lane-Poole, _The Moors in Spain_, pref. It could be\r\n     wished that Mr. Lane-Poole had given English readers, as he so well\r\n     could, a study of Saracen civilisation, instead of a \"Story of the\r\n     Nation\" on the old lines.

The Arab civilisation was\r\narrested and anchylosed by forces which in other civilisations operated\r\nin exactly the same modes. The first great trouble was the element of\r\nperpetual domestic strife, which was uncured by the monarchic system,\r\nsince every succession was liable to dispute. Under such conditions just\r\ngovernment could not flourish; and Moslem taxation always tended to be\r\nsuicidally unscrupulous.[387] Disputes of succession, indeed, wrought\r\nhardly more strife among the Saracens than has taken place among Greeks\r\nand Romans, and Christians of all nations, down to modern times; even\r\nthe ecclesiastical and feudal doctrine of legitimacy, developed by the\r\nLatin and Greek Churches, having failed to prevent dynastic wars in\r\nChristendom. But the Saracens, neighboured everywhere by Christians who\r\nbore them a twofold hostility, had peculiar need of union, and ran\r\nspecial risks from dissension; and in Spain their disunion was their\r\nruin. At the same time their civilisation was strangled intellectually\r\nby a force which, though actually in operation in Christendom also, was\r\nthere sufficiently countered by a saving condition which the Saracens\r\nfinally lacked. The force of constriction was the cult of the Sacred\r\nBook; the counteracting force in Christendom was diversity and friction\r\nof governments and cultures--a condition which passed out of the Saracen\r\nequation.\r\n\r\nHow fatally restrictive the cult of the completed Sacred Book can be is\r\nobvious in the history of Byzantium. It was in terms of the claims of\r\nthe Christian creed that the Eastern Emperors proscribed pagan\r\nphilosophy and science, reducing the life of the whole Eastern world as\r\nfar as possible to one rigid and unreasoned code. That the mental life\r\nof Italy and France was relatively progressive even in the Middle Ages\r\nwas substantially due--(1) to Saracen stimulus, and (2) to the friction\r\nand ferment set up by the diversity of life in the Italian republics,\r\nand the Italian and French and German universities. Byzantium was in\r\ncomparison a China or an Egypt. The saving elements of political\r\ndiversity, culture competition, and culture contact have in later Europe\r\ncompleted the frustration of the tendency of church, creed, and Bible\r\nto destroy alike science and philosophy. In Islam, on the other hand,\r\nthe arresting force finally triumphed over the progressive because of\r\nthe social and political conditions. (1) The political field, though\r\nstormy, finally lacked diversity in terms of the universality of the\r\nmonarchic principle, which was imposed by the military basis and bound\r\nup with the creed: uniformity of ideal was thus furthered. (2) There was\r\npractically no fresh culture contact possible after the assimilation of\r\nthe remains of Greek science and the stimulus of Jewish philosophy; for\r\nmedieval Christendom had no culture to give; and the more thoroughly the\r\nPapacy and the Christian monarchy in Spain were organised, the more\r\nhostile they grew to the Moors. (3) The economic stimulus among the\r\nlatter tended to be restricted more and more to the religious class,\r\ntill that class was able to suppress all independent mental activity.\r\n\r\nThe last is the salient circumstance. In any society, the special\r\ncultivation of serious literature and the arts and sciences depends on\r\none or more of three conditions--(_a_) the existence of a cultured class\r\nliving on unearned incomes, as in ancient Athens, middle Rome, and\r\nmodern England and France; (_b_) public expenditure on art and culture,\r\nas in ancient Athens, Renaissance Italy and modern France, and in the\r\nGerman university system _par excellence_; or (_c_) the personal concern\r\nof princes and other patrons to encourage ability. In the nature of the\r\ncase it was mainly on this last and most precarious stimulus that\r\nSaracen culture depended. Taking it at its zenith, under such rulers as\r\nHaroun Alraschid and El-Mamoun at Bagdad, and Abderrahman III and\r\nHakam II of Cordova, we find its advance always more or less dependent\r\non the bounty of the caliph; and even if, like Abderrahman and his\r\nson Hakam, he founded all manner of public and free schools, it depended\r\non the bias of his successors rather than on public opinion or municipal\r\ncustom whether the movement should continue. Abderrahman's\r\nachievement, seen even through Christian eyes, was so manifold as to\r\nconstitute him one of the great rulers of all history; but the task of\r\nmaking Moorish civilisation permanent was one which no series of such\r\nstatesmen could have compassed. The natural course of progress would\r\nhave been through stable monarchy to constitutionalism. But Christian\r\nbarbarism, with its perpetual assault, kept the Saracens forever at the\r\nstage of active militarism, which is the negation of constitutionalism;\r\nand their very refinement was a political danger, no less than their\r\ndynastic strifes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the continuous stress of militarism was in ordinary\r\ncourse much more favourable to fanaticism than to free thought; and to\r\nfanaticism the Koran, like the Bible, was and is a perpetual stimulant.\r\nIt was as a militant faith that Islam maintained itself; and in such a\r\ncivilisation the Sacred Book, which claimed to be the highest of all\r\nlore, and was all the while so easy a one, giving to ignorance and\r\nconceit the consciousness of supreme knowledge without any mental\r\ndiscipline whatever, was sure of abundant devotees.[388] In an\r\nuninstructed community--and of course the mass of the Saracen population\r\nwas uninstructed[389]--the cult of the Sacred Book needs no special\r\nendowment; it can always be depended on to secure revenues for itself,\r\neven as may the medicine-man in an African tribe. To this day the\r\npropagation of the Koran is subscribed for in Turkey as the Bible\r\nSociety is subscribed to among ourselves, ignorance earning thus the\r\nfelicity of prescribing for human welfare in the mass, and at the same\r\ntime propitiating Omnipotence, at the lowest possible outlay of study\r\nand reflection. Enthusiasms which can thus flourish in the twentieth\r\ncentury were of course abundant in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh;[390]\r\nand thus we find that when a caliph was suspected by the pietists of\r\ncaring too little for their lore, he ran the risk of being rebelled\r\nagainst with a speed and zeal in the ratio of their conviction of divine\r\nknowledge. Islam, unlike the State churches of Greece, Rome, and\r\nEngland, has democratic rootage in the practice of setting ordinary\r\nlaymen to recite the prayers and preach the sermons in the mosques: it,\r\nin fact, resembles Methodism more than any of the established Christian\r\nchurches in respect of its blending of clerisy and laity. Such a system,\r\nwhen thoroughly fanaticised, has enormous powers of turbulence; and in\r\nMoorish Spain we find them early exercised. Abderrahman I, whose\r\npolicy of tolerance towards Jews and Christians transcended all previous\r\nChristian practice, and thus won for his realm a great stimulus in the\r\nway of variety of culture-elements and of industry, had kept the\r\nreligious class in due control; but his well-meaning son Hisham was\r\npriest-ridden to the last degree; and when his successor Hakam showed an\r\nindisposition to patronise pietists to the same extent they raised\r\nrevolt after revolt (806-815), all put down by massacre.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lane-Poole notes (p. 73) the interesting fact that the\r\n     theologers were largely of Spanish stock, the natives having in\r\n     general embraced Islam. Thus the fanaticism of the Berbers was\r\n     reinforced by that of the older population, which, as Buckle\r\n     showed, was made abnormally devout, not by inheritance of\r\n     character, but by the constant effect of terrorising environment,\r\n     in the form of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the situation remained fundamentally unchanged; and when\r\nthe Moorish military power began to feel more and more the pressure of\r\nthe strengthening Christian foe, it lay in the nature of the case that\r\nthe fanatical species should predominate. The rationalistic and\r\nindifferent types would figure as the enemies of their race, very much\r\nas such types would have done in Covenanting Scotland. At length, in the\r\neleventh century, the weakened Moorish princes had to call in the aid of\r\nthe fanatical Almoravides from Barbary; and these, with the full support\r\nof the priesthood and the pious, established themselves at the head of\r\naffairs, reducing everything as far as possible to the standards of the\r\neighth century.[391] And when the new barbarism in time grew corrupt, as\r\nthat of the Goths and Vandals had done in earlier ages, the \"Unitarian\"\r\nAlmohades in turn (twelfth century) overthrew the Almoravides in Spain\r\nas they had already done in Africa, only to be themselves overthrown a\r\nhundred years later by the Christians. Thereafter the curtailed Moorish\r\npower, pent up in Southern Spain, reverted to the spirit of fanaticism\r\nwhich national failure generates in religious minds; and from the\r\nthirteenth century to the final overthrow at the end of the fifteenth\r\nthe intellectual life of Saracen Spain was but a long stagnation.\r\n\r\nA civilisation driven back on superstition and fanaticism[392] thus gave\r\nway to a revived barbarism, which itself, after a few centuries of\r\npower, was arrested in its progress by the same order of forces, and has\r\never since remained in the rear of European development. A remarkable\r\nexception, indeed, is to be noted in the case of Ibn Khaldun\r\n(1332-1406), who in the narrow world of Tunis attained to a grasp of the\r\nscience of history such as no Christian historian up to his time had\r\nremotely approached.[393] Such an intellectual phenomenon sufficiently\r\ndisposes of the current formulas about the innate incapacities of \"the\r\nSemitic mind.\" But whether it were that he dared not say what he\r\nthought of the fatal influence of the Sacred Book, or that on that side\r\nhe was really, as he is ostensibly, quite uncritical, Khaldun fails, in\r\nhis telling survey of Arab decadence, to set forth the decisive\r\ncondition of intellectual arrest; and his luminous impeachment of the\r\ncivilisation of his race failed to enlighten it.\r\n\r\nIn Persia the same forces wrought closely similar results. The Greek\r\nstimulus, after working wonders in science and rational thought, failed\r\nto sustain a society that could not politically evolve beyond despotism;\r\nand economic evil and intellectual decay together undermined the empire\r\nof the Caliphs,[394] till the Turks could overrun it as the Christians\r\ndid Moorish Spain; they themselves, however, adding no new culture\r\ndevelopments, because under them no new culture contacts were possible.\r\n\r\nOf the Moslem civilisation as a whole, it must be said that on the\r\nmaterial side, in Spain and the East, it was such a success as had not\r\nbeen attained under the Romans previously (though it was exceeded in\r\nEgypt by the Lagids), and has not been reached in Christian Spain since\r\nthe fall of Boabdil. Economically, the Moorish regimen was sound and\r\nstable in comparison with that of imperial Spain, which, like Rome,\r\nmerely set up a factitious civilisation on the basis of imported bullion\r\nand provincial tribute, and decayed industrially while nominally growing\r\nin empire and power. When the history of Spain from the seventeenth\r\ncentury onward is compared with that of the Saracens up to their\r\noverthrow, the nullity of explanations in terms of race qualities\r\nbecomes sufficiently plain--unless, indeed, it is argued that Moorish\r\nblood is the secret of Spanish decadence. But that surmise too is folly.\r\nSpanish decadence is a perfectly simple sociological sequence;[395] and\r\na Spanish renascence is not only conceivable, but likely, under\r\nconditions of free science and free thought. Nor is it on the whole less\r\nlikely that the Arab stock will in time to come contribute afresh and\r\nlargely to civilisation. The one element which can finally distinguish\r\none race from another--acquired physiological adaptation to a given\r\nclimate--marks the Arab races as best fitted for the recovery of great\r\nsouthern and eastern regions which, once enormously productive, have\r\nsince the fall of the Roman and Byzantine Empires been reduced to\r\nsterility and poverty. The Greeks in their recovered fatherland, and the\r\nFrench in Algeria, have not thus far been much more successful than the\r\nTurks in developing material prosperity. If North Africa, Syria, and\r\nMesopotamia are again to be rich and fruitful lands, it must be in the\r\nhands of an acclimatised race; and the Arab stocks are in this regard\r\namong the most eligible.\r\n\r\nBut there is no reason why the Turks should not share in such a\r\nrenascence.[396] Their incivilisation is no more a matter of race\r\ncharacter than the decline of the Moors or the backwardness of the\r\nSpaniards: it is the enforced result of the attitude of special enmity\r\ntaken up towards the Turkish intruders from the first by all their\r\nChristian neighbours. By sheer force of outside pressure, co-operating\r\nwith the sinister sway of the Sacred Book, Turkey has been kept\r\nfanatical, barbarous, uncultured, utterly militarist, and therefore\r\nfinancially misgoverned. The moral inferiority of the long-oppressed\r\nChristian peoples of the Levant, whose dishonesty was till lately\r\nproverbial, was such as to strengthen the Moslem in the conceit of\r\nsuperiority; while the need to maintain a relatively great military\r\nforce as against dangerous neighbours has been for him a check upon all\r\nendowment of culture. To change all this, it needs that either force or\r\nprudence should so modify the system of government as to give freer\r\ncourse to industry and ideas; that the military system should be\r\nrestricted; and that European knowledge should be brought to bear on\r\neducation, till the fettering force of religion is frustrated, as in the\r\nprogressive countries of Christendom. For Turkey and Spain, for Moslems\r\nand for Christians, the laws of progress and decadence are the same; and\r\nif only the more fortunate peoples can learn to help instead of\r\nhindering the backward, realising that every civilisation is\r\nindustrially and intellectually an aid to every other, the future course\r\nof things may be blessedly different from that of the past. But the\r\nclosest students of the past will doubtless be as a rule slow to predict\r\nsuch a transformation.[397]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: Cp. the author's criticism of Dr. Pulszky, in _Buckle and\r\nhis Critics_, p. 509.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: Thus Milman decides that the Mahommedan civilisation is\r\n\"the highest, it should seem, _attainable_ by the Asiatic _type of\r\nmind_\" (_Latin Christianity_, 4th ed. ii, 222).

They are certainly obvious\r\nenough. By reason of the primary natural direction of Roman life to\r\nplunder and conquest, with a minimum of commerce and peaceful contacts,\r\nRoman culture was as backward as that of Greece was forward. The early\r\nEtruscan culture having been relegated to the status of archaeology,\r\nhowever respectfully treated,[398] and the popular language having\r\nbecome that of all classes, the republican period had to begin again at\r\nthe beginning. Latin literature practically commenced in the third\r\ncentury B.C., when that of Greece was past its meridian; and the fact\r\nthat Lucius Andronicus and Naevius, the early playwrights, were men of\r\nGreek culture, and that Ennius translated the Greek rationalist Evemeros\r\n(Euhemeros), point to the Hellenic origins of Rome's intellectual life.\r\nHer first art, on the other hand, was substantially derived from the\r\nEtruscans, who also laid the simple beginnings of the Roman drama, later\r\nbuilt upon under Greek influence. But even with the Etruscan\r\nstimulus--itself a case of arrested development--the art went no great\r\nway before the conquest of Greece; and even under Greek stimulus the\r\nliterature was progressive for only two centuries, beginning to decline\r\nas soon as the Empire was firmly established.\r\n\r\nOf the relative poverty of early Roman art, the cause is seen even by\r\nMommsen to lie partly in the religious environment, religion being the\r\nonly incentive which at that culture stage could have operated (and this\r\nonly with economic fostering); but the nature of the religious\r\nenvironment he implicitly sets down as usual to the character of the\r\nrace,[399] as contrasted with the character of the Greeks. Obviously it\r\nis necessary to seek a reason for the religious conditions to begin\r\nwith; and this is to be found in the absence from early Rome of exactly\r\nthose natural and political conditions which made Greece so manifold in\r\nits culture. We have seen how, where Greece was divided into a score of\r\nphysically \"self-contained\" states, no one of which could readily\r\noverrun the others, Rome was placed on a natural career of conquest; and\r\nthis at a culture stage much lower than that of Ionic Greece of the same\r\nperiod. Manifold and important culture contacts there must have been for\r\nHellenes before the Homeric poems were possible; but Rome at the\r\nbeginning of the republican period was in contact only with the other\r\nItalic tribes, the Phoenicians, the Grecian cities, and the Etruscans;\r\nand with these her relations were hostile. In early Ionia, again, Greek\r\npoetry flourished as a species of luxury under a feudal system\r\nconstituted by a caste of rich nobles who had acquired wealth by\r\nconquest of an old and rich civilisation. Roman militarism began in\r\nagricultural poverty; and the absorption of the whole energies of the\r\ngroup in warfare involved the relegation of the arts of song and poetry\r\nto the care of the women and boys, as something beneath adult male\r\nnotice.[400] Roman religion in the same way was left as a species of\r\narchaeology to a small group of priests and priestly aristocrats, charged\r\nto observe the ancient usages. It would thus inevitably remain\r\nprimitive--that is, it would remain at a stage which the Greeks had\r\nmostly passed at the Homeric period; and when wealth and leisure came,\r\nGreek culture was there to over-shadow it. To say that the Latins\r\nracially lacked the mythopoeic faculty is to fall back on the old plan\r\nof explaining phenomena in terms of themselves. As a matter of fact, the\r\nmere number of deities, of personified forces, in the Roman mythology is\r\nvery large,[401] only there is lacking the embroidery of concrete\r\nfiction which gives vividness to the mythology of the Greeks. The Romans\r\nrelatively failed to develop the mythopoeic faculty because their\r\nconditions caused them to energise more in other ways.[402]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, obvious reason to believe that among the Italian\r\npeoples there was at one time a great deal more of myth than has\r\nsurvived.[403] What is preserved is mainly fragments of the mythology of\r\none set of tribes, and that in only a slightly developed form. All the\r\nother Italic peoples had been subdued by the Romans before any of them\r\nhad come into the general use of letters;[404] and instead of being put\r\nin a position to develop their own myths and cults, or to co-ordinate\r\nthe former in the Greek fashion, they were absorbed in the Roman system,\r\nwhich took their Gods to its pantheon, and at the same time imposed on\r\nthem those of Rome. Much of their mythic lore would thus perish, for the\r\nliterate Romans had not been concerned to cultivate even their own.\r\nEarly Roman life being divided between war and agriculture, and there\r\nbeing no free literary class to concern itself with the embellishment of\r\nthe myths, there subsisted only the simple myths and rituals of\r\nagriculture and folklore, the numerous list of personified functions\r\nconnected with all the phases of life, and the customary ceremonial of\r\naugury and invocation in war. The augurs and pontifices were the public\r\nmen and statesmen, and they made religion a State function. What occult\r\nlore there was they made a class monopoly--an effectual preventive in\r\nitself of a Hellenic development of myth. Apart from the special sets or\r\ncolleges of priests there were specially appointed colleges of\r\nreligio-archaeological specialists--first, the six augurs and the five\r\n_pontifices_, then the _duoviri sacris faciundis_, afterwards increased\r\nto ten and to fifteen, who collected Greek oracles and saw to the\r\nSibylline books; later the twenty _fetiales_ or heralds, and so on.\r\n\"These colleges have been often, but erroneously, confounded with the\r\npriesthoods. The priesthoods were charged with the worship of a specific\r\ndivinity; the skilled colleges, on the other hand, were charged with the\r\npreservation of traditional rules regarding the more general religious\r\nobservances.... These close corporations supplying their own vacancies,\r\nof course from the ranks of the burgesses, became in this way the\r\ndepositaries of skilled arts and sciences.\"[405]\r\n\r\nReligion being thus for centuries so peculiarly an official matter of\r\nsettled tradition, no unauthorised myth-maker could get a hearing. Even\r\nwhat was known would be kept as far as possible a corporation\r\nsecret,[406] as indeed were some of the mystery practices in Egypt and\r\nGreece. But whereas in Greece the art of sculpture, once introduced, was\r\nstimulated by and reacted on mythology in every temple in every town,\r\nthe rigid limitation of early Roman public life to the business of war\r\nwould on that side have closed the door on sculpture,[407] even if it\r\ncould otherwise have found entrance. The check laid on the efflorescence\r\nof the religious instinct was a double check on the efflorescence of\r\nart. The net result is described with some exaggeration by an eminent\r\nmythologist, in a passage which reduces to something like unity of idea\r\nthe tissues of contradiction spun by Mommsen:--\r\n\r\n     For the Latins their Gods, although their name was legion, remained\r\n     mysterious beings without forms, feelings, or passions; and they\r\n     influenced human affairs without sharing or having any sympathy\r\n     with human hopes, fears, or joys. Neither had they, like the Greek\r\n     deities, any society among themselves. There was for them no\r\n     Olympos where they might gather and take counsel with the father of\r\n     Gods and men. They had no parentage, no marriage, no offspring.\r\n     They thus became a mere multitude of oppressive beings, living\r\n     beyond the circle of human interests, yet constantly interfering\r\n     with it; and their worship was thus as terrible a bondage as any\r\n     under which the world has yet suffered. Not being associated with\r\n     any definite bodily shapes, they could not, like the beautiful\r\n     creations of the Greek mind, promote the growth of the highest art\r\n     of the sculptor, the painter, and the poet.[408]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to make some corrections and one expansion. The\r\nstatement as to parentage, marriage, and offspring is clearly wrong. Cox\r\nhere follows Keightley, whose pre-scientific view is still common.\r\nKeightley admits that the early Latin Gods and Goddesses occur in pairs,\r\nas Saturn and Ops, Janus and Jana; and that they were called _Patres_\r\nand _Matres_.[409] To assert after this that they were never thought of\r\nas generating offspring, merely because the bulk of the old\r\nfolk-mythology is lost, is to ascribe uncritically to the Latins an\r\nabstention from the most universal forms of primitive myth-making. The\r\nproposition as to \"terrible bondage,\" again, cannot stand historically;\r\nfor, to say nothing of the religions of Mexico and Palestine, and some\r\nof those of India, the Roman life was certainly much less darkened by\r\ncreed than has been that of many Christian countries, for instance\r\nProtestant Scotland and Catholic Spain.\r\n\r\n     [M. Boissier (_La religion romaine_, i, 2) decided that the Romans\r\n     were religiously ruled more by fear than hope, and that their\r\n     worship consisted chiefly of \"timid supplications and rigorous\r\n     expiations.\" Mommsen, on the other hand (ch. xii, p. 191),\r\n     pronounces that \"the Latin religion was grounded mainly on man's\r\n     enjoyment of earthly pleasures.\" Both statements would be equally\r\n     true of all ancient religions. Compare M. Boissier's later remarks,\r\n     pp. 21-25, 26, 28, wherein he contradicts himself as does Mommsen.]\r\n\r\nAs regards, again, the failure of the early Latin pantheon to stimulate\r\nsculpture and poetry, it has to be noticed that sculpture and poetry\r\ntended to make as well as to be made by mythology in Greece. The\r\nargument against the Latin pantheon is in fact an argument in a circle.\r\nIf the Latin Gods were not \"associated with any definite bodily shapes\"\r\n(parentage, marriage, and offspring they certainly _had_), it could only\r\nbe when and _because_ they were not yet sculptured. Greek Gods before\r\nthey were sculptured would be conceived just as variably. Were _they_\r\nthen thought of as formless? The proposition is strictly inconceivable.\r\nLatin Gods must have been imagined very much as were and are those of\r\nother barbarous races, who are notoriously thought of as having sex,\r\nform, and passions. Greek mythology simply reached the art stage sooner.\r\nThe cults of Hellas did not start with a mythology full-blown, thereby\r\ncreating the arts; the mythology grew step by step with and in the arts,\r\nin a continuous mutual reaction; many Greek myths being really tales\r\nframed to explain the art-figures of other mythologies, Egyptian and\r\nAsiatic. Thus the primitive bareness of the Latin mythology signifies\r\nnot a natural saplessness which could give no increase to art, but (1)\r\nloss of lore and (2) a lack of the artistic and literary factors which\r\nrecord and stimulate higher mythologic growth.\r\n\r\nThus limited in their native culture, the Roman upper class were\r\ninevitably much affected by higher foreign cultures when they met these\r\nunder conditions of wealth and leisure. Long before that stage, indeed,\r\nthey consulted Greek oracles and collected responses; and they had\r\ninformally assimilated before the conquest a whole series of Greek Gods\r\nwithout giving them public worship.[410] The very Goddess of the early\r\nLatin League, the Aventine Diana, was imaged by a copy of Artemis of\r\nEphesus, the Goddess of the Ionian League.[411] As time went on the more\r\npsychologically developed cults of the East were bound to attract the\r\nRomans of all classes. What of religious emotion there was in the early\r\ndays must have played in large part around the worship which the State\r\nleft free to the citizens as individuals--the worship of the _Lares_ and\r\n_Penates_, the cults of the hearth and the family; and in this\r\nconnection the primitive mythopoeic instinct must have evolved a great\r\ndeal of private mythology which never found its way into literature. But\r\nas the very possession of _Lares_ and _Penates_, ancestral and domestic\r\nspirits, was originally a class privilege, not shared by the landless\r\nand the homeless, these had step by step to be made free of public\r\ninstitutions of a similar species--the _Lares Praestites_ of the whole\r\ncity, festally worshipped on the first day of May, and other _Lares\r\nPublici_, _Rurales_, _Compitales_, _Viales_, and so on--just as they\r\nwere helped to bread. Even these concessions, however, failed to make\r\nthe old system suffice for the transforming State; and individual\r\nforeign worships with a specific attraction were one by one inevitably\r\nintroduced--that of AEsculapius in the year 291 B.C., in a panic about\r\npestilence; that of Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, in 205: both by\r\nformal decision of the Senate. The manner of the latter importation is\r\ninstructive. Beginning the Hannibalic war in a spirit of religious\r\npatriotism, the Senate decreed the destruction of the temples of the\r\nalien Isis and Serapis.[412] But as the war went on, and the devotion\r\nshown to the native Gods was seen to be unrewarded, the Senate\r\nthemselves, yielding to the general perturbation which showed itself in\r\nconstant resort to foreign rites by the women,[413] prescribed resort to\r\nthe Greek sacrificial rites of Apollo.[414] Later they called in the\r\ncult of Cybele from Phrygia;[415] and other cults informally, but none\r\nthe less irresistibly, followed.\r\n\r\nIn all such steps two forces were at work--the readiness of the\r\nplebeians to welcome a foreign religion in which the patricians had, as\r\nit were, no vested rights; and the tendency of the more plastic\r\npatricians themselves, especially the women, to turn to a worship with\r\nemotional attractions. When the plebeians sought admission for their\r\nclass to the higher offices of State, they were told with unaffected\r\nseriousness that their men had not the religious qualifications--they\r\nlacked the hereditary gift of reading auspices, the lore of things\r\nsacred.[416] So, when they did force entrance, their alleged blunders in\r\nthese matters were exclaimed against as going far to ruin the republic.\r\nThis was not a way to make the populace revere the national religion;\r\nand as the population of foreign race steadily increased by conquest and\r\nenslavement, alien cults found more and more hold. \"It was always in the\r\npopular quarters of the city that these movements began.\"[417]\r\n\r\nThe first great unofficial importation seems to have been the orgiastic\r\nworship of Dionysos, who specially bore for the Romans his epithet of\r\nBacchus, and was identified with their probably aboriginal _Liber_. This\r\nworship, carried on in secret assemblies, was held by the conservatives\r\nto be a hotbed of vice and crime, and was, according to Livy, bloodily\r\npunished (B.C. 186). So essentially absurd, however, is Livy's childish\r\nnarrative that it is impossible to take anything in it for certain save\r\nthe bare fact that the worship was put under restrictions, as tending to\r\npromote secret conspiracies.[418] But from this time forward, roughly\r\nspeaking, Rome may be said to have entered into the mythological\r\nheritage of Greece, even as she did into her positive treasure of art\r\nwork and of oriental gold. Every cult of the conquered Mediterranean\r\nworld found a footing in the capital, the mere craving for new\r\nsensations among the upper class being sufficient to overcome their\r\npolitical bias to the old system. It is clear that when Augustus found\r\nscores of Roman temples in disrepair after the long storms of the civil\r\nwars, it was not that \"religion\" was out of vogue, but that it was\r\nsuperseded by what the Romans called \"superstition\"--something\r\nextraneous, something over and above the public system of rites and\r\nceremonies. In point of fact, the people of Rome were in the mass no\r\nlonger of Roman stock, but a collection of many alien races, indifferent\r\nto the indigenous cults. The emperor's restorations could but give a\r\nsubsidised continuity to the official services: what vitally flourished\r\nwere the cults which ministered to the new psychological needs of a\r\npopulation more and more divorced from great public interests, and\r\nincreasingly alien in its heredity--the stimulant and hysterical\r\nworships of Adonis, of Attis, of the Lover Goddess coupled with the\r\nfirst, or the Mourning Mother Goddess with the second, of Isis and\r\nOsiris and their child--rituals of alternate lamentation and rejoicing,\r\nof initiations, austerities, confessions, penances, self-abasement, and\r\nthe promise of immortality. On the general soil of devotion thus formed,\r\nthere finally grew up side by side Mithraism and Christianity, the rival\r\nreligions of the decadence, of which the second triumphed in virtue of\r\nhaving by far the larger number of adaptations to its environment.\r\n\r\nBut while Rome was thus at length fully possessed by the spirit of\r\nreligious imagination which had so fruitfully stirred the art of Greece,\r\nthere ensued no new birth of faculty. It was with the arts as with\r\nliterature: the stimulus from Greece was received by a society rapidly\r\non the way to that social state which in Greece had choked the springs\r\nof progress. In the last generations of the Republic the literary\r\ndevelopment was markedly rapid. In the century which saw Rome, after a\r\nterrific struggle, victorious over Carthage and prepared for the grapple\r\nwith Macedon, the first practitioners of literature were playwrights, or\r\nslaves, or clients of great men, or teachers like Ennius, who could find\r\nin the now leisured and in part intelligent or at least inquisitive\r\nupper class a sufficient encouragement to a literary career. That class\r\ndid not want recitals of the crude folklore of their fathers, so\r\ncompletely eclipsed by that of Greece, which was further associated with\r\nthe literary form of drama, virtually new to the Romans.[419] Drama,\r\nalways the form of literature which can best support itself, is the form\r\nmost cultivated down till the period of popular abasement and civil\r\nconvulsion, though of a dozen dramatists we have only Plautus and\r\nTerence left in anything like completeness; and while the tragedy of\r\nPacuvius and Attius was unquestionably an imitation of the Greek, it may\r\nhave had in its kind as much merit as the comedies that have been\r\npreserved. Even more rapid than the development, however, is the social\r\ngangrene that kills the popular taste; for when we reach the time of\r\nAugustus there is no longer a literary drama, save perhaps for the small\r\naudiences of the wooden theatres, and the private performances of\r\namateurs;[420] parades and pantomimes alone can attract the mindless\r\nmultitude; and the era of autocrats begins on well-laid foundations of\r\nignorance and artificial incivilisation.\r\n\r\nAs with the literature of the people, so with that of the lettered\r\nclass. In the last generation of freedom, we have in Lucretius and\r\nCatullus two of the great poets of all antiquity, compared with whose\r\nforceful inspiration Virgil and Horace already begin to seem sicklied\r\no'er with the pale cast of decline. Thenceforth the glory begins to die\r\naway; and though the red blade of Juvenal is brandished with a hand of\r\npower, and Lucan clangs forth a stern memorial note, and Petronius\r\nsparkles with a sinister brilliancy, there is no mistaking the downward\r\ncourse of things under Caesarism. It is true we find Juvenal complaining\r\nthat only the emperor does anything for literature:--\r\n\r\n   Et spes et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantum.\r\n   Solus enim tristes hac tempestate Camoenas\r\n   Respexit.[421]\r\n\r\nIt is the one word of praise he ever gives to the autocrat, be it\r\nDomitian or another; and the commentators decide that only at the\r\nbeginning of Domitian's reign would it apply. In effect, the satire is a\r\ndescription of the Roman upper class as grown indifferent to poetry, or\r\nto any but their own. But it is not on the economic side that the\r\nautocracy and the aristocracy of the Empire are to be specially\r\nindicted. The economic difficulty was very much the same under the\r\nRepublic, when only by play-writing could literary men as such make a\r\nliving. As Juvenal goes on to say, Horace when he cried Evohe was well\r\nfed, and if Virgil had lacked slave and lodging the serpents would have\r\nbeen lacking to the fury's hair, and the tongueless trumpet have sounded\r\nnothing great. Lucretius, Catullus, and Virgil were all inheritors of a\r\npatrimony; and Horace needed first an official post and later a patron's\r\nmunificence to enable him to live as a poet. The mere sale of their\r\nbooks could not possibly have supported any one of them, so low were\r\nprices kept by the small demand.[422] What was true of the poets was\r\nstill truer of the historians. Thus in the Republic as in the Empire,\r\nthe men of letters, apart from the playwrights, tended to be drawn\r\nsolely from the small class with inherited incomes. The curse of the\r\nEmpire was that even when the sanest emperors, as the Antonines, sought\r\nto endow studies,[423] they could not buy moral or intellectual energy.\r\nThe senate of poltroons who crouched before the Neros and Caligulas were\r\nthe upper-class version of the population which lived by bread and the\r\ncircus; and in that air neither great art nor great thought could\r\nbreathe. Roman sculpture is but enslaved Greek sculpture taken into pay;\r\nLatin literature ceases to be Roman with Tacitus. The noble apparition\r\nof Marcus Aurelius shines out of the darkening ages like some unearthly\r\nincarnation, collecting in one life and in one book all the light and\r\nhealing left in the waning civilisations; beside the babble of Fronto\r\nhis speech is as that of one of the wise Gods of the ancient fantasy.\r\nHenceforth we have but ancillary history, and, in imaginative\r\nliterature, be it of Apuleius or of Claudian, the portents of another\r\nage. _Roma fuit._\r\n\r\nThe last stages of the transition from the pagan to the Middle Ages can\r\nbest be traced in the history of the northern province of Gaul.\r\nSubjected to regular imperial administration within a generation of its\r\nconquest by Caesar, Gaul for some centuries actually gained in\r\ncivilisation, the imperial regimen being relatively more favourable to\r\nnearly every species of material progress than that of the old\r\nchiefs.[424] The emperors even in the fourth century are found\r\nmaintaining there the professorships of rhetoric, language, law,\r\nphilosophy and medicine first founded by Marcus Antoninus;[425] and\r\nuntil finance began to fail and the barbarians to invade, the material\r\nconditions were not retrograde. But the general intellectual life was\r\nmerely imitative and retrospective; and the middle and upper classes,\r\nfor which the higher schools existed, were already decaying in Gaul as\r\nelsewhere. The old trouble, besides, the official veto on all vital\r\npolitical discussion--if indeed any appetite for such discussion\r\nsurvived--drove literature either into mere erudition or into\r\ntriviality. On the other hand, the growing Church offered a field of\r\nostensibly free intellectual activity, and so was for a time highly\r\nproductive, in point of sheer quantity of writing; a circumstance\r\nnaturally placed by later inquirers to the credit of its creed. The\r\nphenomenon was of course simply one of the passage of energy by the line\r\nof least resistance. Within the Church, to which they turned as did\r\nthoughtful Greeks to philosophy after the rise of Alexander's Empire,\r\nmen of mental tastes and moderate culture found both shelter and\r\nsupport; and the first Gaulish monasteries, unlike those of Egypt and\r\nthe East, were, as M. Guizot has noted, places for conference rather\r\nthan for solitary life.[426] There, for men who believed the creed,\r\nwhich was as credible as the older doctrines, there was a constant\r\nexercise for the mind on interests that were relatively real, albeit\r\nprofoundly divided from the interests of the community. Thus, at a time\r\nwhen the community needed all its mental energy to meet its political\r\nneed, that mental energy was spent in the discussion of insoluble and\r\ninsane problems, of predestination and freewill, of faith and works, of\r\nfasts, celibacy, the Trinity, immortality, and the worship of saints.\r\nMen such as Ambrose and Jerome in Italy, Paulinus, Cassian, Hilary, and\r\nSalvian in Gaul, Chrysostom in the East, and Augustine in the South,\r\nrepresent as it were the last vibrations of the civilised intelligence;\r\ntheir energy, vainly spent on what they felt to be great issues, hints\r\nof the amount of force that was still running to waste throughout the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, and even before the barbarian tide had overflowed the\r\nintellectual world, the fatal principle at the core of the new creed\r\nbegan to paralyse even the life that centred around that. In a world of\r\npolitical tyranny, an established church claiming to stand for the whole\r\nof supernatural truth must needs resort to tyranny as soon as it could\r\nwield the weapons. The civil strifes which broke out alike in the\r\nEastern and the Western Empire in the third and fourth centuries, and\r\nthe multitude of sects which rapidly honeycombed the Church, wore so\r\nmany more forces of social disintegration; and churchmen, reasoning that\r\ndifference of dogma was the ground of civil warfare as well as of war in\r\nthe Church, must needs take the course that had before been taken in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nAfter the original Arian battle had raged itself out in Egypt, Gregory\r\nof Nazianzun at Constantinople, Ambrose at Milan, and Martin at\r\nTours,[427] fought it over again. One point secured, others were settled\r\nin turn; and as soon as the influence of Augustine set up a prevailing\r\nsystem of thought, theology was as much a matter of rule and precedent\r\nas government. As we read Augustine's _City of God_, with its strenuous\r\ndemonstration that the calamities which men ascribe to the new religion\r\nare the fruit of their own misdeeds, we realise to the full the\r\ndissolution of antiquity. All that is valid in his polemic is the\r\nexposure of the absurdity of the old faiths, long before detected by the\r\nreason of the few, but maintained by believers and unbelievers alike for\r\nreasons of State. The due Nemesis came in the rise of a faith which\r\nfirst flourished on and promoted an utter disregard of State concerns,\r\nthen helped directly to rob the State of the mental energy it most\r\nneeded, and finally wrought for the paralysis of what mental energy\r\nitself had attracted. Of constructive truth, of the thought whereby a\r\nState could live, the polemist had much less than was once possessed by\r\nthe men who framed or credited the fables he derided. He could destroy,\r\nbut could not build up. And so it was with the Church, as regarded the\r\ncommonweal. \"Of all the various systems of government that have been\r\nattempted on this earth, theocracy, or more properly hierocracy, is\r\nundoubtedly one of the very worst.\"[428]\r\n\r\nBut one thing the Church could construct and conserve--the fabric of her\r\nown wealth and power. Hence it came about that the Church, in itself a\r\nState within the State, was one of the three or four concrete survivals\r\nof antiquity round which modern civilisation nucleated. Of the four, the\r\nChurch, often treated as the most valuable, was really the least so,\r\ninasmuch as it wrought always more for the hindrance of progress and the\r\nsundering of communities than for advance and unification. The truly\r\ncivilising forces were the other three: the first being the body of\r\nRoman law, the product of Roman experience and Greek thought in\r\ncombination; and the second, the literature of antiquity, in large part\r\nlost till the time we call the New Birth, when its recovery impregnated\r\nand inspired, though it perhaps also overburdened and lamed, the\r\nunformed intelligence of modern Europe. The third was the heritage of\r\nthe arts of life and of beauty, preserved in part by the populations of\r\nthe western towns which survived and propagated their species through\r\nthe ages of dominant barbarism; in part by the cohering society of\r\nByzantium. From these ancient germs placed in new soil is modern\r\ncivilisation derived.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: See E. Meyer, _Geschichte des Alterthums_, ii, 703; cp.\r\nA.

Hume's ed. 1900, i,\r\n115.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nA GENERAL VIEW OF DECADENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now, perhaps, in a position to contemplate the wood without being\r\ndistracted by the trees, and without forgetting, on the other hand, that\r\nit is an aggregate of trees individually conditioned by aggregation.\r\n\r\nThe record of Graeco-Roman, as of all other ancient civilisation, with\r\nthe partial exception of that of China, is one of a complete\r\ndecadence--in this case a twofold decadence: a passing from collective\r\nenergy and achievement to collective decrepitude and mental impotence,\r\nfrom intellectual freedom and force to the dogmatic arrest of thought,\r\nfrom artistic splendour to the very negation of the finest forms of art.\r\nHowever we may dispute about the nature of progress, we all agree that\r\nthis was decadence. Not even the Christian Greek, the least freethinking\r\nof educated moderns, supposes that the life of his race went upwards\r\nfrom the time of Constantine. The Italian to this day aspires--by way of\r\nTripoli, among other things--to bear some comparison with the Roman,\r\nwhose \"greatness\" he envies. Decadence, then, is confessed. It concerns\r\nus, if we would have a historical philosophy at all, to think it all in\r\nterms of general causation.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, we shall do well to realise that in the long\r\ntransmutation there was no day, save those of sudden and dire disaster,\r\non which the human elements of the State organisms concerned were\r\ncollectively conscious of any great change in their way of life. And\r\ndays of dire disaster had occurred in the times to which we look back as\r\nthose of energetic expansion. Early Rome had been actually captured by\r\nEtruscans, by Gauls; \"she\" had ostensibly come to the verge of overthrow\r\nby Hannibal a whole era before she was sacked by the Goths; Athens had\r\nbeen sacked by the Persians long before the Roman invasion. What was the\r\ndetermining difference in the consciousness of the citizens at the two\r\nepochs? Clearly that between the minds of men wont to \"fend for\r\nthemselves\" collectively and of men wont to be ruled and prescribed for\r\nby a master--a difference, therefore, in power of resistance and of\r\nrecovery. And this difference had itself been wrought by long\r\nmutations--from the day of Sulla to the day of Tiberius in Rome, from\r\nthe day of Alexander to that of Sulla in Greece. No one generation had\r\nbeen born in full \"freedom,\" to pass away in complete subordination to\r\nan autocrat. The earlier generations, like the later, had been\r\nhabituated to slave-owning, superstition, and the thought of war. The\r\nsubstantial and fatal change was in the degree of simple average manhood\r\namong the free. National decadence, in a word, is loss of manhood--a\r\nthing not easily lost.\r\n\r\nA Conservative statesman of our day, wont to apply analytic criticism\r\nchiefly for partisan purposes, has attempted a comparatively\r\ndisinterested analysis of the problem before us, in a short but not\r\ninconsiderate survey of the decadence of the old world. At the outset he\r\nrightly notes the inconsistency with which men still tend to hold by the\r\nold idea of an inevitable ageing and ultimate decrepitude of States and\r\ncivilisations, while holding no less confidently to the modern notion,\r\npractically unattained by the ancients, of an inevitable progress.\r\n\"Why,\" he asks, \"_should_ civilisations thus wear out and great\r\ncommunities decay? and what evidence is there that in fact they\r\ndo?\"[429] It may or may not be by reason of political bias that the\r\nquestioner--who indeed avows that he is pursuing one of \"those wandering\r\ntrains of thought where we allow ourselves the luxury of putting\r\nwide-ranging questions, to which our ignorance forbids any confident\r\nreply\"--propounds no clear answer to either query, contenting himself\r\nwith suggesting that modern civilisation, in virtue of its strengthening\r\nhold on physical science, stands a chance of escaping the doom that fell\r\non the old. But such a curtailed answer moves us afresh to seek a more\r\ncomplete one.\r\n\r\nOur questioner, contemplating the \"fall\" of Rome, argues that the cause\r\ncannot have been even so serious an evil as slavery, which had been in\r\noperation from the beginning. He overlooks the fact that it had greatly\r\nincreased in the period of far-reaching conquest,[430] and so misses an\r\nelement in the solution. Passing over this, he recognises one proximate\r\n\"cause,\" diminution of population; and he in effect seems to trace to\r\nthis source the secondary factor of fiscal collapse--the breaking down\r\nof the tax-paying classes everywhere under the ever-increasing burden of\r\nState exaction. The final fiscal process he oddly describes as \"a crude\r\nexperiment in socialism.\" Putting the decay of population and the\r\nincrease of burdens together, he pronounces that \"they absolutely\r\nrequire themselves to be explained by causes more general and more\r\nremote\"; and his answer--confessedly a mere restatement of the\r\nproblem--is just the word \"Decadence.\" The process is simply formulated,\r\nonce more, in terms of its name. The questioner does not even take the\r\nfurther analytical step of asking how the Eastern Empire came to endure\r\na thousand years longer than the Western; and why the decadence did not\r\nsimilarly operate there.\r\n\r\nIf anything has been made out in the foregoing survey, we have got\r\nfurther than this; and indeed from any point of view the arrest of the\r\nanalysis is surprising. Supposing failure of population to be the\r\ncentral phenomenon, we have obviously to ask: What were the political\r\ndifferentia of the progressive and the ostensibly declining states of\r\npopulation? How were the peoples ruled when they were strong, expansive,\r\nand collectively equal to their burdens? Surely the answer is obvious.\r\nRepublican Greece and Republican Rome were self-governing communities,\r\nor aggregates of such, supporting themselves by individualist production\r\nof all kinds, breeding beyond and not under the apparent limit of\r\nfood-production. When Romanised Italy ceased to produce a sufficiency of\r\nmen, she had ceased to produce a sufficiency of things; and this latter\r\nfailure, entailing the other, can be shown to have been a direct result\r\nof the exaction of all manner of subsistence from conquered territories.\r\nSo far, there is no mystery.\r\n\r\nOur querist, however, affirms a diminution of population not only in\r\nItaly but throughout the Empire. Here we must first question the\r\nassertion. Pestilences, such as that of 166 A.C., doubtless visited most\r\nparts of the Empire; but pestilences belong also to the pre-imperial\r\nperiod, and need not here be specially considered. As to Greece, the\r\nfacts have been already given. The depopulation of that, after\r\nAlexander, was primarily a matter of exodus to the richer conquered\r\nlands, where a new Hellenistic civilisation arose under purely monarchic\r\nrule, and therefore unaccompanied by the all-round, self-developing\r\nmental energy which had marked the life of \"free\" Greece. In Byzantium,\r\nof course, the mental stagnation, under Christian autocracy, was no less\r\ncomplete. But there is no evidence whatever that after Constantine the\r\nprinciple of population failed in the Eastern Empire, especially when\r\nthat was restricted by the amputation of the tributary territories.[431]\r\n\r\nDid population then fail in Gaul and Spain and Africa? If so, when? As\r\nto Gaul, there is evidence that after the conquest population and\r\nproductivity increased, though the latter had not previously been\r\nlow--witness the loot taken by Caesar at Toulouse. Gaul was certainly\r\ntaxed exorbitantly; but Julian, as we saw, prudently lessened the drain;\r\nand Mommsen describes both Gaul and Spain as flourishing in their\r\nRomanised period.[432] They continued, in fact, to be, with North\r\nAfrica, the main sources of the revenue of the Western Empire down to\r\nits collapse. Materially, they in some respects went forward, notably in\r\nthe case of the region of old Carthage. The element wherein they were\r\ndecadent was precisely that of free manhood, everywhere eviscerated by\r\nautocratic and bureaucratic rule. Therefore it was that, like\r\nBritain--similarly productive of revenue in the imperial period--they\r\nwere unable to defend themselves against the final barbarian inroads.\r\nHad Honorius carried out his scheme for a measure of Home Rule in\r\nGaul,[433] and followed it up by a similar scheme for Spain, Italy\r\nindeed might all the sooner have lost her hold on them as milch kine,\r\nbut both provinces might conceivably have developed a new life centuries\r\nbefore they historically did.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative statesman has in fact, and very naturally, excluded\r\nfrom consideration the central political factor. Echoing the\r\nGibbon-Mommsen-Renan thesis as to the excellence of the Antonine\r\ngovernment of the Mediterranean world, he ignores as those writers did\r\nthe vital problem: Wherein lies the felicity of a world wholly at the\r\nmercy of the chance of the election of a good emperor by a mercenary\r\nsoldiery? To fall back on phrases about the Empire \"respecting local\r\nfeelings, encouraging local government,\" and being \"accepted by the\r\nconquered as the natural organisation of the world,\" is merely to burke\r\nthe real issue as to the political viability of communities satisfied\r\nwith such a system, content to rest the social pyramid forever on its\r\napex. To say that the conditions of the Empire under the Antonines were\r\n\"getting better\" is merely to close the eyes to the frightful hazard of\r\nimperial succession. A world absolutely dependent for its\r\nbetterment--nay, even for its safe continuance--on the chance of a good\r\nsuccession of despots is a world doomed by the mere law of variation.\r\n\r\nIf we will but gauge moral and economic forces in human affairs as we\r\ngauge physical forces in that toil of science of which the Conservative\r\nstatesman has learned to recognise the efficacy, we shall deliver\r\nourselves from the mystery-mongering which he is fain to substitute for\r\nthe old shibboleth of \"the divine will.\" To trace causation in a known\r\ncivilisation is not to pretend either to understand all social sequences\r\nin all ages or to predict the destinate future: it is but to recognise\r\nthe real reactions of human proclivities and procedures which habit and\r\nprejudice have been wont to contemplate uncritically. The late Sir John\r\nSeeley, who at times hardly advances on Kingsley as an interpreter of\r\nhistory, grappled in his day with our problem; and he too specified the\r\nAntonine age as a notably hopeful period, from which he dates the\r\ndecadence:--\r\n\r\n     \"A century of unparalleled tranquillity and virtuous government is\r\n     followed immediately by a period of hopeless ruin and dissolution.\r\n     A century of rest is followed not by renewed vigour, but by\r\n     incurable exhaustion. Some principle of decay must have been at\r\n     work; but what principle? We answer: it was a period of sterility\r\n     or barrenness in human beings; the human harvest was bad. And among\r\n     the causes of this barrenness we find, in the more barbarous\r\n     nations, the enfeeblement produced by the too abrupt introduction\r\n     of civilisation and universally the absence of industrial habits,\r\n     and the disposition to listlessness which belongs to the military\r\n     character.\"[434]\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to apply the theory of human crops to the case of the\r\nchair of history at Cambridge. Prof. Seeley's theory is an edifying\r\nvariant on that of Mr. Balfour. Where one thesis finds the key to all in\r\nthe emperor, the other sees failure of the human harvest the moment the\r\nimperial succession goes wrong. And while the Professor offers the\r\nsemblance of a reason for the alleged failure in the human breed, it is\r\nreally too nugatory for discussion. If the \"barbarous nations\" alluded\r\nto were Gaul and Spain, they had suffered the \"abrupt introduction of\r\ncivilisation\" more than two hundred years before. Egypt and Syria and\r\nGreece and North Africa had older civilisations than the Roman. Germany\r\nwas not decadent. The decay of industrial life in Italy had begun long\r\nbefore the Empire. As well might we say that a bad human crop there had\r\npreceded the Etruscan conquest, the invasion by Hannibal, and the civil\r\nwars. To cite, as does Prof. Seeley, the pestilence of the year 166 as a\r\nbeginning of depopulation, is to ignore the problem of three hundred\r\nyears of previous depopulation in Italy, and to set up a misconception\r\nas to the rest of the Empire. According to Gibbon, the long pestilence\r\nof the years 250-265 was the worst of all.[435]\r\n\r\nMore plausibly, Prof. Seeley goes on to argue that \"what the plague had\r\nbeen to the population, that the _fiscus_ was to industry. It broke the\r\nbruised reed; it converted feebleness into utter and incurable debility.\r\nRoman finance had no conception of the impolicy of laying taxation so as\r\nto depress enterprise and trade. The _fiscus_ destroyed capital in the\r\nRoman Empire. The desire of accumulation languished where the Government\r\nlay in wait for all savings--_locupletissimus quisque in praedam\r\ncorreptus_. All the intricate combinations by which man is connected to\r\nman in a progressive society disappeared.\"[436] But this is a finally\r\nexcessive description of a process which had been in full swing in the\r\ntime of Cicero, and which subsisted for three hundred years after Marcus\r\nAurelius in the West. A generation after Marcus came the powerful\r\nSeverus, whose son Caracalla could find millions of money to build his\r\nimmense baths at Rome, still monstrous in their ruins; and seventy years\r\nafter Caracalla, Diocletian, wielding the Empire at its utmost\r\nextension, could build still vaster baths for the imperial city at which\r\nhe had ceased to dwell. With a debased silver coinage,[437] the emperors\r\nof that day seemed to feel no fatal lack of real revenue, and\r\nmaintained, at great cost, huge armies for the control and defence of\r\ntheir enormous realm.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to see why the age of the Antonines should be taken as\r\na turning point in the Empire's history rather than the age of\r\nDiocletian. That great organiser seems to have partly provoked the\r\ninsurrection of the Bagaudae in Gaul by taxation; but the Bagaudae were\r\na _jacquerie_ oppressed by the nobles, as their fathers had been before\r\nCaesar, and as their posterity was long afterwards; and their wrongs may\r\nas well have been at the hands of their lords as at those of the\r\nautocrat.[438] However that might be, Roman rule in Gaul survived the\r\nrevolt of the Bagaudae, yielding a great revenue to Constantine; and at\r\nthe time of the fall of Rome Gaul was much more productive than Italy.\r\nAll this is beside the case. To say that \"the downfall of the Empire is\r\naccounted for\" by the _fiscus_[439] is to raise the question whether the\r\nEmpire, as such, could have been run by any other method. The Professor\r\nhimself pronounces that \"Government in its helplessness was driven\" to\r\nfiscal oppression. Then fiscal oppression belonged to the nature of the\r\nEmpire. Once more we return to the true line of sequence and\r\nexplanation. Every step and stage in decadence belonged to the process\r\nof conquest, of confiscation, of subjection of foreign races, who were\r\nmade to pay for the vast machinery that kept them subject till they were\r\nunfit for self-defence.\r\n\r\n     [What is true of the Roman fisc was true till the other day of the\r\n     Turkish, another product of militarist imperialism, similarly\r\n     collateral with mental stagnation. Depopulation and arrest of\r\n     production in the East under Turkish rule are to be explained in\r\n     substantially the way in which we have explained them for ancient\r\n     Rome. And it is significant that the prospect of regeneration for\r\n     Turkey has begun after the amputation of many of the provinces over\r\n     which she maintained an alien rule. Her future visibly depends on\r\n     the continuance of the processes of self-maintenance and\r\n     development of the principle of self-government throughout the\r\n     subsisting State.]\r\n\r\nThere is a danger that, in insisting on the primarily moral causation of\r\nthe process of social disease and decay, we may on the one hand relapse\r\ninto a delusive sense of moral superiority, and on the other hand fail\r\nto realise how the subjective moral divagation becomes politically\r\neffectual in structural and economic change. It is the understood\r\nprocess of causation that is alone truly instructive. But the\r\ninstruction is deepened in the ratio of our realisation of the decay.\r\nThough it is clear that before Rome many a civilisation had gone to\r\nviolent wreck, there is in recorded history no more overwhelming memory\r\nof long triumph and long downfall than that \"from the far-distant\r\nmorning when a small clan of peasants and shepherds felled the forests\r\non the Palatine to raise altars to its tribal deities, down to the\r\ntragic hour in which the sun of Graeco-Latin civilisation set over the\r\ndeserted fields, the abandoned cities, the homeless, ignorant, and\r\nbrutalised peoples of Latin Europe.\"[440] And this whole tremendous arc\r\nof triumph and decline is to be understood as the historic expression of\r\nthe specially conditioned bias of conquest in one people.\r\n\r\nThe decline is the due sequence of the \"rise\": everything roots in the\r\nwrong relation of communities throughout the Empire. The extension of\r\nsuch a social disease as slavery is one of the symptoms, one of the\r\nsequelae, of the central malady.[441] A totally progressive State\r\neliminates or minimises slavery; a declining one fails to do so. The\r\neconomic malady involved affects primarily the dominant or parasitic\r\nState or central part, its condition of parasitism being more deadly\r\nthan its draining effect on the others. _Their_ malady lay in their\r\nstate of subjugation, which was an impoverishment of character and\r\npolitical faculty; and thus it came about that the collapse of the\r\ncentre of organisation meant the fall of the entire civilisation of\r\nWestern Europe before the new barbarism.\r\n\r\nRome had so visibly ruined all that we are apt to forget how the process\r\nof moral and political retrogression had begun in the Greek world long\r\nbefore. There, however, the Roman conquest was but a consummation; and\r\nthe economic and political continuance of the Eastern Empire was\r\nconcurrent with a moral and intellectual contraction which was never\r\nrecovered from. In a word, varying conditions determined the differences\r\nof continuance and evolution in the two spheres. But the causation is\r\nnone the less clear throughout.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that this reverberating lesson could have been read\r\nin only one way--as a warning to the nations against taking the Roman\r\nroad of conquest and dominion. And yet it is doubtful whether modern\r\nStates have been at all guided by that lesson, as compared with the\r\nextent to which they have been overruled by the sheer difficulty of\r\nrepeating the evolution. The problem has been faced by Lord Cromer, a\r\nripe ruler, in his very scholarly essay on _Ancient and Modern\r\nImperialism_. The experienced administrator is quite alive to the\r\nanalogy between the part played of old by Rome around the Mediterranean\r\nand in Europe, and that played to-day by England in India and, in some\r\nmeasure, in Egypt. Raised in some degree above the ordinary\r\nhallucination of mere dominion, the confused pride of the average man in\r\nhis country's rule over large portions of the earth, the veteran\r\ngovernor notes that, whereas there was a general acquiescence of the\r\nsubject peoples in the imperial rule of Rome, no _imperium_ to-day has\r\nwon any such cordial acceptance.[442] Neither France in Algeria and\r\nTunis nor Britain in India and Egypt is an assimilating and unifying\r\npower. We may note the proximate explanation, which he does not at first\r\ngive--to wit, the sundering force of crystallised religious systems. As\r\nhe later puts it, following Sir Alfred Lyall, religions make nations,\r\nwhere the Romans had to deal with tribes.[443] But that need not greatly\r\naffect our view of the political problem, which would remain if the\r\nreligious factor were eliminated; and it is over the political problem\r\nthat Lord Cromer most significantly balances.\r\n\r\nFalling back on the method of fatalism, he pronounces, like others\r\nbefore him, \"that Rome, equally with the modern expansive Powers, more\r\nespecially Great Britain and Russia, was impelled onwards by the\r\nimperious and irresistible necessity of acquiring defensible frontiers;\r\nthat the public opinion of the world scoffed 2,000 years ago, as it does\r\nnow, at the alleged necessity; and that each onward move was attributed\r\nto an insatiable lust for extended dominion.\"[444] As in all fatalistic\r\nreasoning, we are here faced by radical self-contradiction. The \"public\r\nopinion of the world,\" which Lord Cromer allows to include a large part\r\nof Roman opinion,[445] could not scoff at an \"irresistible necessity\":\r\nit knew that it was no more irresistibly necessary for A to conquer B\r\nthan for B to conquer A; and in ascribing to Rome an \"insatiable lust\r\nfor extended dominion\" it merely credited Rome with an appetite known to\r\ninhere in all States. Rome succeeded in her aim; others failed. Pisa,\r\noverborne by Florence, had in her day overborne other communities. Lord\r\nCromer has begged the vital question, which is: Can States, or can they\r\nnot, live neighbourly? To say that Rome could not because of the\r\nambitions or menaces of others is idle: the menace was reciprocal.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes, of course, the thesis is sometimes adequate all\r\nround, as when France and Britain, face to face in North America and in\r\nIndia, strove each to oust the other. But at times the plea becomes\r\nvisibly farcical, as in the recent case of Russia in the Far East, and\r\nthe earlier case of Britain with regard to Afghanistan. We can all\r\nremember the temporary growth of the doctrine of \"a scientific\r\nfrontier.\" First you want a river; then you need the territory beyond\r\nthe river; then you need the line of hills commanding that territory;\r\nthen the territory behind the hills becomes a _sine qua non_.[446] In\r\nthis case the doctrine has disappeared with the policy, and _that_\r\ndisappeared simply because it failed. The event has proved that the\r\ndoctrine was a chimera. And nobody to-day probably will maintain that\r\nRussia lay under an imperious and irresistible necessity to go and be\r\ndefeated by the Japanese in Manchuria; or that she could not conceivably\r\nhave stopped short of that extremity.\r\n\r\nThe use sometimes made of the word \"cupidity\" is apt to obscure the\r\nproblem. There is cupidity of power and conquest as well as of\r\nterritory, revenue, plunder. Roman cupidity was of all kinds. But so was\r\nthat of \"the\" Greeks. Lord Cromer employs the old false\r\ndichotomy--above discussed--that marks the Greeks as \"individualistic\"\r\nand the Romans as somehow unitary.[447] As we have seen, the original\r\nRoman City-State was just the same kind of thing as the Greek: it was\r\nopportunity that made \"the Romans\" expand, whereas \"the Greeks,\" down to\r\nAlexander, remained segregated in their States. What was common and\r\nfatal to both, what led Greece to dissolution and Rome to downfall, was\r\nthe primary impulse to combat, the inability to refrain from jealousy,\r\nhate, and war. And for the moderns, seeing this, the problem is, Can\r\nthey refrain?\r\n\r\nEither we are thus to learn from history, or all history is as a novel\r\nwithout a purpose. And Lord Cromer, as a man of action, cannot in effect\r\ntake this attitude, though he recoils from any clear statement of the\r\nlesson. On the one hand, he makes the most of the differentia between\r\nancient and modern Imperialism. English rulers in India, he admits,\r\noriginally aimed at home revenue, and did for a time practise sheer\r\nplunder;[448] the British rule no longer does either: which is in effect\r\nan admission that one \"imperious and irresistible necessity\" of the\r\nRoman rule has been successfully resisted--shall we say, by modern\r\nenlightenment? But he will not frankly take the further step and say\r\nthat for the ideal of dominion over backward races we should substitute\r\nthe ideal of their education and purposive evolution. Rather he makes\r\nthe most of the difficulties, enlarging in the familiar fashion on the\r\ndividedness and differentiation of the Indian peoples and the relative\r\nstationariness of Islam: two undeniable propositions, of which the first\r\nis nothing to the purpose, since we are discussing the lines of\r\nprogressive policy; while the second merely incurs the rejoinder that\r\nChristendom was long as stationary as Islam, and that Christian\r\nAbyssinia is so still.\r\n\r\nAs was, indeed, to be expected, Lord Cromer will rather homologate the\r\nwhole Roman process, decadence and collapse and all, than pronounce it\r\nwhat it was, a vast divagation in human progress. Ultimately he does not\r\neven blench at the proposition that the whole ruin \"had to\" take\r\nplace[449] by way of preparing for the civilisation that was to follow,\r\neven as he argues that \"the\" Romans \"had to\" undertake fresh wars where\r\nthey (on the urging, as he admits, of their wisest men) had sought to\r\nevade further conquest by recognising \"buffer States\"[450]--as who\r\nshould say that whatever course a majority or a Government do take \"had\r\nto\" be taken. The answer to such reasoning is the mention of the fact,\r\nwhich he admits, that it was \"a supreme principle of the Roman\r\nGovernment to acknowledge no frontier Power with equal rights.\"[451] Can\r\nit be still a question whether that principle is to be transcended?\r\n\r\nOn the final issue as to what the ruling nations \"have to\" do to-day as\r\nregards the subject peoples, the disinterested student can hardly\r\nhesitate, however the ex-administrator may feel bound to balance. \"The\r\nEnglishman,\" Lord Cromer tells us, truly enough as regards the average\r\ncitizen, \"would be puzzled to give any definite answer\" to the question\r\n_Quo vadis?_ in matters imperial.[452] He may well be, when Lord Cromer\r\nvisibly is, despite the ostensible emphasis with which he exhorts his\r\ncountrymen to keep \"the _animus manendi_ strong within them.\"[453] The\r\ndanger is that, noting the formal conclusion rather than the implicit\r\nlesson of Lord Cromer's very able survey, \"the Englishman\" may turn from\r\nhis puzzle to some new insanity of imperialism. Not many years have\r\npassed since English wiseacres were speculating on a \"break-up\" of\r\nChina, and a dominion of some other State over her huge area and\r\nmultitudinous millions. He would be a bad sample of modernity who should\r\nnow regret that China is apparently on the way, like Japan, to build up\r\na new progressive civilisation in the \"unchanging East.\"[454] But it is\r\nperhaps as much to the sheer impracticability of further great conquests\r\nas to any alert and conscious reading of the lesson of history that we\r\nowe the growing disposition of modern States to seek their good in their\r\nown development. If so, provided that the ideal be changed, \"it is well,\r\nif not _so_ well.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: _Decadence._ (Henry Sidgwick Memorial Lecture.) By the\r\nRight Hon. A.J.

The\r\n     standard modern Italian history, that of Cesare Cantu, has been\r\n     translated into French; but in English there has been no general\r\n     history of any length since Procter and Spalding. Col. Procter's\r\n     _History of Italy_ (published as by G. Perceval, 1825; 2nd ed.\r\n     1844) has merit, but is not abreast of modern studies. Spalding's\r\n     _Italy and the Italian Islands_ (3 vols. 3rd ed. 1845) is an\r\n     excellent work of its kind, covering Italian history from the\r\n     earliest times, but is also in need of revision. The comprehensive\r\n     work of Dr. T. Hodgkin, _Italy and her Invaders_ (2nd ed. 1892-99,\r\n     8 vols.) comes down to the death of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n     Of special histories there are several. One of the best and latest\r\n     is that of _The Lombard Communes_, by Prof. W.F. Butler (1906).\r\n     Captain H.E. Napier, in the preface to his _Florentine History_\r\n     (1846, 6 vols.) rightly contended that \"no people can be known by\r\n     riding post through their country against time\"; but his six\r\n     learned volumes are ill-written and ill-assimilated. The best\r\n     complete history of Florence, the typical Italian Republic, is the\r\n     long _Histoire de Florence_ by F.T. Perrens (9 tom. 1877-84; Eng.\r\n     tr. of one vol. by Hannah Lynch, 1892). T.A. Trollope's _History of\r\n     the Commonwealth of Florence_ (1865, 4 vols.) is less indigestible\r\n     than Napier's, but is gratuitously diffuse, and is written in large\r\n     part in unfortunate imitation of the pseudo-dramatic manner of\r\n     Carlyle. It is further blemished by an absurd index. Neither this\r\n     nor Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt's _History of the Venetian Republic_\r\n     (1860, 4 vols.; new ed. in two large vols. 1900) has much\r\n     sociological value, though the latter is copious and painstaking,\r\n     albeit also diffuse. The _Genoa_ of J. Theodore Bent (1881) is an\r\n     interesting sketch; but the well-read author fails in orderly\r\n     construction.\r\n\r\n     A good short manual is the _Italy_ of Mr. Hunt (Macmillan's\r\n     Historical Course); and an excellent compendium is supplied by the\r\n     two treatises of Oscar Browning (1894-95), _Guelphs and\r\n     Ghibellines_ (covering the period 1250-1409) and _The Age of the\r\n     Condottieri_, covering the Renaissance, to 1530. Bryce and Hallam\r\n     are alike helpful to general views; and it is still profitable to\r\n     return to the condensed _History of the Italian Republics_ by\r\n     Sismondi (written for the English \"Cabinet Cyclopaedia\" in 1832),\r\n     though it needs revision in detail. In his two volumes entitled\r\n     _The Fall of the Roman Empire_ (1834) that author has given a\r\n     useful conspectus of the period covered by Gibbon's great work.\r\n     Sismondi's larger and earlier _Histoire des republiques italiennes_\r\n     has never ceased to be well worth study, though the _Geschichte von\r\n     Italien_ of H. Leo (1829) improves upon it in several respects. It\r\n     has been revised and condensed (Routledge, 1 large vol. 1906) by\r\n     Mr. William Boulting. For the early period the most comprehensive\r\n     survey is the _Geschichte Italiens im Mittelalter_ of Ludo Moritz\r\n     Hartmann (3 Bde. in 5, 1897-1911) which comes down to the tenth\r\n     century.\r\n\r\n     Among modern monographs that of Alfred von Reumont on _Lorenzo de'\r\n     Medici_ (Eng. tr. 1876, 2 vols.) in nearly every way supersedes the\r\n     old work of Roscoe, whose _Leo X_, again, is practically superseded\r\n     by later works on the Renaissance, in particular those of\r\n     Burckhardt (Eng. tr. of Geiger's ed. in 1 vol. 1892) and the late\r\n     J.A. Symonds. Miss Duffy has a good chapter on Florentine trade and\r\n     finance in her _Story of the Tuscan Republics_, 1892; and the short\r\n     work of F.T. Perrens, _La civilisation florentine du 13e au 16e\r\n     siecle_ (1892--in the _Bibliotheque d'histoire illustree_) is\r\n     luminous throughout; but Ranke's _History of the Latin and Teutonic\r\n     Nations_ (Eng. tr. 1887), which deals with the Italy of 1494-1514,\r\n     is little more than a sand-heap of incident. On the economic side\r\n     there is a good research in Pignotti's essay on Tuscan Commerce in\r\n     his _History of Tuscany_ (Eng. tr. 1823, vol. iii). Much\r\n     interesting detail is given, with much needless rhetoric, in _The\r\n     Guilds of Florence_, by Edgcumbe Staley, 1906.\r\n\r\n     Of great general value is the elaborate work of Gregorovius,\r\n     _Geschichte der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter_ (4te Aufl. 8 Bde.\r\n     1886-96; Eng. tr. by Mrs. Hamilton, 8 vols. 1895-1902), which,\r\n     however, suffers from the disparity of its purposes, combining as\r\n     it does, a topographical history of the city of Rome with a full\r\n     history of its politics. It remains a valuable mass of materials\r\n     rather than a history proper. The same criticism applies to the\r\n     very meritorious _Geschichte der Stadt Rom_ of A. von Reumont (3\r\n     Bde. 1867-70), which begins with the very origin of the city, and\r\n     comes down to our own time.\r\n\r\n     But there has risen in contemporary Italy a school of historical\r\n     students who are rewriting the history of the great period in the\r\n     light of the voluminous archives which have been preserved by\r\n     municipalities. One outcome of this line of investigation is Prof.\r\n     Villari's _The Two First Centuries of Florentine History_ (Eng. tr.\r\n     of first 2 vols. 1894). New light, further, has been thrown on the\r\n     commercial history of Italy in the Dark Ages and early Middle Ages\r\n     by the admirable research of Prof. W. von Heyd, of which the\r\n     French translation by Furcy Raynaud, _Histoire du commerce du\r\n     Levant an moyen age_ (1886, 2 tom.) is recast and considerably\r\n     enlarged by the author, while the Renascence period is illuminated\r\n     by R. Poehlmann's treatise, _Die Wirthschafts Politik der\r\n     Florentiner Renaissance und das Princip der Verkehrsfreiheit_\r\n     (Leipzig, 1878).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nTo understand aright the phenomenon of medieval Italian civilisation we\r\nneed first to realise that it was at bottom a fresh growth on the\r\nculture roots of the cities of Romanised Italy. When the imperial centre\r\nwas shifted to the East, as already remarked, the people of Italy began\r\na fresh adaptation to their conditions; those of Rome, instead of\r\nleading, standing most zealously to the old way of things. All the\r\nbarbarian irruptions did but harass and hinder the new development; they\r\nfinally counted for little in its upward course. There is a prevalent\r\nhallucination, akin to others concerning the \"Teutonic race,\" in the\r\nshape of a belief that Italy was somehow \"regenerated\" by the \"free\r\nnations of the North.\" No accepted formula could well be further away\r\nfrom the facts. If the political qualities of the \"Teutonic race,\"\r\nwhatever that may mean, are to be generalised on the facts of the\r\ninvasions of Italy by the Germanic tribes, from Theodoric to Frederick\r\nBarbarossa, they must be summed up as consisting in a general incapacity\r\nfor progressive civilisation. The invaders were, in fact, too disparate\r\nin their stage of evolution from that of the southern civilisation to be\r\ncapable of assimilating it and carrying it on. Living a life of strife\r\nand plunder like the early Romans, they found in the disarmed Italians,\r\nand in their rapidly degenerate predecessors of their own stock, an\r\neasier prey than the Romans had ever known till they went to the East;\r\nbut in the qualities either of military or of civil organisation they\r\nwere conspicuously inferior to the Romans of the early Republic. Men of\r\nthe highest executive ability appeared from time to time among their\r\nleaders; a circumstance of great interest and importance, as suggesting\r\nthat a percentage of genius occurs in all stages of human culture; but\r\nthe mass of the invaders was always signally devoid of the very\r\ncharacteristics so romantically attributed to them by German, English,\r\nand even French Teutophiles--to wit, the gifts of union, discipline,\r\norder, and self-government. These elements of civilisation depend on the\r\nfunctioning of the nerve centres, and are not to be evolved by mere\r\nmultiplication of animated flesh, which was the main constructive\r\nprocess carried on in ancient Germania. Precisely because they were, as\r\nTacitus noted, the most homogeneous of the European races of that\r\nera,[455] they were incapable of any rapid and durable social\r\ndevelopment. It is only mixed races that can evolve or sustain a complex\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\"The Germans,\" as we historically trace them at the beginning of our\r\nera, were barbarians (_i.e._, men between savagery and civilisation) in\r\nthe most rudimentary stage, making scanty beginnings in agriculture;\r\ndevoid of the useful arts, save those normally practised by savages;\r\ngiven to drunkenness; chronically at war; and alternating at other times\r\nbetween utter sloth and energetic hunting--the pursuit which best fitted\r\nthem for war. Because the peoples thus situated were in comparison with\r\nthe Romans \"chaste\" and monogamous--a common enough virtue in savage\r\nlife[456]--they are supposed by their admirers to have been excellent\r\nmaterial for a work of racial regeneration. Only in an indirect sense\r\ndoes this hold good. As a new \"cross\" to the Italian stocks they may\r\nindeed have made for beneficial variation; but by themselves they were\r\nmere raw material, morally and psychologically. Their reputed virtue of\r\nchastity disappeared as soon as the barbarians passed from a northern to\r\na southern climate,[457] their vices so speedily exceeding the measure\r\nof paganism that even a degree of physiological degeneration soon set\r\nin. Even in their own land, met by a fiercer barbarism than their own,\r\nthey collapsed miserably before the Huns. As regards the arts and\r\nsciences, moral and physical, it is impossible to trace to the invaders\r\nany share in the progress of Italy,[458] save in so far as they were\r\ndoubtless a serviceable cross with the older native stocks. To their own\r\nstock, which had been relatively too homogeneous, the gain of crossing\r\nwas mixed. Aurelian had put the case with rude truth when he told a\r\nbragging embassy of Goths that they knew neither the arts of war nor\r\nthose of peace;[459] and so long as the Empire in any section had\r\nresources enough to levy and maintain trained armies, it was able to\r\ndestroy any combination of the Teutons. There was always generalship\r\nenough for that, down till the days of Teutonic civilisation. Claudius\r\nthe Second routed their swarms as utterly as ever did Marius or Caesar;\r\nStilicho annihilated Rodogast, and always out-generalled Alaric; Aetius,\r\nafter routing Franks, Burgundians, and Visigoths, overwhelmed the vast\r\nhost of Attila's Huns; and in a later age the single unsleeping brain of\r\nBelisarius, scantily weaponed with men and money by a jealous sovereign,\r\ncould drive back from Rome in shame and ruin all the barbarian levy of\r\nWittich.[460]\r\n\r\n     As against the \"Teutonic\" theory of Italian regeneration, a hearing\r\n     may reasonably be claimed for the \"Etruscan,\" thus set forth:--\"The\r\n     Etruscans were undoubtedly one of the most remarkable nations of\r\n     antiquity--the great civilisers of Italy--and their influence not\r\n     only extended over the whole of the ancient world but has affected\r\n     every subsequent age.... That portion of the Peninsula where\r\n     civilisation earliest flourished, whence infant Rome drew her first\r\n     lessons, has in subsequent ages maintained its pre-eminence.... It\r\n     was Etruria which produced Giotto, Brunelleschi, Fra Angelico, Luca\r\n     Signorelli, Fra Bartolomeo, Michael Angelo, Hildebrand, 'the starry\r\n     Galileo,' and such a noble band of painters, sculptors and\r\n     architects as no other country of modern Europe can boast.\r\n     Certainly no other region of Italy has produced such a galaxy of\r\n     brilliant intellects.... Much may be owing to the natural\r\n     superiority of the race, which, in spite of the revolutions of\r\n     ages, remains essentially the same, and preserves a distinctive\r\n     character.\" (G. Dennis, _The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria_, 3rd\r\n     ed. 1883, Introd. vol. i, pp. cii-iv.) Assumption for assumption,\r\n     this is as defensible as the others.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in Italy after Odoaker was that, for sheer lack of unitary\r\ngovernment on the part of the invaders, the cities, which preserved the\r\nseeds and norms of the old civilisation, gradually grew into new organic\r\nlife. Under the early Empire they had been disarmed and unwalled, to\r\nmake them incapable of revolt. Aurelian, stemming the barbarian tide,\r\nbegan to wall them afresh; but, as we have seen, the withdrawal of the\r\nseat of empire left Italy economically incapable of action on an\r\nimperial scale; and the personal imbecility of such emperors as Honorius\r\nfilled up the cup of the humiliation of what once was Rome. But the\r\ninvaders on the whole did little better; and the material they brought\r\nwas more hopeless than what they found. The passage from full barbarism\r\nto order and civilisation cannot conceivably be made in one generation\r\nor one age. Athaulf, the able successor of Alaric, passed his competent\r\njudgment on the matter in words which outweigh all the rhetoric of\r\nmodern romanticism: \"He was wont to say that his warmest wish had at\r\nfirst been to obliterate the Roman name, and to make one sole Gothic\r\nempire, so that all that which had been Romania should be called Gothia,\r\nand that he, Athaulf, should play the same part as did Caesar Augustus.\r\nBut when by much experience he was convinced that the Goths were\r\nincapable of obedience to laws, because of their unbridled barbarism,\r\nand that the State without laws would cease to be a State, he had chosen\r\nto seek glory in rebuilding its integrity and increasing the Roman power\r\nby Gothic forces, so that posterity should at least regard him as the\r\nrestorer of the empire which he was unable to replace. Therefore he\r\nstrove to avoid war and to establish peace.\"[461]\r\n\r\nIt needed only command of the machinery of systematic government--if\r\nindeed the same qualities had not been in full play long before--to\r\ndevelop in the Teutons every species of evil that could be charged\r\nagainst the Southerns. The fallacy of attributing the crimes of\r\nByzantium to the physiological degeneration of an \"old\" race is exposed\r\nthe moment we compare the record with the history of the Franks, as told\r\nby Gregory of Tours. Christian writers continue to hold up Nero as a\r\ntypical product of decadent paganism, saying nothing of the Christian\r\nChilperic, \"the Nero of France,\" or of his father, less ill-famed,\r\nClothaire, the slayer of children, the polygamist, the strictly orthodox\r\nChurchman, \"certain that Jesus Christ will remunerate us for all the\r\ngood we do\" to his priests.[462] Odious women were as powerful in\r\nFrankish courts as in Byzantine; and the tale of the end of Brunehild is\r\nnot to be matched in pagan annals. Savage treachery, perjury, parricide,\r\nfratricide, filicide, assassination, massacre, debauchery, are if\r\npossible more constant notes in the tale of the young barbarism, as told\r\nby the admiring saint, than in that of the long-descended civilisation\r\nof Constantinople; and the rank and file seem to have been worthy of the\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n     One note of Gibbon's, on \"barbaric virtue,\" _apropos_ of the\r\n     character of Totila, has given one of his editors (Bohn ed. iv,\r\n     505) the opportunity to assert that the \"natural superiority\" of\r\n     the invaders was manifest wherever they came in contact with their\r\n     civilised antagonists. As if Aurelian and Belisarius were not the\r\n     moral equals of Totila. Yet in a previous note (ch. 38, ed. cited,\r\n     iv, 181) on the Frankish history of Gregory of Tours, Gibbon had\r\n     truly remarked that \"it would not be easy, within the same\r\n     historical space, to find more vice and less virtue.\" On that head\r\n     Sismondi declares (_Histoire des Francais_, ed. 1821, i, 403-4;\r\n     _Fall of the Roman Empire_, i, 263) that \"there was not a\r\n     Merovingian king that was not a father before the age of fifteen\r\n     and decrepit at thirty.\" Dunham (_History of the Germanic Empire_,\r\n     1834, i, 10) improves on this to the extent of asserting that\r\n     \"those abominable princes generally--such were their premature\r\n     vices--died of old age before thirty.\" It is a fair surmise that,\r\n     Clovis being a barbarian of great executive genius (cp. Guizot,\r\n     _Essais sur l'histoire de France_, p. 43), his stock was specially\r\n     liable to degeneration through indulgence. But Motley, whose\r\n     Teutophile and Celtophobe declamation at times reaches nearly the\r\n     lowest depth touched by his school, will have it (_Rise of the\r\n     Dutch Republic_, ed. 1863, p. 12) that later \"the Carlovingian\r\n     _race_ had been exhausted by _producing a race_ of heroes.\" Any\r\n     formula avails to support the dogma that \"the German was loyal as\r\n     the Celt was dissolute\" (_id._ p. 6).\r\n\r\n     It is perhaps arguable that the early Teuton had a moral code\r\n     peculiar to himself. Sismondi (_Fall_, i, 246) remarks, concerning\r\n     Clothaire's son Gontran, called by Gregory \"the good king Gontran,\"\r\n     as compared with his brothers: \"His morality indeed passed for\r\n     good; he is only known to have had two wives and one mistress, and\r\n     he repudiated the first before he married the second; his temper\r\n     was, moreover, reputed to be a kindly one, for, with the exception\r\n     of his wife's physician, who was hewn in pieces because he was\r\n     unable to cure her; of his two brothers-in-law, whom he caused to\r\n     be assassinated; and of his bastard brother, Gondebald, who was\r\n     slain by treachery, no other act of cruelty is recorded of him than\r\n     that he razed the town of Cominges to the ground and massacred all\r\n     the inhabitants, men, women, and children.\" Sismondi has also\r\n     appreciated (p. 205) what Gibbon has missed, the point of the\r\n     letter of St. Avitus to Gondebald of Burgundy, who had killed his\r\n     three brothers, exhorting him \"to weep no longer with such\r\n     ineffable piety the death of his brothers, since it was the good\r\n     fortune of the kingdom which diminished the number of persons\r\n     invested with royal authority, and preserved to the world such only\r\n     as were necessary to rule it.\" Cp. Sismondi's _Hist. des Francais_,\r\n     i, 173.\r\n\r\nA great name, such as Theodoric's, tends to dazzle the eye that looks\r\non the history of the time; but the great name, on scrutiny, is seen to\r\nstand for all the progress made in a generation. Theodoric, though he\r\nwould never learn to read,[463] had a civilised education as regards the\r\narts of government, and what was masterly in his rule may at least as\r\nwell be attributed to that as to his barbaric stock.[464] It is\r\nimportant to note that in his reign, by reason of being forced to live\r\non her own products, Italy actually attains the capacity to export grain\r\nafter feeding herself[465]--a result to which the king's rule may\r\nconceivably have contributed.[466] In any case, the able ruler\r\nrepresents but a moment of order in an epic of anarchy.[467] After\r\nTheodoric, four kings in turn are assassinated, each by his successor;\r\nand the new monarchy begins to go the way of the old. What Belisarius\r\nbegan Narses finished, turning to his ends the hatreds between the\r\nTeutonic tribes. Narses gone, a fresh wave of barbarism flowed in under\r\nAlboin the Longobard, who in due course was assassinated by his outraged\r\nwife; and his successor was assassinated in turn. Yet again, the new\r\nbarbarism began to wear all the features of disorderly decay; and the\r\nLongobard kingdom subsisted for over two hundred years, under twenty-one\r\nkings, without decisively conquering Venetia, or the Romagna, or Rome,\r\nor the Greek municipalities of the south.[468] Then came the Frankish\r\nconquest, completed under Charlemagne, on the invitation of the Pope,\r\ngiven because the Franks were good Athanasians and the Longobards\r\nArians. The great emperor did what a great man could to civilise his\r\nbarbarian empire; but instead of fitting it to subsist without him he\r\ndestroyed what self-governing power it had.[469] Soon after his death,\r\naccordingly, the stone rolled downhill once more; and when Otto of\r\nSaxony entered Rome in 951, Italy had undergone five hundred years of\r\nTeutonic domination without owing to Teuton activity, save indirectly,\r\none step in civil progress.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that, while barbaric imperialism has different aspects\r\nfrom that of \"civilisation,\" having a possible alterative virtue where\r\nthe conditions are in themselves stagnant, even then its work is at best\r\nnegative, and never truly constructive. Charlemagne's work, being one of\r\npersonal ambition, was in large part destructive even where it\r\nostensibly made for civilisation; and at his death the Germanic world\r\nwas as literally degenerate, in the sense of being enfeebled for\r\nself-defence, as was the Roman world in the period of its imperial\r\ndecay.[470] It is true that, despite the political chaos which followed\r\non the disintegration of his system, there is henceforth no such\r\napparent continuity of decadence as had followed on the Merovingian\r\nconquest,[471] and his period shows a new intellectual activity.[472]\r\nBut it is a fallacy to suppose that he created this activity, which is\r\ntraceable to many sources. At most, Charlemagne furthered general\r\ncivilisation by forcing new culture contacts in Central Europe[473], and\r\nbringing capable men from other countries, notably Alcuin, but also many\r\nfrom Ireland.[474] But these favourable conditions were not permanent;\r\nthere was no steady evolution; and we are left asking whether progress\r\nmight not have occurred in a higher degree had the emperor's work been\r\nleft unattempted.[475] In any case, it is long after his time that\r\ncivilisation is seen to make a steady recovery; and there is probably\r\njustice in the verdict of Sismondi, that Otto, an administrator of no\r\nless capacity than Charlemagne, did more for it than he.[476] Guizot,\r\nwhile refusing to admit that the work of Charlemagne passed away, admits\r\nSismondi's proposition that in the tenth century civilised society in\r\nEurope was dissolving in all directions.[477] The subsequent new life\r\ncame not of imperialism but of the loosening of empire, and not from the\r\nTeuton world but from the Latin. It is from the new municipal\r\ndevelopments inferribly set up before and under Otto[478] that the fresh\r\ngrowth derives.\r\n\r\nMommsen, in one of those primitively biassed anti-Celtic passages which\r\nbar his pretensions to rank as a philosophic historian, declares of the\r\nelusive Celtae of antiquity, in dogged disregard of the question (so\r\noften put by German scholars and so often answered against him[479])\r\nwhether they were not Germans, that, \"always occupied with combats and\r\nheroic actions, they were scattered far and wide, from Ireland to Spain\r\nand Asia Minor; but all their enterprises melted like snow in spring;\r\nthey created nowhere a great State, and developed no specific\r\ncivilisation.\"[480] The passage would be exactly as true if written of\r\nthe Teutons. Every tendency and quality which Mommsen in this\r\ncontext[481] specifies as Celtic is strictly applicable to the race\r\nsupposed to be so different from the Celts. \"Attachment to the natal\r\nsoil, so characteristic of the Italians and _Germans_, was foreign to\r\nthem.... Their political constitution was imperfect; not only was their\r\nnational unity feebly recognised,[482] as happens with all nations at\r\ntheir outset, but the separate communities were lacking in unity of aim,\r\nin solid control, in serious political sentiment, and in persistence.\r\nThe sole organisation of which they were capable was the military,[483]\r\nin which the ties of discipline dispensed the individual from personal\r\nefforts.\" \"They preferred the pastoral life to agriculture.\" \"Always we\r\nfind them ready to roam, or, in other words, to begin the march ...\r\nfollowing the profession of arms as a system of organised pillage\"; and\r\nso on. Such were in strict truth the peculiarities of the Germani, from\r\nTacitus to the Middle Ages; while, on the contrary, there is plenty of\r\nevidence that not merely the Gauls but the Britons of Caesar's day were\r\nmuch better agriculturists than the Germani.[484]\r\n\r\nIn the early stage the Germani actually shifted their ground every\r\nyear;[485] and for every migration or crusade recorded of Celtae, three\r\nare recorded of Teutons. The successive swarms who conquered Italy\r\nshowed an almost invincible repugnance to the practice of agriculture;\r\nin the mass they knew no law and no ideal save the military; they were\r\nconstantly at tribal war with each other, Frank with Longobard and Goth\r\nwith Burgundian; Ostrogoths and Gepidae fought on the side of Attila at\r\nChalons against Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians, and Saxons; they had no\r\nidea of racial unity; and not one of their kingdoms ever went well for\r\ntwo successive generations. The story of the Merovingians is one\r\nnightmare of ferocious discord; that of the Suevi in Spain, and of the\r\nVisigoths in Aquitaine, is mainly a memory of fratricide. As regards\r\norganisation, the only Teutonic kings who ever made any headway were\r\nthose who, like Theodoric, had a civilised education, or, like the great\r\nCharles and Louis the Second, eagerly learned all that Roman tradition\r\ncould teach them. The main stock were so incapable of political\r\ncombination that, after the deposition of the last incapable\r\nCarlovingian (888), they could not arrest their anarchy even to resist\r\nthe Huns and Saracens. Their later conquests of Italy came to nothing;\r\nand in the end, by the admission of Teutonic men of science,[486] there\r\nis nothing to show, in all the southern lands they once conquered, that\r\nthey had ever been there. The supposed type has disappeared; the\r\nlanguage never imposed itself; the Vandal kingdom in Africa went down\r\nlike a house of cards before Belisarius;[487] the Teutondom of Spain was\r\nswept away by the Moors, and it was finally the mixed population that\r\nthere effected the reconquest. No race had ever a fairer opportunity\r\nthan the Visigoths in Spain, with a rich land and an undivided monarchy.\r\n\"Yet after three centuries of undisputed enjoyment, their rule was\r\noverthrown at once and for ever by a handful of marauders from Africa.\r\nThe Goth ... had been weighed in the balance and found wanting.\"[488] In\r\nSpain, France, and Italy alike, the language remained Romance; \"not a\r\nword is to be found in the local nomenclature of Castile, nor yet of the\r\nAsturias, to tell the tale of the Visigoth\";[489] even in England, where\r\nalso the Teutonic peoples for six hundred years failed to attain either\r\nprogressive civilisation or political order, the Norman conquerors,\r\nspeaking a Romance language, vitally modified by it the vocabulary of\r\nthe conquered. So flagrant are the facts that Savigny and Eichhorn in\r\ntheir day both gave the opinion that \"the German nations have had to run\r\nthrough their history with an ingrained tendency in their character\r\ntowards political dismemberment and social inequality.\" The contrary\r\ntheory was a later development.[490]\r\n\r\nIf, instead of seeking simply for the scientific truth, we sought to\r\nmeet Teutomania with Celtomania, we might argue that it was only where\r\nthere was a Celtic basis that civilisation prospered in the tracks of\r\nthe Roman Empire.[491] Mommsen, in the passage first above cited,\r\ndeclares that the Celts, meaning the Cisalpine Galli, \"loved to assemble\r\nin towns and villages, which consequently grew and gained in importance\r\namong the Celts sooner than in the rest of Italy\"--this just after\r\nalleging that they preferred pastoral life to agriculture, and just\r\nbefore saying that they were always on the march. If the first statement\r\nbe true, it would seem to follow that the Celts laid the groundwork of\r\nmedieval Italian civilisation; for it was in the towns of what had been\r\nCisalpine Gaul that that civilisation flourished. Parts of Northern\r\nItaly had in fact been comparatively unaffected by the process which\r\nrooted out the peasantry in the South; and there was agriculture and\r\npopulation in the valley of the Po when they had vanished from large\r\nareas around and south of Rome.[492] It is certain that \"Celtic\"\r\nGaul--whence Charlemagne (semi-civilised by the old environment) wrought\r\nhard, but almost in vain, to impose civilisation on Germany--reached\r\nunity and civilisation in the Middle Ages, while Germany remained\r\ndivided and semi-barbaric; that Ireland preserved classical learning and\r\ngave it back to the rest of Europe when it had well-nigh disappeared\r\nthence;[493] that England was civilised only after the Norman Conquest;\r\nand that Germany, utterly disrupted by the Reformation where France\r\nregained unity, was so thrown back in development by her desperate\r\nintestine strifes that only in the eighteenth century did she begin to\r\nproduce a modern literature. One of the most flagrant of modern fables\r\nis that which credits to \"Teutonic genius\" the great order of church\r\narchitecture which arose in medieval and later France.[494] \"That\r\nsublime manifestation of 'poetry in stone' so strangely called Gothic\r\narchitecture is not only not Visigothic, but it was unknown in Spain for\r\nfour hundred years after the destruction of the Goths.\"[495] The Goth\r\nwas not a builder but a wrecker.\r\n\r\nBut if anything has been proved by the foregoing analyses, it is that\r\nrace theories are, for the most part, survivals of barbaric\r\npseudo-science; that culture stage and not race (save as regards the\r\nneed for mixture), conditions and not hereditary character, are the\r\nclues to the development of all nations, \"race\" being a calculable\r\nfactor only where many thousands of years of given environments have\r\nmade a conspicuous similarity of type, setting up a disadvantageous\r\nhomogeneity. It was simply their prior and fuller contact with Greece\r\nand Rome, and further their greater mixture of stocks, that civilised\r\nthe Galli so much earlier than the Germani. On the other hand, the\r\nnational failure in Spain and Italy of the Teutonic stocks, as such,\r\nproves only that idle northern barbarians, imposing themselves as a\r\nwarrior caste on an industrious southern population, were (1) not good\r\nmaterial for industrial development, and (2) were probably at a\r\nphysiological disadvantage in the new climate. Southerners would\r\ndoubtless have failed similarly in Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n     I know of no thorough investigation of the amalgamation of the\r\n     stocks, or the absorption or disappearance of the northern. There\r\n     is some reason to suppose that early in Rome's career of conquest\r\n     there began in the capital a substitution of more southerly\r\n     physiological types--eastern and Spanish--for those of the early\r\n     Latins. But the Italians at all times seem to have undergone a\r\n     climatic selection which adapted them to Italy, where the\r\n     northerners, whether Celt or Teuton, were not so adapted. The\r\n     supposed divergence of character between northern and southern\r\n     Italians, insisted on by the former in our own time, certainly\r\n     cannot be explained by any Teutonic intermixture; for the Teutons\r\n     were settled in all parts of Italy, and nowhere does the\r\n     traditional blond type remain. Exactly such differences, it should\r\n     be remembered, are locally alleged as between Norwegians and Danes,\r\n     northern and southern Germans, and northern and southern English.\r\n     If there be any real generic and persistent difference of\r\n     temperament (there is none in variety of moral bias and mental\r\n     capacity) or of nervous energy, it is presumably to be traced to\r\n     climate. Some aspects of the problem are discussed at length in\r\n     _The Saxon and the Celt_, pt. i, Sec.Sec. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThe new life of Italy, so to speak, came of the ultimate impotence of\r\nthe northern invaders for imperialism. Again and again, from the time of\r\nOdoaker, we find signs of a growth of new life in the cities, now partly\r\nthrown on their own resources; and it is only the too great stress of\r\nthe subsequent invasions that postpones their fuller growth for so many\r\ncenturies. It is to be remembered that these invasions wrought absolute\r\ndevastation where, even under Roman rule, there had been comparative\r\nwell-being. Thus the province of Illyria, between the Alps and the\r\nDanube, whose outlying and exposed character made it unattractive to the\r\nsenatorial monopolists, was under the Empire well populated by a free\r\npeasantry, who abundantly recruited the army.[496] In the successive\r\ninvasions this population was almost obliterated; and when Odoaker\r\nconquered the Rugians, who then held the territory, he brought\r\nmultitudes of them into stricken Italy, to people and cultivate its\r\nwaste lands.[497] Theodoric, in turn, is held to have revived prosperity\r\nafter overthrowing Odoaker; and we have seen reason to believe that\r\nafter the loss of Africa even southern Italy perforce revived her\r\nagriculture;[498] but early in Theodoric's reign (496) we find Pope\r\nGelasius declaring, doubtless with exaggeration, that in the provinces\r\nof Aemilia and Tuscany human life was almost extinct; while Ambrose\r\nwrites that Bologna, Modena, Reggio, Piacenza, and the adjacent country\r\nremained ruined and desolate.[499] After Theodoric, Belisarius, in a\r\nstruggle that exhausted central Italy, almost annihilated the Goths; and\r\nunder Narses, who finished the conquest, there was again some recovery,\r\nthe scattered remnants of the population congregating in the towns, so\r\nthat Milan and others made fresh headway,[500] though the country\r\nremained in large part deserted.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to have been the turning-point in the long welter of\r\nItalian history. The Longobard conquest under Alboin forced on the\r\nprocess of driving the older inhabitants into the cities. The\r\nOstrogothic kings, while they unwalled the towns they captured, had\r\nfortified Pavia, which was able to resist Alboin for four years, thus\r\ngiving the other towns their lesson; and as he advanced the natives fled\r\nbefore him to Venice, to Genoa, to the cities of the Pentapolis, to\r\nPisa, to Rome, to Gaeta, to Naples, and to Amalfi.[501] Above all, the\r\ncities of the coast, still adhering to the Greek Empire, and impregnable\r\nfrom land, were now allowed to retain for their own defence the revenue\r\nthey had formerly paid to Constantinople; Naples won the right to elect\r\nher own dukes; and Venice won the status of an equal ally of\r\nByzantium.[502] Thus once more there began to grow up, in tendency if\r\nnot in form and name, republics of civilised and industrious men, in the\r\nteeth of barbarism and under the shadow of the name of empire.[503] Even\r\nin the eighth and ninth centuries the free populations of Rome and\r\nRavenna were enrolled under the four heads of _clerici_, _optimates\r\nmilitiae_, the _milites_ or _exercitus_, and the _cives onesti_ or free\r\n_populus_.[504] Beneath all were the great mass of unfree; but here at\r\nleast was a beginning of new municipal life. The Longobards had not, as\r\nhas been so often written, revived the spirit of liberty; conquest is\r\nthe negation of the reciprocity in which alone liberty subsists; but\r\nthey had driven other men into the conditions where the idea of liberty\r\ncould revive; and in so far as \"Lombard\" civilisation in the next two\r\nhundred years distanced that of the Franks,[505] it was owing to the\r\nrevival of old industries in the towns and the reactions of the other\r\nItalian cities, no less than to the renewed growth of rural population\r\nand agriculture.\r\n\r\n     Sismondi (_Republiques_, i, 55, 402-5; _Fall_, i, 242) uses the\r\n     conventional phrase as to the Longobards reviving the spirit of\r\n     freedom, while actually showing its fallacy. In his _Short History\r\n     of the Italian Republics_ (p. 13), he tells in the same breath that\r\n     the invaders \"introduced\" several of their sentiments,\r\n     \"particularly the habit of independence and resistance to\r\n     authority,\" and that in their conquests they considered the\r\n     inhabitants \"their property equally with the land.\" Dunham (_Europe\r\n     in the Middle Ages_, 1835, i, 8) similarly speaks of the Longobards\r\n     as \"infusing a new spirit\" into the \"slavish minds of the\r\n     Italians,\" and then proceeds (p. 9) to show that what happened was\r\n     a flight of Italians from Longobard tyranny. He admits further (p.\r\n     17) that the Longobard code of laws was \"less favourable to social\r\n     happiness than almost any other, the Visigothic, perhaps, alone\r\n     excepted\"; and (p. 19) that the Longobards, wherever they could,\r\n     \"destroyed the [free] municipal institutions by subjecting the\r\n     cities to the jurisdiction of the great military feudatories, the\r\n     true and only tyrants of the country.\" Gibbon decides that the\r\n     Longobards possessed freedom to elect their sovereign, and sense to\r\n     decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege (ch. 45, Bohn\r\n     ed. v, 125); but pronounces their government milder and better than\r\n     that of the other new barbarian kingdoms (p. 127). Sismondi again\r\n     (_Fall_, i, 259; so also Boulting in his recast of the\r\n     _Republiques_, p. 8) declares that their laws, for a barbarian\r\n     people, were \"wise and equal.\" The midway truth seems to be that\r\n     the dukes or provincial rulers came to feel some identity of\r\n     interest with their subjects. Later jurists called their laws\r\n     _asininum jus, quoddam jus quod faciebant reges per se_ (Symonds,\r\n     _Renaissance in Italy_, 2nd ed. i, 45).\r\n\r\n     Prof. Butler, in his generally excellent history of _The Lombard\r\n     Communes_, is unduly receptive of the old formula that \"the\r\n     _infusion of Teutonic blood_ had given new life to the Peninsula\"\r\n     (p. 37; also p. 38). His own narrative conflicts with the\r\n     assertion; for he writes that the long isolation of such cities as\r\n     Cremona in the midst of Teuton enemies \"must have led to a\r\n     rekindling of military and municipal spirit and the power of\r\n     initiative\" (p. 35). He notes, too, that the building up of a new\r\n     and active \"aristocracy\" in the cities from plebeian elements was\r\n     hateful to the Teuton, as represented by Otto of Freisingen in the\r\n     time of Barbarossa (p. 48). And what had the Teutons to do with the\r\n     making of Venice? And what of the similar movement in Spain,\r\n     Africa, Illyria, and Gaul?\r\n\r\n     If the foregoing criticism be valid, it must be further turned\r\n     against the expressions of Bishop Stubbs concerning the effect of\r\n     the Teutonic conquest in setting up the Romance literatures. \"The\r\n     breath of life of the new literatures,\" he writes (_Const. Hist._\r\n     4th ed. i, 7), \"was Germanic.... The poetry of the new nations is\r\n     that of the leading race ... even in Italy it owes all its\r\n     sweetness and light to the _freedom_ which has breathed from beyond\r\n     the Alps.\" Here the thesis shifts unavowedly from \"race\" to\r\n     \"freedom,\" and all the while no data whatever are offered for\r\n     generalisations which decide in a line some of the root problems of\r\n     sociology. A laborious scholar can thus write as if in matters of\r\n     total historic generalisation there were needed neither proof nor\r\n     argument, while the most patient research is needed to settle a\r\n     single detail of particular history.\r\n\r\n     On the whole, it may be psychologically accurate to say that the\r\n     invaders, by setting up a new caste of freemen where before all\r\n     classes were alike subordinate to the imperial tyranny, created a\r\n     variation in the direction of a new self-government, the spectacle\r\n     of privilege stimulating the unprivileged to desire it. But any\r\n     conquest whatever might do this; and it is a plain paralogism to\r\n     conclude that where the subjugated people does _not_ react the\r\n     fault is its own, while where it does the credit is to go to the\r\n     conquerors. It does not seem to have occurred to anyone to reason\r\n     that the Norman Conquest of England was as such the bringer of the\r\n     liberty later achieved there. Yet, as regards the Teutonic\r\n     invasions of Italy, the principle passes current on all sides; and\r\n     Guizot endorses it in one lecture (_Hist. de la civ. en France_, i,\r\n     7ieme lecon, _end_), though in the next he gives an objective\r\n     account which practically discredits it.\r\n\r\n     As regards the ideals of justice and freedom in general, the\r\n     Teutonic laws, being framed not for a normal barbarian state but\r\n     for a society of conquerors and conquered, were in some respects\r\n     rather more iniquitous than the Roman. In particular the\r\n     Ostrogothic laws of Theodoric and his son punish the crimes of the\r\n     rich by fines, and put to death the poor for the same offences;\r\n     while the degradation of the slave is in all the early Teutonic\r\n     codes constantly insisted on. (Cp. Milman, _Hist. Lat. Chr._ 4th\r\n     ed. ii, 36, and refs. Roman law also, however, differed in practice\r\n     for rich and poor. Cp. Cassiodorus, l. ii, pp. 24, 25; iii, 20, 36;\r\n     iv, 39; v, 14, and Finlay, ed. cited. i, 236.) Whether or not\r\n     Gregory the Great, as has been asserted (Milman, as cited, p. 52),\r\n     was the first to free slaves on the principle of human equality, he\r\n     did not get the idea from the Teutons.\r\n\r\nIt took centuries, in any case, to develop the new upward tendency to a\r\ndecisive degree. The Frankish conquest, like others, disarmed and\r\nunwalled the population as far as possible; and it seems to have been\r\nonly in the tenth century, when the Hungarians repeatedly raided\r\nnorthern Italy (900-24), and the Saracens the southern coasts and the\r\nisles, that a general permission was given to the towns to defend\r\nthemselves.[506] This time the balance of power lay with the defence;\r\nand to the mere disorderliness of the barbarian rule on one hand may in\r\npart be attributed the relative success of the cities of the later\r\nEmpire as compared with those of the earlier. Latin Rome had not only\r\ndisarmed its cities but accustomed them for centuries to ease and\r\nidleness; and before a numerous foe, bent on conquest, they made no\r\nresistance. Goths, Longobards, and Franks in turn sought to keep all but\r\ntheir own strong places disarmed; but their system could not wholly\r\nprevent the growth of a militant spirit in the industrial towns. On the\r\nother hand, the Hungarians and Saracens were bent not on conquest but on\r\nmere plunder, and were thus manageable foes. Had the Normans, say, come\r\nat this time into Italy, they could have overrun the quasi-Teutonic\r\ncommunities as easily as the Teutons had done the Romans or each other.\r\nBut the conditions being as they were, the swing was towards the\r\nindependence of the cities; at first under the headship of the bishops,\r\nwho in the period of collapse of the Carlovingian empire obtained part\r\nof the authority previously wielded by counts.[507] At this stage the\r\nbishop was by his position partly identified with the people, whom he\r\nwould on occasion champion against the counts. Thus a new conception of\r\nsocial organisation was shaped by the pressures of the times; and when\r\nOtto came in 951 the foundations of the republics were laid. The next\r\nstage was the effacement of the authority of the counts within the\r\ncities; the next an extension of the bishops' authority over the whole\r\ndiocese, which was as a rule the old Roman _civitas_ or county. Thus the\r\nnew municipalities came into being partly under the aegis of the Church.\r\n\r\n     Hallam (_Middle Ages_, ch. iii, pt. i) describes Sismondi as\r\n     stating that Otto \"erected\" the Lombard cities into municipal\r\n     communities, and dissents from that view. But Sismondi\r\n     (_Republiques_, i, 95) expressly says that there are no charters,\r\n     and that the municipal independence of the cities is to be inferred\r\n     from their subsequent claims of prescription. As there is nothing\r\n     to show for any regular government from the outside in the\r\n     preceding period of turmoil, the inference that _some_\r\n     self-government existed before and under Otto is really forced upon\r\n     us. Ranke (_Latin and Teutonic Nations_, Eng. tr. p. 11) pronounces\r\n     that the first _consuls_ of the Italian cities, chosen by\r\n     themselves, appear at the date of the first Crusade, 1100. \"Beyond\r\n     all question, we meet with them first in Genoa on the occasion of\r\n     an expedition to the Holy Land.\" (They appear again in 1117 at a\r\n     meeting of reconciliation for all Lombardy at Milan. Prof. W.F.\r\n     Butler, _The Communes of Lombardy_, 1906, pp. 76-77.) But this\r\n     clearly does not exclude prior forms of self-government for\r\n     domestic needs. Consuls of some kind are noted \"in Fano and other\r\n     places in 883; in Rome in 901; Orvieto, 975; Ravenna, 990; Ferrara,\r\n     1015; Pisa and Genoa, 1100; Florence, 1101.\" Boulting-Sismondi, p.\r\n     63. (This last date appears to be an error. The document hitherto\r\n     dated 1102 belongs to 1182. Villari, _Two First Centuries of\r\n     Florentine History_, Eng. tr. pp. 55, 84. But there is documentary\r\n     evidence for Florentine consuls in 1136. _Id._ p. 115.) Hallam\r\n     himself points out that in the years 1002-6 the annalists, in\r\n     recording the wars of the cities, speak \"of the people and not of\r\n     their leaders, which is the true republican tone of history\"; and\r\n     notes that a contemporary chronicle shows the people of Pavia and\r\n     Milan acting as independent states in 1047.\r\n\r\n     This state of things would naturally arise when the emperor and the\r\n     nobles lived in a state of mutual jealousy. Cp. Bryce, _Holy Roman\r\n     Empire_, pp. 127-29, 139-40, 150, 176. Mr. Bryce does not attempt\r\n     to clear up the dispute, but he recognises that the liberties of\r\n     the cities would naturally \"shoot up in the absence of the emperors\r\n     and the feuds of the princes.\" And this is the view finally of\r\n     Heinrich Leo: \"Seit Otto bemerken wir eine auffallende Aenderung in\r\n     der Politik der ganzen noerdlichen Italiens\" (_Geschichte von\r\n     Italien_, 1829, i, 325; Bk. iv, Kap. i, Sec. 1). Leo points out that\r\n     the granting of exemptions to the north Italian cities came from\r\n     the Ottos. \"It was not, however,\" he goes on, \"as it has been\r\n     supposed we must assume, the blending of Roman _citizenship_ (which\r\n     in the Lombard cities had never existed[508] in the form of commune\r\n     or municipality [_Gemeinde_]) with the Lombard and German, but the\r\n     blending of the survivors and the labourers, mostly of Roman\r\n     descent, with the almost entirely German-derived free _Gemeinde_,\r\n     through which the exemptions were obtained, and which gave a new\r\n     aspect to the Italian cities\" (pp. 326-27).\r\n\r\n     Similarly Karl Hegel, after noting the analogies between Roman\r\n     _collegia_ and German gilds, decides that \"the German gilds were of\r\n     native (_einheimischen_) origin, the same needs setting up the same\r\n     order of institutions.\" He adds that the Christian Church first\r\n     evoked in the gilds a real brotherly feeling. (_Staedte und Gilden\r\n     der germanischen Voelker in Mittelalter_, 1891, Einleit. p. 10.) He\r\n     admits, however, that the gilds, when first traced under\r\n     Charlemagne, are forbidden under the name _Gildonia_, as\r\n     oath-societies; and that they seem to have been unknown among the\r\n     Franks (pp. 4, 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nAlmost concurrently with the new growth of political life in the cities,\r\nrural life readjusted itself under a system concerning the merits of\r\nwhich there has been as much dispute as concerning its origins--the\r\nsystem of feudalism. Broadly speaking, that began in the relation\r\nbetween the leaders of the Germanic invasion and their chief followers,\r\nwho, receiving lands as their share, or at another time as a reward,\r\nwere expected as a matter of course to back the king in time of war, and\r\nin their turn ruled their lands and retainers on that principle. When\r\nthe principle of heredity was established as regarded the crown, it was\r\nnecessarily affirmed as regards land tenures; and soon it was applied\r\nas a matter of course to nearly all the higher royal offices and\r\n\"benefices\" in the Frankish empire,[509] which after Charlemagne became\r\nthe model for the Germanic and the French and English kingdoms. Thus\r\n\"the aristocratic system was in possession of society\"; and the conflict\r\nwhich inevitably arose between the feudal baronage and the monarchic\r\npower served in time to aggrandise the cities, whose support was so\r\nimportant to both sides.\r\n\r\n     [See Stubbs, _Constitutional History of England_, 4th ed. i,\r\n     273-74, _note_, for a sketch of the discussion as to the rise of\r\n     feudalism. It has been obscured, especially among the later\r\n     writers, by lack of regard for exact and consistent statement. Thus\r\n     Bishop Stubbs endorses Waitz's dictum that \"the gift of an estate\r\n     by the king involved no _defined_ obligation of service\"; going on\r\n     to say (p. 275) that a king's _beneficium_ was received \"with a\r\n     _special undertaking_ to be faithful\"; and again adding the\r\n     footnote: \"Not a _promise_ of _definite_ service, but a _pledge_ to\r\n     _continue faithful in the conduct in consideration of which the\r\n     reward is given_.\" Again, the bishop admits that by this condition\r\n     the giver had a hold on the land, \"through which he was able to\r\n     enforce fidelity\" (p. 275, _note_); yet goes on to say (p. 277)\r\n     that homage and fealty \"depended on conscience only for their\r\n     fulfilment.\" Bishop Stubbs further remarks (i, 278) that there was\r\n     a \"_great difference in social results_ between French (= Frankish)\r\n     and German feudalism,\" by reason of the prostrate state of the old\r\n     Gallic population; going on however to add: \"But the _result was\r\n     the same_, feudal government, a graduated system of jurisdiction\r\n     based on land tenure, in which every lord judged, taxed, and\r\n     commanded the class next below him; in which abject slavery formed\r\n     the lowest, and irresponsible tyranny the highest grade; in which\r\n     private war, private coinage, private prisons, took the place of\r\n     the imperial institutions of government.\" Of course the bishop has\r\n     previously (p. 274, _note_) endorsed Waitz's view, that \"_all_ the\r\n     people were bound to be faithful to the king\"; but the passage\r\n     above cited seems to be his final generalisation.]\r\n\r\nWhatever its social value, the feudal system is essentially a blend of\r\nRoman and barbarian points of polity; and in France, the place of its\r\ndevelopment, Gallic usage played a modifying part. It is dubiously\r\ndescribed as growing up \"from two great sources--the _beneficium_ and\r\nthe practice of commendation\"--the first consisting (_a_) in gifts of\r\nland by the kings out of their own estates, and (_b_) in surrenders of\r\nland to churches or powerful men, on condition that the surrenderer\r\nholds it as tenant for rent or service; while commendation consisted in\r\nbecoming a vassal without any surrender of title. \"The union of the\r\nbeneficiary tie with that of commendation completed the idea of feudal\r\nobligation.\" The _beneficium_ again, \"is partly of Roman, partly of\r\nGerman origin,\" and \"the reduction of a large Roman population,\"\r\nnominally freemen under the Roman system, \"to dependence,\" placed it on\r\na common footing with the German semi-free cultivator, \"and conduced to\r\nthe wide extension of the institution. Commendation, on the other hand,\r\nmay have had a Gallic or Celtic origin....\" In one or other of these\r\ndevelopments, the German _comitatus_ or chief's war-band, originally so\r\ndifferent, \"ultimately merged its existence.\" On the whole, then, the\r\nTeutons followed Gallo-Roman leads.\r\n\r\n     [See Stubbs, i, 275, 276; cp. p. 4; and Bryce, _Holy Roman Empire_,\r\n     pp. 123-24. Under Otto, observes Mr. Bryce (p. 125), \"the\r\n     institutions of primitive Germany were almost all gone.\" Elsewhere\r\n     Bishop Stubbs decides (p. 10) that \"the essence of feudal law is\r\n     custom,\" and again (p. 71), that \"no creative genius can be\r\n     expected among the rude leaders of the tribes of North Germany. The\r\n     new life started at the point at which the old had been broken\r\n     off.\" Then in the matter of the feudal system, \"the old\" must have\r\n     been mainly the Gallo-Roman, for feudalism arose in Frankish Gaul,\r\n     not in Germany. In an early passage (p. 3) Dr. Stubbs confuses\r\n     matters by describing the government of France as \"originally\r\n     little more than a simple adaptation of the old German polity to\r\n     the government of a conquered race,\" but proceeds to admit that\r\n     \"the Franks, gradually uniting in religion, blood, and language\r\n     with the [Romanised] Gauls, retained and developed the idea of\r\n     feudal subordination....\" The rest of the sentence again introduces\r\n     error. For a good general view of the evolution of feudalism see\r\n     Prof. Abdy's _Lectures on Feudalism_, 1890, lect. v-vii.]\r\n\r\nTo pass a moral judgment on this system, either for or against, is to\r\ninvert the problem. It was simply the most stable, or rather the most\r\nelastic arrangement possible in the species of society in which it\r\narose; and we are now concerned with it merely as a conditioning\r\ninfluence in European civilisation. Hallam, severe towards all other\r\nmen's generalisations, lightly pronounces that \"in the reciprocal\r\nservices of lord and vassal, there was ample scope for every magnanimous\r\nand disinterested energy,\" and that \"the heart of man, when placed in\r\ncircumstances which have a tendency to excite them, will seldom be\r\ndeficient in such sentiments.\" On the other hand he concedes that \"the\r\nbulk of the people, it is true, were degraded by servitude,\" though he\r\naffirms that \"this had no connection with the feudal tenures\"; and he is\r\nforced to decide that \"the peace and good order of society were not\r\npromoted by this system. Though private wars did not originate in the\r\nfeudal customs, it is impossible to doubt that they were perpetuated by\r\nso convenient an institution, which indeed owed its universal\r\nestablishment to no other cause.\"[510] The latter judgment sufficiently\r\ncountervails the others; and the claim that feudalism was a school of\r\nmoral discipline, which gradually substituted good faith for bad, will\r\nbe endorsed by few students of the history of feudal times. A more\r\nplausible plea is that of Sismondi, that the feudal nobles of Italy,\r\nfinding themselves resisted in the cities, which they had been wont to\r\nregard as their property, and finding the need of retainers for the\r\ndefence of their castles, affranchised and protected their peasants as\r\nthey had never done before. There resulted, he believes, an extension of\r\nagriculture which greatly increased the population in the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries.[511] This is partially provable, and it gives us the\r\nstandpoint most favourable to feudalism; which on the other hand is seen\r\nin the main to have soon reached its constructive limits, and to have\r\npromoted division no less than union.[512]\r\n\r\nIt is important here to realise how in the new civilisation, with its\r\nnew language, there subsisted simultaneously all of the forms of\r\nspontaneous aggregation which had been evolved in the older Roman life.\r\nThe aristocratic families in their very nomenclature exhibited anew the\r\nold evolution of the system of _gentes_, men being named \"of the\r\nUberti,\" \"of the Buondelmonti,\" and so on. At the same time the\r\nindustrial groups formed _their_ communities, as the _scholae_ of workers\r\nhad done of old; and in the political history of Florence we see\r\nconstitution after constitution built out of political units so formed.\r\nFirst came the primary patriotism of the family stock; then that of the\r\ntrade or industrial group; and only as a balance of these separate and\r\nlargely hostile interests did the City-State subsist. Thus the new\r\nItalian civilisation was on its political side fundamentally and\r\norganically atomistic, civic union being never a primary but always a\r\nsecondary adjustment among groups whose first loyalty was to the primary\r\nfraternity. It was hard enough to evolve out of all this a common civic\r\ninterest: to rise yet higher was impossible to the men of that era. And\r\nall the while the separate corporation of the Church, despite its inner\r\nfeuds, tended to seek its separate interest as against all others.\r\n\r\nAs regards Italy, then, the value of the imperial feudal system,\r\noperating through the machinery of the bishoprics, was that it freed the\r\nenergies of the cities, where alone the higher civilisation could\r\ngerminate; but on the other hand it fostered in them a spirit of\r\nlocalism and separatism[513] that was ultimately fatal. The old Roman\r\nunity had been completely broken up by the invasions, by the strifes of\r\nGoths and Byzantines, by the sheer need for individual defence; and the\r\nempire, warring with the Papacy, fixed the tendency. Genoa, Pisa,\r\nFlorence, Milan, and the smaller cities alike felt and acted as\r\nindependent States, each against the other, forming occasional alliances\r\nonly as separate nations or kings might do. In the ever-changing\r\nconflict of nobles, emperor, pope, cities, and bishops, all parties\r\nalike developed the spirit of self-assertion,[514] and wrought for their\r\nown special incorporation. At times prelates and cities combined against\r\nnobles, as under Conrad the Salic (1035-39), who was forced to revise\r\nthe feudal law and free the remaining serfs; later, members of each\r\nspecies sided with pope or emperor in the strifes of Hildebrandt and\r\nHenry IV and their successors over the question of investitures, till\r\nthe general interest compelled a peace. During these ages of\r\ninconclusive conflict the cities, thus far acting mainly in conjunction\r\nwith their bishops or archbishops, developed their militia; their\r\n_caroccio_ or banner-bearing fighting-car; and their institution of\r\npublic election of consuls. Here the very name tells of the power of the\r\nRoman tradition, as against the supposed capacity of the Teutonic races\r\nfor spontaneous free organisation and self-government--tells too of the\r\nsurvival of a majority of Roman-speaking people even in the upper and\r\nmiddle classes of the cities. We may readily grant, as against Savigny\r\nand his disciples, that the Roman institution of the _curia_ had not\r\nbeen preserved in the cities of Lombardy. There was no reason why it\r\nshould have been, even if the Longobard kings had been inclined to use\r\nit as a means of extorting taxation; for in the last ages of the Empire\r\nit had become detestable to the upper citizens themselves.\r\n\r\n     [Savigny's proposition seems to be sufficiently confuted in a page\r\n     or two by Leo, _Geschichte von Italien_, 1829, i, 82, 83. Karl\r\n     Hegel later wrote a whole treatise to the same effect, _Geschichte\r\n     der Stadtverfassung von Italien_, Leipzig, 1847. See also F. Morin,\r\n     _Origines de la democratie_, 3e ed. 1865, pp. 34-35, 59, 94, 122,\r\n     etc. Guizot uncritically followed Raynouard, who held with or\r\n     anticipated Savigny. As to the general revolt against the _curia_,\r\n     cp. Leo, i, 47, and Guizot, _Civilisation en France_, i, 52-63. As\r\n     to the theory of a Roman basis for the early civic organisation of\r\n     Saxon Britain, cp. Pearson, _History of England during the Early\r\n     and Middle Ages_, 1867, i, 264; Scarth, _Roman Britain_, App. i;\r\n     Stubbs, _Constitutional History of England_, 4th ed. i, 99; and\r\n     Karl Hegel, _Staedte und Gilden der germanischen Voelker im\r\n     Mittelalter_, 1891, Einleit. pp. 10, 33, 34.]\r\n\r\nBut other Roman institutions remained even in the Lombard cities, in\r\nrespect of the organisation of trades and commerce;[515] and apart from\r\nthe Roman survivals at Ravenna,[516] the free cities of the coast, which\r\nhad remained nominally attached to Byzantium, had _their_ elective\r\ninstitutions, not specially democratic, but sufficiently \"free\" to\r\nincite the Lombard towns to similar procedure.[517] Venice in particular\r\nwas moulded from the first by Byzantine influences. \"Industry, commerce,\r\neconomic methods, and financial institutions were affected as much as\r\nmanners, the arts, and even religious life. Greek was the language of\r\neastern trade, and served many Venetians as a second tongue.\"[518]\r\nVenice and Genoa alike developed a national police on Byzantine lines,\r\nprescribing the shape, construction, and manning of vessels[519] in the\r\nvery spirit of late imperial Rome. And the cities of the peninsula could\r\nnot but be similarly influenced. At all events it was in the train of\r\nthese earlier developments, and perhaps in some degree on stimulus from\r\npapal Rome, that the new organic life of the Lombard and Tuscan cities\r\nbegan to develop itself in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The first\r\nseats of new commerce were in those cities to which, as we have seen,\r\nnumbers of the old Italian population had fled before the Gothic\r\ninvaders. Amalfi was such a seat even in the ninth century; and to its\r\nmerchants is credited the first traffic with the East in the Saracen\r\nperiod, as well as the first employment of the mariner's compass in\r\nnavigation.[520] Next flourished Pisa, where also, perhaps, the ancient\r\ncommerce had never wholly died out;[521] then her successful rivals,\r\nGenoa and Venice. And always commerce formed the basis of the revival.\r\n\r\nOnce begun, the new life was extraordinarily energetic on the industrial\r\nand constructive side, the independence and rivalry of so many\r\ncommunities securing for the time the maximum of effort. Already in the\r\nseventh century, indeed, their industry stood for a new era in\r\nhistory.[522] Where before even the men of the cities had gone clad in\r\nskins after the manner of the barbarian conquerors, they now began to\r\nweave for themselves woollen cloths like the civilised ancients.[523]\r\nSoon the art of weaving the finer cloths, which had hitherto been\r\nimported from Greece in so far as they were used at all, followed the\r\nsimpler craft of wool-weaving.[524] It was in these cities that\r\narchitecture may be said to have had its first general revival in\r\nwestern Europe since the beginning of the decay of Rome. Walls, towers,\r\nports, quays, canals, municipal palaces, prisons, churches,\r\ncathedrals--such were the first outward and visible signs of the new era\r\nin Italian civilisation.[525] On these foundations were to follow the\r\nliterature and the art and science which began the civilisation of\r\nmodern Europe, the whole presided over and in part ordered and inspired\r\nby the recovered use of the great system of ancient Roman law, which too\r\nbegan to be redelivered to Europe early in the twelfth century from\r\nItalian Bologna.\r\n\r\n     [The public buildings of the eleventh century are to this day among\r\n     the greatest in Italy. Cp. Sismondi with Testa, _History of the War\r\n     of Frederick I against the Communes of Lombardy_, Eng. trans, p.\r\n     101. Before the tenth century the houses were mostly of wood, and\r\n     thatched with straw or shingles (Testa, p. 11). It seems highly\r\n     probable that the great development of building in the eleventh\r\n     century was due to the sense of a new lease of life which came upon\r\n     Christendom when it was found that the world did not come to an\r\n     end, as had been expected, with the year 1000. That expectation\r\n     must have gone far to paralyse all activity towards the end of the\r\n     tenth century.]\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the common political path to independence had been\r\noriginally by way of the headship of the bishop as against the count,\r\nthat headship in turn disappears during the eleventh century without any\r\nvisible or general cataclysm. It would seem as if, when the obsessing\r\nfear of the end of the world with which men entered the year 1000 had\r\npassed away, the secular spirit recovered new life; and the intimate\r\ntyranny of the feudal representative of the military monarch being no\r\nlonger a danger, the hand of the bishop was in turn thrown off. For a\r\ntime the combination of city and prelate was politically valid, as in\r\nthe case of Archbishop Aribert of Milan, under whose nominal rule the\r\ncivic _caroccio_ seems to have made its appearance; but even Aribert was\r\nshelved before his death, in the course of a civil strife between the\r\npeople and the nobles. Thenceforward, for an age, the great Lombard city\r\npractically ruled itself, the nobles being included in a compromise\r\nbrought about by Lanzone, who, himself a noble, had led the faction of\r\nthe burghers. Fresh strifes followed, in which the succeeding\r\narchbishops bore part; but the virtual autonomy of the city\r\nremained.[526]\r\n\r\nA similar evolution took place throughout northern Italy, in a\r\nsufficiently simple fashion. The bishops were still in large measure\r\nelected by the people, and rival candidates for vacant sees were always\r\nready to outbid each other in surrendering political functions which\r\nwere becoming ever harder to fulfil.[527] Beyond this, the course of the\r\nfinal stage of the emancipation of the cities is not traceable. \"All\r\nthat we can say is that at the opening of the eleventh century the\r\nbishops exercised in the cities the authority which had formerly been\r\nvested in the counts: at the close the cities have reduced the prelates\r\nto insignificance, and stand before us as so many free republics.\"[528]\r\n\"The power of the bishops was the calyx which for a certain time had\r\nkept the flower of Italian life close-packed within the bud. Then the\r\ncalyx weakened and opened, and Italian civic life unfolded itself to the\r\neye to form and bear fruit.\"[529]\r\n\r\nTo this, however, we should add that in Florence the process was\r\nsomewhat different. Under the Franks, Florence was ruled, like other\r\ncities, by a count, who replaced the Longobard duke; and under the later\r\nGermanic empire all Tuscany, and some further territory, is found ruled\r\nby a Marquis, or Markgraf, Ugo, in the tenth century. In the latter part\r\nof the tenth century his descendant Matilda sided with Hildebrandt\r\nagainst the Emperor. At this period Florence was a centre of the papal\r\nmovement of monastic reform; and the people actually rose against a\r\nsimoniacal bishop, whom they fought for five years[530] (1063-68). Here,\r\nunder the rule of Countess Matilda, the republic or \"commune\" is seen\r\ngrowing up rather of its own faculty than by help of the bishop; it\r\nalready calls itself _Populus Florentinus_;[531] and after Matilda's\r\ndeath in 1115, it speedily develops the self-governing functions which\r\nit had partially exercised in her lifetime.[532] And Florence, be it\r\nnoted, was the most democratic in population of the northern cities from\r\nthe beginning.[533]\r\n\r\nIn no case, however, should we be right in supposing that \"republic\" or\r\n\"commune\" or \"free city\" meant a population united in devotion to a\r\ncivic ideal. The eternal impulses of strife and repulsion had in no\r\ndegree been eliminated by the formation of new State units. In Florence\r\nwe find all the elements of Greek _stasis_ at work in the first century\r\nof the commune.[534] Among the _grandi_ were men who had risen from the\r\npeople, and men descended from old feudal houses; and these\r\nspontaneously ranged themselves in factions. Such a division furthered\r\nimperialism by inclining groups to take the side of the emperor, who,\r\nwherever he could, set up his _Podesta_ (_potestas_ or \"authority\") in\r\nthe cities.[535] Imperialistic nobles further formed groups called\r\n\"Societies of the Towers,\" each of which had its common defensive tower\r\nor fort, communicating with the houses of neighbouring members; the\r\nofficials of these societies were at times called consuls; and from\r\nthese were usually chosen, in the early days, the consuls of the\r\ncommune.[536] At times they were also consuls of trade guilds, a state\r\nof things proving a certain amount of assimilation between the trading\r\nand the noble class, who together formed the enfranchised \"people,\" the\r\ntown artisans and the rural cultivators of the surrounding _contado_ or\r\n\"county\" being excluded.\r\n\r\nThe close community thus formed exhibited very much the same political\r\ntendencies as had marked that of early republican Rome. The cities,\r\nconstantly flouted and menaced by the castled nobility of the\r\nsurrounding territory, who blackmailed passing traders, soon learned to\r\nuse the iron hand as against these, who in turn sought the emperor's\r\nprotection; and cities wont to put down nobles were prompt to seek to\r\ncoerce each other. On the death of the Emperor Frederick I (1197),\r\nFlorence set on foot a League of the Tuscan cities, which, while\r\nprimarily hostile to the Empire, repelled the claim of the Papacy to\r\nover-lordship as heir of the Countess Matilda. On such a basis there\r\nmight conceivably have arisen a new and strong national life; but soon\r\nFlorence, like old Athens, was oppressing her allies, who gave their\r\nsympathy to a town like Semifonte, the refuge of all who fled from\r\nplaces conquered and taxed by her. To individual allies like Sienna,\r\nFlorence was substantially faithless, and so strengthened from the first\r\nthe fatal tendency to separatism--this while the inner social sunderance\r\nwas steadily deepening.[537]\r\n\r\nNone of the forces at work was remedial on this side; the regimen of the\r\n_Podesta_, even when he was actually a foreigner, furthered instead of\r\nchecking strife between communities;[538] and the more \"aristocratic\"\r\ncities were at least as quarrelsome as the less. Bologna played the\r\ntyrant city as vigorously as Florence.[539] Rome was among the worst\r\ngoverned of all. In the thirteenth century, under Innocent IV, we find\r\nthe fighting factions of the nobles using the Coliseum and other ancient\r\nmonuments as fortresses, garrisoned by bandits in their pay, who\r\npillaged traders and passengers; and not the Papacy, but the \"senator\"\r\nchosen by the people--a Bolognese noble--put them down, hanging nobles\r\nand bandits alike.[540]\r\n\r\nSuch was civilisation at the centre of Christendom after a thousand\r\nyears of Christianity. The notable fact is that through all this wild\r\nplay of primitive passion there _was_ yet growing up a new Italian\r\ncivilisation; and it is part of our task to trace its causation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: _Germania_, c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: For a good view of the many points in common between\r\nTeutonic barbarism and normal savagery, see the synopsis of Guizot,\r\n_Histoire de la civilisation en France_, i, 7ieme lecon.

The salient differences\r\nwere (1) the Christian Church, with its wealth[541] and its elaborate\r\norganisation; (2) the pretensions of the Empire; and (3) the presence of\r\nfeudal nobles, some of whom were first imposed by the German emperors on\r\nthe cities, and who, after their exodus and their life as\r\ncastle-holders, had in nearly every case compromised with the citizens,\r\nspending some months of every year in their town palaces by stipulation\r\nof the citizens themselves. All of these differentia counted for the\r\nworse to Italy, in comparison with Hellas, as aggravations of the uncured\r\nevil of internal strife. The source of their strength--separateness and\r\nthe need to struggle--was at the same time the source of their bane; for\r\nat no time do we find the Italian republics contemplating durable peace\r\neven as an ideal, or regarding political union as aught save a temporary\r\nexpedient of the state of war.\r\n\r\nOn the familiar assumption of \"race character\" we should accordingly\r\nproceed to decide that the Italians, by getting mixed with the Teutons,\r\nhad lost the \"instinct of union\" which built up Rome. Those who credit\r\n\"Teutonic blood\" with the revival never think of saddling it with the\r\nlater ruinous strifes of cities and parties, or with the vices of the\r\n\"Italian character.\" The rational explanation is, of course, that there\r\nwas now neither a sufficient preponderance of strength in any one State\r\nto admit of its unifying Italy by conquest, nor such a concurrence of\r\nconditions as could enable any State to become thus preponderant; while\r\non the other hand the Empire and the Church, each fighting for its own\r\nhand, were perpetual fountains of discord. The factions of Guelph\r\n(papal) and Ghibelline[542] (imperial) stereotyped and intensified for\r\ncenturies every proclivity to strife inherent in the Italian\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nAll the cities alike were at once industrial and military, with the\r\nexception of Rome; and for all alike a career of mere plunder was out of\r\nthe question, though every city sought to enlarge its territory.\r\nForcible unification could conceivably be wrought only by the emperor or\r\nthe Papacy; and in the nature of things these powers became enemies,\r\ncarrying feud into the heart of every city in Italy, as well as setting\r\neach on one or the other side according as the majority swayed for the\r\nmoment. At times, as after the destruction of Milan by Frederick\r\nBarbarossa, hatred of the foreigner and despot could unite a number of\r\ncities in a powerful league; but though the emperor was worsted there\r\nwas no excising the trouble of the separate interests of the bishops and\r\nthe nobles, or that of the old jealousies and hatreds of many of the\r\ncities for each other. Pope Innocent IV, after the death of Frederick II\r\nin 1250, turned against the Papacy many of the Milanese by his\r\narrogance. They had made immense sacrifices for the Guelph cause; and\r\ntheir reward was to be threatened with excommunication for an\r\necclesiastical dispute.[543] The Christian religion not only did not\r\navail to make Italians less madly quarrelsome than pagan Greeks: it\r\nembittered and complicated every difference; and if the cities could\r\nhave agreed to keep out the Germans, the Papacy would not have let them.\r\nCommonly it played them one against the other, preaching union only when\r\nthere was a question of a crusade.\r\n\r\n     Some writers, even non-Catholics, have spoken of the Papacy as a\r\n     unifying factor in Italian life. Machiavelli, who was pretty well\r\n     placed for knowing where the shoe pinched, repeatedly (_Istorie\r\n     fiorentine_, l. i; _Discorsi sopra Tito Livio_, i, 12) speaks of it\r\n     bitterly as being at all times the source of invasion and of\r\n     disunion in Italy. This is substantially the view of Gregorovius\r\n     (_Geschichte der Stadt Rom_, B. iv, cap. iii, Sec. 3) as to the\r\n     process in the city of Rome to begin with. So also Symonds: \"The\r\n     whole history of Italy proves that Machiavelli was right when he\r\n     asserted that the Church had persistently maintained the nation in\r\n     disunion for the furtherance of her own selfish ends\" (_Renaissance\r\n     in Italy: The Age of the Despots_, ed. 1907, p. 75).\r\n\r\nAs a civilising lore or social science the religion of professed love\r\nand fraternity, itself a theatre of divisions and discords,[544] counted\r\nliterally for less than nothing against the passions of ignorance,\r\negoism, and patriotism; for ignorant all orders of the people still\r\nwere--more ignorant than the Greeks of Athens--in the main matters of\r\npolitical knowledge and self-knowledge.[545] Yet such is the creative\r\npower of free intelligence even in a state of strife--given but the\r\nconditions of economic furtherance and variety of life and of\r\nculture-contact--that in this warring Italy of the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries there grew up a civilisation almost as manifold as\r\nthat of Hellas itself. The elements of variety, of culture, and of\r\ncompetition were present in nearly as potent a degree. In the north, in\r\nparticular, the Lombard, and Tuscan, and other cities differed widely in\r\ntheir industries. Florence, besides being one of the great centres of\r\nEuropean banking, was eminently the city of various occupations,\r\nmanufacturing and trading in woollens and silks and gold brocades,\r\nworking in gold and jewelry, the metals, and leather, and excelling in\r\ndyes. In 1266 the reformed constitution specified twelve _arti_ or\r\ncrafts, seven major and five minor, the latter list being later\r\nincreased to fourteen.[546] Pisa, beginning as a commercial seaport,\r\ntrading with the East, whither she exported the iron of Elba, became the\r\nfirst great seat of the woollen manufacture.[547] Milan, besides silks\r\nand woollens, manufactured in particular weapons and armour. Genoa had\r\nfactories of wool, cotton, silk, maroquin, leather, embroidery, and\r\nsilver and gold thread.[548] Bologna was in a special degree a culture\r\ncity, with its school of law, and as such would have its special minor\r\nindustries. But indeed every one of the countless Italian republics,\r\nwith its specialty of dialect, of life, and of outward aspect, must have\r\nhad something of its own to contribute to the complex whole.[549]\r\n\r\nIn the south the Norman kingdom set up in the eleventh century meant yet\r\nanother norm of life, for there Frederick II established the University\r\nof Naples; and Saracen contact told alike on thought and imagination.\r\nAll through these regions there now reigned something like a common\r\nspeech, the skeleton of old Latin newly suppled and newly clothed upon;\r\nand for all educated men the Latin itself was the instrument of thought\r\nand intercourse. For them, too, the Church and the twofold law\r\nconstituted a common ground of culture and discipline. On this composite\r\nsoil, under heats of passion and stresses of warring energies, there\r\ngradually grew the many-seeded flower of a new literature.\r\n\r\nGradual indeed was the process. Italy, under stress of struggle, was\r\nstill relatively backward at a time when Germany and France, and even\r\nEngland, under progressive conditions quickened with studious life;[550]\r\nand there was a great intellectual movement in France, in particular, in\r\nthe twelfth century, when Italy had nothing of the kind to show, save as\r\nregarded the important part played by the law school of Bologna in\r\neducating jurists for the whole of western Europe. For other\r\ndevelopments there still lacked the needed conditions, both political\r\nand social. The first economic furtherance given to mental life by the\r\ncities seems to have been the endowment of law schools and\r\nchronicle-writers; the schools of Ravenna and Bologna, and the first\r\nchronicles, dating from the eleventh century. Salerno had even earlier\r\nhad a medical school, long famous, which may or may not have been\r\nmunicipally endowed.[551] To the Church, as against her constant\r\ninfluence for discord and her early encouragement of illiteracy,[552]\r\nmust be credited a share in these beginnings. After the law school of\r\nBologna (whence in 1222 was founded that of Padua, by a secession of\r\nteachers and students at strife with the citizens) had added medicine\r\nand philology to its chairs, the Papacy gave it a faculty of theology;\r\nand in Rome itself the Church had established a school of law. The first\r\ngreat literary fruit of this intellectual ferment is the _Summa\r\nTheologiae_ of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-74), a performance in which the\r\nrevived study of Aristotle, set up by the stimulus of Saracen culture,\r\nis brought by a capacious and powerful mind to the insuperable task of\r\nphilosophising at once the Christian creed and the problems of\r\nChristendom. Close upon this, the Latin expression of accepted medieval\r\nthought, comes the great achievement of Dante, wherein a new genius for\r\nthe supreme art of rhythmic speech has preserved for ever the profound\r\nvibration of all the fierce and passionate Italian life of the Middle\r\nAges. In his own spirit he carries it all, save its vice and levity. Its\r\npitiless cruelty, its intellectuality, its curious observation, its\r\ningrained intolerance, its piercing flashes of tenderness, its capacity\r\nfor intense and mystic devotion, its absolute dogmatism in every field\r\nof thought, the whole pell-mell of its vehement experience, throbs\r\nthrough every canto of his welded strain. And no less does he incarnate\r\nfor ever its fatal incapacity for some political compromise. For Dante,\r\npolitics is first and last a question of the dominance of his faction:\r\nhis fellow-citizens are for him Guelphs or Ghibellines, and he shares\r\nthe Florentine rabies against rival or even neighbouring towns; his\r\nimperialism serving merely to extend the field of blind strife, never to\r\nsubject strife to the play of reason. Exiled for faction by the other\r\nfaction, he foreshadows the doom of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nWith Dante we are already in the fourteenth century, close upon Petrarch\r\nand Boccaccio; and already the whole course of political things is\r\ncurving back to tyranny, for lack of faculty in the cities, placed as\r\nthey were, to learn the lesson of politics. Their inhabitants could\r\nneither combine as federations to secure well-being for all of their own\r\nmembers, nor cease to combine as groups against each other. Always their\r\none principle of union remained negative--animal hatred of city to city,\r\nof faction to faction. It is important then to seek for a clear notion\r\nof the forces which fostered mental life and popular prosperity\r\nalongside of influences which wrought for demoralisation and\r\ndissolution. Taking progress to consist on one hand in increase and\r\ndiffusion of knowledge and art, and on the other in better distribution\r\nof wealth, we find that slavery, to begin with, was substantially\r\nextinguished in the time of conflict between cities, barons, and\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n     Already in the fifth century the process had begun in Gaul. Guizot\r\n     treats the change from slave to free labour as a mystery. \"Quand et\r\n     comment il s'opera au sein du monde romain, je ne le sais pas; et\r\n     personne, je crois, ne l'a decouvert; mais ... au commencement du\r\n     Ve siecle, ce pas etait fait; il y avait, dans toutes les grandes\r\n     villes de la Gaule, une classe assez nombreuse d'artisans libres;\r\n     deja meme ils etaient constitues en corporations.... La plupart des\r\n     corporations, dont on a continue d'attribuer l'origine au moyen\r\n     age, remontent, dans le midi de la Gaule surtout et en Italie, au\r\n     monde romain\" (_Civilisation en France_, i, 57). But a few pages\r\n     before (p. 51) we are told that at the _end_ of the _fourth_\r\n     century free men commenced in crowds to seek the protection of\r\n     powerful persons. On this we have the testimony of Salvian (_De\r\n     gubernatione Dei_, lib. v). The solution seems to be that the\r\n     \"freed\" class in the rural districts were the serfs of the glebe,\r\n     who, as we have seen, were rapidly substituted for slaves in Italy\r\n     in the last age of the Empire; and that in the towns in the same\r\n     way the crumbling upper class slackened its hold on its slaves.\r\n     Both in town and country such detached poor folk would in time of\r\n     trouble naturally seek the protection of powerful persons, thus\r\n     preparing the way for feudalism.\r\n\r\n     At the same time the barbarian conquerors maintained slavery as a\r\n     matter of course, so that in the transition period slaves were\r\n     perhaps more numerous than ever before (cp. Milman, _Hist. Lat.\r\n     Christ._ 4th ed. ii, 45-46; Lecky, _European Morals_, ed. 1884, ii,\r\n     70). Whatever were the case in the earlier ages of barbarian\r\n     irruption, it seems clear that during the Dark Ages the general\r\n     tendency was to reduce \"small men\" in general to a servile status,\r\n     whether they were of the conquering or the conquered stock. Cp.\r\n     Guizot, _Essais_, as cited, pp. 161-72; _Civilisation_, iii, 172,\r\n     190-203 (lecons 7, 8). The different grades of _coloni_ and _servi_\r\n     tended to approximate to the same subjection in Europe as in the\r\n     England of the twelfth century. But in France and Italy betterment\r\n     seems to have set in about the eleventh century; and the famous\r\n     ordinance of Louis the Fat in 1118 (given by Guizot, iii, 204)\r\n     tells of a general movement, largely traceable to the Crusades,\r\n     which in this connection wrought good for the tillers of the soil\r\n     in the process of squandering the wealth of their masters. Cp.\r\n     Duruy, _Hist. de France_, ed. 1880, i, 291.\r\n\r\nThe process of causation is still somewhat obscure, and is further\r\nbeclouded by _a priori_ views and prepossessions as to the part played\r\nby religion in the change. The fact that the Catholic Church everywhere,\r\nthough the last to free her own slaves,[553] encouraged penitents to\r\nfree theirs, is taken as a phenomenon of religion, though we have seen\r\nslavery of the worst description[554] flourishing within the past\r\ncentury in a devoutly Protestant community. Pope Urban II actually\r\nreduced to slavery the wives of priests who refused to submit to the law\r\nof celibacy, handing them over to the nobles or bishops.[555] The\r\nrational inference is that the motives in the medieval abandonment of\r\nslavery, as in its disuse towards the end of the Roman Empire, and as in\r\nits later re-establishments in Christian States, were economic--that (1)\r\nnobles on the one hand and burghers on the other found it to their\r\nadvantage to free their slaves for military purposes,[556] by way of\r\ngetting money; (2) that the Church in the Dark Ages actually had to\r\nenrol many serfs as priests, the desire of freemen to escape military\r\nservice by taking orders having made necessary a prohibitory law;[557]\r\nand (3) that the Church further promoted the process,[558] especially\r\nduring the crusading period, because a free laity was to her more\r\nprofitable than one of slaves--as apart from her own serfs. Freemen\r\ncould be made to pay clerical dues: slaves could not, save on a very\r\nsmall scale.\r\n\r\n     See Larroque, as cited, ch. ii. The claim of Guizot (_Essais_, p.\r\n     167; _Civ. en Europe_, lec. 6) that the religious character of most\r\n     of the formulas of enfranchisement proves them to have had a\r\n     specially Christian motive, is pure fallacy. Before Christianity\r\n     the process of manumission was a religious solemnity, being\r\n     commonly carried out in the pagan temples (cp. A. Calderini, _La\r\n     manomissione e la condizione dei liberti in Grecia_, 1908, p. 96\r\n     _sq._), and there were myriads of freedmen. It appears from Cicero\r\n     (_Philipp._ viii, 11, cited by Wallon, _Hist. de l'esclavage dans\r\n     l'antiquite_, ii, 419) that a well-behaved slave might expect his\r\n     liberty in six years. Among the acts of Constantine to establish\r\n     Christianity was the transference of this function of manumission\r\n     from the pagan temples to the churches. Thus Christianity took over\r\n     the process, like the idea of \"natural equality\" itself, from the\r\n     pagans.\r\n\r\nAnd the principle goes farther. In Adam Smith's not altogether coherent\r\ndiscussion of the general question,[559] the unprofitableness of slave\r\nlabour in comparison with free is urged, probably rightly, as counting\r\nfor much more than the alleged bull of Alexander III (12th century);\r\nwhile the interest of the sovereign as against the noble is noted as a\r\nfurther factor. As regards the \"love of domination\" to which Smith\r\nattributes the slowness of slave-owners to see the inferiority of slave\r\nlabour, it is to be remembered that the Roman slave-owner was fixed in\r\nhis bias by the perpetual influx of captives and cheap slaves from the\r\nEast; that this resource was lacking to the medieval Italians, who had\r\nto take the costly course of breeding most of their slaves; and that in\r\nsuch circumstances the concurrent pressure of all the other causes\r\nmentioned could very well suffice to make emancipation general.\r\n\r\nWhile the lowest stratum of the people was thus being raised, the state\r\nof war was for a time comparatively harmless by reason of the\r\nprimitiveness of the fighting. The cities were all alike walled, and\r\nincapable of capture in the then state of military technique;[560] so\r\nthey had periodical conflicts[561] which often came to nothing, and\r\ninvolved no heavy outlay; even the long struggle with Barbarossa was\r\nmuch less vitally costly to the cities than to Germany. Frederick's\r\neight variously devastating campaigns, ending in frustration, were the\r\nbeginning of the medieval demoralisation of Germany,[562] to which such\r\na policy meant retrogression in industry and agriculture; while the\r\nLombards, traders and cultivators first, and soldiers only secondarily,\r\nrapidly made good all their heavy losses.\r\n\r\nIt was when the practice of war grew more and more systematic under\r\nFrederick II, and the policy of cities became more and more capricious\r\nfor or against the Emperor, that their mutual animosities became more\r\ncommonly savage. Thus we read that in 1250 \"the Parmesans were\r\noverthrown by the Cremonese, losing 3,000 men. The captives were bound\r\nin the gravel-pit near the Taro ... the whole population seemed to have\r\nbeen captured. The Cremonese tortured them shamefully, drawing their\r\nteeth and ramming toads into their mouths. The exiles from Parma were\r\nmore cruel to their countrymen than the Cremonese were.\"[563] And,\r\nindeed, the Parmesans a century before had burned Borgo San Donnino and\r\nled away all its inhabitants as prisoners.[564] Now the Cremonese threw\r\ninto prison 1,575 of their Parmesan enemies; and when after a year the\r\ndungeons were thrown open, only 318 remained alive.[565] Thus\r\ncivilisation in effect went backwards on several lines at once, the\r\nspirit of internecine strife growing step by step with the economic\r\nprocess under which the community divided into rich and poor, as\r\nformerly into noble and plebeian.\r\n\r\nUp till the end of the thirteenth century, however, the growth of\r\ncapital went on slowly,[566] and the division between rich and poor was\r\nnot deep, the less so because thus far the middle and upper classes held\r\nby the sentiment of civic patriotism to the extent of being ready to\r\nspend freely for civic purposes, while they spent little on themselves\r\nas compared with the rich of a later period. So that, although the\r\nrepublics were from the first, in differing degrees, aristocratic rather\r\nthan democratic--the _popolo_ being the body of upper-class and\r\nmiddle-class citizens with the franchise, not the mass of the\r\npopulation--and though the workers had later to struggle for their\r\npolitical privileges very much as did the plebs of ancient Rome, the\r\neconomic conditions were for a considerable period healthy enough. A\r\nrapid expansion of upper-class wealth seems to have begun in the\r\nthirteenth century, in connection, apparently, with the new usury[567]\r\nand the new monopolist commerce connected with the Crusades; and it is\r\nfrom this time that the economic conditions so markedly alter as to\r\ninfect the political unity and independence of the republics without\r\nsubstituting any ideal of a wider union.\r\n\r\n     Much of the wealth of Florence must in early republican times have\r\n     been drawn from the agriculture of the surrounding plains, which\r\n     had a large population. Machiavelli (_Istorie fiorentine_, 1. ii)\r\n     states that when at the death of Frederick II the city reorganised\r\n     its military, there were formed twenty companies in the town and\r\n     sixty-six in the country. Cp. Hallam, _Middle Ages_, iii, 365.\r\n     Dante (_Paradiso_, xv, 97-129) pictures the Florentine upper class\r\n     as living frugally in the reign of Conrad III (d. 1152). Borghini\r\n     and Giovanni Villani decide that the same standards still prevailed\r\n     till the middle of the thirteenth century. (Cited by Villari, p.\r\n     200, and Testa, pp. 89-91: cp. Riccobaldi of Ferrara, there cited\r\n     from Muratori; Pignotti, _Hist. of Tuscany_, Eng. tr. iii, 293;\r\n     Trollope, _History of Florence_, i, 34; and Hallam, _Middle Ages_,\r\n     11th ed. iii, 342-44.) If these testimonies can be in any degree\r\n     trusted, the growth of wealth and luxury may be inferred to have\r\n     taken place in part through the money-lending system developed by\r\n     the Florentines in the period of the later Crusades, in part\r\n     through the great commercial developments.\r\n\r\n     The wool-trade, in which Florentines soon surpassed Pisa by reason\r\n     of their skill in dyeing, was a basis for capitalistic commerce,\r\n     inasmuch as the wool they dyed and manufactured was mostly foreign,\r\n     the Tuscan region being better suited for the growing of corn,\r\n     wine, and olives than for pasture. Already in 1202 the Florentine\r\n     wool trade had its consuls. (Villari puts these much earlier. He\r\n     traces them in 1182, and thinks they were then long established.\r\n     _Two First Centuries_, pp. 124, 313.) Woollen-weaving was first\r\n     noticeably improved by the lay order of the Umiliati at Milan about\r\n     1020; and this order was introduced about 1210 into Florence, where\r\n     it received special privileges. Thenceforward the city became the\r\n     great emporium for the finer cloths till the Flemings and English\r\n     learned to compete. (Pignotti, _Hist. of Tuscany_, as cited, iii,\r\n     265-70.)\r\n\r\n     The silk manufacture, brought into Sicily from the islands of the\r\n     Archipelago by Roger II in 1147, and carried north from Sicily in\r\n     the reign of Frederick III, seems to have existed in Florence at\r\n     the beginning of the thirteenth century, but to have flourished at\r\n     first on a larger scale at Lucca, whence, on the sack of the town\r\n     by Uguccioni della Faggiola in 1315, most of the Lucchese\r\n     manufacturers fled to Florence, taking their trade with them.\r\n     (Pignotti, iii, 273-74; Villari, _Two First Centuries_, p. 323.)\r\n     Many had fled to Venice from the power of Castruccio Castracani,\r\n     five years earlier. (Below, p. 243.) Being much more profitable\r\n     than any other, by reason of the high prices, it seems to have\r\n     speedily ranked as more aristocratic than the wool trade; and when\r\n     that declined, the silk trade restored Florentine prosperity.\r\n     (Villari, as cited.)\r\n\r\n     The business of banking, again, must have been much developed\r\n     before the Bardi and the Peruzzi could lend 1,500,000 florins to\r\n     Edward III of England (G. Villani, xi, 88; xii, 54, 56; Gibbins,\r\n     _History of Commerce_, 1891, pp. 47, 48; Hallam, _Middle Ages_,\r\n     iii, 340. Pignotti, iii, 279, Eng. tr., estimates the sum lent as =\r\n     L3,000,000 of modern money). This function, in turn, arose on the\r\n     basis of commerce, and the _cambisti_ are subjects of legal\r\n     regulation in Florence as early as 1299. (Pignotti, iii, 276.) On\r\n     this line capitalism must have been developed greatly, till it\r\n     became the preponderant power in the State. Even as the kings and\r\n     tyrants were enabled, by borrowing from the bankers, to wage wars\r\n     which otherwise might have been impossible to them, the republican\r\n     statesman who could command the moneyed interest was destined to\r\n     supersede the merely military tyrant. In Genoa the bankers\r\n     coalesced in a corporation called the Bank of St. George, which\r\n     controlled politics, traded, and even made conquests, thus giving a\r\n     historic lead to the Bank of Amsterdam. (Cp. Hallam, _Middle\r\n     Ages_, iii, 341; J.T. Bent, _Genoa_, 1881, ch. ii.)\r\n\r\n     Summing up the industrial evolution, we note that about 1340 there\r\n     were 200 cloth factories in Florence; and a century later 272, of\r\n     which 83 made silk and cloth-of-gold. At the latter period there\r\n     were 72 bankers or money-changers, 66 apothecary shops, 30\r\n     goldbeaters, and 44 of goldsmiths, silversmiths, and jewellers. The\r\n     artisan population was estimated at 30,000; and gold currency at\r\n     two millions of florins (Pignotti, iii, 290-91). Concerning Milan,\r\n     it is recorded that in 1288, a generation after it had lost its\r\n     liberties, it had a population of 200,000 (certainly an\r\n     exaggeration), 13,000 houses, 600 notaries, 200 physicians, 80\r\n     schoolmasters, and 50 copyists of MSS. (Hallam, _Middle Ages_, i,\r\n     393, citing Galvaneus Flamma; cp. Ranke, _Latin and Teutonic\r\n     Nations_, Eng. tr. p. 111.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nWe can now generalise, then, the conditions of the rise of the arts and\r\nsciences in medieval Italy. First we have seen commerce, handicraft, and\r\narchitecture flourish in the new free cities, as they did at the same\r\ntime in Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. In the south, again, in the Two\r\nSicilies, under the reign of Frederick II, prosperous industry and\r\ncommerce, in contact and rivalry with those of the Saracens, supplied a\r\nsimilar basis, though without yielding such remarkable fruits. There,\r\nhowever, on the stimulus of Saracen literature, occur the decided\r\nbeginnings of a new literature, in a speech at once vernacular and\r\ncourtly, as being accepted by the emperor and the aristocracy. The same\r\nconditions, indeed, had existed before Frederick, under the later Norman\r\nkings; and it is in Sicily about 1190 that we must date the oldest known\r\nverses in an Italian dialect.[568] Some of them refer to Saladin; and\r\nthe connection between Italian and Arab literature goes deeper than that\r\ndetail; for there is reason to suppose that in Europe the very use of\r\nrhyme, arising as it thus did in the sphere of Saracen culture-contact,\r\nderives from Saracen models.[569] In any case, the Moorish poetry\r\ncertainly influenced the beginnings of the Italian and Spanish. About\r\nthe same time, however, there occurs the important literary influence of\r\nthe troubadours, radiating from Provence, where, again, the special\r\nsource of fertilisation was the culture of the Moors.[570] The Provencal\r\nspeech, developed in a more stable life,[571] took literary form before\r\nthe Italian, and yielded a literature which was the most effective\r\nstimulus to that of Italy. And, broadly speaking, the troubadours stood\r\nsocially for either the leisured upper class or a class which\r\nentertained and was supported by it.\r\n\r\nHere, then, as regards imaginative and artistic literature, we find the\r\nbeginnings made in the sphere of the beneficent prince or \"tyrant.\" But,\r\nexactly as in Greece, it is only in the struggling and stimulating life\r\nof the free cities that there arises, after the period of primary song,\r\nthe great reflective literature, the great art: and, furthermore, the\r\npursuit of letters at the courts of the princes is itself a result of\r\noutside stimulus. It needed the ferment of Moorish culture--itself\r\npromoted by the special tolerance of the earlier Ommiades towards Jews\r\nand Christians--to produce the literary stir in Sicily and Provence.\r\nAgain, while the Provencal life, like the Moorish, included a remarkable\r\ndevelopment of free thought, the first great propagation of\r\nquasi-rational heresy in the south occurring in Provence, it was in the\r\nfree Italian cities, where also many _Cathari_ and _Paterini_ were found\r\nfor burning, that there arose the more general development of\r\nintelligence. That is to say, the intellectual climate, the mental\r\natmosphere, in which great literature grows, is here as elsewhere found\r\nto be supplied by the \"free\" State, in which men's wills and ideas clash\r\nand compromise.[572] In turbulent Florence of the thirteenth century was\r\nnourished the spirit of Dante. And it is with art as with literature.\r\nModern painting begins in the thirteenth century in Florence with\r\nCimabue, and at Siena with Duccio, who, trained like previous Italian\r\npainters of other towns in the Byzantine manner, transcended it and led\r\nthe Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe great step once taken, the new speech once broadly fixed, and the\r\nnew art-ideal once adumbrated by masters, both literature and art could\r\nin differing sort flourish under the regimen of more or less propitious\r\nprinces; but not so as to alter the truth just stated. What could best\r\nof all thrive was art. Architecture, indeed, save for one or two great\r\nundertakings, can hardly be said to have ever outgone the achievement of\r\nthe republican period; and painting was first broadly developed by\r\npublic patronage; but it lay in the nature of the case that painting\r\ncould find ample economic furtherance under the princes and under the\r\nChurch. For the rule of the princes was not, save in one or two places\r\nat a time, a tyranny of the kind that destroys all individuality; the\r\ninvention of printing, and the general use of Latin, now maintained a\r\nconstant interaction of thought throughout all Europe, checked only by\r\nthe throttling hand of the Church; and the arts of form and colour, once\r\nwell grown, are those which least closely depend on, though they also\r\nthrive by, a free all-round intellectual life. The efficient cause of\r\nthe great florescence of Italian art from the thirteenth to the\r\nsixteenth century was economic--the unparalleled _demand_ for art on the\r\npart alike of the cities, the Church, the princes, and the rich. From\r\nthe tenth to the thirteenth century the outstanding economic phenomenon\r\nin Italy is the growth of wealth by industry and commerce. In the same\r\nperiod, Italian agriculture so flourished that by the fifteenth century\r\nItaly would on this ground alone have ranked as the richest of European\r\ncountries.[573] From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century the\r\noutstanding economic fact is the addition to this still increasing\r\nwealth of the foreign revenues of the Church.[574]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century all three sources of wealth are almost\r\nsimultaneously checked--that from agriculture through the miserable\r\ndevastation wrought by the wars[575] and by the Spanish and papal rule;\r\nand then it is that the great art period begins to draw to its close.\r\nWhile the revenue of the Church from the northern countries was sharply\r\ncurtailed by the Reformation, which in rapid succession affected\r\nGermany, France, Holland, Switzerland, England, Scotland, and the\r\nScandinavian States, the trade of Italy began to be affected through the\r\ndevelopment of the new sea route round the Cape of Good Hope by the\r\nPortuguese; and though that gradual change need not have brought\r\ndepression speedily, the misrule of Leo X, raised to an unprecedented\r\nsecular power, and the crowning blow of the Spanish Conquest, following\r\nupon the other and involving government by Spanish methods, were the\r\nbeginning of the end of Italian greatness.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Thorold Rogers repeatedly generalises (_Six Centuries of\r\n     Work and Wages_, p. 157; _Holland_, p. 49; _Economic Interpretation\r\n     of History_, p. 11) that the Turkish conquest of Egypt (1517)\r\n     blocked the only remaining road to the East known to the Old World;\r\n     and that thenceforth the trade of the Rhine and Danube was so\r\n     impoverished as to ruin the German nobles, who speedily took to\r\n     oppressing their tenants, and so brought about the Peasants' War,\r\n     while \"the Italian cities fell into rapid decay.\" Whatever be the\r\n     truth as to Germany, the statement as to Italy is very doubtful.\r\n     The Professor confessedly came to these conclusions from having\r\n     observed a \"sudden and enormous rise in the prices of all Eastern\r\n     products\" at the close of the first quarter of the sixteenth\r\n     century, not from having ascertained first the decay of the Italian\r\n     cities. Now, H. Scherer expressly notes (_Allgemeine Geschichte des\r\n     Welthandels_, 1852, i, 336), that Selim I, after conquering Egypt,\r\n     made terms with his old enemies the Venetians (who were then the\r\n     main Eastern traders in Italy) and \"bestowed on them all the\r\n     privileges they had under the Mamelukes.\" Prof. Rogers states that\r\n     \"the thriving manufactures of Alexandria were at once destroyed.\"\r\n     Scherer states that Selim freed from imposts all the Indian wares\r\n     brought into his States through Alexandria, while he burdened\r\n     heavily all that came by way of Lisbon. Heyd sums up (_Histoire du\r\n     commerce du Levant_, ed. fran. 1886, ii, 546), that \"under the new\r\n     regime as under the old, Egypt and Syria remained open to the\r\n     Venetian merchants.\" It is hard to reconcile these data with the\r\n     assertions of Prof. Rogers; and his statement as to prices is\r\n     further indecisive because the Portuguese trade by sea should have\r\n     availed to counteract the effect of the closing of the Egyptian\r\n     route, if that _were_ closed. But the subject remains obscure:\r\n     Prof. Gibbins (_History of Commerce in Europe_, 1891, pp. 56, 57)\r\n     follows Rogers without criticism. The difficulty is that, as\r\n     Scherer complains (i, 272), we have very few records as to Italian\r\n     trade. \"They have illustrated nearly everything, but least of all\r\n     their commerce and their commercial politics.\" The lack of\r\n     information Scherer sets down to the internecine jealousy of the\r\n     cities. But see the list of works of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\n     centuries given by Heyd, i, p. xvii _sq._, and his narrative,\r\n     _passim_.\r\n\r\nSo superficially has history been written that it is difficult to gather\r\nthe effect thus far of the change in the channels of trade; but there\r\nseems to be no obscurity as to the effect of papal and Spanish rule.\r\nWhat the arrest of trade began, and the rule of Leo X promoted, the\r\ndesperate wars of France and Spain for the possession of Italy\r\ncompleted, and the misgovernment of the Spanish crown from 1530 onwards\r\nperpetuated. Under sane rule peace might have brought recuperation; but\r\nSpanish rule was ruin prolonged. Destructive taxation, and still more\r\ndestructive monopolies, paralysed commerce in the cities under Spanish\r\nsway; while the executive was so weak for good that brigandage abounded\r\nin the interior, and the coasts were raided periodically by the fleets\r\nof the Turks or the Algerine pirates. The decline of the art of painting\r\nin Italy (apart from Venice and Rome) being broadly coincident with this\r\ncollapse, the induction is pretty clear that the economic demand had\r\nbeen the fundamental force in the artistic development. The Church and\r\nthe despot remained, but the artistic growth ceased.\r\n\r\n     Always in need of money for his vast outlays, Leo administered his\r\n     secular power solely with a view to his own immediate revenue, and\r\n     set up trade monopolies in Florence and the papal estates wherever\r\n     he could. As to the usual effects of the papal power on commerce,\r\n     see Napier, _Florentine History_, 1845, ii, 413. \"The Court of\r\n     Rome, since it had ceased to respect the ancient municipal\r\n     liberties, never extended its authority over a new province without\r\n     ruining its population and resources\" (Sismondi, _Short History_,\r\n     p. 319). Roscoe (_Life of Leo X_, ed. 1846, ii, 207) speaks of a\r\n     revival of Florentine commerce under Leo's kinsman, the Cardinal,\r\n     about 1520; but this is almost the only glance at the subject of\r\n     trade and administration in Roscoe's work.\r\n\r\n     Under Pope Gregory XIII (1572-84) there was for a time fair\r\n     prosperity in States that had formerly suffered from more\r\n     precarious tyrannies; but ere long \"the taxes laid upon persons,\r\n     property, and commerce, to replace the lost revenues of\r\n     Christendom, dried up these resources\"; and many cities fell into\r\n     poverty. Ancona in particular was so crushed by a tax on imports\r\n     that her Mediterranean trade was lost once for all. (Zeller,\r\n     _Histoire d'Italie_, 1853, p. 406.) Sismondi's charge is\r\n     substantially borne out also by Ranke's account (_History of the\r\n     Popes_, Eng. trans. 1-vol. ed. 1859, pp. 118-19) of the ruinous\r\n     impositions of Pope Sixtus V (1585-90), who taxed the poorest\r\n     trades and the necessaries of life, besides debasing the coinage\r\n     and raising further revenue from the sale of places at exorbitant\r\n     prices, leaving the holders to recoup themselves by extortion and\r\n     corruption. Cp., however, Zeller, pp. 409-10, as to his municipal\r\n     improvements.\r\n\r\n     As to Spanish misrule, see Cantu, _Storia degli Italiani_, cap.\r\n     139, ed. pop. ix, 512; Sismondi, _Republiques_, xvi, 71-76, 158-59,\r\n     170, 217; Symonds, _Renaissance_, vol. vi, pt. i (Catholic\r\n     Reaction), pp. 52, 65; Procter, _History of Italy_, 1844, pp. 218,\r\n     219, following Muratori and Giannone; Spalding, _Italy_, ii,\r\n     264-72, citing many other sources. \"The Spaniards, as a Milanese\r\n     writer indignantly remarks, possessed Central Lombardy for 172\r\n     years. They found in its chief city 300,000 souls; they left in it\r\n     scarcely a third of that number. They found in it seventy-five\r\n     woollen manufactories; they left in it no more than five\"\r\n     (Spalding, ii, 272). Agriculture suffered equally. The decay of\r\n     manufactures might be set down to outside causes, not so the rise\r\n     in taxation.\r\n\r\n     Yet the decadence does not seem to have been universal, or at least\r\n     was not continuous. In Sicily, it is alleged, though the statement\r\n     is hardly credible, the revenue, which in 1558 was 1,770,000\r\n     ducats, was in 1620 5,000,000 (Leo, _Geschichte von Italien_, v,\r\n     506, 507); and at the latter date, according to Howell, Naples\r\n     abounded \"in rich staple commodities, as silks, cottons, and\r\n     wines,\" from which there accrued to the King of Spain \"a mighty\r\n     revenue,\" which, however, was mostly spent in the province, being\r\n     \"eaten up 'twixt governors, garrisons, and officers\" (Letter of\r\n     October, 1621, in _Epistolae Ho-elianae_, Bennett's ed. 1891, i,\r\n     130). Thus there would seem to have been marked fluctuations, for\r\n     in the time of Pope Gregory Naples is described as sinking under\r\n     oppression and Milan as prosperous (Zeller, p. 407). The inference\r\n     seems to be that some governors learned from the failures of their\r\n     predecessors to handle trade aright.\r\n\r\n     The case of Florence after 1587, finally, shows how a wise ruler\r\n     could so profit by experience as to restore prosperity where\r\n     misrule had driven it out. Duke Ferdinand (1587-1609) was\r\n     technically as much a \"tyrant\" as his brother and predecessor\r\n     Francis, but by wise public works he restored prosperity to Leghorn\r\n     and to Pisa, whose population had latterly fallen from 22,000 to\r\n     8,000 (Zeller, pp. 406, 411), and so increased both population and\r\n     revenue that he even set up a considerable naval power. The net\r\n     result was that at 1620, even under less sagacious successors,\r\n     Florence \"marvellously flourished with buildings, with wealth, and\r\n     with artisans\"; and the people of all degrees were declared to live\r\n     \"not only well but splendidly well, notwithstanding the manifold\r\n     exactions of the Duke upon all things\" (Howell's Letter of\r\n     November, 1621, ed. cited, i, 136).\r\n\r\nWe are in sight, then, of the solution of the dispute as to whether it\r\nwas the republics or the \"tyrants\" that evoked the arts and literature\r\nin medieval and Renaissance Italy. The true generalisation embraces both\r\nsides. It may be well, however, to meet in full the \"protectionist\" or\r\n\"monarchist\" view, as it has been very judiciously put by an\r\naccomplished specialist in Italian culture history, in criticism of the\r\nother theory:--\r\n\r\n     \"The obliteration of the parties beneath despotism was needed,\r\n     under actual conditions, for that development of arts and industry\r\n     which raised Italy to a first place among civilised nations. We are\r\n     not justified by the facts in assuming that, had the free burghs\r\n     continued independent, arts and literature would have risen to a\r\n     greater height. Venice, in spite of an uninterrupted republican\r\n     career, produced no commanding men of letters, and owed much of her\r\n     splendour in the art of painting to aliens from Cadore,\r\n     Castle-franco, and Verona. Genoa remained silent and irresponsive\r\n     to the artistic movement of Italy to the last days of the Republic,\r\n     when her independence was but a shadow. Pisa, though a burgh of\r\n     Tuscany, displayed no literary talent, while her architecture dates\r\n     from the first period of the Commune. Siena, whose republican\r\n     existence lasted longer even than that of Florence, contributed\r\n     nothing of importance to Italian literature. The art of Perugia was\r\n     developed during the ascendency of despotic families. The painting\r\n     of the Milanese school owes its origin to Lodovico Sforza, and\r\n     survived the tragic catastrophes of his capital, which suffered\r\n     more than any other from the brutalities of Spaniards and\r\n     Frenchmen. Next to Florence, the most brilliant centres of literary\r\n     activity during the bright days of the Renaissance were princely\r\n     Ferrara and royal Naples. Lastly, we might insist upon the fact\r\n     that the Italian language took its first flight in the court of\r\n     imperial Palermo, while republican Rome remained dumb throughout\r\n     the earlier stage of Italian literary evolution. Thus the facts of\r\n     the case seem to show that culture and republican independence were\r\n     not so closely united in Italy as some historians would seek to\r\n     make us believe.\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand, it is impossible to prove that the despotisms\r\n     of the fifteenth century were necessary to the perfecting of art\r\n     and literature. All that can be safely advanced upon this subject\r\n     is that the pacification of Italy was demanded as a preliminary\r\n     condition, and that this pacification came to pass through the\r\n     action of the princes, checked and equilibrated by the oligarchies\r\n     of Venice and Florence. It might further be urged that the despots\r\n     were in close sympathy with the masses of the people, shared their\r\n     enthusiasms, and promoted their industry.... To be a prince and not\r\n     to be the patron of scholarship, the pupil of the humanists, and\r\n     the founder of libraries, was an impossibility. In like manner they\r\n     employed their wealth upon the development of arts and industries.\r\n     The great age of Florentine painting is indissolubly connected with\r\n     the memories of Casa Medici. Rome owes her magnificence to the\r\n     despotic popes. Even the pottery of Gubbio was the creation of the\r\n     ducal house of Urbino.\"[576]\r\n\r\nThe criticism of this well-marshalled passage may best be put in a\r\nsummary form, as thus:--\r\n\r\nI. (_a_) The despot promoter of arts and letters is here admittedly the\r\npupil and product of a previous culture. That being so, he could avail\r\nfor fresh culture in so far as he gave it economic furtherance. He might\r\neven give such furtherance on some sides in a fuller degree than ever\r\ndid the Republics. But he could _not_ give (though after the invention\r\nof printing he could not wholly destroy) the mental atmosphere needed to\r\nproduce great literature. None of the above-cited illustrations goes any\r\nway to prove that he could; and it is easy to show that his influence\r\nwas commonly belittling to those who depended on him.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The point as to pacification is unduly pressed, or is perhaps\r\naccidentally misstated. It is not to be denied that the despot in the\r\nItalian cities, as in old Greece and Rome, did in a measure earn popular\r\nsupport by giving the common people relief from the strifes of Guelphs\r\nand Ghibellines. But the despots did not pacify Italy, though they to\r\nsome extent set up local stability by checking faction feuds.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The popes were in the earlier Middle Ages a main cause of the\r\nill-development of Rome. Their splendid works were much later than many\r\nof those of the Republics. St. Mark's at Venice, a result of Byzantine\r\ncontact, was built in the eleventh century, as was the duomo of Pisa,\r\nwhose baptistery and tower belong to the twelfth. The Campo Santa of\r\nPisa, again, belongs to the thirteenth and fourteenth, and the Palazzo\r\nVecchio of Florence to the end of the thirteenth. And the great\r\narchitects and sculptors of the thirteenth century were mostly\r\nPisans.[577]\r\n\r\nII. The point as to the lack of the right intellectual atmosphere under\r\nthe princes can be proved by a comparison of products. The literature\r\nthat is intellectually great, in the days before printing equalised and\r\ndistributed cultures, belongs from first to last to Florence. Dante and\r\nMachiavelli are its terms; both standing for the experience of affairs\r\nin a disturbed but self-governing community; and it was in Florence that\r\nBoccaccio formed his powers. \"Florentine art and letters, constituting\r\nthe most fertile seeds of art and letters in Italy, were essentially\r\nrepublican; many writers, and most of the artists, of Florence were the\r\noffspring of traders or labouring men.\"[578] What the popes and the\r\nprinces protected and developed was the literature of scholarship, their\r\ndonations constituting an endowment of research. If the revival of\r\nclassic learning and the rapid growth of art after the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century be held, as by some historians, to be the essence of\r\nthe Renaissance,[579] then the Renaissance is largely the work of the\r\ndespots. But even the artists and scholars patronised by Cosimo de'\r\nMedici were formed before his time,[580] and there is no proportional\r\nincrease in number or achievement afterwards. On the other hand, it was\r\n_mere_ scholarship that the potentates fostered: Lorenzo Valla, welcomed\r\nfor his _Elegantiae latinae linguae_, had barely escaped exile for his\r\n_De falsa donatione Constantini Magni_;[581] and it is impossible to\r\nshow that they promoted thought save in such a case as the encouragement\r\nof the Platonic philosophy by Cosimo and Lorenzo. For the rest, the\r\ncharacter of the humanists whom the potentates fostered is admittedly\r\nillaudable in nearly every case. Pomponius Laetus, who almost alone of\r\nhis class bears scrutiny as a personality, expressly set his face\r\nagainst patronage, and sought to live as a free professor in the\r\nUniversity of Rome.[582] And it is open to argument, finally, whether\r\nthe princely patronage of the merely retrospective humanists did not\r\ncheck vital culture in Italy.[583] It is true that when \"despotism\" has\r\nbeen so long acquiesced in as to mean a stable social state, there may\r\ntake place under it new forms of intellectual life. The later cases of\r\nGalileo and Vico would suffice to prove as much. But it will hardly be\r\nsuggested that monarchic rule _evoked_ such forms of genius, any more\r\nthan that the papacy was propitious to Galileo. In both cases the\r\neffective stimulant was foreign thought.\r\n\r\nIII. (_a_) The case of Venice has to be explained in respect of its\r\nspecial conditions. Venice was from the first partly aloof from ordinary\r\nItalian life by reason of its situation and its long Byzantine\r\nconnections. It was further an aristocratic republic of the old Roman\r\ntype, its patrician class developing as a caste of commanders and\r\nadministrators; and its foreign possessions, added to in every century,\r\nreinforced this tendency.[584] The early usage of civic trading, carried\r\non by means of fleets owned by the State, was habitually turned to the\r\ngain of the ruling minority. The use of the fleets was generally granted\r\nto monopoly companies, who paid no duties, while private persons did;\r\nthe middle classes in general being allowed to trade only under\r\nburdensome restrictions.[585] Here were conditions contrary in effect to\r\nthose of the progressive days of Greece. Contrasted with Florence, the\r\nItalian Athens, Venice has even been likened to Sparta by a modern\r\nItalian.[586] It has been more justly compared, however,[587] with\r\nRhodes, which, unlike Sparta, was primarily a commercial and a maritime\r\npower; and where, as in Venice, the rich merchants patronised the arts\r\nrather than letters. From the first Venice achieved its wealth by an\r\nenergetically prosecuted trade, with no basis of landed property to set\r\nup a leisured class. In such a city the necessarily high standards of\r\nliving,[588] as well as the prevailing habit and tradition, would keep\r\nmen of the middle class away from literature;[589] and only men of the\r\nmiddle class like Dante, or leisured officials like Poggio and Boccaccio\r\nand Machiavelli, are found to do important literary work even in\r\nFlorence. Hence the small share of Venice in the structure of Italian\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe same explanation partly holds good of art. Venice, however, at\r\nlength gave the needed economic furtherance; and men of other\r\ncommunities could there find a market, as did Greek sculptors in\r\nimperial Rome. Obviously a despot could not have evoked artists of\r\nVenetian birth any more than did the Republic, save by driving men out\r\nof commerce. But it is in Venice, where wealth and the republican form\r\nlasted longest, that we find almost the last of the great\r\nartists--Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese. After these the Caracci, Guido,\r\nand many others gravitate to Rome, where the reorganised Church regains\r\nsome riches with power. We are to remember, too, that the aristocratic\r\nrulers saw to the food supply of the whole Republic by a special\r\npromotion of agriculture in its possessions, particularly in Candia;\r\nbesides carefully making treaties which secured its access to the grain\r\nmarkets of Sicily, Egypt, and North Africa.[590] Here again we have to\r\nrecognise a form of civic self-preserving resource special in origin to\r\nrepublics, though afterwards exploited by autocracies, as earlier in the\r\ncase of imperial Rome.\r\n\r\n     The fact that Venice _did_ maintain great artists after the\r\n     artistic arrest of Tuscany and Lombardy, is part of the proof that,\r\n     as above contended (p. 221), it was papal and Spanish misrule\r\n     rather than the change in the channels of trade that impoverished\r\n     Italy in the sixteenth century. Venice could still prosper by her\r\n     manufactures when her commerce was partly checked, because the\r\n     volume of European trade went on increasing. As Hallam notes: \"We\r\n     are apt to fall into a vulgar error in supposing that Venice was\r\n     crushed, or even materially affected [phrase slightly modified in\r\n     footnote], as a commercial city, by the discoveries of the\r\n     Portuguese. She was in fact _more opulent_, as her buildings\r\n     themselves may prove, in the sixteenth century than in any\r\n     preceding age. The French trade from Marseilles to the Levant,\r\n     which began later to flourish, was what impoverished Venice rather\r\n     than that of Portugal with the East Indies.\" As the treatise of\r\n     Antonio Serra shows (1613), Venice was rich when Spanish Naples was\r\n     poor (_Introduction to the Literature of Europe_, ed. 1872, iii,\r\n     165, 166).\r\n\r\n(_b_) As regards Genoa, the explanation is similar. That republic\r\nresembled Venice in that it was from the beginning a city apart from the\r\nrest of Italy, devoted to foreign commerce, and absorbed in the\r\nmanagement of distant possessions or trade colonies. When we compare the\r\nintellectual history of two such States with that of Florence, which was\r\nnot less but more republican in its government, it becomes clear that it\r\nwas not republicanism that limited culture in the maritime cities.\r\nRather we must recognise that their development is analogous with that\r\nof England in the eighteenth century, when the growth of commerce, of\r\nforeign possessions, and of naval power seems to have turned the general\r\nenergies, hitherto in large proportion intellectually employed,\r\npredominantly towards practical and administrative employment.[591] The\r\ncase of Florence is the test for the whole problem. Its pre-eminence in\r\nart and letters alike is to be explained through (1) its being in\r\nconstant touch with all the elements of Italian and other European\r\nculture; and (2) its having no direct maritime interests and no foreign\r\npossessions.[592]\r\n\r\nIV. With the patronage of the princes of Ferrara, history associates\r\nthe poetry of Ariosto and Tasso, though as a matter of fact the _Orlando\r\nFurioso_ seems to have been written before Ariosto entered the ducal\r\nservice. But even if that and the _Gerusalemme_ be wholly credited to\r\nthe principle of monarchism, it only needs to weigh the two works\r\nagainst those which were brought forth in the atmosphere of the free\r\ncities in order to see how little mere princely pay can avail for power\r\nand originality in literature where the princely rule thwarts the great\r\ninstincts of personality. Ariosto and Tasso are charming melodists; and\r\nas such they have had an influence on European literature; but they have\r\nwaned in distinction age by age, while earlier and later names have\r\nwaxed. And all the while, what is delightful in them is clearly enough\r\nthe outcome of the still manifold Italian culture in which they grew,\r\nthough it may be that the influence of a court would do more to foster\r\nsheer melody than would the storm and stress of the life of a Republic.\r\n\r\n     Sismondi (_Republiques italiennes_, iv, 416-18), admits the\r\n     encouragement given to men of letters by despots like Can' Grande,\r\n     and the frequent presence of poets at the courts. But he rightly\r\n     insists that the faculty of imagination itself visibly dwindled\r\n     when intellectual freedom was gone. It is interesting to note how\r\n     Montaigne, writing within a century of the production of the\r\n     _Orlando Furioso_, is struck by its want of sustained imaginative\r\n     flight in comparison with Virgil (_Essais_, B. ii, 10; ed.\r\n     Firmin-Didot, vol. i, p. 432). Compare the estimate of Cantu,\r\n     _Storia degli Italiani_, cap. 142, ed. pop. x, 180-86.\r\n\r\nIn fine, we can rightly say with Mr. Symonds himself that the history of\r\nthe Renaissance is not the history of arts, or of sciences, or even of\r\nnations. It is the history of the attainment of self-conscious freedom\r\nby the human spirit manifested in the European races.[593] And _this_\r\nprocess, surely, was not accomplished at the courts of the despots. Nor\r\ncan it well be disputed, finally, that the Spanish domination was the\r\nvisible and final check to intellectual progress on the side of\r\nimaginative literature, at a time when there was every prospect of a\r\ngreat development of Italian drama. \"It was the Inquisitors and\r\nSpaniards who cowed the Italian spirit.\"[594]\r\n\r\nEqually clear is it that the republican life evolved an amount of\r\nexpansive commercial energy which at that period could not possibly have\r\ntaken place under a tyrant. The efforts by which Florence developed her\r\ntrade and power--efforts made possible by the mere union of\r\nself-interest among the commercial class--will compare with any process\r\nof monarchic imperialism in respect of mere persistency and success.\r\nFaced by the jealous enmity of Pisa, their natural port, and suffering\r\nfrom the trade burdens laid on them by the maritime States while they\r\nlacked a marine, the Florentines actually opened up trade communication\r\nwith China when shut out from Egypt by the Venetians; traded through the\r\nport of Talamone when the Pisans barred their traffic; took Provencal\r\nand Neapolitan galleys in their pay when the Pisans and Genoese tried to\r\nclose Talamone; and, after becoming masters of Pisa in 1406, not only\r\nestablished a well-ordered marine, but induced Genoa to sell to them the\r\nport of Leghorn. They could not, indeed, successfully compete with the\r\nGenoese and Venetians till the fall of the Greek Empire; but thereafter\r\nthey contrived to obtain abundant concessions from the Turks, while the\r\nGenoese were driven out of the Levant. Commercial egoism, in fact,\r\nenabled them to tread the path of \"empire\" even as emperors had done\r\nlong before them; and they hastened to the stage of political collapse\r\non the old military road, spending on one war of two years, against\r\nVisconti, a sum equal to L15,000,000 at the present time; and in the\r\ntwenty-nine years of struggle against Pisa (1377-1406) a sum equal to\r\nL58,000,000.[595] Thus they developed a capitalistic class, undermined\r\nin the old way the spirit of equity which is the cement of societies,\r\nand prepared their own subjection to a capitalist over-lord. But that is\r\nonly another way of saying that the period of expansive energy preceded\r\nthe age of the tyrant, wise or unwise.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, however, there can be no gainsaying of the judgment\r\nthat the strifes of the republics were the frustration of their culture;\r\nand it matters little whether or not we set down the inveteracy of the\r\nstrifes to the final scantiness and ill-distribution of the culture.\r\nNeither republics nor princes seem ever to have aimed at its diffusion.\r\nThe latter, in common with the richer ecclesiastics, did undoubtedly\r\npromote the recovery of the literature of antiquity; but where the\r\nrepublics had failed to see any need for systematic popular tuition[596]\r\nthe princes naturally did not dream of it. It would be a fallacy,\r\nhowever, to suppose that, given the then state of knowledge and of\r\npolitical forces, any system of public schooling could have saved\r\nItalian liberty. No class had the science that could solve the problem\r\nwhich pressed on all. The increase and culmination of social and\r\npolitical evil in Renaissance Italy was an outcome of more forces than\r\ncould be checked by any expedient known to the thought of the time. It\r\nmust never be forgotten that the very dividedness of the cities, by\r\nmaximising energy, had been visibly a cause of their growth in\r\nriches;[597] and that, though peace could have fostered that when once\r\nit had been attained, anything like a federation which should secure to\r\nthe satisfaction of each their conflicting commercial interests was an\r\nenormously difficult conception. It would be a bad fallacy, again, to\r\nsuppose that there was lacking to the Italians of the Renaissance a kind\r\nof insight or judgment found in other peoples of the same period. There\r\nis no trace of any such estimate in that age; and we who look back upon\r\nit are rather set marvelling at the intense and luminous play of Italian\r\nintelligence, keen as that of Redskins on the trail, so far as the\r\nrealisation of the self-expressive and self-assertive appetites could\r\ngo. The tragedy of the decadence, here as in the case of Rome, is\r\nmeasured by the play of power from which men and States fall away; for\r\nthe forces which next came to the top stand for no mental superiority.\r\nThe problem, in fact, was definitely beyond the grasp of the age. It\r\nremains to realise this by a survey of the process of decline from\r\nself-government to despotism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: Leo estimates that as early as the reign of Louis the\r\nPious the Church owned about one-third of the land of Italy.

It was their supreme necessity; but though the idea was now and\r\nthen broached,[599] there is no sign that the average man ever came\r\nnearer planning for it than did the Ghibelline Dante, with his simple\r\ntheory that Caesar should ride the horse,[600] or than did the clear\r\nbrain of Machiavelli, with its longing for a native ruler[601] like\r\nCesare Borgia, capable of beating down the rival princes and the\r\nadventurers, and of holding his own against the Papacy. One of the\r\nstatesmen who harboured the ideal was Rienzi; but he never wrought for\r\nits realisation, and his devotion to the Papacy as well as to the\r\nheadship of Rome would have made it miscarry had he set it on foot.[602]\r\nThe failure of Cesare Borgia, who of all Italians of his day came\r\nnearest to combining the needed faculties for Italian unification, is\r\nthe proof of the practical impossibility of that solution. But a\r\nfederation of States, it has been reasoned, was relatively feasible; why\r\nthen was it never attempted? As usual, the question has been answered in\r\nthe simple verbalist way, by the decision that the Italians did not\r\nstrike out a political philosophy or science because they were not that\r\nway given. They lacked the \"faculty\" for whatever they did not happen to\r\ndo; whereas the ancient Greeks, on the contrary, did theorise because\r\nthat faculty was theirs, though they had not the faculty to work out the\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\n     _E.g._ the reasoning of so intelligent a thinker as Heeren: \"Among\r\n     those countries in which [political speculation] might have been\r\n     expected to give the earliest sign of life, Italy was undoubtedly\r\n     the first: all the ordinary causes appear to have united here; a\r\n     number of small states arose near each other; republican\r\n     constitutions were established; political parties were everywhere\r\n     at work and at variance; and with all this, the arts and sciences\r\n     were in the full splendour of their revival. The appearance of\r\n     Italy in the fifteenth century recalls most fully the picture of\r\n     ancient Greece. And yet in Italy, political theories were as few as\r\n     in Greece they had been many!--a result both unexpected and\r\n     difficult to explain. Still, however, I think that this phenomenon\r\n     may be in great part accounted for, if we remember that there\r\n     _never was_ a philosophical system of character or influence which\r\n     prospered _under the sky of Italy_. No nation of civilised Europe\r\n     has given birth to so few theories as the Italian: none has had\r\n     less genius for such pursuits. The history of the Roman philosophy,\r\n     a mere echo of the Grecian, proves this of its earlier ages, nor\r\n     was it otherwise in its later.\" (Essay \"On the Rise and Progress of\r\n     Political Theories,\" in _Historical Treatises_, Eng. tr. 1836, p.\r\n     118.)\r\n\r\n     To say nothing of the looseness of the generalisation, which\r\n     ignores alike Thomas Aquinas and Vico, Leonardo and Galileo,\r\n     Machiavelli and Giordano Bruno, it may suffice to note once more\r\n     that on this principle the Germans must be pronounced to have been\r\n     devoid of theoretical faculty before Leibnitz. On that view it does\r\n     not become any more intelligible how \"they\" acquired it.\r\n\r\nSeeking a less vacuous species of explanation, we are soon led to\r\nrecognise (1) that the case of medieval Italy was to the extent of at\r\nleast two factors more complicated than that of ancient Greece; and that\r\nthese factors alone might suffice to explain their non-production of a\r\n\"theory\" which should avail for the need; (2) that the theories of the\r\nGreeks did not avail to solve their problem; and (3) that the Italians\r\nall the while had really two theories too many. At the very emergence of\r\ntheir republics they were already possessed or wrought upon by the\r\nembodied theories of the Empire and the Papacy, two elements never\r\nrepresented in the Greek problem, where empire was an alien and\r\nbarbarian thing suddenly entering into the affairs of civilised Hellas,\r\nand where there was nothing in the nature of the Papacy. These two\r\nforces in Italian life were all along represented by specific theories;\r\nand their clash was a large part of the trouble. Their pressure set up a\r\nchronic clash of parties; and the theorist of to-day may be challenged\r\nto frame a theory which could have worked well for Italy otherwise than\r\nby setting those forces aside--a thing quite impossible in the Middle\r\nAges. If mere system-making on either side could have availed, Thomas\r\nAquinas might have rendered the service.[603]\r\n\r\nThe economic and political destiny of the Church may be said to have\r\nbeen determined in the eleventh century, when, after a desperate\r\nstruggle, begun by Pope Hildebrandt, celibacy was forced on the secular\r\nclergy. The real motive to this policy was of course not ascetic but\r\neconomic, the object being to prevent at once the appropriation of\r\nchurch property by married priests for family purposes, and the creation\r\nof hereditary titles to church benefices. An evolution of that kind had\r\nactually begun; and there can be no question that had it not been\r\nchecked it would have been fatal to the Papacy. Naturally the married\r\nclergy on their part resisted to the uttermost. Only the desperate\r\npolicy of Hildebrandt, withdrawing popular obedience and ecclesiastical\r\nprotection from those who would not give up their wives, broke down the\r\nresistance; and even thereafter Urban II, as we saw, had to resort to\r\nthe odious measure of making priests' wives slaves.[604] From that\r\nperiod we may date the creation of the Church as a unitary political\r\npower. Sacerdotal celibacy took many generations to establish; but when\r\nonce the point was carried it involved a force of incorporation which\r\nonly the strongest political forces--as at the Reformation--could outdo,\r\nand which since the Reformation has kept the Church intact.\r\n\r\n     It is true that the monk Arnold of Brescia, burned alive by the\r\n     Papacy in 1155, fought a long battle (1139-55) against the papal\r\n     power, creating an immense ferment in Lombardy, and rousing a\r\n     strong anti-papal movement in Rome itself (Sismondi, _Republiques\r\n     italiennes_, i, chs. 7, 8; Gibbon, ch. 69); and that, as noted by\r\n     M'Crie (_Reformation in Italy_, p. 1), \"the supremacy claimed by\r\n     the bishops of Rome was resisted in Italy after it had been\r\n     submitted to by the most remote churches of the west\"; but once\r\n     papalised, Italy necessarily remained so in her own pecuniary\r\n     interest. Cp. Rogers, _Economic Interpretation of History_, p. 79.\r\n     Arnold's movement led even to a revolution in Rome; but after he\r\n     had ruled there for ten years, overbearing two successive popes,\r\n     one of greater energy, Adrian IV, excommunicated the city, so\r\n     expelling Arnold. Adrian then, making a bargain with the emperor\r\n     Frederick Barbarossa at his coronation, got the republican leader\r\n     in his power; and the movement ended with Arnold's life. The Papacy\r\n     was now an irremovable element of division in Italy; and disunion\r\n     was thenceforth the lot of the land.\r\n\r\nIf we seek to localise the disease, however, we find that no one factor\r\nis specially responsible. The alien emperor, coming in from outside, and\r\nsetting city against city, Pavia against Milan, and nobles against\r\nburghers, is clearly a force of strife. Again, whereas the cities might\r\non the whole have combined successfully against the emperor, to the\r\npoint of abolishing his rule, the Papacy, calling him in to suit its own\r\npurposes, and calling in yet other aliens at a pinch, is still more a\r\nforce of discord. At times the emperors, in the worst days of Roman\r\ncorruption, had to choose among the competitors nominated to the Papacy\r\nby the intrigues of courtesans and nobles and the venal votes of the\r\npeople, thus identifying the man they chose with their cause.\r\nHildebrandt, again, after securing that the popes should be elected by\r\nthe cardinals, became the fiercest of autocrats. By his strife with\r\nHenry IV he set up civil war through all Italy and Germany; and when in\r\nhis despair he called in the Normans against Rome, they sold most of the\r\npeople into slavery.[605] Later, in the minority of Frederick II,\r\nInnocent III so strengthened the Church that it was able by sheer\r\nslaughter to crush for a generation all Provencal heresy, and was able\r\nto prevail against Frederick in its long struggle with him; in so doing,\r\nhowever, deepening to the uttermost the passion of faction in all the\r\ncities, and so preparing the worst and bloodiest wars of the future.\r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand, if we make abstraction of pope and emperor, and\r\nconsider only the nobles and the citizens, it is clear that they had\r\namong them the seeds of strife immeasurable. The nobles were by training\r\nand habit centres of violence.[606] Their mutual feuds, always tending\r\nto involve the citizens, were a perpetual peril to order; and their\r\ndisregard of law kept them as ready to make war on citizens or cities as\r\non each other. Again and again they were violently expelled from every\r\nLombard city, on the score of their gross and perpetual disorders; but\r\nthey being the chief experts in military matters, they were always\r\nwelcomed back again, because the burghers had need of them as leaders in\r\nthe feuds of city with city, and of Guelphs with Ghibellines. So that\r\nyet again, if we put the nobles out of sight, the spirit of strife as\r\nbetween city and city was sufficient, as in ancient Greece, to make them\r\nall the prey of any invader with a free hand. They could not master the\r\nscience of their problem, could not rise above the plane of primary\r\ntribal or local passion and jealousy; though within each city were\r\nfaction hatreds as bitter as those between the cities as wholes. Already\r\nin the twelfth century we find Milan destroying Lodi and unwalling Como.\r\nLater, in the thirteenth century, Genoa ruins the naval power of\r\nPisa,[607] then under the tyranny of Ugolino, in a war of commercial\r\nhatred, such as Pisa had before waged with Amalfi and with Lucca; in the\r\nfourteenth, Genoa and Venice again and again fight till both are\r\nexhausted, and Genoa accepts a lord to aid her in the struggle, Pisa\r\ndoing likewise, and so recovering strength on land;[608] in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth, Florence spares no cost or effort to keep Pisa\r\nin subjection. This fatal policy, in turn, was the result of the\r\nfrequent attempts of the Pisans to destroy Florentine trade by closing\r\ntheir port to it.[609] All along, inter-civic hates are in full flow\r\nthrough all the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines; and the menace of\r\nneither French nor Spanish tyranny can finally unify the mutually\r\nrepellent communities.\r\n\r\nWe may, indeed, make out a special case against the Papacy, to the\r\neffect that, but for that, Italian intelligence would have had a freer\r\nlife; and that even if Italy, like Spain and France and England,\r\nunderwent despotism in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, her\r\nintellectual activity would have sufficed to work her recovery at least\r\nas rapidly as the process took place elsewhere. It has been argued[610]\r\nthat the liberating force elsewhere in the sixteenth century was the\r\nReformation--a theory which leaves us asking what originated the\r\nReformation in its turn. Taking that to be the spirit of (_a_) inchoate\r\nfree thought, of developing reason, or (_b_) of economic revolt against\r\nthe fiscal exactions of an alien power, or both, we are entitled to say\r\nbroadly that the crushing of such revolt in Italy, as in Provence and in\r\nSpain, clearly came of the special development of the papal power thus\r\nnear its centre--the explanation of \"national character\" being as\r\nnugatory in this as in any other sociological issue.\r\n\r\n     Heeren naturally rests on this solution. The \"new religion,\" he\r\n     says, \"was suited to the north, but not to the south. The calm and\r\n     investigating spirit of the German nations found in it the\r\n     nourishment which it required and sought for.... The more vivid\r\n     imagination and sensitive feelings of the people of the south ...\r\n     found little to please them in its tenets.... It was not,\r\n     therefore, owing to the prohibitions of the government, but to the\r\n     character of the nations themselves, that the Reformation found no\r\n     support among them\" (vol. cited, pp. 58, 59). The two explanations\r\n     of climate and race can thus be employed alternatively at need.\r\n     Ireland, though \"northern,\" is to be got rid of as not being\r\n     \"German.\" For the rest, the Albigenses, the _paterini_, the\r\n     reforming Franciscans, and the myriad victims of the Inquisition in\r\n     Spain, are conveniently ignored. Heeren's phrase about the \"almost\r\n     total exclusion\" of the southern countries from the \"great ferment\r\n     of ideas which in other countries of civilised Europe gave activity\r\n     and life to the human intellect\" can be described only as a piece\r\n     of concentrated misinformation. And a similar judgment must be\r\n     passed on the summing-up of Mr. Symonds that \"Germany achieved the\r\n     labour of the Reformation almost single-handed\" (_Renaissance in\r\n     Italy_, 2nd ed. i, 28). There is far more truth in the verdict of\r\n     Guizot, that \"la principale lutte d'erudition et de doctrine contre\r\n     l'Eglise catholique a ete soutenue par la reforme francaise; c'est\r\n     en France et en Hollande, et toujours en francais, qu'ont ete\r\n     ecrits tants d'ouvrages philosophiques, historiques, polemiques, a\r\n     l'appui de cette cause\" (_Civilisation en France_, i, 18). Motley,\r\n     though an uncritical Teutophile and Gallophobe, admits as to\r\n     Holland that \"the Reformation first entered the Provinces, not\r\n     through the Augsburg but the Huguenot gate\" (_Rise of the Dutch\r\n     Republic_, ed. 1863, p. 162). As to the spirit of reformation in\r\n     Italy and Spain, the student may consult the two careful and\r\n     learned _Histories_ of M'Crie, works which might have saved many\r\n     vain generalisations by later writers, had they heeded them. The\r\n     question of the supposed racial determination of the Reformation is\r\n     discussed at some length in _The Saxon and the Celt_, pp. 92-97,\r\n     143-47, 203, 204. Cp. _The Dynamics of Religion_, 1897, pt. i;\r\n     _Letters on Reasoning_, 2nd ed. 1905, pp. 20-24; and _A Short\r\n     History of Freethought_, vol. i, chs. ix, x, xi.\r\n\r\nThe history of Italian religious life shows that the spirit of sheer\r\nreformation in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was stronger there\r\nthan even in France in the sixteenth, where again it was perhaps\r\npositively stronger than in Germany, though not stronger relatively to\r\nthe resistance. And in Italy the resistance was personified in the\r\nPapacy, which there had its seat and strength. When all is said,\r\nhowever, the facts remain that in England the Reformation meant sordid\r\nspoliation, retrogression in culture, and finally civil war; that in\r\nFrance it meant long periods of furious strife; that in Germany, where\r\nit \"prospered,\" it meant finally a whole generation of the most ruinous\r\nwarfare the modern world had seen, throwing back German civilisation a\r\nfull hundred years. Save for the original agony of conquest and the\r\nspecial sting of subjection to alien rule, Italy suffered in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries less evils than these.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of our retrospect, then, is: (1) generally, that as between\r\nmedieval Italian development and that of other countries--say our\r\nown--there has been difference, not of \"race character\" and \"faculty,\"\r\nbut of favouring and adverse conditions; and (2) particularly, that\r\ncertain social evils which went on worsening in Florence and are in some\r\ndegree present in all societies to-day, call for scientific treatment\r\nlest they go on worsening with us. The modern problem is in many\r\nrespects different from that of pre-Reformation Italy; but the forces\r\nconcerned are kindred, and it may be worth while to note the broad facts\r\nof the past process with some particularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThe central fact of disunion in Italian life, complicated as we have\r\nseen it to be by extraneous factors, analyses down to the eternal\r\nconflict of interests of the rich and the poor, the very rich and the\r\nless rich, or, as Italian humour figured it, the \"fat\" and the \"lean.\"\r\nFor Machiavelli this is the salient trouble in the Florentine\r\nretrospect, since it survived the feuds of Guelph and Ghibelline; though\r\nhe sets down to the Papacy the foreign invasions and the disunion of the\r\ncities. The faction-feuds, of course, tell of the psychological\r\nconditions of the feud of rich and poor, and were to some extent an\r\nearly form of the feud,[611] the imperialist Ghibellines being\r\noriginally the more aristocratic faction; while the papalist Guelphs, by\r\nthe admission of Machiavelli, were the more friendly to the popular\r\nliberties, that being the natural course for the Papacy to take. The\r\nimperial cause, on the other hand, was badly compromised by the tyranny\r\nof the terrible Ezzelino III, the representative of Frederick II in the\r\nTrevisan March, who ruled half-a-dozen cities in a fashion never\r\nexceeded for cruelty in the later ages of Italian tyranny.[612] Whatever\r\ndemocratic feeling there was must needs be on the other side.\r\n\r\nAfter Florence had recast its constitution at the death of Frederick\r\nII, establishing twelve _anziani_ or magistrates, replaced every two\r\nmonths, and two foreign judges--one the upper-class _podesta_ and the\r\nother the captain of the people[613]--to prevent grounds of quarrel,\r\nmatters were in fair train, and the city approved its unity by the\r\nsinister steps of forcing Pistoia, Arezzo, and Siena to join its\r\nconfederation, capturing Volterra, and destroying several villages,\r\nwhose inhabitants were deported to Florence. But new plots on behalf of\r\nManfred led to the expulsion of the Ghibellines, who in turn, getting\r\nthe upper hand with no sense of permanence, reasoned that to make their\r\nparty safe they must destroy the city; a purpose changed, as the\r\nfamiliar story goes, only by the protest of the Florentine Ghibelline\r\nchief, Farinata degli Uberti. They then tried, in obvious bad faith, the\r\nexpedient of conciliating the people, whom they had always hitherto\r\noppressed, by giving them a quasi-democratic constitution, in which the\r\nskilled workers were recognised as bodies, to which all citizens had to\r\nbelong.[614] But this scheme being accompanied by fresh taxation, the\r\nGhibellines were driven out by force; and once more the Guelphs, now\r\nbacked by Charles of Anjou (1266), organised a government of twelve\r\nmagistrates, adding a council of twenty-four upper-class citizens,\r\ncalled the _credenza_, and yet another body of 180 popular deputies,\r\nthirty for each of the six quarters of the city, making up with the\r\nothers a Council General. To this, however, was strangely added yet\r\nanother council of 120, charged with executive functions. The purpose\r\nwas to identify the Guelph cause with that of the people--that is, the\r\nlower _bourgeoisie_ and skilled artisans; and the property of the exiled\r\nGhibellines was confiscated and divided among the public treasury, the\r\nheads of the ruling party, and the Guelphs in general. At this stage the\r\neffort of Gregory X, at his election, to effect a restoration of the\r\nGhibellines and a general reconciliation, naturally failed. Yet when his\r\nsuccessor, Nicolas III, persisted in the anti-French policy, he was able\r\nthrough his northern legate to persuade the city, suffering from the\r\nlawlessness of the Guelph as of old from that of the Ghibelline nobles,\r\nto recall the latter and set up a new constitution of fourteen\r\ngovernors, seven of each party, all nominated by the Pope--a system\r\nwhich lasted ten years. Then came another French interregnum;\r\nwhereafter, on the fall of the French rule in Sicily in 1282, there was\r\nset up yet another constitution of compromise. For the council of\r\nfourteen was set up one of three _priori delle arti_, heads of the\r\ncrafts--a number immediately raised to six, so as to give one prior to\r\neach ward of the city, with a change in the title to _signoria_. These\r\nwere to be elected every two months. The system, aristocratic in respect\r\nof its small governing body, yet by its elective method lent itself\r\npeculiarly to the new _bourgeois_ tendencies; and thenceforward, says\r\nMachiavelli, we find the parties of Guelph and Ghibelline in Florence\r\nsupplanted by the simpler enmity of rich and poor. Soon many of the\r\nnobles, albeit Guelph, were driven out of the city, or declared\r\ndisqualified for priorship on the score of their past disorders; and\r\noutside they set up new feuds.\r\n\r\nWhile Florence thus held out, other cities sought safety in\r\none-man-power, choosing some noble as \"captain of the people\" and\r\nsetting him above the magistrates. Thus Pagano della Torre, a Guelph,\r\nbecame war-lord of Milan, and his brothers succeeded him, till the\r\noffice came to be looked on as hereditary, and other cities inclined to\r\nchoose the same head. And so astutely egotistic was the action of all\r\nthe forces concerned, that when the Guelph house of Della Torre thus\r\nbecame unmanageably powerful, the Papacy did not scruple to appoint to\r\nthe archbishopric of Milan an exiled Ghibelline, Visconti.\r\n\"Henceforward,\" says Sismondi, \"the rivalry between the families of\r\nDella Torre and Visconti made that between the people and the nobles\r\nalmost forgotten.\" The Visconti finally defeated the other faction, made\r\nMilan Ghibelline, and became its virtual rulers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the entrance of a French army under Charles of Anjou,\r\ncalled in by a French pope to conquer the Ghibelline realm of the Two\r\nSicilies (1266), put a due share of wrong to the account of the Guelphs,\r\nthe French power standing for something very like barbarism. Its first\r\nachievement was to exterminate the Saracen name and religion in Sicily.\r\nOn its heels came a new irruption from Germany, in the person of\r\nConradin, the claimant of the imperial succession, to whom joined\r\nthemselves Pisa and Siena, in opposition to their big neighbour and\r\nenemy Florence, and the people of Rome itself, at quarrel with their\r\nPope, who had left the city for Viterbo. By Conradin's defeat the French\r\npower became paramount; and then it was that the next pope, Gregory X,\r\nsought to restore the Ghibellines as counterpoise: a policy pursued by\r\nhis successor, to the end, however, of substituting (1278) papal for\r\nimperial claims over Italy. Even Florence at his wish recalled her\r\nGhibellines. But then came the forced election of another French pope,\r\nwho acted wholly in the French interest, and re-exiled everywhere the\r\nGhibellines: a process speedily followed in turn by the \"Sicilian\r\nVespers,\" involving the massacre and expulsion of the French, and\r\nintroducing a Spanish king as representative of the imperial line. Again\r\nthe Papacy encouraged the other power, relieving Charles II, as King of\r\nNaples, from his treaty oath, and set him upon making a war with Sicily,\r\nwhich dragged for twenty-four years. Such were the main political\r\nfeatures of the Italy of Dante. The Papacy, becoming a prize of the\r\nleading Roman families, played a varying game as between the two\r\nmonarchies of the south and their partisans in the north; and the minor\r\ncities, like the greater, underwent chronic revolutions. Still, so\r\nabundant was the Italian outflow of intellectual and inventive energy,\r\nso substantial was the general freedom of the cities, and so soundly was\r\nthe average regimen founded on energetic agriculture and commerce, that\r\nwealth abounded on all hands.\r\n\r\nWith the new French invasion (1302) under Charles of Valois, called in\r\nby Boniface VIII to aid him against Sicily, a partially new stage\r\nbegins. Charles was received at Florence as the typical Guelph; but,\r\nbeing counselled by the pope to pacify Tuscany to his own advantage,\r\nallied himself with the ultra-Guelphs, the _Neri_, gave up to plunder,\r\nthe proceeds of which he pocketed, the houses of the other or\r\npro-Ghibelline faction, the _Bianchi_, and enforced the execution or\r\nexile of its leading men, including Dante. Then came the election of a\r\nstrictly French pope and his establishment at Avignon. A new lease being\r\nnow given to faction, the cities rapidly lapsed into the over-lord\r\nsystem as the only means of preserving order; and when in 1316 a new\r\nemperor, Henry VII, presented himself for homage and claimed to place an\r\nimperial vicar in each city, most were well disposed to agree. When\r\nhowever Henry, like Charles, showed himself mainly bent on plunder,\r\ndemanding 100,000 florins from Milan and 60,000 from Genoa, he destroyed\r\nhis prestige. He had insisted on the recall of all exiles of either\r\nparty; but all united against his demands, save the Pisans, who had sent\r\nhim 60,000 florins in advance. His sudden death, on his way to fight the\r\nforces of Naples, left everything in a new suspense, save that Pisa,\r\nalready shorn of maritime power, was soon eclipsed, after setting up a\r\nmilitary tyranny as a last resort.\r\n\r\nThe _regime_ of the local tyrant now rapidly developed. On the fall of\r\nthe Pisan tyrant rose that of Lucca, Castruccio Castracani, the great\r\ntype, after Ezzelino, of the Italian despot-adventurer of the\r\nRenaissance. Such a leader was too dangerous an antagonist to such a\r\ncorporation as that of Florence--once more (1323) reconstructed on an\r\nupper-class basis, with a scrutinised franchise, election by ballot, and\r\na more complicated system of offices than ever.[615] To command them\r\nagainst Castruccio, they called in the Catalonian general Cardona, who\r\nutterly failed them. He took the course of so handling and placing his\r\ntroops as to force those citizens in the army who could afford it to buy\r\nleave of absence, and was finally defeated with his wilfully weakened\r\narmy. Florence was driven to call in the King of Naples, at the price of\r\nconferring the _signoria_ on his son. Meanwhile the new emperor Ludwig,\r\ncalled in by Castruccio, plundered the Milanese and imprisoned their\r\nlords, the Visconti, who had been of his own party; extorted 150,000\r\nflorins from the Pisans; tortured, to extort treasure, a Ghibelline who\r\nhad given up to him a fortress in the papal State; and generally showed\r\nthe Italians, before he withdrew, that a German tyrant could beat even a\r\nnative at once in treachery, cruelty, and avarice. Castruccio and the\r\nson of the King of Naples, who had proved a bad bargain, died about the\r\nsame time as did the reigning Visconti at Milan, the reigning tyrant at\r\nMantua, and Can' Grande of Verona, the successor of Ezzelino, who had\r\nconquered Padua. Again the encouraged middle class of Florence recast\r\ntheir constitution (1328), annulling the old councils and electing two\r\nnew: a Council of the \"People,\" composed of 300 middle-class citizens,\r\nand a Council of the Commune, composed of 250 of both orders. Elsewhere\r\nthe balance inclined to anarchy and despotism, as of old. A new emperor,\r\nJohn of Bohemia, offered (1330) a new chance of pacification, eagerly\r\nwelcomed, to a harassed people, in large part shaken by military dangers\r\nin its devotion to republicanism, and weary of local tyrannies. But\r\nagainst the new imperialism Florence stoutly held out, with the aid of\r\nLombard Ghibellines; the new emperor, leaving Italy, sold his influence\r\neverywhere to local tyrants, and once more everything was in suspense.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1336, there occurred the new phenomenon of a combination\r\nbetween Florence and Venice against a new tyrant of Padua and Lucca, who\r\nhad betrayed Florence; but the Venetians in turn did the same thing,\r\nleaving the Florentines half a million of florins in debt; whereupon\r\nthey were attacked by their old enemies the Pisans, who heavily defeated\r\nthem and captured Lucca, for which Florence had been fighting. It was in\r\nthis stage of demoralisation that the Florentines (1342) suddenly forced\r\ntheir _signoria_ to give the war-lordship to the French Gaultier de\r\nBrienne, \"Duke of Athens,\" formerly the right-hand man of the son of the\r\nKing of Naples, who had now been sent to them as a new commander by that\r\nking, on the request of the Commission of Twenty charged with the war.\r\nThe commission elected him to the sole command in order to save\r\nthemselves[616] and pacify the people; and his natural associates, the\r\nold nobility, counselled him to seize the government, which he gradually\r\ndid, beheading and exiling the discredited middle-class leaders, and so\r\nwinning the support of the populace, who, on his putting himself for\r\nopen election to the _signoria_ for one year, acclaimed him to the\r\nfunction for life. To this pass had come the see-saw of middle class\r\n(_popolo_) and upper class, with a populace held in pupilage.\r\n\r\n     Sismondi, in his _Short History_, pp. 147, 148, seems to represent\r\n     the episode as wholly one of wanton popular caprice and venality,\r\n     even representing that Duke Gaultier was only by chance in the\r\n     city. The narrative of Machiavelli explicitly sets forth how he\r\n     came through the appeal of the Commission of Twenty; how the\r\n     nobility and some of the _bourgeoisie_ conspired with him; and how\r\n     the populace were worked upon by the conspirators. The public\r\n     acclamation, bad as it was, had been carefully subsidised. The\r\n     middle class, whose war policy, however, had brought the city into\r\n     such danger, were far more guilty than the mostly unenfranchised\r\n     populace. Sismondi had latterly an undue faith in the principle of\r\n     middle-class rule. (Cp. Mr. Boulting's Memoir in his recast of the\r\n     _Republiques_, p. xxiv.) In his _Histoire des republiques\r\n     italiennes_ (v, 329-53) he sets forth the financial corruption of\r\n     the middle-class rulers (p. 330), and recognises that they and the\r\n     aristocrats were alike dangerous to liberty. Cp. as to his change\r\n     of front, F. Morin, _Origines de la democratie_, 3e edit. 1865,\r\n     introd. pp. 17-18.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, partly on the sudden pressure of a scarcity, the tyrant\r\nwas overthrown, after having wrung from Florence 400,000 florins and\r\ninfuriated all classes against him and his race. Not the least of his\r\noffences was his conclusion of a peace with Pisa, by which she for a\r\ngiven period was to rule over Lucca. The rising against him was\r\nuniversal. Three of his henchmen were literally torn to pieces with\r\nhands and teeth: a madness of fury which was only too profoundly in\r\nkeeping with the self-abandonment that had placed the tyrant in power.\r\nThe political organism was beginning to disintegrate. A new constitution\r\nwas set up, with a leaning to aristocracy, which was soon upset by the\r\nmiddle class, who in turn established yet another. The nobles, believing\r\nthe populace to be hostile to the _bourgeoisie_, attempted anew a\r\nrevolution, and were utterly crushed. And now began, according to the\r\ngreatest of the publicists of the Renaissance, the final enfeeblement of\r\nFlorence, in that the ruin of the nobility, whose one merit had been\r\ntheir fighting power, led to the abandonment of all military\r\nexercise.[617] Yet Florence a generation later made vigorous war under a\r\n\"committee,\" and in the meantime at least the city tasted domestic peace\r\nand grew in civilisation. And though we doubtless exaggerate when we\r\nconceive of a transition from what we are apt to figure as the fierce\r\nand laughterless Florence of Dante to the gay Florence of the Medici, it\r\nis hard to hold that life was worsened when men changed the ways which\r\nmade them collectively capable of rending with their teeth the carcases\r\nof those they hated, and which left the Viscontis of Milan capable of\r\ntorturing their political prisoners to death through forty days.\r\n\r\nStill the process of disintegration and reintegration proceeded. The\r\ntyrants of the smaller cities usually established themselves by the aid\r\nof professional mercenaries, German and other, whom, when their funds\r\nfailed, they turned loose to shift for themselves, having in the\r\nmeantime disarmed the citizens. These companies, swelled by others\r\ndisbanded after the English wars in France, ravaged and plundered Italy\r\nfrom Montferrat to Naples, and were everywhere bought off save by\r\nFlorence. Only the Pope and the greater tyrants could keep them\r\nregularly in pay; and by their means the Viscontis became lords of\r\nsixteen cities of Lombardy, while the Papacy began to build up a\r\nmilitary power. Naples, on the other hand, continuously degenerated;\r\nwhile Genoa and Venice exhausted each other in deadly strife for the\r\ncommercial monopoly of the East; and Pisa leaned to the Viscontis, who\r\nultimately obtained its headship.\r\n\r\nRome, popeless, and domineered over by warring nobles, had its brief\r\nvision of a republic under the dreamer Cola di Rienzi, who at last fell\r\nby the hand of the masses whom he had for a brief space hypnotised.\r\nNeither he nor they were meet for the destiny they fain would have\r\nfulfilled; and had people and leader alike been worthier, they would\r\nultimately have failed to master the forces joined against them.\r\nRienzi's brief, and on some sides remarkably vigorous, administration in\r\n1346-47 was not wholly unworthy of his ideal of \"the good estate\"; he\r\nseems, indeed, to have ruled the Roman territory with an efficiency that\r\nrecalled the ancient State; and his early successes against the nobles\r\ntell of unexpected weakness on their side and energy on that of the\r\npeople. His dream of an Italian federation, too, remains to prove that\r\nhe was no mere mob-leader. But had he been as stable in purpose and\r\npolicy as he was heady and capricious, and had the Roman populace been\r\nas steadfast as it was turbulent, the forces of division represented by\r\nthe nobles and the Papacy would ultimately have overthrown any\r\nrepublican polity. What Florence could not compass, Rome could not\r\nmaintain. Two centuries before, Arnold of Brescia had fallen, after\r\nfifteen years of popularity, as soon as pope and emperor joined hands\r\nagainst him; and the papalism of Rienzi was as fatal to him as\r\nanti-papalism had been to Arnold. Had Rienzi had his way, the Pope would\r\nhave at once returned to Rome; and where the Papacy was, no republic\r\ncould endure, however strong and sober were its head. And Rienzi was not\r\nsober. After his overthrow in 1347 and his seven years of wandering\r\nexile, he was restored solely by the choice and as the agent of the Pope\r\nat Avignon; and his death in a tumult after four months of renewed\r\noffice was the end of his cause.\r\n\r\nIn Florence the disintegration went on apace. A new emperor, Charles IV,\r\ncharged the city 100,000 florins (1355) for her immunities, leaving all\r\nmen hopeless as ever of the Empire as a political solution; and when the\r\ncrimes of the Viscontis drove cities and Papacy to call Charles in\r\nagainst them (1368), he did but use the opportunity to levy blackmail\r\nwherever he went. Later (1375), the Papacy combined with Florence\r\nagainst the reigning Visconti, but only to betray its ally. And now\r\noccurred what for a time must have seemed a vital revolution in Italian\r\naffairs; the infuriated Florentines suddenly allying themselves with\r\nVisconti, the enemy of the day before, against the treacherous Pope, and\r\nframing a league with Siena, Lucca, and Pisa against the Church that\r\nFlorence had so long sustained. Eighty towns in ten days drove out their\r\nlegates; and furious reprisals broke out on all hands, till the very\r\nPope at Avignon was fain to come to stay the universal warfare. Now,\r\nhowever, an aristocratic and papalist party in Florence bitterly opposed\r\n\"The Eight\" who managed the war, the aristocracy having gravitated to\r\nthe papal side; and at length exhaustion and the absolute instability\r\nof all alliances brought about a peace in which most of the cities,\r\nfreed from the Papacy--now become an affair of two mutually\r\nanathematising heads--fell once more under local tyrants. In the hour of\r\nextreme need the Papacy was, if possible, a worse influence than the\r\nemperor; nowhere was to be found a force of stability save in the\r\ntyrannies, which were merely unstable with a difference.\r\n\r\nFlorence, still republican and still obstinately prosperous, stood as a\r\nstrange anomaly in the general transformation. But she had now reached\r\nthe stage when the long-ignored populace--the multitude beneath the\r\n_popolo_--made up of handworkers with no nominal incorporation or\r\nfranchise, was able to press its claims as against the other orders,\r\nwhich in turn were divided, as of old, by the jealousies between the\r\nmajor and minor middle-class guilds and between the new nobility of\r\ncapital and their former equals. Refused the status of incorporation,\r\nthe _ciompi_ (\"chums\" or \"mates,\" from the French _compere_) made\r\n_their_ insurrection in turn, finding for the nonce in a wool-carder a\r\nleader of the best quality the time could show, who carried his point,\r\nwas chosen head magistrate, enforced order among his own partisans, and\r\nestablished a new magistracy, with three representatives of the major\r\narts, three of the minor (1378).\r\n\r\n     Among other things, the _ciompi_ demanded that interest should no\r\n     longer be paid on the public debt; that the principal be paid off\r\n     in twelve years, and that no \"small people\" should be sued for\r\n     debts under fifty florins for the next two years (see Trollope, ii,\r\n     216). The trouble was that the brains in the movement, good as they\r\n     were, could not permanently control the spirit of riot. Sismondi,\r\n     after arguing (_Short History_, p. 182) in the Whig manner that\r\n     \"those who have not learnt to think, those to whom manual labour\r\n     leaves no time for meditation, ought not to undertake the guidance\r\n     of their fellow-citizens,\" amusingly proceeds (p. 185) to point to\r\n     the capacity of Lando as showing \"how much a free government\r\n     spreads sound sense and elevated sentiments among even the lowest\r\n     classes of society.\" Immediately afterwards he has to record how\r\n     the upper classes fell into fresh disorders.\r\n\r\nBut where the educated burgesses and nobles had failed in the science of\r\nself-government, the mass of untrained toilers[618] could not succeed.\r\nSuborned doubtless by the other classes, they rebelled against the man\r\nwhom they had made leader, and were by him promptly and capably\r\nsuppressed, many being exiled; whereupon in due course he was himself\r\ndeprived of his post by the old parties, and the new order was annulled\r\n(1382). After fresh strifes and proscriptions among the aristocracy\r\nthemselves, all traces of the popular rising were effaced, and the\r\naristocracy of wealth was definitely re-established.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was the attainment of the capitalistic stage and the\r\nenthronement of capital in the republican State. In place of strifes\r\nbetween wealth and nobility there had arisen the strife of capital and\r\nlabour, the new aristocracy of wealth having in large part taken the\r\nplace of that of descent. The latter transition had occurred nearly\r\nsimultaneously in the other remaining Republics. Genoa had substituted\r\nfactions with the names of new wealthy families for the old. In Siena,\r\nwhere the _bourgeoisie_ dispossessed the nobles, they were in turn\r\nassailed by \"reformers\" of the lower class, who were finally defeated in\r\nbattle and exiled wholesale (1385). Meantime the hereditary tyrants of\r\nMilan, the Visconti, with their singular continuity of capacity, had\r\ngrown stronger than ever, had built up a native and scientific military\r\nsystem, and more than ever menaced all their neighbours. Florence called\r\nin aid successively from Germany and France (1390-91); but the Milanese\r\narmy triumphed over all; and the skilled adventurer Sir John Hawkwood,\r\nthe hired general of the Florentine troops, could not hold his ground.\r\nThe Emperor, as usual, was satisfied to take payment for\r\nnon-intervention; and the reigning Visconti, Gian Galeazza, invested by\r\nthe Emperor with the titles of Duke of Mantua and Count of Pavia, and\r\nthe lordship of twenty-six cities, had by the year 1402 further\r\ncompassed, by all manner of fraud and force, the mastery of Pisa,\r\nPerugia, Genoa, Siena, Lucca, and Bologna, dying of the plague at the\r\nheight of his power. His sons being boys, his power broke up among his\r\ngenerals, to be in large part recovered later, however, by his second\r\nson, who first assassinated the elder.\r\n\r\nAt this stage Venice once more intervenes, taking up the cause of Verona\r\nagainst the tyrant of Padua, whom, having defeated him by her\r\ncarefully-chosen and supervised mercenaries, she put to death (1406). He\r\nhad been the ally of Florence; but Florence let him fall, being now\r\nwholly bent on reconquering Pisa, her natural seaport. Pisa, in turn,\r\nalways invincibly opposed to Florentine rule, was on commercial grounds\r\nbacked by Genoa, now under the nominal rule of a representative of the\r\nKing of France, who, however, sought to sell Pisa to the Florentines,\r\nand did receive from them 200,000 florins. Still resisting, the Pisans\r\nrecalled an exile to lead them; and he in turn sold them for 50,000\r\nflorins, this time to their complete undoing. Refusing all Florentine\r\nfavours, the bulk of the ruling middle-class abandoned the city for\r\never, taking much of its special commerce with them. Meantime, the\r\nkingdom of Naples, under an energetic king, Ladislaus, had acquired most\r\nof the States of the distracted Church, menaced Florence, and was\r\npressing her hard, despite French support, when Ladislaus died (1414).\r\nBy this time the new Visconti was establishing himself at Milan by means\r\nof mercenaries, commanded for him by well-chosen captains. Six times\r\nwere the Florentines defeated by his forces; till his capable general,\r\nCarmagnola, whom he had disgraced, revealed to the Council of Venice his\r\nmaster's intention to attack them; and Venice joined Florence to crush\r\nthe tyrant. Carmagnola, acting slackly, met ill success, and was\r\ntherefore executed by his Venetian masters. But the Visconti too finally\r\ndied defeated, leaving his power to a new adventurer, Francesco Sforza,\r\nwho had married his daughter, and had fought both for and against him in\r\nthe endless imbroglio of Italian conspiracy.\r\n\r\nFlorentine republicanism was now near its euthanasia. By the fatal law\r\nof empire, the perpetual enterprise of destroying other men's freedom\r\nleft Florence unfit to use or to defend her own; and the tyrants of Pisa\r\nbecame meet for the yoke of tyranny. The family of Medici, growing\r\nrapidly rich, began to use the power of capital as elsewhere less astute\r\nadventurers used the power of the sword. From the overthrow of the\r\n_ciompi_ party in 1382 to 1434, the Republic had been ruled by a faction\r\nof the new commercial aristocracy with substantial unity; and the period\r\nis claimed as the most prosperous, intellectually and materially, though\r\nnot the most progressive, in Florentine history.\r\n\r\n     See above, p. 226-27. Perrens (_Histoire de Florence_, trans.\r\n     cited, pp. 171-72, 202) thinks otherwise, but does not blame the\r\n     oligarchy. Sismondi, in his larger and earlier work (_Republiques_,\r\n     ed. 1826, xi, 2), represents that Florence _ceased_ to be great\r\n     under the Medici; cp. however, xii, 52, and the different note in\r\n     the reactionary _Short History_ (p. 224), where he deems that in\r\n     this period were born and formed \"all those great men\" whose glory\r\n     is credited to the Medici. This holds good of Brunelleschi the\r\n     architect, Masallio the artist, and Ghiberti the sculptor, as well\r\n     as of Poggio and other scholars. Cp. Zeller, _Histoire d'Italie_,\r\n     1853, p. 309, and the list given by Perrens, _Histoire de\r\n     Florence_, trans. cited, p. 456. M. Perrens pronounces that under\r\n     Lorenzo \"the decadence of sculpture is visible, and still more that\r\n     of architecture,\" both being too rapidly produced from motives of\r\n     gain (_La civilisation florentine du 13e siecle au 16e_, 1893, p.\r\n     190). Here he follows Romohr (see _Histoire de Florence_, last\r\n     cited). Lorenzo, he notes, had the reactionary belief, odd on the\r\n     part of a merchant, that only nobles could produce perfect work,\r\n     they only having the necessary leisure. He accordingly ignored all\r\n     plebeian genius, such as that of Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nCosimo de' Medici, descendant of a democrat, was grown too rich to be\r\none in his turn; and between him and the Albizzi, who led the ruling\r\nfaction, there grew up one of the old and typical jealousies of\r\npower-seekers. Exiled by a packed _balia_, Cosimo's wealth enabled him\r\nto turn the tables in a year and exile his exilers, taking their place\r\nand silently absorbing their power. \"The moment was come when the credit\r\nof the Medici was to prevail over the legal power of the Florentine\r\n_signoria_.\" Thus when the Visconti died, Cosimo and the doge of Venice\r\ncombined their forces to prevent the recovery of the republican\r\nindependence of Milan, whose middle class, divided by their own\r\njealousies, speedily succumbed to the fraud and force of Sforza, the\r\nVisconti's heir.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years Cosimo maintained at Florence, by the power of capital,\r\nprosperity and peace under the semblance of the old constitution, the\r\nricher of the ever-renewed capitalist class accepting his primacy, while\r\nthe populace, being more equitably governed than of yore under the old\r\nnobility, and being steadily prosperous, saw no ground for revolt.\r\nCapital as \"tyrant\" had in fact done what the tyrants of early Greece\r\nand Rome are presumed to have often done--favoured the people as against\r\nthe aristocracy; Cosimo's liberality giving employment and pay at the\r\nsame time to the artisans and to the scholars. Under Cosimo and his\r\npolitical colleagues, doubtless, the subject cities were corruptly\r\ngoverned; but Florence seems to have been discreetly handled. Attempts\r\nto break the capitalistic domination came to nothing, save the exile or\r\nat a pinch the death of the malcontents.\r\n\r\n     [Under all of the Medici, it appears, \"the fiscal legislation\r\n     adhered to the principle of burdening the old nobility of the city\"\r\n     (Von Reumont, _Lorenzo de' Medici_, Eng. tr. i, 33). They however\r\n     built up a fresh public debt, and their finance had very crooked\r\n     aspects, especially under Lorenzo, who lacked the mercantile\r\n     faculty of his grandfather (_id._ pp. 31-33. Cp. Perrens, _Histoire\r\n     de Florence_, trans. cited, pp. 55-60, 288, 408-13, 416-17).\r\n     Lorenzo was even accused of appropriating the dowries of orphan\r\n     girls; and it seems clear that he defrauded the _monte delle doti_,\r\n     or dowry bank.\r\n\r\n     As regards fiscal policy, it may be interesting to note that in\r\n     Florence taxes had been imposed alternately on capital or income\r\n     from the thirteenth century onwards, both being taken at the lowest\r\n     values, and rated at from one-half to three per cent. according to\r\n     the _estimo_ (Esquiron de Parieu, _Traite des impots_, 2e edit.\r\n     1866, i, 417). These taxes in turn were probably suggested by the\r\n     practice of ancient Athens, where extraordinary revenue for war\r\n     purposes was obtained \"partly from voluntary contributions, partly\r\n     from a graduated income or property tax.\" In 1266 a fresh\r\n     income-tax of ten per cent. on an already heavily taxed city\r\n     incited the decisive rising against the rule of the Ghibelline\r\n     Count Guido. The earlier historians of Florence, like most others,\r\n     pay little attention to the history of taxation; but details emerge\r\n     for the later period.\r\n\r\n     In 1427 Giovanni de' Medici imposed on Florence a tax called the\r\n     _catasto_--apparently not, like earlier taxes of the same name,\r\n     based on a survey of land, but on disposable or movable\r\n     capital--and also one of 1/2 per cent. on income over what was\r\n     necessary to support life. Further, he levied a super-tax, which\r\n     was paid by 1,400 citizens out of the 10,000 who came under the\r\n     _catasto_. At a pinch, the _catasto_ was levied several times in\r\n     the year. Yet further, a regularly graduated income-tax was imposed\r\n     by Cosimo de' Medici, in 1441, and raised in 1443; but, in this\r\n     case, the salutary principle of sparing the amount of income\r\n     necessary to sustain life seems to have been departed from, since\r\n     incomes of from one to fifty florins paid 4 per cent., the rate\r\n     gradually rising thereafter to 33-1/3 per cent. for incomes over\r\n     1,500 florins. By reason of bad finance, further, taxes had now to\r\n     be levied even ten and fifteen times a year. Cp. Perrens, as last\r\n     cited. It is yet further noteworthy that, from 1431 to 1458,\r\n     traders were required to show their books to the revenue officers\r\n     for the purpose of fair assessment. The abandonment of this\r\n     provision seems to have been partly due to the evasions practised\r\n     by the traders, partly to the irritation and the abuses set up by\r\n     it.]\r\n\r\nAt Cosimo's death there was dynastic strife of capital, as elsewhere of\r\nblood; but the blundering financier Pitti went to the wall, and the\r\ninvalid Piero de' Medici kept his father's power. At his death the group\r\nof his henchmen kept their hold on it; and in time his son Lorenzo\r\nousted them and engrossed all, escaping the plot which was fatal to his\r\nbrother. The failure of that and other plots, in Florence and elsewhere,\r\nsufficed to prove that the artisans, well employed and protected by the\r\nlaws, had no concern to upset the orderly and business-like \"tyranny\"\r\neither of one great capitalist or of a prince, in the interest of an\r\noligarchy which would rule no better, which gave them no more of\r\npolitical privilege than did he, and which was less ready than he with\r\npublic gifts. Thus he had little difficulty in cutting down every\r\ninstitution that restricted his power, whether popular or\r\noligarchic.[619] Italian republicanism had always been a matter of\r\neither upper-class or middle-class rule; and when the old upper class of\r\nfeudal descent was superseded by one of commercial descent, the populace\r\nhad nothing to gain by supporting the bourgeoisie. A capitalistic\r\n\"lord,\" most of whose wealth was in its nature unseizable, was thus a\r\nmore stable power than any mere swordsman among swordsmen; and Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici not only crushed all the conspiracies against him, but held\r\nhis own against the dangerous alliance of the republican Pope Sixtus IV\r\nand the King of Naples--the menace of Turkish invasion helping him.\r\nWhen, early in his reign, he joined in and carried through the plot for\r\nthe confiscation of Volterra, chiefly in order to secure a hold on its\r\nrich alum mines, his popularity at Florence was in the ratio of the\r\nbaseness of his triumph. As always, imperialism and corruption went hand\r\nin hand, and the Florentines ensured their own servitude by their\r\neagerness to compass the fall of others.[620]\r\n\r\nAfter Lorenzo's death (1492) only the incompetence of his son Piero at\r\nthe hazardous juncture of the new French invasion under Charles VIII\r\ncould upset the now hereditary power of the house; but such incompetence\r\nat such a crisis was sufficient, Savonarola having now set up a new\r\ndemocratic force, partly analogous to that of Puritanism in the England\r\nof a later age. The new party, however, brought no new political\r\nscience.[621] Republican Florence in its interim of self-government\r\nproceeded as of old to make war on indomitable Pisa, with which it could\r\nnever consent to live on terms of equality. Time after time, vanquished\r\nby force and treachery, the Pisans had again cast loose, fighting for\r\nindependence as fiercely as did their fathers of a previous generation.\r\nSavonarola, who had no better light for this problem than was given to\r\nthe other Florentines of his age, \"staked the truth of his inspiration\r\non the recovery of Pisa\"; he had not a grain of sympathy for the Pisans,\r\nand punished those who had;[622] and though his party had the wisdom to\r\nproclaim a general amnesty for Florence (1495), the war against Pisa\r\nwent on, with the French king insensately admitted as a Florentine ally.\r\nSavonarola in his turn fell, on his plain failure to evoke the\r\nmiraculous aid on the wild promise of which he had so desperately\r\ntraded; his party of pietists went to pieces; and the upper-class party\r\nwhich succeeded carried on the war, destroying the Pisan harvests every\r\nyear, till, under the one-man command of Loderini, Florence triumphed\r\n(1507), and the staunch sea-city fell once more. Even now the conquering\r\ncity consented to pay great bribes to the kings of France and Aragon for\r\nleave to take her prey. And once more multitudes of Pisans emigrated,\r\nrefusing to live in subjection, despite all attempts at\r\nconciliation.[623]\r\n\r\nSlowly the monarchic powers closed in; France, after several campaigns,\r\ndecisively defeated and captured Lodovico Sforza, lord of Milan, and\r\nproceeded by a secret treaty with Spain to partition the kingdom of\r\nNaples--a rascals' bargain, which ended in a quarrel and in the\r\ndestruction of two French armies; Spain remaining master of Naples and\r\nthe Sicilies, while France held the Milanese and Liguria, including\r\nGenoa. For a few years Cesare Borgia flared across the Italian sky, only\r\nto fall with his great purposes unfulfilled; and still the foreign\r\npowers encroached. France, with Swiss support, proceeded in turn to make\r\nwar on Venice; and the emperor, the pope, Spain, and the smaller\r\nneighbouring despots, joined in the attack. Against these dastardly odds\r\nthe invincible oligarchy of Venice held out, till Pope Julius, finding\r\nhis barbarian friends worse than his Italian enemies, changed sides,\r\njoined the republic, and after many reverses got together an anti-French\r\nleague of English, Swiss, and Spanish. Finally the emperor betrayed his\r\nFrench allies, who were once more driven out of Italy, leaving their\r\nally, Florence, to fall into the hands of the Spaniards (1512).\r\n\r\nNow came the restoration of the family of Medici, soon followed by the\r\nelevation of Giovanni de' Medici to the Papacy as Leo X; whence came yet\r\nmore wars, enough to paralyse Italy financially had there been no other\r\nimpoverishing cause. But Leo X, now the chief Italian power, misgoverned\r\nin secular affairs as badly as in ecclesiastical; and the wars, so\r\nbarbarous in themselves, were waged upon dwindling resources. Venice,\r\npressed afresh by Maximilian, made alliance with Louis, who was defeated\r\nby the Swiss, as defenders and \"lords\" of Milan; whereupon the Spanish,\r\npapal, and German forces successively ravaged the Venetian territories.\r\nFrancis I zealously renewed the war, grappled with the Swiss in the\r\ndesperate battle of Marignano in such sort as to get them to come to\r\nterms, and compassed the sovereignty of Milan. On the succession of\r\nCharles V to the throne of Spain and the Empire (1519), war between him\r\nand Francis set in systematically, and continued under Adrian and\r\nClement VII as under Leo, both combatants feeding on and plundering\r\nItaly. The defeat of Francis at Pavia (1525) brought no cessation to the\r\ndrain; a new league was formed between France, the Papacy, Venice, and\r\nSforza; and soon, besides the regular armies, a guerilla horde of\r\nGermans on the imperial side, receiving no pay, was living by the\r\nplunder of Lombardy. At length, in 1527, came the sack of Rome by the\r\nimperial forces, Germans and Spanish combining for nine miserable months\r\nto outdo the brutalities and the horrors of all previous conquests,\r\nChristian or heathen. Two years' more fighting \"only added to the\r\ndesolation of Italy, and destroyed alike in all the Italian provinces\r\nthe last remains of prosperity.\"[624] When a fresh German army entered\r\nLombardy, in 1529, there was \"nothing more to pillage.\"[625]\r\n\r\nThe curtain now falls rapidly on every form of \"independence\" in Italy.\r\nPope Clement VII, freed of his barbarian conquerors, sent them against\r\nFlorence, which fell in a fashion not unworthy of its great republican\r\ntradition, after tasting three final years of its ancient and\r\nthrice-forfeited \"freedom.\" With the dying Machiavelli to frame the\r\nordinances of her revived military system, and Michel Angelo to\r\nconstruct her last fortifications, she had in her final effort bound up\r\nwith her name as a republic two of the greatest Italian names of the age\r\nof the Renaissance. Then came the vengeance of the Medicean Pope,\r\nClement VII, the ducal tyranny, and the end of a great period.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged life of the maritime and commercial-aristocratic republics\r\nof Genoa and Venice, interesting as a proof of the defensive powers of\r\ncommunities so placed and so ordered, was no prolongation of Italian\r\ncivilisation, save in so far as a brilliant art survived at Venice till\r\nthe close of the sixteenth century. It is sufficient to note that what\r\nof artistic and intellectual life Venice and Genoa had was dependent\r\nfirst on Venetian contact with Byzantium, and later on the fecundity of\r\nfreer Italy. The mere longer duration of Venice was due as much to her\r\nunique situation as to her system. On the other hand, it seems\r\nsubstantially true that the Venetian oligarchy did rule its subjects,\r\nboth at home and on the mainland, with greater wisdom and fairness than\r\nwas shown by any other Italian power. When Castruccio Castracani drove\r\nnine hundred families out of Lucca in 1310, thus destroying some of its\r\nchief manufactures, Venice gave the silk-weavers among them a politic\r\nencouragement, and so widened her commercial basis.[626] Her rulers, in\r\nshort, had the common sense of men of business, who knew the value of\r\ngoodwill. There is thus an unwarrantable extravagance in the verdict of\r\nthe young Macaulay, that in Venice \"aristocracy had destroyed every seed\r\nof genius and virtue\";[627] and in his outburst: \"God forbid that there\r\nshould ever again exist a powerful and civilised State which, after\r\nexisting through thirteen hundred eventful years, shall not bequeath to\r\nmankind the memory of one great name or one generous action.\" Such\r\nactions are not rife in any history, and in mere civic selfishness of\r\npurpose the rulers of Venice were on a par with most others.[628] As\r\ncitizens, or as a caste, they seem to have been not more but less\r\nself-seeking as against the rest of the community, despite their\r\ndetermined exclusiveness, than the same class in other States.[629]\r\nTheir history does but prove that an astute oligarchy, protectively\r\ngoverning a commercial and industrial State, is not helpful to\r\ncivilisation in the ratio of its power and stability, and that the\r\nhigher political wisdom is not the appanage of any class.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, the whole Italian civilisation of the Middle Ages and\r\nthe Renaissance represents a clear political gain over that of ancient\r\nHellas in that it had transcended slavery, while failing to attain or to\r\naim at the equality and fraternity which alone realise liberty. Despite,\r\ntoo, all the scandals of the Renaissance in general, and of papal Rome\r\nin particular, the life of such a city as Florence was morally quite on\r\na par with that of any northern city.[630] But the later States and\r\ncivilisations which, while so much more fortunate in their political\r\nconditions, are still so far from the moral liberation of their\r\nlabouring masses--these are not entitled to plume themselves on their\r\ncomparative success. \"The petty done\" is still dwarfed by \"the undone\r\nvast.\"\r\n\r\nWhat they and we may truly claim is that in the modern State, freed from\r\nthe primal curse of fratricidal strife between cities and provinces, the\r\ntotality of \"good life,\" no less than of industrial and commercial life,\r\nis far greater than of old, even if signal genius be less common. To\r\ncontrast the Genoa of to-day with the old City-State is to realise how\r\npeace can liberate human effort. The city of Petrarch, Columbus, and\r\nMazzini has no recent citizen of European fame; but since a wealthy son\r\nbequeathed to her his huge fortune (1875), she has become the chief port\r\nof Italy, passing some forty per cent. of the total trade of the\r\ncountry. The fact that half her imports, in weight, consist of coal,\r\ntells of the main economic disadvantage of modern Italy as compared with\r\nthe chief northern countries; but the modern development of industry is\r\nall the more notable. Under a system of general free trade, it might go\r\nmuch further.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that modern Italy is no such intellectual beacon-light\r\namong the nations as she was in the \"old, unhappy, far-off times\"; and\r\nupon this the historical sentimentalist is prone to moralise. But there\r\nis no perceptible reason why the new life, well managed, should not\r\nyield new intellectual glories; and the latterday intellectual\r\nRenaissance of Italy may one day take its place in the historic\r\nretrospect as no less notable than that of the days of strife.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: Burckhardt (as cited, p. 94) agrees with Ranke that, if\r\nItaly had escaped subjugation by the Spaniards, she would have fallen\r\ninto the hands of the Turks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: Burckhardt, p. 82.

But in every aggregate, the force of\r\nattraction tends to generate a correlative repulsion to other\r\naggregates, and--save for the counterplay of class repulsions--the\r\nfundamental instinct of egoism takes new extensions in pride of family,\r\npride of clan, pride of nation, pride of race. Until the successive\r\nextensions have all been rectified by the spirit of reciprocity,\r\npolitics remains so far unmoralised and unrationalised.\r\n\r\nThe nullity of the conception of \"race genius\" has been forced on us at\r\nevery meeting with it. No less clear, on a critical analysis, is the\r\nirrationality of the instinct of racial pride which underlies that\r\nconception, and which is involved in perhaps half of the strifes of\r\ntribes, States, and nations. Yet perhaps most of the reflections made by\r\nhistorical writers in the way of generalisations of the history of\r\nStates and peoples are in terms of the fallacy and the irrationality in\r\nquestion. And the instinctive persistence of both reveals itself when we\r\ncome to reflect on the fortunes of what we usually call the little\r\nnations--employing a term which at once sets up a whole series of\r\npartial hallucinations.\r\n\r\nThe main distinction between civilised nations being difference of\r\nlanguage, there has spontaneously arisen the habit of identifying\r\nlanguage with \"race,\" and regarding a dwindling tongue as implying a\r\ndwindling people. In the British Islands, for instance, the decline in\r\nthe numbers of the people speaking Celtic dialects--the Erse, the Welsh,\r\nand the Gaelic--leads many persons, including some of the speakers of\r\nthose tongues, to regard the \"Celtic stock\" as in course of diminution;\r\nand statesmen speak quasi-scientifically of \"the Celtic fringe\" as\r\nrepresenting certain political tendencies in particular. Yet as soon as\r\nwe substitute the comparatively real test of name-forms for the non-test\r\nof language, we find that the Welsh and Gaelic-speaking stocks have\r\nenormously extended within the English-speaking population, so that\r\n\"Welsh blood\" is very much commoner in Britain than \"Saxon,\" relatively\r\nto the proportions between the areas and populations of Wales and\r\nEngland, while \"Highland blood\" is relatively predominant in\r\n\"Saxon\"-speaking Scotland; and \"Irish blood\" is almost similarly\r\nabundant even in England, to say nothing of its immense multiplication\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for one's nation as such thus begins on scrutiny to resolve\r\nitself into enthusiasm for one's speech; and as our English speech is a\r\nnear variant of certain others held alien, as Dutch and Scandinavian and\r\nGerman, with a decisive control from French, enthusiasm for the\r\nspeech-tie begins, on reflection, to assimilate to the enthusiasm of the\r\ndistrict, the glen, the parish. Millions of us are at a given moment\r\nrapturous about the deeds of our non-ancestors, on the supposition that\r\nthey were our ancestors, and in terms of a correlative aversion to the\r\ndeeds of certain other ancients loosely supposed to have been the\r\nancestors of certain of our contemporaries. Thus the ostensible entity\r\nwhich plays so large a part in the common run of thought about\r\nhistory--the nation, considered as a continuous and personalised\r\norganism--is in large measure a metaphysical dream, and the emotion\r\nspent on it partakes much of the nature of superstition.\r\n\r\nHow hard it is for anyone trained in such emotion to transcend it is\r\nseen from the form taken by the sympathy which is bestowed by\r\nconsiderate members of a large community on members of a small one.\r\n\"Gallant little Wales\" is a phrase in English currency; and a\r\ncontemporary poet, who had actually written pertinently and well in\r\nprose on the spurious conception of greatness attached to membership in\r\na large population, has also written in verse a plea for \"little\r\npeoples\" in terms of the assumption of an entity conscious of relative\r\nsmallness. Some of these more sympathetic pictures of the lesser States\r\nobscurely recall the anecdote of the little girl who, contemplating a\r\npicture of martyrs thrown to the lions, sorrowed for the \"poor lion who\r\nhadn't any Christian.\" The late Sir John Seeley, on the other hand,\r\nwrote in the more normal Anglo-Saxon manner that \"some countries, such\r\nas Holland and Sweden, might pardonably (_sic_) regard their history as\r\nin a manner wound up; ... the only practical lesson of their history is\r\na lesson of resignation.\"[631] The unit in a population of three\r\nmillions is implicitly credited with the consciousness of a dwarf or a\r\ncripple facing a gigantic rival when he thinks of the existence of a\r\ncommunity of thirty or sixty millions. Happily, the unit of the smaller\r\ncommunity has no such consciousness;[632] and, inasmuch as his state is\r\nthus intellectually the more gracious, there appears to be some solid\r\npsychological basis for the paradox, lately broached by such a one, that\r\n\"the future lies with the small nations.\" That is to say, it seems\r\nlikely that a higher level of general rationality will be attained in\r\nthe small than in the large populations, in virtue of their escaping one\r\nof the most childish and most fostered hallucinations current in the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nCertain patriots of the wilful sort are wont to flout reason in these\r\nmatters, blustering of \"false cosmopolitanism\" and \"salutary prejudice.\"\r\nTo all such rhetoric the fitting answer is the characterisation of it as\r\nfalse passion. Those who indulge in it elect wilfully to enfranchise\r\nfrom the mass of detected and convicted animal passions one which\r\nspecially chimes with their sentiment, as if every other might not be\r\nallowed loose with as good reason. Matters are truly bad enough without\r\nsuch perverse endorsement of vulgar ideals by those who can see their\r\nvulgarity. Ordinary observation makes us aware that the most commonplace\r\nand contracted minds are most prone to the passion of national and\r\nracial pride; whereas the men of antiquity who first seem to have\r\ntranscended it are thereby marked out once for all as a higher breed. It\r\nis in fact the proof of incapacity for any large or deep view of human\r\nlife to be habitually and zealously \"patriotic\" in the popular sense of\r\nthe term. Yet, in the civilisations which to-day pass for being most\r\nadvanced, the majority of the units habitually batten on that quality of\r\nfeeling, millions of adults for ever living the political life of the\r\nschoolboy; and, as no polity can long transcend the ideals of the great\r\nmass, national fortunes and institutions thus far tend to be determined\r\nby the habit of the lower minds.\r\n\r\nIt is pure paralogism to point to the case of a large backward\r\npopulation without a national-flag idea--for instance, the\r\nChinese[633]--as showing that want of patriotic passion goes with\r\nbackwardness in culture. There is an infinity of the raw material of\r\npatriotism among precisely the most primitive of the Chinese population,\r\nwhose hatred of \"foreign devils\" is the very warp of \"imperialism.\" The\r\nideal of cosmopolitanism is at the other end of the psychological scale\r\nfrom that of the ignorance which has gone through no political evolution\r\nwhatever; its very appearance implies past patriotism as a\r\nstepping-stone; and its ethic is to that of patriotism what civil law is\r\nto club law. If \"salutary prejudice\" is to be the shibboleth of future\r\ncivilisation, the due upshot will be the attainment of it one day by the\r\nnow semi-civilised races, and the drowning out of European patriotisms\r\nby Mongolian.\r\n\r\nIf a saner lesson is to be widely learned, one way to it, if not the\r\nbest way, may be an effort on the part of the units of the \"great\r\nnations\" to realise the significance of the fortunes of the \"little\r\nnations,\" in terms, not of the imagined consciousness of metaphysical\r\nentities, but of actual human conditions--material, passional, and\r\nintellectual. We have seen how erudite specialists can express\r\nthemselves in terms of the fallacy of racial genius. Specialists perhaps\r\nas erudite, and certainly multitudes of educated people, seem capable of\r\nthinking as positively in terms of the hallucinations of racial entity,\r\nnational consciousness, political greatness, national revenue, and\r\nimperial success. Thus we have publicists speaking of Holland as an\r\n\"effete nation,\" of Belgium as \"doomed to absorption,\" of the\r\nScandinavian peoples as \"having failed in the race,\" and of Switzerland\r\nas \"impotent\"; even as they call Spain \"dying\" and Turkey \"decomposing.\"\r\n\r\nNearly every one of those nations, strictly speaking, has a fairer\r\nchance of ultimate continuance without decline of wealth and power than\r\nEngland, whose units in general show as little eye for the laws of\r\ndecline as Romans did in the days of Augustus. Spain has large\r\npotentialities of rich agricultural life; Turkey needs only new habits\r\nto develop her natural resources; the life of Belgium, indeed, is, like\r\nthat of England, in part founded on exhaustible minerals; but\r\nSwitzerland and Scandinavia, with their restrained populations, may\r\ncontinue to maintain, as they do, a rather higher _average_ of decent\r\nlife and popular culture than that of the British Islands,[634] though\r\nthey, too, have at all times a social problem to deal with. British\r\ngreatness, on dissection, consists in the aggregation of much greater\r\nmasses of wealth and much greater masses of poverty, larger groups of\r\nidlers and larger swarms of degenerates, with much greater maritime\r\npower, than are to be seen in the little nations; certainly not in a\r\nhigher average of manhood and intelligence and well-being. Sir John\r\nSeeley, in a moment of misgiving, avowed that \"bigness is not\r\nnecessarily greatness\"; adding, \"if by remaining in the second rank of\r\nmagnitude we can hold the front rank morally and intellectually, let us\r\nsacrifice mere material magnitude.\"[635] But he had before used the term\r\n\"greatness\" without reserve as equivalent to \"mere material magnitude\";\r\nand even in revising his doctrine, it seems, he must needs crave some\r\nsort of supremacy, some sense of the inferiority of the mass of mankind.\r\nWithout any such constant reversion to the instinct of racial pride, let\r\nus say that \"the things that are most excellent\" have no dependence on\r\nmere material magnitude. Given a saner and juster distribution of wealth\r\nand culture-machinery, each one of the smaller States may be more\r\ncivilised, more worth living in, than the larger, even as Athens was\r\nbetter worth living in than Rome, and Goethe's Weimar than the Berlin of\r\n1800. It was a poet of one of the larger nations--though it had to be a\r\npoet--who saw not hardship but happiness in the thought of \"leaving\r\ngreat verse unto a little clan.\" And it was a Christian bishop, looking\r\non the break-up of a great empire, who asked, _An congruat bonis latius\r\nvelle regnare?_--Doth it beseem the good to seek to widen their\r\nrule?--and gave the judgment that if human things had gone in the\r\nhappier way of righteousness, all States had remained small, happy in\r\npeaceful neighbourhood.[636]\r\n\r\nAs for the sentiment of a national greatness that is measured by acreage\r\nand census and quantity of war material, it is hard to distinguish\r\nethically between it and that individual pride in lands and wealth which\r\nall men save those who cherish it are agreed to pronounce odious. Even\r\nthe snobs of nationality have, as a rule, a saving sense which withholds\r\nthem from flaunting their pride in the eyes of their \"poorer\"\r\nneighbours, the members of the less numerous communities. Yet the note\r\nwhich is thus tacitly admitted to be vulgarly jarring for alien ears is\r\nhabitually struck for domestic satisfaction; few newspapers let many\r\ndays pass without sounding it; and certain poets and writers of verse\r\nappear to find their chief joy in its vibrations. The men of some of the\r\nlesser States, then, stand a fair chance of becoming ethically and\r\naesthetically, as well as intellectually, superior in the average to\r\nthose of the larger aggregates, in that their moral codes are not\r\nvitiated nor their literary taste vulgarised by national purse-pride and\r\nthe vertigo of the higher dunghill; though they, too, have their snares\r\nof \"patriotism,\" with its false ideals and its vitiation of true\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nTo some degree, no doubt, the habit of mind of our megalophiles connects\r\nwith the vague but common surmise that a small aggregate is more liable\r\nto unscrupulous aggression than a large one. If, however, there be any\r\njustice in that surmise, there is obviously implied a known disposition\r\nin the larger aggregates to commit such aggression; so that to act or\r\nrest upon it is simply to prefer being the wronger to being the wronged.\r\nThus to glory in being rather on the side of the bully than on the side\r\nof the bullied is only to give one more proof of the unworthiness of the\r\ninstinct at work. All the while, there is no real ground for the hope;\r\nand as regards the small nations themselves, the apprehension does not\r\nappear to prevail. There has indeed been a recrudescence of the barbaric\r\nethic of the Napoleonic period in the Bismarckian period; but there is\r\nno present sign of a serious fear of national suppression on the part of\r\nHolland, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, and the Scandinavian States;\r\nwhile, apart from Bismarck's early aggression upon Denmark, and the\r\nill-fortune of Greece in attacking Turkey, it is not small but large\r\naggregates--to wit, Austria, France, Russia, Turkey, Spain--that have\r\nsuffered any degree of military humiliation during the past half\r\ncentury; and it is precisely the large aggregates that avowedly live in\r\nthe most constant apprehension either of being outnumbered in their\r\narmies and navies by single rivals or coalitions, or of losing their\r\n\"prestige\" by some failure to punish a supposed slight. It is a matter\r\nof historic fact that the \"patriotic\" consciousness in England had its\r\nwithers wrung during a long series of years by the remembrance of such\r\nmilitary disasters as the fall of Gordon at Khartoum, and the defeat of\r\nan incompetent general at Majuba Hill.[637] No \"little nation\" could\r\nexhibit a more wincing sense of humiliation and disgrace than is thus\r\nvisibly felt by multitudes of a great aggregate over military repulses\r\nat the hands of extremely small and primitive groups. Politically\r\nspeaking, then, the future of the small nations seems rather brighter\r\nthan that of the large; and thus in the last analysis the pride of the\r\nunit of the latter is found to be still a folly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: _The Expansion of England_, 1883, p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: This though it be true, as remarked by Sismondi\r\n(_Histoire des republiques italiennes_, ed. 1826, i, 100, 101), that all\r\nnations spontaneously desire to be large and powerful, in disregard of\r\nall experience.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: This, it need hardly be repeated, was written before\r\n1900.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: Compare the remarks of Freeman, _History of Federal\r\nGovernment_, 2nd ed. p. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: _Expansion of England_, p. 16.

Taken as it emerges from the\r\nstage of myth, about the time of Charlemagne, it presents a vivid phase\r\nof barbarism, acted on by powerful conditions of change. The three\r\nsections of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden stand in a certain natural\r\ngradation as regards their possibilities of political development. All\r\nalike were capable only of a secondary or tertiary civilisation, being\r\nat once geographically disrupted and incapable, on primitive methods, of\r\nfeeding an abundant population. In their early piratical stage, the\r\nScandinavians are not greatly different from the pre-Homeric Greeks as\r\nthese were conceived by Thucydides; but whereas the Greeks came in\r\ncontact with the relatively high civilisations which had preceded them,\r\nthe Scandinavians of the Dark Ages had no contacts save with the\r\nprimitive life of the pre-Christian Slavs, the premature and arrested\r\ncross-civilisations of Carlovingian France and Anglo-Saxon England, and,\r\nin a fuller and more fruitful degree, with the similarly arrested\r\nsemi-Christian civilisation of Celtic Ireland, which latter counted for\r\nso much in their literature.\r\n\r\nBut in barbarian conditions certain main laws of social evolution\r\noperate no less clearly than in later stages; and we see sections of the\r\nNorsemen passing from tribal anarchy to primitive monarchy, and thence\r\nto military \"empire,\" afterwards returning to their stable economic\r\nbasis, as every military empire sooner or later must. Of the\r\nScandinavian sections, Denmark and the southern parts of Sweden (round\r\nthe Maelar) are the least disrupted and most fertile; and these were\r\nrespectively the most readily reducible to a single rule. In all, given\r\nto begin with the primordial bias to royalism in any of its forms,[639]\r\nthe establishment of a supreme and hereditary military rule was only a\r\nquestion of time; every successive attempt, however undone by the forces\r\nof barbaric independence, being a lead and stimulus to others. It is\r\nimportant to note how the process was promoted by, and in its turn\r\npromoted, the establishment of Christianity. The incomplex phenomena in\r\nScandinavia throw a new light on the more complex evolution of other\r\nparts of Christendom. Primitive polytheism is obviously unpropitious to\r\nmonarchic rule; and in every ancient religion it can be seen to have\r\nundergone adaptations where such rule arose. In the widely varying\r\nsystems of Homeric Greece, Babylonia, Egypt, and Rome, the same tendency\r\nis visibly at work in different degrees, the ascendent principle of\r\nearthly government being more or less directly duplicated in theological\r\ntheory. Under the Roman Empire, all cults were in a measure bent to the\r\nimperial service, and it was only the primary exclusiveness of\r\nChristianity that put it in conflict with the State. Once the emperor\r\naccepted it, recognising its political use, and conceded its exclusive\r\nclaims, it became a trebly effective political instrument,[640]\r\ncentralising as it did the whole machinery of religion throughout the\r\nEmpire, and co-ordinating all to the political system. To use a modern\r\nillustration, it \"syndicated\" the multifold irregular activities of\r\nworship, and was thus the ideal system for a centralised and imperial\r\nState.[641] This was as readily seen by Theodoric and Charlemagne as by\r\nthe rulers at Constantinople; and to such a perception, broadly\r\nspeaking, is to be attributed the forcing of Christianity on the\r\nnorthern races by their kings.\r\n\r\n     Compare the explicit admissions of Mosheim, _Eccles. Hist._ 8\r\n     cent., pt. ii, ch. ii, Sec. 5 and note, following on the testimony of\r\n     William of Malmesbury as to Charlemagne. Other ecclesiastical\r\n     historians coincide. \"Numbers of the earliest and most active\r\n     converts, both in Germany and England, were connected with the\r\n     royal households; and in this way it would naturally occur that\r\n     measures which related to the organising of the Church would\r\n     emanate directly from the King.... It is indeed remarkable that so\r\n     long as kings were esteemed the real patrons of the Church, she\r\n     felt no wish to define exactly her relations to the civil power;\r\n     the two authorities ... _laboured to enforce obedience to each\r\n     other_\" (Hardwick, _Church History: Middle Age_, 1853, pp. 56-57).\r\n     The same historian (p. 127) describes the Wends of the eleventh\r\n     century as seeing in the missionary a means for their subjection to\r\n     Germany, and as \"constantly attempting to regain their independence\r\n     and extinguish the few glimmerings of truth that had been forced\r\n     into their minds.\"\r\n\r\nNorthern paganism, more than the semi-cosmopolitan polytheism of the\r\nsouth in the period of Augustus, was a local and domestic faith, lending\r\nitself to separateness and independence, as did the civic and family\r\nreligions of early Greece and Rome. While there were communal assemblies\r\nwith specially solemn sacrifices, the popular beliefs were such that\r\nevery district could have its holy places, and every family or group its\r\nspecial rites;[642] and in primitive Scandinavia a priesthood could\r\nstill less develop than even in primitive Germany, whose lack of any\r\nsystem corresponding to the Druidism of Gaul is still empirically\r\nascribed to some anti-sacerdotal element in the \"national character,\"\r\nwhereas it is plainly a result of the nomadic life-conditions of the\r\nscattered people. In germ the Teutonic priesthood was extremely\r\npowerful, being the judiciary power from which there was no appeal.[643]\r\nBut an organised priestly system can arise only on the basis of some\r\nmeasure of political levelling or centralisation, involving some\r\npeaceful inter-communication. Romanised Christianity, coming ready-made\r\nfrom its centre, permitted of no worship save that of the consecrated\r\nchurch, and no ministry save that of the ordained priest.[644] Only the\r\nmost obstinately conservative kings or chieftains, therefore, could fail\r\nto see their immediate advantage in adopting it.[645]\r\n\r\n     Naturally the early Christian records gloss the facts. Thus it is\r\n     told in the life of Anskar (Ancharius) that \"the Swedes\" sent\r\n     messengers to the Emperor Ludovic the Pious (_circa_ 825) telling\r\n     that \"many\" of them \"longed to embrace the Christian faith\"--a\r\n     story for which the only possible basis would be the longings and\r\n     perhaps the propaganda of Christian captives of some western\r\n     European nationality. (Cp. Hardwick, _Church History: Middle Age_,\r\n     1853, p. 110, _notes_, and p. 111.) Still it is admitted that the\r\n     king was avowedly willing to listen; and the tale of the first\r\n     acceptance of Christianity in Sweden, even if true in detail, would\r\n     plainly point to a carefully rehearsed plan under the king's\r\n     supervision. The admission that afterwards there was a return to\r\n     heathenism for nearly a century consists entirely with the view\r\n     that the first tentative was one of kingly policy. See Geijer, c.\r\n     iii, pp. 34, 35. It was the people who drove out the missionaries;\r\n     and Hardwick's statement that after seven years Anskar \"was able to\r\n     regain his hold on the affections of the Swedes\" is confuted by his\r\n     own narrative. All that Anskar obtained was a toleration of his\r\n     mission; and this was given after a trial by lots, on heathen\r\n     principles (Hardwick, pp. 112, 113; cp. p. 115). The account in\r\n     Crichton and Wheaton's _Scandinavia_, 1837, i, 122, brings the\r\n     king's initiative into prominence. (Cp. Otte, _Scandinavian\r\n     History_, 1874, p. 34.) They also note that Charlemagne, in\r\n     treating with the Danes, \"did not attempt to impose his religion\"\r\n     upon them; but they do not glimpse the true explanation, which is\r\n     that he could gain nothing by helping to organise a hostile\r\n     kingdom. In point of fact he refused to let Lindger pursue his\r\n     purpose of converting the Northmen. (Hardwick, p. 108, _note 2_,\r\n     citing _Vit. S. Lindger_.) He had not developed the devotion or the\r\n     subservience to the Church which in later ages led emperors to\r\n     force the acceptance of Christianity on a defeated State that\r\n     remained otherwise independent.\r\n\r\n     When in a later age Christianity was definitely established in\r\n     Sweden under Olaf the Lap (or Tribute) King (_circa_ 1000), whose\r\n     father Erik is said to have been murdered in a tumult for his\r\n     destruction of a pagan temple, the process was again strictly\r\n     monarchic, the Diet resisting; but Olaf's substantial success was\r\n     such as to permit of his annexing Gothland, temporarily conquering\r\n     Norway, and styling himself king of all Sweden; and his son, Anund\r\n     Jakob, continuing the profitable policy, earned the title of Most\r\n     Christian Majesty (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 111; Geijer, p. 39).\r\n     Even after this the attempt of a bishop (1067) to destroy the old\r\n     temple at Upsala, resisted by the Christian King Stenkil, but\r\n     supported by his rasher son Inge, caused the expulsion of the\r\n     latter by the pagan party under Svend. Only after Inge's\r\n     restoration by Danish help (1075) was the heathen worship\r\n     suppressed (Hardwick, p. 116).\r\n\r\n     As regards Denmark, the historians incidentally make it clear that\r\n     Harald Klak, usurping king of Jutland (_circa_ 820), wanted to\r\n     Christianise his turbulent subjects in order to subordinate them,\r\n     having learned the wisdom of the policy from Louis the Pious; and\r\n     it is no less clear that the same motive swayed Erik I, who, after\r\n     having in his days of piratical adventure, as usurper of the Jute\r\n     crown, destroyed the Christian settlement of Charlemagne at\r\n     Hamburg, entirely changed his attitude and favoured Christianity\r\n     when, on the death of King Horda-Knut, he became king of all\r\n     Denmark (Crichton and Wheaton, pp. 120-23).\r\n\r\nSo plain was the political tendency of the new creed that after the\r\nChristianisation of Denmark by Erik I the nobility forced Erik II to\r\nrestore the pagan system; but the triumph of the Church, like that of\r\nmonarchy, was only a question of time. Even kings who, being caught late\r\nin life, did not renounce their paganism, are found ready to favour the\r\nmissionaries; and in Denmark such tolerance on the part of Gorm the Old\r\n(d. 941), successor of Erik II, is followed by the official Christianity\r\nof his son Harald Bluetooth. Danish \"empire\" duly follows; and in the\r\nnext century we find Knut the Great (1014-1035) utterly reversing[646]\r\nthe pagan policy of his father, Svend[647] (who had been enabled to\r\ndethrone _his_ Christian father, Harald, by the pagan malcontents), and\r\ndying in the odour of sanctity, \"lord\" of six kingdoms--Denmark, Sweden,\r\nNorway, England, Scotland, and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe principle is established from another side in the case of Norway.\r\nThere the first notable monarchic unification had been wrought by the\r\npagan Harold Fairhair (875), without the aid of Christianity; and the\r\npagan resistance was so irreducible that revolters sailed off in all\r\ndirections, finding footing in Scotland and Ireland, and in particular\r\nin Northern France and Iceland.[648] In the next generation the monarchy\r\nrelapsed to the old position; and Harold's Christian son Hakon (educated\r\nin England) had to cede to the determined demands of the pagan majority,\r\nwho forced him to join in the old heathen rites, and murdered the\r\nleading Christians;[649] a course followed by the further weakening of\r\nthe power of the crown. The Danish Harald Bluetooth, son of Gorm, who\r\nthen conquered Norway, sought to re-establish the Church by the sword;\r\nbut Hakon Jarl, who followed, gave up Christianity in order to reign\r\nand again put it down by violence.[650] The next king to restore it,\r\nOlaf Tryggvason, who had met with Christianity in his wanderings in\r\nGreece, Russia, England, and Germany,[651] established that creed by\r\nbrute force when he attained the throne (977), and again the spirit of\r\nlocal independence, abnormally conserved in Norway by the special\r\nseparateness set up by the geographical conditions, fiercely resisted\r\nthe new system as it had done the rule of Harold Fairhair, many defeated\r\npagans withdrawing to remote glens and fastnesses, where to this day\r\ntheir mythology thrives.[652] On Olaf's final defeat and death (1000),\r\nhis immediate successors, jarls supported by Denmark and Sweden, were\r\ncontent to leave paganism alone, as representing a too dangerous spirit\r\nof independence; and when St. Olaf, in turn, again undertook to crush\r\nit, he found he had but beaten down and alienated the forces that would\r\nhave enabled him to resist Knut.[653] Danish \"imperialism\" had been\r\nevolved while the Norwegian kings were striving towards it; and St. Olaf\r\nwas exiled, defeated, and slain (1030). His subsequent popularity is a\r\nmere posthumous Church-made cult of the Christian period.\r\n\r\n     The spread of Christianity among the Franks; in England; in Saxony\r\n     by Charlemagne; in North Germany later; and among the Wends, Poles,\r\n     Hungarians, and Bohemians, constantly exhibits the same phenomena.\r\n     Always it is the duke or king who is \"converted\"; whereupon the\r\n     people are either baptised in mass or dragooned for generations. A\r\n     powerful king like Clovis could secure obedience; others, as in\r\n     Scandinavia, Bohemia, and Wendland, lost life and kingdom in the\r\n     attempt to crush at once paganism and local independence. Prussia\r\n     was almost depopulated by sixty years of war before the Order of\r\n     Teutonic Knights, who undertook to convert it on being awarded the\r\n     territory, could extinguish by savagery its staunch paganism. The\r\n     Christianisation of almost the whole of Northern Europe was thus a\r\n     purely political process, accomplished in great part by the sword.\r\n     See Hardwick, _passim_, and cp. the author's _Short History of\r\n     Christianity_, pp. 211-16.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThe ultimate arrest of all aggression by the Scandinavian peoples is to\r\nbe explained as a simple redressing of the balance between them and the\r\nStates they had formerly plundered. To begin with, all the Scandinavian\r\ngroups alike practised piracy[654] as against the more civilised States\r\nof Northern Europe; and piracy showed them the way to conquest and\r\ncolonisation. At home their means of subsistence were pasturage,\r\nfishing, the chase, and an agriculture which cannot have been easily\r\nextensible beyond the most fertile soils; hence a constant pressure of\r\npopulation, promoting piracy and aggressive emigration. How the pressure\r\nwas purposively met is not clear; but as the Scandinavian father, like\r\nthe Greek and Roman, was free either to expose or bring up a new-born\r\nchild,[655] there is a presumption that at some periods exposure was not\r\nuncommon.[656] There is even testimony, going back to the eighth century\r\nand recurring frequently as late as the twelfth, to the effect that a\r\ncertain number of men were periodically sent away by lot when the mouths\r\nhad visibly multiplied beyond the meat.\r\n\r\n     See, for instance, the _Roman de Rou_ (1160), ed. Andresen,\r\n     1877-79, i, 18, 19, verses 208-25 of prologue. Pluquet, in a note\r\n     on the passage in his edition (1827, i, 10), remarking that the\r\n     usage is often mentioned, not only by Norman but by English and\r\n     French annalists of the Middle Ages, adds that the oldest mention\r\n     of all, in the _Tractatus_ of Abbot Odo (d. 942), must be rejected,\r\n     the document being apocryphal. That, however, is not the oldest\r\n     mention by a long way. Paulus Diaconus (740-99) gives the statement\r\n     in a very circumstantial form (cited by Rydberg, _Teutonic\r\n     Mythology_, Eng. tr. p. 68) in his history of the Longobardians,\r\n     his own stock, who he says came from Scandinavia. He testifies that\r\n     he had actually talked with persons who had been in\r\n     Scandinavia--his descriptions pointing to Scania. M. Pluquet notes\r\n     (so also Crichton and Wheaton, i, 166-67) that no northern saga\r\n     mentions the usage in question. But it was likely to be\r\n     commemorated only by the stocks forced in that fashion to emigrate.\r\n     The saga-making Icelanders were not among these. The old statement,\r\n     finally, is in some measure corroborated by the testimony of\r\n     Geijer, p. 84, as to the long subsistence of the Swedish practice\r\n     of sending forth sons to seek their fortune by sea.\r\n\r\nBut without any such organised exodus there were adventurers\r\nenough.[657] Hence colonisations and conquests in Scotland, the\r\nHebrides, Ireland, Iceland, Russia, England, and remote plundering\r\nexpeditions by land and river, some getting as far south as Italy; one\r\nconquering expedition passing from Gaul through Arab Spain (827) and\r\nalong the Mediterranean coasts, north and south; another passing through\r\nRussia to Constantinople. Thus the Norwegian and Danish stocks must have\r\nrooted in nearly every part of the British Islands; and the settlement\r\nin Gaul of a colony of revolters from Norway, in the reign of Harold\r\nFairhair, built up one of the great provinces of France. Only in Iceland\r\ndid the colonists preserve their language; hence, in terms of the\r\nhallucination of race, the assumption that the others \"failed,\" when in\r\nreality they helped to constitute new races; no more \"failing\" in these\r\ncases than did the British stock in its North American colonies. It may\r\nbe said, indeed, that the Teutonic stocks which overran Italy, Spain,\r\nand North Africa did in large part physically disappear thence, their\r\nphysiological type having failed to survive as against the southern\r\ntypes. Even on that view, however, the impermanent type must in some\r\ndegree have affected that which survived. In any case, the amalgamated\r\nNorse stock in Normandy, grown French-speaking, in turn overran England\r\nand part of Italy and Sicily, and, in the Crusades, formed new kingdoms\r\nin the East; while in the case of England, turning English-speaking,\r\nthey again modified the stock of the nation. As against the notion that\r\nin this case there was \"failure\" either for French or for Normans, we\r\nmight almost adopt the _mot_ of M. Clemenceau and call England \"a French\r\ncolony gone wrong.\"[658] In terms of realities there has been no racial\r\ndecease; it is but names and languages that have changed with the\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBut there was an arrest of military exodus from Scandinavia; and\r\nthenceforward the Norse-speaking stocks figure as more or less small and\r\nretiring communities. They gave up piracy and conquest only because they\r\nhad to, Danish imperialism causing the arrest on a wide scale, as every\r\nmonarchic unification had done on a small.[659] When Knut reigned over\r\nsix kingdoms, piracy was necessarily checked as among these; and when\r\nKnut's empire broke up after his death through the repulsive powers of\r\nits component parts and the relative lack of resources in Denmark, the\r\nvarious States of north-western Europe, in the terms of the case, were\r\nmore able than before to resist Norse attacks in general. In England,\r\nWilliam the Conqueror was fain to keep them off by bribery and intrigue;\r\nbut the States with the greater natural resources grew in strength,\r\nwhile those of Scandinavia could not. When the pirates began to get the\r\nworst of it, and when the Scandinavian kings had cause to dread\r\nreprisals from those of the west, piracy began to dwindle. The last\r\nregular practitioners were the pagan Wends, and the republican pagans of\r\nthe city of Jomsborg, who plundered the Scandinavians as they had of\r\nyore plundered others; and after the Christianised Danish people had for\r\na time defended themselves by voluntary associations, both sets of\r\npirates were overthrown by an energetic Danish king. The suppression was\r\nunder Christian auspices; but it is a conventional fallacy to attribute\r\nit to the influence of Christianity. It was simply an act of necessary\r\nprogressive polity, like the suppression of the Cilician pirates by\r\nPompeius.\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Crichton and Wheaton make the regulation statement that\r\n     when Christianity was introduced into Scandinavia, \"it corrected\r\n     the abuses of an ill-regulated freedom; it banished vindictive\r\n     quarrels and bloody dissensions; it put a restraint upon robberies\r\n     and piracies; it humanised the public laws and softened the\r\n     ferocity of public manners; it emancipated the peasantry from a\r\n     miserable servitude, restored to them their natural rights, and\r\n     created a relish for the blessings of peace and the comforts of\r\n     life\" (_Scandinavia_, i, 196). For the general and decisive\r\n     disproof of these assertions it is necessary only to follow Messrs.\r\n     Crichton and Wheaton's own narrative, pp. 201, 213, 216, 219, 230,\r\n     240, 244, 247, 275, 278, 280, 308, 312, 322, etc., and note their\r\n     contrary generalisation at pp. 324, 325. It was his \"Most Christian\r\n     Majesty\" Anund Jakob who got the nickname of Coal-burner for his\r\n     law that the houses and effects of malefactors should be burned to\r\n     the value of the harm they had done. The Swedes, polygamous before\r\n     Christianity, continued to be so for generations as Christians\r\n     (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 197, 198, citing Adam of Bremen. Cp.\r\n     Grimm, _Geschichte der deutschen Sprache_, i, 18, 188.) Civil wars\r\n     and ferocious feuds greatly multiplied in the early Christian\r\n     period, apart altogether from pagan insurrections. Geijer, while\r\n     erroneously attributing to Christianity the lessening of war\r\n     between Scandinavia and the rest of the world, admits that the\r\n     passions of strife, \"hitherto turned in an external direction, now\r\n     spent themselves in a domestic field of action, generating civil\r\n     discord and war. Christianity, besides, dissolved the effective\r\n     bond of the old social institutions\" (p. 40). In that case it\r\n     clearly cannot have been religious feeling that checked external\r\n     war. As to piracy, that was later practised by Elizabethan\r\n     Protestants and by the Huguenots of La Rochelle, when the\r\n     opportunities were tempting. As to popular misery, it is told in\r\n     the life of Anskar that the poor in ancient Sweden wore so few that\r\n     the first Christians could find a use for their alms only in\r\n     foreign countries (Geijer, p. 33). That difficulty has not\r\n     prevailed since. Messrs. Crichton and Wheaton later admit that the\r\n     Danish peasantry, free as pagans, \"gradually sunk under the\r\n     increasing power and influence of the feudal chiefs and the Romish\r\n     hierarchy\" (p. 227), and that the Crusades did not forward the\r\n     emancipation of the serfs in Denmark as elsewhere, the peasantry on\r\n     the contrary sinking into \"a state of hopeless bondage\" (pp. 251,\r\n     252).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nFrom the period of arrest of aggression, the economic and political\r\nhistory of the Scandinavian States is that of slightly expansible\r\ncommunities with comparatively small resources; and their high status\r\nto-day is the illustration of what civilisation may come to under such\r\nconditions. In the feudal period they made small material or\r\nintellectual progress. It is not probable that the Norse population was\r\never greater than in the eighteenth century, though Malthus had a\r\nsurmise that it might anciently have been so:[660] the old belief that\r\nScandinavia was the great _officina gentium_, the nursery of the races\r\nwhich overran the Roman Empire, is a delusion; but it is certain that\r\nthe increase since the twelfth century has been even slower than the\r\nEuropean average. In the absence of emigration, this meant for past\r\ncenturies constant restraint of marriage through lack of houses and\r\nlivelihoods--the preventive check in its most stringent form. Emigration\r\nthere must have been; but the check must also have been strong. Thus,\r\nwhile the lot of the common people, in so far as it remained free, was\r\nlikely to be comparatively comfortable, the land-owning classes, in the\r\nabsence of industry and commerce, tended to become nearly all-powerful;\r\nand the Church, which inherits and does not squander, would engross most\r\nof the power if not specially checked. The conditions were thus as\r\nunfavourable to intellectual as to material progress.\r\n\r\nDenmark was the first of the Scandinavian States to develop a\r\nconsiderable commerce, beginning as did Holland on the footing of the\r\nfishery;[661] and on that basis there was a certain renewal of Danish\r\nempire. But this again could not hold out against the neighbouring\r\nforces; and in the thirteenth century, the herring fishery in the\r\nBaltic failing, it had to yield its hold on the mainland cities of\r\nHamburg and Luebeck, which began a new career of commercial power as the\r\nnucleus of the great trading federation of the Hansa cities, while\r\nDenmark itself was riven by the struggles of six claimants of the\r\nthrone. The result was a \"feudal and sacerdotal oligarchy,\"[662] leading\r\nto an era of \"the complete triumph of the Romish clergy over the\r\ntemporal power in Denmark,\" in which the peasantry were reduced to\r\nabsolute predial slavery.[663] Similar evolution took place in\r\nNorway,[664] though with less depression of the peasantry,[665] by\r\nreason of the small scope there for capitalistic agriculture; and there\r\ntoo the now nascent commerce was appropriated by the Hansa.[666] In\r\nSweden, where industry remained so primitive that down till the\r\nsixteenth century there was hardly any attempt to work up the native\r\niron,[667] Germans greatly predominated in the cities and controlled\r\ntrade,[668] even before the accession of Albert of Mecklenburg (1363),\r\nwho further depressed the native nobility in the German interest.[669]\r\nOn the other hand, the clergy were less plenipotent than in the sister\r\nkingdoms, the people having retained more of their old power.\r\n\r\n     Cp. Schweitzer, _Geschichte der skandinavischen Literatur_, i, 129.\r\n     The Swedish peasantry, like the Norwegian, were less easy to\r\n     enslave than the Danish by reason of the natural conditions; those\r\n     of the remote mountain and mining districts in particular retaining\r\n     their independence (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 375, 376; Geijer, pp.\r\n     50, 81, 89, 97, 103), so that they ultimately enabled Gustavus Vasa\r\n     to throw off the Danish yoke. Yet they had at first refused to\r\n     recognise him, being satisfied with their own liberties; and\r\n     afterwards they gave him much serious trouble (Otte, _Scandinavian\r\n     History_, 1874, pp. 228, 235; Geijer, pp. 109, 112, 115, 116, 118,\r\n     120-24). Slavery, too, was definitely abolished in Sweden as early\r\n     as 1335 (Geijer, pp. 57, 86; Crichton and Wheaton, i, 316, 333). As\r\n     regards the regal power, the once dominant theory that the Swedish\r\n     kings in the thirteenth century obtained a grant of all the mines,\r\n     and of the province of the four great lakes (Crichton and Wheaton,\r\n     i, 332), appears to be an entire delusion (Geijer, pp. 51, 52).\r\n     Such claims were first enforced by Gustavus Vasa (_id._ p. 129). As\r\n     regards the clergy, they appear from the first, _qua_ churchmen, to\r\n     have been kept in check by the nobles, who kept the great Church\r\n     offices largely in the hands of their own order (Geijer, p. 109),\r\n     though Magnus Ladulas strove to strengthen the Church in his own\r\n     interest (_id._ pp. 52-53). Thus the nobles became specially\r\n     powerful (_id._ pp. 50, 56, 108); and when in the fifteenth century\r\n     Sweden was subject to Denmark, they specially resented the\r\n     sacerdotal tyranny (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 356).\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, as in the other Scandinavian States, however, physical strife\r\nand mental stagnation were the ruling conditions. Down till the\r\nsixteenth century her history is pronounced \"a wretched detail of civil\r\nwars, insurrections, and revolutions, arising principally from the\r\njealousies subsisting between the kings and the people, the one striving\r\nto augment their power, the other to maintain their independence.\"[670]\r\nThe same may be said of the sister kingdoms, all alike being torn and\r\ndrained by innumerable strifes of faction and wars with each other. The\r\noccasional forcible and dynastic unions of crowns came to nothing; and\r\nthe Union of Calmar (1397), an attempt to confederate the three kingdoms\r\nunder one crown, repeatedly collapsed. The marvel is that in such an age\r\neven the attempt was made. The remarkable woman who planned and first\r\neffected it, Queen Margaret of Norway, appealed in the first instance\r\nwith heavy bribes for the co-operation of the clergy,[671] who,\r\nespecially in Sweden, where they preferred the Danish rule to the\r\ndomination of the nobles,[672] were always in favour of it for\r\necclesiastical reasons.\r\n\r\nHad such a union permanently succeeded, it would have eliminated a\r\nserious source of positive political evil; but to carry forward\r\nScandinavian civilisation under the drawbacks of the medieval difficulty\r\nof inter-communication (involving lack of necessary culture-contacts),\r\nthe natural poverty of the soil, and the restrictive pressure of the\r\nCatholic Church, would have been a task beyond the power of a monarchy\r\ncomprising three mutually jealous sections. As it was, the old strifes\r\nrecurred almost as frequently as before, and moral union was never\r\ndeveloped. If historical evidence is to count for anything, the\r\nexperience of the Scandinavian stocks should suffice to discredit once\r\nfor all the persistent pretence that the \"Teutonic races\" have a faculty\r\nfor union denied to the Celtic, inasmuch as they, apparently the most\r\npurely Teutonic of all, were even more irreconcilable, less fusible,\r\nthan the Anglo-Saxons before the Norman Conquest and the Germans down\r\ntill our own day, and much more mutually jealous than the quasi-Teutonic\r\nprovinces of the Netherlands, which, after the severance of Belgium,\r\nhave latterly lost their extreme repulsions, while those of Scandinavia\r\nare not yet dead.[673] The explanation, of course, is not racial in any\r\ncase; but it is for those who affirm that capacity for union is a\r\nTeutonic gift to find a racial excuse.\r\n\r\nWith the Reformation, though that was nowhere more clearly than in\r\nScandinavia a revolution of plunder, there began a new progress, in\r\nrespect not of any friendliness of the Lutheran system to thought and\r\nculture, but of the sheer break-up of the intellectual ice of the old\r\nregimen. In Denmark the process is curiously instructive. Christian II,\r\npersonally a capable and reformative but cruel tyrant, aimed throughout\r\nhis life at reducing the power alike of the clergy and the nobles, and\r\nto that end sought on the one hand to abolish serfdom and educate the\r\npoor and the burghers,[674] and on the other to introduce Lutheranism\r\n(1520). From the latter attempt he was induced to desist, doubtless\r\nsurmising that the remedy might for him be a new disease: but on his\r\nenforcing the reform of slavery he was rebelled against and forced to\r\nfly by the nobility, who thereupon oppressed the people more than\r\never.[675] His uncle and successor, Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein,\r\naccepted the mandate of the nobles to the extent of causing to be\r\npublicly burned in his presence all the laws of the last reign in favour\r\nof the peasants, closing the poor schools throughout the kingdom,\r\nburning the new books,[676] and pledging himself to expel Lutheranism.\r\nHe seems, however, to have been secretly a Protestant, and to have\r\nevaded his pledge; and the rapid spread of the new heresy, especially in\r\nthe cities, brought about a new birth of popular literature in the\r\nvernacular, despite the suppression of the schools.[677] In a few years'\r\ntime, Frederick, recognising the obvious interest of the crown, and\r\nfinding the greater nobles in alliance with the clergy, made common\r\ncause with the smaller nobility, and so was able (1527) to force on the\r\nprelates, who could hope for no better terms from the exiled king, the\r\ntoleration of Protestantism, the permission of marriage to the clergy,\r\nand a surrender of a moiety of the tithes.[678] A few years later (1530)\r\nthe monasteries were either stormed by the populace or abandoned by the\r\nmonks, their houses and lands being divided among the municipalities,\r\nthe king and his courtiers, and the secular clergy.[679] After a stormy\r\ninterregnum, in which the Catholic party made a strenuous reaction, the\r\nnext king, Christian III, taking the nobles and commons-deputies into\r\npartnership, made with their help an end of the Catholic system; the\r\nremaining lands, castles, and manors of the prelates going to the crown,\r\nand the tithes being parcelled among the landowners, the king, and the\r\nclergy. Naturally a large part of the lands, as before, was divided\r\namong the nobles,[680] who were in this way converted to Protestantism.\r\nThus whereas heathen kings had originally embraced Christianity to\r\nenable them to consolidate their power, Christian kings embraced\r\nProtestantism to enable them to recover wealth and power from the\r\nCatholic Church. Creed all along followed interest;[681] and the people\r\nhad small concern in the change.[682]\r\n\r\nNorway, being under the same crown, followed the course of Denmark. In\r\nSweden the powerful Gustavus Vasa saw himself forced at the outset of\r\nhis reign to take power and wealth from the Church if he would have any\r\nof his own; and after the dramatic scene in the Diet of Westeras (1527),\r\nin which he broke out with a passionate vow to renounce the crown if he\r\nwere not better supported,[683] he carried his point. The nobles, being\r\n\"squared\"[684] by permission to resume such of their ancestral lands as\r\nhad been given to churches and convents since 1454, and by promise of\r\nfurther grants, forced the bishops to consent to surrender to the king\r\ntheir castles and strongholds, and to let him fix their revenues; all\r\nwhich was duly done. The monasteries were soon despoiled of nearly all\r\ntheir lands, many of which were seized by or granted in fief to the\r\nbarons;[685] and the king became head of the Church in as full a degree\r\nas Henry VIII in England;[686] sagaciously, and in part unscrupulously,\r\ncreating for the first time in Scandinavia a strong yet not wholly\r\ndespotic monarchy, with such revenues from many sources[687] as made\r\npossible the military power and activity of Gustavus Adolphus, and\r\nlater the effort of Charles XII to create an \"empire\"--an effort which,\r\nnecessarily failing, reduced Sweden permanently to her true economic\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nApart from those remarkable episodes, the development of the\r\nScandinavian States since the sixteenth century has been, on their\r\nrelatively small scale, that of the normal monarchic community with a\r\nvariously vigorous democratic element; shaken frequently by civil\r\nstrife; wasting much strength in insensate wars; losing much through bad\r\nkings and gaining somewhat from the good; passing painfully from bigotry\r\nto tolerance; getting rid of their old aristocracies and developing new;\r\nexhibiting in the mass the northern vice of alcoholism, yet maintaining\r\nracial vigour; disproportionately taxing their producers as compared\r\nwith their non-producers; aiming, nevertheless, at industry and\r\ncommerce, and suffering from the divisive social influences they entail;\r\nmeddling in international strifes, till latterly the surrounding powers\r\npreponderated too heavily; disunited and normally jealous of each other,\r\neven when dynastically united, through stress of crude patriotic\r\nprejudice and lack of political science; frequently retrograding, yet in\r\nthe end steadily progressing in such science as well as in general\r\nculture and well-being. Losses of territory--as Finland and\r\nSchleswig-Holstein--at the hands of stronger rivals, and the violent\r\nexperiences and transitions of the Napoleonic period, have left them on\r\na relatively stable and safe basis, albeit still mutually jealous and\r\nunable to pass beyond the normal monarchic stage. To-day their culture\r\nis that of all the higher civilisations, as are their social problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nIn the history of Scandinavian culture, however, lie some special\r\nillustrations of sociological law. The remarkable fact that the first\r\ngreat development of old Norse literature occurred in the poor and\r\nremote colonial settlement of Iceland is significant of much. To the\r\nretrospective yearning of an exiled people, the desire to preserve every\r\nmemory of the old life in the fatherland, is to be attributed the\r\ngrounding of the saga-cult in Iceland; and the natural conditions,\r\nenforcing long spells of winter leisure, greatly furthered the movement.\r\nBut the finest growth of the new literature, it turns out, is due to\r\nculture-contacts--an unexpected confirmation, in a most unlikely\r\nquarter, of a general principle arrived at on other data. The vigilant\r\nstudy of our own day has detected, standing out from the early\r\nIcelandic literature, \"a group of poems which possess the very qualities\r\nof high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature, passionate\r\ndramatic power, and noble simplicity of language, which [other] Icelandic\r\npoetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong to Iceland at\r\nall. They are the poetry of the 'Western Islands'\"[688]--that is, the\r\npoetry of the meeting and mixing of the \"Celtic\" and Scandinavian stocks\r\nin Ireland and the Hebrides--the former already much mixed, and\r\nproportionally rich in intellectual variations. It was in this area that\r\n\"a magnificent school of poetry arose, to which we owe works that for\r\npower and beauty can be paralleled in no Teutonic language till centuries\r\nafter their date.... This school, which is totally distinct from the\r\nIcelandic, ran its own course apart and perished before the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\"[689]\r\n\r\n     Compare Messrs. Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_,\r\n     1883, vol. i, Introd. pp. lxii, lxiii; and, as regards the old\r\n     Irish civilisation, the author's _Saxon and Celt_, pp. 127, 128,\r\n     131-33.\r\n\r\n     The theory of Celtic influence, though established in its\r\n     essentials, is not perfectly consistent as set forth in the\r\n     _Britannica_ article. Thus, while the Celticised literature is\r\n     remarked for \"noble simplicity of language,\" the true Icelandic,\r\n     primarily like the Old English, is said to develop a \"complexity of\r\n     structure and ornament, an elaborate mythological and enigmatical\r\n     phraseology, and a regularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance,\r\n     quantity, and syllabification which it caught up from the Latin and\r\n     _Celtic_ poets.\" Further, while the Celticised school is described\r\n     as \"totally distinct from the Icelandic,\" Celtic influence is also\r\n     specified as affecting Norse literature in general. The first\r\n     generations of Icelandic poets were men of good birth, \"nearly\r\n     always, too, of Celtic blood on one side at least\"; and they went\r\n     to Norway or Denmark, where they lived as kings' or chiefs'\r\n     henchmen. The immigration of Norse settlers from Ireland, too,\r\n     affected the Iceland stock very early. \"It is to the west that the\r\n     best sagas belong: it is to the west that nearly every classic\r\n     writer whose name we know belongs; and it is precisely in the west\r\n     that the admixture of Irish blood is greatest\" (_ib._). The facts\r\n     seem decisive, and the statements above cited appear the more\r\n     clearly to need modification. It is to be noted that Schweitzer's\r\n     _Geschichte der skandinavischen Literatur_ gives no hint of the\r\n     Celtic influence.\r\n\r\nBut the Icelandic civilisation as a whole could not indefinitely\r\nprogress on its own basis any more than the Irish. Beyond a certain\r\npoint both needed new light and leading; for the primeval spirit of\r\nstrife never spontaneously weakened; the original Icelandic stock being,\r\nto begin with, a selection of revolters from over-rule. So continual\r\ndomestic feuds checked mental evolution in Iceland as in old\r\nScandinavia; and the reduction of the island to Norwegian rule in the\r\nthirteenth century could not do more for it than monarchy was doing for\r\nNorway. Mere Christianity without progressive conditions of culture\r\navailed less for imaginative art than free paganism had done; and when\r\nhigher culture-contacts became possible, the extreme poverty of Iceland\r\ntended more than ever to send the enterprising people where the culture\r\nand comfort were. It is in fact not a possible seat for a relatively\r\nflourishing civilisation in the period of peaceful development. The\r\nReformation seems there to have availed for very little indeed. It was\r\nvehemently resisted,[690] but carried by the preponderant acquisitive\r\nforces: \"nearly all who took part in it were men of low type, moved by\r\npersonal motives rather than religious zeal.\"[691] \"The glebes and\r\nhospital lands were a fresh power in the hands of the crown, and the\r\nsubservient Lutheran clergy became the most powerful class in the\r\nisland; while the bad system of underleasing at rack-rent and short\r\nlease with unsecured tenant-right extended in this way over at least a\r\nquarter of the better land, stopping any possible progress.\" For the\r\nrest, \"the Reformation had produced a real poet [Hallgrim Petersen], but\r\nthe material rise of Iceland\"--that is, the recent improvements in the\r\ncondition of the people--\"has not yet done so,\"[692] though poetry is\r\nstill cultivated in Iceland very much as music is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThus this one little community may be said to have reached the limits of\r\nits evolution, as compared with others, simply because of the strait\r\nnatural conditions in which its lot was cast. But to think of it as a\r\ntragically moribund organism is merely to proceed upon the old\r\nhallucinations of race-consciousness. Men reared in Iceland have done\r\ntheir part in making European civilisation, entering the more southerly\r\nScandinavian stocks as these entered the stocks of western Europe; and\r\nthe present population, who are a remnant, have no more cause to hang\r\ntheir heads than any family that happens to have few members or to have\r\nmissed wealth. Failure is relative only to pretension or purpose.\r\n\r\nThe modern revival of Scandinavian culture, as must needs be, is the\r\noutcome of all the European influences. At the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, in more or less friendly intercourse with the other Protestant\r\ncountries of north Europe, Denmark began effectively to develop a\r\nliterature such as theirs, imaginative and scientific, in the vernacular\r\nas well as in Latin; and so the development went on while Sweden was\r\ngaining military glory with little enlightenment. Then a rash attack\r\nupon Sweden ended in a loss of some of the richest Danish provinces\r\n(1658); whereafter a sudden parliamentary revolution, wrought by a\r\nleague of king and people against the aristocracy, created not a\r\nconstitutional but an absolute and hereditary monarchy (1660),\r\nenthroning divine right at the same instant in Denmark and Norway as in\r\nEngland. Thereafter, deprived of their old posts and subjected to\r\nruinous taxes, the nobility fell rapidly into poverty;[693] and the\r\nmerchant class, equally overtaxed, withdrew their capital; the peasantry\r\nall the while remaining in a state of serfdom.[694] Then came a new\r\nseries of wars with Sweden, recurring through generations, arresting, it\r\nis said, literature, law, philosophy, and medicine,[695] but not the\r\nnatural sciences, then so much in evidence elsewhere: Tycho Brahe being\r\nfollowed in astronomy by Horrebow, while chemistry, mathematics, and\r\neven anatomy made progress. But to this period belongs the brilliant\r\ndramatist and historian Holberg, the first great man of letters in\r\nmodern Scandinavia (d. 1754); and in the latter half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the two years of ascendency of the freethinking physician\r\nStruensee as queen's favourite (1770-72) served partially to emancipate\r\nthe peasants, establish religious toleration, abolish torture, and\r\nreform the administration. Nor did his speedy overthrow and execution\r\nwholly undo his main work,[696] which outdid that of many generations of\r\nthe old regime. Still, the history of his rise and fall, his vehement\r\nspeed of reconstruction and the ruinous resistance it set up, is one of\r\nthe most dramatic of the many warnings of history against thinking\r\nsuddenly to elevate a nation by reforms imposed wholly from\r\nwithout.[697]\r\n\r\nThenceforward, with such fluctuations as mark all culture-history, the\r\nScandinavian world has progressed mentally nearly step for step with\r\nthe rest of Europe, producing scholars, historians, men of science,\r\nartists, and imaginative writers in more than due proportion. Many names\r\nwhich stand for solid achievement in the little-read Scandinavian\r\ntongues are unknown save to specialists elsewhere; but those of Holberg,\r\nLinnaeus, Malte-Brun, Rask, Niebuhr, Madvig, Oehlenschlaeger,\r\nThorwaldsen, and Swedenborg tell of a comprehensive influence on the\r\nthought and culture of Europe during a hundred years in which Europe was\r\nbeing reborn; and in our own day some of the greatest imaginative\r\nliterature of the modern world comes from Norway, long the most backward\r\nof the group. Ibsen, one of a notable company of masters, stood at the\r\nhead of the drama of the nineteenth century; and the society which\r\nsustained him, however he may have satirised it, is certificated abreast\r\nof its age.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nIn one aspect the Scandinavian polities have a special lesson for the\r\nlarger nations. They have perforce been specially exercised latterly, as\r\nof old, by the problem of population; and in Norway there was formerly\r\nmade one of the notable, if not one of the best, approaches to a\r\npractical solution of it. Malthus long ago[698] noted the Norwegian\r\nmarriage-rate as the lowest in Europe save that of Switzerland; and he\r\nexpressed the belief that in his day Norway was \"almost the only country\r\nin Europe where a traveller will hear any apprehension expressed of a\r\nredundant population, and where the danger to the happiness of the lower\r\nclasses of people is in some degree seen and understood.\"[699] This\r\nstate of things having long subsisted, there is a presumption that it\r\npersists uninterruptedly from pagan times, when, as we have seen, there\r\nexisted a deliberate population-policy; for Christian habits of mind can\r\nnowhere be seen to have set up such a tendency, and it would be hard to\r\nshow in the history of Norway any great political change which might\r\neffect a rapid revolution in the domestic habits of the peasantry, such\r\nas occurred in France after the Revolution. Broadly speaking, the mass\r\nof the Norwegian people had till the last century continued to live\r\nunder those external or domiciliary restraints on multiplication which\r\nwere normal in rural Europe in the Middle Ages, and which elsewhere have\r\nbeen removed by industrialism; yet without suffering latterly from a\r\ncontinuance of the severer medieval destructive checks. They must,\r\ntherefore, have put a high degree of restraint on marriage, and probably\r\nobserved parental prudence in addition.\r\n\r\nWhen it is found that in Sweden, where the conditions and usages were\r\nonce similar, there was latterly at once less prudential restraint on\r\nmarriage and population, and a lower standard of material well-being,\r\nthe two cases are seen to furnish a kind of _experimentum crucis_. The\r\ncomparatively late maintenance of a powerful military system in Sweden\r\nhaving there prolonged the methods of aristocratic and bureaucratic\r\ncontrol while they were being modified in Denmark-Norway, Swedish\r\npopulation in the eighteenth century was subject to artificial stimulus.\r\nFrom about the year 1748, the Government set itself, on the ordinary\r\nempirical principle of militarism, to encourage population.[700] Among\r\nits measures were the variously wise ones of establishing medical\r\ncolleges and lying-in and foundling hospitals, the absolute freeing of\r\nthe internal trade in grain, and the withdrawal in 1748 of an old law\r\nlimiting the number of persons allowed to each farm. The purpose of that\r\nlaw had been to stimulate population by spreading tillage; but the spare\r\nsoil being too unattractive, the young people emigrated. On the law\r\nbeing abolished, population did increase considerably, rising between\r\n1751 and 1800 from 1,785,727 to 2,347,308,[701] though some severe\r\nfamines had occurred within the period. But in the year 1799, when\r\nMalthus visited the country, the increased population suffered from\r\nfamine very severely indeed, living mainly and miserably on bark\r\nbread.[702] It was one of Malthus's great object-lessons in his science.\r\nOn one side a poor country was artificially over-populated; on the\r\nother, the people of Norway, an even poorer country, directly and\r\nindirectly[703] restrained their rate of increase, while the Government\r\nduring a long period wrought to the same end by the adjustment of its\r\nmilitary system and by making a certificate of earning power or income\r\nnecessary for all marriages.[704] The result was that, save in the\r\nfishing districts, where speculative conditions encouraged early\r\nmarriages and large families, the Norwegian population were better off\r\nthan the Swedish.[705]\r\n\r\nAlready in Malthus' youth the Norwegian-Danish policy had been altered,\r\nall legal and military restrictions on marriage having been withdrawn;\r\nand he notes that fears were expressed as to the probable results. It is\r\none of his shortcomings to have entirely abstained from subsequent\r\ninvestigation of the subject; and in his late addendum as to the state\r\nof Sweden in 1826 he further fails to note that as a result of a\r\ncreation there after 1803 of 6,000 new farms from land formerly waste,\r\nthe country ceased to need to import corn and was able to export a\r\nsurplus.[706] It still held good, however, that the Norwegian\r\npopulation, being from persistence of prudential habit[707] much the\r\nslower in its rate of increase, had the higher standard of comfort,\r\ndespite much spread of education in Sweden.\r\n\r\nWithin the past half-century the general development of commerce and of\r\nindustry has tended broadly to equalise the condition of the\r\nScandinavian peoples. As late as 1835 a scarcity would suffice to drive\r\nthe Norwegian peasantry to the old subsistence of bark bread, a ruinous\r\nresort, seeing that it destroyed multitudes of trees of which the value,\r\ncould the timber have found a market, would have far exceeded that of a\r\nquantity of flour yielding much more and better food. At that period the\r\nBritish market was closed by duties imposed in the interest of the\r\nCanadian timber trade.[708] Since the establishment of British free\r\ntrade, Norwegian timber has become a new source of wealth; and through\r\nthis and other and earlier commercial developments prudential family\r\nhabits were affected. Thus, whereas the population of Sweden had all but\r\ndoubled between 1800 and 1880, the population of Norway had grown even\r\nfaster.[709] And whereas in 1834 the proportion of illegitimate to\r\nlegitimate births in Stockholm was 1 to 2.26[710] (one of the results of\r\nfoundling hospitals, apparently), in 1890 the total Swedish rate was\r\nslightly below 1 to 10, while in Norway it was 1 to 14. The modern\r\nfacilities for emigration have further affected conjugal habits.\r\nLatterly, however, there are evidences of a new growth of intelligent\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the statistics of emigration and population tell a\r\nfairly plain story. In Norway and Sweden alike the excess of births over\r\ndeaths reached nearly its highest in 1887, the figures being 63,942 for\r\nSweden and 29,233 for Norway. In 1887, however, emigration was about its\r\nmaximum in both countries, 50,786 leaving Sweden and 20,706 leaving\r\nNorway. Thereafter the birth-rate rapidly fell, and the emigration,\r\nthough fluctuating, has never again risen in Sweden to the volume of\r\n1887-88, though it has in Norway. But when, after falling to 43,728 in\r\n1892, the excess of Swedish births over deaths rises to 60,231 in 1895,\r\nwhile the emigration falls from 45,000 in 1892 to 13,000 in 1894, it is\r\nclear that the lesson of regulation is still very imperfectly learned.\r\nNorway shows the same fluctuations, the excess of births rising from\r\n23,600 in 1892 to nearly 32,000 in 1896, and again from 27,685 in 1908\r\nto 29,804 in 1909, doubtless because of ups and downs in the harvests,\r\nas shown in the increase of marriages from 12,742 in 1892 to 13,962 in\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the progression has been similar. There the excess of births\r\nover deaths was so far at its maximum in 1886, the figures being 29,986\r\nin a population of a little over 2,000,000; whereafter they slowly\r\ndecreased, till in 1893 the excess was only 26,235. All the while\r\nemigration was active, gradually rising from 4,346 in 1885 to 10,382 in\r\n1891; then again falling to 2,876 in 1896, when the surplus of births\r\nover deaths was 34,181--a development sure to force more emigration. In\r\n1911 the population was 2,775,076--a rapid rise; and in 1910 the surplus\r\nof births over deaths was 40,110. The Scandinavians are thus still in\r\nthe unstable progressive stage of popular well-being, though probably\r\nsuffering less from it than either Germany or England.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a group of kindred peoples apparently at least as capable\r\nof reaching a solution of the social problem as any other, and visibly\r\nprospering materially and morally in proportion as they bring reason to\r\nbear on the vital lines of conduct, though still in the stage of curing\r\nover-population by emigration. Given continued peaceful political\r\nevolution in the direction first of democratic federation, and further\r\nof socialisation of wealth, they may reach and keep the front rank in\r\ncivilisation, while the more unmanageably large communities face risks\r\nof dire vicissitude.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: As in Carlyle's _Early Kings of Norway_, the _caput\r\nmortuum_ of his historical method. Much more instructive works on\r\nScandinavian history are available to the English reader. The two\r\nvolumes on _Scandinavia_ by Crichton and Wheaton (1837) are not yet\r\nsuperseded, though savouring strongly of the conservatism of their\r\nperiod. Dunham, who rapidly produced, for Gardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia\r\nseries, histories of _Spain and Portugal_ (5 vols.), _Europe during the\r\nMiddle Ages_ (4 vols.), and the _Germanic Empire_ (3 vols.), compiled\r\nalso one of _Denmark, Sweden, and Norway_ (3 vols. 1839-40), of inferior\r\nquality. But Geijer's _History of Sweden_, one of the standard modern\r\nnational histories of Europe, is translated into English as far as the\r\nperiod of Gustavus Vasa (3 vols. of orig. in one of trans. 1845); and\r\nthe competent _History of Denmark_ by C.-F. Allen is available in a\r\nFrench translation (Copenhagen, 2 tom. 1878). Otte's _Scandinavian\r\nHistory_, 1874, is an unpretending and unliterary but well-informed\r\nwork, which may be used to check Crichton and Wheaton. The more recent\r\nwork of Mr. R. Nisbet Bain, _Scandinavia: a Political History of\r\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden from 1513 to 1900_ (Camb. Univ. Press,\r\n1905), is useful for the period covered, but has little sociological\r\nvalue.

As compared\r\nwith the robber baronage and separate princes, they stood for\r\nintelligence and co-operation, and supplied a basis for organisation\r\nwithout which the long German chaos of the Middle Ages would have been\r\nimmeasurably worse. Taking their commercial cue from the cities of\r\nItaly, they reached, as against feudal enemies, a measure of peaceful\r\nunion which the less differentiated Italian cities could not attain save\r\nmomentarily. The decisive conditions were that whereas in Italy the\r\nenemies were manifold--sometimes feudal nobles, sometimes the Emperor,\r\nsometimes the Pope--the German cities had substantially one objective,\r\nthe protection of trade from the robber-knights. Thus, as early as the\r\nyear 1284, seventy cities of South Germany formed the Rhenish League, on\r\nwhich followed that of the Swabian towns. The league of the Hansa\r\ncities, like the other early \"Hansa of London,\" which united cities of\r\nFlanders and France with mercantile London, was a growth on all fours\r\nwith these.[714] Starting, however, in maritime towns which grew to\r\ncommerce from beginnings in fishing, as the earlier Scandinavians had\r\ngrown to piracy, the northern League gave its main strength to trade by\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIts special interest for us to-day lies in the fact that it was\r\nultra-racial, beginning in 1241 in a pact between the free cities of\r\nLuebeck and Hamburg,[715] and finally including Wendish, German, Dutch,\r\nFrench, and even Spanish cities, in fluctuating numbers. The motive to\r\nunion, as it had need be, was one of mercantile gain. Beginning,\r\napparently, by having each its separate authorised _hansa_ or\r\ntrading-group in foreign cities, the earlier trading-towns of the group,\r\nperhaps from the measure of co-operation and fraternity thus forced on\r\nthem abroad,[716] saw their advantage in a special league for the common\r\ngood as a monopoly maintained against outsiders; and this being\r\nextended, the whole League came to bear the generic name.\r\n\r\n     See Kohlrausch for the theory that contact in foreign cities is the\r\n     probable cause of the policy of union (_History of Germany_, Eng.\r\n     tr., p. 260; cp. Ashley, _Introd. to Economic History_, i, 104,\r\n     110). As to the origin of the word, see Stubbs, i, 447, _note_. The\r\n     _hans_ or _hansa_ first appears historically in England as a name\r\n     apparently identical with _gild_; and, starting with a _hansa_ or\r\n     hanse-house of their own, English cities in some cases are found\r\n     trading through subordinate _hansas_ in other cities, not only of\r\n     Normandy but of England itself. Thus arose the Flemish Hansa or\r\n     \"Hansa of London,\" ignored in so many notices of the better-known\r\n     Hanseatic League. Early in the thirteenth century it included a\r\n     number of the towns of Flanders engaged in the English wool-trade;\r\n     and later it numbered at one time seventeen towns, including\r\n     Chalons, Rheims, St. Quentin, Cambray, and Amiens (Ashley, _Introd.\r\n     to Economic History_, i, 109; cp. Prof. Schanz, _Englische\r\n     Handelspolitik_, 1889, i, 6, citing Varenbergh, _Hist. des\r\n     relations diplomatiques entre le comte de Flandre et l'Angleterre\r\n     au moyen age_, Bruxelles, 1874, p. 146 _sq._). There is some\r\n     obscurity as to when the foreign Hansards were first permitted to\r\n     have warehouses and residences of their own in London. Cp.\r\n     Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, vol. i, Sec.\r\n     68; and Ashley, i, 105, following Schanz, who dates this privilege\r\n     in the reign of Henry III, though the merchants of Cologne (_id._\r\n     p. 110) had a _hansa_ or gildhall in London in the reign of Richard\r\n     I. Under whatever conditions, it is clear that London was one of\r\n     the first foreign cities in which the German Hansard traders came\r\n     in friendly contact.\r\n\r\nA reciprocal and normal egoism furthered as well as thwarted the Hansard\r\nenterprise. Trade in the feudal period being a ground of privilege like\r\nany other, the monopolied merchants of every city strove to force\r\nforeign traders to deal with them only. On the other hand, the English\r\nnobility sought to deal rather with the foreigner directly than with the\r\nEnglish middlemen; and thus in each feudal country, but notably in\r\nEngland,[717] the interest of the landed class tended to throw foreign\r\ntrade substantially in foreign hands, which did their best to hold it.\r\nIn the reigns of the Edwards privileges of free trade with natives were\r\ngradually conferred on the foreign traders[718] in the interests of the\r\nlanded class--the only \"general consumers\" who could then make their\r\nclaims felt--in despite of the angry resistance of the native merchant\r\nclass. For the rest, in a period when some maritime English cities, like\r\nthose of France and Germany, could still carry on private wars with each\r\nother as well as with foreign cities,[719] a trader of one English town\r\nwas in any other English town on all fours with a foreigner.[720] When,\r\ntherefore, the foreigners combined, their advantage over the native\r\ntrade was twofold.\r\n\r\nNaturally the cities least liable to regal interference carried on a\r\ncosmopolitan co-operation to the best advantage. The Hansa of London,\r\nbeing made up of Flemish and French cities, was hampered by the divided\r\nallegiance of its members and by their national jealousies;[721] while\r\nthe German cities, sharing in the free German scramble under a nominal\r\nemperor much occupied in Italy, could combine with ease. Cologne, having\r\nearly Hansa rights in London, sought to exclude the other cities, but\r\nhad to yield and join their union;[722] and the Hansa of London dwindled\r\nand broke up before their competition. As the number of leagued cities\r\nincreased, it might be thought, something in the nature of an ideal of\r\nfree trade must have partly arisen, for the number of \"privileged\"\r\ntowns was thus apparently greater than that of the outside towns traded\r\nwith. To the last, however, the faith seems to have been that without\r\nmonopoly the league must perish; and in the closing Protestant period\r\nthe command of the Baltic, as against the Dutch and the Scandinavians,\r\nwas desperately and vainly battled for. But just as the cities could not\r\nescape the play of the other political forces of the time, and were\r\nseverally clutched by this or that potentate, or biassed to their own\r\nstock, so they could not hinder that the principle of self-seeking on\r\nwhich they founded should divide themselves. As soon as the Dutch\r\naffiliated cities saw their opening for trade in the Baltic on their own\r\naccount, they broke away.\r\n\r\nWhile the league lasted, it was as remarkable a polity as any in\r\nhistory. With its four great foreign factories of Bruges, London,\r\nBergen, and Novgorod, and its many minor stations, all conducted by\r\ncelibate servitors living together like so many bodies of friars;[723]\r\nwith its four great circles of affiliated towns, and its triennial and\r\nother congresses, the most cosmopolitan of European parliaments; with\r\nits military and naval system, by which, turning its trading into\r\nfighting fleets, it made war on Scandinavian kings and put down piracy\r\non every hand--it was in its self-seeking and often brutal way one of\r\nthe popular civilising influences of northern Europe for some two\r\nhundred and fifty years; and the very forces of separate national\r\ncommerce, which finally undermined it, were set up or stimulated by its\r\nown example. With less rapacity, indeed, it might have conciliated\r\npopulations that it alienated. A lack of any higher ideals than those of\r\nzealous commerce marks its entire career; it is associated with no such\r\ngrowth of learning and the fine arts as took place in commercial\r\nHolland; and its members seem to have been among the most unrefined of\r\nthe northern city populations.[724] But it made for progress on the\r\nordinary levels. In a world wholly bent on privilege in all directions,\r\nit at least tempered its own spirit of monopoly in some measure by its\r\nprinciple of inclusion; and it passed away as a great power before it\r\ncould dream of renewing the ideal of monopoly in the more sinister form\r\nof Oriental empire taken up by the Dutch. And, while its historians have\r\nnot been careful to make a comparative study of the internal civic life\r\nwhich flourished under the commercial union, it does not at all appear\r\nthat the divisions of classes were more steep, or the lot of the lower\r\nworse, than in any northern European State of the period.\r\n\r\nThe \"downfall\" of such a polity, then, is conceptual only. All the\r\nrealities of life evolved by the league were passed on to its\r\nconstituent elements throughout northern Europe; and there survived from\r\nit what the separate States had not yet been able to offer--the\r\nadumbration, however dim, of a union reaching beyond the bounds of\r\nnationality and the jealousies of race. In an age of private war,\r\nwithout transcending the normal ethic, it practically limited private\r\nwar as regarded its German members; and while joining battle at need\r\nwith half-barbarian northern kings, or grudging foreigners, it of\r\nnecessity made peace its ideal. Its dissolution, therefore, marked at\r\nonce the advance of national organisation up to its level, and the\r\npersistence of the more primitive over the more rational instincts of\r\ncoalition.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, bk. ix, cap. 147;\r\nKohlrausch, _History of Germany_, Eng. tr., pp. 157, 162, 257; Dunham,\r\n_History of the Germanic Empire_, 1835, i, 108; Sharon Turner, _History\r\nof Europe during the Middle Ages_, 2nd ed. i, 13.

Returning to Milan in 1019, they\r\ndeveloped their organisation there. Down to 1140 all the members were\r\nlaymen; but thereafter priests were placed in control. For long the\r\norganisation was in high repute both for commercial skill and for\r\nculture. Ultimately, like all other corporate orders, they grew corrupt;\r\nand in 1571 they were suppressed by Pius V.

It should be noted, however, that\r\nLuebeck is credited with being the first northern town to adopt the\r\nOriental usage of water-pipes (Macpherson, _Annals of Commerce_, 1802,\r\ni, 381).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nHOLLAND\r\n\r\nNOTE ON LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led\r\nin past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was\r\ngiven to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low\r\nCountries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,\r\nfolio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;\r\nin Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of\r\nthe kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon\r\nthe United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers\r\nfurther foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions\r\nof the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nthe great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century\r\nmany English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An\r\nEnglish translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously\r\nknown as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,\r\nand _Political Maxims of the State of Holland_ (really written by De\r\nWitt's friend, Pierre Delacourt; De Witt, however, contributing two\r\nchapters), and much attention was given to it here and on the Continent.\r\nIn addition to the many and copious histories written in the eighteenth\r\ncentury in Dutch, three or four voluminous and competent histories of\r\nthe Low Countries were written in French--_e.g._, those of Dujardin\r\n(1757, etc., 8 vols. 4to), Cerisier (1777, etc., 10 vols. 12mo), Le\r\nClerc (1723-28, 3 vols. folio), Wicquefort (1719, folio, proceeding from\r\nPeace of Muenster). Of late years, though the lesson is as important as\r\never, it appears to be less generally attended to. In our own country,\r\nhowever, have appeared Davies' _History of Holland_ (1841, 3 vols.), a\r\ncareful but not often an illuminating work, which oddly begins with the\r\nstatement that \"there is scarcely any nation whose history has been so\r\nlittle understood or so generally neglected as that of Holland\"; T.\r\nColley Grattan's earlier and shorter book (_The Netherlands_, 1830),\r\nwhich is still worth reading for a general view based on adequate\r\nlearning; and the much better known works of Motley, _The Rise of the\r\nDutch Republic_ (1856) and the _History of the United Netherlands_\r\n(1861-68), which deal minutely with only a period of fifty-five years of\r\nDutch history, and of which, as of the work of Davies, the sociological\r\nvalue is much below the annalistic. All three are impaired as literature\r\nby their stale rhetoric. The same malady infects the second volume of\r\nthe _Industrial History of the Free Nations_ (1846), by W. Torrens\r\nM'Cullagh (afterwards M'Cullagh Torrens); but this, which deals with\r\nHolland, is the better section of that treatise, and it gives distinct\r\nhelp to a scientific conception of the process of Dutch history, as does\r\nJ.R. M'Culloch's _Essay on the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Commerce\r\nin Holland_, which is one of the best of his _Essays and Treatises_ (2nd\r\ned. 1859). The _Holland_ of the late Professor Thorold Rogers has merit\r\nas a vivacious conspectus, but hardly rises to the opportunity.\r\n\r\nOf the many French, Belgian, and German works on special periods of the\r\nhistory of the Low Countries, some have a special and general scientific\r\ninterest. Among these is the research of M. Alphonse Wauters on _Les\r\nlibertes communales_ (Bruxelles, 1878). Barante's _Histoire des Ducs de\r\nBourgogne_ (4th ed. 1838-40) contains much interesting matter on the\r\nBurgundian period. The assiduous research of M. Lefevre Pontalis, _Jean\r\nde Witt, Grand Pensionnaire de Hollande_ (2 tom. 1884; Eng. trans. 2\r\nvols.), throws a full light on one of the most critical periods of Dutch\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nDutch works on the history of the Low Countries in general, and the\r\nUnited Provinces in particular, are many and voluminous; indeed, no\r\nhistory has been more amply written. The good general history of the\r\nNetherlands by N.G. van Kampen, which appeared in German in the series\r\nof Heeren and Uckert (1831-33), is only partially superseded by the\r\n_Geschichte der Niederlande_ of Wenzelburger (Bd. i, 1879; ii, 1886),\r\nwhich is not completed. But the most readable general history of the\r\nNetherlands yet produced is that of P.J. Blok, _Geschiedenis van het\r\nNederlandsche Volk_ (1892, etc.), of which there is a competent but\r\nunfortunately abridged English translation (Putnams, vol. i, 1898).\r\nStandard modern Dutch works are those of J.A. Vijnne, _Geschiedenis van\r\nhet Vaderland_, and J. van Lennep, _De Geschiedenis van Nederland_. For\r\nBelgian history in particular the authorities are similarly numerous.\r\nThe _Manuel de l'histoire de Belgique_, by J. David (Louvain, 1847),\r\nwill be found a good handbook of authorities, episodes, and chronology,\r\nthough without any sociological element. The _Histoire de Belgique_ of\r\nTh. Juste (Bruxelles, 1895, 3 tom. 4to) is comprehensive, but disfigured\r\nby insupportable illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. _The Rise of the Netherlands_\r\n\r\nThe case of Holland is one of those which at first sight seem to flout\r\nthe sociological maxim that civilisations flourish in virtue partly of\r\nnatural advantages and partly of psychological pressures. On the face of\r\nthings, it would seem that the original negation of natural advantage\r\ncould hardly be carried farther than here. A land pieced together out of\r\ndrained marshes certainly tells more of man's effort than of Nature's\r\nbounty. Yet even here the process of natural law is perfectly sequent\r\nand intelligible.\r\n\r\nOne of the least-noted influences of the sea on civilisation is the\r\neconomic basis it yields in the way of food-supply. Already in Caesar's\r\ntime the Batavians were partly fishermen; and it may be taken as certain\r\nthat through all the troubled ages down to the period of industry and\r\ncommerce it was the resource of fishing that mainly maintained and\r\nretained population in the sea-board swamps of the Low Countries. Here\r\nwas a harvest that enemies could not destroy, that demanded no ploughing\r\nand sowing, and that could not well be reaped by the labour of slaves.\r\nWhen war and devastation could absolutely depopulate the cultivated\r\nland, forcing all men to flee from famine, the sea for ever yielded some\r\nreturn to him who could but get afloat with net or line; and he who\r\ncould sail the sea had a double chance of life and freedom as against\r\nland enemies. Thus a sea marsh could be humanly advantaged as against a\r\nfruitful plain, and could be a surer dwelling-place. The tables were\r\nfirst effectually turned when the Norse pirates attacked from the\r\nsea--an irresistible inroad which seems to have driven the sea-board\r\nFrisians (as it did the coast inhabitants of France) in crowds into\r\nslavery for protection, thus laying a broad foundation of popular\r\nserfdom.[725] When, however, the Norse empire began to fail, the sea as\r\na source of sustenance again counted for civilisation; and when to this\r\nnatural basis of population and subsistence there was added the peculiar\r\nstimulus set up by a religious inculcation or encouragement of a fish\r\ndiet, the fishing-grounds of the continent became relatively richer\r\nestates than mines and vineyards. Venice and Holland alike owed much to\r\nthe superstition which made Christians akreophagous on Fridays and\r\nfast-days and all through the forty days of Lent. When the plan of\r\nsalting herrings was hit upon,[726] all Christian Europe helped to make\r\nthe fortunes of the fisheries.\r\n\r\nNet-making may have led to weaving; in any case weaving is the first\r\nimportant industry developed in the Low Countries. It depended mainly on\r\nthe wool of England; and on the basis of the ancient seafaring there\r\nthus arose a sea-going commerce.[727] Further, the position of\r\nFlanders,[728] as a trade-centre for northern and southern Europe,\r\nserved to make it a market for all manner of produce; and round such a\r\nmarket population and manufactures grew together. It belonged to the\r\nconditions that, though the territory came under feudal rule like every\r\nother in the medieval military period, the cities were relatively\r\nenergetic all along,[729] theirs being (after the Dark Ages, when the\r\nwork was largely done by the Church) the task of maintaining the\r\nsea-dykes[730] and water-ways, and theirs the wealth on which alone the\r\nfeudal over-lords could hope to flourish in an unfruitful land. The\r\nover-lords, on their part, saw the expediency of encouraging foreigners\r\nto settle and add to their taxable population,[731] thus establishing\r\nthe tradition of political tolerance long before the Protestant period.\r\nHence arose in the Netherlands, after the Renaissance, the phenomenon of\r\na dense industrial population flourishing on a soil which finally could\r\nnot be made to feed them,[732] and carrying on a vast shipping trade\r\nwithout owning a single good harbour and without possessing home-grown\r\ntimber wherewith to build their ships, or home-products to freight\r\nthem.[733]\r\n\r\nOne of the determinants of this growth on a partially democratic footing\r\nwas clearly the primary and peculiar necessity for combination by the\r\ninhabitants to maintain the great sea-dykes, the canals, and the\r\nembankments of the low-lying river-lands in the interior.[734] It was a\r\npublic bond in peace, over and above the normal tie of common enmities.\r\nThe result was a development of civic life still more rapid and more\r\nmarked in inland Flanders,[735] where the territorial feudal power was\r\nnaturally greater than in the maritime Dutch provinces. Self-ruling\r\ncities, such as Ghent and Antwerp, at their meridian, were too powerful\r\nto be effectively menaced by their immediate feudal lords. But on the\r\nside of their relations with neighbouring cities or States they all\r\nexhibited the normal foible; and it was owing only to the murderous\r\ncompulsion put upon them by Spain in the sixteenth century that any of\r\nthe provinces of the Netherlands became a federal republic. For five\r\ncenturies after Charlemagne, who subdued them to his system, the Low\r\nCountries had undergone the ordinary slow evolution from pure feudalism\r\nto the polity of municipalities. In the richer inland districts the\r\nfeudal system, lay and clerical, was at its height, the baronial castles\r\nbeing \"here more numerous than in any other part of Christendom\";[736]\r\nand when the growing cities began to feel their power to buy charters,\r\nthe feudal formula was unchallenged,[737] while the mass of the outside\r\npopulation were in the usual \"Teutonic\" state of partial or complete\r\nserfdom. It was only by burning their suburbs and taking to the walled\r\nfortress that the people of Utrecht escaped the yoke of the\r\nNorsemen.[738]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Torrens M'Cullagh is responsible for the statement that \"it\r\n     seems doubtful whether any portion of the inhabitants of Holland\r\n     were ever in a state of actual servitude or bondage,\" and that the\r\n     northern provinces were more generally free from slavery than the\r\n     others (_Industrial History of the Free Nations_, 1846, ii, 39).\r\n     Motley (_Rise of the Dutch Republic_, as cited, pp. 17, 18)\r\n     pronounces, on the contrary, that \"in the northern Netherlands the\r\n     degraded condition of the mass continued longest,\" and that \"the\r\n     number of slaves throughout the Netherlands was very large; the\r\n     number belonging to the bishopric of Utrecht enormous.\" This is\r\n     substantially borne out by Grattan, _Netherlands_, pp. 18, 34;\r\n     Blok, _Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Volk_, i, 159, 160,\r\n     305-11, Eng. tr. i, 203-8; Wauters, _Les libertes communales_,\r\n     1878, pp. 222-30. As is noted by Blok, the status of the peasantry\r\n     fluctuated, the thirteenth century being one of partial\r\n     retrogression. Cp. pp. 318, 319, as to the general depression of\r\n     the peasant class. The great impulse to slavery, as above noted,\r\n     seems to have been given by the Norse pirates in general and the\r\n     later Norman invaders, who, under Godfrey, forced every \"free\"\r\n     Frisian to wear a halter. The comparative protection accruing to\r\n     slaves of the Church was embraced by multitudes. In the time of the\r\n     Crusades, again, many serfs were sold or mortgaged to the Church by\r\n     the nobles in order to obtain funds for their expedition.\r\n\r\nThe cities were thus the liberating and civilising forces;[739] and the\r\napplication of townsmen's capital to the land was an early influence in\r\nimproving rural conditions.[740] But there was no escape from the\r\nfatality of strife in the Teutonic any more than in the ancient Greek or\r\nin the contemporary Italian world. Flanders, having the large markets of\r\nFrance at hand, developed its clothmaking and other industries more\r\nrapidly than the Frisian districts, where weaving was probably earlier\r\ncarried on;[741] and here serfdom disappeared comparatively early,[742]\r\nthe nobility dwindling through their wars; but the new industrial\r\nstrifes of classes, which grew up everywhere in the familiar fashion,\r\nnaturally matured the sooner in the more advanced civilisation; and\r\nalready at the beginning of the fourteenth century we find a resulting\r\ndisintegration. The monopoly methods of the trade gilds drove much of\r\nthe weaving industry into the villages; then the Franco-Flemish wars,\r\nwherein the townspeople, by expelling the French in despite of the\r\nnobility, greatly strengthened their position,[743] nevertheless tended,\r\nas did the subsequent civil wars, to drive trade into South Brabant.\r\n\r\nIn Flemish Ghent and Bruges the clashing interests of weavers and\r\nwoollen-traders, complicated by the strife of the French (aristocratic)\r\nand anti-French (popular) factions, led to riots in which citizens and\r\nmagistrates were killed (1301). At times these enmities reached the\r\nmagnitude of civil war. At Ypres (1303) a combination of workmen\r\ndemanded the suppression of rival industries in neighbouring villages,\r\nand in an ensuing riot the mayor and all the magistrates were slain; at\r\nBruges (1302) a trade riot led to the loss of fifteen hundred\r\nlives.[744] When later the weaving trade had flourished in Brabant, the\r\nsame fatality came about: plebeians rebelled against patrician\r\nmagistrates--themselves traders or employers of labour--in the principal\r\ncities; and Brussels (1312) was for a time given up to pillage and\r\nmassacre, put down only by the troops of the reigning duke. A great\r\nlegislative effort was made in the \"Laws of Cortenberg,\" framed by an\r\nassembly of nobles and city deputies, to regulate fiscal and industrial\r\naffairs in a stable fashion;[745] but after fifty years the trouble\r\nbroke out afresh, and was ill-healed.[746] At length, in a riot in the\r\nrich city of Louvain (1379), sixteen of its patrician magistrates were\r\nslain, whereupon many took flight to England, but many more to Haarlem,\r\nAmsterdam, Leyden, and other Dutch cities.[747] Louvain never again\r\nrecovered its trade and wealth;[748] and since the renewed\r\nFranco-Flemish wars of this period had nearly destroyed the commerce of\r\nFlanders,[749] there was a general gravitation of both merchandise and\r\nmanufacture to Holland.[750] Thus arose Dutch manufactures in an organic\r\nconnection with maritime commerce, the Dutch municipal organisation\r\nsecuring a balance of trade interests where that of the Flemish\r\nindustrial cities had partially failed.\r\n\r\nThe commercial lead given by the Hanseatic League was followed in the\r\nNetherlands with a peculiar energy, and till the Spanish period the main\r\npart of Dutch maritime commerce was with northern Europe and the Hansa\r\ncities. So far as the language test goes, the original Hansards and the\r\nDutch were of the same \"Low Dutch\" stock, which was also that of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons.[751] Thus there was seen the phenomenon of a vigorous\r\nmaritime and commercial development among the continental branches of\r\nthe race; while the English, having lost its early seafaring habits on\r\nits new settlement, lagged far behind in both developments. Kinship, of\r\ncourse, counted for nothing towards goodwill between the nations when it\r\ncould not keep peace within or between the towns; and in the fifteenth\r\ncentury the Dutch cities are found at war with the Hansa, as they had\r\nbeen in the thirteenth with England, and were to be again. But the\r\nspirit of strife did its worst work at home. On the one hand, a physical\r\nschism had been set up in Friesland in the thirteenth century by the\r\nimmense disaster of the inundation which enlarged the Zuyder Zee.[752]\r\nOf that tremendous catastrophe there are singularly few historic traces;\r\nbut it had the effect of making two small countries where there had been\r\none large one, what was left of West Friesland being absorbed in the\r\nspecific province of Holland, while East Friesland, across the Zuyder\r\nZee, remained a separate confederation of maritime districts.[753] To\r\nthe south-west, again, the great Flemish cities were incurably jealous\r\nof each other's prosperity, as well as inwardly distracted by their\r\nclass disputes; and within the cities of Holland, in the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, while intelligible lines of cleavage between trades\r\nor classes are hard to find, the factions of Hoek and Kabbeljauw, the\r\n\"Hooks\" and the \"Codfish,\" appear to have carried on a chronic strife,\r\nas irrational as any to be noted in the cities of Italy. Thus in the\r\nnorth as in the south, among Teutons as among \"Latins\" and among ancient\r\nGreeks, the primary instincts of separation checked democratic growth\r\nand coalition; though after the period of local feudal sovereignties the\r\npowerful monarchic and feudal forces in the Netherlands withheld the\r\ncities from internecine wars.\r\n\r\n     The most sympathetic historians are forced from the first to note\r\n     the stress of mutual jealousy among the cities and districts of the\r\n     Netherlands. \"The engrained habit of municipal isolation,\" says\r\n     one, \"was the cause why the general liberties of the Netherlands\r\n     were imperilled, why the larger part of the country was ultimately\r\n     ruined, and why the war of independence was conducted with so much\r\n     risk and difficulty, even in the face of the most serious perils\"\r\n     (Thorold Rogers, _Holland_, p. 26. Cp. pp. 35, 43; Motley, pp. 29,\r\n     30, 43; Grattan, pp. 39, 50, 51). Van Kampen avows (_Geschichte der\r\n     Niederlande_, i, 131) that throughout the Middle Ages Friesland was\r\n     unprogressive owing to constant feuds. Even as late as 1670 Leyden\r\n     refused to let the Harle Maer be drained, because it would\r\n     advantage other cities; and Amsterdam in turn opposed the reopening\r\n     of the old Rhine channel because it would make Leyden maritime\r\n     (Temple, _Observations_, i, 130, ch. iii).\r\n\r\n     As regards the early factions of the \"Hooks\" and the \"Codfish\" in\r\n     the Dutch towns, the historic obscurity is so great that historians\r\n     are found ascribing the names in contrary ways. Grattan (p. 49)\r\n     represents the Hooks as the town party, and the Codfish as the\r\n     party of the nobles; Motley (p. 21) reverses the explanation,\r\n     noting, however, that there was no consistent cleavage of class or\r\n     of principle (cp. M'Cullagh, pp. 99, 100). This account is\r\n     supported by Van Kampen, i, 170, 171. The fullest survey of the\r\n     Hook and Cod feud is given by Wenzelburger, _Geschichte der\r\n     Niederlande_, i, 210-42. As to feuds of other parties in some of\r\n     the cities see Van Kampen, i, 172. They included, for example, a\r\n     class feud between the rich _Vetkooper_ (fat-dealers) and the poor\r\n     _Schieringer_ (eel-fishers). See Davies, i, 180.\r\n\r\nThus dissident, and with feudal wars breaking out in every generation,\r\nthe cities and provinces could win concessions from their feudal chiefs\r\nwhen the latter were in straits, as in the famous case of the \"Great\r\nPrivilege\" extorted from the Duchess Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold\r\nof Burgundy, after her father's overthrow by the Swiss; again in the\r\ncase of her husband Maximilian after her death; and previously in the\r\nreaffirmation of the ill-observed Laws of Cortenberg, secured from the\r\nDuke of Brabant by the Louvainers in 1372; but they could never deliver\r\nthemselves from the feudal superstition, never evolve the republican\r\nideal. When the rich citizens exploited the poor, it was the local\r\nsovereign's cue, as of old, to win the populace; whereupon the\r\npatricians leant to the over-lord, were he even the King of France; or\r\nit might be that the local lord himself sought the intervention of his\r\nsuzerain, who again was at times the first to meddle, and against whom,\r\nas against rival potentates, the cities would at times fight desperately\r\nfor their recognised head, when he was not overtaxing or thwarting them,\r\nor endangering their commerce.[754] It was a medley of clashing\r\ninterests, always in unstable equilibrium. And so when sovereign powers\r\non a great scale, as the Dukes of Burgundy, followed by the Archduke\r\nMaximilian, and later by the Emperor Charles, came into the inheritance\r\nof feudal prestige, the Dutch and Flemish cities became by degrees\r\nnearly as subordinate as those of France and Germany, losing one by one\r\ntheir municipal privileges.[755] The monarchic superstition overbore the\r\npassions of independence and primary interest; and a strong feudal ruler\r\ncould count on a more general and durable loyalty than was ever given to\r\nany citizen-statesman. James van Arteveldt, who guided Ghent in the\r\nfourteenth century, and whose policy was one of alliance with the\r\nEnglish king against the French, the feudal over-lord, was \"the greatest\r\npersonality Flanders ever produced.\"[756] But though Arteveldt's policy\r\nwas maintained even by his murderers, murdered he was by his\r\nfellow-citizens, as the great De Witt was to be murdered in Holland\r\nthree hundred years later. The monarchised Netherlanders were\r\nrepublicans only in the last resort, as against insupportable tyranny.\r\nPhilip of Burgundy, who heavily oppressed them, they called \"The Good.\"\r\nAt the end of the fifteenth century Maximilian was able, even before he\r\nbecame Emperor, not only to crush the \"bread-and-cheese\" rebellion of\r\nthe exasperated peasantry in Friesland and Guelderland,[757] but to put\r\ndown all the oligarchs who had rebelled against him, and finally to\r\nbehead them by the dozen,[758] leaving the land to his son as a\r\nvirtually subject State.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, under Charles V, the men of Ghent, grown once\r\nagain a great commercial community,[759] exhibited again the fatal\r\ninstability of the undeveloped democracy of all ages. Called upon to pay\r\ntheir third of a huge subsidy of 1,200,000 _caroli_ voted by the Flemish\r\nStates to the Emperor, they rang their bell of revolt and defied him,\r\noffering their allegiance to the King of France. That monarch, by way of\r\na bargain, promptly betrayed the intrigue to his \"brother,\" who\r\nthereupon marched in force through France to the rebel city, now\r\nparalysed by terror; and without meeting a shadow of resistance,\r\npenalised it to the uttermost, beheading a score of leading citizens,\r\nbanishing many more, annulling its remaining municipal rights, and\r\nexacting an increased tribute.[760] It needed an extremity of grievance\r\nto drive such communities to an enduring rebellion. When Charles V\r\nabdicated at Brussels in favour of his son Philip in 1555, he had\r\nalready caused to be put to death Netherlanders to the number at least\r\nof thousands for religious heresy;[761] and still the provinces were\r\nabsolutely submissive, and the people capable of weeping collectively\r\nout of sympathy with the despot's infirmities.[762] He, on his part,\r\nborn and educated among them, and knowing them well, was wont to say of\r\nthem that there was not a nation under the sun which more detested the\r\n_name_ of slavery, or that bore the reality more patiently when managed\r\nwith discretion.[763] He spoke whereof he knew.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. _The Revolt against Spain_\r\n\r\nThat the people who endured so much at the hands of a despot should have\r\nrevolted unsubduably against his son is to be explained in terms of\r\ncertain circumstances little stressed in popular historiography. In the\r\nnarratives of the rhetorical historians, no real explanation arises. The\r\nrevolt figures as a stand for personal and religious freedom. But when\r\nCharles abdicated, after slaying his thousands, the Reformation had been\r\nin full tide for over thirty years; Calvin had built up Protestant\r\nGeneva to the point of burning Servetus; England had been for twenty\r\nyears depapalised; France, with many scholars and nobles converted to\r\nCalvinism, was on the verge of a civil war of Huguenots and Catholics;\r\nthe Netherlands themselves had been drenched in the blood of heretics;\r\nand still no leading man had thought of repudiating either Spain or\r\nRome. Yet within thirteen years they were in full revolt, led by William\r\nof Orange, now turned Protestant. Seeing that mere popular Protestantism\r\nhad spread far and gone fast, religious opinion was clearly not the\r\ndetermining force.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the _conditio sine qua non_ was the psychological reversal\r\neffected by Philip when he elected to rule as a Spaniard, where his\r\nfather had in effect ruled as a Fleming. Charles had always figured as a\r\nnative of the Netherlands, at home among his people, friendly to their\r\ngreat men, ready to employ them in his affairs, even to the extent of\r\npartly ruling Spain through them. After his punishment of Ghent they\r\nwere his boon subjects; and in his youth it was the Spaniards who were\r\njealous of the Flemish and Dutch. This state of things had begun under\r\nhis Flemish-German father, Philip I, who became King of Spain by\r\nmarriage, and under whom the Netherland nobles showed in Spain a\r\nrapacity that infuriated the Spaniards against them. It was a question\r\nsimply of racial predominance; and had the dynasty chosen to fix its\r\ncapital in the north rather than in the south, it would have been the\r\nlot of the Netherlanders to exploit Spain--a task for which they were\r\nperfectly ready.\r\n\r\n     The gross rapacity of the Flemings in Spain under Philip I is\r\n     admitted by Motley (_Rise_, as cited, pp. 31, 75); but on the same\r\n     score feeling was passionately strong in Spain in the earlier years\r\n     of the reign of Charles. Cp. Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. i (Works,\r\n     ed. 1821, iv, 37, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52, 53, 55, 77 78); and van\r\n     Kampen, _Geschichte der Niederlande_, i, 277, 278. It took more\r\n     than ten years to bring Charles in good relations with the\r\n     Spaniards. See Mr. E. Armstrong's _Introduction_ to Major Martin\r\n     Hume's _Spain_, 1898, pp. 31-37, 57, 76. Even in his latter years\r\n     they are found protesting against his customary absence from Spain,\r\n     and his perpetual wars. Robertson, bk. vi, p. 494. Cp. bk. xii,\r\n     vol. v, p. 417, as to the disregard shown him after his abdication.\r\n\r\n     While it lasted, the Flemish exploitation of Spain was as shameless\r\n     as the Spanish exploitation of Italy. The Italian Peter Martyr\r\n     Angleria, residing at the court of Spain, reckoned that in ten\r\n     months the Flemings there remitted home over a million ducats\r\n     (Robertson, bk. i, p. 53). A lad, nephew of Charles's Flemish\r\n     minister Chievres, was appointed to the archbishopric of Toledo, in\r\n     defiance of general indignation. The result was a clerico-popular\r\n     insurrection. Everything goes to show that but for the Emperor's\r\n     prudence his Flemings would have ruined him in Spain, by getting\r\n     him to tyrannise for their gain, as Philip II later did for the\r\n     Church's sake in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIt is not unwarrantable to say that had not Charles had the sagacity to\r\nadapt himself to the Spanish situation, learning to speak the language\r\nand even to tolerate the pride of the nobles[764] to a degree to which\r\nhe never yielded before the claims of the burghers of the Netherlands,\r\nand had he not in the end identified himself chiefly with his Spanish\r\ninterests, the history of Spain and the Netherlands might have been\r\nentirely reversed. Had he, that is, kept his seat of rule in the\r\nNetherlands, drawing thither the unearned revenues of the Americas, and\r\nstill contrived to keep Spain subject to his rule, the latter country\r\nwould have been thrown back on her great natural resources, her\r\nindustry, and her commerce, which, as it was, developed markedly during\r\nhis reign,[765] despite the heavy burdens of his wars. And in that case\r\nSpain might conceivably have become the Protestant and rebellious\r\nterritory, and the Netherlands on the contrary have remained Catholic\r\nand grown commercially decrepit, having in reality the weaker potential\r\neconomic basis.\r\n\r\n     The theorem that the two races were vitally opposed in \"religious\r\n     sentiment,\" and that \"it was as certain that the Netherlanders\r\n     would be fierce reformers as that the Spaniards would be\r\n     uncompromising persecutors\" (Motley, p. 31), is part of the common\r\n     pre-scientific conception of national development, and proceeds\r\n     upon flat disregard of the historical evidence. It is well\r\n     established that there was as much heresy of the more rational\r\n     Protestant and Unitarian sort in Spain, to begin with, as in\r\n     Holland. Under Ferdinand and Isabella the Inquisition seems to\r\n     have struck mainly at Judaic and Moorish monotheistic heresy, which\r\n     was not uncommon among the upper classes, while the lower were for\r\n     the most part orthodox (Armstrong, _Introd._ to Major Hume's\r\n     _Spain_, pp. 14, 18). Thus there is good ground for the surmise\r\n     that Ferdinand's object was primarily the confiscation of the\r\n     wealth of Jews and other rich heretics. (See U.R. Burke, _History\r\n     of Spain_, 1895, ii, 101; Hume's ed. 1900, ii, 74.) In Aragon,\r\n     Valencia, and Catalonia there was general resistance to the\r\n     Inquisition; in Cordova there was a riot against it; in Saragossa\r\n     the Inquisitor was murdered before the altar (Armstrong, p. 18;\r\n     Llorente, _Hist. crit. de l'Inquisition d'Espagne_, ed. 1818, i,\r\n     185-213; M'Crie, _Reformation in Spain_, ed. 1856, pp. 52-53. Cp.\r\n     U.R. Burke, as cited, ii, 97, 98, 101, 103, 111; Hume's ed. ii, 66,\r\n     70-71, 74-77, 82; as to the general and prolonged resistance of the\r\n     people). During that reign Torquemada is credited with burning ten\r\n     thousand persons in eighteen years (Prescott, _History of Ferdinand\r\n     and Isabella_, Kirk's ed. 1889, p. 178, citing Llorente. But see p.\r\n     746, _note_, as to possible exaggeration. Cp. Burke, ii, 113;\r\n     Hume's ed. ii, 84). In the early Lutheran period the spread of\r\n     scholarly Protestantism in Spain was extremely rapid (La\r\n     Rigaudiere, _Histoire des persecutions religieuses en Espagne_,\r\n     1860, p. 245 sq.), and in the early years of Philip II it needed\r\n     furious persecution to crush it, thousands leaving the kingdom\r\n     (Prescott, _Philip II_, bk. ii, ch. iii; M'Crie, _Reformation in\r\n     Spain_, ch. viii; De Castro, _History of the Spanish Protestants_,\r\n     Eng. tr. 1851, _passim_). At the outset, 800 persons were arrested\r\n     in Seville alone in one day; and the Venetian ambassador in 1562\r\n     testifies to the large number of Huguenots in Spain (Ranke, _Hist.\r\n     of the Popes_, bk. v, Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. p. 136).\r\n\r\n     Had Philip II had Flemish sympathies and chosen to make Brussels\r\n     his capital, the stress of the Inquisition could have fallen on the\r\n     Netherlands as successfully as it actually did on Spain. His\r\n     father's reign had proved as much. According to Motley, not only\r\n     multitudes of Anabaptists but \"thousands and tens of thousands of\r\n     virtuous and well-disposed men and women\" had then been \"butchered\r\n     in cold blood\" (_Rise_, p. 43), without any sign of rebellion on\r\n     the part of the provinces, whose leading men remained Catholic. In\r\n     1600 most of the inhabitants of Groningen were Catholics (Davies,\r\n     ii, 347). A Protestant historian (Grattan, p. 93) admits that the\r\n     Protestants \"never, and least of all in these days, formed the\r\n     mass.\" Another has admitted, as regards those of Germany, that\r\n     \"nothing had contributed more to the undisturbed progress of their\r\n     opinions than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long\r\n     absence of Charles, and the slackness of the reins of government\r\n     which these occasioned\" (Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. v, ed. cited\r\n     of _Works_, vol. iv, p. 387). \"It was only tanners, dyers, and\r\n     apostate priests who were Protestants at that day in the\r\n     Netherlands\" (Motley, p. 124). The same conditions would have had\r\n     similar results in Spain, where many Catholics thought Philip much\r\n     too religious for his age and station (Motley, p. 76).\r\n\r\n     It seems necessary to insist on the elementary fact that it was\r\n     Netherlanders who put Protestants to death in the Netherlands; and\r\n     that it was Spaniards who were burnt in Spain. In the Middle Ages\r\n     \"nowhere was the persecution of heretics more relentless than in\r\n     the Netherlands\" (Motley, p. 36; cp. p. 132). Grenvelle, most\r\n     zealous of heresy-hunters, was a Burgundian; Viglius, an even\r\n     bitterer persecutor, was a Frisian. The statement of Prescott\r\n     (_Philip II_, Kirk's ed. 1894, p. 149) that the Netherlanders\r\n     \"claimed freedom of thought as their birthright\" is a gratuitous\r\n     absurdity. As regards, further, the old hallucination of \"race\r\n     types,\" it has to be noted that Charles, a devout Catholic and\r\n     persecutor, was emphatically _Teutonic_, according to the\r\n     established canons. His stock was Burgundo-Austrian on the father's\r\n     side; his Spanish mother was of Teutonic descent; he had the fair\r\n     hair, blue eyes, and hanging jaw and lip of the Teutonic Hapsburgs\r\n     (see Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, cap. 341), and so had his\r\n     descendants after him. On the other hand, William the Silent was\r\n     markedly \"Spanish\" in his physiognomy (Motley, p. 56), and his\r\n     reticence would in all ages pass for a Spanish rather than a\r\n     \"Teutonic\" characteristic. Motley is reduced to such shifts of\r\n     rhetoric concerning Philip II as the proposition (p. 75) that \"the\r\n     Burgundian and Austrian elements of his blood seemed to have\r\n     evaporated.\" But his descendant, Philip IV, as seen in the great\r\n     portraits of Velasquez, is, like him, a \"typical\" Teuton; and the\r\n     stock preserved the Teutonic physiological tendency to gluttony, a\r\n     most \"un-Spanish\" characteristic.\r\n\r\n     It is true that, as Buckle argues, the many earthquakes in Spain\r\n     tended to promote superstitious fear; but then on his principles\r\n     the Dutch seafaring habits, and the constant risks and frequent\r\n     disasters of inundation, had the same primary tendency. For the\r\n     rest, the one serious oversight in Buckle's theory of Spanish\r\n     civilisation is his assumption (cp. 3-vol. ed. ii, 455-61; 1-vol.\r\n     ed. p. 550) that Spanish \"loyalty\" was abnormal and continuous from\r\n     the period of the first struggles with the Moors. As to this see\r\n     the present writer's notes in the 1-vol. ed. of Buckle, as cited.\r\n     Even Ferdinand, as an Aragonese, was disrespectfully treated by the\r\n     Castilians (cp. Armstrong as cited, pp. 5, 31, etc.; De Castro,\r\n     _History of Religious Intolerance in Spain_, Eng. tr. 1853, pp. 40,\r\n     41); and Philip I and Charles V set up a new resistance. An alien\r\n     dynasty could set up disaffection in Spain as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     It should be noted, finally, that the stiff ceremonialism which is\r\n     held to be the special characteristic of Spanish royalty was a\r\n     Burgundo-Teutonic innovation, dating from Philip I, and that even\r\n     in the early days of Philip the Cortes petitioned \"that the\r\n     household of the Prince Don Carlos should be arranged on the old\r\n     Spanish lines, and not in the pompous new-fangled way of the House\r\n     of Burgundy\" (Major Hume's _Spain_, p. 127). Prescott (_Philip II_,\r\n     ed. cited, pp. 655, 659) makes the petition refer to the king's own\r\n     household, and shows it to have condemned the king's excessive\r\n     expenditure in very strong terms, saying the expense of his\r\n     household was \"as great as would be required for the conquest of a\r\n     kingdom.\" At the same time the Cortes petitioned against\r\n     bull-fights, which appear to have originated with the Moors, were\r\n     strongly opposed by Isabella the Catholic, and were much encouraged\r\n     by the Teutonic Charles V (U.R. Burke, _History of Spain_, 1895,\r\n     ii, 2-4; Hume's ed. i, 328 _sq._). In fine, the conventional Spain\r\n     is a manufactured system, developed under a Teutonic dynasty. \"To a\r\n     German race of sovereigns Spain finally owed the subversion of her\r\n     national system and ancient freedom\" (Stubbs, _Const. Hist._ 4th\r\n     ed. i, 5).\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Dutch disaffection to Philip, which began to reveal itself\r\nimmediately after his accession, may be conceived as having economic\r\ngrounds. Indeed, his creation of fresh bishoprics, and his manipulation\r\nof the abbey revenues, created instant and general resentment among\r\nchurchmen and nobles,[766] as compared with his mere continuation of\r\nreligious persecution; and despite his pledges to the contrary, certain\r\nposts in the Low Countries were conferred on Spaniards.[767] But had he\r\nshown his father's adaptability, all this could have been adjusted. Had\r\nhe either lived at Brussels or made the Flemings feel that he held them\r\nan integral part of his empire, he would have had the zealous support of\r\nthe upper classes in suppressing the popular heresy, which repelled\r\nthem. Heresy in the Netherlands, indeed, seems thus far to have been on\r\nthe whole rather licentious and anarchic than austere or \"spiritual.\"\r\nThe pre-Protestant movements of the Beguines, Beghards, and Lollards,\r\nbeginning well, had turned out worse than the orders of friars in the\r\nsouth; and the decorous \"Brethren of the Common Lot\" were in the main\r\n\"good churchmen,\" only a minority accepting Protestantism.[768] In face\r\nof the established formulas concerning the innate spirituality of the\r\nTeuton, and of the play of his \"conscience\" in his course at the\r\nReformation, there stand the historic facts that in the Teutonic world\r\nalone was the Reformation accompanied by widespread antinomianism,\r\ndebauchery, and destructive violence. In France, Spain, and Italy there\r\nwere no such movements as the Anabaptist, which so far as it could go\r\nwas almost a dissolution of sane society.[769] From Holland that\r\nmovement drew much of its strength and leadership, even as, in a\r\nprevious age, the antinomian movement of Tanquelin had there had its\r\nmain success.[770] Such was the standing of Dutch Protestantism in 1555;\r\nand no edict against heresy could be more searching and merciless than\r\nthat drawn up by Charles in 1550[771] without losing any upper-class\r\nloyalty. Philip did but strive to carry it out.[772]\r\n\r\nHad Philip, further, maintained a prospect of chronic war for the\r\nnobility of the Netherlands, the accruing chances of wealth[773] would\r\nin all likelihood have sufficed to keep them loyal. In the early wars of\r\nhis reign with France immense gains had been made by them in the way of\r\nransoms and booty. When these ceased, luxury continuing, embarrassment\r\nbecame general.[774] But when Philip's energies were seen to be mainly\r\nbent on killing out heresy, the discontented nobles began to lean to the\r\nside of the persecuted commonalty. At the first formation of the\r\nConfederacy of the \"Beggars\" in 1566, almost the only zealous Protestant\r\namong the leaders was William's impetuous brother Louis of Nassau, a\r\nCalvinist by training, who had for comrade the bibulous Brederode. The\r\nname of \"Gueux,\" given to the malcontents in contempt by the councillor\r\nBerlaimont, had direct application to the known poverty or embarrassment\r\nof the great majority.[775] There was thus undisguisedly at work in the\r\nNetherlands the great economic force which had brought about \"the\r\nReformation\" in all the Teutonic countries; and the needy nobles\r\ninsensibly grew Protestant as it became more and more clear that only\r\nthe lands of the Church could restore their fortunes.[776] This holds\r\ndespite the fact that the more intelligent Protestantism which latterly\r\nspread among the people was the comparatively democratic form set up by\r\nCalvin, which reached the Low Countries through France, finding the\r\nreadier reception among the serious because of the prestige accruing to\r\nits austerity as against the moral disrepute which now covered the\r\nGerman forms.\r\n\r\n[As to the proportional success of Lutheranism and Calvinism, see\r\nMotley, pp. 132, 133; and Grattan, pp. 110, 111. (On p. 110 of Grattan\r\nthere is a transposition of \"second\" and \"third\" groups, which the\r\ncontext corrects.) Motley, an inveterate Celtophobe, is at pains to make\r\nout that the Walloons rebelled first and were first reconciled to Rome,\r\n\"exactly like their Celtic ancestors, fifteen centuries earlier.\" He\r\nomits to comment on the fact that it was only the French form of\r\nProtestantism, that of Calvin, that became viable in the Netherlands at\r\nall, or on the fact that indecent Anabaptism flourished mainly in\r\nFriesland; though he admits that the Lutheran movement left all\r\nreligious rights in the hands of the princes, the people having to\r\nfollow the creed of their rulers. The \"racial\" explanation is mere\r\nobscurantism, here as always. The Walloons of South Flanders were first\r\naffected simply because they were first in touch with Huguenotism. That\r\nthey were never converted in large numbers to Protestantism is later\r\nadmitted by Motley himself (p. 797), who thereupon speaks of the\r\n\"intense attachment to the Roman ceremonial which distinguished the\r\nWalloon population.\" Thus his earlier statement that they had rebelled\r\nagainst \"papal Rome\" is admittedly false. They had rebelled simply\r\nagainst the Spanish tyranny. Yet the false statement is left\r\nstanding--one more illustration of the havoc that may be worked in a\r\nhistorian's intelligence by a prejudice. (For other instances see, in\r\nthe author's volume _The Saxon and the Celt_, the chapters dealing with\r\nMommsen and Burton.)\r\n\r\nIt was the Teutonic-speaking city populations of North Flanders and\r\nBrabant who became Protestants in mass after the troubles had begun\r\n(Motley, p. 798). When the Walloon provinces withdrew from the\r\ncombination against Spain, the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and\r\nYpres joined the Dutch Union of Utrecht. They were one and all reduced\r\nby the skill and power of Alexander of Parma, who thereupon abolished\r\nthe freedom of Protestant worship. The Protestants fled in thousands to\r\nEngland and the Dutch provinces, the remaining population, albeit mostly\r\nTeutonic, becoming Catholic. At this moment one-and-a-half of the\r\nfour-and-a-half millions of Dutch are Catholics; while in Belgium, where\r\nthere are hardly any Protestants, the Flemish-speaking and\r\nFrench-speaking populations are nearly equal in numbers.\r\n\r\nVan Kampen, who anticipated Motley in disparaging the Walloons as being\r\nFrenchly fickle (_Geschichte_, i, 366), proceeds to contend that even\r\nthe Flemings are more excitable than the Dutch and other Teutons; but he\r\nnotes later that as the Dutch poet Cats was much read and imitated in\r\nBelgium, he was thus proved to have expressed the spirit of the whole\r\nNetherlands (ii, 109). Once more, then, the racial theory collapses.]\r\n\r\nThus the systematic savagery of the Inquisition under Philip, for which\r\nthe people at first blamed not at all the king but his Flemish minister,\r\nCardinal Granvelle, served rather to make a basis and pretext for\r\norganised revolt than directly to kindle it. In so far as the people\r\nspontaneously resorted to violence, in the image-breaking riots, they\r\ncompromised and imperilled the nationalist movement in the act of\r\nprecipitating it. The king's personal equation, finally, served to make\r\nan enemy of the masterly William of Orange, who, financially embarrassed\r\nlike the lesser nobility,[777] could have been retained as an\r\nadministrator by a wise monarch. A matter so overlaid with historical\r\ndeclamation is hard to set in a clear light; but it may serve to say of\r\nWilliam that he was made a \"patriot,\" as was Robert the Bruce, by stress\r\nof circumstances;[778] and that in the one case as in the other it was\r\nexceptional character and capacity that made patriotism a success;[779]\r\nWilliam in particular having to maintain himself against continual\r\ndomestic enmity, patrician as well as popular. Nothing short of the\r\nferocity and rapacity of the Spanish attack, indeed, could have long\r\nunited the Netherlands. The first confederacy dissolved at the approach\r\nof Alva, who, strong in soldiership but incapable of a statesmanlike\r\nsettlement, drove the Dutch provinces to extremities by his cruelty,\r\ncaused a hundred thousand artisans and traders to fly with their\r\nindustry and capital, exasperated even the Catholic ministers in\r\nFlanders by his proposed taxes, and finally by imposing them enraged\r\ninto fresh revolt the people he had crushed and terrorised, till they\r\nwere eager to offer the sovereignty to the queen of England. When\r\nRequesens came with pacificatory intentions, it was too late; and the\r\nPacification of Ghent (1576) was but a breathing-space between grapples.\r\n\r\nWhat finally determined the separation and independence of the Dutch\r\nProvinces was their maritime strength. Antwerp, trading largely on\r\nforeign bottoms, represented wealth without the then indispensable\r\nweapons. Dutch success begins significantly with the taking of Brill\r\n(1572) by the gang of William van der Marck, mostly pirates and\r\nruffians, whose methods William of Orange could not endure.[780] But\r\nthey had shown the military basis for the maritime States. It was the\r\nDutch fleet that prevented Parma's from joining \"the\" Armada under\r\nMedina-Sidonia,[781] thereby perhaps saving England. Such military\r\ngenius and energy as Parma's might have made things go hard with the\r\nDutch States had he lived, or had he not been called off against his\r\njudgment to fight in France; but his death well balanced the\r\nassassination of William of Orange, who had thus far been the great\r\nsustainer and welder of the movement of independence. Plotted against\r\nand vilified by the demagogues of Ghent, betrayed by worthless fellow\r\nnobles, Teutonic and French alike; chronically insulted in his own\r\nperson and humiliated in that of his brother John, whom the States\r\ntreated with unexampled meanness; stupidly resisted in his own\r\nleadership by the same States, whose egoism left Maestricht to its fate\r\nwhen he bade them help, and who cast on him the blame when it fell;\r\nthwarted and crippled by the fanaticism and intolerant violence of the\r\nProtestant mobs of the towns; bereaved again and again in the\r\nvicissitude of the struggle, William turned to irrelevance all\r\nimputations of self-seeking; and in his unfailing sagacity and fortitude\r\nhe finally matches any aristocrat statesman in history. Doubtless he\r\nwould have served Philip well had Philip chosen him and trusted him. But\r\nas it lay in one thoroughly able man, well placed for prestige in a\r\ncrisis, to knit and establish a new nation, so it lay in one fanatical\r\ndullard[782] to wreck half of his own empire, with the greatest captains\r\nof his age serving him; and to bring his fabled treasury to ruin while\r\nhis despised rebels grew rich.\r\n\r\n     As to the vice of the Dutch constitution, the principle of the\r\n     supremacy of \"State rights,\" see M'Cullagh, p. 215; Motley, _Rise_,\r\n     pp. 794, 795 (Pt. vi, ch. ii, _end_), and _United Netherlands_, ed.\r\n     1867, iv, 564. Wicquefort (_L'histoire des Provinces-Unies_, La\r\n     Haye, 1719, pp. 5, 16), following Grotius, laid stress long ago on\r\n     the fact that the Estates of each province recognised no superior,\r\n     not even the entire body of the Republic. It was only the measure\r\n     of central government set up in the Burgundo-Austrian and Spanish\r\n     periods that made the Seven Provinces capable of enough united\r\n     action to repel Spanish rule during a chronic struggle of eighty\r\n     years. Cp. Van Kampen (i, 304), who points out (p. 306) that the\r\n     word \"State\" first appears in Holland in the fifteenth century. It\r\n     arose in Flanders in the thirteenth, and in Brabant in the\r\n     fourteenth. Only in 1581, after some years of war, did the United\r\n     Provinces set up a General Executive Council. In the same year the\r\n     Prince of Orange was chosen sovereign (Motley, pp. 838, 841).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. _The Supremacy of Dutch Commerce_\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Flanders by Alexander of Parma, reducing its plains to\r\nwolf-haunted wildernesses, and driving the great mass of the remaining\r\nartisans from its ruined towns,[783] helped to consummate the prosperity\r\nof the United Provinces, who took over the industry of Ghent with the\r\ncommerce of Antwerp.[784] Getting the start of all northern Europe in\r\ntrade, they had become at the date of their assured independence the\r\nchief trading State in the world. Whatever commercial common sense the\r\nworld had yet acquired was there in force. And inasmuch as the wealth\r\nand strength of these almost landless States, with their mostly poor\r\nsoil and unavoidably heavy imposts, depended so visibly on quantity of\r\ntrade turnover, they not only continued to offer a special welcome to\r\nall immigrants, but gradually learned to forego the congenial Protestant\r\nstrife of sects. It was indeed a reluctantly-learned lesson. Even as\r\nlocal patriotisms constantly tended to hamper unity during the very\r\nperiod of struggle, so the primary spirit of self-assertion set the\r\nruling Calvinistic party upon persecuting not only Catholics and\r\nLutherans, but the new heresy of Arminianism:[785] so little does\r\n\"patriotic\" warfare make for fraternity in peace. The judicial murder of\r\nthe statesman John van Olden Barneveldt (1619) at the hands of Maurice\r\nof Orange, whom he had guarded in childhood and trained to\r\nstatesmanship, was accomplished as a sequel to the formal proscription\r\nof the Arminian heresy in the Synod of Dort; and Barneveldt was formally\r\ncondemned for \"troubling God's Church\" as well as on the charge of\r\ntreason.[786] On the same pretexts Grotius was thrown into prison; and\r\nthe freedom of the press was suspended.[787] It was doubtless the shame\r\nof the memory of the execution of Barneveldt (the true founder of the\r\nRepublic as such),[788] on an absolutely false charge of treason, and\r\nthe observation of how, as elsewhere, persecution drove away population,\r\nthat mainly wrought for the erection of tolerance (at least as between\r\nProtestant sects) into a State principle.\r\n\r\nThe best side of the Dutch polity was its finance, which was a lesson to\r\nall Europe. Already in the early stages of the struggle with Spain, the\r\nStates were able on credit to make war, in virtue of their character for\r\ncommercial honour. Where the king of Spain, with all his revenues\r\nmortgaged past hope,[789] got from the Pope an absolution from the\r\npayment of interest on the sums borrowed from Spanish and Genoese\r\nmerchants, and so ruined his credit,[790] the Dutch issued tin money and\r\npaper money, and found it readily pass current with friends and\r\nfoes.[791]\r\n\r\nOf all the Protestant countries, excepting Switzerland, the Dutch States\r\nalone disposed of their confiscated church lands in the public\r\ninterest.[792] There was indeed comparatively little to sell,[793] and\r\nthe money was sorely needed to carry on the war; but the transaction\r\nseems to have been carried through without any corruption. It was the\r\nsuggestion of what might be accomplished in statecraft by the new\r\n_expertise_ of trade, forced into the paths of public spirit and checked\r\nby a stress of public opinion such as had never come into play in\r\nVenice. Against such a power as Spain, energy ruled by unteachable\r\nunintelligence, a world-empire financed by the expedients of provincial\r\nfeudalism, the Dutch needed only an enduring resentment to sustain them,\r\nand this Philip amply elicited. Had he spent on light cruisers for the\r\ndestruction of Dutch commerce the treasure he wasted on the Armadas\r\nagainst England and on his enormous operations by land, typified in the\r\nmonstrous siege of Antwerp, he might have struck swiftly and surely at\r\nthe very arteries of Dutch life; but in yielding to them the command of\r\ntheir primary source and channel of wealth, the sea, he insured their\r\nultimate success. In the Franco-Spanish war of 1521-25 the French\r\ncruisers nearly ruined the herring fishery of Holland and Zealand;[794]\r\nand it was doubtless the memory of that plight that set the States on\r\nmaintaining predominant power at sea.[795]\r\n\r\nThroughout the war, which from first to last spread over eighty years,\r\nthe Dutch commerce grew while that of Spain dwindled. Under Charles V,\r\nFlanders and Brabant alone had paid nearly two-thirds of the whole\r\nimperial taxation of the Netherlands;[796] but after a generation or\r\ntwo the United Provinces must have been on an equality of financial\r\nresources with those left under Spanish rule, even in a state of peace.\r\nYet in this posture of things there had grown up a burden which\r\nrepresented, in the warring commercial State, the persistent principle\r\nof class parasitism; for at the Peace of Muenster (1648) the funded\r\npublic debt of the province of Holland alone amounted to nearly\r\n150,000,000 florins, bearing interest at five per cent.[797] Of this\r\nannual charge, the bulk must have gone into the pockets of the wealthier\r\ncitizens, who had thus secured a mortgage on the entire industry of the\r\nnation. All the while, Holland was nominally rich in \"possessions\"\r\nbeyond sea. When, in 1580, Philip annexed Portugal, with which the Dutch\r\nhad hitherto carried on a profitable trade for the eastern products\r\nbrought as tribute to Lisbon, they began to cast about for an Asiatic\r\ntrade of their own, first seeking vainly for a north-east passage. The\r\nneed was heightened when in 1586 Philip, who as a rule ignored the\r\npresence of Dutch traders in his ports under friendly flags, arrested\r\nall the Dutch shipping he could lay hands on;[798] and when in 1594 he\r\nclosed to them the port of Lisbon, he forced them to a course which his\r\nsuccessors bitterly rued. In 1595 they commenced trading by the Cape\r\npassage to the Indies, and a fleet sent out by Spain to put down their\r\nenterprise was as usual defeated.[799] Then arose a multitude of\r\ncompanies for the East Indian trade, which in 1602 were formed by the\r\ngovernment into a great semi-official joint-stock concern, at once\r\ncommercial and military, reminiscent of the Hanseatic League. The result\r\nwas a long series of settlements and conquests. Amboyna and the Moluccas\r\nwere seized from the Portuguese, now subordinate to Spain; Java, where a\r\nfactory was founded in 1597, was in the next generation annexed; Henry\r\nHudson, an English pilot in the Dutch Company's service, discovered the\r\nHudson River and Bay in 1609, and founded New Amsterdam about 1624. In\r\n1621 was formed the Dutch West India Company, which in fifteen years\r\nfitted out 800 ships of trade and war, captured 545 from the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese, with cargoes valued at 90,000,000 florins, and conquered the\r\ngreater part of what had been the Portuguese empire in Brazil.\r\n\r\nNo such commercial development had before been seen in Europe. About\r\n1560, according to Guicciardini,[800] 500 ships had been known to come\r\nand go in a day from Antwerp harbour in the island of Walcheren; but in\r\nthe spring of 1599, it is recorded, 640 ships engaged solely in the\r\nBaltic trade discharged cargoes at Amsterdam;[801] and in 1610,\r\naccording to Delacourt, there sailed from the ports of Holland in three\r\ndays, on the eastward trade alone, 800 or 900 ships and 1,500 herring\r\nboats.[802] At the date of the Peace of Muenster these figures were left\r\nfar behind, whence had arisen a reluctance to end the war, under which\r\ncommerce so notably flourished. Many Hollanders, further, had been\r\naverse to peace in the belief that it would restore Antwerp and injure\r\ntheir commerce, even as Prince Maurice of Orange, the republic's general\r\nand stadthouder, had been averse to it as likely to lessen his power and\r\nrevenue.[803] But between 1648 and 1669 the trade increased by fifty per\r\ncent.,[804] Holland taking most of the Spanish trade from the shipping\r\nof England and the Hansa, and even carrying much of the trade between\r\nSpain and her colonies. When the Dutch had thus a mercantile marine of\r\n10,000 sail and 168,000 men, the English carried only 27,196 men; and\r\nthe Dutch shipping was probably greater than that of all the rest of\r\nEurope together.[805]\r\n\r\nThis body of trade, as has been seen, was built up by a State which,\r\nbroadly speaking, had a surplus wealth-producing power in only one\r\ndirection, that of fishing; and even of its fishing, much was done on\r\nthe coasts of other nations. In that industry, about 1610, it employed\r\nover 200,000 men; and the Greenland whale fishery, which was a monopoly\r\nfrom 1614 to 1645, began to expand rapidly when set free,[806] till in\r\n1670 it employed 120 ships.[807] For the rest, though the country\r\nexported dairy produce, its total food product was not equal to its\r\nconsumption; and as it had no minerals and no vineyards, its surplus\r\nwealth came from the four sources of fishing, freightage, extorted\r\ncolonial produce, and profits on the handling of goods bought and sold.\r\n_Par excellence_, it was, in the phrase of Louis XIV, the nation of\r\nshopkeepers, of middlemen; and its long supremacy in the business of\r\nbuying cheap and selling dear was due firstly to economy of means and\r\nconsumption, and secondarily to command of accumulated money capital at\r\nlow rates of interest. The sinking of interest was the first sign that\r\nthe limits to its commercial expansion were being reached; but it\r\nbelonged to the conditions that, with or without \"empire,\" its advantage\r\nmust begin to fall away as soon as rival States were able to compete\r\nwith it in the economies of \"production\" in the sense of transport and\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\nIn such economies the Dutch superiority grew out of the specially\r\npractical basis of their marine--habitual fishing and the constant use\r\nof canals. There is no better way than the former of building up\r\nseamanship; and just as the Portuguese grew from hardy fishers to daring\r\nnavigators, so the Dutch grew from thrifty fishers and bargemen to\r\nthrifty handlers of sea-freight, surpassing in economy the shippers of\r\nEngland as they did in seamanship the marine of Spain. Broadly speaking,\r\nthe navies which owed most to royal fostering--as those of Spain,\r\nFrance, and in part England--were the later to reach efficiency in the\r\ndegree of their artificiality; and the loss of one great Spanish navy\r\nafter another in storms must be held to imply a lack of due experience\r\non the part of their officers.\r\n\r\n     One of the worst military mistakes of Spain was the creation of\r\n     great galleons in preference to small cruisers. The sight of the\r\n     big ships terrorised the Dutch once, in 1606; but as all existing\r\n     seacraft had been built up in small vessels, there was no\r\n     sufficient science for the navigation of the great ones in stress\r\n     of weather, or even for the building of them on sound lines. The\r\n     English and Dutch, on the other hand, fought in vessels of the kind\r\n     they had always been wont to handle, increasing their size only by\r\n     slow degrees. In the reign of Henry VIII, again, nothing came of\r\n     the English expeditions of discovery fitted out by him (Schanz,\r\n     _Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 321), but private voyages were\r\n     successfully made by traders (_id._ pp. 321, 327).\r\n\r\n     In the seventeenth century, however, and until far on in the\r\n     eighteenth, all Dutch shipping was more economically managed than\r\n     the English. In all likelihood the Dutch traders knew and improved\r\n     upon the systematic control of ship-construction which the\r\n     Venetians and Genoese had first copied from the Byzantines, and in\r\n     turn developed. (Above, p. 197.) Raleigh was one of the first to\r\n     point out that the broad Dutch boats carried more cargo with fewer\r\n     hands than those of any other nation (_Observations touching\r\n     Trade_, in _Works_, ed. 1829, viii, 356). Later in the century\r\n     Petty noted that the Dutch practised freight-economies and\r\n     adaptations of every kind, having different sorts of vessels for\r\n     different kinds of traffic (_Essays in Political Arithmetic_\r\n     [1690], ed. 1699, pp. 179, 180, 182, 183). This again gave them the\r\n     primacy in shipbuilding for the whole of Europe (_Memoires de Jean\r\n     De Witt_, ptie. i, ch. vi), though they imported all the materials\r\n     for the purpose. When Colbert began navy-building, his first care\r\n     was to bring in Dutch shipwrights (Dussieux, _Etude biographique\r\n     sur Colbert_, 1886, p. 101). Compare, as to the quick sailing of\r\n     the Dutch, Motley, _United Netherlands_, ed. 1867, iv, 556. In the\r\n     next century the English marine had similar economic advantages\r\n     over the French, which was burdened by royal schemes for\r\n     multiplying seamen (see Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 37).\r\n\r\n     The frugality which pervaded the whole of Dutch life may, however,\r\n     have had one directly disastrous effect. Sir William Temple noted\r\n     that the common people were poorly fed (_Observations upon the\r\n     United Provinces_, ch. iv: Works, ed. 1814, i, 133, 147); and\r\n     though their fighting ships were manned by men of all nations, the\r\n     tendency was to feed them in the native fashion. Such a practice\r\n     would tell fatally in the sea-fights with the English. Cp.\r\n     Gardiner, _Commonwealth and Protectorate_, ii, 123.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this expertness in handling, the Dutch traders seem to\r\nhave bettered the lesson taught them by the practice of the Hansa, as to\r\nthe importance of keeping up a high character for probity. At a time\r\nwhen British goods were open to more or less general suspicion as being\r\nof short measure or bad quality,[808] the Dutch practice was to insure\r\nby inspection the right quality and quantity of all packed goods,\r\nespecially the salted herrings, which were still the largest source of\r\nDutch income.[809] And that nothing might be left undone to secure the\r\nconcourse of commerce to their ports, they maintained under almost every\r\nstress[810] of financial hardship the principle of minimum duties on\r\nimports of every description. The one notable exception to this policy\r\nof practically free trade--apart from the monopoly of the trade in the\r\nIndies--was the quite supererogatory veto on the importation of fish\r\nfrom other countries at a time when most of the fishing of Northern\r\nEurope was in Dutch hands.[811] Where imports were desirable they were\r\nencouraged. Thus it came about that landless Amsterdam was the chief\r\nEuropean storehouse for grain, and treeless Holland the greatest centre\r\nof the timber trade. Before such a spectacle the average man held up his\r\nhands and confessed the incomparable ingenuity of the Hollanders. But\r\nothers saw and stated the causation clearly enough. \"Many writing on\r\nthis subject,\" remarks Sir William Petty, \"do magnifie the Hollanders\r\nas if they were more, and all other nations less, than men, as to the\r\nmatters of trade and policy; making them angels, and all others fools,\r\nbrutes, and sots, as to those particulars; whereas,\" he continues,\r\ngiving a sound lesson in social science to his generation, \"I take the\r\nfoundation of their achievements to be originally in the situation of\r\nthe country, whereby they do things inimitable by others, and have\r\nadvantages whereof others are incapable.\"[812] And Sir Josiah Child, of\r\nthe same generation, declared similarly against transcendentalism in\r\nsuch matters. \"If any,\" he roundly declares, \"shall tell me it is the\r\nnature of those people to be thrifty, I answer, _all men by nature are\r\nalike_; it is only laws, custom, and education that differ men; their\r\nnature and disposition, and the disposition of all people in the world,\r\nproceed from their laws.\"[813] For \"laws\" read \"circumstances and\r\ninstitutions,\" adding reservations as to climate and temperament and\r\nvariation of _individual_ capacity and bias, and the proposition is the\r\nessence of all sociology. Economic lessons which Petty and Child could\r\nnot master have since been learned; but their higher wisdom has hardly\r\nyet been assimilated.\r\n\r\nThe sufficient proof that Holland had no abnormal enlightenment even in\r\ncommerce was that, like her rivals, she continued to maintain the system\r\nof monopoly companies. Her \"empire\" in the East, to which was falsely\r\nascribed so much of her wealth, in reality stood for very little sound\r\ncommerce. The East India Company being conducted on high monopoly lines,\r\nthe profits were made rather through the smallness than the greatness of\r\nthe trade done. Thus, while the Company paid enormous dividends,[814]\r\nthe imports of spice were kept at a minimum, in order to maintain the\r\nprice, large quantities being actually destroyed for the purpose. For a\r\ntime they contrived to raise pepper to double the old Portuguese\r\nprice.[815] Such methods brought it about that when the republic had in\r\nall 10,000 sail, the East India trade employed only ten or twelve\r\nships.[816] All the while the small class of capitalists who owned the\r\nshares were able to satisfy the people that the merely monetary and\r\nfactitious riches thus secured to the Company's shareholders was a form\r\nof public wealth.[817]\r\n\r\n     It is a complete error to say, as did Professor Seeley (_Expansion\r\n     of England_, p. 112), that Holland \"made her fortune in the world\"\r\n     because the war with Spain \"threw open to her attack the whole\r\n     boundless possessions of her antagonist in the New World, which\r\n     would have been closed to her in peace. By conquest she made for\r\n     herself an empire, and this empire made her rich.\" In the first\r\n     place it was not in the New World that she mainly sought her\r\n     empire, but in the East Indies, in the sphere of the Portuguese\r\n     conquests. Her hold of Brazil lasted only from 1621 to 1654, and\r\n     was not a great source of wealth, though she captured much Spanish\r\n     and Portuguese shipping. But even her eastern trade was, as we have\r\n     seen, small in quantity, and as a source of wealth was not to be\r\n     compared with the herring fishery. In 1601 John Keymor declared\r\n     that more wealth was produced by the northern fisheries \"in one\r\n     year than the King of Spain hath in four years out of the Indies\"\r\n     (_Observations made upon the Dutch Fishing about the Year\r\n     1601_--reprint in _Phoenix_, 1707, i, 225). The Dutch takings in\r\n     six months' fishing were then reckoned at 3,600,000 barrels, valued\r\n     at as many pounds sterling (_id._ p. 224); the fishing fleet\r\n     numbered 4,100 sail of all kinds, with over 3,000 tenders, out of a\r\n     roughly estimated total of 20,000; while the whole Indian fleet is\r\n     stated at only 40 or 50, employing 5,000 or 6,000 men (_id._ p.\r\n     223), as against a total of some 200,000 of Dutch seafaring\r\n     population. Howell, writing in 1622 (ed. Bennett, 1891, vol. i,\r\n     205), also puts the Amsterdam ships in the Indian trade at 40.\r\n     Professor Seeley's statement cannot have proceeded on any\r\n     comparison of the European Dutch trade with the revenue from the\r\n     conquered \"empire.\" It stands for an endorsement of the vulgar\r\n     delusion that \"possessions\" are the great sources of a nation's\r\n     wealth, though Seeley elsewhere (p. 294) protests against the\r\n     \"bombastic language of this school,\" and notes that \"England is\r\n     not, directly at least, any the richer\" for her connection with her\r\n     \"dependencies.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the class-interest behind the East India Company the republican\r\nparty, as led and represented by De Witt, were strongly arrayed. They\r\ncould point to the expansion of the Greenland whaling trade that had\r\nfollowed on the abolition of the original monopoly in that adventure--an\r\nincrease of from ten to fifteen times the old quantity of\r\nproduct[818]--and the treatise expounding their policy strongly\r\ncondemned the remaining monopolies of all kinds. But there was no\r\nsufficient body of enlightened public opinion to support the attack; and\r\nthe menaced interests spontaneously turned to the factor which could\r\nbest maintain them against such pressure--the military power of the\r\nHouse of Orange. The capitalist monopolists and \"imperialists\" of the\r\nrepublic were thus the means first of artificially limiting its economic\r\nbasis, and later of subverting its republican constitution--a disservice\r\nwhich somewhat outweighs the credit earned by them, as by the merchant\r\noligarchies of Venice, for an admirable management of their army.[819]\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. _Home and Foreign Policy_\r\n\r\nThe vital part played by William the Silent at the outset of the war of\r\nindependence gave his house a decisive predominance in the affairs of\r\nthe republic, grudging as had often been its support of him during life.\r\nAs always, the state of war favoured the rule of the imperator, once the\r\ninstitution had been established. Fanatical clergy and populace alike\r\nwere always loud in support of the lineage of the Deliverer; and with\r\ntheir help William's son Maurice was able to put to death Barneveldt.\r\nThen and afterwards, accordingly, war was more or less the Orange\r\ninterest; and after the Peace of Muenster we find the republican party\r\nsedulous at once to keep the peace and to limit the power of the\r\nhereditary stadthouder. The latter, William II, aged twenty-four, having\r\non his side the great capitalists, tried force in a fashion which\r\npromised desperate trouble,[820] but died at the crisis (1650), his only\r\nchild being born a week after his death.\r\n\r\nIt was substantially the pressure of the Orange interest, thus situated,\r\nthat led to the first naval war between Holland and England, both then\r\nrepublics, and both Protestant. Orangeist mobs, zealous for Charles I,\r\nas the father of the Princess of Orange, insulted the English republican\r\nambassadors who had come to negotiate on Cromwell's impossible scheme\r\nfor a union of the two republics; and the prompt result was the\r\nNavigation Act, intended[821] to hurt Dutch commerce. It was really\r\npowerless for that purpose; but the Dutch people in general believed\r\notherwise, and, being not only independent but bellicose, they were as\r\nready as Puritan England for a struggle at sea. While, however, they\r\nheld their ground in the main as fighters, they suffered heavily in\r\ntheir trade. By 1653 they had lost over sixteen hundred ships through\r\nEnglish privateering; so that the two years of the English war had done\r\nthem more injury than the eighty years of the Spanish.[822] Accordingly,\r\nthough forced again to war by Charles II, the republican party put it as\r\na maxim of policy that Dutch prosperity depended on peace.[823] It is\r\nnevertheless one of the tragedies of their history that John de Witt,\r\nthe great statesman who owed most heed to this maxim, was inveigled by\r\nthe English Government into an ill-judged alliance against France,[824]\r\nand was then deserted by England, whereupon the republic was invaded by\r\nFrance, and De Witt was murdered by his own people. Of all the nations\r\nof Europe the Dutch were then the best educated; but no more than\r\nancient Athens had their republic contrived to educate its mob. The\r\nresult was a frightful moral catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIt is easy at this time of day to find fault with De Witt's policy of\r\ntwo hundred years ago, but hard to reckon aright the practical\r\npossibilities of his situation. Suffice it to say that the formation of\r\nthe Triple Alliance of Holland, England, and Sweden against Louis XIV\r\nproved a ruinous mistake. France had supported the republic against\r\nSpain; and Louis had stood by it when Charles II invited him to join in\r\ndismembering it. Yet, after sending its fleet up the Medway and forcing\r\nCharles to the humiliating Peace of Breda, and in the full knowledge\r\nthat he hated the republic which had harboured and criticised him, De\r\nWitt was persuaded by Sir William Temple, the English ambassador, to\r\nsign, albeit reluctantly,[825] a treaty of union (1668) which made\r\nFrance a strenuous enemy, and from which Charles nevertheless instantly\r\ndrew back, making secretly a treacherous treaty with Louis, and leaving\r\nHolland open to French invasion. It was the bane of the diplomacy of the\r\nage to be perpetually planning alliances on all hands by way of\r\nmaintaining the \"balance of power\"; and De Witt, while justly suspicious\r\nof England, could not be content to drop the system. His excuse was that\r\nLouis was avowedly bent on the acquisition or control of the Spanish\r\nNetherlands; and that after that there would be small security for the\r\nrepublic. Yet he had better have remained the ally of France than leant\r\non the broken reeds of the friendship of Spain and the English king.\r\nCharles needed only to appeal to the English East India Company, whose\r\nmonopoly was pitted against that of the Dutch Company, to secure a\r\nparliamentary backing for a fresh war with Holland; and the sudden\r\ninvasion of the republic by France (1672) was the ruin of the De Witts.\r\nIt was an Orange mob that murdered them; and the young William of Orange\r\npensioned those who had formally accused them of treason.\r\n\r\nThe action of Charles in 1672 had been a masterpiece of baseness. After\r\nsecretly betraying his Dutch allies to Louis, he caused his own fleet,\r\nbefore war had been declared, to attack a rich Dutch merchant fleet in\r\nthe Channel, with the worthy result of a capture of only two ships. His\r\ndeclaration of war, when made, included such pretexts as that there is\r\n\"scarce a town in their territories that is not filled with abusive\r\npictures and false historical medals and pillars,\" which \"alone were\r\ncause sufficient for our displeasure, and the resentment of all our\r\nsubjects\"; and he alleged breach of a non-existent article in the Treaty\r\nof Breda.[826] It was in this disgraceful war that Shaftesbury gave out\r\nas the true policy of England the maxim of Cato--_Delenda est\r\nCarthago_--and the end of it was that in 1673, after a war without\r\ntriumphs, in which finally the English fleet under Rupert was defeated\r\nby that of the Dutch while the French fleet stood idly by (1673), the\r\nbetrayed betrayer made peace with Holland once more (1674).\r\n\r\nThe hostility of France on the other hand practically ended Dutch\r\nrepublicanism, though at the same time it brought about the wreck of the\r\n\"empire\" of Louis XIV. Had he accepted the submission offered by De\r\nWitt, he might have made a sure ally of Holland as against England. But\r\nhis policy of conquest, insolently formulated by his minister Louvois,\r\nfirst put the Dutch Government in the hands of the Prince of Orange, and\r\nthen turned the English interest, despite the King, against France. It\r\nmay be taken as a law of European politics that any power which\r\narrogantly sets itself to overbear the others will itself, in the course\r\nof one or two generations at furthest, be beaten to its knees. The end\r\nof the insolent aggression of Louis came when, after William had become\r\nKing of England and set up a new tradition of Protestant union against\r\nFrance, the military genius of Marlborough in the next reign reduced\r\nFrance to extremities. Meanwhile Holland was past its period of\r\ncommercial climax, past the ideals of De Witt, past republicanism for\r\nanother era. Henceforth it was to be subservient to its stadthouder,\r\nand to become ultimately a kingdom, on the failure of the republican\r\nmovement at the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5. _The Decline of Commercial Supremacy_\r\n\r\nIt follows from what has been seen of the conditions of its success that\r\nthe Dutch trade could not continue to eclipse that of rival States with\r\ngreater natural sources of wealth when once those States had learned to\r\ncompete with Dutch methods. But it belonged to the culture-conditions\r\nthat the rival States should take long to learn the lesson, and that the\r\nDutch should be the first to adapt themselves to new circumstances. The\r\nblunders of their enemies lengthened the Dutch lease. Louis XIV gave one\r\nlast vast demonstration of what Catholicism can avail to wreck States by\r\nrevoking the Edict of Nantes (1686), and so driving from France a\r\nquarter of a million of industrious subjects, part of whom went to\r\nEngland, many to Switzerland, but most to Holland, conveying their\r\ncapital and their handicrafts with them. The stroke hastened the\r\nfinancial as well as the military exhaustion of France in the next\r\ntwenty-five years. England, on the other hand, maintained its trade\r\nmonopolies, which, with the system of imposts, drove over to the Dutch\r\nand the French much trade that a better policy might have kept.[827] But\r\nall the Dutch advantages were consummated in the command of money\r\ncapital at low rates of interest, and consequent capacity to trade for\r\nsmall profits.\r\n\r\nThis accumulation of money capital was the correlative of the main\r\nconditions of Dutch commerce. A community drawing its income--save for\r\nthe great resource of fishing--from its middleman-profits and\r\nfreightage, and from its manufacture of other nations' raw products in\r\ncompetition with their own manufacture, must needs save credit capital\r\nfor its own commerce' sake. Thus, whereas the earlier Flemings were\r\nluxurious in their expenditure,[828] the Dutch middle-class were the\r\nmost frugal in north-western Europe,[829] their one luxury being the\r\nlaudable one of picture-buying. But when, through mere increase of\r\npopulation and consequently of trade, interest gradually fell[830] in\r\nthe rival communities, who in turn could practise fishing, who had\r\nbetter harbours, who extended their marine commerce, began to\r\nmanufacture for themselves, and had natural resources for barter and\r\nproduction that Holland wholly lacked, the Dutch trade slowly but surely\r\nfell away. And as against the sustaining force of their frugality and\r\ntheir systematic utilisation of their labour-power, the Dutch lay under\r\nburdens which outweighed even those imposed on France and England by bad\r\ngovernment. Not only did the national debt force a multiplication of\r\nimposts on every article of home consumption,[831] but the constant cost\r\nof the maintenance of the sea-dykes was a grievous natural tax from\r\nwhich there was no escape. Nor would the creditor class on any score\r\nconsent to forego their bond.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that after the Peace of Utrecht (1713), which left\r\nHolland deeper in debt than ever, there was an admitted decline in the\r\nnational turnover from decade to decade. It is one of the fallacies of\r\nthe non-economic interpretation of history to speak of the United\r\nProvinces as thenceforth showing a moral \"languor\";[832] the rational\r\nexplanation is that their total economic nutrition was curtailed by the\r\ncompeting environment. Yet it must be admitted that the merchant class\r\nthemselves, when called on by the stadthouder William IV to compare\r\nnotes as to the decline, showed little recognition of the natural causes\r\nbeyond dwelling on the effect of heavy taxes, which had been insisted on\r\nlong before by the party of De Witt.[833] Dwelling as they do on the\r\nvalue of the old maxims of toleration, which were now beside the case,\r\nand failing to realise that the sheer produce of the other countries was\r\na decisive factor in competition, they seem to invite such a reaction in\r\neconomic theory as was set up by the French Physiocrats, who laid their\r\nfinger on this as the central fact in industrial life.\r\n\r\n     France, indeed, had learned other vital lessons after the great\r\n     defeat of Louis XIV. Nothing in the history of that age is more\r\n     remarkable than the fashion in which the immense blunder of the\r\n     Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was _pro tanto_ cured under the\r\n     Regency and under Louis XV by the infiltration of fresh population.\r\n     Dean Tucker noted, what the Dutch merchants apparently did not,\r\n     that \"Flanders, all Germany on this side of the Rhine, Switzerland,\r\n     Savoy, and some parts of Italy, pour their supernumerary hands\r\n     every year into France\" (_Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 27). At that\r\n     time (1750) there were said to be 10,000 Swiss and Germans in Lyons\r\n     alone, and the numbers of immigrants in all the commercial towns\r\n     were increasing (_id._ pp. 27, 28), the Government having become\r\n     \"particularly gentle and indulgent to foreigners.\" At that period,\r\n     too, the French peasantry were prolific (_id._ p. 45).\r\n\r\nAbove all, the Dutch Provinces were bound to be outclassed in\r\nmanufactures by England when England began to manufacture by machinery\r\nand by steam. Anciently well-forested,[834] they had long been nearly\r\nbare of wood, so that their fuel had become, as it still is, scarce and\r\nexpensive.[835] They had done wonders with windmills; but when coal came\r\ninto play as driving power the coal-producing State was bound to\r\ntriumph. It must, however, be kept on record that when England's\r\ncommerce had thus begun to distance that of her old rival in virtue of\r\nher mere economic basis, Englishmen were none the less ready to resort\r\nto wanton aggression. Throughout the eighteenth century the ideal of\r\nmonopoly markets continued to rule in Europe; and that ideal it was that\r\ninspired the struggles of France and England for the possession of India\r\nand North America. In the course of those imperialist wars the\r\nGovernment of the elder Pitt gave to privateers the right to confiscate,\r\nas \"contraband of war,\" nearly all manner of commerce between France and\r\nother nations, and in particular that of Holland, Pitt's aim being to\r\nforce the Dutch into his alliance against France. The injury thus\r\nwrought to their trade was enormous. \"Perhaps at no time in history were\r\nmore outrageous injuries perpetrated on a neutral nation than those\r\nwhich the Dutch suffered from the English during the time of the elder\r\nPitt's administration.\"[836] It was the method of imperialism; and the\r\nusual sequel was at hand in the revolt of the American Colonies. In that\r\ncrisis also, because the Dutch Council of State, despite the wish of the\r\nstadthouder, refused to take part against the Colonies, the English\r\nGovernment as before gave letters of marque to privateers, and told the\r\nplundered Dutch that if they increased their fleet to protect their own\r\ncommerce the action would be taken as hostile. \"In 1779 the English\r\ncommander, Fielding, captured the Dutch mercantile fleet, with four\r\nDutch men-of-war; and in 1780 Yorke, the English Ambassador at The\r\nHague, demanded subsidies from the States, whom his Government had just\r\nbefore plundered.\"[837]\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Dutch wealth and power had greatly dwindled before this\r\ninsult was ventured on by the rival people. Holland's primary source of\r\nwealth, the fisheries, had been in large part appropriated by other\r\nnations, in particular by Britain, now her great competitor in that as\r\nwell as in other directions.[838] But all the while Holland's own\r\n\"empire\" was a main factor in her weakening. Deaf to the doctrine of De\r\nWitt, her rulers had continued to keep the East Indian trade on a\r\nmonopoly basis, ruling their spice islands as cruelly and as\r\nblindly[839] as any rival could have done; and it was the false\r\neconomics and false finance bound up with their East India Company that\r\nruined the great Bank of Amsterdam, which at the French Revolution was\r\nfound to have gambled away all its funds in the affairs of the Company,\r\nin breach of the oath of the magistrates, who were the sworn custodians\r\nof the treasure. So situated, the Government could or would make no\r\neffort in the old fashion against English tyranny. The State's economic\r\nbasis being in large part gone, and the capitalistic interest incapable\r\nof unifying or inspiring the nation, Holland had, so to speak, to begin\r\nlife over again. But it would be a delusion to suppose that the\r\npolitical decline meant misery; on the contrary, there was much less of\r\nthat in Holland than in triumphant England. There were still wealthy\r\ncitizens, as indeed always happens in times of decline of general\r\nwealth. At that very period \"the Dutch were the largest creditors of any\r\nnation in Europe\";[840] and Smith in 1776 testified that Holland was \"in\r\nproportion to the extent of the land and the number of its inhabitants\r\nby far the richest country in Europe,\" adding that it \"has accordingly\r\nthe greatest share of the carrying trade of Europe,\"[841] and again that\r\nits capitalists had much money in British stocks. But these were not as\r\nbroad foundations as the old; nor were they easily expansible, or even\r\nmaintainable. As soon, indeed, as the rise of other national debts\r\nenabled them to invest abroad, they did so. Temple has recorded how,\r\nwhen any part of the home debt was being paid off in his time, the\r\nscripholders \"received it with tears, not knowing how to dispose of it\r\nto interest with such safety and ease.\" England soon began to relieve\r\nthem of such anxiety. But though Holland could thus gain from the\r\nannual interest-tribute paid by borrowing States, as England does at\r\nthis moment, such income in a time of shrinking industry stands only for\r\nthe idle life of the endowed class, a factor neither industrially nor\r\nintellectually wholesome. At the beginning of the seventeenth century\r\nKeymor, an English observer who studied Dutch commercial life closely,\r\nexclaimed: \"And not a Beggar there; everyone getting his own Living is\r\nadmirable to behold.\"[842] This seems to have been an exaggeration,\r\nsince in 1619 we find Howell praising the \"strictness of their laws\r\nagainst mendicants, and their hospitals of all sorts for young and old,\r\nboth for the relief of the one and the employment of the other.\"[843]\r\nLater there grew up, however carefully provided for,[844] a notably\r\nlarge pauper population; and so late as 1842 Laing, who liked Holland,\r\nwrote of it as \"a country full of capitalists and paupers.\"[845] In the\r\nmain, modern Dutch life has of necessity had to find sounder bases; and\r\nthe chief feature in it during the past generation has been the new and\r\ngreat industrial expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6. _The Culture Evolution_\r\n\r\nFrom first to last the culture-history of Holland illustrates clearly\r\nenough the importance of the freer political life to the life of the\r\nmind. It is in the period of independence that Holland begins to play a\r\ngreat part in European culture. Previously, the multitude of popular\r\n\"chambers of rhetoric,\"[846] and so forth, yielded no fine fruits; but\r\nin the stress of self-government the republic begins to produce\r\nscholars, thinkers, and men of science, who affect those of surrounding\r\nnations. Already in 1584, when nothing of the kind existed in France or\r\nEngland, a Dutch literary academy published a Dutch grammar;[847] and\r\nthe republic was \"the peculiarly learned State of Europe throughout the\r\nseventeenth century,\"[848] producing more of original classical research\r\nand scholarly teaching in its small sphere than any other. Freedom and\r\nendowment of university teaching brought in such Germans as Gronovius\r\nand Graevius; and Leibnitz looked to little Holland as a model in many\r\nthings for backward Germany.[849] Printing became one of the industries\r\nof the country; and the Elzevirs were long the great classic publishers\r\nfor Europe. Free universities and a free press, indeed, were the main\r\nconditions of the Dutch classical renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of progress in _belles lettres_, on the other hand, being\r\nless propitious, the development was inferior. All Europe could buy\r\nLatin books printed in Holland; but few foreigners read Dutch, and the\r\nfiner native literature was sustained only by the necessarily small\r\nclass which had both leisure and culture. The very devotion to culture\r\nwhich, as was claimed by Grotius, made the well-to-do Dutch in his youth\r\nthe greatest students of languages in Europe,[850] wrought rather for\r\nthe importation of foreign literature than the fostering or elevation of\r\nthe native. So that though the Catholic poetess Anna Bijns,[851] and\r\nlater the Catholic Spreghel, \"the Dutch Ennius\" (1549-1612), and Hooft,\r\n\"the Dutch Tacitus\" (1581-1647), made worthy beginnings, there was no\r\ngreat florescence. In the terms of the case, the two former represent\r\nthe general Catholic culture-influence; and Hooft, eminent alike as poet\r\nand historian, owed his artistic stimulus to the three youthful years he\r\nspent in Italy studying Italian literature.[852] Of the more celebrated\r\nnative poets, Cats is prosaic, though to this day highly popular,\r\nsuiting as he does the plane of taste developed under a strenuous\r\ncommercialism; and Vondel alone, by his influence on Milton, enters into\r\nthe blood of outside European literature.\r\n\r\nFanatical Calvinism,[853] again, was not primarily favourable to\r\nphilosophic thought; and it is to the influence of Descartes, who made\r\nHolland his home for many years, that the possibility of the later great\r\nperformance of Spinoza is to be ascribed. But the impulse, once given,\r\nand sustained by such an atmosphere as was set up by Bayle and other\r\nFrench refugees, developed a new culture-force; and in the eighteenth\r\ncentury the Dutch press was a disseminator of French and English\r\nrationalism, as well as of the classic erudition which still flourished.\r\nAll along, though none of the supreme names in science is Dutch,\r\nscientific culture was in general higher than elsewhere.[854] Such\r\ninfluences made afresh for a revival of native literature, and\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century it is the foreign stimulus that is\r\nseen at work. Thus Van Effen (1684-1725) read much English and wrote\r\nmuch French, but was also the best Dutch writer of his time; the\r\nbrothers Van Haren (1710-79) were diplomatists, and friends of Voltaire;\r\nand the two lady novelists, Wolff and Deken, produced their three\r\nadmired books (1782-92) under the influence of Richardson and Goethe.\r\n\r\nBut as against these debts to foreign example, the Dutch Republic in its\r\ntime of flower produced a great and markedly native body of art, which\r\nto this day ranks in its kind with that of the great age in Italy. It\r\nmay have been the example set in the Spanish Netherlands by the Austrian\r\narchdukes, after the severance, that gave the lead to the Dutch growth;\r\nbut there is no imitation and nothing nationally second-rate in their\r\ntotal output. The Flemish Rubens (1577-1640) precedes by twenty-one\r\nyears his pupil Vandyck and the great Spaniard Velasquez, and by nearly\r\nthirty years the Dutch Rembrandt; but no four contemporary masters were\r\never more individual; and the Dutch group of Rembrandt, Hals, Van der\r\nHelst, Gerard Dow, and the rest, will hold its own with the Flemish\r\nswarm headed by Rubens and Vandyck. It is worth while in this connection\r\nto note afresh how closely is art florescence bound up with economic\r\nforces. Dutch and Flemish art, like Italian, is in the first place\r\nsubstantially a product of economic demand, the commercial aristocracy\r\nof the Netherlands commissioning and buying pictures as did the clerical\r\naristocracy of Italy. It has been denied that there is any economic\r\nexplanation for the eventual arrest of great art in the Netherlands; but\r\nwhen we note the special conditions of the case the economic explanation\r\nwill be found decisive.\r\n\r\nGreat art, it is true, always tends to set up a convention, which is the\r\nstoppage of greatness; but even great art can so arrest progress only\r\nwhen the economic and social sphere is curtailed; and the Dutch economic\r\nsphere, as we have seen, was practically non-expansive after the\r\ndisaster of 1672, which date also begins a new period of ruinous war for\r\nFlanders. Rembrandt died in 1664. He and his contemporaries and their\r\npupils had produced a body of painting immense in quantity; and the\r\nlater and poorer generations, having such a body of classic work passed\r\non to them, naturally and necessarily rested on their treasure. The\r\npopulation of the United Provinces, estimated to have reached a\r\nmillion-and-a-half in the Middle Ages,[855] had risen in the great\r\nperiod to three or three-and-a-half millions.[856] From this figure it\r\npositively fell away in the eighteenth century.[857] Here then was a\r\nshrinking population, loaded with old and new debt and overwhelmed with\r\ntaxes, consciously growing poorer, with no prospect of recovery, and\r\nalready stocked with a multitude of pictures[858] by great masters.\r\nThat it should go on commissioning new pictures with the old munificence\r\nwas impossible: it was more concerned to sell than to buy; and what\r\ndemand had elicited lack of demand arrested. There is no clearer\r\nsociological case in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 7. _The Modern Situation_\r\n\r\nAfter all that has come and gone, it is important to realise, in\r\ncorrection of the megalomaniac view of things, that Holland is to-day\r\nliterally larger,[859] more populated,[860] and more productive than she\r\nwas in the \"palmy days\"; and that her colonial \"empire,\" now\r\nadministered on just principles, includes a population of over\r\n30,000,000. Over sixty years ago M'Culloch wrote that \"though their\r\ncommerce be much decayed, the Dutch, even at this moment, are _the\r\nrichest and most comfortable people of Europe_.\"[861] The latter part of\r\nthe statement would not be very far out to-day, though popular comfort\r\nperhaps does not now keep pace with population. Otherwise it no longer\r\nholds. In the latter half of the nineteenth century there began a\r\nvigorous revival of Dutch commerce and industry, Holland becoming once\r\nmore expansive. From 1872 to 1906 Dutch exports, measured by weight,\r\nincreased ninefold, imports sixfold, and transit trade over threefold;\r\nand the expansion steadily continues; the value of the transit trade\r\nrising from 9,392 million guilders in 1906 to 12,684 millions in 1910;\r\nwhile imports increased by nearly 30 per cent and exports by 26 per\r\ncent. Much of this expansion appears to be due to the advantages\r\naccruing to Holland as a free-trade country alongside of protectionist\r\nGermany, whose far greater natural resources redound largely to the gain\r\nof the free-trading neighbour.\r\n\r\nIn detail, the commercial situation of to-day is curiously like the old\r\nat many points. The debt is still relatively great--about L97,000,000\r\nsterling;[862] and about a fourth of the whole expenditure is interest;\r\nanother fourth going for \"defence.\" Always making the best of their\r\nsoil, alike with roots and cereals, the people go on increasing the area\r\nunder cultivation and the yield per hectare.[863] Still, as of old,\r\nmuch food and raw material is imported to be exported again[864]--in\r\nlarge part to Germany. Fishing now employs only 20,000 men with over\r\n5,300[865] boats; the annual product is valued at under L1,000,000; and\r\nof over 10,800 clearances of vessels from Dutch ports in 1910 only 4,533\r\nwere Dutch, representing a total mercantile navy of only 764.[866] But\r\nof Dutch vessels engaged in the carrying trade between foreign ports\r\nthere were 4,383 in 1909,[867] with more than seven times the tonnage of\r\nthe home navy. Thus the nation still subsists largely by playing\r\nmiddleman, partly by manufactures, partly by dairy and other produce,\r\nlittle by fishing,[868] but still largely by freightage. Java does not\r\nfigure as a source of revenue for Holland, being administered in its own\r\ninterest,[869] with less taxation of the people than goes on in British\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nOf the conditions which in Holland tell against increase of well-being,\r\nthe most notable is the large birth-rate resulting there as elsewhere\r\nfrom the rapid modern expansion of industry. With a population less by\r\n1,580,000 than that of Belgium, Holland has annually a larger surplus of\r\nbirths over deaths. It may be interesting to compare Dutch statistics\r\nwith those of Portugal and Sweden, which have nearly the same\r\npopulation, as regards birth-rate and emigration. Each of the three\r\nStates at 1895 had slightly over or under 5,000,000 inhabitants; and in\r\n1909 slightly over or under 6,000,000. Their marriages and their\r\nemigration were:--\r\n\r\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                           Marriages.      |          Emigration.\r\n   ----------------------------------------+----------------------------\r\n              |Portugal.| Holland.| Sweden.| Portugal.| Holland.|Sweden.\r\n   -----------+---------+---------+--------+----------+---------+-------\r\n   1895       | 33,018  |  35,598 | 28,728 |  44,746  |  1,314  |14,982\r\n              |         |         |        |          |         |\r\n   1908, 1909,|         |         |        |          |         |\r\n     or 1910  | 34,150  |  42,740 | 33,131 |  40,056  |  3,220  |23,529\r\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe emigration from Portugal in 1895 was abnormal; but in 1896 the\r\nfigures were 24,212, and in 1907 they reached 41,950. In Sweden in 1895\r\nthe excess of births over deaths was as high as 60,000. In Portugal it\r\nwas 47,997; a figure which in 1896 fell to 38,134; rising again to\r\n64,312 in 1909. In Holland, the average excess in 1879-84 was 54,751; in\r\n1897 it had risen to 77,586; in 1909 to 90,483. Under such circumstances\r\nit needs the alleged doubling of Dutch commerce between 1872 and 1891,\r\nand the subsequent continued expansion, to maintain well-being. As it\r\nis, despite the tradition of good management of the poor, the number of\r\nthe needy annually relieved temporarily or continuously by the\r\ncharitable societies and communes[870] appears to be always over five\r\nper cent. of the population--or about twice the average proportion of\r\npaupers in the United Kingdom. The Dutch figures of course do not stand\r\nfor the same order of poverty; and there is certainly not in Holland a\r\nproportional amount of the sordid misery that everywhere fringes the\r\nwealth of England. But it is clear that Holland is becoming relatively\r\nover-populated; and that the industrial conditions are not making\r\nsteadily for popular elevation, standing as they do for low wages and\r\ngrinding competition in many occupations.\r\n\r\nNor are these conditions favourable in Holland to general culture, as\r\napart from forms of specialism, any more than in England. Dutch experts\r\nin recognised studies latterly hold their own with any--witness the\r\nnames of Kuenen, Tiele, van t'Hoff, de Goeje, de Vries, Dozy, Kern,\r\nLorentz, Waals--and the middle-class has probably a better average\r\nculture than prevails in England or the United States; but the lapsed\r\nRepublic has yet to prove how much a small State may achieve in the\r\nhigher civilisation. Meantime, it is plainly not smallness but too rapid\r\nincrease in numbers that is the stumbling-block; and the possession of a\r\nrelatively great \"empire\" in Java does not avail, for Holland any more\r\nthan for England, to cure the social trouble at home.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: Motley, _Rise of the Dutch Republic_, 1-vol. ed. 1863, p.\r\n18.

Salisbury's translation (1899) of the _Short History_ of Prof.\r\n     Daendliker. It has little merit as literature, but is abreast of\r\n     critical research at all points. For the Reformation period, the\r\n     older history of Vieusseux (Library of Useful Knowledge, 1840) is\r\n     fuller and better, though now superseded as to early times. The\r\n     work of Sir F.O. Adams and C.D. Cunningham on _The Swiss\r\n     Confederation_, 1880 (translated and added to in French by M.\r\n     Loumyer, 1890), is an excellent conspectus, especially for\r\n     contemporary Swiss institutions. As regards the first half of the\r\n     last century, Grote's _Seven Letters concerning the Politics of\r\n     Switzerland_ (1847, rep. 1876) are most illuminating.\r\n\r\n     Of fuller histories there are several in French and German. The\r\n     longer _Geschichte der Schweiz_ of Prof. Daendliker (1884-87) is\r\n     good and instructive, though somewhat commonplace in its thinking.\r\n     Dierauer's _Geschichte der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft_\r\n     (1887), which stops before the Reformation period, is excellent so\r\n     far as it goes, and gives abundant references, which Daendliker's\r\n     does not; though his _Short History_ gives good bibliographies.\r\n\r\n     Zschokke's compendious _Des Schweizerlands Geschichte_ (9te\r\n     Aufgabe, 1853) is lucid and very readable, but is quite uncritical\r\n     as to the medieval period. That is critically and decisively dealt\r\n     with in Rilliet's _Les Origines de la Confederation Suisse_, 1868,\r\n     and in Dierauer.\r\n\r\nIn more than one respect, the political evolution of Switzerland is the\r\nmost interesting in the whole historic field. The physical basis, the\r\ndeterminations set up by it, the reactions, the gradual control of bias,\r\nthe creation of stability out of centrifugal forces--all go to form the\r\ncompletest of all political cases.[871] Happier than those of Greece, if\r\nless renowned, the little clans of Switzerland have passed through the\r\nstorms of outer and inner strife to a state of something like assured\r\nrepublican federation. And where old Greece and Renaissance Italy and\r\nScandinavia have failed to attain to this even on the basis of a common\r\nlanguage and \"race,\" the Swiss Cantons have attained it in despite of a\r\nmaximum diversity of speech and stock. As does Japan for Asia, they\r\ndisprove for Europe a whole code of false generalisations.\r\n\r\nThe primary fact in the case, as in that of Greece, is the physical\r\nbasis. Like Hellas, the Swiss land is \"born divided\"; and the first\r\nquestion that forces itself is as to how the Cantons, while retaining\r\ntheir home rule, have contrived to escape utterly ruinous inter-tribal\r\nstrife, and to attain federal union. The answer, it speedily appears,\r\nbegins with noting the fact that Swiss federation is a growth or\r\naggregation, as it were, from a primary \"cell-form.\" From the early\r\nconfederation of the three Forest Cantons of Schwytz, Uri, and\r\nUnterwalden, a set of specially congruous units, led to alliance by\r\ntheir original isolation from the rest of Helvetia and their common\r\nintercourse through the Lake of Lucerne, came the example and norm for\r\nthe whole. The primary influence of mere land-division is proved by the\r\npersistence of the cantonal spirit and methods to this day;[872] but the\r\nhistory of Switzerland is the history of the social union gradually\r\nforced on the Cantons by varying pressures from outside. That it is due\r\nto no quality of \"race\" is sufficiently proved by the fact that three or\r\nfour languages, and more stocks, are represented in the Republic at this\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. _The Beginnings of Union_\r\n\r\nIn the union of the Forest Cantons, as in the rooting of several Swiss\r\ncities and the cultivation of remote valleys, the Church has been held\r\nto have played a constructive part. At the outset, according to some\r\nhistorians,[873] Schwytz and Uri and Unterwalden had but one church\r\namong them; hence a habit of congregation. But the actual records yield\r\nno evidence for this view, any more than for the other early dicta as to\r\nthe racial distinctness of the people of the Forest Cantons, and their\r\nimmemorial freedom. Broadly speaking, the early Swiss were for the most\r\npart serfs with customary rights. The first documentary trace of them is\r\nin the grant by Louis of Germany to the convent at Zurich, in the year\r\n853, of his _pagellus Uroniae_, with its churches, houses, serfs, lands,\r\nand revenues.[874] This did not constitute the whole of the Canton; but\r\nit seems clear that the bulk of the population were in status serfs,\r\nthough when attached to a royal convent they would have such privileges\r\nas would induce even freemen to accept the same state of\r\ndependence.[875] In the Canton of Schwytz, again, the people--there in\r\nlarger part freemen--seem to have been always more or less at strife\r\nwith the great monastery of Einsiedeln, founded about 946 by Kaiser\r\nOtto, and largely filled by men of aristocratic birth seeking a quiet\r\nlife,[876] who held by the usual interests of their class as well as\r\ntheir corporation.[877] It was a question of ownership of pastures, the\r\nmain economic basis in that region; and the descendants of the early\r\nsettlers were fighting for their subsistence. Unterwalden, finally (then\r\nknown only as the higher and lower valleys, _Stanz_ or _Stannes_ and\r\n_Sarnen_ or _Sarnon_), was led in its development by Uri and Schwytz,\r\neach of which possessed some communal property, the former in respect of\r\nits beginnings as a royal domain, the latter in respect of the\r\nassociation of its freemen.\r\n\r\nWhatever earlier combinations there may have been,[878] it is in the\r\nyear 1291[879] that the first recorded pact was made between the three\r\nCantons; and it arose out of their making a stand for their customary\r\nlocal rights as against the House of Hapsburg.[880] Uri had in 1231 been\r\ngranted by King Henry VII of Germany, son of the emperor Frederick II,\r\nthe cherished privilege of enrolment as an imperial fief, an act which\r\nin theory withdrew it from its former feudal subordination to the Count\r\nof Hapsburg; and in 1240 Frederick himself gave the same privilege to\r\nSchwytz.[881] On the unhinging of the imperial system after Frederick's\r\ndeath, the Hapsburgs, who even in his life had treated the Cantons as\r\ncontumacious vassals, fought for their own claims; whereupon in due\r\ncourse was formed the Pact of 1291. Thus the Swiss Confederation broadly\r\nbegan in the special strife which arose between the new order of higher\r\nfeudal princes and the civic or rural communes on the disintegration of\r\nthe Germanic empire in the thirteenth century.[882] The familiar story\r\nof William Tell and the oath-taking at Ruetli or Gruetli in 1308 appears\r\nto be pure myth. There is no historic mention till over a hundred years\r\nlater of any such acts by the Austrian bailiff as that story turns upon,\r\nor of any strife whatever in 1308. A pact of confederation had actually\r\nbeen made seventeen years earlier than that date; and a new and rather\r\nmore definite pact was made on the same general grounds in 1315; but the\r\nromance of 1308 remains entirely unattested, and it bears the plainest\r\nmarks of myth.\r\n\r\n     The histories of J. von Mueller, Zschokke, Vieusseux, and others of\r\n     the first half of the nineteenth century, are vitiated as regards\r\n     the early period by acceptance of the traditions; though the\r\n     untrustworthiness of the Tell story had been pointed out as early\r\n     as the year 1600 by Franz Guillimann of Fribourg, and again in the\r\n     eighteenth century by Iselin, and by Freudenberger in his\r\n     _Guillaume Tell: Fable danoise_, 1760. (See Daendliker's _Short\r\n     History of Switzerland_, Eng. tr. 1899, pp. 53, 54.) A full and\r\n     decisive examination of it will be found in Rilliet's _Les origines\r\n     de la Confederation Suisse_, 1868. Compare Dierauer, _Geschichte\r\n     der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft_, 1887, Buch ii, Kap. i, Sec.\r\n     iii; Cox, _Mythology of the Aryan Nations_, ed. 1882, pp. 337-41,\r\n     and the essay _William Tell_ in Baring-Gould's _Curious Myths of\r\n     the Middle Ages_, 1888. Some very judicial attempts have been made\r\n     to show that there is reason to think _some_ fighting occurred in\r\n     1308. See, for instance, the pamphlets _Le Gruetli_ and _La querelle\r\n     sur les traditions concernant l'origine de la Confederation\r\n     Suisse_, by Prof. H. Bordier, in reply to Prof. Rilliet, 1869.\r\n     Dierauer, again, declines to go the whole way in negation, and\r\n     stands for the view \"not fable, but legend--on some basis of fact\"\r\n     (as cited, i, 150). But even M. Bordier reduces Tell to a mere\r\n     \"somebody\"; and every student surrenders the apple story, which is\r\n     at least as old as the twelfth-century Danish version of it in Saxo\r\n     Grammaticus.\r\n\r\n     M. Rilliet holds that the Swiss reproduction was not a local\r\n     survival of the Teutonic myth, but a deliberate adaptation made in\r\n     Lucerne from the abridgment of Saxo Grammaticus produced by a\r\n     German monk, Gheysmer, about 1430 (_Les origines_, pp. 214-16, 327,\r\n     328). At Lucerne there was a local school of poetry of the kind\r\n     then common in Holland; and the old ballad, which closely follows\r\n     Saxo's tale, and which is the probable basis of the story as given\r\n     in the later chronicles, seems to have been composed by way of\r\n     securing for the Canton of Uri the main honours of the founding of\r\n     the Confederation, which were being claimed by the sister Cantons.\r\n     Whatever be the basis, the Tell legend is finally untenable, and\r\n     the tradition of an immemorial state of freedom in the Forest\r\n     Cantons is abandoned even by the conservative critics. See Bordier,\r\n     _La querelle_, p. 7. The only point on which a case against the\r\n     criticism of M. Rilliet seems to be made out is as regards his view\r\n     that the Forest Cantons were not colonised before the eighth\r\n     century. As M. Bordier contends, the grant of Louis of Germany\r\n     seems to describe a long-settled district. M. Rilliet also goes\r\n     somewhat beyond the evidence in assuming that Uri was mainly\r\n     colonised under royal influence, Unterwalden by lay and\r\n     ecclesiastical proprietors, and Schwytz by freemen (_Les origines_,\r\n     pp. 20, 21).\r\n\r\nThe rise of a durable federation in the central Swiss group is thus a\r\nproduct of three main factors; the first being their primary physical\r\nunion through the Lake of Lucerne, their common highway. But for this\r\nthey would probably have been as hostile as were Uri and Glarus, which\r\nhad fought from time immemorial.[883] Next was needed the chronic\r\nhostile pressure of an outside force, creating a common political\r\ninterest. The septs of pre-Norman Ireland and England, and of the\r\nScottish Highlands down till modern times, remained at strife long after\r\nChristianisation, because within their own country they were so free to\r\nstruggle, and because the examples of forcible centralisation elsewhere\r\nwere so remote and so hard to assimilate. But when the Forest Cantons\r\nemerge as such in history in the thirteenth century they are already\r\nmenaced by a power which, without undertaking or compassing the toil of\r\nconquering them, habitually drives them to formal combination by its\r\ninterference. Its continued pressure evolves the definite political\r\nagreement of 1315, after the victory of Morgarten, in which was made\r\nclear the special difficulty of conquering a race of mountaineers with\r\nthe normal cavalry forces and armour-clad or servile infantry of\r\nmedieval feudalism[884]--a difficulty which must rank as the third\r\nfactor in the beginnings of Swiss independence.\r\n\r\nThus far the half-feudal, half-commercial city of Lucerne, though in\r\ntouch with the Forest Cantons through the uniting lake, was their enemy,\r\nas being feudatory of the Hapsburgs; but as the chronic state of war was\r\nruinous to its trade with Italy, and peculiarly harassing to all\r\nindustry, the commercial element forced a coalition, and in 1332 Lucerne\r\njoined the Confederation as Fourth Canton. Now emerges in the affairs\r\nof the Confederation the element of civic class strife, so familiar in\r\nthe republics of Italy; for the accession of Lucerne is promptly\r\nfollowed in that city by a conspiracy of nobles, which is put down by\r\nthe help of the allied Cantons; whereupon the nobles are exiled and a\r\ncivic council set up, the Duke of Austria being unable to hinder. The\r\nsame trouble arises in the case of Zurich, the next accession to the\r\nunion. In the ordinary medieval course there had there arisen an\r\noligarchic government of aristocratic citizens in place of the early\r\ndominion of the Abbess; and the city was made an imperial fief by\r\nFrederick II. On this basis it made commercial treaties in the manner\r\nthen common among the cities of Germany, joining the Swabian, Rhenish,\r\nand South-German Leagues, and developing a large trade with Italy and\r\nGermany, and even a silk manufacture. At length the large craftsman\r\nclass revolted (1336) under the leadership of a dissentient patrician,\r\nBrun or Braun, who established a constitution in which he as burgomaster\r\nheld office for life, with a council of thirteen gildmasters and\r\nthirteen aristocrats, six of the latter being named by Brun. For the\r\nfirm support of the gilds he duly paid them by laws checking foreign\r\ncompetition in manufactured goods, and denying even to the rural\r\npopulation the right to manufacture. The dispossessed oligarchs kept up\r\na raiding strife on the frontiers, till at length some who were\r\npermitted to return formed a conspiracy against the burgomaster, which\r\nhe suppressed with slaughter. This leading to a league against the city\r\namong the Hapsburgs and the surrounding nobles and the Cantons in treaty\r\nwith them, Zurich petitioned to join the Forest Confederation, and was\r\nreadily accepted (1351), finally triumphing by their help.\r\n\r\nZurich on its part enabled the Forest Cantons to protect themselves\r\nagainst Austria by conquering Glarus (1351), which offered little\r\nresistance, and was ranked as a protected territory under the\r\nConfederation. This now formed a compact territorial group save for the\r\nCanton of Zug, intervening between Lucerne and Zurich. As that could not\r\ndefend itself against its neighbours, it joined their Confederation\r\nperforce (1352), being received as a full member. The same status was\r\nreadily granted to the city of Berne, which, imperially enfranchised in\r\n1218, had carried on a remarkable independent policy on Italian lines,\r\nacquiring territory from the decaying nobles around by mortgage,\r\npurchase, and conquest, till in 1339 they combined against her. Succour\r\nwas then given by the Forest Cantons, securing for Berne the victory of\r\nLaupen; and when in 1352 they invited her to join their union, her\r\nrulers accepted. So tepid, however, was still the spirit of union that\r\nat the Peace of Brandenburg in 1352, confirmed by that of Regensburg in\r\n1355, Glarus and Zug consented to withdraw, returning for a time to the\r\nAustrian allegiance;[885] and the confederation of the remaining six\r\nCantons was still one of the loosest cohesion, differing only in the\r\nfact of its territorial continuity and its organic growth from the many\r\ncity-unions which flourished in Germany in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies.[886] Only the three original Cantons were pledged to make no\r\nseparate treaties; Zurich was specifically permitted to do so; in 1352\r\nBerne was in alliance with the towns of Fribourg and Soleure; in the\r\nnext generation Lucerne made a compact with the towns of Sempach and\r\nRichensee; and in 1393 a burgomaster of Zurich carried through a treaty\r\nof alliance with the common enemy, the Duke of Austria.\r\n\r\nIn this case the mass of the citizens were induced to reverse the policy\r\nand banish those who had planned it; but the right of the city to make\r\nsuch an alliance was not technically challenged by the Confederation;\r\nand even in Schwytz a few loyalists paid old feudal dues to Austria up\r\ntill 1394. A more serious ground of division was the jealousy duly\r\narising between the rural and the city Cantons, from which came about\r\nthe forcible intervention of Schwytz in a dispute between the town and\r\ncountry sections of Zug. The remaining Cantons insisted on subjecting\r\nthe action of both Zug and Schwytz to the verdict of the union, thus\r\neffectually establishing a precedent of federal practice; but in the\r\nfirst decade of the fifteenth century the Cantons of Schwytz and Glarus\r\nare found on their own account helping the men of Appenzell to win their\r\nindependence; and when the successful Appenzellers, who had developed a\r\nturn for aggression and confiscation, sought to join the union, they\r\nwere accepted only as allies by the Cantons individually, Berne holding\r\naloof. Yet again, when the house of Austria (which had abandoned its\r\nclaims on the Cantons in 1412) was under the ban of the Empire in 1415,\r\nand the city Cantons led a movement of attack upon its territories, Uri\r\nand the Appenzellers took no part; while in 1422 Uri and Unterwalden\r\nacted alone in their unsuccessful war with the Duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nThus far the Confederation, in its different degrees of union, had\r\nincluded only German-speaking Cantons; but in 1420 the French-speaking\r\nValais (Ger. Wallis, from the Latin _Vallis Poenina?_ or foreigners),\r\nin 1424 Upper Rhaetia, and in the same year the Romance-speaking Engadin,\r\nalso in Rhaetia, won their virtual independence. In all, three leagues\r\nwere formed in Rhaetia, forming their own confederation, known as the\r\nGrisons (=\"the Greys,\" the _Graubuenden_ or Grey Leagues, from the colour\r\nof the peasants' smocks).\r\n\r\nAs the sphere of self-government widened, new risks of strife arose. All\r\nthe while the older Cantons, in particular the cities, had been\r\nacquiring lands in the feudal fashion; and in 1440 a general scramble\r\nfor an inheritance in Rhaetia evolved first a war between Zurich on the\r\none hand and Schwytz and Glarus on the other, and next a joint coercion\r\nof Zurich by all the other Cantons. This led to a fresh alliance between\r\nZurich and Austria, and a new and exceptionally ferocious war, lasting\r\nfor four years. Meantime Basle, assailed by the Armagnacs under the\r\ndauphin of France, was succoured by the union and received into\r\nalliance. Next came the Burgundian wars, whereafter, not without much\r\nfriction and quarrelling over booty, Soleure (Solothurn) and Fribourg\r\nwere taken into the union, and a new pact framed (1481), defining afresh\r\nthe general law of the Confederation. Lastly, after the Swabian war, the\r\nlast in which the Swiss had to defend themselves against German\r\naggression, the cities of Basle and Schaffhausen, become self-governing,\r\nwere received into the League; and in 1513 Appenzell followed. Thus was\r\nrounded the number of thirteen Cantons, which constituted the Swiss\r\nConfederation till the end of the eighteenth century. They were: Schwytz\r\n(which gradually gave its name to the whole people), Uri, Unterwalden,\r\nZurich (the \"Forest\" group), Lucerne, Glarus, Zug, Berne, Fribourg,\r\nSoleure, Basle, Schaffhausen, and Appenzell. Aargau and Thurgau,\r\nconquered in the wars with Austria in 1415 and 1460, remained subject\r\nlands, the property of the allied Cantons; and the Valais and the\r\nGrisons remained outside the union as connections or _Zugewandte_, the\r\nLeague proper being restricted to German-speaking Cantons. It will be\r\nseen too that the territory of the Confederation remained a compact and\r\nconnected mass; the Vaud, the Valais, Ticino, and the Grisons forming a\r\nlong band of territory outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. _The Socio-Political Evolution_\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature of the Swiss social evolution up to the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century is the acquisition of municipal estates by the\r\nchief cities, after the manner of those of Italy. The lead given by\r\nBerne was zealously followed by Zurich[887] and Lucerne, till nearly all\r\nthe old feudal lordships around them had fallen into their hands by\r\npurchase, mortgage, or conquest; and by 1477 the Hapsburgs had not a\r\nrood of land left in all Helvetia, even the family castle being lost. It\r\nwas impossible that the revenues thus acquired by the cities should fail\r\nin that age to enrich the patrician or ruling class, no matter how\r\nrevolutions might alter its membership. Herein lay one of the effective\r\nchecks to the growth of the Confederation from 1513 onwards. The rural\r\nCantons and the aristocratic governments of the cities were alike\r\ndisinclined to enfranchise the rural populations they held in feudal\r\nsubjection; and the status of the mass of the townspeople and subject\r\npeasantry, though probably better than in France and Germany, was that\r\nof men without political rights,[888] save those secured by feudal or\r\ncivic custom.\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that in the pre-Reformation period the flourishing\r\nSwiss cities did much for culture; a main part of the explanation\r\ndoubtless being (1) the chronic stress of war, which in such communities\r\ntended to be borne by all classes alike.[889] When the Italian cities\r\nhad produced Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio; when England had produced\r\nChaucer; and France the _Roman de la Rose_, Villon, Joinville,\r\nFroissart, and Comines, Switzerland had a literature only of average\r\nGerman lyrics and a few average medieval chronicles. But the comparison\r\nwill be quite misleading if it be not kept in mind (2) that the whole\r\nSwiss population up till 1500 never amounted to a million, and that the\r\nsurplus males were being constantly drained off in the fifteenth century\r\nin military service outside of Switzerland. The conditions which made\r\nfor military strength and independence were entirely unfavourable to\r\nculture. There remains, however, to be noted in the case of German\r\nSwitzerland (3) the fundamental drawback of relative homogeneity of\r\nrace. The one important aspect of \"race\" in sociology is as a statement\r\nof relative lack of intellectual variability; and this condition in\r\nmodern Europe can be seen to exist only at certain periods, in the case\r\nof one or two peoples, chiefly the Germanic.\r\n\r\nIf the whole process of the renascence of civilisation be considered\r\n_seriatim_, it will be found that the growth took place primarily in\r\nvirtue of degree of access to (_a_) the remains of Graeco-Roman culture\r\nand (_b_) to Saracen lore; and, secondarily, in virtue of degree of\r\nadmixture of physical type in the different communities. Thus (1) the\r\nfirst great new-birth (before the age of the Renaissance so-called) took\r\nplace in Italy, in a population already highly mixed at the end of the\r\nRoman period and repeatedly invaded thereafter by northern stocks, from\r\nOdoaker down to the Normans. The reviving Italian culture, being\r\ncommunicated northwards through the Church and otherwise, is next\r\ndeveloped by (2) the highly-mixed population of France and (3) that of\r\nEngland after the Norman Conquest--the Welsh element being here\r\nprominent. At the same time the literary germination set up in (4)\r\nancient Ireland, under stormy conditions, by the early missionaries of\r\nthe Graeco-Roman Church, reaches after some centuries the Scandinavian\r\npeoples by way of the Hebrides and (5) Iceland, where, however, after a\r\nbrilliant start, the evolution is arrested by the restrictive\r\nenvironment, the main body of Scandinavian life being too homogeneous\r\n(though constantly at strife) for any complex evolution. In the south,\r\nagain, the populations of (6) Spain and Portugal, mixed to begin with in\r\nthe Roman period and later crossed by Teutonic invasion, became\r\nspecially capable of variation after the subdual of the Moors, whose\r\nreaction on their conquerors was extensive and important.\r\n\r\nAll this while the Teutonic stocks in their old homes are noticeably\r\nbackward, save where, as in (7) the Netherlands, they are in constant\r\ncontact with other peoples on land and by sea. Culture begins to be at\r\nonce original and brilliant in the Netherlands only in the period after\r\n(_a_) special contact with Spain and (_b_) the large immigration of\r\nProtestant refugees from other countries. At first strongly influenced\r\nby classical scholarship, it is later affected by the influence of\r\nFrance and England. All the more strictly Teutonic cultures were either\r\nunprogressive or similarly vitalised from without; and Germany, after\r\nthe Thirty Years' War, begins almost afresh with an academic literature\r\nin Latin, to be followed by new native developments only on French and\r\nEnglish stimuli.[890] But it is specially significant that (8) the\r\nGerman renascence of the eighteenth century takes place after (_a_) the\r\nlarge influx of French Protestant refugees at the end of the\r\nseventeenth, and after (_b_) a fresh influx of French taste, French\r\nteachers, and French literature under Frederick the Great, in whose\r\narmies, it should be remembered, there fought no fewer than nine\r\ngenerals of French Protestant descent, as well as others of alien\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nThe case of Switzerland is thus on this side tolerably clear. Swiss\r\nintellectual life, long primitively Teutonic, begins to become notable\r\nonly at the period of the Reformation, when for the merely diplomatic\r\nand military and commercial contacts of the past there is substituted a\r\nfresh differentiation and interaction from Italian, French, and German\r\nProtestantism--a new intellectual impulse--and from the influx of\r\nrefugees, as in Holland. And the French-speaking city of Geneva, not yet\r\na member of the Confederation, at once takes the lead. The Teutonic\r\npopulation, from the fifteenth century onwards, had in large numbers\r\nsought subsistence in mercenary soldiership. It was the medieval\r\nanalogue to the emigration of to-day, the opening even serving to\r\ncurtail the agricultural and pastoral life;[891] but the result, by the\r\ncommon consent of historians,[892] was disastrous to the higher life at\r\nhome, the returning mercenaries being in many cases spoilt for steady\r\nindustry, rural or civic. Their military success and prestige in fact\r\ntended to demoralise the Swiss as the success of Hellas against Persia\r\ntended to demoralise Athens, making them, in the words of Aristotle,\r\nunfitted to rest. Dwelling on past patriotic glories is never the way to\r\ndiscipline the mental life; and the Swiss militia of the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, wont to sell their services as fighters to French and\r\nItalians, often thus opposing each other, and otherwise wont to\r\ninterpose arrogantly in other people's concerns,[893] were not on the\r\nline of social or intellectual progress. Pensions to leading men from\r\nthe French and Italian courts wrought a further and even more sinister\r\ncorruption. But after their defeat by Francis I in 1516 at the desperate\r\nbattle of Marignano, becoming allies of France, the Swiss ceased to play\r\nthe part of holders of the balances between contending neighbours; and\r\nafter their heavy share in the loss of Francis at the battle of Pavia\r\nthey grew for a time loth even to play the part of auxiliaries on a\r\nnational footing, though individual enlistment continued. It is at this\r\nstage that the Reformation supervenes, creating a new source of strife\r\nbetween Canton and Canton, and so paralysing the Confederation for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the study of the process of the Reformation more instructive,\r\nmore subversive of the conventional Protestant view, than in the case of\r\nSwitzerland. In the first place, it is not the old Forest Cantons, with\r\ntheir ingrained independence and \"Teutonic conscience,\" that do the\r\nwork. They remained obstinately Catholic. Swiss Protestantism, under the\r\nindependent lead of Zwingli, began indeed in Glarus and Schwytz, but\r\nbecame an effective movement only in the city of Zurich, and it is\r\nnotable that in the primitive and poor Canton of Uri[894] there was as\r\nlittle buying of indulgences as there was heresy. The two phenomena went\r\ntogether in the richer Cantons, where the common desire to buy pardons\r\nevoked the protest against them. Indeed, the special traffic in\r\nindulgences in Germany and Switzerland, and the special laxity of life\r\nof their priesthoods, were concomitants of the special grossness of\r\nGerman life;[895] for in no other country did the Reformation proceed\r\nnakedly on the basis of protest against indulgence-selling. There the\r\npardoners shamefully overrode all the official and accepted teaching of\r\nthe Church as to indulgences; and the protests of Luther and Zwingli\r\nwere properly demands for a reform on strictly orthodox grounds, as\r\nagainst an abuse which was locally excessive. But it lay in the economic\r\nand political conditions that when a movement of protest began it should\r\nsucceed in view rather of the economic and social impulses to break with\r\nRome than of the spontaneous desire for reform. In Germany in particular\r\nthe movement among the upper and educated classes was nakedly financial\r\nas regarded the nobles, and to a large extent the reverse of ascetic\r\namong the scholars, many of whom, however, were much more spontaneously\r\nalive to the doctrinal crudities of the orthodox system than was Luther\r\nhimself. It was the facile combination, on socio-political grounds, of\r\nthe five forces of (1) moral indignation among the more conscientious\r\nleaders, (2) gain-seeking on the part of nobles and ruling burghers, (3)\r\nracial aversion to Italian priests and Italian revenue-drawing among the\r\npeople in general, (4) critical revolt against primitive superstitions\r\namong the more learned, and (5) anti-clerical freethinking and licence\r\namong many who had served in the Italian wars,[896] that made the revolt\r\nproceed so rapidly in Germany and Switzerland. If the mass of the\r\npeople, in all save the most primitive Swiss Cantons, were grossly eager\r\nto buy the indulgences so grossly offered by Samson and Tetzel, the\r\npeople clearly were not zealous reformers to start with. Of those who\r\nmost resented the traffic, many remained steady Catholics.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, it became known that Samson carried away with him from\r\nSwitzerland to Italy 800,000 crowns, besides other bullion and jewels,\r\neven the buyers of indulgences could share the general inclination to\r\nstop the enrichment of Italy at Swiss expense. The intellectual revolt\r\nof the educated supplied the basis of the revolution in church\r\nmanagement; but without the accruing financial gains the former could\r\nhave availed little; and while there was the usual violence on the part\r\nof the mob, the city authorities were judicious in their procedure. To\r\nthe clergy they offered on the one hand freedom to marry, and on the\r\nother hand a provision for life. Thus in Zurich, under the skilful\r\nguidance of Zwingli, the whole chapter of twenty-four canons gave up\r\ntheir rights and property to the State, becoming preachers, teachers, or\r\nprofessors with life-allowances: a plan generally followed elsewhere,\r\nsave where the parties fell to blows.[897] In Zurich the further steps\r\nwere: 1523, ecclesiastical marriages; 1524, pictures abolished and\r\nmonasteries dissolved; 1525, mass discontinued.\r\n\r\nIn French-speaking Geneva, destined to become the leading Swiss city,\r\nthe process was more stormy. Having grown to importance under its\r\nbishops, it had been made an imperial city in 1420, thereby finding a\r\nfoothold in its resistance to the constant claims of the House of Savoy,\r\nwhich in 1519 forced it into a defensive alliance with Fribourg. There\r\nwere now two Genevan parties, the Savoyards and the republicans, which\r\nlatter, imitating Swiss usage, called themselves Eidgenossen, whence the\r\nFrench corruption _Huguenots_, ultimately applied to the Calvinistic\r\nProtestants of France. Out of the faction strife came the religious,\r\nunder the fanning of Farel; and in this case the anti-democratic leaning\r\nof the Savoyards kept the rich pro-Catholic, while the common people\r\ndeclared for Protestantism. In the end the latter took violent\r\npossession of the churches, destroying the altars and images, whereupon\r\nmost of the Catholics fled, the city retaining the clerical lands; and\r\nthere immigrated many French, Italian, and Savoyard Protestants. To the\r\ncommunity thus made for him came Calvin in 1537.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Berne, conquering the Pays de Vaud from the Duke of Savoy,\r\nmade it Protestant. Elsewhere, some communes and districts passed and\r\nrepassed between Catholicism and Protestantism as neighbouring\r\ninfluences prevailed; in some districts the peasants, hoping for release\r\nfrom tithes and taxes, welcomed the revolution, but renounced it when\r\nthey found it made no difference to their lot.[898] The magistrates of\r\nBerne were prompt to make it clear that their Protestantism made no\r\ndifference as to their tithe-drawing from their rural subjects.[899]\r\nWhen the period of transformation was over--with its bitter wars, which\r\ncost the life of Zwingli, its manifold exasperations, its Anabaptist\r\nconvulsions, its forlorn and foredoomed peasant risings, its severance\r\nof old ties, and its profound impairment of the half-grown spirit of\r\nconfederation--it was found that the old Cantons of Lucerne, Uri,\r\nUnterwalden, Schwytz, and Zug stood fast for Catholicism; that Soleure,\r\nafter being for a time predominantly Protestant, had joined them, with\r\nFribourg, making seven Catholic States; that the city Cantons of Berne,\r\nZurich, Basle, and Schaffhausen were Protestant, as were Geneva and the\r\nVaud, not yet in the union; and that Glarus and Appenzell were mixed.\r\nThe achievement of the landamman OEbly of Glarus, in securing a\r\npeaceful and lasting compromise in his own Canton--the two bodies in\r\nsome parishes actually agreeing to use the same church--was beyond the\r\nmoral capacity of the mass of the Swiss people, for Appenzell bitterly\r\ndivided into two parts, on religious lines. Each of the other Cantons\r\nimposed its ruling men's creed on its subjects. They were still as far\r\nfrom toleration in religion as from real democracy in politics.\r\n\r\nWhile Protestantism, by dividing the realm of religion, doubtless\r\nwrought indirectly and ultimately for the intellectual freedom of\r\nEurope, it is clear that it had no such result for many generations in\r\nSwitzerland. Calvin's rule in Geneva, while associated with a new\r\nactivity in printing, chiefly of theological works,[900] became a byword\r\nfor moral tyranny and cruelty. To say nothing of the executions of\r\nServetus and Gruet for heresy, and the expulsions of other men, the\r\nrecords show that in that small population there were between 800 and\r\n900 persons imprisoned between the years 1542 and 1546, and 58 put to\r\ndeath; no fewer than 34 being beheaded, hanged, or burned on charges of\r\nsedition in three months of 1545. Torture was freely applied, and any\r\npersonal criticism of Calvin was more or less fiercely punished.[901]\r\nThe conditions were much the same in Zurich and Berne, where a press\r\ncensorship was set up (in Zurich as early as 1523), and zealously\r\nmaintained for centuries. It prohibited, under heavy penalties, the sale\r\nof the works of Descartes, and in both places Cartesians were\r\nprosecuted;[902] while in Protestant Switzerland generally the\r\nCopernican theory was denounced as heresy, and the reformed Calendar, as\r\na work of the Pope, was furiously rejected. So high did passion run that\r\nin Berne and Zurich any who married Catholics were severely\r\npunished.[903] The Zurich criminal calendar of the sixteenth century\r\ngives a sample of the Protestant city life of the period. There were 572\r\nexecutions in all, 347 persons being beheaded, 61 burned, 55 hanged, 53\r\ndrowned. Only 33 were cases of murder; 2 were executed for abuse of\r\nZwingli, who thus appears to have given a lead to Calvin; 73 for\r\nblasphemy, 56 for bestiality, and 338 for theft[904]--a clear economic\r\nclue.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the settled Protestant period was one of relapse alike\r\nfrom freedom and from union. Class division deepened and worsened\r\nthroughout the seventeenth century;[905] the people of the subject lands\r\nwere less than ever recognised as having rights,[906] Puritanism taking\r\nto oppression as spontaneously in Switzerland as in England; the\r\nstimulus given to culture and art in the controversial period died away,\r\nleaving retrogression;[907] and in the personal and the intellectual\r\nlife alike clerical tyranny was universal.[908] The municipalities\r\nbecame more and more close corporations, as the gilds had become long\r\nbefore;[909] and at Berne in 1640 the city treasurer was put to death\r\nfor exposing abuses.[910] After the Peasants' War of 1653 the\r\naristocratic development was still further strengthened, till in Berne,\r\nSoleure, and Fribourg--Catholic and Protestant cities alike--the roll of\r\nburghers was closed (1680-90), Soleure stipulating that it should remain\r\nso till the number of reigning families was reduced to twenty-five.[911]\r\nThe practice of taking pensions from France revived, for the old service\r\nof supplying mercenary troops; so that \"the Swiss were never more\r\nshamelessly sold to the highest bidder\" than in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.[912] As of old, the municipalities amassed and invested\r\ncapital, Catholic Soleure lending great sums to France, while the still\r\nwealthier city of Berne lent money in all directions;[913] but though\r\nthey raised handsome public buildings, it was the small ruling class and\r\nnot the workers that were enriched. In the rural Cantons even the small\r\neconomic advance made at the outset of the Reformation was lost.[914] It\r\nseems difficult to dispute that as a force for social progress the\r\nReformation was naught.\r\n\r\nOne factor there was to its credit: the establishment of secondary\r\nschools, which had not previously existed in Switzerland, and the\r\nprovision of better common schools;[915] and though the ecclesiastical\r\nand religious forces, as in Scotland, prevented the common schools being\r\nturned to any higher account at home than that of qualifying to read and\r\nwrite and learn catechisms, even that small tuition gave the Swiss some\r\nadvantages in the neighbouring countries. All the while the higher\r\npolitical evolution went backwards. In 1586 the Catholic Cantons of\r\nSchwytz, Uri, Unterwalden, Lucerne, Zug, Fribourg, and Soleure ejected\r\nfrom the League the Protestant State of Muelhausen; and, ignoring the\r\nlaws of the Confederation, proceeded to make a separate offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance among themselves, and with Spain and the Pope. As\r\nlate as 1656 war broke out between Berne and Schwytz, Lucerne\r\nintervening, over a dispute about Protestant refugees; whereafter the\r\nprinciple of cantonal sovereignty reigned supreme for a hundred and\r\nforty years. It would seem difficult to maintain, in the face of all the\r\nfacts, that Protestantism had made for peace, freedom, or civilisation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the distribution of Protestantism in the Swiss\r\nCantons disposes once for all of the theory that the \"Teutonic\r\nconscience\" or anything else of an ethnic order was the determining\r\nforce at the Reformation. A rough conspectus of the language and\r\nreligion of the Cantons as at the year 1900 will present the proof to\r\nthe contrary:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------+----------------------------+------------------------\r\n          NAME.      |          LANGUAGE.         |        RELIGION.\r\n  -------------------+----------------------------+------------------------\r\n  Berne              |Five-sixths German-speaking |Seven-eighths Protestant\r\n  Zurich             |Nearly all German           |      \"           \"\r\n  Lucerne            |  \"     \"    \"              |Nearly all Catholic\r\n  Vaud               |Mostly French dialects      |Nine-tenths Protestant\r\n  Aargau             |Mostly German               |Four C. to five P.\r\n  St. Gall           |  \"      \"                  |Three-fifths Catholic\r\n  Ticino             |Italian dialects            |Nearly all Catholic\r\n  Fribourg           |Half French, half German    |Four-fifths Catholic\r\n  Grisons            |Half Romansch, three-eighths|Five-ninths Protestant\r\n                     |  German, one-eighth Italian|\r\n  Valais             |(?)

The one generalisation which appears to hold good to any extent\r\nin the matter is that Catholicism usually goes with an agricultural\r\neconomy and Protestantism with manufactures; but here, too, there are\r\nexceptions, as Vaud, which, though Protestant, is predominantly\r\nagricultural or vine-rearing; Glarus, which is mainly pastoral and\r\nProtestant; the Grisons, agricultural and more than half Protestant; and\r\nGeneva, where there is a large minority of Catholics in industrial\r\nconditions. On the whole, we are warranted in assuming that in\r\nSwitzerland, as in most other countries, the town workers were the\r\nreadiest to innovate in religion; while race, so far as inferrible from\r\nlanguage, had nothing to do with the choice made. What differences of\r\nlife accrue to the creeds, as we shall see, depend on their one\r\nimportant social divergence, that of bias for and against illiteracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. _The Modern Renaissance_\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the eighteenth century the Swiss Confederation\r\nfigured as \"a weather-beaten ruin, ready to fall.\"[916] It would be hard\r\nto point out, in the domestic conditions, any that made for beneficent\r\nchange, and there were many that rigidly precluded it; but some elements\r\nof variability there were, and from other countries there came the\r\nprinciple of fertilisation. Theological hatreds and disputations had in\r\na manner destroyed their own standing-ground by the very stress of their\r\nbarren activity; and even while press laws were banning new works of\r\nthought and science, the better minds were secretly yearning towards\r\nthem. In cities like Geneva and Basle (the latter then the seat of the\r\nonly Swiss university), reason must to some extent have played beneath\r\nthe surface while all its open manifestations were struck at. At Basle,\r\nin the old days, Erasmus spent the main part of his life; and he must\r\nhave had some congenial intercourse. But it is on the side of the\r\nphysical sciences that new intellectual life is first seen to germinate\r\nin post-Reformation Switzerland. There, as elsewhere, inquiring men felt\r\nthat nature was kindlier to question than the self-appointed oracles of\r\nDeity, and that the unending search for real knowledge brought more\r\npeace than ever came of the insistence that the ultimate truth was\r\nknown. Refugee immigrants, chiefly French, seem to have begun the\r\nferment; and it is at the hands of their descendants that Swiss science\r\nhas grown.[917] Having reason to avoid alike politics and theology in\r\ntheir new home, and living in many cases on incomes from investments,\r\nthey turned to the sciences as occupation and solace.\r\n\r\nWith this inner movement concurred the new influences from French and\r\nEnglish science and literature, and from the reviving culture of\r\nGermany.[918] With the rest of Europe, too, Switzerland turned in an\r\nincreasing degree to industry, and in the latter half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury had developed many new trades, involving considerable use of\r\nmachinery.[919] Agriculture, too, improved,[920] and mercenary\r\nsoldiering began to fall into disrepute[921] under the influence of the\r\nnew pacific thought. Still the rural economic conditions were bad, and\r\nthe country seemed to grow poorer while the towns grew richer.[922] The\r\npopulation, in fact, constantly tended to exceed the not easily widened\r\nlimits of rural subsistence; and in place of foreign soldiering, the old\r\nremedy, there began a peaceful industrial emigration into the\r\nneighbouring countries, Swiss beginning to figure there in increasing\r\nnumbers as waiters and servants.[923] All the while the tyranny of the\r\ncity aristocracies was unmitigated, and the subject lands were steadily\r\nill-treated.[924] In Berne, in 1776, only eighteen families were\r\nrepresented in the Council of Two Hundred; and there and in Zurich and\r\nLucerne the civic regulations were as flagrantly partial to the ruling\r\nclass as in France itself.[925] The new industrial conditions, however,\r\nwere gradually preparing a political change; and the intellectual\r\nclimate steadily altered. Voltaire tells in many amusing letters of the\r\nspread of Socinian heresy in the city of Calvin. In Geneva arose the\r\nabnormal figure of Jean Jacques Rousseau, descendant of a French refugee\r\nimmigrant of Calvin's day; and though his city in 1762 formally burned\r\nhis epoch-marking book on the _Contrat Social_, a popular reaction\r\nfollowed six years later. Democratic disturbances had repeatedly\r\noccurred before; but this time there was a growing force at work. An\r\ninsurrection in 1770 was suppressed; another, in 1782, though at first\r\nsuccessful, ended in the overthrow of the popular party by means of\r\ntroops from France, Berne, and Zurich; but in the fateful year of 1789\r\nyet another broke out, and this time the tide turned.\r\n\r\nWith the interference of the French Republic in Switzerland in 1797 on\r\nbehalf of the Pays de Vaud, then subject to Berne, began the long\r\nconvulsion which broke up the old Confederation and framed a new. In\r\n1798 began the wildly premature attempt of the more visionary\r\nrepublicans to create a unitary republic out of Cantons which had\r\nretrograded even from the measure of union attained before the\r\nReformation. It could not succeed; and the rapine inseparable from the\r\nFrench revolutionary methods could not but arouse an intense resistance,\r\nparalysing the aims of the progressive party. Out of years of miserable\r\nferocious warfare, ended by Napoleon's withdrawal of the French troops\r\nin 1801, came the new Confederation of 1803, which, however, it needed\r\nthe friendly but authoritative mediation of the First Consul to get the\r\nconservative Cantons to accept. For once the despot had secured, in a\r\nreally disinterested fashion,[926] what the Revolution ought to have\r\nbrought about. The old aristocratic tyrannies were subverted; the\r\nsubject lands were freed; to the thirteen Cantons of the old union were\r\nadded Aargau, Thurgau, St. Gall, Vaud, and Ticino; through all was set\r\nup a representative system, modified in the towns by a measure of the\r\nold aristocratic element; and the whole possessed what Switzerland never\r\nhad before, and could hardly otherwise have attained--a central\r\nparliamentary system. In 1814 Berne would fain have resumed its tyranny\r\nover the Vaud and Aargau, a step which would have initiated a general\r\nreturn to the old _regime_. The Allies, however, brought about the\r\ncompletion of the Confederation on the new principles; and by the\r\naddition to its roll of Geneva, Neuchatel, and the Valais, and the\r\ncession to Berne of the Basle territory formerly annexed by France,\r\ncreated a compact and complete Switzerland, bounded in natural fashion\r\nby the Alps, the Jura, and the Rhine. And at this period, after so many\r\nvicissitudes, the culture life of Switzerland is found fully abreast of\r\nthat of Europe in general. Sismondi, standing apart from France and\r\nItaly, and writing impartially the history of both, is the greatest\r\nhistorian of his day.\r\n\r\nThe later history of the Confederation, however, is one of the great\r\nillustrations of the perpetual possibility of strife and sunderance in\r\ncommunities. Sismondi lived to ban the democracy which would not be\r\ncontent to be ruled by the middle class. At 1820 the old spirit of class\r\nsubsisted under the new institutions; the press was nearly everywhere\r\nunder strict censorship; and the ideals which ruled elsewhere on the\r\nContinent seemed even more potent in Switzerland than elsewhere. There,\r\nas elsewhere, the system inevitably bred discontent; and in 1830, on the\r\nrevolutionary initiative of Ticino, the most corruptly governed of all\r\nthe Cantons, there ensued almost bloodless revolutions in the local\r\ngovernments, Radicals taking the place of Conservatives, and proceeding\r\nto reform alike administration and education. Then came the due\r\nreaction, the Catholic Cantons forming the League of Sarnen, while the\r\nextremists again pressed the ideal of a military State. Though morally\r\nstrong enough to enforce peace in more than one embroilment of Cantons\r\nand parties, the Federal Diet was dangerously weak in the face of the\r\nnew forces of religio-political reaction typified by the activity of the\r\nJesuits, as well as the old trouble of cantonal selfishness, which\r\naffected even the tolls.[927] The resistance to Radicalism became a\r\nmovement of clerical fanaticism, led by the cry of \"religion in danger\";\r\nCatholics using it to foment local insurrections; Protestants,\r\necclesiastically led, using it to make a municipal revolution by\r\nviolence at Zurich on the occasion of the proposal to give Strauss a\r\nuniversity chair in 1839.[928] But the Jesuits--expelled from nearly\r\nevery Catholic State in the eighteenth century, yet latterly cherished\r\nby the Swiss Catholics for their anti-Protestant services--were the\r\nchief mischief-makers; and at length the violences promoted from the\r\nheadquarters at Lucerne led to Protestant reprisals which took the shape\r\nof a beginning of civil war. The collapse, however, of the Catholic\r\n\"Sonderbund\" or Secession-League in 1847, before the resolute military\r\naction of the Diet, marked the turning-point in modern Swiss politics.\r\nIn 1848 was framed a new constitution, wholly Swiss-made, creating an\r\neffective Federal government, on a new basis of a Parliament of two\r\nChambers. Now were definitely nationalised the systems of coinage,\r\nweights and measures, posts and telegraphs; and the Customs system was\r\nmade one of complete internal free trade.\r\n\r\nOn this footing followed \"long years of happiness, and a prosperity\r\nwithout precedent.\"[929] Yet even this constitution has had to be\r\nrevised, to the end of guarding afresh against religious strifes and\r\nconflict of cantonal jurisdictions. In 1872 the centralising reformers\r\ncarried in the Chambers a revision of the constitution; but under the\r\nreferendum (a specialty of Swiss democracy, instituted in or after 1831\r\nby the Catholic Conservative party in St. Gall, the Valais and Lucerne)\r\nit was rejected by a popular vote of 261,072 citizens to 255,609, and of\r\nthirteen cantons to nine. With a few modifications, however, it was\r\ncarried in 1874 by a vote of 340,199 to 198,013, and of 14-1/2 Cantons\r\nto 7-1/2. The whole process is a great lesson as to the superiority of\r\nthe methods of peace and persuasion to those of revolution and force.\r\nThe referendum itself, first set up locally with the most reactionary\r\nintentions,[930] has come to be valued--whether wisely or unwisely--by\r\nRadicals and Conservatives alike; and while it seems to offer a\r\npossibility of appeals to demotic ignorance and passion[931] while these\r\nsubsist, and to be unnecessary where they do not, it is at least a\r\nguarantee of the decisiveness of any great constitutional step taken\r\nunder it. Historically speaking, the consummation thus far is a great\r\ndemocratic achievement, and the whole drift of Federal legislation is\r\ntowards an increased stability of union. On the other hand, despite a\r\ncharacteristic menace from Bismarck,[932] the international position of\r\nSwitzerland appears to be as safe as that of any other European State,\r\ngreat or small. Any attempt on its independence by any one Power would\r\ninfallibly be resisted by others.\r\n\r\nAs regards the true political problems, those of domestic life, the\r\nSwiss case presents the usual elements. From dangerous religious strife\r\n(the Jesuits being excluded) it seems likely to be preserved in future\r\nby the rationalising force of the Socialist movement; but that movement\r\nin turn tells of the social problem. A country of not readily extensible\r\nresources, Switzerland exhibits nearly as clearly as does Holland the\r\ndangers of over-population. The old resource of foreign enlistment being\r\ndone with,[933] surplus population forces a continual emigration,\r\nlargely from the rural districts, where the lands are for the most part\r\nheavily mortgaged.[934] The active industrialism of the towns--with\r\ntheir large manufacture of clocks and watches, cottons and\r\nsilks--involves a large importation of foreign food, with which native\r\nagriculture cannot advantageously compete. Thus, as in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the pinch falls on the country, while the towns are in\r\ncomparison thriving. The relatively high death-rate of recent years\r\nraises an old issue. Malthus has told[935] how in the eighteenth century\r\na panic arose concerning the prudential habits of the population in the\r\nway of late marriages and small families, and how thereafter\r\nencouragements to early marriage had led to much worsening of the lot of\r\nmany of the people. With a small birth-rate there had been a small\r\ndeath-rate; whereas the rising birth-rate went with rising misery.[936]\r\nPerhaps through the influence of his treatise, the movement of demand\r\nfor increase of population seems to have died out, and the practice of\r\nprudence to have regained economic credit. It would appear, however,\r\nthat within the past half-century the conditions as to population have\r\nagain somewhat worsened. At 1850, when nearly half of all the men\r\nmarried per year in England were under twenty years of age, the normal\r\nmarrying age in the Vaud was thirty or thirty-one; and there had existed\r\nin a number of the old Catholic Cantons laws inflicting heavy fines on\r\nyoung people who married without proving their ability to support a\r\nfamily.[937] The modern tendency is to abandon such paternal modes of\r\ninterference; and it does not appear that personal prudence thus far\r\nreplaces them, though on the other hand there was in the first half of\r\nlast century a marked recognition by Swiss publicists of the\r\nsociological law of the matter.\r\n\r\nThus M. Edward Mallet of Geneva pointed out before 1850 that the chances\r\nof life had steadily gone on increasing with the lessening of the\r\nbirth-rate for centuries back.[938] His tables run:--\r\n\r\n   ----------------------------+--------+---------+-------\r\n           LIFE CHANCES.       | YEARS. | MONTHS. | DAYS.\r\n   ----------------------------+--------+---------+-------\r\n                               |        |         |\r\n   Towards end of 16th century |    8   |    7    |  26\r\n   In 17th century             |   13   |    3    |  16\r\n   In the years 1701-1750      |   27   |    9    |  13\r\n     \"      \"   1751-1800      |   31   |    3    |   5\r\n     \"      \"   1801-1813      |   40   |    8    |   0\r\n     \"      \"   1814-1833      |   45   |    0    |  29\r\n   ----------------------------+--------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nThe statistician's summary of the case is worth citing:--\r\n\r\n     \"As prosperity advanced, marriages became fewer and later; the\r\n     proportion of births was reduced, but greater numbers of the\r\n     infants born were preserved. In the early and barbarous periods the\r\n     excessive mortality was accompanied by a prodigious fecundity. In\r\n     the last few years of the seventeenth century a marriage still\r\n     produced five children and more; the probable duration of life was\r\n     not twenty years, and Geneva had scarcely 17,000 inhabitants.\r\n     Towards the end of the eighteenth century there were scarcely three\r\n     children to a marriage; and the probability of life exceeded\r\n     thirty-two years. At the present time a marriage produces only two\r\n     and three-quarter children; the probability of life is forty-five\r\n     years; and Geneva, which exceeds 27,000 in population, has arrived\r\n     at a high degree of civilisation and material prosperity. In 1836\r\n     the population appeared to have attained its summit: the births\r\n     barely replaced the deaths.\"\r\n\r\nBut in 1910 the population of Geneva (Canton) was 154,159;[939] and the\r\nfigures of Swiss emigration--averaging about 5,000 per annum--tell their\r\nown tale. Increasing industrialism, as usual, has meant conjugal\r\nimprovidence. Once more the trouble is not smallness of population, but\r\nundue increase.\r\n\r\nAs Protestantism appears to increase slightly more than Catholicism, no\r\nblame can in this case be laid on the Catholic Church. But in\r\nSwitzerland, as elsewhere, Catholicism tends to illiteracy. In the\r\nProtestant cantons the proportion of school-attending children is as one\r\nto five; in the half-and-half Cantons it is as one to seven; and in the\r\nCatholic it is as one to nine. This, and no tendency of race or _direct_\r\ntendency of creed, is the explanation of the relative superiority of\r\nProtestant to Catholic Cantons in point of comfort and freedom from\r\nmendicancy; for the Cantons remarked by travellers for their prosperity\r\nare indifferently French-and German-speaking, while the less prosperous\r\nare either German or mixed.[940] The fact that the three oldest Forest\r\nCantons are among the more backward is a reminder that past-worship,\r\nthere at its height, is always a snare to civilisation. Describing these\r\ncantons over half-a-century ago, Grote spoke severely of \"their dull and\r\nstationary intelligence, their bigotry, and their pride in bygone power\r\nand exploits.\"[941] The reproach is in some measure applicable to other\r\nparts of Switzerland, as to other nations in general; and it must cease\r\nto be deserved before the Republic, cultured and well administered as it\r\nis, can realise republican ideals. But the existing Federation of the\r\nHelvetic Cantons, locally patriotic and self-seeking as they still are,\r\nis a hopeful spectacle--for this among other reasons, that it is a\r\nperpetual reminder of the possibility of federations of States, even at\r\na stage of civilisation far short of any Utopia of altruism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 871: \"To one whose studies lie in the contemplation of\r\nhistorical phenomena [the Swiss Cantons] comprise between the Rhine and\r\nthe Alps a miniature of all Europe....

The beginnings of the local\r\npatriotism are not confidently to be gathered from the old\r\nchronicles,[942] which reduce the process for the most part to the\r\ncalculated action of the Queen Theresa (fl. 1114-28), certainly one of\r\nthe most interesting female figures in history. But the main process of\r\ngrowth is simple enough. A series of warrior kings made good their\r\nposition on the one hand against Spain, and on the other conquered what\r\nis now the southern part of Portugal (the ancient Lusitania) from the\r\nMoors. Only in a limited degree did their administration realise the\r\ngains conceivable from a differentiation and rivalry of cultures in the\r\nPeninsula; but in view of the special need for such variation in a\r\nterritory open to few foreign culture-contacts, the Portuguese\r\nnationality has counted substantially for civilisation. It would have\r\ncounted for much more if in the militant Catholic period the Portuguese\r\ncrown had not followed the evil lead of Spain in the three main steps of\r\nsetting up the Inquisition, expelling the Jews, and expelling the\r\nMoriscoes.\r\n\r\nOn the Portuguese as on the northern European coasts, seafaring commerce\r\narose on a basis of fishing;[943] agriculturally, save as to fruits and\r\nwines, Portugal was undeveloped; and the conquered Moorish territory,\r\nhanded over by the king in vast estates to feudal lords, who gave no\r\nintelligent encouragement to cultivation, long remained sparsely\r\npopulated.[944] The great commercial expansion began soon after King\r\nJohn II, egregiously known as \"the Perfect,\" suddenly and violently\r\nbroke the power of the feudal nobility (1483-84), a blow which made the\r\nking instantly a popular favourite, and which their feudal methods had\r\nleft the nobles unable to return. In the previous generation Prince\r\nHenry the Navigator had set up a great movement of maritime discovery,\r\ndirected to commercial ends; and from this beginning arose the\r\nremarkable but short-lived empire of Portugal in the Indies. That stands\r\nout from the later episodes of the Dutch and British empires in that, to\r\nbegin with, the movement of discovery was systematically fostered and\r\nsubsidised by the crown, Prince Henry giving the lead; and that in the\r\nsequel the whole commercial fruits of the process were the crown's\r\nmonopoly--a state of things as unfavourable to permanence as could well\r\nbe conceived. But even under more favourable conditions, though the\r\nPortuguese empire might have overborne the Dutch, it could hardly have\r\nmaintained itself against the British. The economic and military bases,\r\nas in the case of Holland, were relatively too narrow for the\r\nsuperstructure.\r\n\r\nWhat is most memorable in the Portuguese evolution is the simple process\r\nof discovery, which was scientifically and systematically conducted in\r\nthe hope of sailing round Africa to India. The list of results is worth\r\ndetailing. In 1419 Perestrello discovered the island of Porto Santa; in\r\n1420 Zarco and Vaz found Madeira, not before charted; and in the next\r\ntwenty years the Canary Islands, the Azores, Santa Maria, and St. Miguel\r\nswelled the list. In 1434 Cape Bojador was doubled by Gil Eannes, and\r\nthe Rio d'Ouro was reached in 1436 by Baldaya; in 1441 Nuno Tristan\r\nattained Cape Blanco; in 1445 he found the river Senegal; D. Dias\r\nreaching Guinea in the same year, and Cape Verde in 1446. From Tristan's\r\nvoyage of 1441 dates the slave trade, which now gave a sinister stimulus\r\nto the process of discovery; every cargo of negroes being eagerly bought\r\nfor the cheap cultivation of the Moorish lands, still poorly populated\r\nunder the feudal regimen.[945] The commercial and slave-trading purpose\r\nmay in part account for the piecemeal nature of the advance;[946] for it\r\nwas not till 1471 that the islands of Fernando Po were discovered and\r\nthe Equator crossed; and not till 1484 that Cam reached the Congo.[947]\r\nBut two years later Bartholomew Dias made the rest of the way to the\r\nCape of Good Hope, a much greater advance than had before been made in\r\nthirty years; and after a pause in the chronicles of eleven years, Vasco\r\nda Gama sailed from Lisbon to Calcutta. Meantime the Perfect king,\r\npreoccupied with the African route, made in 1488 his great mistake of\r\nfinally dismissing Columbus from his court as a visionary. Had Portugal\r\nadded the new hemisphere to her list of discoveries, it would have been\r\nstupendous indeed. As it is, this \"Celtic\" people, sailing in poor\r\nlittle vessels obviously not far developed from the primary\r\nfishing-smack, had done more for the navigation and charting of the\r\nworld than all the rest of Europe besides.\r\n\r\nAnd still the expansion went rapidly on; the reign of Manuel, \"the\r\nFortunate,\" reaping even more glory than that of his predecessor, who in\r\nturn had rewards denied to the pioneer promoter, Prince Henry. In the\r\nyear 1500 Brazil was reached by Cabral, and Labrador by Corte-Real; and\r\nin 1501 Castella discovered the islands of St. Helena and Ascension.\r\nAmerigo Vespucci, whose name came into the heritage of the discovery of\r\nColumbus, explored the Rio Plata and Paraguay in 1501-3; Coutinho did as\r\nmuch for Madagascar and the Mauritius in 1506; Almeida in 1507 found the\r\nMaldive Islands; Malacca and Sumatra were attached by Sequiera in 1509;\r\nthe Moluccas by Serrano in 1512; and the Ile de Bourbon in 1513 by\r\nMascarenhas. In eastern Asia, again, Coelho in 1516 sailed up the coast\r\nof Cochin China and explored Siam; Andrade reached Canton in 1517 and\r\nPekin in 1521; and in 1520 the invincible Magellan, entering the service\r\nof Spain,[948] achieved his great passage to the Pacific.[949] No such\r\ncentury of navigation had yet been seen; and all this dazzling\r\nenlargement of life and knowledge was being accomplished by one of the\r\nsmallest of the European kingdoms, while England was laggardly passing\r\nfrom the point of Agincourt, by the way of the Wars of the Roses, to\r\nthat of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, producing at that stage, indeed,\r\nMore's _Utopia_, but yielding no fruits meet therefor.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, there followed on the process of discovery the process of\r\ncommerce, the advantages accruing to the monarchic impulse and control\r\nwere absent. Always as rigidly restrictive in its pursuit of discovery\r\nand commerce as the ancient Carthaginians had been,[950] the Portuguese\r\ncrown was as much more restrictive than they in its practice as an\r\nabsolute monarchy is more concentrated than an oligarchy. Whatever\r\nprogress was achieved by the Portuguese in India was in the way of\r\nvigorous conquest and administration by capable governors like\r\nAlbuquerque (_d._ 1515) and Da Castro (_d._ 1548), of whom the first\r\nshowed not only military but conciliatory capacity, and planned what\r\nmight have been a triumphant policy of playing off Hindu princes against\r\nMohammedan. But the restrictive home-policy was fatal to successful\r\nempire-building where the conditions called for the most constant output\r\nof energy. Though the Portuguese race has shown greater viability in\r\nIndia than either the Dutch or the English, it could not but suffer\r\nheavily from the climate in the first days of adaptation. The death-rate\r\namong the early governors is startling; and the rank and file cannot\r\nhave fared much better.[951] All the while swarms of the more\r\nindustrious Portuguese, including many Jews, were passing to Brazil and\r\nsettling there.[952] To meet this drain there was needed the freest\r\nopening in India to private enterprise; whereas the Portuguese crown,\r\nkeeping in its own hands the whole of the Indian products extorted by\r\nits governors, and forcing them to send cargoes of gratis goods for the\r\nCrown to sell, limited enterprise in an unparalleled fashion.[953] The\r\noriginal work of discovery and factory-planting, indeed, could not have\r\nbeen accomplished by Portuguese private enterprise as then developed;\r\nbut the monarchic monopoly prevented its growth. The Jews had been\r\nexpelled (1496), and with them most of the acquired commercial skill of\r\nthe nation;[954] the nobles had become as subservient to and dependent\r\non the throne as those of Spain were later to be; and already the curse\r\nof empire was impoverishing the land as it was to do in Spain. As was\r\nfully realised in the eighteenth century by the great Pombal,[955] the\r\nmere possession of gold mines destroyed prosperity, the imaginary wealth\r\ndriving out the real; but before Portugal was ruined by her Brazilian\r\nmines she was enfeebled by the social diseases that afflicted ancient\r\nRome. Slave labour in the Moorish provinces drove out free; the rural\r\npopulation elsewhere thinned rapidly under the increasing drain of the\r\nexpeditions of discovery, colonisation, and conquest; and only in the\r\nrapidly increasing population of Lisbon, which trebled in eighty years,\r\nwas there any ostensible advance in wealth to show for the era of\r\nempire. Even in Lisbon, by the middle of the sixteenth century, the\r\nnegro slaves outnumbered the free citizens.[956] And over these\r\nconditions of economic and political decadence reigned the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal, as in Spain, the period of incipient political decay is the\r\nperiod of brilliant literature; the explanation being that in both cases\r\nmiddle-class and upper-class incomes were still large and the volume of\r\ntrade great, there being thus an economic demand for the arts, while the\r\nadministration was becoming inept and the empire weakening. In both\r\ncases, too, there was less waste of energy in war than in the ages\r\npreceding. As Lope de Vega and Calderon build up a brilliant drama after\r\nthe Armada and the loss of half the Netherlands, and Velasquez is\r\nsustained by Philip IV, so Camoens writes his epic, Gil Vicente his\r\nplays, and Barros his history, in the reign of John III, when Portugal\r\nis within a generation of being annexed to Spain, and within two\r\ngenerations of being bereft of her Asiatic empire by the Dutch. At such\r\na stage, when wealth still abounds, and men for lack of science are\r\nindifferent to such phenomena as multiplication of slaves and rural\r\ndepopulation, a large city public can evoke and welcome literature and\r\nart. It was so in Augustan Rome. And the sequel is congruous in all\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Morse Stephens in this connection affirms (_Portugal_, p. 259)\r\n     that \"it has always been the case in the history of a nation which\r\n     can boast of a golden age, that the epoch of its greatest glory is\r\n     that in which its literature chiefly flourished.... It was so with\r\n     Portugal. The age which witnessed the careers of its famous\r\n     captains and conquerors was also the age of its greatest poets and\r\n     prose writers.\" The proposition on inquiry will be found to be\r\n     inaccurate in its terms and fallacious in its implications. As\r\n     thus: (1) Greek literature is, on the whole, at its highest in the\r\n     period of Plato, Aristophanes, Euripides, and Aristotle; while the\r\n     period of \"glory\" or expansion must be placed either earlier or\r\n     later, under Alexander, when the golden age of literature is past.\r\n     (2) The synchronism equally breaks down in the case of Rome. There\r\n     is little literature in the period of the triumph over Cartilage;\r\n     and literature does not go on growing after Augustus, despite\r\n     continued military \"glory.\" Trajan had neither a Horace nor a\r\n     Virgil. (3) In England the \"glory\" of Marlborough's victories\r\n     evokes Addison, not Shakespeare, who does most of his greatest work\r\n     under James I. And though Chaucer chanced to flourish under Edward\r\n     III, there is no fine literature whatever alongside of the\r\n     conquests of Henry V. (4) In Germany, Schiller and Goethe, Fichte\r\n     and Hegel, wrote in a period of political subordination, and Heine\r\n     before the period of Bismarckism. Who are the great writers since?\r\n     (5) In France, the period of Napoleon is nearly blank of great\r\n     writers. They abounded after the fall of his empire and the loss of\r\n     his conquests. (6) The great literary period of Spain begins with\r\n     the decline of the Spanish empire. (7) The great modern literature\r\n     of the Scandinavian States has arisen without any national \"glory\"\r\n     to herald it.\r\n\r\n     It is hardly necessary to bring further evidence. It remains only\r\n     to point out that in Portugal itself the brilliant literary reign\r\n     is not the period of discovery, since all the great exploration had\r\n     been done before John III came to the throne. It is true that the\r\n     retrospect of an age of conquest and effort _may_ stimulate\r\n     literature in a later generation; but the true causation is in a\r\n     literary _plus_ a social sequence, though the _arrest_ of literary\r\n     development is always caused socially and politically. Portuguese\r\n     and Spanish literature and drama alike derive proximately from the\r\n     Italian Renaissance. When both polities were in full decadence,\r\n     with the Inquisition hung round their necks, their intellectual\r\n     life necessarily drooped. But it is pure fallacy to suppose--and\r\n     here Mr. Stephens would perhaps acquiesce--that a period of new\r\n     conquest is _needed_ to elicit new and original literature. Homer,\r\n     Plato, Dante, Boccaccio, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Bacon, Moliere,\r\n     Voltaire, Goethe, Leopardi, Poe, Balzac, Heine, Flaubert,\r\n     Hawthorne, Tourguenief, Ruskin, Ibsen--these are in no rational\r\n     sense by-products of militarism or \"expansion.\" Given the right\r\n     social and economic conditions, Spain and Portugal may in the\r\n     twentieth century produce greater literature than they ever had,\r\n     without owning a particle of foreign empire any more than do Sweden\r\n     and Norway.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the decline of the Portuguese empire are very apparent. At\r\nthe best, with its narrow economic basis in home production, it would\r\nhave had a hard struggle to beat off the attack of the Dutch and\r\nEnglish; but the royal policy, reducing all Portuguese life to\r\ndependence on the throne, had withered the national energies before the\r\nDutch attack was made. Hence the easy fall of the crown to Philip of\r\nSpain when, the succession failing, he chose to grasp it (1581): the\r\nnation had for the time lost the power of self-determination; and under\r\nthe Spanish dominion the Portuguese possessions in the Indies were\r\ndefended against the Dutch and English with but a moiety even of the\r\nenergy that a Portuguese king might have elicited. So the imposing\r\nbeginnings came well-nigh to naught, the Portuguese empire lasting in\r\nits entirety, as a trade monopoly, for just a hundred years. Within the\r\nfirst thirty or forty years of the seventeenth century Dutch and\r\nEnglish, Moslems, and even Danes, had captured from Spain-ruled Portugal\r\nthe Moluccas, Java, most of its Indian territory, its Persian and\r\nChinese settlements, and much of the coast of Brazil; and the two\r\nformer enemies harried at sea what Oriental trade it had kept. The rest\r\nof the Indian settlements were lost in the next generation. \"Empire\" had\r\nrun for Portugal the usual course.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that the new life of the nation began. In 1640 came\r\nthe successful revolt against Spain; and the Dutch power in Brazil,\r\nwhich had seemed decisively established under Prince Maurice of Nassau,\r\nwas entirely overthrown within ten years after his recall in 1644. In\r\nPortugal the revolution was primarily the work of the nobility,\r\nexasperated by Spanish arrogance and exclusiveness; but they were\r\neffectually supported by the people for the same reason; and the state\r\nof Spain, financially decrepit and embroiled in war abroad and rebellion\r\nin Catalonia, left the new dynasty of Braganza able to maintain itself,\r\nwith French help, against the clerical and other elements of pro-Spanish\r\nreaction. The overthrow of the Dutch in Brazil was almost against the\r\nnew king's will, for they had at first supported him against Spain; but\r\nthe movement there was as spontaneous, and fully as well justified, as\r\nthe revolt at home against Spain itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. _The Colonisation of Brazil_\r\n\r\nBrazil was and is in fact for Portugal the analogue to the North\r\nAmerican colonies of Britain. Where \"empire\" was sought in the Indies as\r\na means of revenue, savage Brazil, after the gold-seeking rush of 1530\r\nwhich first raised it above the status of a penal settlement, was a\r\ncolony, resorted to by men--many of them Jews--seeking freedom from the\r\nInquisition, and men driven from the soil by slave-labour seeking land\r\nto till for their own subsistence.[957] All things considered, it has\r\nbeen one of the soundest processes of colonisation in history. The low\r\nstate of the autochthonous inhabitants is sufficient proof of Buckle's\r\nproposition that there the combination of great heat and great moisture\r\nmade impossible a successful primary civilisation, nature being too\r\nunmanageable for the natural or primitive man.[958] The much higher\r\ndevelopment of pre-European civilisation not only in Mexico and Peru but\r\namong the North American Indians[959] can be explained in no other way.\r\nBut that science may not in time so exploit the natural forces as to\r\nturn them to the account of a high tertiary civilisation is an\r\nassumption we are not entitled to make, though Buckle apparently\r\ninclined to it. When he wrote, the population of Brazil was computed at\r\nsix millions. To-day it stands at over twenty-three millions;[960] and\r\nin Brazil the prospect has never been reckoned otherwise than hopeful.\r\nThe progress all along, relatively to the obstacles, has been so great\r\nthat there is no visible ground for anticipating any arrest in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, from the first, individual and collective energy had the\r\nchance that the royal monopoly denied to the Asiatic settlements. There\r\nwas here no exigible revenue to arrange for; and the first colonists,\r\nbeing left to themselves, set up local self-government with elected\r\nmilitary magistrates called captains[961]--an evolution more remarkable\r\nthan any which took place in the first century of English colonisation\r\nin North America. The first governor-general sent out, Alfonso de Sousa,\r\nhad the wisdom to preserve and develop the system of captaincies;[962]\r\nand colonisation went steadily on throughout the century. It was first\r\nsought, as a matter of course, to enslave the natives; but the attempt\r\nled only to a race-war such as grew up later in the New England\r\ncolonies; and in the Catholic as later in the Protestant colonies resort\r\nwas had to the importation of negroes, already so common as slaves in\r\nPortugal. With a much slower rate of progress, the Brazilians have in\r\nthe end come much better than the North Americans out of the social\r\ndiseases thus set up.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Jesuits had a missionary success among the\r\naborigines such as the Puritans never approached in North America, thus\r\neventually arresting the race-struggle and securing the native stock as\r\nan element of population--a matter of obvious importance, in view of the\r\nfactor of climate. And whereas the labours of the Jesuits in India had\r\nbeen turned to naught by the Inquisition which they brought in their\r\ntrain, Brazil was by the wisdom of the early governors saved from that\r\nscourge.[963] Thus fortunately restrained by the civil power, the\r\nJesuits did a large part of the work of civilising Brazil. So long as\r\nthe stage of race-war lasted--and till far on in the seventeenth century\r\nit was chronic and murderous[964]--they strove to protect the natives\r\nwhom they converted.[965] It is noteworthy, too, that just before\r\nexpelling the Jesuit order from Portugal in 1759, by which time it had\r\nbecome a wealthy and self-seeking trading corporation in Brazil,[966]\r\nthe Marquis of Pombal secured the emancipation in Brazil[967] of all the\r\nIndians who had there been enslaved as a result of the old race-wars,\r\nthus giving effect to a law which the Jesuits had got passed in 1680\r\nwithout being able to enforce it against the slave-owners.[968] And it\r\nis apparently due in part to the culture they maintained[969] that,\r\nthough the emancipation of the negroes was to be delayed till late in\r\nthe nineteenth century, an energetic plea was made for them by a\r\nPortuguese advocate of Batria at the time of the emancipation of the\r\nIndians.[970] Their own degeneration into a wealth-amassing corporation\r\nwas an exact economic duplication of the process that had occurred in\r\nEurope among all the monastic and chivalrous orders of the Middle Ages\r\nin succession.[971]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century Brazil, still limited, for its direct trade,\r\nto Portugal, so prospered that the loss of empire in Asia was much more\r\nthan compensated even to the royal revenue of Portugal; the new\r\ndiscoveries of gold bringing for a time as much as L300,000 a year to\r\nthe treasury under the system by which, the goldfields remaining free to\r\ntheir exploiters, the crown received a fifth of the total export.[972]\r\nThe trouble was that the influx of gold in Portugal, as in Spain,\r\nparalysed industry; and the country became poorer in a double ratio to\r\nits bullion revenue;[973] and not till this was scientifically realised\r\ncould a sound polity be raised. But in Portugal itself, after the advent\r\nof the anti-clerical Marquis of Pombal, there went on as striking a\r\nregeneration of government (1750-77) as occurred in Spain under Charles\r\nIII; and though the storms of the French Revolution, and the tyrannous\r\nreactions which followed it, fell as heavily on Portugal as on the rest\r\nof the peninsula, its lot is to-day hopeful enough. In common with those\r\nof Spain and Italy, its literature shows plenty of fresh intellectual\r\nlife; and, again as in their case, its worst trouble is a heritage of\r\nbad finance, rather than any lack of progressive intelligence. With\r\nsound government, the large outlet offered by Brazil to emigration\r\nshould make Portugal a place of plenty--if, that is, its burden of debt\r\nbe not too great. But herein lies a problem of special importance for\r\nthe people of Great Britain. Portugal, like Britain, began to accumulate\r\na national debt in the period of chronic European war; but between 1850\r\nand 1890 the sum had actually multiplied tenfold, rising from\r\ntwenty-five to two hundred and fifty-eight millions of milreis; and at\r\nthe close of 1910 it stood at over one thousand millions, the interest\r\nupon which constitutes two-fifths of the total national expenditure. All\r\nthe while, the balance of productivity is more and more heavily on the\r\nside of Brazil. As a similar evolution may conceivably take place within\r\nthe next century or two in England, it will be of peculiar interest to\r\nnote how Portugal handles the problem. When the English coal supply is\r\nexhausted, a vast debt, it is to be feared, may be left to a population\r\nill-capable of sustaining it; and the apparently inevitable result will\r\nbe such a drift of population from Britain to America or Australia as\r\nnow goes from Portugal to Brazil, leaving the home population all the\r\nless able to bear its financial burden. It is difficult to see how any\r\narrangement, save a composition with creditors, can meet the Portuguese\r\ncase.[974] Yet within the last twenty years Lisbon has been enormously\r\nimproved; and if but the law of 1844 prescribing compulsory education\r\ncould be enforced, Portuguese resources might be so developed as to\r\nsolve the problem progressively. As it is, the nation is still largely\r\nilliterate--a heavy handicap.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Brazil, after passing from the status of colony to that of\r\nkingdom or so-called \"empire,\" has become a republic, like the other\r\nIberian States of South America; and throughout the nineteenth century\r\nits development has been comparatively fortunate. The flight of the\r\nPortuguese king[975] thither in 1808 gave it independent standing\r\nwithout its paying the price of war; whence came free trade with the\r\nfriendly States of Europe; and when on the return of the king it\r\ninsisted on maintaining its independence under his son, against the\r\njealous effort of the Portuguese Cortes to reduce it to a group of\r\ndependent provinces,[976] the tradition of freedom set up by its past\r\nprevailed. Thus the Brazilians effected peacefully what the English\r\ncolonies in North America achieved only by an embittering and exhausting\r\nwar; and so far as those of us can judge who are not at home in\r\nPortuguese literature, the culture evolution in Brazil at the date of\r\nthe French Revolution had on some lines equalled that of the United\r\nStates.[977] But where the United States were in educative and enriching\r\ncontact with the relatively high civilisations of England and France,\r\nBrazil could still draw only on the relatively small intellectual and\r\ncommercial stores of Portugal, with some addition from general commerce\r\nwith Europe. It was in the latter half of the century, when intellectual\r\ninfluences from France had been prevalent, that Brazilian possibilities\r\nbegan to emphasise themselves.\r\n\r\nNorth American evolution has in the nineteenth century been especially\r\nrapid because of several great economic factors: (1) the tobacco and\r\ncotton culture of the period before the civil war; (2) the very large\r\nimmigration from Europe; (3) the rush for gold to California, hastening\r\nthe development of the West; (4) the abundant yield of coal and iron,\r\nquickening every species of manufacture, especially after (5) a large\r\ninflux of cheap European labour in the last decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. No one of these special factors has been potent in Brazil, save\r\nfor the latterly rapid increase of immigration; there is no great staple\r\nof produce that thus far outgoes competition, unless it be caoutchouc;\r\nthe precious metals are not now abundant; and there is practically no\r\ncoal, though there is infinite iron. But these are conditions merely of\r\na relatively slow development, not of unprogressiveness; and the\r\npresumption is that they will prove beneficent. The rapid commercial\r\ndevelopment of the United States is excessively capitalistic, in virtue\r\nlargely of the factor of coal, and the consequent disproportionate\r\nstress of manufactures. The outstanding result is a hard-driven\r\ncompetitive life for the mass of the population, with the prospect ahead\r\nof industrial convulsions, in addition to the nightmare of the\r\nrace-hatred between black and white--a desperate problem, from which\r\nBrazil seems to have been saved. There the problem of slavery was later\r\nfaced than in the United States, partly, perhaps, because there the\r\nslave was less cruelly treated; but the result of the delay was\r\naltogether good. There was no civil war; the process of emancipation was\r\ngradual, beginning in 1871 and finishing with a leap in 1885-88; and no\r\nrace-hatred has been left behind.[978] Those whose political philosophy\r\nbegins and ends with a belief in the capacities of the \"Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace\" would do well to note these facts.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil the process of emancipation, long favoured as elsewhere by the\r\nliberal minds,[979] was peacefully forced on by economic pressure. It\r\nwas seen that slave labour was a constant check to the immigration of\r\nfree labour, and therefore to the development of the country.[980] When\r\nthis had become clear, emancipation was only a question of time. The\r\nsame development would inevitably have come about in North America; and\r\nit is not a proof of any special \"Anglo-Saxon\" faculty for government\r\nthat the process there was precipitated by one of the bloodiest wars of\r\nthe modern world, and has left behind it one of the blackest problems by\r\nwhich any civilisation is faced. The frequent European comments on the\r\nrevolutions of South America are apt to set up an illusion. All told,\r\nthose crises represent perhaps less evil than was involved in the North\r\nAmerican Civil War; and they are hardly greater moral evils than the\r\npeaceful growth of financial corruption in the North. In any case, the\r\nonly revolution in Brazil since the outbreak of 1848 has been the no\r\nless peaceful than remarkable episode of 1889, which dethroned the\r\nEmperor Pedro II and made Brazil a republic. There was as much of pathos\r\nas of promise in the event, for Pedro had been one of the very best\r\nmonarchs of the century; but at least the bloodless change was in\r\nkeeping with his reign and his benign example,[981] and may indeed be\r\nreckoned a due result of them.\r\n\r\nIn fine, Brazil--in common with other parts of South America--has a fair\r\nchance of being one day the scene of a civilisation morally and socially\r\nhigher than that now evolving in North America. What may be termed the\r\ncoal-civilisations, with their factitious rapidity of exploitation, are\r\nin the nature of the case relatively ugly and impermanent. That cannot\r\nwell be the highest civilisation which multiplies by the myriad its\r\nserfs of the mine, and by the million its slaves of the machine. In\r\nSouth America the lack of coal promises escape from the worst\r\ndevelopments of capitalism,[982] inasmuch as labour there must be mainly\r\nspent on and served by the living processes and forces of nature, there\r\nso immeasurable and so inexhaustible of beauty. Fuel enough for sane\r\nindustry is supplied by the richest woods on the planet; and the\r\nBrazilian climate, even now singularly wholesome over immense\r\nareas,[983] may become still more generally so by control of vegetation.\r\nIt is a suggestive fact that there the common bent, though still far\r\nshort of mastery, is in an exceptional degree towards the high arts of\r\nform and sound.[984] It may take centuries to evoke from a population\r\nwhich quietly embraces the coloured types of South America and Africa\r\nthe aesthetic progress of which it is capable;[985] but the very fact\r\nthat these types play their physical and artistic part in the growth is\r\na promise special to the case. And if thus the \"Latin\" races--for it is\r\nItalians, Portuguese, Spaniards, and French-speaking Belgians who\r\nchiefly make up the immigrants, though there is a German element\r\nalso--build up a humanly catholic and soundly democratic life in that\r\npart of the planet most prodigally served by nature, subduing to their\r\nneed the vast living forces which overpowered the primitive man, and at\r\nthe same time escaping the sinister gift of subterranean fuel--if thus\r\nthey build up life rather than dead wealth, they will have furthered\r\nincomparably the general deed of man. But it is part of the hope set up\r\nby the slower rate of a progress which overtakes and keeps pace with\r\nnature, instead of forestalling the yearly service of the sun, that when\r\nit reaches greatness it will have outlived the instincts of racial pride\r\nand hate which have been the shame and the stumbling-block of the\r\npreceding ages. Should \"little\" Portugal be the root of such a growth,\r\nher part will surely have been sufficient. But in the meantime Portugal\r\nand Brazil alike suffer from illiteracy, the bane of the Catholic\r\ncountries;[986] and that priest-wrought evil must be remedied if their\r\nhigher life is to be maintained.\r\n\r\nUntil this vital drawback is removed the possible social gain to\r\nPortugal from the revolution of 1910 cannot be realised. A republic is\r\nmore favourable to progress than a monarchy only in so far as it gives\r\nfreer play and fuller furtherance to all forms of energy; and in the\r\nstill priest-ridden Peninsula the resistance of sacerdotalism to\r\ndemocratic rule is a great stumbling-block. The Republic of Portugal\r\nneeds time to establish itself aright. Citizens of more \"advanced\"\r\ncountries are wont to criticise with asperity shortcomings of\r\nadministration in the \"new\" States of our time which were fully\r\nparalleled in their own in the past. Englishmen who make comparisons\r\nbetween their own political system and that of countries whose\r\nconstitutions have been reshaped within the present century would do\r\nwell to consider the state of English government in the latter part of\r\nthe eighteenth century, after a hundred years of constitutional freedom.\r\nNay, in a country where the great parties in our own time perpetually\r\naccuse each other of gross and unscrupulous misgovernment,\r\ndisparagements of the politics of countries which only recently attained\r\nself-government are obviously open to discount. Suffice it that\r\nPortugal, albeit by a _via dolorosa_ of violence trodden by other\r\npeoples before her, has reaffirmed her part in the movement of\r\ncivilisation towards a larger and a better life, thus giving the\r\nhundredth disproof to the formulas which deny the potentiality of\r\nadvance to States which have known decadence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 942: _The Story of Portugal_, by Mr. H.

Thus\r\nfar, though education is good, books have been relatively scarce because\r\nof their dearness. Here again the United States had an immense\r\npreliminary advantage in their ability to reproduce at low prices the\r\nworks of English authors, paying nothing to the writers; a state of\r\nthings which subsisted long after the States had produced great writers\r\nof their own.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 986: In Portugal, \"by a law enacted in 1844, primary education\r\nis compulsory; but only a small fraction of the children of the lower\r\nclasses really attend school\" (_Statesman's Year-Book_).

Education\r\nis still non-compulsory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nENGLISH HISTORY DOWN TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE GREAT REBELLION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is after the great Civil War that English political development\r\nbecomes most directly instructive, because it is thenceforward that the\r\nmodern political conditions begin to be directly traceable.\r\nConstitutional or parliamentary monarchy takes at that point a virtually\r\nnew departure. But we shall be better prepared to follow the play of the\r\nforces of attraction and repulsion, union and strife, in the modern\r\nperiod, if we first realise how in the ages of feudal monarchy and\r\npersonal monarchy, as the previous periods have been conveniently named,\r\nthe same fundamental forces were at work in different channels. The\r\nfurther we follow these forces back the better we are prepared to\r\nconceive political movement in terms of naturalist as opposed to\r\nverbalist formulas. Above all things, we must get rid of the habit of\r\nexplaining each phenomenon in terms of the abstraction of itself--as\r\nPuritanism by \"the Puritan spirit,\" Christian civilisation by\r\n\"Christianity,\" and English history by \"the English character.\" We are\r\nto look for the causation of the Puritan spirit and English conduct and\r\nthe religion of the hour in the interplay of general instincts and\r\nparticular circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, the conventional views as to the bias of the\r\n\"Anglo-Saxon race\"[987] are seen on the least scrutiny to be excluded by\r\nthe facts. Credited with an innate bent to seafaring, the early English\r\nare found to have virtually abandoned the sea after settling in\r\nEngland;[988] the new conditions altering the sea-going bent just as the\r\nolder had made it, and continued to do in the case of the Scandinavians.\r\nCredited in the same fashion with a racial bias to commerce, they are\r\nfound to have been uncommercial, unadventurous, home-staying; and it\r\ntook centuries of continental influences to make them otherwise. Up to\r\nthe fourteenth century \"almost the whole of English trade was in the\r\nhands of aliens.\"[989] And of what trade the \"free\" Anglo-Saxons did\r\nconduct, the most important branch seems to have been the slave\r\ntrade.[990] As to the mass of the population, whatever were their actual\r\nlife-conditions--and as to this we have very little knowledge--they were\r\ncertainly not the \"free barbarians\" of the old Teutonic legend. Unfree\r\nin some sense they mostly were; and all that we have seen of the early\r\nevolution of Greece and Rome goes to suggest that their status was\r\nessentially depressed. In the words of a close student, English economic\r\nhistory \"begins with the serfdom of the masses of the rural population\r\nunder Saxon rule--a serfdom from which it has taken a thousand years of\r\nEnglish economic evolution to set them free.\"[991] This is perhaps an\r\nover-statement: serfdom suggests general predial slavery; and this\r\ncannot be shown to have existed. But those who repel the proposition\r\nseem to take no account of the _tendency_ towards popular depression in\r\nearly settled communities.[992] If we stand by the terminology of\r\nDomesday Book, we are far indeed from the conception of a population of\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\n     That the mass of the \"Saxon\" English (who included many of\r\n     non-Saxon descent) were more or less \"unfree\" is a conclusion\r\n     repeatedly reached on different lines of research. Long ago, the\r\n     popular historian Sharon Turner wrote that \"There can be no doubt\r\n     that nearly three-fourths of the Anglo-Saxon population were in a\r\n     state of slavery\" (_History of the Anglo-Saxons_, 4th ed. 1823,\r\n     iii, 255); and he is here supported by his adversary Dunham\r\n     (_Europe during the Middle Ages_, Cab. Cyc. 1834, iii, 49-52).\r\n     J.M. Kemble later admitted that the \"whole population in some\r\n     districts were unfree\" (_The Saxons in England_, reprint, 1876, i,\r\n     189). Yet another careful student sums up that \"at the time of the\r\n     Conquest we find the larger portion of the inhabitants of England\r\n     in a state of villenage\" (J.F. Morgan, _England under the Normans_,\r\n     1858, p. 61). (The interesting question of the racial elements of\r\n     the population at and after the Conquest is fully discussed by the\r\n     Rev. Geoffrey Hill, _Some Consequences of the Norman Conquest_,\r\n     1904, ch. i.)\r\n\r\n     Later and closer research does but indicate gradations in the\r\n     status of the unfree--gradations which seem to have varied\r\n     arbitrarily in terms of local law. (On this, however, see Morgan,\r\n     p. 62.) The Domesday Book specifies multitudes of _villani_,\r\n     _servi_, _bordarii_ (or _cotarii_), as well as (occasionally) large\r\n     numbers of _sochmanni_, and _liberi homines_. In Cornwall there\r\n     were only six chief proprietors, with 1,738 _villani_, 2,441\r\n     _bordarii_, and 1,148 _servi_; in Devonshire, 8,246 _villani_,\r\n     4,814 _bordarii_, and 3,210 _servi_; in Gloucestershire, 3,071\r\n     _villani_, 1,701 _bordarii_, and 2,423 _servi_; while in\r\n     Lincolnshire there were 11,322 _sochmanni_, 7,168 _villani_, 3,737\r\n     _bordarii_; and in Norfolk 4,528 _villani_, 8,679 _bordarii_, 1,066\r\n     _servi_, 5,521 _sochmanni_, and 4,981 _liberi homines_. (Cp. Sharon\r\n     Turner, as cited, vol. iii, bk. viii, ch. 9.) Thus the largest\r\n     numbers of ostensible freemen are found in the lately settled\r\n     Danish districts, and the largest number of slaves where most of\r\n     the old British population survived (Ashley, _Economic History_,\r\n     1888, i, 17, 18; Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and\r\n     Commerce_, 1891, i, 88). \"The eastern counties are the home of\r\n     liberty\" (Maitland, _Domesday Book and Beyond_, p. 23). The main\r\n     totals are: _bordarii_, 82,119; _villani_, 108,407; _servi_,\r\n     25,156; that is, 215,000 heads of families, roughly speaking, all\r\n     of whom were more or less \"unfree,\" out of an entire enumerated\r\n     male population of 300,000.\r\n\r\n     The constant tendency was to reduce all shades to one of _nativi_\r\n     or born villeins (Stubbs, _Constitutional History_, 4th ed. i,\r\n     465); that is to say, the number of absolute serfs tends to lessen,\r\n     their status being gradually improved, while higher grades tend to\r\n     be somewhat lowered. Prof. Vinogradoff's research, which aims at\r\n     correcting Mr. Seebohm's, does but disclose that villenage in\r\n     general had three aspects:--\"Legal theory and political\r\n     disabilities would fain make it all but slavery; the manorial\r\n     system ensures it something of the character of the Roman\r\n     _colonatus_; there is a stock of freedom in it which speaks of\r\n     Saxon tradition\" (_Villainage in England_, 1892, p. 137; cp.\r\n     Seebohm, as cited, p. 409; and Stubbs, Sec. 132, i, 462-65). Even the\r\n     comparatively \"free\" socmen were tied to the land and were not\r\n     independent yeomen (Ashley, i, 19); and even \"freedmen\" were often\r\n     tied to a specified service by the act of manumission (Dunham, as\r\n     cited, iii, 51). As to Teutonic slavery in general, cp. C.-F.\r\n     Allen, _Histoire de Danemark_, French tr. 1878, i, 41-44, and U.R.\r\n     Burke, _History of Spain_, Hume's ed. 1900, i, 116; as to France,\r\n     cp. Guizot, _Essais sur l'Histoire de France_, edit. 1847, pp.\r\n     162-72; _Histoire de la civilisation en France_, 13e edit. iii,\r\n     172, 190-203; and as to the Netherlands, see above, pp. 295-96.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency on the one hand to exaggerate the significance of\r\nthe data, as when we identify the lot of an ancient serf or villein with\r\nthat of a negro in the United States of sixty years ago;[993] and on the\r\nother hand to forget, in familiarity with scholarly research, the\r\ninevitable moral bearing of all degrees of bondage. The _villanus_ \"both\r\nis and is not a free man\"; but the \"not\" is none the less morally\r\nsignificant: \"though he may be _liber homo_, he is not _francus_\";[994]\r\nand his name carries a slur. An immeasurable amount of moral history is\r\nconveyed in the simple fact that \"slave\" was always a term of abuse;\r\nthat \"villain\" is just \"villein\"; that \"caitiff\" is just \"captive\"; and\r\nthat \"churl\" is just \"ceorl.\" So the \"neif\" (= _naif_ = native) becomes\r\nthe \"knave\";[995] the \"scullion\" the \"blackguard\"; and the homeless\r\nwanderer the \"vagabond\"; even as for the Roman \"the guest,\" _hostis_,\r\nwas \"the enemy.\" The \"rogue\" has doubtless a similar descent, and \"rogue\r\nand peasant-slave\" in Tudor times, when slavery had ceased, stood for\r\nall things contemptible. Men degrade and impoverish their fellows, and\r\nout of the created fact of deprivation make their worst aspersions;\r\nnever asking who or what it is that thus turns human beings into\r\nscullions, churls, blackguards, knaves, caitiffs, rogues, and villains.\r\nThe Greeks knew that a man enslaved was a man demoralised; but saw in\r\nthe knowledge no motive for change of social tactics. Still less did the\r\nSaxons; for their manumissions at the bidding of the priest were but\r\npenitential acts, in no way altering the general drift of things.\r\n\r\n     Green (_Short History_, ch. i, Sec. 6, ed. 1881, pp. 54, 55), laying\r\n     stress on the manumissions, asserts that under Edgar \"slavery was\r\n     gradually disappearing before the efforts of the Church.\" But this\r\n     is going far beyond the evidence. Green seems to have assumed that\r\n     the laws framed by Dunstan were efficacious; but they clearly were\r\n     not. (Cp. C. Edmond Maurice, _Tyler, Bale, and Oldcastle_, 1875,\r\n     pp. 14-18.) Kemble rightly notes--here going deeper than Prof.\r\n     Vinogradoff--that there was a constant process of new slave-making\r\n     (_Saxons_, i, 183-84; cp. Maitland, p. 31); and in particular\r\n     notes how \"the honours and security of service became more\r\n     anxiously desired than a needy and unsafe freedom\" (p. 184). There\r\n     is in short a law of worsenment in a crude polity as in an advanced\r\n     one. Green himself says of the slave class that it \"sprang mainly\r\n     from debt or crime\" (_The Making of England_, 1885, p. 192; cp.\r\n     _Short History_, p. 13). But debt and \"crime\" were always arising.\r\n     Compare his admissions in _The Conquest of England_, 2nd ed. pp.\r\n     444, 445. Elsewhere he admits that slaves were multiplied by the\r\n     mutual wars of the Saxons (p. 13); and Kemble, recognising \"crime\"\r\n     as an important factor, agrees (i, 186) with Eichhorn and Grimm in\r\n     seeing in war and conquest the \"principal and original cause of\r\n     slavery in all its branches.\" A battle would make more slaves in a\r\n     day than were manumitted in a year. Some slaves indeed, as in the\r\n     Roman Empire, were able to buy their freedom (Maurice, as cited, p.\r\n     20, and refs.; Dunham, as cited, iii, 51); but there can have been\r\n     few such cases. (Cp. C.-F. Allen, _Histoire de Danemark_, French\r\n     tr. i, 41-44, as to the general tendencies of Teutonic slavery.)\r\n     The clergy for a time promoted enfranchisement, and even set an\r\n     example in order to widen their own basis of power; but as Green\r\n     later notes (ch. v, Sec. 4, p. 239) the Church in the end promoted\r\n     \"emancipation, as a work of piety, on all estates but its own.\"\r\n     Green further makes the vital admission that \"the decrease of\r\n     slavery was more than compensated by the increasing degradation of\r\n     the bulk of the people.... Religion had told against political\r\n     independence\"--for the Church played into the hands of the king.\r\n\r\n     During the Danish invasions, which involved heavy taxation\r\n     (_Danegeld_) to buy off the invaders, slavery increased and\r\n     worsened; and Cnut's repetition of the old laws against the foreign\r\n     slave trade can have availed little (Maurice, as cited, pp. 23-24).\r\n     Prof. Abdy, after recognising that before the Conquest English\r\n     liberties were disappearing like those of France (_Lectures on\r\n     Feudalism_, 1890, pp. 322, 326-27, 331), argues that, though the\r\n     tenure of the villein was servile, he in person was not bond (App.\r\n     p. 428). \"Bond\" is, of course, a term of degree, like others; but\r\n     if \"not bond\" means \"freeman,\" the case will not stand. The sole\r\n     argument is that \"had he been so [bond], it is difficult to\r\n     understand his admission into the conference [in the procedure of\r\n     the Domesday Survey] apparently on an equality with the other\r\n     members of the inquest.\" Now he was plainly not on an equality. The\r\n     inquest was to be made through the sheriff, the lord of the manor,\r\n     the parish priest, the reeve, the bailiff, and _six_ villeins out\r\n     of each hamlet (_Id._ p. 360). It is pretty clear that the villeins\r\n     were simply witnesses to check, if need were, the statements of\r\n     their superiors.\r\n\r\n     The weightiest argument against the darker view of Saxon serfdom is\r\n     the suggestion of the late Prof. Maitland (_Domesday Book_, p. 223)\r\n     that the process of technical subordination, broadly called\r\n     feudalism, was really a process of infusion of law and order. But\r\n     he confessedly made out no clear case, and historical analogy is\r\n     against him.\r\n\r\n     Finally, though under the Normans the Saxon slaves appear to have\r\n     gained as beside the middle grades of peasants (Morgan, _England\r\n     under the Normans_, p. 225; Ashley, i, 18), it is a plain error to\r\n     state that the Bristol slave-trade was suppressed under William by\r\n     \"the preaching of Wulfstan, and the influence of Lanfranc\" (Green,\r\n     _Short History_, p. 55; also in longer _History_, i, 127; so also\r\n     Bishop Stubbs, i, 463, _note_. The true view is put by Maurice, as\r\n     cited, p. 30). The historian incidentally reveals later (_Short\r\n     History_, ch. vii, Sec. 8, p. 432, proceeding on Giraldus Cambrensis,\r\n     _Expugnatio Hiberniae_, lib. i, c. 18) that \"at the time of Henry\r\n     II's accession Ireland was full of Englishmen who had been\r\n     kidnapped and sold into slavery, in spite of Royal prohibitions and\r\n     the spiritual menaces of the English Church.\" (Cp. Hallam, _Middle\r\n     Ages_, iii, 316, _note_.) He admits, too (p. 55), that \"a hundred\r\n     years later than Dunstan the wealth of English nobles was sometimes\r\n     said to spring from breeding slaves for the market.\" The \"market\"\r\n     was for concubines and prostitutes, as well as for labourers. (Cp.\r\n     Southey, _Book of the Church_, ed. 1824, i, 115, following William\r\n     of Malmesbury; and Hallam, as last cited.) Gibbon justifiably\r\n     infers (ch. 38, Bohn ed. iv, 227) that the children of the Roman\r\n     slave market of the days of Gregory the Great, _non Angli sed\r\n     angeli_, were sold into slavery by their parents. \"From the first\r\n     to the last age,\" he holds, the Anglo-Saxons \"persisted in this\r\n     unnatural practice.\" Cp. Maurice, as cited, pp. 4-5. Gregory\r\n     actually encouraged the traffic in English slaves after he became\r\n     Pope. (_Ep. to Candidus_, cited in pref. to Mrs. Elstoh's trans. of\r\n     the Anglo-Saxon Homily, p. xi.)\r\n\r\n     Thus, under Saxon, Danish, and Norman law alike, a slave trade\r\n     persisted for centuries. As regards the conditions of domestic\r\n     slavery, it seems clear that the Conquest lowered the status of the\r\n     half-free; but on the other hand \"there was a great decrease in the\r\n     number of slaves in Essex between the years 1065 and 1085\" (Morgan,\r\n     as cited, p. 225; cp. Maitland, p. 35).\r\n\r\nIn Saxondom, for centuries before the Conquest, \"history\" is made\r\nchiefly by the primitive forces of tribal and local animosity, the\r\nNorthmen coming in to complicate the insoluble strifes of the earlier\r\nEnglish, partly uniting these against them, dominating some, and getting\r\nultimately absorbed in the population, but probably constituting for\r\nlong an extra source of conflict in domestic politics. A broad\r\ndifference of accent, as in the Scandinavian States down to our own day,\r\nis often a strain on fellowship. In any case, the Anglo-Saxons at the\r\ntime of the Conquest, as always from the time of their own entry, showed\r\nthemselves utterly devoid of the \"gift of union\" which has been ascribed\r\nto their \"race,\" as to the Roman. No \"Celts\" were ever more hopelessly\r\ndivided: the Battle of Hastings is the crowning proof.[996] And in the\r\nabsence of leading and stimulus from a higher culture, so little\r\nprogressive force is there in a group of struggling barbaric communities\r\nthat there was only the scantiest political and other improvement in\r\nSaxon England during hundreds of years. When Alfred strove to build up a\r\ncivilisation, he turned as a matter of course to the Franks.[997] The\r\none civilising force was that of the slight contacts kept up with the\r\nContinent, perhaps the most important being the organisation of the\r\nChurch. It was the Norman Conquest, bringing with it a multitude of new\r\ncontacts, and an entrance of swarms of French and Flemish artificers and\r\nclerics, that decisively began the civilisation of England. The Teutonic\r\nbasis, barbarous as it was, showed symptoms of degeneration rather than\r\nof development. In brief, France was mainly civilised through Italy;\r\nEngland was mainly civilised through France.\r\n\r\n     Bishop Stubbs, after admitting as much (Sec. 91, i, 269, 270) and\r\n     noting the Norman \"genius for every branch of organisation,\"\r\n     proceeds to say \"that the Norman polity had very little substantial\r\n     organisation of its own, and that it was native energy that wrought\r\n     the subsequent transformation.\" His own pages supply the disproof.\r\n     See in particular as to the legislative and administrative activity\r\n     of Henry II, Sec. 147, i, 530-33. As to the arrest or degeneration of\r\n     the Saxon civilisation, cp. Sec. 79, i, 227, 228; Sharon Turner,\r\n     _History of England during the Middle Ages_, 2nd ed. i, 1, 73; H.W.\r\n     C. Davis, _England under the Normans and the Angevins_, 1905, p. 1;\r\n     Pearson, _History of England during the Early and Middle Ages_,\r\n     1867, i, 288, 308-12, 321, 343, 346, 347; Abdy, as cited above. Mr.\r\n     Pearson's testimony, it should be noted, is that of a partisan and\r\n     eulogist of the \"race.\"\r\n\r\n     Gneist, after deciding that the number of the unfree population\r\n     \"erscheint nicht uebergross,\" admits that the dependent stratum of\r\n     the population must needs always increase, \"as a result of the land\r\n     system. In time of war the class increased through the ruin of the\r\n     small holdings; in time of peace through the increase of the\r\n     landless members of families. The favourable effects of a new\r\n     acquisition through conquest and booty were a gain only to the\r\n     possessing class\" (_Geschichte des englischen Self-Government_,\r\n     1863, p. 7). He concludes that \"the social structure of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxons appears to be on the whole unchanging, advancing only\r\n     in the multiplication of the dependent classes.\" Among the symptoms\r\n     of degeneration may be noted the retirement of nearly thirty kings\r\n     and queens into convents or reclusion during the seventh and eighth\r\n     centuries. This was presumably a result of clerical management.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy itself, however, half a century before the Conquest, there\r\nhad arisen a state of extreme tension between the peasantry and their\r\nlords; and a projected rising was crushed in germ with horrible\r\ncruelty.[998] William's enterprise thus stood for a pressure of need\r\namong his own subjects, as well as for an outburst of feudal ambition;\r\nand in making up his force he offered an opportunity of plunder to all\r\nclasses in his own duchy, as well as to those of other provinces of\r\nFrance. Domesday Book, says one of its keenest students, \"is a geld\r\nbook\"--a survey made to facilitate taxation on the lines of the old\r\nDanegeld.[999] William was repeating a Roman process. His invasion,\r\ntherefore, hardly represented the full play of the existing forces of\r\ncivilisation. These, indeed, had to be renewed again and again in the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. But the conditions of the Conquest\r\nwere important for the direction of English political evolution. Its\r\nfirst social and psychological effect was to set up new class relations,\r\nand in particular a marked division between aristocracy and people, who\r\nspoke different languages. This involved a relation of distrust and\r\nclose class union. When the people's speech began to compete with that\r\nof their masters, and the nobles separately began to be on good terms\r\nwith their people, there would arise wide possibilities of strife as\r\nbetween neighbouring nobles and their retainers; and in Scotland the\r\nweakness of the crown long gave this free play. But in England,\r\nespecially after the period of anarchy under Stephen, when the early\r\nbaronage was much weakened and many estates were redivided,[1000] the\r\nstrength of the crown, rooted in military custom and constantly securing\r\nitself, tended to unite the nobles as a class for their own\r\naggrandisement and protection. King after king, therefore, sought the\r\nsupport of the people[1001] against the baronage, as the baronage\r\nsought their help against the king; while the Church fought for its own\r\nshare of power and privilege.\r\n\r\nThe history of Christendom, indeed, cannot be understood save in the\r\nlight of the fact that the Church, a continuous corporation owning much\r\nproperty as such, is as it were a State within the State,[1002]\r\nrepresenting a special source of strife, although its non-military\r\ncharacter limits the danger. What the Church has repeatedly done is to\r\nthrow in its lot with king or nobles, or with the democracy (as in\r\nSwitzerland and Protestant Scotland), according as its economic\r\ninterests dictate. The famous case of Becket, transformed from the\r\nking's friend into the king's antagonist, is the most dramatic instance\r\nof the Church's necessary tendency to fight for its own hand and to act\r\nas an independent community. And it is in large part to the check and\r\ncounter-check of a church, crown, and baronage, all jealously standing\r\non their rights as against each other, that the rise of English\r\nconstitutionalism is to be traced; the baronage and the Church, further,\r\nbeing withheld from preponderance by the strifes arising within their\r\nown pale. For even the Church, unified at once by its principle, its\r\ncelibacy, its self-interest, and the pressure of outside forces,\r\nexhibits in its own sections, from time to time, the law of strife among\r\ncompeting interests.[1003]\r\n\r\nThe mere strife of interests, however, could not evolve civilisation in\r\nsuch a polity without a constant grafting-on of actual civilising\r\nelements from that southern world in which the ancient seeds were again\r\nflowering. Mere mixing of Norman with Saxon blood, one Teutonic branch\r\nwith another, could avail nothing in itself beyond setting up a useful\r\nvariability of type; and the element of French handicraft and culture\r\nintroduced in the wake of the Conquest, though not inconsiderable,[1004]\r\ncould ill survive such a pandemonium as the reign of Stephen. Like Henry\r\nI, Stephen depended on the English element as against the baronage; but\r\nthe struggle brought civilisation lower than it had been since the\r\nConquest. With the accession of Henry II (1154) came a new influx of\r\nFrench culture and French speech,[1005] albeit without any departure\r\nfrom the monarchic policy of evoking the common people as against the\r\nnobles. Thenceforward for over a hundred years the administrative\r\nmethods and the culture are French, down to the erection of a\r\nFrench-speaking Parliament by the southern Frenchman Simon de Montfort.\r\nThe assumption that some inherent \"Teutonic\" faculty for self-government\r\nshaped the process is one of the superstitions of racial and national\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\n     Dr. C.H. Pearson's reiteration of the old \"race\" dogma (_History of\r\n     England during the Early and Middle Ages_, i, 277) is its\r\n     sufficient _reductio ad absurdum_. In the English manner, he\r\n     connects with old _Welsh_ usages of revenge the late _Irish_\r\n     tradition of \"lynch law\" that has been \"transplanted to\r\n     _America_\"--as if it were Irishmen who are to-day lynching negroes\r\n     in the southern States. He explains in the same way \"the contrast\r\n     of French progress by revolutionary movements with the slow,\r\n     constitutional, onward march of English liberty.\" On his own\r\n     showing there was not progress, but deterioration, as regards\r\n     liberty among the Saxons; and the later history of the English\r\n     common people is largely one of their efforts to make revolutions.\r\n     In France the revolutions were rather fewer. In Denmark and\r\n     Germany, again, there was long relapse and then revolution. For the\r\n     rest, Mr. Pearson has contrasted Welsh usage of the _sixth_ century\r\n     with Saxon usage of the _eleventh_, this while admitting the\r\n     lateness of the latter development (pp. 275, 276). We should\r\n     require only to go back to the blood-feud stage in Teutondom to\r\n     prove the ineradicable tendencies of the Anglo-Saxon to the\r\n     _Faustrecht_, which in Germany survived till the sixteenth century,\r\n     and to the fisticuffs which occurred in 1895 in the English\r\n     Parliament. The reasoning would be on a par with Mr. Pearson's.\r\n\r\n     Mr. J.H. Round's way of taking it for granted (_The Commune of\r\n     London_, 1899, pp. 138-40) that a tendency to strife is permanently\r\n     and \"truly Hibernian,\" belongs to the same order of thought.\r\n     Irishmen are represented as abnormal in inability to unite against\r\n     a common foe, when just such disunion was shown through whole\r\n     centuries in Saxondom and in Scandinavia and in Germany; and they\r\n     are further described as peculiar in leaving their commerce in\r\n     foreign hands, when such was the notorious practice of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n     One of the most remarkable reversions to the racial way of\r\n     reasoning is made by Mr. H.W. C. Davis in his _England under the\r\n     Normans and Angevins_ (1905). After setting out with the avowal\r\n     that the Anglo-Saxons at the Conquest were \"decadent,\" he reaches\r\n     (p. 223) the conclusion that the Teutonic races \"climb, slowly and\r\n     painfully it is true, but with a steady and continued progress,\r\n     from stage to stage of civilisation,\" while the Celtic, \"after\r\n     soaring at the first flight to a comparatively elevated point, are\r\n     inclined to be content with their achievement, and are ... passed\r\n     by their more deliberate competitors.\" How a Teutonic race, given\r\n     these premises, could be \"decadent,\" and be surpassed and finally\r\n     uplifted by a \"Latin civilisation\" (_id._ p. 2), the theorist does\r\n     not attempt to explain.\r\n\r\nTo no virtue in Norman or English character, then,[1006] but to the\r\npolitical circumstances, was it due that there grew up in island\r\nEngland, instead of an all-powerful feudal nobility and a mainly\r\ndepressed peasantry, as in continental France, a certain balance of\r\nclasses, in which the king's policy against the nobility restrained and\r\nfeudally weakened them, and favoured the burghers and yeomen, making\r\nsub-tenants king's liegemen; while on the other hand the combination of\r\nbarons and Church against the king restrained him.[1007] A tyrant king\r\nis better for the people than the tyranny of nobles; and the destruction\r\nof feudal castles by regal jealousy restrains baronial brigandage. Regal\r\nprestige counts for something as against baronial self-assertion; but\r\naristocratic self-esteem also rests itself, as against a reckless king,\r\non popular sympathy. On the other hand, the town corporations,\r\noriginating in popular interests, became in turn close oligarchies.[1008]\r\nEven the class tyranny of the trade gilds, self-regarding corporations\r\nin their way,[1009] looking to their own interests and indifferent to\r\nthose of the outside grades beneath them,[1010] could provide a foothold\r\nfor the barons in the town mobs, whom the barons could patronise.[1011]\r\nWhat was done by the Parliaments of Edward III to allow free entrance to\r\nforeign merchants was by way of furthering the interests of the\r\naristocracy, who wanted to deal with such merchants, as against the\r\nEnglish traders who wished to exclude them. Yet again, the yeomanry\r\nand burghers, fostered by the royal policy, develop an important\r\nmilitary force, which has its own prestige.\r\n\r\nNothing can hinder, however, that foreign wars shall in the end\r\naggrandise the upper as against the lower classes, developing as they do\r\nthe relation of subjection, increasing the specifically military upper\r\nclass, and setting up the spirit of force as against the spirit of law.\r\nIn particular, the king's power is always aggrandised when nobility and\r\npeople alike are led by him to foreign war.[1012] Edward III, indeed,\r\nhad to make many legislative concessions to the Commons in order to\r\nprocure supplies for his wars; and the expansion of commerce in his\r\nreign,[1013] furthered by the large influx of Flemish artisans[1014]\r\nencouraged by him,[1015] strengthened the middle classes; but all the\r\nwhile the \"lower orders\" had the worst of it; and the jealousy between\r\ntraders and artisans, already vigorous in the reign of John, could not\r\nbe extinguished. And when, after nearly eighty years without a great\r\nexternal war, Edward I invaded Scotland, there began a military epoch in\r\nwhich, while national unity was promoted, the depressed class was\r\nnecessarily enlarged, as it had been before the Conquest during the\r\nDanish wars;[1016] and the poor went to the wall. Instinct made people\r\nand baronage alike loth at first to support the king in wars of foreign\r\naggression; but when once the temper was developed throughout the\r\nnation, as against France, the spirit of national union helped the\r\ngrowth of class superiority by leaving it comparatively unchecked. In\r\nthe period between the Conquest and Edward I the free population had\r\nactually increased, partly by French and Flemish immigration in the\r\ntrain of the Conquest; partly by Norman manumissions; partly through the\r\narrivals of Flemish weavers exiled by domestic war;[1017] partly by the\r\nnew growth of towns under Norman influence; partly by reason of the\r\ndevelopment of the wool export trade, which flourished in virtue of the\r\nlaw and order at length established under the Angevin kings, and so\r\nstimulated other industry. But from the beginning of the epoch of\r\nsystematic national war the increase was checked; and save for the\r\nperiod of betterment consequent on the destruction of population by the\r\nBlack Death, the condition of the peasantry substantially\r\nworsened.[1018] Frenchmen were struck by the number of serfs they saw\r\nin southern England as compared with France, and by the stress of their\r\nservitude.[1019]\r\n\r\nAn apparently important offset to the general restriction of freedom is\r\nthe beginning of a representative parliamentary system under the\r\nauspices of Simon de Montfort (1265). It is still customary to make this\r\ndeparture a ground for national self-felicitation, though our later\r\nhistorians are as a rule content to state the historical facts, without\r\ninferring any special credit to the \"Anglo-Saxon race.\"[1020] As a\r\nmatter of fact, Simon de Montfort's Parliament was the application by a\r\nnaturalised Frenchman, under stress of the struggle between his party in\r\nthe baronage and the king, of an expedient set up a generation before by\r\nthe Emperor Frederick II in Sicily, and a century before in Spain.\r\nThere, and not in England, arose the first Parliaments in which sat\r\ntogether barons, prelates, and representatives of cities. Simon de\r\nMontfort, son of the leader of the crusade against the Albigenses, may\r\nwell have known of the practice of Spain, where in the twelfth century\r\nthe householders in the cities elected their members. But he must at\r\nleast have been familiar with the details of the system set up in\r\nSicily, to which English attention had been specially called by the\r\neffort of Henry III to obtain the Sicilian crown for his son Edmund; and\r\nSimon imitated that system in England, not on any exalted principle of\r\njustice, but because the smallness of his support among the barons\r\nforced him to make the most of the burgher class, who had stood by him\r\nin the struggle. He may even, indeed, have taken his idea proximately\r\nfrom the practice of the rebels in Normandy before the Conquest, when\r\ndeputies from all the districts met in general assembly and bound\r\nthemselves by a mutual oath.[1021] Thus accidentally[1022] introduced,\r\nunder a French name,[1023] the representative system is one more of the\r\ncivilising factors which England owed to Southern Europe; and, as it\r\nwas, baronage and burgesses alike failed to maintain Simon against the\r\npower of the crown, the monarchic superstition availing to divide even\r\nthe malcontents, as had previously happened after the granting of Magna\r\nCarta by King John.\r\n\r\n     Reiterated claims had secured in the eighteenth century the general\r\n     acceptance of the view that England \"set the example\" of admitting\r\n     cities to representation in national diets (so Koch, _Histor. View\r\n     of the European Nations_, Crichton's tr. 3rd ed. p. 46). But as to\r\n     the priority of the institution in Spain, see U.R. Burke, _History\r\n     of Spain_, Hume's ed. i, 370; and Prescott, _Hist. of the Reign of\r\n     Ferdinand and Isabella_, Kirk's ed. 1889, p. 10 and refs. As to its\r\n     existence in Sicily (_circa_ 1232), see Milman, _Hist. of Latin\r\n     Christianity_, vi, 154, proceeding on Gregorio, _Considerazioni\r\n     sopra la Storia di Sicilia_, 1805 (ed. 2a, 1831-39, vol. ii, cap.\r\n     v); and Von Raumer, _Geschichte der Hohenstaufen_ (Aufg. 1857-58,\r\n     B. vii, Haupt. 6, Bd. iii, p. 249). Cp. Von Reumont, _The Carafas\r\n     of Maddaloni_, Eng. tr. 1854, p. 61, and refs. Frederick's\r\n     assemblies, too, were called _Parlamente_. He in turn had, of\r\n     course, been influenced by the practice, if not of Spain, at least\r\n     of the Italian cities, which he wished his own to rival.\r\n\r\n     As to Simon's object in summoning burgesses, Hallam admits (_Europe\r\n     during the Middle Ages_, ed. 1855, iii, 27) that it \"was merely to\r\n     strengthen his own faction, which prevailed among the commonalty,\"\r\n     though the step was too congruous with general developments not to\r\n     be followed up. Compare the admissions of Green, pp. 151-53;\r\n     Stubbs, ii, 96, 103; and the remark of Adam Smith (_Wealth of\r\n     Nations_, bk. iii, ch. iii) that the representation of burghs in\r\n     the states-general of _all_ the great European monarchies\r\n     originated spontaneously in the desire of the kings for support\r\n     against the barons. Freeman's statement (_General Sketch of\r\n     European History_, p. 184) that under Simon we find \"the whole\r\n     English nation, nobles, clergy, and people, acting firmly together\"\r\n     against the king, is quite erroneous. Cp. Gneist, _Geschichte des\r\n     Self-government in England_, 1863, p. 143. Dr. Gardiner (_Student's\r\n     History_, p. 245), speaking of the presence of city burgesses and\r\n     knights of the shire in the same Parliament under Edward III,\r\n     writes that \"in no other country in Europe would this have been\r\n     possible.\" He seems to have been entirely unaware of the Spanish\r\n     practice.\r\n\r\nAs the roots of the temper of equality are weakened, the relative\r\nprestige of the king is heightened,[1024] provided that in a turbulent\r\nage he is strong enough for his functions; though, again, he runs new\r\nrisks when, in peace, he is weak enough to make favourites, and thus\r\nsets up a source of jealousy in the act of surrendering some of his own\r\nspecial prestige. Then he doubles the force against him. History has\r\ngenerally represented favourites as unworthy; but there is no need that\r\nthey should be so in order to be detested; and whether we take Gaveston,\r\nor Buckingham, or Bute, we shall always find that the animosity of the\r\nfavourite's assailants is so visibly excessive as to imply the\r\ninspiration of primordial envy quite as much as resentment of bad\r\ngovernment. Whether it is noble denouncing favoured noble or Pym\r\nimpeaching the Duke, there is always the note of primary animal\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nA very obvious and familiar general law, here to be noted afresh, is\r\nthat the constant and extensive employment of energy in war retards\r\ncivilisation, by leaving so much less for intellectual work. Some\r\nsociologists have arrived at the optimistic half-truths that (1) warfare\r\nyields good in the form of chivalry, and that (2) great wars like the\r\nCrusades promote civilisation by setting up communication between\r\npeoples. But it is not asked whether the good involved in chivalry could\r\nnot conceivably have been attained without the warfare, and whether (as\r\nbefore noted) there could not have been commerce between East and West\r\nwithout the Crusades.[1025] The ancient Phoenicians had contrived as\r\nmuch in their day. Even the expansion of Italian commerce which followed\r\non the Crusades went on the lines of a trade already in existence, as is\r\nproved once for all by the mere numbers of the vessels supplied to the\r\ncrusaders by the Pisans, Genoese, and Venetians;[1026] and inasmuch as\r\nthese republics fought furiously for the monopoly, each grabbing for\r\nspecial privileges,[1027] till Genoa overthrew Pisa, the total expansion\r\nmust have been small, and the political disintegration great.\r\n\r\nNor was it on the whole otherwise with the spirit of chivalry, of which\r\nGuizot[1028] gives such an attractive picture. It was with the\r\nChurch-made code of chivalrous morals as with the Church's code of\r\nChristian virtue: the ideal and practice were far asunder. As a matter\r\nof fact, the rules of chivalry were in part but the rules of\r\nprize-fighters,[1029] without which the game could not continuously be\r\nplayed; and they in no way affected the relations of the prize-fighters\r\nwith other classes, or even their moral relations with each other save\r\nin the matter of fighting. To the \"common herd\" they were not only\r\nbrutal but base,[1030] recognising no moral obligations in that\r\ndirection. So too the Crusades represent a maximum of strife yielding a\r\nminimum of intercourse, which (save for the spirit of religious hate\r\nwhich wrought the strife) could have been attained in peace in tenfold\r\ndegree by the play of the energy spent in preliminary bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, idle to speak as if the age of warfare might have been\r\ndifferent if somebody had anachronistically pointed out the\r\npossibilities; but it is worse than idle, on the other hand, to impute a\r\nlaudable virtue to its impulses because other impulses followed on them.\r\nThe task of the sociological historian is first to trace sequences, and\r\nthen to reason from them to the problems of his own age, where most are\r\npraise and blame profitable exercises. The lesson of early English\r\nhistory is neither that chivalry is good nor that the feudal knights and\r\nkings were ruffians; but that certain things happened to retard\r\ncivilisation because these had their way, and that similar results would\r\ntend to accrue if their ideals got uppermost among us now. Thus we have\r\nto note that during the long period of frequent dynastic and other civil\r\nwar from the Conquest to the reign of Henry II there was almost no\r\nintellectual advance in England, the only traceable gain arising when\r\nthe king was fighting abroad with his foreign forces. There was no such\r\ncause at stake as thrilled into fierce song the desperately battling\r\nWelsh; and though in the reign of Edward III we have the great poetic\r\nflorescence of which Chaucer is the crown, the inspiration of that\r\nliterature had come from or through France; and with the depression of\r\nFrance there came the Nemesis of depression in English culture.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Edward over France was, broadly speaking, a result of\r\nfinancial rascality, inasmuch as he succeeded by means of the money\r\nwhich he had borrowed from the Florentine bankers, and which he never\r\nrepaid.[1031] He was thus well equipped and financed when the French\r\nwere not; and he was able to buy off the princes of the Empire on the\r\nnorth and east of the French frontier. But though the enterprise thus\r\nbegun was continued by means of a home revenue raised mainly on the wool\r\ntrade, the English attempt to dominate France ended in the inevitable\r\nway of imperialism, the humiliation of the victors duly following on the\r\nmisery and humiliation of the vanquished. Only the depopulation of the\r\nBlack Death prevented extreme misery among the English population; and\r\nthe conquering king ends his life, as William had done before him, in\r\nisolation and ignominy.\r\n\r\nIt may or may not have been a gain that Edward's victories over France\r\npractically determined the adoption of the middle-class, gallicised\r\nEnglish speech[1032] by the upper classes, who had hitherto been\r\nFrench-speaking, like the kings themselves. An Anglicising process, such\r\nas had been interrupted at the advent of Henry II, had set in when Normandy\r\nwas lost (1204), to be again interrupted on the accession of Henry III, and\r\nresumed in the civil wars of his reign. But Edward I habitually spoke\r\nFrench, and so did his nobles. They had hitherto looked with true\r\naristocratic scorn on the pretensions of the bourgeoisie--\"_rustici\r\nLondonienses qui se barones vocant ad nauseam_,\" in the fashion satirised\r\nin all ages, down to our own; but in their new relation of hostility and\r\nsuperiority to Normandy and to France, they insensibly adopted the\r\nlanguage that had been framed by that very bourgeoisie out of Saxon,\r\nand French and French idioms translated into Saxon.\r\n\r\n     Cp. Pearson, _Fourteenth Century_, pp. 222, 233. Prof. Earle's\r\n     quasi-theory of the cause of the recovery of the native tongue\r\n     (_Philology of the English Tongue_, 3rd ed. pp. 44, 66) is purely\r\n     fanciful. In the end, as he admits, it was not any native dialect,\r\n     but the artificial composite \"King's English,\" much modified by\r\n     French, that survived. It is noteworthy that many locutions which\r\n     pass in the Bible for specially pure archaic English, as \"fourscore\r\n     and ten,\" are simply translations of a French idiom, itself ancient\r\n     Celtic translated into Romance. (Cp. the _Introduction to the Study\r\n     of the History of Language_, by Strong, Logeman, and Wheeler, 1891,\r\n     p. 393.)\r\n\r\n     The Rev. W. Denton, in his learned and instructive survey of the\r\n     subject (_England in the Fifteenth Century_, 1888, pp. 1-7),\r\n     remarks that \"from some cause, now difficult to trace, great\r\n     encouragement was given to French in the reign of Henry III.\r\n     Probably the foreign tastes and partialities of the king had\r\n     something to do with this\" (p. 4). They certainly had. As soon as\r\n     he could wield power, \"hordes of hungry Poitevins and Bretons were\r\n     at once summoned over to occupy the royal castles and fill the\r\n     judicial and administrative posts about the Court\" (Green, _Short\r\n     Hist_., ch. iii, Sec. 5, p. 140), as had happened before under Henry\r\n     II. Mr. Denton rightly notes (p. 6) how \"in the reign of Henry III\r\n     the descendants of Norman barons, and the sons of Anglo-Norman\r\n     fathers, were proud of the name of Englishmen, and took up arms\r\n     against the king's Norman and Angevin favourites, whom they\r\n     despised as foreigners.\" This is the true line of causation. There\r\n     is doubtless something in the theory that the general resort to the\r\n     use of English in the schools was a result of the Black Death--the\r\n     majority of the clergy being destroyed and the new teachers being\r\n     unable to instruct in French (Gasquet, _The Great Pestilence_,\r\n     1893, p. 202); but there were certainly other causes involved. Mr.\r\n     de Montmorency (_State Intervention in English Education_, 1902,\r\n     pp. 19-23) develops Gasquet's argument with much force, noting\r\n     further that many of the foreign priests who survived forsook their\r\n     charges. It might be added that the native peasantry necessarily\r\n     counted for more in a social as in an economic sense, after the\r\n     great fall in their numbers. But the fact that the Death came in\r\n     the period of the successful French wars of Edward III is clearly\r\n     of capital importance. But for the moral reaction from these wars,\r\n     the tendency would have been to procure new relays of French\r\n     priests.\r\n\r\n     It is indeed conceivable that, but for hostilities with France,\r\n     French would have steadily gained ground through literature,\r\n     depressing and discrediting the vernacular. On this view it was the\r\n     continuance of resistance by the Welsh that probably prevented the\r\n     absorption of the Saxon speech by that of the conquered British;\r\n     and it is similarly arguable that it was the relation of hostility\r\n     between the Carlovingian Franks and the more easterly Germans that\r\n     determined the supremacy of the Romance speech in French. The point\r\n     is worth psychological investigation.\r\n\r\nThough, however, Chaucer's own new-English work is part of the result,\r\nthe intellectual gain stops there for the time being. No nation, from\r\nRome to Napoleonic France, ever helped its own higher culture by\r\ndestroying other States.[1033] The French wars of Henry V were not less\r\ninjurious to English civilisation[1034] than the desperate civil wars\r\nwhich followed them, when English medieval culture reached, relatively\r\nto the rest of Europe, its lowest point.[1035] And these wars, it is\r\nalways important to remember, were the result of the young king's acting\r\non the doctrine (doubtfully ascribed to his father, but in any case all\r\ntoo easily acquired by kings) that whereas peace gave headway to\r\ndomestic sedition, foreign war unified the mass of the people and fixed\r\nthem to their leader. The shameless aggression on France did so unify\r\nthem for the moment, as imperialism among an unmoralised public may\r\nalways be trusted to do; and it left them more demoralised and divided\r\nthan ever, in due sequence. In all likelihood it was the new bribe of\r\nforeign plunder that first drew men away from Lollardism, considered as\r\nan outcome of economic discontent, thus preparing the collapse of the\r\nmovement on its moral side.[1036] One man's egoism could thus sway the\r\nwhole nation's evolution for evil,[1037] setting up for it the ideal\r\nwhich haloed him, and which survived him in virtue of the accident that\r\nthe Nemesis of his course fell upon his successors rather than on him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nIn the matter of plebeian subjection, the second half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury supplies the proof of the tendency of the period of war. The\r\ngreat gain to the serfs in that period was the result of the\r\ndepopulation caused by the Black Death (1348-50)--a relation of cause\r\nand effect which is still ignored by some writers, in their concern to\r\ninsist that English labour was once better off than at present. But it\r\nwas later in the same half-century that the rising of the \"Jacquerie,\"\r\nwhich appears to have been in its origin strictly a revolt against\r\ntaxation,[1038] was so bloodily repressed. The manner of the revolt\r\nsufficiently proves that the peasantry had gained new heart with the\r\nimprovement in their lot which followed on the pestilence, in spite of\r\nlaws to keep down wages;[1039] but even this improvement could not\r\nstrengthen them sufficiently to make them hold their own politically in\r\n1381 against the aristocracy, gentry, and middle class, now hardened in\r\nclass insolence. It would seem as if those who rose to the status of\r\ntenants[1040] after the depopulation sought in their turn to keep down\r\nthose who remained landless servitors. After the southern and eastern\r\nrisings had been crushed, the men of Essex were told by Richard, who had\r\ngiven them charters of freedom and immediately afterwards revoked them,\r\ninclined as he was to protect the serfs in a measure against their\r\nmasters, that \"bondsmen they had been and bondsmen they should remain,\r\nin worse bondage than before\"; and the following Parliament declared\r\nthat the landowners would never consent to the freeing of the serfs,\r\n\"were they all to die for it in a day.\" It is noteworthy, on the side of\r\neconomics, that despite this temper serfage did gradually die out, the\r\npeople being for long unable to multiply up to the old level, by reason\r\nof restraint, ill-usage, civil war, the decline of tillage and the\r\ngrouping of holdings, and the high death-rate. Jack Cade's rebellion, in\r\n1450, indicated the persistence of the democratic spirit, contending as\r\nit did for the suppression of the system under which the nobles\r\nplundered the kingdom while the king was imbecile.\r\n\r\n     The question as to the rate at which the population recovered from\r\n     the Black Death has been discussed by Prof. Thorold Rogers, Mr.\r\n     Seebohm, and Prof. Cunningham (see the latter's _Growth of English\r\n     Industry and Commerce_, 1891, i, 304). Prof. Rogers, on the one\r\n     hand, maintains that by 1377, when the tax rolls seem to give a\r\n     population of about two and a half millions (cp. Dunton, _England\r\n     in the Fifteenth Century_, p. 130), the population had recovered\r\n     all it had lost in the Plague, he being of opinion that the England\r\n     of that age could not at any time support more than two and a half\r\n     millions. Mr. Seebohm, with whom Dr. Cunningham substantially\r\n     concurs (see also Pearson, _Fourteenth Century_, p. 249, and\r\n     Gasquet, _The Great Pestilence_, 1893, p. 194), thinks that the\r\n     return of the Plague in 1361 and 1369, and the unsettled state of\r\n     the country, must have prevented recuperation; and, accepting the\r\n     loose calculation that the Plague destroyed half the population\r\n     (Mr. Pearson says \"one-half or two-thirds\"; Dr. Gasquet endorses\r\n     the general view that \"fully one half\" were destroyed), he\r\n     concludes that the population before 1348 may have been five\r\n     millions.\r\n\r\n     The truth surely lies between these extremes. That the population\r\n     should not at all have recovered in twenty-five years is extremely\r\n     unlikely. That it should have restored a loss of thirty-three per\r\n     cent in twenty-five years, which is what Prof. Rogers's position\r\n     amounts to, is still more unlikely (see his _Six Centuries of Work\r\n     and Wages_, pp. 223, 226, where the mortality is estimated at\r\n     one-third). It is besides utterly incongruous with Prof. Rogers's\r\n     own repeated assertion that \"during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\n     sixteenth centuries the population of England and Wales was almost\r\n     stationary\" (_Industrial and Commercial History of England_, pp.\r\n     46, 49; _Six Centuries of Work and Wages_, p. 337; _Economic\r\n     Interpretation of History_, p. 53). How could a medieval population\r\n     conceivably stand for half a century at a given figure, then,\r\n     having been reduced by one-third, replace the loss in twenty-five\r\n     years, and thereafter continue to subsist without further increase\r\n     for two centuries more?\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, there is a natural tendency in every suddenly\r\n     depleted population to reproduce itself for a time at a quickened\r\n     rate; and in the England of the latter half of the fourteenth\r\n     century the conditions would encourage such an effort. The lack of\r\n     house-room and settlement which normally checked increase (cp.\r\n     Stubbs, Sec. 493) was remedied for a large number of persons; and the\r\n     general feeling would be all in favour of marriage and repopulation\r\n     (cp. Rogers, _Six Centuries_, p. 226, where, however, evidence\r\n     obviously bad is accepted as to multiplied births), though just\r\n     after the Plague there would be a great stimulus to the extension\r\n     of pasture, since that needed fewer hands than tillage.\r\n\r\n     On the whole, we may reasonably surmise that the population before\r\n     1348 was, not five millions, but between three and four millions\r\n     (so Green, ch. v, Sec. 4, p. 241, who, however, takes the somewhat\r\n     excessive view that \"more than one-half were swept away,\" and\r\n     further, p. 239, that the population \"seems to have all but tripled\r\n     since the Conquest\"), and that it was prevented regaining that\r\n     figure in the next century by the economic preference of\r\n     sheep-farming to tillage. Mr. Rogers expressly admits (_Six\r\n     Centuries_, p. 233) that \"the price of labour, proclamations and\r\n     statutes notwithstanding, did not ever fall to its old rates,\" and\r\n     repeatedly asserts that \"the labourers remained masters of the\r\n     situation.\" On his own principles, this goes to prove that their\r\n     numbers remained lower than of old. He infers a \"considerable loss\r\n     of life\" in the famine of 1315-16 from the immediate rise of\r\n     agricultural wages (from 23 to 30 per cent), of which on the\r\n     average 20 per cent was permanent. Here there is a presumption that\r\n     even before 1315 the population was greater than afterwards. Yet\r\n     again he states (p. 326, etc.) that \"the _fifteenth_ century and\r\n     the first quarter of the _sixteenth_ were the golden age of the\r\n     English labourer\"--a proposition which staggers credence. Cp. W.J.\r\n     Corbett, in _Social England_, ii, 382-84.\r\n\r\n     It is impossible, however, to attain demonstration either on that\r\n     head or as regards the numbers of the population in the periods\r\n     under notice. Mr. Rogers's claims to give decisive evidence show a\r\n     serious misconception of what constitutes proof; and there is\r\n     special reason to distrust his conclusion that population was no\r\n     greater at the end of Elizabeth's reign than in that of Henry IV.\r\n     Cp. Mr. Gibbins's _Industrial History of England_, pp. 107-108.\r\n     Prof. J.E. Symes (in _Social England_, iii, 128, 129) decides that\r\n     a \"great increase of the population undoubtedly took place in the\r\n     reign of Henry VIII,\" adopting the estimate that the total at the\r\n     death of Henry VII was about two and a half millions, and at the\r\n     death of Henry VIII about four millions. As to the population at\r\n     the Conquest, see Sharon Turner's _History of the Anglo-Saxons_,\r\n     bk. viii, c. 9, vol. iii, and Dunton, as cited, pp. 128-29. It was\r\n     then probably below two millions; and in the reign of Edward II it\r\n     may well have been over three millions; for Bishop Pecock about\r\n     1450 (cited by Dunton, p. 130 _note_) speaks of a long-continued\r\n     decrease, such as would be caused by the wars in France and at\r\n     home. But the assertion of Tyndale in 1532 (_id._ _ib._), that the\r\n     population was then less by a third than in the time of Richard II,\r\n     must be dismissed as a delusion set up by the phenomena of agrarian\r\n     depopulation in certain districts. On this see below, p. 405.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note, finally, that it was in the age of raised\r\nstandard of comfort that there occurred the first wide diffusion of\r\ncritical heresy in England. Wiclif's popular Lollardry was one phase of\r\na movement that went deeper in thought and further afield in social\r\nreform than his, since he himself felt driven to confute certain\r\nopponents of belief in the Scriptures, and at the same time to repudiate\r\nthe doctrine that vassals might resist tyrant lords.[1041] Had he not\r\ndone so, he might have had a less peaceful end; but it is clear that\r\nmany men were in the temper to apply to lay matters the demand for\r\nreform which he restricted to matters ecclesiastical.[1042] John Ball's\r\nrising, however, promptly elicited the much superior strength of the\r\nfeudal military class; and though in 1395 there were still Lollards to\r\npetition to Parliament for the abolition of \"unnecessary trades,\" as\r\nwell as war and capital punishment and the Catholic practices afterwards\r\nrejected by Protestantism, their Utopia was as hopeless as that of the\r\ninsurgent peasants. Even had the invasion of France not come about to\r\nbribe and demoralise the nation at large, turning it from domestic\r\ncriticism to the plunder of a neighbouring State, the nobility of the\r\nperiod were utterly incapable of an intellectual ideal; and any sympathy\r\nshown by any section of them for Lollardry was the merest opportunism,\r\nproceeding on resentment of Papal exactions or on a premature hope of\r\nplundering the Church.[1043] The moment Lollardry openly leant towards\r\ncriticism of nobility as well as clergy, they were ready to give it up\r\nto destruction; and the determining cause of the fall of Richard II was\r\nthat, besides alienating the nobles at once by maintaining a peace\r\npolicy, and by refusing to let them go to all lengths in oppressing the\r\nlabourers, he alienated the clergy by sheltering the Lollards.[1044] It\r\nwas the clergy who turned the balance, embracing the cause of Henry IV,\r\nwho in turn systematically supported them,[1045] as did his son after\r\nhim. Henry V, the national hero-king, and his father were the first\r\nburners of \"Protestant\" heretics; and it was under Henry IV, in 1401,\r\nthat there was passed the Act suppressing the voluntary schools of the\r\nLollards.[1046] Doubtless it was a push of the Lollards that carried the\r\nlater Act of 1406, permitting all men and women to send their sons and\r\ndaughters \"to any school that pleaseth them in the realm;\"[1047] but the\r\nlimitation of school-keeping to the Church was an effective means of\r\nlimiting the education given; and \"by 1430 the Church had recovered from\r\nthe Lollard revolt against her universal authority.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lecky, in his theory of the English aristocracy, credits the\r\n     nobility with an \"eminently popular character\" from time\r\n     immemorial, and cites Comines as to \"the singular humanity of the\r\n     nobles to the people during the civil wars\" (_History of England in\r\n     the Eighteenth Century_, small ed. i, 212, 213). The nobility, in\r\n     the circumstances, had need to treat the people better than those\r\n     of France normally did (which was what Comines was thinking of).\r\n     Their own wealth--what was left of it--came from the people, to\r\n     whom, further, they looked for followers. And Comines in the same\r\n     passage (bk. v, ch. xx) notes that the English people were \"more\r\n     than ordinarily jealous\" of their nobility. Of course, the\r\n     difference between French and English practice dates further back,\r\n     as above noted.\r\n\r\n     Similarly misleading is Mr. Lecky's statement that \"the Great\r\n     Charter had been won by the barons, but ... it guaranteed the\r\n     rights of all freemen.\" Mr. Gardiner expressly points out\r\n     (_Student's History_, p. 182; cp. his _Introduction to English\r\n     History_, pp. 66-67) that the Charter \"was won by a combination\r\n     between all classes of freemen.\" London had harboured and aided the\r\n     barons' force; and the clergy were closely concerned. (Cp.\r\n     McKechnie, _Magna Carta_, 1905, p. 41.) The representative\r\n     assembly summoned by John in 1213 stood for the combination of the\r\n     three classes. Green (_Short History_, illust. ed. i, 242, 243)\r\n     uses language which countenances Mr. Lecky, but shows (pp. 235-43)\r\n     the need the barons felt for aid, and the influence of the Church\r\n     and the traders. Compare the language of his longer history (1885,\r\n     i, 244), and his express admission as to the depression the\r\n     baronage had undergone a century later (_id._ p. 300). Dr. Stubbs\r\n     (_Const. Hist._ i, 571, 583) also indicates that the people\r\n     co-operated, though he uses expressions (pp. 570, 579) which\r\n     obscure the facts in Mr. Lecky's favour. Guizot (_Essais_, p. 282)\r\n     recognises that the movement was national. Buckle, too, made the\r\n     point clear long ago (3-vol. ed. ii, 114-20; 1-vol. ed. pp.\r\n     350-54). But it is noted even in what he called \"the wretched work\r\n     of Delolme,\" and was in Buckle's day a generally accepted truth.\r\n     Cp. Ch. de Remusat, _L'Angleterre du 18ieme siecle_, 1856, i, 33.\r\n\r\n     It is worth noting in this connection that the Magna Carta,\r\n     considered in itself, is a rather deceptive historical document.\r\n     Not only did it need the defeat of John and his German and Flemish\r\n     allies by the French at Bouvines to enable even the combined lords\r\n     and commons and clergy to extort the Charter, but the combination\r\n     was being progressively destroyed by John, by means of his army of\r\n     French mercenaries, when the barons in despair persuaded the French\r\n     king to send an invading force, which was able to land owing to the\r\n     ruin of John's fleet in a storm. Thereupon John's French troops\r\n     deserted him. Cp. Green, pp. 122-26; Stubbs, ii, 3, 9-16; and\r\n     McKechnie, pp. 53-57, as to the King's energy and the weakness and\r\n     inner divisions of the national combination. Thus it was indirectly\r\n     to French action that England owed first the Magna Carta and then\r\n     the check upon the King's vengeance, as it was to the Frenchman,\r\n     Simon de Montfort, later, that it owed the initiative of a\r\n     three-class Parliament. And, indeed, but for the King's death, the\r\n     constitutional cause might well have collapsed in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nThe Wars of the Roses, by destroying in large part the nobility,\r\nrelatively advantaged the middle class,[1048] as well as the king whose\r\nreign followed. Already under Edward IV the powers of Parliament were\r\nmuch curtailed, and indeed paralysed;[1049] this, which is charged as a\r\nsin upon the monarch, being the natural result of his gain of power on\r\nthe ruin of the baronage. Edward IV only did what Edward I and III would\r\nhave done if in their situation it had been possible, and what Edward II\r\nand Richard II sought to do, but were too weak to compass. The fourth\r\nEdward's situation and his force of will together made his power. Not\r\nonly was the nobility half exterminated, but the trading and middle\r\nclasses alike desired a strong ruler who should maintain order, by\r\nwhatever straining of constitutional forms--the invariable sequel of\r\nanarchy--at least up to the point of intolerable taxation.[1050] The\r\nactual increase of commerce during the wars[1051] is a good proof of the\r\nseparateness of class interests, and of the decline of the military\r\nideal. Much of it would seem to have been due to the example set by the\r\nHansa merchants, who had factories at London,[1052] Boston, and Lynn,\r\nand whose famous League was then powerful enough to force from Edward IV\r\na renewal of its English privileges in return for a concession of a\r\nshare in the Baltic trade.[1053] In any case, the new development was on\r\nthe old lines of energetic self-seeking; and already in the reign of\r\nEdward IV the cloth manufacture was carried on by capitalists in the\r\nmodern spirit.[1054] And as the tyrannies of the king were less general\r\nand oppressive than the tyrannies of the nobles, the erection of the\r\nregal power on the collapse of the old class cohesion gave a new scope\r\nfor the strife of classes among and for themselves. No national ideal\r\nexisted (as apart from the readiness to unite in hate of a foreign\r\nnation) in monarchic England any more than in old republican Greece or\r\nmodern republican Italy. The trade gilds were strictly self-seeking\r\ninstitutions, aiming at keeping down the number of competitors in each\r\ntrade, without providing in any way for the aspirants. Unitary egoism\r\nwas the universal mainspring. The Church sought above all things to be\r\nprotected against heresy; the town and trade corporations sought\r\nprotection for their privileges; and the landowners sought to be\r\nsupported against the labourers, who from the time of Henry VI are found\r\nrevolting against enclosures of public land, and were temporarily\r\nreinforced by the disbanded retainers of the barons. Every modern force\r\nof social disintegration was already nascent.\r\n\r\n     Cp. Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, i,\r\n     395-96, 413, 425; Stubbs, _Constitutional History_, Sec.Sec. 486-92 (iii,\r\n     586-616). \"In every great town there was, every few years,\r\n     something of a struggle, something of a crisis ... between trade\r\n     and craft, or craft and craft, or magistracy and commons\" (Stubbs,\r\n     iii, 616). Prof. Ashley (_Introd. to Econ. Hist._ i, 79) disputes\r\n     that there was \"any such contest in this country between burghers\r\n     and artisans\" as took place on the continent; and cites another\r\n     passage from Bishop Stubbs (Sec. 131; i, 453) partly suggesting such a\r\n     view. But Prof. Ashley goes on (pp. 79-84) to show that there _was_\r\n     a good deal of struggling even in England between burghers and\r\n     artisans. Cp. his conclusions, pp. 6-10, 42, as to the process of\r\n     evolution towards at least formal unity. It is to be noted that the\r\n     gilds dispensed charity (Stubbs, iii, 616, 619).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nUnder Henry VII the same conditions subsisted. There was no sufficiently\r\nstrong body of aristocracy left to rebel effectually against his\r\nexactions, though exactions had always been the great cause of\r\ndiscontent; and, all rivals collapsing, there grew up round the new\r\ndynasty that hedging superstition which had always counted for much, and\r\nwhich was in England to become a main factor in politics. Henry VII\r\nwrought assiduously and astutely to build up his power, seeking no less\r\nto increase the merchant class than to depress the aristocracy. From\r\nboth he thus drew his revenue; from the latter by exaction; from the\r\nformer by customs duties on the trade he carefully encouraged (as\r\nRichard had done before him), finding in such revenue his surest\r\nincome.[1055] Gradually the monarchic system was made firm. Richard III\r\nowed his failure mainly to the sense of the illegality of his position;\r\nand the same inversion of the superstition troubled Henry VII in turn,\r\nas it had done Henry IV. It seems to have been his possession of the one\r\ntrain of artillery in the kingdom that mainly preserved his power\r\nagainst rebels.[1056] But with Henry VIII the dynasty was secure; and\r\nfrom this point onward the monarchic spell can be seen very clearly in\r\nEnglish affairs. The instinct of \"loyalty,\" a moral prepossession\r\nreligiously sanctioned, becomes a social force as truly as the simpler\r\ninstincts of self-seeking and class spirit. By virtue of it, and of his\r\nown force of brute will, Henry VIII could commit violences of almost\r\nevery description, his own personality having some of the\r\ncharacteristics most likely to intensify the spell. Energy such as his\r\nhypnotised or terrorised all but the strongest. Even his crimes were not\r\nsuch as revolted average sympathy: the suppression of the Church, as in\r\nnearly all the \"Teutonic\" countries, was a direct bribe to many of the\r\nnobles and landowners,[1057] and for the multitude meant the overthrow\r\nof an alien jurisdiction; and his domestic procedure satisfied the\r\npopular ethic which demurs to mistresses but respects bigamy, and finds\r\na wife's adultery more criminal than her husband's murder of her. For\r\nthe rest, he had at the beginning of his reign executed his father's\r\nminions, and conciliated the scholars, who made opinion. Yet under Henry\r\nVIII we find middle-class England, heavily taxed for war, beginning to\r\nstand on its rights as upper-class England had done in earlier times;\r\nand in the new England as in the old the weakest class went to the wall.\r\nThe ever-increasing mass of poor, thrown idle and hungry by the\r\ncontinuous rise of sheep-farms in the place of tillage, were the natural\r\nenemies of the governing class as well as of the landowners; and in\r\ncruelly repressing them the monarchy strengthened the landowners'\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nThus arose the typical personal monarchy, employing middle-class\r\nministers, who served it zealously and with increasing power, Thomas\r\nCromwell far outgoing Wolsey. The passing coalition of nobles and yeomen\r\nin the north in the cause of the old religion was followed by the\r\ncrushing of the remains of the old nobility, now being rapidly replaced\r\nby the new, established on the plunder of the Church. It is to be noted\r\nthat in England, as in so many other countries, the virtual subjection\r\nof the old nobility to the crown was for a time followed by stirrings of\r\nnew life in all directions, as if feudalism had everywhere meant a\r\nrepression of possible energy. The process is seen in Spain under\r\nFerdinand and Isabella;[1058] in France under Richelieu and Mazarin; in\r\nSweden under Gustavus Vasa; and is thus plainly a product not of\r\ndoctrinal Protestantism, as some suppose, but of the comparative social\r\nand political liberty that follows on the restriction of ubiquitous\r\nfeudal tyranny, so much more searching and pervasive a force than the\r\nsimpler tyranny of the feudal king. It may be doubted, indeed, whether\r\nthe Tudor suppression of the power of the old aristocracy was not as\r\nvital a determination of the nation's course as the overthrow of the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\n     As against Mr. Lecky's indiscriminate panegyric of the English\r\n     nobility, it is instructive to note Hallam's judgment on the\r\n     peerage under Henry VIII: \"They yielded to every mandate of his\r\n     imperious will ... they are responsible for the illegal trial, for\r\n     the iniquitous attainder, for the sanguinary statute, for the\r\n     tyranny which they sanctioned by law, and for that which they\r\n     permitted to subsist without law. Nor was this selfish and\r\n     pusillanimous subserviency more characteristic of the minions of\r\n     Henry's favour than of the representatives of ancient and\r\n     honourable houses, the Norfolks, the Arundels, and the Shrewsburys.\r\n     We trace the noble statesmen of these reigns concurring in all the\r\n     inconsistencies of the revolutions; supporting all the religions of\r\n     Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth; adjudging the death of Somerset\r\n     to gratify Northumberland, and of Northumberland to redeem their\r\n     participation in his fault; setting up the usurpation of Lady Jane,\r\n     and abandoning her on the first doubt of success, constant only in\r\n     the rapacious acquisition of estates and honours from whatever\r\n     source, and in adherence to the present power\" (_Constitutional\r\n     History_, 10th ed. i, 48).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6\r\n\r\nAnd now effectively arose the new political force of Protestant and\r\nBible-worshipping fanaticism, turning the democratic instinct into its\r\nchannel, and complicating afresh the old issues of classes. It is not to\r\nbe forgotten that this was a beginning of popular culture, inasmuch as\r\nthe desire to read the worshipped book must have counted for more than\r\nanything else in making reading common.[1059]\r\n\r\nPractically, however, the opposed causes of Lollardism and orthodoxy may\r\nat the outset be regarded as the democratic and the conservative\r\ninstincts, taking these channels in the absence of political development\r\nand knowledge.[1060] In imperial Rome, the spread of Christianity was\r\nsubstantially a movement of class cohesion among the illiterate slaves,\r\naliens, and workers, the instinct of attraction taking this form when\r\npolitical grounds of union were lacking. So it was in the England of the\r\nperiod under notice; but whereas in imperial Rome the autocracy went far\r\nto annul class distinctions, and so helped the slaves' cult to absorb\r\nsuperstitious patricians, especially women, whose wealth maintained the\r\npoor of the Church as the emperor's doles had maintained the poor of the\r\nState, in England the vigour of class distinctions fostered differences\r\nof sect. The phenomena of political Protestantism in the Reformation era\r\nin England, as in Germany, offer many parallels to those of the French\r\nRevolution. The revolt of many priests from the routine and restrictions\r\nof their office is notable in both epochs. On the other hand, the mass\r\nof the well-to-do classes, being unprepared for change by any educative\r\nprocess, were as ready to restore Catholic usages as were those of\r\nFrance later; and when the innovating forces, consisting in a little\r\nreasoning and much rapine, had run to seed and to corruption under the\r\nProtectorate and Edward VI, the reaction towards the old forms set in\r\npowerfully. Nothing, however, could carry it to the length of restoring\r\nthe Catholic Church's property; and the failure of Mary was due not\r\nnearly so much to Protestant dislike of the ceremonial of Rome as to the\r\ngrip of the new owners on the confiscated lands. In England as in\r\nScotland, in Germany, in the Scandinavian States, and in Switzerland,\r\nthough Henry stood for a special initiative, the driving forces of the\r\nReformation were mainly those of wealth-seeking; and the financial\r\nrecords of the Protectorate show a conspiracy of plunder to which the\r\nannals of monarchy could offer no parallel. The Protestant aristocracy\r\nsimply encouraged the new Lollardism by way of gaining their personal\r\nends, as they had crushed the old because it menaced their property.\r\n\r\n     \"Crown lands to the value of five millions of our modern money had\r\n     been granted away to the friends of Somerset and Warwick. The royal\r\n     expenditure had mounted in seventy years to more than four times\r\n     its previous total\" (Green, ch. vii, Sec. 1, and p. 353). A system of\r\n     wholesale corruption and waste had grown up under Henry VIII, who,\r\n     after all his confiscations, was fain to seek funds by adulterating\r\n     his coin. So Edward VI, the church and college plunder being gone,\r\n     had to be granted taxes on manufactures which tended to stop them.\r\n     \"Yet I cannot find,\" says Sir Roger Twysden, \"all this made the\r\n     crown rich. Hayward observes Edward's debts were L251,000--at least\r\n     said to be so. Camden, that Queen Elizabeth received the crown\r\n     _afflictissima_ ... _aere alieno quod Henricus VIII et Edwardus VI\r\n     contraxerant oppressa_.... I cannot but reckon the treasure spent\r\n     in fifteen years, more than half the kingdom to be sold\"\r\n     (_Historical Vindication of the Church of England_, ed. 1847, pp.\r\n     4, 5). So obviously had the treasure gone into the pockets of\r\n     courtiers and their hangers-on, that the fact gives some excuse for\r\n     the habitual miserliness of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nA new channel had thus been made for the forces of union and strife. An\r\ninstructive part of the process was the movement towards a new\r\nsacerdotalism on the side of the new Calvinistic clergy--a movement much\r\nmore clearly visible in Scotland than in England. Whether or not it be\r\ntrue that \"it was by no means the intention of Knox and his\r\nfellow-labourers to erect a new hierarchy upon the ruins of the\r\nold,\"[1061] it is clear that his immediate successors counted on\r\nwielding a power strictly analogous to that of the papacy. Andrew\r\nMelville, in haughty colloquy with King James and his councillors, threw\r\ndown his Hebrew Bible on the table as his authority for his demands.\r\nSince all alike professed to accept it, the next step in the argument\r\nplainly was that it lay with the presbyter to interpret the sacred\r\nbook;[1062] and Melville, who took the king by the sleeve and called him\r\n\"God's silly [= weak] vassal,\" was quite ready to play Gregory to\r\nJames's Henry had he been able. The effective check lay in the new\r\nChurch's lack of revenue, the lands of the old Church having of course\r\nbeen retained by the nobles, who carried through the Reformation simply\r\nin order to get them. But even in its poverty, with an indifferent\r\nnobility[1063] in possession of the feudal power, the Scottish clergy\r\nwere nearly as tyrannous socially as their teacher Calvin had been at\r\nGeneva; and for nearly two hundred years Scottish life was no freer and\r\nmuch more joyless, under the new presbyter, than under the old priest,\r\nthough the democratic machinery of the Kirk obviated any need or\r\nopportunity for fiscal exaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 7\r\n\r\nAs it is with the Reformation period that the play of sheer opinion\r\nbegins to appear distinctly in English politics, so it is in this period\r\nthat the phenomena of reactions first begin to be in a manner traceable\r\nas distinct from military fluctuations. All faction, of course, is a\r\nform of the play of opinion; but after the fading away of feudalism the\r\nopinion is more easily to be contemplated as a force in itself,\r\nalongside of the simpler instincts; and the ebbing and flowing of causes\r\nsuggests a certain consequence of action and reaction in human affairs.\r\nThe gain-getting Protestant movement under the Protectorate was followed\r\nby the Catholic reaction under Mary; which again bred reaction by\r\nferocity. Catholics grew cold in their allegiance when Romanism yielded\r\nsuch bloody fruits. Protestantism, besides, flourished on the continual\r\npoverty of the lower orders, and on the abeyance of international\r\nstrife--conditions which necessarily set up new movements of combination\r\nand repulsion; and when Elizabeth succeeded to the throne, she served to\r\nrepresent, however incongruously, the religious leanings of the\r\ndemocracy, as well as to unite them in the name of patriotism against\r\nRome and Spain. She, again, profited by the monarchic superstition,\r\nwhile she was menaced by its inversion; and it is to be observed that as\r\na woman she gained immunity with her subjects for flaws of character\r\nwhich in a man would have been odious and despicable, where her rival,\r\nMary of Scotland, suffered deposition for actions of a kind which in a\r\nman would have been almost spontaneously forgiven. Mary's complicity in\r\nthe assassination of a base and unfaithful husband was an unpardonable\r\ncrime from the reigning ethical point of view, which was purely\r\nmasculine; and the same ethic held in amused toleration the constant bad\r\nfaith and personal absurdity of Elizabeth,[1064] which rather flattered\r\nthan endangered the pride of sex. Thus could monarchic politics be\r\nswayed by the prevailing psychology of a period, as well as by its class\r\npreponderances and interests. The personality of the monarch always\r\ncounted for much in the determination of his power.\r\n\r\nWhere Elizabeth gained, however, James lost. Her power was consolidated\r\nby the triumph over the Armada, which in the old fashion fused religious\r\nstrifes in a common warlike exultation, and definitely made England\r\nProtestant by setting her in deadly enmity towards the great Catholic\r\npower;[1065] just as the state of aggressive hostility towards France\r\nunder Edward I and Edward III drew Englishmen of all classes into the\r\nhabit of speaking English and discarding the hitherto common use of\r\nFrench. At the same time the Queen's collisions with Parliament and\r\npeople were always the less dangerous because she was a woman, and so\r\ncould yield without indignity where a man would have been humiliated and\r\ndiscredited--an advantage overlooked by the historians who praise her\r\nsagacity. Such as it was, it was in large part the sagacity of\r\nunscrupulousness; and her success is much more the measure of popular\r\ninfatuation than of her wisdom. All the while, she had wiser councillors\r\nthan almost any English monarch before or since; and much of her\r\nsagacity was theirs, perhaps even down to some of the unscrupulousness;\r\nthough on the other hand her fickleness often put them in an evil\r\naspect. Burghley might say what he would, in the loyalist manner, about\r\nher inspired judgment; but he knew that she imposed Leicester on the\r\nDutch expedition against his advice, then starved her troops, then upset\r\neverything because of the easily predictable disobedience of Leicester\r\nin accepting the title of Governor-General from the Dutch.[1066] To say\r\nin the face of such methods, as does Mr. Green, that while she had\r\nlittle or no political wisdom, \"her political tact was unerring,\" is to\r\nframe a spurious paradox. The more than countervailing admission that\r\n\"in the profusion and recklessness of her lies Elizabeth stood without a\r\npeer in Christendom\" is perhaps overcharged: she could not lie more\r\nhabitually and systematically than did Philip; but in both alike the\r\nconstant resort to falsehoods for which their antagonists were more or\r\nless prepared, is a proof of want of political tact, no less than of\r\nwant of wisdom.[1067] That she should have been idolised as she was is\r\none of the best proofs of the power of the monarchic feeling; for there\r\nhas rarely been a less trustworthy woman on a throne. In any circle of\r\nsound human beings she would have been disliked and distrusted; yet\r\nEnglish tradition celebrates her as admirably English, in the act of\r\nblackening by comparison foreign rulers who were at least not\r\nconspicuously falser,[1068] meaner,[1069] or more egotistic. What is\r\ntrue is that many of the forces with and against which she intrigued\r\nwere either unscrupulous or irrational, and that her home tyrannies were\r\nno worse than those which would have been committed by Puritans or\r\nCatholics or Churchmen had these been free to go at each other's throats\r\nas religion bade. Her trickeries on the whole kept things in\r\nequilibrium. But conscienceless trickeries they were, and, as such,\r\nsingular grounds for historical enthusiasm. And it cannot have been any\r\nconcern for her celibacy, or subtle intuition of its effects on her\r\ncharacter, that endeared her to her subjects; for her often alleged\r\nvirginity, despite the gross scandals to the contrary, was an element in\r\nthe hallucination concerning her. \"Loyalty\" haloed her personality.\r\nWhen, however, she was succeeded by a man certainly not worse or more\r\nungenerous, the spell was for the most part broken. James was a\r\nScotchman--a member, albeit a king, of a hostile nation long evilly\r\nspoken of; a prince without personal dignity; a pedant without gravity;\r\nand the indulgence paid to falsehood and folly in the capriciously\r\nheadstrong Elizabeth ceased to be accorded to the unmanly and unregal\r\nways of her not unconscientious successor, whose plans for pacifying\r\nEurope were much more creditable to him than were her diplomacies to\r\nher. But the very preservation of peace served to undo the king's\r\nprestige, inasmuch as it furthered the growth of sects and the spirit of\r\ncriticism. And there can be no doubt that the psychological shrinkage of\r\nthe monarchy in public esteem in the person of James prepared the way\r\nfor the resistance to it in the reign of his son.\r\n\r\n     As against the foregoing views of Henry's and Elizabeth's\r\n     characters, note should be taken of the doctrine of Dr. Gardiner\r\n     (_History_, as cited, i, 43) that \"Henry VIII must be judged by\"\r\n     [_i.e._ in view of the merits of] \"the great men who supported his\r\n     daughter's throne, and who defended the land which he set free when\r\n     'he broke the bonds of Rome.' Elizabeth must be judged by the Pyms\r\n     and Cromwells, who ... owed their strength to the vigour with which\r\n     she _headed_ the resistance of England against Spanish aggression.\r\n     She had cleared the way for liberty, though she understood it not.\"\r\n     It seems necessary to enter a demurrer to such moral philosophy,\r\n     of which there is too much in recent English historiography.\r\n     Considering that the action of Henry towards all who thwarted him\r\n     was one of brutal terrorism, and that, save as regards his bribes,\r\n     he cowed alike his peers and his people, the courage shown by their\r\n     descendants might as rationally be credited to Philip of Spain as\r\n     to him. And to credit Elizabeth personally with the defeat of the\r\n     Armada, and consequently with the strength of the later Pyms and\r\n     Cromwells, is not only to reiterate the same paralogism but to\r\n     negate common sense as regards the facts of the Armada episode, in\r\n     which the nation did one half of the work, and the storm the other.\r\n     Dr. Gardiner, like Mr. Froude, who preaches a similar doctrine,\r\n     overlooks the consequence that Catholicism on these principles must\r\n     be credited with the production of Henry and Elizabeth, and\r\n     therefore with their alleged services. As against such an unmeaning\r\n     theory we may note another verdict of Dr. Gardiner's (p. 33):\r\n     \"Elizabeth has a thousand titles to our gratitude, but it should\r\n     never be forgotten that she left, as a legacy to her successor, an\r\n     ecclesiastical system which, unless its downward course were\r\n     arrested by consummate wisdom, threatened to divide the nation into\r\n     two hostile camps, and to leave England, even after necessity had\r\n     compelled the rivals to accept conditions of peace, a prey to\r\n     theological rancour and sectarian hatred.\" How then is the account\r\n     to be balanced? Dr. Cunningham, we may note, sums up as to the\r\n     preceding reigns that \"the scandalous confiscations of Henry VIII\r\n     and Edward VI were fatal to rural economy and disastrous to\r\n     mercantile dealings. The disintegration of society became complete;\r\n     ... with some exceptions in regard to shipping and possibly in\r\n     regard to the repair of the towns, there is no improvement, no\r\n     reconstruction which can be traced to the reign of the Tudor kings\"\r\n     (_English Industry_, i, 433).

Prof. Rogers's _Industrial and\r\n     Commercial History_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 8\r\n\r\nWhile such changes were being wrought at one end of the political\r\norganism, others no less momentous, and partly causative of those, had\r\ntaken place at the other. By economic writers the period of the\r\nReformation in England is now not uncommonly marked as that of a great\r\nalteration for the worse in the lot of the mass of the peasantry.[1070]\r\nThe connection between the overthrow of the Catholic Church and the\r\nagrarian trouble, however, is not of the primary character that is thus\r\nsupposed: it might be rather called accidental than causal. Suppression\r\nof the monasteries could at most only throw into prominence the poverty\r\nwhich the monasteries relieved, but which monasteries always tend to\r\ndevelop.[1071] Wholesale eviction of husbandmen to make way for\r\nsheep-farms had taken place, the Church helping, before Henry VIII began\r\nto meddle with the Church; and vagabondage and beggary were common in\r\nconsequence.[1072] The distress was there to begin with, and was\r\nincreasing, from what period onward it were hard to say.\r\n\r\nThe early fifteenth-century riots against \"enclosures,\" above mentioned,\r\narose out of the policy of systematically extending pasture, and point\r\nto a distress set up by the gradual growth of gain-seeking methods among\r\nlandowners as against the common people,[1073] whose normal tendency to\r\nmultiply was a constant force making for poverty, though it was met\r\nhalf-way by the aggression of landlords who found it more profitable to\r\nraise and export wool than to farm.[1074] A fresh source of dislocation\r\nwas the enforcement of laws against the keeping of bands of retainers, a\r\nprocess to which Henry VII specially devoted himself,[1075] thus\r\nsecuring his throne on the one hand while intensifying the evil of\r\ndepopulation and decreasing tillage, for which on the other hand he\r\ntried remedial measures,[1076] of the customary description. Laws were\r\npassed forbidding the peasantry to seek industrial employment in the\r\ncities--this course being taken as well in the interests of the trades\r\nas with the hope of restoring agriculture. One outcome of the\r\ncircumstances was that sheep-farming, like the cloth manufacture, began\r\nto be carried on by capitalists;[1077] the moneyed classes beginning to\r\nreach out to the country, while the gentry began to draw towards the\r\ntowns.[1078] Thus we find in existence long before the Reformation all\r\nthe economic troubles which some writers attribute to the methods of the\r\nReformation; though the Protestant nobles who scrambled for the plunder\r\nof the Church in the reigns of Henry and of Edward VI seem to have done\r\nmore sheep-farming and depopulating than any others, thereby disposing\r\nthe people the more to welcome Mary.[1079]\r\n\r\n     Even Prof. Thorold Rogers, who (overlooking the Act 4 Henry VII)\r\n     seems to hold that the enclosures in the fifteenth century were not\r\n     made at the expense of tillage, and that the earliest complaints\r\n     are in the sixteenth century (_History of Agriculture and Prices_,\r\n     iv, 63, 64 note, 109: cp. Cunningham, _English Industry_, i, 393\r\n     _note_), still shows that there were heavy complaints as early as\r\n     1515 (6 Hen. VIII, cc. 5, 6) of a general decay of towns and growth\r\n     of pastures--long before Henry had meddled with the Church. Bishop\r\n     Stubbs is explicit on the subject as regards the period of York and\r\n     Lancaster:--\"The price of wool enhanced the value of pasturage; the\r\n     increased value of pasturage withdrew field after field from\r\n     tillage; the decline of tillage, the depression of the markets, and\r\n     the monopoly of the wool trade by the staple towns, reduced those\r\n     country towns which had not encouraged manufacture to such poverty\r\n     that they were unable to pay their contingent to the revenue, and\r\n     the regular sum of tenths and fifteenths was reduced by more than a\r\n     fifth in consequence. The same causes which in the sixteenth\r\n     century made the enclosure of the commons a most important popular\r\n     grievance, had begun to set class against class as early as the\r\n     fourteenth century, although the thinning of the population by the\r\n     Plague acted to some extent as a corrective\" (_Constitutional\r\n     History_, iii, 630; cp. Green, ch. v, Sec. 5, p. 251; ch. vi, Sec. 3, p.\r\n     285).\r\n\r\nThe troubles, again, were fluctuating, the movement of depopulation and\r\nsheep-farming being followed in due course by a revival of tillage,\r\nwhile contrary movements might be seen in different parts of the\r\ncountry, according as commercial advantage lay for the moment. In one\r\ndistrict it might pay best to rear sheep; in another, by reason of\r\nnearness to town markets, it might pay best to grow corn; but the\r\ncompetition of corn imported from the Baltic in return for English\r\nexports would be a generally disturbing force. The very improvement of\r\nagricultural skill, too, in which Holland led the way,[1080] would tend\r\nto lessen employment in the rural districts. Peace and progress, in the\r\nabsence of science, always thus provide new sources of distress,\r\nmultiplying heads and hands without multiplying the employment which\r\nsecures for the multitude a share in the fruits, but always aggrandising\r\nthose who have contrived to become possessed of the prime monopolies.\r\nWhat went on was a perpetual transference and displacement of\r\nwell-being, one class rising on another's distress; and after the\r\napparently steady decay of the towns under Henry VIII,[1081] the new\r\nlead given to industry in the reign of Elizabeth, by the influx of\r\nProtestant refugees from the Netherlands, went to build up an urban\r\nmiddle class which for the time had no political motives to discontent.\r\n\r\n     Sir Thomas More, in the very passage of the _Utopia_ in which he\r\n     speaks of the wholesale eviction of husbandmen, tells how\r\n     \"handicraft men, yea, and almost the ploughmen of the country, with\r\n     all other sorts of people, use much strange and proud new\r\n     fangleness in their apparel, and too much prodigal riot and\r\n     sumptuous fare at their table\" (bk. i, Robinson's trans.). New\r\n     wealth and new poverty co-existed. \"Cheapness and dearness, plenty\r\n     and scarcity, of corn and other food, depopulation and rapidly\r\n     increasing numbers, really co-existed in the kingdom. There were\r\n     places from which the husbandman and labourer disappeared, and the\r\n     beasts of the field grazed where their cottages had stood; and\r\n     there were places where men were multiplying to the dismay of\r\n     statesmen.\" Cliffe Leslie, essay on _The Distribution and Value of\r\n     the Precious Metals_, vol. cited, p. 268. The whole of this essay\r\n     is well worth study. Cp. Prof. Ashley, _Introduction to Economic\r\n     History_, ii, 50-54.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 9\r\n\r\nHence there was no continuous pressure of agrarian or industrial\r\npolitics, and the stress of the instinct of strife went in other\r\ndirections. The modern reader, seeking for the class politics of the\r\nlater Tudor period, finds them as it were covered up, save for such an\r\nepisode as the revolt of 1549, by the record of foreign policy and\r\necclesiastical strifes, and is apt to condemn the historian for leaving\r\nmatters so. But in reality class politics was for the most part\r\nsuperseded by sect politics. The new pseudo-culture of bibliolatry,\r\nvirtually a sophisticated barbarism, had made new paths for feeling; and\r\nthese being the more durable, the miseries of the evicted rural\r\npopulations, which forced a Poor Law on the administration, never set up\r\nanything approaching to a persistent spirit of insurrection. By the\r\nsuppression of the old feudal nobility, as already noted, life in\r\ngeneral had been made freer; and the monarch for the time being was\r\nbecome a relatively beneficent and worshipful power in the eyes of the\r\nmass of the people, while the landowners were grown weak for harm. The\r\ndestructive passions were running in other channels, and religious hate\r\nswallowed up class hate. For the rest, the new aristocracy was\r\nthoroughly established; and in the life and work of Shakespeare himself\r\nwe see the complete acceptance of the readjusted class relation, though\r\nwe can also see in his pages the possibilities of a new upper class of\r\nrich merchants. In his impersonal way he flashes the light of Lear's\r\ntardy sympathy on the forlorn world of the homeless poor; and in many a\r\nphrase he condenses an intense criticism of the injustices of class\r\nrule; but even if, as seems certain, he did not write the Jack Cade\r\nscenes in _Henry VI_, he has little of the purposive democrat in him:\r\nrather--though here it is hard indeed to get behind the great humanist's\r\nmask--some touch of the fastidious contempt of the noble, himself fickle\r\nenough, for the changing voice of the ignorant populace.\r\n\r\nOn one point of current psychology, however, as on the great issue of\r\nreligion, Shakespeare's very silence is more significant than speech.\r\nAfter the passionate outburst put in the mouth of the dying John of\r\nGaunt, and the normal patriotism of _Henry V_, utterances of his early\r\nmanhood, proceeding upon those of the older plays which he re-wrote, we\r\nfind in his dramas a notable aloofness from current public passion. This\r\nwould of course be encouraged by the regulations for the stage; but no\r\nregulation need have hindered him from pandering habitually to popular\r\nself-righteousness in the matter of national animosities. In 1596 the\r\nmultitude were all on the side of the fire-eating Essex and against the\r\nprudent Burghley in the matter of aggressive war upon Spain; hope of\r\nplunder and conquest playing as large a part in their outcry as any\r\nbetter sentiment. The production of _Henry V_ in 1599, with its\r\nlaudatory allusion to Essex's doings in Ireland, whither he had been\r\naccompanied by Shakespeare's patron Southampton, would suggest, if the\r\npassage were of his penning,[1082] that the dramatist was one of Essex's\r\npartisans. But whichever way he then leaned, no man can gather from his\r\nlater plays any encouragement to natural passion of any species. It is\r\nnot merely that he avoids politics after having been compromised by\r\ncontact with them:[1083] it is that he rises to a higher plane of\r\nthought and feeling.[1084] He, if any man, could see the fatuity with\r\nwhich Englishmen denounced cruelty in Spaniards while matching Spanish\r\ncruelty in Ireland, and cursed the Inquisition while mishandling Jesuit\r\npriests in the Inquisition's own temper. The story of English cruelty in\r\nIreland in Elizabeth's and James's day is one of the most sickening in\r\nthe history of the epoch.[1085] But no sense of guilt ever checked the\r\nblatant self-sufficiency with which the general run of Englishmen of the\r\ntime inveighed against the misdeeds of the Spaniards: no twinge of\r\nself-criticism ever modified their righteous thanksgiving over the\r\ndefeat of the Armada, which was manned partly to avenge their own\r\nmassacre and torture of Catholic priests. Their Drakes and Hawkinses,\r\nplaying the pirate and the slave-stealer, and holding with no qualms the\r\nconviction that they were doing God service, made current the cant of\r\nPuritanism in the pre-Puritan generation. Godly ruffianism could not\r\nlater go further than it did in \"the Elizabethan dawn\"; for Milton's\r\nswelling phrase of \"God and his Englishmen\" did not outgo the\r\nself-satisfaction of the previous age, any more than of the later period\r\nof \"Teutonic\" self-glorification. To Shakespeare alone seems to have\r\nbeen possible the simple reflection that God's Spaniards, equating with\r\nGod's Englishmen, left zero to the philosopher.\r\n\r\n     It seems clear that the mass of the people, and such leading men as\r\n     Essex and Raleigh, desired a continuance of the state of war with\r\n     Spain because of the opportunities it gave for piratical plunder.\r\n     The queen, who had shared in the loot of a good many such\r\n     expeditions, might have acquiesced but for Burghley's dissuasion.\r\n     It was an early sign of predilection to the path of imperialism, on\r\n     which Cromwell later put one foot, on which Chatham carried the\r\n     nation far, and which it has in later days at times seemed bent on\r\n     pursuing. In Elizabeth's day enterprises of plunder, as one writer\r\n     has pointed out, \"became the usual adventure of the times, by which\r\n     the rich expected to increase their wealth and the prodigal to\r\n     repair their fortunes\"; and the general imagination was fired with\r\n     similar hopes, till \"the people were in danger of acquiring the\r\n     habits and the calculations of pirates.\" (J. M'Diarmid, _Lives of\r\n     British Statesmen_, 1820, i, 239, 240; cp. Furnivall and Simpson in\r\n     the latter's _School of Shakespeare_, 1878, i, pp. x, 32-40; and\r\n     see Rogers, _Industrial and Commercial History_, p. 12, as to the\r\n     contemporary lack of commercial enterprise.) Cecil, in his\r\n     opposition to the war policy of Essex, remarkably anticipates the\r\n     view of rational historical science (see Camden's _Annales_, ed.\r\n     1717, iii, 770-71, as to the conflict.) Burghley had equally been\r\n     the resisting force to the popular desire for an attack on France\r\n     after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. His remarkable hostility to\r\n     militarism is set forth in his _Advice_ to his son, on the head of\r\n     the training to be given to his children: \"Neither, by my consent,\r\n     shalt thou train them up in wars; for he that sets up his rest to\r\n     live by that profession can hardly be an honest man or a good\r\n     Christian.\" Yet he planned well enough against the Armada. Cp.\r\n     Creighton, _Queen Elizabeth_, pp. 236, 237.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 10\r\n\r\nThe culture history of the period from Chaucer to Shakespeare is perhaps\r\nclearer than the political. It is in the first great lull of the Wars of\r\nthe Roses, under Edward IV, that we find printing established in\r\nEngland. Original literature had virtually died out, as in northern\r\nEurope, in the long stress of physical strife; but the love of reading\r\ntook a new growth when peace intervened, and a printer found a public\r\nfor reproductions of the literatures of the past. This culture proceeded\r\nunder Henry VII, till at the advent of Henry VIII there was a mature\r\nmovement of scholarship, a product of classical study and reflection,\r\nyielding for England the singular and memorable fruit of More's\r\n_Utopia_. That was truly a \"Pallas of the brain,\" not \"wild\" as in the\r\nphrase of the conservative poet, but well-nigh pure of the blind passion\r\nof normal life,[1086] and therefore no more than a radiant vision for an\r\nage in which blind passion was still plenipotent. More's mind had\r\nripened as it were independently of his temperament; and his life is the\r\ntragedy of an intelligence, more haunting and more profoundly\r\ninstructive than any _Hamlet_. The serene spirit that dreamed and\r\nplanned the _Utopia_ grew to be capable of a bitterness of dogmatic\r\nfanaticism on a level with the normal passions of the time.[1087] It is\r\nmatter for surprise that he has not ere now been studied or cited as an\r\napparition of the \"Celtic\" mind on the arena of brutal English\r\nlife,[1088] a prematurely penetrating intelligence thrust back upon and\r\nenveloped by a temperament kept passionate by the shocks of an animal\r\nenvironment. From his eyes, limned by the great Holbein, there looks out\r\nthe sadness of flawed and frustrate wisdom; even as blood and passion\r\nand fleshly madness are written in the beastlike face of the king, whose\r\nlittle son, ruddy and hardy in his babyhood, pales and pines away\r\nthrough portrait after portrait to puberty and death, the victim of some\r\nsecret malady.\r\n\r\nNeither on the psychological line of More nor on that of Henry could the\r\nnational culture proceed. It went on naively, being for long neither\r\nPuritan nor anti-Puritan, though the loquacious and commonplace\r\nutterance of preachers already abounded before the accession of\r\nElizabeth. The Protestantism of the Protectorate was too much a matter\r\nof mere plunder to admit of a great religious literature; and nothing is\r\nmore remarkable in the great imaginative efflorescence under Elizabeth\r\nthan its un-Puritan secularity. It drew, indeed, from a soil too rich to\r\nbe yet overrun by fanaticism. The multiplying printing-presses showered\r\nforth a hundred translations; the new grammar-schools bore their fruit;\r\nthe nation grew by domestic peace, even while tillers of the soil were\r\nbeing made beggars; the magic of discovery and travel thrilled men to\r\nnew exercises of mind and speech; the swarming life of the capital\r\nraised the theatre to fecund energy in a generation; and transformed\r\nfeudalism survived in the guise rather of a guardian to art and letters\r\nthan of organised class oppression. A new economic factor, conditioned\r\nby a new resource, was at work. In More's day there was no such thing as\r\na professional writer, and there were few printed books. The great\r\ncontroversy between Protestants and Catholics gave a new and powerful\r\nstimulus to printing, and printing in turn invited literary effort,\r\nbooks finding multiplying purchasers. Then came the growth of the new\r\ntheatre, an apparent means of livelihood to a crowd of poet-dramatists.\r\nNo such sudden outcrop of manifold literature had ever before occurred\r\nin human history; the mental distance between Elyot and Bacon, between\r\nthe old interludes and Shakespeare, is as great as that between Hesiod\r\nand Euripides. But the secret of continuous progress had not yet been\r\nfound: it lies, if anywhere, with the science of the future: and the\r\ndevelopment after the reign of Elizabeth necessarily began to take new\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe later profusion of the poetic drama was the profusion of decay.\r\nArtistic abundance must mean artistic change or deterioration; but in\r\nthe drama there was no recasting of the artistic formulas, no refining\r\nof the artistic sense, because there was no progress in general culture\r\nsufficient to force or educe it. Rather the extraordinary eloquence of\r\nthe earlier and greater dramatists, and in particular of the greatest,\r\nbred a cultus of conventional rhetoric and declamation in which the\r\npower and passion of the masters were lost. Powerful men could not go on\r\nattending to an infinity of such blank-verse dramas; powerful men could\r\nnot go on producing dramas, because the mind of the time made no\r\nprogress complementary to the great flowering of the Elizabethan peace.\r\nThat was essentially a late rebirth of the classic or bookish culture of\r\nthe Renaissance. New germinal ideas, apart from those of religion, were\r\nyet to come. Already the spell of Bibliolatry was conquering the average\r\nintelligence, unprepared to digest Hebraism as the _elite_ of the\r\nprevious generation had digested classicism; and the Protestant\r\nprinciple led the Protestant peoples in the mass into the very attitude\r\nneeded for a social hypnotism such as that of Jewry, the fatal exemplar.\r\nBibliolatry is the culture of the ignorant; church government, the\r\npolitics of the unenfranchised and the impractical; their conditions\r\nexclude them from a truer culture and more vital political interests.\r\nAlready in Henry's time the newly-translated Scriptures were, to his\r\nwrath, \"disputed, rhymed, sung, and jangled in every tavern and\r\nalehouse\"; the very stress of his own personal rule being a main part of\r\nthe cause. Under the Protectorate of Somerset the gross rapacity of the\r\nProtestant nobles identified the new Church with upper-class selfishness\r\nas completely as the old had ever been; and the Norfolk revolt of 1549\r\navowedly aimed at the overthrow of the gentry. When that was stamped out\r\nin massacre, the spirit of popular independence was broken, save in so\r\nfar as it could play in the new channel of personal religion and\r\necclesiastical polemic, always being dug by the disputation of the new\r\nclergy. And when in the reign of Mary crowds of Protestant refugees fled\r\nto Geneva, of which the polity had already been introduced to the\r\nstudents of Oxford by Peter Martyr, there was set up a fresh ferment of\r\nPresbyterian theory among the educated class which the ecclesiastical\r\nconditions under Elizabeth could not but foster. The new dramatic\r\nliterature and the new national life of anti-Spanish adventure kept it\r\nall substantially in the background for another generation; but the lack\r\nof progressive culture and the restriction of expansive enterprise at\r\nlength gave the forces of pietism the predominance. Thus, in ways in\r\nwhich the historians of our literature and politics have but imperfectly\r\ntraced, the balance of the nation's intellectual activity shifted\r\ntowards the ground of religion and the ecclesiastical life. And only\r\nthis change of mental drift can account for the new energy of resistance\r\nincurred by Charles when he took up with greater obstinacy the lines of\r\npolicy of his father, meddling with church practice and normal\r\ngovernment on the same autocratic principles. Religion and worship were\r\nnot the sole grounds of quarrel, but they commanded all the other\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe decadence of English poetic drama after the death of Shakespeare is\r\none of the themes which elicit illustrations of the snares of empirical\r\nsociology. An able and original literary critic, Mr. G.C. Macaulay, at\r\nthe close of a very competent study on Francis Beaumont, has formulated\r\na theory of that decadence which calls for revision. He pronounces that\r\nby 1615 \"the impulse which had moved the older generation was ... almost\r\nexhausted. This, as we have already seen, came in the form of an\r\nenthusiastic patriotism, ennobling human life, so far at least as\r\nEnglishmen were concerned in it, and producing a united and national\r\ninterest in the representation of its problems and destiny\" (_Francis\r\nBeaumont_, 1883, p. 187).\r\n\r\nError here emerges at once. It was not national patriotism that evoked\r\neither the pre-Shakespearean or the Shakespearean drama. The rude\r\nfoundations had been laid by many \"interludes,\" by such homespun comedy\r\nas _Ralph Roister Doister_, and by the stilted tragedy of _Ferrex and\r\nPorrex_. The chronicle-plays of Greene and Peele and Marlowe, worked\r\nover by Shakespeare, are far from being the best of the\r\npre-Shakespearean drama. Just after the Armada, Marlowe revealed his\r\npowers, not in patriotic plays, but in _Tamburlaine_, followed by _The\r\nJew of Malta_, and _Faustus_. The best of the pre-Shakespearean plays on\r\nEnglish history was Marlowe's _Edward II_, in which there was and could\r\nbe no appeal to patriotic fervour. The best episode in _Edward III_\r\nstands out entirely from the \"patriotic\" part, which is nearly\r\nworthless. The superior episode is probably the work of Greene, whose\r\nbest complete play, _James IV_, turns on fictitious Scottish history,\r\nand is only momentarily touched by patriotic feeling. Peele's _Edward I_\r\nis inferior as a whole to his _David and Bethsabe_. Kyd made his\r\nsuccesses, literary or theatrical, with _The Spanish Tragedy_, _Arden of\r\nFeversham_, and the original _Hamlet_. Shakespeare's best work, from the\r\nstart, is done not in the chronicle-plays but in his comedies, in his\r\nFalstaff scenes, and in his tragedies, from _Romeo and Juliet_ onwards.\r\nThese had nothing to do with patriotism, enthusiastic or otherwise. And\r\n_Henry V_, which had, is not a great play.\r\n\r\nThe chief florescence of Elizabethan drama is to be understood in the\r\nlight of economic causation; and the decline is to be understood\r\nsimilarly. The rise of the London theatres, a process of expansion\r\nfollowing on the maintenance of separate companies of players by\r\nnoblemen and by the court, meant a means of livelihood for actors and\r\nplaywrights, and of profit for _entrepreneurs_. Greene and Peele, and\r\nKyd and Marlowe, and Jonson and Chapman, wrote not to evoke or respond\r\nto national patriotism, but to provide plays that would sell and \"draw.\"\r\nThe original genius of Marlowe stimulated the others, who nearly all\r\nimitated him. _Orlando Furioso_, _Selimus_, _Alphonsus King of\r\nArragon_, _David and Bethsabe_, and even _The Battle of Alcazar_, have\r\nnothing to do with patriotism; and the touches of that in _Friar Bacon\r\nand Friar Bungay_ are subsidiary to the story. There is no extant play\r\non the Armada.\r\n\r\nIt is pure supererogation, then, to argue that \"everything had been done\r\nby the first Stuart king to cool down patriotism, and to diminish the\r\nself-respect and pride of Englishmen; while at the same time, by his\r\ninsolent hitherto unheard-of (?) divine-right pretensions, he alarmed\r\nthem for their political liberties, and by his ecclesiastical policy he\r\nexasperated theological controversy; thus contriving, both in politics\r\nand in religion, to destroy unity and foster party spirit to an extent\r\nwhich had been unknown for nearly half-a-century. The condition of\r\nthings,\" adds Mr. Macaulay, \"was unfavourable to everything national,\r\nand above all things to the national drama, which became rather the\r\namusement of the idle than the embodiment of a popular enthusiasm.\" Need\r\nit be pointed out that all of Shakespeare's greatest work, after\r\n_Hamlet_, which was anything but \"national,\" was produced after the\r\naccession of James? What had popular enthusiasm to do with _Othello_,\r\n_Macbeth_, _Lear_, _Coriolanus_, _Antony and Cleopatra_, _The Tempest_,\r\nand _The Winter's Tale_?\r\n\r\nThe really explanatory factors are (1) the economic, (2) the trend of\r\npopular culture. Shakespeare alone of the dramatists of his day made\r\nanything like a good income; and he did so in virtue of being an actor\r\nand a prudent partner in the proprietorship of his theatre. Kyd, Greene,\r\nand Peele all died in misery; and Marlowe must have lived his short life\r\nfrom hand to mouth. Jonson subsisted chiefly by his masques and by the\r\ngifts of patrons, and by his own avowal was always poor. Chapman can\r\nhave fared no better. The concurrence of the abnormal genius of\r\nShakespeare with his gift of commercial management is one of the rarest\r\nthings in literary history: take that away, and the problem of the\r\n\"decadence\" is seen to be merely part of the statement of the \"rise.\"\r\nWhen men of superior power, taught by the past, ceased to defy poverty\r\nby writing for the theatre--and even the vogue of Fletcher and Massinger\r\nrepresented no solid monetary success--plays could less than ever appeal\r\nto the \"serious\" and sectarian sections of the London public. Popular\r\nculture ran on the sterile lines of pietism, Puritanism, and the strifes\r\nengendered between these and sacerdotalism. All this had begun long\r\nbefore James, though he may have promoted the evolution. Literary art\r\nperforce turned to other forms. A successful national war could no more\r\nhave regenerated the drama than the wars of Henry V could generate it.\r\nThere was plenty of \"national enthusiasm\" later, in the periods of\r\nMarlborough and Chatham: there was no great drama; and the new fiction\r\nhad as little to do with patriotism as had Shakespeare's comedies and\r\ntragedies. Defoe's _Robinson Crusoe_ was not inspired by his politics.\r\n\r\nIt is well to recognise, finally, that in the nature of things aesthetic,\r\nevery artistic convention must in time be \"played out,\" the law of\r\nvariation involving deviations or recoils. Blank-verse drama is a\r\nspecially limited convention, which only great genius can vitalise. Even\r\nin this connection, however, there is danger in _a priori_ theorising.\r\nMr. Macaulay quotes from Schlegel the generalisation that \"in the\r\ncommencement of a degeneracy in the dramatic art, the spectators first\r\nlose the capability of judging of a play as a whole\"; hence \"the harmony\r\nof the composition, and the due proportion between all the various parts\r\nis apt to be neglected, and the flagging interest is stimulated by\r\nscenes of horror or strange and startling incidents.\" The implication is\r\nthat the Jacobean drama degenerated in this way. Again the facts are\r\nopposed to the thesis. If we are to believe Shakespeare and Jonson and\r\nBeaumont, the audiences never appreciated plays as wholes. Scenes of\r\n\"comic relief,\" utterly alien to the action, come in as early as\r\n_Locrine_. Scenes of physical and moral horror, again, abound in the\r\npre-Shakespearean drama: in _The Spanish Tragedy_ and _Arden of\r\nFeversham_, in _David and Bethsabe_, in _Titus Andronicus_ (a\r\npre-Shakespearean atrocity), in _Selimus_ and _Tancred and Gismunda_,\r\nand _Alphonsus Emperor of Germany_ (a Greene-Peele play wrongly ascribed\r\nto Chapman), they are multiplied _ad nauseam_. Rapes, assassinations,\r\nincest, tearing-out of eyes and cutting-off of hands, the kissing of a\r\nhusband's excised heart by his wife, the unwitting eating of her\r\nchildren's flesh by a mother, the dashing out of a child's brains by its\r\ngrandfather--such are among the flowers of the Elizabethan time. On\r\nSchlegel's theory, there was degeneration before there was success.\r\nWebster's \"horrors\" do not seem to have won him great vogue; and Ford's\r\nneurotic products had no great popularity. Doubtless weak performers\r\ntend to resort to violent devices; but they did so before Shakespeare;\r\nand Shakespeare did not stick at trifles in _Lear_ and _Othello_.\r\n\r\nDecadence in art-forms, in short, is to be studied like other forms of\r\ndecadence, in the light of the totality of conditions; and is not to be\r\nexplained in terms of itself. Mr. Macaulay's thesis as a whole might be\r\nrebutted by simply citing the fact that the florescence of Spanish drama\r\nat the hands of Lope de Vega and Calderon occurred in a period of\r\npolitical decline, when \"patriotic enthusiasm\" had nothing to live upon.\r\nVega began play-writing just after the defeat of the Armada; and his\r\n_Dragontea_, written in exultation over the death of Drake, is not a\r\nmemorable performance. Velasquez, like Calderon, flourished under Philip\r\nIV, in a time of national depression and defeat.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 987: \"The distinctive characteristics of the Saxon\r\nrace--talents for agriculture, navigation, and commerce\" (T.

A pauper class was inevitable, whatever\r\nlaws were made.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1074: Bishop Stubbs puts it (iii, 283) that the increase of\r\ncommerce during the Wars of the Roses was \"to some extent a refuge for\r\nexhausted families, and a safety-valve for energies shut out of their\r\nproper sphere.\" The proposition in this form is obscure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1075: On this see Stubbs, ch. xxi, Sec.Sec. 470, 471.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1076: Act 4 Hen.

Religious antipathies, indeed, no longer rested on the naked\r\nground of lands taken and in danger of being re-taken;[1090] but there\r\nhad been developed an intense animus of Protestant against Catholic, the\r\ninstinct of strife running the more violently in that channel because so\r\nfew others were open, relatively to the store of restless brute force in\r\nthe country. Perhaps, indeed, Presbyterians hated Episcopalians and\r\nArminians, at bottom, nearly as much as they did Catholics; but the\r\nchronic panics, from the time of Elizabeth onwards, the mythology of the\r\nMarian period, and the story of the massacres of Alva and of St.\r\nBartholomew's Day, served to unite Protestants in this one point of\r\nanti-Papalism, and had set up as it were a new human passion in the\r\nsphere of English politics. And to this passion James and Charles in\r\nturn ran counter with an infatuated persistence. James, who was so much\r\nmore annoyed by Puritans than by Papists, planned for his son, with an\r\neye to a dowry, the Spanish marriage, which of all possible matches\r\nwould most offend the English people; and when that fell through,\r\nanother Catholic bride was found in the daughter of the King of France.\r\nThe pledges, so natural in the circumstances, to \"tolerate\" Catholics\r\nin England, were a standing ground of panic to the intolerant\r\nProtestants, even though unfulfilled; and the new king stood in the\r\nsinister position of sheltering in his household the religion for which\r\nhe dared not claim freedom in the country. Such a ground of unpopularity\r\ncould be balanced only by some signal grounds of favour; but James and\r\nCharles alike chose unpopular grounds of war, and failed badly to boot.\r\nTo crown all, they exhibited to the full the hereditary unwisdom of\r\ntheir dynasty in the choice of favourites;[1091] and the almost\r\nunexampled animosity incurred by Buckingham could not but reflect\r\nsomewhat towards Charles, whose refined and artistic tastes, besides,\r\nmade him the natural enemy of the text-worshipping and mostly art-hating\r\nPuritans.\r\n\r\nThus everything made for friction between king and subjects; and when\r\nCharles, to raise necessary funds, resorted to measures of no abnormal\r\noppressiveness as compared with those of the Tudors, he was doggedly\r\nresisted by Parliaments professedly standing on law, but really actuated\r\nby a fixed suspicion of all his aims. Teeth were on edge all round. When\r\na merchant, mulcted in a heavy customs duty, happened to be a Puritan,\r\nhe resisted with a special zest; and one such declared before the Privy\r\nCouncil that \"in no part of the world, not even in Turkey, were the\r\nmerchants so screwed and wrung as in England.\"[1092] The King, unhappily\r\nfor himself, conciliated nobody. Not content with alienating nobles by\r\nimposing huge fines in revival of the forest laws, he incensed the\r\nCorporation of London by confiscating their estates in Ulster, conferred\r\nby his father, and levying a fine of L70,000 to boot, for alleged\r\nbreaches of Charter.[1093] Besides selling many trade monopolies, he\r\npassed vexatious sumptuary laws, fixing the prices of poultry, butter,\r\nand coals, and insisting on the incorporation of all tradesmen and\r\nartificers.[1094] The friction was well-nigh universal; and but for the\r\nremarkable prosperity built up by the long peace,[1095] the trouble\r\nmight have come much sooner. But it is idle to keep up the pretence that\r\nwhat was at stake was the principle of freedom. The first demand of the\r\nParliamentary Opposition was for the more thorough persecution of the\r\nCatholics. Parliamentarians such as Eliot were more oppressive in\r\nreligious matters than Laud himself. He sought only uniformity of\r\nworship, they uniformity of doctrine; and they punished for heresy more\r\nunpardonably than did the Star Chamber for gross libel.\r\n\r\n     See Gardiner, _History of England, 1603-1642_, small ed. v, 191, as\r\n     to Eliot's plans to fit out the fleet by means of \"those penalties\r\n     the Papists have already incurred\"--a proposal which, says Dr.\r\n     Gardiner, \"if it had been translated into figures, would have\r\n     created a tyranny too monstrous to be contemplated with\r\n     equanimity.\" And Eliot was all for a persecution of the Arminians\r\n     (_id._ vii, 42-43). In 1645 the Corporation of London petitioned\r\n     Parliament to suppress \"all sects without toleration.\"\r\n\r\nNor were they less oppressive in their fiscal policy. After beginning a\r\nrevolt against illegal taxation, Pym secured the imposition of taxes on\r\nbeverages (1643), on flesh, salt, textile goods, and many other\r\ncommodities, \"at the sword's point,\" against the general resistance of\r\nthe people.[1096] There were at work a hundred motives of strife; and it\r\nwas only the preternatural ill-luck or unwisdom of Charles that united\r\nParliament against him so long. It needed all the infatuation of an\r\nexpress training in the metaphysics of divine right to enable a king of\r\nEngland, even after James I, to blunder through the immense network of\r\nsuperstition that hedged him round; indeed, the very intensity of the\r\nroyalist superstition best explains the royal infatuation. So fixed was\r\nthe monarchic principle in the minds of the people, who, then as later,\r\nswore by monarchy but hated paying for it, that in the earlier years of\r\nthe struggle not even the zealots could have dreamt of the end that was\r\nto be. Regicide entered no man's mind, even as a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nOn Charles, as the greatest \"architect of ruin\" in English political\r\nhistory, psychological interest fastens with only less intensity than on\r\nhis great antagonist. The astonishing triple portrait by Vandyke\r\nreveals, with an audacity that is positively startling when we think of\r\nthe other effigies by the same artist, a character stamped at once with\r\nimpotence and untruth. One slight suggestion of strength lies in the\r\nlook of grave self-esteem--a quality which would in Charles be fostered\r\nfrom the first by his refined revolt from the undignified ways of his\r\nfather; but it is withal the very countenance of duplicity. Puritan\r\nprejudice could not exaggerate the testimony of the daring artist. We\r\nseem to understand at once how he deceived and alienated Holland and\r\nSpain as well as the parties among his own subjects. And it was the very\r\nexcess of duplicity, or rather the fatal combination of duplicity with\r\ninfirmity of purpose,[1097] that destroyed the man. As the war wore on,\r\nand above all after it was closed, the discords of the Parliament and\r\nthe army were such that the most ordinary practical sagacity could have\r\nturned them to the triumph of the king's cause. This is the most\r\ninstructive phase of the Rebellion. The Presbyterian majority which had\r\ngrown up in Parliament--a growth still imperfectly elucidated--represented\r\nonly one of the great warring sects of the day; and if, after\r\nIndependency, led by Cromwell, had come to daggers drawn with the despots\r\nof the Commons, Charles had only agreed to any working settlement\r\nwhatever, he might with perfect confidence have left the conflicting\r\nforces to throttle each other afterwards. Any arrangement he might have\r\nmade, whether with the Presbyterians or with Cromwell, would\r\nhave broken down of itself, and he might have set up his own polity in\r\nthe end. But he so enjoyed his intrigues, as it were indemnifying\r\nhimself by them for his weakness of will, that he thought to triumph by\r\nthem alone, and would not wait for the slower chemistry of normal\r\npolitical development; so that the Independents, driven desperate by his\r\ndeceits, had to execute him in self-preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nAs it was, the history of the Rebellion remains none the less the\r\ntragi-comedy of the old constitutionalism. Parliament, resisting as\r\nillegal the supremacy of the king, went from one illegality to another\r\nin resisting him, till his tyrannies became trivial in comparison. And\r\nCromwell, who must have set out with convictions about the sanctity of\r\nlaw, although doubtless fundamentally moved by the all-pervading fear of\r\nPopery, was led by an ironical fate, step by step, into a series of\r\npolitical crimes which, if those of Charles deserved beheading, could be\r\ncoped with only in the medieval hell.\r\n\r\n     Cp. Hallam, ii, 252; and Cowley's _Essays_, ed. 1868, p. 139 _et\r\n     seq._ To say nothing of Cromwell's illegal exactions, his selling\r\n     of at least fifty Englishmen into slavery in the West Indies (on\r\n     which see Cowley, p. 168; Hallam, ii, 271, _note_; and Carlyle,\r\n     _Letters and Speeches_, ed. 1857, iii, 100--where the victims are\r\n     put at \"hundreds\")--albeit no worse than the similar selling of\r\n     Irish and Scotch prisoners--was an act which, if committed earlier\r\n     by any king, would have covered his name with historical infamy.\r\n     Prof. Firth points out that the practice began under James I, but\r\n     it was then applied only to felons and vagrants. Cromwell's example\r\n     was followed under Charles II with regard to the Covenanting rebels\r\n     in Scotland; and the plan was again followed in the cases of\r\n     Monmouth's rebellion and that of 1715. (Cited in note on Lomas's\r\n     ed. of Carlyle's _Cromwell_, ii, 438.) As regards Ireland, the\r\n     selling of prisoners into slavery was not restricted to the case of\r\n     the survivors of Drogheda (Carlyle's _Cromwell_, as cited, ii, 53;\r\n     ed. Lomas, i, 469). It is proved that Cromwell's agents captured\r\n     not only youths, but girls, for export to the West Indies\r\n     (Prendergast, _The Cromwellian Settlement_, 2nd ed. p. 89); and\r\n     that the slavery there was of the cruellest sort (Cunningham,\r\n     _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, ii, 109), though it has\r\n     to be kept in view that it was not perpetual; the victim being\r\n     strictly an \"indentured labourer,\" only for a certain number of\r\n     years at the mercy of his owner (Gardiner, _Commonwealth and\r\n     Protectorate_, small ed. iii, 309-10, _note_; iv, 111-13). Of\r\n     course the limitation of the term made the servitude all the more\r\n     severe (Lomas's note cited).\r\n\r\n     In the end, the Protector terrorised his own law courts as Charles\r\n     had never dared to do. See Clarendon, bk. xv, ed. Oxford, 1843, p.\r\n     862, and Hallam, ii, 253, 271, 272, _note_. Cromwell's language, as\r\n     recorded by Clarendon, would startle some of his admirers by its\r\n     indecency if they took the trouble to read the passage. Cp.\r\n     Vaughan, _Hist. of England under the Stuarts_, etc., p. 524 (citing\r\n     Whitelocke and Ludlow), as to the law courts. Vaughan overlooks the\r\n     selling of royalists as slaves.\r\n\r\nIt was small wonder that posterity came to canonise the king; for in\r\nterms even of the Roundhead principles of impeachment he was a political\r\nsaint in comparison with the \"usurper.\" And royalists might well imagine\r\nCromwell as haunted by remorse; for nothing short of the \"besotted\r\nfanaticism\" of which, as Hallam pronounces, he had sucked the dregs,\r\ncould keep him self-complacent over the retrospect of the Civil War when\r\nhe was governing by the major-generals, after failing to govern with\r\nfarcically packed Parliaments. His fanaticism was, of course, in the\r\nratio of his will-power, but each supported the other. The modern\r\nexaltation of his character, as against the earlier and rather saner\r\nhabit of crediting him with great powers, relatively high purposes, and\r\ngreat misdeeds,[1098] has tended to throw in the shade the blazing\r\nlesson of his career, which is that, like most of his colleagues, he had\r\nset out with no political insight or foresight whatever. His\r\nconscientious beginnings are so utterly at issue with his endings that\r\nit is indeed almost superfluous to condemn either--as superfluous as to\r\ndenounce the infatuation of Charles. But it is of importance to remember\r\nthat his very success as a Carlylean ruler only emphasises the failure\r\nof his original politics. He succeeded by way of repudiating nearly\r\nevery principle on behalf of which he had taken up arms. Even apart from\r\nthe invigorating spectacle of his executive genius,[1099] he may well\r\nstir our sympathy, which is more subtly and deeply exercised by his\r\ninner tragedy, by the deadliness of his success in the light of his\r\naims, than by the simpler ill-fortune of Charles. But as politicians our\r\nbusiness is not to divide our sympathies between the powerful pietist\r\nwho was forced to give the lie to his life to save it, and the weak liar\r\nwho lost his life because he was at bottom faithful to his life's creed.\r\nThe superiority of Cromwell in strength of will and in administrative\r\nfaculty is too glaring to need acknowledging; and the lesson that a\r\nstrong man can tyrannise grossly where a weak man cannot tyrannise\r\ntrivially, is not one that particularly needs pressing. What it is\r\nessential to note is that the course of events which forced and led\r\nCromwell into despotism was for the next generation a strong argument\r\nagainst free Parliamentary government.\r\n\r\nOur generation, proceeding mainly on the work of Carlyle, who never\r\nreally elucidates or even seeks to comprehend political and social\r\ndevelopments, has in large part lost sight of the fact that Cromwell was\r\nmore and more clearly becoming a military despot; and that with twenty\r\nmore years of life he might have established a new military and naval\r\nempire. Yet at the time of his death his financial position was that of\r\na military adventurer at his wits' end, and his unscrupulous attack on\r\nSpain was plainly planned by way of coming at money.[1100] Dr. Gardiner,\r\nwho has been the first English[1101] historian to handle the case with\r\ncomprehensive insight, rightly compares the position of Cromwell with\r\nthat of Napoleon. He was in fact just another sample of the recurrent\r\ntype of the military ruler establishing himself as despot on the ruins\r\nof faction. \"Except for four months ... the whole of the Protectorate\r\nwas a time either of war or of active preparation for war; and even\r\nduring those months the Protector was hesitating, not whether he should\r\nkeep the peace or not, but merely what enemy he should attack.\"[1102]\r\nFinally he made war on Spain, by the admission of the friendly\r\nhistorian, \"after the fashion of a midnight conspirator,\" deceiving the\r\nother side in order to gain a mean advantage.[1103] To such a policy\r\nthere was no limit in national conscience, any more than in his. He had\r\na standing army of 57,000 men, an immense force for the England of that\r\nday; his revenue stood at two millions and a quarter, nearly four times\r\nthe figure of twenty years before; and still he was in desperate\r\nfinancial straits, his outlays being nearly half a million in excess of\r\nthe income.[1104] The result was \"a war for material gains\"; and it\r\nconsists with all we know of history to say that with continued success\r\nin such undertakings during a lengthened life he would have won the mass\r\nof his countrymen to his allegiance.\r\n\r\nA few dates and details make the process dramatically clear. Admiral\r\nBlake won his first notable victory over Van Tromp in February, 1653;\r\nand in April Cromwell felt himself in a position to expel the\r\nrecalcitrant Parliament, though that had always specially favoured the\r\nnavy. In this act he had the general approval of the people;[1105] but\r\nhe took care to change some of the naval commanders.[1106] The next\r\nParliament was the nominated one called the \"Barebones,\" wherein none\r\nwere elected, and which went to pieces in the strife of its factions,\r\nsince even nomination could not secure concord among Puritans. Then came\r\nthe Parliament of 1654, elected from purged constituencies. From this\r\nwere excluded a hundred members who refused to sign an engagement not to\r\nalter the system in force; and finally the remnant was angrily\r\ndissolved, and military rule established under the major-generals. Yet\r\nagain, in 1656, driven by need of money, the Protector called another\r\npacked Parliament, from which he nevertheless lawlessly excluded 102\r\nelected members; and on their protesting there was a distinct increase\r\nof the already obvious public displeasure at such repeated acts of\r\ntyranny. This was in September; but in October came the news of\r\nStayner's capture of the Spanish treasure-ships; and in November the\r\ntreasure arrived--what the naval officers had left of it. On this the\r\nParliament promptly voted everything that its master asked for;[1107]\r\nnew taxes were laid to carry on the wanton war with Spain; and in\r\nJanuary 1657 it was proposed to offer him the Crown. Yet when, after a\r\nsix months' adjournment, that Parliament debated points on which he\r\nwanted submission, he furiously dissolved it as he had done its\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nSuch is the process of imperialism. With a few more years of ostensibly\r\nprofitable conquest, Cromwell, acclaimed and urged on in the career of\r\naggression by such different types of poet as Waller[1108] and\r\nMarvell,[1109] would as a matter of course have been made king, with the\r\nfinal consent of the army, and would have ruled as the crowned\r\nimperator. In that case his Puritanism, instead of putting any\r\nconscientious check on his egoism, would have fed it as Mohammed's faith\r\ndid his.[1110] Thus his early death was one of the important \"accidents\"\r\nof history.[1111]\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nAs it was, Cromwell lived only long enough to create an intellectual as\r\nwell as a conservative reaction. Surprise has been sometimes expressed,\r\nand must have been oftener felt, at the virtual High Toryism of the\r\ndoctrine of Hobbes,[1112] who was so little conservative in his general\r\nhabit of mind. The truth is that in 1651, or at least in 1660, the\r\nmonarchism of Hobbes was the ostensible Liberalism of the hour.\r\nParliamentarism had meant first sectarian tyranny, then anarchy, then\r\nmilitary despotism; and there was not the slightest prospect of a\r\nparliamentary government which should mean religious or intellectual\r\nfreedom all round. Hobbes would infallibly have been at least thrown\r\ninto prison by the Long Parliament if in its earlier time of power he\r\nhad published his remarks on the Pentateuch. They punished for much\r\nmilder exercises of critical opinion. A strong monarchy was become, from\r\nthe point of view of many enlightened men, positively the best available\r\nsecurity for general freedom of life, at a time when the spirit of\r\nreligion had multiplied tenfold the normal impulses to social tyranny\r\nand furnished the deepest channel of social ill-will compatible with\r\nnational unity. It lay in Christianity, as it lay earlier in Judaism, to\r\nbreed an intensity of religious strife such as the pagan world never\r\nknew. Various countries had seen sects arise and grapple with each other\r\non the score of this or that interpretation of the Hebrew sacred books,\r\nand men of conservative bias felt that they were face to face with\r\ninsane forces incompatible with a democratic system. Religious lore,\r\nabove all other learning, could make men more \"excellently foolish,\" as\r\nHobbes put it, than was possible to mere ignorance, making new and\r\nuncontrollable motives to disunion.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be assumed, indeed, that a revolution begun on any motive\r\nwhatever would have maintained itself at the then developed stage of\r\npolitical intelligence; for the English people, which constantly accuses\r\nothers of lack of faculty for union, had never shown itself any better\r\nfitted for rational compromise than the Irish, given conditions of equal\r\nstress. Scandinavian, German, Dutch, English--all the Teutonic sections\r\nalike had in all ages shown in the fullest degree the force of the\r\nprimary passions of self-assertion and mutual repulsion, cordially\r\nuniting only, if at all, for purposes of aggression. But in the case\r\nunder notice it was the religious passions that dug the channels of\r\nstrife; and they must be held to have added to the volume of blind\r\nemotion. Thus intensified, the principle had shown itself potent to\r\nwreck any commonwealth; and there remained only the choice between a\r\nusurper governing through an army and a \"legitimate\" monarch governing\r\nas of old by way of Parliament and a civil service. Parliament had been\r\nthe most offensive tyrant of all, for while making most parade of\r\nlegality it had been the most self-seeking,[1113] and perhaps even the\r\nleast respectable as regards its _personnel_. The Liberals of the\r\nlatter time had their cue given to them by the memorable Falkland, who,\r\ngrievedly \"ingeminating Peace, Peace,\" had recoiled from the intolerant\r\nPuritans, and sadly joined the intolerant Royalists. Macaulay's thrust\r\nat him for this,[1114] if technically just, was hardly seemly on the\r\ncritic's part, for Falkland represented exactly the temper of Macaulay's\r\nown politics. He was an ideal Whig of the later school--the very saint\r\nof moderation. Falkland had indeed special ground for withdrawal from\r\nthe Puritan party, in that he was convinced that Hampden and Pym had\r\ndeceived him as to the king's complicity in the Irish Rebellion and\r\nother matters. He had been \"persuaded to believe many things which he\r\nhad since found to be untrue.\"[1115] But in most things the Puritans\r\nmust have jarred on him.[1116] Where he had consented to go, albeit\r\ndeliberately to his death, as a Cavalier, his disciples might well\r\nbecome theoretic monarchists when the whole torrent of public opinion\r\nwent for the Restoration.\r\n\r\nOf course, the hope of social freedom was destined to frustration under\r\nthe restored monarchy just as before, since there was still no culture\r\nforce sufficient to purify the animal instinct of antagonism. The\r\nRestoration only meant that the Episcopalian dog was uppermost and the\r\nNonconformist under. But all the same, Commonwealth principles were\r\nprofoundly discredited; and it is notable that never since has\r\nRepublican principle ostensibly regained in England the stature it had\r\nreached in the hotbeds of the Great Rebellion and the Protectorate. The\r\nlong struggle against the king had educated many of the strivers into\r\ndemocratism, as did the later struggle of the American colonies against\r\nGeorge III. Even in the Parliament of Richard Cromwell, after Republican\r\nhopes had been so blasted, there were forty-seven avowed\r\nRepublicans,[1117] the remnant of the breed. With the return of the\r\nmonarchy it virtually disappears from English politics for a hundred and\r\nthirty years;[1118] when again it rises for a moment in the hot air of\r\nthe French Revolution, only to disappear again for nearly another\r\ncentury. It was after the Rebellion, and not before, that the dogma of\r\ndivine right became completely current orthodoxy in England.[1119]\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Republicanism meant the collapse of the class politics\r\nthat had grown up in the war and in the Commonwealth alongside of the\r\ncreed politics. The creed politics itself, when carried to the lengths\r\nof the doctrine of the Independents, meant a challenge to the political\r\nsystem; and among the more advanced reasoners of the period were some\r\nwho saw that to put down kingly tyranny was of little avail while class\r\ninequalities remained. The Long Parliament, though not going this\r\nlength, went far in the way of putting down some established abuses; and\r\nthere are many records of a more searching spirit of innovation. It is\r\nimportant to realise that alike under Charles I and Cromwell the\r\nParliaments tended to be partly composed of and ruled by the more\r\naudacious spirits of the time, simply because these had the advantage in\r\ndiscussion wherever they were. The incapacity for speech which in later\r\ntimes has made the Conservative party welcome adventurers as its\r\nmouthpieces meant the partial obliteration of the conservative class in\r\nthe early days of unorganised parliamentary strife; and Cromwell's own\r\nParliaments baffled him in virtue of their large elements of upstart\r\nintelligence. He himself, having entered the war from a mixture of\r\nmotives in which there was no idea of social reconstruction, was merely\r\nirritated by the ideals of the more radical agitators, which he could\r\nnot out-argue, but on which he promptly put his foot. It is true that in\r\nthe immense ferment set up by the Rebellion impracticable ideas\r\nabounded, and that they suggested risks of civil anarchy, even as the\r\nmultitude of sectaries threatened chaos in religion. We find indeed an\r\nexpress affirmation of anarchism in the literature of the period;[1120]\r\nand generally the English Revolution had in it most of the subversive\r\nelements which later evolved the French, the determining difference\r\nbeing that the English was not attacked from the outside. But there were\r\npractical plans also. Lilburne had a really constructive scheme of\r\npopular enfranchisement,[1121] which might have built up a democratic\r\nforce of resistance to royalism as such; but Cromwell, while ready to\r\noverthrow any part of the constitution that hampered him, would build up\r\nnothing in its place. He would have no alteration of the social\r\nstructure, save in so far as he must protect his Independents from the\r\nPresbyterians and Episcopalians alike. And of course, when his polity\r\nfell, the ideals of the independents of politics--who had represented\r\nonly a tribe of scattered intelligences, much fewer than the mere\r\nreligious sectaries, who were themselves but a vigorous\r\nminority--speedily disappeared from English affairs. The standards of\r\nthe average orthodox class became the standards of public life.\r\n\r\nOn the side of international relations, finally, Cromwell and the\r\nCommonwealth did nothing to improve politics. Commerce began to spread\r\nafresh; and commercial and racial jealousy, under the Puritan as later\r\nunder the Restoration rule, bred war with the Dutch, just as religious\r\nhatreds had made war between England and Spain. The final proof of\r\nCromwell's lack of political wisdom is given in his utterly fantastic\r\nscheme for a constitutional union of the English and Dutch republics, a\r\nscheme which could not have worked for a week. When this proposal was\r\ndeclined by the Dutch States-General, he seems to have been as ready as\r\nany filibuster in England to go to war with the States;[1122] and it is\r\nevident that the Navigation Act of 1651 was at once an act of revenge\r\nfor the insults put upon the English ambassadors by the Dutch Orangeist\r\npopulace, against the will of the Dutch Government, and a wanton effort\r\nto punish the States for declining the Protector's absurd\r\nproposals.[1123] The two Protestant republics thereupon grappled like\r\ntwo worrying dogs; and for their first ostensible victory the English\r\nParliament publicly thanked God as unctuously as for any of the\r\nvictories of the Civil War.[1124] In their hands and Cromwell's\r\ninternational politics sank at once to the normal levels of primitive\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Frederic Harrison (_Cromwell_, ch. xiii) glorifies Cromwell's\r\n     foreign policy on the score that it made England great in the eyes\r\n     of foreign countries. Exactly so might we eulogise the foreign\r\n     policy of Louis XIV or Philip II or Napoleon--so long as it\r\n     succeeded. Cromwell, up to the time when he began to scheme an\r\n     empire of naval aggression, simply aimed at a Protestant\r\n     combination as other rulers aimed at Catholic combinations. There\r\n     was nothing new in the idea; and it would have been astonishing if\r\n     he had _not_ maintained the naval power of the country. It was to\r\n     this very end that the luckless Charles imposed his ship-money,\r\n     which Hampden and his backers refused to pay. As regards home\r\n     politics, again, Mr. Harrison praises Cromwell for preserving order\r\n     with unprecedented success, making no allowance for the fact that\r\n     Cromwell was the first Englishman who governed through a standing\r\n     army, and making no attempt to refute Ludlow's statements (cited by\r\n     Hallam, ii, 251, _note_; cp. Vaughan, p. 524, _note_) as to the\r\n     gross tyranny of the major-generals, or to meet the charge against\r\n     Cromwell of selling scores of royalists into slavery at Barbadoes.\r\n     Mr. Harrison finally justifies Cromwell's policy in the main on the\r\n     score of \"necessity,\" despite the proverbial quotation. It was\r\n     exactly on the plea of necessity that Charles justified himself in\r\n     his day, when Cromwell joined in resisting him. Mr. Harrison again\r\n     extols the \"generosity\" and \"moral elevation\" of the intervention\r\n     for the Vaudois, when on the same page he has to admit the infamy\r\n     of the Cromwellian treatment of Ireland. He sees no incongruity in\r\n     Milton's emotion over the \"slaughtered saints\" of Protestantism,\r\n     while Catholic ecclesiastics were with his approval being slain\r\n     like dogs. Moral and social science must hold the balances more\r\n     evenly than this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6\r\n\r\nWhile thus showing that in his foreign relations in general he had no\r\nhigher principle than that which led him to protect the Protestant\r\nVaudois, Cromwell himself could not or would not tolerate Catholicism in\r\nEngland. What was immeasurably worse, he had put thousands of Irish\r\nCatholics to the sword, and reduced tens of thousands more to the life\r\nconditions of wild animals. His policy in Ireland, if judged by the\r\nstandards we apply to the rule of other men, must be pronounced one of\r\nblind brutality. He had helped to make a civil war in England because\r\nhis class was at times arbitrarily taxed, and had fears that its worship\r\nwould be interfered with; and in so doing he felt he had the support and\r\nsanction of Omnipotence. When it came to dealing with Irishmen who stood\r\nup for their race ideals and their religion, he acted as if for him\r\nprinciples of moral and religious right did not exist.[1125] His most\r\nferocious deeds he justified by reference to the Ulster massacre of\r\n1641, as if all Irishmen had been concerned in that, and as if the\r\nprevious English massacres had not been tenfold more bloody. Under his\r\nown Government, by the calculation of Sir William Petty, out of a\r\npopulation of 1,466,000, 616,000 had in eleven years perished by the\r\nsword, by plague, or by famine artificially produced. Of these, 504,000\r\nwere reckoned to be of Irish and 112,000 of English descent. And it was\r\nplanned to reduce the survivors to a life of utter destitution in\r\nConnaught and Clare. By the settlement of 1653, ten of the thirty-two\r\nIrish counties were allotted to the \"Adventurers\" who in 1641 had\r\nadvanced sums of money to aid in putting down the Irish Rebellion;\r\ntwelve were divided among Cromwell's soldiers; seven, with all the\r\ncities and corporations of the kingdom, were reserved for the\r\nCommonwealth; and three of the most barren counties--for the most part\r\nunreclaimed--were left for the natives. The settlement could not be\r\ncarried out as planned by the Government, and as evidently desired by\r\nFleetwood, the Lord Deputy, and many of the officers. The very greed of\r\nthe soldiery defeated the project of a \"universal transplantation,\" for\r\nthey were as eager for Irish labour as for Irish land.[1126] But the\r\nconfiscation of the land was carried out to the full, and multitudes\r\nwere forced into Connaught. The worst tyranny of Charles is thus as dust\r\nin the balance with Cromwell's expropriation of myriads of conquered\r\nIrish. For them he had neither the show of law nor the pretence of\r\nequity. They were treated as conquered races had been treated, not by\r\nthe Romans, who normally sought to absorb in their polity the peoples\r\nthey overcame, but by barbarians in their mutual wars, where the loser\r\nwas driven to the wilderness. Far from seeking to grapple as a statesman\r\nwith the problem of Irish disaffection, he struck into it like a\r\nBerserker, on the same inspiration of animal fury as took him into the\r\nbreach at Drogheda; and his or his officers' enactments, providing for\r\nthe slaughter of all natives who did not carry certificates of having\r\ntaken the anti-Royalist oath, are to be matched in history only with the\r\ntreatment of the conquered Slavs by the Christianising Germans in the\r\nDark Ages.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Gardiner and Mr. Harrison partly defend the massacre of\r\n     Drogheda as justified by the \"laws of war\" of the time. It is true\r\n     that for the period it was not very much out of the way. The\r\n     Royalist Manley, describing it, says only (_History of the\r\n     Rebellions_, 1691, p. 227): \"I would not condemn the promiscuous\r\n     slaughter of the Citizens and Souldiers, of Cruelty, because it\r\n     might be intended for Example and Terror to others, _if the like\r\n     Barbarity had not been committed elsewhere_.\" But Manley seems to\r\n     have forgotten the friars, whose slaughter neither laws of war nor\r\n     European custom exonerated. There were really no \"laws of war\" in\r\n     the case. Dr. Gardiner (_Student's History_, p. 562; _Commonwealth\r\n     and Protectorate_, small ed. i, 118) puts it that these laws \"left\r\n     garrisons refusing, as that of Drogheda had done, to surrender an\r\n     _indefensible_ post ... to the mercy or cruelty of the enemy.\" But\r\n     it is unwarrantable to call Drogheda an \"indefensible post.\" Dr.\r\n     Gardiner's thesis that any captured post, however hard to take, is\r\n     _ipso facto_ proved to have been indefensible, may be dismissed as\r\n     a very bad sophism. Elsewhere he himself puts it (p. 132, _note_)\r\n     that men \"defending a fortified town _after the defences had been\r\n     captured_\" were liable to be slain--a very different thing.\r\n     Drogheda contained 3,000 foot, mostly English, \"the flower of\r\n     Ormond's army,\" as Dr. Gardiner avows.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Harrison (_Oliver Cromwell_, p. 136) perhaps errs in saying\r\n     that its commander, Sir Arthur Aston, an officer of \"great name and\r\n     experience ... at that time made little doubt of defending it\r\n     against all the power of Cromwell.\" Cp. Gardiner, _Com. and Prot._,\r\n     small ed. i, 128, as to Aston's straits. It had, however, actually\r\n     resisted siege by the Catholics for three years, and it was only by\r\n     desperate efforts that Cromwell carried it. He went into the breach\r\n     with the forlorn hope, and he gave the order for slaughter, as he\r\n     himself admits, in the fury of action. The first order, be it\r\n     observed, was to slay all \"in arms _in the town_\"--this at a time\r\n     when men commonly carried arms in time of peace, and members wore\r\n     their swords in Parliament. It simply meant a massacre of the male\r\n     inhabitants. The garrison was not so slaughtered: when the\r\n     surrender of the garrison came, Cromwell's blood-lust was slaked,\r\n     and he spared all but every tenth man--for slavery in the\r\n     Barbadoes. Nor did his men merely slay those taken in arms. He\r\n     tells that \"their friars were knocked on the head promiscuously\";\r\n     and it is impossible wholly to refuse to believe the royalist\r\n     statement of the time, that men, women, and children were\r\n     indiscriminately slaughtered. Dr. Gardiner, on somewhat\r\n     insufficient grounds (_History of the Commonwealth_, i, 135, 136,\r\n     _note_), entirely rejects the personal testimony of the brother of\r\n     Anthony a Wood (Anthony's _Autobiography_, ed. Oxford, 1848, pp.\r\n     51, 52) as to Cromwell's men holding up children as shields when\r\n     pursuing some soldiers of the garrison who defended themselves. Dr.\r\n     Gardiner is himself in error in respect of one charge of\r\n     improbability which he brings against the narrative, as quoted by\r\n     himself. But in any case his own narrative, as he evidently feels,\r\n     shows the Cromwellian troops to have been sufficiently ferocious.\r\n     Quarter was promised, and then withheld (Gardiner, i, 117, _note_,\r\n     118); and by Dr. Gardiner's own showing the \"Parliamentary\" account\r\n     itself avows that the final surrender of the defenders on the\r\n     \"mount\" was obtained by sheer treachery--a fact which Dr. Gardiner\r\n     gloses even while showing it. A Puritan drunk with the lust of\r\n     battle is a beast like any other. Cromwell himself had to quiet his\r\n     conscience with his usual drug of religion. But if this act had\r\n     been done by Cavaliers or Catholics upon a Puritan garrison and\r\n     Independent priests, he and his party would have held it up to\r\n     horror for ever.\r\n\r\n     The only defence he could make was that this was vengeance for the\r\n     great Irish Massacre--that is to say, that he had shown he could be\r\n     as bloody as the Irish, who on their part had all the English\r\n     massacres of the previous generation to avenge--a circumstance\r\n     carefully ignored by clerical writers who still justify Cromwell in\r\n     the name of Christianity, as seeking to make future massacres\r\n     impossible. All the while, there was not the slightest pretence of\r\n     showing that the garrison of Drogheda had been concerned in the old\r\n     massacre. Compare, on this, the emphatic verdict of Dr. Gardiner,\r\n     _History of the Commonwealth_, i, 139. Mr. Harrison (p. 145) quotes\r\n     Cromwell's challenge to opponents to show any instance of a man\r\n     \"not in arms\" being put to death with impunity--this after he had\r\n     avowed the slaughter of all priests and chaplains! His general\r\n     assertion of the scrupulousness of his party was palpably false;\r\n     and it is idle to say that he must have believed it true. That\r\n     Ireton's Puritan troops slew numbers of disarmed and unarmed Irish\r\n     with brutal cruelty and treachery _against Ireton's reiterated\r\n     orders_, is shown by Dr. Gardiner; and he tells how Ireton hanged a\r\n     girl who tried to escape from Limerick (_Commonwealth_, ii, 48,\r\n     53). Is it then to be supposed that Cromwell's men were more humane\r\n     when he was hounding them on to massacre? As to the further\r\n     slaughter of natives, there stands the assertion of Father French\r\n     (_Narrative of the Earl of Clarendon's Settlement and Sale of\r\n     Ireland_, Dublin, rep. 1846, p. 86) that under the Proclamation\r\n     which commanded the soldiers to slay any men met on the highway\r\n     without a certificate of having \"taken the engagement\" abjuring the\r\n     monarchy, \"silly Peasants who out of Ignorance or want of care ...\r\n     left their tickets at home, were barbarously murdered.\" In the\r\n     circumstances the statement is only too credible.\r\n\r\n     There remains to be considered the old plea that the massacre of\r\n     Drogheda made an end of serious resistance, and so saved life. Thus\r\n     Carlyle: \"Wexford Storm followed (not by forethought, it would\r\n     seem, but by chance of war) in the same fashion; and there was no\r\n     other storm or slaughter needed in that country\" (_Cromwell_,\r\n     Comm. on Letter CV). This is one of Carlyle's innumerable\r\n     misstatements of fact. Even on his own view, the Wexford slaughter\r\n     had to follow that of Drogheda. But, as Gardiner shows, Cromwell's\r\n     bloodshed at Drogheda and Wexford, \"so far from sparing effusion of\r\n     blood,\" though \"successful at Ross and at a few lesser strongholds,\r\n     had only served to exasperate the garrisons of Duncannon, of\r\n     Kilkenny, and of Clonmel; and in his later movements Cromwell,\r\n     always prepared to accept the teaching of events(!), had discovered\r\n     that the way of clemency was the shortest road to conquest\" (_Com.\r\n     and Prot._ i, 157; cp. p. 137). The laudation here too is\r\n     characteristic; but it disposes of Carlyle's.\r\n\r\n     Carlyle would never be at pains enough to check his presuppositions\r\n     by the records. As Gardiner tells (p. 123, _note_), he denounces an\r\n     editor for printing a postscript in which Cromwell admitted the\r\n     slaughter of \"many inhabitants\" of Drogheda. This, said Carlyle,\r\n     had no authority in contemporary copies. \"It appears,\" writes Dr.\r\n     Gardiner, \"in the _official_ contemporary copy in _Letters from\r\n     Ireland_.\" What is more, the editor in question had given the\r\n     reference!\r\n\r\nThere are men who to-day will still applaud Cromwell because he quenched\r\nthe Irish trouble for the time in massacre and devastation; and others,\r\nblenching at the atrocity of the cure, speak of it with bated breath as\r\ndoing him discredit, while they bate nothing of their censure of the\r\narbitrariness of Charles. Others excuse all Puritan tyranny because of\r\nits \"sincerity,\" as if that plea would not exculpate Torquemada and\r\nAlva. The plain truth is that Cromwell in no way rose above the moral\r\nstandards of his generation in his dealings with those whom he was able\r\nto oppress. He found in his creed his absolution for every step to which\r\nblind instinct led him, in Ireland as in England; and it seems to be his\r\ndestiny to lead his admirers into the same sophistries--pious with a\r\ndifference--as served to keep him on good terms with his conscience\r\nafter suppressing an English Parliament or slaughtering an Irish\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\n     Take, for instance, the fashion in which D'Aubigne shuffles over\r\n     the Irish massacres, after quoting Cromwell's worst cant on the\r\n     subject: \"This extract will suffice. Cromwell acted in Ireland like\r\n     a great statesman, and the means he employed were those best\r\n     calculated promptly to restore order in that unhappy country. And\r\n     yet we cannot avoid regretting that a man--a Christian man--should\r\n     have been called to wage so terrible a war, and to show towards his\r\n     enemies _greater severity than had ever, perhaps, been exercised by\r\n     the pagan leaders of antiquity_. 'Blessed are the peacemakers: for\r\n     they shall be called the children of God'\" (_The Protector_, 3rd\r\n     ed. p. 159).\r\n\r\nIt is too much even to say, as a more scrupulous critic has done, that\r\nthe phenomenon of the Commonwealth represented a great attempt at a\r\nhigher life on the part of men nobler and wiser than their\r\ncontemporaries.[1127] It was simply the self-assertion of energetic men\r\nof whom some were in some respects ahead of their time; while the others\r\nwere as bad as their time, and in some respects rather behind it--men\r\nbewildered by fanaticism, and incapable of a consistent ethic, whose\r\nfailure was due as distinctly to their own intellectual vices as to\r\ntheir environment. No serious poetry of any age is more devoid of moral\r\nprinciple than the verses in which Marvell and Waller exult over the\r\nwanton attack on Spain, and kindle at the prospect of a future of\r\nunscrupulous conquest. Both men were religious; both as ready to sing of\r\n\"Divine Love\" as of human hate; and both in their degree were good types\r\nof the supporters of Cromwell. The leaders from the very outset are\r\nvisibly normal agitators, full of their own grievances, and as devoid of\r\nthe spirit of fellow-feeling, of concern for all-round righteousness, as\r\nany of the men they impeached. Their movement went so far as it did\r\nbecause, firstly, they were vigorous men resisting a weak man, and later\r\ntheir own natural progress to anarchy was checked by the self-assertion\r\nof the strongest of them all. Thus their and his service to progressive\r\npolitical science is purely negative. They showed once for all that an\r\nignorance guided by religious zeal and \"inspiration\" is more surely\r\ndoomed to disaster than the ignorance of mere primary animal instinct;\r\nand that of the many forms of political optimism, that of Christian\r\npietism is for the modern world certainly not the least pernicious. The\r\nPuritan name and ideal are in these days commonly associated with high\r\nprinciple and conscientiousness; and it is true that in the temper and\r\nthe tactic of the early revolutionary movement, despite much dark\r\nfanaticism, there was a certain masculine simplicity and sincerity not\r\noften matched in our politics since. But as the years went on,\r\nprinciples gave way, dragged down by fanaticism and egoism; and the\r\nPuritan temper, lacking light, bred deadly miasmas. Milton himself sinks\r\nfrom the level of the _Areopagitica_ to that of the _Eikonoklastes_, an\r\nignoble performance at the behest of the Government, who just then were\r\nsuppressing the freedom of the press.[1128] In strict historical truth\r\nthe Puritan name and the ideal must stand for utter failure to carry on\r\na free polity, in virtue of incapacity for rational association; for the\r\nstifling of some of the most precious forces of civilisation--the\r\nartistic; and further for the grafting on normal self-seeking of the\r\nnewer and subtler sin of solemn hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n     This holds good of the Puritan party as a whole. It is possible,\r\n     however, to take too low a view of the judgment of any given\r\n     section of it. Dr. Gardiner, for instance, somewhat strains the\r\n     case when he says (_Student's History_, p. 567) of the Barebone\r\n     Parliament: \"Unfortunately, these godly men [so styled by Cromwell]\r\n     were the most crotchety and impracticable set ever brought\r\n     together. The majority wanted to abolish the Court of Chancery\r\n     without providing a substitute, _and to abolish tithes without\r\n     providing any other means for the support of the clergy_.\" It seems\r\n     clear that it was the intention of the majority to provide an\r\n     equivalent for the tithes (see Vaughan, pp. 508, 509; cp. Hallam,\r\n     ii, 243, 244); and the remark as to the Court of Chancery appears\r\n     to miss the point. The case against that Court was that it\r\n     engrossed almost all suits, and yet intolerably delayed them; the\r\n     proposal was to let the other Courts do the work. Cp. Dr.\r\n     Gardiner's _Commonwealth and Protectorate_, ii, 241, 262; and as to\r\n     the tithes, i, 192; ii, 32, 240, 275, 276.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to show that either Cromwell or the men he used and\r\noverrode were, under trial, more conscientious than the average public\r\nmen of later times. Well-meaning he and many of them were; but, then,\r\nmost men are well-meaning up to their lights; the moral test for all is\r\nconsistency with professed principle under changing conditions. And\r\nhardly one was stedfastly true to the principles he put forward. They\r\nprevaricated under pressure--under harder pressure, no doubt--like other\r\npoliticians, with only the difference that they could cite random texts\r\nand \"the Lord\" in their justification. And inasmuch as their godly\r\nstrifes were as blind and as insoluble as those of any factions in\r\nhistory, they furnished no aid and no encouragement to posterity to\r\nattempt anew the great work of social regeneration. If that is ever to\r\nbe done, it must be with saner inspiration and better light than theirs.\r\nIt is time that, instead of extolling them as men of superior moral\r\nstature and inspiration, we now realise they brought to a bewildering\r\nproblem a vain enlightenment.\r\n\r\n     On this view, it may be noted, we have a sufficient explanation of\r\n     the dissimulations of which Cromwell was undoubtedly guilty.\r\n     Between the antiquated asperity of Villemain, who, while extolling\r\n     his capacity, charges him with _fourberie habituelle_ (_Hist. de\r\n     Cromwell_, 5e edit. p. 272), and the foregone condonations of\r\n     Carlyle, there is a mean of common sense. Cromwell was a man of\r\n     immense energy and practical capacity, but with no gift for\r\n     abstract thought, and spellbound by an incoherent creed.\r\n     Consequently he was bound to come to serious confusion when he had\r\n     to deal with tense complexities of conduct and violently competing\r\n     interests. Coming into desperate positions, for which his religion\r\n     was worse than no preparation, and in which it could not possibly\r\n     guide him aright, he must needs trip over the snares of diplomacy,\r\n     and do his equivocations worse than a more intellectual man would.\r\n     Cromwell's lying sounds the more offensive because of its constant\r\n     twang of pietism; but that was simply the dialect in which he had\r\n     been brought up. Had he lived in our day he would have been able to\r\n     prevaricate with a wider vocabulary, which makes a great\r\n     difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 7\r\n\r\nLest such a criticism should be suspected of prejudice, it may be well\r\nto note that a contemporary Doctor of Divinity has at some points\r\nexceeded it. It is Dr. Cunningham who argues that, in consequence of the\r\nPuritan bias leading to a cult of the Old Testament rather than the New,\r\nthere occurred under Puritan auspices \"a retrogression to a lower type\r\nof social morality, which showed itself both at home and abroad.\"[1129]\r\nHe traces Puritan influence specially \"(_a_) in degrading the condition\r\nof the labourer; (_b_) in reckless treatment of the native [= coloured]\r\nraces; (_c_) in the development of the worst forms of slavery.\"[1130]\r\nThe present writer, who rarely finds it necessary to oppose a Protestant\r\nclergyman on such an issue, is disposed to think the charge overdrawn,\r\nfor the following reasons: (1) The English treatment of Ireland was to\r\nthe full as cruel in the Elizabethan period, before Puritanism had gone\r\nfar, as under Cromwell; (2) the Catholic Spaniards in Mexico and Peru\r\nwere as cruel as the Puritan colonists in New England. It is true that\r\n\"in all the terrible story of the dealings of the white man with the\r\nsavage there are few more miserable instances of cold-blooded cruelty\r\nthan the wholesale destruction of the Pequod nation--men, women, and\r\nchildren--by the Puritan settlers\"[1131] of Connecticut. But when\r\nCatholics and pre-Puritan Protestants and Dutch Protestants act\r\nsimilarly, the case is not to be explained on Dr. Cunningham's theory.\r\nThe fallacy seems to lie in supposing that the New Testament has ever\r\nbeen a determinant in these matters. Mosheim confesses that in the wars\r\nof the Crusades the Christians were more ferocious than the\r\nSaracens;[1132] and Seneca was at least as humane as Paul.\r\n\r\nThere is distinct validity, on the other hand, in the charge that\r\nPuritanism worsened the life of the working classes, first by taking\r\naway their ecclesiastical holidays and gild-festivals, and finally by\r\ntaking all recreation out of their Sunday. The latter step may be\r\nregarded as the assertion of the economic interest of the Protestant\r\nclergy against the social needs of their flocks. It was not that the\r\nlabourers were well off before the Rebellion--here again we must guard\r\nagainst false impressions[1133]--but that \"Puritan ascendancy rendered\r\nthe lot of the labourer hopelessly dull.\"[1134] There is reason to\r\nbelieve, further, that the Stuart administration, applying the\r\nElizabethan Poor Law, took considerable pains to relieve distress,[1135]\r\nand that the Commonwealth, on the contrary, treated the lapsed mass\r\nwithout sympathy;[1136] and it is not unlikely that, as has been\r\nsuggested, this had something to do with the popular welcome given to\r\nthe Restoration.[1137] The conclusion is that \"neither the personal\r\ncharacter nor the political success of the Puritans need lead us to\r\nignore their baleful influence on society,\"[1138] which was, in the\r\nopinion of Arnold, despite his passion for their favourite literature,\r\nto imprison and turn the key upon the English spirit for two hundred\r\nyears. Here again the impartial naturalist will detect exaggeration, but\r\nmuch less than in the current hyperboles to the contrary.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the commercial and industrial drift of England, the resort\r\nto the mineral wealth[1139] that was to be the economic basis of later\r\ncommerce and empire, the pursuit of capitalistic manufacture, the\r\nbuilding up of a class living on interest as the privileged class of the\r\npast had lived on land monopoly--all went on under Puritanism as under\r\nCatholicism,[1140] Anglicanism, Calvinism, Lutheranism. The early\r\nPuritans, taking up the Catholic tradition, denounced usury; but the\r\nclergy of industrial and burgher-ruled States, beginning with Calvin,\r\nperforce receded from that veto.[1141] Even under Elizabeth there was a\r\ngood deal of banking,[1142] and under Cromwell English merchants and\r\nmoney-dealers had learned all the lessons the Dutch could teach them,\r\nweighing the Protector's borrowing credit in the scales of the market as\r\nthey would any other. The spirit of pitiless commercial competition\r\nflourished alike under Roundhead and Cavalier,[1143] save in so far as\r\nit was manacled by invidious monopolies; the lust of \"empire\" was as\r\nkeen among the middle class in Cromwell's day as in Elizabeth's and our\r\nown; and even the lot of the workers began to approximate to its modern\r\naspect through the greater facility of transfer[1144] which followed on\r\nthe old rigidity of feudal law and medieval usage. The industrial age\r\nwas coming to birth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1089: Even on this side the king was not fortunate. It would\r\nperhaps do him little harm that \"he spoke and behaved with indelicacy to\r\nladies in public\" (Hallam, citing Milton's _Defensio_ and Warburton's\r\n_Notes on Clarendon_, vii. 626); but his frigidity and haughtiness were\r\nmore serious matters. He actually caned Vane for entering a room in the\r\npalace reserved for persons of higher rank (_id._, citing Carte's\r\n_Ormond_, i, 356). In the next reign people contrasted his aloofness\r\nwith his son's accessibility (see _Pepys' Diary_, _passim_). Hallam sums\r\nup that \"he had in truth none who loved him, till his misfortunes\r\nsoftened his temper, and excited sympathy\" (10th ed. ii, 226).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1090: That is, in England. In Scotland they did. It is quite\r\nclear that the Scotch disaffection dated from Charles's proposal and\r\nattempt, at the very outset of his reign, to recover the tithes that had\r\nbeen appropriated by the nobility. (Compare Burton, _History of\r\nScotland_, v, 270; vi. 45, 75, 77-79, 84, 225; Burnet, _Own Time_, bk.\r\ni, ed. 1838, p. 11; Gardiner, _History of England, 1603-1642_, vii, 278;\r\nLaing, _History of Scotland_, 2nd ed. iii, 91; Sir James Balfour,\r\n_Annals of the Stuart Kings_, ii, 128; Sir Roger Manley, _History of the\r\nRebellions_, 1691. p. 7.) This scheme, though dropped, was naturally\r\nnever renounced in the king's counsels; and the Church riots of 1637,\r\nwhich are specially embalmed in the egregious myth of Jenny Geddes, are\r\nexplicitly recorded to have been planned by outsiders. See Guthry's\r\n_Memoirs_, 2nd ed. 1747, p. 23. Burton (vi, 153) rejects this testimony\r\non astonishingly fallacious grounds. Of course, the resentment of\r\nEnglish interference with Scotch affairs counted for a great deal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1091: It is to be remembered, as explaining Charles's\r\nsacrifice of Strafford, that the latter was generally detested even at\r\nCourt (Hallam, ii, 108-10). And at the outset the general hatred of the\r\nnobility to Laud was the great cause of Charles's weakness (_id._ ii,\r\n86). In France, soon afterwards, the aristocratic hatred to Mazarin set\r\nup the civil war of the Fronde.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1092: Hallam, _Const.

He had cause to be so diffident. Hallam more than once\r\nobserves how bad his judgment generally was.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1098: It is an error to assert, as is often done, that before\r\nCarlyle's panegyric the normal English estimate of Cromwell was utterly\r\nhostile.

It has been held that had\r\nRichard Cromwell had the energy of his father he might easily have\r\nmaintained his position, so quietly was his accession at first accepted;\r\nand no doubt his irresolution made much of the difference between\r\nsuccess and failure; but nothing can be clearer than the leaning of the\r\nmass of the people to the \"lawful\" dynasty. It is a proof of Cromwell's\r\ncomplete dislocation of the old state of touch between the official\r\nclasses and the public,[1145] that the army leaders had no misgivings\r\nwhen they commenced to intrigue against Richard, and that Monk was so\r\nslow to declare for the king when the event showed how immense was the\r\nroyalist preponderance. During the Rebellion, London, led by the\r\nPuritans, had dominated the country; under the Protectorate, town and\r\ncountry were alike dominated by a selected official and military class,\r\nrepresenting a minority with military force to impose its rule. As soon\r\nas this class began to disrupt in factions, the released play of common\r\nsentiment began to carry all forward on a broad tide towards a\r\nRestoration; the only footing on which the English people could yet\r\nunite being one of tradition and superstition. The anarchy of a State\r\nstill unfitted for republican government had before brought about the\r\nProtectorate: it now led back to the monarchy. And that the new monarchy\r\ndid not become as absolute as the contemporary rule of Louis XIV was\r\nsolely owing to the accident of the later adhesion of the restored\r\ndynasty to the Church of Rome, which the mass of the people feared more\r\nthan they did even the prospect of another Civil War. It was the memory\r\nof the Fronde that enabled Louis to override the remains of the French\r\nconstitution and set up an autocracy; and the same force was now at\r\nwork in England. It was the memory of the Civil War that made the\r\npeople so much more forbearing with the new king, when his private\r\nadhesion to the Catholic Church became generally suspected,[1146] than\r\ntheir fathers had been with his father. By temperament and from\r\nexperience they were disposed to do anything for the throne; but the\r\ngeneral fear of Popery on the one hand, and the special royalist\r\naversion to the Puritan sects on the other, plunged the State into a new\r\nferment of ecclesiastical politics, the strifes of which so far absorbed\r\nthe general energy that ill-luck in the commercial wars with Holland\r\nseems to have been almost a necessary result, even had the king ruled\r\nwell. Not that the generation of Charles II was a whit less bent on\r\ndominion and acquisition than the decade of the Protectorate.\r\n\r\nIn this new situation, under a king too little devoted to his trade to\r\nchoose really sagacious courses, but too shrewd to ruin himself, occur\r\nthe beginnings of parliamentary statesmanship, in the modern sense of\r\ngovernment in harmony with the Crown. The powerful administration of\r\nStrafford had been a matter of helping the Crown to resist Parliament.\r\nThe very capable though unforeseeing statesmanship of the Pyms and\r\nHampdens of the Long Parliament, again, was a matter of resisting the\r\nCrown; and with Shaftesbury such resistance recurred; but the indolence\r\nof the king, joined with his sense of the dangers of the old\r\nfavouritism, gave rise to the principle of Ministerial Government before\r\npartisan Cabinets had come into existence. Clarendon had in him much of\r\nthe constitutionalist temper. Shaftesbury, however, was better qualified\r\nboth by training and parts for the task of statesmanship in a stormy and\r\nunscrupulous generation. Read dispassionately, his story is seen to be\r\nin the main what his careful vindicator would make it--that of a man of\r\naverage moral quality, with exceptional energy and resource. The legend\r\nof his wickedness[1147] is somewhat puzzling, in view of his staunch\r\nhostility to Romanism, and of his political superiority to the famous\r\nDeist statesman of the next generation, Bolingbroke, who has been so\r\nlittle blackened in comparison. A reasonable explanation is that\r\nShaftesbury was damned by the Church for resisting the king, while\r\nBolingbroke's services to the Church covered his multitude of sins. But\r\nthe idle rumours of Shaftesbury's debauchery[1148] apparently damaged\r\nhim with the Protestant Dissenters, and his wickedly reckless policy\r\nover the Popish Plot might easily secure him a share in the infamy which\r\nis the sole association of the name of Titus Oates. Here also, however,\r\nhe has been calumniated. Burnet, though plainly disliking him, says\r\nnothing of debauchery in his life, and declined to believe, when Charles\r\nsuggested it, that he had any part in trumping up the falsehoods about\r\nthe Plot.[1149]\r\n\r\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that Shaftesbury honestly believed\r\nthere was a great danger of the re-establishment of Popery, and it is\r\nnot at all improbable that he credited some of the tales told, as Lord\r\nRussell solemnly testified at the scaffold that he for his part had\r\ndone. To acquit Russell and criminate Shaftesbury is possible only to\r\nthose who have made up their minds before trying the case. It is\r\npractically certain, moreover, that some vague Catholic plotting really\r\ndid take place;[1150] and in the then posture of affairs nothing was\r\nmore likely. Shaftesbury, like the other capable statesmen of the\r\nRestoration, was in favour of toleration of the Dissenters; but like all\r\nother Protestant statesmen of the age, he thought it impossible to\r\ntolerate Catholicism. Nor can it well be doubted that had Charles or\r\nJames been able to establish the Roman system, it would have gone hard\r\nwith Protestantism. It is true that the only exhibition thus far of the\r\nspirit of tolerance in Protestant and Catholic affairs in France and\r\nEngland had been on the part of Richelieu towards the Huguenots,\r\nthemselves intensely intolerant; but it could not reasonably be supposed\r\nthat an English Catholic king or statesman, once well fixed in power,\r\nwould have the wisdom or forbearance of Richelieu. The two systems, in\r\nfine, aimed at each other's annihilation; and Shaftesbury simply acted,\r\npolitically that is, as the men of the First Rebellion would have done\r\nin similar circumstances. Instead of dismissing him as a mere\r\nscoundrel, we are led to realise how imperfectly moralised were all the\r\nmen of his age in matters of religion and racial enmity. The friend of\r\nLocke can hardly have been a rascal.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, he was admitted even by the malicious and declamatory\r\nDryden to have been a just Chancellor; it is proved that he opposed the\r\nStop of the Exchequer; and he sharply resisted the rapacity of the royal\r\nconcubines. In his earlier policy towards Holland he conformed odiously\r\nenough to the ordinary moral standard of the time[1151] in politics, a\r\nstandard little improved upon in the time of Palmerston, and not\r\ndiscarded by those Englishmen who continue to talk of Russia as\r\nEngland's natural enemy, or by those who speak of Germany as a trade\r\nrival that must be fought to a finish. His changes of side between the\r\noutbreak of the Rebellion and his death, while showing the moral and\r\nintellectual instability of the period, were not dishonourable, and are\r\nnot for a moment to be compared with those of Dryden, most unstable of\r\nall men of genius, whose unscrupulous but admirably artistic portrait of\r\nthe statesman has doubtless gone far to keep Shaftesbury's name in\r\ndisesteem. It may be, again, that his sufficient wealth takes away\r\nsomewhat from the merit of his steadfast refusal of French bribes; but\r\nthe fact should be kept in mind,[1152] as against the other fact that\r\nnot only the king and some of the Opposition but Algernon Sidney took\r\nthem.[1153] On the whole, Shaftesbury was the most tolerable of the\r\nMinisters of his day, though his animus against Catholicism made him\r\ngrossly unscrupulous toward individual Catholics; and his miscalculation\r\nof possibilities, in clinging to the scheme of giving Monmouth the\r\nsuccession, finally wrecked his career. He had almost no alternative,\r\nplaced and principled as he was, save to call in the Prince of Orange;\r\nand this would really have been at that moment no more feasible a course\r\nthan it was to declare Monmouth the heir, besides being more hazardous,\r\nin that William was visibly less easy to lead. Of Shaftesbury, Burnet\r\nadmits that \"his strength lay in the knowledge of England\"; and when he\r\ntook a fatal course, it was because the whole situation was desperate.\r\nHis fall measures not so much the capacity of Charles as the force which\r\nthe royalist superstition had gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2\r\n\r\nThis growth can be traced in the clerical literature of the time. The\r\nconception of a \"divine right\" inhering in kings by heredity--a\r\nconception arising naturally as part of the general ethic of feudal\r\ninheritance--had been emphasised on the Protestant side in England[1154]\r\nby way of express resistance to the Papacy, which from the time of\r\nGregory VII had been wont in its strifes with emperors and kings to deny\r\ntheir divine right and to assert its own, formally founding the latter,\r\nhowever, on the \"natural\" right inherent in masses of men to choose\r\ntheir own rulers, even as the citizens of Rome had been wont to elect\r\nthe Popes.[1155] The total effect of the English Rebellion was to give\r\nan immense stimulus to the high monarchic view, not now as against the\r\nPapacy, but as against Parliament. When the learned Usher drew up at the\r\nrequest of Charles I his treatise[1156] on _The Power communicated by\r\nGod to the Prince, and the Obedience required of the Subject_, he\r\nproceeded almost wholly on arguments from the Scriptures and the\r\nFathers; not that there were not already many deliverances from modern\r\nauthorities on the point, but that these evidently had not entered into\r\nthe ordinary stock of opinion. On the papal side, from Thomas\r\nAquinas[1157] onwards, the negative view had been carefully set forth,\r\nnot merely as a papal claim, but also as an obvious affirmation of the\r\nancient \"law of nature.\" Thus the Spanish Jesuit Suarez (1548-1617) had\r\nin his _Tractatus de Legibus_, while deriving all law from the will of\r\nGod, expressly rejected the doctrine that the power of rule inheres by\r\nsuccession in single princes. Such power, he declared, \"by its very\r\nnature, belongs to no one man, but to a multitude of men,\"[1158] adding\r\na refutation of the patriarchal theory which \"might have caused our\r\nEnglish divines to blush before the Jesuit of Granada.\"[1159] At the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, again, while leading Englishmen\r\nwere affirming divine right, the German Protestant Althusius, Professor\r\nof Law at Herborn, publishing his _Politica methodice digesta_ (1603),\r\ndeclares in a dedication to the States of Friesland that the supreme\r\npower lies in the people.[1160] Hooker, too, had stamped the principle\r\nof \"consent\" with his authority, very much as did Suarez.[1161]\r\n\r\nBut the compiler of _The History of Passive Obedience since the\r\nReformation_,[1162] after showing that the tenet[1163] had been held by\r\ndozens of Protestant divines and jurists after the Reformation, and even\r\nstrongly affirmed by Nonconformists, is able to cite nearly as many\r\nassertions of it in the reign of Charles II as in the whole preceding\r\nperiod. The clergy were, indeed, able to show that the principle of\r\nnon-resistance had been a common doctrine up to the Great Rebellion;\r\nand, though the contrary view was on the whole more common,[1164] it\r\nwell illustrates the instinctive character of political movement that\r\nthe democratic doctrine had followed the course of action step by step,\r\nand not preceded it. There had been resistance before the right to\r\nresist was formulated in the schools. And Bishop Guthry records that at\r\nthe General Assembly in Edinburgh in January, 1645, \"everyone had in his\r\nhand that book lately published by Mr. Samuel Rutherford, entitled _Lex\r\nRex_, which was stuffed with positions that in the time of peace and\r\norder would have been judged damnable treasons; yet were now so idolised\r\nthat, whereas in the beginning of the work Buchanan's treatise, _De Jure\r\nRegni apud Scotos_, was looked upon as an oracle, this coming forth, it\r\nwas slighted as not anti-monarchical enough, and Rutherford's _Lex Rex_\r\nonly thought authentic.\"[1165] So Milton's answer to Salmasius,\r\nvindicating the right of rebellion as inherent in freemen, marks the\r\nhigh tide of feeling that sustained the foremost regicides. But in the\r\nnature of the case the feeling swung as far the other way when they had\r\ntouched their extreme limit of action; and when the royalist cause came\r\nin the ascendant, the monarchical principle was perhaps more\r\npassionately cherished in England than in any of the other European\r\nStates.[1166] How it normally worked may be seen in Dryden's sycophantic\r\ndedication[1167] of his _All for Love_ to Lord Danby (1678), sinking as\r\nit does to the extravagant baseness of the declaration that \"every\r\nremonstrance of private men has the seed of treason in it.\" It was in\r\nthis very year that Charles and Danby made the secret treaty with\r\nFrance, the revelation of which by Louis soon afterwards brought Danby\r\nto the Tower; and Danby it was who three years before carried through\r\nthe House of Lords a bill to make all placemen declare on oath that they\r\nconsidered all resistance to the king unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe handful of remaining republicans and political Liberals, appealing\r\nas they did to tradition in their treatises against the traditional\r\npleadings of the Churchmen and royalists, could have no appreciable\r\ninfluence on the public, because the mere spirit of tradition, when not\r\nappealed to as the sanction of a living movement of resistance, must\r\nneeds make for passivity. Algernon Sidney's posthumous folio on\r\nGovernment in answer to Filmer's _Patriarcha_, arguing the question of\r\nself-government _versus_ divine right, and going over all the ground\r\nfrom Nimrod downwards, point by point, is a far greater performance than\r\nFilmer's; and Locke in turn brought a still greater power of analysis to\r\nbear on the same refutation; but it is easy to see that Filmer's is the\r\nmore readable book, and that with its straightforward dogmatism it would\r\nmost readily convince the average Englishman. Nor was the philosophy all\r\non one side, though Filmer has ten absurdities for the other's one, and\r\nwas so unguarded as to commit himself to the doctrine that the\r\npossession of power gives divine right, no matter how come by. Sidney\r\nhimself always argued that \"Vertue\" entitled men to superior power; and\r\nthough he might in practice have contended that the choice of the\r\nvirtuous should be made by the people, his proposition pointed rather\r\nplainly back to Cromwell, acclaimed by Milton as the worthiest to bear\r\nrule. And to be governed by a military autocrat, however virtuous and\r\ncapable, was as little to the taste of that generation as it was to the\r\ntaste of Carlyle's. Even a clergyman could see that the political\r\nproblem was really one of the practical adjustment of crude conflicting\r\ninterests, and that there could easily be as much friction under a\r\nvirtuous monarch as under a dissolute one. The conscientiousness of the\r\nfirst Charles had wrought ruin, where the vicious indolence of the\r\nsecond steered safely.\r\n\r\nAs Filmer and Sidney, besides, really agreed in awarding \"the tools to\r\nhim who could handle them,\" and as the most pressing practical need was\r\nto avoid civil war, the solution for most people was the more clearly a\r\n\"loyal\" submission to the reigning house; and no amount of abstract\r\ndemonstration of the right of self-government could have hindered the\r\nhabit of submission from eating deeper and deeper into the national\r\ncharacter if it were not for the convulsion which changed the dynasty\r\nand set up a deep division of \"loyalties,\" keeping each other in check.\r\nIn the strict sense of the term there was no class strife, no democratic\r\nmovement, no democratic interest; indeed, no ideal of public interest as\r\nthe greatest good of the whole. Thus Harrington's _Oceana_, with its\r\nscheme of \"an equal Commonwealth, a Government established upon an equal\r\nAgrarian, arising into the Superstructures of three Orders, the Senat\r\ndebating and proposing, the People resolving, and the Magistracy\r\nexecuting by an equal Rotation through the suffrage of the People given\r\nby the Ballot\"[1168]--this conception, later pronounced by Hume \"the\r\nonly valuable model of a commonwealth that has yet been offered to the\r\npublic,\"[1169] although the same critic exposed its weakness--was in\r\nfact as wholly beside the case as the principle of the Second Coming. No\r\nman desired the proposed ideal; and the very irrelevance of the\r\nsystematic treatises strengthened the case for use and wont. The\r\npolitical discussions, being thus mostly in the air, could serve only to\r\nprepare leading men to act on certain principles should events forcibly\r\nlead up to new action. But the existing restraints on freedom did not\r\nsupply sufficient grievance to breed action. The dissenters themselves\r\nwere almost entirely resigned to their ostracism; and the preponderance\r\nof the Church and the Tory party was complete.\r\n\r\nLuckily the political fanaticism of Charles I reappeared in his son\r\nJames; and that king's determination to re-establish in his realm the\r\nChurch of his devotion served to break a spell that nothing else could\r\nhave shattered.[1170] The very Church which had been assuring him of his\r\nirresistibility, having to choose between its own continuance and his,\r\nhad perforce to desert him; and the old panic fear of Popery, fed by the\r\nspectacle of Jeffreys' Bloody Assize, swept away the monarch who had\r\naroused it. He would have been an energetic king; his naval Memoirs\r\nexhibit zeal and application to work; and he had so much of rational\r\nhumanity in him that in Scotland he pointed out to the popes of\r\nPresbyterianism how irrational as well as merciless was their treatment\r\nof sexual frailty. But his own fanaticism carried him athwart the\r\nsuperstition which would have sufficed to make him a secure despot in\r\nall other matters; and when the spirit of freedom seemed dying out in\r\nall forms save that of sectarian zealotry, his assault on that brought\r\nabout the convulsion which gave it fresh chances of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3\r\n\r\nWhile practical politics was thus becoming more and more of a stupid war\r\nof ecclesiastical prejudices, in which the shiftiest came best off, and\r\neven theoretic politics ran to a vain disputation on the purposes of God\r\ntowards Adam, some of the best intelligence of the nation, happily, was\r\nat work on more fruitful lines. The dire results of the principles which\r\nhad made for union and strife of late years, drove thoughtful men back\r\non a ground of union which did not seem to breed a correlative\r\nmalignity.[1171] It was in 1660, the year of the Restoration, that the\r\nRoyal Society was constituted; but its real beginnings lay in the first\r\nyears of peace under Cromwell, when, as Sprat records, a \"candid,\r\nunpassionate company\" began to meet at Oxford in the lodgings of Dr.\r\nWilkins, of Wadham College,[1172] to discuss questions of natural fact.\r\n\"The University had, at the time, many Members of its own, who had begun\r\na free way of reasoning; and was also frequented by some gentlemen, of\r\nPhilosophical Minds, whom the misfortunes of the Kingdom, and the\r\nsecurity and ease of a retirement amongst Gowns-men, had drawn\r\nthither.\"[1173] In constituting the Society, the associates \"freely\r\nadmitted men of different religions, countries, and professions of\r\nlife,\" taking credit to themselves for admitting an intellectual\r\nshopkeeper, though \"the far greater number are Gentlemen, free, and\r\nunconfined.\"[1174] Above all things they shunned sectarian and party\r\nfeeling. \"Their first purpose was no more then onely the satisfaction of\r\nbreathing a freer air, and of conversing in quiet one with another,\r\nwithout being ingag'd in the passions and madness of that dismal\r\nAge;\"[1175] and when they formally incorporated themselves it was\r\nexpressly to discuss \"things and not words.\"\r\n\r\n     It is noteworthy that the French Academy, which gave the immediate\r\n     suggestion for the constitution of the English Royal Society,\r\n     contained almost no authors save belletrists and ecclesiastics. In\r\n     the list of members down to 1671 (_Relation_ cited, p. 336), I find\r\n     no writer on science save De la Chambre, the King's physician. And\r\n     the first important undertaking of the Academy (projected about\r\n     1637) was a _Dictionary_. Sprat (p. 56) suggests that the Royal\r\n     Society has usefully influenced the Academy in the direction of the\r\n     study of things rather than words. (Compare the avowed literary\r\n     ideal of the authors of the _Relation_, p. 373.) But although the\r\n     French group from the first tended mainly to literary pursuits,\r\n     they too aimed at a \"free way of reasoning,\" \"et de ce premier age\r\n     de l'Academie, ils en parlent comme d'un age d'or, durant lequel\r\n     avec toute l'innocence et toute la _liberte_ des premiers siecles,\r\n     sans bruit, et sans pompe, et sans autres loix que celles de\r\n     l'amitie, ils goutoient ensemble tout ce que la societe des\r\n     esprits, et la vie raisonnable, ont de plus doux et de plus\r\n     charmant\" (_Relation_, p. 7).\r\n\r\n     And even while Sprat was writing, the French were making up their\r\n     scientific leeway. In 1664-65 there was published in English a\r\n     translation of _A General Collection of Discourses of the Virtuosi\r\n     of France upon Questions of all Sorts of Philosophy and other_\r\n     (sic) _Natural Knowledge made in the Assembly of the_ Beaux Esprits\r\n     _at_ Paris, _by the most Ingenious Persons of that Nation_ (2 vols.\r\n     sm. folio), wherein, though the scientific discussions are\r\n     distinctly amateurish, there are many speculations likely to\r\n     stimulate both French and English experiment. There is indeed\r\n     little to choose in point of solidity between the early themes of\r\n     the English Royal Society and those of the French Academy. On the\r\n     other hand, the French Government specially promoted exact study.\r\n     In 1666 Colbert established the _Academie Royale des Sciences_, for\r\n     the promotion of Geometry, Astronomy, Physics, and Chemistry,\r\n     building a laboratory and an observatory, and inviting to France\r\n     Cassini and Huygens (Life of Colbert by Bernard, in ed. of\r\n     Colbert's _Last Testament_, 1695). Colbert further founded the\r\n     _Academie Royale d'Architecture_ in 1671; and had set up what came\r\n     to be the _Academie des Inscriptions_ in his own house. All three\r\n     bodies did excellent work. (See the acknowledgment, as regards\r\n     science, in Lawrence's _Lectures on Comparative Anatomy_, etc.,\r\n     1819, p. 13.) In France, besides, the philosophy and science of\r\n     Descartes made way from the first, and it was his works that first\r\n     gave Locke \"a relish for philosophical things.\" On the other hand,\r\n     Sprat, who was not without an eye to literature, and made a\r\n     reputation by his style, acutely notes (p. 42) that \"in the Wars\r\n     themselves (which is a time wherein all Languages use, if ever, to\r\n     increase by extraordinary degrees, for in such busie and active\r\n     times there arise more new thoughts of some men, which must be\r\n     signifi'd and varied by new expressions)\" the English speech\r\n     \"received many fantastical terms ... and with all it was enlarg'd\r\n     by many sound and necessary Forms and Idioms which it before\r\n     wanted\"; and he proposes an authoritative dictionary on the lines\r\n     of the French project.\r\n\r\nThe English naturalists would have nothing to do with theology, \"these\r\ntwo subjects, God and the Soul, being only forborn.\"[1176] Reasoning\r\nfrom the development of military faculty in the Civil War, they decided\r\nthat \"greater things are produced by the free way than the\r\nformal\"[1177]--a principle already put forth by Renaudot, in the preface\r\nto the reports of the French Academy, as the guide of their procedure.\r\nBy attending solely to results and questions of concrete fact, the\r\ninquirers were \"not only free from Faction, but from the very causes and\r\nbeginnings of it\";[1178] and in the language of the time they held that\r\n\"by this means there was a race of young Men provided against the next\r\nAge, whose minds receiving from them their just Impressions of sober and\r\ngenerous knowledge, were invincibly arm'd against all the inchantments\r\nof Enthusiasm\"[1179]--that is, of religious fanaticism. And with this\r\nrecoil from fanaticism there went the stirring and energetic curiosity\r\nof people habituated to action by years of war, and needing some new\r\nexcitement to replace the old. While many turned to debauchery, others\r\ntook to \"experiment.\"[1180] Says Sprat:--\r\n\r\n     \"The late times of Civil War and confusion, to make some\r\n     recompense for their infinite calamities, brought this advantage\r\n     with them, that they stirr'd up men's minds from long ease and a\r\n     lazy rest, and made them active, industrious, and inquisitive: it\r\n     being the usual benefit that follows upon Tempests and Thunders in\r\n     the State, as well as in the skie, that they purifie and cleer the\r\n     Air which they disturb. But now, since the King's return, the\r\n     blindness of the former Age and the miseries of this last are\r\n     vanish'd away: now men are generally weary of the Relicks of\r\n     Antiquity, and satiated with Religious Disputes; now not only the\r\n     eyes of men but their hands are open, and prepar'd to labour; Now\r\n     there is a universal desire and appetite after Knowledge, after the\r\n     peaceable, the fruitful, nourishing knowledge; and not after that\r\n     of antient Sects, which only yielded hard indigestible arguments,\r\n     or sharp contentions, instead of food: which when the minds of men\r\n     requir'd bread, gave them only a stone, and for fish a\r\n     serpent.\"[1181]\r\n\r\nHere too, then, there was reaction. It could not suffice to lift the\r\nplane of national life, which was determined by the general conditions\r\nand the general culture; nor did it alter the predominance of _belles\r\nlettres_ in the reading of the educated; but it served to sow in that\r\nlife the seed of science, destined to work through the centuries a\r\ngradual transformation of activity and thought which should make\r\nimpossible the old political strifes and generate new. Out of experiment\r\ncame invention, machinery, theory, new scepticism, rationalism,\r\ndemocracy. It is difficult to measure, but not easy to over-estimate,\r\nthe gain to intellectual life from even a partial discrediting of the\r\nold preoccupation with theology, which in the centuries between Luther\r\nand Spinoza stood for an \"expense of spirit\" that is depressing to think\r\nof. Down even to our own day, the waste of labour and learning\r\ncontinues; but from the time when two-thirds of Europe had been agonised\r\nby wars set up or stimulated by theological disputes, the balance begins\r\nto lean towards saner things. The second generation after that in which\r\nthere arose a \"free way of reasoning\"[1182] saw the beginnings of\r\n\"Freethinking\" in those religious problems which were for the present\r\nlaid aside, and the foundation of a new experiential philosophy. New and\r\ngreat reactions against these were to come; reactions of endowed\r\nclericalism, of popular sloth, of new \"enthusiasm\" generated in new\r\nundergrowths of ignorance, of recoil from terrific democratic\r\nrevolution. But the new principle was to persist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, at this time of day, to accept as a scientific product\r\nthe confused theory of constitutionalism which gradually grew up in\r\nEnglish politics from William the Third onwards. The theory in all its\r\nforms is in logic so invertebrate, and in morals so far from satisfying\r\nany fairly developed sense of political justice, that we are apt to\r\ndismiss it in derision. In so far, indeed, as it proceeds on a\r\nformulation of the \"social contract\" it is always severely handled by\r\nthe school of Sir Henry Maine, which here represents the anxiety of the\r\nupper classes since the French Revolution to find some semblance of\r\nrational answer to the moral plea that all men are entitled to political\r\nenfranchisement and social help on the simple ground of reciprocity,\r\nsupposed to be canonised for Christians in the \"Golden Rule.\" Locke, of\r\ncourse, was not thinking of the working mass when he wrote his Letters\r\non Government, any more than when he helped to draw up a constitution\r\nfor South Carolina endorsing slavery.[1183] But he was at least much\r\nnearer rational morals than were his antagonists; the provisions for\r\nliberty of conscience in the South Carolina Constitution are notably far\r\nin advance of any official view ever previously promulgated; and in\r\nsubsuming the \"social contract\" he was but following Hooker and Milton,\r\nand indeed adapting Aristotle, an authority whom Locke's later critics\r\nare wont to magnify.\r\n\r\n     Sir Frederick Pollock, in his _Introduction to the History of the\r\n     Science of Politics_ (p. 20), assumes to have saved Aristotle from\r\n     the criticism which assails the \"social contract\" theory, by saying\r\n     that Aristotle regards a \"clanless and masterless man\" as a monster\r\n     or an impossibility, whereas the \"theorists of the social contract\r\n     school\" take such a man to be the social unit. There is really no\r\n     reason to suppose that Aristotle would have denied a pre-political\r\n     state of nomadic barbarism such as is vaguely figured by Thucydides\r\n     (i, 2); and as a matter of fact he does expressly posit a process\r\n     of society-making by compact, first by the utility-seeking\r\n     combination of families in a village, later by the villages\r\n     _joining themselves_ into a State, whose express purpose is \"good\r\n     life\" (_Politics_, I, ii). It does not cancel this to say that\r\n     Aristotle also makes the State \"prior\" in the rational order to\r\n     man, for his \"prior\" (I, ii, 12-14) is not a historical but a\r\n     metaphysical or ethical proposition. In the third book, again (c.\r\n     9), he endorses a proposition of Lycophron which virtually affirms\r\n     the social contract.\r\n\r\n     And just as the school of Maine attacks the social contract theory\r\n     for giving a false view of the origin of society, so did Bodin long\r\n     ago, and at least as cogently, attack Aristotle and Cicero for\r\n     defining a State as a society of men assembled to live well and\r\n     happily. Bodin insists (_De la Republique_, 1580, l. i, c. i, p. 5;\r\n     l. i, c. vi, p. 48; l. iv, c. i, _ad init._ p. 350) that all States\r\n     originated in violence, the earliest being found full of slaves. It\r\n     is true that Aristotle at the outset implies that slavery is as old\r\n     as the family, but he still speaks of States as voluntary\r\n     combinations for a good end. As to the first kings he is also vague\r\n     and contradictory, and is criticised by Bodin accordingly.\r\n     Aristotle was doubtless adaptable to the monarchic as well as to\r\n     the democratic creed; but Bodin's criticism suggests that in the\r\n     sixteenth century he was felt to be too favourable to the latter.\r\n\r\n     It may be worth while to remark that the notion of an unsociable\r\n     \"state of nature\" prior to a \"social contract\" was effectively\r\n     criticised by Sir William Temple in his _Essay upon the Origin and\r\n     Nature of Government_ (1672). With a really scientific\r\n     discrimination he points to food conditions as mainly determining\r\n     gregation or segregation among animals, observing: \"Nor do I know,\r\n     if men are like sheep, why they need any government, or, if they\r\n     are like wolves, how they can suffer it\" (_Works_, ed. 1814, i, 9,\r\n     10). In the next generation, again, the ultra-Hobbesian view was\r\n     keenly attacked and confuted by Shaftesbury within a few years of\r\n     Locke's death (_Characteristics_, early edd. i, 109-11; ii,\r\n     310-21). As I have elsewhere pointed out (_Buckle and his Critics_,\r\n     p. 395), the \"contract\" theory lent itself equally to Whiggism and\r\n     to High Toryism.\r\n\r\n     Towards the end of the eighteenth century we find the Radical\r\n     Bentham (_Fragment on Government_, 1776) deriding it as held by the\r\n     Tory Blackstone. But Rousseau himself (preface to the _Discours sur\r\n     l'inegalite_) avowedly handled the \"State of Nature\" as an ideal,\r\n     not as a historical truth; and Blackstone did the same. It is\r\n     therefore only a new species of abstract fallacy, and one for which\r\n     there is no practical excuse, to argue as does the school of Maine\r\n     (cp. Pollock, as cited, pp. 63, 75, 79, etc.) that the theories in\r\n     question are responsible for the French Revolution in general, or\r\n     the Reign of Terror in particular. Revolutions occur for reasons\r\n     embodied in states of life: they avail themselves of the theories\r\n     that lie to hand. The doctrine that \"all are born equal\" or \"free\"\r\n     comes from the Institutes of Justinian, and is laid down in so many\r\n     words by Bishop Sherborne of Chichester in 1536, and by the\r\n     orthodox Spanish Jesuit Suarez early in the seventeenth century\r\n     (_Tractatus de Legibus_, l. ii, c. ii, Sec. 3). The first-mentioned\r\n     passage is cited by Stubbs, iii, 623-24, and the second by Hallam,\r\n     _Literature of Europe_, iii, 160.\r\n\r\nThe derivation was bound to warp the theory; but such as it is, it\r\nrepresents the beginning of a new art, and therefore of a new science,\r\nof representative government. A variety of forces combined to prevent\r\nanarchy on the one hand, and on the other the fatal consolidation of the\r\nmonarch's power which took place in France.[1184] The new English king\r\nwas a Protestant, and therefore religiously acceptable to the people;\r\nbut he was a Dutchman, and therefore racially obnoxious; for fierce\r\ncommercial jealousy had long smouldered between the two peoples, and war\r\nhad fanned it into flames that had burned wide. Further, he was a\r\n\"latitudinarian\" in religious matters, and zealous to appoint\r\nlatitudinarian bishops; and the retirement from London forced on him by\r\nhis asthma deepened tenfold the effect of his normal coldness of manner\r\ntowards all and sundry. In the very Church whose cause he had saved, he\r\nwas unpopular not only with the out-and-out zealots of political divine\r\nright, but with the zealous Churchmen as such, inasmuch as he favoured\r\nthe Dissenters as far as he dared. So hampered and frustrated was he\r\nthat it seems as if nothing but his rare genius for fighting a losing\r\nbattle could have saved him, despite the many reasons the nation had for\r\nadhering to him.\r\n\r\nOne of these reasons, which counted for much, was the political effect\r\nof a National Debt in attaching creditors as determined supporters to\r\nthe Government. The highest sagacity, perhaps, could not have framed a\r\nbetter device than this for establishing a new dynasty; albeit the\r\ndevice was itself made a ground of hostile criticism, and was, of\r\ncourse, resorted to as a financial necessity, or at least as a resource\r\npointed to by Dutch example, not as a stroke of statecraft. What\r\nprudence and conciliation could do, William sought to do. And yet, with\r\nall his sanity and enlightenment, he failed utterly to apply his\r\ntolerant principles to that part of his administration which most sorely\r\nneeded them--the government of Ireland. Even in England he could not\r\ncarry tolerance nearly as far as he wished;[1185] but in Ireland he was\r\nforced to acquiesce in Protestant tyranny of the worst description. The\r\nbigotry of his High Church subjects was too strong for him. On the\r\nsurrender of the last adherents of James at Limerick he concluded a\r\ntreaty which gave the Irish Catholics the religious freedom they had had\r\nunder Charles II when the Cromwellian oppression was removed; but the\r\nEnglish Parliament refused to sanction it, save on the condition that\r\nnobody should sit in the Irish Parliament without first repudiating the\r\nCatholic doctrines. This was not the first virtual breach of faith by\r\nEngland towards Ireland; and it alone might have sufficed to poison\r\nunion between the two countries; but it was only the first step in a\r\nrenewal of the atrocious policy of the past.[1186]\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration the ex-Cromwellian diplomatists had contrived to\r\narrange matters so that the monstrous confiscations made under the\r\nCommonwealth should be substantially maintained; though the settlement\r\nof 1653 had been made in entire disregard of the Act of Oblivion by\r\nCharles I in 1648; and though Charles II avowed in the House of Lords in\r\n1660 that they had \"showed much affection to him abroad.\" So base were\r\nthe tactics of the Protestants that many Irish were charged with having\r\nforfeited their lands by signing under compulsion the engagement to\r\nrenounce the House of Stuart; while those who had compelled them to the\r\nact now held the lands as royalists. But the decisive evil was the base\r\nindolence of the King. As Halifax said of him, he \"would slide from an\r\nasking face\";[1187] and what Clarendon called \"that _imbecillitas\r\nfrontis_ which kept him from denying\"[1188] made him solve the\r\nintolerable strife of suitors by leaving possession in the main to those\r\nwho had it. The adventurers and soldiers finally relinquished only\r\none-third of their estates;[1189] and only a few hundreds of favoured\r\nIrish were restored to their old lands, under burden of compensation to\r\nthe dispossessed holders.[1190]\r\n\r\nWhen the resort of James II to Ireland gave power to the oppressed\r\npopulation, it was a matter of course that reprisals should be\r\nattempted. The English historian glibly decides that they should not\r\nhave been permitted; that the King \"ought to have determined that the\r\nexisting settlement of landed property should be inviolable\"; and that\r\n\"whether, in the great transfer of estates, injustice had or had not\r\nbeen committed, _was immaterial_. That transfer, just or unjust, had\r\ntaken place so long ago that to reverse it would be to unfix the\r\nfoundations of society.\"[1191] Thus does the race which claims to be\r\ncivilised prescribe a course of action for that which it declares to be\r\nuncivilised.[1192] It is further suggested that the English interest in\r\nthe Irish Parliament would have \"willingly\" granted James a \"very\r\nconsiderable sum\" to indemnify the despoiled natives for whom during a\r\nquarter of a century it had never moved a finger. There is not the least\r\nreason to believe in any such willingness; and it was in the ordinary\r\nway of things that the wronged race should not exhibit a moderation and\r\nmagnanimity of which the wrongers had never for a moment shown\r\nthemselves capable. The Irish Parliament of 1689, indeed, took care to\r\nindemnify all purchasers and mortgagees, while dispossessing original\r\nholders under the Cromwellian Settlement;[1193] but it passed an Act of\r\nAttainder in the fashion of the age; and when the Protestant cause\r\ntriumphed, the revenge taken was a hundredfold greater than the\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nIt was the legislature, not the crown, that did the work. Under the\r\ntolerant and statesmanlike King, the Irish Protestant Parliament\r\nproceeded to pass law after law making the life of Catholics one of\r\ncruel humiliation and intolerable wrong. There is nothing in civilised\r\nhistory to compare with the process by which religious and racial hatred\r\nin combination once more set the miserable Irish nation on the rack. The\r\nextreme political insanity of the course taken is doubtless to be\r\nattributed to the propagandist madness of James, who had just before\r\nsought to give all Ireland over to Catholicism. Fanaticism bred\r\nfanaticism. But the fact remains that the Protestant fanatics began in\r\nthe reign of William a labour of hate which, carried on in succeeding\r\nreigns, at length made Ireland the darkest problem in our politics.\r\n\r\n     Hassencamp (pp. 117, 125) insists that the penal laws \"were not\r\n     dictated by any considerations of religion, but were merely the\r\n     offspring of the spirit of domination,\" citing for this view Burke,\r\n     _Letter to a Peer_ (_Works_, Bohn ed. iii, 296), and _Letter to Sir\r\n     Hercules Langrishe_ (_Id. ib._ p. 321). But this is an attempt to\r\n     dissociate religion from persecution in the interests of religious\r\n     credit, and will not bear criticism. Burke, in fact, contradicts\r\n     himself, assigning the religious motive in an earlier page (292) of\r\n     the _Letter to a Peer_, and again in the _Letter to Langrishe_ (p.\r\n     301). When the Protestants went on heaping injuries on the\r\n     Catholics in the knowledge that the people remained fixed in\r\n     Catholicism, they were only acting as religious persecutors have\r\n     always done. On Burke's and Hassencamp's view, persecution could\r\n     never take place from religious motives at all. No doubt the race\r\n     feeling was fundamental, but the two barbaric instincts were really\r\n     combined. Cp. Macaulay's _History_, ch. vi (2-vol. ed. 1877, i,\r\n     390-93).\r\n\r\nAs regards Irish trade, commercial malice had already effected all that\r\nreligious malice could wish. Even in the reign of Henry VIII a law was\r\npassed forbidding the importation of Irish wool into England; and in the\r\nnext century Strafford sought further to crush the Irish woollen trade\r\naltogether in the English interest, throwing the Irish back on their\r\nlinen trade and agriculture, which he encouraged.[1194] Strafford's\r\navowed object was the keeping Ireland thoroughly subject to the English\r\ncrown by making the people dependent on England for their chief\r\nclothing; and to the same end he proposed to hold for the crown a\r\nmonopoly of all Irish trade in salt.[1195] Cromwell, on his part, was\r\nsane enough to leave Irish shipping on the same footing as English under\r\nhis Navigation Act; but in 1663 the Restoration Parliament put Ireland\r\non the footing of a foreign State, thus destroying her shipping trade\r\nonce for all,[1196] and arresting her natural intercourse with the\r\nAmerican colonies. In the same year, a check was placed on the English\r\nimportation of Irish fat cattle: two years later, the embargo was laid\r\non lean cattle and dead meat; still later, it was laid on sheep, swine,\r\npork, bacon, mutton, and cheese. In William's reign, new repressions\r\nwere effected. The veto on wool export having led to woollen\r\nmanufactures, which were chiefly in the hands of Dissenters and\r\nCatholics,[1197] the Irish Parliament, consisting of Episcopalian\r\nlandlords, was induced in 1698 to put heavy export duties on Irish\r\nwoollens; and this failing of its full purpose, in the following year\r\nthe English Parliament absolutely prohibited all export of manufactured\r\nwool from Ireland.[1198]\r\n\r\nTo this policy of systematic iniquity the first offset was a measure of\r\nprotection to the Irish linen trade in 1703; and this benefaction went\r\nalmost solely into the hands of the Scotch settlers in Ulster.[1199]\r\nEven thereafter the linen trade of Ireland was so maimed and restricted\r\nby English hindrances that it was revived only by continual bounties\r\nfrom 1743 to 1773. And this twice restored and subsidised industry, thus\r\nexpressly struck out of native and put in Protestant and alien hands,\r\nhas been in our own age repeatedly pointed to as a proof of the\r\nsuperiority of the Protestant and non-Celtic inhabitants over the others\r\nin energy and enterprise. As a matter of fact, many of the Scots who\r\nbenefited by the bounties of 1703 in Ulster had recently immigrated\r\nbecause of the poverty and over-population of their own country, where\r\ntheir energy and enterprise could do nothing. Irish energy and\r\nenterprise, on the other hand, had been chronically strangled, during\r\ntwo hundred years, by English and Protestant hands, with a persevering\r\nmalice to which there is no parallel in human history; and the process\r\nis seen at its worst after the \"glorious Revolution\" of 1688.\r\n\r\n     Modern English writers of the Conservative school, always eager to\r\n     asperse Ireland, never capable of frankly avowing the English\r\n     causation of Irish backwardness, think it a sufficient exculpation\r\n     of their ancestors' crimes to say that Irishmen have not taken up\r\n     the old industries since they have been free to do so. Thus the\r\n     late Mr. H.D. Traill meets Irish comment on Strafford's treatment\r\n     of the Irish woollen trade by saying that the complainants \"in\r\n     these days prefer other and less worthy industries to those which\r\n     they have now been free to practise, if they chose, for\r\n     generations\" (_Strafford_, 1889, p. 137). This is a fair sample of\r\n     the fashion in which racial and political prejudices prompt men\r\n     otherwise honourable to devices worthy of baseness. It should be\r\n     unnecessary to point out, in reply, that when the Irish industries\r\n     had been so long extirpated as to be lost arts, it was simply\r\n     impossible that they could be successfully restored _in\r\n     competition_ with the highly developed machine industry of England.\r\n     Other countries set up new industries under high protective duties.\r\n     This Ireland could not do. But the most obvious considerations are\r\n     missed by malice.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of modern parliamentary government thus coincide with the\r\nrecommencement, in the worst spirit, of the principal national crime\r\nthus far committed by England; and this not by the choice of, but in\r\ndespite of, the king, at the hands of the Parliament. In the next reign\r\nthe same sin lies at the same door, the monarch doing nothing. The fact\r\nshould serve better than any monarchic special pleading to show us that\r\nthe advance towards freedom is a warfare not merely with despots and\r\ndespotic institutions, but with the spirit of despotism in the average\r\nman; a warfare in which, after a time, the opposing forces are seldom\r\npositive right and wrong, but as a rule only comparative right and\r\nwrong, evil being slowly eliminated by the alternate play of\r\nself-regarding instinct. Gross and wilful political evil, we say, was\r\nwrought in the first stages of the new progress towards political\r\njustice. But that is only another way of saying that even while gross\r\npolitical evil was being wrought, men were on the way towards political\r\njustice. A clear perception of the whole process, when men attain to it,\r\nwill mean that justice is about to be attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5\r\n\r\nEven while the spirit of religion and the spirit of separateness were\r\nworking such wrong in Ireland, the spirit of separateness was\r\nfortunately defeated in Scotland, where it had yet burned strongly\r\nenough to make perpetual division seem the destiny of the two kingdoms.\r\nWe learn how much political institutions count for when we realise that\r\nin Scotland, just before the parliamentary union with England, there was\r\nas furious an aversion to all things English as there has ever been\r\nshown in France of late years to things German. The leading Scots\r\npatriots were not only bitterly averse to union, but hotly bent on\r\nsecuring that the line of succession in Scotland after Anne should not\r\nbe the same as that in England; this because they held that Scottish\r\nliberties could never be secure under an English king. The stern\r\nFletcher of Saltoun, a Republican at heart, had to play in part the game\r\nof the Jacobites, much as he abominated their cause. But both alike were\r\ndefeated, with better results than could possibly have followed on any\r\nseparation of the crowns; and the vehement opposition of the great mass\r\nof the Scots people to the Parliamentary Union was likewise defeated, in\r\na manner hard to understand. The heat of the popular passion in Scotland\r\nis shown by the infamously unjust execution of the English Captain Green\r\nand two of his men[1200] on a charge of killing a missing Scotch captain\r\nand crew who were not even proved to be dead, and were afterwards found\r\nto be alive. The fanatical remnant of the Covenanters was as bitter\r\nagainst union as the Jacobites. Yet in the teeth of all this violence of\r\nfeeling the Union was carried, and this not wholly by bribery,[1201] as\r\nwas then alleged, and as might be suspected from the analogy of the\r\nlater case of Ireland, but through the pressure of common-sense instinct\r\namong the less noisy. There was indeed an element of bribery in the\r\nEnglish allowance of liberal compensation to the shareholders of the\r\nAfrican Company (better known as the Darien Company), who thus had good\r\ncash in exchange for shares worth next to nothing; and in a certain\r\nsense the reluctant English concession to Scotland of freedom of trade\r\nwas a bribe. But it is by such concessions that treaties are secured;\r\nand it needed a very clear self-interest to bring round a Scotch\r\nmajority to union in the teeth of a popular hostility much more fierce\r\nthan is shown in our own day in the not altogether disparate case of\r\nUlster, as regards Home Rule. Burton and Macaulay agreed[1202] that the\r\nintense wish and need of the Scottish trading class to participate in\r\nthe trade of England (as they had done to much advantage under Cromwell,\r\nbut had been hindered from doing after the Restoration) was what brought\r\nabout the passing of the Act of Union in the Scots Parliament. No doubt\r\nthe moderate Presbyterians saw that their best security lay in\r\nunion;[1203] but that recognition could never have overridden the\r\nstiff-necked forces of fanaticism and race hatred[1204] were it not for\r\nthe call of plain pecuniary advantage. A transformation had begun in\r\nScotland. The country which for a hundred and fifty years had been\r\ndistracted by fanatical strifes, losing its best elements of culture\r\nunder the spell of Judaic bibliolatry, had at length, under the obscure\r\ninfluence of English example, begun to move out of the worst toils of\r\nthe secondary barbarism, not indeed into a path of pure\r\ncivilisation--the harm had gone too deep for that--but towards a life of\r\nsecular industry which at least prepared a soil for a better life in the\r\ncenturies to come; and even for a time, under the stimulus of the new\r\nthought of France, developed a brilliant and various scientific\r\nliterature. The Darien scheme may be taken as a turning-point in\r\nScottish history; an act of commercial enterprise then arousing an\r\namount of energy and sensation that had for centuries been seen only in\r\nconnection with strokes of State and sect. It is not agreeable to\r\nidealising prejudice to accept Emerson's saying[1205] that the greatest\r\nameliorator in human affairs has been \"selfish, huckstering trade\"; but,\r\nbarring the strict force of the superlative, the claim is valid. It is\r\nthe blackest count in the indictment against England for her[1206]\r\ntreatment of Ireland that she deliberately closed to the sister nation\r\nthe door which the Scotch, by refusing union on other terms when union\r\nwas highly expedient in the view of English statesmen, forced her to\r\nopen to them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1145: Armand Carrel (_Histoire de la Contre-Revolution en\r\nAngleterre_, ed. Bruxelles, 1836, p. 8) notes the \"apathetic\r\nindifference\" to which Cromwell's imperialist rule had reduced the\r\nmiddle classes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1146: It is to be noted in this connection that at first the\r\nsecret was very well kept. There can be no reasonable doubt that\r\nShaftesbury and Lauderdale were kept in the dark as to the Treaty of\r\nDover, in which Charles agreed with Louis to introduce Catholicism in\r\nEngland. Macaulay's suggestion to the contrary comes of his\r\ndetermination to hear nothing in Shaftesbury's defence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1147: This is accepted by Armand Carrel, who calls him\r\n(_Histoire de la Contre-Revolution en Angleterre_, p. 6) \"homme d'une\r\nimmoralite profonde.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1148: It is to be regretted that Green, while admitting that\r\nMr. Christie was \"in some respects\" successful in his vindication of\r\nShaftesbury, should have left his own account of Shaftesbury's character\r\nglaringly unfair. Verbally following Burnet, he pronounces Ashley \"at\r\nbest a Deist\" in his religion, and adds that his life was \"that of a\r\ndebauchee,\" going on to couple the terms \"Deist and debauchee\" in a very\r\nclerical fashion. And yet in the previous paragraph he admits that \"the\r\ndebauchery of Ashley was simply a mask. He was, in fact, _temperate by\r\nnature and habit_, and his ill-health rendered any great excess\r\nimpossible.\" The non-correction of the flat contradiction must\r\napparently be set down to Green's ill-health. As a matter of fact, the\r\ncharge of debauchery is baseless. Long before Mr. Christie, one of the\r\nannotators of Burnet's _History_ (ed. 1838, p. 64, _note_) defended\r\nShaftesbury generally, and pointed out that \"in private life we have no\r\ntestimony that he was depraved.\" Cp. Christie, _Life of Anthony Ashley\r\nCooper_, 1871, i, 316.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1149: _History of His Own Time_, ed. 1838, p. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1150: My old friend, Mr. Alfred Marks, whose masterly book,\r\n_Who Killed Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey?_ (Burns and Oates, 1905),\r\ndecisively establishes the suicide theory, and disposes of the\r\ncounter-theory of Mr. John Pollock, did not dispute the fact of the\r\nvague plotting of Coleman.

In\r\nthe oldest culture-history at all known to us, as we have seen, the\r\ncommercial factor affects everything else; and at no time in European\r\nannals do we fail to note some special scene or area in which trade\r\nfurnishes to politicians special problems. Thus the culture-history of\r\nItaly, as we have also seen, is in past epochs inseparably bound up with\r\nher commercial history. But as regards the north of Europe, it is in the\r\nmodern period that we begin specially to recognise trade as playing a\r\nleading part in politics, national and international. The Mediterranean\r\ntradition is first seen powerfully at work in the history of the Hansa\r\ntowns: then comes the great development of Flanders, then that of\r\nHolland, then that of England, which gained so much from the influx of\r\nFlemish and Dutch Protestant refugees in the reign of Philip II, but\r\nwhich was checked in its commercial growth, under Elizabeth and James\r\nalike, by their policy of granting monopolies to favourites.\r\n\r\n     Sir Josiah Child puts \"the latter end of Elizabeth's reign\" as the\r\n     time when England began to be \"anything in trade\" (_New Discourse\r\n     of Trade_, 4th ed. p. 73). Cp. Prof. Busch on English trade under\r\n     Henry VII, _England unter den Tudors_, i, 71-85, with Schanz,\r\n     _Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 328, where it is stated that in the\r\n     latter part of the sixteenth century there were 3,000 merchants\r\n     engaged in the sea trade. This seems extremely doubtful when we\r\n     note that the whole foreign trade of London was stated in\r\n     Parliament in 1604 to be in the hands of some 200 citizens\r\n     (_Journals of the House of Commons_, May 21, 1604), and the total\r\n     customs of London amounted to L110,000 a year, as against L17,000\r\n     from all the rest of the kingdom. As Hume notes (ch. 45, _note_), a\r\n     remonstrance from the Trinity House in 1602 declared that since\r\n     1588 the shipping and number of seamen in England had decayed about\r\n     a third. (Cit. from Anglesey's _Happy Future State of England_, p.\r\n     128.) This again, however, seems doubtful.\r\n\r\n     Broadly put, the fact appears to be that after a considerable\r\n     development of woollen manufacture in the towns during the Wars of\r\n     the Roses (above, p. 393), when sheep-rearing must have been\r\n     precarious and wool would be imported, there was a general return\r\n     to pasturage under the Tudor peace, the towns falling away, with\r\n     their manufactures. Attempts were made under Henry VIII and Edward\r\n     VI to develop the English mining industries by means of German\r\n     workmen and overseers, but apparently with no great success\r\n     (Ehrenberg, _Hamburg und England im Zeit. der Koen. Elisabeth_,\r\n     1896, pp. 4-6). It was after the persecution of Protestants in the\r\n     Netherlands under Charles V had driven many tradesmen to England\r\n     for refuge that manufacturing industry notably revived; and in\r\n     1564-65 we find the year's exports of England reckoned at L68,190\r\n     for wool and L896,079 for cloths and other woollen wares; the whole\r\n     of the rest of the export trade amounting only to L133,665 (Brit.\r\n     Mus. Lansdowne MS. 10, fol. 121-22, cited by Ehrenberg, p. 8; cp.\r\n     Cunningham, _Industry and Commerce_, ii, 82-83; Gibbins,\r\n     _Industrial Hist. of England_, 3rd. ed. pp. 132-33.) After the fall\r\n     of Antwerp, again, much of the commerce of that city fell to the\r\n     share of England, some of her commercial and artisan population\r\n     following it (Froude, _Hist. of England_, ed. 1872, xii, 1-2).\r\n\r\n     In the same period the commercial life of north Germany, which had\r\n     hitherto been far more widely developed than that of England\r\n     (Ehrenberg, pp. 1-11), was thrown back on the one hand by the\r\n     opening of the new ocean route to the East Indies, which upset the\r\n     trans-European trade from the Mediterranean, and on the other by\r\n     the new strifes between the princes and the cities (_id._ pp.\r\n     34-49); and here again English trade came to the front.\r\n\r\nThe \"Merchant Adventurers,\" ready enough to accept monopolies for their\r\nown incorporations, were free-traders as against other monopolists;[1207]\r\nand not till all such abuses were abolished could England compete with\r\nHolland. And though they were never legally annulled even under the\r\nCommonwealth, \"as men paid no regard to the prerogative whence the\r\ncharters of those companies were derived, the monopoly was gradually\r\ninvaded, and commerce increased by the increase of liberty.\"[1208]\r\nFrance at times promised to rival both Holland and England; but she at\r\nlength definitely fell behind England in the race, as Flanders fell\r\nbehind Holland, by reason of political misdirection. In the middle and\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century, all the northern States had\r\ntheir eyes fastened on the shining example of Holland;[1209]\r\nand commerce, which as an occasion of warfare had since the rise of\r\nChristianity been superseded by religion, begins to give the cue for\r\nanimosities of peoples, rulers, and classes. The last great religious\r\nwar--if we except the strifes of Russia and Turkey, which are\r\nquasi-religious--was the Thirty Years' War. Its very atrocity doubtless\r\nwent far to discredit the religious motive,[1210] and it ranks as the\r\nworst war of the modern world. Commerce, however, for centuries supplied\r\nnew motives for war to men whose ideas of economics were still at the\r\ntheological stage.[1211] The eternal principle of strife, of human\r\nattraction and repulsion, plays through the phenomena of commerce as\r\nthrough those of creed. The profoundly insane lust for gold and silver,\r\nwhich had so largely determined the history of the Roman Empire,\r\ndefinitely shaped that of Spain; and Spain's example fired the northern\r\nnations with whom she came in contact.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Thorold Rogers is responsible for the strange proposition\r\n     (_Economic Interpretation of History_, p. 186; _Industrial and\r\n     Commercial History of England_, p. 321) that the chief source of\r\n     the silver supply of Europe, before the discovery of the New World,\r\n     was _England_. He offers nothing but his own conviction in proof of\r\n     his statement, to which he adds the explanation that the silver in\r\n     question was extracted from sulphuret of lead. It seems well to\r\n     point out that there is not a shadow of foundation for the main\r\n     assertion. That the argentiferous lead mines were worked seems\r\n     clear; but that they could produce the main European supply without\r\n     the fact being historically noted is incredible. On the other hand,\r\n     silver mines were found in Germany in the tenth century and later,\r\n     and there is reason to attribute to their output a gradual rise of\r\n     prices before the fifteenth century (Anderson's _History of\r\n     Commerce_, i, 67). In any case, there is no reason to doubt the\r\n     statement of the historians of the precious metals, that what\r\n     silver was produced in Europe in the Middle Ages was mostly mined\r\n     in Spain and Germany. See Del Mar, _History of the Precious\r\n     Metals_, 1880, pp. 38-43 and refs.; also Ehrenberg, _Hamburg und\r\n     England im Zeitalter der Koenigin Elisabeth_, 1896, pp. 4, 9;\r\n     Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, Cap. 276, _end_; and\r\n     Kohlrausch, _History of Germany_, Eng. tr. 1844, p. 261.\r\n\r\nThe direct search for gold as plunder developed into the pursuit of it\r\nas price; and wealthier States than Spain were raised by the more\r\nroundabout method which Spain disdained.\r\n\r\n     This was soon recognised by Spanish economists, who probably\r\n     followed the French physiocrats, as represented in the excellent\r\n     chapters of Montesquieu on money (cited above, p. 363). See the\r\n     passage from Bernard of Ulloa (1753) cited by Blanqui, _Hist. de\r\n     l'econ. polit._, 2e edit. ii, 28. Cp. Samber, _Memoirs of the Dutch\r\n     Trade_, Eng. tr. 1719, pref. Apart from the habits set up by\r\n     imperialism, the Spaniards were in part anti-industrial because\r\n     industry was so closely associated with the Moriscoes (Major Hume,\r\n     _Spain_, p. 195); and the innumerable Church holidays counted for\r\n     much. Yet in the first half of the sixteenth century Spain had a\r\n     great development of town industrial life (Armstrong, Introd. to\r\n     same vol. pp. 83-84). This is partly attributable to the new\r\n     colonial trade; but probably more to the connection with Flanders.\r\n     Cp. Grattan, _The Netherlands_, pp. 66, 88. About 1670, however,\r\n     manufacture for export had entirely ceased; the trade of Madrid,\r\n     such as it was, was mainly in the hands of Frenchmen; the Church\r\n     and the bureaucracy alone flourished; and although discharged\r\n     soldiers swarmed in the cities, what harvests there were had to be\r\n     reaped by the hands of French labourers who came each season for\r\n     the purpose. Hume, as cited, p. 285. This usage subsisted nearly a\r\n     century later (Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, ed. 1756, p. 25)\r\n\r\nHolland in the seventeenth century presented to the European world, as\r\nwe have seen, the new and striking spectacle of a dense population\r\nthriving on a soil which could not possibly be made to feed them.\r\n\"Trade\" became the watchword of French statesmanship; and Colbert\r\npressed it against a froward nobility;[1212] while in England a\r\ngeneration later it had acquired the deeper rooting that goes with the\r\nvoluntary activity and self-seeking of a numerous class; and already the\r\ngentry freely devoted their younger sons to the pursuits which those of\r\nFrance contemned.[1213]\r\n\r\nThe turn seems to have been taken in the most natural way, after\r\nParliament was able to force on James I a stoppage of the practice of\r\ngranting monopolies. At his accession, the King had sought popularity by\r\ncalling in and scrutinising the many monopolies granted by Elizabeth,\r\nwhich constituted the main grievance of the time.[1214] Soon, however,\r\nhe conformed to the old usage, which had in some measure the support of\r\nBacon;[1215] and in 1621 it was declared that he had multiplied\r\nmonopolies twentyfold.[1216] The most careful historian of the period\r\nreports that though they were continually being abused,[1217] they were\r\ngranted on no corrupt motives, but in sheer mistaken zeal for the spread\r\nof commerce.[1218] It would be more plausible to say that when interests\r\neither of purse or of patronage lay in a certain direction, those\r\nconcerned were very easily satisfied that the interests of commerce\r\npointed the same way. At length, after much dispute, the Lords passed,\r\nin 1624,[1219] a Monopoly Bill previously passed by the Commons in\r\n1621;[1220] and though some of the chief monopolies were left standing,\r\neither as involving patents for inventions or as being vested in\r\ncorporations,[1221] mere private trade monopolies were for the future\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nIt was a triumph of the trading class over the upper, nothing more. As\r\nfor the corporations, they were as avid of monopolies as the courtiers\r\nhad ever been; and independent traders hampered by monopolist\r\ncorporations were only too ready to become monopolist corporations\r\nthemselves.[1222] Under Charles I, for instance, there was set up a\r\nchartered company with a monopoly of soap-making, of which every\r\nmanufacturer could become a member--a kind of chartered \"trust,\" born\r\nout of due time--the price paid to the crown for the privilege being\r\nL10,000 and a royalty of L8 on every ton of soap made. For this payment\r\nthe monopolists received full powers of coercion and the punitive aid of\r\nthe Star Chamber. After a few years, in consideration of a higher\r\npayment, the King revoked the first patent and established a new\r\ncorporation. Similar monopolies were granted to starch-makers and other\r\nproducers; the Long Parliament pursuing the same policy, \"till\r\nmonopolies became as common as they had been under James or\r\nElizabeth.\"[1223]\r\n\r\nPart of the result was that about 1635 \"there were more merchants to be\r\nfound upon the exchange worth each one thousand pounds and upwards than\r\nthere were in the former days, before the year 1600, to be found worth\r\none hundred pounds each.\"[1224] The upper classes, as capitalists and\r\neven as traders, were not now likely to remain aloof. But all the while\r\nthere was no betterment of the lot of the poor. \"That our poor in\r\nEngland,\" writes Child after the Restoration, \"have always been in a\r\nmost sad and wretched condition ... is confessed and lamented by all\r\nmen.\"[1225] Child's theory of the effect of usury laws in the matter is\r\npure fallacy; but his estimate of men's fortunes is probably more\r\naccurate than the statement of the Venetian ambassador in the reign of\r\nMary, that \"there were many merchants in London with L50,000 or L60,000\r\neach.\"[1226] Howell, in 1619,[1227] expresses a belief that \"our\r\nfour-and-twenty aldermen may buy a hundred of the richest men in\r\nAmsterdam.\" Yet, though it was also confessed that among the Dutch, and\r\neven in Hamburg and Paris, the poor were intelligently provided\r\nfor,[1228] no such necessity was practically recognised in\r\nEngland,[1229] either by Puritan or by Cavalier, though before the\r\nRebellion the administration of Charles had not been apathetic;[1230]\r\nand a century later there were the same conditions of popular misery and\r\nvice, with a new plague of drunkenness added.[1231] By that time, too,\r\nthe corporation monopolies were strangling trade just as the private\r\nmonopolies had formerly done;[1232] while France, which in the latter\r\npart of the seventeenth century gave such a stimulus to English and\r\nDutch industry by the suicidal Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, had\r\nrecovered both population and trade,[1233] and was on a commercial\r\nfooting which, well developed, might have given her the victory over\r\nEngland in the race for empire.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the seventeenth century, however, the new development\r\nmeant new strife. Protestant England and Holland, Catholic France and\r\nProtestant Holland, flew at each other's throats in quarrels of trade\r\nand tariffs; and for the monopoly of the trade in cloves, Dutch and\r\nSpanish and English battled as furiously as for constraint and freedom\r\nof conscience. The primitively selfish and mistaken notion men had\r\nformed of commercial economy was on a level with the religious impulse\r\nas it had subsisted from the beginning of Christendom; and even as each\r\nChristian sect had felt it necessary to throttle the rest, each nation\r\nfelt that its prosperity depended on the others' impoverishment. To\r\nspite the Dutch, the Cromwellian party in 1651 passed the Navigation\r\nAct, prohibiting all imports of foreign goods save in English ships or\r\nthose of the nations producing them. In practice it was a total failure,\r\nthe effect being to injure the English rather than the Dutch trade; but\r\nthe Dutch themselves, who were fanatical for their own Asiatic monopoly\r\ntrade, believed it would injure them, and went to war accordingly.\r\n\r\n     The eulogy of the Navigation Act as \"wise\" by Adam Smith (put, by\r\n     the way, with a \"perhaps\") is one of his worst mistakes. Roger Coke\r\n     in 1672 testified (_Treatise on Trade_, p. 68, cited by M'Culloch)\r\n     that within two years of the passing of the Act England lost the\r\n     greater part of the Baltic and Greenland trades; and Sir Josiah\r\n     Child's _New Discourse of Trade_ shows in detail that the English\r\n     by about 1670 or 1690 had lost to the Dutch even much of the trade\r\n     they formerly had. (See Preface to second and later editions, and\r\n     compare M'Culloch, note xi to his edition of the _Wealth of\r\n     Nations_, and McCullagh, _Industrial History_, ii, 340.) The one\r\n     direction in which the Act seems to have been successful was in\r\n     stimulating shipbuilding and seafaring in the American colonies.\r\n     (See Prof. Ashley in the _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, Boston,\r\n     November, 1899, pp. 4-6.) Joshua Gee, in his _Trade and Navigation\r\n     of Great Britain Considered_ (1730, 6th ed. p. 113), expressly\r\n     ascribes a \"prodigious increase of our shipping\" to \"the timber\r\n     trade between Portugal, etc., and our plantations,\" one result\r\n     being that English ships have \"become the common carriers in the\r\n     Mediterranean, as well as between the Mediterranean, Holland,\r\n     Hambro', and the Baltic.\" He says nothing of the Navigation Act,\r\n     but lays stress on the cheap building of ships in New England, and\r\n     notes (p. 114) that the Dutch habitually hire English ships \"to\r\n     transport their goods from Spain, etc., to Amsterdam, and other\r\n     places.\"\r\n\r\nEven among expert merchants there was no true economic science, only a\r\ncertain empirical knowledge, reduced to rule of thumb. Hence the traders\r\nwere for ever tending to strangle trade, and the ablest administrators\r\nfell into the snare. Everywhere they tended to be possessed by the gross\r\nfallacy that they could somehow sell without buying,[1234] and so heap\r\nup gold and silver; and to secure at least a balance in bullion was\r\nconsidered an absolute necessity. This was the most serious error of the\r\npolicy of Colbert, who secured a balance of social gain to France by\r\nstimulating and protecting shipping and new industries,[1235] but failed\r\nto learn the lesson that foreign commerce in the end must consist in an\r\nexchange of goods. Thus, though he resisted the ruinous methods of Louis\r\nXIV,[1236] he lent himself to the theory which, next to the hope of\r\nmaking the Netherlands a province of France and so an arm of French\r\nnaval strength, stimulated the policy of war. By repeatedly raising his\r\ntariffs he forced the Dutch to raise theirs; whereupon France went to\r\nwar. Had he known that the Dutch could not sell to France without buying\r\nthence, and _vice versa_, he would have rested content with establishing\r\nhis new industries.\r\n\r\n     M. Dussieux (as cited, p. 127) frames a deplorable demonstration\r\n     that Holland was impoverishing France and destroying all industry\r\n     there by selling more articles than she bought. As if any country\r\n     could go on buying in perpetuity without selling in payment. M.\r\n     Dussieux goes on to admit that France before Colbert had some great\r\n     industries, and a great agricultural export trade, as must needs\r\n     have been. His argument shows the survival of the mercantilist\r\n     delusion that trade can drain a productive country of its bullion.\r\n     It is evident that Colbert helped trade more by checking fiscal\r\n     abuses and promoting canals and roads than by protecting new\r\n     industries. On the whole he seems to have gravely injured\r\n     agriculture (_id._ pp. 89, _note_, and 133); and Adam Smith's\r\n     criticism (_Wealth of Nations_, bk. iii, ch. ii; bk. iv, ch. ix)\r\n     remains valid. He was \"imposed upon by the sophistry of merchants\r\n     and manufacturers, who are always demanding a monopoly against\r\n     their countrymen,\" and by prohibiting export of grain he depressed\r\n     agriculture, the natural and facile industry of France, and so\r\n     promoted the rural misery which at length inspired the Revolution.\r\n     It was essentially by way of reaction against his error that the\r\n     Physiocrats fell into theirs--the denial that any industry was\r\n     productive _except_ agriculture. Even if he had not prohibited\r\n     export of grain, his import duties, in so far as they excluded\r\n     foreign products, would have checked the grain exports which had\r\n     formerly paid for these. Thus, as M. Dussieux admits, Colbert\r\n     failed to secure prosperity for the peasantry while he was helping\r\n     industry. (Cp. Brandt, _Beitraege_, as cited.) Colbert in the\r\n     nineteenth century had the benefit of the doctrine that monarchism\r\n     prepared for democracy in France, and there is some truth in the\r\n     protest of Morin that on this and other grounds he became the\r\n     object of \"un culte ridicule qui brave les notions les plus\r\n     elementaires de l'economie publique\" (_Origines de la democratie_,\r\n     Introd.--written in 1854--p. 48). Morin goes so far as to charge on\r\n     Colbert equally with Louvois the misfortunes of France under Louis\r\n     XIV (_id._ pp. 88, 120).\r\n\r\nOf course the rival nations were equally self-seeking. Prohibitive\r\ntariffs were necessarily lowest with the most specifically commercial\r\nState, the Dutch; and the free trade doctrine began early to be heard in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n     _E.g._, from Dudley North. Macaulay, ed. cited, i, 253. See the\r\n     quotations in M'Culloch, as above cited. Pepys, in his _Diary_,\r\n     under date 1664, February 29, tells how Sir Philip Warwick\r\n     expounded to him the \"paradox\" that it does not impoverish the\r\n     nation to export less than it imports. For earlier instances of\r\n     right thinking on the subject see the author's _Trade and Tariffs_,\r\n     p. 65 _sq_. The repeal in 1663 of statutes against exporting\r\n     bullion was carried in the interests of the East India Company, and\r\n     apparently on a false theory; see it in Child, _New Discourse_, p.\r\n     173. Cp. Shaftesbury, _Characteristics_, Treatise II, pt. i, Sec. 2,\r\n     _end_, as to the advantage of a \"free port.\" This had been\r\n     partially insisted on, as we have seen, by the Merchant Adventurers\r\n     in the days of Elizabeth and James; and Raleigh strongly pressed it\r\n     in his _Observations touching Trade and Commerce with the Hollander\r\n     and other Nations_, presented to James. Works, ed. 1829, viii,\r\n     356-57. Raleigh, however, was a bullionist.\r\n\r\nBut whether rulers leant in the direction of free trade or strove to\r\nheap up import duties as did France, they went to war for monopolies and\r\nfor imposts. Holland had as determinedly sought the ruin of Antwerp as\r\nEngland did that of Holland. And as the race-principle embroiled nations\r\non the score of trade, so the class-principle set up new feuds of class\r\nin all the nations concerned. The new trading class fought for its own\r\nhand as the trade gilds of the Middle Ages had done; and the fact of its\r\nconnections with the gentry did not prevent animosity between gentry and\r\ntraders or investors in the mass. Thus were the old issues complicated,\r\nfor good or for ill.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Cunningham (_English Industry and Commerce_, ed. 1892, ii,\r\n     16-17) offers an unexpected defence of the \"Mercantile System,\"\r\n     under which bullion was striven for as \"the direct means of\r\n     securing power.\" \"The wisdom of the whole scheme,\" he writes, \"is\r\n     apparently justified by the striking development of national power\r\n     which took place during the period when it lasted. England first\r\n     outstripped Holland and then raised an empire in the East on the\r\n     ruins of French dependencies.\" After this argument Dr. Cunningham\r\n     falters, observing: \"But even if the logic of facts seems to tell\r\n     in its favour, there is a danger of fallacy: success was attained,\r\n     but how far was it due to the working of coal, and the age of\r\n     mechanical invention, and how far to the policy pursued?\" There is\r\n     really no need to suppose such an antinomy between \"the logic of\r\n     facts\" and any other logic. The only legitimate logic of facts is\r\n     that which takes in all the facts. Now, seeing that France was as\r\n     much devoted as England to the Mercantile System, and that in the\r\n     terms of the case she failed, it cannot have been the Mercantile\r\n     System that secured success to England. The logic of facts excludes\r\n     the hypothesis. As for the \"outstripping\" of Holland, a country\r\n     with perhaps a fourth of England's population in the eighteenth\r\n     century, we have seen that the Mercantile System, as operating in\r\n     the Navigation Act, totally failed to attain its purpose, and that\r\n     Dutch decadence was largely due to monopolies--_i.e._, to\r\n     acceptance of the Mercantile System. The working of coal, on the\r\n     other hand, was a real wealth-making force, certainly conducive to\r\n     naval and other empire. But more allowance is to be made for the\r\n     fact that France had heavy continental quarrels on hand while she\r\n     was fighting England in Asia and America.\r\n\r\nIf at this stage we seek to discover the manner of life of the working\r\nclass in England, we shall find it hard to reach a confident conception.\r\nMany phrases in Shakespeare remind us that as towns grew there grew with\r\nthem a nondescript semi-industrial class, untrained for any regular\r\nindustry and unable to subsist without industry of some sort. In the\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century we seem to see a process of\r\nelimination at work by which the organisms capable of enduring toil are\r\nselected from a mass to which such toil was too irksome. In 1668 Sir\r\nJosiah Child writes that the English poor in a cheap year \"will not work\r\nabove two days in a week; their humour being such that they will ...\r\njust work so much and no more as may maintain them in that mean\r\ncondition to which they have been accustomed.\" That, accordingly, a high\r\nprice for bread was a good thing, as forcing the poor to industry,\r\nbecame the standing doctrine of such publicists as Petty.[1237] In the\r\nnext generation, Mandeville puts as indisputable the statement that \"the\r\npoor\" will not work any more than they need to maintain bare existence.\r\nWhen, late in the eighteenth century, we find Adam Smith, with French\r\ntestimony to support him, denying that the pinch of poverty makes for\r\nindustry, we are left in doubt as to whether the improvement came by a\r\npositive dying out of the lazy types through the new plague of\r\nalcoholism, or through the gradual exemplary force of a higher standard\r\nof comfort as seen among the more industrious. Probably both influences\r\nwere at work. But it was at best in a grimy under-world of degeneracy\r\nand hunger, squalor and riot, that there were laid the roots of the new\r\nmechanical industries which were to make England the chief mill and\r\ncounter of Europe.[1238] And when we find one of the acutest observers\r\nof the next generation arguing that a large body of the needy poor is\r\nthe right and necessary basis of industry and public wealth,[1239] we\r\nrealise that the new life was to be as hard for the toilers as that of\r\nany earlier age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_\r\n\r\nIt is in the reign of the last of the Stuarts, whose sex made her\r\nperforce rely on ministers to rule for her, and whose unenlightened\r\nzeal[1240] thus missed the disaster which similar qualities had brought\r\nupon two of her predecessors--it is in the reign of Anne, swayed by\r\nfavourites to an extent that might have made monarchy ridiculous[1241]\r\nif monarchists had gone by reason and not by superstition--that there\r\nbegins recognisably the era of government by parliamentary leaders,\r\nrepresenting at once, in varying degrees, monarch and people; and it is\r\nat this point that we begin the biographical studies[1242] to which the\r\nforegoing pages offer an introduction. But under new conditions and\r\nphases we are to meet for the most part repetitions and developments of\r\nthe forces already recognised as at work from time immemorial. Thus\r\nearly have we seen in action, on the field of English history, most of\r\nthose primary forces of strife whose play makes the warp of politics,\r\nancient and modern; and the distinct emergence, withal, of that spirit\r\nwhich, rare and transient in ancient times, seems destined to inherit\r\nthe later earth--the spirit of science, which slowly transmutes politics\r\nfrom an animal to an intellectual process, raising it from the stage of\r\nmere passional life to the stage of constructive art, and from the\r\nsocial relation of rule and subjection towards the relation of mutuality\r\nand corporate intelligence. Politics, we formally say, is the process of\r\nthe clash of wills, sympathies, interests, striving for social\r\nadjustment in the sphere of legislation and government. The earlier\r\nphases are crude and animalistic, and involve much resort to physical\r\nstrife. The later phases are gradually humanised and intelligised, till\r\nat length the science of the past process builds up a new phase of\r\nconsciousness, which evolves a conscious progressive art. That is to\r\nsay, the conscious progressive art develops in course of time: it had\r\nnot really arisen in any valid form at the period to which we have\r\nbrought our bird's-eye view. It had transiently arisen in the ancient\r\nworld, as in Solon and, far less effectually, in the Gracchi; but the\r\nconditions were too evil for its growth, and the course of things\r\npolitical was downward, the animal instincts overriding science, till\r\neven when there was compulsory peace the spirit of science could no more\r\nblossom. In English politics, soon after the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the conditions brought about civil peace under a new dynasty,\r\nwhich it was the function of the statesmanship of the dynasty to\r\nmaintain. At the same time the spirit of science had entered on a new\r\nlife. It remains to trace, under successive statesmen and in the\r\ndoctrine of successive politicians, the fluctuations of English progress\r\ntowards the great Utopia, the state of reconciliation of all the lower\r\nsocial antipathies and interests, and of free scope for the inevitable\r\nbut haply bloodless strifes of ideals, which must needs clash so far as\r\nwe can foresee human affairs. The progress, we shall see, is only in our\r\nown day beginning to be conscious or calculated: it has truly been, so\r\nfar as most of the actors are concerned, by unpath'd waters to undream'd\r\nshores. The hope is that the very recognition of the past course of the\r\nvoyage will establish a new art and a new science of social navigation.\r\n\r\nTo make a new aspiration pass for a law of progress merely because it is\r\nnew would, of course, be only a fresh dressing of old error. There is no\r\nsecurity that the scientific form will make any ideal more viable than\r\nanother; every ideal, after all, has stood for what social science there\r\nwas among its devotees. The hope of a moral transformation of the world\r\nis a state of mind so often seen arising in human history that some\r\ndistrust of it is almost a foregone condition of reflection on any new\r\nideal for thoughtful men. A dream of deliverance pervades the earliest\r\npurposive literature of the Hebrews; a fabled salvation in the past is\r\nmade the ground for trust in one to come. Wherever the sense of present\r\nhardship and suffering outweighs the energetic spirit of life in the\r\nancient world, the young men are found seeing visions, and the old men\r\ndreaming dreams; and the thought of \"the far serenity of Saturn's days\"\r\nbecomes a foothold for the Virgilian hope of a golden age to come. A\r\nhundred times has the hope flowered, and withered again. Confident\r\nrebellions, eager revolutions, mark at once its rise and its fall. In\r\nour own age the new birth of hope arises in the face of what might have\r\nseemed the most definitive frustration; it becomes an ideal of peaceful\r\ntransformation under the sole spell of social science, with no weapons\r\nsave those of reason and persuasion. The science of natural forces has\r\nwidened and varied life without greatly raising it in mass. Yet the new\r\nscience, we would fain believe, will conquer the heightened task. In the\r\nfulfilment or non-fulfilment of that hope lies for the coming age the\r\npractical answer to the riddle of existence.\r\n\r\nWithout such a hope, the study of the past would indeed be desolating to\r\nthe tired spectator. Followed through cycle after cycle of illusory\r\nprogress and conscious decline, all nevertheless as full of pulsation,\r\nof the pride of life and the passion of suffering, as the human tide\r\nthat beats to-day on the shores of our own senses, the history of\r\norganised mankind, in its trivially long-drawn immensity, grows to be\r\nunspeakably disenchanting. Considered as a tale that is told, it seems\r\nto speak of nothing but blind impulse, narrow horizons, insane\r\nsatisfactions in evil achievement, grotesque miscalculation, and vain\r\ndesire, till it is almost a relief to reflect how little we know of it\r\nall, how immeasurable are the crowded distances beyond the reach of our\r\nsearch-light. Alike the known and the unknown, when all is said, figure\r\nfor us as fruitless, purposeless, meaningless moments in some vast,\r\neternal dream.\r\n\r\n   Poi di tanto adoprar, di tanti moti\r\n   D'ogni celeste, ogni terrena cosa\r\n   Girando senza posa,\r\n   Per tornar sempre la donde son mosse;\r\n   Uso alcuno, alcun frutto,\r\n   Indovinar non so.[1243]\r\n\r\nThe untranslatable cadence of Leopardi has the very pulse of the wearied\r\nseeker's spirit. Yet, through all, the fascination of the inquiry holds\r\nus, as if in the insistent craving to understand there lay some of the\r\nsprings of movement towards better days. We brood over the nearer\r\nremains, so near and yet so far, till out of the ruins of Rome there\r\nrise for us in hosts the serried phantoms of her tremendous drama; till\r\nwe seem to catch the very rasp of Cato's voice, and the gleam of Caesar's\r\neye, swaying the tide of things. Still, the sensation yields no sense of\r\nfruition; Rome the dead, and Greece the undying, drift from our reach\r\ninto the desert distance. Beyond their sunlit fragments lies a shoreless\r\nand desolate twilight-land, receding towards the making of the world;\r\nand there in the shadows we dimly divine the wraiths of a million\r\nmillion forms, thronging a hundred civilisations. The vision of that\r\nvanished eternity renews the intolerable burden of the spirit baffled of\r\nall solution. For assuredly, in the remotest vistas of all, men and\r\nwomen desired and loved, and reared their young, and toiled unspeakably,\r\nand wept for their happier dead; and the evening and the morning, then\r\nas now, wove their sad and splendid pageantries with the slow serenity\r\nof cosmic change. Great empires waxed to the power of wreaking infinite\r\nslaughter, through the infinite labour of harmless animal souls; and\r\nseas of blood alternately cemented and sapped their brutal foundations;\r\nand all that remains of them is a tradition of a tradition of their\r\ndestruction, and the shards of their uttermost decay. Not an echo of\r\nthem lives, save where perchance some poet with struggling tongue\r\nmurmurs his dream of them into tremulous form; or when music with its\r\nmore mysterious spell gathers from out the inscrutable vibration of\r\nthings strange semblances of memories, that come to us as an ancient and\r\nlost experience re-won, grey with time and weary with pilgrimage. But to\r\nwhat end, of knowledge or of feeling, if the future is not therefore to\r\nbe changed?\r\n\r\nSave for such a conception and such a purpose, the civilisations of\r\nto-day could have no rational hope to survive in perpetuity any more\r\nthan those of the past. The fullest command of physical science, however\r\ngreat be the resulting power of wealth-production, means no solution of\r\nthe social problem, which must breed its own science. The new ground for\r\nhope is that the great discipline of physical science has brought with\r\nit the twofold conception of the reign of law in all things and the\r\nsequence of power upon comprehension, even to the controlling of the\r\nturbulent sea of human life. With the science of universal evolution has\r\ncome the faith in unending betterment. And this, when all is said, is\r\nthe vital difference between ancient and modern politics: that for the\r\nancients the fact of eternal mutation was a law of defeat and decay,\r\nwhile for us it is a law of renewal. If but the faith be wedded to the\r\nscience, there can be no predictable limit to its fruits, however long\r\nbe the harvesting.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1207: Schanz, _Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 332 ff.
