That the civic\r\nsystem is free from spot or blemish, no one in his senses would\r\npretend to assert.  But it may honestly and truly be asserted that the\r\nCourt of Aldermen have both the power and the inclination to amend\r\nwhatever is defective, and to introduce whatever reforms are\r\ndesirable, without the irritating and officious interference of the\r\nimperial legislature.  The system may not be perfect, for it is of\r\nhuman origin; but its administrators are men of upright character,\r\npractically conversant with the requirements of trade, and animated by\r\nam earnest desire to promote the interests of their fellow-citizens.\r\nWhy, then, are they not intrusted with the honourable task of\r\ngradually improving the machinery of the civic government, and of\r\ncompleting the good work they have long since spontaneously\r\ninaugurated?  It might, perhaps, have been better had this pamphlet\r\nnever taken form and substance.  A feeble advocate endangers, and\r\noftentimes loses, the best possible cause; but still, out of the\r\nfulness of the heart the mouth will speak, and pour forth sentiments\r\nand feelings that no longer brook control.  This, at least, is the only\r\nexcuse that can be offered for troubling the public with the opinions\r\nof a comparative novice.\r\n\r\n7, LEADENHALL STREET, July 26th, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY SKETCH.\r\n\r\nLondon under the Romans\r\nGilds\r\nBurghs\r\nCharter of William the Conqueror\r\nReflections\r\nSubsequent Charters\r\nCity divided into Wards\r\nCivic Hospitality\r\nThe Quo Warranto Case\r\nRestoration of the Charter\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE CORPORATION AS IT IS.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Constitution\r\nThe Lord Mayor\r\nThe Aldermen\r\nThe Court of Common Council\r\nThe Citizens\r\nThe Livery Companies\r\nThe Sheriffs\r\n\r\nThe Law Courts\r\nPublic Charities\r\nConservancy of the Thames\r\nThe Metage Dues\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIC REFORM BILL.\r\n\r\nThe Commission of Inquiry\r\nThe New Wards\r\nAldermen and Common-Councilmen\r\nCity Expenditure\r\nCity Receipts\r\nRemoval of Restrictions\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORPORATION OF LONDON,\r\n\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY SKETCH.\r\n\r\nLondon under the Romans--Gilds--Burghs--Charter of William the\r\nConqueror--Reflections--Subsequent Charters--City divided into\r\nWards--Civic Hospitality--The Quo Warranto Case--Restoration of the\r\nCharter.\r\n\r\nThe first historical notice of the City of London occurs in that\r\nportion of the Annals of Tacitus which treats of the insurrection of\r\nBoadicea.  At that time it was a place much frequented by merchants,\r\nattracted partly by the natural advantages of the site, and partly by\r\nthe vicinity of the Roman camp at Islington.  It is stated that 70,000\r\npersons, of both sexes and of all ages, were massacred by that fierce\r\nheroine in London and at St. Albans; but it must not be supposed that\r\nthe ordinary  population of those two towns could have formed so large\r\nan aggregate.  It is far more probable that numbers of old men, women,\r\nand children flocked thither from the neighbourhood, in the hope of\r\nescaping from the violence and rapine of the patriot army.  Their\r\nexpectations,  however, were disappointed, as the Roman general deemed\r\nit more prudent to evacuate an untenable post, than to risk the\r\ndominion of the entire island on the event of a battle fought under\r\nadverse circumstances.  At the same time the slaughter of the\r\ninhabitants justifies  the inference that they were foreigners rather\r\nthan natives, some being traders from Gaul, but the majority either\r\nRoman colonists or the followers and hangers-on of the stationary\r\ncamp.  Indeed, it may be gathered from the description of Tacitus, that\r\nthese traders were chiefly commissariat contractors and brokers or\r\nmoney-changers.  The Romans do not appear to have evinced a high order\r\nof commercial instinct, nor to have looked upon the development of\r\ntrade as one of the chief objects of government.  Their mission was to\r\noverrun other nations, and to prevent them from indulging in\r\ninternecine  warfare.  To them mankind are therefore indebted for the\r\npreservation of whatever civilization was then extant, and for\r\nstopping the retrogressive course of the human race.  This was\r\nparticularly observable in their conquest of Greece and the kingdoms\r\nof Asia Minor, where incessant quarrels between rival cities and\r\nprincipalities had checked the progress of the arts, sciences, and\r\nliterature.  Content to conquer in battle, and, as the just reward of\r\ntheir superior prowess, to impose tribute and a governor, they seldom\r\ninterfered with local customs and usages.  Perhaps one great secret of\r\ntheir marvellous success was this systematic abstinence from\r\nintermeddling with the local administrations.  The principle of\r\nself-government  was never more fully appreciated than by this\r\nremarkable people, who, sending forth consuls, vice-consuls,  and\r\nprefects, yet left to the conquered the management of  their own\r\naffairs and the guardianship of their own interests.  Not even in the\r\nmost corrupt days of the empire was it attempted to absorb the\r\npatronage of every department and province for the benefit of a few,\r\nunder the pretext of imparting greater vigour to the administration of\r\npublic affairs by centralization.  It was not deemed wise or necessary\r\nto constitute central boards for the direction of matters with which\r\nnot a single member might, possibly, be acquainted.  They did not aim\r\nat an ideal perfection, but were satisfied with doing what was\r\npracticable, and with a large average of general prosperity.  To each\r\ncivitas--corresponding to our phrase of \"city and county\"--was\r\nassigned the regulation of its own domestic policy, by means of annual\r\nmagistrates, a chosen senate, and the general assembly of the free\r\ninhabitants.  Through this wise policy of non-interference, the City of\r\nLondon rapidly acquired wealth and importance, and before the\r\nevacuation of the island by the Romans, had attained a position of\r\nconsiderable grandeur.  The civic institutions of the Saxons were,\r\nindeed, admirably suited for the adaptation of the municipal customs\r\nbequeathed to them by their predecessors, and which became developed\r\nto their full proportions through the greater amount of individual\r\nliberty that prevailed among the Germanic races.\r\n\r\nOf the purely Teutonic institutions, one of the most characteristic\r\nwas that of Gilds.  Originally, a gild was nothing more than an\r\nassociation of ten families, for purposes of mutual protection and\r\nsecurity.  By the custom of \"frankpledge,\" every freeman at the age of\r\nfourteen was called upon to give securities for his good behaviour.\r\nGilds were therefore formed, binding themselves to produce the\r\noffender if any breach of the peace was committed by one of their\r\nmembers, or to give redress to the injured party.  To carry out these\r\nobjects a small fund was raised, to which every one contributed; and\r\nthence was derived the name of the association: \"gildan,\" in Saxon,\r\nsignifying to pay.  With a view to becoming better acquainted with one\r\nanother, and to draw more closely the bands of friendship, convivial\r\nmeetings were held at fixed periods, when a vast quantity of beer was\r\nquaffed in honour of the living, and to the memory of the dead.  In\r\nafter-times this truly Saxon institution assumed greater proportions,\r\nand embraced both ecclesiastical and secular gilds.  Of the former it\r\nis unnecessary to make further mention, but the latter formed the germ\r\nof the present livery companies.  The earlier secular or mercantile\r\ngilds were associations of members of a particular trade or craft, for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining and advancing the privileges of their\r\npeculiar calling.  The term was also applied to a district or \"soke,\"\r\npossessed of independent franchises, as in the case of the Portsoken\r\nWard, which was anciently known as the Cnighten Gild.  A \"soke,\" or\r\nsoca, it may be incidentally observed, was the territory in which was\r\nexercised the soca, or the privilege of hearing causes and disputes,\r\nlevying fines, and administering justice within certain limits.\r\nThe practice of gildating or embodying the aggregate free population\r\nof a town was of considerably later date.  In France and in Flanders,\r\ncorporations and communes, or commonalties, appear to have existed in\r\nthe middle of the eleventh century, but the earliest mention of the\r\nCorporation of London occurs in the second year of the reign of\r\nRichard I.  Availing himself of the king's absence in the Holy Land,\r\nhis brother John, Earl of Moreton, anxious to acquire the co-operation\r\nof the city of London in his traitorous designs upon the crown,\r\nconvened a general assembly of the citizens, and confirmed their\r\nancient rights and privileges by a formal deed or charter.  It was\r\nthen, for the first time, that the commonalty of the city was\r\nregularly and officially recognized as a corporate body.  The\r\ndistinctive rights of a town corporation were the election of a\r\ncouncil presided over by a mayor or bailiff, a common seal, a bell to\r\nconvoke the citizens, and local jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nBut although it was not before the reign of Richard I. that the\r\ncitizens of London were formed into a body corporate, they had\r\nenjoyed, as the inhabitants of a free burgh, the immunities and many\r\nessential privileges of a corporation, from the time of Edward the\r\nConfessor, if not of Alfred.  Without stopping to discuss the etymology\r\nof the word \"burgh,\" it may suffice to observe that at the period of\r\nthe Conquest by far the greater part of the cities and towns of\r\nEngland were the private property of the king, or of some spiritual or\r\nsecular lord, on whom they had been conferred by royal grant.  These\r\nburghs, as they were called, were said to be held in demesne, and paid\r\nto their superior certain tolls, duties, and customs, levied on goods\r\nexposed for sale at markets and fairs.  The inhabitants were actually\r\nlittle better than villeins or serfs, and were entirely at the mercy\r\nof their feudal lord.  Immense, therefore, were the advantages\r\npossessed by the free burghs, such as London, which governed\r\nthemselves, and compounded for all dues by the payment of a fixed\r\nannual sum.  These annual contributions were styled the \"farm,\" and,\r\nwhen perpetual, the burghs so compounding were said to be held at\r\nfee-farm of the king in capite, as was the case with London.  One of\r\nthe chief privileges implied by this tenure was that of exercising an\r\nindependent jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, administered by\r\nmagistrates chosen by the burgesses.  It is supposed that criminal law\r\nwas originally dispensed in the free gilds into which the city was\r\ndivided, under the presidency of an alderman.  These divisions were\r\nafterwards called wards, and were analogous to the corresponding\r\ndivision of the shire into hundreds.  In each ward was held a\r\ncourt-leet, or ward-mote, dating from the time of Alfred, though the\r\nactual institution of wards by that name is no later than the reign of\r\nEdward I. Civil causes, in London at least, were tried before a\r\npeculiar tribunal, the president of which was probably the portreve,\r\nor, in minor causes, an alderman.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest naturally suspended for a time all these\r\nprivileges, and reduced all free towns to the level of burghs in\r\ndemesne.  Desirous, however, to secure the good will of the citizens,\r\nWilliam hastened to assure them of his protection, and to confirm\r\ntheir prescriptive rights and immunities.  Thus ran the gracious\r\nexpression of the royal pleasure:--\"William the king greets William\r\nthe bishop, and Godfrey the portreve, and all the burghers within\r\nLondon, French and English, friendly.  And I make known to you that I\r\nwill that ye be law-worthy, as ye were in the days of King Edward.\r\nAnd I will, that each child be his father's heir after his father's\r\ndays. And I will not suffer that any man command you any wrong.\r\nGod keep you.\"\r\n\r\nThe import of this charter was to make the citizens \"free tenants,\"\r\nreserving to the king the seigniory, or proprietary title.  The epithet\r\n\"law-worthy\" is equivalent to a declaration that they were freemen,\r\nfor in the feudal ages none other were entitled to the forms of law;\r\nwhile the right of heirship apparently exempted them from the rule of\r\nprimogeniture which prevailed among the Norman conquerors;--it is\r\nprobable, however, that this exemption did not long hold good.\r\nIn other respects the citizens of London continued to be governed by\r\ntheir own laws and usages, administered by their own magistrates after\r\nthe ancient and established forms.  A nucleus of liberty was thus\r\npreserved amidst the tyrannical usurpations of the Norman barons, and\r\nthe bold burgesses many a time stoutly resisted the encroachments that\r\nwere attempted to be made on their hereditary rights.  At all periods\r\nof English history, indeed, have the citizens of London stepped\r\nforward as the champions of freedom, and shown themselves the\r\nincorruptible guardians of the public interests.  Never at any time,\r\nhowever, was there greater necessity for a sturdy bulwark against the\r\ngrowing power of the oligarchy than at the present moment.  Little by\r\nlittle--or, rather, by rapid strides--does the Government seek to get\r\nwithin its grasp the control of every department of the commonwealth.\r\nTo-day, the East-India Company is abolished, for the sake of the\r\n\"better government of India;\" to-morrow, the Corporation is to be\r\n\"reformed,\" for the \"better government\" of the City; the day after,\r\nsome other long-established institution will be swept away.\r\nThere is nothing so repugnant to a ministry as whatever savours of\r\nself-government; for how.  in that case can the \"Dowbs\" be provided\r\nfor? So long as the citizens manage their own affairs, there is no\r\npatronage at the disposal of ministers to bestow on a faithful or a\r\nwavering partisan.  Young \"honourables\" and other needy scions of the\r\ngoverning classes have little ambition to undertake civic duties,\r\nwhile they are only onerous and expensive.  Let the wedge be first\r\napplied.  Let \"reform\" worm its way into the constitution of the\r\nCorporation, and then by degrees the whole edifice may gradually be\r\nsubverted.  Stipendiary magistracies and paid offices of any kind,\r\nif not too laborious, are always acceptable for sons, nephews, cousins,\r\nand influential supporters.  The danger from this quarter is in truth\r\ngreater than when Norman William had the island prostrate at his feet,\r\nand when the liberties of the City hung upon his word.  That word went\r\nforth to save and to preserve.  The stern warrior respected the rights\r\nof the industrious burgesses, and by his wisdom paved the way for the\r\nfuture greatness of the metropolis.  But theoretical and doctrinaire\r\nstatesmen are willing to risk all for the sake of consistency to\r\ncertain arbitrary first principles, which do not apply to the spirit\r\nof the British people.\r\n\r\nThe charter of William the Conqueror, the reader will have remarked,\r\nalludes in a very general manner to the liberties and privileges\r\nenjoyed by the City.  The first detailed and specific notice of their\r\ncharacter occurs in the charter of Henry I.  In the early part of his\r\nreign, being anxious to fix himself securely in his seat, the usurper\r\nconveyed, or confirmed, a grant to the citizens to hold Middlesex to\r\nfarm for the yearly rental of 300 pounds; to appoint their own sheriff\r\nand their own justiciar; to be exempt from various burdensome and\r\nvexatious taxes in force in other parts of the kingdom; to be free\r\nfrom all denominations of tolls, customs, passage, and lestage,\r\nthroughout the kingdom and along the seaboard; and to possess many\r\nother equally important privileges.  This valuable charter was renewed\r\nby King Stephen, during whose stormy and troubled reign the metropolis\r\nenjoyed a degree of prosperity unknown to the rest of the kingdom.\r\nThe comparative peace and security which distinguished the happy lot of\r\nthe citizens of London, have been justly attributed to the maintenance\r\nof their ancient institutions, which may be said to have grown out of\r\nthe habits, requirements, thoughts, and feelings characteristic of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race.  Nor were the Londoners unconscious of their power,\r\nor ungrateful to their benefactor.  It was chiefly through their\r\ninfluence and exertions that the empress was finally driven out of the\r\nkingdom, and Stephen established on the throne.  Henry II. confirmed\r\nthe purport of preceding charters, and added some further immunities,\r\nconcluding with the declaration that their ancient customs and\r\nliberties were to be held as of inheritance from the king and his\r\nheirs.  They became, therefore, the property of the citizens, and were\r\nbequeathed from father to son, as a cherished heirloom.  It is true\r\nthat under Richard I. they were exposed to some extortion, for which\r\nthey received ample amends during the reign of his weak and inglorious\r\nsuccessor.  Not only did they obtain five different charters\r\nconfirmatory of their ancient privileges, together with the\r\nrestoration of the sheriffwick, usurped by the last three monarchs,\r\nbut also the first formal recognition of the mayoralty.  These favours,\r\nhowever, did not render them untrue to the general interests of the\r\nnation, or betray them into a corrupt acquiescence with the absolute\r\ntendencies of the Crown.  At that time, as at all others, while duly\r\nreverencing the royal prerogatives, they resolutely opposed themselves\r\nto the undue aggrandizement of the kingly power at the expense of the\r\nother estates of the realm.  It was within the precincts of the City,\r\nat the metropolitan church of St. Paul's, that the articles of Magma\r\nCharta were first proposed and accepted by acclamation, the citizens\r\nbinding themselves by oath to defend and enforce them with their\r\nlives.  Nor was it for themselves alone that they were prepared to shed\r\ntheir blood.  Their solicitude extended to all other cities and towns\r\nthroughout the kingdom, for the preservation of whose free customs and\r\nimmunities they expressly stipulated.  During the long feeble reign of\r\nHenry III., no fewer than ten charters were granted to the citizens of\r\nLondon.  In the thirty-first year of that monarch, the mayor and\r\ncommonalty of the City of London are mentioned for the first time as a\r\ncorporate body, possessing a common seal.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Edward I. was rendered memorable for the convocation of\r\nthe first parliament of the freely-elected representatives of the\r\npeople, for the purpose of voting the supplies necessary for the\r\nconduct of public affairs.  Previously to this, grants of money were\r\nusually obtained through the personal influence of the barons over the\r\ncities and towns held in demesne.  The burgesses, however, did not sit\r\nwith the knights of shires, but apart by themselves, and, through\r\nloyalty or obsequiousness, assessed themselves in a contribution\r\nnearly one third greater than that granted by the barons and knights.\r\nThe convenient precedent was not overlooked, and it became henceforth\r\ncustomary to expect the like liberality from subsequent parliaments.\r\nAt this period, also, the principal divisions of the city were first\r\ndenominated wards; these wards were presided over by an alderman,\r\nassisted by a council chosen by the inhabitants of each division.  In\r\nthe twelfth year of his reign, Edward, incensed by what he considered\r\nthe disrespectful conduct of the civic magistrates, disfranchised the\r\ncity, and governed it for twelve years through means of a custos.\r\nThe experiment, however, did not answer, and the king was glad to\r\nrestore the liberties of the City on payment of a heavy fine.\r\nAt a later period, the mayor and sheriffs successfully resisted a\r\nsecond attempt to infringe on the privileges of the citizens.\r\nUnder the second Edward, London continued to maintain its ascendancy\r\nover all the other cities in the kingdom, and it was now for the first\r\ntime authentically ordained, that no person should be held to enjoy\r\ncivic freedom unless he were a member of some trade or \"mystery,\"\r\nor admitted by full assent of the commonalty assembled.\r\n\r\nTwo remarkable incidents marked the reign of Edward III. in connection\r\nwith the City of London; the Lord Mayor was now constituted, by royal\r\ncharter, one of the judges of oyer and terminer and gaol-delivery at\r\nNewgate.  The ancient trading gilds also became developed into the\r\npresent livery companies, so called, because a peculiar uniform was\r\nchosen by each.  They were then likewise denominated crafts or mysteries,\r\ntheir president being styled a warden; the title of alderman being now\r\nreserved for the chief magistrates of wards.  It may, too, be worthy\r\nof note that, in the 28th year of this reign the city serjeants\r\nreceived permission, when engaged in their official duties, and on\r\ngreat ceremonial occasions, to bear maces of gold or silver, with the\r\nroyal or other arms thereon.  We are told that this was considered a\r\nmost flattering distinction, and that the mace-bearer, by virtue of\r\nhis office, was deemed an esquire.\r\n\r\nSo gladly did our valiant and victorious kings of the olden times\r\navail themselves of every opportunity to do honour to the liberality,\r\ncourage, and fidelity of the wealthy and intelligent burgesses of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nAfter various unsuccessful attempts to establish a representative form\r\nof government, it was at length decided, in the seventh year of\r\nRichard II., at a special convocation of the whole community of\r\ncitizens, that there should be both a deliberative and an elective\r\nassembly.  The latter, of course, consisted of the aggregate body of\r\ncitizens, anciently designated immensa communitas, or folkmote, who\r\nwere annually to elect four persons at the wardmote for each ward to\r\nrepresent the commonalty on all occasions of a deliberative nature.\r\nDuring the early part of this reign the City of London had no reason\r\nto complain of any lack of royal favour.  Afterwards, however, Richard\r\nwas guilty of many attempts at extortion, and even seized upon the\r\nfranchises of the City, on the pretext of a riot, notwithstanding that\r\nthe first charter of his grandfather, Edward III., had debarred such\r\nforfeiture as the consequence of individual misconduct.  These acts of\r\noppression very naturally and justly alienated the attachment of the\r\nLondoners, and prepared them to give a hearty welcome to Bolingbroke.\r\nThis good-feeling was maintained throughout the reign of Henry IV., who\r\ntestified his gratitude by the grant of several valuable privileges.\r\nA like cordial understanding between the citizens and their sovereign\r\nexisted under Henry V., and the City, in consequence, increased in\r\nopulence, population, and influence.  Guildhall was built, and the\r\nstreets were lighted at night by public lanterns.  The halcyon days,\r\nhowever, of the City of London must be referred to the reign of the\r\nfourth Edward.  The citizens never wavered in their attachment to his\r\nfortunes, nor did that gay and gallant monarch ever exhibit any\r\ncoldness of feeling--at least, towards their fair dames.  Of Richard III.\r\nit is unnecessary to speak, and even of Henry VII there is little\r\nto be said, save that he never omitted an opportunity of fleecing the\r\ncitizens and replenishing his exchequer.\r\n\r\nUnder Henry VIII. the City of London earned the honourable distinction\r\nof being the only body of men in the realm who dared to resist the\r\nking's systematic abuse of the royal power.  Henry had revived the\r\nunconstitutional practice of imposing taxes without the consent of the\r\nCommons; but the citizens opposed his illegal demands with such\r\nresolution that he was compelled to desist for the time and to proceed\r\nwith greater caution for the future.  Another distinguishing feature of\r\nthis reign was the profuse extravagance of the citizens on ceremonial\r\noccasions.  The chronicles of the period teem with marvellous\r\ndescriptions of the pomp and pageantry displayed whenever a royal or\r\nillustrious personage honoured the City with a visit.  In modern times\r\nthis semi-barbarous love of ostentation has been superseded by a\r\ngenial and dignified hospitality, that has tended in no slight degree\r\nto increase the fame and influence of that important quarter of the\r\nmetropolis.  Each successive sovereign of this great empire has\r\naccepted with grateful pride the magnificent demonstrations of loyalty\r\ntendered by the faithful burgesses.  Foreign potentates and ambassadors\r\nhave equally deemed it an honour to receive the congratulations of\r\nthese princely traders at their sumptuous banquets, celebrated\r\nthroughout the world.  The ministers of the day feel their position to\r\nbe insecure until it has been ratified by the acclamations of the\r\ncitizens, and the hospitable attentions of the civic magistrates.\r\nStatesmen and warriors, poets and historians, men of thought and men\r\nof action, are all stimulated to exertion by the honourable hope of\r\nbeing distinguished by the burgesses of London, and enrolled in the\r\nlists of freemen.  On such occasions the city magnates hold high\r\nfestival, and by their graceful hospitality inspire every breast with\r\ngenerous sympathy.  Formal and priggish persons are said to exist who\r\nobject to the cost of such entertainments, and, in the spirit of\r\nJudas, ask why, instead of purchasing these dainty cates, the money is\r\nnot distributed among the poor.  Is it possible that they do not\r\nperceive that every farthing spent on these stately banquets finds its\r\nway into general circulation, benefiting almost every branch of trade,\r\nand giving employment to thousands of artisans? To hear them speak,\r\none would suppose that the cook and the butler alone profited by such\r\noccasions, whereas it is strictly and literally true that not a single\r\ngala takes place in the City without the circulating medium\r\npercolating through every warehouse, magazine, shop, and stall within\r\nthe Bills of Mortality.  Independently of this consideration, these\r\ncivic feasts are symbols of those great old Saxon institutions which\r\nhave made England the home and guardian of liberty.  Our hearty and\r\nlarge-souled ancestors never dreamed of weighing every miserable coin,\r\nor of stinting the measure of their generous wines or foaming ale.\r\nThey gave not less to the poor because they delighted to honour the\r\nbrave and good, or to greet one another in the loving cup.  Unlike the\r\ncoldly intellectual reformers and theorists of the present day, they\r\ndid not consider the gaol and the workhouse as the only asylums for\r\npoverty.  They were men of feeling and kindly impulse, not of abstract\r\nprinciples.  They gave their cheerful alms to the mendicants, and\r\nspread a bounteous board for their neighbours.  Fools that they were!\r\nHow is it that they did not recognize the mendicant to be an impostor\r\nand a drone, or bethink them that the money with which they feasted\r\ntheir neighbour might have purchased a field? It was because they were\r\nwarm-hearted, warm-blooded men, and not mere calculating machines.\r\nThey were glorious creatures, with thews and sinews, and they made\r\ntheir country great and powerful among the nations of the world; but\r\nthey never paused to denounce the cost of a dinner, or to grudge a\r\nflowing bowl to their kinsfolk and neighbours.  Besides, our Pharisees\r\nof reform conveniently forget that the copious banquets at which they\r\nturn up their envious eyes are mostly defrayed from private funds.\r\nThe sheriffs, for instance, derive no aid from public moneys; their own\r\nfortunes provide the means for handsomely entertaining friends and\r\nstrangers, and for dispensing open-handed charity.  The Lord Mayor\r\nhimself almost invariably draws upon his own resources to a large\r\namount, in order to maintain the ancient reputation and actual present\r\ninfluence of the City of London.  Demolish Gog and Magog, put down the\r\ncivic banquets, break up and melt down the weighty and many-linked\r\nchains of solid gold round the neck of my lord mayor and the sheriffs,\r\nstrip off the aldermen's gowns, make a bonfire of the gilded\r\ncarriages, wring, if you will, the necks of both swans and cygnets.\r\nIt is all vanity and vexation.  Man is an intellectual animal: he wants\r\nnone of these gewgaws.  Alas! Wisdom may cry aloud in the streets, but\r\nno one will heed her words if she speaks beyond his comprehension.\r\nIn theory, these Pecksniffs of retrenchment might possibly be correct\r\nif mankind had attained the same degree of marble indifference with\r\nthemselves.  In the mean time, while we are honest and true, it is good\r\nto be merry and wise.\r\n\r\nPassing lightly over the intervening reigns, we now arrive at that of\r\nJames I., who granted three very valuable charters to the Corporation\r\nof London.  The first alludes to the immemorial right of the mayor and\r\ncommonalty to the conservancy of the Thames, and to the metage of all\r\ncoals, grain, salt, fruit, vegetables, and other merchandise sold by\r\nmeasure, delivered at the port of London.  Of the exact nature of these\r\nprivileges and of their beneficial operation, so far as public\r\ninterests are concerned, we shall have occasion to speak hereafter,\r\nmerely premising in this place that they have been enjoyed \"from time\r\nwhereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.\" The second\r\ncharter, after confirming former liberties, enlarges the limits of the\r\ncivic jurisdiction and ordains that the mayor, recorder, and two\r\naldermen, shall be justices of oyer and terminer.  The third one is\r\nsimply an amplification of the preceding two, and clears up various\r\ndoubts as to the weighing and measuring of coals: both offices are\r\ngranted or confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe tyrannical and oppressive treatment of the citizens of London by\r\nCharles I. is too well known to need more than a passing allusion.\r\nNot only did he imprison the aldermen for refusing to act dishonourably\r\ntowards their fellow-citizens; not only did he make illegal demands\r\nand impose arbitrary fines, but he even deprived them of the right of\r\npetition and remonstrance.  Such despotic conduct could not do\r\notherwise than alienate the affection of those who had previously\r\ndisplayed many proofs of their loyalty to the Crown and attachment to\r\nthe royal person.  The City consequently made common cause with the\r\nParliament, freely expending both blood and treasure in defence of the\r\nnational freedom.  Who has mot read with kindling cheeks how the bold\r\n'prentices, armed only with spears, withstood a furious charge of the\r\nfiery Rupert at the head of his gallant cavaliers?  But though prepared\r\nto resist the abuse of the royal prerogative, the citizens were not\r\ndisposed to transfer their allegiance to a usurper, who, in the name\r\nof liberty, trampled liberty under foot.  Accordingly we find them\r\nconsistently opposed to the military absolutism of Cromwell, and among\r\nthe first to co-operate with Monk in effecting the restoration to the\r\nthrone of the royal line of Stuart.\r\n\r\nThe Stuarts, however, like the Bourbons, were incapable of benefiting\r\nby the lessons of adversity.  It was not long before \"the merry\r\nmonarch\" was involved in most unmirthful disputes with the citizens,\r\nwhom he endeavoured to deprive of their ancient right to elect their\r\nown sheriffs.  For the moment he partially succeeded, and, encouraged\r\nby this success, formed the design of seizing the charters of every\r\ncorporate borough in the kingdom.  The chief difficulty rested with\r\nLondon: if that could be overcome, the smaller cities would fall an\r\neasy prey.  The law officers of the Crown were accordingly instructed\r\nto make out a case to sanction the forfeiture of the city charters.\r\nA double pretext was soon invented.  It was stated that nine years\r\nbefore, the Common Council had levied a new scale of tolls on the\r\npublic markets rebuilt after the great fire, and at a more recent\r\nperiod had printed a libellous petition impugning the king's justice.\r\nOn these slender pleas a writ of quo warranto was taken out against\r\nthe City, and the judges, under the undoubted influence of the Court,\r\npronounced sentence of forfeiture, although a charter of the 7th\r\nRichard II. expressly provides against any forfeiture of the City's\r\nliberties notwithstanding any abuse of them whatsoever.  This\r\nexhibition of violence so terrified the other corporations of the\r\nkingdom, that most of them at once tendered the surrender of their\r\nfranchises, with the ignominious hope of obtaining better terms for\r\nthemselves.  James II. walked in the steps of his brother, and showed\r\neven greater determination to destroy the liberties of the nation.\r\nThe disaffection of his subjects and the landing of the Prince of Orange\r\nwarned him, when too late, that he had gone too far.  Anxious to make\r\nfriends in his hour of extremest peril, he despatched the infamous\r\nJefferies to Guildhall to announce the restoration of the ancient\r\nprivileges of the City.  But the citizens were not thus to be cajoled.\r\nNo sooner had the king set out to join his forces, than the Court of\r\nAldermen declared themselves in favour of the Prince of Orange, as the\r\nchampion of civil and religious freedom.  The Lord Mayor, the aldermen,\r\nand fifty common councillors, had a seat and voice in the convention\r\nwhich pronounced the deposition of James, and the elevation to the\r\nthrone of William and Mary.  The first act of the nation was to\r\nestablish and perpetuate a constitutional form of government, and this\r\nwas accomplished by passing the famous statute known as the Bill of\r\nRights.  Experience had proved the vital importance of placing the\r\nprivileges of the City of London beyond the caprice of the sovereign\r\nand the possibility of a coup d'etat.  It was therefore declared by\r\nParliament that the judgment passed on the quo warranto of Charles II.\r\nwas unjust and illegal, and that all the proceedings in the case were\r\ninformal and void.  It was further enacted, \"that the mayor,\r\ncommonalty, and citizens, should for ever thereafter remain a body\r\ncorporate and politic, without any seizure or forejudger, or being\r\nthereof excluded or ousted, upon any pretence of forfeiture or\r\nmisdemeanour whatsoever, theretofore or thereafter to be done,\r\ncommitted, or suffered.\" The constitution of the corporation was\r\nnevertheless subsequently violated by the statute of 11 Geo. I., which\r\nconferred on the livery the elective franchises exercised in common\r\nhall.  By a still more recent act, 12 & 13 Victoria, the right of\r\nvoting in the election of aldermen and common councilmen has been\r\nfurther extended and enlarged.  It was then enacted that that privilege\r\nshould belong to every freeman of the City rated at 10 pounds per annum\r\nto the police or any other rate, and registered among the voters for the\r\ncity of London at elections of members to serve in Parliament.  Still\r\ngreater innovations are now in contemplation, in violation of law and\r\nusage, and in defiance of prescriptive right, royal charters, and\r\nparliamentary statutes.\r\n\r\nAudax omnia perpeti, Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.*\r\n\r\n* The materials for this slight sketch have been gathered from\r\nNorton's \"History and Franchises of the City of London;\" Dr. Brady's\r\nlearned dissertation on Boroughs; and Herbert's \"History of the Twelve\r\nLivery Companies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE CORPORATION AS IT IS.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Constitution--Lord Mayor--Aldermen--Court of Common\r\nCouncil--Citizens--The Livery Companies--Sheriffs--Law Courts--Public\r\nCharities--Conservancy of the Thames--Metage Dues.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding hasty sketch it has been attempted to trace the rise\r\nof London from being the bazaar to a Roman camp to its present\r\nposition as the capital of the commercial world.  It is now worth while\r\nto glance at the nature of the municipal institutions through which it\r\nhas attained such a proud ascendancy.*\r\n\r\n* The authority chiefly consulted for the following statements is\r\nPulling's \"Practical Treatise on the Laws, Customs, Usages, and\r\nRegulations of the City and Port of London.\"\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, London cannot be said to possess any original\r\ncharter, or specific definition of its rights and franchises.  Those\r\nconferred since the Conquest, without exception, allude directly or\r\nindirectly to preceding documents of a similar nature.  In fact the\r\ncustoms and usages of the City grew out of the ancient Saxon\r\ninstitutions, grafted, as they were, on the Roman municipal stock.\r\nThe City of London represents a county, and as such is divided into\r\nhundreds, called wards; each having its own wardmote, presided over by\r\nits own alderman.  The Lord Mayor, the Court of Aldermen, and the\r\nCourt of Common Council, together with the incorporated guilds which\r\nelect the civic magistrates, form the municipal constitution.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the chief civic magistrate was styled the Reve,\r\nor Portreve, but in 1207 John changed this title to that of Mayor.\r\nThe appellation of Lord was first prefixed in the fourth charter of\r\nEdward III., when the honour of having gold or silver maces borne\r\nbefore him was conferred on the \"Lord Mayor,\" who ranked moreover as\r\nan earl.  His duties are multiplex and ubiquitous.  In his own person\r\nhe represents all the rights and privileges of the Corporation.  He is\r\nsaid to hold the same relation to the City as the Crown does to the\r\nrest of the kingdom.  He is chief butler at the coronation of the\r\nsovereign, lord-lieutenant of the county of London, clerk of the\r\nmarkets, gauger of wine and oil, meter of coals and grain, salt and\r\nfruit, conservator of the Thames, admiral of the port, justice of gaol\r\ndelivery for Newgate, chairman of every committee he attends, and\r\nsubject to many other burdens.  The election of Lord Mayor takes place\r\non the 29th September, when the livery usually nominate the two senior\r\naldermen who have not passed the chair; of these the senior is generally\r\nchosen by the Court of Aldermen.  The chain of office is then placed\r\nround his neck, and he himself presented to the Lord Chancellor.\r\nHe does not, however, immediately enter upon his important duties,\r\nbut remains in a chrysalis form, under the title of Lord Mayor elect,\r\nuntil the 8th of November, when he takes the oath of office, at the\r\nGuildhall, and on the following day is presented to the Barons of the\r\nExchequer, at Westminster, for the confirmation of the Crown.\r\nThe annual salary is 8,000 pounds, which rarely suffices to meet the\r\nincessant demands on the Lord Mayor's charity and hospitality.\r\nHe is expected to contribute to every charitable institution within\r\nhis jurisdiction, and to a great many beyond it, and to head every\r\nsubscription for praiseworthy purposes.  His private alms also amount\r\nto a very large sum, and his hospitality is proverbial.\r\nHe represents, in short, the best phase of the old feudal baron,\r\nor rather of the Saxon eorl, exercising a paternal and beneficient\r\nsupervision over all who reside within the limits of his authority.\r\n\r\nThe Aldermen.\r\n\r\nAmong the Anglo-Saxons the title of alderman was regarded as one of\r\nthe most honourable distinctions to which a freeman could aspire.\r\nAfter a time, however, it was conferred with somewhat too liberal\r\ncourtesy on nearly every individual vested with authority.\r\nThe presidents of district guilds were especially known by this\r\ndesignation, which they afterwards monopolized when the guilds became\r\nraised into wards or hundreds of the city.  The aldermen then partially\r\nrecovered their former dignity, and in the charter of Henry I. are\r\nmentioned as barons.  The position and authority of an alderman, though\r\nthey have much declined since the olden times, are still a reasonable\r\nobject of ambition.  He is a justice of the peace, as well as the\r\npresiding officer of his ward, and, by virtue of his office, a member\r\nof the Court of Common Council; but it is rather in their collective\r\nthan their individual capacity that their power and usefulness are\r\nmost conspicuous.  Independently of their judicial duties, the Court of\r\nAldermen constitute the executive department of the Corporation; with\r\nthem rests the cognizance of the return of every civic officer elected\r\nat a wardmote court, and also of the election of common-councillors.\r\nThey swear in brokers and other officers, and investigate the validity\r\nof claims to civic freedom.  For the proper discharge of these and\r\nsimilar duties, they are singularly adapted through their local\r\nknowledge, which is likewise of material service to her Majesty's\r\njudges at the Central Criminal Court.  This circumstance further\r\nrenders them most efficient as city magistrates,--far more so,\r\nindeed, than any police or stipendiary magistrate could ever hope to be.\r\nPersonally acquainted with the inhabitants of their respective\r\nwards, they are in a position to obtain peculiar and authentic\r\ninformation as to the characters, habits, and motives of witnesses,\r\naccusers, and accused.  Their devotion to public business is wholly\r\ndisinterested, for there are no pecuniary emoluments attached to the\r\noffice, which has truly little to recommend it, save as being a sphere\r\nof active utility, and as a gratifying token of the good-will of one's\r\nfellow-citizens.  The proper style of the Court is the \"Court of the\r\nMayor and Aldermen in the Inner Chamber.\" It consists of the Lord\r\nMayor or his deputy--an alderman who has passed the chair--and not\r\nless than twelve other aldermen.  The proceedings of the Court are\r\nentered in journals called \"Repertories,\" which are kept in the\r\nmuniment-room.  The Recorder, the Steward of Southwark, the Clerk to\r\nthe Lord Mayor, the keepers, governors, chaplains, and surgeons of the\r\ndifferent prisons, and other officers of the Corporation, are elected\r\nby this Court, which, for assiduity, intelligence, and\r\nincorruptibility, yields to no body of men in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nCourt of Common Council.\r\n\r\nBut however distinguished may be the civic position, however great the\r\nmoral influence, of the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen, the\r\ncontrolling power is, after all, centred in the Common Council.  At a\r\nvery remote period the freemen of the City were accustomed to meet in\r\ngeneral assembly, and to act as one body.  As their numbers increased,\r\nthe many inconveniences of such a mode of proceeding soon became\r\nmanifest; and so early as the reign of the first Edward\r\nrepresentatives began to be chosen from each ward for the despatch of\r\nreal business.  At first the guilds, or trading companies, claimed the\r\nright of election as their exclusive privilege, and consequently\r\nexcited the jealousy of the mass of the inhabitants.  It was therefore\r\narranged that the men of each guild or \"mystery\" should choose their\r\nown delegates from among themselves, and this was the more easily\r\naccomplished, as at that time each craft occupied a separate quarter,\r\nas is still the custom in the East.  This arrangement, however, was of\r\nbrief duration, and a more permanent settlement was effected in the\r\nreign of Richard II.  It was then agreed that every ward should\r\nannually elect four of the most efficient persons in the ward to sit\r\nin the Common Council for the following year, and whose names should\r\nbe presented to the mayor --that high functionary being charged to\r\naccept no more than eight members of any one \"mystery\" for the whole\r\ncity.  As the wards varied in extent and population, it was further\r\nagreed that the larger wards should return six councillors, and the\r\nsmaller four or two, according to their sufficiency.  The number of the\r\nCommon Council was then fixed at 96 members, but gradually increased\r\nto the present number of 206, who are chosen as follows:-\r\n\r\nBassishaw and Lime Street each return 4; Dowgate, Candlewick,\r\nCordwainers, Cornhill, Queenhithe, Vintry, and Walbrook, 6; Bread\r\nStreet, Bridge, Billingsgate, Broad Street, Cheap, Coleman Street,\r\nCripplegate Within, and Cripplegate Without, Tower, Langbourn, Castle\r\nBaynard, Aldersgate, Aldgate, and Portsoken, 8; Bishopsgate and\r\nFarringdon-within, 14; and Farringdon-without, 16.  These true\r\nrepresentatives of the citizens constitute the Court of Common\r\nCouncil, under the style and title of \"Court of the Lord Mayor,\r\nAldermen, and Commoners of the City of London in Common Council\r\nassembled.\" It requires the presence of the Lord Mayor, or his\r\ndeputy--an alderman who has passed the chair--two aldermen and\r\nthirty-eight common councilmen, to make a quorum.  There are usually\r\ntwelve ordinary meetings in the year, and on an average thirteen\r\nextraordinary meetings, convened for special purposes by a requisition\r\nto the Lord Mayor signed by seven members.  The proceedings are\r\nconducted as nearly as possible according to the routine of the House\r\nof Commons, and embrace a vast variety of subjects of local and\r\nsometimes national importance.  The Court has a double function\r\n--legislative and executive.  In the former capacity it enacts by-laws\r\nfor the better government of the Corporation, in conformity with\r\nimmemorial usage confirmed by 15 Edward III., and again more recently\r\nand fully by the Municipal Corporations Act.  The charter of Edward III.\r\nauthorizes the mayor and aldermen, with the assent of the commonalty,\r\n\"where any customs theretofore used and obtained proved hard or\r\ndefective, or any matters newly arising within the City needed\r\namendment, and no remedy had been previously provided, to apply and\r\nordain a convenient remedy, as often as it should seem expedient; so\r\nthat the same were agreeable to good faith and reason, for the common\r\nadvantage of the citizens, and other liege subjects sojourning with\r\nthem, and useful to king and people.\" Vested with such powers as\r\nthese, the Corporation of London are clearly competent to introduce\r\nwhatever reforms circumstances may render desirable.  As practical men\r\nof business, the Court of Common Council may fairly be supposed to be\r\nthe best judges as to the nature of the amendments to be made, and the\r\nright time of making them.  Persons engaged in commercial pursuits are\r\nnot usually obstructive, or opposed to useful innovations.  On the\r\ncontrary, being wedded to no theories, they are constantly impelled to\r\nchange, and to act upon each emergency as it arises.  The past history\r\nof the City of London is one long illustration of this position,--it\r\nis an uninterrupted series of reforms, many of them rather beneficial\r\nto the nation at large than to the Corporation itself.  On what grounds,\r\nthen, is it justifiable to supersede this salutary internal action of\r\nthe Corporation, and to exercise the arbitrary power of the\r\nlegislature to enforce crude and inapplicable innovations?\r\nThis interference with the self-government of the City is, in fact,\r\na vote of censure on the duly elected representatives of the citizens,\r\nwith whom the majority of the citizens themselves are, however,\r\nperfectly satisfied.  But, in truth, that \"self-government\" is the\r\nhead and front of their offence, for is it not a stumbling-block to\r\nministerial and oligarchical influence?  In addition to the power of\r\nenacting by-laws, the Common Council superintend the disposal of the\r\nfunds of the Corporation; and without their previous consent no larger\r\nsum than 100 pounds can be paid for any purpose whatsoever.\r\nTheir executive functions are also considerable.  Upon this court\r\ndepends the responsibility of electing the common serjeant, the town\r\nclerk, the two judges, and officers of the Sheriffs' Court, the clerk\r\nof the peace, the coroner, the remembrancer, the commissioner of the\r\ncity police, and various other officers of inferior note and standing.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens.\r\n\r\nThe \"complete\" citizen may be defined as a ten-pound householder,\r\npaying scot and bearing lot.  The freedom of the City is not, however,\r\nattainable by simple residence.  It is to be acquired only by three\r\nmodes--by patrimony, by apprenticeship, or by redemption.  A royal\r\ncharter, even, is insufficient to make the grantee free of the City.\r\nThe freedom of the City is not confined to the male sex.  Freewomen\r\nare called free sisters, but cannot transmit their freedom, which is,\r\nmoreover, suspended during coverture.  Freedom by service is acquired\r\nby a seven years' apprenticeship to a freeman or freewoman, the\r\nindenture being enrolled at the Chamberlain's office within twelve\r\nmonths of its execution.  The apprentice need not necessarily be\r\narticled to a member of any guild, fraternity, or trading company, but\r\nhe must not be the son of an alien.  Freedom by redemption, or\r\npurchase, is of a threefold nature:--1st.  It may take the form of a\r\nfine for any breach of the apprenticeship indentures; 2nd.  It is\r\noften bestowed as an honorary distinction on individuals eminent for\r\ntheir public services; and 3rd.  Admission to the freedom of the City\r\nis by presentment by persons entitled to confer that privilege.  It is\r\nimperative on all persons elected to a corporate office, or \"occupying\r\npremises and carrying on any trade, business, or profession, within\r\nthe City and its liberties,\" to become free of the City.  This is done\r\nby the payment of the fees of the officers and of 5 pounds to the\r\nCorporation.  The advantages of the freedom, though not so great in\r\nthe present day as in ancient times, are still considerable.  Besides\r\nbeing a bond of union and mutual protection, it entitles its possessor\r\nto a vote at the elections of the aldermen and the common council of\r\nthe ward.  Only freemen can act as brokers, or, indeed, carry on any\r\ntrade within the boundaries of the City.\r\n\r\nThe Companies.\r\n\r\nAs the City of London waxed mighty and opulent, proportionate was the\r\nincrease of the wealth and importance of its component parts.  The\r\nhumble guilds or crafts gradually developed themselves into large and\r\ninfluential trading companies, to belong to which was deemed an honour\r\nnot beneath the consideration of royalty.  Edward III., for instance,\r\ndid not disdain to be enrolled in the Worshipful Company of Linen\r\nArmourers, now Merchant Tailors; and his example was followed by his\r\nsuccessor, Richard II. The example, indeed, was contagious, for in the\r\nreign of the latter monarch the company in question could boast of the\r\nfellowship of four royal dukes, ten earls, ten barons, and five\r\nbishops.  The custom has come down to our own times, and the proudest\r\nnames in the aristocracy are recorded in the books of the City\r\ncompanies.  The presidents of these crafts or mysteries were styled\r\nWardens, who were assisted by a small number of delegates of the guild\r\nin presenting to the City Chamberlain all defaults against the rules\r\nand ordinances of the mystery.  These companies were not all equally\r\nregarded by either the sovereign or the citizens.  Towards the close of\r\nthe reign of Edward II. the more important companies separated from\r\nthe less wealthy; and this distinction was soon so far recognized,\r\nthat precedency was given to the following twelve companies:-\r\n1. Mercers; 2.  Grocers; 3.  Drapers; 4.  Fishmongers; 5.  Goldsmiths;\r\n6. Skinners; 7.  Merchant Tailors; 8.  Haberdashers; 9.  Salters; 10.\r\nIronmongers; 11.  Vintners; 12.  Cloth workers.  In these companies the\r\nfreemen from early times have been of two classes; the upper, entitled\r\nto wear the \"livery\" or uniform of the company; and the lower,\r\nconsisting mostly of workmen.  The representatives of the companies\r\nwere chosen from the former, and are mentioned in the charters as\r\nprobi homines.  In the fifteenth year of Edward IV. the Common Council\r\nenacted, that the masters, wardens, and probi homines of the several\r\nmysteries should repair to the Guildhall in their last liveries, for\r\nthe purpose of electing the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and other civic\r\nofficers; and that the members of the Common Council should be the\r\nonly other persons present.  This court now consists of the Lord Mayor\r\nor his deputy--an alderman who has passed the chair--four aldermen,\r\nand the liverymen of the companies who are also freemen.  Their office\r\nis to elect the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, chamberlain, bridge-master, and\r\nauditors of the City and Bridge-house accounts, and the four ale-conners.\r\nThe official style of the court is, \"A Meeting or Assembly of the Mayor,\r\nAldermen, and Liverymen of the several Companies of the City of London\r\nin Common Hall assembled.\" The franchise is confined to liverymen of a\r\nyear's standing, who have paid their livery fines in full, without\r\nreceiving any drawback or allowance.  The mode of proceeding is by a\r\nshow of hands, but a poll may be demanded by any of the candidates, or\r\nby two electors.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriffs.\r\n\r\nThe office of Sheriff has somewhat fallen from its ancient \"high\r\nestate.\" According to Stow, they were formerly \"the mayor's eyes,\r\nseeing and supporting part of the case, which the person of the mayor\r\nis not alone sufficient to bear.\" In olden times the sheriffs were\r\nalways conjoined with the mayor and aldermen in proclamations\r\nrequiring them to preserve the peace of the City.  From a very remote\r\nperiod the right of electing these officers belonged to the citizens,\r\nand later charters acknowledge and confirm the privilege.  Henry I.\r\ngranted to them to hold Middlesex to farm, for 300 pounds a year, and\r\nto appoint their own sheriff; while the second charter of John confirms\r\nto them the sheriffwick of London and Middlesex at the rent or farm of\r\n300 pounds, \"blank sterling money,\" and declares that they \"shall make\r\namongst themselves sheriffs whom they will, and remove them when they\r\nwill.\" In those times this was a very important privilege, for the\r\nsheriff, or shire-reve, as the king's bailiff, was possessed of\r\nextraordinary powers, which he usually exercised in a very corrupt and\r\noppressive manner.  The sheriffs of London are the sheriff of\r\nMiddlesex; in the former capacity they are addressed in the plural, in\r\nthe latter in the singular.  Though shorn of its beams, the office of\r\nSheriff is still a highly honourable one, nor are the duties light or\r\nunimportant which devolve upon these functionaries.  The honour,\r\nmoreover, is as costly as it is onerous; not only do the sheriffs\r\nreceive no salary, but they are conventionally expected to disburse\r\nseveral thousand pounds in charities and hospitality.  The inspection\r\nof the city gaols occupies no small portion of their time, nor do they\r\nenjoy much intermission from the incessant demands for eleemosynary\r\naid.  That an office so costly and troublesome should be an object of\r\ncompetition, is certainly a striking proof of the disinterested and\r\npatriotic spirit of the citizens of London.\r\n\r\nThe Law Courts.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic love of fair play, our ancestors laid it down as a\r\nleading principle, that \"justice should be administered at every man's\r\nown door, in the presence of his neighbours.\" It is, indeed, a primary\r\nelement of good government, that the dispensation of justice should be\r\nprompt and inexpensive, and without favour of persons.  With the\r\nexception of the City of London, however, and a few other privileged\r\nplaces, the local tribunals were gradually superseded through the\r\ncentralizing action of the superior courts.  But even in London the\r\ncivic franchises have been seriously diminished through the ruling of\r\nthose courts that the privilege claimed by the citizens to be sued\r\nonly before their own local tribunals is confined to real, and does\r\nnot extend to transitory actions.\r\n\r\nThe highest court of civic judicature was the Hustings Court, so\r\ncalled from the Saxon word hustings, signifying the \"house of things,\"\r\nor causes.  It was presided over by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, but\r\nthe proceedings were actually conducted, and judgment pronounced, by\r\nthe Recorder.  All real and mixed cases, saving ejectment, fell within\r\nthe province of this court, which was held at Guildhall on every\r\nalternate Tuesday.  This court, however, though not formally abolished,\r\ndoes not now sit, and all the business formerly transacted at it is\r\ntransferred to the Lord Mayor Court and the City Small Debts Court.\r\nIn ancient times, the registration of deeds, wills, and titles to land,\r\nbelonged also to this court, and the record in the Hustings of a sale\r\nor purchase of lands was deemed a sufficient voucher.  It has been\r\nsuggested that, as the necessity of a proper system of registration of\r\nthe sale or mortgage of real property is becoming daily more evident,\r\nthe machinery for accomplishing that purpose is afforded by the Court\r\nof Hustings, so far, at least, as the City is concerned.  Practically,\r\nthe most important court, however, at the present day, is the Lord\r\nMayor's Court, or Court of Aldermen of the Outer Chamber.  As in the\r\nHustings Court, the actual judge is the Recorder, though the Lord\r\nMayor and Aldermen are supposed to preside.  In some respects, this\r\ncourt is one of equity, with the advantage over the Court of Chancery\r\nof being at the same time more expeditious, quite as equitable, and\r\nfar less expensive.  As a court of common law, it takes cognizance of\r\nall personal and mixed actions, without exception, and in its\r\noperations and bearings is altogether a striking example of the\r\nbenefits incidental to local self-government.  The Sheriffs' Court of\r\nthe City of London for the recovery of small debts is also admirably\r\nadapted to the requirements of a free commercial people, and is of\r\ninestimable value to the small tradesmen of London.\r\n\r\nPublic Charities.\r\n\r\nThe monastic institutions in Roman Catholic countries provide for, and\r\nthereby foster, a large amount of idle and reckless habits.  Previous\r\nto the Reformation, this was certainly the case in England.  Not only\r\nthe sick, the maimed, and the accidentally necessitous were fed and\r\nclothed,--the same indiscriminating charity was extended to those far\r\nless worthy of the sympathy of their fellow-creatures.  On the\r\nsuppression of conventual establishments, it would have fared badly\r\nwith the deserving poor in London had not the Corporation stepped\r\nforward to help them.  At present, the princely sum of 10,000 pounds\r\nis annually disbursed from the corporate funds in contributions to\r\nvarious hospitals, asylums, schools, dispensaries, and local\r\ncharities; but even this large sum of money would be inadequate to the\r\npurpose, were it not supplemented by the individual munificence of the\r\ncitizens.  The Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs, the Aldermen, and the other\r\ncivic dignitaries vie with one another in an open-handed liberality,\r\nwhich asks no other condition than that the recipient shall actually\r\nstand in need of aid, and be worthy of relief and assistance.  It is\r\nmuch to be feared, however, that with the declining influence of the\r\nCorporation, the stream of private charity will also dry up.\r\nThe continued payment of the 10,000 pounds a year may, indeed, be\r\nsecured by Act of Parliament; but no Act of Parliament can alter human\r\nnature.  Proud of their position as the chosen delegates and\r\nrepresentatives of their fellow-citizens, among whom they and their\r\nfathers have lived for generations, the City potentates have, of their\r\nabundance, contributed lavishly and without stint to every local\r\ninstitution deserving of sympathy and support.  And not only these,\r\nbut the livery companies likewise have given lordly amounts to\r\ncharitable establishments both within and without the City liberties,\r\nand have founded schools in many distant parts of the kingdom.\r\nBut if the Corporation is to be \"reformed\" after the manner of\r\nSir George Grey and his coadjutors--if the esprit de corps, which is\r\nnow so beneficially and beneficently exhibited, is to be suppressed,\r\nwhat reasonable hope remains that men who have been arbitrarily\r\ndeprived of all real interest in City matters will still devote their\r\ntime, their energies, and their fortunes to purposes which only\r\nremunerate them with toil, anxiety, and personal discomfort?\r\nThe inevitable tendency of the proposed Bill is to reduce the entire\r\nadministration of the City to a dull, heartless routine.  Step by step\r\nthe continental system of home government is being insinuated into\r\nthis hitherto free country. Yet a few years of unchecked progress in\r\nthat direction, and it will be proposed to appoint crown officers to\r\npreside over county and town, city and borough.  The approaches to\r\nabsolute power, under the less alarming title of centralization,\r\nthough insidious, have long been apparent to all who study the\r\nworkings of system-mongers.  Unless a vigorous stand be now made\r\nagainst these continued encroachments of ministerial and oligarchical\r\ninfluence, the middle classes will, ere long, have to content\r\nthemselves with being literally a \"nation of shopkeepers,\" without any\r\nobject of honourable ambition in view, without any hope of obtaining\r\ndistinction and eminence in the annals of their country, and reduced\r\nto the one narrow pursuit of \"making money.\" Are the free burgesses of\r\nLondon prepared thus to sacrifice their birthright to gratify the whim\r\nor envy of a Whig ex-minister?\r\n\r\nConservancy of the Thames.\r\n\r\nTo the disciples of the modern doctrine that ancient charters were\r\ngiven only to be abolished, and parliamentary statutes enacted only to\r\nbe repealed, it is idle to state that the first charter of James I.\r\nacknowledged that the conservation of the water of the Thames had been\r\nheld time out of mind by the mayor and commonalty.  Those, however, who\r\nstill reverence the ancient landmarks, and regard with respect the\r\nhonest feelings and manly wisdom of their ancestors, will not treat so\r\nlightly claims derived from immemorial usage and prescriptive right.\r\n>From time, then, \"whereof the memory of man runneth not to the\r\ncontrary,\" the conservancy of the Thames has been one of the duties\r\nand privileges of the mayoralty of the City of London.  The\r\njurisdiction of the Thames conservator extends from Staines Bridge to\r\nYendall or Yenleet, and from Colemouth Creek to Cockham Wood in the\r\nMedway, including every bank, shore, and wharf within those limits.\r\nThe duties of the office are to remove all wears and other\r\nobstructions, to prevent the construction of piers or wharfs\r\ncalculated to impede the navigation of the river, to protect the\r\nfisheries, and generally to take care that neither the channel nor the\r\nbanks suffer injury through the malice or heedlessness of individuals,\r\nor from accidental causes.  This department of the corporate\r\nadministration is at present intrusted to the Navigation Committee,\r\nannually selected from the Court of Common Council, who make\r\nperiodical excursions on the river, and judge with their own eyes as\r\nto what is desirable to be done or avoided.  No doubt these functions\r\ncould be discharged by a government officer, the friend or relative of\r\na man of parliamentary influence, and equally without doubt this\r\nconsideration is likely to carry more weight in the House of Commons\r\nthan any claims derived from immemorial usage and centuries of\r\nbeneficial operation.\r\n\r\nThe Metage Dues.\r\n\r\nThe same charter of James I. which confirmed the ancient right of the\r\nmayor and commonalty of London to the conservation of the water of the\r\nThames, declares that the citizens are equally, and on the same\r\ngrounds, entitled to exercise the office of measuring all coals,\r\ncereals, fruits, vegetables, salt, and other merchandise sold by\r\nmeasure, brought to the port of London.  In the beginning, this\r\nprivilege arose out of the necessity of ascertaining the exact\r\nquantity of these articles actually imported into the City, in order\r\nfairly to collect the king's customs.  It has since been found mutually\r\nbeneficial to all parties that all measurable goods should be meted\r\nout by sworn meters, carefully selected for their responsible duties,\r\nand over whom is maintained a constant and jealous supervision.  The\r\nCourt of Common Council appoint ten \"corn-meters in trust,\" who are\r\nplaced over 150 deputy meters, chosen by the Corn and Coal and Finance\r\nCommittee, and sworn in the Lord Mayor's Court to do their duty\r\nwithout fear or favour.  There are also a few other officers connected\r\nwith this very important branch of the civic regulations as to trade,\r\nto whom, however, it is unnecessary further to allude than as an\r\nillustration of the useful and practical precautions adopted by the\r\nCorporation to secure strict fairness of dealing between buyer and\r\nseller.  The fruit-meters are four in number, who appoint their own\r\ndeputies, and are equally bound to impartiality.  There are likewise\r\ntwenty-one deputy oyster-meters, one salt-meter and several deputies,\r\nand a fruit-shifter and a salt-shifter.  It is now proposed to deprive\r\nthe Corporation of the funds realized by these metage dues.  The\r\nprinciple of free trade is to be carried out to an extent that will\r\nexclude honesty as an essential ingredient in commercial transactions.\r\nEverything, we are told, finds its own level.  Every man is the best\r\nguardian of his own interests.  Neither seller nor buyer will submit\r\nto be wronged by the other.  It is contrary to the modern system of\r\ntrade to interfere between dealers and purchasers; they are quite\r\ncompetent to take care of themselves, and are quite ready to dispense\r\nwith the intervention of a third party.  Besides, there is no\r\nnecessity to do away with sworn meters, payable by the job according\r\nto a fixed scale.  The only alteration that is required is the\r\nconfiscation of the right of the Corporation to derive any profit from\r\ntheir labours.  This doctrine of confiscation is a convenient one, but\r\nit is somewhat inconsistent with the outcry that has so recently been\r\nraised because Lord Canning was supposed to have confiscated the\r\nrights of certain farmers of the revenue in India; for that is the\r\nexact position of a talookdar.  Now the Corporation farms, and has\r\nfrom time out of mind farmed, the revenue arising from these various\r\nsources.  The sovereign is the seignior of the City, and therefore\r\nentitled in the first instance to all customs, duties, revenues, and\r\nimposts levied within its precincts.  But on various grounds, and by\r\nvarious means,--such as petition, purchase, composition, and\r\nextraordinary services--the citizens of London have at various times\r\nobtained the remission or enjoyment of these different sources of\r\nincome.  The metage dues are therefore as much their property as an\r\nhereditary estate is that of its acknowledged proprietor.  Their title\r\nto these dues is of considerably longer standing than that of his\r\nGrace the Duke of Bedford to Woburn Abbey, and those of so many lay\r\nimpropriators of church property.  If royal charters and Acts of\r\nParliament are of no greater value than waste paper, there is of\r\ncourse nothing more to be said on the subject.  There is nothing,\r\nthen, to oppose as a barrier to any act of spoliation.  Blackstone,\r\nindeed, says that Parliament is omnipotent to bind or to loose, and\r\ncompetent to annul charters and to repeal its own statutes.  It is\r\ncertainly no new thing for Parliament to stultify itself, but it is\r\nalso certain that the Legislature will better consult its reputation\r\nby occasionally repressing its eagerness to cancel the proceedings of\r\nits predecessors, and by abstaining from too frequent indulgence in\r\nacts of confiscation.\r\n\r\nThe coal duties, however, demand a fuller consideration than any other\r\ndepartment of City finance.  The first charter of Richard II. confirmed\r\nto the Corporation of London \"the custody\" of the persons and property\r\nof all orphans.  According to ancient custom, the citizens could\r\ndispose by will of only one-third of their personal estate, the\r\nremaining two-thirds being paid into the Court of Orphans in trust for\r\ntheir children.  A very large sum of money was at times thus invested,\r\nto the no small advantage of all parties concerned in the arrangement.\r\nBut in the seventeenth century the Corporation became involved in debt\r\nto this fund, and to private individuals, to the extent of\r\nthree-quarters of a million sterling.  This state of bankruptcy was by\r\nno means the result of imprudence or ostentatious extravagance.\r\nDuring the Rebellion the City had been despoiled by both parties under\r\nvarious pretexts.  After the Restoration the great fire consumed a vast\r\namount of city property and necessitated a ruinous outlay in the\r\nreconstruction of entire streets.  To this was added the shutting up of\r\nthe Exchequer by Charles II., and the seizure of the charter when the\r\nCity refused any longer to provide the means for his selfish and\r\ndisgraceful prodigality.  A better era, however, was inaugurated by the\r\naccession of William and Mary, in the fifth and sixth of whose reign\r\nan Act was passed for raising what was called an \"Orphans' Fund.\"\r\nThe estates of the Corporation were charged with the annual payment of\r\n8,000 pounds towards the liquidation of their debt, and for the same\r\npurpose a duty of 2,000 pounds a year on the personal property of the\r\ncitizens was paid till 1795.  To meet these heavy charges a duty of\r\nfourpence per chaldron was levied on coals and culm imported into\r\nLondon, and also an additional duty of sixpence per chaldron for fifty\r\nyears.  By this means the debt of 750,000 pounds was finally\r\ndischarged in 1782, but another debt had been contracted by the\r\nCorporation being called upon to contribute to public improvements\r\nbeyond the just limits of their jurisdiction.  By the year 1823 no\r\nless a sum than 846,300 pounds had been expended in this manner out of\r\nthe Orphans' Fund, and in the l0th of George IV. a further sum of\r\n1,000,000 pounds was charged upon the fund to defray the expenses for\r\nimproving the approaches to London Bridge. Under William IV., however,\r\nthe coal duties were fixed at one shilling per ton in lieu of metage,\r\nand an additional one penny per ton was allowed for the expenses of\r\nthe market.  This statute extends to a circle measured by a radius of\r\ntwenty miles from the General Post-office, and up to the present time\r\nhas been productive of much good to the general interests of the\r\nentire metropolis.  A duty upon coals is naturally unpopular, and it\r\nwould be difficult to devise one that was otherwise.  It is always\r\neasy to raise a popular clamour against taxes that press upon matters\r\nof first necessity, but in what other way is the public exchequer to\r\nbe replenished?  It will not suffice to tax objects of luxury alone,\r\nand with regard to the coal duty it is very improbable that the poor\r\nwould benefit in the slightest degree by its repeal.  The utmost\r\nreduction in the price of coals that could be expected, would be a\r\nlittle more than a halfpenny per hundredweight, and this difference is\r\nfar more likely to find its way into the pocket of the vender than\r\ninto that of the needy purchaser.  There is, moreover, another\r\ntrifling consideration to be taken into account before the abolition\r\nof these duties be decided upon.  Relying on the respect usually paid\r\nto property in this country, and confiding in the good faith of the\r\nHouse of Commons, the Corporation have mortgaged these duties in order\r\nto raise a very large sum of money.  It was not for any purposes of\r\ncivic ostentation, or indeed for any purely civic object, that they\r\nwere induced to incur this heavy obligation.  Cannon Street, the Model\r\nPrison at Holloway, the admirable improvements and enlargements of the\r\nGaol of Newgate, attest the disinterested application of the funds\r\nthus obtained. But how is faith to be kept with their creditors, if\r\ntheir property be snatched from their hands, and with it all means of\r\nmaking repayment? If the Legislature deem it just and expedient to\r\ndeprive the Corporation of one of their chief sources of revenue, they\r\nare bound to release them from all obligations incurred through the\r\npossession of those sources.  It is not disputed that the Corporation\r\nwere justified in raising money upon these securities.  If, therefore,\r\nthe securities be arbitrarily confiscated by Parliament, it is to\r\nParliament alone that the holders of those securities must look for\r\nredress.  But whence are funds to be obtained for future improvements?\r\nIt would be well if the \"faithful Commons\" would take the trouble to\r\nfind a satisfactory answer to this obvious inquiry before they finally\r\ndecide on ruining the City of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIC REFORM BILL.\r\n\r\nThe Commission of Inquiry--The New Wards--Aldermen and Common\r\nCouncilmen--City Expenditure--City Receipts and Removal of\r\nRestrictions.\r\n\r\nThe Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1834 a commission was appointed \"to inquire into the\r\nexisting state of the municipal corporations, and to collect\r\ninformation respecting their defects.\" These commissioners applied\r\nthemselves to the discharge of their somewhat invidious duties with\r\nboth earnestness and impartiality, and in their Report, published in\r\n1837, acknowledged the superior excellence of the London Corporation\r\nas compared with other corporate bodies. They readily admitted that\r\nthe Common Council possessed the necessary powers to effect whatever\r\nreforms might have become necessary through the lapse of time. They\r\nalso bore witness that the Corporation had already of itself corrected\r\nmuch that was amiss in its constitution, and that its history\r\nfurnished \"honourable testimonials to the vigilance, good sense, and\r\njustice of its legislative body.\" On these grounds the Imperial\r\nLegislature expressly exempted the City of London from the action of\r\nthe Municipal Corporations Act, and left it in the undisputed\r\nenjoyment of its ancient franchises--which, moreover, are declared by\r\n2 William & Mary not to be liable to confiscation.  A period of twenty\r\nyears then passed away without any cause of complaint having occurred\r\nto justify the interference of Government, until some disputes arose\r\non the subject of the City markets, and the conservancy of the Thames.\r\nSir George Grey at once availed himself of this pretext to appoint a\r\ncommission to investigate \"the existing state of the Corporation of\r\nthe City of London, and to collect information respecting its\r\nconstitution, order, and government.\" These commissioners, unlike\r\ntheir predecessors, exhibited from the commencement of their\r\nproceedings a strong bias and feeling of hostility against the\r\nCorporation. The witnesses they called before them were, with scarcely\r\nan exception, the avowed enemies of the existing state of things, and\r\nprepared to convert trifling blemishes into radical and monstrous\r\ndefects. And yet even these did not agree among themselves, or assign\r\nany sound reasons to render compulsory innovations expedient or\r\njustifiable.  The general tenor of their evidence, indeed, was actually\r\nin favour of the Corporation, when due allowance is made for the\r\nspirit by which they were actuated.  Nevertheless, it was upon the\r\nreport of this one-sided and unconstitutional commission that the late\r\nministry founded their Bill for \"the better Regulation of the\r\nCorporation of the City of London.\" They had arrived at a foregone\r\nconclusion, and asked for only the shadow of an excuse to mask their\r\npreconcerted designs against the chief and last stronghold of\r\nself-government.  The fate of the Corporation was clearly doomed from\r\nthe hour the House of Commons sanctioned the appointment of a\r\nprejudiced and illegal tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe New Wards.\r\n\r\nThe first clause of the proposed Bill directs a new division of the\r\nCity, and recommends that it be redistributed into sixteen wards,\r\ninstead of twenty-five as heretofore.  No reason is assigned for this\r\ninnovation, beyond an allusion to the fact that no other city--not\r\neven Liverpool--possesses more than that number of divisions or\r\ndepartments.  The object of the Government was evidently to abase and\r\nhumiliate the City of London, and to reduce it to the level of the\r\nprovincial municipalities.  It is alleged, that while the metropolis\r\nhas extended far and wide in every direction, the boundaries of the\r\nCity have remained unchanged, so that they now inclose barely 1/108th\r\npart of the entire metropolitan area.  The population also does not\r\nembrace 1/20th part of the inhabitants of the aggregate of villages\r\nand boroughs collectively known as London.  An undue importance,\r\ntherefore, has been ascribed to that small portion which constitutes\r\nthe City proper, to the prejudice of the more populous districts,\r\nwhich inclose it on every side.  This overrated influence is now to be\r\ndiminished in good earnest, and henceforth the sole criterion of\r\nimportance is to be the number of men, women, and children existing\r\nwithin a certain area.  Intelligence, wealth, enterprise, industry,\r\ncommercial reputation, and ancient rights are to be regarded as of\r\nlittle value when compared with the register of births and marriages.\r\nSo, the City of London is to be divided into sixteen wards, that it\r\nmay learn not to lift up its head above other corporations.  The\r\ndivision is, of course, to be effected by the inevitable barrister of\r\nseven years' standing--the modern type of all that is wise, good,\r\nintelligent, and incorruptible.  It matters not that these gentlemen\r\nmay and must be totally unacquainted with local peculiarities and\r\nrequirements.  There may be ward charities, and ward bequests, which\r\nwill create confusion and perplexity under any new arrangement.\r\nThe inhabitants, too, of one ward may have strong personal objections\r\nto be transferred to another.  They may dislike the disrupture of old\r\nfamily ties and connections, and cling fondly to the traditions and\r\nassociations of their youth.  Such considerations as these, however,\r\nhave no weight with red-tapists, who believe in the infallibility of\r\nprecedents, and apply one measure and one standard to all things.\r\n\r\nThe only plausible objection that can be urged against the existing\r\ndistribution of the wards is their inequality as to extent and\r\npopulation; but even if like portions of territory were set apart for\r\neach ward, the number of the inhabitants and their influence will vary\r\naccording to circumstances far beyond the control of any barrister, be\r\nhe of twice seven years' standing.  Besides, though unequal as to area\r\nand inmates, the wards are fairly enough represented; for, while the\r\nLime Street Ward returns only four members to the Common Council,\r\nBishopsgate sends fourteen, and Farringdon Without sixteen.  This,\r\nafter all, is surely the point most worthy of attention.  The object is\r\nnot so much to obtain an equality of districts as an equality of\r\nrepresentation.  It is of no consequence that Cornhill be twice as\r\npopulous as Bassishaw, if it return twice the number of\r\nrepresentatives, for in that case the disparity at once ceases to\r\nexist.  Sir George Grey, however, is partial to arithmetical equality.\r\nThere must be sixteen wards and ninety-six Common-Councilmen, or six\r\nto each ward.  Not that there is anything novel or original in this\r\nsuggestion.  Sir George merely purposes to revert to the arrangements\r\nwhich prevailed in the reign of Richard II.--a period few students of\r\nhistory would select as an illustration of the happiest and most\r\nconstitutional balance of power throughout all departments of the\r\ncommonwealth.  No proof is adduced that this parcelment of the City was\r\nattended with the best possible results, to justify its restoration in\r\nthe present century, after so long an interval and such elemental\r\nchanges of the social and commercial system.  It is quite possible, and\r\nnot at all unlikely, that in the time of the second Richard ninety-six\r\nCommon-Councilmen may have been amply sufficient to discharge all the\r\nduties that devolved upon them.  But it does not thence follow that\r\nthat same number will now suffice.  If it is proposed by Sir George\r\nGrey to establish the civic administration on the broadest, safest,\r\nand least assailable foundation, it is scarcely consistent to begin by\r\nnarrowing that basis.  It is generally believed that it is more\r\ndifficult to corrupt or influence a large number of persons than a\r\nsmall one.  In the multitude of counsellors there is strength of will,\r\nintegrity of purpose, and variety of knowledge.  There is less\r\nopportunity for jobbing among two hundred than among one hundred\r\nindividuals, The smaller number is certainly more likely to come to a\r\nmutual understanding among themselves, and to apportion to each member\r\nhis share of the loaves and fishes.  On this head no better evidence\r\nneed be adduced than the report of the commissioners of 1855, by no\r\nmeans too favourably disposed towards the Corporation.  It is in the\r\nfollowing terms that they speak of the City, and of the advantages\r\nincidental to a large representation:-\"The antiquity, extent, and\r\nimportance of its privileges, the long series of its charters, the\r\nlarge amount of its revenues, its metropolitan position, and its\r\nhistorical associations, combine to give it a character different from\r\nthat of any other municipal borough.  It may be added, that the\r\ncontinued predominance of the popular element in the formation of its\r\ngoverning body furnished a reason in 1835 for excepting it from the\r\nMunicipal Corporations Act; seeing that one of the principal defects\r\nwhich that Act was intended to remedy was the practical exclusion of\r\nthe principle of popular election from the government of the borough,\r\nand the accumulation of power in the hands of a small body of persons.\r\nThe commissioners state, in their general report of 1835:--'The most\r\ncommon and most striking defect in the constitution of the municipal\r\ncorporations of England and Wales is, that the corporate bodies exist\r\nindependently of the communities among which they are found.  The\r\ncorporations look upon themselves, and are considered by the\r\ninhabitants, as separate and exclusive bodies; they have powers and\r\nprivileges within towns and cities from which they are named, but in\r\nmost places all identity of interest between the corporation and the\r\ninhabitants has disappeared.' From the defect described in this\r\npassage, the Corporation of London has for many years been exempt.\r\nThe manner in which the Common Council is elected has produced, to a\r\ngreat extent, an identity of interests between the governing municipal\r\nbody and the existing municipal community, and has secured to the\r\nlatter a council representing their general opinions and feelings.\r\nThe Municipal Commissioners particularly advert to the Common Council\r\nof London, as distinguishing that corporation from the close\r\ncorporations which then prevailed throughout the country.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine a better reason for upholding the existing\r\norder of things than this very report of the commissioners.  They admit\r\nthat there is an identity of interests between the governing and the\r\ngoverned, between the representatives and their constituents, between\r\nthe stewards and those for whom they act.  No higher commendation can\r\nbe desired.  The system is described as giving satisfaction to all\r\nconcerned in its operation, and as being free from the great defect\r\nwhich vitiated the municipal arrangements of other cities.  The\r\nadministrative power is not accumulated in the hands of a few, but is\r\nfreely intrusted to an ample number of representatives chosen by\r\npopular election, and liable to removal at the expiration of a year.\r\nThe fact that the votes of the citizens are usually given to their\r\nrepresentatives of many years' standing, is an indisputable proof that\r\nthe latter do not neglect their duty, or overlook the identity of\r\ninterests that exists between the governing body and the municipal\r\ncommunity.  And yet, in the teeth of this report, and in defiance of\r\nthis good accord, the very defect is to be introduced which was\r\nreprobated in other corporations.  The administrative power is to be\r\nvested in the hands of a comparatively small governing body, and an\r\nopportunity afforded for those practices which were considered so\r\nobjectionable elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps hardly worthy of remark that the selection of the\r\npersons to be appointed to set out the new wards should rest with the\r\nSecretary of State.  Were it not for the constant augmentation of\r\npatronage afforded by each innovation, very little would ever be heard\r\nabout reform of any kind.  But every change, every act of abolition,\r\naffords am irresistible opportunity for providing for poor relations\r\nand importunate constituents.  The Secretary of State, therefore,\r\nreserves to himself the choice of the \"fit person or persons,\" which\r\nmight more decently have been left to the citizens themselves.  It is\r\ntrue the latter have not been altogether forgotten, and will not be\r\naltogether passed over.  To them is to be assigned the privilege of\r\npaying five guineas a day to each of these \"fit persons,\" as a\r\nrecompense for their exertions in introducing confusion and perplexity\r\nwhere order and contentment now prevail.\r\n\r\nAldermen and Common-Councilmen.\r\n\r\nThe contemplated reduction of the governing body of the City is based\r\nupon a specious theory, which will soon be found to be utterly\r\nuntenable.  It is pretended that if the Courts of Aldermen and of\r\nCommon Council were rendered more exclusive, it would be considered a\r\ngreater distinction to belong to them, and that consequently a more\r\nwealthy and influential class of individuals would seek to be elected.\r\nIn the first place, the exclusiveness sought to be established in the\r\nCorporation of London is the very blot which the Municipal Act was\r\nintended to remove from other corporate bodies.  What was in them a\r\nblemish, is to be engrafted as a beauty into the City of London.\r\nBut granting that a certain degree of exclusiveness may be not only\r\nunobjectionable, but even desirable, is it so very certain that\r\nopulent bankers and men of high standing in the commercial world will\r\nbe thereby induced to offer themselves as candidates for civic\r\noffices? Have they themselves offered any suggestion to this effect,\r\nor asked for any such motive to do their duty as free-born citizens?\r\nNothing of the kind.  It is pure assumption to assert that when the\r\nhonour is more difficult of attainment it will become an object of\r\nambition to the mighty men on 'Change.  The witnesses who gave evidence\r\non this head before the commissioners were unanimous as to the cause\r\nthat keeps our princely merchants aloof from the civic arena: it is\r\nwant of time.  One and all declared that they could not spare the time\r\nfrom their own pursuits and engagements.  Private interests have more\r\nweight with them than those of a public nature; they wish no harm to\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, but will not sacrifice their own comfort or\r\nprofits to toil for their benefit.  Indeed, it is by no means manifest\r\nthat bankers and merchants are the fittest persons to administer the\r\naffairs of the City.  As a rule, their homes are as remote as possible\r\nfrom the scene of their daily labours.  They know nothing whatever of\r\ntheir neighbours, and care no more for one ward than for another, all\r\nbeing equally indifferent to them.  They are bound together by no\r\ncommon ties, nor have they any local or traditional sympathies.  It is,\r\ntherefore, very doubtful that their presence among the aldermen, or in\r\nthe Court of Common Council, would prove at all beneficial to the\r\nCity, or likely to enhance their own personal reputation.  And if, as\r\nthey themselves allege, they have hitherto been deterred from\r\nundertaking civic duties by the pressure of private affairs, there is\r\nno ground for the hypothesis that they will henceforth have more\r\nleisure to devote themselves to promoting the welfare of their\r\nneighbours.  In truth, the office of alderman is no sinecure.  He is not\r\nmerely a very stout gentleman, wearing a blue gown, and guzzling\r\nenormous quantities of turtle-soup.  That caricature is of a piece with\r\nthe old fable of the lean Frenchman, starving upon frogs, and capable\r\nonly of dancing and grimacing.  An alderman of the City of London has\r\nmost onerous duties to discharge, for which he expects no other\r\nremuneration than the approval of his own conscience and the respect\r\nof his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of public notoriety, that in the year 1834 the\r\nCorporation cheerfully complied with the requisitions of the\r\nGovernment with regard to the business of the Central Criminal Court.\r\nThe number of sessions and of courts was increased, prison\r\naccommodation considerably enlarged, and other arrangements made with\r\nthe utmost liberality in order to facilitate the administration of\r\njustice.  By the Act passed in that year, it was specially provided\r\nthat the aldermen of London should be members of the commission, which\r\nshould be presided over by the Lord Mayor.  The local knowledge\r\npossessed by these magistrates has enabled them on very many occasions\r\nto render important service to the judges in apportioning the\r\npunishment due to offenders.  At the same time they acquired, on their\r\npart, a practical knowledge of the administration of law.  The result\r\nof this training displayed itself in the soundness of their\r\nmagisterial decisions, and the correctness of their application of\r\ncriminal law.  Six aldermen are placed on the rota for each month, and\r\ncompelled to attend at the Old Bailey, unless they can furnish a\r\nsufficient excuse for their absence.  If the number of aldermen be\r\nreduced to sixteen, it is not easy to perceive how this important\r\nbranch of their duties is to be adequately discharged.  In addition to\r\ntheir compulsory attendance at the Central Criminal Court, the\r\naldermen are called upon to exercise various other magisterial\r\nfunctions, including the inspection and management of prisons.  They\r\nhave likewise to attend at the London Quarter Sessions; the special\r\nsessions for hearing appeals; the special sessions for licenses; the\r\npetty sessions; the special sessions; the Southwark Quarter Sessions,\r\nand the annual meetings and adjournments.  Even this enumeration of\r\nduties, however, is no equivalent indication of the work to be gone\r\nthrough, the whole of which is done gratuitously and without\r\nexpectation of reward.  It is proposed, indeed, that the Court of Mayor\r\nand Aldermen of the City of London in the Inner Chamber shall retain\r\nthe power of appointing the Recorder and certain other officers, and\r\nof exercising a supervision over the internal discipline of prisons,\r\nand in relation to charities and other trusts, but in most other\r\nrespects their privileges and jurisdiction are to terminate.\r\n\r\nOn some points the Common Council are to be exalted at the expense of\r\nthe Court of Aldermen.  They are to administer the money and funds of\r\nthe City, subject to the audit of three persons annually elected, an\r\nabstract of whose statement is to be laid before Parliament.  The\r\nCorporation are therefore deemed unworthy or incompetent to manage\r\ntheir own finances.  Men of business are told that their ignorance is\r\nso crass, or their honesty so doubtful, that the Legislature is\r\ncompelled to keep a watchful eye on their expenditure.  The proposition\r\nis as absurd as it is insulting and uncalled for.  The Corporation are\r\nfurther to have no power to sell, mortgage, or lease their own\r\nestates.  It may, perchance, be true, that in former times less regard\r\nwas paid to the discovery of secure and profitable investments than\r\nsuits the more grasping spirit of the present times.  It may also be\r\nthat greater extravagance was occasionally exhibited than would now be\r\neither justifiable or tolerable.  But on neither of these grounds was\r\nit fitting to affix such a stigma, to pass such a vote of censure, on\r\nthe existing governing body.  Many economical reforms have of late\r\nyears been spontaneously introduced, and an unmistakable tendency\r\nshown to make such further retrenchments as might be consistent with\r\nthe efficiency of the public service.  No doubt the expenses attendant\r\non the collection of the City's income are susceptible of reduction,\r\nnor would it be amiss if the heavy outlay connected with the civic\r\ngovernment were lightened of some of its items.  Still, these are mere\r\nquestions of detail, and might fairly be left to the good taste,\r\njudgment, and discretion of the municipal magistrates.  The steps\r\nalready taken by the Common Council clearly evince their desire to\r\nkeep pace with the liberalism of the age.  Since the year 1835,\r\nthe sum of at least 100,000 pounds has been offered on the altar of\r\npublic opinion by the gradual abolition of the fines and fees which\r\nrestricted the freedom of the City.  In the same spirit they sacrificed\r\nthe street tolls, which annually produced upwards of 5,000 pounds,\r\nas soon as they had redeemed the mortgage which enabled them to lay out\r\nthe new street running north from Farringdon Street.  They have also\r\ncourted publicity, by admitting to their deliberations the reporters\r\nof the public press, and by publishing minutes of their proceedings\r\nand detailed statements of the receipt and expenditure of public\r\nmoneys. In these and many similar ways they have manifested their\r\nanxiety to act in strict good faith towards their constituents,\r\nand to do the utmost in their power to promote the welfare of the\r\nCity of London. No allegations, indeed, have been made against their\r\nscrupulously honourable administration of the funds intrusted to\r\ntheir stewardship. Their integrity has never been impugned by their\r\nbitterest enemies--the charges that have been brought forward reflect\r\nonly upon their judgment.  They are accused of lavishing untold sums\r\nupon idle pageantry and luxurious entertainments, while they have\r\nneglected to improve the great thoroughfares, to cleanse the river,\r\nand generally to embellish the metropolis and ameliorate the sanitary\r\ncondition of its inhabitants.  It is worth while to consider how much\r\nof truth lies in these accusations.\r\n\r\nCity Expenditure.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that at the first blush it does appear that an\r\nunnecessarily large amount of money is laid out annually on festivities.\r\nFor instance, in the year 1855 upwards of 14,000 pounds were expended\r\non the entertainments given to the Emperor of the French, the King of\r\nSardinia, and the Prefect of the Seine.  On minor occasions also very\r\nconsiderable sums are lost in like manner to the City treasury.\r\nBut this apparent extravagance is not without its advantages.\r\nThis generous hospitality has rendered the Corporation of London\r\nfamous throughout the civilized world, and given it a fabulous\r\ninfluence among the nations of the Continent.  The chief magistrate\r\nof the City is looked upon as only inferior to the sovereign, and far\r\nabove all other princes and potentates.  Thus, in a popular French\r\nplay the principal personage is made to exclaim in an enthusiasm of\r\nambition --\"Yes, I will make myself great; I shall yet be count,\r\nmarquis, duke, perhaps lord mayor.\" The credit acquired by the City\r\nhas been reflected upon the whole nation, and there are none so mean\r\nas not to have heard of the wealth, magnificence, and genial hospitality\r\nof the free-born citizens of the metropolis of the British empire.\r\n\r\nWith regard to thoroughfares, it has already been stated that the\r\nstreet tolls were mortgaged for some years, in order to raise the\r\nrequisite funds for carrying out Farringdon Street to the northern\r\nboundary of the City.  More recently an enormous debt has been incurred\r\nin the construction of Cannon Street.  Half a million sterling has been\r\nsunk in the attempt to erect a handsome street, which should take off\r\nfrom Cheapside a portion of the exodus to London Bridge, and at the\r\nsame time furnish a noble example of street architecture.  In a\r\npecuniary point of view the experiment has not thus far proved\r\nsuccessful, but the very errors of the Corporation are on a grand and\r\nmagnificent scale.  Upwards of another half-million has gone to the\r\nconstruction of the new cattle-market at Islington and the model prison\r\nat Holloway.  Newgate, also, is being enlarged and improved, and it is\r\nproposed to build a lunatic asylum on some lands recently purchased\r\nfor the purpose in the neighbourhood of Croydon.  A very large sum is\r\nannually expended in street improvements, besides a contribution of\r\nnearly 12,000 pounds a year to a metropolitan fund for objects not\r\ncomprised within the liberties of the City.  The Corporation also pays\r\n11,000 pounds per annum towards the maintenance of the police force,\r\nthough in other metropolitan districts this proportion of the expenses\r\nis debited to the Consolidated Fund.  Of the charitable donations and\r\nsubscriptions of the Corporation it is needless to speak, for their\r\nfame has gone forth throughout the world.  The City of London School\r\nwas built at a cost of 20,000 pounds, and year by year receives\r\nsubstantial support and encouragement.  The education and maintenance\r\nof a hundred orphan children are provided for at another establishment;\r\nnor is there any charitable institution worthy of support that is not\r\nassisted with ungrudging liberality.\r\n\r\nThe conservancy of the Thames is another of the responsible duties of\r\nthe Corporation.  For all purposes of navigation the river is admirably\r\nadapted by nature, and improved by the thoughtful vigilance of its\r\nconservators.  As a navigable river the Thames is actually in a better\r\ncondition at the present day than at any period of its past history, a\r\nremark that cannot be applied to any other tidal river in the world.\r\nAs for the filthy and polluted character of its waters, that at least\r\ncannot be laid to the charge of the Corporation.  So far back as the\r\nyear 1842 the City authorities issued a commission to survey and\r\nreport upon the state of the Thames, and in accordance with the report\r\nof those gentlemen proceeded to take measures for embanking the river\r\nso as to prevent the deposit of mud on the banks, to deepen the\r\nchannel, and to improve the wharfage.  Strange to say, these spirited\r\nproceedings in the interest of the entire metropolis drew down upon\r\nthe Corporation the wrath of the \"Woods and Forests.\" The foul\r\nfermenting accumulations of putrescent matter which send forth the\r\npestilential exhalations that engender so much disease, are declared\r\nto be the property of the Crown, as \"seised of the ground and soil of\r\nthe coasts and shores of the sea, and of all the navigable rivers\r\nwithin the flux and reflux of the tide throughout the kingdom.\"\r\nThanks, therefore, to this precious prerogative of the Crown, her\r\nMajesty's lieges have for the last fifteen years continued to be\r\npoisoned \"by virtue of the common law,\" while the Corporation have\r\nbeen punished by the infliction of a suit in Chancery for seeking to\r\ncleanse the river and purify the atmosphere, without first invoking\r\nthe wisdom of the \"Woods and Forests.\"\r\n\r\nIf the crown lawyers be correct, it will follow that the entire\r\nseaboard of Great Britain and Ireland is the actual property of the\r\nCrown, as well as all lands reclaimed from the sea, and that all other\r\nmanorial rights are purely imaginary and unfounded.\r\n\r\nHitherto the tonnage rates levied on vessels in the port of London\r\nare admitted to have been as moderate as was consistent with the due\r\nmaintenance of the port.  The citizens, being themselves engaged in\r\ntrade, have always been interested in holding out inducements for the\r\nshipping of all nations to frequent their port, and have thus\r\nsystematically reduced the tonnage dues to the lowest possible scale.\r\nThe Government, however, looking only to the actual amount of revenue\r\nto be obtained, intimate the probability of a future augmentation of\r\nthese dues.  The effect of even a trifling increase will naturally be\r\nto divert a portion of the trade to other ports, and to inflict a\r\nproportionate amount of injury on the port of London.  Such will be the\r\nfirst fruits of Government interference, such the inevitable result of\r\nsuperseding customs and usages which have grown out of the character\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\nCity Receipts.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that in order to carry out street\r\nimprovements and the construction of public buildings, the Corporation\r\nhas incurred a very considerable amount of debt.  These pecuniary\r\nobligations, however, were not rashly undertaken.  There was excellent\r\nsecurity to offer for their gradual but certain redemption; nor is it\r\nanywhere affirmed that the governing body exceeded their powers, or\r\nevinced a want of proper caution and foresight.  The money raised was\r\napplied to just and legitimate purposes, and secured on revenues\r\nenjoyed from time immemorial, the usufruct of which might fairly be\r\ndeemed perpetual.  Prescriptive right, however, is no barrier to\r\nreformers greedy of patronage, whose only thought is to buy cheap\r\npopularity by yielding to vulgar prejudices at the expense of their\r\nneighbours.  It is thus proposed to abolish all metage dues, to deprive\r\nthe Corporation of their portion of the coal duties, to remove all\r\nrestrictions upon brokers, and to sanction the establishment of\r\nadditional markets within the prescribed distance of seven miles.\r\nNothing is more easy than to pull down and destroy, but to fill up the\r\nvacancy thus created is a very different matter.  It requires no great\r\namount of moral courage, or of power, to dry up the sources whence the\r\ncorporate funds are derived, but far less easy will it be to obviate\r\nthe consequences of a step so ill-judged.  It is one thing to demand\r\nthe usual tale of bricks when the supply of straw is cut off, and\r\nanother to obtain it.  In vain will the Government call upon the City\r\nto construct prisons and asylums, to widen the thoroughfares, to\r\ncleanse the river, to embellish the streets.  Such work as this can\r\nonly be accomplished through the employment of large funds, and these\r\nwill no longer be at the disposal of the Corporation.  In the first\r\nplace it is proposed to take away \"all such right of metage of any\r\ngrain, fruit, wares, or merchandise as the Corporation is entitled to\r\nby custom, charter, or otherwise.\" In other words, 11,000 pounds a\r\nyear of the income of the City is to be confiscated for nobody's\r\nbenefit, but simply out of deference to a senseless clamour.  The\r\nofficers employed in the collection of this revenue are to receive\r\ncompensation out of a fund provided for the purpose by a duty of three\r\nfarthings on every quarter of grain, seed, and pulse brought into the\r\nport of London. But nothing is said about compensating the Corporation\r\nby remitting their annual contribution to the expenses of the police\r\nforce, and by defraying the same out of the Consolidated Fund.\r\nHowever, there is cause for gratitude that a still more serious loss\r\nis not yet to be inflicted upon the ways and means of the City.  The\r\nmetage duty on coals which may belong to the Corporation after the\r\nyear 1862, under 1 & 2 William IV., and 8 & 9 Victoria, is not to be\r\naffected by the present Bill; but he must be a confiding and\r\nunsuspecting individual who can trust to a long enjoyment of that\r\nsource of income.  It is now commonly supposed that the Corporation\r\nreceive the entire duty of thirteen pence per ton, whereas their\r\nactual share of the impost is only fourpence.  The remaining\r\nnine-pence are taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the\r\ngeneral benefit of the capital of the British empire.  Against this\r\narrangement no valid objection can be urged, but it is at least unfair\r\nto throw the odium of the tax upon those who derive the smallest\r\nbenefit from its proceeds.  It was upon the security of this revenue\r\nthat the Corporation were enabled to raise the 580,000 pounds required\r\nfor the construction of Cannon Street.  From the same hitherto secure\r\nsource of income, two millions and a half sterling have been expended\r\non City improvements since the reign of William and Mary.  But whence\r\nare means to be obtained for carrying out any enterprise of large\r\nutility if this revenue be confiscated?  It is, besides, not a little\r\ncharacteristic of the late, perhaps of every ministry, that not a word\r\nhas been said about the surrender of the nine-pence per ton received\r\nby the Government.  The City alone is to be made the scape-goat--the\r\nleast offending party is to be sacrificed to screen the real\r\ndelinquents,--the Corporation is to be thrown overboard, that the\r\nministerial vessel may be the more easily righted. Equally silent was\r\nSir George Grey on the subject of compensation.  And yet, when it\r\npleased the Legislature to take from the Duke of Richmond the duty of\r\none shilling per chaldron on coals shipped in the Tyne for home\r\nconsumption, which had been granted to the family by Charles II., it\r\nwas deemed only just and equitable to make a reasonable compensation\r\nto his grace.  The duty at that time (1799) yielded some 21,000 pounds\r\na year, and was commuted for a perpetual annuity of 19,000 pounds,\r\npayable out of the Consolidated Fund.  In like manner the Duke of Grafton\r\nwas indemnified in 1806 for loss incurred through the resumption of\r\nthe \"prisage and butlerage\" of wines; nor was Lord Gwydir permitted to\r\nsuffer by the compulsory surrender of his lease in the mooring-chains.\r\nIn the reign of William IV. the Crown claimed and received a\r\ncompensation of 300,000 pounds for giving up the passing tolls, and\r\nthe Corporation itself was awarded upwards of 160,000 pounds on the\r\nabolition of the \"package and scavage\" dues.  But if such zeal for\r\nretrenchment and economical reform fills the breasts of modern\r\nstatesmen, how comes it that they have no qualms about retaining the\r\nduty of four shillings on every ton of tin extracted from Cornwall,\r\nand which swells the revenues of the duchy? In what respect, in short,\r\nis the tenure by which the duchy is held more sacred and inviolable\r\nthan that which entitles the Corporation to the permanent possession\r\nof its various sources of income?  It were well that the advisers of\r\nthe Crown first cleared away all obstructions and nuisances front\r\ntheir own precincts, before undertaking to cleanse the premises of\r\ntheir neighbours.  But it is far easier to preach than to practise,\r\nand to detect the failings of others than to correct one's own.\r\n\r\nAnother \"liberal\" clause repeals any charter or grant which prevents\r\nthe holding any new market within seven miles of the city.  The framers\r\nof the Bill appear to have overlooked, or laughed to scorn, the\r\nancient common law of the land which prohibits the establishment of\r\nany fair or market within \"a third part of twenty miles\" from one\r\nalready in existence.  This common-law right has been further specially\r\nconfirmed, so far as the City of London is concerned, by an Act of\r\nParliament in the reign of the third Edward.  But considerations of\r\nmere law cannot be expected to have much weight with those who have\r\nresolved upon setting at naught the eternal principles of justice and\r\nequity.  Little did the wolf care which way the stream ran, when once\r\nhe had made up his mind to dine upon lamb.\r\n\r\nYet one other proof of \"liberality\" before we close these desultory\r\nobservations.  At present the Corporation exercises a watchful\r\nsurveillance over all persons acting as brokers within the City of\r\nLondon.  No one, indeed, is permitted to carry on that highly\r\nresponsible business without the previous sanction of the Court of\r\nAldermen.  This restriction is admitted to have been most beneficial to\r\nthe public, and the brokers themselves are fully sensible of its\r\nadvantage to themselves by inspiring a reasonable confidence in their\r\nhonour and respectability.  All this, however, is to be done away with.\r\nGovernment care for none of these things.  They prefer punishment to\r\nprevention.  Let every man do as seemeth good in his own eyes, provided\r\nonly that he escape conviction for evildoing.  In that case the\r\n\"majesty of the law\" will be vindicated by the house of correction or\r\nthe gallows.  Why then take any thought to check the downward step?\r\nThat is the province of parents, masters, and pastors.  The wisdom of\r\nthe Legislature cannot stoop to such elemental questions.  It is\r\nunworthy of the wise and illustrious senators of this great empire to\r\ntake heed of such a vulgar consideration as commercial morality.\r\nThis is a free country, wherein every man may freely live, providing\r\nfor himself, and warring upon his kind.  Such throughout is the tone\r\nand the spirit of the proposed measure for the \"better regulation\"\r\nof the City of London.  If this is better, it is devoutly to be\r\nhoped that no future ministry will bring forward a Bill for the\r\n\"best regulation.\" Every additional step in this direction can only be\r\nworse than its predecessor, for the goal to be attained is not only\r\nthe ruin of civic influence, but the subversion of self-government\r\nthroughout the realm.\r\n\r\nFor the present, indeed, this precious Bill has been withdrawn; but\r\nlet not a suspension of hostilities be construed into a conclusion of\r\npeace.  The question will certainly be brought before Parliament under\r\na modified form in the ensuing Session, and it is then that the fate\r\nof the Corporation will be decided.\r\n\r\nAre the citizens of London--are the people of Great Britain--prepared\r\nto resign without a struggle the last of the glorious rights and\r\nprivileges bequeathed to them by their Saxon ancestors?  Are they\r\nwilling to exchange their old ancestral customs and usages for the\r\ndogmatic theories and arbitrary practices of continental systems?\r\nIn short, will they consent to barter freedom for absolutism, the\r\nhappiness and independence of the many for the aggrandizement of the\r\nfew?  For that is the real question at issue, and one the answer to\r\nwhich cannot be much longer deferred.",
