RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\nSeptember 14, 1901\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMessages, Proclamations, and Executive Orders to the\r\nend of the Fifty-seventh Congress, First Session\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, the twenty-seventh President of the United States,\r\nwas born in the city of New York, October 27, 1858. His ancestors on the\r\npaternal side were of an old Knickerbocker family, and on the maternal\r\nside of Scotch-Irish descent. He was educated at home under private\r\ntuition and prepared for matriculation into Harvard, where he was\r\ngraduated in 1880. He spent the year of 1881 in study and travel. During\r\nthe years 1882-1884 he was an assemblyman in the legislature of New\r\nYork. During this term of service he introduced the first civil service\r\nbill in the legislature in 1883, and its passage was almost simultaneous\r\nwith the passage of the Civil Service Bill through Congress. In 1884\r\nhe was the Chairman of the delegation from New York to the National\r\nRepublican Convention. He received the nomination for mayor of the city\r\nof New York in 1886 as an Independent, but was defeated. He was made\r\nCivil Service Commissioner by President Harrison in 1889 and served as\r\npresident of the board until May, 1895. He resigned to become President\r\nof the New York Board of Police Commissioners in May, 1895. This\r\nposition, in which the arduous duties were discharged with remarkable\r\nvigor and fearlessness, he resigned in 1897 to become Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Navy. On the breaking out of the Spanish-American War\r\nin 1898, he resigned on May 6, and, entering the army, organized the\r\nFirst United States Volunteer (\"Rough Rider\") Regiment of Cavalry,\r\nrecommending Col. L.G. Wood to the command, and taking for himself the\r\nsecond-in-command as lieutenant-colonel. He had gained his military\r\nexperience as a member of the Eighth Regiment of N.Y.N.G. from\r\n1884-1888, during which time he rose to the rank of captain. The Rough\r\nRiders were embarked at Tampa, Fla., with the advance of Shafter's\r\ninvading army, and sailed for Cuba on June 15, 1898. They participated\r\nin every engagement preceding the fall of Santiago. Theodore Roosevelt\r\nled the desperate charge of the Ninth Cavalry and the Rough Riders at\r\nthe Battle of San Juan Hill on July 1. He was made a colonel on July 11.\r\nHe received the nomination on September 27, 1898, for Governor of the\r\nState of New York, obtaining 753 votes, against 218 for Gov. Frank S.\r\nBlack. At the election Theodore Roosevelt was supported by a majority\r\nof the Independent Republicans and many Democrats, and defeated the\r\nDemocratic candidate, Judge Augustus Van Wyck, by a plurality of 18,079.\r\nAt the Republican Convention, held at Philadelphia in June, 1900, he was\r\nnominated for Vice-President, upon which he resigned the governorship\r\nof New York. Was elected Vice-President in November, 1900, and took the\r\noath of office March 4, 1901. President McKinley was shot September 6,\r\n1901, and died September 14. His Cabinet announced his death to the\r\nVice-President, who took the oath of President at the residence of\r\nMr. Ansley Wilcox in Buffalo, before Judge John R. Hazel, of the United\r\nStates District Court, on September 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICE-PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS AS VICE-PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe history of free government is in large part the history of those\r\nrepresentative legislative bodies in which, from the earliest times,\r\nfree government has found its loftiest expression. They must ever hold\r\na peculiar and exalted position in the record which tells how the great\r\nnations of the world have endeavored to achieve and preserve orderly\r\nfreedom. No man can render to his fellows greater service than is\r\nrendered by him who, with fearlessness and honesty, with sanity and\r\ndisinterestedness, does his life work as a member of such a body.\r\nEspecially is this the case when the legislature in which the service is\r\nrendered is a vital part in the governmental machinery of one of those\r\nworld powers to whose hands, in the course of the ages, is intrusted a\r\nleading part in shaping the destinies of mankind. For weal or for woe,\r\nfor good or for evil, this is true of our own mighty nation. Great\r\nprivileges and great powers are ours, and heavy are the responsibilities\r\nthat go with these privileges and these powers. Accordingly as we do\r\nwell or ill, so shall mankind in the future be raised or cast down.\r\nWe belong to a young nation, already of giant strength, yet whose\r\npolitical strength is but a forecast of the power that is to come.\r\nWe stand supreme in a continent, in a hemisphere. East and west we look\r\nacross the two great oceans toward the larger world life in which,\r\nwhether we will or not, we must take an ever-increasing share. And as,\r\nkeen-eyed, we gaze into the coming years, duties, new and old, rise\r\nthick and fast to confront us from within and from without. There is\r\nevery reason why we should face these duties with a sober appreciation\r\nalike of their importance and of their difficulty. But there is also\r\nevery reason for facing them with highhearted resolution and eager and\r\nconfident faith in our capacity to do them aright. A great work lies\r\nalready to the hand of this generation; it should count itself happy,\r\nindeed, that to it is given the privilege of doing such a work. A\r\nleading part therein must be taken by this the august and powerful\r\nlegislative body over which I have been called upon to preside. Most\r\ndeeply do I appreciate the privilege of my position; for high, indeed,\r\nis the honor of presiding over the American Senate at the outset of\r\nthe twentieth century.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, _December 3, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nThe Congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity.\r\nOn the sixth of September, President McKinley was shot by an anarchist\r\nwhile attending the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, and died in that\r\ncity on the fourteenth of that month.\r\n\r\nOf the last seven elected Presidents, he is the third who has been\r\nmurdered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify\r\ngrave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the\r\ncircumstances of this, the third assassination of an American President,\r\nhave a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President Lincoln and\r\nPresident Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not\r\nuncommon in history; President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible\r\npassions aroused by four years of civil war, and President Garfield\r\nto the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office-seeker. President\r\nMcKinley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belonging to that\r\nbody of criminals who object to all governments, good and bad alike,\r\nwho are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even\r\nthe most just and liberal laws, and who are as hostile to the upright\r\nexponent of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical and\r\nirresponsible despot.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's\r\ndeath he was the most widely loved man in all the United States; while\r\nwe have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly\r\nfree from the bitter animosities incident to public life. His political\r\nopponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute\r\nto the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness of\r\ncharacter which so endeared him to his close associates. To a standard\r\nof lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affections and\r\nhome virtues which are all-important in the make-up of national\r\ncharacter. A gallant soldier in the great war for the Union, he also\r\nshone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most\r\nsacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred\r\nof him, for he never acted with aught but consideration for the welfare\r\nof others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or\r\nprivate life. The defenders of those murderous criminals who seek to\r\nexcuse their criminality by asserting that it is exercised for political\r\nends, inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this\r\nassassination even this base apology cannot be urged.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang\r\nfrom the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the\r\nwage-workers, who had entered the Army as a private soldier. Wealth was\r\nnot struck at when the President was assassinated, but the honest toil\r\nwhich is content with moderate gains after a lifetime of unremitting\r\nlabor, largely in the service of the public. Still less was power struck\r\nat in the sense that power is irresponsible or centered in the hands of\r\nany one individual. The blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth. It was\r\naimed at one of the strongest champions the wage-worker has ever had; at\r\none of the most faithful representatives of the system of public rights\r\nand representative government who has ever risen to public office.\r\nPresident McKinley filled that political office for which the entire\r\npeople vote, and no President--not even Lincoln himself--was ever more\r\nearnestly anxious to represent the well thought-out wishes of the\r\npeople; his one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch\r\nwith the people--to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give\r\nexpression to their thought, after having endeavored to guide that\r\nthought aright. He had just been re-elected to the Presidency because\r\nthe majority of our citizens, the majority of our farmers and\r\nwage-workers, believed that he had faithfully upheld their interests for\r\nfour years. They felt themselves in close and intimate touch with him.\r\nThey felt that he represented so well and so honorably all their ideals\r\nand aspirations that they wished him to continue for another four years\r\nto represent them.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man at whom the assassin struck! That there might be\r\nnothing lacking to complete the Judas-like infamy of his act, he took\r\nadvantage of an occasion when the President was meeting the people\r\ngenerally; and advancing as if to take the hand out-stretched to him\r\nin kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous\r\nconfidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow.\r\nThere is no baser deed in all the annals of crime.\r\n\r\nThe shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all\r\nwho saw the dark days, while the President yet hovered between life and\r\ndeath. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the breath\r\nwent from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of\r\nforgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends, and of unfaltering\r\ntrust in the will of the Most High. Such a death, crowning the glory of\r\nsuch a life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride in what\r\nhe had accomplished and in his own personal character, that we feel the\r\nblow not as struck at him, but as struck at the Nation. We mourn a good\r\nand great President who is dead; but while we mourn we are lifted up by\r\nthe splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which\r\nhe met his death.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from the man to the Nation, the harm done is so great as\r\nto excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most\r\nresolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed by\r\nthe teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless\r\nutterances of those who, on the stump and in the public press, appeal to\r\nthe dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred.\r\nThe wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they cannot\r\nescape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped.\r\nThis applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter of\r\nsensationalism, and to the crude and foolish visionary who, for whatever\r\nreason, apologizes for crime or excites aimless discontent.\r\n\r\nThe blow was aimed not at this President, but at all Presidents; at\r\nevery symbol of government. President McKinley was as emphatically the\r\nembodiment of the popular will of the Nation expressed through the\r\nforms of law as a New England town meeting is in similar fashion the\r\nembodiment of the law-abiding purpose and practice of the people of the\r\ntown. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the President be\r\naccepted as due to protest against \"inequalities in the social order,\"\r\nsave as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meeting could\r\nbe accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a\r\nmalefactor in jail. Anarchy is no more an expression of \"social\r\ndiscontent\" than picking pockets or wife-beating.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist, and especially the anarchist in the United States, is\r\nmerely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he\r\nrepresents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man who advocates\r\nanarchy directly or indirectly, in any shape or fashion, or the man\r\nwho apologizes for anarchists and their deeds, makes himself morally\r\naccessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist is a criminal whose\r\nperverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion and chaos to the most\r\nbeneficent form of social order. His protest of concern for workingmen\r\nis outrageous in its impudent falsity; for if the political institutions\r\nof this country do not afford opportunity to every honest and\r\nintelligent son of toil, then the door of hope is forever closed against\r\nhim. The anarchist is everywhere not merely the enemy of system and of\r\nprogress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy is triumphant,\r\nits triumph will last for but one red moment, to be succeeded for ages\r\nby the gloomy night of despotism.\r\n\r\nFor the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices his\r\ndoctrines, we need not have one particle more concern than for any\r\nordinary murderer. He is not the victim of social or political\r\ninjustice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of his\r\ncriminality is to be found in his own evil passions and in the evil\r\nconduct of those who urge him on, not in any failure by others or by the\r\nState to do justice to him or his. He is a malefactor and nothing else.\r\nHe is in no sense, in no shape or way, a \"product of social conditions,\"\r\nsave as a highwayman is \"produced\" by the fact than an unarmed man\r\nhappens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great and holy names\r\nof liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in such a cause.\r\nNo man or body of men preaching anarchistic doctrines should be allowed\r\nat large any more than if preaching the murder of some specified private\r\nindividual. Anarchistic speeches, writings, and meetings are essentially\r\nseditious and treasonable.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exercise of its wise\r\ndiscretion it should take into consideration the coming to this country\r\nof anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all government\r\nand justifying the murder of those placed in authority. Such individuals\r\nas those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder\r\nof King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should ensure\r\ntheir rigorous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out\r\nof this country; and if found here they should be promptly deported to\r\nthe country whence they came; and far-reaching provision should be made\r\nfor the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for\r\nthe wisest thought of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills\r\nor attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution or\r\nby law is in line of succession for the Presidency, while the punishment\r\nfor an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of\r\nthe offense against our institutions.\r\n\r\nAnarchy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind should\r\nband against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against\r\nthe law of nations, like piracy and that form of man-stealing known as\r\nthe slave trade; for it is of far blacker infamy than either. It should\r\nbe so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treaties\r\nwould give to the Federal Government the power of dealing with the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nA grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded\r\nby the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just taken\r\nthe life of the President. The people would have torn him limb from limb\r\nif it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in his\r\nbehalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf of the people\r\nagainst the Government, the Government was obliged at once to exert its\r\nfull police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the\r\npeople. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest dislocation in our\r\ngovernmental system, and the danger of a recurrence of such deeds, no\r\nmatter how great it might grow, would work only in the direction of\r\nstrengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order. No man\r\nwill ever be restrained from becoming President by any fear as to his\r\npersonal safety. If the risk to the President's life became great, it\r\nwould mean that the office would more and more come to be filled by men\r\nof a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in dealing\r\nwith every friend of disorder. This great country will not fall into\r\nanarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its\r\ninstitutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in\r\ntheir own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines.\r\nThe American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once\r\nkindled it burns like a consuming flame.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years business confidence has been restored,\r\nand the nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding\r\nprosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, although\r\nit is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the\r\nLord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought comes, human wisdom\r\nis powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us\r\nagainst the consequences of our own folly. The men who are idle or\r\ncredulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or hand\r\nbut by gambling in any form, are always a source of menace not only\r\nto themselves but to others. If the business world loses its head,\r\nit loses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare of\r\neach citizen, and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens\r\nwhich makes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy,\r\nresolution, and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this\r\nindividual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and intelligent\r\nadministration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity\r\nto work to good effect.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on\r\nwith ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with\r\nvery serious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs which\r\nhad almost the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient to\r\nregulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the\r\nindustrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive\r\npower of mankind, they are no longer sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the\r\ngrowth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial\r\ncenters has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of\r\nwealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially of\r\nvery large corporate, fortunes. The creation of these great corporate\r\nfortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental\r\naction, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in other\r\ncountries as they operate in our own.\r\n\r\nThe process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is wholly\r\nwithout warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the\r\npoor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average\r\nman, the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off\r\nas in this country and at the present time. There have been abuses\r\nconnected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it remains true that a\r\nfortune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by the\r\nperson specially benefited only on condition of conferring immense\r\nincidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the type\r\nwhich benefits all mankind, can only exist if the conditions are such\r\nas to offer great prizes as the rewards of success.\r\n\r\nThe captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across\r\nthis continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our\r\nmanufactures, have on the whole done great good to our people. Without\r\nthem the material development of which we are so justly proud could\r\nnever have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immense\r\nimportance of this material development of leaving as unhampered as is\r\ncompatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom\r\nthe success of business operations inevitably rests. The slightest study\r\nof business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a judgment\r\nthat the personal equation is the most important factor in a business\r\noperation; that the business ability of the man at the head of any\r\nbusiness concern, big or little, is usually the factor which fixes\r\nthe gulf between striking success and hopeless failure.\r\n\r\nAn additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be\r\nfound in the international commercial conditions of today. The same\r\nbusiness conditions which have produced the great aggregations of\r\ncorporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors\r\nin international commercial competition. Business concerns which have\r\nthe largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men\r\nare naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial\r\nsupremacy among the nations of the world. America has only just begun\r\nto assume that commanding position in the international business world\r\nwhich we believe will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that this position be not jeoparded, especially at a time\r\nwhen the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the\r\nskill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people make\r\nforeign markets essential. Under such conditions it would be most\r\nunwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with\r\nignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably\r\nendangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national\r\nlife--the rule which underlies all others--is that, on the whole, and in\r\nthe long run, we shall go up or down together. There are exceptions;\r\nand in times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times\r\nof adversity, some will suffer far more, than others; but speaking\r\ngenerally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in\r\nthem, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or\r\nless degree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof\r\nof this statement; the memory of the lean years which began in 1893 is\r\nstill vivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very\r\nyear which is now closing. Disaster to great business enterprises\r\ncan never have its effects limited to the men at the top. It spreads\r\nthrough-out, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worst for those\r\nfarthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries; but the\r\nwage-worker may be deprived of even bare necessities.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must\r\nbe taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\r\nMany of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the great\r\nindustrial combinations which are popularly, although with technical\r\ninaccuracy, known as \"trusts,\" appeal especially to hatred and fear.\r\nThese are precisely the two emotions, particularly when combined with\r\nignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady judgment.\r\nIn facing new industrial conditions, the whole history of the world\r\nshows that legislation will generally be both unwise and ineffective\r\nunless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self-restraint.\r\nMuch of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been\r\nexceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirely ineffective.\r\nIn accordance with a well-known sociological law, the ignorant or\r\nreckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils\r\nwhich he has been nominally opposing. In dealing with business\r\ninterests, for the Government to undertake by crude and ill-considered\r\nlegislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to incur the\r\nrisk of such far-reaching national disaster that it would be preferable\r\nto undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the\r\nundesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are\r\nnominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out\r\nin rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and\r\nin what manner it is practicable to apply remedies.\r\n\r\nAll this is true; and yet it is also true that there are real and grave\r\nevils, one of the chief being over-capitalization because of its many\r\nbaleful consequences; and a resolute and practical effort must be made\r\nto correct these evils.\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people\r\nthat the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their\r\nfeatures and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs\r\nfrom no spirit of envy or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in the\r\ngreat industrial achievements that have placed this country at the head\r\nof the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It does not rest\r\nupon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meeting\r\nchanging and changed conditions of trade with new methods, nor upon\r\nignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort to\r\naccomplish great things is necessary when the world's progress demands\r\nthat great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction that\r\ncombination and concentration should be, not prohibited, but supervised\r\nand within reasonable limits controlled; and in my judgment this\r\nconviction is right.\r\n\r\nIt is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to\r\nrequire that when men receive from Government the privilege of doing\r\nbusiness under corporate form, which frees them from individual\r\nresponsibility, and enables them to call into their enterprises the\r\ncapital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful\r\nrepresentations as to the value of the property in which the capital is\r\nto be invested. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be\r\nregulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public\r\ninjury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social\r\nbetterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the\r\nentire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist only\r\nbecause they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is\r\ntherefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with\r\nthese institutions.\r\n\r\nThe first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial\r\ncombinations is knowledge of the facts--publicity. In the interest of\r\nthe public, the Government should have the right to inspect and examine\r\nthe workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business.\r\nPublicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further\r\nremedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation, or taxation,\r\ncan only be determined after publicity has been obtained, by process\r\nof law, and in the course of administration. The first requisite is\r\nknowledge, full and complete--knowledge which may be made public to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nArtificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other\r\nassociations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or\r\nprivileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and\r\nfull and accurate information as to their operations should be made\r\npublic regularly at reasonable intervals.\r\n\r\nThe large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in\r\none State, always do business in many States, often doing very little\r\nbusiness in the State where they are incorporated. There is utter lack\r\nof uniformity in the State laws about them; and as no State has any\r\nexclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice\r\nproved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action.\r\nTherefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should,\r\nwithout interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself,\r\nalso assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business. This is especially true where the\r\ncorporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some\r\nmonopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no\r\nhardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their case\r\nit is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is probable\r\nthat supervision of corporations by the National Government need not go\r\nso far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by\r\nso conservative a State as Massachusetts, in order to produce excellent\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in\r\nindustrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a\r\nmatter of course that the several States were the proper authorities to\r\nregulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively insignificant\r\nand strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are\r\nnow wholly different and wholly different action is called for. I believe\r\nthat a law can be framed which will enable the National Government\r\nto exercise control along the lines above indicated; profiting by\r\nthe experience gained through the passage and administration of the\r\nInterstate-Commerce Act. If, however, the judgment of the Congress\r\nis that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act, then\r\na constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power.\r\n\r\nThere should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary of\r\nCommerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last\r\nsession of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce\r\nin its broadest sense; including among many other things whatever\r\nconcerns labor and all matters affecting the great business corporations\r\nand our merchant marine.\r\n\r\nThe course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive\r\nand far-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose\r\nof broadening our markets, securing our business interests on a safe\r\nbasis, and making firm our new position in the international industrial\r\nworld; while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage-worker and\r\ncapitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to secure equity as\r\nbetween man and man in this Republic.\r\n\r\nWith the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter\r\nis of such vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the\r\nwage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it is\r\nabsolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It Is therefore\r\na matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages are higher\r\nto-day in the United States than ever before in our history, and far\r\nhigher than in any other country. The standard of living is also higher\r\nthan ever before. Every effort of legislator and administrator should\r\nbe bent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and its\r\nimprovement wherever possible. Not only must our labor be protected by\r\nthe tariff, but it should also be protected so far as it is possible\r\nfrom the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by\r\ncontract, or of those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of\r\nliving so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market\r\nand drag them to a lower level. I regard it as necessary, with this end\r\nin view, to re-enact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and\r\nto strengthen it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement\r\nentirely effective.\r\n\r\nThe National Government should demand the highest quality of service\r\nfrom its employees; and in return it should be a good employer. If\r\npossible legislation should be passed, in connection with the Interstate\r\nCommerce Law, which will render effective the efforts of different\r\nStates to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in\r\nthe open labor market. So far as practicable under the conditions of\r\nGovernment work, provision should be made to render the enforcement\r\nof the eight-hour law easy and certain. In all industries carried on\r\ndirectly or indirectly for the United States Government women and\r\nchildren should be protected from excessive hours of labor, from night\r\nwork, and from work under unsanitary conditions. The Government should\r\nprovide in its contracts that all work should be done under \"fair\"\r\nconditions, and in addition to setting a high standard should uphold\r\nit by proper inspection, extending if necessary to the subcontractors.\r\nThe Government should forbid all night work for women and children, as\r\nwell as excessive overtime. For the District of Columbia a good factory\r\nlaw should be passed; and, as a powerful indirect aid to such laws,\r\nprovision should be made to turn the inhabited alleys, the existence of\r\nwhich is a reproach to our Capital city, into minor streets, where the\r\ninhabitants can live under conditions favorable to health and morals.\r\n\r\nAmerican wage-workers work with their heads as well as their hands.\r\nMoreover, they take a keen pride in what they are doing; so that,\r\nindependent of the reward, they wish to turn out a perfect job. This is\r\nthe great secret of our success in competition with the labor of foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the\r\nwhole civilized world, has to deal, is the problem which has for one\r\nside the betterment of social conditions, moral and physical, in large\r\ncities, and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of\r\nfar-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of \"labor.\"\r\nThe chief factor in the success of each man--wage-worker, farmer, and\r\ncapitalist alike--must ever be the sum total of his own individual\r\nqualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the power of acting\r\nin combination or association with others. Very great good has been and\r\nwill be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-workers, when\r\nmanaged with forethought, and when they combine insistence upon their\r\nown rights with law-abiding respect for the rights of others. The\r\ndisplay of these qualities in such bodies is a duty to the nation no\r\nless than to the associations themselves. Finally, there must also in\r\nmany cases be action by the Government in order to safeguard the rights\r\nand interests of all. Under our Constitution there is much more scope\r\nfor such action by the State and the municipality than by the nation.\r\nBut on points such as those touched on above the National Government\r\ncan act.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the\r\nindispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for\r\nwhich we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless he so works\r\nno outside help can avail him; but each man must remember also that he\r\nis indeed his brother's keeper, and that while no man who refuses to\r\nwalk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else, yet that\r\neach at times stumbles or halts, that each at times needs to have the\r\nhelping hand outstretched to him. To be permanently effective, aid must\r\nalways take the form of helping a man to help himself; and we can all\r\nbest help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of common\r\ninterest to all.\r\n\r\nOur present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. We need every honest\r\nand efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, every\r\nimmigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a stout\r\nheart, a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in every\r\nway and to bring up his children as law-abiding and God-fearing members\r\nof the community. But there should be a comprehensive law enacted with\r\nthe object of working a threefold improvement over our present system.\r\nFirst, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who\r\nare known to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of\r\nanarchistic societies, but also all persons who are of a low moral\r\ntendency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we should require\r\na more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system\r\nof examination at our immigration ports, the former being especially\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by\r\na careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent\r\ncapacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American\r\ncitizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them\r\nbelong to the intelligent criminal class. But it would do what is also\r\nin point, that is, tend to decrease the sum of ignorance, so potent in\r\nproducing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and hatred of order,\r\nout of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Finally, all\r\npersons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic\r\nfitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American\r\nlabor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an\r\nAmerican living and enough money to insure a decent start under American\r\nconditions. This would stop the influx of cheap labor, and the resulting\r\ncompetition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in American\r\nindustrial life; and it would dry up the springs of the pestilential\r\nsocial conditions in our great cities, where anarchistic organizations\r\nhave their greatest possibility of growth.\r\n\r\nBoth the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should\r\nbe designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and social.\r\nA very close supervision should be exercised over the steamship\r\ncompanies which mainly bring over the immigrants, and they should be\r\nheld to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law.\r\n\r\nThere is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a\r\nnational policy. The first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity\r\nand stability of this economic policy. Nothing could be more unwise than\r\nto disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff\r\nchange at this time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertainty are exactly what\r\nwe most wish to avoid in the interest of our commercial and material\r\nwell-being. Our experience in the past has shown that sweeping revisions\r\nof the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely approaching panic\r\nin the business world. Yet it is not only possible, but eminently\r\ndesirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a\r\nsupplementary system of reciprocal benefit and obligation with other\r\nnations. Such reciprocity is an incident and result of the firm\r\nestablishment and preservation of our present economic policy.\r\nIt was specially provided for in the present tariff law.\r\n\r\nReciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first\r\nduty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case\r\nwhere it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so\r\nfar as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries. Just\r\nhow far this is must be determined according to the individual case,\r\nremembering always that every application of our tariff policy to meet\r\nour shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact\r\nthat the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover\r\nthe difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being\r\nof the wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of\r\neconomic legislation.\r\n\r\nSubject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our\r\nindustrial well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command\r\nour hearty support. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes\r\nthe urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in\r\ndealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty and vexatious\r\nin the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to\r\nwhom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run, directly or\r\nindirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us something in\r\nreturn. Their ability to purchase our products should as far as possible\r\nbe secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them\r\nthose products which we can use without harm to our own industries and\r\nlabor, or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that we should maintain the high level of our\r\npresent prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development of\r\nour interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets but\r\nto produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets\r\nabroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in any\r\ncase where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protection,\r\nor in any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is\r\nno longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in\r\nexchange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other nations which\r\nare so desirable will naturally be promoted by the course thus required\r\nby our own interests.\r\n\r\nThe natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in\r\nconnection with those of our productions which no longer require all of\r\nthe support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with\r\nthose others where either because of natural or of economic causes we\r\nare beyond the reach of successful competition.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid\r\nbefore it by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for\r\nimmediate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us\r\nas a Nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in\r\ncomparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of\r\nbusiness. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only\r\na trifling portion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships.\r\nTo remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our\r\nshipping interests, but it would also result in benefit to all who are\r\ninterested in the permanent establishment of a wider market for American\r\nproducts, and would provide an auxiliary force for the Navy. Ships\r\nwork for their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal\r\npoints. Shipping lines, if established to the principal countries with\r\nwhich we have dealings, would be of political as well as commercial\r\nbenefit. From every standpoint it is unwise for the United States\r\nto continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the\r\ndistribution of our goods. It should be made advantageous to carry\r\nAmerican goods in American-built ships.\r\n\r\nAt present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when\r\nput in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the\r\nfast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are\r\nsubsidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike, cargo\r\ncarriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have to meet the\r\nfact that the original cost of building American ships is greater than\r\nis the case abroad; that the wages paid American officers and seamen\r\nare very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen of foreign\r\ncompeting countries; and that the standard of living on our ships is\r\nfar superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nOur Government should take such action as will remedy these\r\ninequalities. The American merchant marine should be restored to\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 14, 1900, intended unequivocally to establish gold as\r\nthe standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of\r\nmoney medium in use with us, has been shown to be timely and judicious.\r\nThe price of our Government bonds in the world's market, when compared\r\nwith the price of similar obligations issued by other nations, is a\r\nflattering tribute to our public credit. This condition it is evidently\r\ndesirable to maintain\r\n\r\nIn many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty\r\nfor the proper exercise of the banking function; but there seems to be\r\nneed of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial\r\ncrises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country\r\nshould be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue to\r\nexceed the ordinary expenditures of the Government, thanks mainly to the\r\nreduced army expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to reduce\r\nthe revenues so that there will be any possibility of a deficit; but,\r\nafter providing against any such contingency, means should be adopted\r\nwhich will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual\r\nneeds. In his report to the Congress the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nconsiders all these questions at length, and I ask your attention to the\r\nreport and recommendations.\r\n\r\nI call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures.\r\nThe fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing\r\nwhatever is actually necessary to our well-being, should make us doubly\r\ncareful to husband our national resources, as each of us husbands his\r\nprivate resources, by scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful or\r\nreckless expenditure. Only by avoidance of spending money on what is\r\nneedless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to the\r\npoint required to meet our needs that are genuine.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate railways,\r\ncommonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinal provisions\r\nof that act were that railway rates should be just and reasonable and\r\nthat all shippers, localities, and commodities should be accorded equal\r\ntreatment. A commission was created and endowed with what were supposed\r\nto be the necessary powers to execute the provisions of this act.\r\n\r\nThat law was largely an experiment. Experience has shewn the wisdom of\r\nits purposes, but has also shown, possibly that some of its requirements\r\nare wrong, certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its\r\nprovisions are defective. Those who complain of the management of the\r\nrailways allege that established rates are not maintained; that rebates\r\nand similar devices are habitually resorted to; that these preferences\r\nare usually in favor of the large shipper; that they drive out of\r\nbusiness the smaller competitor; that while many rates are too low, many\r\nothers are excessive; and that gross preferences are made, affecting\r\nboth localities and commodities. Upon the other hand, the railways\r\nassert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many of these\r\nillegal practices by depriving carriers of that right of concerted\r\naction which they claim is necessary to establish and maintain\r\nnon-discriminating rates.\r\n\r\nThe act should be amended. The railway is a public servant. Its rates\r\nshould be just to and open to all shippers alike. The Government should\r\nsee to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a\r\nspeedy, inexpensive, and effective remedy to that end. At the same time\r\nit must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through\r\nwhich the commercial lifeblood of this Nation flows. Nothing could be\r\nmore foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily\r\ninterfere with the development and operation of these commercial\r\nagencies. The subject is one of great importance and calls for the\r\nearnest attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture during the past fifteen years has steadily\r\nbroadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplished results of\r\nreal value in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade. It has gone into\r\nnew fields until it is now in touch with all sections of our country\r\nand with two of the island groups that have lately come under our\r\njurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood.\r\nIt is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits, and vegetables\r\nspecially fitted for introduction into localities in the several States\r\nand Territories where they may add materially to our resources. By\r\nscientific attention to soil survey and possible new crops, to breeding\r\nof new varieties of plants, to experimental shipments, to animal\r\nindustry and applied chemistry, very practical aid has been given our\r\nfarming and stock-growing interests. The products of the farm have taken\r\nan unprecedented place in our export trade during the year that has just\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a\r\njust appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of natural\r\ngrowth. The great part played by them in the creation and maintenance of\r\nthe national wealth is now more fully realized than ever before.\r\n\r\nWise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources,\r\nwhether of wood, water, or grass, from contributing their full share to\r\nthe welfare of the people, but, on the contrary, gives the assurance of\r\nlarger and more certain supplies. The fundamental idea of forestry is\r\nthe perpetuation of forests by use. Forest protection is not an end\r\nof itself; it is a means to increase and sustain the resources of our\r\ncountry and the industries which depend upon them. The preservation of\r\nour forests is an imperative business necessity. We have come to see\r\nclearly that whatever destroys the forest, except to make way for\r\nagriculture, threatens our well being.\r\n\r\nThe practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining,\r\ngrazing, irrigation, and other interests of the regions in which the\r\nreserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people of the West\r\nfor their protection and extension. The forest reserves will inevitably\r\nbe of still greater use in the future than in the past. Additions should\r\nbe made to them whenever practicable, and their usefulness should be\r\nincreased by a thoroughly business-like management.\r\n\r\nAt present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the General\r\nLand Office, the mapping and description of their timber with the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for their\r\nconservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged with\r\nthe general advancement of practical forestry in the United States.\r\nThese various functions should be united in the Bureau of Forestry,\r\nto which they properly belong. The present diffusion of responsibility\r\nis bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective co-operation\r\nbetween the Government and the men who utilize the resources of the\r\nreserves, without which the interests of both must suffer. The\r\nscientific bureaus generally should be put under the Department of\r\nAgriculture. The President should have by law the power of transferring\r\nlands for use as forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture. He\r\nalready has such power in the case of lands needed by the Departments\r\nof War and the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful\r\nto the interests which depend on water than to those which depend on\r\nwood and grass. The water supply itself depends upon the forest. In\r\nthe arid region it is water, not land, which measures production. The\r\nwestern half of the United States would sustain a population greater\r\nthan that of our whole country to-day if the waters that now run to\r\nwaste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest and water problems\r\nare perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States.\r\n\r\nCertain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the\r\nwild forest creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected\r\nfrom fires. Many of them need special protection because of the great\r\ninjury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer,\r\nelk, and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may be\r\nexpected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law and\r\nproperly guarded. Some of these areas have been so denuded of surface\r\nvegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds, including\r\ngrouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have been\r\nexterminated or driven away. At the same time the water-storing capacity\r\nof the surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus promoting floods in\r\ntimes of rain and diminishing the flow of streams between rains.\r\n\r\nIn cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few\r\nyears, vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are\r\ncoming back, and hundreds of persons, especially from the immediate\r\nneighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping.\r\nSome at least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection\r\nto the native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly\r\ndiminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping grounds\r\nfor the ever-increasing numbers of men and women who have learned\r\nto find rest, health, and recreation in the splendid forests and\r\nflower-clad meadows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be set\r\napart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and not\r\nsacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few.\r\n\r\nThe forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood\r\nand replenishing them in drought they make possible the use of waters\r\notherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protect the\r\nstorage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation is\r\ntherefore an essential condition of water conservation.\r\n\r\nThe forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the\r\nwaters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to equalize\r\nthe flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construction\r\nhas been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private\r\neffort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual States acting\r\nalone. Far-reaching interstate problems are involved; and the resources\r\nof single States would often be inadequate. It is properly a national\r\nfunction, at least in some of its features. It is as right for the\r\nNational Government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region\r\nuseful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the\r\nrivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another\r\nkind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our\r\nrivers is but an enlargement of our present policy of river control,\r\nunder which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams.\r\n\r\nThe Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it\r\ndoes other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of\r\nstreams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry\r\nseason to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different\r\nproblem. Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The\r\nobject of the Government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will\r\nbuild homes upon it. To accomplish this object water must be brought\r\nwithin their reach.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along\r\nstreams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim\r\ntheir holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain,\r\nhowever, vast areas of public land which can be made available for\r\nhomestead settlement, but only by reservoirs and main-line canals\r\nimpracticable for private enterprise. These irrigation works should be\r\nbuilt by the National Government. The lands reclaimed by them should\r\nbe reserved by the Government for actual settlers, and the cost of\r\nconstruction should so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaimed.\r\nThe distribution of the water, the division of the streams among\r\nirrigators, should be left to the settlers themselves in conformity\r\nwith State laws and without interference with those laws or with\r\nvested rights. The policy of the National Government should be to aid\r\nirrigation in the several States and Territories in such manner as will\r\nenable the people in the local communities to help themselves, and as\r\nwill stimulate needed reforms in the State laws and regulations\r\ngoverning irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every\r\nportion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and\r\nMississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States. The\r\nincreased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial\r\nproduction, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume\r\nthe larger food supplies and effectually prevent Western competition\r\nwith Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation will be\r\nconsumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of mining and other\r\nindustries, which would otherwise not come into existence at all.\r\nOur people as a whole will profit, for successful home-making is but\r\nanother name for the upbuilding of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration\r\nof the policy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing too\r\nmuch, for a great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what can\r\nand what cannot be safely attempted, by the early efforts, which must\r\nof necessity be partly experimental in character. At the very beginning\r\nthe Government should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt, its intention\r\nto pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public interest. No\r\nreservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal\r\nor local interests; but only in accordance with the advice of trained\r\nexperts, after long investigation has shown the locality where all the\r\nconditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the\r\ngreatest usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be no\r\nextravagance, and the believers in the need of irrigation will most\r\nbenefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the least\r\ntaint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys.\r\n\r\nWhatever the nation does for the extension of irrigation should\r\nharmonize with, and tend to improve, the condition of those now living\r\non irrigated land. We are not at the starting point of this development.\r\nOver two hundred millions of private capital has already been expended\r\nin the construction of irrigation works, and many million acres of arid\r\nland reclaimed. A high degree of enterprise and ability has been shown\r\nin the work itself; but as much cannot be said in reference to the laws\r\nrelating thereto. The security and value of the homes created depend\r\nlargely on the stability of titles to water; but the majority of these\r\nrest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered in ordinary\r\nsuits at law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid States have\r\nfailed to provide for the certain and just division of streams in times\r\nof scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish\r\nrights to water in excess of actual uses or necessities, and many\r\nstreams have already passed into private ownership, or a control\r\nequivalent to ownership.\r\n\r\nWhoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders\r\nproductive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from\r\nland cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of\r\nsuch ownership, which has been permitted to grow up in the arid regions,\r\nshould give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the\r\nrights of the public in the control and disposal of the public water\r\nsupplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid regions, where\r\nwater is too abundant to justify hoarding it, have no proper application\r\nin a dry country.\r\n\r\nIn the arid States the only right to water which should be recognized\r\nis that of use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land\r\nreclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rights\r\nto others than users, without compensation to the public, is open to all\r\nthe objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the\r\npublic utilities of cities. A few of the Western States have already\r\nrecognized this, and have incorporated in their constitutions the\r\ndoctrine of perpetual State ownership of water.\r\n\r\nThe benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past\r\njustify the nation's aid and co-operation in the more difficult and\r\nimportant work yet to be accomplished. Laws so vitally affecting homes\r\nas those which control the water supply will only be effective when they\r\nhave the sanction of the irrigators; reforms can only be final and\r\nsatisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of the people most\r\nconcerned. The larger development which national aid insures should,\r\nhowever, awaken in every arid State the determination to make its\r\nirrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness that of any country\r\nin the civilized world. Nothing could be more unwise than for isolated\r\ncommunities to continue to learn everything experimentally, instead of\r\nprofiting by what is already known elsewhere. We are dealing with a new\r\nand momentous question, in the pregnant years while institutions are\r\nforming, and what we do will affect not only the present but future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nOur aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and\r\nprovide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this\r\nnew industry the best possible social and industrial conditions; and\r\nthis requires that we not only understand the existing situation, but\r\navail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution of\r\nits problems. A careful study should be made, both by the Nation and\r\nthe States, of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad.\r\nUltimately it will probably be necessary for the Nation to co-operate\r\nwith the several arid States in proportion as these States by their\r\nlegislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it.\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii our aim must be to develop the Territory on the traditional\r\nAmerican lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap\r\nlabor; we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till\r\nthe farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be shaped\r\nwith this end in view; the well-being of the average home-maker must\r\nafford the true test of the healthy development of the islands. The land\r\npolicy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as\r\nto Puerto Rico than as to any State or Territory within our continental\r\nlimits. The island is thriving as never before, and it is being\r\nadministered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoying\r\nliberty and order under the protection of the United States, and upon\r\nthis fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfare\r\nmust be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any\r\nother portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free\r\naccess for their products to the markets of the United States. I ask\r\nthe attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the\r\npublic lands of Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent\r\ngovernment of the island upon a firm footing that before the present\r\nsession of the Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba\r\nwill then start as her own mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of the\r\nAntilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend our\r\nheartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the\r\nquestion of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty\r\nreasons of morality and of national interest why the policy should be\r\nheld to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask your\r\nattention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of providing for a\r\nsubstantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the\r\nUnited States. Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired,\r\nthat she should stand, in international matters, in closer and more\r\nfriendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are bound\r\nby every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial\r\nmeasures in the interest of her material well-being.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropical\r\nislands, inhabited by many varying tribes, representing widely different\r\nstages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort is to help\r\nthese people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to\r\nself-government. We hope to make our administration of the islands\r\nhonorable to our Nation by making it of the highest benefit to the\r\nFilipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we intend to do, we\r\npoint to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material\r\nprosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained\r\nin the Philippines than ever before in their history.\r\n\r\nIt is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities\r\nwithout which the institutions of free government are but an empty\r\nmockery. Our people are now successfully governing themselves, because\r\nfor more than a thousand years they have been slowly fitting themselves,\r\nsometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, toward this end. What\r\nhas taken us thirty generations to achieve, we cannot expect to see\r\nanother race accomplish out of hand, especially when large portions\r\nof that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors had\r\nreached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the Philippine\r\npeople we must show both patience and strength, forbearance and\r\nsteadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for the\r\nislanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even\r\nthe best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has never\r\nbefore been done for any people of the tropics--to make them fit for\r\nself-government after the fashion of the really free nations.\r\n\r\nHistory may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which a\r\nmasterful race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies of war\r\nto take possession of an alien land, has behaved to its inhabitants with\r\nthe disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in\r\nthe Philippines. To leave the islands at this time would mean that they\r\nwould fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertion of duty on\r\nour part would be a crime against humanity. The character of Governor\r\nTaft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof, if such be\r\nneeded, of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders a\r\nconstantly increasing measure of self-government, exactly as fast as\r\nthey show themselves fit to exercise it. Since the civil government was\r\nestablished not an appointment has been made in the islands with any\r\nreference to considerations of political influence, or to aught else\r\nsave the fitness of the man and the needs of the service.\r\n\r\nIn our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, it may\r\nbe that here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them local\r\nself-government. It is on this side that our error, if any, has been\r\ncommitted. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of finding out the\r\nfacts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives,\r\ncan assert that we have not gone far enough. We have gone to the very\r\nverge of safety in hastening the process. To have taken a single step\r\nfarther or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness, and\r\nmight well have been crime. We are extremely anxious that the natives\r\nshall show the power of governing themselves. We are anxious, first for\r\ntheir sakes, and next, because it relieves us of a great burden. There\r\nneed not be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them all\r\nthe liberty for which they are fit.\r\n\r\nThe only fear is lest in our overanxiety we give them a degree of\r\nindependence for which they are unfit, thereby inviting reaction and\r\ndisaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that in a given\r\ndistrict the people can govern themselves, self-government has\r\nbeen given in that district. There is not a locality fitted for\r\nself-government which has not received it. But it may well be that in\r\ncertain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants show\r\nthemselves unfit to exercise it; such instances have already occurred.\r\nIn other words, there is not the slightest chance of our failing to show\r\na sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThere are still troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection has\r\nbecome an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher\r\nregard than the brigands of portions of the Old World. Encouragement,\r\ndirect or indirect, to these insurrectors stands on the same footing as\r\nencouragement to hostile Indians in the days when we still had Indian\r\nwars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remains peaceful\r\nthe fullest and amplest consideration, but to have it understood that\r\nwe will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath, so we must make it\r\nevident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands of\r\ncivilization and humanity, that while we will do everything in our power\r\nfor the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take the sternest measures\r\nwith the Filipino who follows the path of the insurrecto and the\r\nladrone.\r\n\r\nThe heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of the\r\nislands for their steadfast loyalty. The Macabebes have been conspicuous\r\nfor their courage and devotion to the flag. I recommend that the\r\nSecretary of War be empowered to take some systematic action in the way\r\nof aiding those of these men who are crippled in the service and the\r\nfamilies of those who are killed.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when there should be additional legislation for\r\nthe Philippines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than to\r\nintroduce industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so much as\r\nthrowing them open to industrial development. The connection between\r\nidleness and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity to do\r\nremunerative work is one of the surest preventatives of war. Of course\r\nno business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to his\r\ninterest to do so; and it is immensely to the interest of the islands\r\nthat he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the Congress should\r\npass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed; so\r\nthat franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies\r\ndoing business in them, and every encouragement be given to the incoming\r\nof business men of every kind.\r\n\r\nNot to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises\r\nmust be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which\r\nwill guarantee the islands against any kind of improper exploitation.\r\nBut the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the\r\ncapital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity. The field\r\nmust be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real\r\nfactor in the development of every region over which our flag has flown.\r\nIt is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general\r\ntransportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads, and the use and\r\nownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give free play to\r\nindustrial enterprise; and the commercial development which will surely\r\nfollow will accord to the people of the islands the best proofs of the\r\nsincerity of our desire to aid them.\r\n\r\nI call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to\r\nHawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to\r\npoints in Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the\r\nconstruction of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercial\r\nbut for political and military considerations.\r\n\r\nEither the Congress should immediately provide for the construction of\r\na Government cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which like\r\nadvantages to those accruing from a Government cable may be secured to\r\nthe Government by contract with a private cable company.\r\n\r\nNo single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this\r\ncontinent is of such consequence to the American people as the building\r\nof a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. Its\r\nimportance to the Nation is by no means limited merely to its material\r\neffects upon our business prosperity; and yet with view to these effects\r\nalone it would be to the last degree important for us immediately to\r\nbegin it. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon\r\nthe Pacific Coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic States, it would also\r\ngreatly benefit other sections. It is emphatically a work which it is\r\nfor the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as\r\npossible; it is one of those great works which only a great nation can\r\nundertake with prospects of success, and which when done are not only\r\npermanent assets in the nation's material interests, but standing\r\nmonuments to its constructive ability.\r\n\r\nI am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this\r\nsubject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of\r\nfriendliness and mutual good will and respect, have resulted in my being\r\nable to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified will enable\r\nus to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time, and which\r\nguarantees to this Nation every right that it has ever asked in\r\nconnection with the canal. In this treaty, the old Clayton-Bulwer\r\ntreaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is\r\nabrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall\r\ndo the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding\r\nthe canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of\r\nequality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nation from\r\nany quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the Senate,\r\nand if approved the Congress can then proceed to give effect to the\r\nadvantages it secures us by providing for the building of the canal.\r\n\r\nThe true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting\r\npeace; and this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial\r\nfriendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years, wars\r\nbetween the great civilized powers have become less and less frequent.\r\nWars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come in an entirely\r\ndifferent category, being merely a most regrettable but necessary\r\ninternational police duty which must be performed for the sake of the\r\nwelfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certainty where both\r\nsides wish to keep it; but more and more the civilized peoples are\r\nrealizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that condition of\r\njust and intelligent regard for the rights of others which will in the\r\nend, as we hope and believe, make world-wide peace possible. The peace\r\nconference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief\r\nand marked a stride toward their attainment.\r\n\r\nThis same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy\r\nof all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United States.\r\nJust seventy-eight years have passed since President Monroe in his\r\nAnnual Message announced that \"The American continents are henceforth\r\nnot to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European\r\npower.\" In other words, the Monroe Doctrine is a declaration that there\r\nmust be no territorial aggrandizement by any non-American power at\r\nthe expense of any American power on American soil. It is in no wise\r\nintended as hostile to any nation in the Old World. Still less is it\r\nintended to give cover to any aggression by one New World power at\r\nthe expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward\r\nassuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility\r\nof permanent peace on this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century other influences have established the permanence\r\nand independence of the smaller states of Europe. Through the Monroe\r\nDoctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence and secure\r\nlike permanence for the lesser among the New World nations.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any\r\nAmerican power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form such\r\nas it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of the commercial\r\nindependence of the Americas. We do not ask under this doctrine for\r\nany exclusive commercial dealings with any other American state. We do\r\nnot guarantee any state against punishment if it misconducts itself,\r\nprovided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of\r\nterritory by any non-American power.\r\n\r\nOur attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith.\r\nWe have not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense\r\nof any of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so that\r\nall of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good fortune\r\nof any of them, we gladly hail their material prosperity and political\r\nstability, and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall into\r\nindustrial or political chaos. We do not wish to see any Old World\r\nmilitary power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become\r\na military power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can prosper\r\nbest if left to work out their own salvation in their own way.\r\n\r\nThe work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued. No one point\r\nof our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this to the\r\nhonor and material welfare, and above all to the peace, of our nation in\r\nthe future. Whether we desire it or not, we must henceforth recognize\r\nthat we have international duties no less than international rights.\r\nEven if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and Puerto Rico,\r\neven if we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal, we should need a\r\nthoroughly trained Navy of adequate size, or else be prepared definitely\r\nand for all time to abandon the idea that our nation is among those\r\nwhose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce is always to\r\nbe carried in foreign bottoms, we must have war craft to protect it.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of abandoning\r\nthe path upon which they have entered, and especially in view of the\r\nfact that the building of the Isthmian Canal is fast becoming one of the\r\nmatters which the whole people are united in demanding, it is imperative\r\nthat our Navy should be put and kept in the highest state of efficiency,\r\nand should be made to answer to our growing needs. So far from being in\r\nany way a provocation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is\r\nthe best guaranty against war, the cheapest and most effective peace\r\ninsurance. The cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents\r\nthe very lightest premium for insuring peace which this nation can\r\npossibly pay.\r\n\r\nProbably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace\r\nas we are. There is not a single civilized power which has anything\r\nwhatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want is peace;\r\nand toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for\r\nour rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to their\r\nrights in return, to insure fair treatment to us commercially, and to\r\nguarantee the safety of the American people.\r\n\r\nOur people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it\r\nas the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere.\r\nThe Navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the\r\nMonroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation\r\nchooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to\r\nthe just man armed; not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the\r\ncraven and the weakling.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships\r\nmust be built and the men trained long in advance. Some auxiliary\r\nvessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of any\r\nbetter for the minor work, and a proportion of raw men can be mixed with\r\nthe highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by the skill of\r\ntheir fellows; but the efficient fighting force of the Navy when pitted\r\nagainst an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively in the war\r\nships that have been regularly built and in the officers and men who\r\nthrough years of faithful performance of sea duty have been trained\r\nto handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapons with the\r\nhighest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the\r\ndecisive blows at Manila and Santiago had been launched from two to\r\nfourteen years, and they were able to do as they did because the men in\r\nthe conning towers, the gun turrets, and the engine-rooms had through\r\nlong years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty.\r\n\r\nOur present Navy was begun in 1882. At that period our Navy\r\nconsisted of a collection of antiquated wooden ships, already almost as\r\nout of place against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades\r\nand Hamilcar--certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that\r\ntime did we have men fit to handle a modern man-of-war. Under the wise\r\nlegislation of the Congress and the successful administration of a\r\nsuccession of patriotic Secretaries of the Navy, belonging to both\r\npolitical parties, the work of upbuilding the Navy went on, and ships\r\nequal to any in the world of their kind were continually added; and what\r\nwas even more important, these ships were exercised at sea singly and in\r\nsquadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the best possible\r\nservice out of them. The result was seen in the short war with Spain,\r\nwhich was decided with such rapidity because of the infinitely greater\r\npreparedness of our Navy than of the Spanish Navy.\r\n\r\nWhile awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded\r\nand manned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the\r\nPhilippines and in Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed of praise\r\nbelongs to those without whom neither blow could have been struck. The\r\nCongressmen who voted years in advance the money to lay down the ships,\r\nto build the guns, to buy the armor-plate; the Department officials and\r\nthe business men and wage-workers who furnished what the Congress had\r\nauthorized; the Secretaries of the Navy who asked for and expended the\r\nappropriations; and finally the officers who, in fair weather and foul,\r\non actual sea service, trained and disciplined the crews of the ships\r\nwhen there was no war in sight--all are entitled to a full share in the\r\nglory of Manila and Santiago, and the respect accorded by every true\r\nAmerican to those who wrought such signal triumph for our country.\r\nIt was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming\r\ntriumph of 1898. If we fail to show forethought and preparation now,\r\nthere may come a time when disaster will befall us instead of triumph;\r\nand should this time come, the fault will rest primarily, not upon those\r\nwhom the accident of events puts in supreme command at the moment, but\r\nupon those who have failed to prepare in advance.\r\n\r\nThere should be no cessation in the work of completing our Navy. So far\r\ningenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great\r\nwar craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas.\r\nIt is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional\r\nbattle ships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter\r\ncraft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character I refer you to\r\nthe report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there is something we need\r\neven more than additional ships, and this is additional officers and\r\nmen. To provide battle ships and cruisers and then lay them up, with the\r\nexpectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual\r\nwar, would be worse than folly; it would be a crime against the Nation.\r\n\r\nTo send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it\r\nhave been trained by years of actual sea service, including incessant\r\ngunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but the\r\nbitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and one\r\nthousand additional marines should be provided; and an increase in the\r\nofficers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes\r\nat Annapolis. There is one small matter which should be mentioned in\r\nconnection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmeaning title of \"naval\r\ncadet\" should be abolished; the title of \"midshipman,\" full of historic\r\nassociation, should be restored.\r\n\r\nEven in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out, for\r\nonly so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency. The officers and\r\nmen alike should be kept as much as possible on blue water, for it is\r\nthere only they can learn their duties as they should be learned. The\r\nbig vessels should be manoeuvred in squadrons containing not merely\r\nbattle ships, but the necessary proportion of cruisers and scouts. The\r\ntorpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers in such manner\r\nas will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the\r\nemergencies of actual warfare.\r\n\r\nEvery detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be\r\nso performed, the officer being kept for his special duty in the\r\nsea service. Above all, gunnery practice should be unceasing. It\r\nis important to have our Navy of adequate size, but it is even more\r\nimportant that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in\r\nthe world. This is possible only with highly drilled crews and officers,\r\nand this in turn imperatively demands continuous and progressive\r\ninstruction in target practice, ship handling, squadron tactics, and\r\ngeneral discipline. Our ships must be assembled in squadrons actively\r\ncruising away from harbors and never long at anchor. The resulting wear\r\nupon engines and hulls must be endured; a battle ship worn out in long\r\ntraining of officers and men is well paid for by the results, while, on\r\nthe other hand, no matter in how excellent condition, it is useless if\r\nthe crew be not expert.\r\n\r\nWe now have seventeen battle ships appropriated for, of which nine are\r\ncompleted and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining\r\neight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at least\r\nthat time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast\r\nconcern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time\r\nthey are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons,\r\nand the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who know how\r\nto fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled under a thorough\r\nand well-planned system of progressive instruction, while the recruiting\r\nmust be carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must be made\r\nto exalt the main function of the officer--the command of men. The\r\nleading graduates of the Naval Academy should be assigned to the\r\ncombatant branches, the line and marines.\r\n\r\nMany of the essentials of success are already recognized by the General\r\nBoard, which, as the central office of a growing staff, is moving\r\nsteadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the\r\nwhole Navy, under the Secretary. This General Board, by fostering the\r\ncreation of a general staff, is providing for the official and then the\r\ngeneral recognition of our altered conditions as a Nation and of the\r\ntrue meaning of a great war fleet, which meaning is, first, the best\r\nmen, and, second, the best ships.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Militia forces are State organizations, and are trained for\r\ncoast service, and in event of war they will constitute the inner line\r\nof defense. They should receive hearty encouragement from the General\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut in addition we should at once provide for a National Naval Reserve,\r\norganized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department,\r\nand subject to the call of the Chief Executive whenever war becomes\r\nimminent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace\r\nestablishment, and offer material to be drawn on at once for manning\r\nour ships in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the\r\nNaval Academy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and crews of\r\ncoast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels, and steam\r\nyachts, together with the coast population about such centers as\r\nlife-saving stations and light-houses.\r\n\r\nThe American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or\r\nelse make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in\r\ninternational affairs, not merely in political, but in commercial,\r\nmatters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting\r\nnational disaster than to be \"opulent, aggressive, and unarmed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to increase our Army beyond its present size at this\r\ntime. But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency.\r\nThe individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this Army,\r\nare, we have good reason to believe, at least as efficient as those of\r\nany other army in the entire world. It is our duty to see that their\r\ntraining is of a kind to insure the highest possible expression of power\r\nto these units when acting in combination.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier\r\ndemand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity of\r\nthe officer and the enlisted man, and to make it far more difficult for\r\nmen to act together with effect. At present the fighting must be done in\r\nextended order, which means that each man must act for himself and at\r\nthe same time act in combination with others with whom he is no longer\r\nin the old-fashioned elbow-to-elbow touch. Under such conditions a few\r\nmen of the highest excellence are worth more than many men without the\r\nspecial skill which is only found as the result of special training\r\napplied to men of exceptional physique and morale. But nowadays the most\r\nvaluable fighting man and the most difficult to perfect is the rifleman\r\nwho is also a skillful and daring rider.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased.\r\nThe American cavalryman, trained to manoeuvre and fight with equal\r\nfacility on foot and on horseback, is the best type of soldier for\r\ngeneral purposes now to be found in the world. The ideal cavalryman of\r\nthe present day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the\r\nbest infantryman, and who is in addition unsurpassed in the care and\r\nmanagement of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback.\r\n\r\nA general staff should be created. As for the present staff and supply\r\ndepartments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men\r\nso detailed returning after a while to their line duties. It is very\r\nundesirable to have the senior grades of the Army composed of men who\r\nhave come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority. A system\r\nshould be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade\r\nof those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade.\r\nJustice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in the Army would\r\nseem to require that in the matter of retirements they be given by law\r\nthe same privileges accorded to their comrades in the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a\r\nmanner that would render it practically impossible to apply political\r\nor social pressure on behalf of any candidate, so that each man may be\r\njudged purely on his own merits. Pressure for the promotion of civil\r\nofficials for political reasons is bad enough, but it is tenfold worse\r\nwhere applied on behalf of officers of the Army or Navy. Every promotion\r\nand every detail under the War Department must be made solely with\r\nregard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of the\r\nman himself. No pressure, political, social, or personal, of any kind,\r\nwill be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question of\r\npromotion or detail; and if there is reason to believe that such\r\npressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned, it\r\nwill be held to militate against him. In our Army we cannot afford to\r\nhave rewards or duties distributed save on the simple ground that those\r\nwho by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them, and that\r\nthose who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to bring the Army to a constantly increasing\r\nstate of efficiency. When on actual service no work save that directly\r\nin the line of such service should be required. The paper work in the\r\nArmy, as in the Navy, should be greatly reduced. What is needed is\r\nproved power of command and capacity to work well in the field. Constant\r\ncare is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and\r\ncommissary departments.\r\n\r\nOur Army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult to\r\ngive the higher officers (as well as the lower officers and the enlisted\r\nmen) a chance to practice manoeuvres in mass and on a comparatively\r\nlarge scale. In time of need no amount of individual excellence would\r\navail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as\r\na coherent whole, under skillful and daring leadership. The Congress\r\nshould provide means whereby it will be possible to have field exercises\r\nby at least a division of regulars, and if possible also a division of\r\nnational guardsmen, once a year. These exercises might take the form of\r\nfield manoeuvres; or, if on the Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic\r\nSeaboard, or in the region of the Great Lakes, the army corps when\r\nassembled could be marched from some inland point to some point on the\r\nwater, there embarked, disembarked after a couple of days' journey at\r\nsome other point, and again marched inland. Only by actual handling and\r\nproviding for men in masses while they are marching, camping, embarking,\r\nand disembarking, will it be possible to train the higher officers to\r\nperform their duties well and smoothly.\r\n\r\nA great debt is owing from the public to the men of the Army and Navy.\r\nThey should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point\r\nof efficiency, so that they may be able to respond instantly to any\r\ndemand made upon them to sustain the interests of the Nation and the\r\nhonor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man is probably on\r\nthe whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other\r\narmy. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return the highest\r\nstandard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It is well worth\r\nwhile for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon\r\nsecond and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to correspond\r\nwith the increased value of the veteran soldier.\r\n\r\nMuch good has already come from the act reorganizing the Army, passed\r\nearly in the present year. The three prime reforms, all of them of\r\nliterally inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four-year\r\ndetails from the line for permanent appointments in the so-called staff\r\ndivisions; second, the establishment of a corps of artillery with a\r\nchief at the head; third, the establishment of a maximum and minimum\r\nlimit for the Army. It would be difficult to overestimate the\r\nimprovement in the efficiency of our Army which these three reforms\r\nare making, and have in part already effected.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially\r\naccomplished. The improved conditions in the Philippines have enabled\r\nthe War Department materially to reduce the military charge upon our\r\nrevenue and to arrange the number of soldiers so as to bring this number\r\nmuch nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law.\r\nThere is, however, need of supplementary legislation. Thorough military\r\neducation must be provided, and in addition to the regulars the\r\nadvantages of this education should be given to the officers of the\r\nNational Guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fit\r\nthemselves for possible military duty. The officers should be given the\r\nchance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this\r\nart. At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn\r\nout men who are good in actual field service; too much stress should not\r\nbe laid on mathematics, nor should proficiency therein be held to\r\nestablish the right of entry to a _corps d'élite_. The typical\r\nAmerican officer of the best kind need not be a good mathematician;\r\nbut he must be able to master himself, to control others, and to show\r\nboldness and fertility of resource in every emergency.\r\n\r\nAction should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising\r\nof volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. The\r\norganization and armament of the National Guard of the several States,\r\nwhich are treated as militia in the appropriations by the Congress,\r\nshould be made identical with those provided for the regular forces. The\r\nobligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should be carefully\r\ndefined, and a system established by law under which the method of\r\nprocedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance.\r\nIt is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of impending war\r\nto do this satisfactorily if the arrangements have not been made\r\nlong beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the first\r\nvolunteer organizations called out the training of those citizens who\r\nhave already had experience under arms, and especially for the selection\r\nin advance of the officers of any force which may be raised; for careful\r\nselection of the kind necessary is impossible after the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nThat the Army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has been\r\nshown during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto\r\nRico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent\r\nimplement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization.\r\n\r\nNo other citizens deserve so well of the Republic as the veterans, the\r\nsurvivors of those who saved the Union. They did the one deed which\r\nif left undone would have meant that all else in our history went for\r\nnothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our\r\nhistory, all our annals would be meaningless, and our great experiment\r\nin popular freedom and self-government a gloomy failure. Moreover, they\r\nnot only left us a united Nation, but they left us also as a heritage\r\nthe memory of the mighty deeds by which the Nation was kept united. We\r\nare now indeed one Nation, one in fact as well as in name; we are united\r\nin our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of national greatness\r\nand unity; and the very completeness of our union enables us all, in\r\nevery part of the country, to glory in the valor shown alike by the sons\r\nof the North and the sons of the South in the times that tried men's\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThe men who in the last three years have done so well in the East\r\nand the West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this\r\nremembrance is not lost. In any serious crisis the United States must\r\nrely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery\r\nwho do not make a permanent profession of the military career; and\r\nwhenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of the Civil War\r\nwill give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those\r\nwhose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle.\r\n\r\nThe merit system of making appointments is in its essence as\r\ndemocratic and American as the common school system itself. It simply\r\nmeans that in clerical and other positions where the duties are entirely\r\nnon-political, all applicants should have a fair field and no favor,\r\neach standing on his merits as he is able to show them by practical\r\ntest. Written competitive examinations offer the only available means in\r\nmany cases for applying this system. In other cases, as where laborers\r\nare employed, a system of registration undoubtedly can be widely\r\nextended. There are, of course, places where the written competitive\r\nexamination cannot be applied, and others where it offers by no means\r\nan ideal solution, but where under existing political conditions it is,\r\nthough an imperfect means, yet the best present means of getting\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nWherever the conditions have permitted the application of the merit\r\nsystem in its fullest and widest sense, the gain to the Government has\r\nbeen immense. The navy-yards and postal service illustrate, probably\r\nbetter than any other branches of the Government, the great gain in\r\neconomy, efficiency, and honesty due to the enforcement of this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified\r\nservice to the District of Columbia, or will at least enable the\r\nPresident thus to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing for the\r\ntemporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that\r\nthey be selected under the Civil Service Law.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have this system obtain at home, but it is even more\r\nimportant to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions. Not\r\nan office should be filled in the Philippines or Puerto Rico with any\r\nregard to the man's partisan affiliations or services, with any regard\r\nto the political, social, or personal influence which he may have at his\r\ncommand; in short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the\r\nman's own character and capacity and the needs of the service.\r\n\r\nThe administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the\r\nsuspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the Army and\r\nNavy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines or\r\nPuerto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which\r\nhe makes that country's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come\r\nunder it. This is all that we should ask, and we cannot afford to be\r\ncontent with less.\r\n\r\nThe merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficient\r\nadministration of the Government; and in the long run the sole\r\njustification of any type of government lies in its proving itself both\r\nhonest and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law\r\npassed in 1856, which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions.\r\nThe interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country\r\nin the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your\r\nattention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have in\r\nrecent years been submitted to the Congress. They are based upon the\r\njust principle that appointments to the service should be made only\r\nafter a practical test of the applicant's fitness, that promotions\r\nshould be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability, and zeal in the\r\nperformance of duty, and that the tenure of office should be unaffected\r\nby partisan considerations.\r\n\r\nThe guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign\r\ncommerce, the protection of American citizens resorting to foreign\r\ncountries in lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the maintenance of\r\nthe dignity of the nation abroad, combine to make it essential that\r\nour consuls should be men of character, knowledge and enterprise. It is\r\ntrue that the service is now, in the main, efficient, but a standard of\r\nexcellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set\r\nforth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress on this subject\r\nare enacted into law.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up\r\nour minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member\r\nof a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine\r\nto break up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and the\r\nindividual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have\r\nalready become citizens of the United States. We should now break up the\r\ntribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands;\r\nthat is, they should be divided into individual holdings. There will be\r\na transition period during which the funds will in many cases have to\r\nbe held in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A stop should\r\nbe put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their\r\nallotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian work like\r\nany other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should\r\nbe made the same as those of the whites.\r\n\r\nIn the schools the education should be elementary and largely\r\nindustrial. The need of higher education among the Indians is very, very\r\nlimited. On the reservations care should be taken to try to suit the\r\nteaching to the needs of the particular Indian. There is no use in\r\nattempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattle\r\nraising, where the Indian should be made a stock grower. The ration\r\nsystem, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, is highly\r\ndetrimental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpetuates pauperism,\r\nand stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to progress. It must\r\ncontinue to a greater or less degree as long as tribes are herded on\r\nreservations and have everything in common. The Indian should be treated\r\nas an individual--like the white man. During the change of treatment\r\ninevitable hardships will occur; every effort should be made to minimize\r\nthese hardships; but we should not because of them hesitate to make the\r\nchange. There should be a continuous reduction in the number of\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important\r\nthan to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation\r\nresulting from the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save our\r\nown Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by international agreement\r\nthis same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess\r\nexclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about.\r\n\r\nI bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for\r\nthe St. Louis Exposition to commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversary\r\nof the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance of\r\nexpansion in our history. It definitely decided that we were to become\r\na great continental republic, by far the foremost power in the Western\r\nHemisphere. It is one of three or four great landmarks in our\r\nhistory--the great turning points in our development. It is eminently\r\nfitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will in\r\ncommemorating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of all the\r\nadjacent region, are entitled to every aid in making the celebration a\r\nnoteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope that foreign nations\r\nwill appreciate the deep interest our country takes in this Exposition,\r\nand our view of its importance from every standpoint, and that they will\r\nparticipate in securing its success. The National Government should be\r\nrepresented by a full and complete set of exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are\r\ncarrying on an Exposition which will continue throughout most of the\r\npresent session of the Congress. I heartily commend this Exposition to\r\nthe good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement that can\r\nbe given it. The managers of the Charleston Exposition have requested\r\nthe Cabinet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits which have\r\nbeen at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have taken\r\nthe responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel that it is\r\ndue to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion\r\nthe management should not be required to pay all these expenses.\r\nI earnestly recommend that the Congress appropriate at once the small\r\nsum necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo has just closed. Both from the\r\nindustrial and the artistic standpoint this Exposition has been in a\r\nhigh degree creditable and useful, not merely to Buffalo but to the\r\nUnited States. The terrible tragedy of the President's assassination\r\ninterfered materially with its being a financial success. The Exposition\r\nwas peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy, because\r\nit represented an effort to bring into closer touch all the peoples of\r\nthe Western Hemisphere, and give them an increasing sense of unity.\r\nSuch an effort was a genuine service to the entire American public.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the highest interests of national science and\r\nlearning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results\r\nof scientific expeditions conducted by the United States have been\r\ncommitted to the Smithsonian Institution. In furtherance of its declared\r\npurpose--for the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge among men\"--the\r\nCongress has from time to time given it other important functions. Such\r\ntrusts have been executed by the Institution with notable fidelity.\r\nThere should be no halt in the work of the Institution, in accordance\r\nwith the plans which its Secretary has presented, for the preservation\r\nof the vanishing races of great North American animals in the National\r\nZoological Park. The urgent needs of the National Museum are recommended\r\nto the favorable consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past fifty\r\nyears is that which has created the modern public library and developed\r\nit into broad and active service. There are now over five thousand\r\npublic libraries in the United States, the product of this period.\r\nIn addition to accumulating material, they are also striving by\r\norganization, by improvement in method, and by co-operation, to give\r\ngreater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more widely\r\nuseful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce\r\nthe cost of its administration.\r\n\r\nIn these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the Federal\r\nlibrary, which, though still the Library of Congress, and so entitled,\r\nis the one national library of the United States. Already the largest\r\nsingle collection of books on the Western Hemisphere, and certain\r\nto increase more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange,\r\nand the operation of the copyright law, this library has a unique\r\nopportunity to render to the libraries of this country--to American\r\nscholarship--service of the highest importance. It is housed in a\r\nbuilding which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for\r\nlibrary uses. Resources are now being provided which will develop the\r\ncollection properly, equip it with the apparatus and service necessary\r\nto its effective use, render its bibliographic work widely available,\r\nand enable it to become, not merely a center of research, but the chief\r\nfactor in great co-operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge and\r\nthe advancement of learning.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement\r\nof science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a\r\npermanent Government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper, and more\r\nsatisfactory work, in the interest not only of our business but of\r\nstatistic, economic, and social science.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that\r\nits revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled\r\nwithin twelve years. Its progressive development compels constantly\r\nincreasing outlay, but in this period of business energy and prosperity\r\nits receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual\r\ndeficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 in 1897 to $3,923,727\r\nin 1901. Among recent postal advances the success of rural free delivery\r\nwherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has made\r\nits benefits so plain, that the demand for its extension is general and\r\nurgent.\r\n\r\nIt is just that the great agricultural population should share in the\r\nimprovement of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation\r\nis 6,009, practically all established within three years, and there are\r\n6,000 applications awaiting action. It is expected that the number in\r\noperation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The\r\nmail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our people\r\nwho have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, and one-third\r\nof all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be\r\ncovered by this kind of service.\r\n\r\nThe full measure of postal progress which might be realized has\r\nlong been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the\r\nGovernment through the intrenched and well-understood abuses which have\r\ngrown up in connection with second-class mail matter. The extent of this\r\nburden appears when it is stated that while the second-class matter\r\nmakes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, it paid for\r\nthe last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postal revenue of\r\n$111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the large\r\nloss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose\r\nof encouraging the dissemination of public information, were limited\r\nto the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by\r\nthe law, no just exception could be taken. That expense would be the\r\nrecognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy deliberately\r\nadopted for a justifiable end. But much of the matter which enjoys the\r\nprivileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law, and has\r\nsecured admission only through an evasion of its requirements or through\r\nlax construction. The proportion of such wrongly included matter is\r\nestimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume of\r\nsecond-class mail. If it be only one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude\r\nof the burden is apparent. The Post-Office Department has now undertaken\r\nto remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter application of\r\nthe law; and it should be sustained in its effort.\r\n\r\nOwing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the Pacific,\r\nwhatever happens in China must be of the keenest national concern to us.\r\n\r\nThe general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out\r\nof the antiforeign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated\r\nin a joint note addressed to China by the representatives of the\r\ninjured powers in December last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese\r\nGovernment. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nseveral powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese\r\nplenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the\r\nmeasures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the joint\r\nnote, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid\r\nbefore the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of\r\nthe United States, Mr. William Woodville Rockhill, to whom high praise\r\nis due for the tact, good judgment, and energy he has displayed in\r\nperforming an exceptionally difficult and delicate task.\r\n\r\nThe agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers\r\nof the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to\r\nbetter future relations between China and the powers. Reparation has\r\nbeen made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising and\r\npunishment has been inflicted on the officials, however high in rank,\r\nrecognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak.\r\nOfficial examinations have been forbidden for a period of five years in\r\nall cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated,\r\nand edicts have been issued making all officials directly responsible\r\nfor the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violence\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nProvisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a\r\nquarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which\r\nthey can if necessary maintain permanent military guards; by dismantling\r\nthe military works between the capital and the sea; and by allowing the\r\ntemporary maintenance of foreign military posts along this line. An\r\nedict has been issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting for two years\r\nthe importation of arms and ammunition into China. China has agreed to\r\npay adequate indemnities to the states, societies, and individuals for\r\nthe losses sustained by them and for the expenses of the military\r\nexpeditions sent by the various powers to protect life and restore\r\norder.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the joint note of December, 1900, China has\r\nagreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take\r\nsuch other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the\r\nforeign powers may decide to be needed.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government has agreed to participate financially in the\r\nwork of bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin,\r\nthe centers of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an\r\ninternational conservancy board, in which the Chinese Government is\r\nlargely represented, has been provided for the improvement of the\r\nShanghai River and the control of its navigation. In the same line of\r\ncommercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has\r\nbeen assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for _ad\r\nvalorem_ duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of\r\nthe United States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain\r\nfree of duty, including flour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin\r\nand bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement.\r\n\r\nDuring these troubles our Government has unswervingly advocated\r\nmoderation, and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment\r\nwhich tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more\r\nbeneficial intercourse between the Empire and the modern world; while\r\nin the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share in\r\nsafeguarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating the\r\nnational interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these paths,\r\ndoing what lies in our power to foster feelings of good will, and\r\nleaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair\r\nintercourse between China and the nations, on a footing of equal rights\r\nand advantages to all. We advocate the \"open door\" with all that it\r\nimplies; not merely the procurement of enlarged commercial opportunities\r\non the coasts, but access to the interior by the waterways with which\r\nChina has been so extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing the people\r\nof China into peaceful and friendly community of trade with all the\r\npeoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to\r\nfruition. In the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity\r\nof treatment, under the conventions, throughout the Empire for our trade\r\nand our citizens with those of all other powers.\r\n\r\nWe view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the\r\nproceedings of the Pan-American Congress, convoked at the invitation\r\nof Mexico, and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of the\r\nUnited States are under the most liberal instructions to co-operate with\r\ntheir colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great family\r\nof American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves\r\nas in their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with the world\r\nat large.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil and\r\nLa Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts\r\nof our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the\r\npart of the claimants, and that in accordance with the acts of the\r\nCongress the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary of State\r\non these awards has been returned to Mexico. A considerable portion of\r\nthe money received from Mexico on these awards had been paid by this\r\nGovernment to the claimants before the decision of the courts was\r\nrendered. My judgment is that the Congress should return to Mexico\r\nan amount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants.\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep\r\nand heartfelt sorrow, to which the Government gave full expression. When\r\nPresident McKinley died, our Nation in turn received from every quarter\r\nof the British Empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere.\r\nThe death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also aroused the\r\ngenuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was cordially\r\nreciprocated by Germany when the President was assassinated. Indeed,\r\nfrom every quarter of the civilized world we received, at the time of\r\nthe President's death, assurances of such grief and regard as to touch\r\nthe hearts of our people. In the midst of our affliction we reverently\r\nthank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind; and\r\nwe firmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken\r\nthese international relations of mutual respect and good will.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, _December 16, 1901_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers, showing that a civil government for Puerto Rico has\r\nbeen organized in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress\r\napproved April 12, 1900, entitled \"An act to provide revenues and a\r\ncivil Government for Puerto Rico, and for other purposes,\" and that the\r\nlegislative assembly of Puerto Rico has enacted and put into operation a\r\nsystem of local taxation to meet the necessities of the government of\r\nPuerto Rico.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, _March 11, 1902_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill, No. 1258 entitled \"An act to\r\nremove the charge of desertion from the naval record of John Glass.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no graver crime than the crime of desertion from the Army\r\nor Navy, especially during war; it is then high treason to the nation,\r\nand is justly punishable by death. No man should be relieved from such a\r\ncrime, especially when nearly forty years have passed since it occurred,\r\nsave on the clearest possible proof of his real innocence. In this case\r\nthe statement made by the affiant before the committee does not in all\r\npoints agree with his statement made to the Secretary of the Navy. In\r\nany event it is incomprehensible to me that he should not have made\r\neffective effort to get back into the Navy.\r\n\r\nHe had served but little more than a month when he deserted, and the\r\nwar lasted for over a year afterwards, yet he made no effort whatever to\r\nget back into the war. Under such circumstances it seems to me that to\r\nremove the charge of desertion from the Navy and give him an honorable\r\ndischarge would be to falsify the records and do an injustice to his\r\ngallant and worthy comrades who fought the war to a finish. The names\r\nof the veterans who fought in the civil war make the honor list of the\r\nRepublic, and I am not willing to put upon it the name of a man unworthy\r\nof the high position.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, _Washington, May 12, 1902_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest calamities in history has fallen upon our\r\nneighboring island of Martinique. The consul of the United States at\r\nGuadeloupe has telegraphed from Fort de France, under date of yesterday,\r\nthat the disaster is complete; that the city of St. Pierre has ceased\r\nto exist; and that the American consul and his family have perished.\r\nHe is informed that 30,000 people have lost their lives and that 50,000\r\nare homeless and hungry; that there is urgent need of all kinds of\r\nprovisions, and that the visit of vessels for the work of supply and\r\nrescue is imperatively required.\r\n\r\nThe Government of France, while expressing their thanks for the marks\r\nof sympathy which have reached them from America, inform us that Fort\r\nde France and the entire island of Martinique are still threatened.\r\nThey therefore request that, for the purpose of rescuing the people\r\nwho are in such deadly peril and threatened with starvation, the\r\nGovernment of the United States may send, as soon as possible, the\r\nmeans of transporting them from the stricken island. The island of St.\r\nVincent and, perhaps, others in that region are also seriously menaced\r\nby the calamity which has taken so appalling a form in Martinique.\r\n\r\nI have directed the departments of the Treasury, of War, and of the Navy\r\nto take such measures for the relief of these stricken people as lies\r\nwithin the Executive discretion, and I earnestly commend this case of\r\nunexampled disaster to the generous consideration of the Congress. For\r\nthis purpose I recommend that an appropriation of $500,000 be made, to\r\nbe immediately available.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, _June 13, 1902_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI deem it important before the adjournment of the present session of\r\nCongress to call attention to the following expressions in the message\r\nwhich in the discharge of the duty imposed upon me by the Constitution\r\nI sent to Congress on the first Tuesday of December last:\r\n\r\n  Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of\r\n  Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of national\r\n  interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application,\r\n  and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed to the\r\n  vital need, of providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff\r\n  duties on Cuban imports into the United States. Cuba has in her\r\n  Constitution affirmed what we desired, that she should stand, in\r\n  international matters, in closer and more friendly relations with us\r\n  than with any other power; and we are bound by every consideration of\r\n  honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of\r\n  her material well being.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis recommendation was merely giving practical effect to President\r\nMcKinley's words, when, in his messages of December 5, 1898, and\r\nDecember 5, 1899, he wrote:\r\n\r\n  It is important that our relations with this people (of Cuba) shall be\r\n  of the most friendly character and our commercial relations close and\r\n  reciprocal. * * * We have accepted a trust, the fulfillment of which\r\n  calls for the sternest integrity of purpose and the exercise of the\r\n  highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past\r\n  must needs be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength\r\n  if its enduring welfare is to be assured. * * * The greatest blessing\r\n  which can come to Cuba is the restoration of her agricultural and\r\n  industrial prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday, June 12, I received, by cable from the American minister in\r\nCuba, a most earnest appeal from President Palma for \"legislative relief\r\nbefore it is too late and (his) country financially ruined.\"\r\n\r\nThe granting of reciprocity with Cuba is a proposition which stands\r\nentirely alone. The reasons for it far outweigh those for granting\r\nreciprocity with any other nation, and are entirely consistent with\r\npreserving intact the protective system under which this country has\r\nthriven so marvelously. The present tariff law was designed to promote\r\nthe adoption of such a reciprocity treaty, and expressly provided for a\r\nreduction not to exceed 20 per cent upon goods coming from a particular\r\ncountry, leaving the tariff rates on the same articles unchanged as\r\nregards all other countries. Objection has been made to the granting of\r\nthe reduction on the ground that the substantial benefit would not go\r\nto the agricultural producer of sugar, but would inure to the American\r\nsugar refiners. In my judgment provision can and should be made which\r\nwill guarantee us against this possibility, without having recourse to\r\na measure of doubtful policy, such as a bounty in the form of a rebate.\r\n\r\nThe question as to which if any of the different schedules of the\r\ntariff ought most properly to be revised does not enter into this matter\r\nin any way or shape. We are concerned with getting a friendly reciprocal\r\narrangement with Cuba. This arrangement applies to all the articles that\r\nCuba grows or produces. It is not in our power to determine what these\r\narticles shall be, and any discussion of the tariff as it affects\r\nspecial schedules or countries other than Cuba is wholly aside from the\r\nsubject matter to which I call your attention.\r\n\r\nSome of our citizens oppose the lowering of the tariff on Cuban products\r\njust as three years ago they opposed the admission of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands lest free trade with them might ruin certain of our interests\r\nhere. In the actual event their fears proved baseless as regards Hawaii,\r\nand their apprehensions as to the damage to any industry of our own\r\nbecause of the proposed measure of reciprocity with Cuba seem to me\r\nequally baseless. In my judgment no American industry will be hurt,\r\nand many American industries will be benefited by the proposed action.\r\nIt is to our advantage as a nation that the growing Cuban market should\r\nbe controlled by American producers.\r\n\r\nThe events following the war with Spain, and the prospective building of\r\nthe Isthmian Canal, render it certain that we must take in the future a\r\nfar greater interest than hitherto in what happens throughout the West\r\nIndies, Central America, and the adjacent coasts and waters. We expect\r\nCuba to treat us on an exceptional footing politically, and we should\r\nput her in the same exceptional position economically. The proposed\r\naction is in line with the course we have pursued as regards all the\r\nislands with which we have been brought into relations of varying\r\nintimacy by the Spanish war. Puerto Rico and Hawaii have been included\r\nwithin our tariff lines, to their great benefit as well as ours,\r\nand without any of the feared detriment to our own industries. The\r\nPhilippines, which stand in a different relation, have been granted\r\nsubstantial tariff concessions.\r\n\r\nCuba is an independent republic, but a republic which has assumed\r\ncertain special obligations as regards her international position in\r\ncompliance with our request. I ask for her certain special economic\r\nconcessions in return; these economic concessions to benefit us as well\r\nas her. There are few brighter pages in American history than the page\r\nwhich tells of our dealings with Cuba during the past four years. On her\r\nbehalf we waged a war of which the mainspring was generous indignation\r\nagainst oppression; and we have kept faith absolutely. It is earnestly\r\nto be hoped that we will complete in the same spirit the record so well\r\nbegun, and show in our dealings with Cuba that steady continuity of\r\npolicy which it is essential for our nation to establish in foreign\r\naffairs if we desire to play well our part as a world power.\r\n\r\nWe are a wealthy and powerful nation; Cuba is a young republic, still\r\nweak, who owes to us her birth, whose whole future, whose very life,\r\nmust depend on our attitude toward her. I ask that we help her as she\r\nstruggles upward along the painful and difficult road of self-governing\r\nindependence. I ask this aid for her, because she is weak, because she\r\nneeds it, because we have already aided her. I ask that open-handed\r\nhelp, of a kind which a self-respecting people can accept, be given to\r\nCuba, for the very reason that we have given her such help in the past.\r\nOur soldiers fought to give her freedom; and for three years our\r\nrepresentatives, civil and military, have toiled unceasingly, facing\r\ndisease of a peculiarly sinister and fatal type, with patient and\r\nuncomplaining fortitude, to teach her how to use aright her new freedom.\r\nNever in history has any alien country been thus administered, with such\r\nhigh integrity of purpose, such wise judgment, and such single-minded\r\ndevotion to the country's interests. Now, I ask that the Cubans be given\r\nall possible chance to use to the best advantage the freedom of which\r\nAmericans have such right to be proud, and for which so many American\r\nlives have been sacrificed.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n_To the People of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA terrible bereavement has befallen our people. The President of the\r\nUnited States has been struck down; a crime not only against the Chief\r\nMagistrate, but against every law-abiding and liberty-loving citizen.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley crowned a life of largest love for his fellow men, of\r\nearnest endeavor for their welfare, by a death of Christian fortitude;\r\nand both the way in which he lived his life and the way in which, in the\r\nsupreme hour of trial, he met his death will remain forever a precious\r\nheritage of our people.\r\n\r\nIt is meet that we as a nation express our abiding love and reverence\r\nfor his life, our deep sorrow for his untimely death.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States\r\nof America, do appoint Thursday next, September 19, the day in which\r\nthe body of the dead President will be laid in its last earthly resting\r\nplace, as a day of mourning and prayer throughout the United States.\r\nI earnestly recommend all the people to assemble on that day in their\r\nrespective places of divine worship, there to bow down in submission to\r\nthe will of Almighty God, and to pay out of full hearts the homage of\r\nlove and reverence to the memory of the great and good President, whose\r\ndeath has so sorely smitten the nation.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the fourteenth day of September, A.D.\r\n1901, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-sixth.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe season is nigh when, according to the time-hallowed custom of our\r\npeople, the President appoints a day as the especial occasion for praise\r\nand thanksgiving to God.\r\n\r\nThis Thanksgiving finds the people still bowed with sorrow for the death\r\nof a great and good President. We mourn President McKinley because we so\r\nloved and honored him; and the manner of his death should awaken in the\r\nbreasts of our people a keen anxiety for the country, and at the same\r\ntime a resolute purpose not to be driven by any calamity from the path\r\nof strong, orderly, popular liberty which as a nation we have thus far\r\nsafely trod.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this great disaster, it is nevertheless true that no\r\npeople on earth have such abundant cause for thanksgiving as we have.\r\nThe past year in particular has been one of peace and plenty. We have\r\nprospered in things material and have been able to work for our own\r\nuplifting in things intellectual and spiritual. Let us remember that,\r\nas much has been given us, much will be expected from us; and that true\r\nhomage comes from the heart as well as from the lips and shows itself in\r\ndeeds. We can best prove our thankfulness to the Almighty by the way in\r\nwhich on this earth and at this time each of us does his duty to his\r\nfellow men.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby designate as a day of general thanksgiving Thursday, the 28th\r\nof this present November, and do recommend that throughout the land the\r\npeople cease from their wonted occupations, and at their several homes\r\nand places of worship reverently thank the Giver of all good for the\r\ncountless blessings of our national life.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this second day of November, A.D. 1901,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-sixth.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, it is provided by section twenty-four of the act of Congress,\r\napproved March third, 1891, entitled \"An act to repeal timber-culture\r\nlaws, and for other purposes,\" \"That the President of the United States\r\nmay, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory\r\nhaving public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands\r\nwholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of\r\ncommercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President\r\nshall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such\r\nreservations and the limits thereof;\"\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, the public lands in the State of Colorado, within the\r\nlimits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it\r\nappears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and\r\nreserving said lands as a public reservation;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States,\r\nby virtue of the power in me vested by section twenty-four of the\r\naforesaid act of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there\r\nare hereby reserved from entry or settlement and set apart as a Public\r\nReservation all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying\r\nand being situate in the State of Colorado and particularly described\r\nas follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nIn township forty-four (44) north, range eleven (11) east, the following\r\nsections: one (1) to three (3), both inclusive, east half of section\r\nfour (4), sections ten (10) to fifteen (15), both inclusive, east half\r\nof section twenty-two (22), sections twenty-three (23) to twenty-six\r\n(26), both inclusive, and section thirty-five (35).\r\n\r\nIn township forty-five (45) north, range eleven (11) east, the following\r\nsections: one (1) to five (5), both inclusive, east half of sections six\r\n(6) and seven (7), sections eight (8) to seventeen (17), both inclusive,\r\nsections twenty (20) to twenty-eight (28), both inclusive, east half of\r\nsection twenty-nine (29) and sections thirty-three (33) to thirty-six\r\n(36), both inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn township forty-three (43) north, range twelve (12) east, the\r\nfollowing sections: one (1) to five (5), both inclusive, and sections\r\neight (8) to twelve (12), both inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn township forty-four (44) north, range twelve (12) east, the following\r\nsections: one (1) to thirty-five (35), both inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn township forty-five (45) north, range twelve (12) east, the following\r\nsections: two (2) to eleven (11), both inclusive, and sections thirteen\r\n(13) to thirty-five (35), both inclusive.\r\n\r\nExcepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which\r\nmay have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or\r\ncovered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States\r\nLand Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant\r\nto law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of\r\nrecord has not expired: _Provided_, that this exception shall not\r\ncontinue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman,\r\nsettler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the\r\nentry, filing or settlement was made.\r\n\r\nWarning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement\r\nupon the tract of land reserved by this proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe reservation hereby established shall be known as The San Isabel\r\nForest Reserve.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this eleventh day of April, A.D. 1902,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-sixth.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  DAVID J.

Chaffee is relieved of his civil duties, and the Philippine\r\nCommission is made the superior authority in the following order:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insurrection against the sovereign authority of the United States\r\nin the Philippine archipelago having ended, and provincial civil\r\ngovernments having been established throughout the entire territory of\r\nthe archipelago not inhabited by Moro tribes, under the instructions of\r\nthe President to the Philippine Commission, dated April 7, 1900, now\r\nratified and confirmed by the act of Congress approved July 1, 1902,\r\nentitled \"An act temporarily to provide for the administration of\r\naffairs of civil government in the Philippine Islands, and for other\r\npurposes,\" the general commanding the division of the Philippines is\r\nhereby relieved from the further performance of the duties of military\r\ngovernor, and the office of military governor in said archipelago is\r\nterminated. The general commanding the Division of the Philippines and\r\nall military officers in authority therein will continue to observe the\r\ndirection contained in the aforesaid instructions of the President that\r\nthe military forces in the division of the Philippines shall be at all\r\ntimes subject, under the orders of the military commander, to the call\r\nof the civil authorities for the maintenance of law and order, and the\r\nenforcement of their authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally the President, through Secretary Root, pronounces the following\r\neulogy upon the United States Army:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n  ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n    _Washington, July 4, 1902_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Order, No. 66_.\r\n\r\nThe following has been received from the War Department:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT, _Washington, July 4, 1902_.\r\n\r\n_To the Army of the United States:_\r\n\r\nThe President, upon this anniversary of national independence, wishes to\r\nexpress to the officers and enlisted men of the United States Army his\r\ndeep appreciation of the service they have rendered to the country in\r\nthe great and difficult undertakings which they have brought to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion during the past year.\r\n\r\nHe thanks the officers and the enlisted men who have been maintaining\r\norder and carrying on the military government in Cuba, because they\r\nhave faithfully given effect to the humane purposes of the American\r\npeople. They have with sincere kindness helped the Cuban people to take\r\nall the successive steps necessary to the establishment of their own\r\nconstitutional government. During the time required for that process\r\nthey have governed Cuba wisely, regarding justice and respecting\r\nindividual liberty; have honestly collected and expended for the\r\nbest interests of the Cuban people the revenues, amounting to over\r\n$60,000,000; have carried out practical and thorough sanitary measures,\r\ngreatly improving the health and lowering the death rate of the island.\r\nBy patient, scientific research they have ascertained the causes of\r\nyellow fever, and by good administration have put an end to that most\r\ndreadful disease which has long destroyed the lives and hindered the\r\ncommercial prosperity of the Cubans. They have expedited justice and\r\nsecured protection for the rights of the innocent, while they have\r\ncleansed the prisons and established sound discipline and healthful\r\nconditions for the punishment of the guilty.\r\n\r\nThey have re-established and renovated and put upon a substantial basis\r\nadequate hospitals and asylums for the care of the unfortunate. They\r\nhave established a general system of free common schools throughout\r\nthe island, in which over two hundred thousand children are in actual\r\nattendance. They have constructed great and necessary public works.\r\nThey have gradually trained the Cubans themselves in all branches of\r\nadministration, so that the new government upon assuming power has begun\r\nits work with an experienced force of Cuban civil service employees\r\ncompetent to execute its orders. They have borne themselves with dignity\r\nand self-control, so that nearly four years of military government\r\nhave passed unmarred by injury or insult to man or woman. They have\r\ntransferred the government of Cuba to the Cuban people amid universal\r\nexpressions of friendship and good will, and have left a record of\r\nordered justice and liberty of rapid improvement in material and moral\r\nconditions and progress in the art of government which reflects great\r\ncredit upon the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President thanks the officers and enlisted men of the army in\r\nthe Philippines, both regulars and volunteers, for the courage and\r\nfortitude, the indomitable spirit and loyal devotion with which they\r\nhave put down and ended the great insurrection which has raged\r\nthroughout the archipelago against the lawful sovereignty and just\r\nauthority of the United States. The task was peculiarly difficult and\r\ntrying. They were required at first to overcome organized resistance\r\nof superior numbers, well equipped with modern arms of precision,\r\nintrenched in an unknown country of mountain defiles, jungles, and\r\nswamps, apparently capable of interminable defense. When this resistance\r\nhad been overcome they were required to crush out a general system of\r\nguerrilla warfare conducted among a people speaking unknown tongues,\r\nfrom whom it was almost impossible to obtain the information necessary\r\nfor successful pursuit or to guard against surprise and ambush.\r\n\r\nThe enemies by whom they were surrounded were regardless of all\r\nobligations of good faith and of all the limitations which humanity has\r\nimposed upon civilized warfare. Bound themselves by the laws of war,\r\nour soldiers were called upon to meet every device of unscrupulous\r\ntreachery and to contemplate without reprisal the infliction of\r\nbarbarous cruelties upon their comrades and friendly natives. They\r\nwere instructed, while punishing armed resistance, to conciliate the\r\nfriendship of the peaceful, yet had to do with a population among whom\r\nit was impossible to distinguish friend from foe, and who in countless\r\ninstances used a false appearance of friendship for ambush and\r\nassassination. They were obliged to deal with problems of communication\r\nand transportation in a country without roads and frequently made\r\nimpassable by torrential rains. They were weakened by tropical heat and\r\ntropical disease. Widely scattered over a great archipelago, extending\r\na thousand miles from north to south, the gravest responsibilities,\r\ninvolving the life or death of their comrades, frequently devolved upon\r\nyoung and inexperienced officers beyond the reach of specific orders or\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nUnder all these adverse circumstances the army of the Philippines has\r\naccomplished its task rapidly and completely. In more than two thousand\r\ncombats, great and small, within three years, it has exhibited unvarying\r\ncourage and resolution. Utilizing the lessons of the Indian wars it has\r\nrelentlessly followed the guerrilla bands to their fastness in mountain\r\nand jungle, and crushed them. It has put an end to the vast system of\r\nintimidation and secret assassination, by which the peaceful natives\r\nwere prevented from taking a genuine part in government under American\r\nauthority. It has captured or forced to surrender substantially all\r\nthe leaders of the insurrection. It has submitted to no discouragement\r\nand halted at no obstacle. Its officers have shown high qualities of\r\ncommand, and its men have shown devotion and discipline. Its splendid\r\nvirile energy has been accompanied by self-control, patience, and\r\nmagnanimity.\r\n\r\nWith surprisingly few individual exceptions its course has been\r\ncharacterized by humanity and kindness to the prisoner and the\r\nnon-combatant. With admirable good temper, sympathy, and loyalty to\r\nAmerican ideals its commanding generals have joined with the civilian\r\nagents of the government in healing the wounds of war and assuring to\r\nthe people of the Philippines the blessings of peace and prosperity.\r\nIndividual liberty, protection of personal rights, civil order, public\r\ninstruction and religious freedom have followed its footsteps. It has\r\nadded honor to the flag, which it defended, and has justified increased\r\nconfidence in the future of the American people, whose soldiers do not\r\nshrink from labor or death, yet love liberty and peace.\r\n\r\nThe President feels that he expresses the sentiments of all the loyal\r\npeople of the United States in doing honor to the whole army which has\r\njoined in the performance and shares in the credit of these honorable\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThis general order will be read aloud at parade in every military post\r\non the 4th day of July, 1902, or on the first day after it shall have\r\nbeen received.\r\n\r\nELIHU ROOT,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nBy command of Lieutenant-General Miles:\r\n\r\nH.C.

It was upon the adoption of this constitution that the\r\n  United States decided to pass over the government to the Island of Cuba\r\n  as soon as the government of that island should agree that it would\r\n  make no treaty with any foreign power which would endanger its\r\n  independence; to contract no debt greater than the current revenue\r\n  would suffice to pay; to grant the United States the right of\r\n  intervention, and also to give it the right to use its naval stations.\r\n  These conditions were accepted by Cuba June 12, 1901, and the President\r\n  and Vice-President of the Republic of Cuba were formally elected\r\n  February 24, 1902.
