But when a long train of abuses and\r\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to\r\nreduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,\r\nto throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future\r\nsecurity.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such\r\nis now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems\r\nof Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a\r\nhistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object\r\nthe establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this,\r\nlet Facts be submitted to a candid world.\r\n\r\n      He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\r\n      for the public good.\r\n      He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and\r\n      pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his\r\n      Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly\r\n      neglected to attend to them.\r\n      He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large\r\n      districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right\r\n      of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them\r\n      and formidable to tyrants only.\r\n      He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\n      uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public\r\n      Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with\r\n      his measures.\r\n      He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with\r\n      manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r\n      He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause\r\n      others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of\r\n      Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their\r\n      exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the\r\n      dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r\n      He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for\r\n      that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\r\n      refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and\r\n      raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\r\n      He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his\r\n      Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\r\n      He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of\r\n      their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n      He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\r\n      Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\r\n      He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the\r\n      Consent of our legislatures.\r\n      He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior\r\n      to the Civil Power.\r\n      He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign\r\n      to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his\r\n      Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\r\n      For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r\n      For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any\r\n      Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\r\n      For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\r\n      For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\r\n      For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\r\n      For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\r\n      For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\r\n      Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and\r\n      enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and\r\n      fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these\r\n      Colonies:\r\n      For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and\r\n      altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\r\n      For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\r\n      invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r\n      He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his\r\n      Protection and waging War against us.\r\n      He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and\r\n      destroyed the lives of our people.\r\n      He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\r\n      to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already\r\n      begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in\r\n      the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a\r\n      civilized nation.\r\n      He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high\r\n      Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners\r\n      of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\r\n      He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\r\n      endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the\r\n      merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an\r\n      undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the\r\nmost humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by\r\nrepeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act\r\nwhich may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.\r\n\r\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren. We have\r\nwarned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend\r\nan unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the\r\ncircumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to\r\ntheir native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the\r\nties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would\r\ninevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have\r\nbeen deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must,\r\ntherefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and\r\nhold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in\r\nGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world\r\nfor the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority\r\nof the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That\r\nthese United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent\r\nStates; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\r\nand that all political connection between them and the State of Great\r\nBritain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and\r\nIndependent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace,\r\ncontract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and\r\nThings which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of\r\nthis Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine\r\nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and\r\nour sacred Honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Button Gwinnett\r\n      Lyman Hall\r\n      George Walton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      William Hooper\r\n      Joseph Hewes\r\n      John Penn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Edward Rutledge\r\n      Thomas Heyward, Jr.\r\n      Thomas Lunch, Jr.\r\n      Arthur Middleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      John Hancock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Samuel Chase\r\n      William Paca\r\n      Thomas Stone\r\n      Charles Carroll of Carrollton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      George Wythe\r\n      Richard Henry Lee\r\n      Thomas Jefferson\r\n      Benjamin Harrison\r\n      Thomas Nelson, Jr.\r\n      Francis Lightfoot Lee\r\n      Carter Braxton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Robert Morris\r\n      Benjamin Rush\r\n      Benjamin Franklin\r\n      John Morton\r\n      George Clymer\r\n      James Smith\r\n      George Taylor\r\n      James Wilson\r\n      George Ross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Caesar Rodney\r\n      George Read\r\n      Thomas McKean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      William Floyd\r\n      Philip Livingston\r\n      Francis Lewis\r\n      Lewis Morris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Richard Stockton\r\n      John Witherspoon\r\n      Francis Hopkinson\r\n      John Hart\r\n      Abraham Clark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Josiah Bartlett\r\n      William Whipple\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Samuel Adams\r\n      John Adams\r\n      Robert Treat Paine\r\n      Elbridge Gerry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Stephen Hopkins\r\n      William Ellery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Roger Sherman\r\n      Samuel Huntington\r\n      William Williams\r\n      Oliver Wolcott\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Matthew Thornton",
