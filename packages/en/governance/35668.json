The war of the rebellion afforded opportunity for the people of the\r\nUnited States to obtain a far clearer conception of the powers and\r\nlimitations of the federal constitution than had previously been possible,\r\nand settled beyond possibility of further debate some of the most\r\nimportant questions which had arisen since its interpretation as an\r\n\"instrument of evidence\" had begun. Yet when General Johnston had\r\nsurrendered his army on April 26, 1865, virtually bringing the war to a\r\nclose, the country found that one great constitutional question, a\r\nquestion of the highest practical importance, still remained unsolved; and\r\nfor several years the best energies of our statesmen were occupied with\r\nits solution. Eleven of the States had for four years been in armed\r\ninsurrection, but now, through superior force, they lay helpless at the\r\nfeet of the Union. Under these circumstances, what was their\r\nconstitutional relation to the federal government?\r\n\r\nPrevious to the passage of the ordinance of secession by the convention of\r\nSouth Carolina in 1860, the nation never had been called upon to determine\r\nthe status of a State which declared its relation to the federal\r\ngovernment severed. Certainly if a State could establish its independence\r\nby war, the question, so far as such State was concerned, would have no\r\nsignificance; but as such a conclusion of the difficulty could not be\r\nconsidered for an instant, the status of the seceded State, both before\r\nand after the cessation of hostilities, immediately became an important\r\nsubject of discussion. The gradual evolution of popular sentiment, from\r\nthe belief that the dignity of a State should not be tampered with, to the\r\nbelief that by an act of secession a State divested itself of all its\r\nrights and privileges as a State, and reverted to the condition of a\r\nTerritory, forms an interesting chapter in the history of the unwritten\r\nconstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n2. When the 37th Congress met on July 4, 1861, in pursuance of Lincoln's\r\nproclamation, the war had not been in progress long enough to show to the\r\ncountry the extreme gravity of the situation and the wideness of the gap\r\nwhich had arisen between the Southern States and the rest of the Union.\r\nThe common belief was that unprincipled agitators, who represented only a\r\nsmall minority of the legal voters in the insurrectionary States, had\r\nobtained temporary control over the governments of these States, and were\r\nwaging a war against the Union, in which they were unsupported by the\r\nmajority; and that the latter would joyfully resume control of their\r\ngovernments as soon as the opportunity should be given them, which it was\r\nconfidently believed would soon happen. That is, the war was to be carried\r\non, not against the States which claimed to have seceded, but against a\r\ncertain element of the Southern population.\r\n\r\nThe extreme solicitude felt by Congress for the proper preservation of the\r\nsovereign privileges of these States is shown by the practical unanimity\r\nwith which a resolution submitted by Mr. Crittenden, on July 22, was\r\ncarried, there being only two dissenting voices.[1] It declared the sense\r\nof the House to be that[2] \"this war is not waged upon our part in any\r\nspirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor\r\npurpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established\r\ninstitutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of\r\nthe Constitution and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality\r\nand rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these\r\nobjects are accomplished the war ought to cease.\" Three days later, Andrew\r\nJohnson, then a Senator from Tennessee, submitted the same resolution in\r\nthe Senate,[3] where it was also carried with practical unanimity,\r\nalthough the discussion indicated a confused idea as to its exact\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nBut few months passed by before this staunch confidence in the rights of\r\nthe States began to be shaken; a feeling of doubt had arisen which had not\r\nas yet resolved itself into a definite change of attitude, yet which was\r\nsufficient to prevent the re-endorsement of Mr. Crittenden's resolution,\r\nintroduced by Mr. Holman, December 4, 1861, and tabled by a vote of 71 to\r\n65.[4]\r\n\r\nA series of resolutions introduced in the Senate by Mr. Davis of Kentucky,\r\non February 13, 1862,[5] while preserving in the main the principles then\r\nin vogue, assumed a somewhat broader tone and expressed very clearly the\r\nbelief of a large element of the thoughtful classes. Affirming the\r\npermanency of the privileges of the people of the United States, it denied\r\nthe criminality of the citizen who does not perform \"his duties of loyalty\r\nand obedience, when the government fails to give him protection and\r\nsecurity,\" and declared that the powers of the nation and State in the\r\nState are simply in suspension during a period of insurrection, and should\r\nbe resumed, unimpaired, when the insurrection ceases. Here also was\r\naffirmed, in unmistakable terms, the inability of the State to secede, and\r\nthe consequent obligation of the United States to preserve in these States\r\nrepublican forms of government. The guilty leaders should be punished, but\r\nthe masses should receive amnesty; and immediately following the important\r\nadmission was made that \"if the people of any State cannot or will not\r\nreconstruct their state government, and return to loyalty and duty,\r\nCongress should provide a government for such State as a territory of the\r\nUnited States, securing to the people thereof their appropriate\r\nconstitutional rights.\"\r\n\r\nHere, in connection with the positive statement that a State cannot\r\nsecede, and the implication that the insurrectionary citizen may be upheld\r\nin his actions, was a clear expression of so-called extra-constitutional\r\npowers in treating incorrigible States as territories. It would be\r\ninteresting to know how these resolutions were viewed by the Senate, but\r\nthey were laid on the table and never taken up for discussion.\r\n\r\n3. During the opening days of the 3d Session of the 37th Congress, the\r\nquestion of the right to interfere with the States as States, was brought\r\nfairly before the House by a series of resolutions in which the policy of\r\nthe extreme wing of the Democratic party was expressed.[6] In them it is\r\ndeclared that \"the Union _as it was_, must be restored and maintained, one\r\nand indivisible.\"[7] When this declaration is examined, with the\r\nPresident's preliminary proclamation of emancipation in mind, the\r\nsignificance of the three italicised words can be seen. The resolutions,\r\nafter quoting the substance of the Crittenden resolution, further declared\r\nthat \"whoever shall pervert or attempt to pervert the same to a war of\r\nconquest or subjugation, or for the overthrowing or interfering with the\r\nrights or established institutions of any of the States, and to abolish\r\nslavery therein, or for the purpose of destroying or impairing the\r\ndignity, equality, or rights of any of the States, will be guilty of a\r\nflagrant breach of public faith and of a high crime against the\r\nConstitution and the Union.\" The same guilt was declared to attach to all\r\nwho should \"propose by federal authority, to extinguish any of the States\r\nof the Union, or to declare any of them extinguished, and to establish\r\nterritorial governments within the same.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions, which were an open attack upon the presidential policy,\r\nwere tabled by a vote of 79 to 50, a party vote. This fact is of\r\nsignificance as an evidence of the growing feeling in the House, that the\r\nsovereign rights of the States might be too highly considered, and that\r\ndecided discipline of some kind might be found a measure of necessity. It\r\nbegan to be doubted whether in some of these States there could be found a\r\nsufficient number of loyal citizens to carry on the government without\r\nmodifications of the old constitution and laws. At the same time the small\r\nmajority by which the resolutions were tabled shows that the old idea\r\nstill exercised a powerful influence in the House.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1863, resolutions were introduced by Mr. Finck,[8] and\r\nothers two days later by Mr. Rollins,[9] which were very similar to the\r\nCrittenden resolution, and were introduced merely as expressions of the\r\nDemocratic policy, since the Republican majority was too pronounced to\r\npermit their adoption.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the war, the policy of the Democratic party in the\r\nNorth was to bring about some agreement between the North and the South,\r\nby compromises and concessions, and should the issue finally be determined\r\nin favor of the Union even by dint of superior strength, to restore the\r\nSouthern States to their former condition. In short, the theory held\r\nalmost unanimously by Congress at the opening of the 37th Congress, was\r\nretained as the Democratic theory,[10] while the Republicans gradually\r\nmodified their opinions, and with the progress of events developed a\r\ntheory different from both the Democratic and the presidential theory.\r\n\r\nEven after the proclamation of emancipation had come to be recognized as\r\none of the natural results of the war, the policy of the Democratic party\r\nwas unchanged except as necessarily modified by emancipation, and in the\r\nHouse, on February 8, 1864, Jacob B. Blair submitted resolutions[11] in\r\nwhich it was stated that \"every State which has ever been, is still a\r\nState in the Union, and that when this rebellion shall have been put down,\r\neach of the so-called seceding States will have the same rights,\r\nprivileges, and immunities under the Constitution as any one of the loyal\r\nStates, except so far as the holding of African slaves in bondage is\r\naffected by the President's proclamation.\" These resolutions also\r\nrepudiated \"the doctrine advanced by some, that the so-called seceding\r\nStates have ceased to be States of and in the Union, and have become\r\nterritories thereof, or stand in the relation of foreign powers at war\r\ntherewith.\"\r\n\r\nBut besides political declarations, the Democratic theory found other ways\r\nof expression in Congress. From the very commencement of the war, many of\r\nthe leaders of the party were confident that hostilities could be brought\r\nto an end and peaceful relations restored by a convention of States, and\r\nseveral attempts were made to induce Congress to consider favorably some\r\nsuch plan.[12] As early as July 15, 1861, only eleven days after the\r\nconvening of the extra session of Congress, Benjamin Wood introduced a\r\nresolution in the House,[13] which recommended that the governors of the\r\nseveral States \"convene their legislatures for the purpose of calling an\r\nelection to select two delegates from each Congressional district, to meet\r\nin general convention at Louisville, in Kentucky, on the first Monday in\r\nSeptember next; the purpose of the said convention to be to devise\r\nmeasures for the restoration of peace to our country.\"\r\n\r\nAgain at the opening of the second session on December 4, 1861, joint\r\nresolutions were introduced by Mr. Saulsbury, in the Senate,[14] to\r\nappoint Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Roger B. Taney, Edward Everett,\r\nGeo. M. Dallas, Thomas Ewing, Horace Binney, Reverdy Johnson, John J.\r\nCrittenden, George E. Pugh, and R. W. Thompson, \"commissioners on the part\r\nof Congress, to confer with a like number of commissioners to be appointed\r\nby the States\" in rebellion, \"for the preservation of the Union and the\r\nmaintenance of the Constitution.\" The resolutions also provided that when\r\nthe several States should have appointed their commissioners, hostilities\r\nshould cease, \"and not be renewed unless said commission shall be unable\r\nto agree,\" or \"agreement shall be rejected either by Congress or by the\r\naforesaid States.\"\r\n\r\nOne year later, December 2, 1862, a third attempt[15] was made by Mr.\r\nDavis, who submitted a joint resolution in the Senate (S. 104), proposing\r\na convention from all the States to devise means for the reconstruction of\r\nthe Union, and on May 30, 1864, Mr. Lazear submitted in the House,\r\nresolutions which were to authorize the President to \"adopt or agree upon\r\nsome plan upon which the decision of the great body of the people north\r\nand south may be secured upon the question of calling a convention\r\ncomposed of delegates from all the States, to which shall be referred the\r\nsettlement of all questions now dividing the southern States from the rest\r\nof the Union, with a view to the restoration of the several States to the\r\nplaces they were intended to occupy in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of the war, after hope of success had begun to die\r\nout, some of the Southern States looked very favorably upon the plan; but\r\nnothing approximating such a convention resulted.[16]\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of his term of office, President Lincoln held the then\r\nprevailing belief in the supremacy of the States in all matters not\r\ndirectly under federal control, and as a matter of course believed that at\r\nthe cessation of hostilities each State should immediately resume its old\r\nrelations to the government, its local matters untouched by the central\r\nadministration.[17] But the ability of Lincoln to modify his own beliefs\r\non any subject as his experience widened was never better manifested than\r\non this very question, and had he lived to control the administration\r\nthrough the period of reconstruction, it is not unreasonable to suppose\r\nthat his attitude would have undergone still greater change. As the\r\nmagnitude of the struggle became more apparent, he began to deliberate\r\nupon the advisability of striking at the root of the evil, despite the\r\nblow it struck at state liberty, and the two proclamations of September\r\n22, 1862, and January 1, 1863,[18] mark the basis of the executive plan of\r\nreconstruction. The Pierpoint government of Virginia had been recognized\r\nin 1861, but its recognition was in harmony with the early attitude of\r\nCongress towards the States, and involved no questions which could show a\r\ndistinct executive policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, after the capture of New Orleans, a military governor of\r\nLouisiana was appointed, many persons in the vicinity of New Orleans were\r\nenrolled as citizens of the United States, and two districts elected\r\nrepresentatives to Congress, under the provisions of the old state\r\nconstitution.[19] In this case there was a distinct development of the\r\nexecutive policy. Here was a military governor, appointed by the President\r\nand so an instrument of the Executive, interfering with the civil\r\ngovernment of the State, controlling elections, deciding what districts\r\nwere entitled to elections, and fixing the date of election. This was very\r\ndifferent from simple restoration, with its theory that the national\r\ngovernment must in no way interfere with the State governments. And when\r\nthe two members elect, Messrs. Flanders and Hahn, presented themselves for\r\nadmission into the House of Representatives, the Democrats, consistently\r\nwith their belief in restoration, which up to that time had met with no\r\nserious opposition, opposed their admission strongly. In the discussion\r\nwhich arose, Mr. Voorhees well expressed the difference in theory between\r\nthe Democratic view and that which was ultimately to be adopted. The\r\nproblem was stated by him as follows:[20] \"If the Southern Confederacy is\r\na foreign power, an independent nationality to-day, and you have conquered\r\nback the territory of Louisiana, you may then substitute a new system of\r\nlaws in the place of the laws of that State. You may then supplant her\r\ncivil institutions by institutions made anew for her by the proper\r\nauthority of this _Government_--not by the executive, but by the\r\n_legislative_ branch of the Government, assisted by the Executive simply\r\nto the extent of signing his name to the bills of legislation.\" \"But if\r\nthe theory we have been proceeding upon here, that this Union is unbroken;\r\nthat no States have sundered the bonds that bind us together; that no\r\nsuccessful disunion has yet taken place--if that theory is still to\r\nprevail in these halls, then this can not be done. You are as much bound\r\nto uphold the laws of Louisiana in all their extent and in all their\r\nparts, as you are to uphold the laws of Pennsylvania or New York, or any\r\nother State whose civil policy has not been disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe strong appeal to remain true to the theory first maintained by\r\nCongress, did not succeed in shutting the Louisianians out, and for one\r\nmonth, February to March, 1863, they were recognized as members. The later\r\nrefusal to admit members from insurrectionary States was due, not to a\r\nsupposed inconsistency with restoration proper, but to dislike of the\r\npresidential policy.\r\n\r\nAnd now with emancipation still another element entered into the question,\r\nand in the future reconstruction, Congress was of necessity forced to\r\nfollow to a certain extent a new path laid out by the President. A State\r\nafter January, 1863, in order to resume its former relations, must at\r\nleast make one change in its institutions, and perfect restoration could\r\nno longer be considered. True, a large minority opposed the emancipation\r\npolicy of the President, and their discontent took expression in\r\nresolutions such as Mr. Conway introduced into the House on December 15,\r\n1862, in which he says that \"the seceded States can only be put down, if\r\nat all, by being regarded as out of constitutional relations with the\r\nUnion,\" implying, of course, the inability of the President to extinguish\r\ntheir local institutions. But such resolutions were never considered,\r\nwhile resolutions endorsing the policy of the President were agreed\r\nto.[21]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the development of the President's policy was the\r\nformation of a definite program, which States wishing to be restored to\r\nequal rights with the loyal States should follow. This plan of\r\nreconstruction, called by him at a later period the \"Louisiana plan,\" was\r\nofficially announced by the proclamation of December 8, 1863, and the\r\nannual message to Congress of the same date defended the stand taken.[22]\r\nThis proclamation granted amnesty to all citizens (excepting certain\r\nspecified classes[23]) who would take an oath to support the\r\nConstitution, as well as all acts of Congress and proclamations of the\r\nPresident relating to slaves; and declared that whenever one-tenth of the\r\nvoters of any insurrectionary State should take the oath, and re-establish\r\ntheir state government, \"which shall be republican, and in no wise\r\ncontravening said oath,\" that government would be recognized as the true\r\ngovernment of the State and would receive the protection guaranteed to the\r\nStates. But all questions concerning admission to Congress would, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Constitution, rest entirely with the\r\nrespective houses of Congress. The questions of negro suffrage and federal\r\nsupervision of the freedmen were not touched, and no provision was made to\r\nensure good faith in reconstruction, beyond the mere oath exacted, and the\r\ngeneral oversight of the President.\r\n\r\n5. Under the provisions of the proclamation, three States, Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, and Tennessee,[24] set up new governments, which were recognized\r\nby the President as true governments.[25] Congress, however, was by no\r\nmeans satisfied with this lenient way of treating the humbled States. The\r\nfeeling that the executive was encroaching upon the legislative power\r\nadded strength to the discontent. Many thought that if the presidential\r\npolicy, without modification, were carried out, the reconstructed States\r\nwould speedily revert to the control of the very element against whom the\r\nwar had been waged. The House, by a strict party vote,[26] authorized the\r\nappointment of a select committee of nine, to consider that portion of\r\nthe President's message relating to reconstruction, with authority to\r\nreport by bill or otherwise. Henry Winter Davis was appointed chairman.\r\nResolutions were submitted by Mr. Williams on March 14, 1864, which were\r\nbacked by a sentiment in Congress that was of great significance. Congress\r\nbegan to feel its way towards a distinctive policy, which had heretofore\r\nbeen supported by only a few, who were considered as holding extremely\r\nwild and untenable views. These resolutions stated that although the local\r\nlaws were subverted, and the functions of the civil authorities suspended\r\nin the States under armed occupation, \"as soon as the rebellion is\r\nsuppressed in any of the revolting States,\" the President should\r\ncommunicate the fact to _Congress_, \"in order that it may take the proper\r\nmeasures for the reorganization of the civil governments and the\r\nre-establishment of the civil functionaries therein, and prescribe such\r\nterms as it may deem wise and proper and consistent with the public safety\r\nfor the readmission of those districts as States of this Union.\" The\r\nexclusive right of the legislative power \"to say upon what terms those\r\nterritories shall be allowed to return to the Union,\" was also asserted.\r\n\r\nThe issue between Congress and the President took more definite form\r\nthrough the Davis-Wade bill of 1864.[27] This bill had been drafted during\r\nthe latter part of 1863 by the select committee of nine, but it did not\r\ncome before the House for consideration till March 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe objections of those who supported this bill to the Presidential plan,\r\nare clearly expressed in the speech of H. Winter Davis, in support of his\r\nmeasure. He says[28] that it (the Presidential plan), \"proposed no\r\nguardianship of the United States over the reorganization of the\r\ngovernments, no law to prescribe who shall vote, no civil functionaries to\r\nsee that the law is faithfully executed, no supervising authority to\r\ncontrol and judge of the elections. But if, in any manner, by the\r\ntoleration of martial law lately proclaimed the fundamental law, under the\r\ndictation of any military authority, or under the prescriptions of a\r\nprovost marshal, something in the form of a government shall be presented,\r\nrepresented to rest on the votes of one-tenth of the population, the\r\nPresident will recognize that, provided it does not _contravene_ the\r\nproclamation of freedom and the laws of Congress; and to secure that, an\r\noath is exacted.\" This government \"may be recognized by the military power\r\nand may not be recognized by the civil power, so that it would have a\r\ndoubtful existence, half civil and half military, neither a temporary\r\ngovernment by law of Congress, nor a state government, something as\r\nunknown to the Constitution as the rebel government that refuses to\r\nrecognize it.\"\r\n\r\nIn place of this method of organization, which Mr. Davis justly thought so\r\nwretchedly loose, he proposed that the President should appoint\r\nprovisional governors over these States, whose first duty should be to\r\nenroll the white citizens, through duly appointed United States marshals.\r\nThen when a majority of these citizens should have taken the oath of\r\nallegiance, they should be permitted to hold a State convention for the\r\npurpose of forming a constitution under which the government might be\r\nre-established. But all Confederate office-holders and those voluntarily\r\nbearing arms against the United States were to be ineligible as delegates\r\nto the convention. The bill further provided that the constitution should\r\n\"repudiate the rebel debt, abolish slavery, and prohibit the higher\r\nmilitary and civil officers from voting for or serving as governors or\r\nmembers of the legislature.\" When these conditions should have been\r\nfulfilled, and the assent of Congress to the recognition of the new\r\ngovernment obtained, the President should be notified, and should then\r\nofficially recognize the government by proclamation, after which senators\r\nand representatives would be admitted to Congress.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the speech mentioned above, Mr. Davis claimed that \"the bill challenges\r\nthe support of all who consider slavery the cause of the rebellion, and\r\nthat in it the embers of rebellion will always smoulder; of those who\r\nthink that freedom and permanent peace are inseparable, and who are\r\ndetermined, so far as their constitutional authority will allow them, to\r\nsecure these fruits by adequate legislation.\"\r\n\r\nBut in this plan there was no attempt to introduce negro suffrage. The\r\nonly question of importance seemed to be: \"How can we ensure the\r\nsubservience of these States to the federal constitution?\" The supporters\r\nof the Davis plan insisted that \"the rebel States must be governed by\r\nCongress till they submit and form a state government under the\r\nConstitution\"; otherwise \"Congress must recognize state governments which\r\ndo not recognize either Congress or the Constitution of the United States;\r\nor there must be an entire absence of all government in the rebel States;\r\nand that is anarchy.\" It was absurd, the argument continued, to recognize\r\na government which did not recognize the Constitution; and \"to accept the\r\nalternative of anarchy as the constitutional condition of a State is to\r\nassert the failure of the Constitution and the end of republican\r\ngovernment. Until, therefore, Congress recognize a state government,\r\norganized under its auspices, there is no government in the rebel States\r\nexcept the authority of Congress.\" From this it logically followed that in\r\nthe absence of all State government it was the duty of Congress to\r\n\"administer civil government until the people shall, under its guidance,\r\nsubmit to the Constitution of the United States,\" and reorganize\r\ngovernment under whatever conditions Congress might require.\r\n\r\nThese arguments appealed to sentiments which were becoming very popular in\r\nCongress. The theory that a State by seceding ceased to exist as a State\r\nwas gradually gaining ground, and the Davis plan, by which the central\r\ngovernment was to control the State as a territory, though for so limited\r\na time, rapidly gained supporters.\r\n\r\nMr. Fernando Beaman, of Michigan, who also considered that the seceded\r\nStates had ceased to exist, said in an extended speech favoring the\r\nadoption of this bill:[30] \"As a people without government or organization\r\nare in a state of anarchy, their efforts to establish law and order must\r\nbe more or less impeded by caprice, by divided counsels, and by the want\r\nof forms, regulations, and methods. The passage of this bill is the\r\nestablishment of incipient civil government, and provides at once rules,\r\nregulations and system, with the proper officials to carry them into\r\nexecution.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the bill was avowedly drawn up to provide what the presidential\r\nplan failed to provide, a method of reconstruction so thorough that those\r\nelements which had produced the discord could no longer influence the\r\nstate governments, it itself furnished no means to prevent any of these\r\nStates from so amending their constitutions, after their senators and\r\nrepresentatives had received recognition, that the very conditions of\r\nreadmittance might be rendered nugatory.\r\n\r\nBut the bill seemed to the majority in Congress to offer a more practical\r\nplan than any yet proposed, and it passed the House May 4, by a vote of 73\r\nto 59; the Senate, two months later, adopted it by a majority of four. But\r\nit failed to become a law by the adjournment of Congress before it\r\nreceived the President's signature.[31]\r\n\r\nThe President, in justification of his neglect to sign the bill, issued a\r\nproclamation on July 8.[32] This stated that while he was unprepared \"to\r\nbe inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration,\" and also\r\n\"unprepared to declare that the free State constitutions and governments\r\nalready adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana, shall be set\r\naside and held for naught, thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal\r\ncitizens who have set up the same as to further effort,\" nevertheless he\r\nwas \"fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the\r\nbill, as one very proper plan for the loyal people of any State choosing\r\nto adopt it,\" and that in such case when the people \"shall have\r\nsufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution and laws of\r\nthe United States,\" military governors would be appointed, \"with\r\ndirections to proceed according to the bill.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt to modify the presidential plan virtually ended for the time\r\nthe efforts of Congress towards the development of a distinctive theory,\r\nand the war thus closed with no well defined plan in operation, except\r\nthat of President Lincoln, which was not well sustained by Congress. Only\r\none thing seemed to be definitely decided. That was, that the seceded\r\nStates, in whatever light they might be considered, were incapacitated\r\nfrom participating in presidential elections. A joint resolution to this\r\neffect was passed in 1865,[33] and in accordance with its provisions the\r\nelectoral vote of Louisiana was ruled out.\r\n\r\nTwo men in the Republican party wielded the chief power in influencing\r\nthat party to adopt the theory of reconstruction which was finally to\r\nprevail as the congressional theory.[34] One was Thaddeus Stevens of\r\nPennsylvania, and the other Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts. The latter\r\nwas a recognized leader of the Senate, and his views concerning the mutual\r\nrelations of the States in rebellion and the federal government were\r\nclearly expressed in a series of resolutions which he submitted February\r\n11, 1862. These resolutions, although never brought forward for\r\nconsideration, were printed, and coming from so influential a man had\r\nconsiderable influence in shaping the general attitude of Congress towards\r\nthe question, and affected to some extent its future policy. They[35] were\r\nnine in number, with a well-worded preamble which put forward as a premise\r\nthat \"the extensive territory, thus usurped by these pretended\r\ngovernments, and organized into a hostile confederacy, belongs to the\r\nUnited States, as an inseparable part thereof, under the sanction of the\r\nConstitution, to be held in trust for the inhabitants in the present and\r\nfuture generations, * * * The Constitution, which is the supreme law of\r\nthe land, cannot be displaced in its rightful operation within this\r\nterritory, but must ever continue the supreme law thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe first resolution declares that a vote of secession is void as against\r\nthe Constitution, \"and when sustained by force it becomes a practical\r\n_abdication_ by the State of all rights under the Constitution, while the\r\ntreason which it involves still further works an instant _forfeiture_ of\r\nall those functions and powers essential to the continued existence of the\r\nState as a body politic, so that from that time forward, the territory\r\nfalls under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress as other territory, and\r\nthe State being, according to the language of the law, _felo de se_,\r\nceases to exist.\"\r\n\r\nThe second resolution denies the constitutional existence of the\r\nConfederate States. The third and fourth declare that the termination of a\r\nState terminates its peculiar local institutions, therefore slavery ceases\r\nto exist; and the fifth, sixth and seventh declare it necessary not to\r\nrecognize or tolerate slavery. The eighth declares the obligation of the\r\nUnited States to protect all inhabitants, \"without distinction of color or\r\nclass.\" The ninth declares that Congress, in pursuance of the duties cast\r\nupon it by the total extinction of the States and by the constitutional\r\nobligation that the \"United States shall guarantee to every State in this\r\nUnion a republican form of government,\"[36] \"will assume complete\r\njurisdiction of such vacated territory where such unconstitutional and\r\nillegal things have been attempted, and will proceed to establish therein\r\nrepublican forms of government under the Constitution; and in execution of\r\nthis trust will provide carefully for the protection of all the\r\ninhabitants thereof, for the security of families, the organization of\r\nlabor, the encouragement of industry, and the welfare of society, and will\r\nin every way discharge the duties of a just, merciful, and paternal\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens, although recognized as one of the foremost men of the\r\nRepublican party, advocated from the very commencement of hostilities\r\nviews of so radical a nature, that he was looked upon by many as a\r\nfanatic. His influence accordingly worked in a different way from\r\nSumner's. At no time did he consolidate his views into a series of\r\nresolutions, but upon every occasion where the subject could be touched\r\nupon, no matter how indirectly the topic might refer to it, he would state\r\nhis theory of the relation of the seceded States to the Union.\r\nPersistently and consistently he advocated it; and he took pleasure in\r\nconsidering himself as in advance of his party, a prophet, pointing out\r\nthe only right road, confident that sooner or later his party would see\r\nthe wisdom of his policy and adopt it. Throughout those tempestuous years,\r\nhis undaunted faith in the infallibility of his plan served to keep it\r\nconstantly in mind, and attracted to him a constantly increasing number of\r\nfollowers, until at the beginning of the 39th Congress he obtained\r\ncontrol, and became the recognized leader of his party in all matters\r\nrelating to the Southern States. Though the plan of reconstruction as\r\nfinally adopted contained many modifications, it was to a great extent the\r\nlogical outgrowth of the Stevens theory. His whole theory rested upon the\r\nsimple premise that wherever there is resistance to the Constitution, and\r\nthat resistance cannot be overthrown without appeal to violent methods,\r\nthere the Constitution is theoretically as well as practically suspended.\r\nAs long as such resistance continues, the Constitution remains suspended,\r\nand only the law-making and war-making power is able to determine when\r\nresistance has ceased. Consequently the federal government would have the\r\nundisputed right to treat the South as a conquered territory until there\r\nshould be no question as to the safety of granting greater privileges.\r\nThose States had ceased to be States, consequently the \"guarantee clause\"\r\nhad no application. Congress had unrestricted power over them, as simple\r\nterritories of the federal government. On May 2, 1864, during the\r\ndiscussion of the bill to guarantee republican forms of government to the\r\nrebellious States, he declared that the rebellious States \"were entitled\r\nto no rights under the Constitution and laws, which as to them were\r\nabrogated; that they could invoke the aid of neither in their behalf; that\r\nthey could claim to be treated during the war as belligerents according to\r\nthe laws of war and the law of nations; that they could claim no other\r\nrights than a foreign nation with whom we might be at war; and that they\r\nwere subject to all the liabilities of such foreign belligerent,\" and that\r\n\"the property of the morally and politically guilty should be taken for\r\npublic use.\"[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON'S THEORY: THE EXPERIMENT, AND ITS RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We have briefly reviewed the theories that obtained greater or less\r\nconsideration during the progress of the war, and have seen that plan had\r\nbeen agreed upon by which the Southern States might resume their normal\r\nrelations with the rest of the Union. Two or three States had, it is true,\r\nbeen nominally reconstructed under the provisions of the proclamation of\r\nDecember 8, 1863, but their good faith was strongly suspected, and their\r\nrepresentatives were not able to secure recognition in Congress. The high\r\npersonal esteem in which President Lincoln was held had prevented general\r\ndemonstrations against his policy, but there was a wide-spread suspicion\r\nthat he was inclined to deal too leniently with a people who had brought\r\nso much expense and misery upon the nation. The indignation of the North\r\nhad increased with the progress of the war, and the belief that the South\r\ncould be held in check only by the most stringent regulations and\r\nrequirements was held by many.\r\n\r\n2. So long as armed rebellion existed the question of reconstruction was a\r\nminor one, the attention of all being chiefly directed to the problem:\r\n\"How can this rebellion be crushed out, and the South made thoroughly to\r\nrealize that resistance is useless?\" But when Andrew Johnson took the oath\r\nof office the rebellion was virtually a thing of the past, and the giant\r\nproblem for the nation to solve during his administration was: \"How shall\r\nwe treat these conquered States lying helpless, awaiting whatever fate\r\nmay be allotted them?\" No other issue of importance served to offset it.\r\nThe whole nation was debating the question, and all were waiting to see in\r\nwhat way the Executive would grapple with it.[38]\r\n\r\n3. Those who feared that Lincoln had lacked sufficient firmness and had\r\nbeen too tender hearted, believed that in Johnson the nation had as its\r\nExecutive a man with correct convictions and a strength of character which\r\nensured both the proper treatment of the South and the stability of the\r\nUnion. Johnson had an excellent record as military governor of Tennessee,\r\nwhere his fearlessness and vigorous administration had given him a\r\nreputation which brought to him the nomination of vice-president. From his\r\nseverity to the rebels while governor of Tennessee it was reasoned that he\r\nwould still remain severe and unyielding in his treatment of them as\r\nPresident of the United States. He himself was always fond of alluding to\r\nhis past record as indicating his future course. Thus, only six days after\r\nhe took the oath of office, he said while addressing a delegation of\r\ncitizens of Indiana:[39] \"In reference to what my administration will be,\r\nwhile I occupy my present position, I must refer you to the past. You may\r\nlook back to it as evidence of what my course will be; * * * mine has been\r\nbut one straightforward and unswerving course, and I see no reason now why\r\nI should depart from it. * * * My past is a better foreshadowing of my\r\nfuture course than any other statement on paper that might be made.\"\r\nMoreover, an examination of the speeches made by him during the war shows\r\nthe grounds on which the people were justified in expecting a severe\r\npolicy. An extract from an address delivered in Nashville, June 9, 1864,\r\nshows his views at that time as to who should carry on the work of\r\nreconstruction.[40] \"In calling a convention to restore the State, who\r\nshall restore and re-establish it? Shall the man who gave his influence\r\nand his means to destroy the government * * * participate in the great\r\nwork of reorganization? * * * Traitors should take a back seat in the work\r\nof restoration. If there be but five thousand men in Tennessee loyal to\r\nthe Constitution, loyal to freedom, loyal to justice, these true and\r\nfaithful men should control the work of reorganization and reformation\r\nabsolutely.\" Later on in the same speech he said, referring to the traitor\r\n\"born and reared among us:\" \"My judgment is that he should be subjected to\r\na severe ordeal before he is restored to citizenship. A fellow who takes\r\nthe oath merely to save his property, and denies the validity of the oath,\r\nis a perjured man, and not to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n4. Emphatic statements such as these, often repeated, insisting that the\r\ngovernment of the States must be carefully kept in the hands of those\r\nwhose loyalty was above suspicion, and advocating severe ordeals for those\r\nconsidered traitors, warranted the people of the nation in their faith in\r\nhis extreme devotion to a strong Union. Yet soon after his inauguration a\r\nchange in his attitude could be noticed. In his numerous speeches and\r\ninterviews he shifts his ground, very gradually at first, but soon meeting\r\nthe issue squarely, pledging himself to a policy which he faithfully\r\ncarried into execution, and which the candid student must recognize as\r\nbeing thoroughly believed in by the President. Clemency towards the\r\nmasses, but severity towards the leaders of the rebellion, was his\r\nattitude in his speech of April 21, above alluded to. He expressed his\r\nviews as follows:[41] \"It is not promulgating anything I have not\r\nheretofore said, to say that traitors must be made odious, that treason\r\nmust be made odious, that traitors must be punished and impoverished.\r\nThey must not only be punished, but their social power must be destroyed.\r\nIf not, they will still maintain an ascendency, and may again become\r\nnumerous and powerful; for, in the words of a former senator of the United\r\nStates, 'when traitors become numerous enough, treason becomes\r\nrespectable.' And I say that, after making treason odious, every Union man\r\nand the Government should be remunerated out of the pockets of those who\r\nhave inflicted this great suffering upon the country. But do not\r\nunderstand me as saying this in a spirit of anger, for, if I understand my\r\nown heart, the reverse is the case; and while I say that the penalties of\r\nthe law, in a stern and inflexible manner, should be executed upon\r\nconscious, intelligent and influential traitors--the leaders, who have\r\ndeceived thousands upon thousands of laboring men who have been drawn into\r\nthis rebellion--and while I say, as to the leaders, punishment, I also say\r\nleniency, conciliation and amnesty to the thousands whom they have misled\r\nand deceived.\"\r\n\r\nAs Johnson said, he promulgated nothing new in this statement of his\r\nbeliefs regarding the treatment of the South, save possibly a more\r\ndefinite affirmation of clemency to the masses. In the Nashville speech of\r\nJune 9, 1864, he had still more emphatically urged extreme measures\r\ntowards the leaders.[42] \"Treason must be made odious, and traitors must\r\nbe punished and impoverished. Their great plantations must be seized and\r\ndivided into small farms, and sold to honest, industrious men. The day for\r\nprotecting the lands and negroes of these authors of the rebellion is\r\npast.\" Again on April 24, 1865, in an interview with a number of Virginia\r\nrefugees, he reiterated the necessity of severity. In this case, perhaps\r\nowing to the nature of the interview, and the character of those to whom\r\nhe was speaking, he makes no distinction between the leaders and their\r\nfollowers, his definition of treason apparently including all soldiers and\r\ntheir abettors. In it he says:[43] \"It is time that our people were taught\r\nthat treason is a crime, not a mere political difference, not a mere\r\ncontest between two parties, in which one succeeded and the other simply\r\nfailed. They must know it is treason; for if they had succeeded, the life\r\nof the nation would have been reft from it, the Union would have been\r\ndestroyed. Surely the Constitution sufficiently defines treason. It\r\nconsists in levying war against the United States, and in giving their\r\nenemies aid and comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThe great liberality with which, beginning with the following month, the\r\nPresident used the pardoning power, and the extreme leniency with which\r\nall the leaders were treated, were in striking contrast with these\r\nsentiments. A situation was presented for Johnson to meet as President,\r\nwhich necessitated modifications of views held by him as governor. His\r\nattitude towards the leaders must be admitted to have undergone actual\r\nmodification, notwithstanding his claim a few months later that he simply\r\nwished to make the leaders sue for pardon and realize the enormity of\r\ntheir offence.\r\n\r\n5. The real secret of the apparently strange development of his policy,\r\nwhich we are about to trace out, lies in the fact that although at this\r\ntime nominally a Republican, he was in reality a strict constructionist.\r\nHe had always been a Democrat, and still held Democratic views. Only when\r\nsecession began to be urged by the southern branch of the Democracy, did\r\nhe break loose from his old ties. Accustomed to interpret the Constitution\r\nfrom a strict constructionist standpoint, accustomed to the belief that\r\nthe power of the State was restricted only by the specific limitations of\r\nthe Constitution, and that the federal government could exercise no power\r\nbeyond that expressly granted it, he naturally treated the question of\r\nreconstruction from the same standpoint. The surprising thing in Johnson's\r\ncareer is the fact that in spite of his strict construction views, he was\r\nstrongly opposed to secession. He was therefore not strictly logical. The\r\nextreme strict constructionist claimed that the fact that the Constitution\r\ndid not forbid a State from seceding, made secession constitutional. But\r\nJohnson's love for the Union was too great to permit him to carry his\r\nstrict construction views to such an extreme. On the contrary, the fact\r\nthat the Constitution offered no way for a State to secede from the Union\r\nproved to him that secession was unconstitutional, and he looked upon that\r\nfact as one of the greatest safeguards for the protection of the\r\nCommonwealth.[44] To his mind it logically followed that because secession\r\nwas unconstitutional, it was absolutely impossible for a State to secede,\r\nand therefore equally impossible for a State to commit treason.\r\nIndividuals might commit treason and be punished therefor, but States\r\nnever. However strongly at any time he may have urged the punishment of\r\ntraitors, he never argued for or believed in the abrogation of any of the\r\nState's privileges. His reputation for belief in severity was based\r\nentirely upon severity on individuals. \"Make treason odious\" was his\r\nfavorite expression, but always used in a concrete sense.[45]\r\n\r\n6. After his accession to the Presidency, the only modification of his\r\npolicy was an increased clemency to the conquered rebel. This can be\r\naccounted for easily as the natural result of actual contact with the\r\nproblem. Rhetorically to assert that all traitors must be punished is one\r\nthing--to apply the punishment is another. Then Johnson's most able\r\nadvisers approved his attitude and urged even greater moderation. Finally,\r\nhis firm faith in the success of his provisional governments persuaded him\r\nto a still more liberal use of the pardoning power, while the growing\r\nopposition of Congress added the element of stubbornness to the\r\ncomplication. But, the true explanation of the change is to be found in\r\nhis general constitutional views.\r\n\r\nSo early as April 21 he frankly states his position. In his speech on\r\nthat day he says: \"Provision\" (in the Constitution) \"is made for the\r\nadmission of new States; no provision is made for the secession of old\r\nones. * * * The Government is composed of parts, each essential to the\r\nwhole, and the whole essential to each part.\"[46] He emphatically urges\r\nthat the Constitution provides a panacea for rebellion. \"The United States\r\n(that is, the great integer) shall guarantee to each State (the integers\r\ncomposing the whole) in this Union a republican form of government. Yes,\r\nif rebellion has been rampant, and set aside the machinery of a State for\r\na time, there stands the great law to remove the paralysis and revitalize\r\nit, and put it on its feet again.\" He also harmonizes his strict\r\nconstruction views with the fact of emancipation. \"A State may be in the\r\nGovernment with a peculiar institution, and by the operation of rebellion\r\nlose that feature; but it was a State when it went into rebellion, and\r\nwhen it comes out without the institution it is still a State.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson did not allow many days to pass by after his\r\ninstallation, before he began to give practical evidence of his attitude\r\ntowards the conquered South.[47] The first step which he made was an\r\norder, issued April 29, restoring partial commercial intercourse to that\r\nportion of the Confederate States lying east of the Mississippi river and\r\nwithin the lines of national military occupation. This removed at the\r\noutset one of the chief burdens that had resulted from the insurrection,\r\nand would he thought act powerfully in the restoration of peaceful\r\npursuits in that section. The following August another proclamation\r\nremoved all remaining restrictions on trade in those States, declaring\r\nthat all necessity for restriction had ceased.[48]\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1865, the order restoring the administration of the United\r\nStates in the State of Virginia was issued.[49] It authorized the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to nominate assessors of taxes, collectors of\r\ncustoms, and other officers of the Treasury Department, and further\r\nprovided that in making appointments the preference should be given to\r\n\"qualified loyal persons residing within the districts where their\r\nrespective duties are to be performed. But if suitable persons shall not\r\nbe found residents of the districts, then persons residing in other States\r\nor districts shall be appointed.\" Post offices and post routes were to be\r\nestablished, and district judges empowered to hold courts, while \"to carry\r\ninto effect the guarantee of the Federal Constitution of a republican form\r\nof state government, * * * Francis H. Pierpiont, Governor of the State of\r\nVirginia, will be aided by the Federal Government,\" in his administration\r\nof the state government, in whatever way might be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Amnesty Proclamation was issued on May 29, and was in effect a renewal\r\nof the provisions of Lincoln's proclamation of December 8, 1863, relating\r\nto amnesty; but it increased the number of classes excepted from the\r\nbenefits of the proclamation, from seven to fourteen,[50] and provided\r\nthat special application for pardon might be made by any of the excepted\r\nclasses, to the President, who would exercise liberal clemency. Inasmuch\r\nas the excepted classes included all those whom less than three weeks\r\npreviously he had been denouncing as traitors to be punished and\r\nimpoverished, such great liberality, displayed in so short a time, was\r\nsomewhat surprising.[51] The proclamation further empowered the Secretary\r\nof State to make all needful regulations for the administration and\r\nrecording of the amnesty oath; and in accordance with this provision the\r\nSecretary of State ordered that the oath might be taken before any\r\ncommissioned officer of the United States, or before any civil or military\r\nofficer of a loyal State or Territory, who was legally qualified to\r\nadminister oaths.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that he issued the Amnesty Proclamation, President Johnson\r\nappointed William W. Holden Provisional Governor of North Carolina.[52]\r\nThis was his first radical step in the carrying out of his policy of\r\nreconstruction. The order restoring the authority of the United States in\r\nVirginia was not of so great importance, as the State had nominally been\r\nunder the Pierpiont government since near the beginning of the war, and the\r\nmere restoration of certain United States officers in that State did not\r\ninvolve to any extent the vital questions of the hour.[53] But with the\r\nappointment of Mr. Holden, and the instructions accompanying the order of\r\nappointment, President Johnson unfolded, in its entirety, his theory.\r\n\r\nThe order declared that the rebellion, though now almost entirely\r\novercome, had deprived the people of North Carolina of all civil\r\ngovernment, and that accordingly the United States was constitutionally\r\nbound to secure to them a republican form of government. Therefore for the\r\npurpose of enabling the people to organize a government, he appointed\r\nWilliam W. Holden Provisional Governor of North Carolina, whose duty it\r\nshould be \"at the earliest practicable period, to prescribe such rules and\r\nregulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a convention,\r\ncomposed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the people of said\r\nState who are loyal to the United States, and no others, for the purpose\r\nof altering or amending the constitution thereof; and with authority to\r\nexercise, within the limits of said state, all the powers necessary and\r\nproper to enable such loyal people of the State of North Carolina to\r\nrestore said State to its constitutional relations to the Federal\r\ngovernment, and to present such a republican form of state government as\r\nwill entitle the State to the guarantee of the United States therefor, and\r\nits people to protection by the United States against invasion,\r\ninsurrection, and domestic violence,\" provided, however, that all electors\r\nshould have previously taken the oath of allegiance, and should be voters\r\naccording to the law of North Carolina in force previous to secession. The\r\norder further directed that the Provisional Governor should be aided by\r\nthe military power in carrying out the proclamation. The other clauses\r\nwere similar to clauses in the order re-establishing the authority of the\r\nUnited States in Virginia.\r\n\r\nSimilar proclamations were issued as follows: June 13, for Mississippi;\r\nJune 17, for Georgia and Texas; June 21, for Alabama; June 30, for South\r\nCarolina; July 13, for Florida.\r\n\r\nWithin three months after his inauguration, accordingly, Johnson had set\r\nthe forces going throughout the South by which he hoped that peace and\r\ntranquillity might be established, and the Union once more become an\r\nundivided whole. In the execution of this most important work, he had not\r\nasked for the co-operation or advice of Congress. Confident of the\r\ncorrectness of his ideas, feeling sure that they were only the logical\r\nresults of a true interpretation of the Constitution, he pursued his\r\npolicy of reconstruction. In so doing he was also consistently following\r\nthe path marked out by his predecessor. His plan was essentially that\r\nwhich Lincoln had advocated and attempted to carry into execution. But we\r\nhave seen that even under a man enjoying such universal confidence as did\r\nLincoln, the country viewed with distrust, and Congress openly resented, a\r\npolicy which seemed to commit to a recently insurrectionary people the\r\nwhole responsibility for proper reconstruction, requiring from them no\r\nsurety for sincerity save an oath which all knew would be regarded by the\r\nmajority as a mere form with little significance. The same policy when\r\nadopted by Johnson was naturally looked upon with still more suspicion.\r\n\r\nLincoln was a man of tact and judgment, who was capable of seeing and\r\nconfessing a mistake, whose sole object was to do that which, all things\r\nbeing considered, should seem best for the Union.\r\n\r\nJohnson, on the contrary, from his natural arbitrariness and narrowness,\r\nwas a man who held most tenaciously to his views, had little consideration\r\nfor the views of others, and who was always determined that his own way\r\nshould be carried out. Under such circumstances it would have been little\r\nshort of marvelous, had he been able to carry out a policy in itself\r\ndisliked, without sooner or later coming into collision with those who\r\ndisapproved his theory.\r\n\r\nThe provisional governors appointed were not slow in carrying out the\r\nprovisions of the proclamations, and conventions met in the various states\r\nas follows: Mississippi, August 14; Alabama, September 12; South Carolina,\r\nSeptember 13; North Carolina, October 2; Georgia, October 25; Florida,\r\nOctober 25; and Texas in March, 1866. In all these conventions the\r\nsecession ordinances were repealed, annulled or declared null and\r\nvoid,[54] and slavery was declared abolished. All but Mississippi and\r\nSouth Carolina repudiated the rebel debt, and all but Mississippi and\r\nTexas ratified the 13th Amendment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Johnson made liberal use of the pardoning power, and large\r\nnumbers of the excepted classes were thus restored to all the privileges\r\nof citizens of the United States. The reconstruction was very rapid; so\r\nrapid, as Johnson himself said, that he could scarcely realize it; \"it\r\nappears like a dream.\"\r\n\r\nThe extreme similarity of this method of reconstruction to that advocated\r\nby the Democracy could not escape attention, and Democrats freely asserted\r\nthat in his ideas the President was \"going over to them.\" This, while to a\r\ncertain extent true, for he was always a Democrat in principle, was\r\nvigorously denied by Johnson in an interview with Geo. L. Stearns on\r\nOctober 3, 1865. In it he claimed that the Democratic party, finding its\r\nown views untenable, was gradually coming to adopt his principles, which\r\nhe reasserted in the following form: \"The States are in the Union, which\r\nis one and indivisible. Individuals tried to carry them out, but did not\r\nsucceed, as a man may try to cut his throat and be prevented by the\r\nbystanders; and you can not say he cut his throat because he tried to do\r\nit. * * * Now we want to reconstruct the state governments, and have the\r\npower to do it. The state institutions are prostrated, laid out on the\r\nground, and they must be taken up and adapted to the progress of events;\r\nthis cannot be done in a moment. * * * We must not be in too much of a\r\nhurry; it is better to let them reconstruct themselves than to force them\r\nto do it; for if they go wrong the power is in our hands, and we can check\r\nthem in any stage, to the end, and oblige them to correct their errors; we\r\nmust be patient with them. I did not expect to keep out all who were\r\nexcluded from the amnesty, or even a large number of them; but I intended\r\nthey should sue for pardon, and so realize the enormity of the crime they\r\nhad committed.\"\r\n\r\n7. Johnson realized that the sentiment in favor of negro suffrage was\r\ngaining great power in the North; and while feeling that pure manhood\r\nsuffrage was undesirable and totally impracticable, because of the danger\r\nof thereby creating a \"war of races,\" which he seemed constantly to fear,\r\nhe determined to use his influence towards a gradual introduction of the\r\nsuffrage. He would give the suffrage to negroes who had served in the\r\narmy, to those who could read and write, and to those owning real estate\r\nto the value of two hundred and fifty dollars. He made suggestions of this\r\nnature in letters to Governor Starkey of Mississippi, and Governor Hahn of\r\nLouisiana.[55] By some such limited suffrage he hoped that the radical\r\nelement in the North would be satisfied, while there could result no\r\ndanger to those States in which the negro population predominated.\r\n\r\nHe had long believed that the apportionment of Representatives should be\r\nbased on the number of qualified voters; while a member of the legislature\r\nof Tennessee he had moved that the apportionment in that State be so made;\r\nand in the interview with Mr. Stearns he said: \"The apportionment is now\r\nfixed until 1872; before that time we might change the basis of\r\nrepresentation from population to qualified voters, North as well as\r\nSouth, and, in due course of time, the States, _without regard_ to color,\r\nmight extend the elective franchise to all who possessed certain mental,\r\nmoral or such other qualifications as might be determined by an\r\nenlightened public judgment.\"[56]\r\n\r\nBut however desirable a limited suffrage might be, he insisted that the\r\nonly safety for the nation lay in leaving the whole subject to the\r\ndiscretion of the individual State. The only approach which he would make\r\nto national interference would be through constitutional amendment. In an\r\ninterview with Senator Dixon of Connecticut, on January 28, 1866, he\r\nsuggested that such an amendment might be worded in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States which may\r\nbe included within this Union according to the number of qualified voters\r\nin each State.\r\n\r\n\"Direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be\r\nincluded within this Union according to the value of all taxable property\r\nin each State.\"[57]\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of an amendment of this kind, in President Johnson's\r\nopinion, was that Congress would thus shift all responsibility regarding\r\nnegro suffrage to the States. Each State would determine the\r\nqualifications for voters, and its representation in Congress would depend\r\nentirely upon the narrowness or broadness of the suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn the same interview with Senator Dixon, he described the current\r\ncontention over negro suffrage as \"ill-timed, uncalled for, and calculated\r\nto do great harm.\"\r\n\r\n8. While the President was expressing his belief in qualified\r\nrepresentation, and advising the States in process of reconstruction to\r\ngrant some form of limited suffrage, the States themselves manifested no\r\ndisposition to follow his advice. While he was describing them in October\r\nas lying helpless, they were busy framing laws which were aimed to\r\ncounteract, so far as possible, the force of the emancipation\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nWhen Georgia declared slavery abolished she did so with the proviso that\r\n\"acquiescence in the action of the Government of the United States is not\r\nintended to operate as a relinquishment, or waiver, or estoppel of such\r\nclaim for compensation of loss sustained by reason of the emancipation of\r\nhis slaves, as any citizen of Georgia may hereafter make upon the justice\r\nand magnanimity of that Government.\"[58] Alabama, South Carolina, and\r\nFlorida in their ratifications of the 13th Amendment stated their\r\nunderstanding to be that it did not confer upon Congress power to\r\nlegislate upon the political status of the freedman. The Alabama\r\nlegislature passed joint resolutions in which it was affirmed: \"That\r\nAlabama will not voluntarily consent to change the adjustment of political\r\npower as fixed by the Constitution of the United States, and to constrain\r\nher to do so, in her present prostrate and helpless condition, with no\r\nvoice in the councils of the nation, would be an unjustifiable breach of\r\nfaith.\"[59]\r\n\r\nBut most important of all was the legislation of these States respecting\r\nthe freedman. All were confronted by a host of emancipated blacks, whose\r\nlegal status had to be determined. The legislatures had before them work\r\nof the most delicate nature, inasmuch as it not only vitally affected\r\nevery person in their own section, but also attracted the keenest interest\r\nfrom the whole North. All realized that Johnson's policy would here\r\nundergo the crucial test. Would the legislators of these States, so soon\r\nthrown upon their own responsibility, show due consideration for the new\r\norder of things, or would they take advantage of their opportunity and\r\nproceed to draw the color line as sharply as ever, discriminating against\r\nthe negro, and denying him privileges which should be allowed him? Had\r\nthe South proved equal to the situation, the wisdom of Johnson's policy\r\nwould have been sustained, and the bitterness characteristic of the 39th\r\nand 40th Congresses would have been avoided.\r\n\r\nMississippi was the first to adopt \"black laws\" obnoxious to the North.\r\nHer vagrant act was passed November 24, 1865. This provided that freedmen\r\nfound with no lawful employment or business, or unlawfully assembling\r\ntogether, should be deemed vagrants, and be fined and imprisoned at the\r\ndiscretion of the court. A poll tax for a freedmen's pauper fund was to be\r\nlevied on all freedmen, and should any fail or refuse to pay, he was to be\r\nhired out by the sheriff to any one who would pay the tax and costs,\r\npreference being given to his former master. Two days later a civil rights\r\nact was passed. This allowed freedmen to sue and be sued, implead and be\r\nimpleaded, and to own personal property, but added the important proviso\r\nthat the section should not be construed \"to allow any freedman, free\r\nnegro or mulatto to rent or lease any lands or tenements, except in\r\nincorporated towns or cities,\" where they should be controlled by the\r\ncorporate authorities. Intermarriage of a white with any freedman, free\r\nnegro or mulatto, should be punished by imprisonment in the state\r\npenitentiary for life. A laborer quitting before expiration of term of\r\nservice without good cause, forfeited to his employer all wages for that\r\nyear up to the time of quitting. Any one was authorized to arrest and\r\nreturn a deserting freedman, receiving therefor five dollars reward and\r\nmileage, all costs to be paid from the wages of the deserter. Any one\r\npersuading or attempting to persuade any freedman to desert his employer\r\nbefore his term of service expired, was guilty of a misdemeanor, and\r\nliable to a fine of not less than twenty-five and not more than two\r\nhundred dollars, and if the offender attempted to persuade the freedman\r\nto desert, with a view of employing him without the limits of the State,\r\nthe fine was to be not less than fifty nor more than five hundred dollars.\r\nWhile it was made lawful for a freedman to charge a white man with a\r\ncriminal offence against his person or property, and to make all needful\r\naffidavits, a supplementary act passed December 2 provided that where\r\nsufficient proof was made before a court or jury that the arrest and trial\r\nhad been falsely or maliciously caused, the freedman should be fined, and\r\ncharged with all costs, and on failure to pay should be hired out at\r\npublic outcry for the shortest time necessary to discharge the debt. An\r\nact passed November 29, among other restrictions, forbade freedmen to\r\ncarry any fire arms, ammunition, dirk or bowie knife, under penalty, and\r\ndeclared that a freedman exercising the functions of a minister of the\r\ngospel, without a license from some regularly organized church, should be\r\nguilty of a misdemeanor, and become liable to an imprisonment not\r\nexceeding thirty days and to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nSimilar laws were enacted in the other States, varying slightly in\r\nseverity of punishment. The labor contract act of Louisiana, passed in\r\nDecember, is of especial interest as an evidence of the systematic way in\r\nwhich the Southern legislators hoped to mould the unwieldy mass of\r\nfreedmen into a docile set of serfs. All agricultural laborers were\r\nrequired by this act to make their contract for the ensuing year before\r\nthe tenth day of January; said contract to embrace the labor of the whole\r\nfamily. After the contract had been agreed to, no laborer was to be\r\nallowed to \"leave his place of employment until the fulfillment of his\r\ncontract, unless by consent of his employer, or on account of harsh\r\ntreatment, or breach of contract on the part of employer,\" under penalty\r\nof forfeiture of all wages to the time of leaving. \"Failing to obey\r\nreasonable orders, neglect of duty, and leaving home without permission,\r\nwill be deemed disobedience; impudence, swearing, or indecent language to\r\nor in the presence of the employer, his family or agent, or quarreling or\r\nfighting with one another, shall be deemed disobedience. For any\r\ndisobedience a fine of one dollar shall be imposed upon the offender. For\r\nall lost time from work hours, unless in case of sickness, the laborer\r\nshall be fined twenty-five cents per hour. For all absence from home\r\nwithout leave the laborer will be fined at the rate of two dollars per\r\nday.\"[60]\r\n\r\nThe cruelty and injustice possible in the administration of these acts is\r\neven greater than their casual perusal would indicate. Many of these acts,\r\nnominally applying to both races with equal severity, were in reality\r\nintended to apply solely to the negro. The vagrants always proved to be\r\ncolored. The acts purporting to secure the protection of the freedmen were\r\ncunningly hedged in by limitations which made them worthless. The employer\r\nwas made the sole judge of the acts of his employees--a privilege which\r\ncould not but be flagrantly abused. Laws that made it almost impossible\r\nfor the freedman to secure the just return for his labor, were followed by\r\nlaws punishing him for his poverty. The fines for his so-called offences\r\nwere excessively severe, and the punishments were almost always such as to\r\nreduce him to slavery for limited terms. The whole system, taken advantage\r\nof as it could not fail to be where the dominant classes were almost\r\nunanimously desirous to retain the negro in subjection, resulted in his\r\npractical slavery during those seasons of the year in which his labor was\r\nmost needed, and in utter neglect and lack of support when his labor was\r\nnot in demand.\r\n\r\n9. Although the enactment of these stringent laws at this time was a\r\npolitical mistake, and was fraught with most serious consequences for the\r\nSouth, it is proper to notice what was said in their justification. Many\r\nof them did not differ materially from similar statutes in the Northern\r\nStates. Even some of the harshest laws, those which were received with\r\nwide-spread indignation throughout the North, could almost be duplicated\r\nby laws at that time in force in such States as Rhode Island and\r\nConnecticut. Even the phraseology, the using of the words master, mistress\r\nand servant, which was deemed objectionable and suggestive by Northern\r\nRepublicans, could be found in Northern statutes.\r\n\r\nThe South felt confident that the negro was unable actively to assume the\r\nduties of citizenship. The Southern people feared, and with reason, that\r\nthe immense mass of undeveloped humanity was liable to become turbulent\r\nand unmanageable, unless stringent laws could be framed which would hold\r\nit in check.[61] They were sincere in their statements that they believed\r\nthat the interests of property, peace and good order demanded these laws.\r\nUnfortunately, the humanitarian ideas of the North harmonized too well\r\nwith the political ideas of Congress. The enactment of the laws against\r\nthe negro seemed to strike at the one and make possible the success of the\r\nother. The radical majority were quick to see their advantage, and did not\r\nhesitate to make the most of the opportunity. They assumed that the South\r\ndeliberately intended to defy Northern sentiment, and ignored the\r\npossibility that the legislation in question was sincerely believed to be\r\na necessary act of self-defense.\r\n\r\n10. To Stevens and his followers the South had proved its impenitent\r\ncondition, and had justified the most stringent measures of\r\nreconstruction. They declared that Johnson's policy had been fairly tested\r\nand that the results of the experiment were apparent. They argued that the\r\nSouth, emboldened by the conciliatory conduct of the President, was\r\npermitting the old rebel leaders to continue to wield the chief influence\r\nin affairs of state. The exclusion of these leaders from participation in\r\nthe preliminary work of the reconstruction conventions was no check upon\r\ntheir influence in the State, and with the completion of reconstruction\r\nthere was nothing to prevent them from occupying the chief state offices.\r\nWhat the President in the previous April had feared, was coming to pass,\r\nthrough his failure to do that which he had then said must be done--to\r\nmake treason and traitors odious. In proof of the ascendency of the old\r\nelements, the highly questionable legislation of the South was cited, and\r\nthe conviction of the Republican party that sterner measures were\r\nnecessary was strengthened. As a natural result the doctrine of Thaddeus\r\nStevens that the South should be regarded and governed as a conquered\r\nterritory became practically the doctrine of the majority of Republicans,\r\nand Stevens became the leader of the House of Representatives. The year\r\n1865 had made plain the necessities of the hour, the condition of the\r\nSouth, the attitude of the President, and in short had prepared the people\r\nfor the great struggle which was to follow in the 39th and 40th\r\nCongresses.[62]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTITUDE OF CONGRESS TOWARDS THE EXPERIMENT: DEVELOPMENT OF THE\r\nCONGRESSIONAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Thirty-ninth Congress began its labors on December 4, 1865, well\r\naware that the President had separated himself from the Republican party\r\nso far that it was improbable that the executive and legislative\r\ndepartments would be able to work in harmony. The Democrats were beginning\r\nto commend the administration, and had even gone so far in some instances\r\nas to indicate, in resolutions passed in their state conventions, their\r\napproval of Johnson's plan of reconstruction. Republicans, on the other\r\nhand, were becoming quite reserved in their expressions of approval, and\r\nbegan to show a decided sentiment in favor of manhood suffrage as\r\ninvolving less danger and more benefit to the Republic than any plan which\r\neven partially excluded the negro from the franchise. The legislation of\r\nthe Southern States had convinced many that without the negro vote there\r\nwould be no way to keep the old insurrectionary element from completely\r\nmonopolizing their state governments.[63]\r\n\r\nCongress with its large Republican majorities[64] in both houses was\r\nexpected to deal with the problem, correct the abuses which had arisen\r\nfrom the too lenient policy of the President, and inaugurate a policy\r\nwhich should bring about an equality of individual rights throughout the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n2. The calling of the roll by the clerk of the House, Edward McPherson,\r\nmarked the commencement of active opposition to the presidential policy.\r\nAll of the late insurrectionary States excepting Texas, whose convention\r\ndid not meet until the following March, had elected senators and\r\nrepresentatives. Their action in choosing for these and other high\r\nofficial positions members of the Confederate Congress, and civil and\r\nmilitary officers of the Confederacy, was very unwise and did much to\r\nstrengthen opposition to the recognition of these States.[65]\r\n\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee, having been recognized by Lincoln as\r\nreconstructed, stood upon a somewhat different footing from the others,\r\nbut in a caucus of the Republican members of the House, held previous to\r\nthe organization of Congress, it had been decided to omit the names of\r\ntheir representatives from the rolls so as to reduce all to a common\r\nlevel, that no embarrassing distinctions might exist to hamper Congress in\r\nthe adoption of whatever policy it chose.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the instructions of the caucus, the clerk refused to\r\ncall the names of these representatives elect. A lively discussion\r\nimmediately arose, in which emphatic protest was made against forcing in\r\nthis way a policy upon the House at a time when due deliberation could not\r\nbe had. It was boldly asserted[66] that the clerk was acting merely as the\r\ntool of the Republican party, and the claim was also made that the\r\nresolutions about to be introduced by Mr. Stevens of Pennsylvania were\r\nanother part of the general plan to commit the House to a\r\nquasi-condemnation of the President, and virtually nullify in advance the\r\nrecommendations which it was supposed he would make. But protest was\r\nuseless; the names were not placed on the rolls, and the first roll-call\r\ngave evidence that active resistance to the President was determined upon.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was almost equally prompt in making public its determination to\r\ntake the process of reconstruction out of the hands of the President. It\r\nis the custom in Congress to refrain from the consideration of questions\r\nof public importance until the President's message has been received. At\r\nthe opening of this Congress no such courtesy was observed. Among the very\r\nfirst proceedings of the Senate after its organization was the\r\nintroduction of three series of resolutions by Sumner.[67] The first\r\nseries was in reference to the Thirteenth Amendment, declaring it to have\r\nbecome a part of the Constitution without reference to the action of the\r\nlate so-called Confederate States. Such States, the resolutions affirmed,\r\nshould be required to ratify the Amendment as one of the conditions\r\nprecedent to restoration. The second series related to the guarantees\r\nwhich should be required of the States prior to resuming their relations\r\nto the Union. These guarantees were five in number. First: \"The complete\r\nre-establishment of loyalty, as shown by an honest recognition of the\r\nunity of the Republic, and the duty of allegiance to it at all times,\r\nwithout mental reservation or equivocation of any kind.\" Second: \"The\r\ncomplete suppression of all oligarchical pretensions, and the complete\r\nenfranchisement of all citizens;\" impartial justice, and equality before\r\nthe law. Third: The repudiation of the rebel debt and the assumption of\r\nthe proper proportion of the national debts and obligations. Fourth: \"The\r\norganization of an educational system for the equal benefit of all,\r\nwithout distinction of color or race.\" Fifth: \"The choice of citizens for\r\noffice, whether State or National, of constant and undoubted loyalty,\r\nwhose conduct and conversation shall give assurances of peace and\r\nreconciliation.\" The third series was declaratory of the duty of Congress\r\nto the loyal citizens in the rebel States. They, especially those who had\r\nserved in the Union army and those excluded from the ballot at the time of\r\nsecession, should have control of the conventions to be called for\r\nreorganizing the state governments. \"No state law or state constitution\r\ncan be set up as an impediment to the national power\" in the\r\nreorganization of these States. No State recently in rebellion could be\r\nconsidered to have a republican form of government \"where the elective\r\nfranchise and civil rights are denied to the Union soldier, his relatives,\r\nor the colored race.\"\r\n\r\nThe submission of these resolutions was of significance merely as a formal\r\ndeclaration that the President was to be ignored and an independent policy\r\nformed. The plan of reconstruction, as here presented, embodied many\r\nimpracticabilities and impossibilities, but it indicated in broad outlines\r\nthe propositions to be discussed in the succeeding months.\r\n\r\nThe House was still more active in its initiatory steps toward a policy.\r\nThe resolution for the establishment of a joint committee on\r\nreconstruction was introduced by Mr. Stevens at the first opportunity on\r\nthe opening day, and immediately adopted. This resolution, after having\r\nbeen discussed in a Republican caucus,[68] was taken up for consideration\r\nin the Senate on December 12,[69] was made a concurrent resolution, that\r\nit might not need the approval of the President, and was passed with\r\namendments. The debate on this resolution is of especial importance as the\r\nfirst formal test of the attitude of the individual Senators towards the\r\nadministration. It brought out the fact that Senators Cowan of\r\nPennsylvania, Dixon of Connecticut, and Doolittle of Wisconsin, would\r\nsupport the administration and oppose the congressional policy. Senator\r\nNorton, of Minnesota, soon joined their ranks, and Senator Lane[70] of\r\nKansas, broke from the party on the Civil Rights bill. The remaining\r\nRepublican senators, while exhibiting natural differences of opinion, were\r\nunited in their hostility to the existing method of restoration.\r\n\r\nThe resolution, as amended and concurred in by the House, provided for a\r\njoint committee of fifteen, nine from the House and six from the Senate,\r\n\"who shall inquire into the condition of the States which formed the\r\nso-called Confederate States of America, and report whether they or any of\r\nthem are entitled to be represented in either House of Congress, with\r\nleave to report at any time by bill or otherwise.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThe appointment of this committee, with Thaddeus Stevens as a member,\r\nalthough Senator Fessenden of Maine was chairman, marks an important epoch\r\nin the history of reconstruction.[72] Stevens, now the virtual leader of\r\nthe House, represented a policy to which Johnson was thoroughly\r\nantagonistic, and from this time forth everything relating to the\r\nreconstruction of the Southern States was to be referred to this\r\ncommittee. In addition, the committee took large masses of testimony from\r\nsoutherners, federal officers, and northerners travelling through the\r\nSouthern States, in order that an intelligent judgment might be reached\r\nregarding the actual condition of these States. The bills in which they\r\nembodied the results of their investigations constituted the basis of the\r\nfinal reconstruction. The ill-defined sentiment of the Republicans, that\r\nthe proper mode of dealing with the Southern States had not been found,\r\nwas to be replaced by a vigorous policy which looked primarily to the\r\nproper protection of the freedman.\r\n\r\n3. The message of the President, which was read on the 5th of December,\r\nhad been eagerly awaited.[73] It had been expected that it would contain a\r\ndecided statement of his exact views on reconstruction, and expectations\r\nwere fulfilled. It was a clearly written document, and outlined in extreme\r\nsimplicity his attitude. In it he says, referring to the rebel States:\r\n\"Whether the territory within the limits of those States should be held as\r\nconquered territory, under military authority emanating from the President\r\nas the head of the army, was the first question that presented itself for\r\ndecision.\" His unhesitating answer to this question was that military rule\r\nwas extremely undesirable, especially from the greatly increased powers\r\nwhich thereby would be held by the President. \"The powers of patronage and\r\nrule * * * I could never, unless on occasions of great emergency, consent\r\nto exercise. * * * Besides, the policy of military rule over a conquered\r\nterritory would have implied that the States whose inhabitants may have\r\ntaken part in the rebellion, had, by the act of those inhabitants, ceased\r\nto exist. But the true theory is, that all pretended acts of secession\r\nwere, from the beginning, null, and void. The States cannot commit\r\ntreason, nor screen the individual citizens who may have committed\r\ntreason, any more than they can make valid treaties or engage in lawful\r\ncommerce with any foreign power. The States attempting to secede placed\r\nthemselves in a condition where their vitality was impaired, but not\r\nextinguished--their functions suspended, but not destroyed.\" These\r\nsentiments were but the repetition, in almost the same language, of\r\nsentiments previously expressed in various interviews and speeches. The\r\nsignificance of the message was merely his recommitment to the policy he\r\nwas applying in practice. But the consideration of the message in\r\ncommittee of the whole afforded a good opportunity for general discussions\r\nof reconstruction, which were continued at intervals throughout the whole\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nThe great debate was opened on December 18 by Mr. Stevens, who reasserted\r\nhis views, declaring that Congress has the sole power to receive back the\r\nStates, the Executive concurring.[74] The States as States made war. \"The\r\nidea that the States could not and did not make war because the\r\nConstitution forbids it, and that this must be treated as a war of\r\nindividuals, is a very injurious fallacy. Individuals cannot make war.\r\nThey may commit murder, but that is not war. Communities, societies,\r\nstates, make war.\" He earnestly pleaded for negro suffrage both on grounds\r\nof expediency and of right, closing his speech with the oft-quoted\r\nsentence: \"Sir, this doctrine of a white man's government is as atrocious\r\nas the infamous sentiment that damned the late Chief Justice to\r\neverlasting fame, and I fear, to everlasting fire.\"[75] Mr. Beaman, on\r\nFebruary 24, after dwelling upon the horrors of the late war, said: \"Those\r\nwere sad, dark days, whose tinge was deepened by the frowns and hostile\r\nintrigues of foreign nations. But sadder still, and darker and more\r\ngloomy, will be that day in which the rebel States shall assume the\r\ncontrol of our national government; when without guards or security for\r\nfuture good conduct, without protection to the blacks and loyal whites who\r\nhave freely shed their blood in our defense, the seceded districts shall\r\nbe declared reconstructed and restored States, and again launched upon\r\ntheir career of oppression, tyranny and crime.\"[76]\r\n\r\nOn March 10, Mr. Stevens made a speech upholding the right of the federal\r\ngovernment to treat the conquered States in whatever manner was deemed\r\nadvisable. \"I trust yet to see our confiscation laws fully executed; and\r\nthen the malefactors will learn that what Congress has seized as enemy's\r\nproperty and invested in the United States, cannot be divested and\r\nreturned to the conquered belligerent by the mere voice of the Executive.\r\nI hope to see the property of the subdued enemy pay the damages done to\r\nloyal men, North and South, and help to support the helpless, armless,\r\nmutilated soldiers who have been made wretched by this unholy war. I do\r\nnot believe the action of the President is worth a farthing in releasing\r\nthe property conquered from the enemy, from the appropriation made of it\r\nby Congress.\"[76]\r\n\r\nOther speeches just as violent, condemning Johnson and his policy, were\r\nmade during these general discussions. Thus Mr. Dumont of Indiana said:\r\n\"Some gentlemen seem to be anxious to hear within this Hall the crack of\r\nthe plantation whip, and to have a manifestation of plantation manners as\r\nin days of other years; and as sure as God lives they will be abundantly\r\ngratified, if the policy of letting in the rebel States without guaranties\r\nshall prevail.\"[77] And Mr. Moulton, of Illinois, a week later declared\r\nthat \"Andy Johnson will go down to posterity, not only as the betrayer of\r\nhis party, but as an ingrate, infamous in all time to come to all\r\nhonorable men.\"[78] In the same speech he says: \"No rights of the South\r\nthat were lost by the rebellion were revived or repossessed by traitors on\r\nthe cessation of hostilities. War destroys all rights but the rights of\r\nwar.\"[79] Mr. Baldwin, of Massachusetts, described the attitude of the\r\nSouthern States as follows: \"It is undeniably the aim of the old\r\npro-slavery spirit to reduce them [the freedmen] to a condition as nearly\r\nlike that of slavery as circumstances will admit; a condition that would\r\nyield all the advantages of slavery without any of its incumbrances. The\r\nhatred which has declared the freedom of these people a calamity conspires\r\ndiligently to make it so; the government is angrily forbidden to interfere\r\nwith its operations; and if there be an epithet of contumely and reproach\r\nthat has not been hurled at those who would allow these people the\r\nprotection they need, it must be some blackguard epithet not yet\r\ninvented.\"[81]\r\n\r\nBut the policy of the President was not without its vigorous supporters,\r\nalthough they generally were found among the Democrats. Thus Voorhees, on\r\nJanuary 9, eulogized Johnson's policy as having \"cleared away the wreck\r\nof a gigantic fraternal war, laid anew the foundation of government\r\nthroughout an extent of country more vast than the most powerful kingdoms\r\nof Europe, revived confidence and hopes in the breasts of a despairing\r\npeople, and won for its author the respect and admiration of the civilized\r\nnations of both hemispheres.\"[82] He also introduced a series of\r\nresolutions endorsing the policy of the President, and expressing\r\nconfidence in him;[83] but these, together with an amendment by Bingham,\r\nexpressing confidence that the President would co-operate with Congress,\r\nwere referred to the Committee on Reconstruction, from which they were\r\nnever reported.\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton, of Illinois, thought that \"if those States are ever to be\r\nbound together in an equal and enduring union by us, we must rise to the\r\nhigh dignity of true manhood and Christian charity, and bury forever the\r\nfeelings of distrust which now haunt the mind. The charge is constantly\r\nmade that the Southern people are perfidious; that they will keep no\r\npledges; that no oath will bind them. Can they accept your conditions\r\nprecedent tendered in such a spirit? Never!\"[84] Mr. Harding, of Kentucky,\r\ndeclared that the Republican party \"with the cry of liberty on its tongue,\r\nis earnestly striving to subvert the foundations of republican government,\r\nlaboring to centralize, consolidate and build up a frightful Federal\r\ndespotism, under whose dark and deadly shadow self-government and all\r\nstate rights would utterly sink and perish.\"[85]\r\n\r\n4. The objectionable \"black laws\" of the Southern States, and the many\r\ntales of the oppression and cruel treatment of negroes, brought about a\r\nstrong sentiment in favor of legislation by Congress giving additional\r\nprotection to the freedman.[86] The Act of March 3, 1865, had established\r\nin the War Department a \"Bureau for the relief of Freedmen and Refugees,\"\r\nwhich was \"to continue during the present war of rebellion, and for one\r\nyear thereafter.\"[87] This bureau was to assume control of all abandoned\r\nor confiscated lands in the insurrectionary States, and to assign tracts\r\nnot to exceed forty acres each to freedmen and refugees at an annual rent\r\nof not more than six per cent. of the value. The occupants were to be\r\nallowed to purchase the land at any time within three years. The bureau\r\nwas also authorized to supervise all matters that might concern freedmen\r\nand refugees from any of the rebel States or from districts occupied by\r\nthe army, and to furnish supplies to such as were in need.\r\n\r\nTo extend the powers of this bureau and to continue it in operation until\r\naffairs had resumed their normal course, appeared to be a practicable way\r\nto protect the emancipated race. A bill to this effect was introduced in\r\nthe Senate by Mr. Trumbull on January 5, 1866,[88] and the Senate\r\nproceeded to its consideration on the 12th. With certain amendments the\r\nbill passed the Senate on the 25th by a vote of 37 to 10. The Select\r\nCommittee on Freedmen[89] to which the Senate bill had been referred by\r\nthe House, reported on January 30 a substitute bill. This passed the House\r\non the 6th of February by a vote of 136 to 33; it was amended by the\r\nSenate on the 7th, the House concurring on the 9th. It was vetoed by the\r\nPresident on the 10th, and the Senate on the 10th attempted to pass the\r\nbill over the veto. The result showed 30 votes in favor, 19 against, less\r\nthan a two-thirds majority, and the bill thus failed to become a law.[90]\r\n\r\nThe bill as presented to the President for his signature was entitled \"An\r\nAct to amend an act entitled 'An act to establish a Bureau for the relief\r\nof Freedmen and Refugees,' and for other purposes.\"[91] It continued in\r\nforce the act of March 3, 1865, and extended the jurisdiction of the\r\nbureau to freedmen and refugees in all parts of the United States. The\r\nPresident was authorized to \"divide the section of country containing such\r\nrefugees and freedmen into districts, each containing one or more States,\r\nnot to exceed twelve in number, and, by and with the consent of the\r\nSenate, appoint an assistant commissioner for each of said districts;\" or\r\nin the discretion of the President \"the bureau might be placed under a\r\ncommissioner and assistant commissioner to be detailed from the army.\"\r\nDistricts when necessary were divided into sub districts under agents.\r\nMilitary jurisdiction and protection were to extend over all connected\r\nwith the bureau. Unoccupied public lands in the Southern States, not to\r\nexceed three million acres, were to be set apart for freedmen. Military\r\nprotection was to be extended over all persons denied civil rights on\r\naccount of race, color or previous servitude, and punishment was provided\r\nfor those who deprived such parties of their civil rights.\r\n\r\nThe debates on this bill, occurring as they did before the President's\r\nspeech of February 22, which will hereafter be noticed, lacked the great\r\nbitterness which was frequently manifested in the later days of the\r\nsession. The fact that the veto message was received before the 22d\r\naccounts for the failure of the attempt to override it.[92]\r\n\r\nThe bill itself was moderate, the freedmen obviously needed the\r\nlegislation, but the President considered the principles at stake of\r\nsufficient importance to justify him in further antagonizing Congress. His\r\nveto message cited a number of reasons for withholding the executive\r\napproval.[93] In the first place he claimed that there was no immediate\r\nnecessity for the measure. Then it also contained provisions which were\r\nunconstitutional and unsuited to accomplish the desired end. His chief\r\nobjection, of course, was based upon the continuance of military\r\njurisdiction into a time of peace. This he declared clearly\r\nunconstitutional, a violation of the right of _habeas corpus_ and of trial\r\nby jury; and he added that \"for the sake of a more vigorous interposition\r\nin behalf of justice we are to take the risks of the many acts of\r\ninjustice that would necessarily follow from an almost countless number of\r\nagents, * * * over whose decisions there is to be no supervision or\r\ncontrol by the federal courts. * * * The country has returned or is\r\nreturning to a state of peace and industry, and the rebellion is in fact\r\nat an end. The measure, therefore, seems to be as inconsistent with the\r\nactual conditions of the country as it is at variance with the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" He considered the provisions which\r\nproposed to take away land from its former owners without due process of\r\nlaw, unconstitutional. Other more general objections were mentioned, such\r\nas the immense patronage created and immense expense involved, the\r\ndangerous concentration of power in the Executive, and the ethical\r\nobjection that legislation which implies that the freedmen \"are not\r\nexpected to attain a self-sustaining condition must have a tendency\r\ninjurious alike to their character and their prospects.\"[94]\r\n\r\nThe unification of opposition to the President, which was accomplished\r\nthrough his speech of February 22, afterwards impelled the friends of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau bill to make another attempt to secure its passage,\r\nbelieving that it then could be passed over the President's veto.[95] The\r\nball was again set rolling by Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, who on May 22\r\nintroduced a bill designed to take the place of the defeated bill, yet\r\ndifferent enough to afford a plausible pretext for again bringing the\r\nquestion forward. Slightly amended, it passed the House on May 29 by a\r\nvote of 96 to 32. The bill, with amendments, reported from the Committee\r\non Military Affairs, of which Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, was\r\nchairman, was taken up for consideration by the Senate on June 26, and\r\npassed. The House non-concurring, a committee of conference was appointed,\r\nwhich made some minor changes, to which the Senate on July 2, and the\r\nHouse on July 3, agreed. A veto message of the President was received on\r\nJuly 16, and the bill was passed over the veto on the same day.[96]\r\n\r\nTo all intents and purposes this act differed but little from the first\r\nvetoed bill. It continued the original Freedmen's Bureau Act in force for\r\ntwo years, and contained certain additional provisions for the education\r\nof the freedmen, for the recognition of their civil rights, and for the\r\nprotection of such rights by military power.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson, in his veto message, declared that a careful\r\nexamination had convinced him that the same reasons assigned in his veto\r\nof February 19, applied also to this measure. Such legislation was\r\njustifiable only under the war power, and should not extend to times of\r\npeace. The now existing federal and state courts, he went on to say, were\r\namply sufficient for the protection of the freedmen, and the existence of\r\nthe prevalent disorders furnished no necessity for the extension of the\r\nbureau system. The practical operation of the bureau showed that it was\r\nbecoming an instrument of fraud, corruption and oppression, while the\r\ncivil rights bill, needless as it was, provided methods of protection far\r\npreferable to the military protection authorized by this bill. The\r\nlegislation regarding the disposal of land was discriminating, unsafe, and\r\nunconstitutional, and in conclusion he urged upon Congress the dangers of\r\nclass legislation.\r\n\r\n5. The mere veto of the first Freedmen's Bureau bill would not have been\r\nof great significance had it been the only act of the President at this\r\ntime offensive to the rank and file of the Republican party. But on two\r\nother occasions he acted very indiscreetly, February 7 and February 22,\r\nthe latter coming so shortly after the veto message on the first bill that\r\nthe antagonism of Congress was greatly intensified.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 1866, a delegation of colored representatives from fifteen\r\nStates and the District of Columbia called upon President Johnson in order\r\nto present their wishes concerning the granting of suffrage to their race.\r\nGeo. T. Downing and Frederick Douglass acted as spokesmen. In reply,\r\nPresident Johnson described his sacrifices for the colored man, and went\r\non to express his indignation at being arraigned by incompetent persons.\r\nAlthough he was willing to be the colored man's Moses, he was not willing\r\n\"to adopt a policy which he believed would only result in the sacrifice of\r\nhis [the colored man's] life and the shedding of his blood.\" The war was\r\nnot waged for the suppression of slavery; \"the abolition of slavery has\r\ncome as an incident to the suppression of a great rebellion--as an\r\nincident, and as an incident we should give it the proper direction.\" He\r\nwent on to state that the negro was unprepared for the ballot, and that\r\nthere was a danger of a race war. The States must decide for themselves on\r\nthe question of the franchise. \"Each community is better prepared to\r\ndetermine the depository of its political power than anybody else, and it\r\nis for the legislature * * * to say who shall vote, and not for the\r\nCongress of the United States.\"[97]\r\n\r\nThis plain statement of his opposition to negro suffrage greatly added to\r\nJohnson's unpopularity. This was not due to the fact that his views on\r\nthat subject had not been made public before, for he never had tried to\r\nconceal his attitude towards any of the questions before the people. But\r\nthe attitude of the people themselves had greatly changed since the ill\r\ntreatment of the freedmen and the objectionable legislation of the\r\nSouthern States had been placed vividly before the public through the\r\nnewspapers. The sentiment in favor of the extension of the franchise had\r\nrapidly gained strength; and the attitude of the President, made\r\nconspicuous anew by his almost harsh reply to so prominent a delegation\r\nrepresenting such a wide extent of territory, called forth much hostile\r\ncriticism, which, added to the vigorous letter published by the delegation\r\nin reply to the President, aided in unifying the opposition to him.\r\n\r\nOn February 22 he made a speech in which he not only attacked by name\r\ncertain leading politicians, but also criticised in terms the legislative\r\nbranch of the government. This speech marks a distinct epoch in the\r\nhistory of the struggle between the President and Congress. Prior to it,\r\nthe latter, although conscious of the rapid divergence of the paths each\r\nwas following, and determined to render as nugatory as possible the\r\nPresident's policy, had not permitted the feeling of personal antagonism\r\nto influence its actions to any great extent. But from this time forth the\r\nlines were sharply drawn, culminating in the impeachment. Johnson bitterly\r\nhated the Joint Committee on Reconstruction. The very manner in which it\r\nhad been authorized--through a concurrent resolution instead of a joint\r\nresolution for the purpose of preventing executive action--had embittered\r\nhim; the principles which its majority represented and the _personnel_ of\r\nthe committee were equally distasteful to him.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the speech of February 22, it should be noticed that\r\nMr. Stevens had two days before introduced a concurrent resolution, which\r\npassed the House, providing that no senators or representatives were to\r\nbe admitted until Congress should declare the State entitled to\r\nrepresentation. Such a provision, the practical effect of which would be\r\nto place the subject in the exclusive control of the Joint Committee on\r\nReconstruction, Congress, as we have seen, struck out of the resolution\r\nauthorizing that committee's appointment.[98] The President had good\r\nreason to believe that Mr. Stevens' resolution would pass the Senate, as\r\nit did on the 2d of March, and he looked upon it as one more step in the\r\nusurpation of power by an \"irresponsible directory.\" Sensitive to all\r\ntendencies towards centralization, he saw in the power granted to the\r\ncommittee, and the measures proposed by it, a tendency towards the\r\nconditions against which he had spoken on April 21, 1865, when he said:\r\n\"While I have opposed dissolution and disintegration on the one hand, on\r\nthe other I am equally opposed to consolidation, or the centralization of\r\npower in the hands of a few.\"\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment in Washington was very hostile to the Freedmen's Bureau,\r\nand on February 22 a mass-meeting was held to express popular approval of\r\nthe action of the President in vetoing the bill. Adjourning to the White\r\nHouse, the crowd congratulated Johnson with tumultuous enthusiasm. A man\r\nmore cautious would have limited his reply to a temperate expression of\r\nhis views; but Johnson, ever eager to pose as the leader of the people,\r\nwas led by the enthusiasm of the moment to abandon himself entirely to his\r\nprejudices, aggravated as they were by the circumstances above mentioned.\r\nThus, on the anniversary of Washington's birthday, a day when he should\r\nhave particularly refrained from partisan politics, he took occasion to\r\nassail the committee violently, declaring that the end of one rebellion\r\nwas witnessing the beginning of a new rebellion; saying that \"there is an\r\nattempt now to concentrate all power in the hands of a few at the federal\r\nhead, and thereby bring about a consolidation of the Republic, which is\r\nequally objectionable with its dissolution. * * * The substance of your\r\ngovernment may be taken away, while there is held out to you the form and\r\nthe shadow.\" He described the Joint Committee as an \"irresponsible central\r\ndirectory,\" which had assumed \"nearly all the powers of Congress,\" without\r\n\"even consulting the legislative and executive departments of the\r\nGovernment. * * * Suppose I should name to you those whom I look upon as\r\nbeing opposed to the fundamental principles of this Government, and as\r\nlaboring to destroy them. I say Thaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania; I say\r\nCharles Sumner, of Massachusetts; I say Wendell Phillips, of\r\nMassachusetts.\"[99]\r\n\r\n6. After the President had thus publicly stigmatized the opponents of his\r\npolicy as instigators of a new rebellion, and classed Stevens, Sumner and\r\nWendell Phillips as traitors to be compared with Davis, there could be no\r\nhope of reconciliation, and the Republican party grimly settled down to\r\nfight for its principles. The first important measure to take effect was\r\nthe civil rights bill.[100]\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the session Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, had\r\nintroduced a bill looking to the personal protection of the freedmen. It\r\nwas aimed directly at the \"black laws\" of the Southern States, and\r\ndeclared all laws, statutes, acts, etc., of any description whatsoever,\r\nwhich caused any inequality of civil rights, in consequence of race or\r\ncolor, to be void. In his speech of December 13, 1865, explaining his\r\nreasons for introducing the bill, Wilson said that, while honest\r\ndifferences as to the expediency of negro suffrage might exist, he could\r\nnot comprehend \"how any humane, just and Christian man can, for a moment,\r\npermit the laws that are on the statute-books of the States in rebellion,\r\nand the laws that are now pending before their legislatures, to be\r\nexecuted upon men whom we have declared to be free. * * * To turn these\r\nfreedmen over to the tender mercies of men who hate them for their\r\nfidelity to the country is a crime that will bring the judgment of heaven\r\nupon us.\"[101]\r\n\r\nThis bill and a similar bill introduced by the same senator on December\r\n21, and one introduced by Senator Sumner on the first day of the session,\r\nnever came to a vote, the last two being postponed indefinitely by the\r\nSenate. In place of these bills, Senator Trumbull of Illinois, chairman of\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary, on January 5, 1866, introduced a bill\r\nwhich, slightly amended, became a law. This measure passed the Senate on\r\nFebruary 2, was amended and passed by the House on March 13, and the\r\namendments were concurred in by the Senate on the 15th. It was returned to\r\nthe Senate by the President, without his approval, March 27, and on April\r\n6 the Senate passed the bill over the veto of the President by a vote of\r\n33 to 15. Three days later the House passed the bill by a vote of 122 to\r\n41, and the measure became a law.\r\n\r\nAs passed it was entitled, \"An Act to protect all persons in the United\r\nStates in their civil rights, and furnish the means of their vindication.\"\r\nIt first declared \"all persons born in the United States, and not subject\r\nto any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed,\" to be citizens of the\r\nUnited States. Such citizens, without regard to race, color, or previous\r\nservitude, were declared to have the same rights in all the States and\r\nTerritories, as white citizens, to make and enforce contracts; to \"sue,\r\nbe parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold,\r\nand convey real and personal property;\" to enjoy the equal benefit of all\r\nlaws for the security of person and property, and to be subject only to\r\nthe same punishments. The second section provided penalties for the\r\ndeprivation of equal rights. The third gave to the United States courts\r\nexclusive cognizance of all causes involving the denial of the rights\r\nsecured by the first section. The remaining sections specified the powers\r\nand duties of the district attorneys, marshals, deputy marshals and\r\nspecial commissioners, in connection with the enforcement of the act, the\r\nninth section providing: \"It shall be lawful for the President of the\r\nUnited States, or such person as he may empower for that purpose, to\r\nemploy such part of the land or naval forces of the United States, or of\r\nthe militia, as shall be necessary to prevent the violation and enforce\r\nthe due execution of the Act.\"[102]\r\n\r\nFrom this summary of the act its nature can be seen plainly. Up to this\r\ntime there had been no legislation affecting the _status_ of the freedman.\r\nThis declared him to be a citizen of the United States, and thereby\r\nentitled to all the privileges of citizenship. The war having resulted in\r\nthe anomalous condition of the several millions of freedmen, some such\r\nlegislation was necessary, especially in view of the fact that\r\ndiscriminative legislation was being enacted in the South. The bill was\r\nmoderate in its terms, the most questionable portion being the section\r\nempowering the President to enforce the act through the war department,\r\nbut even that in the then unsettled condition of the country had much to\r\njustify it.\r\n\r\nThe President's veto message was a lengthy document and discussed in\r\ndetail the significance of the bill.[103] He questioned the policy of\r\nconferring citizenship on four million blacks while eleven of the States\r\nwere unrepresented in Congress. He doubted whether the negroes possessed\r\nthe qualifications for citizenship, and thought that their proper\r\nprotection did not require that they be made citizens, as civil rights\r\nwere secured to them as they were, while the bill discriminated against\r\nthe intelligent foreigner. Naturally, he also declared that the securing\r\nby federal law of equality of the races was an infringement upon state\r\njurisdiction. \"Hitherto, every subject embraced in the enumeration of\r\nrights contained in this bill has been considered as exclusively belonging\r\nto the States.\" The second section he thought to be of doubtful\r\nconstitutionality and unnecessary, \"as adequate judicial remedies could be\r\nadopted to secure the desired end, without invading the immunities of\r\nlegislators, * * * without assailing the independence of the judiciary, *\r\n* * and without impairing the efficiency of ministerial officers. * * *\r\nThe legislative department of the United States thus takes from the\r\njudicial department of the States the sacred and exclusive duty of\r\njudicial decision, and converts the State judge into a mere ministerial\r\nofficer bound to decide according to the will of Congress.\" The third\r\nsection he characterized as undoubtedly comprehending cases and\r\nauthorizing the \"exercise of powers that are not by the Constitution\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.\" He also\r\nconsidered the extraordinary powers of the numerous officials created by\r\nthe act as jeopardizing the liberties of the people, and the provisions in\r\nregard to fees as liable to bring about persecution and fraud.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these objections he argued that the bill frustrated the\r\nnatural adjustment between capital and labor in a way potent to cause\r\ndiscord. It was \"an absorption and assumption of power by the General\r\nGovernment which, if acquiesced in, must sap and destroy our federative\r\nsystem of limited powers, and break down the barriers which preserve the\r\nrights of the States. * * * The tendency of the bill must be to\r\nresuscitate the spirit of rebellion, and to arrest the progress of those\r\ninfluences which are more closely drawing around the States the bonds of\r\nunion and peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe next clash between the executive and legislative branches of the\r\ngovernment was over the Colorado bill.[104] This bill provided for the\r\nadmission of Colorado into the Union, and was passed May 3, being vetoed\r\nby the President on May 15, in accordance with the policy which he was\r\nendeavoring to carry out.[105] The nominal grounds, while strong in\r\nthemselves, had less weight in Johnson's mind than the argument reserved\r\nfor the final sentence of the message. This referred to the fact that\r\neleven of the old States were unrepresented in Congress, and that it was\r\nin the \"common interest of all the States, as well those represented as\r\nthose unrepresented, that the integrity and harmony of the Union should be\r\nrestored as completely as possible, so that all those who are expected to\r\nbear the burdens of the Federal Government shall be consulted concerning\r\nthe admission of new States; and that in the mean time no new State shall\r\nbe prematurely and unnecessarily admitted to a participation in the\r\npolitical power which the Federal Government wields.\" A second bill for\r\nthe admission of Colorado was vetoed on January 29, 1867.[106] In the\r\nmessage President Johnson stated that he could change none of his\r\nopinions expressed in the first veto, while he now saw many additional\r\nobjections. Neither bill was passed over the veto.\r\n\r\nAnother measure of like nature was the Nebraska bill, which was passed on\r\nJuly 27, the last day but one of the session. The President \"pocketed\" it.\r\nBoth bills were again introduced at the beginning of the second session by\r\nSenator Wade, and the Nebraska bill was duly passed. It was vetoed January\r\n30, 1867, but within ten days was passed over the veto by both houses,\r\nNebraska being able to present stronger arguments for receiving statehood\r\nthan Colorado, and consequently obtaining more support from the\r\nconservative members of the Republican party. The principal objection\r\nexpressed in the veto message was the incongruities existing in the bill,\r\nthe first section admitting the State \"upon an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States in all respects whatsoever,\" and the third section\r\nproviding that \"there shall be no denial of the elective franchise, or of\r\nany other right, to any person by reason of race or color, except Indians\r\nnot taxed.\" This assertion of the right of Congress to regulate the\r\nelective franchise the President declared clearly unconstitutional,\r\nincompatible with an equal footing with the original States.[107]\r\n\r\n7. The central event, naturally, of the first session of the 39th Congress\r\nwas the report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction. Although during\r\nthe session there was a great amount of discussion as to the theory and\r\nmethod of reconstruction, and, as has been shown, two important measures\r\nwere passed over the President's veto, the majority in the House still\r\nfelt uncommitted as to the policy they should favor, excepting so far as\r\nthe measures already reported from the committee had given shape to their\r\nplans. A definite platform had not been erected on which they could stand,\r\nand they were not certain of the foundations on which to base constructive\r\nlegislation. It was quite evident from the resolutions and bills reported\r\nfrom the committee to Congress, that the testimony taken before it had not\r\nchanged the views of the majority of the committee, and the general tenor\r\nof the report was not a surprise to any one. Its constitutional importance\r\ncannot be questioned, since the Republican party adopted its construction\r\nof the Constitution, and proceeded to frame, on the lines marked out by\r\nthe report, the bills which changed decidedly the relations between the\r\nStates and the Federal Government, affording precedents for an extension\r\nof federal power which previous to the close of the war few could have\r\nbeen found to support.[108]\r\n\r\nNo theory as to the _status_ of the Southern States was agreed on by the\r\ncommittee.[109] Among those signing the majority report several distinct\r\nviews can be noted. The theory of Thaddeus Stevens, that the States were\r\nnow merely conquered territory, at the mercy of the conqueror, has already\r\nbeen noticed. Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, was one of those who\r\ntheoretically differed from Mr. Stevens, preferring to consider the States\r\nas \"dead States\" within the Union. Mr. Bingham, of Ohio, was still less\r\nradical, simply calling them \"disorganized States.\" But realizing the\r\nfutility of introducing distinctions which could not affect the main\r\nquestion at issue, the majority dropped \"the profitless abstraction,\" and\r\nagreed upon the general conclusions and recommendations. The report was\r\nfinally presented to Congress on June 18, all the members signing\r\nexcepting Johnson, Rogers and Grider, who submitted a minority report four\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the report is a general review of the steps which had\r\nalready been taken by the President, and of the powers of the executive\r\nand legislative departments. It was declared that at the close of the war\r\nthe Confederate States were in a condition of utter exhaustion and\r\ncomplete anarchy. Congress having failed to provide for the contingency,\r\nthe President had no power except to execute the national laws and\r\nestablish \"such a system of government as might be provided for by\r\nexisting national statutes.\" These States \"by withdrawing their\r\nrepresentatives in Congress, by renouncing the privilege of\r\nrepresentation, by organizing a separate government, and by levying war\r\nagainst the United States, destroyed their State constitutions in respect\r\nto the vital principle which connected their respective States with the\r\nUnion and secured their federal relations; and nothing of these\r\nconstitutions was left of which the United States were bound to take\r\nnotice.\" The President had two alternatives: either to \"assemble Congress\r\nand submit the whole matter to the law-making power,\" or to continue\r\nmilitary supervision in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the army,\r\nuntil the regular assembling. Choosing the latter course, he appointed\r\nover the revolted States provisional governors who possessed military\r\nauthority, but who \"had no power to organize civil governments nor to\r\nexercise any authority except that which inhered in their own persons\r\nunder their commissions.\" The President in his military capacity might\r\nproperly permit the people to form local governments, execute local laws\r\nnot inconsistent with national laws, and even withdraw military forces\r\naltogether if he deemed it safe. But to Congress, not to the President,\r\nbelonged the power \"to decide upon the nature or effect of any system of\r\ngovernment which the people of these States might see fit to adopt,\" and\r\nto fix terms by which the States might be restored to all their rights and\r\nprivileges as States of the Union. \"The loss of representation by the\r\npeople of the insurrectionary States was their own voluntary choice. They\r\nmight abandon their privileges, but they could not escape their\r\nobligations,\" and they could not complain.\r\n\r\nNone of the revolted States, the report continued, excepting perhaps\r\nTennessee, were in a condition to resume their former political relations.\r\nTheir so-called \"amended constitutions\" had never been submitted to the\r\npeople for adoption, and when they were thus submitted there was nothing\r\nto prevent their repudiation. If these States were without state\r\ngovernments, they should be regularly organized, but in no case had the\r\nproper preliminary steps been taken. The conventions assumed that the old\r\nconstitutions were still in force, and that only such amendments as the\r\nfederal government required, were needed. \"In no instance was regard paid\r\nto any other consideration than obtaining immediate admission to Congress,\r\nunder the barren form of an election in which no precautions were taken to\r\nsecure regularity of proceedings or the consent of the people.\" Before\r\nthey were restored to their full rights \"they should exhibit in their acts\r\nsomething more than unwilling submission to an unavoidable necessity.\"\r\nGreat stress was laid upon the headstrong action of the States since\r\nJohnson's proclamation of amnesty: the character of the men elevated to\r\nthe highest positions; the discriminating legislation; the arrogance of\r\nthe Southern press, and the opposition to the Freedmen's Bureau. The\r\ntestimony of witnesses as to the general disposition to repudiate the\r\nnational debt, if such a thing should prove possible, and as to the\r\nnatural reluctance to pay taxes, were perhaps too seriously taken, as was\r\nalso the \"proof of a condition of feeling hostile to the Union and\r\ndangerous to the government.\"\r\n\r\nBut, whether acting on exaggerated estimates or not, the majority of the\r\ncommittee formulated their conclusions into three clauses, which were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. \"That the States lately in rebellion were at the close of the war\r\ndisorganized communities, without civil government, and without\r\nconstitutions or other forms by virtue of which political relations could\r\nlegally exist between them and the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n2. \"That Congress cannot be expected to recognize as valid the election of\r\nrepresentatives from disorganized communities, which, from the very nature\r\nof the case, were unable to present their claim to representation under\r\nthose established and recognized rules, the observance of which has been\r\nhitherto required.\r\n\r\n3. \"That Congress would not be justified in admitting such communities to\r\na participation in the government of the country without first providing\r\nsuch constitutional or other guaranties as will tend to secure the civil\r\nrights of all citizens of the Republic; a just equality of representation;\r\nprotection against claims founded in rebellion and crime; a temporary\r\nrestoration of the right of suffrage to those who have not actively\r\nparticipated in the efforts to destroy the Union and overthrow the\r\ngovernment; and the exclusion from positions of public trust of at least a\r\nportion of those whose crimes have proved them to be enemies to the Union,\r\nand unworthy of public confidence.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, the report contained an enumerated statement of \"general\r\nfacts and principles\" which it was claimed were \"applicable to all the\r\nStates recently in rebellion.\" In this statement it was asserted that from\r\nthe time war was declared the great majority of the Southerners \"became\r\nand were insurgents, rebels, traitors; and all of them assumed the\r\npolitical, legal, and practical relation of enemies of the United States.\"\r\nThe States did not desist from war till \"every vestige of State and\r\nConfederate government\" was obliterated, \"their people reduced to the\r\ncondition of enemies conquered in war, entitled only by public law to such\r\nrights, privileges and conditions as might be vouchsafed by the\r\nconqueror.\" They thus had \"no right to complain of temporary exclusion\r\nfrom Congress,\" until they could \"show that they are qualified to resume\r\nfederal relations. * * * They must prove that they have established _with\r\nthe consent of the people_, republican forms of government in harmony with\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, that all hostile purposes\r\nhave ceased, and should give adequate guaranties against future treason\r\nand rebellion--guaranties which shall prove satisfactory to the Government\r\nagainst which they rebelled, and by whose arms they were subdued.\" The\r\nrebels \"were conquered by the people of the United States acting through\r\nall the co-ordinate branches of the Government, and not by the Executive\r\nalone. * * * The authority to restore rebels to political power in the\r\nFederal Government can be exercised only with the concurrence of all the\r\ndepartments in which political power is vested,\" and the proclamations of\r\nthe President could only be regarded as provisional permission \"to do\r\ncertain acts, the effect and validity whereof is to be determined by the\r\nconstitutional government, and not solely by the executive power.\" If the\r\nPresident had the power to \"qualify persons to appoint Senators and elect\r\nRepresentatives, and empower others to appoint and elect them, he thereby\r\npractically controls the organization of the legislative department and\r\ndestroys the constitutional form of government.\"[110]\r\n\r\nThe report of the dissenting members of the committee, Messrs. Johnson,\r\nRogers and Grider, was an ably prepared document embodying at length the\r\ndoctrines of the minority in Congress, composed of the Democrats and the\r\nfew Republicans who still sustained the President. As a matter of course\r\nthe argument was built upon the premise that the so-called Confederate\r\nStates were never legally separated from the Union, but were bound by all\r\nthe obligations and entitled to all the privileges of other States. \"In\r\nits nature the government is formed of and by States possessing equal\r\nrights and powers.\" A State cannot be held to have forfeited its rights.\r\n\"To concede that by the illegal conduct of her own citizens she can be\r\nwithdrawn from the Union, is virtually to concede the right of secession.\"\r\n\r\nWere the States out of the Union, the minority continued, the submission\r\nto them of the proposed constitutional amendment would be absurd; and such\r\nsubmission virtually conceded that the condition of the States remained\r\nunchanged. The constitutional power to suppress insurrection is for the\r\npreservation, not the subjugation of the State. \"The continuance of the\r\nUnion of all the States is necessary to the intended existence of the\r\nGovernment,\" and a different principle leads to disintegration. The war\r\npower, as such, cannot be used to extinguish the States; the Government\r\nonly seeks to suppress the insurrection, achieving which all the States\r\nresume their normal relations. The States now have organized governments,\r\nrepublican in form, and the manner in which they were formed is no concern\r\nof Congress. \"Congress may admit new States, but a State once admitted\r\nceases to be within its control and can never again be brought within it.\"\r\nThere is nothing in the political condition of these States justifying\r\ntheir exclusion from representation in Congress. The proposed amendment\r\nwould degrade the Southern States, as it would compel them to accept\r\neither a lessened representation or negro suffrage. Further, it interfered\r\nwith the right of every State to regulate the franchise; and, by joining\r\nseveral subjects and requiring them to be voted on as a whole, deprived\r\nthe people of the opportunity of passing on this important question\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n8. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction had already reported two bills\r\nand one joint resolution which in its report of June 18 were declared to\r\nbe the fruit of its labors. These were introduced in the House by Mr.\r\nStevens, April 30. The resolution proposed an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, which, as finally amended, became the 14th Amendment.[111]\r\nThe two accompanying bills were entitled respectively: (1) \"A Bill to\r\nprovide for restoring the States lately in insurrection to their full\r\npolitical rights.\" (2) \"A Bill declaring certain persons ineligible to\r\noffice under the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these bills prescribed the conditions on which a State lately\r\nin insurrection might secure representation in Congress, as well as a ten\r\nyears' postponement of the exaction of any unpaid part of the direct tax\r\nof 1861. It provided that representation might be secured after the\r\nproposed amendment should have become a part of the Constitution, and the\r\nState seeking representation should have ratified such amendment.\r\nPostponement of the tax might be secured by ratifying the amendment. This\r\nbill served as a basis for general discussion of the best method of\r\nrestoring to the States their political rights; but, no action was taken\r\non it during this session, and it went over as unfinished business to the\r\nfollowing December.\r\n\r\nThe second bill declared as ineligible to office: the President,\r\nVice-President, and foreign agents of the Confederate States; \"heads of\r\ndepartments of the United States, officers of the army and navy of the\r\nUnited States, and all persons educated at the Military or Naval Academy\r\nof the United States,\" federal judges and members of the 36th Congress,\r\nwho had given aid or comfort to the rebellion; Confederate officers above\r\nthe rank of colonel in the army or master in the navy; governors of the\r\nConfederate States, and \"those who have treated officers or soldiers or\r\nsailors of the army or navy of the United States, captured during the late\r\nwar, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war.\" This bill was less\r\nfortunate than the first, since it failed even to receive consideration\r\nduring the session.\r\n\r\nThe proposed constitutional amendment, however, fared better. It had been\r\nwell demonstrated by the discussions during the session that an amendment\r\nto the Constitution would be submitted to the States, if a resolution\r\ncould be framed which would satisfy the heterogeneous elements of the\r\nreconstruction party. But the framing of such a resolution had proved a\r\nvery difficult matter. Stevens, and those most influenced by him, were\r\nespecially radical in their doctrines, not hesitating to express their\r\ndesire for the confiscation of rebels' property and for other extreme\r\nmeasures. Some believed that there should be nothing short of complete\r\ndisfranchisement, for a term of years, of all who had aided the rebellion\r\nin any way--they had acted deliberately, and they must suffer the\r\nconsequences. Others cared only for the disfranchisement of the more\r\nprominent offenders, and for the establishment of negro suffrage. Still\r\nanother faction wished liberal terms to be offered to the\r\nStates--limitations, but no interference.\r\n\r\nThe radicals recognized that their extreme ideas could not obtain\r\ncongressional sanction, and made no effort to embody them in the plans\r\nsubmitted. From the beginning of the session various propositions were\r\nunder discussion. Among these, the most attention was attracted by the\r\nvarious propositions to modify the existing basis of apportionment of\r\nrepresentatives in Congress. Emancipation had rendered this necessary. The\r\n\"three-fifths clause\" of the Constitution having become inoperative, the\r\nincreased representation resulting from the freeing of the slaves\r\nnecessitated a change. The first plan was \"to apportion Representatives\r\naccording to the number of voters in the several States.\"[112] It was then\r\nproposed to exclude from the basis of representation all whose political\r\nrights were denied or abridged by any State on account of race or color.\r\nThis plan, supported by Blaine and Conkling,[113] passed the House on\r\nJanuary 31, 1866,[114] but was defeated in the Senate. Many felt that the\r\nmeasure was too stringent. The object was virtually to force upon the\r\nSouthern States the enfranchisement of the negro.[115]\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Reconstruction hesitated for over a month after the\r\ndefeat of this resolution in the Senate. It was finally decided that the\r\nonly way in which the submission of the desired amendment could be\r\neffected, was to concede something to the conservative element of the\r\nSenate. Accordingly the draft of April 30 was presented as the\r\nrecommendation of the committee. This passed the House without\r\ndifficulty,[116] but encountered fierce opposition in the Senate. The\r\nHouse resolution contained a provision which would have summarily and\r\nunconditionally excluded from the franchise all participating in the\r\nrebellion, until July 4, 1870. This was virtually a complete\r\ndisfranchisement of the Southern people, and although only temporary, it\r\nwas felt to be contrary to the spirit of our institutions and too\r\nindiscriminate a punishment. It was accordingly stricken out by a\r\nunanimous vote.[117] In its place Senator Howard proposed a clause which\r\nforms section 3 of the 14th Amendment as it now stands. This clause, while\r\nit withheld certain privileges of citizenship from participants in the\r\nrebellion who had previously held civil or military office and had taken\r\nan oath to support the Constitution of the United States, did not affect\r\nthe vast majority of Southerners; and it provided that Congress might, by\r\na two-thirds vote of each house, remove the disability of those who were\r\nexcepted from the restoration of privileges. Moreover, in place of the\r\nplan supported by Blaine and Conkling for reducing the basis of\r\nrepresentation, the Committee on Reconstruction presented a proposition\r\nwhich better satisfied the conservative element, and which stands to-day\r\nas section 2 of the 14th Amendment. It provided that in case the right of\r\nany male inhabitant of a State to vote was denied or abridged for any\r\nreason \"except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of\r\nrepresentation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number\r\nof such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens\r\ntwenty-one years of age in such state.\" It was argued that in this way\r\nfairness was assured, as a State could have no right to claim\r\nrepresentation for that portion of her population which was denied the\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 1866, the final touches were put on the resolution. Five days\r\nlater the House concurred in the Senate's revision, and the 14th Amendment\r\nwas ready for the ratification of the States.\r\n\r\nJohnson's followers and the Democrats bitterly opposed the submission of\r\nthis amendment. The more extreme of them asserted that the Republican\r\nmajority acted from purely partisan motives. Fearful for the continuance\r\nof its supremacy, it desired to place before the States a measure so\r\ndistasteful to the South as to ensure its rejection. In that way there\r\nwould be an excuse for additional legislation to prevent the States from\r\nobtaining representation, and to preserve Republican control.[118] The\r\ncomposite character of the amendment provoked severe criticism. It was\r\nclaimed that the sections should be submitted to the States as separate\r\narticles, to give opportunity for the rejection of some and the\r\nratification of others. Senator Doolittle moved an amendment to this\r\neffect,[119] but the solid reconstruction majority could not be shaken,\r\nand the five sections were submitted to the States to stand or fall\r\ntogether. Technical objections were deemed unworthy of consideration when\r\nit was supposed to be necessary for the safety of the Union that all the\r\nsections should be ratified.\r\n\r\nThe inadvisability of submitting a constitutional amendment while eleven\r\nof the States were not permitted a voice in legislation was strongly urged\r\nby the opposition. The President reiterated the protest in his message of\r\nJune 22, affirming that the submission of the proposed amendment to the\r\nStates through the executive department was a purely ministerial duty, in\r\nno way committing the department to an approval of the action. The first\r\nsection of the amendment was condemned as a subtle plan eventually to\r\nforce negro suffrage upon the people as an incident of negro citizenship.\r\nIt was claimed that the second discriminated too severely against the\r\nSouthern States with their large preponderance of colored population, and\r\nthat the third virtually forced them to insult their most respected\r\ncitizens--a humiliation which would drive them to renewed insurrection.\r\nThe validity of some of the objections was proved by subsequent history;\r\nsome have proved groundless; others still remain among the unsettled\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction legislation of the first session of the 39th Congress\r\nclosed with the restoration of Tennessee to the Union. Other measures were\r\nunder consideration, but were not acted upon until the following session.\r\nThe attitude of Tennessee, since her re-organization under the provisions\r\nof the proclamation of 1863, had been the most consistent of any of the\r\nSouthern States.[120] From March 3, 1862, until March 3, 1865, Johnson, as\r\nmilitary governor, had preserved law and order to a great extent. The\r\nformal reorganization of the State was undertaken by a convention of the\r\nloyal citizens convened January 8, 1865, acting upon the recommendation\r\nand personal approval of Johnson. This convention proposed the amendments\r\nto the constitution of the State, made necessary by the changes brought\r\nabout by the war, and they were adopted by the loyal voters of the State\r\non February 22. On March 4 a governor and legislature were elected, who\r\nassumed their duties on April 3. The work of the legislature was\r\ncharacterized by an apparent eagerness to do all that should be done by a\r\nState loyal to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe popular ratification of the amendments to the Constitution\r\ndistinguished the action of Tennessee from that of the other Southern\r\nStates, and this fact, united to her uniformly consistent attitude, formed\r\nthe ground for the recommendation of the Committee on Reconstruction that\r\nthis State should be restored to her former rights and privileges. This\r\nrecommendation, in the form of a joint resolution, was reported from the\r\ncommittee by Mr. Bingham on March 5,[121] but no action was taken until\r\nJuly 20. Tennessee's prompt action in ratifying the 14th Amendment[122]\r\nwas taken as good evidence that her government was thoroughly\r\nreconstructed, and the State entitled to representation. Accordingly a\r\nsubstitute resolution, noting these facts, was introduced and passed, the\r\nSenate amending and passing it three days later. This declared Tennessee\r\nto be restored to her former relations to the Union, and entitled to\r\nrepresentation in Congress,[123] but the preamble was used as a vehicle\r\nfor the assertion of the sole power of Congress to restore State\r\ngovernments. President Johnson, while approving the resolution, explained\r\nin his message that his approval was \"not to be construed as an\r\nacknowledgment of the right of Congress to pass laws preliminary to the\r\nadmission of duly qualified representatives from any of the States,\" nor\r\nas committing him \"to all the statements made in the preamble.\"\r\n\r\nThe session had proved far from fruitless, although nothing but the\r\npreliminary steps had been taken. The Freedmen's Bureau and civil rights\r\nbills constituted a temporary protection to the freedmen; the right of\r\n_habeas corpus_ still remained suspended and military authority prevailed\r\nthroughout the conquered region. The 14th Amendment was before the people,\r\nto be a rallying point for the autumn campaign. The lines between the\r\npresidential and congressional parties were now closely drawn. Each knew\r\nthe strong and the weak points of its opponent. The issue must now be\r\nturned over to the people as final judges of its merits. The congressional\r\nelections of the fall would decide the issue, and also the future method\r\nof reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The four months following the adjournment of the first session of the\r\n39th Congress were full of excitement. The public was thoroughly aroused,\r\nand all incidents were considered in the light they threw upon the\r\nquestion of the hour. The President's uncompromising hostility to the 14th\r\nAmendment brought about a crisis in the Cabinet.[124] William Dennison,\r\nPostmaster-General, was the first to declare the impossibility of\r\nmaintaining cabinet relations with the President. He resigned on July 11,\r\nand A. W. Randall, of Wisconsin, First Assistant Postmaster-General, was\r\nappointed in his place. Mr. Randall was a devoted adherent of the\r\nadministration, and president of the National Union Club which called the\r\nconvention of August 14. The second resignation was that of James Speed,\r\nAttorney-General, on July 18. Coming from Kentucky, Mr. Speed had had the\r\nreputation of being quite conservative in his views regarding\r\nreconstruction, and his formal notice of separation from the President\r\ncreated no little excitement. His intimate connection with the\r\nadministration gave unusual force to his denunciation of its policy, made\r\nat the time of taking the chair as permanent president of the convention\r\nof Southern loyalists. Henry Stanbery of Ohio was appointed as his\r\nsuccessor, and retained his position until he resigned to assist in the\r\ndefense of the President in the impeachment trial. A few days after Mr.\r\nSpeed's withdrawal, the Secretary of the Interior, James Harlan, tendered\r\nhis resignation, and O. H. Browning, of Illinois, was appointed to fill\r\nthe vacancy.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether probable that these resignations would have been made\r\nearlier than they were, had it not been feared that the control of these\r\nimportant administrative departments would fall into the hands of those\r\nwho would use their powers in opposition to Congress. But the time had\r\ncome when the incumbents considered that by the retention of the offices\r\nthey were being forced to share the odium attached to the President, and\r\ndeemed total separation from him as the best method of justification.\r\n\r\nThe laws discriminating against the colored man, and the numerous\r\ninstances of cruelty which had been reported to the North, were an\r\nimportant factor in creating and sustaining the common feeling of\r\nhostility to the administration. But the New Orleans riots, occurring on\r\nJuly 30, did more to rouse the people of the North, and convince them that\r\nstern measures were necessary, than all that had preceded. The massacre\r\nstood out vividly against the background of \"black laws,\" and furnished an\r\nargument of the most effective kind to be used in the campaign.\r\n\r\n2. The riots were of a peculiarly exasperating character. The\r\nconstitutional convention of 1864, summoned by the proclamation of Major\r\nGeneral Banks, had passed resolutions giving the president of the\r\nconvention power \"to reconvoke the convention for any cause.\" A majority\r\nof the members came to the conclusion, in the spring of 1866, that the\r\nState constitution should be amended, to place it in harmony with the\r\ncongressional policy.[125] They determined to have the convention\r\nreconvoked for this purpose. The president, Judge E. H. Durell, declined\r\nto take advantage of his prerogative, but the delegates, not to be\r\nthwarted in this way, proceeded to elect a president _pro tem._ who was\r\nwilling to issue the desired proclamation. The governor of the State, J.\r\nM. Wells, concurred in this rather questionable procedure, and issued a\r\nproclamation for an election to fill existing vacancies.\r\n\r\nIt being well understood that negro suffrage was one of the ultimate\r\nobjects desired by the supporters of the proposed constitutional\r\nconvention, active hostility to the movement rapidly developed. The\r\nproclamation of the president _pro tem._ called for the assembling of the\r\ndelegates on July 30; and though the only object of this meeting was to\r\ndetermine officially the existing vacancies to be filled in the fall\r\nelections, the enemies to the enfranchisement of the freedmen determined\r\nto crush the movement in its incipient stage. It is an easy matter to stir\r\nup the passions and prejudices of the people, and the indiscreet speeches\r\nof certain of the delegates only added to the popular excitement. A negro\r\nprocession organized in honor of the convention was attacked by a mob in\r\nfront of Mechanics' Hall, where the convention was in session. The attack\r\nwas soon extended to the hall itself, the police of the city joining hands\r\nwith the assailants. When the riot was over nearly two hundred persons\r\nwere found to have been killed or wounded, the greatest sufferers being\r\nthe negroes, who were shot down in front of the hall without mercy.\r\n\r\nThe flagrancy of the act, the connivance of the city authorities, and the\r\nfact that, while legal steps were taken against the delegates and innocent\r\nspectators, the actual murderers were in no way molested, furnished to the\r\npeople of the incensed North ample proof of the inability of the South to\r\nmaintain local government, and of the advisability of refusing to restore\r\nthese States to their former position in the Union. New Orleans was taken\r\nas a fair example of what might happen at any place in the South. There\r\nwas no satisfactory justification for these acts of violence, and there\r\nwas little inclination in the North to consider the legal technicalities\r\ninvolved in the attempt to amend the constitution of Louisiana. They\r\nsimply took cognizance of the fact that about fifty loyal citizens had\r\nbeen murdered in cold blood, with the city authorities silently\r\nacquiescing. In the face of such a fact, the solicitude of the President\r\nto preserve the \"inherent rights of the States\" did not appeal to the\r\nmasses, and Johnson was forced to begin his campaign badly handicapped.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to the blow given to the theory of the administration,\r\nJohnson was forced to labor against a certain amount of personal censure,\r\nbrought about by his supposed attitude before the riots and his known\r\nattitude after them. It was freely charged that he was in full sympathy\r\nwith the determination of the Mayor of New Orleans, and the\r\nLieutenant-Governor and Attorney-General of Louisiana, to prevent the\r\nconvention from accomplishing its plans. In support of the charge, his\r\nanswer to the inquiry as to whether the military power would interfere\r\nwith the attempt to arrest the members of the convention upon criminal\r\nprocess was cited. His reply was as follows:[126] \"The military will be\r\nexpected to sustain, and not to obstruct or interfere with the proceedings\r\nof the court.\" While this may have indicated too great confidence in the\r\ncivil authorities of Louisiana, it certainly did not imply any connivance\r\nin or sympathy with the summary proceeding of July 30. Possibly the\r\nwell-known opposition of Johnson to negro suffrage may have stimulated the\r\nrioters to bolder defiance of Northern sentiment, but censure of him can\r\nextend no farther. But, in his political canvass in the fall,[127] while\r\nendeavoring in every way to discredit the 39th Congress in the eyes of the\r\npeople, he committed a grave error by an indirect defense of the rioters,\r\nattacking the members of the convention as traitors who incited the negro\r\npopulation to rioting, and throwing the responsibility of the whole affair\r\nback upon Congress as having originated and fostered the plan to force\r\nnegro suffrage upon Louisiana.[128]\r\n\r\n3. The fall campaign was formally opened by the supporters of the\r\npresidential policy, who had immediately accepted the report of the\r\nCommittee on Reconstruction as the platform of the Republican\r\nanti-administration faction, and had determined to appeal on that issue to\r\nthe people. Their hope was that the conservative element of the\r\npopulation, thoroughly worn out by the struggle, would uphold the speedy\r\nrestoration of the Southern States, and that thereby a coalition might be\r\nmade between the Democrats and the administration Republicans strong\r\nenough to unseat many of the radical members, reverse the majority, and so\r\ngive the administration control in the 40th Congress.\r\n\r\nThe first steps were promptly taken. The executive committee of the\r\nNational Union Club, a political organization established in Washington by\r\nsupporters of the administration, issued on June 25, just one week after\r\nthe submission of the report of the Committee on Reconstruction, a call\r\nfor a national convention to be held in Philadelphia on August 14.[129]\r\nDelegates to this convention were to be chosen by those supporting the\r\nadministration and agreeing to certain \"fundamental propositions\" which\r\nformed the platform of the conservatives. These propositions maintained\r\nthe absolute indissolubility of the Union, the universal supremacy of the\r\nConstitution and acts of Congress in pursuance thereof, the constitutional\r\nguarantee to maintain the rights, dignity and equality of the States, and\r\nthe right of each State to prescribe the qualifications of electors,\r\nwithout any federal interference. They declared that the usurpation and\r\ncentralization of powers infringing upon the rights of the States \"would\r\nbe a revolution, dangerous to republican government, and destructive of\r\nliberty;\" that the exclusion of loyal senators and representatives,\r\nproperly chosen and qualified under the Constitution and laws, was unjust\r\nand revolutionary; that as the war was at an end, \"war measures should\r\nalso cease, and should be followed by measures of peaceful\r\nadministration;\" and that the restoration of the rights and privileges of\r\nthe States was necessary for the prosperity of the Union. This formal call\r\nwas approved, and its principles endorsed by the Democratic congressmen,\r\nwho issued an address to the \"People of the United States\" on July 4,\r\nurging them to act promptly in the selection of delegates to the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the call, every State and Territory was represented in\r\nthe convention. A glance at the list of delegates shows that they included\r\nmany of the prominent Democrats of the country, re-enforced by a number of\r\nthe prominent Republicans[130] who were in sympathy with the\r\nadministration. The enthusiastic manner in which the summons was answered\r\nseemed to the friends of the administration to indicate an unquestionable\r\noverthrow of the radicals. They thought that harmony was soon to reign\r\nover all portions of the Union, which was once more being drawn closely\r\ntogether by the watchword \"National Union.\"\r\n\r\nReverdy Johnson, who had submitted in the Senate the minority report of\r\nthe Committee on Reconstruction, was chosen chairman, and Senator Cowan,\r\nof Pennsylvania, chairman of the committee on resolutions. The resolutions\r\nwere reported on August 17, and unanimously adopted by the convention.\r\nThey re-affirmed the fundamental principles set forth in the call of June\r\n25, and appealed to the people of the United States to elect none to\r\nCongress but those who \"will receive to seats therein loyal\r\nrepresentatives from every State in allegiance to the United States.\" They\r\nreiterated the claim that in the ratification of constitutional amendments\r\nall the States \"have an equal and an indefeasible right to a voice and\r\nvote thereon.\" In concession to Northern sentiment, they declared that the\r\nSouth had no desire to re-establish slavery; that the civil rights of the\r\nfreedmen were to be respected, the rebel debt repudiated, the national\r\ndebt declared sacred and inviolable, and the duty of the government to\r\nrecognize the services of the federal soldiers and sailors admitted. A\r\nfinal resolution commended the President in the highest terms, as worthy\r\nof the nation, \"having faith unassailable in the people and in the\r\nprinciples of free government.\"[131]\r\n\r\nThese views were fully elaborated in an address prepared by Henry J.\r\nRaymond, and read before the convention. Little attempt was made to\r\nqualify or render less offensive the argument that the Southern States\r\nmust be allowed their representation in Congress, whether or not such\r\naction was for the best interest of the Union. Referring to this the\r\naddress declared that \"we have no right, for such reasons, to deny to any\r\nportion of the States or people rights expressly conferred upon them by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\" We should trust to the ability of\r\nour people \"to protect and defend, under all contingencies and by\r\nwhatever means may be required, its honor and welfare.\"[132]\r\n\r\nA committee of the convention hastened formally to present its proceedings\r\nto President Johnson, who had taken the keenest interest in the plans of\r\nthe National Union party. In his remarks to the committee he feelingly\r\nreferred to the somewhat theatrical entrance of the delegates of South\r\nCarolina and Massachusetts, \"arm in arm, marching into that vast\r\nassemblage, and thus giving evidence that the two extremes had come\r\ntogether again, and that for the future they were united, as they had been\r\nin the past, for the preservation of the Union.\" Speaking to a sympathetic\r\naudience, who applauded him to the echo, and believing that the people\r\nwere now endorsing his opposition to Congress, he saw no necessity for\r\ntempering his statements, and cast aside his discretion. His\r\ncharacterization of Congress was as follows: \"We have witnessed, in one\r\ndepartment of the government, every endeavor to prevent the restoration of\r\npeace, harmony and union. We have seen hanging upon the verge of the\r\nGovernment, as it were, a body called, or which assumes to be, the\r\nCongress of the United States, while in fact it is a Congress of only a\r\npart of the States. We have seen this Congress pretend to be for the\r\nUnion, when its every step and act tended to perpetuate disunion and make\r\na disruption of the States inevitable. Instead of promoting reconciliation\r\nand harmony, its legislation has partaken of the character of penalties,\r\nretaliation and revenge. This has been the course and policy of one\r\nportion of the Government.\"[133] Again, to show the disinterestedness of\r\nhis own course, he said: \"If I had wanted authority, or if I had wished to\r\nperpetuate my own power, how easily could I have held and wielded that\r\npower which was placed in my hands by the measure called the Freedmen's\r\nBureau bill (laughter and applause). With an army, which it placed at my\r\ndiscretion, I could have remained at the capital of the nation, and with\r\nfifty or sixty millions of appropriations at my disposal, with the\r\nmachinery to be unlocked by my own hands, with my satraps and dependents\r\nin every town and village, with the Civil Rights bill following as an\r\nauxiliary (laughter), and with the patronage and other appliances of the\r\nGovernment, I could have proclaimed myself dictator.\" (\"That's true!\" and\r\napplause.)[134]\r\n\r\nBut his indiscretions did not end with speeches before his sympathizers.\r\nTwo weeks later he started on a trip, nominally to assist in the ceremony\r\nof laying the cornerstone of the Douglas monument in Chicago.[135] As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, he was merely taking advantage of an opportunity\r\nto defend his policy publicly. Johnson was of too impassioned a nature to\r\nbe able to judge as to how far the President of the United States could\r\nafford to adopt the methods of the stump speaker. All constraint was\r\nthrown away, and he acted at many times the part most natural to him, that\r\nof a popular orator addressing the masses. His speeches at no time lacked\r\nclearness. All could see where he stood, and nothing was left for\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nHis first important effort while on his journey was at New York on August\r\n29, where he responded to a toast proposed by the mayor of the city. In\r\nthis speech he defined the issue as follows: \"The rebellion has been\r\nsuppressed, and in the suppression of the rebellion it [the government]\r\nhas * * * established the great fact that these States have not the power,\r\nand it denied their right, by forcible or peaceable means, to separate\r\nthemselves from the Union. (Cheers, 'Good!') That having been determined\r\nand settled by the Government of the United States in the field and in one\r\nof the departments of the government--the executive department of the\r\ngovernment--there is an open issue; there is another department of your\r\ngovernment which has declared by its official acts, and by the position of\r\nthe Government, notwithstanding the rebellion was suppressed for the\r\npurpose of preserving the Union of the States and establishing the\r\ndoctrine that the States could not secede, yet they have practically\r\nassumed and declared and carried up to the present point, that the\r\nGovernment was dissolved and the States were out of the Union. (Cheers.)\r\nWe who contended for the opposite doctrine years ago contended that even\r\nthe States had not the right to peaceably secede; and one of the means and\r\nmodes of possible secession was that the States of the Union might\r\nwithdraw their representatives from the Congress of the United States, and\r\nthat would be practical dissolution. We denied that they had any such\r\nright. (Cheers.) And now, when the doctrine is established that they have\r\nno right to withdraw, and the rebellion is at an end * * * we find that in\r\nviolation of the Constitution, in express terms as well as in spirit, that\r\nthese States of the Union have been and still are denied their\r\nrepresentation in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\"[136]\r\nThen, speaking of the people of the South: \"* * Do we want to humiliate\r\nthem and degrade them and drag them in the dust? ('No, no!' Cheers.) I say\r\nthis, and I repeat it here to-night, I do not want them to come back to\r\nthis Union a degraded and debased people. (Loud cheers.) They are not fit\r\nto be a part of this great American family if they are degraded and\r\ntreated with ignominy and contempt. I want them when they come back to\r\nbecome a part of this great country, an honored portion of the American\r\npeople.\"[137]\r\n\r\nAnother representative speech was the one which he made in Cleveland on\r\nSeptember 3: \"I tell you, my countrymen, I have been fighting the South,\r\nand they have been whipped and crushed, and they acknowledge their defeat\r\nand accept the terms of the Constitution; and now, as I go around the\r\ncircle, having fought traitors at the South, I am prepared to fight\r\ntraitors at the North. (Cheers.) God willing, with your help we will do\r\nit. (Cries of 'We won't.') It will be crushed North and South, and this\r\nglorious Union of ours will be preserved. (Cheers.) I do not come here as\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of twenty-five States out of thirty-six. (Cheers.) I\r\ncame here to-night with the flag of my country and the Constitution of\r\nthirty-six States untarnished. Are you for dividing this country? (Cries\r\nof 'No.') Then I am President, and I am President of the whole United\r\nStates. (Cheers.)\"[138]\r\n\r\nSpeeches of this nature, coming at a time when the outrages in the South\r\nhad so greatly incensed the North, had a most depressing influence upon\r\nthe fortunes of the National Union party, and failed utterly in the object\r\nfor which they were intended. The trip proved to be a grave political\r\nmistake. The undignified spectacle of a President receiving coarse\r\npersonal abuse and retorting in scarcely less coarse expressions was\r\nquickly taken advantage of by his opponents; and the phrase \"swinging\r\naround the circle\" has assumed historic dignity as a description of his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n4. The \"off year\" national convention plan adopted by the National Union\r\nClub was immediately accepted by the congressional party, which was no\r\nless active in preparations for the struggle. On July 4, the same day on\r\nwhich the Democratic congressmen issued their address to the people,\r\nrepresentative Southern Unionists,[139] supporters of Congress, issued a\r\ncall to \"the Loyal Unionists of the South,\" for a convention to be held in\r\nPhiladelphia on September 3.[140] The call stated that the convention was\r\n\"for the purpose of bringing the loyal Unionists of the South\" into\r\nconjunction with the true friends of republican government in the North.\r\n\"* * The time has come when the restructure of Southern State government\r\nmust be laid on constitutional principles. * * * We maintain that no\r\nState, either by its organic law or legislation, can make transgression on\r\nthe rights of the citizen legitimate. * * * Under the doctrine of 'State\r\nsovereignty,' with rebels in the foreground, controlling Southern\r\nlegislatures, and embittered by disappointment in their schemes to destroy\r\nthe Union, there will be no safety for the loyal element of the South. Our\r\nreliance for protection is now on Congress, and the great Union party that\r\nhas stood and is standing by our nationality, by the constitutional\r\nrights of the citizen, and by the beneficent principles of the\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention met at the time appointed, with representatives present\r\nfrom all the lately insurrectionary States.[141] James Speed of Kentucky,\r\nAttorney-General until July 18, was elected permanent chairman. For\r\npurposes of co-operation, the Northern States had been invited to send\r\ndelegations, and all responded. Thus the convention was as truly national\r\nas the \"National Union\" convention of August 14 had been. It was decided,\r\nhowever, that for the purpose of rendering the declaration of the Southern\r\nUnionists more significant, the Northern and Southern Unionists should\r\nhold their sessions separately, and Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania was\r\naccordingly elected chairman of the Northern section.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of the Southern section were reported by Governor Hamilton\r\nof Texas, chairman of the committee on resolutions, and they naturally\r\nendorsed the action of Congress in its entirety.[142] While demanding the\r\nrestoration of the States, they declared Johnson's policy to be \"unjust,\r\noppressive, and intolerable,\" and that restoration under his \"inadequate\r\nconditions\" would only magnify \"the perils and sorrows of our condition.\"\r\nThey agreed to support Congress and to endeavor to secure the ratification\r\nof the 14th Amendment. Congress alone had power to determine the political\r\nstatus of the States and the rights of the people, \"to the exclusion of\r\nthe independent action of any and every other department of the\r\nGovernment.\" \"The organizations of the unrepresented States, assuming to\r\nbe state governments, not having been legally established,\" were declared\r\n\"not legitimate governments until reorganized by Congress.\" In addition to\r\nthese resolutions, an address \"from the loyal men of the South to their\r\nfellow-citizens of the United States,\" was prepared and adopted after the\r\nformal adjournment of the convention.[143] This reaffirmed, in far\r\nstronger terms, the condemnation of President Johnson, specifying many\r\nways in which he had wrought injury to them, and closing with the\r\nfollowing significant and powerful declaration: \"We affirm that the\r\nloyalists of the South look to Congress with affectionate gratitude and\r\nconfidence, as the only means to save us from persecution, exile and death\r\nitself; and we also declare that there can be no security for us or our\r\nchildren, there can be no safety for the country against the fell spirit\r\nof slavery, now organized in the form of serfdom, unless the Government,\r\nby national and appropriate legislation, enforced by national authority,\r\nshall confer on every citizen in the States we represent the American\r\nbirthright of impartial suffrage and equality before the law. This is the\r\none all-sufficient remedy. This is our great need and pressing\r\nnecessity.\"[144]\r\n\r\nA third convention of the year was the Cleveland convention of soldiers\r\nand sailors,[145] organized on September 17, with General Wood of the\r\nregular army as chairman. This convention was composed of supporters of\r\nthe administration, and, like the National Union convention, contained a\r\nconsiderable proportion of Democrats. The resolutions endorsed those of\r\nthe National Union convention, and declared that \"our object in taking up\r\narms to suppress the late rebellion was to defend and maintain the\r\nsupremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve the Union with all the\r\ndignity, equality, and rights of the States unimpaired.\"\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the soldiers, however, were earnest supporters of\r\nCongress, and the results of the Cleveland convention were disappointing\r\nto its originators; its principal effect was to create great enthusiasm\r\nover the anti-administration convention of soldiers and sailors, which met\r\nin Pittsburg on September 25 and 26.[146] This demonstration was intended\r\nto offset whatever influence the Cleveland convention might have had over\r\nthe people, and it proved wonderfully effective. It was estimated that at\r\nleast twenty-five thousand old soldiers were in the city at the time. The\r\ncause for this enthusiastic support is not difficult to find. The policy\r\nof the administration appealed to the moderates--those who wished as rapid\r\na restoration to former conditions as possible, and those who were most\r\ninfluenced by the appeal to so-called justice. The majority of the\r\nsoldiers, on the contrary, those who had made the greatest sacrifices for\r\ntheir country, were the most sensitive concerning the results of their\r\nsacrifices. Thoroughly accustomed to the thought of their great\r\naccomplishments, the manumission of the slaves and the preservation of the\r\nintegrity of national power, they were keen to resent any steps which they\r\nthought tended toward the annulling of these results. With this natural\r\nbias, the arguments which the congressional party brought to bear upon\r\nthem were accepted with enthusiasm; and many of the leaders went into the\r\npolitical campaign to be followed by the same soldiers who had followed\r\nthem through their military campaigns. The convention, however, was in no\r\nsense a convention of officers. While the permanent president, Jacob D.\r\nCox, of Ohio,[147] had been a general of volunteers, the temporary\r\nchairman, L. E. Dudley, had been a private, and the majority of the\r\noffices of the convention were filled by men below the rank of\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected from the nature of the convention, the feeling\r\nagainst the administration was stronger and declared in more impassioned\r\ntones than in the previous anti-administration convention. Its influence\r\nupon the country was correspondingly greater. The army, recognized at this\r\ntime as the great preserver of the commonwealth, had great influence over\r\nall classes of citizens. The anti-administration conventions, the New\r\nOrleans massacre, and the violent attacks on Congress by the President\r\nwhile \"swinging around the circle,\" assured the triumph of the\r\ncongressional party.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions adopted at Pittsburgh were presented by General\r\nButler.[148] They were emphatic in tone, commencing with the declaration\r\nthat \"the action of the present Congress in passing the pending\r\nconstitutional amendment is wise, prudent, and just,\" and that it was\r\nunfortunate that it was not received in the proper spirit, the terms being\r\nthe mildest \"ever granted to subdued rebels.\" The President's policy was\r\ndeclared to be \"as dangerous as it is unwise,\" and \"if consummated it\r\nwould render the sacrifices of the nation useless.\" The power \"to pass all\r\nacts of legislation that are necessary for the complete restoration of the\r\nUnion\" was declared to rest in Congress. The declaration of the President\r\nto the committee of the National Union convention, that he could have made\r\nhimself dictator through the Freedmen's Bureau, aided by the army and\r\nnavy, was characterized as an insult to \"every soldier and sailor in the\r\nRepublic.\" The obligation of the soldiers and sailors to the loyal men of\r\nthe South was acknowledged; and it was added: \"We will stand by and\r\nprotect with our lives, if necessary, those brave men who remain true to\r\nus when all around are false and faithless.\"\r\n\r\nThis, the most successful of the four conventions, completed the\r\nremarkable series of national gatherings organized for effect on the State\r\nelections. They were all characterized by frankness of statement, and by\r\nclear recognition of the points at issue. But, as frequently happens in\r\npolitical campaigns, the most important incidents were those which were\r\nnot designed to affect national issues. The riot at New Orleans was\r\nintended, by its participants, to affect only Louisiana politics, yet all\r\nthe Southern States were compelled to share the responsibility. The same\r\nthing was true of all other incidents through which the South manifested,\r\nduring these critical months, an unwillingness to accept the political\r\nresults of the war.\r\n\r\n5. The fall elections resulted in a decisive victory for the congressional\r\npolicy, which secured a two-thirds majority in both houses. The protests\r\nof the President were shown to lack popular support, and his vetoes in the\r\ncoming sessions were to be considered as merely one necessary step in the\r\nlegislative formality of passing a bill. The country had decreed that\r\nJohnson could not have a voice in legislation. The campaign had been in\r\nall respects disastrous to the President. The support which he had\r\nreceived was mainly drawn from the Democratic party, and was of a\r\nhalf-hearted nature; for, however nearly they agreed in theory, the fact\r\nstill remained that he was nominally a Republican President, and that\r\nalmost all of his patronage was bestowed upon Republicans. He had thrown\r\nout decided hints that he would reverse his policy. For example, in St.\r\nLouis, on September 8, he said: \"I believe in the good old doctrine\r\nadvocated by Washington, Jefferson and Madison--of rotation in office.\r\nThese people who have been enjoying these offices seem to have lost sight\r\nof this doctrine. I believe that one set of men have enjoyed the\r\nemoluments of office long enough. They should let another portion of the\r\npeople have a chance. * * * Congress says he [the President] shall not\r\nturn them out, and they are trying to pass laws to prevent it being done.\r\nWell, let me say to you, if you will stand by me in this action (cheers),\r\nif you will stand by me in trying to give the people a fair\r\nchance--soldiers and citizens--to participate in these offices, God being\r\nwilling I will kick them out. * * * God willing, with your help, I will\r\nveto their measures whenever any of them come to me.\"[149] But all this\r\nfailed to give him that which he prided himself so much on having, the\r\nsupport of the people; and, so far as reconstruction was concerned, his\r\ninfluence was ended by the fall elections of 1866.\r\n\r\n6. While such was the general result of the campaign, the South voted to\r\nsustain the President's policy. The fact that Johnson had taken direct\r\nissue with Congress, and was actively supporting Democratic principles,\r\nhad a wonderful influence upon the South. The papers enthusiastically\r\nprophesied the complete overthrow of the Republican party. They reasoned\r\nthat the enormous patronage of the President would ensure him a following\r\nso powerful that its coalition with Democracy could not but result in\r\nvictory. Then, they reasoned, it would only be necessary to wait until the\r\nconvening of the 40th Congress, when the obnoxious amendment would be\r\ndiscredited and the States readmitted to the possession of all their\r\nrights and privileges without further delay or conditions. They utterly\r\nfailed to realize the injury which their discriminative legislation, the\r\nNew Orleans riots, the widely spread reports of cruelty and oppression,\r\nand the defiant attitude of their press, had inflicted on their cause.\r\nThey only saw that the administration and Congress were estranged, and\r\nbelieved that to be a sure indication of final success.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind they came to the polls, and in all the Southern\r\nStates overwhelming Democratic majorities evidenced the popular sentiment\r\namong the dominant classes. Accordingly, when the State legislatures\r\nconvened, the 14th amendment was rejected almost unanimously in all except\r\nTennessee, which had ratified it in July. Delaware, Maryland and Kentucky,\r\nthe border Union States, also rejected the amendment, allying themselves\r\nwith the Southern cause. Twenty-one of the remaining twenty-four States\r\nratified the amendment, endorsing thereby the action of Congress.[150]\r\nIowa, Nebraska and California did not act upon the amendment at this time.\r\n\r\nHad Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner been able to persuade Congress to\r\nadopt their theory of the status of the Southern States, the amendment\r\nwould have been assumed to be a part of the Constitution, as twenty-one\r\nStates were more than three-quarters of twenty-seven, the total number of\r\nStates represented in Congress. But the majority of congressmen were never\r\nable to adopt, in its entirety, the theory that the rebellion had utterly\r\ndestroyed the States and left them mere territory. It preferred to\r\naccomplish the same result by less violent means. The legislation enacted\r\nas a result of the attitude of the South towards the amendment practically\r\ntreated the States as conquered territory, yet they were counted in\r\ndetermining the ratification of both the 13th and the 14th amendment.\r\n\r\nThe defiant attitude taken by the Southern legislatures was a grave\r\nmistake. The most of them did not convene until Congress was again in\r\nsession, after the defeat of the administration, and when they should have\r\nbeen able to see that their only hope was in submission. But the South,\r\never too ready to act first and consider the consequences afterwards, only\r\nsaw in the proposed amendment an insult to the white race and an injustice\r\nto their leaders. That they should be asked deliberately to inflict upon\r\nthemselves this punishment, seemed a humiliation which self-respect could\r\npermit them only to spurn. They did not stop to realize that the rejection\r\nof these terms would cause measures still more severe to be enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL THEORY FULLY DEVELOPED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The second session of the 39th Congress opened with its members in a\r\nfar different frame of mind from that in which they had assembled in 1865.\r\nThen they had approached their work with hesitation; their plans were not\r\nformulated; they could not know how far the country would sustain them in\r\ntheir opposition to the President. Now, in the flush of victory, their\r\npolicy sustained, the President discredited, with their two-thirds\r\nmajority in both houses unbroken, they were prepared to proceed to enact\r\nlegislation which not only should secure that which had been accomplished\r\nalready, but also should settle finally the problem of reconstruction, and\r\nplace the President in a position where he could do no harm.[151]\r\n\r\nMuch curiosity had been felt as to the attitude which Johnson would take\r\nin his annual message. He believed thoroughly in the righteousness of his\r\ncause, and had such implicit confidence in the unerring judgment of the\r\npeople that he had deemed it impossible that his policy would be\r\nrepudiated. The results of the election were a great disappointment to\r\nhim, and some had believed that he would introduce into the message the\r\nabuse which he had so unsparingly inflicted upon Congress during the\r\ncampaign. The message, however, contained nothing approaching virulence,\r\nbut on the contrary was a document eminently creditable to the\r\nPresident.[152] It restated in a powerful way the constitutional position\r\nof the administration, and defended its actions in a dignified yet\r\nspirited manner. The fearlessness of his attitude was characteristic; the\r\nargumentative brilliancy of its presentation was unsurpassed. Unmindful of\r\nthe fact that Congress had assembled to complete the overthrow of his\r\npolicy of reconstruction, he reminded Congress that \"the Constitution of\r\nthe United States makes it the duty of the President to recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress\" such measures as he shall judge necessary or\r\nexpedient. \"* * * I know,\" he said, \"of no measure more imperatively\r\ndemanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy, and\r\nequal justice, than the admission of loyal members from the now\r\nunrepresented States. * * * The interests of the nation are best to be\r\npromoted by the revival of fraternal relations, the complete obliteration\r\nof our past differences, and the re-inauguration of all pursuits of\r\npeace.\"[153] The message closed with the request: \"Let us endeavor to\r\npreserve harmony between the co-ordinate departments of the Government,\r\nthat each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in\r\nsecuring the maintenance of the Constitution, the preservation of the\r\nUnion, and the perpetuity of our free institutions.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the country, there could be no harmony \"between the\r\nco-ordinate departments of the Government,\" where there was such\r\nfundamental disagreement. Neither side proposed to retreat an inch from\r\nthe stand taken, and the message served no other purpose than to leave a\r\nvery excellent state paper as a memento of the session.\r\n\r\nThe Joint Committee on Reconstruction[154] was immediately re-appointed by\r\na concurrent resolution. Only one change was necessary--Mr. Grider, of\r\nKentucky, one of the minority members, had died during the recess of\r\nCongress, and in his place Mr. Hise, of the same State, was appointed. The\r\ncommittee immediately resumed its labors, and proceeded to frame a bill\r\n\"for the more efficient government of the rebel States.\" The developments\r\nof the last three months had created a sentiment favorable to more\r\nstringent conditions of re-admission, and the action of the various\r\nSouthern legislatures, who were rejecting the 14th amendment during this\r\nperiod, served as a further stimulus to vigorous action.\r\n\r\n2. Several weeks elapsed before the committee was willing to adopt any\r\ndefinite plan. Finally, on February 4, 1867, Mr. Williams reported from\r\nthe committee, a bill to the Senate;[155] it was referred back to the\r\ncommittee, and was formally reported to the House by Mr. Stevens on the\r\n6th.[156]\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the bill declared that in the absence of legal State\r\ngovernments there was no adequate protection for person and property, and\r\nthat therefore it was necessary to enforce peace and good order until\r\nloyal State governments could be established. To this end \"the so-called\r\nStates shall be divided into military districts,\" five in number, Virginia\r\nto constitute the first, North Carolina and South Carolina the second,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, and Florida the third, Mississippi and Arkansas the\r\nfourth, and Louisiana and Texas the fifth. The General of the Army was \"to\r\nassign to the command of each of said districts an officer of the regular\r\narmy not below the rank of brigadier-general, and to detail a sufficient\r\nforce to enable such officer to enforce his authority.\" The officer in\r\ncommand of a district was to have complete authority to protect the civil\r\nrights of all, suppress insurrection and preserve order. To assist him he\r\ncould employ civil or military tribunals at his discretion, but no capital\r\npunishment, imposed by a military tribunal, should be executed without the\r\napproval of the officer in charge of the district. Writs of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ should not be issued by federal courts or judicial officers except\r\non endorsement of some commissioned officer in the district.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the bill began on the day following its introduction.\r\nMr. Stevens, with his usual impetuosity, wished for an immediate vote. The\r\nbill seemed more moderate to him than the South deserved, and with the\r\nlarge Republican majority intent upon some such legislation, he could see\r\nno reason for delay. The bill was clearly worded and all could understand\r\nit perfectly. But there was an influential element that preferred to make\r\nhaste slowly, and many hours were given up to debate before the final\r\npassage of the bill by the House, on February 20.\r\n\r\nThe measure certainly was exceedingly radical as it was reported from the\r\ncommittee. As Mr. Le Blond, of Ohio, said: \"It strikes at the civil\r\ngovernments in those States. It ignores State lines. It destroys their\r\ncivil governments. It breaks down the judicial system in those\r\nStates.\"[157] The distrust of the President was evidenced by empowering\r\nGeneral Grant to appoint the commanders of the military districts,\r\nignoring the President as commander-in-chief of the army. Most important\r\nof all, the bill as it stood was the action of a conquering power over\r\nconquered territory. It provided for an indefinite military control over\r\nthe territory, and specified no mode in which a State might free herself\r\nfrom the onerous conditions. It was not a measure of reconstruction; it\r\nwas a measure of subjugation.\r\n\r\nOf course none of its supporters had the slightest idea of its being more\r\nthan a temporary measure, but even temporary measures must be considered\r\nin all their aspects. Their idea was that expressed by Mr. Brandegee of\r\nConnecticut when he said: \"It holds those revolted communities in the\r\ngrasp of war until the rebellion shall have laid down its spirit, as two\r\nyears ago it formally laid down its arms.\"[158]\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham took an active part in the opposition to the adoption of the\r\nbill as it stood. Representing the more conservative branch of the\r\nanti-administration party, he suggested on the opening day of the\r\ndiscussion amendments which would make the bill more desirable. On\r\nFebruary 12 he submitted an amendment, the essential features of which\r\nwere finally adopted, but which encountered the fiercest opposition and\r\nwas only carried when compromise between the House and the Senate was\r\nfound to be impossible. His amendment provided as conditions for\r\nre-admitting a State to representation in Congress: Ratification of the\r\n14th amendment; such modification of State constitution and laws as would\r\nmake them conform to that amendment; a constitutional provision for negro\r\nsuffrage; and the approval of the constitution by Congress as republican\r\nin form and consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine proposed an amendment similar in its aim to that of Mr.\r\nBingham, who accepted it as a substitute. But the House was opposed to\r\nproviding any loop-holes by which the States could escape the provisions\r\nof the act. The feeling that the South had been weighed in the balance and\r\nfound wanting, that its whole attitude was that of defiance, and that it\r\nwould endeavor to undo all that had been done as soon as it could obtain\r\nan opportunity, was sufficiently strong to defeat an attempt to refer the\r\nbill to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to incorporate the\r\namendment. Instead, a substitute measure, introduced by Mr. Stevens, which\r\ndiffered but little from the original bill, passed the House on February\r\n13.[159]\r\n\r\nThe great struggle now began in the Senate, where the Blaine amendment was\r\nmoved by Mr. Johnson of Maryland, on February 15. There was an influential\r\nelement which feared that its adoption would utterly nullify the object of\r\nthe bill--to govern the States until they could be re-admitted with\r\nsafety. Their objections were based on the same principles that had proved\r\nfatal to the amendment in the House. \"I see,\" said Senator Howard, \"in\r\nthis amendment a fatal snare by which we shall be deceived in the end, by\r\nwhich we are to be deluded into a premature re-admission of the rebel\r\nStates in such a manner as to make us ultimately repent of our folly and\r\nrashness. * * * It is a snare by which increased representation from the\r\nrebel States may come into Congress, * * while we have no security at all\r\nthat the extended elective franchise will be continued in the rebel States\r\nto the black population. They can disfranchise them whenever they see fit\r\nafter having secured increased representation.\"[160]\r\n\r\nThe Senate, more conservative than the House, could not muster such a\r\nstrong opposition to the amendment. It was rejected, but rejected in order\r\nto open the way for another amendment in the form of a substitute bill,\r\nwhich was moved by Senator Sherman.[161] The substitute had been agreed\r\nupon in a Republican caucus, and was accordingly carried. Its first four\r\nsections contained nearly all the features of the original bill; it\r\nsubstituted \"President\" for \"General,\" in the second section, and, in\r\nplace of the provision against writs of _habeas corpus_, the fourth\r\nsection simply enacted that \"all persons put under military arrest by\r\nvirtue of this act shall be tried without unnecessary delay, and no cruel\r\nor unusual punishment shall be inflicted.\" The fifth section contained the\r\nfeatures proposed in the Bingham and Blaine amendments, amplified in a\r\nmanner satisfactory to the majority of the Senatorial caucus. The\r\nconditions of readmission were as follows: The adoption of a constitution\r\nin conformity with the Constitution of the United States, and the\r\nratification of the 14th amendment. The constitution, which must be\r\nexamined and approved by Congress, must be framed by a convention of\r\ndelegates chosen by \"the male citizens of said State twenty-one years of\r\nage and upwards, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, who have\r\nbeen resident in the State for one year previous to the day of such\r\nelection, except such as may be disfranchised for participation in the\r\nrebellion, or for felony at common law;\" must give the elective franchise\r\nto all qualified as electors for the delegates; and must be ratified by a\r\nmajority of the persons voting on ratification, and qualified as such\r\nelectors. To this the proviso was added that no person disqualified by the\r\n14th amendment from holding office should be chosen as a delegate to the\r\nconvention or vote for members of it. One more amendment to the bill was\r\nmade on motion of Senator Doolittle. This added as a proviso to the fourth\r\nsection: \"That no sentence of death under the provisions of this act shall\r\nbe carried into effect without the approval of the President.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was returned to the House in this form, the Senate having passed\r\nit at six o'clock Sunday morning, February 17. The margin of time that\r\ncould be used without permitting the bill to be killed by a \"pocket veto\"\r\nwas now very limited, but the House refused to concur in the amendment\r\nand called for a committee of conference, February 19. The Senate insisted\r\non its amendment and the bill was again returned to the House, which on\r\nthe following day concurred in the Senate amendment, but added an\r\namendment of its own proposed by Mr. Wilson, of Iowa, and amended on\r\nmotion of Mr. Shellabarger.[162] This amendment, constituting the sixth\r\nsection of the bill, was speedily concurred in by the Senate, and on\r\nFebruary 20, 1867, the bill was finally passed and ready for the\r\nPresident's veto.\r\n\r\nThe sixth section, so hurriedly tacked on to the bill, was of no slight\r\nimportance, as it declared in legal form the _status_ of the Southern\r\ngovernments, and clinched the qualifications for the elective franchise.\r\nIt provided that \"until the people of said rebel States shall be by law\r\nadmitted to representation in the Congress of the United States, any civil\r\ngovernments which may exist therein shall be deemed provisional only, and\r\nin all respects subject to the paramount authority of the United States at\r\nany time to abolish, modify, control, or supersede the same; and in all\r\nelections to any office under such provisional governments all persons\r\nshall be entitled to vote, and none others, who are entitled to vote under\r\nthe provisions of the fifth section of this act; and no person shall be\r\neligible to any office under any such provisional governments who would be\r\ndisqualified from holding office under the provisions of the third article\r\nof said constitutional amendment.\"[163]\r\n\r\nAs had been expected, Johnson withheld his veto as long as it was possible\r\nfor him to do so without permitting the bill to become a law, not\r\nreturning the bill until March 2.[164] This was done in the hope that the\r\nminority, by dilatory proceedings, might prevent action on the veto\r\nbefore the adjournment, on March 4, and so prevent the bill from becoming\r\na law. But the plan failed, and the bill was immediately passed, \"the\r\nobjections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe veto message embodied an exhaustive review of the bill, a criticism of\r\nits \"cruelty,\" and an attack upon its constitutionality. It denied the\r\nstatement in the preamble that \"no legal State governments or adequate\r\nprotection for life or property,\" existed in these ten States, and\r\ndeclared that \"the establishment of peace and good order is not its real\r\nobject. * * * The military rule which it establishes is plainly to be\r\nused, not for any purpose of order or for the prevention of crime, but\r\nsolely as a means of coercing the people into the adoption of principles\r\nand measures to which it is known that they are opposed, and upon which\r\nthey have an undeniable right to exercise their own judgment.\" The\r\ndespotic authority given to the commander of a district was vigorously\r\ndenounced, and all the humane provisions of the bill were declared to\r\ndepend upon the will of the commander, who could nullify them and oppress\r\nthe people without limitations of any kind. \"It reduces the whole\r\npopulation of the ten States--all persons, of every color, sex and\r\ncondition, and every stranger within their limits--to the most abject and\r\ndegrading slavery.\"\r\n\r\nBut aside from its injustice, Johnson went on to argue, the measure was\r\nunconstitutional and could not legally be carried into execution. In a\r\ntime of peace martial law could not be established, in proof of which\r\nstatement he quoted from the decision of the Supreme Court, in _Ex parte_\r\nMilligan, defining military jurisdiction. The denial of the right of trial\r\nby jury and of the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ was not\r\ncounterbalanced by the poor privilege of trial \"without unnecessary\r\ndelay.\" In defiance of the constitutional prohibition of bills of\r\nattainder, \"here is a bill of attainder against nine millions of people at\r\nonce\"--a legislative enactment \"based upon an accusation so vague as to be\r\nscarcely intelligible, and found to be true upon no credible evidence.\"\r\nThe primary purpose of the bill, to compel these States \"by force to the\r\nadoption of organic laws and regulations which they are unwilling to\r\naccept if left to themselves,\" was in itself unconstitutional. \"The\r\nFederal Government has no jurisdiction, authority, or power to regulate\r\nsuch subjects for any State.\"\r\n\r\nRespecting the legality of the state governments, the important point was\r\nmade that if they were illegal, their ratification of the 13th amendment\r\ncould not have been legal. The message closed with an appeal for\r\nrestoration \"by simple compliance with the plain requirements of the\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the message unquestionably contained many strong\r\narguments against the bill, and was virtually a summary of the arguments\r\nadvanced by the minority in Congress. But the struggle had passed beyond\r\nthe province of unbiased debate, and each side was equally determined not\r\nto yield any point. A measure open to the most serious suspicions\r\nregarding its constitutionality, was passed by an inflexible majority,\r\nsettled in the belief that the condition of the South required the\r\nmeasure, and that the Constitution must accordingly be stretched to cover\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThose supporters of the bill who were recognized as the most careful in\r\ntheir judgments confidently asserted that that portion of it establishing\r\nthe military districts contained nothing that could not have been carried\r\nout legally by the government as a military measure, without the formality\r\nof enacting the bill. The insurrectionary States would legally remain in a\r\ncondition of insurrection until Congress should formally declare the\r\ninsurrection to be at end. Consequently martial law could\r\nconstitutionally prevail, trial by jury and the writ of _habeas corpus_ be\r\nsuspended, and civil government utilized as an aid to military rule, to\r\nany extent that might seem advisable to the general in charge. The claim\r\nthat the measure amounted to an enormous bill of attainder was immediately\r\ndismissed as absurd, as no corruption of blood or forfeiture of estates\r\nwas involved, and the whole measure was avowedly temporary, to cease as\r\nsoon as the State should comply with the conditions of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nCongress felt justified in passing the bill over the veto, and accordingly\r\nthe general process of reconstruction was established with conditions far\r\nmore onerous than had been intended in the first session of the 39th\r\nCongress. The provisions of the act immediately went into force, and the\r\ncommanders of the districts were appointed on March eleventh.\r\n\r\n3. The bill was conceded by all its supporters to be incomplete. It\r\nprovided for the establishment of districts and the governing of these\r\ndistricts by military law, and it was hoped that the immediate crying need\r\nof a strong government to enforce order and prevent the continuance of the\r\noppression of the freedmen was satisfied. This done, they could proceed\r\nmore deliberately to the enactment of measures which would provide the\r\nmechanism for carrying out the provisions of the fifth section. The\r\nadjournment of the 39th Congress at noon of March 4 prevented any action\r\nuntil the next Congress; but preparation had been made for such an\r\nemergency by an act which provided that in future each Congress should\r\nconvene upon the adjournment of its predecessor.[165]\r\n\r\nThe 40th Congress at once settled down to work upon the problem. Chief\r\nJustice Chase prepared a bill which was used as a basis for the\r\ndiscussion. Senator Wilson and others modified the bill to some extent,\r\nand introduced it in the Senate on March 7.[166] The same bill, slightly\r\nmodified, was introduced in the House.[167] Considerable trouble was\r\nexperienced in agreeing upon the details of the bill, but on March 19 both\r\nhouses finally adopted a compromise proposed by a committee of conference.\r\nThe veto message of the President was received four days later; the bill\r\nwas immediately passed over the veto and became a law.[168]\r\n\r\nAs finally passed, the bill was entitled: \"An Act supplementary to an Act\r\nentitled, 'An Act to provide for the more efficient government of the\r\nrebel States,' passed March second, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and\r\nto facilitate restoration.\" It enacted that the commanding general in each\r\ndistrict should cause a registration to be made before September 1, 1867,\r\nof those entitled to vote under the original act, and should require all\r\nregistering to take the following oath: \"I, ---- do solemnly swear (or\r\naffirm) in the presence of Almighty God, that I am a citizen of the State\r\nof ----; that I have resided in said State for ---- months next preceding\r\nthis day, and now reside in the county of ----, or the parish of ----, in\r\nsaid State (as the case may be); that I am twenty-one years old; that I\r\nhave not been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil\r\nwar against the United States, nor for felony committed against the laws\r\nof any State or of the United States; that I have never been a member of\r\nany State legislature, nor held any executive or judicial office in any\r\nState and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the\r\nUnited States, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; that I\r\nhave never taken an oath as a member of Congress of the United States, or\r\nas an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State\r\nlegislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, and afterwards engaged in\r\ninsurrection or rebellion against the United States or given aid or\r\ncomfort to the enemies thereof; that I will faithfully support the\r\nConstitution and obey the laws of the United States, and will, to the best\r\nof my ability, encourage others so to do, so help me God.\"[169] After the\r\ncompletion of the registration in any State, it was provided that there\r\nshould be held, after at least thirty days' public notice by the\r\ncommanding general, an election of delegates \"to a convention for the\r\npurpose of establishing a constitution and civil government for such State\r\nloyal to the Union.\" This convention was to consist of the same number of\r\nmembers as the most numerous branch of the State legislature in 1860.[170]\r\nThose voting at the election of delegates were also to vote for or against\r\nthe holding of the convention, and it was not to be held if a majority of\r\nthe ballots was cast against it, or if a majority of the registered voters\r\nfailed to vote on the question. Boards were to be appointed by the\r\ncommanding general to superintend the registration and election, and make\r\nreturns to him of the results of the election. The convention was required\r\nto assemble at a place and time appointed by the commanding general, by a\r\nnotice to be given by him within sixty days from the date of election; and\r\nto frame a constitution according to the provisions of the original and\r\nthe present act. The constitution so framed was then to be submitted to\r\nthe registered voters at an election conducted by officials who were to\r\nbe appointed by the commanding general, and who were to make returns to\r\nhim. In case the constitution was ratified \"by a majority of the votes of\r\nthe registered electors qualified as herein specified, cast at said\r\nelection (at least one-half of all the registered voters voting upon the\r\nquestion of such ratification),\" it was provided that the president of the\r\nconvention should \"transmit a copy of the same, duly certified, to the\r\nPresident of the United States, who shall forthwith transmit the same to\r\nCongress,\" and that, if Congress should be satisfied that all the\r\nprovisions of the acts were carried out, and that no force or fraud was\r\nused, and should approve the constitution, the State should \"be declared\r\nentitled to representation, and senators and representatives shall be\r\nadmitted therefrom as therein provided.\" It was further provided that all\r\nelections in the States mentioned in the original act should, during the\r\noperation of that act, be by ballot; that the officials in charge of the\r\nregistration and elections must take the \"iron-clad\" oath of July 2,\r\n1862[171] that the expenses incurred by the commanding generals in\r\ncarrying out the act should be paid out of the treasury, but that the\r\nstate conventions should provide for the levying of taxes to pay other\r\nexpenses.[172]\r\n\r\nThe veto message on this bill was much shorter than that on the original\r\nreconstruction measure. The President said: \"No consideration could induce\r\nme to give my approval to such an election law for any purpose, and\r\nespecially for the great purpose of framing the constitution of a State.\r\nIf ever the American citizen should be left to the free exercise of his\r\nown judgment, it is when he is engaged in the work of forming the\r\nfundamental law under which he is to live.\" He animadverted upon the\r\nextreme looseness of the provisions in regard to the registration boards,\r\nand upon the great powers vested in them. The main objections to the bill\r\nwere of course those which he had stated in the veto of March 2.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the supplementary reconstruction act, and of a joint\r\nresolution providing for the expenses involved in carrying out the\r\nprovisions of the act, completed the work of this session of the 40th\r\nCongress. It was hoped that no further congressional action would be\r\nneeded until the constitutions of the States should be submitted for\r\nexamination and approval, preparatory to granting representation. But the\r\nimportance of the measures and the avowed hostility of the President\r\ncaused hesitation on the part of Congress as to adjourning till the\r\nregular December session. It was realized that if any loop-hole could be\r\nfound by which the intention of the act could be evaded, Johnson would\r\nhave no hesitation in taking advantage of it. To provide for such a\r\ncontingency Congress passed a concurrent resolution which provided for a\r\nrecess until July 3, and authorized the President of the Senate and the\r\nSpeaker of the House to adjourn Congress until the first Monday in\r\nDecember if a quorum did not appear on July 3. In case everything\r\nappeared to be progressing with little friction, the members would not\r\nassemble; but if there should be any unfavorable developments, Congress\r\ncould assemble independently of the President and enact legislation to\r\nremedy the difficulty.\r\n\r\n4. July 3 found a quorum in both houses. The Attorney-General had rendered\r\nan opinion upon the act of March 2 which greatly hampered the work of the\r\ncommanders of the districts. He advised the President that the act should\r\nbe construed strictly, that the commanders should be allowed no powers\r\nbeyond those specifically bestowed upon them. This prevented them from\r\nremoving state officers, from making new laws for the government of the\r\npeople, or from suspending the action of the state courts; and with state\r\nofficers hostile to the federal authorities, and using every means to\r\nimpede their work, the commanders found it impossible properly to\r\ndischarge the duties assigned to them by the act.[173] The intent of the\r\nreconstruction acts obviously was to make the commanders of the districts\r\ncommanders _de facto_ as well as _de jure_. Consequently remedial\r\nlegislation was deemed necessary, and Congress convened for the purpose of\r\nframing additional acts defining more precisely the intention of the\r\npreceding acts and the powers of the commanders.\r\n\r\nA few days' debate sufficed to bring Congress to an agreement as to the\r\nform of a second supplementary act. The bill passed both Houses on July\r\n13, was vetoed on the 19th, and was immediately passed over the veto.[174]\r\nIt declared[175] the true intent and meaning of the previous\r\nreconstruction acts to be that the governments then existing in the ten\r\nStates specified in the acts were illegal, and that such governments, \"if\r\ncontinued, were to be continued subject in all respects to the military\r\ncommanders of the respective districts, and to the paramount authority of\r\nCongress.\" It therefore provided that the district commanders should have\r\nthe power to suspend or remove all incumbents of offices of \"any so-called\r\nState or the government thereof,\" and to fill all vacancies in such\r\noffices, however caused. The same powers were granted to the General of\r\nthe Army, who was also empowered to disapprove the appointments or\r\nremovals made by the district commanders. The previous appointments by the\r\ndistrict commanders were confirmed and made subject to the provisions of\r\nthe act, and it was declared to be the duty of these commanders to remove\r\nfrom office all who were disloyal to the United States, or who opposed in\r\nany way the administration of the reconstruction acts. The registration\r\nboards were empowered and required \"before allowing the registration of\r\nany person to ascertain, upon such facts or information as they can\r\nobtain, whether such person is entitled to be registered.\"[176] No person\r\nwas to be disqualified as a member of any board of registration by reason\r\nof race or color. The true intent and meaning of the oath prescribed in\r\nthe supplementary act was fully explained, the most important portion of\r\nthe explanation being that the words \"executive or judicial office in any\r\nState\" should be construed to \"include all civil offices created by law\r\nfor the administration of any general law of a State, or for the\r\nadministration of justice.\" The time of registration under the\r\nsupplementary act was extended to October 1, 1867, in the discretion of\r\nthe commander and it was provided that \"the boards of registration shall\r\nhave power, and it shall be their duty, commencing fourteen days prior to\r\nany election under said act, and upon reasonable notice of the time and\r\nplace thereof, to revise, for a period of five days, the registration\r\nlists,\" by striking out the names of those found to be disqualified, and\r\nadding the names of those qualified for registration. Executive pardon or\r\namnesty should not qualify any one for registration who without it would\r\nbe disqualified. District commanders were empowered \"to remove any member\r\nof a board of registration, and to appoint another in his stead, and to\r\nfill any vacancy in such board.\" The iron-clad oath was to be required of\r\nall registration boards, and of all persons elected or appointed to office\r\nin the military districts. Further possibility of unfavorable construction\r\nby the Attorney-General was prevented by the provision that \"no district\r\ncommander or member of the board of registration, or any of the officers\r\nor appointees acting under them, shall be bound in his action by any\r\nopinion of any civil officer of the United States.\" The closing section,\r\ntaken in connection with this, was fully as significant: \"All the\r\nprovisions of this act and of the acts to which this is supplementary\r\nshall be construed liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof may\r\nbe fully and perfectly carried out.\"\r\n\r\n5. Reconstruction under the provisions of these three acts was rapidly\r\naccomplished in most of the States.[177] In some of the districts the\r\ncommanders probably were too severe upon the whites, but in the main the\r\nintent of the acts was carried out with as little harshness as could well\r\nbe expected. Those qualified were registered, conventions were held, and\r\nconstitutions were framed and submitted to the people for their\r\nratification according to the provisions of the acts. Alabama was the\r\nfirst State to vote upon a new constitution, and the Democrats, or\r\nConservatives, as they styled themselves, took advantage of the fifth\r\nsection of the act of March 23, which required at least one-half of the\r\nregistered voters to vote on the question of ratification, as a condition\r\nof the validity of the election. Non-action seemed to be the easiest\r\nmethod of defeating the constitution, and they accordingly absented\r\nthemselves from the polls, only 70,812, out of 165,812 registered voters,\r\ncasting their ballots.[178]\r\n\r\n6. There had been a strong minority in Congress opposed to the insertion\r\nof this section, who had foreseen this very outcome; and the action of\r\nAlabama converted the minority into a majority. A third supplementary bill\r\nwas accordingly passed. Johnson neither signed nor vetoed it; and it\r\nbecame a law without his signature on March 11, 1868. It provided that in\r\nfuture all elections authorized by the act of March 23, 1867, \"should be\r\ndecided by a majority of the votes actually cast,\" thus preventing any\r\nrepetition of the Alabama experiment.[179]\r\n\r\n7. The constitution submitted in Mississippi was rejected. Constitutions\r\nwere not submitted in Texas and Virginia until a later date. The other\r\nStates ratified their constitutions by large majorities, and on June 22\r\nthe act \"to admit the State of Arkansas to representation in Congress\"\r\nbecame a law.\r\n\r\n8. Three days later the act admitting North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nLouisiana, Georgia, Alabama and Florida to representation, became a law.\r\nBoth bills were passed over the President's vetoes, Johnson to the last\r\nrefusing to recognize even in the most indirect way the constitutionality\r\nof the congressional plan.\r\n\r\nEight of the eleven States were now nominally reconstructed, but in fact\r\nthey were only entering upon that most trying period of their history, the\r\nera of \"carpet-bag government.\" The whole period of reconstruction is\r\nmarked by blindness and prejudice on both sides. The spirit of compromise\r\ncould find no place in either's plans. \"What might have been\" is always a\r\nfruitless subject of discussion; but any student of the three tumultuous\r\nyears following the war cannot but see that the attitude of both the North\r\nand the South prevented the adoption of the plan of reconstruction which\r\nwould with the least trouble and delay, have remoulded the unwieldy mass\r\nof liberated blacks into an orderly, progressive class of citizens. At the\r\nsame time he can see that the divergence of views was inevitable and that\r\nit is impossible to say to one side \"You were right,\" and to the other\r\n\"You were wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the preceding chapters we have traced step by step the development\r\nof the theory of reconstruction and the formulation of the reconstruction\r\nacts of the 39th and 40th Congresses. We have noticed the wide divergence\r\nbetween the ideas of Johnson and those of the Republican party, and have\r\nseen that the whole program was carried over the vetoes of the President\r\nby the overwhelming Republican majority. But the contest between the\r\nPresident and Congress, which had been embittered by so many personalities\r\non both sides, did not come to an end with the passage of legislation\r\nwhich fully embodied the congressional theory, but continued until it\r\nculminated in a desperate effort of the Republican party to remove Johnson\r\nfrom the presidential chair.\r\n\r\nThe very conditions under which he assumed the presidential office\r\nrendered his position difficult, and made estrangement of the executive\r\nand legislative departments an easy matter. On the particular issue of\r\nreconstruction Lincoln and Congress were at variance; but the tragic\r\nnature of Lincoln's death caused this matter to be forgotten in the\r\noverwhelming sense of the loss of the man who had safely guided the\r\ngovernment through the most trying years of its history. But, for a\r\nCongress so extremely Northern and Republican, with antagonisms and\r\nprejudices which only fratricidal wars can create, to be compelled to work\r\nwith a man not only a Southerner, but practically a Democrat, must of\r\nnecessity bring about a crisis.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the flourishing condition of the spoils system served to\r\naggravate the antagonism between the two departments. History shows that,\r\nwhile selfish motives are always indignantly repudiated by politicians,\r\nthey account for many of the more important political movements of the\r\ncentury. With the immense federal patronage at his disposal, Johnson\r\nrealized that he had a powerful instrument of revenge at hand, and he did\r\nnot hesitate to use it. At a time when every congressman was under the\r\nstrongest pressure from his home constituency, inability to gratify the\r\ndemands of the voracious office-seeker was indeed a cause for bitterness.\r\n\r\nWe can thus easily distinguish three causes which, working together upon a\r\nstrongly Republican Congress, resulted in the attempted removal of the\r\nPresident. First, the antagonism arising from different fundamental\r\npolitical ideas, the strained conditions of the times, and the woeful\r\ntactlessness of Johnson; second, the almost morbid yet natural fears of\r\nthe Republican party regarding the sometime seceded States; third, the\r\nanger aroused by the use of federal patronage to further the interests of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n2. Impeachment, however, was too serious a matter for Congress to enter\r\nupon lightly. Art. II, sec. iv, of the Constitution provides for\r\nimpeachment as follows: \"The President, Vice-President and all civil\r\nofficers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment\r\nfor, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\" Obviously the President had not committed and would not\r\ncommit anything that could legally be called treason or bribery: Had he\r\ndone or would he do anything which could be construed as a high crime or\r\nmisdemeanor? The answer largely depended upon the person's point of view.\r\nThe extreme radical held that Johnson's whole career as President could be\r\nconsidered as an attempt treasonably to reinstate the Southern States in a\r\nposition of power. The more moderate Republicans could not be made to\r\nacquiesce in this view, and it soon became evident that Johnson would\r\nnever be brought to trial on impeachment, unless he could be made to\r\nviolate some clearly defined law. The radical element, however, did not\r\neasily accept this situation. By every means possible they tried to force\r\nthe moderates into line. The whole past career of the President was\r\ncritically studied, and every act which could by any possible means be\r\nconstrued as a breach of presidential duty was put in the list of offences\r\nfor which he should be tried. But all to no purpose. Something more\r\ntangible must be produced, or the trial would never occur.\r\n\r\n3. Notwithstanding the evident indisposition on the part of many to\r\nproceed to extreme measures, the radicals determined to force matters to\r\nan issue, if possible. Under Mr. James M. Ashley of Ohio as leader, the\r\nattack was begun shortly after the opening of the second session of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress. On December 17, 1866, Mr. Ashley moved to suspend\r\nthe rules so as to permit him to report a resolution from the Committee on\r\nTerritories. His motion was not agreed to, and the first step towards\r\nimpeachment was therefore a failure. The motion is of interest, however,\r\nas evidencing the deliberate intention of the radicals to discover some\r\nact which would justify impeachment. The resolution provided for a select\r\ncommittee who were to inquire \"whether any acts have been done by any\r\nofficer of the Government of the United States which in contemplation of\r\nthe Constitution are high crimes or misdemeanors, and whether said acts\r\nwere designed or calculated to overthrow, subvert or corrupt the\r\nGovernment of the United States, or any department thereof.\"\r\n\r\nAgain on January 7 resolutions looking to impeachment were offered by Mr.\r\nAshley and two other persons. Mr. Ashley's resolution was adopted, while\r\nthe others were referred to the Committee on Reconstruction and the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary. The resolutions which were referred gave as a\r\nreason for impeachment, \"the purpose of securing the fruits of the\r\nvictories gained on the part of the republic during the late war, waged by\r\nrebels and traitors against the life of the nation\"--a decidedly strong\r\nstatement to make, in view of the predominance of the Republican party at\r\nthe time, and its ability to render nugatory any attempt of the President\r\nto take away from the republic \"the fruits of the victories gained.\"\r\nExaggerated expressions of this sort show how far the contest had\r\ndegenerated from a conflict of opinions as to the constitutional position\r\nof the revolted States, into a personal warfare. Another significant\r\nreason for impeachment given in these resolutions was, that it was\r\nnecessary in order to give \"effect to the will of the people as expressed\r\nat the polls during the recent elections by a majority numbering in the\r\naggregate more than four hundred thousand votes.\" It has already been\r\nshown how disastrously the campaign resulted for Johnson, and how it\r\nfurnished popular sanction for the radical reconstruction legislation\r\nwhich was passed over the presidential vetoes. But, to assume that a\r\npopular expression of disapproval of the President's political program\r\nmade impeachment a moral necessity, was to assume a novel position. It was\r\nalso declared in these resolutions that the President was to be impeached\r\nfor the high crimes and misdemeanors \"of which he is manifestly and\r\nnotoriously guilty, and which render it unsafe longer to permit him to\r\nexercise the powers he has unlawfully assumed.\"\r\n\r\nThese expressions seeming to be too indefinite, the specific charges\r\nsubmitted by Mr. Ashley met with more favor, and were accordingly adopted.\r\nThese charges centered about an alleged \"usurpation of power and violation\r\nof law\" which was to be found in corrupt uses of the appointing,\r\npardoning, and veto powers, improper disposition of public offices and\r\ncorrupt interference in elections. These were clinched again by the\r\ngeneral charge that the President had \"committed acts which, in\r\ncontemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes and misdemeanors,\"--a\r\ncharge obviously introduced to include any points which might in the\r\nfuture be made against him.\r\n\r\n4. As the event proved, the attempt to bring matters to a successful issue\r\nin the 39th Congress was a failure. The Committee on the Judiciary went to\r\nwork vigorously, calling many witnesses and collecting as much material as\r\npossible; but on the 28th of February it reported, with only one\r\ndissenting, voice, that in spite of all its efforts not enough testimony\r\nhad been gathered to warrant any report beyond a recommendation that the\r\ninvestigation be continued. The ninth member of the committee, Mr. Rogers\r\nof New Jersey, reported emphatically that a careful examination of the\r\nsubject had convinced him that \"there is not a particle of evidence to\r\nsustain any of the charges,\" and that \"the case is wholly without a\r\nparticle of evidence upon which an impeachment could be founded.\" He\r\nfurther declared that but little of the testimony taken would be admitted\r\nin the courts, and that the whole matter should be dropped, as it would\r\ncertainly end \"in a complete vindication of the President.\" Logically, the\r\nstandpoint of Mr. Rogers was a correct one. From a strictly legal view of\r\nthe case, there was very serious doubt as to the advisability of\r\nattempting impeachment; but the opponents of the President counted upon\r\ntheir large majority to force the matter, and the line of action\r\nrecommended by the majority of the committee was adopted.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the 40th Congress assembled immediately upon the\r\nadjournment of the 39th; and on March 7, 1867, the new Judiciary Committee\r\nwas authorized to proceed with the investigation, and to continue it\r\nduring any recess the House might take. By another resolution agreed to\r\nMarch 29, the committee was requested to report immediately upon the\r\nreassembling of Congress, which was to be in the following July, if\r\npolitical conditions seemed to require it.[180]\r\n\r\nThe committee accordingly continued its investigations, but, though the\r\nradicals felt sure that it was composed of men who would favor\r\nimpeachment, it at first reported by a majority of five to four against\r\nimpeachment. A recommitment resulted in the conversion of one member of\r\nthe committee[181] to impeachment views; and on November 25 Mr. Boutwell,\r\nof Massachusetts, reported from the committee a resolution impeaching the\r\nPresident for high crimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n5. The debate on this resolution was entered upon in December, 1867, and\r\nwas marked by the effort on the part of the radicals to support a most\r\nindefinite and general charge. In spite of the thoroughness of the\r\ninvestigation of the Judiciary Committee, in which neither time nor\r\nexpense had been spared, the attitude of the moderates was justified.\r\nNothing had been unearthed which from the legal standpoint could be\r\nconsidered a high crime or misdemeanor. Failing in this, Mr. Boutwell\r\nassumed the ground that the evidence showed that President Johnson had\r\nbeen deliberately using his office to bring back, so far as possible, the\r\nDemocratic party into power, and that his efforts to restore the\r\ninsurrectionary States to their former power had been in the interest of\r\nthe rebellion.\r\n\r\nAlthough most Republicans at this time could not believe that the\r\ninhabitants of the Southern States were sincere in their protestations of\r\na desire to lay aside all differences and once more become loyal citizens,\r\nthere were many who could not agree to Mr. Boutwell's definition of high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors; and these moderate Republicans, aided by the\r\nDemocrats, defeated the resolution by a vote of one hundred and eight to\r\nfifty-seven.[182] The attempt to impeach without definite legal charges\r\nhad failed.\r\n\r\nBut the President soon gave the House the very opportunity it desired.\r\nWhile the direct attack upon the President was being carried on by means\r\nof the effort to impeach him, an indirect attack was made by the\r\nlegislative limitation of his powers. One of the cries of alarmists had\r\nbeen that there was danger that the President might in some way take\r\nadvantage of his constitutional position as commander-in-chief of the army\r\nand navy, so as to injure the government and advance his own interests.\r\nSome went even farther and declared that he designed with the aid of the\r\narmy to overthrow the government, and place the United States in the power\r\nof the rebels. Such charges, viewed from the standpoint of history, seem\r\ntoo absurd for consideration, but during the reconstruction period the\r\nfeverish condition of the country made possible the acceptance of almost\r\nany startling rumor.\r\n\r\n6. But even those who did not apprehend that Johnson would use the army\r\nfor any improper purpose, were willing to limit his power and prestige by\r\ndepriving him of his military authority; and this was accordingly done by\r\na section introduced into the army appropriation bill.[183] This section\r\nrequired all orders to the army to be made through the General of the\r\nArmy, thus practically making his approval of them necessary. It also\r\nprevented the President or the Secretary of War from removing, suspending\r\nor relieving from command the General of the Army, and even forbade his\r\nbeing assigned for duty away from headquarters, except at his own request.\r\nThis had the effect of taking away from the President all his\r\nconstitutional powers as commander-in-chief. As the section was put as a\r\nrider on an appropriation bill and a veto must cover the whole bill,\r\nJohnson contented himself with a simple protest and returned the act with\r\nhis signature.[184]\r\n\r\n7. The attack upon the civil powers of the President was made through the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act.[185] As the violation of this act was the ground of\r\nthe most serious charge in the impeachment trial, a somewhat detailed\r\nstudy of its provisions, and of the views expressed by the President in\r\nhis veto of it, is advisable. The bill provided that \"every person holding\r\nany civil office to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate,\" and every person so appointed in the future,\r\nshould be entitled to hold such office until a successor should have been\r\nappointed in like manner, that is to say, _with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate_. The only liberty of action allowed the President was during\r\nthe recess of the Senate, when he was permitted to suspend an officer\r\nuntil the next meeting of the Senate, and appoint a _pro tempore_\r\nofficial. Within twenty days after the meeting of the Senate, however, he\r\nwas required to give his reasons for the suspension. If the Senate\r\napproved of the removal, a permanent appointment was to be made; if they\r\nrefused to concur, the suspended officer was immediately to resume his\r\nduties. Any violation of this act by the President was made an impeachable\r\noffense, by the declaration that \"every removal, appointment, or\r\nemployment made, had, or exercised, contrary to the provisions of this act\r\n* * * are hereby declared to be high misdemeanors.\" The other provisions\r\nwere of minor importance, and do not require notice here.\r\n\r\nThe veto message of the President was a calm, dignified and judicial\r\ndiscussion of the constitutionality of the bill, and was in every way a\r\ncreditable document, sustaining fully the high character of his previous\r\nvetoes. He called attention to the fact that the whole question of the\r\nauthority of the President in cases of removal from office had been\r\ndiscussed thoroughly in Congress as early as 1789, and decided in favor of\r\nthe President. He quoted Madison's argument to prove that all executive\r\npower, except what is specifically excepted, is vested in the President,\r\nand that as no exception was made as to the power of removal, it must be\r\nvested in him. He also cited many possible cases, in which it would be\r\nabsolutely necessary for the President to possess the power of\r\nremoval.[186] A decision of the Supreme Court was referred to,[187] in\r\nwhich it was observed that both the legislative and the executive\r\ndepartment had assumed in practice that the power of removal was vested in\r\nthe President alone. When, for instance, the Departments of State, War and\r\nthe Treasury were created in 1789, provision was made for a subordinate\r\nwho should take charge of the office \"when the head of the Department\r\nshould be removed _by the President of the United States_.\" Story, Kent\r\nand Webster were all quoted as affirming the same legislative construction\r\nof the Constitution. The great practical value of the power during the\r\nCivil War was noticed, and its present and future necessity strongly\r\nurged; and the message closed with an earnest appeal to Congress not to\r\nviolate the original spirit of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n8. The passage of the bill over the veto placed Johnson in a situation in\r\nwhich a collision was almost sure to come. As the chief executive of the\r\ncountry he was charged with the duty of carrying out the provisions of the\r\nreconstruction acts, notwithstanding his strong personal repugnance to\r\nthem. Under the advice of Attorney-General Stanbery he had construed the\r\nacts literally, and he had thus frustrated in part the object of the\r\nlegislation. But the co-operation of the army was necessary, and\r\nunfortunately for President Johnson, the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton,\r\nstrongly opposed his views, and conducted himself as far as possible in\r\naccordance with the wishes of the congressional majority. The continued\r\nfriction between the President and the Secretary of War seemed to\r\nPresident Johnson to necessitate Stanton's retirement, but repeated hints\r\nto that effect were not recognized by the latter. Finally, on August 5,\r\n1867, the President informed him that \"public considerations of a high\r\ncharacter constrained\" him to say that his resignation would be accepted.\r\nThe Secretary's prompt reply was that \"public considerations of a high\r\ncharacter\" constrained him not to resign until the next session of\r\nCongress. A week later, August 12, the President formally suspended him\r\nand appointed General Grant Secretary _ad interim_.[188] Stanton then\r\nsubmitted \"under protest to superior force.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December the President reported his suspension of\r\nStanton, and after long discussion the Senate, on January 13, 1868,\r\nrefused to concur.[189] When informed of this action of the Senate,\r\nGeneral Grant immediately turned over the Secretary's office to Stanton,\r\nthus definitely committing himself to the congressional interpretation of\r\nthe law. Grant's action was a sore disappointment to the President.\r\nJohnson had refused to accept the Tenure-of-Office Act as constitutional,\r\nand had purposed to make this a test case. In the correspondence which\r\npassed between him and General Grant after the latter's acquiescence in\r\nthe action of the Senate, Johnson claimed that it was understood that\r\nGrant was either to refuse to give up the office to Stanton, or, if he\r\nshould be unwilling to take so prominent a part in the contest, to resign\r\nand permit the office to be filled with some one whose views agreed with\r\nthe President's, so that Stanton, if he sought to regain the office, might\r\nbe compelled to resort to the courts. In this way the constitutionality of\r\nthe act could be tested. Johnson's statements as to the understanding with\r\nGrant were substantially endorsed by the Cabinet, on the strength of a\r\nconversation between Johnson and Grant at a cabinet meeting. Grant,\r\nhowever, firmly denied that there was any such agreement or\r\nunderstanding.[190]\r\n\r\nA few days after Stanton had resumed his duties as Secretary of War, the\r\nPresident sought to put in operation a plan for rendering his possession\r\nof the office ineffective. On January 19, he ordered General Grant, in\r\ncharge of the army, to disregard all of Stanton's orders unless he knew\r\ndirectly from the President that they were the latter's orders.[191] The\r\norder was repeated in writing at Grant's request on January 29. On the\r\nfollowing day, Grant refused to carry it out, declaring that an order from\r\nSecretary Stanton would be considered satisfactory evidence that it was\r\nauthorized by the Executive.[192] This correspondence between Johnson and\r\nGrant was subsequently called for by Congress, and an attempt was made to\r\nframe articles of impeachment on the ground that the President was\r\ninstructing Grant to disobey the orders of his superior. Careful\r\nexamination of the legal bearings of the question convinced a majority of\r\nthe Reconstruction Committee that nothing would be gained by inserting\r\ncharges based on this correspondence. The President had shrewdly worded\r\nhis communication so as not to violate any legal technicalities.[193]\r\n\r\nHaving failed in his first two attacks upon Stanton, Johnson finally\r\nresorted to a still stronger measure. Completely ignoring the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act, he addressed a letter to Stanton, February 21,\r\nremoving him from office, and directing him to transfer all the property\r\nof the War Department to Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. Thomas, having\r\nreceived his appointment as secretary _ad interim_, proceeded to the\r\noffice and formally demanded possession. Stanton avoided giving a direct\r\nanswer to the demand, and on the following morning Gen. Thomas was\r\narrested for violation of the Tenure-of-Office Act. After bail had been\r\nprocured he renewed his demand, but Stanton ignored his appointment.\r\nSeveral plans were devised by the President and Thomas' lawyers to make\r\nthe contest center around Thomas, but the congressional managers decided\r\nto drop the matter, and concentrate their energies upon a presidential\r\nimpeachment.[194]\r\n\r\nThe last step of the President opened the way for immediate action.\r\nViolation of the Tenure-of-Office Act was explicitly declared an\r\nimpeachable offense, and as to the flagrancy of its violation by the order\r\nof February 21 there could be no question. Many of the wavering\r\nRepublicans now had their doubts of the expediency of impeachment cleared\r\naway, and on February 24 the resolution formally impeaching the President\r\nof \"high crimes and misdemeanors in office\" was passed.[195]\r\n\r\n9. On March 2, the first nine articles of impeachment were adopted; two\r\nadditional articles were added on the 3d; and on the 4th they were\r\npresented to the Senate. On March 30, the trial began. The articles\r\ncharged the President with high crimes and misdemeanors in respect of the\r\norder for the removal of Stanton, the appointment of Thomas as Secretary\r\nof War _ad interim_, the attempt to hinder Stanton in the exercise of his\r\nlawful duties, the wilful violation of the Tenure-of-Office Act, the\r\nattempt to seize the properties of the War Department, the attempt\r\nunlawfully to disburse moneys through the appointment of Thomas, an\r\nattempt to make General Emory violate the Tenure-of-Office Act, the\r\nattempt to injure the good reputation of the legislative department by\r\nspeeches delivered at various specified places, and his determined\r\nopposition to the reconstruction policy as outlined in the various acts of\r\nCongress.[196]\r\n\r\nThese articles were very sweeping, and were designed as a sort of drag-net\r\nto include all of the complaints which could possibly be brought against\r\nthe President. Yet the House of Representatives, previous to the attempted\r\nremoval of Secretary Stanton, after the most searching examination into\r\nthe President's record, had failed to find sufficient ground on which to\r\nbase an impeachment. Therefore the only charges that deserved really\r\nserious attention were those growing out of the violation of the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act. In the President's reply to the charges he explains\r\nhis attitude on this matter. In his opinion the Tenure-of-Office Act was\r\nunconstitutional. The very fact that he as Executive was legally held\r\nresponsible for the acts of the Secretary of War made it necessary for him\r\nto exercise the power of removal or of indefinite suspension. He had at\r\nfirst complied with the letter of the act in order to avoid a further\r\nstruggle with Congress; but, having been frustrated by Congress in his\r\ndesign, the only alternative that remained to him, in view of his strained\r\nrelations with the Secretary of War, was the latter's unconditional\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\n10. The President's case, as to the constitutionality of his action and\r\nthe unconstitutionality of the Tenure-of-Office Act, was strong, and was\r\npresented with great ability by the President's counsel. But, from the\r\nvery beginning, it was obvious that the case would be determined mainly on\r\npolitical lines.\r\n\r\nIf the Republican party could hold all the Republican Senators to the\r\ndecision of the majority, a verdict of guilty was assured. Consequently,\r\nthe strongest efforts were made to bring all into line. But some proved\r\nrecalcitrant. The prospect that the President of the United States was to\r\nbe forced out of his office as a punishment for his opposition to the\r\nLegislative Department was not edifying. Hitherto the presidential office\r\nhad possessed great dignity. To be sure, Johnson's conduct had gone far\r\ntowards the destruction of that dignity, but a conviction on impeachment\r\ncharges would drag down the office immeasurably. Some of the Senators also\r\nrealized that the tendency of Congress during the whole struggle had been\r\ntowards an encroachment upon the executive powers, and that there was\r\nserious danger that the balance of the governmental system might be\r\ndestroyed. While, therefore, they strongly disapproved of Johnson's\r\nconduct, they felt unwilling to expose the government to the shock which\r\nwould accompany his removal from the presidential chair. The trial\r\nproceeded slowly and the case was ably contested by counsel on both sides;\r\nbut the prosecution was practically brought to a close on May 16, by the\r\nvote which was taken on the eleventh article of impeachment. This article\r\nwas chosen for the first test of strength, because it embodied those\r\ncharges which had caused the most feeling, and which were best calculated\r\nto cause Senators to cast aside judicial restraints and vote according to\r\ntheir prejudices. But, seven Republicans refused to line themselves with\r\nthe radical majority. They and the twelve Democratic Senators voted for\r\nacquittal. Thirty-five Republicans voted \"guilty,\" but this lacked one of\r\nthe needful two-thirds majority. Ten days later another vote was taken on\r\nthe second and third articles, with the same result. The fight was then\r\ngiven up, and the court of impeachment was declared adjourned.\r\n\r\n11. It was a fortunate thing for the country that the attempt failed. The\r\nconvulsions of the Civil War had unsettled most seriously our conceptions\r\nof the relations of the three co-ordinate departments of the government.\r\nLincoln had not hesitated to assume powers totally outside the ordinary\r\nfunctions of the Executive. The country had sustained him in this; but,\r\nwith the return of peace, and with Johnson in the presidential chair,\r\nCongress had determined to resume its powers. Again the country responded,\r\nbut the violence of the reaction caused the pendulum to swing too far in\r\nthe opposite direction; and our institutions were placed in greater danger\r\nthan the were in before. But, just as the Civil War had settled the\r\nquestion as to the indissolubility of the Union, so no less emphatically\r\ndid the failure of the impeachment trial confirm the equality of the three\r\ndepartments of our government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlaine, James G.

The President's action\r\ncaused much dissatisfaction, Davis and Wade publishing a protest which\r\nimpugned Lincoln's motives, declaring that he had committed an outrage on\r\nAmerican legislation. See Johnson, in _Lalor_, iii. 5 and 6; Cox, _Three\r\nDecades_, etc., 341.\r\n\r\n[33] _Senate Journal_, 2d Session, 38th Congress, Feb. 8. Blaine (_Twenty\r\nYears of Congress_, ii, 46) explains that this joint resolution was\r\nintended as a rebuke to the President by the refusal of Congress to accept\r\nthe proclamation of December 8, 1863, as a basis for the restoration of\r\nthe States fulfilling its requirements. He then points out how Lincoln,\r\nwith his usual tact, overthrows what triumph may have accrued to the\r\nleaders of the opposition by explaining that he \"signed the joint\r\nresolution in deference to the view of Congress implied in its passage and\r\npresentation.\" His (Lincoln's) own opinion was that as a matter of course\r\nCongress had complete power to accept or reject electoral votes, and that\r\nthe Executive had no right to interpose with a veto, whatever his own\r\nopinions might be. Blaine says that \"his triumph was complete, both in the\r\nestimation of Congress and of the people.\"\r\n\r\n[34] See Cox, _Three Decades of Federal Legislation_, 123; Johnston, in\r\n_Lalor_, iii, 54; Wilson (Woodrow), _Division and Reunion_, 261-2.\r\n\r\n[35] _Senate Journal_, 2d Session, 37th Congress, pp. 194-6.\r\n\r\n[36] The inconsistency in declaring a State to be extinct, and at the same\r\ntime acknowledging the obligation to guarantee to it a republican form of\r\ngovernment, is due to careless phraseology. Obviously Sumner uses the word\r\n\"State,\" in these resolutions, where he means state governments.\r\n\r\n[37] _Congressional Globe_, 1st Session, 38th Congress, part ii, p. 2041.\r\nSee also his remarks on the Confiscation bill.

S._, pp. 333-337, for a discussion of\r\nJohnson's policy and mistakes from the Democratic standpoint.\r\n\r\n[45] Mr. Blaine in his _Twenty Years of Congress_, vol. ii, pp. 63-70,\r\nascribes the apparently great modification of Johnson's attitude towards\r\nthe South to two causes: First, the personal influence of Seward; second,\r\nthe flattery of Southern leaders. He assumes Johnson to have been\r\nthoroughly determined to carry out a harsh policy of reconstruction, and\r\npoints out that of the six members of the Cabinet, excluding Mr. Seward,\r\nthree were radical and three conservative in their views, offsetting each\r\nother in their influence upon Johnson. He then calls attention to the fact\r\nthat Mr. Seward's most conspicuous faculty was the power to convince\r\nlisteners against their will through his personal conversation with them.\r\nWith this remarkable faculty he believes Mr. Seward to have deliberately\r\nsettled down to the task of reversing the President's views as to\r\nreconstruction. \"Equipped with these rare endowments,\" he says, \"it is not\r\nstrange that Mr. Seward made a deep impression upon the mind of the\r\nPresident. In conflicts of opinion the superior mind, the subtle address,\r\nthe fixed purpose, the gentle yet strong will, must in the end prevail.\"\r\nMr. Seward's fervent pleadings, Blaine thinks, caused a marked change in\r\nJohnson's beliefs, and inclined him to look favorably upon the glory of a\r\nmerciful, lenient administration. The leaders in the South, quickly\r\nnoticing the change in Johnson's attitude, took advantage of the\r\nopportunity, and by judicious flattery completed the work which Seward had\r\nbegun, and placed Johnson before the world as the ardent champion of\r\nimmediate restoration. The theory impresses one with its apparent\r\nreasonableness, but as Mr. Blaine produces no evidence beyond his own\r\nauthority, one is inclined to look upon it as an ingenious explanation\r\nbased upon the environment of Johnson. Doubtless Seward presented his view\r\non the situation with his accustomed ability, and probably it influenced\r\nJohnson's view to a certain extent. The second part of the supposition can\r\nalso readily be granted--that the vanity of Johnson was played upon by\r\nthose whose flattery was most pleasing to one who had sprung from the\r\nranks of those accustomed to be dictated to and spurned by these same men.\r\nYet to ascribe the adoption of so important a policy, affecting all the\r\nfundamental principles upon which strict and loose constructionists are\r\ndivided, to these influences, appears to be a superficial judgment based\r\nupon opinions formed in the heat of the struggle, when extraneous\r\ninfluences are always given undue prominence by the participants. The\r\nwhole career of Johnson proves the logical exactness with which he\r\nfollowed strict construction dogma in all points excepting the doctrine of\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\n[46] McPherson, _Hist. of Recon._, 45, 46\r\n\r\n[47] The repudiation of the Sherman-Johnston agreement of April 18th was\r\nof a negative character, and did not commit the administration to any\r\npolicy. Coming, as it did, so shortly after his inauguration, it was taken\r\nby those expecting harsh measures from the President as an indication of\r\nsuch a policy. An examination of the circumstances, however, shows that\r\nJohnson was merely following the policy supposed to have been adopted by\r\nLincoln, and evidenced by instructions sent to Grant on March 3 in regard\r\nto a proposed conference with Lee. Stephens' charge (_War between the\r\nStates_, ii, 632), that Johnson was bound to ratify the agreement as\r\nconsistent with the Crittenden Resolution of 1861, is inadmissible.\r\nGenerals in the field manifestly have no right to decide momentous\r\npolitical questions. For a copy of the Sherman-Johnston agreement, and the\r\nofficial dispatch giving particulars of its disapproval, see McPherson,\r\n_Hist. of Recon._, 121-2.\r\n\r\n[48] McPherson, p. 13-14.\r\n\r\n[49] McPherson, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[50] See Appendix; Savage, _Life and Public Services of Andrew Johnson_,\r\n370-373.\r\n\r\n[51] Blaine, ii, 70-76, ascribes this amnesty proclamation to the personal\r\ninfluence of Mr. Seward, who favored all but the 13th excepted class\r\n(property holders above $20,000). This certainly offers a good explanation\r\nof the promptness of his action, and is not inconsistent with the theory\r\nof Johnson's attitude as outlined above.\r\n\r\n[52] McPherson, p. 11; Blaine, ii, 77, 78.\r\n\r\n[53] Tennessee, of course, having been reorganized during Lincoln's\r\nadministration, under the direction of Military Governor Johnson, cannot\r\nbe considered in connection with Johnson's policy as President. Louisiana\r\nand Arkansas also retained their reorganized governments until the\r\nreconstruction acts took effect. See Blaine, ii, 79, 80.\r\n\r\n[54] The phraseology differed in the different States, depending upon the\r\nsensitiveness and pride of the legislature.\r\n\r\n[55] McPherson, _Reconst._, 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[56] McPherson, _Reconst._, 49.\r\n\r\n[57] _Ibid._, 51-2.\r\n\r\n[58] McPherson, 20.\r\n\r\n[59] _Ibid._, 21-2.\r\n\r\n[60] McPherson, 43; Blaine, ii, 102-3.\r\n\r\n[61] See _Why the Solid South_, edited by Hilary A.

The work before Congress was well expressed by Schuyler\r\nColfax in his speech made upon taking the Speaker's chair. Speaking of\r\nCongress he said: \"Representing, in its two branches, the States and the\r\npeople, its first and highest obligation is to guarantee to every State a\r\nrepublican form of government. The rebellion having overthrown\r\nconstitutional State governments in many States, it is yours to mature and\r\nenact legislation which, with the concurrence of the Executive, shall\r\nestablish them anew on such a basis of enduring justice as will guarantee\r\nall the necessary safeguards to the people, and afford what our Magna\r\nCharta, the Declaration of Independence, proclaims is the chief object of\r\ngovernment--protection to all men in their inalienable rights. * * * *\r\nThen we may hope to see the vacant and once abandoned seats around us\r\ngradually filling up, until this hall shall contain representatives from\r\nevery State and district; their hearts devoted to the Union for which they\r\nare to legislate, jealous of its honor, proud of its glory, watchful of\r\nits rights, and hostile to its enemies.\" _Congressional Globe_, 39th\r\nCongress, 1st Session, p. 5. See Blaine, _Twenty Years of Congress_, ii,\r\n111, 112.\r\n\r\n[65] Among the Senators elected were Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President\r\nof the Confederacy, and H. V.

Mortification caused\r\nby abuse, as the result of his action, is supposed to have unbalanced him\r\nmentally. _Cf._, Blaine, ii, 185.\r\n\r\n[71] The resolution as adopted by the House on the 4th contained in\r\naddition: \"and until such report shall have been made, and finally acted\r\nupon by Congress, no member shall be received into either House from any\r\nof the so-called Confederate States, and all papers relating to the\r\nrepresentation of the said States shall be referred to the said committee\r\nwithout debate.\" The Senate, however, considered such provisions to affect\r\npowers granted to each House separately, and which should not be entrusted\r\nto a joint committee. Therefore they were struck out, but on December 14\r\nthe House of Representatives passed resolutions binding itself to be\r\ngoverned by similar principles.\r\n\r\n[72] The other members of the committee were: on the part of the Senate,\r\nHoward of Michigan, Grimes of Iowa, Harris of New York, Williams of\r\nOregon, and Johnson of Maryland; on the part of the House, Washburne of\r\nIllinois, Morrill of Vermont, Grider of Kentucky, Bingham of Ohio,\r\nConkling of New York, Boutwell of Massachusetts, Blow of Missouri, and\r\nRogers of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n[73] Blaine, _Twenty Years of Congress_, ii, 115.\r\n\r\n[74] Wilson, _History of the Reconstruction Measures_, 42-105, contains a\r\nsummary of the debates on reconstruction; see also Blaine, _Twenty Years\r\nof Congress_, ii, 128 ff.\r\n\r\n[75] _Congressional Globe_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, pp. 72-5.\r\n\r\n[76] _Congressional Globe_, 1st Session, 39th Congress, p. 1019.\r\n\r\n[77] _Congressional Globe_, 1st Session, 39th Congress, p. 1309. These\r\nstrong statements of the advisability of confiscation alarmed the Southern\r\nStates greatly, and caused them to hate and fear Thaddeus Stevens. See\r\nLalor, iii, 546 ff. The following extract from General Taylor's\r\n_Destruction and Reconstruction_ (pp. 243-4), is characteristic of the\r\nSouthern estimate of the man. General Taylor had occasion to call upon\r\nStevens while endeavoring to get permission to visit Jefferson Davis, then\r\nin confinement at Fortress Monroe. He goes on to say: \"Thaddeus Stevens\r\nreceived me with as much civility as he was capable of. Deformed in body\r\nand temper like Caliban, this was the Lord Hategood of the fair; but he\r\nwas frankness itself. He wanted no restoration of the Union under the\r\nConstitution, which he called a worthless bit of old parchment. The white\r\npeople of the South ought never again to be trusted with power, for they\r\nwould inevitably unite with the Northern 'Copperheads' and control the\r\ngovernment. The only sound policy was to confiscate the lands and divide\r\nthem among the negroes, to whom, sooner or later, suffrage must be given.\r\nTouching the matter in hand, Johnson was a fool to have captured Davis,\r\nwhom it would have been wiser to assist in escaping. Nothing would be done\r\nwith him, as the Executive had only pluck enough to hang poor devils, such\r\nas Wirz and Mrs. Surratt. Had the leading traitors been promptly strung\r\nup, well; but the time for that had passed. (Here, I thought, he looked\r\nlovingly at my neck, as Petit Andre was wont to do at those of his\r\nmerry-go-rounds.)\"\r\n\r\n[78] _Congressional Globe_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, p. 1476.\r\n\r\n[79] _Congressional Globe_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, p. 1616.\r\n\r\n[80] _Ibid._, p. 1617.\r\n\r\n[81] _Ibid._, p. 1828.\r\n\r\n[82] _Congressional Globe_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[83] _Ibid._, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[84] _Congressional Globe_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, p. 1169.\r\n\r\n[85] _Ibid._, p. 2256.\r\n\r\n[86] Gillet's _Democracy in the United States_, pp. 309-13, discusses the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau from the Northern Democratic standpoint.\r\n\r\n[87] The first bill creating a Freedmen's Bureau was introduced in the\r\nHouse during the 37th Congress by Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, who during\r\nthe 39th Congress was chairman of the Select Committee on Freedmen. It was\r\nnot reported, but the same bill was presented in the first session of the\r\n38th Congress, and passed the House by a vote of 69 to 67. It was returned\r\nfrom the Senate on June 30, 1864, amended so as to attach the Bureau to\r\nthe Treasury Department. A committee of conference agreed upon a new bill\r\ncreating a department of freedmen's affairs, reporting to the President.\r\nThis passed the House, but failed in the Senate. The next attempt\r\nsucceeded. _Congressional Globe_, 2d Session, 38th Congress, p. 1307. See\r\nCox's _Three Decades of Federal Legislation_ for an account of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau; also Wilson, _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in\r\nAmerica_, iii, 472-485; Wilson (Woodrow), _Division and Reunion_, 263.\r\n\r\n[88] _Congressional Globe_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, p. 1299. Mr.\r\nDoolittle on the 19th of December, 1865, had introduced a bill relative to\r\nthe Bureau of Freedmen, but when reported from the Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, to which it had been referred, it was indefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\n[89] This committee had been established by a resolution introduced by Mr.\r\nEliot, of Massachusetts, on December 6, 1865. So much of the President's\r\nmessage as related to freedmen, and all papers relating to the same\r\nsubject, were to be referred to it. The following were appointed members\r\nof the committee: T. D. Eliot of Massachusetts, W. D. Kelley of\r\nPennsylvania, G. S. Orth of Indiana, J. A. Bingham of Ohio, Nelson Taylor\r\nof New York, B. F. Loan of Missouri, J. B. Grinnell of Iowa, H. E.

Blaine, _Twenty\r\nYears of Congress_, ii, 172, states that the bill was far less popular\r\nthan the measure vetoed on February 19. \"It required potent persuasion,\r\nre-enforced by the severest exercise of party discipline, to prevent a\r\nserious break in both Houses against the bill.\"\r\n\r\n[97] McPherson, _History of the Reconstruction_, 52-56.\r\n\r\n[98] _House journal_, 39th Congress, 1st Session, 300, 315. The resolution\r\nwas carried particularly to silence the Tennessee claimants for\r\nrecognition. The somewhat anomalous position of that State gave grounds\r\nfor the argument that it should be classed in the same category with the\r\nother Southern States.

The following is a good example of the manner in\r\nwhich Johnson lowered himself to the level of the disorderly element, who\r\nmade a bedlam out of some of the meetings he attended. The extract is from\r\nthe Cleveland speech: \"Who can come and place his finger on one pledge I\r\never violated, or one principle I ever proved false to? (A voice, 'How\r\nabout New Orleans?' Another voice, 'Hang Jeff Davis.') Hang Jeff Davis, he\r\nsays. (Cries of 'No' and 'Down with him!') Hang Jeff Davis, he says. (A\r\nvoice, 'Hang Thad. Stevens and Wendell Phillips.') Hang Jeff Davis. Why\r\ndon't you hang him? (Cries of 'Give us the opportunity.') Have you not got\r\nthe court? Have not you got the Attorney General? (A voice, 'Who is your\r\nChief Justice who has refused to sit upon the trial?' Cheers.) I am not\r\nthe Chief Justice. I am not the prosecuting attorney. (Cheers.) I am not\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you what I did do. I called upon your Congress that is trying\r\nto break up the government. (Cries, 'You be d--d!' and cheers mingled with\r\nhisses. Great confusion. 'Don't get mad, Andy.') Well, I will tell you who\r\nis mad. 'Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.' Did your\r\nCongress order them to be tried?
