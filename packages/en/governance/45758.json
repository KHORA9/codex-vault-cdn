O. L. B.#\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nNo very extensive changes are made in the new edition. The chart of\r\nearly radical labor organizations, which appeared in the first edition\r\nas Appendix I, has been omitted in this edition. There is reproduced\r\nin its place a copy of the original industrial organization chart\r\nprepared by \"Father\" T. J. Hagerty at the time of the launching of\r\nthe I. W. W. in 1905 and sometimes referred to as \"Father Hagerty's\r\nWheel of Fortune\". This chart is believed to be of some importance\r\nas illustrating the earlier ideas of the revolutionary industrial\r\nunionists on industrial organization in relation to union structure.\r\nIt has been considerably amplified by W. E. Trautmann and published in\r\nhis pamphlet _One Great Union_, and still further developed by James\r\nRobertson who has very recently built extensions upon it in furtherance\r\nof the shop-steward propaganda in the Pacific Northwest. His version is\r\npublished in a pamphlet entitled _Labor unionism and the American shop\r\nsteward system_ (Portland, Oreg., 1919).\r\n\r\nThe organization held its eleventh national convention in Chicago in\r\nMay, 1919. This was the first convention held since December, 1916.\r\nIt was attended by fifty-four delegates and it has been reported that\r\nforty-eight of them had never before attended a general convention\r\nof the organization. The General Executive Board reported that the\r\norganization in 1919 comprised fourteen Industrial Unions, each with\r\nits locals in various parts of the country, and a General Recruiting\r\nUnion, with a total membership of 35,000. Since the convention it is\r\nreported that three new Industrial Unions have been formed: an Oil\r\nWorkers' Industrial Union, a Coal Miners' Union and a Fishery Workers'\r\nUnion. Nearly fifty amendments to the constitution were adopted by the\r\ndelegates at the May convention. Most if not all of these have been\r\nsince approved in a referendum to the membership. The proceedings of\r\nthe convention have not yet been published. Since the first edition of\r\nthis book appeared the I. W. W. has launched a monthly magazine called\r\n_The One Big Union Monthly_ and several new weekly newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe writer's attention has been called to the erroneous statement (on\r\npage 235) in regard to Daniel DeLeon's theory of industrial unionism.\r\nThis has been revised to accord with the facts. There is added on page\r\n241 some interesting comment from Lenin, the Bolshevik premier of\r\nRussia, on DeLeon and on the relation between revolutionary industrial\r\nunionism, and the soviet system in Russia.\r\n\r\n                                              P. F. BRISSENDEN\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., SEPTEMBER, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a descriptive and historical sketch of the present drift from\r\nparliamentary to industrial socialism--as epitomized in the career of\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World in the United States. The I. W.\r\nW. is now thirteen years old. During the first half of its existence\r\nthe general public hardly knew that there was such an organization.\r\nA few local communities, however, were startled into an awareness of\r\nit quite early in its history. The city of Spokane had an I. W. W.\r\n\"free-speech fight\" on its hands in 1909. Fresno, California, McKees\r\nRocks, Pennsylvania, and Missoula, Montana, all had their little bouts\r\nwith the \"Wobblies\" long before the Lawrence strike of 1912 made the I.\r\nW. W. nationally prominent.\r\n\r\nJust now the Industrial Workers of the World, as represented by more\r\nthan one hundred of its members and officials, is on trial for its\r\nlife in Chicago. The indictment charges the defendants with conspiring\r\nto hinder and discourage enlistment and in general to obstruct the\r\nprogress of the war with Germany. The specific number of crimes alleged\r\nto have been intended runs up to more than seventeen thousand. Since\r\nthe war-time activities of the I. W. W. most concern us now, it is\r\nregretted that this book cannot be brought up to the minute with a\r\nfinal chapter on the I. W. W. and the war. But this is impossible. The\r\ntrial is still in progress and almost no trustworthy evidence regarding\r\nthe alleged anti-war activities is available outside of the court\r\nrecords.[1]\r\n\r\nThough nowadays well aware of the existence of the I. W. W., the\r\npublic still knows little about the organization and its members.\r\nMoreover, a great deal of what it does know is false. For thirteen\r\nyears the I. W. W. has been rather consistently misrepresented--not\r\nto say vilified--to the American people. The public has not been told\r\nthe truth about the things the I. W. W. has done or the doctrines in\r\nwhich it believes. The papers have printed so much fiction about this\r\norganization and maintained such a nation-wide conspiracy of silence as\r\nto its real philosophy--especially as to the constructive items of this\r\nphilosophy--that the popular conception of this labor group is a weird\r\nunreality.\r\n\r\nThe current picture is of a motley horde of hoboes and unskilled\r\nlaborers who will not work and whose philosophy is a philosophy simply\r\nof _sabotage_ and the violent overthrow of \"capitalism,\" and whose\r\nactions conform to that philosophy. This appears to be about what\r\nthe more reactionary business interests would like to have the people\r\nbelieve about the Industrial Workers of the World. If, and to the\r\nextent that these reactionary employing interests can induce the public\r\nnot only to believe this about the I. W. W. but also to believe that\r\nthe picture applies as well to all labor organizations, they will to\r\nthat extent ally the public with them and against labor.\r\n\r\nThe negative or destructive items in the I. W. W. program are\r\ndeliberately misconstrued and then stretched out and made to constitute\r\nthe whole of I. W. W.-ism. In reality they are only a minor part of\r\nthe creed. There are immense possibilities of a constructive sort in\r\nthe theoretic basis of the I. W. W., but the Press has done its best\r\nto prevent the public from knowing it. And it must be said that the\r\nI. W. W. agitators have themselves helped to misrepresent their own\r\norganization by their uncouth and violent language and their personal\r\npredilection for the lurid and the dramatic. Even what the Wobblies\r\nsay about themselves must be taken with a certain amount of salt. This\r\nmatter of the currently-received opinion of the I. W. W. has been dwelt\r\non because the writer believes that it is not alone important to know\r\nwhat an organization is like; it is also very important to know what\r\npeople _think_ it is like.\r\n\r\nThe popular attitude toward the Wobblies among employers, public\r\nofficials and the public generally corresponds to the popular notion\r\nthat they are arch-fiends and the dregs of society. It is the\r\nhang-them-all-at-sunrise attitude. A high official of the Federal\r\nDepartment of Justice in one of our western states gave the writer\r\nan instance. On a recent visit to a small town in a distant part of\r\nthe state he happened upon the sheriff. That officer, in reply to a\r\nquestion, explained that they were \"having no trouble at all with the\r\nWobs.\" \"When a Wobbly comes to town,\" he explained, \"I just knock him\r\nover the head with a night stick and throw him in the river. When he\r\ncomes up he beats it out of town.\" Incidentally it may be said that in\r\nsuch a situation almost any poor man, if he be without a job or visible\r\nmeans of support, is assumed to be, _ipso facto_, an I. W. W. Being a\r\nWobbly, the proper thing for him is pick-handle treatment or--if he is\r\nknown to be a strike agitator--a \"little neck-tie party.\"\r\n\r\nSince we have been at war certain groups of employers, particularly\r\nthose in the mining and lumber industries, have still further confused\r\nthe issue and intensified the popular hostility to the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World. They have done this by re-enforcing their earlier\r\n_camouflage_ with the charge of disloyalty and anti-patriotism.\r\nWrapping themselves in the flag, they have pointed from its folds\r\nto \"those disloyal and anarchistic Wobblies\" and in this way still\r\nfurther obscured the underlying economic issues. Whatever the facts\r\nabout patriotism on either side, it appears to be true that the\r\ngreater part of the I. W. W.'s activities have been ordinary strike\r\nactivities directed toward the securing of more favorable conditions\r\nof employment and some voice in the determination of those conditions.\r\nThese efforts have been met by charges of disloyalty and by wholesale\r\nacts of violence by the employers, that is to say, they have been met\r\nby the night-stick and neck-tie party policy--as witness the wholesale\r\ndeportation of \"alleged Wobblies\" from Bisbee, Arizona, and the hanging\r\nof Frank Little in Butte, Montana. As the President's Mediation\r\nCommission reported, \"the hold of the I. W. W. is riveted, instead of\r\nweakened, by unimaginative opposition on the part of employers to the\r\ncorrection of real grievances.\"[2]\r\n\r\nBy means of an insidious extension of the I. W. W. bogey idea, either\r\nthat organization itself or some other labor body or both of them are\r\nmade the \"goat\" in disputes in which the I. W. W., as an organization,\r\nhas no part. If a lumber company, for example, gets into a controversy\r\nwith the shingle-weavers union of the American Federation of Labor, it\r\nhas only to raise a _barrage_ and shout through its controlled news\r\ncolumns that \"they are 'Wobblies!'\" and public opinion is against them.\r\nNor does the misrepresentation stop there. All who openly sympathize\r\nwith the alleged Wobblies are, forsooth, themselves Wobblies!\r\n\r\nNaturally the liberals in this country have no sympathy with this\r\nnight-stick attitude toward I. W. W.'s nor with the night-stick\r\ninterpretation of I. W. W.-ism. The writer is bound to say, however,\r\nthat he considers the liberal interpretation entirely inadequate. The\r\nliberal attitude is expressed and judgment pronounced when it has\r\nbeen said that the I. W. W. is a social sore caused by, let us say,\r\nbad housing. It must be evident (unless we are prepared to take the\r\nposition that any organization which purposes a rearrangement of the\r\n_status quo_--the Single Tax League, for example--is a social sore)\r\nthat the I. W. W. is much more than that. The improvement of working\r\nconditions in the mines and lumber camps would tend to eliminate the\r\ncruder and less fundamental I. W. W. activities, but it would not kill\r\nI. W. W.-ism.\r\n\r\nWe can no more dispose of the Industrial Workers of the World by saying\r\nthat it is a social sore on the body politic than we can dispose of\r\nthe British Labor Party or our National Security League by saying\r\nthat they are sores on the Anglo-Saxon body politic. We can only\r\ncompletely and fairly handle the I. W. W. problem by dealing with its\r\nmore fundamental tenets on their merits and acting courageously upon\r\nour conclusions. We shall be obliged seriously to study the problem of\r\nthe organization of the unskilled; the question of the relative merits\r\nof craft unionism, mass unionism and industrial unionism; the question\r\nof the sufficiency of political democracy and of the possible future\r\nmodifications of it and, not least, the question of democracy _versus_\r\ndespotism in our economic and industrial life. The Wobblies insist\r\nthat no genuine democracy is possible in industry until those who do\r\nthe work in a business (from hired president to hired common laborer)\r\ncontrol its management. It so happens that the British Labor Party, in\r\nits reconstruction report on _Labor and the New Social Order_, insists\r\nupon practically the same thing. The fact that the B.L.P. insisted in\r\na more refined and intelligent manner than the I. W. W. may explain\r\nthe almost universal obliviousness of our liberals to this item in I.\r\nW. W.-ism. The Industrial Workers of the World have even developed a\r\nstructure and mechanism (crude and inadequate, naturally) for this\r\ncontrol. The industrial union, they say, is to be the administrative\r\nunit in the future industrial democracy. All these will be dominant\r\nissues when peace breaks out, and if the Wobblies are no longer in\r\nexistence the radical end of each issue will be championed by their\r\nsuccessors in the field.\r\n\r\nThe most important item in the affirmative part of the I. W. W. program\r\nis this demand that some of our democracy--some of our representative\r\ngovernment--be extended from political into economic life. They ask\r\nthat industry be democratized by giving the workers--all grades of\r\nworkers--exclusive control in its management. They ask to have the\r\nmanagement of industrial units transferred from the hands of those who\r\nthink chiefly in terms of income to those who think primarily in terms\r\nof the productive process. The Wobblies would have \"capitalism\" (the\r\nmonarchic or oligarchic control of industry) supplanted by economic\r\ndemocracy just as political despotism has been supplanted by political\r\ndemocracy in nearly all civilized states. When the British Labor Party\r\nasks for representative government in industry, those who do not ignore\r\nthe request give it serious attention. When the I. W. W. echoes the\r\nsentiment in the phrase: \"Let the workers run the industries,\" the\r\neditors are thrown into a panic, the business world views the I. W.\r\nW. menace with aggravated alarm and the more reactionary employers\r\nhysterically clamor to have \"these criminal anarchists shot at sunrise.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the very best way to run an industrial enterprise is on the\r\ncurrently accepted model of the Prussian State. It is simply a moot\r\npoint and the I. W. W. has challenged the Prussian method. Whatever\r\nintrinsic merit there may be in the affirmative program of the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World, it must be admitted by even its most\r\nenthusiastic members that were they today given the power they ask,\r\nthey would be no less relentless Prussians than are the corporations\r\nwe have with us. Even though capitalism may be ripe for replacement,\r\nthe I. W. W. are a long way from being fit to replace it. The Wobblies\r\nare grotesquely unprepared for responsibility. So far their own members\r\ndo not understand how relatively unimportant is their much-talked-of\r\n_sabotage_ method. They have challenged the autocratic method, but they\r\nhave done it very crudely and with a weird misplacement of emphasis.\r\nThey whisper it in a footnote, as it were, to their strident blackface\r\nstatements about method. \"If labor is not allowed a voice in the\r\nmanagement of the mines--apply _sabotage_!\"\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the I. W. W. ask too much when they ask that the\r\nproducers be given _exclusive_ control of industry. As to certain\r\nphases of management the workers (including, of course, all hand and\r\nbrain workers connected with the industry) should perhaps be given\r\nentire control. The hours of labor and the sanitary conditions in any\r\nproductive enterprise are primarily, if not exclusively, the concern of\r\nthe producers. But the amount of the product which ought to be turned\r\nout and the price at which it ought to be sold are matters in which the\r\nconsumers have no little interest. Consumers, therefore, should share\r\nin the management of the industry so far as it relates to prices and\r\nthe determination of the amount to be produced.\r\n\r\nThe following pages are devoted to a mere matter-of-fact description\r\nof the Industrial Workers of the World as an organization and to a\r\nrecord of the facts of its history. The purpose has been throughout to\r\nwrite from the sources. The writer has tried to have the \"Wobblies\"\r\nthemselves do the telling, through interviews, soap-box speeches,\r\nconvention proceedings and official papers and pamphlets. The bulk of\r\nthe record is based upon documents and other materials collected and\r\nimpressions received since 1909 when the writer first became interested\r\nin the I. W. W.\r\n\r\nThe writer has endeavored throughout to abstain from philosophizing\r\nabout the I. W. W. He is not unmindful of the fact that the\r\ninterpretation of such a significant movement as is embodied in\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World is of very great importance.\r\nIndeed the time has now come when it is urgently necessary. The\r\nfirst intention in writing this book was to incorporate in it an\r\nattempt at an analysis and interpretation of I. W. W.-ism, as well as\r\nits orientation with other economic isms. But the bony skeleton of\r\nhistorical record has crowded out almost everything else and perhaps\r\nfilled more pages than its importance justifies. In spite of all this\r\nthe temptation to comment has been strong and sometimes irresistible.\r\nDespite the effort that has been made to be accurate and entirely fair\r\nthe writer realizes that the book probably contains errors both of fact\r\nand judgment. He would greatly appreciate having his attention called\r\nto these.\r\n\r\nThe writer is under great obligation to the secretaries of scores of\r\nthe local unions of the organization in various parts of the country\r\nfor their valued assistance in the task of gathering the material for\r\nthis study. He is especially grateful to Mr. Vincent St. John, formerly\r\nGeneral Secretary-Treasurer of the I. W. W., for his generous response\r\nto repeated requests for documents and information. Thanks are also due\r\nfor like favors to Mr. William D. Haywood, General Secretary-Treasurer\r\nof the I. W. W. and to Mr. Herman Richter, General Secretary-Treasurer\r\nof the Workers International Industrial Union (formerly the Socialist\r\nLabor Party or Detroit wing of the I. W. W.). Finally the writer wishes\r\nto express his grateful appreciation of the numerous and helpful\r\nsuggestions made during the later stages of the work by Professor\r\nHenry R. Seager of Columbia University. He has also to thank Professor\r\nSeager and Mrs. C. A. Stewart for their kindness in the tiresome work\r\nof reading the proof, and Mrs. M. A. Gadsby, of the staff of the\r\nUnited States Bureau of Labor Statistics, for her assistance in the\r\npreparation of the Bibliography.\r\n\r\n                                                               P. F. B.\r\n\r\n  SAN FRANCISCO, JUNE 9, 1918.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Since this went to press the trial has come to an end. On August 17\r\nthe case went to the jury which, after being out fifty-five minutes,\r\nreturned a verdict of \"guilty, as charged in the indictment.\" On August\r\n30 Judge K. M. Landis imposed sentence. W. D. Haywood and fourteen\r\nothers were sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and $20,000 fine\r\neach. Thirty-three others were given six years and fined $5,000 each\r\non the first count; ten years and $5,000 each on the second count; two\r\nyears and $10,000 each on the third count; and ten years and $10,000\r\neach on the fourth count. Thirty-three others were given five years\r\nand fines of $5,000 apiece on each of counts 1 and 2 and $10,000 each\r\non counts 3 and 4. Twelve more were sentenced to one year and one day,\r\nwith fines of $5,000 each on the first and second counts and $10,000\r\neach on the third and fourth counts. Two of the defendants were given\r\nten-day sentences. All sentences run concurrently. The fines imposed\r\naggregate $2,570,000 and costs. It is announced that the case will be\r\nappealed. (U. S.

W. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary doctrines of the I. W. W. are spoken of today as\r\nconstituting the \"new unionism\" or the \"new socialism\". It cannot\r\nbe too strongly emphasized, however, that neither I. W. W.-ism nor\r\nthe closely related but materially different French syndicalism are\r\nbrand-new codes which the irreconcilables, here and in France, have\r\ninvented out of hand within the last quarter of a century. Industrial\r\nunionism, as a structural type simply, and even _revolutionary_\r\nindustrial unionism--wherein the industrial organization is animated\r\nand guided by the revolutionary (socialist or anarchist) spirit--hark\r\nback in their essential principles to the dramatic revolutionary period\r\nin English unionism of the second quarter of the nineteenth century.\r\nIn America the labor history of the seventies, and especially the\r\neighties, teems with evidences of the industrial form and the radical\r\ntemper in labor organizations. The elements of I. W. W.-ism were\r\nthere; but they were not often co-existent in the same organization.\r\nContemporary writers have not failed to call attention to the striking\r\nsimilarity between the doctrines of the English Chartists and those\r\nof our modern I. W. W. The bitter attacks of the Industrial Workers\r\nupon politics and politicians and their appeal to all kinds and\r\nconditions of labor were also fundamental articles in the creed of the\r\nChartists--who stressed the economic factor almost as forcibly as do\r\nthe I. W. W.'s today.[3]\r\n\r\nIn both America and England, especially during the periods referred\r\nto, there was abundant evidence of those tactics which we characterize\r\ntoday as syndicalistic. I. W. W. strikes were not invented in 1905.\r\nThe Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the Knights of Labor, the\r\nInternational Working People's Association, the \"New Unionists\" in\r\nthe days of Robert Owen--all these and many another group have sought\r\nto push their cause by methods now once again made notorious by the\r\nFrench syndicalists and the American Wobblies. The general strike--mass\r\naction--the sympathetic strike--the solidarity of all labor--these\r\nconcepts seem to have their prototypes and very possibly were put\r\ninto action in still more ancient periods. Osborne Ward reports some\r\nrevolutionary labor activities in years preceding the Christian era.\r\nHe describes a strike of the silver miners in Greece--at Laurium, some\r\nthirty miles south of Athens. \"The inference is unequivocal,\" says\r\nWard, \"that in 413 B. C. twenty thousand miners, mechanics, teamsters,\r\nand laborers suddenly struck work; and at a moment of Athens' greatest\r\nperil, fought themselves loose from their masters and their chains.\"\r\nHe concludes that the strike \"must have been well concerted, violent\r\nand swift,\" and \"must have been plotted by the men themselves.\"[4] This\r\nstrike, apparently, was widely heralded, but seems to have brought no\r\nmore permanent results than has the average I. W. W. strike of today.\r\nThe evidence for this very ancient prototype of syndicalism is not\r\nentirely conclusive. It was dug out of the old red sandstone--and there\r\nare missing links! It will be safer not to try to trace the lineage\r\nof syndicalist organizations--much less syndicalist activities and\r\nideas--back more than one century.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the idea of _economic_ emancipation through\r\neconomic as opposed to political channels, and to be achieved by\r\n_all_ classes of workers as workers, _i. e._, as human cogs in the\r\nindustrial, rather than the political, state had been very definitely\r\nformulated before the end of the last century.[5] Indeed, the\r\nconception runs back well toward the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The \"one big union\" of which we now hear so much was surely\r\nin existence in England in the early thirties. Robert Owen at that\r\ntime outlined his great plan for a \"General Union of the Productive\r\nClasses.\" Sidney and Beatrice Webb report the establishment, in 1834,\r\nof a \"Grand National Consolidated Trades Union\":\r\n\r\n    Under the system proposed by Owen [they say] the instruments\r\n    of production were to become the property, not of the whole\r\n    community, but of the particular set of workers who used\r\n    them. The trade unions were to be transformed into \"national\r\n    companies\" to carry on all the manufactures. The agricultural\r\n    union was to take possession of the land, the miners' union of\r\n    the mines, the textile unions of the factories. Each trade was\r\n    to be carried on by its particular trade union, centralized in\r\n    one \"Grand Lodge.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the New Unionists \"aimed not at superseding existing\r\nsocial structures but at capturing them in the interests of the wage\r\nearners.\"[7]\r\n\r\nAmerican prototypes of I. W. W.-ism appear much later than in\r\nEngland. As early as 1834, however, workingmen in the United States\r\nwere discussing the attitude of the union toward politics. There was\r\nsome discussion at that time by members of the National Trades Union\r\nof a proposal to have resolutions drawn up to express the views of\r\nthe convention on the social, civil, and political condition of the\r\nlaboring classes, and after considerable argument the word \"political\"\r\nwas omitted.[8]\r\n\r\nIn 1864 an unsuccessful attempt was made to organize in this country a\r\nnational federation of trade unions. Two years later, in Baltimore, a\r\nNational Labor Congress launched a conservative political organization,\r\ncalled the National Labor Union--a short-lived predecessor of the\r\nKnights of Labor. Ely says that it lived only about three years and\r\ndied of the \"disease known as politics.\"[9] It is probable that a\r\ngeneral apathy and financial weakness were contributing causes.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these forerunners of the \"Wobblies\" was the\r\nNoble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor which was organized in\r\n1869 and for the following decades carried on a remarkably successful\r\npropaganda. It had a membership of more than a million in the late\r\neighties.[10] Soon after that the Knights suffered a decline that\r\nwas even more rapid than their meteoric expansion in the early\r\neighties and ultimately broke down and degenerated into the shadow\r\nof an organization that it has been for more than twenty years past.\r\nCarroll D. Wright thought that the Knights of Labor reached its highest\r\nmembership point in 1887 when it had probably about a million enrolled.\r\nIn 1898 there were about 100,000 in the organization. Colonel Wright\r\nbelieved that this great falling-off in membership was due to the\r\nsocialistic tendencies of the organization, especially to the attempt\r\nto place all wage workers on the same level.[11]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic motto of the Knights of Labor was: \"An injury to\r\none is the concern of all\"--the same slogan which is today prominent\r\namong the watchwords of the I. W. W. The Knights proposed, first to\r\nbring within the folds of organization every department of productive\r\nindustry, making knowledge a standpoint for action and \"industrial,\r\nmoral worth, not wealth, the true standard of individual and national\r\ngreatness\"; second, \"to secure to the toilers a proper share of the\r\nwealth that they create ...\"; third, the substitution of arbitration\r\nfor strikes; and, fourth, the reduction of hours of labor to eight per\r\nday.[12] The Knights advocated government ownership of telephones,\r\ntelegraphs, and railroads; emphasized the principle of coöperation;\r\nadmitted women and negroes, and believed in having working-class\r\npolitics in the union and the union in working-class politics.\r\n\"The fundamental principle on which the organization was based was\r\ncoöperation,\" said Grand Master Workman Powderly, \"... the barriers of\r\ntrade were to be cast aside; the man who toiled, no matter at what, was\r\nto receive and enjoy the just fruits of his labor....\"[13]\r\n\r\nIt was originally a secret organization, but that feature was\r\nlater abandoned. The following restriction on membership appears in\r\nthe constitution of the Local Assemblies: \"... no lawyer, banker,\r\nprofessional gambler, or stock broker can be admitted.\" Prior to 1881\r\nphysicians were also excluded. It is composed of Local Assemblies\r\n(local unions) controlled by District Assemblies, a General Assembly\r\nand a Grand Master Workman. These parts were closely related to each\r\nother in a centralized system. Centralization of administrative\r\nauthority was considered highly important--indeed, it was thought\r\nindispensable in order successfully to unite every branch of skilled\r\nand unskilled labor--a task the Knights considered of prime importance.\r\nThey differed, however, from our more radical I. W. W.'s of today in\r\nplacing no little confidence in political methods, maintaining as they\r\ndid for many years a legislative lobbying committee at Washington. In\r\naddition they believed, with the I. W. W., in the sympathetic strike,\r\nthe boycott--and the necessity of solidarity among all the ranks of\r\nlabor. The following excerpt from the _Final Report of the United\r\nStates Industrial Commission_ (1900) explains the administrative policy\r\nof the organization:\r\n\r\n    The fundamental idea of the Knights of Labor is the unity\r\n    of all workers.... It regards this unity of interest as\r\n    necessitating unity of policy and control; it conceives that\r\n    unity of control can be effected only by concentrating all\r\n    responsibility ... in the hands of the men who may be chosen to\r\n    stand at the head of affairs. The control of the organization\r\n    rests wholly in the general assembly, and ... the orders of\r\n    the executive officers, elected by the general assembly, are\r\n    required to be obeyed by all members. The several trades are\r\n    separately organized within the order.... The Knights desired\r\n    to include all productive workers, whether or not they received\r\n    their compensation in the form of wages.[14]\r\n\r\nThe emphasis placed by the Knights upon the union of skilled and\r\nunskilled is significant in relation to the later efforts of the I. W.\r\nW. to effect such a union. \"I saw,\" said Grand Master Workman Terence\r\nV. Powderly, \"that labor-saving machinery was bringing the machinist\r\ndown to the level of a day laborer, and soon they would be on a level.\r\nMy aim was to dignify the laborer.\"[15] Mr. Powderly is reported in\r\nthe same interview as saying that his greatest difficulty in getting\r\nmachinists and blacksmiths to join the Knights of Labor lay in the\r\ncontempt with which they looked upon other workers.\r\n\r\nThere was a much closer connection in the Knights of Labor between\r\nthe central organization and the local bodies than is today the case\r\nwith the American Federation of Labor, which, as its name implies,\r\nis a comparatively loose _federation_ of autonomous \"international\r\nunions.\" This high degree of centralization of power in the hands of\r\nthe General Assembly and the national officers was a factor in the\r\ndisintegration of the order. More important still was the fact of\r\ninternal dissension, especially the bitter animosity arising out of\r\nthe Knights' participation in politics. \"... There came the question\r\nwhether the organization should go into politics as a body or not. That\r\nquestion was probably discussed in every Local Assembly in\r\nAmerica ... [and] those political questions coming up drove men out of\r\nthe organization....\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe Knights were a curious mixture of conservative and radical\r\nelements. The organization was socialistic, but rather state\r\nsocialistic than anything else. Despite their arbitration clause they\r\ndid not believe in the identity of interest of employer and employee.\r\nAs trade unionists they were innovators and steered far from the\r\nnarrow trade type of union imported from England. They said--_in\r\nwords_--that they wanted to destroy the wage system. \"To point out a\r\nway to utterly destroy this system would be a pleasure to me,\" said\r\nGrand Master Workman Powderly.[17] As to the Knights of Labor policy\r\nin regard to violence, Perlman says that \"... although the leaders of\r\nthe Knights preached against violence and what we now call _sabotage_\r\nboth were nevertheless extensively practiced, as, for instance, in\r\nthe Southwest Railway strike of 1886.\" He goes on to draw a parallel\r\nbetween the Knights and the \"Wobblies,\" declaring that the latter\r\npreach violence without practicing it, while the Knights practiced\r\nit without preaching. He adds that the Knights of Labor adopted\r\ncoöperation as their official philosophy and the I. W. W. adopted\r\nsyndicalism and declares that neither practiced their doctrines very\r\nmuch.[18] The disrupted condition of the Knights of Labor in 1902,\r\nthree years before the organization of the I. W. W., may be understood\r\nfrom the following press dispatch:\r\n\r\n    The rival factions of the Knights of Labor will each hold a\r\n    congress at Albany this week beginning Tuesday. Each congress\r\n    claims to represent the Knights of Labor in this State....\r\n    The Hayes faction has at present the books, property and\r\n    paraphernalia of the Knights of Labor which were awarded to it\r\n    by the courts some time ago.[19]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the rise of the Knights of Labor in America came\r\nthe International Workingmen's Association, the famous \"International\"\r\nwhich, springing up in Europe in the late sixties, soon spread to both\r\nsides of the Atlantic. It was first established in the United States in\r\n1871. This first American section of the International made a slogan\r\nof the declaration that the emancipation of the working classes must\r\nbe achieved by the working classes themselves.[20] The organization\r\nappears to have been short-lived; for ten years later, in 1881, another\r\nbody calling itself the International Workingmen's Association was\r\norganized at Pittsburgh. This organization, says Tridon, was \"made up\r\nmostly of laborers and farmers who rejected all parliamentary action\r\nand advocated education and propaganda as the best means to bring about\r\na social revolution.\"[21] In 1887, when they had about 6,000 members,\r\nthey attempted to amalgamate with the Socialist Labor party, but the\r\nnegotiations failed and they disbanded.[22]\r\n\r\nMeantime the anarchists had been busy in this country. In 1881,\r\nthe year which marks the birth of the American Federation of Labor\r\n(then called the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions\r\nof the United States and Canada), the difference between them and\r\nthose who advocated political action finally assumed definite form\r\nin the organization by the anarchist advocates of physical force of\r\nthe Revolutionary Socialist party. In 1883 there was held a joint\r\nconvention of the \"revolutionary socialists\" and the anarchists\r\nwhich resulted in the birth of the International Working People's\r\nAssociation.[23] At this convention were gathered representatives of\r\nanarchist and revolutionary socialist groups from twenty-six cities.\r\nThese delegates drafted the famous Pittsburgh proclamation which\r\ndemanded \"the destruction of the existing government by all means,\r\n_i. e._, by energetic, implacable, revolutionary and international\r\naction\" and the establishment of an industrial system based upon\r\n\"the free exchange of equivalent products between the producing\r\norganizations themselves and without the intervention of middlemen and\r\nprofit-making.\"[24] In the course of two years the membership of the\r\nInternational grew to about 7,000. Then in 1888 came the Haymarket\r\ntragedy and the International soon passed out of existence. The\r\nanarchists were in control of this organization and great stress was\r\nlaid upon revolutionary tactics and direct action, with a corresponding\r\ndepreciation of political action. John Most, the anarchist, had come to\r\nthis country in 1882 and the organization of the International Working\r\nPeople's Association was largely due to his agitation here.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that all the main ideas of modern revolutionary\r\nunionism as exhibited by the I. W. W. may be found in the old\r\nInternational Workingmen's Association.[25] The I. W. W. organ, _The\r\nIndustrial Worker_, asserts that \"we must trace the origin of the\r\nideas of modern, revolutionary unionism to the International.\"[26]\r\nComparing the French cousin of our modern I. W. W. with the older\r\nAssociation, James Guillaume asks, \"et qu'est-ce que la confédération\r\ngénérale du Travail si non la continuation de l'internationale?\"[27]\r\nMany items in the program originally drafted by the famous anarchist,\r\nMichael Bakunin, for the International in 1868 are very similar to the\r\ntwentieth century slogans of the I. W. W.\r\n\r\nIt began by declaring itself atheist, \"_L'alliance se déclare athée_,\"\r\nand went on to assert that its chief work was to be the abolition of\r\nreligion and the substitution of science for faith. It advocated the\r\npolitical, social and economic equality of the classes, to achieve\r\nwhich end all governments were to be abolished. It opposed not only all\r\ncentralized organization, but also all forms of political action, and\r\nbelieved that groups of producers, instead of the community, should\r\nhave control of the processes of industry.[28]\r\n\r\n\"Ennemie de tout despotisme, ne reconnaisant d'autre forme politique\r\nque la forme républicaine, et rejetant absolument toute alliance\r\nréactionnaire, elle repousse aussi toute action politique qui\r\nn'aurait pas pour but immédiat et direct le triomphe de la cause des\r\ntravailleurs contre le capital.\"[29]\r\n\r\nA secret organization, known as the Sovereigns of Industry, was\r\nlaunched at Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1874. It admitted both men\r\nand women. Its Preamble stated that it was \"an association of the\r\nindustrial working classes without regard to race, color, nationality\r\nor occupation; not founded for the purpose of waging any war of\r\naggression upon any other class or fostering any antagonism of labor\r\nagainst capital ... but for mutual assistance in self-improvement and\r\nself-protection.\"[30] Its ultimate purpose, however, appeared to be the\r\nelimination of the wage system.\r\n\r\nIn the same year was formed a socialist organization called \"The\r\nAssociation of United Workers of America.\"[31] This body, together\r\nwith several other organizations of socialists, merged to form the\r\nWorkingman's Party in 1876. The following year the name was changed to\r\nthe Socialist Labor Party. The year 1874 also marks the birth of the\r\nIndustrial Brotherhood, an organization somewhat similar to the Knights\r\nof Labor but which did not survive the seventies.[32]\r\n\r\nA decade later (1884) the National Union of the United Brewery Workmen\r\nof the United States[33] was organized. Next to the United Mine Workers\r\nthis is today the strongest industrially organized union in America.\r\nThis union has almost from the beginning admitted to its membership\r\nnot only brewers but also drivers (of brewery wagons), maltsters,\r\nengineers and firemen employed in breweries, _etc._--all workmen, in\r\nfact, who are employed in and around the breweries. Until 1896 the\r\nBrewers were a part of the Knights of Labor. Since then they have been\r\nalmost continuously affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.\r\nThey have, however, always insisted upon industrial unionism so far as\r\nstructure is concerned and have more than once been at loggerheads with\r\nthe Federation on this score. The Brewery Workmen's Union, although\r\nconservative in every other way, is cited by I. W. W.'s, no less than\r\nthe Mine Workers, as a model of the correct thing in labor-union\r\n_structure_. In 1890 the United Mine Workers' Union of America was\r\nformed. The organization is today the largest union in this country, if\r\nnot in the world. It is unquestionably the strongest _industrial_ union\r\nin the world. Since 1905 the revolutionary industrial I. W. W.'s have\r\nlooked with admiration upon the structural form of the Mine Workers'\r\nUnion--and with impatient scorn upon their conservative tactics.\r\n\r\nIn England also there came at this time a high tide of sentiment for\r\nthe \"new unionism.\"\r\n\r\n    The day has gone by for the efforts of isolated trades [wrote\r\n    H. M. Hyndman]. Nothing is to be gained for the workers as a\r\n    class without the complete organization of labourers of all\r\n    grades, skilled and unskilled.... We appeal ... to the skilled\r\n    artisans of all trades ... to make common cause with their\r\n    unskilled brethren and with us Social Democrats so that the\r\n    workers may themselves take hold of the means of production and\r\n    organize a coöperative commonwealth....[34]\r\n\r\nWhat is even more significant in view of the present day I. W. W.\r\ndemand for industrial control is the fact that there was constantly\r\ncropping up in the eighties the Owenite demand that the workers must\r\nbe allowed to \"own their own factories and decide by vote who their\r\nmanagers and foremen shall be.\"[35]\r\n\r\nIn 1888 came the famous Haymarket riots in Chicago. The effect of this\r\ntragedy was unquestionably to give the labor and socialist movements a\r\nserious setback.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement [says Robert Hunter] lay stunned after its brief\r\nflirtation with anarchy. The union men drew away from the anarchist\r\nagitators, and, taking their information from the capitalist press\r\nonly, concluded that socialism and anarchism were the same thing, and\r\nwould, if tolerated, lead the movement to ruin and disaster. Without a\r\ndoubt, the bomb in Chicago put back the labor movement for years.\r\nIt ... did more to induce the rank and file of trade unionists to\r\nreject all association with revolutionary ideas than perhaps all other\r\nthings put together.[36]\r\n\r\nJustus Ebert, who is now a member of the I. W. W., declares that\r\nthe Haymarket affair \"involved the new Socialist Labor party in a\r\nfierce discussion of the right course to pursue in the emancipation\r\nof labor.\"[37] Robert Hunter thinks that these riots really gave the\r\nFrench unionists the idea of the General Strike and thus helped to give\r\nform, first, to modern French syndicalism, and second, both by relay\r\nback to this side of the Atlantic and directly by its influence in this\r\ncountry, to American syndicalism in the form of the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World.[38]\r\n\r\nFive years after Haymarket--in June, 1893--an industrial union of\r\nrailway employees was organized in Chicago by Eugene V. Debs. A year\r\nlater, at the time of the Pullman strike, it had a membership of\r\n150,000. The failure of that strike, which by the way was an early\r\nexample of I. W. W. tactics, broke down the union, and it passed out of\r\nexistence in 1897.\r\n\r\nThe year 1893 also marks the beginning of the Western Federation of\r\nMiners,[39] which may well be ranked as the chief predecessor of the\r\nI. W. W. The coal miners had formed their national organization three\r\nyears earlier. Both the coal and metalliferous miners' unions were\r\nbuilt from the start upon the industrial type, that is, including in\r\ntheir membership in both cases \"all persons employed in and around\r\nthe mines.\" The Western Federation of Miners was organized in Butte,\r\nMontana, in 1893, and almost immediately affiliated with the American\r\nFederation of Labor. It separated from the Federation, however, in 1897\r\nand, after a period of independent existence broken by alliances with\r\nthe Western Labor Union in 1898 and with the I. W. W. in 1905, rejoined\r\nthe A. F. of L. in 1911.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve years of the Western Federation's existence before\r\nthe birth of the I. W. W., it figured in the most strenuous and\r\ndramatic series of strike disturbances in the history of the American\r\nlabor movement. Swift on each others' heels came the terrors of Coeur\r\nd'Alene in 1893, Cripple Creek in 1894, Leadville in 1896-7, Salt Lake\r\nand the Coeur d'Alene again in 1899, Telluride in 1901, Idaho Springs\r\nin 1903, and Cripple Creek again in 1903-4. The Federation was--in\r\nits first decade particularly--as militantly radical as the coal\r\nminers' union was conservative. The strikes in which it has engaged\r\nhave been usually marked by much disorder and violence.[40] During the\r\nIdaho Springs strike in 1903 an indignation meeting of the citizens\r\nwas called for July 29th by the Citizens' Protective League--an\r\nassociation of mine owners and business men. At this meeting one of\r\nthe local merchants said: \"Moyer and Haywood are the arch anarchists\r\nof this country, along with Herr Most. I see that Moyer is coming to\r\nIdaho Springs tomorrow. I want to say that if the people allow him to\r\nland his feet in Clear Creek County they are dirty arrant cowards.\"\r\nVery shortly the meeting passed a resolution to deport the strikers,\r\nadjourned to the jail, demanded the prisoners, ordered out 14 of the 23\r\nthere incarcerated and deported them.[41]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the terrible strike troubles during the nineties\r\nand the early years of this century had their effect in working union\r\nmen up to the radically pioneering pitch. These struggles were surely\r\nthe birth signs of the coming militant industrialism of the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World. Wm. D. Haywood, now General Secretary-Treasurer\r\nof the I. W. W., and Vincent St. John, for several years in the same\r\nposition, were both active and leading members of the W. F. M. during\r\nits earlier years. The Federation was less scornful of politics than\r\nthe I. W. W. The Western Miners were forced by the obvious connivance\r\nbetween the state and city governments and the mine operators, by the\r\nuse of the militia for the suppression of strikes and by the abuse of\r\nthe injunction, to consider the possibilities of political action along\r\nsocialistic lines. At their convention in 1902 they resolved \"to adopt\r\nthe principle of socialism without equivocation.\"[42] This resolution\r\nwas reaffirmed in 1903 and 1904. \"We recommend the Socialist party,\"\r\nreads their statement in 1904, \"to the toiling masses of humanity as\r\nthe only source through which they can secure ... complete emancipation\r\nfrom the present system of wage slavery....\"[43] \"Let all strike\r\nindustrially here and now, if necessary,\" runs another resolution\r\n(signed, by the way, by William D. Haywood), \"and then strike in unity\r\nat the ballot-box for the true solution of the labor problem by putting\r\nmen of our class into public office....\"[44]\r\n\r\nThe Federation was not actually content, however, with political\r\nactivity. It has been made quite evident that the economic weapon of\r\nthe strike was not neglected. In addition to this the fundamental and\r\nat that time rarely discussed problem of employees' control in industry\r\nwas seriously discussed. At the tenth convention, Wm. D. Haywood\r\nproposed that the Federation invest some of its money in mines, to be\r\noperated by its members for the benefit of the unions.[45] At the\r\nfollowing meeting President Moyer proposed that the Federation secure\r\ncontrol of and operate mines and levy assessments for the purpose.[46]\r\nThe plan had to be given up at that time because the Federation just\r\nthen faced unusual difficulties because of the strike confronting it.\r\nNevertheless, this idea of industrial workers' control had its effect\r\nin impressing the miners with the notion that in their union \"they had\r\nan agency that could carry on and control production for their own\r\nbenefit.\"\r\n\r\nSome conception of the unusually radical temper of the Western\r\nFederation may be had from the Preamble to its constitution. It\r\ndeclares that\r\n\r\n    there is a class struggle in society and that this struggle\r\n    is caused by economic conditions; ... the producer ... is\r\n    exploited of the wealth which he produces, being allowed to\r\n    retain barely sufficient for his elementary necessities; ...\r\n    that the class struggle will continue until the producer is\r\n    recognized as the sole master of his product; ... that the\r\n    working class, and it alone, can and must achieve its own\r\n    emancipation; ... [and] finally, that an industrial union and\r\n    the concerted political action of all wage workers is the only\r\n    method of attaining this end.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Preamble concludes, \"the wage slaves employed in\r\nand around the mines, mills and smelters have associated in the Western\r\nFederation of Miners.\"[47]\r\n\r\nThe Western Federation of Miners was the effective agency in the\r\nformation at Salt Lake City in 1898 of the Western Labor Union. It\r\nwas in this same year that the Social Democratic party (which became\r\nthe Socialist party three years later) was organized in Chicago.\r\nThe Western Labor Union in 1902 moved its headquarters from Butte,\r\nMontana, to Chicago, and changed its name to the American Labor Union,\r\nwhich in turn, and inclusive of the W. F. M., merged in 1905 with\r\ncertain other radical unions to form the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld. The American Labor Union was in 1905 apparently on the verge\r\nof disruption--practically dead.[48] The Federation of Miners was\r\nalways the Western (or American) Labor Union's largest and strongest\r\ncomponent. It repudiated the American Federation of Labor. The bulk\r\nof its membership was unskilled labor and it soon had enrolled, in\r\naddition to the mine laborers, large numbers of the cooks, waiters,\r\nteamsters, and lumbermen of the western states. It was apparently the\r\nfirst labor organization seriously to attempt the organization of the\r\nlumber workers.[49] The Western Labor Union proposed to bring into\r\nan industrial organization western wage-workers of all crafts and\r\nno crafts; it aimed to include all kinds and degrees of labor, but\r\nuntil 1901 its activities were mostly confined to the mining camps of\r\nthe West.[50] Indeed, Katz says that \"the American Labor Union was\r\npractically only another name for the Western Federation of Miners:\r\n[being] called into existence to give the miners' union a national\r\ncharacter.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThe American Labor Union was very decidedly an industrial union--more,\r\nhowever, by anticipation than realization.\r\n\r\nIt resembled our modern I. W. W. in some important particulars. \"It\r\nbelieves,\" says one of the members, \"that all employees working for one\r\ncompany, engaged in any one industry, should be managed through ...\r\none authoritative head; that all men employed by one employer, in any\r\none industry [should] be answerable to the employer through one and\r\nthe same organization....\"[52] The approval of its general Executive\r\nBoard is required before any member local can call a strike.[53] An\r\ninterchangeable or universal transfer system is provided, as it was\r\nlater by the I. W. W.[54] The American Labor Union was an industrial\r\norganization of more decided political character and sympathies than\r\nis the I. W. W. It was, however, decidedly socialistic in its ultimate\r\naim. It seemed to mark the climax of development of industrial unionism\r\nof that (political-socialist) type. It will be evident in the following\r\npages that in 1905 began a sharp swing under the I. W. W. banner\r\nfrom socialist industrial unionism to anarcho-syndicalist industrial\r\nunionism.\r\n\r\nA good many of the leaders of the American Labor Union were members of\r\nthe Socialist party. \"Believing that the time has come,\" runs the A.\r\nL. U. _Preamble_, \"for undivided, independent, working-class political\r\naction, we hereby declare in favor of international Socialism and\r\nadopt the platform of the Socialist Party of America as the political\r\nplatform and program of the American Labor Union.\"[55] Although it\r\nendorsed socialism, the A. L. U., unlike the Socialist Trade and Labor\r\nAlliance, admitted workingmen of any political views whatsoever, but\r\nresembled the latter organization in its opposition to the American\r\nFederation of Labor and its desire to build up a revolutionary labor\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n    The economic organization of the proletariat [declares the\r\n    official organ of the A. L. U.] is the heart and soul of the\r\n    socialist movement, of which the political party is simply the\r\n    public expression at the ballot box. The purpose of industrial\r\n    unionism is to organize the working class in approximately\r\n    the same departments of production as those which will obtain\r\n    in the coöperative commonwealth, so that, if the workers\r\n    should lose their franchise, they would still possess an\r\n    economic organization intelligently trained to take over and\r\n    collectively administer the tools of industry and the sources\r\n    of wealth for themselves.[56]\r\n\r\nThe roots of I. W. W.-ism reached out most vigorously and numerously\r\nin the western part of the United States, and the greater part of its\r\nstrength today is derived from its western membership. The way was\r\nprepared for it most largely by western organizations--the Western\r\nFederation of Miners being the forerunner _par excellence_ of modern I.\r\nW. W.-ism. Two organizations in the East, that is, having their chief\r\nstrength in the East, played a highly important rôle during the decade\r\npreceding the launching of the I. W. W. These organizations were the\r\nSocialist Labor party and its trade-union \"brain child,\" the Socialist\r\nTrade and Labor Alliance. Adequately to fill in this sketch of origins,\r\nit is necessary to refer briefly to these two organizations, especially\r\nto the S. T. & L. A., the Socialist Labor party's bright ideal of all\r\nthat a labor union ought to be.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Labor party was organized in 1877. It was a merger\r\nof the National Labor Union, the North American Federation of the\r\nInternational Workingmen's Association and the Social Democratic\r\nWorkmen's Party. It was first known as the Workmen's Party of the\r\nUnited States. The German socialist trade-union element predominated\r\nin it.[57] The Socialist Labor party has always been emphatically\r\nMarxian and its leaders have been so decidedly doctrinaire in their\r\ninterpretation of Marxian socialism and in their application of it to\r\nthe practical work of socialist campaigning and propaganda that they\r\nhave been not unjustly called impossibilists. Since the organization\r\nof the Socialist party in 1901 these two political parties of the\r\nsocialist faith have been in open and bitter opposition to each other.\r\nThe Socialist party adopted an opportunist policy, endorsed and often\r\nleagued itself with the conservative trade unions, refrained from any\r\nattempt to form or coöperate in the formation of socialist unions,\r\nand contented itself with the endeavor to make the existing unions\r\nsocialistic by converting their individual members to socialism--a\r\npolicy which came to be known as \"boring from within.\" The Socialist\r\nLabor party, on the other hand, embraced a doctrinaire \"impossibilist\"\r\npolicy, violently attacked the trade unions, made its slogan \"no\r\ncompromise and no political trading,\" and insisted that new unions,\r\nindustrial in structure and socialist in purpose and principle should\r\nbe created in opposition to the craft unions, whose structure and\r\nspirit it despaired of changing by \"boring from within.\" The Socialist\r\nparty has waxed strong and powerful. Its rival has languished and is\r\ntoday too small a group to be called a party.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance was organized in 1895, the same\r\nyear which witnessed the birth of the organized syndicalist movement\r\nin France in the form of the Confédération Générale du Travail. On\r\nDecember 6th of that year a delegation from District Assembly 49\r\nof the Knights of Labor met in conjunction with the Central Labor\r\nFederation of New York City and launched the Socialist Trade and Labor\r\nAlliance. The idea of this organization seems to have originated with\r\nDaniel DeLeon, whom his enemies called \"the Pope of the S. L. P.\" and\r\nwho was undoubtedly the leading student of Marxian socialism in this\r\ncountry. He was convinced that, as one of his followers expressed\r\nit, \"without the organization of the workers into a class-conscious\r\nrevolutionary body on the industrial field, socialism would remain but\r\nan aspiration.\"[58] \"The S. T. & L. A.\" declares N. I. Stone, \"was the\r\nmost unique example of a socialist trade-union, anti-pure-and-simple\r\norganization in the annals of labor history....\" \"It came down upon\r\nus,\" he said, \"full fledged from top to bottom as the masterpiece of\r\nour 'Master Workman' [DeLeon] and took us by surprise; but take it\r\ndid....\"[59]\r\n\r\nIn 1896 at the first convention of the Socialist Labor party after\r\nthe organization of the S. T. & L. A. the party formally endorsed the\r\nlatter organization. Mr. Hugo Vogt addressed the convention in behalf\r\nof the S. T. & L. A. \"The whole of this labor movement,\" he said,\r\n\"must become saturated with socialism, _must be placed under socialist\r\ncontrol_, if we mean to bring together the whole working class into\r\nthat army of emancipation which we need to accomplish our purpose.\"[60]\r\nHe went on to explain that \"in order to make it impossible for any\r\nmasked swindlers to obtain influence in the Alliance, and to swing it\r\nback to the conservative side, we have provided that every officer ...\r\nshall take a pledge that he will not be affiliated with any capitalist\r\nparty and will not support any political action except that of the\r\nSocialist Labor party.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance was patterned very closely\r\nafter the Knights of Labor. Wm. E. Trautmann called it \"a duodecimo\r\nedition of the K. of L.\"[62] \"It had the same district alliances with\r\nthe same intellectuals as leaders: the same local craft organizations\r\nand the same mixed locals [as well as] the same centralized autocracy\r\nat headquarters....\" He concludes that \"the most fatal weakness of all\r\nwas the political union of the S. T. & L. A. with the S. L. P.\"[63]\r\nThe Alliance was, after all, a revolutionary socialist trade union\r\nrather than an industrial union. It differed from the American Labor\r\nUnion and other forerunners mentioned above in this lack of industrial\r\nstructure as well as in the emphasis it laid on the need of rallying to\r\nthe support of the Socialist Labor party, with which organization it\r\nstood in the most intimate relations and to which most of its members\r\nbelonged. It was actually sceptical about the efficacy of purely\r\neconomic action. In common with I. W. W. later on, and in spite of\r\nthe fact that its own locals were virtually trade or craft locals, it\r\nnourished an almost bitter hatred of the craft unions. \"We simply have\r\nto go at them,\" said one of its members, \"and smash them from top to\r\nbottom....\"[64] Its animus was directed, however, at their conservatism\r\nand not so much at their craft structure.\r\n\r\nIn its \"Declaration of Principles\" the Alliance asserted that\r\n\r\n    the methods and spirit of labor organization are absolutely\r\n    impotent to resist the aggressions of concentrated capital\r\n    ...; that the economic power of the capitalist class ... rests\r\n    upon institutions, essentially political, which ... cannot be\r\n    radically changed ... except through the _direct action of the\r\n    working people themselves_, economically and politically united\r\n    as a class.\r\n\r\nThis Declaration concludes with the following statement of the chief\r\nobject of the Alliance:\r\n\r\n    The summary ending of that barbarous [class] struggle at\r\n    the earliest possible time by the abolition of classes, the\r\n    restoration of the land and of all the means of production,\r\n    transportation and distribution to the people as a collective\r\n    body, and the substitution of the coöperative commonwealth for\r\n    the present state of planless production, industrial war and\r\n    social disorder; a commonwealth in which every worker shall\r\n    have the free exercise and full benefit of his faculties,\r\n    multiplied by all the modern factors of civilization.[65]\r\n\r\nIn the body of its constitution the objects of the Alliance are set\r\nforth more explicitly. They are declared to be to bring about the\r\nadoption of its principles\r\n\r\n    by bodies of organized labor which are still governed ... by\r\n    the tenets or traditions of the \"Old Unionism Pure and Simple\";\r\n    to organize into local and district alliances all the wage\r\n    workers, skilled or unskilled; ... to further the political\r\n    movement of the working class and its development on the lines\r\n    of international socialism as represented on this continent by\r\n    the Socialist Labor party.[66]\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Labor party naturally greeted the Alliance with\r\nenthusiasm. After officially endorsing the Alliance, the 1896\r\nconvention passed a resolution of welcome.\r\n\r\n    We hail with unqualified joy [it declared] the formation of\r\n    the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance as a great stride\r\n    toward throwing off the yoke of wage slavery.... We call upon\r\n    the socialists of the land to carry the revolutionary spirit\r\n    of the S. T. and L. A. into all the organizations of the\r\n    workers and thus consolidate ... the proletariat of America\r\n    in an irresistible class conscious army, equipped both with\r\n    the shield of the economic organization and the sword of the\r\n    Socialist Labor party ballot.[67]\r\n\r\nDuring this S. T. and L. A. period Daniel DeLeon looked upon\r\nrevolutionary unionism as being necessarily pro-political rather than\r\npro-industrial and non-political. He then felt that the political\r\nmovement must dominate the unions as they are in Germany dominated by\r\nthe Social Democracy. He later became convinced that revolutionary\r\nunionism must dominate the political movement, and that the\r\nrevolutionary union had a decisive mission in the Socialist movement.\r\n\r\n    The S. T. and L. A. [says Fraina] was largely a weapon to\r\n    fight conservative A. F. of L. politics. The friends of the\r\n    A. F. of L. roared in protest and ... split the Socialist\r\n    movement to save the A. F. of L.... DeLeon's revolutionary\r\n    unionism was largely a means to prevent the socialist political\r\n    movement [from] being controlled by the Aristocracy of Labor\r\n    and the Middle Class--two social groups which ... have\r\n    certain interests in common and against the revolutionary\r\n    proletariat.[68]\r\n\r\nThe composition and membership of the S. T. and L. A. in July, 1898,\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n  German Waiters                       260\r\n  Ale and Porter Union                 200\r\n  United Engineers                      60\r\n  Marquette Workers                     70\r\n  Carl Sahm Club                        80\r\n  Piano Makers                         520\r\n  Bohemian Butchers                    150\r\n  Bartenders                            90\r\n  Furriers                             250\r\n  Silver Workers                        40\r\n  Empire City Lodge                     35\r\n  New York Cooks                        55\r\n  German Coppersmiths                   80\r\n  Macaroni Workers                      65\r\n  Progressive Cigarette Makers         970\r\n  Bohemian Typographia                  32\r\n  Swedish Machinists                    98\r\n  Progressive Typographia               15\r\n  Pressmen and Feeders                  18\r\n  Independent Bakers No. 33             60\r\n  Independent Bakers No. 25             45\r\n  Liberty Waiters                       65\r\n                                     -----\r\n                                     3,258[69]\r\n\r\n    Far from being superior to the old [craft] organization(s),\r\n    [says Stone] it is very much inferior.... With an insignificant\r\n    membership, without controlling as much as a large factory,\r\n    not to speak of a trade, at war not only with the bosses,\r\n    ... but with every trade union which does not come under its\r\n    mighty wing--it was unable to undertake any step of importance,\r\n    in order to improve the condition of its members. The only\r\n    strike of significance which it had, that at Slatersville\r\n    [Rhode Island] was a failure after it had cost the Party about\r\n    $1,500....[70]\r\n\r\nThe Alliance was scarcely more than a phantom organization on the eve\r\nof the launching of the I. W. W. in 1905. The same may be said of all\r\nthe western unions which in that year merged in the I. W. W., except\r\nthe Western Federation of Miners. The S. L. P. and the S. T. and L.\r\nA. \"talk of capturing the convention to be held on June 27 [the 1st\r\nI. W. W. convention].... That convention should be not a revival, but\r\nthe funeral, of the S. T. and L. A.\"[71] This expressed fairly well\r\nthe attitude of the Socialist party men. \"Born in hatred, suckled\r\nin dissension,\" as one socialist writer sees it, \"the sole partisan\r\ntrade union that ever arose to deny the principles and policies of\r\ninternational socialism came to destruction by its own venom, not\r\nhowever, until it had implanted the poison of its spirit into the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World.\"[72]\r\n\r\nThe main ideas of I. W. W.-ism--certainly of the I. W. W.-ism of the\r\nfirst few years after 1905--were of American origin, not French, as\r\nis commonly supposed. These sentiments were brewing in France, it is\r\ntrue, in the early nineties,[73] but they were brewing also in this\r\ncountry and the American brew was essentially different from the\r\nFrench. It was only after 1908 that the _syndicalisme révolutionnaire_\r\nof France had any direct influence on the revolutionary industrial\r\nunionist movement here. Even then it was largely a matter of borrowing\r\nsuch phrases as _sabotage_, _la grève perlée_, _etc._ The tactics back\r\nof the words _sabotage_ and \"direct action\" had been practiced by\r\nAmerican working men years before those words ever came into use among\r\nour radical unionists. \"The Western Labor Union,\" says Walling, \"was\r\napplying these principles in the Rocky Mountains, under the leadership\r\nof Haywood and others, several years before the French Confederation\r\nof Labor was formed....\"[74] Some premonition of the power of a labor\r\nunion including all--or even a large proportion of--the unskilled was\r\ngiven by the Western Federation of Miners, the American Labor Union,\r\nthe American Railway Union, and other American organizations already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nDuring the first five years of this century the idea of militant\r\nindustrial unionism underwent rapid development. Unionists were coming\r\nto have a much broader view of the social rôle of the labor union.\r\nThe actual trend of events opened the way for reorganization on new\r\nlines. The organizations which were to make up the I. W. W. were almost\r\nwithout exception in unprosperous straits, some of them being on the\r\nverge of disruption. All of them were bitter in their opposition to\r\nthe American Federation of Labor--with which organization, indeed, few\r\nof them were affiliated. The United Metal Workers had been affiliated\r\nbut withdrew in December, 1904. There was probably little left but a\r\nremnant when they joined the I. W. W. the following year. The same is\r\ntrue of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees. Even the American\r\nLabor Union--except its \"mining division,\" the W. F. M.--was skirting\r\nthe edge of dissolution.[75] The Socialist Labor party and its \"puny\r\nchild,\" the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, were in a bad way.\r\nAmong the United Mine Workers there was dissension in many localities.\r\nThere was dissatisfaction with the leaders and especially with the\r\nupshot of the strike settlement of 1902. Moreover, the miners as well\r\nas the United Brewery Workmen were embittered by constant criticism of\r\ntheir industrial form of organization. The latter were threatened with\r\nthe prospect of a revocation of their charter by the Federation. There\r\nwere thus a number of \"national\" organizations and many locals in other\r\nbodies which were anxious to create some central labor organization to\r\nstrengthen the forces of industrial unionism. The Socialist Trade and\r\nLabor Alliance, though on the decline, still included a considerable\r\nbody of workers who were impatient of the conservatism of the A. F. of\r\nL. and desired somehow to build up a strong revolutionary (this meaning\r\nfor them a Marxian socialist) organization. The Western Federation of\r\nMiners--stronger than all the others put together--was not excelled by\r\nany of them in its revolutionary zeal. It had the power as well as the\r\nenthusiasm. Moreover, it represented revolutionary industrial unionism\r\nmore completely than did the smaller unions in the West and the\r\nAlliance in the East. The Alliance, in fact, was a revolutionary union\r\nwithout the industrial character and without much real appreciation of\r\nthe meaning and importance of the idea of _industrial_ as opposed to\r\n_craft_ organization. The miners, however, had a big, powerful union of\r\nan emphatically industrial character and their experience had made them\r\nvery militant.[76]\r\n\r\nMuch of this hard experience consisted in a gradual process of\r\ndisillusionment about the virtue and goodness of the state so far as\r\nits relations with labor were concerned. The long series of violent\r\nand protracted strikes between the Western Federation and the mine\r\noperators and the rôle played therein by the state government\r\nconvinced the miners that they would be more successful in gaining\r\ntheir political ends if they had more economic power to back up their\r\nrequests. The miners were convinced, therefore, that the imperative\r\nneed of the hour was for the extension to other industries of their\r\ntype of industrial organization inspired by socialist aims. This would\r\nmake solidarity possible, not only between skilled and unskilled in the\r\nmetalliferous mines but also in all mines, all shops, all industries.\r\nThey felt that then indeed would an injury to one be the concern of\r\nall.[77]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] _Cf._ Brooks, _American Syndicalism_ (New York, 1913), ch. vi and\r\nTridon, _The New Unionism_, 4th printing (New York, 1917), p. 67.\r\n\r\n[4] _Cf._ C.

W. W.[79] was organized at an \"Industrial Union Congress\" held in\r\nChicago in June, 1905. This first or constitutional convention had\r\nits inception in an informal conference held in that city, in the\r\nfall of 1904, by six men of prominence in the socialist and labor\r\nmovement. These conferees were: William E. Trautmann, editor of the\r\n_Brauer Zeitung_, official organ of the United Brewery Workmen; George\r\nEstes, President of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees;\r\nW. L. Hall, General Secretary-Treasurer of the United Brotherhood\r\nof Railway Employees; Isaac Cowen, American representative of the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers of Great Britain; Clarence Smith,\r\nGeneral Secretary-Treasurer of the American Labor Union; and Thomas J.\r\nHagerty, editor of the _Voice of Labor_, official organ of the American\r\nLabor Union.[80] Several others not present at this conference were at\r\nthat time actively interested in the matter and coöperated in carrying\r\nout these prenatal plans. Two of them, Eugene V. Debs and Charles O.\r\nSherman, General Secretary of United Metal Workers International Union,\r\nwere destined to play important rôles in the organization.\r\n\r\nThese men were impelled by a common conviction that the labor unions\r\nof America were becoming powerless to achieve real benefits for\r\nworking men and women. This feeling was confirmed and intensified by\r\nmany recent events in the trade-union movement. It was not the more\r\nconservative, \"aristocratic\" unions alone which were found wanting.\r\nEven those labor organizations of the industrial and radical type, such\r\nas the American Labor Union, the Western Federation of Miners, and the\r\nSocialist Trade and Labor Alliance, were believed to be, for one reason\r\nor another, quite unprepared to negotiate--much less to fight--with\r\nthe ever more highly integrated organizations of employers. At the\r\nconstitutional convention in June, 1905, Clarence Smith of the American\r\nLabor Union explained the reasons for initiating the movement.\r\n\r\n    This conviction of ineffectiveness in the face of opportunities\r\n    for effective work was strengthened [he said] at the general\r\n    convention of the International Union of United Brewery Workmen\r\n    last September. It seemed clear that a united, harmonious and\r\n    consistent request from all unions and organizations of the\r\n    American Labor Union, backed by an administration in whom the\r\n    rank and file of the brewery workers had confidence, would\r\n    have brought the Brewery Workmen into the American Labor Union\r\n    at that time. And what would have been true of the Brewery\r\n    Workmen would have been true also of other organizations of an\r\n    industrial character. It therefore seemed the first duty of\r\n    conscientious union men, regardless of affiliation, prejudice\r\n    or personal interest, to lay the foundation upon which all\r\n    the working people, many of whom are now organized, might\r\n    unite upon a common ground to build a labor organization that\r\n    would correspond to modern industrial conditions, and through\r\n    which they might finally secure complete emancipation from\r\n    wage-slavery for all wage-workers.[81]\r\n\r\nIn order to go over the matter and discuss plans more thoroughly, it\r\nwas decided to arrange for a larger meeting. On November 29 a letter\r\nof invitation was sent to about thirty persons then prominent in the\r\nradical labor and Socialist movements. This letter contained the\r\nfollowing significant paragraph:\r\n\r\n    Asserting our confidence in the ability of the working class,\r\n    if correctly organized on both political and industrial\r\n    lines, to take possession of and operate successfully ... the\r\n    industries of the country;\r\n\r\n    Believing that working-class political expression, through the\r\n    Socialist ballot, in order to be sound, must have its economic\r\n    counterpart in a labor organization builded as the structure of\r\n    socialist society, embracing within itself the working-class\r\n    in approximately the same groups and departments and\r\n    industries that the workers would assume in the working-class\r\n    administration of the Co-operative Commonwealth ...;\r\n\r\n    We invite you to meet us at Chicago, Monday, January 2, 1905,\r\n    in secret conference to discuss ways and means of uniting the\r\n    working people of America on correct revolutionary principles,\r\n    regardless of any general labor organization of past or\r\n    present, and only restricted by such basic principles as will\r\n    insure its integrity as a real protector of the interests of\r\n    the workers.[82]\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy fact that, although the proposition was concurred\r\nin and the invitation accepted with enthusiasm by the great majority\r\nof those invited, agreement was not unanimous. There were two\r\ndissenters--Victor Berger and Max Hayes. It is not recorded that Mr.\r\nBerger even sent his \"regrets,\" but Mr. Hayes explained his position at\r\nlength. In a letter to W. L. Hall, December 30, 1904, he said:\r\n\r\n    This sounds to me as though we were to have another Socialist\r\n    Trade and Labor Alliance experiment again; that we, who are in\r\n    the trade-unions as at present constituted, are to cut loose\r\n    and flock by ourselves. If I am correct in my surmises it means\r\n    another running fight between Socialists on the one side and\r\n    all other partisans on the other.... If there is any fighting\r\n    to be done I intend ... to _agitate on the inside_ of the\r\n    organizations now in existence....[83]\r\n\r\nThe Western Federation of Miners did not lack enthusiasm for this\r\nwider venture in industrial unionism. President Moyer's report to\r\nthe thirteenth convention, which met just one month before the\r\nconstitutional convention of June, 1905, contained the following:\r\n\r\n    The Twelfth Annual Convention instructed your Executive\r\n    Board to take such action as might be necessary in order\r\n    that the representatives of organized labor might be brought\r\n    together and plans outlined for the amalgamation of the entire\r\n    wage-working class into one general organization. Following\r\n    out these instructions at a meeting held in the month of\r\n    December it was decided to send a committee to meet with the\r\n    officers of the American Labor Union. This conference took\r\n    place January 4.... The result ... was the Manifesto....\r\n    The question for you to decide is not one of changing the\r\n    principles, policy or plan of your organization, but as to\r\n    whether or not the Western Federation of Miners shall become a\r\n    working part of such a movement as set forth in the Manifesto,\r\n    which shall consist of one great industrial union embracing all\r\n    industries.[84]\r\n\r\nAt about the same time J. M. O'Neill, the editor of the _Miners'\r\nMagazine_, wrote William D. Haywood, the treasurer of the Federation,\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    if this convention goes on record giving its unanimous sanction\r\n    to the movement that is contemplated in Chicago, such action\r\n    will be heralded from the Atlantic to the Pacific, ... and\r\n    will create a sentiment that will keep on crystallizing until\r\n    capitalism will feel that it is threatened in the citadel of\r\n    its entrenched power.[85]\r\n\r\nThe secret conference--thereafter to be known as the January\r\nConference--was called to order in the city of Chicago on the second\r\nof January by William E. Trautmann. There were twenty-three persons\r\npresent, representing nine different organizations; that is, of\r\ncourse, exclusive of members of the Socialist and Socialist Labor\r\nparties, who were not present formally as such. There were present\r\nfive officials of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees and one\r\nmember of the Brewery Workmen. Among those present were: Charles\r\nH. Moyer, President, Western Federation of Miners; W. D. Haywood,\r\nSecretary of the Western Federation of Miners; J. M. O'Neill, editor\r\nof the _Miners' Magazine_; A. M. Simons, editor of _The International\r\nSocialist Review_; Frank Bohn, organizer, Socialist Labor party and the\r\nSocialist Trade and Labor Alliance; T. J. Hagerty, editor of _The Voice\r\nof Labor_; C. O. Sherman, of the United Metal Workers; and \"Mother\"\r\nMary Jones. During a three days' session plans for a proposed new labor\r\norganization were seriously discussed and carefully worked out. The\r\nreport of their committee on methods and procedure was worked up by the\r\nmembers of the conference into a \"Manifesto\"[86] which contained (1)\r\nan indictment of \"things as they are\" in the trade-union world; (2)\r\nleading propositions and tentative plans for a new departure in labor\r\norganization; and (3) a call for a convention to organize this new\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this document is devoted to a discussion of certain\r\nmodern tendencies in the labor movement. Trade divisions among laborers\r\nand competition among capitalists are both disappearing. The machine\r\nprocess is more and more tending to minimize skill and swell the ranks\r\nof the unskilled and unemployed. The incidence of the machine process\r\nis fatal to labor groups divided according to the tool used. \"These\r\ndivisions,\" in the words of the Manifesto, \"far from representing\r\ndifferences in skill or interests among the laborers, are imposed\r\nby the employers that workers may be pitted against one another and\r\nspurred to greater exertion in the shop, and that all resistance to\r\ncapitalist tyranny may be weakened by artificial distinctions.\" The\r\nemployees, however, are united on the industrial plan and reënforce\r\ntheir consequent impregnable position by making use of the military\r\npower and their affiliation with the National Civic Federation.\r\n\r\nThe craft form of organization is severely criticized. It makes\r\nsolidarity impossible, for it generates a system of organized scabbery,\r\nwhere union men scab on each other. It results in trade monopolies,\r\nprohibitive initiation fees and political ignorance. It dwarfs class\r\nconsciousness and tends to \"foster the idea of harmony of interests\r\nbetween employing exploiter and employed slave.\"\r\n\r\nPassing on to the remedy proposed, the Manifesto declares that\r\n\r\n    a movement to fulfil these conditions must consist of one\r\n    great industrial union embracing all industries, providing for\r\n    craft autonomy locally, industrial autonomy internationally,\r\n    and working-class unity generally. It must be founded on the\r\n    class struggle ... and established as the economic organization\r\n    of the working class, without affiliation with any political\r\n    party.[87]\r\n\r\nThe phrase, \"craft autonomy,\" is odd--for industrialists. A. M. Simons\r\ngives an explanation. He says that any union entering the I. W. W.\r\n\"will retain trade autonomy in matters that concern each trade as\r\ncompletely as at the present time, but when it enters the field of\r\nother trades, instead of being met by trade competition ... will be met\r\nby the coöperation of affiliated unions.\"[88] This phrase referring\r\nto political parties was the germ of the ill-fated \"political clause\"\r\nof the preamble, which formulated in an indefinite way the issue on\r\nwhich three years later the organization split into two factions.[89]\r\nOther clauses provide that (1) all power shall rest with the collective\r\nmembership; (2) all labels, cards, fees, _etc._, shall be uniform\r\nthroughout; (3) the general administration shall issue a publication at\r\nregular intervals; and (4) that a central defense fund be established\r\nand maintained. The document concluded with a call to all workers\r\nwho agreed with these principles to \"meet in convention in Chicago,\r\nthe 27th day of June, 1905,--for the purpose of forming an economic\r\norganization of the working class along the lines marked out in this\r\nManifesto.\"\r\n\r\nThe Manifesto was signed by all those present at the January conference\r\nand sent broadcast to all unions throughout America and to the\r\nindustrial unions of Europe. At this January conference there was\r\ndominant a very radical idea as to what a labor organization ought to\r\nbe. The conferees decided that such an organization should not only\r\nprovide a means of unifying all crafts and industries for the better\r\nprotection and advancement of the immediate interests of the working\r\nclass, but that it must also offer, and consciously push on towards, a\r\nfinal solution of the labor problem, a solution very frankly assumed to\r\nbe a socialistic one.\r\n\r\nTo say that these conferees were, broadly speaking, socialists and that\r\nthey outlined a socialistic program of a certain sort does not mean, as\r\nthe daily press report insinuated, that the Socialist party was in any\r\nway represented in the conference or that it was a political movement.\r\nMax S. Hayes, anxious to disclaim on behalf of party Socialists any\r\nresponsibility for the new undertaking, explained that\r\n\r\n    As a matter of record and fairness it should be stated that,\r\n    first, not a single signer to the above call is officially\r\n    identified with the Socialist Party; secondly, that not one of\r\n    the signers has been seen or heard or known on the floor of\r\n    the American Federation of Labor conventions as an advocate of\r\n    socialism in recent years; and thirdly, it is doubtful whether\r\n    any American Federation of Labor delegate, with possibly an\r\n    exception or two, had the slightest knowledge that the Chicago\r\n    [January] conference was to be held.[90]\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor, as the embodiment of the craft idea,\r\nwas the subject of bitter attack at this prenatal conference. The\r\ngeneral opinion seemed to be that the A. F. of L. had outlived its\r\nusefulness, and that its extinction--but not necessarily the extinction\r\nof its constituent local unions--was a consummation very much to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe A. F. of L. very naturally resented its proposed annihilation.\r\n\r\n    The Socialists have called another convention to smash the\r\n    American trade-union movement [said President Gompers].\r\n    Scanning the list of twenty-six signers of this call, one\r\n    will look in vain to find the name of one man who has not for\r\n    years been engaged in the delectable work of trying to divert,\r\n    pervert, and disrupt the labor movement of the country....\r\n    We feel sure that the endorsement of the latest accession\r\n    to this new movement of Mr. Daniel Loeb, alias DeLeon, will\r\n    bring unction to the souls of these promoters of the latest\r\n    trade-union smashing scheme. So the trade-union smashers and\r\n    rammers from without and the \"borers from within\" are again\r\n    joining hands; a pleasant sight of the \"pirates\" and the\r\n    \"kangaroos\" hugging each other in glee over their prospective\r\n    prey.[91]\r\n\r\nBut the members of the January conference did not propose any wholesale\r\nor indiscriminate \"smashing from without.\" It is true they believed\r\nthe Federation, as a federation, to be harmful to the interests of\r\nlabor--and would have been nothing loath to \"smash\" it--but the\r\nfederated units they proposed to take over and unite in a very\r\ndifferent way.\r\n\r\nMr. A. M. Simons, who claims to have given the final draft to the\r\nManifesto, says that \"the idea expressed at the conference was to\r\nform a new central body, into which existing unions and unions to\r\nbe formed could be admitted, but not to form rival unions.\"[92]\r\nDiscussing the January conference in the _International Socialist\r\nReview_,[93] Mr. Simons traces this idea back to two vital tendencies\r\nof the day, _viz._, (1) the merging of trade lines in the class\r\nstruggle, and (2) the accelerated growth of class-consciousness on the\r\npart of the capitalists. He concludes that \"the only question about\r\nthe desirability of forming such an organization is the question of\r\ntimeliness.\"\r\n\r\nThe organized laborers were only a part of the concern of the\r\nconference. Over ninety per cent of those gainfully occupied are\r\nunorganized. It was, of course, realized that outside of all\r\nunions stood the overwhelming majority of all workingmen, and, as\r\nDaniel DeLeon put it, these men did not \"propose to go into these\r\norganizations run by the Organized Scabbery, because they had burned\r\ntheir fingers thus enough. The organization of the future has to be\r\nbuilt of the men who are now unorganized--that is, the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the working men in the nation.\"[94]\r\n\r\nThus it was really hoped that much could and would be done by\r\nworkingmen in the existent unions, without breaking away from these\r\nlocal unions. These latter must be pried away from the A. F. of L.,\r\nbut not themselves destroyed. By all means let us \"bore from within\"\r\nas far as that can be done; also when we can bore no longer, let us\r\nhammer from without and pound together new bodies from out the great\r\nunorganized mass. This, in brief, was the position of most of the\r\nindustrialists. However, not all would yet go this far. Even among the\r\nSocialist leaders a note of dissent was heard expressing the belief\r\nthat to \"bore from within\" was the only revolutionary method not\r\nabsolutely suicidal.[95] Just what fate awaited these January ideas was\r\nto some extent revealed in the proceedings of the June convention.\r\n\r\nThe convention called in accordance with the Manifesto of the January\r\nconference met two hundred strong in Chicago on Tuesday, June 27, 1905.\r\nThis gathering was first referred to as the \"Industrial Congress\" or\r\nthe \"Industrial Union Convention,\" but since before adjournment it had\r\norganized itself as the Industrial Workers of the World, it is referred\r\nto as the First Annual Convention of the I. W. W. It was a gathering\r\nremarkable and epoch-making in more ways than one, and therefore the\r\nstory of its activities is essential, not only to an understanding of\r\nthe subsequent career of the organization, but as a fundamental chapter\r\nin the whole history of industrial unionism. The discussions and\r\nresolutions of the assembly and the final type of organization which\r\ngrew out of them can be understood only in the light thrown on them\r\nby a study of the composition of this revolutionary group of men. Its\r\noccupational, structural, and doctrinal character should each be taken\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking characteristic of this group of two hundred\r\nradicals was the bewildering range of occupations represented. The\r\nvariety of different trades represented and the varying \"quality\"\r\nlevels exhibited in the organization here gathered to sink all\r\ndifferences and become as one, were astonishingly great. The following\r\nlist of the different organizations represented at the convention\r\nreveals at least forty distinct trades or occupations:\r\n\r\n  Bakers and Confectioners Union No. 48, Montreal.[A]\r\n\r\n  United Mine Workers No. 171.[A]\r\n\r\n  United Mine Workers, Pittsburg, Kans.[A]\r\n\r\n  Western Federation of Miners.\r\n\r\n  United Brotherhood of Railway Employees.\r\n\r\n  Journeymen Tailors Union of America No. 102, Pueblo.[A]\r\n\r\n  United Metal Workers International Union of America.\r\n\r\n  American Labor Union. (The A. L. U. included primarily\r\n  the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees, the\r\n  Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the International\r\n  Musical and Theatrical Union.)\r\n\r\n  Punch Press Operators Union No. 224, Schenectady.\r\n\r\n  Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance.\r\n\r\n  Flat Janitors Local Union No. 102, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  Mill and Smeltermen's Union of the W. F. of M., Butte.\r\n\r\n  Paper Hangers and Decorators, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  Federal Union (A. L. U.) No. 252, Denver.\r\n\r\n  United Brewery Workers No. 9, Milwaukee.[A]\r\n\r\n  United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.\r\n\r\n  Metal Polishers and Buffers Union.\r\n\r\n  Journeymen Tailors Protective and Benevolent Union of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n  Journeymen Tailors of Montreal.\r\n\r\n  Wage Earners Union of Montreal.\r\n\r\n  International Musicians Union.\r\n\r\n  The Industrial Workers Club, Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n  The Industrial Workers Club, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  Workers Industrial and Educational Union, Pueblo.\r\n\r\nThe foreign organizations were each represented by at least one\r\ndelegate with full powers and instructions. The following named bodies\r\nsent uninstructed delegates:\r\n\r\n  Metal Polishers, Buffers and Platers No. 6, Chicago.[A]\r\n\r\n  Carpenters and Joiners No. 181, Chicago.[96]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scandinavian Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths and Helpers, No. 110, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  German Central Labor Union.\r\n\r\n  Switchmen's Union No. 29.[A]\r\n\r\n  Bohemian Musicians Union.\r\n\r\n  Hotel and Restaurant Workers.[A]\r\n\r\n  Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees, Division\r\n    No. 288, Chicago.[A]\r\n\r\n  Barbers Union No. 225, Sharon, Pa.[A]\r\n\r\n  United Labor League, Sharon, Pa.\r\n\r\n  Utah State Federation of Labor, Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n  Cloak Makers and Tailors, Montreal.\r\n\r\n  American Flint Glass Workers Union, Toledo.\r\n\r\n  Commercial Men's Association, Court No. 1093, Milwaukee.\r\n\r\n  Street Laborers Union, Chicago.\r\n\r\n  Machinists, District Lodge No. 8.[A]\r\n\r\n  International Protective Laborers Union, Dayton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  Typographical Union No. 49, Denver.[A]\r\n\r\n  Central Labor Union, North Adams, Mass.\r\n\r\n  International Longshoremen's Union No. 271, Hoboken, N. J.[97]\r\n\r\n  Iron and Brass Molders, Schenectady.\r\n\r\nAside from the occupations represented above, the following were each\r\nrepresented by one or more individuals: machinists, tanners, electrical\r\nworkers, bookbinders, editors, teachers, authors, printers, and shoe\r\nworkers. An attorney-at-law from New York City presented himself at the\r\nconvention. The committee on credentials recommended that he be seated\r\nas a fraternal delegate, on account of the mitigating circumstances\r\nthat he wrote for several newspapers and was a \"friend and sympathizer\"\r\nof labor. After considerable debate the report of the committee was\r\nadopted \"with the exception of that portion which refers to the\r\nattorney.\"[98]\r\n\r\nThis array of occupational or trade types was scarcely more extensive\r\nthan that of the structural types here grouped together. Of these\r\nthere were the following types. (1) the simple industrial union,\r\nwherein all workers engaged, in whatsoever capacity, in any particular\r\nindustry are members of the same union. This type was represented by\r\nthe Western Federation of Miners[99]--really the strongest taproot of\r\nthe I. W. W. (2) The multi-industrial type, a federation of industrial\r\nunions, such as the American Labor Union, which included railway\r\nemployees, engineers, and musicians. (3) The so-called \"international\"\r\nunion, rarely more than national in scope, and merely a national\r\nassociation of local unions of a given trade. This type was represented\r\nby the United Metal Workers International Union of America. (4)\r\nThe non-federative industrial union, like the United Mine Workers\r\nof America with industrial rather than trade units, an industrial\r\norganization which excludes federation with similar organizations in\r\nother industries, or with employers. (5) The ordinary non-federative\r\ntrade unions, here seen in two types: (_a_) the trade amalgamation, a\r\nfederation of unions wherein the constituent bodies are so united as\r\nto preserve their individuality, although trade autonomy is thereby\r\ndestroyed. This type is illustrated here by the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers; (_b_) national unions of any particular trade like the iron\r\nmolders, wherein the constituent unions are more subordinated to the\r\nnational body than in the amalgamation. (6) The state federation--as\r\ntypified by the Utah State Federation of Labor. And finally (7) the\r\nrather unconventional type of \"union,\" represented by the Industrial\r\nWorkers' clubs and the United Labor League.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that but a small part of the \"international\"\r\nor national bodies was represented as a whole. The greater number were\r\nrepresented by one or two locals. A number of them were affiliated\r\nwith the American Federation of Labor at the time, but had become\r\ndissatisfied with the policies of that body.[100] However, some of\r\nthe unions most prominent in the activities of the convention were\r\nrepresented as central or national bodies with all their constituent\r\nlocal unions. Such were the American Labor Union and the United Metal\r\nWorkers.\r\n\r\nThose of the unions present which were affiliated with the American\r\nFederation of Labor, though forming a fairly large group numerically,\r\nrepresented no material defection from the ranks of the Federation\r\nand, generally speaking, played but a passive rôle in the work of\r\nthe convention. Of the forty-three organizations seated by the\r\ncredentials committee sixteen were affiliated with the Federation,\r\nbut at least eleven of these were represented by but one local\r\nunion. Of all these organizations which had merely local rather than\r\nnational representation, the United Mine Workers of America was most\r\nwidely represented, delegates from nine of its local unions being\r\npresent.[101] A little study of the list of the organizations seated\r\nand the localities from which their delegates came, makes it quite\r\nevident that on the whole the strong delegations from powerful local\r\nbodies, located at strategic points, were those having no connection\r\nwith the American Federation of Labor, and, conversely, that the\r\nfourteen American Federation of Labor unions just referred to were\r\nrepresented as a rule by small and solitary locals of doubtful\r\nstrength.[102] The insignificant position of the American Federation\r\nof Labor bodies in the convention will become still more manifest by\r\nan inspection of the lists given above.[103] It will be seen that only\r\nfive of the sixteen local unions of the American Federation of Labor\r\nwhich were present had empowered their delegates to install their\r\nrespective local unions in the new organization: two locals of the\r\nUnited Mine Workers and one local each in the Bakers and Confectioners,\r\nthe Brewery Workers and the Journeymen Tailors unions. All the locals\r\nof the United Metal Workers were so empowered. The American Federation\r\nof Labor was represented in no direct way among the five great powers\r\nof this industrialist convention.[104]\r\n\r\nIt was confidently expected by many members of the January conference\r\nthat there would be an immediate secession of a number of national\r\nunions from the American Federation of Labor. But whatever may have\r\nbeen the hopes of the originators of the movement, the constitutional\r\nconvention proved by its very make-up that this new insurgent labor\r\nbody could not, at the outset at least, build a new organization out of\r\ndisaffected parts of an old organization.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that not all organizations were present on equal\r\nfooting. In the first place, no union could have any influence or any\r\nactive part in the proceedings of the convention unless it sent its\r\ndelegates with full power to install. The January conference had drawn\r\nup certain rules governing representation in the forthcoming convention:\r\n\r\n    Representation in the convention shall be based upon the\r\n    number of workers whom the delegate represents. No delegate,\r\n    however, shall be given representation in the convention on the\r\n    numerical basis of an organization, unless he has credentials\r\n    ... authorizing him to install his union as a working part of\r\n    the proposed economic organization in the industrial department\r\n    to which it logically belongs.... Lacking this authority, the\r\n    delegate shall represent himself as an individual.[105]\r\n\r\nThe delegates to the convention were in this way grouped into two\r\nclasses: representative delegates, with voting power proportional to\r\nthe number of members represented, and individual delegates with merely\r\ntheir own vote, and in some cases not representing any union even as\r\nuninstructed delegates. This separation of the two hundred and three\r\ndelegates, according to the character of their credentials, may be\r\nshown as follows:\r\n\r\n                               _Dele- _Organi- _Members_    _Voting_\r\n                               gates_ zations_   _Repre-  _strength_\r\n                                       _Repre-   sented_\r\n                                       sented_\r\n\r\n  With power to install            70       23    51,430      51,430\r\n  Without power to install         72       20    91,500          72\r\n  Other \"individual\" delegates     61       --        61          61\r\n                                  ---      ---   -------      ------\r\n    Total                         203       43   142,991      51,563[106]\r\n\r\nIncluding the industrial workers' clubs there were forty-three\r\norganizations represented, of which number twenty-three were\r\nrepresented by delegates having full power to install. The above\r\nanalysis shows that of the 142,991 members presumably represented,\r\nnearly two-thirds sent delegates merely to take notes of the\r\nproceedings and report back. About one-third, some 51,000, were then\r\nprepared to cast their lot with the new undertaking. Also it appears\r\nthat about one-third of the delegates wielded practically the whole\r\nvoting power of the assembly.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the balance of power within this empowered one-third was\r\nmost unevenly distributed. Of the 51,000 votes aggregated by those\r\norganizations prepared to install, 48,000 votes were distributed among\r\nfive organizations (these being the only ones with a voting strength of\r\nmore than 1,000) as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                      _No. of_\r\n  _Organization_                      _Membership_  _Delegates_\r\n\r\n  Western Federation of Miners             27,000         5\r\n  American Labor Union                     16,750        29\r\n  United Metal Workers                      3,000         2\r\n  United Brotherhood of Railway Employees   2,087        19\r\n  Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance        1,450        14\r\n                                           ------        --\r\n    Total                                  50,287[107]   69\r\n\r\nThese were the organizations which were most prominent in the\r\nactivities of the convention. Among their delegates were a goodly\r\nnumber of the most active promotors of the movement. From\r\nthem--especially from the Western Federation of Miners--finally came\r\nthe great bulk of the funds for establishing the new union. It is\r\nevident that, numerically speaking, one single organization, the\r\nWestern Federation of Miners, held the balance of power, and of the\r\nremaining votes, three-fourths were in the control of the American\r\nLabor Union, these two bodies together outnumbering the others ten to\r\none. The sequel was to show that the numerically weaker organizations\r\nexerted an influence quite out of proportion to their numbers, because\r\nof the great influence exerted by some of their individual delegates.\r\nTheir representatives were radicals, representing more or less radical\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nIt might seem that the rôle played in the convention by an organization\r\nas comparatively weak in numbers as the Socialist Trade and Labor\r\nAlliance could be accounted for, in some measure at least, by its\r\nproportionately large delegation. A glance at the table given above\r\nshows that the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance with a self-estimated\r\nstrength of 1450[108] had fourteen delegates, while the Western\r\nFederation of Miners, 27,000 strong, had but five delegates. This was\r\ntrue to but a limited extent, for in the first place the voting power\r\nof each delegate was in direct proportion to the number of members he\r\nrepresented. Thus Haywood and his colleagues of the Western Federation\r\nof Miners had each 5400 votes, while DeLeon and each member of his\r\ndelegation had 103.6 votes. In the second place, it was a contest\r\nof personalities. The fourteen Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance\r\ndelegates comprised Daniel DeLeon and thirteen others. This same\r\nprominence of the individual was more or less evident among the other\r\ndelegations. Some further concentration of power is evidenced in\r\nthe fact that William D. Haywood and C. H. Moyer were both empowered\r\ndelegates from two organisations, since they represented the A. L. U.\r\nas well as the W. F. M.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is rather significant that several of the organizations which\r\nfinally merged into the Industrial Workers of the World had little\r\nbehind them but leaders. In some cases it appears that the membership\r\nfirst credited was greatly exaggerated. Of the organizations installed\r\nas a part of the new body, St. John reports that three \"existed almost\r\nwholly on paper.\"[109] Several of these labor bodies were really more\r\nshadow that substance. The Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the\r\nUnited Metal Workers, and the American Labor Union, St. John's three\r\n\"paper\" unions, had come upon evil days and were in an advanced stage\r\nof disintegration. Hence perhaps their presence here. They did not want\r\nto expire. They preferred to be transformed into something yet more\r\nmilitant.\r\n\r\nThe most significant and interesting phase of this unique body of\r\nindustrialists was its many-sided intellectual character. Some of the\r\nhigh lights of divergent doctrine preached and defended here show more\r\nclearly than anything else how stupendous the undertaking was. Perhaps\r\nthe least indefinite term which would give them all standing-room would\r\nbe \"revolutionary socialism,\" though many delegates repudiated the\r\nname socialist as being synonymous with reactionist and conservative.\r\nIf socialists at all, they were socialists with a radical adjective.\r\nIn reference to some the word \"anarchistic\" should be substituted for\r\n\"revolutionary.\" They all believed in the \"irrepressible conflict\"\r\nbetween capital and labor. They were a unit in wishing for and aiming\r\nat the overthrow of the wages system--the downfall of capitalism.\r\nThere was no place here for the \"Gomperite\" and his program of mutual\r\ninterests of employer and employee; but the absence from the scene of\r\nthe \"identity of interest\" and \"coffin society\" man did not guarantee\r\nharmony.[110]\r\n\r\nAs usual there was disagreement as to the methods to be used to reach\r\nthe common end desired. Hence certain divergent types of doctrine were\r\nexpounded and certain warring factions resulted therefrom. St. John\r\nenumerates four main varieties as being predominant: (1) Parliamentary\r\nSocialists--two types, impossibilist (Marxian) and opportunist\r\n(reformist); (2) Anarchists; (3) Industrial Unionists; and (4) the\r\n\"labor union fakir.\"[111] This classification is ambiguous. No doubt\r\nthe \"labor union fakir,\" who gets into any new move of this sort for\r\nwhat he can get out of it, has no real economic creed except that of\r\nthe profiteer, but he enters a movement of this kind as an exponent of\r\na certain legitimate doctrine and is at least presumed to belong to\r\nthat doctrinal faction. It has been seen that during the proceedings\r\nof the convention it developed that there were delegates present who\r\nwere not sincere in their attitude. It is a fact, as St. John points\r\nout, \"that many of those who were present as delegates on the floor of\r\nthe first convention and the organizations that they represented have\r\nbitterly fought the I. W. W. from the close of the first convention\r\nup to the present day.\"[112] By no means all of these are necessarily\r\nfakirs, since the outcome of the deliberations of the first convention\r\nwas somewhat different from that anticipated even by the signers of the\r\nmanifesto.\r\n\r\nThere was present a very definite group of anarchists which, though in\r\na rather small minority, was a constituent element in the doctrinal\r\ntypes represented. The term \"industrial unionist\" was one which\r\nreally included practically all the participants. The industrial\r\nunionist may certainly be a socialist, and even of more than one\r\nvariety; and it is also conceivable that the industrial unionist may\r\nbe an anarchist. Consequently the term can hardly be used to mark\r\noff any particular faction in a convention of industrial unionists.\r\nThe parliamentary socialists constituted one of the most powerful\r\nelements at the convention. In fact, the two main hostile groups\r\nwere the impossibilists and the opportunists, the first group\r\ncomprising parliamentary socialists of the Socialist Labor party\r\nand anti-parliamentary socialists, naturally having no political\r\naffiliations; and the latter comprising members of the Socialist party.\r\n\r\nThe line of cleavage then was between the Socialist party and\r\nthe Socialist Labor party, that is, between reformist and\r\ndoctrinaire elements, both parliamentary and both leaning toward\r\nindustrial unionism. In a less prominent position at first was the\r\ndirect-actionist group, anti-political and anarchistic. This antagonism\r\nof ideas was of course the root cause of the defection of the Socialist\r\nLabor party and the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance elements three\r\nyears later, and was responsible for the existence between 1908 and\r\n1916 of two national organizations called the I. W. W. The Socialist\r\nparty, or doctrinaire wing, is very logically the descendant of the\r\ndoctrinaire wing at the first convention, but the direct-actionist or\r\nanti-political wing has, strange to say, grown out of and drawn its\r\nleaders from the reformist Socialist party.\r\n\r\nThese divergent creeds were given color and life by a few men who\r\nreally dominated the convention. There is no organization in existence\r\nhaving less room for hero-worship than the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld. The manifesto provided that all \"powers should rest in the\r\ncollective membership.\" Its members seemed firmly convinced that all\r\nlabor leaders (except I. W. W. organizers!) are really \"misleaders\" of\r\nlabor, and throughout their propaganda literature there is evident this\r\nrepudiation of leaders and apotheosis of the \"collective membership.\"\r\nNevertheless the I. W. W. has been led and misled by leaders ever since\r\nits inception. The first convention rang with the dominant notes of\r\na handful of men: Daniel DeLeon, William D. Haywood, \"Father\" T. J.\r\nHagerty, Eugene V. Debs, William E. Trautmann, A. M. Simons, Clarence\r\nSmith, D. C. Coates, and C. O. Sherman. Debs, Haywood and Simons were\r\nthen, and are today, members of the Socialist party. Simons and DeLeon\r\nwere leaders in the two opposing Socialist political parties, Simons\r\nin the Socialist party and editor of the _Coming Nation_, and DeLeon,\r\neditor of the _Daily People_ and the one dominant and national figure\r\nin the Socialist Labor party. T. J. Hagerty was a Catholic priest. With\r\nthe coöperation of James P. Thompson, and others probably, he framed\r\nthe original I. W. W. Preamble. He was the designer of the chart which\r\nSamuel Gompers referred to as \"Father Hagerty's Wheel of Fortune,\"[113]\r\nand the author of a pamphlet entitled _Economic Discontent_.\r\n\r\nEugene V. Debs, the best known to them all, came into the movement with\r\nall his contagious enthusiasm and eloquence, full of optimism for the\r\nfuture of this new organization.\r\n\r\n    I believe it is possible [he said] for such an organization as\r\n    the Western Federation of Miners to be brought into harmonious\r\n    relation with the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance ... and\r\n    I believe it is possible for these elements ... to combine\r\n    here ... and begin the work of forming a great economic or\r\n    revolutionary organization of the working class so sorely\r\n    needed in the struggle for their emancipation.[114]\r\n\r\nFrom the West came William D. Haywood with many years' experience with\r\nthe Western Federation of Miners in Colorado. He was an experienced\r\norganizer and was full of the militant spirit of the Western Federation\r\nof Miners. He scorned agreements and contracts. Speaking of the Western\r\nFederation of Miners at the first convention he said: \"We have not\r\ngot an agreement existing with any mine manager, superintendent, or\r\noperator at the present time. We have got a minimum scale of wages\" and\r\n\"... the eight-hour day, and we did not have a legislative lobby to\r\naccomplish it.\"[115] And now he came to Chicago to help build up the\r\nsame sort of an organization for not alone the mining industry but for\r\nall industries.\r\n\r\nProbably the most striking figure of all was Daniel DeLeon, editor\r\nof the _Daily People_, a man with a university education, and a\r\ngraduate of the Columbia University Law School. He was active in the\r\norganization of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance in 1895 and was\r\nan officer in the Alliance until it was merged in the I. W. W. He came\r\nto the first convention as a delegate from the Socialist Trade and\r\nLabor Alliance. He, too, believed that harmony was possible.\r\n\r\n    During this process of pounding one another we have both\r\n    learned [he said], both sides have learned, and I hope and\r\n    believe that this convention will bring together those who will\r\n    plant themselves squarely upon the class struggle and will\r\n    recognize the fact that the political expression of labor is\r\n    but the shadow of the economic organization.[116]\r\n\r\nHe had been instrumental in creating the Socialist Trade and Labor\r\nAlliance, of which the Socialist Labor party was thenceforward to be\r\nthe shadow. It transpired, however, that the Socialist Trade and Labor\r\nAlliance actually became the \"shadow\" or understudy of the Socialist\r\nLabor party, and this fact was looked upon by A. M. Simons and others\r\nof the Socialist Labor party as having an ominous significance for any\r\nnew organization to which DeLeon might wish to hitch the Socialist\r\nLabor party as a \"shadow.\" There seemed, in short, to be some suspicion\r\nafloat at the first convention that the Socialist Labor party proposed,\r\nthrough DeLeon, to tuck the I. W. W. under its wing. Hillquit asserts\r\nthat \"the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance had a record of having\r\ncaused more disputes and schisms within the Socialist labor movement\r\nin America in recent years than any other factor, and its affiliation\r\nwith the new movement was fateful for the latter.\"[117] And Simons\r\ndeclared that if DeLeon \"could in some way hitch himself on to this new\r\norganization, he would be able to infuse the semblance of life into\r\nthe political and economic corpses of the S. L. P. and the S. T. & L.\r\nA.\"[118]\r\n\r\nDeLeon emphatically opposed the policy of \"boring from within\"\r\nadvocated by the Socialist party opportunists. He believed it had been\r\ntried as a constructive policy and found wanting. So he proposed to\r\nbuild up on the outside the necessary economic organization, which\r\nfinally should move \"under the protecting guns of a labor political\r\nparty.\"[119]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Socialist party men believed in making use of\r\nthe \"boring from within\" policy among the local unions, and considered\r\nit quite unnecessary for the economic organization to have any\r\npolitical connections whatsoever. They considered the political unity\r\nof the workers less vitally important than did the DeLeon group of\r\ndoctrinaires.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the elements of the heterogeneous labor mass, which\r\nwere to be worked up together into \"One Big Union.\" The thing that\r\nmade union possible in any degree was the binding influence of common\r\nantipathies. It has been suggested that all were at one in being\r\nopposed to a capitalistic society. They had no difficulty in making\r\ncommon cause of their mutual hatred of the capitalistic scheme of\r\nthings. They were perhaps even more able to unite because of common\r\nopposition to certain things which they believed were helping to\r\nperpetuate the capitalist system. Most prominent and powerful of these\r\nwas the craft form of labor-union organization.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] The substance of chs. ii and iii was originally published in the\r\nform of a monograph: _The Launching of the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld_ (University of California Publications in Economics, vol. iv,\r\nno. 1, Berkeley, 1913).\r\n\r\n[79] The three letters, I.

OF L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor, as the alleged embodiment of\r\neverything \"crafty,\" has always been the arch-enemy of the I. W. W. The\r\nconvention opened with this thought to the fore, and throughout the\r\neleven days of its session it was referred to again and again. William\r\nD. Haywood's speech calling the convention to order begins with this\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n    This is the Continental Congress of the working class.... There\r\n    is no organization ... that has for its purpose the same object\r\n    as that for which ... you are called together today.... The\r\n    American Federation of Labor, which presumes to be the labor\r\n    movement of this country, is not a working-class movement....\r\n    You are going to be confronted with the so-called labor\r\n    leader--the man who will tell you ... that the interests of the\r\n    capitalist and the workingman are identical.... There is no\r\n    man who has an ounce of honesty in his make-up but recognizes\r\n    the fact that there is a continuous struggle between the two\r\n    classes, and this organization will be formed, based and\r\n    founded on the class struggle, having in view no compromise and\r\n    no surrender....[120]\r\n\r\n\"It has been said,\" remarked Haywood, \"that this convention was to\r\nform an organization rival to the A. F. of L. This is a mistake. We\r\nare here for the purpose of forming a _labor organization_.\"[121] This\r\ncommon opposition to what they called the \"American _Separation_ of\r\nLabor\" proved to be a fairly adequate \"harmony plank\" in the platform\r\nof these disaffected workingmen. The stress of opposition to the\r\nFederation was, of course, directed chiefly to its craft formation, but\r\nit also featured prominently the reaction against (1) its assumption\r\nof identity of interest between employer and employee, and (2) its\r\nabsolute denial of the necessity of united political action on the part\r\nof the working class.\r\n\r\nTo these industrialists the American Federation of Labor was simply\r\nthe symbol of the craft type of trade union. It was made the object\r\nof the most merciless criticism throughout the convention. One of\r\nits committees drew up a comprehensive indictment of \"old line\r\ntrade-unionism.\" \"The A. F. of L., which is the fine consummate\r\nflower of craft unionism,\" it declares, \"is neither American, nor\r\na federation, nor of labor.\" This, they contend, because (1) it is\r\nadapted only to such conditions as existed in England sixty years ago;\r\n(2) it is divided into 116 warring factions; (3) it discriminates\r\nagainst workingmen because of their race and poverty; (4) its members\r\nare allowed to join the militia and shoot down other union men in time\r\nof strike; and (5) it inevitably creates a certain aloofness among the\r\nskilled workmen--the \"aristocrats of labor\"--toward those not skilled.\r\n\"There are organizations which are affiliated,\" Haywood asserts, \"with\r\nthe A. F. of L. which ... prohibit the initiation of, or conferring\r\nthe obligation on, a colored man; that prohibit the conferring of the\r\nobligation on foreigners.\"[122]\r\n\r\nFrom the opening of the convention it was quite evident that an ideal\r\nlabor union was conceived to be something more than an institution\r\nfor improving the immediate condition of labor. Through it immediate\r\ninterests must be advanced, of course, but its primary object must\r\nbe to make an end of labor as a slave function and to establish in\r\nplace of the wage or capitalist system an industrial commonwealth of\r\nco-operators. The convention was convinced that the craft union was\r\nnot only comparatively helpless in the matter of advancing immediate\r\ninterests, but was absolutely useless as a fulcrum for removing the\r\ncapitalist system. \"The battles of the past,\" declared the manifesto,\r\n\"emphasize this lesson. The textile workers of Lowell, Philadelphia,\r\nand Fall River; the butchers of Chicago; ... the long-struggling\r\nminers of Colorado, hampered by lack of unity and solidarity upon\r\nthe industrial battlefield, all bear witness to the helplessness and\r\nimpotency of labor as at present organized.\"[123]\r\n\r\nThe craft form or organization creates three types very obnoxious\r\nto the industrial unionist, _viz._, the \"aristocrat\" of labor, the\r\n\"union\" scab, and the \"labor lieutenant.\" The \"union\" scab--the man who\r\ncontinues at work at his particular trade when the men of an allied\r\ntrade in the same industry are on strike--is a scab in the sense that\r\nhe is often--through this indirect scabbing--a fatal, perhaps the only\r\nobstacle, to the success of the strike. Haywood gave an illustration of\r\nthis in the butchers' strike in Chicago:\r\n\r\n    For instance, [he said] in the packing plants, the butchers'\r\n    organization was one of the best in the country, reputed to\r\n    be 50,000 strong. They were well disciplined, which is shown\r\n    from the fact that when they were called on strike they quit\r\n    to a man. That is, the butchers quit; but did the engineers\r\n    quit, did the firemen quit, did the men who were running the\r\n    ice-plants quit? They were not in the union, not in that\r\n    particular union. They had agreements with their employers\r\n    which forbade them quitting. The result was that the Butchers'\r\n    Union was practically totally disrupted, entirely wiped\r\n    out.[124]\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that these men who laid so much at the door of\r\nthe \"union\" scab, realized that the latter did not scab on his fellow\r\nunion-men because he enjoyed it. He was forced to be a union scab\r\nbecause his craft had a contract--an agreement with the employer.\r\nCraftism is what it is, because it involves a separate binding\r\nagreement for each trade. These, being contracted independently by\r\neach craft, naturally expired at different dates, so that the several\r\ncrafts in any given industry can never be free to act in unison. Little\r\nreverence for these agreements was shown in the convention.\r\n\r\n    It is a fact [said DeLeon] ... that it is not the unorganized\r\n    scab who breaks the strikes, but the organized craft that\r\n    really does the dirty work; and thus they, each of whom,\r\n    when itself (_sic_) involved in a strike, fights like a\r\n    hero, when not themselves involved, demean themselves like\r\n    arrant scabs; betray their class--all in fatuous reverence to\r\n    \"contracts.\"[125]\r\n\r\nDebs pointed to these same contracts as the cause of defeat. He cited\r\nthe strike on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1888:\r\n\r\n    Some 2,000 engineers and firemen [he said] went out on one of\r\n    the most bitterly contested railroad strikes in the history of\r\n    the country. When they were out, the rest of the employees,\r\n    especially the conductors, who were organized in craft unions\r\n    of their own, remained at their posts, and the union conductors\r\n    piloted the scab engineers over the line.[126]\r\n\r\n\"Union scabbery\" helped to create a kind of \"union snobbery.\" The\r\ncraft idea tended to develop the idea of caste among workingmen, and\r\nthe skilled were set off from the unskilled as the \"aristocracy of\r\nlabor.\" The industrial unionists emphatically declared that a true\r\nlabor union must include all workers, the unskilled and migratory as\r\nwell as the \"aristocrats.\"\r\n\r\n    We are going down in the gutter [said Haywood] to get at the\r\n    mass of the workers and bring them up to a decent plane of\r\n    living. I do not care a snap of my finger whether or not the\r\n    skilled workers join this industrial movement at the present\r\n    time. When we get the unorganized and the unskilled laborer\r\n    into this organization the skilled worker will of necessity\r\n    come here for his own protection. As strange as it may seem to\r\n    you, the skilled worker today is exploiting the laborer beneath\r\n    him, the unskilled man, just as much as the capitalist is.[127]\r\n\r\nBut ultimately, according to Sherman, all workers--not merely the\r\ngroups connoted by the term \"working-class\"--must be grouped in the\r\nproposed organization.\r\n\r\n    We don't propose [he said] to organize only the common man with\r\n    the callous hands, but we want the clerical force; we want the\r\n    soft hands that only get $40 a month--those fellows with No. 10\r\n    cuffs and collars. We want them all, so that when a strike is\r\n    called we can strike the whole business at once.[128]\r\n\r\nA third type condemned by revolutionary unionists was the so-called\r\n\"labor lieutenant.\" This latter \"mis-leader\" of labor was the symbol of\r\nanother objectionable feature of the A. F. of L., _viz._, the identity\r\nof interests assumption. Naturally the idea that the interests of\r\nemployer and employee are identical, is the only consistent one for an\r\norganization based on the craft idea. It is said that Mark Hanna once\r\nreferred to the organizers and officials of the trade unions as the\r\n\"labor lieutenants of the captains of industry.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary (industrial) unionists believed that collusion\r\nexisted between the tool-owners and the labor leaders of the country.\r\nIt was declared on the floor of the convention that \"the trade-union\r\nmovement has become an auxiliary to the capitalist class in order\r\nto hold down the toilers of the land.\"[129] The delegates from\r\nthe Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (members of the Socialist\r\nLabor party, though not formally present as such) were especially\r\nuncompromising on this point. At the 1900 convention of the Socialist\r\nLabor party the following amendment to its constitution was adopted:\r\n\r\n    If any member of the Socialist Labor party accepts office in\r\n    a pure and simple trade or labor organization, he shall be\r\n    considered antagonistically inclined towards the Socialist\r\n    Labor party and shall be expelled. If any officer of a pure and\r\n    simple trade or labor organization applies for membership in\r\n    the Socialist Labor party, he shall be rejected.[130]\r\n\r\nDaniel DeLeon and the other Socialist Labor party men at the convention\r\nhad absolutely no hope for the \"pure and simple\" union. DeLeon believed\r\n\"that the pure and simple leaders give jobs to Socialists for the\r\npurpose of corrupting them, on the principle that the capitalist\r\npoliticians give jobs to workingmen for the purpose of corrupting the\r\nworking class....\" \"The labor movement,\" he said \"has been prostituted\r\nin this country by the jobs ... that the capitalist politicians give to\r\nsome individual workingmen....\"[131]\r\n\r\nThe DeLeon faction was by no means alone in this attitude. The\r\nmajority felt that the American Federation of Labor was hopelessly\r\nentangled in capitalist politics and irrevocably tied up to the\r\ncaptains of industry through its labor lieutenants. On the whole,\r\nthe industrialists had no hope that the American Federation of Labor\r\ncould ever become an industrial organization. Some of them, like A.\r\nM. Simons, believed it possible to further their industrial aim by\r\n\"boring from within\" certain of the constituent unions in the American\r\nFederation of Labor. Others differed--notably the DeLeonites. Their\r\nleader said that the theory of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance\r\nwas,\r\n\r\n    That boring from within, with the labor fakir in possession,\r\n    is a waste of time, and that the only way to do is to stand by\r\n    the workingmen always; to organize them, to enlighten them,\r\n    and whenever a conflict breaks out in which their brothers are\r\n    being fooled and used as food for cannon, to have the Socialist\r\n    Trade and Labor Alliance throw itself in the midst of the fray,\r\n    and sound the note of sense.[132]\r\n\r\n\"We call upon the socialists of the United States,\" said another member\r\nof the S. T. & L. A., \"to get out of the pure and simple organizations\r\nand smash them to pieces.\"[133]\r\n\r\nEugene Debs, too, was convinced of the futility of boring from within.\r\n\"There is but one way,\" he said, \"to effect this great change, and\r\nthat is for the workingman to sever his relations with the American\r\nFederation and join the union that proposes on the economic field to\r\nrepresent his class.\"[134]\r\n\r\nThe industrialists were most at variance on the question of the\r\nproper political attitude of labor organizations; consequently,\r\nthey were not unanimous in their condemnation of the Federation's\r\npolitical polity--or want of it. Moreover, as became evident during\r\nthe hot debate over the political clause, even those who condemned\r\nthe Federation's attitude on politics were quite at outs about\r\nthe political position which should be taken on behalf of the new\r\norganization.[135]\r\n\r\nPresident Gompers took up the cudgels for the American Federation of\r\nLabor. The new movement was inaugurated, he said, \"under the pretext\r\nthat the American Federation of Labor refuses to recognize the changes\r\nwhich are constantly taking place in industry. That it is a pretext\r\ninexcusably ignorant and maliciously false any observer must know.\"\r\nHe goes on to say that \"the permanency of the trade-union movement\r\ndepends upon the recognition ... of the principle of [craft] autonomy\r\nconsistent with the varying phase and transitions in industry.\"[136]\r\nMr. Gompers cited, among others, the case of the Boot and Shoe Workers'\r\nInternational Union. The workers in Lynn, Massachusetts, in a branch of\r\nthe shoe trade--they were makers of \"counters\"--applied for a charter\r\nin the American Federation of Labor. The Federation authorities advised\r\nthem first to join the industrial union of their trade, _viz._, the\r\nBoot and Shoe Workers' International Union. This they declined to do,\r\nand being refused by the American Federation of Labor, joined the\r\nAmerican Labor Union.\r\n\r\nThe first five days of the convention were taken up with the adjustment\r\nof credentials, the explanation of the manifesto, and the indictment\r\nof the American Federation of Labor--\"the consummate flower of craft\r\nunionism.\" On the sixth day the principal piece of constructive\r\nwork confronting the convention--the shaping-up of some sort of a\r\nworkable constitution--was taken out of the hands of the committee\r\nand made the order of the day. Though Simons intimates[137] that the\r\nfirst days of the convention were too much given over to the reign\r\nof the \"jaw-smith,\" yet mixed with all the chaff--unquestionably in\r\nevidence--was much intellectual grain. The ideas and suggestions\r\nbrought out in all these discussions, the resolutions proposed, all\r\nthese, after a crude but critical sifting at the hands of the committee\r\nand the speakers on the floor of the convention, became crystallized in\r\nthe preamble and constitution. The following resolutions, selected and\r\ncondensed from the report of the committee on resolutions, are fairly\r\ntypical:[138]\r\n\r\n    1. To provide for the establishment and maintenance of an\r\n    Educational Bureau comprising a Literature Bureau and a Lecture\r\n    Bureau.\r\n\r\n    3. Resolved, that it be the sense of this convention that\r\n    the labor of each individual unit of society is necessary to\r\n    the welfare of society, and that all are entitled to equal\r\n    compensation.\r\n\r\n    4. Resolved, that the first day of May of each year ... be\r\n    designated as the Labor Day of this organization.\r\n\r\n    6. Resolved, that the seceding workers and seceding\r\n    organizations in the A. F. of L. be required to make a public\r\n    statement of the reason for their secession....\r\n\r\n    8. Resolved, that we recommend as a final solution of the class\r\n    struggle the Social General Strike....\r\n\r\n    9. Resolved, that it is the sense of this convention to endorse\r\n    and provide a perfect system of commercial coöperation.\r\n\r\n    13. Resolved, that it be the sense of this convention that only\r\n    those who are wage-workers be eligible to membership in this\r\n    organization.\r\n\r\n    16. Whereas, there is already established an International\r\n    Bureau of those industrial unions which are based upon the\r\n    class struggle, with headquarters at Berlin, therefore be it\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that this new organization enter into immediate\r\n    relations therewith.\r\n\r\n    20. Resolved, that we condemn militarism in all its forms and\r\n    functions, which are jeopardizing our constitutional rights and\r\n    privileges in the struggle between capital and labor. Be it\r\n    further\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that any members accepting salaried positions to\r\n    defend capitalism, directly or indirectly, should be denied the\r\n    privilege of membership in this organization.\r\n\r\nTo the discussion and emendation of the preamble and constitution\r\nwas devoted the bulk of the time during the last five days of the\r\nconvention.[139] The preamble drawn up by the committee on constitution\r\nwas accepted by the convention practically in the form presented by\r\nthat committee, and without dissent except for the second clause. The\r\nfirst two clauses read as follows:\r\n\r\n    The working class and the employing class have nothing in\r\n    common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are\r\n    found among the millions of working people, and the few, who\r\n    make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.\r\n\r\n    Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the\r\n    toilers come together on the political, as well as on the\r\n    industrial field, and take and hold that which they produce by\r\n    their labor, through an economic organization of the working\r\n    class, without affiliation with any political party.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the \"political field\" in the second clause brought\r\nforth immediate challenge and the whole clause was the subject of\r\nexhaustive debate. Delegate Gilbert, who favored the clause, very\r\nconcisely explained its significance.\r\n\r\n    We are here [he said] to effect an economic organization. There\r\n    are two elements in this convention. One element proposes to\r\n    do away with political action entirely. Another element is\r\n    inclined toward political action. All that this paragraph is\r\n    in essence is this: It first of all states very clearly and\r\n    plainly that this is primarily an economic organization based\r\n    upon the conflict of classes. Secondly, it says in essence\r\n    this: That as individuals you are perfectly free to take such\r\n    political action as you see fit. As an organization, you\r\n    cannot.... Thirdly, it says this: You shall not as an economic\r\n    organization stand committed to any political party at present\r\n    in existence.[140]\r\n\r\nDelegate Simons opposed it, declaring that, \"as it stands it says that\r\nwe are in favor of political action without any political party.\"[141]\r\nDelegate Richter also opposed it on the ground that the struggle\r\nhas really only begun when the workers are brought together on the\r\npolitical and industrial fields,--whereas the preamble implied that at\r\nthat stage the struggle ceases.[142]\r\n\r\nDelegate DeLeon argued at length in support of the clause. To him this\r\n\"political clause,\" as it has since been called, was quite essential to\r\nkeep the proposed organization \"in line and in step with civilization.\"\r\n\"The barbarian,\" he said, \"begins with physical force; the civilized\r\nman ends with that when force is necessary.\"[143] He believed it to\r\nbe absolutely impossible to \"take and hold\" as the preamble puts it,\r\nwithout the protection--or at any rate the harmony--secured through\r\npolitical unity. Of course, the basis of this political unity was\r\nto have no organic connection--not the remotest--with the economic\r\norganization. The clause under discussion recognized the two truths\r\n\"that political action and the means of civilization must be given\r\nan opportunity--and that in this country, for one, it is out of the\r\nquestion to imagine that a political party can 'take and hold.'\"[144]\r\nThis was the Socialist Labor party position. It had been foreshadowed\r\nin its 1900 convention when it endorsed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    Genuine trade-unionism not only must fight in the shop ... but\r\n    must especially, uncompromisingly, at all costs and hazards\r\n    fight the political parties of capitalism on election day. Its\r\n    chief motto must be--\"No union card will justify the political\r\n    scab. Here is a traitor to his class.\"... We recognize in\r\n    the S. T. & L. A. the economic arm of the S. L. P. and its\r\n    indispensable adjunct in its conflict between the working class\r\n    and the capitalist class.[145]\r\n\r\nThe discussion brought out every shade of opinion on the ballot.\r\nThese men were acutely aware of the fact that business is to a great\r\nextent the creator and controller of politics. As one delegate put\r\nit, \"dropping pieces of paper into a hole in a box never did achieve\r\nemancipation for the working class and ... it never will....\"[146] Even\r\nDaniel DeLeon had nothing but contempt for\r\n\r\n    the visionary politician, the man who imagines that by going\r\n    to the ballot box and taking a piece of paper--and throwing it\r\n    in and then rubbing his hands and jollying himself with the\r\n    expectation that through that process, through some mystic\r\n    alchemy, the ballot will terminate capitalism and the socialist\r\n    commonwealth will rise like a fairy out of the ballot-box.[147]\r\n\r\nThe manifesto was very specific in proposing a purely economic\r\norganization. That the issue would be a political organization was the\r\nprophecy of Frank Bohn, an official of the Socialist Trade and Labor\r\nAlliance.\r\n\r\n    Every industrial unionist [he declared] who thoroughly\r\n    understands the deeper mission of his organization will reach\r\n    class-conscious political action. An industrial union cannot\r\n    increase the average wage. In some cases it may be less likely\r\n    than the craft unions to prevent the decrease in wages....\r\n    Socialist to the core must the new economic organization\r\n    be--and when the June convention has painted the skull and\r\n    cross-bones on the door of \"pure and simpledom,\" that last\r\n    working-class compromise with capitalism, there will probably\r\n    issue a political organization strong in numbers, but stronger\r\n    in principle, because raised by the revolutionary spirit high\r\n    above \"mere vote-getting subterfuge.\"[148]\r\n\r\nIn reply to this, A. M. Simons, the editor, declares that,\r\n\r\n    if it is true that the new union is to be less powerful on the\r\n    economic field than the pure and simple unions, and is simply\r\n    to constitute a new political party jabbering a lot of jargon\r\n    about general strikes and installing its officers as rulers of\r\n    the coöperative commonwealth, then it is doomed to a short and\r\n    sickening life.[149]\r\n\r\nA very reasonable interpretation of this political clause is that the\r\nworking class must be united politically, but not necessarily that that\r\nunion is, or is in, or has any connection with, the I. W. W. However,\r\nthe sequel showed that it was fatal to the unity of the organization.\r\nThree years later it proved to be the rock on which the movement split,\r\nbringing about the bifurcated organization we know at the present\r\ntime; with a direct-actionist wing, non-political, and with a new and\r\nexpurgated edition of the preamble, and a DeLeonite or doctrinaire\r\nwing, pro-political--another Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance--with\r\nthe same old preamble and the same old political clause.[150]\r\n\r\nThe constitution provided a highly centralized scheme of administration\r\ninvolving a mixed hierarchy of power. The general organization was\r\ndivided into thirteen international industrial divisions (later called\r\n\"departments\"). Each of these departmental divisions was supposed\r\nto comprise an allied group of industries, grouped together for\r\nadministrative purposes. In the original report of the constitution\r\ncommittee the industrial or occupational \"sphere of influence\" of each\r\ndivision was specified in detail. The world's industries were divided\r\ninto thirteen administrative groups. The report provided that the\r\norganization should be composed of thirteen international industrial\r\nunions, designated as follows:\r\n\r\n    Division 1 shall be composed of all persons working in the\r\n    following industries: Clerks, salesmen, tobacco, packing\r\n    houses, flour mills, sugar refineries, dairies, bakeries, and\r\n    kindred industries.\r\n\r\n    Division 2: Brewery, wine and distillery workers.\r\n\r\n    Division 3: Floriculture, stock and general farming.\r\n\r\n    Division 4: Mining, milling, smelting and refining coal, ores,\r\n    metals, salt and iron.\r\n\r\n    Division 5: Steam railway, electric railway, marine, shipping,\r\n    and teaming.\r\n\r\n    Division 6: All building employees.\r\n\r\n    Division 7: All textile industrial employees.\r\n\r\n    Division 8: All leather industrial employees.\r\n\r\n    Division 9: All wood-working employees excepting those engaged\r\n    in building departments.\r\n\r\n    Division 10: All metal industrial employees.\r\n\r\n    Division 11: All glass and pottery employees.\r\n\r\n    Division 12: All paper mills, chemical, rubber, broom, brush\r\n    and jewelry industries.\r\n\r\n    Division 13: Parks, highways, municipal, postal service,\r\n    telegraph, telephone, schools and educational institutions,\r\n    amusements, sanitary, printing, hotel, restaurant and laundry\r\n    employees.[151]\r\n\r\nThis section provoked instant debate. In fact, two days and a\r\nhalf--about half the time given to the whole constitution--were given\r\nover to the discussion of this clause.[152] Many delegates considered\r\nthat such a specific division was not only a practical impossibility,\r\non account of the very definite limits to the jurisdiction of most\r\nindustries, but was a very inconsistent step for an industrial\r\norganization to take, since in their opinion it was nothing more or\r\nless than a recreation of craft lines.[153] There was considerable\r\nfeeling in evidence that this clause did not satisfy the provision\r\nof the manifesto for \"craft autonomy locally, industrial autonomy\r\ninternationally, and working-class unity generally.\" Flaws and\r\ninconsistencies without end could, of course, be found in such a\r\ncategorical division, and they were pointed out by critical delegates\r\nwith much gusto. The main idea in this attempt at departmental\r\ndemarcation of industries was that a centralized administration was\r\nimperative. Most of the delegates agreed to this. They believed that\r\neven the industry, although the unit or cell of the new structure,\r\nshould not be the dominant basis of the administration. That must be\r\ndepartmental.\r\n\r\n    Any of these industries [said Delegate Goodwin] are subsidiary\r\n    and supporting the whole organization.... The tendency of\r\n    capitalist development is concentration. We are going from\r\n    industrial production to departmental production. It won't\r\n    be many years ... till we have departmental production. The\r\n    tendency in development in the early stages of capital is to\r\n    go into industries, and the later tendency is to divide into\r\n    departments, and these departments are international....[154]\r\n\r\nAs finally amended, the clause omitted any specific category of\r\ndepartments and industries and simply provided for thirteen departments\r\nwith appropriate subdivisions. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n    Art. I., Sec. 2.--And shall be composed of thirteen\r\n    international industrial divisions subdivided into industrial\r\n    unions of closely related industries in the appropriate\r\n    organizations for representation in the departmental\r\n    administration. The subdivisions, international and national\r\n    industrial unions, shall have complete industrial autonomy\r\n    in their respective internal affairs; provided, the General\r\n    Executive Board shall have power to control these industrial\r\n    unions in matters concerning the interests of the general\r\n    welfare.[155]\r\n\r\nThe list of specifically divided industries was later replaced in\r\nthe constitution, but in a very much improved form. Wm. E. Trautmann\r\nhas worked this up even further, and in 1911 published a still more\r\nimproved outline in which the number of departments is reduced to\r\nsix.[156]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional convention also made provision for other and\r\nsubordinate bodies, _i. e._, industrial councils, which might be\r\nformed. These were to comprise seven or more local unions in two or\r\nmore industries and the local industrial union. These local unions\r\nwere the smallest units of organization then provided for, except that\r\nwhen isolated individuals applied for membership in a locality where no\r\nlocal union existed, such persons were admitted into the organization\r\nas \"individual\" members directly attached to the general organization.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applied throughout. In case, then, there were\r\nnot a sufficient number[157] of locals in any one industry to form\r\nan industrial department, the local was directly responsible to the\r\ngeneral organization. Then, as now, the great majority of local unions\r\nwere chartered directly by the general organization. At the close\r\nof the first convention the Western Federation of Miners became the\r\n\"Mining Department\" of the I. W. W.; the Metal Workers became the\r\n\"Metal Department\"; and the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees,\r\nthe \"Transportation Department.\" All local unions are industrial in\r\ncharacter, _i. e._, each one makes the shop its unit and comprises all\r\nthe crafts engaged in and around the shop. The mucker in the mine must\r\nbelong to the same union as the man who runs the drill. The idea is to\r\nget into the same union all those workers who are coöperating for the\r\nproduction of a given class of products.\r\n\r\nThe officers provided for were: a General President, a General\r\nSecretary-Treasurer, and a General Executive Board composed of these\r\ntwo officers and the Presidents of the International Industrial\r\nDivision.[158] The constitutional committee recommended\r\n\r\n    that this convention elect a provisional Board of seven to\r\n    conduct affairs of this organization until the next national\r\n    convention. The said provisional Board shall consist of the\r\n    National President, National Secretary-Treasurer and five other\r\n    members, two of these five to be elected at large, one to be\r\n    elected from the W. F. of M., one from the United Metal Workers\r\n    and one from the U. B. of R. E.... The provisional Board shall\r\n    also have the duty of a committee on style to revise the\r\n    constitution and submit a draft to the next convention.[159]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this recommendation, the Provisional Board was\r\nelected as follows: C. O. Sherman, Metal Workers, General President;\r\nWilliam E. Trautmann, Industrial Workers Club, of Cincinnati, General\r\nSecretary-Treasurer; John Riordan, American Labor Union, member at\r\nlarge; F. W. Cronin, American Labor Union, member at large; Frank\r\nMcCabe, United Brotherhood of Railway Employees; Charles Kirkpatrick,\r\nMetal Workers, and C. H. Moyer, Western Federation of Miners. The\r\nGeneral Executive Board was given great power. In its hands was\r\nplaced the entire responsibility for the conduct of the affairs of\r\nthe organization between conventions. This board was given full power\r\nto issue charters to all subordinate bodies--industrial departments,\r\nindustrial councils, and local unions; to supervise the work of general\r\nadministration and audit the books of the general office; to levy\r\nspecial assessments when any of the subordinate bodies are engaged in\r\nstrike and the condition of their local treasuries makes it necessary;\r\nto supervise and control the publication of the official organ and to\r\nelect its editor.\r\n\r\nSpecially worthy of note were the powers given the General Executive\r\nBoard in regard to strikes and agreements. The clauses referring to\r\nthese two points are here given:\r\n\r\n    In case the members of a subordinate organization of the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World are involved in strike,\r\n    regularly ordered by the organization, or General Executive\r\n    Board, or involved in a lockout, if in the opinion of the\r\n    President and General Executive Board it becomes necessary to\r\n    call out any other union or unions, or organization, they shall\r\n    have full power to do so.\r\n\r\n    Any agreement entered into between the members of any local\r\n    union or organization, and their employers, as a final\r\n    settlement of any difficulty or trouble between them, shall\r\n    not be considered valid or binding until the same shall have\r\n    the approval of the General Executive Board of the Industrial\r\n    Workers of the World.[160]\r\n\r\nThe President, of course, had more extended authority than the\r\nother members of the Board, and was given entire supervision of the\r\norganization throughout its jurisdiction; but his official acts and\r\ndecisions, as well as those of the General Executive Board, were at\r\nall times subject to appeal to the general convention, the decisions\r\nof which body, in turn, might be put to the final test of ratification\r\nby a referendum to the general membership. Thus the rank and file were\r\nsupposed to be the final arbiters. Throughout the hierarchy \"home rule\"\r\nwas to be accorded in all matters of strictly local concern, such as\r\ndetails of administration, by-laws, _etc._, but matters connected with\r\nthe general welfare were made subjects of industrial rather than craft\r\nautonomy. Revenues were derived from charter fees, initiation fees and\r\ndues, all of which were made very low. A fixed proportion of all such\r\nrevenues was to be paid into a central defense fund.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that matters which were of purely internal concern\r\nwere much more narrowly interpreted than in the orthodox union.\r\nMost things affecting one craft are frankly declared to effect all\r\ncrafts--even all industries--and only a few matters like by-laws and\r\nother routine affairs were considered to be of merely local concern.\r\nThe constitution was built up around the socialistic motto, \"An injury\r\nto one is the concern of all.\" The document was merely provisional,\r\nand in a crude way served as an initial guide for drawing up a more\r\ncomprehensive and permanent constitution later on.\r\n\r\nThat the constitution was at least acceptable to most of the delegates\r\nwas evidenced by the fact that it was adopted by a six to one\r\nvote,[161] and more definitely proven on roll-call for installation\r\nof organizations under the new constitution. Besides the five leading\r\norganizations--the Western Federation of Miners, the American Labor\r\nUnion, United Brotherhood of Railway Employees, United Metal Workers,\r\nand the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, six local unions and\r\nthirty-nine individuals (representing no organization) unanimously\r\nvoted for installation.[162] Having elected its officers and chosen\r\nChicago as its headquarters, the Convention adjourned, _sine die_, July\r\n8, 1905.\r\n\r\nDelegate Kiehn (representing the Longshoremen of Hoboken, N. J.),\r\namong others, refused to install his union. He explained his vote,\r\nstating that in his opinion the constitution was \"not according to the\r\nspirit of the manifesto.\" He believed that dividing the industrial\r\nactivities of society into thirteen divisions meant the creation--not\r\nthe destruction--of craft lines, and also that \"it [the constitution]\r\ngives the President or the Executive Board of this organization czarish\r\npowers that are not given to the executive officers of any pure and\r\nsimple organization in this country.\"[163]\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the outcome of the convention was very different from\r\nwhat those most interested had anticipated. In its final form, the\r\npreamble and constitution were not exactly shaped to the provisions\r\nof the January manifesto--at any rate they did not seem to satisfy\r\nthe authors of the latter document. This is partly to be explained\r\nby the significant fact that Daniel DeLeon was not present at the\r\nJanuary conference, although the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance\r\nand the Socialist Labor party were represented by one of their\r\norganizers--Frank Bohn. We have seen that the fear of Socialist\r\nLabor party domination or Socialist Labor party wire-pulling and the\r\nfear of the influence of DeLeon were one and the same. A. M. Simons\r\ndeclared several months before the Convention that \"nothing could more\r\nthoroughly damn the work of the conference which meets in Chicago next\r\nJune than the prevalence of the idea that it was an attempt to revive\r\nthe S. T. & L. A....\"[164] These fears were to a certain limited extent\r\nrealized. The same writer says that \"At the first conference [the June\r\nconvention] Daniel DeLeon with a crowd of followers obtained such power\r\nin the organization as to destroy its original point of view. Later\r\nhe was thrown out, or resigned, or threw the others out [according to\r\nwho is telling the story].\"[165] In precisely what way the original\r\npoint of view was destroyed is not easily determined. Even Simons\r\nadmitted that \"the only line of cleavage between bodies representing\r\nany strength was over the method of organization.\" And \"even here,\" he\r\nbelieved that \"the difficulty was much less fundamental than the heat\r\nof the debate would indicate.\"[166]\r\n\r\nBeyond any doubt the influence of the Socialist Labor party (through\r\nthe delegates of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance), DeLeonism, as\r\nit was called, was wider than this statement would indicate. A \"paper\"\r\norganization, outnumbered by all of the organizations in what we have\r\ncalled the \"Big Five,\" it unquestionably was influential to a degree\r\nquite out of proportion to its numbers, and in that way, at least, it\r\ndominated the convention. The political clause, which later proved such\r\na rock of dissension and which was not passed in the first convention\r\nwithout considerable opposition, was one mark left in the constitution\r\nby DeLeonism. The virtual overthrowing of the \"boring-from-within\"\r\npolicy was another mark left _out_ of the constitution by DeLeonism.\r\nBoth of these departures were of great importance but not the most\r\nvital by any means.\r\n\r\nThe primary importance of the Western Federation of Miners in these\r\nbeginnings cannot be too much emphasized. In a quite real sense the I.\r\nW. W. was born out of the Western Federation. It was from this militant\r\nminers union that most of the financial bone and sinew came for setting\r\nin motion the machinery of the new union. The Federation constituted\r\nprobably one-third of the membership of the organization which had in\r\nits mining department (while it did have it!) by all odds the most\r\nvigorously militant of all American unions. The Federation's bitter\r\nfights with the mine operators, especially in Colorado, Montana, and\r\nIdaho, prepared the ground and spread the sentiment for the extension\r\nof revolutionary industrialism beyond the relatively narrow limits of\r\nthe metalliferous mining industry. It was not a coincidence that the I.\r\nW. W. sprang into being so hard on the heels of the strike terrors of\r\nTelluride and Cripple Creek. A delegate at the second (1906) convention\r\ndeclared that the Butte Miners Union was the father of the I. W. W.[167]\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the I. W. W. did continue to exist, and,\r\nperiodically, to thrive after the Western Federation broke away, it is\r\nsafe to say that had it not been for the Federation, with its practical\r\nstrength and the stimulating example of its history, there would\r\nhave been no I. W. W. It was Western-Federationism quite as much as\r\nDeLeonism that moulded the I. W. W. at its inception.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is not quite true that the first convention was \"captured\"\r\nby the DeLeon element, as so many insinuate. DeLeon was elected to no\r\noffice and neither of the General Executive Board members elected at\r\nlarge were members of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance. Debs\r\ninsists that \"DeLeon did not 'capture' the organization and Debs is\r\nnot 'disgusted' with it.\"[168] The dominance of DeLeonism was, then,\r\na supremacy of ideas. These ideas may have been \"insane delusions\"\r\nand finally disastrous to the harmony of the movement; but they were\r\npresumably defended by their chief sponsor and his followers, in firm\r\nconviction that they were essential to the growth of the movement.\r\nDeLeon said on the floor of the convention, \"When I came to Chicago to\r\nthis convention, I came absolutely without any private ax to grind or\r\nany private grudge to gratify. In fact ... I have had but one foe ...\r\nand that foe is the capitalist class.\"[169]\r\n\r\nHermann Richter, now general secretary of the Socialist Labor party\r\nwing of the I. W. W., writes in a recent number of their official\r\norgan: \"During the proceedings of the [first] convention it became\r\napparent that not all delegates understood, or were in free accord with\r\nthe spirit and intent of the organization.\"[170] This was very natural\r\nconsidering the composition of the gathering. The sequel proved that\r\nthis was the least of the troubles in embryo at that first convention.\r\n\r\nAll this friction and internal discord was naturally made to loom\r\nlarge in the editorials of the _American Federationist_; Gompers, in\r\nfact, squinted hard enough at the Chicago conference to see absolutely\r\nnothing in it. The August (1905) number contained the following, under\r\nthe caption \"Those 'World Redeemers' at Chicago\":\r\n\r\n    After an effort of more than six months ... the distribution\r\n    of tons upon tons of circulars and \"literature\" throughout\r\n    America and every other country throughout the globe ... what\r\n    was the result? The mountain labored and brought forth a mouse,\r\n    and a very silly little mouse at that.... And out of this\r\n    material [the S. T. and L. A. and the A. L. U.] they proclaim\r\n    themselves the \"Industrial Workers of the World.\" Their nerve\r\n    is so colossal that it is positively ludicrous. Of course the\r\n    two and a half million ... workmen in the trade-union movement\r\n    are entirely oblivious that they are included.... The wheel\r\n    of fortune, otherwise known as ex-Father Hagerty's chart, was\r\n    adopted as a \"plan\" of organization. This plan is so unique\r\n    and so fantastic that we accord it space in our columns and\r\n    thus give it historic importance.... [And finally he prophesies\r\n    that] as time goes on the active participants in the labor\r\n    movement of the future, students, thinkers, historians, will\r\n    record the Chicago meeting as the most vapid and ridiculous in\r\n    the annals of those who presume to speak in the name of labor,\r\n    and the participants in the gathering as the most stupendous\r\n    impossibles the world has yet seen.[171]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of dissension on the inside and bitter abuse and\r\nmisrepresentation on the outside, the industrialists were, on the\r\nwhole, very optimistic about the prospects of the new-born I. W. W. and\r\nheld high hopes for its future. In spite of the emphatic declaration\r\nof the manifesto that the I. W. W. \"should be established as the\r\neconomic organization of the working class, without affiliation with\r\nany political party,\" the newspapers and even the labor press persisted\r\nin representing the movement as a political one. Thus the Milwaukee\r\n_Journal_ said:\r\n\r\n    The Socialists are still earnestly advocating the formation of\r\n    a new national organization in the hope of downing the American\r\n    Federation of Labor, as the Federation is opposed to making the\r\n    labor union a political organization.[172]\r\n\r\nThe _Advance Advocate_, a labor organ, had this to say:\r\n\r\n    And now a new industrial union is to be launched in Chicago. It\r\n    is going to revolutionize the whole labor movement according to\r\n    the manifesto of its promoters. It is going into politics. We\r\n    predict that it will fail.[173]\r\n\r\nThe Iowa State Federation of Labor issued the following statement:\r\n\r\n    A few disgruntled office-seekers and would-be politicians\r\n    have seen fit to criticize the present methods of our trade\r\n    organizations, and these same people have issued a call for a\r\n    convention to be held in the city of Chicago, June 27, 1905, to\r\n    form an organization, ... the avowed purpose of which is the\r\n    complete annihilation of the present trade-union movement by\r\n    political methods.[174]\r\n\r\nThe expectation that there would be a general secession from the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor to the new organization was not realized\r\nand there was practically no American Federation of Labor material in\r\nthe new body. In numbers it seemed, in view of later shrinkage, to be\r\nat high tide. The reports of the convention estimated the membership\r\nat 60,000, and A. M. Simons estimated that at the very least the\r\norganization would in six months have 100,000 members.[175] The twelve\r\norganizations finally installed represented a membership of 49,010.\r\nThis excluded the thirty-nine \"individual\" members. In regard to this\r\nVincent St. John writes: \"I know that the Annual Convention reports\r\nclaim 60,000 members, but the books of the organization did not justify\r\nany such claim, and in fact the average paid-up membership, without the\r\nW. F. of M. (27,000), for the first year of the organization was 14,000\r\nin round numbers.\"[176]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. was organized, as the constitution expressed it, to\r\n\"subserve the immediate interests of the working class and effect their\r\nfinal emancipation.\" The attempt to realize this \"final emancipation\"\r\nwas the thing which marked off the I. W. W. from the typical craft\r\nunion. This latter body is _craft_ conscious; the I. W. W. is _class_\r\nconscious. The structural and organic form it assumed at the first\r\nconvention made for the stupefaction of craft consciousness and the\r\nstimulation of class consciousness. The idea of the class conflict\r\nwas really the bottom notion or \"first cause\" of the I. W. W. The\r\nindustrial union type was adopted because it would make it possible to\r\nwage this class war under more favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is true the Socialist and Socialist Labor parties are working for\r\nthe ultimate freedom of the working class, but the (Chicago) I. W. W.\r\nconsiders their method--political action--a snare and a delusion, and\r\n(here both the Detroit and Chicago factions came together) absolutely\r\nimpotent when used alone. It is rather significant that every member\r\nof the provisional board elected at the convention was a member of the\r\nSocialist party. But they emphatically declared that the Socialist\r\nparty was not to be involved in any way; and it never did become\r\ninvolved except as an enemy. On the other hand, the Socialist Labor\r\nparty did, through the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, indirectly\r\naffect the work of the first convention.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist element was weak in 1905, and the anarchistic leanings\r\nnow so prominent in the direct-actionist wing of the organization\r\nwere then quite overshadowed by the socialistic and industrial\r\nphases of the movement. Carlton says that \"the Industrial Workers\r\nmay be compared with the Knights of Labor shorn of their idealism\r\nand saturated with class-conscious Socialism\";[177] and he might\r\nhave added, with their decentralized administrative system replaced\r\nby a very strongly centralized one--this constituting a fundamental\r\ndistinction between the I. W. W. and the _Confédération Générale du\r\nTravail_, a decentralized organization. Nor should the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World be quite shorn of idealism. That must surely be\r\nidealistic which is \"saturated with class-conscious socialism.\" This\r\nwas amply demonstrated at the constitutional convention. Their idealism\r\nwas given more of a pragmatic character by the persistent tendency to\r\nplace socialism on an industrial rather than a political basis. The\r\nimmediate struggle must take place primarily in the shop--at the point\r\nof production--only secondarily at the polls.\r\n\r\n\"By organizing industrially,\" claims the Industrial Worker, \"we are\r\nforming the structure of the new society within the shell of the\r\nold.\"[178] And here he evidences an idea of the future state of society\r\nand the method of its realization, rather new even to the socialist,\r\nand somewhat akin to that of the anarchists. The First Convention\r\nsurely laid its plans, crude as they were, with an eye to the future.\r\nThe scope of organization implied that the proletariat of the future\r\nwould include more, by far, than the unskilled; that all those\r\ngainfully employed in whatever kind or grade of work would some day\r\nbecome proletarians, in spirit at least, and get together in this \"one\r\nbig union.\"\r\n\r\nThe first constitution, crude and provisional as it was, made room for\r\nall the world's workers and so at the beginning is a vast and nearly\r\nempty structure, with groups of the lower grades of workers in some of\r\nthe basic industries in their proper places in the scheme, but with\r\nall the rest a hollow shell. Whether this empty structure will ever\r\nbe \"filled up\" is a question which time will decide. George Speed,\r\nformerly a member of the General Executive Board (direct-actionist\r\nwing), has characterized this convention as the \"greatest\r\nconglomeration of freaks that ever met in convention.\" This may have\r\nbeen true, for freak ideas often did bob up in the convention and some\r\nof them got fixed in the constitution, but at heart this was a vital\r\nmove, impelled by high and serious motives.[179]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] _Proceedings, First I.

W. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMAIDEN EFFORTS ON THE ECONOMIC FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adjournment of the organizing convention in July, 1905, left the\r\nbody it had created in a very chaotic condition. The time and attention\r\nof the delegates was so exclusively taken up with the problem of\r\nbuilding up \"one big union\" out of many little unions and the task of\r\nworking out a harmony platform of law and policy on which all could\r\ncome together, that the matter of business management was almost\r\nentirely neglected. Indeed some of the circumstances surrounding\r\nthe I. W. W. at its inception quite precluded the ordered and\r\nefficient procedure possible to a well manned and adequately financed\r\norganization. The I. W. W. was not well manned and was practically\r\ndestitute of financial resources. The dearth of ability and especially\r\nthe want of honesty in its managing personnel were to become all too\r\nevident long before the second convention had come to a close, as was\r\nalso its practically bankrupt financial status. Although there were\r\nthree rather formidable-looking departments nominally organized as\r\nsuch--_viz._: mining, metal and machinery, and transportation--none\r\nof these except the mining department represented material accessions\r\neither numerically or financially, and the early defection of the\r\nWestern Federation of Miners quite broke down this one and, what was\r\neven more important, cut off from the Industrial Workers of the World\r\nthe great bulk of its financial resources.\r\n\r\nThe industrial-union idea made marked headway among the trade unions\r\nof the United States during the first year of the existence of the I.\r\nW. W., and this was very largely due to the influence and example of\r\nthat organization. Organizers were sent to those places where serious\r\nfriction existed between trade-unionists and employers, or between\r\ntrade-unionists and the American Federation of Labor. The I. W. W.\r\ndevoted very little attention at that time to the unorganized; its\r\nenergy was chiefly centered on the reformation of the craft unions--a\r\npolicy of dual unionism. The Federation lost rather heavily in some\r\nquarters to the I. W. W., the disaffection proving most marked among\r\nthe brewers and machinists. Max S. Hayes, in reviewing the situation at\r\nthe end of the year 1905, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    The elements that are dissatisfied with the A. F. of L. are\r\n    naturally looking askance at the I. W. W., which body appears\r\n    to be gaining strength in New York, Chicago, and smaller\r\n    places, especially in the West. A national officer of the\r\n    brewers told me a few week ago that the rank and file in\r\n    many parts of the country are clamoring to cut loose from\r\n    the Federation and join the Industrialists.... Still another\r\n    national officer, a Socialist, by the way, said he had visited\r\n    the little city of Schenectady, N. Y., recently and found the\r\n    machinists, metal polishers and several other trades unions in\r\n    open revolt against their national organization and going into\r\n    the camp of the Industrial Workers. Some of the garment working\r\n    crafts and textile workers are also affected. It begins to look\r\n    as though we are to have another war similar to the struggle\r\n    between the old Knights of Labor and the American Federation of\r\n    Labor.[180]\r\n\r\nThis same unrest and dissatisfaction with the condition of trade-union\r\norganization was evident among many local unions of the United\r\nMine Workers of America. Only two local unions of the Mine Workers\r\nhad finally joined the Industrial Workers of the World at the first\r\nconvention,[181] but before the end of the year there were several\r\nothers desiring admission. In many cases, however, they were unable to\r\ngo into the I. W. W. because they had contracts signed up with the mine\r\noperators, and must perforce await their expiration before any action\r\ncould be taken. The Mine Workers' locals at Barrow, Muddy Valley,\r\nand Elkville (Ill.) were in precisely this situation. They reported\r\nthemselves at the second convention as desirous of admission, but\r\nthat immediate transfer of allegiance was impossible because they had\r\ntwo-year contracts with the operators which did not expire until April,\r\n1908.[182] Although in these instances the contracts were respected and\r\nthe locals did not join the I. W. W., that result was not due to any\r\nmoral influence emanating from the Industrial Workers of the World,\r\nwho, of course, repudiated the validity of contracts with employers.\r\nThey believed that, as Haywood expressed it, \"as all is fair in love\r\nand war, industrial unionists should abrogate all agreements which\r\nwould compel them to violate the principles of unionism.\"[183]\r\n\r\nFriction between the Industrial Workers of the World and the American\r\nFederation of Labor continued, of course, to be in evidence. The\r\nnominal possession of a defense fund by the I. W. W., and the want of\r\nsuch a feature in the Federation, doubtless appealed to craft unions in\r\ntime of need. For that reason, if for no other, many craft unionists\r\nhave felt that Haywood had some reason for saying that \"the only\r\nfunction which the American Federation of Labor can assume is to act as\r\nan advisory board of the trade-union movement,\" and that \"the ideas\r\nof Mr. Gompers are hoary, aged, moss-covered relics of the days of the\r\nox-team and the pony express, when the craftsmen owned or controlled\r\nthe tools of production.\"[184]\r\n\r\nThere were a few trade unions which joined the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World as a last resort or merely to spite the American\r\nFederation. Such was the case with the Stogie Makers, who constituted\r\nan independent organization in January, 1906, and who, having been\r\nfor some reason denied a charter in the American Federation of\r\nLabor, finally, and with noisy repudiation of the principles of the\r\nFederation, joined the I. W. W.[185]\r\n\r\nTrouble most commonly arose between the Industrial Workers and the\r\nFederation in time of strike. The Industrial Workers objected to what\r\nthey called the \"unfair interference of the A. F. of L. in I. W. W.\r\nstrikes.\" Numerous protests against this alleged meddlesomeness of\r\nthe Federation were made on the floor of the second convention. The\r\nfollowing excerpt from the report of General-Secretary Trautmann to the\r\nconvention will serve for illustration:\r\n\r\n    ... strike-breakers were engaged by the American Federation of\r\n    Labor officers to take the places of members of the I. W. W.\r\n    In Youngstown, Ohio, in San Pedro [Cal.], in Yonkers and in\r\n    many other places committees were sent to employers demanding\r\n    the discharge of I. W. W. supporters; special boycotts have\r\n    been declared against the goods made in factories where\r\n    members of the Industrial Workers of the World are employed,\r\n    as, for instance, in St. Louis, Mo., and Butte, Mont.... In\r\n    Schenectady, where the I. W. W. efforts gained advantages for\r\n    others, too; in Cleveland, Ohio, where the I. W. W. bricklayers\r\n    walked out on strike in sympathy with striking hod-carriers,\r\n    members of the A. F. of L., and refused an offer of ten per\r\n    cent increase in wages and a closed shop contract, if they\r\n    would desert the building laborers, which they refused to do;\r\n    in Newark, N. J., where the I. W. W. shoemakers refused to work\r\n    with the strike-breakers engaged to defeat strikers of another\r\n    organization not in the I. W. W., and similar cases can be\r\n    recorded to show that the I. W. W. members are not organized\r\n    for the purpose of retaliation against members of their\r\n    class....[186]\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor was undoubtedly often guilty of\r\nattempts of the kind just mentioned--activities which were looked upon\r\nby the \"Wobblies\" as crafty methods of undermining and antagonizing\r\nthe work of their organization. It happened more than once during\r\nthat first year of the younger organization's existence, and has\r\nhappened on the occasion of many an industrial conflict since that\r\ntime. However, the blame lies not entirely at the door of the\r\nFederation, nor has it alone been guilty of such practices. It is, in\r\nfact, quite likely that the first provocation to interference arose\r\nfrom the persistence of the I. W. W. in the policy of organizing--or\r\nrather of annexing to itself--unions already organized, and usually\r\nso organized in the American Federation of Labor itself. This policy\r\nof double affiliation was warmly discussed at the first convention,\r\nbut no definite official decision of the convention appears in the\r\nstenographic report of proceedings. The I. W. W. has been accused of\r\ndeliberately agitating among unions already organized, and that in the\r\nface of open declarations that the I. W. W. does not believe in dual\r\norganization. It is true that such declarations of policy may have been\r\nmade by I. W. W. speakers, but it has not been _officially_ declared\r\nto be the policy of the organization. A sharp distinction should be\r\ndrawn here between reorganizing, or attempting to reorganize, already\r\norganized bodies--dual organizing activities--which are not expressly\r\napproved or condemned, and the condition of dual organism--or dual\r\nmembership--which last is expressly forbidden. No local union of the I.\r\nW. W. may belong to the American Federation of Labor or to any other\r\nnational organization.[187]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. has constantly been guilty of agitating in and building\r\nfrom the old craft unions, and in the earlier days of its history most\r\nof its work consisted in thus \"boring from within\" the established\r\nunions. It is only in later years that it has even approximately\r\nlived up to its avowed policy of organizing the unorganized--the\r\nunskilled--the floating laborer. Consequently the provocation of the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor, and craft unions generally, to retaliate\r\nfor the alleged meddlesomeness of the I. W. W. was even greater then\r\nthan it is now.\r\n\r\nThe vigor of this retaliation on the part of the craft unions\r\nwas evidenced by the action taken by such organizations as the\r\nInternational Association of Machinists, the United Brotherhood of\r\nCarpenters and Joiners, the United Cloth Cap and Hat Makers, the United\r\nBrotherhood of Leather Workers, and others, which \"decreed that the\r\nmere joining of the Industrial Workers of the World would deprive any\r\nman or woman of the right to work in industries controlled by these\r\ncombinations.\"[188]\r\n\r\nThis strenuous opposition was largely the cause of more or less\r\ncompromising on the part of the Industrial Workers of the World\r\nwith the craft-union idea, though, of course, the very weakness\r\nof the new movement and the hard-fixed habit of years of life and\r\nwork under the old craft form was a potent factor here. This much\r\nis plain from the record of those early days of I. W. W. history.\r\nMany of its constituent unions retained to a considerable degree the\r\ncharacteristics of craft unions, and more than that--some of the I. W.\r\nW. locals (boasted types and rallying centers for industrial unionism)\r\nwere nothing more or less than craft locals. Even this extremity was\r\nno doubt forced upon many locals on account of the lack of knowledge\r\nof industrial unionism among workingmen, and this made necessary that\r\nrather ambiguous phenomenon of a revolutionary industrial union largely\r\ncomposed of craft or pseudo-craft units. The delegates to the second\r\nconvention had to face this very impossible situation. A typical one\r\nwas that of the Bartenders and Waiters Local Union No. 83 of Chicago,\r\nconcerning which Delegate Shenkan of San Francisco said:\r\n\r\n    [This] local is a craft organization whose members do not\r\n    even follow the vocation their charter would designate. Most\r\n    of their members work in other lines of industry, such as\r\n    cigar-making, shoemaking, painting, and quite a number of\r\n    diversified kinds of work during week days, while on Sundays\r\n    they work as bartenders and waiters at picnics, balls, _etc._\r\n    ...[189]\r\n\r\nThe convention was very desirous that this condition be remedied as\r\nsoon as possible, and a resolution was finally passed stipulating that\r\nthe General Executive Board must always organize so far as possible\r\non industrial lines: \"The incoming General Executive Board is hereby\r\ndirected to organize the new recruits in and by industries, and to\r\npromote the education in industrialism among those men to whom charters\r\nmay have been issued upon a craft system before they could be enrolled\r\nin the I. W. W.\"[190] In his report to the convention General Secretary\r\nTrautmann recommended that\r\n\r\n    as a safeguard against the possible drifting of such [craft]\r\n    unions into permanent craft organizations, it should be\r\n    understood and made mandatory that as soon as a union of\r\n    employees in any given industry is formed, all those in such\r\n    craft unions must transfer to the respective industrial\r\n    body.... But all recruiting craft unions should be chartered\r\n    directly from the general administration, so that constant\r\n    control can be kept over the affairs of such organizations,\r\n    and the proper alignment be directed as soon as such [action]\r\n    appears to be opportune and necessary.[191]\r\n\r\nHowever, this antagonism from outside craft unions, and these\r\ninvoluntary internal compromises with the craft-union idea were not the\r\nmost serious difficulties which now beset the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld. The organization was threatened with wholesale defection and\r\nvery soon actually suffered it in some quarters. During the spring of\r\n1906 it became evident that a movement was afoot in the lumber camps of\r\nthe northwest to organize the lumber workers in a general union outside\r\nof the I. W. W. Moreover, it appeared that the moving spirit in the\r\nagitation was one Daniel MacDonald--charter member of the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World from the old American Labor Union--a man who had\r\nnot long since been an organizer for the I. W. W., and who must at the\r\ntime have been a member of that organization, since he was sent as a\r\ndelegate to the second convention. Mr. MacDonald explained the nature\r\nof the proposed organization in a letter to Mr. James Brookfield of\r\nCrescent City, California, dated at Butte, Montana, March 27, 1906. He\r\ndoes not mention the I. W. W. He writes that\r\n\r\n    there is a movement on foot now in this state [Montana] and\r\n    throughout the western country to organize a United Lumber\r\n    Workers' general organization, to be composed of all men\r\n    engaged in the lumber industry.... This organization is to be\r\n    constructed on lines broad enough and having sufficient scope\r\n    to meet every essential requirement of the men engaged in the\r\n    lumber industry, and to give them general support, uniform\r\n    benefits and the universal respect and protection so woefully\r\n    needed.[192]\r\n\r\nThe attempt was not successful. The lumber industry was destined to\r\nbe one of the most fertile fields for the propaganda of the I. W. W.\r\nand to be one of its most solidly established divisions. This disloyal\r\nagitation on the outside in 1906 was a comparatively insignificant\r\nmovement. It merely deprived the organization of a few individual\r\nmembers, and delayed somewhat the I. W. W. invasion of the lumber\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe most serious defections occurred in the Metals and Machinery, and\r\nthe Mining Departments. The former department at the outset comprised\r\ntwo groups of metal workers: the United Metal Workers International\r\nUnion and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. The United Metal\r\nWorkers had been a part of the American Federation of Labor until\r\nshortly before the first I. W. W. convention, and was on its\r\nadjournment installed as a part of the Metals and Machinery Department\r\nof the I. W. W. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers had also been a\r\npart of the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\n    On account of the somewhat industrial structure of that\r\n    organization, as different kinds of workers in the metal\r\n    industry comprised its membership, said society had been\r\n    suspended ... from the American Federation of Labor, but by\r\n    a referendum vote of the members living in the United States\r\n    and Canada it was decided to become an integral part of the\r\n    American Labor Union....[193]\r\n\r\nOn the merging of the American Labor Union in the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World, the Metal Workers of that union organized in the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers were naturally installed with the United Metal\r\nWorkers in the Metals and Machinery Department. Mutual hostility and\r\nfriction between these two groups thus arbitrarily forced into one\r\ndepartment, added to a deplorable lack of coöperation and assistance\r\nfrom the General Headquarters, finally resulted in the breaking away of\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and the consequent loss to the\r\nI. W. W. of about four thousand wage-earners in this one department\r\nduring the first year of its existence. This left the Metals and\r\nMachinery Department, about three thousand strong, practically limited\r\nin membership to the United Metal Workers International Union.[194]\r\n\r\nThe most paralyzing blow of all came with the loss of the whole of the\r\nMining Department in the defection of the Western Federation of Miners\r\nin 1907. Indeed, the Federation really ceased to be an active member of\r\nthe I. W. W. after the second convention of the latter organization in\r\nSeptember, 1906. The W. F. of M. defection was so intimately connected\r\nwith other dark troubles which came to light at the second convention\r\nthat the subject will best be treated in that connection.[195]\r\n\r\nThe strikes conducted by the Industrial Workers of the World during\r\nthe first fifteen months of its existence were almost uniformly\r\nunsuccessful. Its strike activities were, however, quite widespread\r\nand pushed in most cases with energy and enthusiasm. The following\r\ngroups of workers were involved: the Stogie Workers of Cleveland, Ohio;\r\nHotel and Restaurant Workers of Goldfield, Nevada; the Window Washers\r\nof Chicago; the Marble Workers of Cincinnati; the Miners of Tonopah\r\nand Goldfield, Nev.; the Silk Workers of Trenton (N. J.) and Staten\r\nIsland (N. Y.); and the Saw Mill and Lumber Workers of Lake Charles,\r\nLouisiana. The Stogie Workers were on strike from January 1 to October\r\n1, 1906. They demanded a ten per cent wage increase, abolition of the\r\nblack list, and one apprentice to every ten employees.[196] Although\r\nthe strikers were unable to get the aid they needed from the General\r\nOrganization, the strike seems to have been quite successful.[197]\r\n\r\nIn Goldfield, Nevada, strikes were conducted by two different locals.\r\nThe demand of the Hotel and Restaurant Workers for the eight-hour day\r\nwas finally acceded to. The Miners were on Strike both in Goldfield\r\nand Tonopah. They were bitterly opposed by the Allied Printing Trades\r\nCouncil of the American Federation of Labor, and seem not to have\r\nreached a settlement until late in 1907.\r\n\r\nThe Window Washers' strike in Chicago began August 1, 1906, and was on\r\nat the time of the second convention. Members of the Window Washers'\r\nUnion quit work in thirty-five buildings in the down-town district of\r\nChicago. The General Executive Board advised that the striking men be\r\nkept at work in other occupations so far as possible in order to keep\r\ndown expenses. The Marble Workers of Cincinnati demanded a nine-hour\r\nday and a Saturday half-holiday. There appears to be no record of the\r\nresult of their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe strikes of the Silk Workers at Trenton, N. J., and\r\n\r\nStaten Island, N. Y., were both lost, the cause assigned by the\r\nstrikers for their defeat being the fact that they could get no support\r\nfrom the General Organization.[198]\r\n\r\nThere was a disproportionate amount of energy given to strikes at this\r\ntime. Moreover, most of this energy was misdirected. President Sherman,\r\nin his report to the convention, said: \"There has been no time since\r\nAugust, 1905, but what we have had one or more strikes to contend with,\r\nwhich has been more or less responsible for our organization not being\r\nin a position to place more organizers in the field than what it has\r\nmaintained.\"[199]\r\n\r\nIn discussing the I. W. W. strike record, Secretary Trautmann declared\r\nthat \"there was not a single solitary strike that the I. W. W. won.\"\r\nThey were not rightly conducted, nor called at the right time.\r\n\r\n    Those organizations [he explained] formed in the last year on\r\n    a strict observance of the laws and principles of the I. W. W.\r\n    did not have a strike while those organizations organized on\r\n    the craft union principle of immediate gains without voluntary\r\n    coöperation of the membership, those organizations were the\r\n    only ones that were plunged into a fight immediately after we\r\n    were organized.[200]\r\n\r\nThere was certainly little or no coöperative planning of strikes,\r\nespecially no careful timing of them, between the local unions and\r\nthe general administration. Often during the first year \"strikes were\r\ncalled in times when the general organization was least prepared, and\r\nwhen it required strenuous efforts to meet the requirements of such a\r\nconflict with the employers.\"[201]\r\n\r\nPresident Sherman believed that the strike activities had been too\r\nexclusively confined to the eastern states, and even suggested that it\r\nmight be better for the time being to conduct strikes only in the West.\r\nHe explained his position as follows:\r\n\r\n    Nearly all the strikes which have taken place during the life\r\n    of the organization have been in the eastern States. The\r\n    workers at those points, being so poorly paid, it has been\r\n    necessary for them to immediately appeal for benefits, which\r\n    demonstrates the fact that we must prepare for war before\r\n    war is declared. Many of our strikes ... have taken place\r\n    immediately after the local union was organized, before the\r\n    members involved in such strikes were hardened and drilled in\r\n    the principles of industrial unionism.... One local union in\r\n    the East ... becomes a greater responsibility to the general\r\n    organization than three local unions in the West.[202]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the industrial unionists were pushing their\r\nstrike propaganda some of them who were also members of the radical\r\npolitical parties were trying to bring those parties (_viz._, the\r\nSocialist party and the Socialist Labor party) together. To do this\r\nthey realized that the two parties must agree upon a policy in regard\r\nto the attitude which the party should assume toward the trade unions.\r\nWith this object in view representatives of the two socialist parties\r\ncalled a conference which was afterwards known as the New Jersey\r\nSocialist Unity Conference. The sessions of this conference were held\r\nin various New Jersey towns--Orange, Paterson, West Hoboken, Newark--at\r\nirregular times between September 10, 1905, and March 4, 1906. The\r\npurpose of the conference, as expressed in the Manifesto issued at the\r\nclose of its sessions, was \"to consider the causes of the division\r\nbetween the two [socialist] camps and ascertain, if possible, whether\r\nsolid grounds could be found for a union of the militant socialist\r\nforces ... of the State....\"[203]\r\n\r\nThe conference believed that any union between the revolutionary groups\r\nin America depended upon a proper solution of two problems: \"First, the\r\nproper attitude for a political party of socialism to assume toward the\r\nburning question of trades unionism; and second, the proper attitude\r\nfor a political party of socialism to assume toward the ownership of\r\nits press, the voice of the movement.\"[204]\r\n\r\nThe first of these two problems took up the greater part of the\r\nattention of the conference, and it is the only one which was of\r\nspecial import in the development of industrial unionism. The very\r\nfact of such a conference indicates that there was at least that\r\nharmony between the two camps which was necessary to enable them to\r\nget together to discuss differences. Members of both parties, too,\r\nbelieved that a harmony platform was actually in process of successful\r\napplication, so far as the economic or labor-union policy of both\r\nparties was concerned. For--behold the I. W. W.! \"Such a conference,\"\r\nsaid the secretary of the State Executive Committee of the Socialist\r\nLabor party, \"taking place at a time when the hitherto divided\r\nsocialists are approaching one another and joining hands on the basis\r\nof the Industrial Workers of the World--such a conference we feel\r\nconfident, at least feel hopeful, will promote the desired end of\r\nsocialist unity.\"[205]\r\n\r\nShall the political party, the radical political party, be neutral in\r\nits attitude towards the economic organization of the working class?\r\nThis was the real question at issue. The prevailing sentiment at this\r\nconference was in the negative.\r\n\r\n    A socialist political movement [declared one delegate] cannot\r\n    be neutral with regard to economic movements. The Socialist\r\n    party itself, on the speakers' banners, says to the workers,\r\n    \"Join the union of your craft. Join the party of your class.\"\r\n    Evolution forced the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the\r\n    class conscious, economic organization of labor. It was not a\r\n    mistake. It organized with 25,000 men and today we have the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World with 100,000 men, organized on\r\n    class conscious lines. If it was a mistake, it was the kind of\r\n    a mistake that helps. Neutrality is nonsense.[206]\r\n\r\nSome of the delegates were more hesitant about such a proposition as\r\nthe unqualified endorsement of the I. W. W. One of the Socialist party\r\nrepresentatives expressed his opposition to such support in these words:\r\n\r\n    The I. W. W. may be good enough now [he said] but it may drift,\r\n    may become bad. Should the Socialist movement base itself on\r\n    the I. W. W. and that organization fall, the party would fall\r\n    with it. I am opposed to recognizing that organization until\r\n    it has proved itself to be of use. In Colorado the Western\r\n    Federation of Miners adopted declarations similar to those of\r\n    the I. W. W., endorsed the Socialist party, then went to the\r\n    polls, not to cast their ballot for the Socialist candidate,\r\n    but for a reactionary Democrat. We have nothing definite to\r\n    show that the I. W. W. would not do the same thing.[207]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. _has_ changed--shifted very decidedly--and in that the\r\ndelegate proved himself something of a prophet, but its new position\r\nis anything but that of a reactionary labor organization voting for a\r\nDemocratic--or Republican--candidate!\r\n\r\nThe majority were emphatically for a recognition of the principle of\r\nindustrial unionism, but there was some difference of opinion as to\r\nwhether any particular organization should be endorsed. A number of\r\nthe conferees felt that the I. W. W. should simply be commended as\r\nuseful for working out the industrial-union idea, rather than given an\r\nunreserved endorsement. The final conclusions of the conference were\r\nembodied in a series of resolutions, and also expressed in detail in\r\nthe Manifesto already referred to. The resolutions pertaining to the\r\nquestion of political-economic relations were as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. Resolved, that the Socialist political movement of the\r\n    working class cannot remain neutral to the organized effort\r\n    of the working class to better their economic conditions on\r\n    class-conscious, revolutionary lines.\r\n\r\n    II. Resolved, that the A. F. of L. form of organization and its\r\n    principles are an obstacle to working class emancipation.\r\n\r\n    III. Resolved, that the Conference places itself on record as\r\n    recognizing the usefulness of the Industrial Workers of the\r\n    World to the proletarian movement....\r\n\r\n    X. Resolved, ... that ... steps be taken to bring about a\r\n    national conference between the two organizations in order to\r\n    bring about unity on a national basis.[208]\r\n\r\n    The Conference holds [reads this Manifesto] that without the\r\n    political movement backed by a class-conscious ... economic\r\n    organization, ready to take and hold and conduct the productive\r\n    power of the land, and thereby ready ... to enforce if ...\r\n    and when need be, the fiat of the socialist ballot of the\r\n    working class; that without such a body in existence, the\r\n    socialist political movement will be but a flash in the pan\r\n    ...; that a political party of Socialism which marches to\r\n    the polls unarmed by such [an] organization, but invites a\r\n    catastrophe over the land in the measure that it strains for\r\n    [and achieves] political success.... It must be an obvious\r\n    fact to all serious observers of the times, that the day of\r\n    the political success of such a party in America would be the\r\n    day of its defeat, immediately followed by an industrial and\r\n    financial crisis, from which none would suffer more than the\r\n    working class itself.... By its own declarations and acts the\r\n    American Federation of Labor shows that it accepts wage-slavery\r\n    as a finality ... holding that there is identity of interest\r\n    between employer and employee.... Consequently [the Conference]\r\n    ... rejects as impracticable, vicious, and productive only of\r\n    corruption the theory of neutrality on the economic field ...,\r\n    condemns the American Federation of Labor as an obstacle to\r\n    the emancipation of the working class ... [and] commends as\r\n    useful to the emancipation of the working class the Industrial\r\n    Workers of the World, which instead of running away from the\r\n    class struggle bases itself squarely upon it, and boldly and\r\n    correctly sets out the socialist principle \"that the working\r\n    class and the employing class have nothing in common....\"[209]\r\n\r\nThe second I. W. W. convention met on September 17, 1906, with\r\nninety-three delegates. The sessions continued for sixteen days. It\r\nhad been predicted at the first convention that the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World would within a year be one hundred thousand strong. This\r\nforecast was, according to Secretary Trautmann's report to the second\r\nconvention, very much too sanguine. This report indicated that there\r\nwere some sixty thousand members (including 27,000 in the Western\r\nFederation of Miners) at the opening of the second convention. The\r\nfollowing tabulation of the growth of the membership during the first\r\nyear is arranged from the data given in Mr. Trautmann's report:\r\n\r\n              I. W. W.

Mr. St.\r\nJohn, until recently Secretary-Treasurer of the organization, wrote\r\n\"that the Second Annual Convention reports claim 60,000 members, but\r\nthe books of the organization did not justify any such claims; in fact,\r\nthe average _paid-up_ membership _with the W. F. of M._ for the first\r\nyear of the organization was 14,000 members in round numbers.\"[212]\r\n\r\nAs has already been intimated, the Mining Department was from the first\r\nnot very securely held in the bonds of the general organization, and\r\nit is very doubtful whether the 27,000 miners should be included in I.\r\nW. W. membership estimates even during the period while the Western\r\nFederation was nominally a department of the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld. According to Secretary Trautmann, it was evident \"on August\r\n1, 1905, that those brave men of the American Labor Union, numbered\r\nthen 1,100, and approximately 700 in the Metal Department, [and] could\r\nnot be swayed by the denunciation of the opposition in the West,\r\nthose under cover as friends, often more dangerous than those openly\r\nfighting the I. W. W.\" \"These 1900 [1800],\" continued Mr. Trautmann,\r\n\"constituted the only force with which the constructive work was\r\nbegun.\"[213]\r\n\r\nPresident Sherman reported that on September 10, 1906, the locals\r\nholding charters in the Industrial Workers of the World numbered\r\n394, of which number 120 were not at that time in good standing,\r\nso that there were at the time of the second convention 274 active\r\nlocals enrolled.[214] The greater part of this number consisted of\r\nlocal unions directly attached to the general organization without\r\nany intervening subordinate division or subdivision. A considerable\r\nminority of the total, however, comprised local unions which were only\r\nindirectly attached to the general organization, such locals being\r\nenrolled in District Councils or National Industrial Unions, or even\r\nIndustrial Departments and being directly responsible to that council,\r\nnational union, or department.\r\n\r\nThere were but three departments actually organized as such during\r\nthe first twelve months. These were the Transportation Department,\r\nthe Metals and Machinery Department, and the Mining Department. The\r\nMining Department was the only one of the three having the members\r\nnecessary to justify existence as a separate autonomous department,\r\nand it was finally the only department recognized as such at the\r\nsecond convention. The Western Federation of Miners was thus the I. W,\r\nW.'s only genuine department--and a department, moreover, which was\r\nagitating _sub rosa_ all the while against the general organization of\r\nwhich it was even a nominal department for but a few months.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Transportation Department, Secretary Trautmann reported\r\nto the convention that, \"the United Brotherhood of Railway\r\nEmployees ... installed itself as the Transportation Department of\r\nthe I. W. W., it being accepted as a fact that said Brotherhood was\r\nan integral part of the American Labor Union and had at the time of\r\ninstallment 2,087 members....\"\r\n\r\n    ... this so-called department [he said] proved to be a constant\r\n    drain on the general treasury.... While the Transportation\r\n    Department has paid in taxes to the Industrial Workers of the\r\n    World the sum of $130.75, the main organization was constantly\r\n    paying more into that department in the vain hope that\r\n    eventually the workers in that industry would rally around the\r\n    banner of industrial unionism....[215]\r\n\r\nAlthough the convention decided not to recognize the Transportation\r\nDepartment, it did endorse a resolution providing \"that the\r\ncredentials of all local unions of transportation workers who are\r\nsending delegates, be recognized and the delegates seated.\"[216] The\r\nbreak-up of the Metal and Machinery Department and the bolting of that\r\n(chief) subdivision of it which was formerly and now again became the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers has been referred to above.[217] The\r\nconvention took the same action in regard to this as in the case of\r\nthe Transportation Department, denying recognition to the Department\r\nbut granting it to those local unions (the United Metal Workers Union\r\nin this case) which had sent delegates to the convention.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed that seven international unions voluntarily joined\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World, \"even though they were forced\r\nby the power of the capitalist combinations to remain ... attached\r\nto the American Federation of Labor.\"[218] The seven \"international\"\r\nindustrial unions are nowhere specifically mentioned but must\r\npresumably have included unions belonging to the three departments\r\nmentioned above and which were organized during the first year. The\r\nInternational Musical Union was one of these so-called international\r\nunions. This organization was not even satisfied to be an international\r\nindustrial union--it insisted on being a Department as well--and\r\nclaimed the title of\r\n\r\n    the International Musical and Theatrical Union, Subdivision\r\n    of the Public Service Department of the Industrial Workers of\r\n    the World ... [all this] on the grounds ... that organizations\r\n    comprising 1000 and even less members were allowed autonomous\r\n    department administration and department executive boards; and\r\n    so that organization has since been using the prestige of the\r\n    I. W. W. to justify its existence as a part of a department not\r\n    at all organized.[219]\r\n\r\nThere is not now and never has been a genuine, that is to say a\r\nconstitutional, Public Service Department in the I. W. W., and of\r\ncourse the convention could not recognize a mere fragment of what might\r\nsome day become a Public Service Department.\r\n\r\nSince 1906 there have been no Industrial Departments (_i. e._, no\r\ndivisions larger in scope than the National Industrial Union) in the\r\nI. W. W. Nevertheless, the Constitution continued, up to the tenth\r\nconvention in 1916, to speak of the organization as being composed\r\nof National Industrial Departments, National Industrial Unions,\r\n_etc._[220] The Agricultural Workers' Organization (the \"A. W. O.\"),\r\norganized in 1914, which now constitutes a large and increasingly\r\nimportant division of the I. W. W., is akin to what the founders wanted\r\nto have in the I. W. W. in 1905. There is more _body_ to it today than\r\nthere was to any of the so-called International Industrial Departments\r\nof the earlier period. It is to be noted that in all the editions of\r\nthe Constitution since 1906 the word \"International\" has been replaced\r\nwherever it occurred by the word \"National.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of its history the Industrial Workers of the World\r\nhas been composed almost entirely of local unions scattered throughout\r\nthe United States and Canada, all directly connected with the central\r\noffice or what is called the General Organization. The development\r\nof subdivisions (such as Industrial District Councils, International\r\nIndustrial Unions, and Industrial Departments), between the general\r\norganization and the local union has not been appreciable until within\r\nthe last two or three years.[221]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[180] \"The World of Labor,\" _International Socialist Review_, vol. vi,\r\npp. 434-5 (Jan., 1906).\r\n\r\n[181] The Red Lodge, Mont., and Pittsburg, Kans., locals.\r\n\r\n[182] _Proceedings, Second I.

At this time the friction\r\nseemed to be chiefly personal, whereas the second schism in 1908 was\r\nprimarily due to differences in regard to principles and policies.\r\nIt is true that principles and policies were involved in the feud of\r\n1906, but they lurked obscurely in the background, while personal\r\nantagonisms--charges and counter-charges of graft, corruption and\r\nmalfeasance in office--held the center of the stage. From the inception\r\nof the movement the year before a smouldering dissension developed\r\nbetween the poorer and less skilled groups of workers--largely\r\nmigratory and casual laborers, the \"revolutionists\" or the \"wage-slave\r\ndelegates\" as they were called in the second convention--these on\r\nthe one side, and the more highly skilled and strongly organized\r\ngroups called (by the other side) the \"reactionaries\" or the\r\n\"political fakirs.\" It might be remarked in passing that, in\r\nthis ultra-revolutionary I. W. W., the \"conservatism\" of the\r\n\"reactionaries\" ought to be heavily discounted and the radicalism\r\nof the \"revolutionists\" raised to the _n_th degree to get the true\r\nperspective! Involved with this group hostility was the trouble stirred\r\nup by various members of the two Socialist political parties.\r\n\r\n    The first years [writes Mr. St. John] was one of internal\r\n    struggle for control by these different elements. The two\r\n    camps of socialist politicians looked upon the I. W. W. only as\r\n    a battle-ground on which to settle their respective merits and\r\n    demerits. The labor fakirs strove to fasten themselves upon the\r\n    organization that they might continue to exist if the new union\r\n    was a success.[222]\r\n\r\nBut all this internal antagonism was very obscure. It evidenced itself\r\nchiefly in the personal fight between the Sherman-Hanneman-Kirkpatrick\r\nfaction and the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction at the second\r\nconvention, which finally resulted in the deposition of C. O. Sherman\r\nas General President. Mr. St. John has described the situation as it\r\nappeared from his side of the controversy. At the second convention it\r\nsoon developed, he says,\r\n\r\n    that the administration of the I. W. W. was in the hands of\r\n    men who were not in accord with the revolutionary program\r\n    of the organization. Of the general officers only two were\r\n    sincere--the General Secretary, W. E. Trautmann, and one\r\n    member of the Executive Board, John Riordan. The struggle for\r\n    control of the organization formed the second convention into\r\n    two camps. The majority vote of the convention was in the\r\n    revolutionary camp. The reactionary camp, having the chairman,\r\n    used obstructive tactics in their effort to gain control of the\r\n    convention. They hoped thereby to delay the convention until\r\n    enough delegates would be forced to return home and thus change\r\n    the control of the convention. The revolutionists cut this knot\r\n    by abolishing the office of president and electing a chairman\r\n    from among the revolutionists.[223]\r\n\r\nThe revolutionists, who were referred to later by their opponents\r\nas the \"proletarian rabble\" of the \"beggars,\" held a pre-convention\r\nconference in Chicago on August 14, 1906. This little \"curtain-raiser\"\r\nwas called by Local Union No. 23 of the Department of Metal and\r\nMachinery which on July 20 sent out a letter to the various I. W.\r\nW. locals in Chicago, which declared that \"developments during the\r\npast year have proven to us that the constitution does not come up to\r\nthe requirements of the rank and file ...,\" and urged a preliminary\r\nconference to consider the following propositions:\r\n\r\n    First. Is a president necessary in our form of organization?\r\n\r\n    Second. Shall this organization be the expression of the\r\n    membership?\r\n\r\n    Third. Who shall direct the organization work?\r\n\r\n    Fourth. Shall the local unions receive a copy of the minutes of\r\n    the General Executive Board sessions?\r\n\r\n    Fifth. Shall the local unions be represented at the National\r\n    Convention, as set forth in Article VI., General Constitution?\r\n\r\n    Sixth. Any other question that the Conference may deem\r\n    necessary to discuss.[224]\r\n\r\nThe conference met with delegates present from about sixteen local\r\nunions and unanimously decided that a president was unnecessary, that\r\nall organizers, lecturers, etc., should be nominated by the local\r\nunions and elected by the \"rank and file,\" that each local should\r\nreceive reports of all Executive Board sessions, which, moreover,\r\nshould be open to the rank and file, and that every local union be\r\nrepresented at the approaching convention by at least two delegates.\r\n\r\n    Whereas, the day is at hand [runs their resolution] when\r\n    we must abolish anything that pertains to aristocratic\r\n    power or reactionary policy, the office of president of a\r\n    class-conscious organization is not necessary. The rank and\r\n    file must conduct the affairs of the organization directly\r\n    through an executive board or central committee ... and,\r\n    whereas a president can only be in one place at one time and\r\n    can only personally organize the working class in the district\r\n    in which he is; he, therefore, can only act in the capacity\r\n    of an organizer.... [Moreover], the expense of a president\r\n    [$150 per month] would support at least four class-conscious\r\n    organizers....[225]\r\n\r\nCommenting on the conference, J. M. O'Neill remarks that \"there\r\nis a vast difference between being class-conscious and being\r\nclass-crazy.\"[226]\r\n\r\nAn inkling of the beautifully chaotic condition of affairs no later\r\nthan December, 1905, is given by the comments of Max Hayes in the\r\n_International Socialist Review_ for January, 1906.\r\n\r\n    I am told by a prominent member of the I. W. W. [he says] that\r\n    not all is lovely in that organization, that the original\r\n    industrialists and the departmentalists are lining up to give\r\n    battle, and that in some places where the DeLeonites and\r\n    the Anarchists had combined and held control the Socialists\r\n    obtained possession of the machinery.... \"If a convention were\r\n    held next month,\" an industrialist writes, \"the element in\r\n    control in Chicago last July wouldn't be one, two, three, and\r\n    I predict that at the next convention the academic vagaries\r\n    forced upon us by the DeLeon-Anarchist combine will be dropped\r\n    for a plain fighting program that everybody can understand and\r\n    conjure with.\" Rumors are in the air that the Western Miners\r\n    and President Sherman and his friends are souring on DeLeon and\r\n    Secretary Trautmann and his followers.[227]\r\n\r\nThe principal charge against President Sherman was that of misdirected\r\nand generally extravagant expenditure of the funds of the organization.\r\nThe auditing committee at the 1906 convention reported that \"the\r\nexpenditures of the ex-General President show gross extravagance and\r\nstrong evidence of corruption. During a period of thirty-three days he\r\nflung away on a junketing trip, not a single local being organized by\r\nhim at any time, the sum of $731.55....\"[228] William. E. Trautmann,\r\nthe General Secretary-Treasurer, reported that he was \"compelled to pay\r\nbills under protest for services never rendered, or for such things\r\nas should be considered an insult and outrage against the entire\r\nmembership.\"[229]\r\n\r\nThe opponents of Sherman did not believe that these alleged offenses\r\nwere either the most important or the most dangerous of his pernicious\r\nactivities. When the case finally came before the Master in Chancery,\r\nthere was among the affidavits filed in the case of St. John _versus_\r\nSherman one by a certain Lillian Farberg,\r\n\r\n    who swears that Sherman ... told her that a conference had been\r\n    held at Denver, which was attended by himself (Sherman), James\r\n    Kirwan, J. M. O'Neill, and Victor Berger (of Milwaukee). At\r\n    this conference Sherman said an understanding had been reached\r\n    that the Western Federation of Miners should endorse the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World, that later at the convention\r\n    of the I. W. W. such action would be taken as would result\r\n    in the radical element [the \"tramps\" and \"beggars\"] being\r\n    thrown out of the organization, and that Victor Berger at the\r\n    conference had promised that if this was done the Socialist\r\n    party would endorse the I. W. W.[230]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing charges were flatly denied by J. M. O'Neill, the editor\r\nof the _Miners' Magazine_; at the fifteenth convention of the W. F. M.,\r\nhe repudiated these and other accusations made by the \"DeLeon coterie\"\r\nand offered $500 reward for the establishment of the truth of any of\r\nthem.[231] Delegate Parks, one of the \"wage slave\" delegates, declared\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    ... it is the general opinion of the members of the\r\n    revolutionary element of this convention that there was among\r\n    some of the departments of the Industrial Workers of the World\r\n    corruption, graft, and fakiration which would put to shame the\r\n    worst of the American Federation of Labor.[232]\r\n\r\nImmediately on the adjournment of the 1907 convention, ex-President\r\nSherman issued a statement \"to officers and members of all local\r\nunions and all departments of the Industrial Workers of the World\"\r\nin which he declared, \"that the recent convention ... violated the\r\nconstitution in various ways\"; \"that the convention was controlled by\r\nthe members of the Socialist Labor Party under the leadership of Daniel\r\nDeLeon,\" and that this \"most disgraceful gathering\" was \"illegal and\r\nunconstitutional.\"[233] A month later Sherman issued on his own behalf\r\na letter to the I. W. W. membership, in which he denied the various\r\ncharges of extravagance and connivance at illegal tactics on his part.\r\nIn this letter Sherman says that \"not a vote was cast on any important\r\nmatter in this so-called convention until DeLeon had been consulted, or\r\nhe had given them the 'wise business wink.'\"[234]\r\n\r\nAs far as parliamentary convention tactics are concerned there is\r\nno doubt that both factions displayed a lofty contempt for parlor\r\netiquette. Several months later William D. Haywood wrote to St. John\r\nin regard to this matter. He emphatically condemned \"Shermanism,\" but\r\ngoes on: \"You were entirely too harsh, unnecessarily so; the Gordian,\r\npresidential and other knots that you cut with a broad axe were only\r\nslip knots that could have been easily untied.\" \"In this way,\" he\r\nconcludes, \"much dissension could have been avoided.\"[235] An anarchist\r\nsympathizer with the \"proletarian rabble\" frankly writes: \"Some might\r\nclaim that the action of the convention of 1906 was illegal ... [but]\r\nin a crisis there is no question of legality. It is the time for\r\ndeeds....\"[236]\r\n\r\nSeven days had elapsed since the opening of the convention before the\r\nreports of officers were given. During this time--nearly half the time\r\nthe convention was in session--almost nothing was accomplished. This\r\ndelay made very plausible indeed the accusation made by the \"wage\r\nslave\" delegates that the reactionaries had deliberately planned to\r\nforce them out of the convention by resort to these dilatory tactics.\r\nWhether or not the Sherman faction had decided on such tactics, there\r\nis no question but that the freezing out of the \"wage slaves\" would be\r\na very natural result. Article VI. of the Constitution provided that\r\n\"the expenses of delegates attending the convention shall be borne by\r\ntheir respective organizations.\" Now many of the local unions could\r\nafford to provide their delegates with adequate expense money; others\r\ncould afford but very inadequate provision for expenses. Thus, most\r\nof the delegates from unions in the Mining Department--and those in\r\ngeneral from the relatively better established unions--were quite\r\nwell provided for, the Miners' delegates, _e. g._, receiving mileage\r\nplus five dollars per day expense money for every day they were away\r\nfrom home. The great majority, however, were paid nothing but mileage\r\nand were obliged to pay their own expenses and had come with funds\r\nabsolutely insufficient for a prolonged meeting. Delegate Lingenfelter,\r\nin a speech in support of an unsuccessful motion to allow proxies to\r\ndelegates who were compelled to leave on account of lack of funds, said:\r\n\r\n    These dilatory tactics that have been pursued by the\r\n    opposition have prolonged the convention, due to their express\r\n    determination, in my opinion, to freeze out these wage slave\r\n    delegates.... Only last night the boys came to me and said: ...\r\n    \"We can't stand it any longer; we are going broke; we can't\r\n    sleep in boxcars and eat handouts and remain here.\"[237]\r\n\r\nThe \"beggars\" gained the upper hand. Mr. DeLeon succeeded in putting\r\nthrough a motion to suspend the above mentioned article of the\r\nConstitution concerning delegates' expenses, and a resolution was\r\nfinally passed which authorized the payment of $1.50 per day from the\r\ngeneral treasury to all without the necessary expense money.[238]\r\n\r\nIn this way the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction secured control\r\nof the convention and brought about the deposition of President\r\nSherman--the first and last President of the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld. The convention now proceeded to consider some of the problems\r\nof industrial unionism which had cropped out in the course of twelve\r\nmonths' experience. Meanwhile ex-President Sherman and his followers\r\nhad decided to stand pat--but not on the floor of the convention. They\r\ntook possession of the General Headquarters and with the assistance of\r\nthe police successfully held them against all comers.\r\n\r\n    Upon entering the premises of the General Headquarters the\r\n    members of the General Executive Board [newly elected] were\r\n    prevented from entering by thugs engaged by members of the old\r\n    General Executive Board and two members [of the new board],\r\n    Vincent St. John and Fred Heslewood, were attacked by these\r\n    sluggers.[239]\r\n\r\nThis picturesque situation is explained to the membership in an\r\nofficial announcement issued by the new Executive Board in behalf of\r\nthe \"proletarian rabble\":\r\n\r\n    Sherman and his hired sluggers are now in forcible possession\r\n    of the general office and all the books, records, papers,\r\n    roster of local unions, mailing list and other property of the\r\n    organization, necessitating legal procedure on our part to oust\r\n    them and regain control of the office and property.... The\r\n    majority of the General Executive Board was his perfect tool.\r\n    They winked at his irregularities, endorsed his extravagance\r\n    and lent their efforts to perpetuate him in this organization\r\n    as they are now lending their assistance to help him disrupt\r\n    it.[240]\r\n\r\nThe success of the \"beggars, tramps, and proletarian rabble,\" that is\r\nto say, of the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction, was hardly complete.\r\nThey were officials without an office in which to do business, without\r\nequipment of any sort, and without money. Secretary St. John writes\r\nthat they \"were obliged to begin work after the second Convention\r\nwithout the equipment of so much as a postage stamp.\" The financial\r\nroutine in the general office had required the signature of the\r\npresident on all checks and prohibited the withdrawal of funds from\r\nthe bank without that signature. Now the President was deposed, the\r\noffice abolished, and the deposed President refused to sign the\r\nnecessary requisitions so that the four thousand dollars belonging to\r\nthe I. W. W. in the Prairie State Bank of Chicago was safely out of\r\nreach of both factions.[241]\r\n\r\nThe matter was at last taken to the Court of Chancery and a restraining\r\norder issued prohibiting Sherman and his friends from appropriating the\r\nproperty of the Industrial Workers of the World. The findings of the\r\nMaster in Chancery were in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. That the Industrial Workers of the World is a voluntary\r\n    association consisting of about 62,000 members residing in\r\n    various cities and villages throughout the United States and\r\n    Canada.\r\n\r\n    2. That its 1906 convention was legal and valid.\r\n\r\n    3. That the acts of Mr. C. O. Sherman after that convention\r\n    were illegal, and,\r\n\r\n    4. That the \"attempted abolition\" of the office of General\r\n    President was illegal and void.[242]\r\n\r\nThe findings were on the whole favorable to the \"wage slaves\" faction,\r\nbut even so the latter were in a rather forlorn position now, having\r\nbeen abandoned to their fate by the Western Federation of Miners (whose\r\ndelegates supported Sherman, some of them bolting the convention\r\nbefore its adjournment), and by the Socialist party. Before long the\r\nWestern Federation finally withdrew its support from the Sherman\r\nfaction and early in the year 1907 the \"would-be usurpers\" gave up\r\nthe struggle,[243] but the Western Federation of Miners did not come\r\nback into the fold. They decided to withhold payment of dues to either\r\nfaction pending their anticipated and formally realized secession at\r\ntheir convention in May, 1907.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman had made a desperate fight. He and his followers conducted\r\nwhat was virtually a duplicate even if spurious general office and\r\norganization of the I. W. W. The Shermanites, who had retained control\r\nof the \"_Industrial Worker_,\"[244] the journal of the organization,\r\ncontinued its publication for several months at Joliet, Illinois.\r\nHerein were published refutations of the charges set forth by the\r\n\"DeLeon-Anarchist Combine\" in their special series of _Bulletins of the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World_. With the surrender of the Shermanites\r\nthe \"Industrial Worker\" was discontinued, and the Trautmann-DeLeon-St.\r\nJohn faction--now _the_ I. W. W.--established the _Industrial Union\r\nBulletin_ as a weekly organ.\r\n\r\nThe now triumphant revolutionists considered that the whole\r\ntrouble was due to an attempt to sell out to the capitalists, to\r\nmake the organization a conservative--and therefore a perfectly\r\nharmless--association. Mr. Trautmann insisted that their \"sole\r\nobject when forcibly taking possession of headquarters and all their\r\ndocuments\" was to destroy all evidence of their plots for\r\n\r\n    surrendering the Industrial Workers of the World to the\r\n    employing class and their agents. The stenographic report of\r\n    the second convention will prove the falsity of every charge\r\n    made against the \"tramps\" and \"beggars\" who saved the I. W. W.\r\n    to continue its work as the revolutionary economic organization\r\n    of the working class of America.[245]\r\n\r\n\"The danger was great,\" declared Daniel DeLeon in his speech at the\r\nadjournment of the 1906 convention. \"The conspiracy was deep laid. We\r\nsee it appearing in the papers from Denver all the way across to New\r\nYork. It was a conspiracy to squelch the revolution in this convention,\r\nand to start over again another American Federation of Labor.\"[246]\r\n\r\nDeLeon's sentiments regarding the schism of 1906 are particularly\r\nworthy of note, because of the fact that he was destined two years\r\nlater to figure with seceders in a split of that same \"DeLeon-Anarchist\r\nCombine\" which was now victorious and of one mind in overthrowing\r\n\"usurpers\" and apparently in harmony in every way. But in two years the\r\n\"DeLeon-Anarchist Combine\" was to change to the DeLeonites _versus_\r\nthe Anarchists, each of whom was to constitute a separate organization\r\ncalled the Industrial Workers of the World.\r\n\r\nSocialist party leaders were as firmly convinced as was DeLeon that\r\nthere was a \"deep-laid conspiracy,\" but they believed that _DeLeon_\r\nwas the arch conspirator. When the Seventh International Socialist\r\nCongress met in Stuttgart in 1907, Morris Hillquit and J. Mahlon Barnes\r\npresented the Socialist version of the affair.[247] The fatal trouble\r\nfrom the very beginning, they thought, was the inclusion in the I. W.\r\nW. of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the \"_enfant chétif_\" (as\r\nthey expressed it) of the Socialist Labor party.[248] They go on to\r\ntell how this alleged conspirator prepared the ground for the \"capture\"\r\nof the convention in the interest of this \"_enfant chétif_\":\r\n\r\n    Several months before the 2nd Convention, the Alliance, under\r\n    the direction of the adroit chief of the Socialist Labor party,\r\n    Daniel DeLeon, planned to take possession of the administration\r\n    of the I. W. W., and by means of a skillful manipulation of\r\n    the delegates, succeeded in obtaining a majority for itself\r\n    in the convention. The Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance,\r\n    indeed, dominated the convention. It completely modified the\r\n    constitution of the organization, abolished the office of\r\n    General President, and chose a new Executive Board from among\r\n    its friends and adherents. But the triumph of the Alliance did\r\n    not last. In conformity with the constitution of the I. W. W.,\r\n    the acts of the convention are not valid unless ratified by\r\n    a referendum of the members.... The leaders of the Alliance\r\n    refused to submit the acts of the convention to a vote of the\r\n    members, and the old officials immediately declared them null\r\n    and void. The division was therefore complete in the ranks\r\n    of the I. W. W. The two factions maintained rival bodies of\r\n    officials and the dispute was carried to the courts, which\r\n    pronounced in favor of the old administration [Sherman, _et\r\n    al._]. The great majority of the members supported the original\r\n    organization directed by Mr. Sherman in the capacity of\r\n    President, while the number of adherents to the DeLeon faction\r\n    did not exceed 2000 members.[249]\r\n\r\nVincent St. John offers some interesting testimony against the\r\nallegation that DeLeonism dominated the second convention:\r\n\r\n    It is my opinion [he says] that they [the Shermanites] are,\r\n    because of lack of argument with which to sustain a wrong\r\n    position, hoping to cause the prejudice which exists against\r\n    DeLeon and the Socialist Labor party to blind many to the true\r\n    state of affairs, a prejudice to which I plead guilty to having\r\n    had, but which I was unable to justify upon investigation,\r\n    a prejudice which exists against this organization and man\r\n    because it and he stood upon the ground that we now occupy\r\n    fourteen years ago, struggling against grafters and traitors,\r\n    and for which they have paid the penalty in being slandered and\r\n    vilified. This is no eulogy of DeLeon or the S. L. P.... It is\r\n    my conclusion.[250]\r\n\r\nThese conflicting opinions are presented for what they are worth. On\r\nboth sides they should be taken with salt. The writer makes no attempt\r\nto pass judgment except to point out that the Socialist party report\r\nto the Stuttgart Congress is obviously in error in claiming that\r\nthe Master in Chancery pronounced in favor of the old (_i. e._, the\r\nSherman) administration.[251]\r\n\r\nThe \"proletarian rabble\" recognized that the power of the opposition\r\nwould be fatally undermined if it lost the active support of the\r\nWestern Federation of Miners. It has been seen that they did finally\r\nlose that support when the W. F. M. finally cut loose entirely from\r\nanything and everything calling itself I. W. W. This--the most\r\nstaggering defection of all that the young I. W. W. had to face--had\r\nbeen rather plainly foreshadowed as early as the fall of 1905. Within\r\nthree months of the adjournment of the first convention the report was\r\ncirculated among various unions in the West that the Western Federation\r\nhad refused to join the Industrial Workers of the World.[252] This\r\nrumor was without foundation. The Western Federation _did_ join the I.\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\n    Immediately after the close of the first convention\r\n    [according to Secretary Trautmann's report] the officers of\r\n    the Western Federation of Miners reported to the members of\r\n    that organization the actions of the first convention, and a\r\n    referendum was issued for the purpose of having the work of the\r\n    delegates ratified by the rank and file. At the end of August,\r\n    notice was received that the members of the Western Federation\r\n    of Miners had approved, by a big majority, the actions of\r\n    the delegates in installing that organization as an integral\r\n    part of the Industrial Workers of the World, and on September\r\n    1, 1905, the Western Federation of Miners became the Mining\r\n    Department of the Industrial Workers of the World.[253]\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be for long. Although the break did not come for\r\nsome months after the second I. W. W. convention, some premonitory\r\nevidences of disaffection came to the surface at that meeting. As will\r\nbe seen, there were several things which aggravated the trouble in the\r\nMining Department. The deposition of President Sherman by the delegates\r\nto the second convention, and the consequent confusion, especially\r\nin regard to finances, resulted in the bolting of the convention by\r\nthe delegates of the Mining Department (the Western Federation of\r\nMiners).[254] From the close of the second convention until the summer\r\nof 1907 the Western Federation was nominally a part of the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World, but was all this time becoming more and more\r\nalienated in spirit. For all practical purposes, January 1, 1907, may\r\nbe regarded as marking the termination of the Federation's connection\r\nwith the I. W. W. This whole controversy between the I. W. W. and its\r\nMining Department, _i. e._, between the \"proletarian rabble\" (the\r\nTrautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction) on the one hand, and on the other\r\nthe \"reactionaries\" (the Sherman-Hanneman faction), supported for the\r\nmost part by the Western Federation of Miners--all this frenzy of\r\nsquabbling is given a great deal of space in the _Miners' Magazine_\r\n(the official journal of the Western Federation) during the last three\r\nmonths of 1906.[255]\r\n\r\nThe men most prominent in the activities of the second convention were\r\nDaniel DeLeon, Vincent St. John, C. O. Sherman, and Wm. E. Trautmann.\r\nMembers of the Socialist party were less prominent and numerous than\r\nthey had been a year before. Neither Mr. Simons nor Mr. Debs was\r\npresent at the 1906 meeting. The Socialist Labor party contingent was,\r\nhowever, quite as strong as ever--one of its new delegates being Mr.\r\nPaul Augustine, later the National Secretary of the Socialist Labor\r\nparty.[256] DeLeon's influence was as strong as ever. He was declared\r\nto have controlled the convention--this was reiterated by individuals\r\nboth inside and outside. Ex-President Sherman, in a speech in his own\r\ndefense on the convention floor, said:\r\n\r\n    Delegate DeLeon has controlled this convention.... But, ...\r\n    while I endorse the underlying principles that are advocated\r\n    by the Socialist Labor party ... I am opposed to their tactics\r\n    and I do not hesitate to say that time will demonstrate to the\r\n    working class that their tactics are suicide [_sic_] to the\r\n    movement.[257]\r\n\r\nThe members of the Socialist party, naturally biased against the\r\nSocialist Labor party, were quite ready to accuse its representatives\r\nof steam-roller methods at the 1906 convention. As before, these\r\ninsinuations were quite correct in that the Socialist Labor party,\r\nthrough its unofficial representatives, most of all through DeLeon,\r\ndid thus indirectly have a great deal of influence in the convention.\r\nBut it is yet open to question whether this influence was a pernicious\r\none. Moreover, the dominant policy of the convention was not an unmixed\r\nDeLeon policy and the dominant group contained another element, _viz._,\r\nthe more thoroughgoing non-, or rather, _anti_-political faction,\r\nattaching to no political party whatever. The chief spokesmen of this\r\nelement were William E. Trautmann, the Secretary-Treasurer, and Vincent\r\nSt. John,[258] who was to succeed the former in that office several\r\nyears later. He was a member and official of the Western Federation\r\nof Miners, and a radical and enthusiastic devotee of the principle of\r\nindustrial unionism. He emphatically opposed the action of the Western\r\nFederation officials at the 1906 convention and instead of following\r\nthe majority bolt from the I. W. W., he bolted the Western Federation\r\nand was elected a member of the General Executive Board of the I. W.\r\nW.[259]\r\n\r\nThese two men represented the alleged Anarchist end of the so-called\r\n\"DeLeon-Anarchist combine\" and were the real spokesmen of the more\r\nrevolutionary element. They would have preferred to have had the\r\npolitical clause of the Preamble stricken out, but were not powerful\r\nenough to swing the majority of the delegates to that position and\r\nfinally agreed as a compromise to stand with DeLeon and his followers\r\nfor the retention of the political clause. The fight over the political\r\nclause was thus postponed to a later convention.\r\n\r\nThe financial problem was from the first made more difficult by a kind\r\nof dual unionism which was contrary to the spirit, at least, of the\r\nI. W. W. law, but which was tolerated because quite unavoidable. The\r\ninvoluntary connection of many local unions with more than one general\r\norganization resulted in the subjection of such unions to the payment\r\nof dues to each central organization. To relieve this excessive burden\r\nof taxation it was decided by the General Executive Board to make a\r\ndiscount from the regular dues in favor of all locals thus situated.\r\nThis discounting policy, felt to be necessary in order to hold many\r\nunions in the organization, meant a loss of revenue which could ill be\r\nborne.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in consideration of some material equipment in the way of\r\noffice furniture and supplies, seals and charters were furnished free\r\nof charge to all unions formerly with the American Labor Union or the\r\nSocialist Trade and Labor Alliance. To top all, the mismanagement\r\nand extravagance resulting from discord in the general office, and\r\nincompetence among the officials, almost strangled the organization\r\nbefore its first anniversary. Debts were contracted with manufacturers\r\nand\r\n\r\n    the inability to pay ... nearly endangered the very existence\r\n    of the organization, when threats were made to disclose the\r\n    real state of affairs to parties who were straining every nerve\r\n    to see the smashing of the I. W. W.... Personal loans had to be\r\n    contracted to deposit money at the bank when the account was\r\n    overdrawn and for three months in succession the constant fear\r\n    that these conditions would become known kept the real workers\r\n    on the administration from engaging enough assistance to carry\r\n    on the necessary work....[260]\r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties there was turned into and expended from the\r\nGeneral Defense Fund (in addition to the voluntary subscriptions) the\r\nsum of $8,910.00 in behalf of twelve different strikes. The report of\r\nthe auditing committee showed that there was on hand August 22, 1906, a\r\nnet balance of $3,555.92.[261]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[222] In a letter quoted by Brooks, _American Syndicalism: the I.

The activities of the past fourteen months had\r\nbrought new and challenging questions to the fore. One of the most\r\nimportant was the problem of the agricultural laborer. Attention\r\ncentered upon the farm laborers and the lumber workers. Most of the\r\nindustrialists agreed that the coöperation of the country workers--farm\r\nlaborers and lumbermen--and the city proletariat was absolutely\r\nnecessary for the success of revolutionary industrialism.\r\n\r\n    The agricultural elements of the working class [said one of the\r\n    delegates at the second convention] are going to be the last\r\n    and hardest to be organized into this economic organization,\r\n    and ... while we may have the wage slaves of the industrial\r\n    centers organized, when the crisis comes we will find [them]\r\n    ... in an economic organization and bucking against a\r\n    combination of capitalists and agriculturists, and when that\r\n    time comes we will of necessity have to exercise our political\r\n    rights and overthrow that opposition.[262]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. had already made some headway among the lumber workers,\r\nand it was in connection with this element that many believed it most\r\nfeasible to organize the farm laborers. Secretary Trautmann devoted two\r\nsolid pages of his report to the discussion of the relation of the\r\nfarm and forest workers with the city proletariat. He believed that\r\nthe failure of revolutionary movements was often due to the lack of\r\ncoöperation between these sections of the working class. He urged the\r\norganization to follow among the farm laborers those methods which had\r\nalready been applied with some success in the lumber camps.\r\n\r\n    For this work of organizing the farm laborers [he said] we\r\n    must look for actual support to the thousands and hundreds\r\n    of thousands of wage-earners in the lumber camps of the\r\n    United States and Canada. No element is so faithful to the\r\n    principle, when once understood, as the hard-working pioneer\r\n    proletarians in the woods, nor a group of toilers who will\r\n    fight more vigorously ... than those who ... call themselves\r\n    \"lumberjacks.\" Their relation with the farm laborers and the\r\n    ... [seasonal] character of their employment should serve as\r\n    the key to open the field for the organizing of the farm wage\r\n    slaves. In the summer months most of the lumbermen work as farm\r\n    hands or in the saw-mills, and many a blacklisted mechanic from\r\n    industrial centers seeks as a last refuge from the master's\r\n    persecution employment as constantly shifting farm laborer and\r\n    lumberman. The Industrial Workers of the World have organized\r\n    and are organizing with astonishing success the lumbermen in\r\n    different parts of the country.... But ... their condition will\r\n    be jeopardized if the I. W. W. fails to organize the workers\r\n    in the fields in which they seek and secure employment during\r\n    the remainder of the year, that is mostly in agricultural\r\n    occupations, ... [and] ... to assure a successful protection of\r\n    farm laborers and lumbermen, it is absolutely necessary to get\r\n    the organizations so organized into direct touch through the\r\n    general administration of the I. W. W. with the organizations\r\n    of the Industrial Workers in the cities.[263]\r\n\r\nAn important change in the geographical distribution of propaganda and\r\norganizing activities was that suggested to the convention by President\r\nSherman. He thought that these activities of the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World should not be immediately spread indiscriminately over all\r\nparts of the country, believing it to be most expedient to allow the\r\neastern section of the United States to lie fallow for a time, so to\r\nspeak. He recommended that\r\n\r\n    the greater part of the money expended for paid organizers be\r\n    devoted to the western States for the next six months, for the\r\n    following reasons: West of the Missouri River the industrial\r\n    conditions are in a far better state ... than they are in\r\n    the eastern States and organizing can be done there without\r\n    endangering turmoil in the way of lockouts and strikes.... We\r\n    must get a substantial organization in the West ... before we\r\n    will be prepared to make a general campaign in the East, as\r\n    in the eastern States the workers in many of the industries\r\n    are so poorly paid that a strike or lockout means starvation\r\n    if finance is not forthcoming.... Hence I feel the necessity\r\n    of first fortifying ourselves with a good Western membership\r\n    before exposing the organization to a general assault by the\r\n    employers of the East.[264]\r\n\r\nThis proposal was, however, not very favorably received by the\r\nconvention. The committee on reports of officers made, among others,\r\nthis recommendation, which received the endorsement of the convention:\r\n\r\n    We disagree with our President regarding organizing in the West\r\n    in preference to the East.... The committee believes that [the\r\n    fact] that conditions in the East are deplorable is the very\r\n    reason why organizing work is necessary in the East, that the\r\n    standard of living may be improved, thus accomplishing a more\r\n    uniform standard of working-class solidarity.[265]\r\n\r\nThe average member of the Industrial Workers of the World was\r\nexceedingly sceptical of the value of undiluted representative\r\ndemocracy for either a labor union or a political state. He suspected\r\nthat any official might, and probably would, be disloyal. He\r\nrealized how difficult it is for any organization which depends on\r\nrepresentatives to maintain a body of such representatives who really\r\nrepresent. He knew how easy it is for a delegate to be \"reached\"--to\r\nbe influenced by one of a score of insidious forms of corruption. This\r\naccounts for the stress laid by the Industrial Workers of the World\r\nupon the referendum idea, from the very beginning of its existence. Let\r\nthe acts of delegates in convention be ratified by referendum vote.\r\nThe convention is the law-making body, but it is always subject to\r\nthe will of rank and file. All factions, even that one which plotted\r\ndisruption, united in lip service, at least, to the idea of the\r\nreferendum. Labor-union democracy must be made democratic by referendum\r\ncontrol. How much of all this referendum clamor was \"sounding brass\" is\r\nindicated by some remarks made by Mr. DeLeon (who, of course, believed\r\nin the referendum) at the second convention:\r\n\r\n    I think it is positively comical [he said] to see men who\r\n    stand convicted before this convention of having trampled on\r\n    the principles of this constitution ... who have refused the\r\n    referendum, men who suspended locals because they did not\r\n    submit to the men who lined up with those elements; I think it\r\n    is positively comical to have such elements come before this\r\n    convention and bow down to the referendum and salaam and kowtow\r\n    to the rank and file, or start off screeching like howling\r\n    dervishes--\"referendum\"![266]\r\n\r\nThe convention had to face the important fact that a very large\r\nproportion of the human raw-material for I. W. W. propaganda were\r\nforeigners, new to America and speaking alien tongues. From the very\r\nfirst a very liberal policy in regard to the foreign element had\r\nbeen adopted by the Industrial Workers of the World. Certainly they\r\ncould not consistently adopt a narrow policy here and draw the color\r\nline it they intended really to become an all-inclusive democratic\r\norganization. It will be remembered that protest against discrimination\r\nagainst the negro by craft unions was voiced by William D. Haywood at\r\nthe very opening of the first convention.[267] At the second convention\r\nthis liberal attitude was maintained in regard to all foreign elements.\r\nMoreover, in the work of organizing the immigrants it was proposed to\r\ngo still further and take the aggressive.\r\n\r\n    This convention [said Secretary Trautmann] should instruct\r\n    the incoming Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the\r\n    World to immediately find the necessary agencies in Europe,\r\n    so that immigrants to this country, before leaving, will be\r\n    already furnished with all the information necessary, and be\r\n    enlightened as to the real conditions in the United States,\r\n    and an appeal should be made to them to immediately join the\r\n    existing organizations of the Industrial Workers of the World\r\n    immediately after they accept employment in any industry. The\r\n    literature of the Industrial Workers of the World should be\r\n    distributed in different languages in the various emigration\r\n    ports in Europe, and central bureaus be established by the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World in American harbors, and be\r\n    opened to the immigrants, and information should be furnished\r\n    them [as to] how they could ... participate in the struggles of\r\n    organized labor....[268]\r\n\r\nRequests were made at the convention for literature in many foreign\r\nlanguages--Macedonian, Jewish, Italian, Slavonian, Spanish, etc.--on\r\nbehalf of these and others. Foreign-language publications and pamphlets\r\nwere issued and foreign-language branches of the local unions had been\r\nestablished and continued to be extended in scope after the second\r\nconvention. The Italian Socialist Federation asked for the services\r\nof an Italian organizer, and one was provided. An Italian paper,\r\n_Il Proletario_, had been appearing for a short time as an official\r\norgan of the Industrial Workers of the World, and its publication was\r\ncontinued under the supervision of the General Executive Board.[269]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the structure and scheme of organization in the local\r\nunions was modified to suit the requirements of a polyglot membership.\r\nA motion was proposed and carried\r\n\r\n    to allow wage-earners of a given nationality to form unions\r\n    of their own in the respective industries in which they are\r\n    employed and where there are not enough to form unions of that\r\n    kind, the parent unions shall allow the [non-English-speaking]\r\n    members ... to have branch meetings for educational\r\n    purposes.[270]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that sex lines were ignored quite as completely as\r\nrace lines. Perhaps the organization leaned backwards a little in the\r\npolicy of special inducements to women and \"juniors\"--indicated in the\r\nresolution carried \"to remit for female members, ten cents per member\r\nper month to the union, the same to apply to juniors.\"[271]\r\n\r\nThe character of the unit group--the local union--as being preëminently\r\nindustrial in nature, was emphatically reaffirmed and more fully\r\ndefined than ever before.\r\n\r\n    ... the smallest unit of an industrial union [says Secretary\r\n    Trautmann] comprises the employees in one industrial plant,\r\n    whether large or small. Likewise should all the employees\r\n    of industrial corporations, no matter where ... employed,\r\n    be members in that respective department of wage-earners,\r\n    if already organized. Taking for illustration the Mining\r\n    Department, it should embrace within its folds not only the\r\n    metalliferous, the coal and the salt miners, all the employees\r\n    in the oil and gas fields, and the various plants connected\r\n    with that industry, but also the employees in oil and gas\r\n    refineries, the teamsters and distributors of oil, and any\r\n    other mining products in the large or small industrial centers.\r\n    They should belong to the same department in which the workers\r\n    in the mines, or in the oil fields, are organized.[272]\r\n\r\nThere was some agitation in New York City in the summer of 1906 to\r\norganize that section on a basis of one local union to each industry,\r\nwith each local divided into sub-branches as the needs and extent\r\nof its constituency might require. These latter sub-branches were,\r\nmoreover, to have no direct connection with the General Organization.\r\nThis plan was opposed at the convention. It was in conflict with the\r\npolicy of centralization which characterized the earlier stages of I.\r\nW. W. development. It was emphatically condemned by President Sherman\r\nas a violation of the constitution. He asserted that it centered the\r\n\"power of the whole industry in the hands of the members of one local\r\nunion.\"[273]\r\n\r\nCentralization was wanted--but it was _national_ (or international)\r\ncentralization, not district centralization. A provision had been made\r\nthe year before for what were called \"mixed locals\" which were to\r\ninclude workers in various industries, but only so to include them\r\ntemporarily; it being understood that so soon as a sufficient number\r\nof the workers in any particular industry came into the locality to\r\nwarrant their organization into a union that all members of the mixed\r\nlocal who belonged to that industry should immediately withdraw from\r\nthe \"mixed\" and join the \"pure\" industrial union. It was, of course,\r\nassumed that no one should join a mixed local or remain in a mixed\r\nlocal when a union of his industry existed in that locality. The\r\nprivilege of membership in the mixed locals had already been very much\r\nabused. In numerous instances it was found that members continued as\r\nmembers of the mixed local, even after their particular industrial\r\nunion had been organized, or even maintained membership in both the\r\nmixed and the industrial body at the same time. This double membership\r\nwas not only of no value--it was usually positively disastrous. It\r\nmade confusion and brought on factional fights between \"mixed\" and\r\nindustrial bodies,[274] and resulted in a double, and consequently\r\ninflated, membership representation at the annual conventions. After an\r\nextended discussion of the seemingly unmixed evils of mixed \"locals,\"\r\nthe convention passed a resolution defining their functions. \"The mixed\r\nlocal,\" runs the resolution, \"is not to be a permanent institution\r\nin the I. W. W. It is merely the propaganda [body] that will build\r\nup an industrial union for the future. It is a recruiting station\r\n[only].\"[275]\r\n\r\nImportant subdivisions of the organization were the Industrial\r\nCouncils. These had been constitutionally defined as \"central bodies\r\ncomposed of seven or more local unions in two or more industries.\"[276]\r\nSuch central bodies had been organized during the first year in New\r\nYork, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Paterson, N. J., and Flat River,\r\nMo., and were, according to Secretary Trautmann, \"in process of\r\nformation in Cleveland, Seattle, and Toronto, Canada.\"[277] Steps had\r\nalso been taken toward the formation of the Arizona (state) District\r\nIndustrial Council. These bodies had a definite future rôle as well as\r\nan immediate function mapped out for them. Here is given some little\r\nconception of the anticipated _modus operandi_ of one part of the\r\ncoöperative machinery of a future industrial society--of which the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World is proposing to be the framework. The\r\nwork of the industrial councils, present and future, is explained by\r\nWm. E. Trautmann as follows:\r\n\r\n    If it is the final object of the Industrial Workers of\r\n    the World to prepare the government for the coöperative\r\n    commonwealth, then likewise should provisions be made to\r\n    organize the agency, through which the administration of\r\n    cities and rural districts [can] be conducted. The Industrial\r\n    Council should, therefore, be organized for that purpose, and\r\n    the territory to be covered by such organization should be\r\n    determined by the central administration.... While the future\r\n    functions of such councils will consist in the administration\r\n    of the industries by the chosen representatives of the various\r\n    industrial unions, their present-day duties should be to\r\n    direct the propaganda, the organizing work, the education\r\n    through central agencies, the direction of strikes, and other\r\n    means of warfare between the workers and the shirkers, and\r\n    the supervision of organizers; in fact, all such functions as\r\n    will yield better results, if carried out by a collective\r\n    direction, should come within the jurisdiction sphere of such\r\n    councils.[278]\r\n\r\nThe original constitution had provided for thirteen international\r\nindustrial departments, which could be organized in any industry so\r\nsoon as it contained ten locals with a membership of not less than\r\n3,000 members.[279] The reaction against the departmental idea at the\r\nsecond convention was sufficiently strong to carry an amendment to\r\nthe constitution making the prerequisite to departmental organization\r\nin any industry \"ten locals with a membership of not less than 10,000\r\nmembers.\" This change was partly the result of a general feeling that\r\nthe departmental system was not as practicable as had been at first\r\nbelieved. Moreover, it was believed that, so long as departments could\r\nbe organized on the basis of a membership of only 3,000, departmental\r\nautonomy would be an absolute farce, and simply resolve itself into\r\nlocal union or locality domination. The defenders of the departmental\r\nidea rightly insisted that that idea be given a fair chance to work\r\nitself out. Another group--industrial unionists who laid great stress\r\non the local industrial union as _the_ division which should first\r\nof all be possessed of complete autonomy--felt that this change\r\nwas a change in their favor in so far as it made the attainment of\r\nthe departmental status more difficult and the existing number of\r\ndepartments actually less. The departments, thought DeLeon,\r\n\r\n    must be in the nature of the states of the United States and\r\n    ... there should be no less and no more autonomy, and for the\r\n    same reason that this government of the United States is not\r\n    a government of the states but a government of the people,\r\n    for the same reason the government of this I. W. W. is not a\r\n    government of departments, it is a government of the rank and\r\n    file.[280]\r\n\r\nThe Universal Label, provided for in Article IV., Section 10, of the\r\noriginal constitution, had not given entire satisfaction. In fact,\r\na number of the delegates wished to abolish the label altogether.\r\nThis demand grew out of the misuse of the label itself. Many locals\r\nsuffered it to get into the hands of employers, others coöperated with\r\ntheir employers in its use. Now coöperation with employers in any way\r\nwhatever is in absolute violation of the spirit and letter of the I. W.\r\nW. law. Hence the label was looked upon by many as something of a very\r\ncompromising nature. It came near being entirely abolished, but finally\r\nit was decided that the label be retained, but used only in strict\r\naccord with the provisions of \"Resolution A,\" which reveals the rôle of\r\nthe red (revolutionary) label as opposed to that of the orthodox (\"pure\r\nand simple\") trade-union label. The resolution reads:\r\n\r\n    Whereas, the universal label of our union has been productive\r\n    of both good results, such as the general advertising of\r\n    our name and the graphic presentation of the unity and\r\n    comprehensive character of the I. W. W. to the minds of the\r\n    proletariat; and of evil results, such as the advertising\r\n    of merchandise, the fostering of a tendency towards the\r\n    coöperation of the classes, the general confusion of the minds\r\n    of working men in regard to the nature of the class struggle,\r\n    and in its failure to explain its own significance as to just\r\n    what or how much of the work on a product was done by I. W. W.\r\n    men; and,\r\n\r\n    Whereas, It should be our endeavor to retain every weapon that\r\n    is efficient for the proletariat and against the capitalists;\r\n    be it, therefore,\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That, in an endeavor to eliminate the evils and\r\n    continue the good effects of our first year's experiment, we\r\n    retain the universal label; and be it\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the use of the universal label shall never be\r\n    delegated to employers, but shall be vested entirely in our\r\n    organization; and be it further\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That except on stickers, circulars and literature\r\n    presenting the merits of the I. W. W., and emanating from the\r\n    general offices of the I. W. W., the universal label shall be\r\n    retained only as evidence of work done by I. W. W. men; and be\r\n    it further\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That when the label is so printed, it shall be done\r\n    by the authority of our union without the intervention of any\r\n    employer; and be it further\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That when our universal label is placed upon a\r\n    commodity as evidence of work done by our men, it shall be\r\n    accompanied by an inscription underneath the label stating\r\n    what the work is that our men have done, giving the name of\r\n    the industrial department to which they belong and the number\r\n    or numbers of their local unions, and that the universal label\r\n    shall never be printed as evidence of work performed without\r\n    this inscription; and be it further\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the universal label shall be of a uniform\r\n    crimson color and always the same in design.[281]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that experience with, and the deposition of,\r\nPresident Sherman resulted in the abolition of the office of General\r\nPresident. No doubt the Sherman controversy was the principal\r\npredisposing cause, but it is very probable that there would have been\r\nsome agitation for the abolition of that office even if there had\r\nnot been a single charge against Sherman as President. A good many\r\nwere a little shy of the name \"President\"--it savored of the present\r\npolitical state! Others thought it involved too great concentration of\r\npower in the hands of one individual. These latter were the sponsors\r\nof the \"rank and file\" and the forerunners of those who later figured\r\nas \"decentralizers\" in the controversy concerning centralization in\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World.[282] \"The people who direct the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World,\" said Delegate Reid, \"are the rank\r\nand file.... In a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom, and wisdom\r\nis not in the brain of one man to direct this institution.\"[283]\r\nFurthermore, as DeLeon pointed out, \"the President is mainly,\r\nessentially and exclusively an organizer, a general organizer with\r\na high-sounding title and wages and expenses to match....\"[284] The\r\ncommittee appointed to report on the advisability of retaining the\r\noffice of President reported that it came to its negative conclusion\r\n\"on the assumption that there was not a man in this convention strong\r\nenough or capable enough to assume the office of President.\"[285]\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the industrial abolitionists did not end with the\r\nattempt to abolish the departments and the universal label, and the\r\nsuccessful abolition of the office of General President. Many less\r\nimportant matters were put under the ban. It was decreed that \"all\r\nrituals, signs, grips and passwords, borrowed from pure and simpledom,\r\nbe abolished,\" and that the use of all terms of salutation of the\r\nmore orthodox sort, such as \"brother\" and \"comrade\" be abolished\r\nand the term \"fellow-worker\" be used on all occasions.[286] Of more\r\nmaterial consequence to those concerned was the reduction made in\r\nthe salaries of the national officers. The salaries of the General\r\nSecretary-Treasurer (now the national head of the organization), and\r\nAssistant General Secretary-Treasurer were reduced from one hundred\r\nand twenty-five dollars per month, to one hundred dollars.[287] The\r\ncommittee making the recommendation felt that former salary was a sum\r\nof absurdly bourgeois magnitude!\r\n\r\nThe question of political action[288] was thoroughly ventilated once\r\nmore. The more revolutionary group of industrialists renewed their\r\nfight to have the clause \"until all the toilers come together on the\r\npolitical as well as the industrial field\" cleansed from the taint of\r\npolitics by the striking out of the words \"political as well as.\" The\r\nmotion involving this change was emphatically opposed by the spokesman\r\nof the Socialist Labor party faction. Daniel DeLeon and Hermann\r\nRichter both spoke against the motion. Mr. Richter, later the General\r\nSecretary-Treasurer of the Detroit (S. L. P.) faction of the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World, believed that \"if a man takes the obligation as\r\na member of this organization there is a duty upon that member to be\r\nactive at all times, and especially on election day, in behalf of his\r\nclass and of himself as a member thereof.\"[289]\r\n\r\nNeither side was wholly successful. By way of compromise it was\r\nfinally agreed that the clause containing the rather distasteful word\r\n\"political\" should stand unaltered, but that an additional clause\r\nshould be appended at the end of the Preamble. This new clause reads:\r\n\"Therefore, without endorsing or desiring the endorsement of any\r\npolitical party, we unite under the following constitution.\"[290]\r\nPolitical action was still recognized and no less emphatically endorsed\r\nthan before,[291] but all political activities would now be subject to\r\nvery definite constitutional restrictions as to the relations between\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World and the political parties.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that, if politics was to be discounted in the preamble,\r\nthe discussion of that subject in the local union should surely be\r\nsubject to restriction if not absolute taboo. This was President\r\nSherman's attitude. He thought\r\n\r\n    that literature bearing on any complexion of a political nature\r\n    should be barred from any economic industrial meeting, and\r\n    that all organizers [of] ... the Industrial Workers of the\r\n    World shall enforce such principles.... Your president does not\r\n    hesitate to say that, in his belief, if the Industrial Workers\r\n    of the World is not kept clear from all political agitation\r\n    for the next few years to come ... it will be impossible to\r\n    build up an industrial organization....[292]\r\n\r\nThe convention did not agree with him. No doubt this was partly due\r\nto the fact that the majority of the delegates could not persuade\r\nthemselves to tolerate any suggestion (be it ever so wise a one)\r\nmade by President Sherman. Moreover, it must have been realized that\r\nsuch a prohibition of political literature or political discussion\r\ncould really never be enforced; that on the contrary it would even\r\n_stimulate_ such discussion. However this may be, the committee on good\r\nand welfare submitted under this head the recommendation that \"in local\r\nunions at least ten minutes be given to the discussion of economic and\r\npolitical questions at each meeting.\" This resolution was endorsed by\r\nthe convention.[293]\r\n\r\nThe famous Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone case occupied much of the\r\nattention of the second convention. At the time of the convention these\r\nthree men (of whom the two former were members and officers of the\r\nWestern Federation of Miners--then the Mining Department of the I. W.\r\nW.) were imprisoned in the Ada County jail at Boise, Idaho, charged\r\nwith the murder of ex-Governor Steunenberg of that state. This great\r\nlabor case, culminating in 1907 in the trial and acquittal of the three\r\nmen, makes up one of the most interesting and dramatic chapters in the\r\nannals of the labor movement. It was an event which deeply concerned\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World, and was a really potent factor\r\nin shaping the subsequent history of that organization. The story of\r\nthe judicial deportation of these three men had of course become\r\nknown to the world long before the 1906 convention of the I. W. W.,\r\nbut none the less a brief recital of the event and the part taken by\r\nthe I. W. W. therein was incorporated in President Sherman's report\r\nto the convention. Some excerpts from this report are here quoted. It\r\nshould be remembered that, at the time of the deportation and trial of\r\nthese officials of the Western Federation of Miners, that organization\r\nwas a part of the Industrial Workers of the World, and that (with the\r\nexception of Pettibone) these men were, at least formally, I. W. W.\r\nmen, though they were referred to almost constantly as officials of the\r\nWestern Federation of Miners.\r\n\r\n    It pains me to report [said President Sherman] that on\r\n    Saturday evening, February 17th,[294] Brother Charles H.\r\n    Moyer, President of the Department of Mining; Brother William\r\n    D. Haywood, Secretary of the Department of Mining; and Geo.\r\n    A. Pettibone, ex-member of the Western Federation of Miners,\r\n    were kidnapped by officers of the state of Idaho and, on the\r\n    same date, at 11:30 o'clock P. M., were forcibly placed on a\r\n    special train and taken from the state of Colorado and placed\r\n    in jail in the state of Idaho, charged with murder. This was\r\n    done without giving the accused brothers an opportunity for a\r\n    defense or hearing. They were arrested at night and were given\r\n    no opportunity to notify their families, friends or legal\r\n    advisers of their condition.[295]\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers of the World was among the first to come to the\r\ndefense of the indicted men. The General Office in Chicago immediately\r\nsent out thousands of circular letters throughout the country asking\r\nfor contributions; large amounts were turned over to the Special\r\nDefense Fund from the General Defense Fund of the I. W.\r\n\r\nW., and finally a total of $10,982.51 was raised. This, labor's common\r\nextremity, did actually, though but temporarily, achieve that miracle\r\n(to appear later in San Diego and Lawrence) of I. W. W.'s, Socialists,\r\nSocialist Laborites, Anarchists, and \"Pure and Simplers,\"[296]\r\neven, coöperating in a common activity. The I. W. W. was the first\r\nto organize protest meetings, and secured the services of Clarence\r\nS. Darrow for the legal defense. The slogan \"Shall our brothers be\r\nmurdered?\" was reiterated on every hand and made the watchword of the\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe situation was still a desperate one at the time of the 1906\r\nconvention. The men were still held in jail awaiting trial. It seems to\r\nhave been the general belief that they were to be \"railroaded\" to the\r\npenitentiary or the gallows, and the conduct of the prosecution as well\r\nas the postponement of the trial, all tended to strengthen that belief.\r\nThe delegates at the convention decided to turn fifty per cent of the\r\nper-capita tax of the Mining Department into the Moyer-Haywood Defense\r\nFund. Some of the delegates undoubtedly exaggerated the influence of\r\nthe I. W. W. in the Moyer-Haywood affair. Thus William E. Trautmann\r\nasserted on the floor of the convention that\r\n\r\n    Money and the best legal talent would not have been able to\r\n    save the lives of Charles H. Moyer, William D. Haywood, Geo. A.\r\n    Pettibone and Vincent St. John;[297] their dead bodies would\r\n    ... bear testimony to the outrages perpetrated by the class\r\n    controlling the resources of this land, and all institutions of\r\n    oppression, were it not for the vigilance of the few.... men\r\n    of the I. W. W., who, facing all the calumnies of the public\r\n    press ... threw their lives into the scale in order to raise\r\n    the issue. We must prevent the judicial murder.[298]\r\n\r\nThe jailing of Haywood, especially, one of the most aggressive and\r\ninfluential organizers of the I. W. W., deeply affected the members\r\nof that body and really subtracted much from their strength. It was\r\ngenerally felt among laboring men and women that Moyer and Haywood\r\nwere jailed because they were members of the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld, or because they were Socialists. A letter written by Haywood\r\nin the Ada County jail on the day that the second convention opened\r\nin Chicago indicates the active interest he continued to take in the\r\norganization even during his imprisonment. It is here given in part:\r\n\r\n                                    ADA COUNTY JAIL,\r\n                                    BOISE, IDAHO, SEPT. 17, 1906.\r\n\r\n    TO THE OFFICERS AND DELEGATES OF THE SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION\r\n      OF THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n  _Comrades and Fellow Workers_:\r\n\r\n    While you have been in convention today, I have devoted the\r\n    hours to a careful review of the proceedings of the initial\r\n    convention of the I. W. W. and of the conference that issued\r\n    the Manifesto leading up to the formation of the organization\r\n    which has ... rekindled the smouldering fire of ambition and\r\n    hope in the breasts of the working class of this continent....\r\n    [Quoting here from his own letter to the fourteenth convention\r\n    of the Western Federation of Miners] organized industrially,\r\n    united politically, labor will assume grace and dignity, horny\r\n    hand and busy brain will be the badge of distinction and honor,\r\n    all humanity will be free from bondage, a fraternal brotherhood\r\n    imbued with the spirit of independence and freedom, tempered\r\n    with the sentiment of justice and love of order; such will be\r\n    ... the goal [and] aspiration of the Industrial Workers of the\r\n    World.[299]\r\n\r\nThe message was received with boundless enthusiasm. It stimulated all\r\nto more determined efforts in behalf of the accused. It doubtless\r\nhad some share in influencing the minds of that group amongst the\r\ndelegates, who were inclined to favor the general-strike idea. At any\r\nrate, they now urged that that idea be applied in the Moyer, Haywood\r\nand Pettibone case. They succeeded in having this resolution presented\r\nto the convention:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That it is the sense of this convention that in the\r\n    event of a new delay in the trial of our brothers, Moyer,\r\n    Haywood, and Pettibone, or in the event of an unjust sentence\r\n    in their case, the national headquarters of the I. W. W. shall\r\n    immediately proceed to call a general strike and use every\r\n    possible means and all the funds at its command in order to\r\n    warrant the working class to resist and overcome the violence\r\n    of the masters.[300]\r\n\r\nA resolution of this sort would, if it had been presented under similar\r\ncircumstances, to, say, the 1914 convention of the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World, very probably be quite unanimously endorsed, but the\r\nI. W. W. of 1906 rejected the proposal. This does not mean that the\r\ngeneral-strike principle had not taken root in the I. W. W. at all.\r\nIt had. Witness the following excerpt from the recommendation of the\r\nCommittee on the Reports of Officers:\r\n\r\n    We disagree with our President regarding the general strike\r\n    and contend that a general lockout of the capitalist class is\r\n    the method by which ... to emancipate our class. We believe\r\n    that the general strike be employed temporarily, as a means\r\n    to wring concessions from the capitalist class from time to\r\n    time. The committee believes that a protracted general strike\r\n    would be no less than an insane act on the part of the working\r\n    class.[301]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Moyer-Haywood trial and the final acquittal[302] of\r\nthe accused men made the I. W. W. somewhat more commonly known and\r\nunderstood among the working class throughout the country, it was on\r\nthe whole nothing less than a calamity for that organization. The I.\r\nW. W. did not even get publicity out of the Moyer-Haywood case. The\r\nWestern Federation got all the advertising. It was a well-established\r\nlabor organization with an eventful--almost a lurid--history. Its early\r\nactivities were more or less related to the Moyer-Haywood-Pettibone\r\naffair and the general public very naturally thought of the Western\r\nFederation when they thought of the Haywood deportation. The I. W.\r\nW. was not popularly associated with the Boise trial at all. The\r\norganization was obliged almost completely to suspend its vital work\r\nof organizing to raise funds for the defense. But this was not the\r\nmost serious result. The Moyer-Haywood-Pettibone deportation was\r\nunquestionably one of the causes operating to split off the Western\r\nFederation of Miners. The imprisonment of Haywood certainty weakened\r\nthat element in the Western Federation which backed the I. W. W.\r\nand strengthened the hands of those who were opposed to continued\r\nincorporation with it. This, combined with the deposition of President\r\nSherman, which yet further weakened the forces of the Miners who\r\nsupported the I. W. W., finally gave the I. W. W. knockers in the\r\nWestern Federation the upper hand. The result was, first a decision by\r\nreferendum vote of the Western Federation of Miners not to pay dues\r\nto either the Shermanite or the anti-Shermanite factions in the I. W.\r\nW., and second, the formal withdrawal of the Mining Department and the\r\nreëstablishment of an independent Western Federation of Miners in the\r\nsummer of 1907.[303]\r\n\r\nSeveral other matters of relatively lesser import were given some\r\nattention. Even the difficulty of jurisdictional conflict, the bugbear\r\nof the craft union, was known and struggled with in a labor body\r\nsupposed to be jurisdiction-controversy proof. It was so ideally,\r\nbut the compromises it was obliged to make with the craft form of\r\nunion naturally made trouble. Slight changes were made in the system\r\nof dues; the preamble and constitution were both somewhat improved\r\nin diction and altered in a few other minor details, but they both\r\nremained fundamentally as worked out in the first convention, except\r\nfor the abolition of the presidential office. The following officers\r\nwere elected for the succeeding year: William E. Trautmann (to succeed\r\nhimself as) General Secretary-Treasurer, and Messrs. Vincent St.\r\nJohn, A. Maichele, T. J. Cole, C. E. Mahoney and E. Fischer, members\r\nof the General Executive Board, and Mr. A. S. Edwards, Editor of the\r\n_Industrial Union Bulletin_. It was decided that the conventions be\r\nheld the third Monday in September instead of the first Monday in May,\r\nand in Chicago unless otherwise specified. The convention adjourned on\r\nOct. 3, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent opinion at the time, and since, among the craft-unionists\r\nof the American Federation and among the party Socialists--in fact,\r\namong all those whose radicalism is comparatively conservative--was\r\nthat this second convention marked the beginning of the end of the I.\r\nW. W., or at least that the loss of the Mining Department (probably the\r\norganization's most conservative element) was an almost irreparable\r\nloss. \"That the I. W. W. received its death blow at Chicago and will\r\ngradually disintegrate\" is a fact, according to Max Hayes, \"that no\r\ncareful observer of labor affairs will attempt to dispute.\"[304] But\r\nthe I. W. W. continued to exist, and finally to do more than exist,\r\nin spite of the upheaval of 1906. It is indeed doubtful if the losses\r\nof that year were unmixed calamities. Though they did deprive the\r\norganization of its most reputable, best financed, and most respectable\r\nelements, their loss tended to give sharp definition and emphatic\r\nimpulse toward a more revolutionary policy. This policy was now to\r\nbe applied and tested among those forming the lower stratum of the\r\nproletarian mass--the unskilled and migratory workers. This clear-cut\r\ndefinition of policy and its point of application might never have\r\nbeen possible if the complete working-class hierarchy--from lumberjack\r\nto locomotive engineer--had been preserved. The I. W. W. became after\r\n1906, and still more after 1908, an organization of the unskilled and\r\nvery conspicuously of the migratory and frequently jobless unskilled.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[262] _Proceedings_, p. 309.\r\n\r\n[263] _Proceedings, Second I.

W. W. was in session in Chicago for\r\neight days beginning September 16, 1907. This was a much less turbulent\r\ngathering than the one of the preceding year. DeLeon's chronicler says\r\nthat: \"At the third convention of the I. W. W.... almost complete\r\nharmony prevailed. The organization had so far recuperated from the\r\nblow it had received the year before that several organizers were being\r\nemployed and many new locals had been formed.\"[305] He admits, however,\r\nthat there was some friction, explaining that the anarchistic element\r\n\"sounded the only note of discord.\" This, he says, was the \"shadow cast\r\nbefore by the pure and simple physical force craze that came into full\r\nswing a year after.\"[306]\r\n\r\nThis, was a congress of the \"proletarian rabble\"--the DeLeon-St.\r\nJohn-Trautmann faction. The Sherman faction was no longer in existence.\r\nThe DeLeonites looked upon the Shermanites as having been from the\r\nfirst nothing more than \"a bunch of grafting politicians and labor\r\nfakirs.\" Leaders of the (Chicago) I. W. W. now speak of the 1906 and\r\nthe 1908 conventions as marking the sloughing-off of the Socialist\r\nparty politicians at the first, and the Socialist Labor party\r\npoliticians at the second, respectively. St. John says that at this\r\n1907 convention \"a slight effort was made to relegate the politician to\r\nthe rear.\"[307] The Shermanites seem to have had no really substantial\r\nconstituency at any time. However, it appears that this group did have\r\na convention in July, 1907. No proceedings or other documentary records\r\nof this convention have been discovered by the writer. The _Miners'\r\nMagazine_ remarked editorially that \"The Sherman faction that held its\r\nconvention in July (1907) was but a burlesque, while the Trautmann\r\nfaction that held its convention in September was but a grim joke.\r\nThe treasury was empty, and both factions are confronted with debts\r\nwhich cannot be met.\"[308] The Shermanite journal, _The Industrial\r\nWorker_, which had been held by the Sherman group and circulated\r\nfrom Joliet, Ill., appeared in July, 1907, and there seems to be no\r\nevidence that any subsequent numbers were issued. Both Shermanites and\r\nDeLeonites claimed control of the bulk of those I. W. W. local unions\r\nwhich remained after the breaking away of the Western Federation.[309]\r\nSherman continued to present a brave and optimistic front at the time\r\nof the fifteenth convention of the Western Federation. On June 3, 1907,\r\nhe wrote a letter to the convention urging the miners to re-affiliate\r\nwith the Industrial Workers of the World (_i. e._, the Shermanite\r\nfaction). If they would only agree to that, he declared, it would\r\n\"require not more than two months when the so-called revolutionary\r\nmovement will die of its own weight, as it is only existing at this\r\ntime under false pretenses....\"[310]\r\n\r\nNeither did the \"proletarian rabble\" have any very exalted notion of\r\nthe power of the \"reactionaries.\"\r\n\r\n    The plain truth is [declared one of the alleged false\r\n    pretenders] that the Sherman-McCabe Slugging Company has at no\r\n    time since the [second I. W. W.] convention had the support of\r\n    more than 1,000 members--something less than 100 in New York,\r\n    100 in Chicago, and the rest (reactionary pure and simple\r\n    unions) lost in the distances between Ahern's saloon at the St.\r\n    Regis and Motherwell's saloon at Bingham's Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Shermanites, however, claimed the Mining Department, and they\r\nseem on the whole to have been justified, for the pro-Sherman or\r\n\"anti-proletarian\" faction, so called, eventually dominated the\r\nfifteenth convention of the Western Federation of Miners and made\r\nwhat was already a virtual separation from the I. W. W. a formal and\r\ncomplete divorce. The Shermanite organ, the (old) _Industrial Worker_,\r\nin its issue for April, 1907, claimed that the \"Mining Department of\r\nthe Industrial Workers of the World gained nearly 3,000 members during\r\nthe month of February\" (p. 8). The Shermanites also claimed to have\r\nchartered ten locals (outside the W. F. M.) in January.[311]\r\n\r\nThere were present at the first day's session of the September 1907,\r\nconvention fifty-one delegates representing sixty-five local unions,\r\nand before the close of the convention there were 74 local unions\r\nrepresented by 53 delegates having a total of 129 votes. Few delegates\r\nhad more than two or three votes. The Paterson (N. J.) delegation had\r\n28 votes; George Speed, representing two locals, had twelve; B. H.\r\nWilliams, eleven and Daniel DeLeon, three. Contests were made on 26\r\nof the delegates. Among the other delegates to this convention were\r\nRudolph Katz. E. J. Foote, Vincent St. John, F. W. Heslewood, Wm. E.\r\nTrautmann, M. P. Hagerty, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. Mr. Katz was\r\nelected temporary chairman.[312]\r\n\r\nThe organization was not prosperous at this time. It was weakened\r\nand almost torn apart by the exhausting internal struggles it had\r\ngone though in its two short years of life. It had lost its strongest\r\nmember--its main body, almost--the Western Federation of Miners, and\r\nwith the Sherman contingent a considerable number of individual members\r\nin local unions even though the locals themselves retained their\r\naffiliation. The writer has not seen any definite statement as to the\r\nmagnitude of the loss in locals and individuals due to the Shermanite\r\ndefection. The \"proletarian rabble,\" however, claimed that \"139 of the\r\nlocal unions declared themselves in favor of all transactions of the\r\nconvention.\"[313] At this time, on the same authority, there were 358\r\nlocals \"carried on the books,\" but only 181 in good standing.[314] On\r\na basis of locals in good standing the Shermanites took with them less\r\nthan twenty-five per cent of the locals in the organization, but if\r\nwe include all locals, the Shermanites must be allowed to have taken\r\nwith them sixty per cent of the I. W. W. locals. Further evidence of\r\nserious decline is found in the very low proportion of I. W. W. local\r\nunions which were represented by delegates at the third convention. If\r\nwe may accept Secretary Trautmann's statement[315] to the convention\r\nthat there were at the time about 200 local unions in the organization,\r\nit appears that but slightly more than one-third of these locals were\r\nrepresented at the convention. The \"Wobblies\" had very little to say at\r\nthis time about the membership of the organization. Indeed, there has\r\nnever at any time been much to say about it. In 1907 they were even\r\nless aware of their own numerical strength than they usually are. They\r\nknew, of course, that it was small and that it had dwindled much since\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Western Federation of Miners followed the\r\nproceedings with no friendly eye. J. M. O'Neil declared that \"the\r\nTrautmann faction does not dare disclose its membership....\"[316]\r\nHe stated further that \"a delegate upon the floor of the September\r\nconvention asked to know the membership of the organization, but he was\r\ncurtly told by the chairman of the convention to 'never mind counting\r\nnoses but [to] go home and organize.'\"[317]\r\n\r\nOfficial reports to the fifteenth convention of the Western Federation\r\nof Miners held the preceding June, credited the I. W. W. with a\r\nmembership of 32,000, of which number 8,000 were delinquent.[318]\r\nThis estimate is presumably exclusive of the Western Federation.\r\nDelegate F. W. Heslewood (W. F. M. and I. W. W., later a member of the\r\nGeneral Executive Board of the [Chicago] I. W. W.) who was one of the\r\nso-called \"wage-slave delegates\" at the second I. W. W. convention,\r\ntells the miners' convention that \"in one local in the state of Oregon\r\nthere are over 3,000 members that travel the streets with red flags\r\nand red neckties demanding the full product of their toil....\"[319]\r\nProfessor Barnett puts the membership for 1907 at 6,700.[320] General\r\nSecretary St. John places it at 5,931.[321] He estimated the membership\r\nfor 1905-6 as 23,219. Barnett's figures are: 1905, 14,300; 1906,\r\n10,400.[322] These estimates vary widely, but this at least is evident:\r\nthere was a marked and progressive decline in membership during the\r\norganization's first two years of existence.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve-month period ending September, 1907, one hundred and\r\neighteen locals were organized.[323] Reports published from time to\r\ntime in the _Miner's Magazine_[324] indicate that from the birth of\r\nthe organization to September 17, 1906, three hundred and ninety-four\r\nlocals had been organized. A total of 512 locals had, therefore, been\r\norganized up to the convening of the third convention in September,\r\n1907. As already noted, there were in the organization at that time\r\nabout 200 local unions. The necessary inference is that three out of\r\nevery four locals organized so far in the history of the I. W. W.\r\nhad either broken away from the organization or simply expired. This\r\ncondition has been characteristic of the I. W. W. in greater or less\r\ndegree throughout its brief career. The \"turnover\" of local unions as\r\nwell as of individual members has been immense and very irregular. No\r\ncontinuous reports of the new locals chartered have appeared in the I.\r\nW. W. press. Weekly reports appeared quite regularly in _The Industrial\r\nUnion Bulletin_ through the spring of 1907 and showed that four or\r\nfive new locals were being chartered each week during the three-months\r\nperiod. There is no record of locals disbanded.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1907, the International Socialist and Labor Congress met\r\nat Stuttgart. Both factors of the I. W. W. were represented: the\r\nSherman faction by Hugo Pick and the DeLeon-St. John faction by Fred\r\nHeslewood. The latter group in its suspiciously optimistic report\r\nclaimed that, \"... starting out with only 2,000 members in 1905, the\r\nWestern Federation of Miners not included, the organization has now 362\r\nindustrial unions and branches organized in 37 States and 3 Provinces\r\nof Canada ... [and] embraces now 28,000 militant workers....\"[325]\r\n\r\nThe Congress devoted considerable attention to the problem of\r\nlabor organization. The discussion of this problem centered almost\r\nexclusively upon two topics: (1) the relations between the political\r\nparty and the trade union, and (2) the defects of the craft union. The\r\nI. W. W., through its representatives, was actively interested in both\r\nof these matters. Its sustained opposition to the craft type of union\r\nis characteristically displayed in the report[326] which the Socialist\r\nLabor party presented to the Congress. It was evidently written by\r\nDeLeon and it may be taken fairly to represent the attitude of the I.\r\nW. W. One paragraph of this report, which puts very comprehensively the\r\nIndustrialist's indictment of the old-line union, reads:\r\n\r\n    The trades-union field [in America] was found by the political\r\n    movement of socialism to be preëmpted by what is called\r\n    craft or pure and simple unionism. This system of unionism\r\n    organizes the crafts, not simply as units but as autonomous\r\n    and sovereign bodies. The fundamental error of this system\r\n    of economic organization was soon found to be desirable by\r\n    the capitalist class. The craft union rendered all economic\r\n    movement fruitless. If indeed the wages in these unions were\r\n    ever found higher than among the unorganized, the price that\r\n    the union paid for such higher wages was to divide the\r\n    working class hopelessly. In the first place, the craft union\r\n    deliberately excluded the majority of the members of the trade\r\n    from participation, by means of apprenticeship regulations,\r\n    high dues, high initiation fees and other devices. In the\r\n    second place, each of these craft unions, in turn, could earn\r\n    its Judas pence only by allying itself with the employer each\r\n    time that some other craft was at war with the employing class.\r\n    It is superfluous to enumerate the long catalogue of deliberate\r\n    acts of treason to the working class at home and abroad, and\r\n    the shocking corruption that such style of unionism was bound\r\n    to breed. Suffice it to say, as proof, that these craft unions\r\n    are found amalgamated with an organization of capitalists,\r\n    known as the \"Civic Federation,\" the purpose of which is to\r\n    establish \"harmonious relations between labor and capital.\"\r\n    These craft unions are mainly organized in the American\r\n    Federation of Labor.[327]\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion of the relations between the political\r\nparties and the trade unions a heated argument took place between\r\nrepresentatives of the I. W. W. (DeLeon faction) and of the Socialist\r\nparty.[328] The Socialist party delegation made a long report in\r\nwhich the I. W. W. was referred to in no complimentary terms. F. W.\r\nHeslewood, representing the I. W. W.,[329] retorted that the report was\r\n\"a tissue of lies and misrepresentations concerning the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World in America.\"[330] He went on to indicate the I. W.\r\nW. conceptions of the Socialist party of America in these terms:\r\n\r\n    This vote-catching machine of which the previous speaker from\r\n    America (A. M. Simons) is so proud, will stoop to anything and\r\n    _go to any length to secure votes_. They have defended a lot\r\n    of scab unions of the A. F. of L. in California, have endorsed\r\n    resolutions condemning the Japanese and asking for their\r\n    exclusion from America, although we find that the Japanese,\r\n    with very little education in revolutionary unionism, make\r\n    better union men than the sacred contract scab of the A. F. of\r\n    L.\r\n\r\n    At the other end of the continent, in New York, they place\r\n    their candidates on the same ticket as Randolph Hearst, a\r\n    Democrat, a trust-buster of the Roosevelt type. I have in my\r\n    hand here a card ... asking the workers to vote for \"Hearst\r\n    and Hillquit.\" \"Hearst and Hillquit\" for good government?\r\n    \"Hearst and Hillquit\" for socialism? No. \"Hearst and Hillquit\"\r\n    for votes! Hillquit, the \"revolutionist,\" one of the leading\r\n    stars at this congress, the chief representative of this\r\n    vote-catching machine: Hillquit, who has fed you on lies\r\n    concerning the Industrial Workers of the World. If this is the\r\n    way to get socialism, I hope that such a damnable brand will\r\n    never be ushered in in my time. What bearing has this criminal\r\n    work on our grand old slogan, \"Workers of the world unite\"?\r\n\r\n    In America we have two kinds of unions, one is known as the\r\n    American Federation of Labor and the other is the Industrial\r\n    Workers of the World. One has a million and a half members\r\n    and the other has over 70,000 members including the Western\r\n    Federation of Miners, that is 40,000 miners and 30,000 directly\r\n    chartered members from the headquarters of the Industrial\r\n    Workers. The larger one is called by the capitalist masters\r\n    and their agents, \"The bulwark of Capitalist Society,\" and the\r\n    chiefs at the head of this scab arrangement were classed by\r\n    Mark Hanna as his \"able lieutenants,\" and that is what they\r\n    are.[331]\r\n\r\nDeLeon and Heslewood endeavored to put through a resolution in\r\ncondemnation of the general position of neutrality taken by Socialist\r\nparties in their relation with labor organizations. They believed that\r\na Socialist party should definitely endorse radical or socialistic\r\ntrade unions and officially frown upon all reactionary unions, and\r\nespecially condemn and discourage reaction wherever it might appear\r\namong labor organizations. \"Neutrality towards trade unions,\" reads\r\ntheir resolution, \"is equivalent to neutrality toward the machinations\r\nof the capitalist class.\"[332]\r\n\r\nThe resolutions on this subject which were finally adopted by the\r\ncongress were much less militant in tone than the I. W. W. statement.\r\nThe prevailing resolution read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    To enfranchise the proletariat completely from the bonds of\r\n    intellectual, political and economic serfdom, the political\r\n    and the economic struggle are alike necessary. If the activity\r\n    of the Socialist party is exercised more particularly in the\r\n    domain of the political struggle of the proletariat, that\r\n    of the unions displays itself in the domain of the economic\r\n    struggle of the workers. The unions and the party have\r\n    therefore an equally important task to perform in the struggle\r\n    for proletarian emancipation. Each of the two organizations has\r\n    its distinct domain defined by its nature, and within whose\r\n    borders it should enjoy independent control of its line of\r\n    action. But there is an ever-widening domain in the proletarian\r\n    struggle of the classes in which they can only reap advantages\r\n    by concerted action and by coöperation between the party and\r\n    the trade unions.[333]\r\n\r\nFurther along in the same resolution the Congress declared that the\r\nunions could not fully perform their duty in the struggle for the\r\nemancipation of the workers unless \"a thoroughly socialist spirit\r\ninspires their policy\" and that it was the duty of the party and\r\nthe unions to render each other \"moral support.\"[334] The editor of\r\nthe official organ, however, looked upon these resolutions as being\r\nvery favorable to the I. W. W., which he declared had forced the\r\nCongress to \"a recognition of the paramount importance of the economic\r\norganization, with the result that the Congress itself stands almost on\r\nI. W. W. ground.\"[335]\r\n\r\nThe 1907 convention was a gathering of the DeLeon-Trautmann-St. John\r\nfaction. At the fourth convention the first hyphen was to be smashed,\r\nbut in 1907 both links held firmly. The general tone was one of\r\nharmony. An attempt was made, however, to reëstablish the office of\r\nPresident. After a long debate on a resolution to this effect the\r\nproposition was defeated. It was decided, however, to establish the\r\noffice of General Organizer, the incumbent of which was expected also\r\nto act as Assistant General Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe original preamble of 1905 had weathered the second convention\r\nwithout being modified. The first lines of the second paragraph read:\r\n\"Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the\r\ntoilers come together _on the political_ as well as on the industrial\r\nfield....\" A motion was made at the third convention to strike out the\r\nwords italicized. It was defeated by vote of 113 to 15.[336]\r\n\r\nThe \"political clause\" of the preamble was the subject of extended\r\ndiscussion.[337] At this time all efforts to alter the preamble were\r\nunsuccessful. The debate was significant, however, in foreshadowing\r\nthe much more serious struggle which was to take place a year later\r\nwhen the I. W. W. was literally split in two over the question of\r\nthe retention or the elimination of the \"political clause.\" Daniel\r\nDeLeon was a member of the Committee on Constitution and made a long\r\nspeech in opposition to the motion to eliminate from the preamble all\r\nreference to the \"political field,\" declaring that \"the position of the\r\nI. W. W. is that when the day [_der Tag_ of the socialists, the day of\r\nthe Revolution] shall come it shall itself project its own political\r\nparty.\"[338] DeLeon was supported in his position by George Speed, who\r\nlater became a member of the General Executive Board of the so-called\r\nanti-political--or Chicago--faction and who has been prominent in the\r\nactivities of the I. W. W. on the Pacific Coast.[339] Delegate E. J.\r\nFoote took the same stand and made a cogent argument for retaining the\r\npolitical clause.\r\n\r\n    [The word] \"political\" [he said] does have a meaning....\r\n    The point is raised that the working class will not have a\r\n    \"government.\" With that I might agree, but they will have an\r\n    industrial administration ... and that administration must be\r\n    political in the sense that it is controlled by the ballot on\r\n    the inside of your own organization.[340]\r\n\r\nThe constitution committee presented a resolution declaring that \"the\r\nI. W. W. seeks its political expression only in its own industrial\r\nadministration.\" This is vague, and it may have been made designedly\r\nso. It might have been brought in to appease those who feared that the\r\nI. W. W. would be made the tail to some political party kite.[341]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[305] Rudolph Katz, \"With DeLeon since '89,\" _Weekly People_, Nov. 20,\r\n1915, p. 2, col. 1.\r\n\r\n[306] _Ibid.

W. W. made the first notable\r\napplication of its principles of revolutionary industrial unionism.\r\nDuring the years 1906 and 1907 Goldfield as the scene of bitter\r\ndisputes between the mine operators on the one hand and the Western\r\nFederation of Miners and the I. W. W. on the other.[342] These disputes\r\nwere caused, chiefly, by a more or less successful effort on the part\r\nof these two local organizations to supplant the traditional craft\r\nunionism in Goldfield by the \"new unionism.\"\r\n\r\nThe Western Federation of Miners was quite strongly entrenched at\r\nGoldfield by the time the I. W. W. made its _début_ in the labor world.\r\nIts local union at Goldfield, No. 220, was an _industrial_ union,\r\nthat is, its membership comprised, as provided for in the W. F. M.\r\nconstitution, \"all persons working in and around the mines, mills and\r\nsmelters....\"[343] Early in 1906 the I. W. W. had a flourishing local\r\n(No. 77) composed of the \"town workers\" of Goldfield. The American\r\nFederation of Labor had almost no foothold in Goldfield at the time,\r\nthe only A. F. of L. locals in the camp being the carpenters' union and\r\nthe typographical union. The I. W. W. local was a more comprehensive\r\norganization even than an industrial union. It was a _mass_ union\r\nwhich aimed to include all the wage-earners in the community. \"We\r\nproceed,\" says an editorial in the I. W. W. official journal, \"without\r\nforce, without intimidation, without deportations and without murder,\r\nto organize all wage workers in the community.... In the organization\r\nwere miners, engineers, clerks, stenographers, teamsters, dishwashers,\r\nwaiters--all sorts of what are called common laborers.\"[344]\r\n\r\nIt was apparently this unconventional type of unionism along with the\r\nvery radical socialistic leanings of both town unionists (I. W. W.,\r\nNo. 77) and the mine unionists (W. F. M., No. 220, affiliated with the\r\nI. W. W.) that brought trouble. The I. W. W. accused the A. F. of L.\r\nunions of beginning it,[345] but the controversy was primarily with the\r\nMine Operators' Association. Vincent St. John, in a letter published\r\nin the same issue of the _Industrial Union Bulletin_, says that the\r\ncarpenters and typos were used \"by the Mine Owners' Association as a\r\nnucleus to colonize the camp against the Western Federation of Miners\r\nand the I. W. W.\" The dispute began in a \"controversy which arose\r\nbetween the _Tonopah Sun_, supported by A. F. of L. locals in the camp\r\nthe one side, and the locals of the Industrial Workers of the World and\r\nthe Western Federation of Miners on the other.\"[346] The _Sun_ attacked\r\nthe I. W. W., whereupon the I. W. W. (including the W. F. M.) boycotted\r\nthe newspaper, and the newsboys, who were organized in the I. W. W.,\r\nrefused to sell it. The _Sun_ then, according to this W. F. M. version\r\nof the affair,[347] sought the services of strike-breakers to scab on\r\nthe newsboys' union, but were unsuccessful. The miners' union (No.\r\n220. W. F. M.) now called a meeting at which they decided\r\n\r\n    that local No. 77, Industrial Workers of the World, which\r\n    comprised all the town workers with the exception of the\r\n    building trades, cease doing business as a local and go\r\n    into local 220 of the Western Federation of Miners ...\r\n    [and thus place] all wage-earners in the camp in No. 220\r\n    with the exception of the newsboys who held a charter from\r\n    the Industrial Workers of the World, and a portion of the\r\n    building trades, who held membership in their international\r\n    organizations.[348]\r\n\r\nSt. John says that this merger was made at the instigation of the Mine\r\nOwners.\r\n\r\n    The plan was finally broached [by them] to consolidate the\r\n    I. W. W. local--cooks, waiters, teamsters, bartenders, and\r\n    clerks--with the W. F. of M. This was looked upon with favor\r\n    by the Mine Owners, as they looked upon the I. W. W. local ...\r\n    as the radical organization of the district, and the miners\r\n    ... were in their opinion more conservative, and they reasoned\r\n    that if the 1,500 miners had a voice and vote on any demands\r\n    made by the 400 radicals--the conservativeness of the 1,500\r\n    miners could blanket the efforts of the 400 radicals. The\r\n    miners, on the other hand, thought they saw an easy, quick and\r\n    satisfactory solution of what promised to be a serious struggle.\r\n\r\nIt was voted on and carried.[349]\r\n\r\nAt first the project was apparently favored by the employing interests\r\nof the district, but they faced about when they saw that the miners'\r\nunion (No. 220) \"practiced solidarity\" and apparently used the\r\ncarpenters' union as their tool. At any rate the miners' union\r\n\"passed a motion that all men working in and around the mines as\r\ncarpenters must become members of the Miners' Union.\" This demand was\r\nignored.[350] The Mine Owners now issued a statement setting forth that\r\nbecause of the \"unreasonable agitation\" by the I. W. W. \"... we hereby\r\npledge ourselves to absolutely refuse to employ any man in any capacity\r\nwho is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, ...\" and \"that\r\nthe Mine Owners will recognize any miners' union, that is independent\r\nof the Industrial Workers of the World....\"[351]\r\n\r\nPressure from the Mine Owners' Association finally brought about a\r\nreferendum on the question of unscrambling. A canvass taken on March\r\n20, 1907, showed a large majority in favor of the miners and the town\r\nworkers meeting separately but continuing in other respects as one\r\nunion.[352] Nevertheless, the situation continued to grow more acute,\r\nand during the spring the I. W. W. and the W. F. M. were involved in a\r\ndesperate struggle for their existence in Goldfield.[353] From March\r\n10, 1907, according to St. John's account of it,\r\n\r\n    until April 22, the W. F. M. and the I. W. W. at Goldfield,\r\n    Nevada, fought for their existence (and the conditions they\r\n    had established at that place) against the combined forces of\r\n    the mine owners, business men, and the A. F. of L. This open\r\n    fight was compromised as a result of the treachery of the W. F.\r\n    M. general officers. The fight was waged intermittently from\r\n    April 22 till September, 1907, and resulted in regaining all\r\n    ground lost through the compromise, and in destroying the scab\r\n    charters issued by the A. F. of L. during the fight. The fight\r\n    cost the employers over $100,000.[354]\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor locals in Goldfield during this\r\nperiod were more or less at the mercy of the I. W. W. and the Western\r\nFederation. It is admitted that A. F. of L. men who were obnoxious to\r\nthe I. W. W.s were handled without gloves. Some A. F. of L. members\r\nwere forced out of town by the more radical unionists who confessed\r\nthat \"they were probably not provided with all the luxuries of modern\r\ncivilization.\"[355] This I. W. W. account of the situation continues:\r\n\r\n    The I. W. W. and the W. F. of M. were on strike for a\r\n    considerable time in Goldfield and had the town thoroughly\r\n    unionized. The bosses, realizing that they were up against\r\n    a rebel class of workers, conferred with their good friends\r\n    and tools, the A. F. of L., and the result was that _the A.\r\n    F. of L. sent their own members into Goldfield to scab on the\r\n    strikers_. This did not happen once, but continuously, and\r\n    the strikers ... did use a little direct action by giving\r\n    the \"union\" scabs orders to the effect that their room was\r\n    preferable to their company.[356]\r\n\r\nIn April it was reported that \"seventy-five per cent of the business\r\nmen of Goldfield have locked out the members of No. 220. They shut down\r\ntheir places of business and told their help they had to join the A.\r\nF. of L. or there would be no work....\"[357] The situation steadily\r\ngrew worse, and finally, in December, Governor Sparks telegraphed to\r\nWashington for Federal troops and they were finally sent.[358] The\r\nGovernor's second telegram to the President (dated Dec. 5. 1907) read\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n    At Goldfield ... there does now exist domestic violence and\r\n    unlawful combinations and conspiracies, ... unlawful dynamiting\r\n    of property, commission of felonies, threats against the lives\r\n    of law-abiding citizens, the unlawful possession of arms and\r\n    ammunition, and the confiscation of dynamite with threats of\r\n    the unlawful use of the same by preconcerted action.[359]\r\n\r\nSoon after the troops were sent President Roosevelt dispatched a\r\nspecial commission[360] to investigate the trouble at Goldfield. The\r\nsalient facts of the situation are set forth by this commission as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    There has existed at Goldfield, which is exclusively a mining\r\n    town of an estimated population of between 15,000 and 20,000\r\n    in South Nevada, for over a year past, and especially since\r\n    the spring of 1907, a disturbed industrial situation, due\r\n    to frequently recurring labor difficulties between the mine\r\n    operators on the one hand and the miners on the other. The two\r\n    sides were represented almost completely by the Goldfield Mine\r\n    Operators' Association, ... on the one hand and by the local\r\n    union of the Western Federation of Miners on the other, a union\r\n    comprising substantially all the miners in Goldfield. This\r\n    union, known as Goldfield Miners' Union No. 220, is a branch\r\n    of the general organization known as the Western Federation of\r\n    Miners. It has carried on its rolls a membership estimated\r\n    at above 3,000 men, which number, however, included members\r\n    of crafts in Goldfield other than workers in and about mines.\r\n    Figures furnished us by the mine operators showed that about\r\n    1,900 mine workers went on a strike on Nov. 27, 1907. Although\r\n    a number of strikes and minor difficulties had occurred during\r\n    1907, the only acute situation arising prior to the call for\r\n    troops existed in the spring of 1907. This controversy involved\r\n    not only a dispute between the mine owners and the miners\r\n    at Goldfield, but also between the members of the miners'\r\n    union and the members of other crafts in Goldfield affiliated\r\n    with the American Federation of Labor. The Goldfield Miners'\r\n    union was also affiliated with the organization known as\r\n    the Industrial Workers of the World, and an effort was made\r\n    to force members of other crafts not affiliated with this\r\n    organization to join its ranks. Not only the Mine Owners'\r\n    Association and members of the miners' union went armed, but\r\n    members of crafts not affiliated with the Industrial Workers\r\n    of the World felt it necessary to carry arms to protect\r\n    themselves while at work. The condition of Goldfield at that\r\n    time was that of an armed camp, and for a time a serious clash\r\n    seemed imminent. The controversy resulted in the murder of a\r\n    restaurant keeper[361] and aroused such opposition against the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World that a ban was practically put\r\n    upon them, and the organization under that name was forced to\r\n    abandon Goldfield. This acute situation disappeared before\r\n    the spring of 1907. A succession of miners' strikes, however,\r\n    had taken place throughout 1907, some of them with apparently\r\n    little justification; and although the operators had yielded to\r\n    nearby all the demands of the union, it seemed impossible to\r\n    secure any settled industrial conditions.\r\n\r\n    The mine operators insist that the socialistic doctrine adopted\r\n    and preached by the Western Federation of Miners practically\r\n    justified the stealing of ore by the miner.... The industrial\r\n    situation was further aggravated by the fact that the Goldfield\r\n    Union would not enter into any contract governing working\r\n    conditions for any specified length of time, and the mine\r\n    operators, therefore, could have no assurance at any time\r\n    that any settlement of a dispute was more than a temporary\r\n    makeshift, nor could they secure any assurance of stable\r\n    industrial conditions for any fixed length of time. Moreover,\r\n    the Goldfield Miners' Union embraces in one single union not\r\n    only the various crafts working in and about the mines, but\r\n    also clerks, waiters, bartenders and other miscellaneous crafts\r\n    and avocations in Goldfield. On Nov. 27, 1907, a strike of the\r\n    miners was inaugurated and is still in effect. This strike grew\r\n    out of a refusal on the part of the miners to accept cashier's\r\n    checks in payment of their wages. The miners insisted upon some\r\n    form of guaranty by the mine operators of whatever paper was\r\n    accepted in lieu of cash. Various propositions were made, but\r\n    no basis of agreement was reached.[362]\r\n\r\nThe commission reported that there was no adequate excuse for the\r\nrequest for Federal troops.\r\n\r\n    The action of the mine operators [said the commissioners]\r\n    warrants the belief that they had determined upon a reduction\r\n    of wages and the refusal of employment to members of the\r\n    Western Federation of Miners, but that they feared to take this\r\n    course of action unless they had the protection of Federal\r\n    troops, and that they accordingly laid a plan to secure such\r\n    troops and then put their program into effect.[363]\r\n\r\nAlthough at the time the I. W. W. and the W. F. M. made common cause,\r\nafter the final separation of the two national bodies the Federation\r\nwas not only critical but bitterly denunciatory. The editor of the\r\nofficial organ of the W. F. M.--J. M. O'Neill--was derisive in his\r\ncomments on the rôle of the I. W. W. at Goldfield. \"The I. W. W. took\r\nroot at Goldfield, Nevada,\" he says, \"and a vast number of the miners\r\nbecame the victims of the sophistry and fell for the propaganda of the\r\nspouting hoodlums.... Other mining camps of Nevada became infected with\r\nI. W. W.-ism....\" But he comes thankfully to the conclusion that \"the\r\nlabor movement of Nevada is slowly recovering from the pestilence of I.\r\nW. W.-ism....\"[364]\r\n\r\nCharges of a very different character were hurled at the I. W. W.\r\nand its Goldfield activities from financial circles in Chicago. It\r\nwas stated that \"detectives have substantiated allegations of a\r\nconspiracy to commit ten murders, a conspiracy formed and fostered\r\nwithin the hierarchy of the I. W. W....\" And that \"leaders of the I.\r\nW. W.... have been using this labor trouble as a lever for stockmarket\r\njobbery....\"[365] This last charge was reiterated in another issue of\r\nthe same paper, in which it was suggested that \"certain stock brokers\r\nwere working hand in glove with the leaders and agitators at the head\r\nof the I. W. W. to break the market....\"[366]\r\n\r\nA member of the I. W. W. now living in Goldfield, and who took part in\r\nthe industrial struggles of 1906 and 1907, sends the following brief\r\ncomment:\r\n\r\n    In September, 1906, at the behest of the mine owners, 220 of\r\n    the W. F. M. took a vote to take the town workers, No. 77\r\n    of the I. W. W., into their fold. It was carried with the\r\n    assistance of the church, and 220 and 77 were amalgamated. The\r\n    first cry on the streets before they even held a meeting was\r\n    that the cooks and waiters were running the miners' meeting;\r\n    then followed the dissensions mapped out by the mine owners,\r\n    the Citizens' Alliance, the stool-pigeons, spies and gum-shoes,\r\n    till the following September the convention expelled the W.\r\n    F. M. for non-payment of per-capita tax and the W. F. M. sent\r\n    organizers of the Sherman faction, but the dual unions did not\r\n    last long, and in fact 220 itself was shaking, till finally it\r\n    went down and the only cry you hear from those whom the powers\r\n    that be cannot control is the one big union, and it is only a\r\n    matter of a short time till the workers get aroused, and then\r\n    there will be something doing.[367]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. and the W. F. M. did win important concessions from the\r\nMine Operators in Goldfield and that, according to officials of the\r\nI. W. W., was the reason why they were so roundly abused. \"The chief\r\ncrime of the I. W. W. in Goldfield,\" said St. John, \"was that they had\r\nsecured the eight-hour day with wages from $3.00 to $5.00 and board for\r\nall restaurant and hotel employees; a ten-hour day with $5.00 wages for\r\nclerks, and an eight-hour day with $6.00 per day for bartenders.\"[368]\r\nMost I. W. W. leaders point to the Goldfield situation in those early\r\ndays as a conspicuous illustration not only of improvements gained in\r\nwage and hours, but also of the possibilities of job control by the\r\nworkers. An I. W. W. who was an active participant in the Goldfield\r\nachievements of the I. W. W. and is now a district organizer on the\r\nPacific Coast, writes:\r\n\r\n    At that time we had job control in many mining camps. At\r\n\r\n    Goldfield, I. W. W. miners received $5.00 for eight hours;\r\n    bakers, $8.00 per eight hours and board; dishwashers, $3.00 per\r\n    eight hours and board. After three years of I. W. W. prosperity\r\n    the Nevada employers, with the aid of the A. F. of L. scabs and\r\n    organizers, conservative Irish-Catholic I. W. W. members(!),\r\n    detectives, spies, state police and Federal troops, broke up\r\n    the I. W. W.[369]\r\n\r\nSt. John also looks back to the Goldfield period as a kind of an I. W.\r\nW. Golden Age. In his historical sketch of the I. W. W., he writes:\r\n\r\n    Under the I. W. W. sway in Goldfield the minimum wage for\r\n    all kinds of labor was $4.50 per day and the eight-hour\r\n    day was universal. The highest point of efficiency for any\r\n    labor organization was reached by the I. W. W. and W. F. M.\r\n    in Goldfield, Nevada. No committees were ever sent to any\r\n    employers. The unions adopted wage scales and regulated hours.\r\n    The secretary posted the same on a bulletin board outside of\r\n    the union hall, and it was the LAW. The employers were forced\r\n    to come and see the union committees.[370]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. member quoted above does not agree with St. John as to\r\nthe cause of the downfall of the I. W. W. in Goldfield. The latter\r\nattributes it to the occurrence of a strike during the financial panic\r\nof 1907.[371]\r\n\r\nOddly enough, these anti-political, direct actionist I. W. W.s figured\r\nrather prominently in Nevada state politics at this time. Among the\r\ncandidates on the Socialist party ticket in 1906 were the following:\r\n\r\n  For Governor, Thos. B. Casey, miner, W. F. M.\r\n\r\n  For State Treasurer, J. W. Smith, waiter, I. W. W.\r\n\r\n  For Register, General Land Office. T. Chambers, laundry worker,\r\n    I. W. W.\r\n\r\n  For Regent, State University, Frank Myrtle, shoemaker,\r\n    I. W. W.[372]\r\n\r\nDespite the success which mass organization met with in Goldfield,\r\nthe I. W. W. was not at that time at all partial to the idea of mass\r\norganization. F. W. Heslewood declared that he was opposed to taking\r\ninto one local union every worker around a town, believing as he did\r\nthat the Goldfield practice was contrary to \"the very fundamental\r\nprinciples of industrial unionism....\"[373] Another member said:\r\n\r\n    I claim that we have left the field of mass organization\r\n    and have got down to the field of industrial integral\r\n    organization. I claim that industrial organization as it shall\r\n    be exemplified by the Industrial Workers of the World is of\r\n    an organic nature.... We recognize that mass organization is\r\n    a thing that is to be abjured when we come into an industrial\r\n    organization.... The difference between a mass organization and\r\n    an industrial organization is that the mass organization is\r\n    destructive ... [whereas the integral] industrial organization\r\n    is constructive. It proposes to recognize the laws to the\r\n    minutest details that environ, govern and control the working\r\n    class.[374]\r\n\r\nThe reality of the sentiment in favor of some modification of the\r\noriginal structural form of the I. W. W. in the direction of a\r\nmore simple or mass form of organization is evidenced by the long\r\ndiscussion on the floor of the convention of a proposal to abolish the\r\ndepartments. Since 1908 the I. W. W. has had a precarious foothold in\r\nGoldfield. The combined effects of the exhausting struggles which\r\nhave been described and the financial panic of 1907 were overwhelming\r\nfor an organization which at the best had little in the way of reserve\r\nresources. \"The strike of the W. F. M. in October, 1907,\" says St.\r\nJohn, \"took place during a panic and destroyed the organization's [_i.\r\ne._, the I. W. W.'s] control in that district.\"[375]\r\n\r\nThere is at this time (1916) a struggling local in Goldfield--Metal\r\nMine Workers' Union No. 353, organized in August, 1914. The author\r\nrecently wrote to the secretary of this local, making inquiries in\r\nregard to the present labor situation in Goldfield and the condition\r\nof the local union. He replied: \"The economic conditions of this camp\r\nforbid the answer of the question you ask.... I trust ... it will not\r\nbe long before 353 can meet openly and above board.\"[376]\r\n\r\nThe organization continued to over-indulge in strikes. It was more or\r\nless involved in the strike of the Electrical Workers of Schenectady\r\nin December, 1906. In 1907 it was involved in the following strikes\r\namong others: textile workers, Skowhegan, Maine, February to April;\r\nsilk workers of Paterson. N. J., March; silk workers of Lancaster, Pa.,\r\nfall of 1907; piano workers of Paterson, N. J., April; the loggers in\r\nEureka, Cal., May, 1907; the saw-mill workers of Portland, Ore.; the\r\nsheet steel workers in Youngstown; the tube-mill workers in Bridgeport,\r\nConn.; the miners in Tonopah, Nevada; the foundry workers in Detroit;\r\nand the smeltermen in Tacoma, Wash., in the summer of 1907. Goldfield,\r\nof course, was the scene of an almost continuous epidemic of strikes\r\nduring the years 1906 and 1907.\r\n\r\nIn his report to the third convention the General Secretary-Treasurer\r\nsays that\r\n\r\n    Not counting the strike and lockout in Goldfield, ... we had\r\n    24 strikes in which approximately 15,500 members participated.\r\n    Most of these strikes lasted two to six weeks, one nine weeks,\r\n    two lasted ten weeks and longer, and the strike of the Tacoma\r\n    smeltermen lasted over six months.... Out of all these strikes\r\n    ... two [those at Tonopah and Detroit] must be considered flat\r\n    failures.... All other strikes ended either in compromise\r\n    or in the complete attainment of what the strikes had been\r\n    inaugurated for.[377]\r\n\r\nThe strikers at Schenectady made use of syndicalistic tactics which\r\nhave been strongly advocated in the I. W. W. literature. \"At two\r\no'clock Monday,\" [December 10] it was reported, \"about 3,000 men\r\nstruck. They did not walk out, but remained at their places, simply\r\nstopping production.\"[378] Reports of this strike from I. W. W. sources\r\ngive the impression that the American Federation of Labor bodies in\r\nSchenectady did much to block the efforts of the I. W. W. It was said\r\nthat on December 12 the local Trades Assembly of the A. F. of L. sent\r\na statement to the press repudiating the I. W. W. and declaring that\r\nthe A. F. of L. was not concerned in the strike and that \"as to any\r\nindividual organization affiliated with the American Federation of\r\nLabor going out on a sympathetic strike, such action would result\r\nin the forfeiture of its charter.\"[379] In both the Bridgeport and\r\nYoungstown strikes, according to St. John, failure resulted from the\r\nalleged obstructive tactics of the American Federation. In both cases\r\nthe loss of the strike is attributed to \"the scabbing tactics of the\r\nA. F. of L.\"[380] The strike of the Portland (Ore.) saw-mill workers\r\nin March and April is worthy of more than passing notice. On the first\r\nof March 3,000 men walked out on strike, for a nine-hour day and an\r\nincrease in wages from $1.75 to $2.50 per day. It is not probable that\r\nany great proportion of these men were members of the I. W. W. at the\r\ntime they went on strike. However, I. W. W. leaders soon came upon the\r\nscene and most of the strikers very soon joined the organization.[381]\r\nThe strike lasted forty days.\r\n\r\n    On account of the exceptional demand for labor ... most of the\r\n    strikers secured employment elsewhere and the strike played out\r\n    at the end of about six weeks. [Nevertheless, the employers]\r\n    were forced indirectly to raise the wages and improve\r\n    conditions [and] ... this strike gave much impetus to I. W. W.\r\n    agitation in the western part of the United States.[382]\r\n\r\nDuring this strike the I. W. W. opened an employment office and a\r\nrestaurant for the benefit of the strikers.[383] The I. W. W. reports\r\nof the duration of the strike and the number of men out may be\r\nexaggerated. John Kenneth Turner, in his \"Story of a New Labor Union,\"\r\nsays \"that more than 2,000 were out for over three weeks.\"[384] The\r\nPortland saw-mill strike really marked the _début_ of the I. W. W.\r\nbefore the public of the Pacific Northwest, and it was something of a\r\nsurprise to the community. The I. W. W. was promptly written up as a\r\nfeature story for the _Oregon Sunday Journal_ by John Kenneth Turner.\r\nThe opening paragraphs of his article read:\r\n\r\n    Portland has just passed through her first strike conducted by\r\n    the Industrial Workers of the World, a new and strange form\r\n    of unionism, which is taking root in every section of the\r\n    United States, especially in the West. The suddenness of the\r\n    strike and the completeness of the tie-up are things quite\r\n    unprecedented in this part of the country. These conditions did\r\n    not merely happen--they came as direct results of the peculiar\r\n    form and philosophy of the movement that brought the strike\r\n    into being. \"If the street-car men had been organized under our\r\n    motto, together with all other A. F. of L. men, the street-car\r\n    strike would have lasted ten minutes,\" says Organizer Fred\r\n    Heslewood. The boast is not an extravagant one. Wherever the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World are organized they can paralyze\r\n    industry at almost the snap of a finger. It is the way they\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    \"Well, you've tied us up. I didn't think you could do it, but\r\n    you did. You're clever; I'll give you credit for that. I didn't\r\n    think any union could close this mill,\" one of the mill owners\r\n    is reported as having said to Organizer Yarrow. \"You yourself\r\n    have taught us all we know,\" replied Yarrow. \"We organize on\r\n    the same plan as you do and we've got you.\"\r\n\r\n    One peculiar feature about the great mill strike was that ...\r\n    there was absolutely no violence, no law-breaking and no crying\r\n    of \"scab.\" Just one man was arrested for trespassing, and he\r\n    imagined that he was standing in a public street. Other strange\r\n    features were the red ribbons, the daily speech-making and the\r\n    labor night and day shifts of organizers who received not a red\r\n    cent for their services.[385]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1907, there were undoubtedly not less than 200 locals\r\nin the I. W. W.[386] Between September, 1906, and September, 1907,\r\none hundred and eighteen charters were issued to local unions,[387]\r\nmaking the total number of locals chartered since the launching of\r\nthe organization not less than nine hundred and twenty-eight. It is\r\nevident that in this period also the \"turnover\" of I. W. W. locals\r\nwas very heavy. There is apparently one report showing the number of\r\nlocals disbanded during this period. The average membership for 1907\r\nwas considerably lower than it was for 1906 and was probably about\r\nsix thousand.[388] The financial condition of the I. W. W. at this\r\ntime was indicated by the report of the Secretary-Treasurer to the\r\nthird convention. For the period from October, 1906, to August, 1907,\r\nreceipts were given as $30,550.75 and disbursements as $31,578.76.[389]\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress had been made in organizing the coal miners.\r\nSecretary Trautmann reported to the third convention that \"fourteen\r\nunions of coal miners were organized in Illinois, four big\r\norganizations in Pennsylvania, three in Texas, two in Kansas, one in\r\nColorado--a total of twenty-four unions with an approximate membership\r\nof 2,000 ...,\" and he went on to the optimistic conclusion that \"the\r\nwedge has been driven into the unholy alliance between operators and\r\nthe United Mine Workers.\"[390] Later on, when the convention was\r\ndiscussing the United Mine Workers and the conditions in the Illinois\r\ncoal mines, Trautmann commented on the remarks made by a delegate of a\r\nUnited Mine Workers' local (No. 1475) which had apparently swung to the\r\nI. W. W. He (Trautmann) said:\r\n\r\n    He represents by a vote of the United Mine Workers an element\r\n    that is today in rebellion against the United Mine Workers of\r\n    America, that element being not only that one local which is\r\n    in rebellion, but three or four or five, and very likely [it]\r\n    ... will be followed by at least one-third of the locals in the\r\n    state of Illinois.[391]\r\n\r\nA few of the problems of policy and internal organization which were\r\ndiscussed at the third convention deserve consideration. Not least\r\nimportant of these was the problem of the Japanese in California. From\r\nthe very first the I. W. W. had taken a definite stand against any and\r\nall discriminations based upon race, color or nationality. Among the\r\nfirst words uttered by Wm. D. Haywood in calling the first I. W. W.\r\nconvention to order were words of criticism of the American Federation\r\nof Labor for its discriminations against Negroes and foreigners. From\r\nthat day to this the organization has been unique in the constancy\r\nand strength of its appeal to and attraction for foreigners. This\r\nparticular phase of the I. W. W.'s activities has been given endless\r\npublicity in connection with the Lawrence and Paterson strikes. At\r\nthe third convention, George Speed, a delegate from California, quite\r\naccurately expressed the sentiment of the organization in regard to the\r\nJapanese question. \"The whole fight against the Japanese,\" he said, \"is\r\nthe fight of the middle class of California, in which they employ the\r\nlabor faker to back it up.\"[392] He added, however, that he considered\r\nit \"practically useless ... under present conditions for the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World to take any steps\" to organize the Japanese.\r\nThis primarily because he felt that the organization had more work on\r\nhand than it could well attend to.[393] _The North American Times_, a\r\ndaily paper published in the Japanese language in Seattle, printed in\r\nthe spring of 1906 an editorial on the I. W. W., which ran in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    To promote the rights and happiness of the workers they have\r\n    the intention to make ... a grand success so that the I. W. W.\r\n    will finally become the most powerful labor organization in the\r\n    world. In the American history of labor there has never been\r\n    such a union that may contain the laborers of every nationality\r\n    in its membership.[394]\r\n\r\nA reaction from an excessive indulgence in strikes, or at least a sign\r\nof the consciousness of this excess, is evident from two resolutions\r\nadopted by the third convention:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that the convention instruct all our organizers to\r\n    discourage strikes and strike talk, and to impress upon those\r\n    whom they are organizing the necessity of realizing that the\r\n    conquest by the workers of the power to retain and enjoy the\r\n    full product of their labor should take precedence in their\r\n    minds of all smaller ameliorations of our conditions.[395]\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that during this, the constructive period of the I.\r\n    W. W., no portion thereof shall enter into any strike, unless\r\n    conducted in an industrial plant which is thoroughly organized\r\n    in the I. W. W....[396]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the general organizing activity of the I. W. W., it was\r\nproposed in one of the resolutions adopted, that the organization\r\nconfine its work for the time being to the smaller cities where the\r\nA. F. of L. was comparatively weak, and in connection with this that\r\nefforts in organization be concentrated for the present on certain\r\nselected industries.[397] Fred Heslewood, member of the General\r\nExecutive Board, in his report to the convention, said:\r\n\r\n    I believe it is an entire waste of money at the present time\r\n    to keep said organizers in cities where the A. F. of L. has\r\n    the workers divided and organized into crafts. We are not\r\n    financially able to tear down this barrier of fakerism at\r\n    present. I do not mean that we should not fight it. I mean that\r\n    we should pay special attention to the lumber industry before\r\n    they [_sic_] are rent into fragments by the American Federation\r\n    of Labor.[398]\r\n\r\nIt was urged that special attention be directed to the mining and\r\nlumber industries and that for the general organizing propaganda\r\none-half of the income of the general administration be devoted to\r\nthe payment of organizers and the printing of literature.[399] The\r\neditor of the official organ of the I. W. W. declared that the third\r\nconvention was\r\n\r\n    free from the sentimentalism and bourgeois reaction which\r\n    characterized the gathering of 1905, and the pure-and-simple,\r\n    destructive tactics of the [1906] assembly; ... [that] it\r\n    marked a distinct advance in an understanding of the philosophy\r\n    and structure of the movement and was a gathering typically\r\n    working-class and loyal ... to the workers....\r\n\r\nand that for these reasons there could be no possible doubt of the\r\nstability of the organization.[400]\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the third convention had adjourned the panic of 1907\r\nstruck the country. The I. W. W. was nearly wiped out of existence.\r\nIts only organ, _The Industrial Union Bulletin_, was obliged first\r\nto appear fortnightly instead of weekly and finally to suspend\r\npublication. \"Its locals dissolved by the dozens and the general\r\nheadquarters at Chicago was only maintained by terrific sacrifice and\r\ndetermination....\"[401] The report of the General Secretary to the\r\nfourth convention explained that when the third convention closed,\r\nGeneral Headquarters expected to collect the moneys due from the local\r\nunions, but before collections could be arranged \"the industrial panic\r\nstruck the country with all its force, and the misery following in the\r\nwake of that collapse was mostly felt in places where the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World had established a stronghold.\" The Secretary\r\nwent on to say that the revenue for December, 1907, was not more\r\nthan half what it had been the year before.[402] To aggravate the\r\nsituation still more were rumors of internal friction between a group\r\nof Socialist Labor party followers of Daniel DeLeon and the rest of the\r\norganization. Indeed, very soon after the convention, charges were made\r\nthat the _Weekly People_, the official organ of the Socialist Labor\r\nparty, was being used against the I. W. W.[403]\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the most serious internal fight in the\r\ncareer of the I. W. W. It was to turn on that same vexed question\r\nthat seems eternally to plague those who want to construct labor\r\norganizations along radical lines--namely, the relationship that\r\nshould exist between the union and the political parties, especially\r\nthe Progressive, Labor and Socialist parties. The second clause of the\r\nPreamble (spoken of among the \"Wobblies\" as \"the political clause\")\r\nheld the seeds of discord in its apparently harmless assertion that\r\nthe class struggle \"must go an until all the toilers come together _on\r\nthe political_ as well as on the industrial field.\" Here we have the\r\nphrase which, at the 1908 convention, was to make the revolutionary\r\nsyndicalists see red and which was finally to result in a bifurcated I.\r\nW.

W. W. had a precarious and for the most part uneventful\r\nexistence. The organization made practically no headway with its\r\nrecruiting and propaganda work. Indeed, it probably lost ground. There\r\nwas a falling off in the number of locals in the organization and, at\r\nleast for 1909, in the number of local union charters issued. Vincent\r\nSt. John, at that time General Organizer, said in his report to the\r\nfourth convention:\r\n\r\n    The big majority of the locals that have disbanded can be\r\n    traced to the inability of the general organization to finance\r\n    the number of organizers needed to see that the membership\r\n    of these locals have a thorough understanding of the aims\r\n    and objects of the I. W. W. before leaving them to their own\r\n    devices. There are several cases where the disbanding of locals\r\n    is the result of the combined opposition of the employers'\r\n    associations and their zealous allies, the officials of\r\n    \"harmony of interests\" organizations which call themselves\r\n    labor organizations for no other purpose than to better\r\n    accomplish their task of deluding the workers.[404]\r\n\r\nIt is probable also that there was during the same period a decline\r\nin membership, as indicated by the figures furnished by the\r\nSecretary-Treasurer.[405] But even during these lean years there was\r\nsome activity in the textile industry. From first to last, so far\r\nas the eastern part of the United States is concerned, it has been\r\namong the textile operatives that the I. W. W. has been most active\r\nand most successful. In this industry the I. W. W. has a much larger\r\nproportion of the total number of organized workers than it has in\r\nany other. In the West, of course, the I. W. W. is most strongly\r\nentrenched in the _unorganized_ extractive industries--lumber,\r\nagriculture, and construction work.[406] In April, 1908, the General\r\nExecutive Board issued an official call (printed in English, French,\r\nGerman and Italian) for that \"First Convention of Textile Workers\"\r\nto be held May 1, 1908, in Paterson, N. J. In his document the claim\r\nis made that \"over 5,000 textile workers have already been organized\r\ninto the Industrial Workers of the World....\"[407] During the eighteen\r\nmonths' period following the financial crisis of 1907 the I. W. W.\r\nalmost entirely gave up its strike activities.[408] Furthermore, the\r\norganization seemed to have secured no permanent foothold in those\r\ncommunities where it had been particularly militant and aggressive\r\nduring the preceding year. Secretary Trautmann admitted this in his\r\nreport to the Fourth Convention. \"There is nothing left in Bridgeport,\"\r\nhe said, \"nothing in Skowhegan, but in the Portland [Oregon] district\r\nthe name of the I. W. W. is cheered and gloried....\"[409]\r\n\r\nOne of the leaders of the Detroit I. W. W. (now the Workers'\r\nInternational Industrial Union) says that at this time \"the whole\r\norganization was in a state of unrest.\"[410] In reference to such a\r\ndistractingly unrestful organization as the I. W. W. has always been,\r\nthis comment is significant. He attributes this unrest to two causes,\r\ninternal dissension and the financial panic.\r\n\r\n    The membership, upon discovering that the officials were\r\n    acting in a manner that foreshadowed ... conflict within the\r\n    organization, withdrew in large numbers. The financial and\r\n    industrial panic which was then on had also a very bad effect\r\n    upon the newly founded local unions of the I. W. W., and many\r\n    of these lost members.[411]\r\n\r\nThe outlook was certainly not encouraging for those who had pinned\r\ntheir faith to the idea of industrial unionism. The prospect for the\r\nnew unionism was not bright. In 1908 the United Brewery Workmen,\r\nanother large and important industrial union, patched up their\r\ndifferences with the American Federation of Labor and went back into\r\nthe craft-union fold. The Western Federation of Miners--the most\r\nmilitant and one of the two or three really powerful unions organized\r\non the industrial plan--had withdrawn, and finally, in May, 1911,\r\njoined the American Federation. At the sixteenth convention of the\r\nWestern Federation, held in the summer of 1908, President Moyer said:\r\n\r\n    I believe it is a well-established fact that industrial\r\n    unionism is by no means popular, and I feel safe in saying\r\n    that it is not wanted by the working class of the United\r\n    States. The Knights of Labor, the American Railway Union, the\r\n    Socialist Trades and Labor Alliance, the Western Labor Union,\r\n    the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees, the American Labor\r\n    Union, and last, the Industrial Workers of the World ... [went\r\n    down] because they failed to receive the support of the working\r\n    class....[412]\r\n\r\nThe breach between the Industrial Workers of the World and the Western\r\nFederation of Miners continued to grow wider. Until April, 1908,\r\nWilliam D. Haywood was a member of both organizations. Even after\r\nthe complete and formal separation had been accomplished, Haywood\r\nhad been, since his acquittal at Boise, serving in the capacity of\r\nlecturer and organizer for the Federation. His views must have been\r\nprofoundly intensified in a more radical direction than ever during\r\nhis incarceration and trial for murder. That his speeches became too\r\nrabid even for such a decidedly militant organization as the Western\r\nFederation of Miners seems unlikely, although the Federation was\r\ngradually growing more conservative. The determining and, in the\r\neyes of the W. F. M., incriminating fact about Haywood now was that\r\nhe remained an I. W. W. after the administration and presumably the\r\nmajority of the W. F. M. had renounced and \"cast off\" the \"larger\"\r\norganization of which it had been a part. So it is not surprising that\r\nthe following should have appeared on the first page of the _Miners'\r\nMagazine_ for April 23, 1908:\r\n\r\n                                NOTICE.\r\n\r\n                        TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\r\n\r\n    This is to inform you that the Executive Board of the Western\r\n    Federation of Miners has decided to terminate the services\r\n    of William D. Haywood as a representative of the Western\r\n    Federation of Miners in the field, the same to take effect on\r\n    the 8th day of April, 1908.\r\n\r\n                       E. MAHONEY, _Vice-Pres., W. F. M._\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Evening Post_ (New York) thinks that but for this\r\nofficial ousting of Haywood by the W. F. M., the I. W. W. might never\r\nhave survived the trouble, dissension and \"hard times\" of 1908. \"It is\r\ndoubtful,\" he says, \"if either faction of the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World [Detroit or Chicago] would have survived but for a change\r\nin the attitude of the Western Miners' Federation ... which left\r\nHaywood free to devote all his energies to the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World.\"[413] If we can credit the evidence presented at the\r\n1912 convention of the W. F. M., the I. W. W. had at least sufficient\r\nvitality to be plotting, through its officials, to regain control of\r\nthe Western Federation. In the published proceedings of its twentieth\r\nconvention is printed a letter, dated August 4, 1908, from Vincent St.\r\nJohn to Albert Ryan, a member of the Western Federation. This letter\r\nreads in part:\r\n\r\n    I believe we could turn in now and lay the wires to defeat the\r\n    machine at the next W. F. M. convention, and it can be done\r\n    in this way: by picking out good reliable men with ability,\r\n    and getting them to place themselves in local unions of the\r\n    Federation for the purpose of getting to be delegates to\r\n    the next convention. To do this they should cultivate the\r\n    sentiment of the membership in the local to which they go. If\r\n    the local is a Moyer local, let them be Moyer men. Let them\r\n    outdo the best of them in worship at his shrine. If the local\r\n    is indifferent, let them be likewise, but let them be elected\r\n    as delegates.... Once we can control the officers of the W. F.\r\n    M. for the I. W. W. the big bulk of the membership will go with\r\n    them, and the prestige of the W. F. M.... is worth something\r\n    to the revolutionary movement, and we should make an attempt\r\n    to get it with us, ... take up the matter with Bechtel and\r\n    Oppman and have them work with you to control Arizona for the\r\n    next convention. Pick out a man or two for every local in the\r\n    state, let them get into them and do the work.... I will try to\r\n    handle Michigan and Minnesota from here. If you are shy [of]\r\n    men, or have any to spare, we can trade with the different\r\n    districts....[414]\r\n\r\nPresident Moyer said that this letter was found among Ryan's effects\r\n\"after he had received a sentence of life imprisonment in San Quentin\r\npenitentiary for having applied direct action in Los Angeles, which\r\nresulted in the death of two men.\"[415] These or similar charges had\r\nevidently been made at about the time this letter was supposed to have\r\nbeen written. St. John, in his report to the fourth I. W. W. Convention\r\nas General Organizer, denied certain \"insinuations of a serious nature\"\r\nwhich had been made against him.[416]\r\n\r\nThe question of \"political action\" and the bitter and disruptive\r\ncontroversy which waged on that subject at the fourth convention had\r\nnow become the overshadowing issue. The \"Wobblies\" use the expression\r\n\"political action\" in referring to almost every conceivable form of\r\npolitical activity, voting, elections, legislation, _etc._, and also,\r\nmore vaguely, in regard to the relationship which does or should\r\nobtain between labor organizations and political parties, particularly\r\nbetween radical labor bodies and radical political parties. For some\r\ntime before this gathering it was evident that the administration was\r\nbecoming fatally divided against itself. The DeLeon-St. John-Trautmann\r\nfaction had survived in 1906, to be _the administration_--the I. W.\r\nW.--but in less than two years the sentiment in the organization had\r\ndeveloped two sub-factions, so to speak. The I. W. W. appears to\r\ndevelop by fission. The organization originally was a compound of\r\nadherents of\r\n\r\n  Sherman      DeLeon      { St. John or }      Trautmann.\r\n                           { Haywood.    }\r\n\r\n                    { Socialist   }  { Anarchist, or }\r\n  Socialist Party.  { Labor Party.}  { _Industrial_  }  Nihilist.\r\n                                     { Socialist.    }\r\n\r\nThe Socialists were \"abandoned\" in 1906, leaving the field to the\r\n\"proletarian rabble\":\r\n\r\n                  DeLeon ... St. John ... Trautmann.\r\n\r\nThe \"Socialist Laborites\" were sloughed off (or they \"ditched the\r\nAnarchists,\" as they themselves would put it) in 1908, and we had\r\n\r\n               I.                               II.\r\n\r\n        The DeLeonites.               The St. John-Trautmann\r\n  (S. L. P. or Detroit I. W. W.)               group.\r\n                                   (Chicago I. W. W., \"Bummery.\")\r\n\r\nLater Trautmann abandoned the \"Bummery\" and joined the DeLeonites. We\r\nnow have in 1917:\r\n\r\n           I.                             II.\r\n\r\n    The DeLeon-Trautmann          The St. John-Haywood\r\n          group.                          group.\r\n  (The Workers' International     (Surely _the_ I. W. W.!)\r\n      Industrial Union.)\r\n\r\nwhich is the present setting, primed for further hyphen-smashing!\r\n\r\nOne of the two factions is thus seen to consist, for the most part, of\r\nmembers of the Socialist Labor party--supporters of the revolutionary\r\nMarxian tradition and believers in political action--the doctrinaire\r\ngroup. Their prophet was Daniel DeLeon. The other group was composed\r\nmore largely of Westerners--intellectually more nearly philosophical\r\nAnarchists than orthodox Socialists--inclined to scoff at political\r\naction and emphatically opposed to allowing the I. W. W. to have\r\nany connection with any political body--or to hold any political\r\npolicy--disbelievers in the state and in both the Socialist parties\r\nbecause they accept the state--\"industrialists with their working\r\nclothes on\"--the essence of the \"proletarian rabble.\" The first group\r\nwas ultimately to constitute a socialistic I. W. W. with headquarters\r\nat Detroit--the doctrinaire wing; the second group an anarchistic I. W.\r\nW. with headquarters at Chicago--the direct-action wing, referred to by\r\nthe Detroiters as \"the Bummery.\"[417]\r\n\r\nRudolph Katz, a member of the Socialist Labor party, writes that after\r\nthe third convention\r\n\r\n    all the efforts of DeLeon to preserve harmony in the I. W.\r\n    W. were unavailing. St. John, Trautmann, Edwards, and the\r\n    majority of the five members of the General Executive Board\r\n    turned over night ... against the fundamental principles of\r\n    industrialism as laid down in the I. W. W. preamble. They no\r\n    longer recognized political action as necessary.[418]\r\n\r\nWhen the convention was called to order by Mr. St. John on September\r\n21, 1908, there were twenty-six delegates in attendance, controlling\r\nan aggregate of seventy votes. Two delegates were debarred from seats\r\nin the convention--Max Ledermann of Chicago and Daniel DeLeon of New\r\nYork--and St. John was made permanent chairman.[419]\r\n\r\nThe West--especially the Pacific Coast--was well represented for the\r\nfirst time. There were delegates in attendance from Seattle, Portland,\r\nLos Angeles, and Spokane. The West was spoken of as furnishing the\r\n\"genuine rebels--the red-blooded working stiffs,\" and this was said to\r\nbe the first revolutionary convention ever held in Chicago composed of\r\n\"purely wage-workers.\"[420] The largest and most important delegation\r\nfrom the West was popularly known as the \"Overalls Brigade,\" brought\r\ntogether in Portland and Spokane by one J. H. Walsh, a national\r\norganizer of the I. W. W. The \"Brigade\" numbered about twenty men who\r\n\"beat their way\" from Portland to Chicago, holding propaganda meetings\r\nen route. A member of the delegation reported this propaganda trip:\r\n\r\n    We were five weeks on the road [he said]. We traveled over two\r\n    thousand five hundred miles. The railroad fare saved would have\r\n    been about $800. We held thirty-one meetings. The receipts\r\n    of the first week from literature sales and collections were\r\n    $39.02. The second week, $53.66. The third week, $45.78. The\r\n    fourth week, $28.10. The fifth week, $8.57. Total, $175.13.\r\n    These figures do not include the song sales. The song sales\r\n    were approximately $200.[421]\r\n\r\nIn the _Industrial Union Bulletin_ for September 19 was published\r\na long letter from Organizer Walsh giving a detailed record of the\r\ntrip. It was given such heads as these \"I. W. W. Red-Special! Overall\r\nBrigade,\"--\"On its way through the continent--Thousands listen to the\r\nspeakers--Gompers and his satellites furious with rage!\" \"The Overall\r\nBrigade,\" according to Rudolph Katz, \"consisted of that element that\r\ntraveled on freight trains from one western town to another, holding\r\nstreet meetings that were opened with the song, 'Hallelujah, I'm a\r\nBum,' and closing with passing the hat in regular Salvation Army\r\nfashion.\"[422]\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Labor party group take the position that DeLeon was\r\ndenied a seat in the convention in order to further the designs of the\r\nSt. John-Trautmann faction. In their \"nefarious plot\" they had the\r\nfull coöperation of the \"Overall Brigade\" which \"sat in judgment upon\r\nDaniel DeLeon.\" Katz goes on to say that \"St. John was the prosecuting\r\nattorney.\"[423] The pretext for unseating DeLeon (and others) was\r\nmembership in the wrong local union. DeLeon was present as a delegate\r\nof the Office Workers' Local Union. His opponents insisted that he\r\nshould, as an editor, be enrolled in the Printing Workers' Local.\r\nOn such technicalities enough delegates were refused seats to give\r\nthe Overall Brigade all the powers of a steam-roller.[424] \"It was\r\na 'machine' of the capitalist political design,\" said the _Weekly\r\nPeople_, \"organized ... among the boys from the West.\"[425] \"In the\r\ncase of Fellow Worker DeLeon representing 'Store & Office Workers'\r\nUnion' No. 58, the committee recommended that the protest be sustained\r\nand the delegate not seated because he is not a member of the local\r\nof the industry in which [he is] working, such a local being in\r\nexistence.\"[426]\r\n\r\n\"The very same fellows,\" writes Katz, \"who dared DeLeon to come to the\r\nFourth Convention, closed the doors to him when he arrived ... and his\r\ncredentials were rejected on flimsy pretenses.\"\r\n\r\n    DeLeon was given the floor to state his case, and he did state\r\n    it in his characteristic fashion. The \"Overall Brigade\" were\r\n    seated all in a row on one side of the hall, a tough-looking\r\n    lot. Vincent St. John was in the chair with sinister mien,\r\n    wielding the gavel and everything that could be wielded to\r\n    keep DeLeon out of the convention. Alongside of St. John sat\r\n    Trautmann, ... [and] he, too, looked as though he had traveled\r\n    all the way from Seattle by freight train.[427]\r\n\r\n\"Such remarks as 'I would like to get a punch at the pope' (meaning\r\nDeLeon) were overheard in the hall among the 'Overall Brigaders'.\"\r\n\"DeLeon told them whither they were drifting--to Shermanism, to\r\nAnarchy, to the movement's destruction.\"[428] DeLeon's speech in\r\ndefense of his right to a seat in the convention was published in the\r\n_Industrial Union Bulletin_ (October 10, 1908) under the title, \"The\r\nIntellectual against the Worker.\" Extracts from St. John's reply and\r\nhis arguments for refusing DeLeon a seat are published in the same\r\nissue of the _Bulletin_ under the title, \"The Worker against the\r\nIntellectual.\" Katz says that this published version of DeLeon's speech\r\nwas full of \"the basest kind of misrepresentation.\" He further declares\r\nthat the reports of the convention published in the _Bulletin_ were\r\n\"doctored.\"[429]\r\n\r\nDeLeon expressed his opinion of the \"Overall Brigade\" very soon after\r\nthe convention:\r\n\r\n    Out of this [hobo] element [he declared] Walsh picked ... the\r\n    \"Overall Brigade\"; and to the tune \"I'm a bum, I'm a bum,\" very\r\n    much like the tune of \"God wills it! God wills it!\" with which\r\n    Cuckoo Peter led the first mob of Crusaders against the Turks,\r\n    Walsh brought this \"Brigade\" to the convention. Some of them\r\n    ... were among the \"delegates.\" Most of them, I am credibly\r\n    informed, slept on the benches on the Lake Front, and received\r\n    from Walsh a daily stipend of 30 cents. This element lined the\r\n    walls of the convention.[430]\r\n\r\nFor four days the convention did practically nothing but protest\r\ncredentials and debate the question whether or not the Socialist Labor\r\nparty, through Daniel DeLeon, was trying to control the I. W. W. All\r\nthis was a prelude to the contest over the retention of the political\r\nclause of the preamble which was fought out on a personal issue--the\r\nadmission of DeLeon as a delegate. The DeLeonites accused the St.\r\nJohn-Trautmann group of trying to make the I. W. W. what they called a\r\n\"purely physical force body.\"[431] The DeLeonites in turn were charged\r\nwith attempting to subordinate the interests of the I. W. W. to those\r\nof the Socialist Labor party.\r\n\r\nJustus Ebert, himself a member of the Socialist Labor party, believed\r\nthat this charge was well founded. For this reason, in 1908, and\r\nsome time before the fourth convention met, he resigned from the\r\nSocialist Labor party. Since that time he has been a member of the\r\n(\"Anarcho-Syndicalist\") I. W. W. His letter of resignation, addressed\r\nto the members of Section Kings County, S. L. P., runs in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    The Socialist Labor party believes that the political is the\r\n    reflection of the economic. With this belief in mind it aided\r\n    in launching the I. W. W., and protected it from the onslaughts\r\n    of reaction.... The Socialist Labor party has not, however,\r\n    had the courage of its convictions, ... [because] having aided\r\n    in founding and protecting the economic organization that is\r\n    to reflect the true political party of labor, [it] refuses to\r\n    vacate the field to its untrammeled and logical development.\r\n    Instead, it persists in being the political guide and mentor\r\n    of the I. W. W.... The I. W. W., hampered in its growth by the\r\n    illogical posture of the S. L. P., is compelled to serve notice\r\n    in big black type that it has no political affiliations of any\r\n    kind.... The fate of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance\r\n    will be the fate of the I. W. W., if it permits an external\r\n    political body to dominate its politics.[432]\r\n\r\nNow DeLeon was at once the leader of the S. L. P. and of the political\r\nelement in the I. W. W., and the anti-parliamentarians perhaps felt\r\nthat the only way to get rid of what they called the \"political\r\nincubus of the S. L. P.\" was to eliminate DeLeon and enough of his\r\nsupporters to make it possible for the Wobblies from the West to carry\r\nthe resolution to eliminate that fearsome political clause. They were\r\nsomehow vaguely apprehensive that that phrase in the preamble which\r\ndeclared that the toilers must \"come together on the political field\"\r\nwould make possible the subjugation of the I. W. W. by the Socialist\r\nLabor party. This despite the fact that the paragraph in question\r\ncloses with the words: \"without affiliation with any political party.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the General Secretary-Treasurer expresses the position of\r\nthe simon-pure industrialists of the St. John-Trautmann faction.\r\n\r\n    Shall the economic organization [the Secretary asks] be\r\n    permitted to outline and pursue its course in the efforts\r\n    [_sic_] to bring the workers together on the industrial field,\r\n    the only essential, and, if necessary, on the political [field]\r\n    without the interference and self-assumed guardianship of\r\n    any political party,... or shall the economic organization,\r\n    the Industrial Workers of the World, be turned into a tail\r\n    of a political party and its functionaries and its officers\r\n    be obedient to the commands and the whims emanating from the\r\n    emissaries of such political party?[433]\r\n\r\nOne member of the anti-parliamentarian group--F. W.\r\nHeslewood--expressed his opposition to any change in the preamble,\r\nsaying that he did not want to be called a dynamiter. He insisted\r\nthat \"the changing of the preamble by taking out the word 'political'\r\nwill inevitably give somebody a chance to denounce the I. W. W. as an\r\nanarchist organization.\"[434] The I. W. W. was precisely so denounced\r\nsoon after the convention: \"The political clause has been stricken out\r\nand with that all semblance of the I. W. W. has been wiped out. The\r\nclause was considered 'confusing.' Fact is the clause was so clear that\r\nit was a thorn in the side of veiled dynamiters.\"[435]\r\n\r\nThe proposition to strike out the seductive and dangerous words about\r\nthe \"political field\" was adopted and the second paragraph of the new\r\npreamble now reads: \"Between these two classes a struggle must go on\r\nuntil the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession\r\nof the earth and the machinery of production and abolish the wage\r\nsystem.\"[436]\r\n\r\nThe \"straight industrialists\" had now accomplished their _coup_.\r\nBy \"killing\" the political clause they had, presumably, saved the\r\norganization from the insidious peril of Socialist Labor party\r\ndomination; briefly, they had exorcised the demon of DeLeonism. This\r\nwas the sentiment of the Trautmann-St. John faction. The sentiments of\r\nthe DeLeonites are officially expressed in a leaflet issued later on\r\nby the new but \"only genuine and original I. W. W.\" organization which\r\nthey proceeded to establish at Detroit:\r\n\r\n    At the fourth annual convention in September, 1908, [it runs]\r\n    \"certain prominent members of the organization, some of them\r\n    being officials, endeavored to capture the organization\r\n    and make of it a purely physical force body. Through their\r\n    machinations they seated delegates not entitled to a seat, and\r\n    unseated delegates entitled to a seat, threatening violence\r\n    to, and committing [it] upon, _bona fide_ delegates assembled\r\n    there. The general officers acquiesced in, and endorsed,\r\n    the actions of the irresponsible element that packed the\r\n    convention against the organization. The delegates who were\r\n    illegally debarred from a seat in the convention returned to\r\n    their respective union constituencies and reported the actions\r\n    of the anarchistic crew who were conducting the so-called\r\n    convention.\"[437]\r\n\r\nThe fourth convention did very little of importance except to split\r\nthe organization very decisively, if discursively, on the rock of\r\n\"politics.\" A few unimportant constitutional changes were made[438] and\r\nthe following officers elected: General Secretary-Treasurer, Vincent\r\nSt. John; General Organizer, Wm. E. Trautmann; General Executive\r\nBoard, Fellow Workers Cole, Miller, Ettor, Whitehead and Gains.[439]\r\nThe records and property of the organization remained with the St.\r\nJohn-Trautmann faction,[440] which will be referred to in the following\r\npages as the Industrial Workers of the World, or simply by the three\r\nletters, \"I. W. W.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not the St. John contingent was now legitimately entitled\r\nto be recognized as the Industrial Workers of the World is a question\r\nwhich will be discussed in another place. Whether they were usurpers\r\nor not, they held and retained control of the offices and property of\r\nthe organization. The Socialist Labor or DeLeon contingent faced the\r\nsituation as best they could. These \"_bona fide_ industrial unionists\r\nrallied,\" says one of their number, \"and held a convention in Paterson,\r\nN. J., and elected a new set of general officers and a new General\r\nExecutive Board.\"[441]\r\n\r\n    On November 5, 1908, [reads an official announcement] a\r\n    conference assembled in Paterson, N. J., of delegates sent\r\n    by the locals that remained true to the principles of the\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World. They attended to the\r\n    interrupted work of the general organization, electing a\r\n    General Executive Board and other officials, and attended to\r\n    such other work as the organization required for its growth and\r\n    progress.[442]\r\n\r\nAt this rump convention, \"credentials were read for twenty-one\r\ndelegates from locals of Philadelphia, Boston, Bridgeport, Brooklyn,\r\nand Paterson, of which [number] eighteen were present....\"[443] This\r\nPaterson conference was virtually a meeting of the two District\r\nCouncils of New York City and Paterson and a handful of Eastern\r\nlocals. The delegates declared the proceedings of the Chicago\r\nconvention illegal and naïvely read the \"anarchist usurpers\" out of\r\nthe organization. \"The pirates in Chicago,\" says Rudolph Katz in his\r\nlater reminiscences, \"were repudiated by the I. W. W. organizations\r\ngenerally.\" He adds that only three issues of the _Industrial Union\r\nBulletin_ (official organ of the St. John faction) appeared \"after that\r\npacked 'convention' had done its deadly work.\"[444]\r\n\r\nThe most important action of the convention was to reduce the monthly\r\nper-capita to five cents for locals and three cents to National\r\nIndustrial Departments and National Industrial Unions, the idea\r\nbeing that the money should be controlled locally for organization\r\npurposes.[445] Steps were taken toward the publication of an official\r\njournal, temporary officials were elected to form a kind of _ad\r\ninterim_ administration, and New York City was decided upon for the\r\nlocation of General Headquarters.[446] Within a few months, however,\r\nthe location of national headquarters was changed to Detroit, Michigan.\r\nThe Daily and Weekly _People_ served as official journal for the\r\nDetroit organization until January, 1912, when the first number of the\r\n(monthly) _Industrial Union News_ made its appearance. C. H. Chase (New\r\nYork) was General Secretary-Treasurer. The Executive Board consisted of\r\nC. H. Chase, A. J. Francis (New York), Wm. Glanz (Paterson), R. McClure\r\n(Philadelphia), C. E. Trainor (Denver), and H. Richter (Detroit).\r\nRichter is at present General Secretary-Treasurer. He was a delegate to\r\nthe 1905 convention from one of the local unions of the Socialist Trade\r\nand Labor Alliance.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly doubtful whether the \"pirates in Chicago\" were really\r\n\"repudiated by the I. W. W. organizations generally.\" The figures\r\npresented in Appendix IV, (Table A) indicated that a large proportion\r\nof the 200 locals (to take the lowest estimate) in the I. W. W. in 1907\r\nhad in some way vanished. The Chicago faction admitted that 17 locals\r\nwent over to Detroit,[447] and Secretary Richter writes that when the\r\nDetroit faction was reorganized at Paterson twenty-two locals reported\r\nto headquarters.[448] During the months of November and December,\r\n1908, the _Weekly People_ published in its correspondence columns\r\nabout a dozen letters from locals--chiefly Eastern locals--which\r\nexpressly repudiated the \"Chicago pirates.\" Both organizations sent\r\nout official referendum sheets for the votes of the rank and file of\r\nthe membership on the resolutions, _etc._, adopted by the Chicago and\r\nPaterson conventions.[449] The writer has not learned of any definite\r\nreports concerning the returns from these referendums. It is quite\r\ncertain that the Chicago group lost many locals which did not go over\r\nto Detroit, inasmuch as only 100 locals are reported for 1909.[450]\r\nSecretary Richter reports that in 1909 the Detroit I. W. W. had\r\ntwenty-three locals.[451]\r\n\r\nNow, as to the merits of the controversy. The I. W. W. set out in\r\n1905, somewhat on the order of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance,\r\nproposing to wage war on the capitalist, primarily on the \"economic\r\nfield,\" _viz._, in the shop, \"on the job\"; by strikes and boycotts,\r\n_etc._, but expecting to go forward, as DeLeon put it, \"under the\r\nprotecting guns of a labor political party.\" No particular party was\r\nendorsed, however, and any desire for the endorsement of any political\r\nparty was specifically disclaimed. The words, \"without endorsing\r\nor desiring the endorsement of any political party,\" were inserted\r\nat the close of the preamble in 1906, but stricken out in 1908 (or\r\npossibly 1907). The Detroit I. W. W. at first carried in its preamble\r\nthe words, \"without endorsing any political party,\" but later struck\r\nthem out.[452] The western membership was especially bitter in its\r\nhostility to the Socialist party as well as the Socialist Labor party,\r\nand felt convinced that the I. W. W. was mortgaging its future in\r\nallowing itself to get into any entangling political alliances, formal\r\nor informal. The western I. W. W.s had not borrowed any theoretical\r\ncriticism of the state from the French syndicalists, but the actual\r\nconcrete experiences of the lower grades of workers in the western\r\nstates had developed in their minds a conception of the political party\r\n(reactionary or socialistic) very similar to that of the revolutionary\r\nsyndicalists of France.\r\n\r\nFélicien Challaye, one of the intellectuals among the French\r\nsyndicalists, expresses this common idea very concisely. He says that,\r\n\"... le parti politique est un agrégat d'éléments hétérogènes, réunis\r\npar le lieu artificiel d'une opinion analogue: des hommes venus de\r\ntoutes les couches sociales s'y condoient, échangent leurs obscurs et\r\nstériles bavardages, cherchent à associer par de louches compromis\r\nleurs intérêts antagonistes.\"[453]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Western American Wobblies looked upon the whole modern\r\nsystem of congressional or parliamentary government in much the same\r\nway. Parliaments, they say, are little more than clearing-houses for\r\nthe exchange of \"vague and sterile platitudes.\" In so far as they do\r\nmore than this, they merely further the designs of the big business\r\ngroups whom they serve as retainers. In this regard the I. W. W.s\r\nare sufficiently Marxian and they would accent with italics Marx's\r\nstrictures on the \"disease of parliamentarism.\" The Industrial Workers'\r\n_feeling_ toward parliamentary government cannot be better described\r\nthat in the words of the great Socialist. In a letter written to the\r\n_New York Tribune_ in 1852 Karl Marx describes\r\n\r\n    that incurable malady, _parliamentary crétinism_, [as] a\r\n    disorder which penetrates its unfortunate victims with the\r\n    solemn conviction that the whole world, its history, and\r\n    future, are governed and determined by a majority of votes in\r\n    that particular representative body which has the honor to\r\n    count them among its members and that all and everything going\r\n    on outside the walls of their house--wars, revolutions, railway\r\n    constructing, colonizing of whole new continents, California\r\n    gold discoveries, Central American canals, Russian armies,\r\n    and whatever else may have some little claim to influence\r\n    upon the destinies of mankind--is nothing compared with the\r\n    incommensurable events hinging upon the important question,\r\n    whatever it may be, just at that moment occupying the\r\n    attention of their honorable house.[454]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. makes the bald accusation that the political groups which\r\nmake up national congresses are simply (though perhaps indirectly and\r\nadroitly) managing public affairs in behalf of the dominant economic\r\nand commercial interests of the country. To whatever degree this is\r\ntrue the I. W. W. is sure of its ground in declaring that parliaments\r\nare corrupt. But this no more demonstrates the inherent folly of\r\nparliamentary government than the admitted corruption--perhaps even\r\n_industrial crétinism_--of the industrial union proves the inherent\r\nfolly of industrial unionism. There is a lamentable amount of inherited\r\nidiocy in both labor and legislative organizations. Anything in the\r\nconstitution, and more particularly anything in the preamble (which I.\r\nW. W.s looked upon as a Magna Carta of the proletariat), that seemed\r\nto commit the organization to any particular _political_ policy was a\r\nsource of great uneasiness. This uneasiness was much intensified by\r\nthe constantly increasing sentiment of opposition to the (political)\r\nstate as it exists today, and to all forms of authority, especially\r\ncentralized authority.[455] The \"Overall Brigade\" was the group which\r\nwas most conspicuously saturated with this anarchistic feeling. These\r\nmen from the West were suspicious of all parties; thought voting and\r\nlegislating pleasant forms of ritual for deluding the workers; actively\r\nantagonized the craft unions, which also they considered industrial\r\nanomalies of use only as \"coffin societies\"; and were very doubtful\r\nabout the necessity for leaders of any kind--even leaders of the\r\nWobblies!\r\n\r\nThe eastern membership, on the other hand, more nearly approximated\r\nthe State Socialist type of radicalism. They were inspired by a\r\ngroup of Socialist Labor party men at whose head was Daniel DeLeon.\r\nThey abjured anarchy, believed in authority (and in its instruments:\r\nleaders), were disillusioned about State Socialism and spared no\r\nbitterness and pettiness in criticizing the Socialist party and its\r\nprogram of State Socialism and reform in general. Reform in general was\r\nto them anathema. They were revolutionary Marxists--doctrinaire to the\r\nbone--saturated with the dialectic.\r\n\r\nThis doctrinaire faction claimed to be the custodian of the original I.\r\nW. W. idea. It felt itself to be the keeper of the original tradition\r\nof the founders. This original tradition was expressed in the first\r\npreamble if it was expressed anywhere. The DeLeonites held to that\r\noriginal preamble, and the fact that they did so lends weight to their\r\nclaim that they, and they alone, are the true exponents of the spirit\r\nand purpose which animated the first convention. They probably do\r\nrepresent the spirit of the fathers--the men of 1905--more exactly than\r\ndoes the \"Bummery outfit\" at Chicago. The Direct-Actionists might just\r\nas well concede this much to the \"Impossibilists.\" The latter represent\r\nrevolutionary unionism in the original bottle; the former represent the\r\nchanged form of militant unionism toward which most of the I. W. W.s\r\nhad drifted between 1905 and 1908--new red wine under the old label.\r\nThe Direct-Actionists kept the old label to designate the Western\r\nAmerican brand of \"industrial unionism,\" invented (or blundered upon)\r\nby the proletarian from the provincial side of the Mississippi, simply\r\nbecause they had the _power_ to keep it. And the whole philosophy of\r\nthe so-called \"Bummery outfit\" is the philosophy of power--economic\r\npower.\r\n\r\nA further reason for conceding to the Direct-Actionists the original\r\nname and label (as indeed the Detroiters wisely did when in 1915 they\r\nrechristened themselves \"The Workers' International Industrial Union\")\r\nis that the Direct-Actionists are the ones who, since 1908, have done\r\nby far the most extensive organizing and propaganda work. It was the\r\n\"Bummery\" which aroused hope and apprehension at Little Falls, at\r\nLawrence, at Wheatland, and on the Minnesota iron range, and baffled\r\nthe authorities in its dramatic \"free speech fights\" at Spokane,\r\nFresno, Paterson, San Diego, Seattle, and Everett. Their membership,\r\nthough small, is three times that of the Detroit organization.\r\n\r\nSome more definite points of difference between the two organizations\r\nshould be noted. They may be set down here as representing the\r\ncontrasting viewpoints of Daniel DeLeon and Vincent St. John. The\r\nattitude of these two men can be tentatively accepted as representing\r\nthe opinions of most of those in their respective followings. There is\r\ngood reason, then, for saying that the lifting of the hyphen between\r\nDeLeon and St. John was largely due to their conflicting opinions about\r\n(1) industrial union structure--the _arrangement_ of industrial groups;\r\n(2) sabotage and direct action; and (3) political action.\r\n\r\n(1) DeLeon believed that the workers should be grouped in the local\r\nindustrial union according to the _product_ turned out but that within\r\nthe local union the lines of demarcation for segregating trade or\r\nshop branches must be drawn with reference to the particular _tool_\r\nused.[456] St. John believed that _production_ should be the criterion\r\nthroughout, with all workers whose activities contribute toward the\r\noutput of a given _product_ enrolled in the same union. The driver of\r\na brewery wagon contributes his labor power to the production of beer\r\n(as also does the stenographer in the office of the brewery!) and he\r\nshould be in the Brewery Workers' Union, as indeed he actually is in\r\nthis particular case.\r\n\r\n(2) Direct action and sabotage were condemned by DeLeon and approved\r\nby St. John. DeLeon's opposition was not based upon moral grounds.\r\nHe simply had no confidence in the efficacy of these methods. He was\r\nfirmly convinced that the habitual indulgence in sabotage and in\r\ndestructive tactics in general was a poor preparation for a working\r\nclass which expected some day to manage and control the industries of\r\nthe world. It was a poor educational policy.\r\n\r\n(3) St. John was unconditionally opposed to political action. DeLeon\r\nadvocated it as a temporary aid in the struggle for emancipation. He\r\nappears to have looked forward to the ultimate abolition of political\r\nor representative government and the establishment of a literal\r\nindustrial democracy.[457]\r\n\r\nThe _constitution_ of the I. W. W. is not anti-political. It is merely\r\n_non_-political. Any wage-earner is admitted regardless of creed, race\r\nor political opinion. But it is also true that in actual practice, as\r\nLevine remarks, \"the Industrial Workers have played and are playing the\r\ngame of antipolitics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their spokesmen,\" he says, \"ridicule the 'politicians'; severely\r\ncriticized the Socialist party and insult its most prominent leaders.\r\nThe non-political portion of the I. W. W. is therefore practically\r\nanti-political.\"[458]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of feeling engendered in this controversy over politics\r\ncan well be imagined. The two factions of the I. W. W. hate one another\r\nwith a hearty fervor that is only equaled by their united opposition\r\nto the American Federation of Labor. Both claim to be the simon-pure\r\nrevolutionary article. If any \"malefactor of great wealth\" thinks that\r\nhe is being scandalously abused by the I. W. W.s, he should read some\r\nof the things the \"red I. W. W.s\" have to say about the \"yellow I. W.\r\nW.s\" and, _a fortiori_, the \"yellows\" about the \"reds,\" or attend a\r\ndebate between any kind of an I. W. W. and what he (the I. W. W.) calls\r\na \"coffin society\" man of the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Detroit I. W. W. (now W. I. I. U.) says that\r\n\r\n    to speak of factions of the I. W. W. is doing violence to the\r\n    facts in the case. The I. W. W. organized in Chicago, 1905,\r\n    established certain principles, methods, and aims, which can\r\n    be readily ascertained from the stenographic reports of the\r\n    first, second, and third conventions. Among them one of the\r\n    most essential and characteristic of the I. W. W. is the\r\n    distinct and specific declaration: The workers must organize\r\n    as a class, on the political and industrial field, to achieve\r\n    the emancipation from wage slavery. The so-called Chicago \"I.\r\n    W. W.\" has repudiated this position, and carries since 1908,\r\n    falsely, the name. Its claim is bogus, as amply demonstrated by\r\n    its doings since that time....[459]\r\n\r\n\"We hold,\" says this official, \"that our organization is _The_ I. W.\r\nW. Chicago headquarters, and those who follow that organization, became\r\na different body since 1908.\"[460]\r\n\r\nAt the International Socialist Congress at Vienna in 1914 the Socialist\r\nLabor party made a report in which it was declared that\r\n\r\n    ... the Anarcho-Syndicalist element [which] caused the split in\r\n    the I. W. W. in 1908, went forth throughout the land under the\r\n    name, Industrial Workers of the World, and by its advocacy of\r\n    Anarchy, sensationalism, sabotage, \"direct action,\" and \"free\r\n    speech,\" riots, and similar disorderly tactics, has cast an\r\n    odium upon the name of the I. W. W.[461]\r\n\r\nSuch a characterization of the Chicago faction is hardly to be wondered\r\nat in view of some of the statements made by organs representing the\r\ndirect-actionists. Thus we are told that what \"the now famous 'Hobo\r\nConvention' ... actually did was to restore the preamble to its\r\npristine syndicalist purity....\"[462]\r\n\r\nThe break was not, however, entirely caused by disagreement over\r\npolitical and economic principles. It was partly a matter of personal\r\ntemperament--and primarily the personal temperament of Daniel DeLeon.\r\nWe have seen that, rightly or wrongly, DeLeon has been, time after\r\ntime charged with being the instigator of trouble and dissension.\r\nIt's difficult to say just why his presence so often seemed to bring\r\nfriction and revolt. It was partly due, no doubt, to the really heroic\r\nand rigidly uncompromising way in which he adhered to his beliefs.\r\nIt must be attributed in part, the writer believes, to defects of\r\ntemper. \"The strain of love and hate aroused by DeLeon's peculiar\r\npersonality,\" writes one who knew him, \"colors all judgments of his\r\ncareer.\"[463] The same writer says that DeLeon was temperamentally a\r\nJesuit, and that his personal attacks were Jesuitical.[464] This fact\r\nsurely should be kept in mind when considering the controversies in\r\nthe socialist movement which have been laid at his door. The present\r\nSocialist party broke away from DeLeon's leadership nearly twenty years\r\nago,[465] and has since thrived, while the Socialist Labor party has\r\nbeen reduced to a negligible quantity. In the same way, in 1908, the\r\nfollowers of DeLeon seceded and their fate has been about the same.\r\n\r\nEugene Debs thought that DeLeon's critics made too little allowance\r\nfor his peculiar temper. He insists that whatever \"opposition to the\r\nIndustrial Workers [is] inspired by hatred for Daniel DeLeon and the\r\nSocialist Trade and Labor Alliance, is puerile, to say the least....\r\nDeLeon is sound on the question of trade unionism,\" Debs continues,\r\n\"and to that extent, whether I like him or not personally, I am with\r\nhim.\"[466] In another place Debs writes:\r\n\r\n    The fact is that most of the violent opposition of Socialist\r\n    party members to the I. W. W. is centered upon the head of\r\n    DeLeon and has a purely personal animus.... DeLeon is not the\r\n    I. W. W., although I must give him credit for being, since its\r\n    inception, one of its most vigorous and active supporters.\r\n\r\nIt may be [he continues] that DeLeon has designs upon the Socialist\r\nparty and expects to use the I. W. W. as a means of disrupting it in\r\nthe interest of the Socialist Labor party, and if he succeeds it will\r\nbe because his enemies in the Socialist party, in their bitter personal\r\nhostility to him, are led to oppose ... the revolutionary I. W. W. and\r\nsupport the reactionary A. F. of L....[467]\r\n\r\n    DeLeon's name was synonymous with revolutionary socialism--that\r\n    socialism which rejects compromise, recognizes the social\r\n    value of reform but refuses to deal in reform, and considers\r\n    revolutionary industrial unionism as the indispensable basis\r\n    of socialist political action and the revolutionary movement\r\n    as a whole. DeLeon saw clearly the impending menace of State\r\n    Socialism, particularly within the Socialist movement: and his\r\n    whole program was an answer to that menace.... Nearly every\r\n    American expression of revolutionary theory and action bears\r\n    the impress of his personality and activity; and revolutionary\r\n    unionism hails him as its philosopher and foremost American\r\n    pioneer.[468] ... DeLeon's espousal of Industrial Unionism and\r\n    the I. W. W. and his development of an industrial philosophy\r\n    of action, constitute his crowning contribution to American\r\n    socialism.[469]\r\n\r\nDeLeon's personal character and intellectual leanings were curiously\r\nreflected in the party to which he so unselfishly gave the best years\r\nof his life. The Socialist Labor party is doctrinaire, unyielding,\r\nJesuitical as was its leader. It has always seemed to be suspended\r\nafter a fashion in an atmosphere charged with a kind of a pedantic\r\nessence of the Marxian dialectic. It is so impressed with the\r\nimportance of its own \"mutterings in the Marxian law,\" that when, for\r\nexample, one of Fellow Worker Walsh's \"blanket stiffs\" asks what the\r\nwestern lumberjack is to do when he is \"fleeced\" for a three-day job,\r\nthe party, metaphorically speaking, simply loses its temper and rails\r\nat him and all the rest of the \"Overalls Brigade.\" The Socialist Labor\r\nparty has been pretty accurately summed up by Fraina:\r\n\r\n    The S. L. P. ignored the psychology of struggling workers [he\r\n    says]. Its propaganda was couched in abstract formulas; just as\r\n    its sectarian spirit developed a sort of subconscious idea that\r\n    revolutionary activity consisted in enunciating formulas. This\r\n    sectarian spirit produced dogmas, intemperate assertions, and a\r\n    general tendency toward caricature ideas and caricature action;\r\n    and discouraged men of ability from joining the S. L. P.[470]\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this book was published some references\r\nto DeLeon have appeared in the dispatches from Russia. Robert Minor,\r\nin an interview with Nikolai Lenin, quotes him as declaring that\r\n\"the American Daniel DeLeon, first formulated the idea of a soviet\r\ngovernment, which grew up in Russia on his, DeLeon's idea.\" In the\r\nsame interview Lenin is further quoted as saying: \"Future society will\r\nbe organized along soviet lines. There will be soviet [occupational]\r\nrather than geographical boundaries for nations. Industrial unionism is\r\nthe basic state....\"[471]\r\n\r\nAdditional light on the relation between Bolshevism and I.W.W-ism as\r\nconceived by Lenin appears from the following account given by Arthur\r\nRansome:\r\n\r\nLenin said he had read in an English socialist paper a comparison of\r\nhis own theories with those of ... DeLeon. He\r\n\r\n    had then borrowed some of DeLeon's pamphlets from Reinstein\r\n    (who belongs to the [Socialist Labor] party which DeLeon\r\n    founded in America), read them for the first time, and was\r\n    amazed to see how far and how early DeLeon had pursued the\r\n    same train of thought as the Russians. His theory that\r\n    representation should be by industries, not by areas, was\r\n    already the germ of the soviet system.... Some days afterwards\r\n    I noticed that Lenin had introduced a few phrases of DeLeon's\r\n    ... into the draft for the new program of the Communist\r\n    [Bolshevik] party.[472]\r\n\r\nFinally, mention should be made of the fact that the National Labor\r\nCommittee of the Socialist Labor party has just published a memorial\r\nvolume on DeLeon. It is written by a group of his friends and\r\nco-workers in the Socialist Labor party.[473]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[404] _Industrial Union Bulletin_.

Whatever merit there may be in the above comparison is due\r\nto him. On the second point, however, Mr. Kern simply states that the\r\ndifference was merely a difference of views in regard to _stealing_.\r\nSt. John, he says, approved of it. (Not per se, of course, but because,\r\nas he assumed--[on Kern's hypothesis], it helped the interests of the\r\nworkers.) DeLeon disapproved of it, not on moral grounds, but for the\r\nreasons given above in paragraph 2. The author does not know whether\r\nSt. John approves of stealing or not. Some color may be given to Mr.\r\nKern's contention by the charges which were circulated in Goldfield,\r\nNev., that the W. F.

W. W. ON THE \"CIVILIZED PLANE\"\r\n\r\n(1908-1915)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Detroit faction of the I. W. W. which in 1915 changed its name to\r\nthe Workers' International Industrial Union, never attained a strength\r\nat all comparable to that of the direct-actionist group. In Appendix\r\nIV are given what membership figures are available for both locals and\r\nindividual members. For the total membership, the figures in columns\r\n3 and 4 (Table A) are probably the most accurate. They show that the\r\nDetroiters had in 1910, two years after the schism of 1908, about 3,500\r\nmembers. The following year their membership was about the same, but\r\nin 1912 it very nearly reached 11,000. That was the year of maximum\r\nmembership, as it was also, except possibly for the year 1916, for the\r\nChicago faction. In every year the figures show a very much smaller\r\nmembership for the Detroit than for the Chicago faction. The difference\r\nin favor of the direct-actionists is still more marked in regard to the\r\nnumber of local unions. The Secretary-Treasurer of the Detroit faction\r\nsays that only one new local was organized in 1909--the year following\r\nthe split.[474] The following table shows the growth of local union\r\nmembership:[475]\r\n\r\n  DETROIT I.

The Secretary wrote on October 23, 1911:\r\n\"Our membership at present is about 10,000. Locals ... in nearly all\r\nstates as well as Canada. Organizations identical with ours ... in\r\nprinciple and method are active in England, Australia and Africa.\"[477]\r\nOn March 30, 1912, he wrote that the membership had \"passed the 20,000\r\nmark.\" When the Detroiters held their national convention in 1913--it\r\nwas called by them the Sixth I. W. W. Convention--there were 17 locals\r\nrepresented by delegates and the Secretary reported a membership of\r\n11,584. Twenty-two new locals had been organized, he said, during the\r\nyear ending September, 1913.[478] \"The principal reverse,\" says the\r\ncorrespondent of the _Weekly People_, \"was the lapsing of 14 locals,\r\nan unfortunate occurrence caused solely by the financial inability of\r\nheadquarters to send out organizers....\" The local unions represented\r\nat the convention included the silk workers of Paterson, N. J.; car\r\nand foundry, carpenters', and a \"mixed\" union in Detroit; a metal\r\nand machinery, and a \"mixed\" local in Chicago; metal workers of Erie,\r\nPa.; hotel and restaurant, \"public service\" and lumber workers in\r\nSeattle; mattress makers in Columbus, Ohio; and \"mixed\" locals in\r\nLynn, Mass., San Francisco, Portland, Ore., Los Angeles, and New York\r\nCity. The convention voted down a resolution to change the name of the\r\norganization and alter the \"political clause\" of the Preamble--the\r\nvital part of it which kept the I. W. W. high and dry on the civilized\r\nplane.[479] The Secretary reports that while the membership of the\r\nDetroit faction includes workers from nearly all industries the chief\r\nindustries represented are the following: textile, garment making,\r\nmetal and machinery, tobacco, food stuffs, furniture, transportation,\r\nautomobile, building, lumber, printing, shoe making, and public\r\nservice.[480]\r\n\r\nThe DeLeonites probably held a convention in 1914, but the writer\r\nhas not come across any report of it. In September, 1915, they held\r\nan \"Eighth I. W. W. Convention\" in Detroit. A brief report of the\r\nproceedings in their official organ indicates that, in addition to\r\nthree officers, there were present seven accredited delegates from the\r\nfollowing cities: Hartford, Conn., St. Louis, Columbus, Detroit and\r\nCristobal, Panama.[481]\r\n\r\nNot only were DeLeonite locals fewer in number than the\r\ndirect-actionist locals, but their average length of life was\r\nundoubtedly shorter. The General Secretary-Treasurer says that the\r\nmore important reasons for the disbanding of locals were opposition\r\nby employers after strikes, the removal of members to other cities\r\nin search of work, and the lack of men and women for the work of\r\norganizing.[482] In reply to a letter addressed to the secretary of a\r\ncertain local in New York, the writer was informed that \"there is now\r\nno such local union.\"\r\n\r\n    We had an organization [the former secretary says] under the\r\n    Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, which was begun in 1897 and\r\n    which, though greatly reduced, was continued until the I. W. W.\r\n    was organized in 1905. [Then] ... it grew to about 250 members,\r\n    but after the split in 1908 it began to decline, and though we\r\n    tried several times to reorganize, we failed and it has gone\r\n    out of existence.[483]\r\n\r\nAnother typical case is that of a cigarmakers' local in Baltimore,\r\nwhich, according to its former secretary, started in November, 1913,\r\nwith 22 members and \"increased the wages of all the cigarmakers in\r\nthe city from 50 cents to $1.00 per thousand.\" In January, 1914, the\r\nlocal had 350 members. Then came evil days. \"The strike forced on us by\r\nthe Royal Havana ... demoralized the membership [and] the S[ocialist]\r\nP[arty] members added to the confusion by creating dissensions. In\r\nthe year 1915 the organization was non-existent,\" and remains so,\r\nprobably.[484]\r\n\r\nThe Detroit faction being much less exclusively reliant on the more\r\nstrictly economic methods of carrying on the labor struggle, was\r\nnaturally much less addicted to strikes. Nevertheless they did conduct\r\na number of them. In May, 1910, the laborers of the Michigan Malleable\r\nIron Company of Detroit, after being on strike two weeks, were given\r\nan increase in wages. In April, 1911, the DeLeonites conducted a\r\nstrike of structural-iron painters in New York, in which 200 men\r\nwere involved. The following month they called out 40 machinists\r\nin Canton, Ohio. Their most important strike efforts were made in\r\n1911 and 1912 in the silk mills of Paterson and Passaic, N. J., and\r\nEaston, Pa. In these strikes the two I. W. W.s very often clashed.\r\nRudolph Katz, of the Detroiters, reports that during the silk strike\r\nof 1911-12 \"the silk workers of Paterson ... joined the Detroit I. W.\r\nW. _en masse_\" but that \"in the midst of the strike Wm. D. Haywood\r\nwas brought to Paterson and Passaic ... and the apple of discord was\r\nthrown among the strikers.\"[485] The Socialist Labor party reported\r\nthe Paterson-Passaic situation to the Socialist Congress at Vienna\r\nin 1914: \"In the big textile strike in Passaic, N. J.,\" their report\r\nsays, \"this organization [_i. e._, the S. L. P. or Detroit I. W. W.]\r\nwas fought by both the Socialist party and the Chicago I. W. W.-ites,\r\nwith Haywood leading this opposition and the capitalist press ably\r\nsupporting their flank.... That strike of 4,000 men, women and children\r\nwas lost through such treachery.\" The report adds that a few months\r\nearlier in 1912 \"the Detroit I. W. W. won a great strike of 6,000\r\nsilk weavers.\"[486] On December 20, 1913, one of the Paterson members\r\nof the DeLeonite faction sent the following dispatch to the _Weekly\r\nPeople_: \"Local 152, Bummery Bunch, did their best to pack last night's\r\nmeeting [of the Paterson silk workers] but only partly succeeded. Many\r\nlegitimate delegates raised their voices against anarchy expressed\r\nthrough sabotage and direct action....\"[487] Contrary to the foregoing\r\nevidence, the testimony of Adolph Lessig before the United States\r\nCommission on Industrial Relations seems to indicate that there were\r\nno serious differences between the two I. W. W.s during the Paterson\r\nstrike. Lessig says that there was no attempt to either quarrel or get\r\ntogether.[488]\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the Detroiters were also concerned in several smaller strikes.\r\nThey report a successful strike of textile workers at Mystic, Conn.,\r\nin January; a successful strike involving 50 Philadelphia mechanics in\r\nAugust, and one involving 16 cigarmakers in Baltimore, who won the wage\r\nincrease demanded. In 1914 and 1915 a few San Francisco ladies' tailors\r\nwere on strike against the piecework system and alleged bad treatment.\r\nThey were both reported as successful.\r\n\r\nThe two I. W. W.s continued to hate each other quite as much as they\r\nhated the capitalists, reformers, progressives, and Socialists. St.\r\nJohn has a paragraph in his historical sketch of the (Chicago) I.\r\nW. W. which may very well stand as the official expression of the\r\ndirect-actionists' opinion of the doctrinaires. He says:\r\n\r\n    The politicians [_i. e._, the Socialist Laborites] attempted to\r\n    set up another organization claiming to be the real industrial\r\n    movement. It is nothing but a duplicate of their political\r\n    party and does not function at all. It is committed to a\r\n    program of the \"civilized plane,\" _i. e._, parliamentarism.\r\n    Its publications are the official organs of a political sect\r\n    that never misses an opportunity to assail the revolutionary\r\n    workers while they are engaged in combat with some division\r\n    of the ruling class. Their favorite method is to charge the\r\n    revolutionists with all the crimes that a cowardly imagination\r\n    can conjure into being. \"Dynamiters, assassins, thugs,\r\n    murderers, thieves,\" etc., are stock phrases. Their only virtue\r\n    is that they put their assertions into print, while the other\r\n    wing of the politicians [the Socialist party men] spread their\r\n    venom in secret.[489]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1914, St. John testified as the official representative\r\nof the I. W. W. before the United States Commission on Industrial\r\nRelations. The Detroit I. W. W.s, he said, \"have no information--do\r\nnot give out any information; have no organization except on paper,\r\nand are committed to the program of capturing plates at the political\r\npie-counter ... and trading ... on the name of the I. W. W. That is the\r\nway they keep alive.\"[490] At the Seattle hearings of the Commission in\r\nAugust, 1914, James P. Thompson, at one time the General Organizer of\r\nthe Chicago I. W. W., expressed himself on the subject of the other I.\r\nW. W. He said that the Detroiters were \"quite different from the I. W.\r\nW.\"\r\n\r\n    They stole our name [he went on]. They have a political idea\r\n    instead of the union idea.... After the 1908 convention, when\r\n    the politicians of the Socialist Labor Party found themselves\r\n    outside of the I. W. W., they held a conference in Paterson, N.\r\n    J., and they decided they would [have] an organization of their\r\n    own, with a political clause; and when they came to decide on a\r\n    name there was much debate. [The name \"Socialist Labor Union\"\r\n    was proposed.] ... But another motion prevailed, and they stole\r\n    the name of the I. W. W., and called themselves the Industrial\r\n    Workers of the World, although they don't amount to much.[491]\r\n\r\nWhat the doctrinaires thought of the direct-actionists--or at least\r\nwhat their leaders wanted workingmen in general to think of them--is\r\nof equal importance. In a leaflet published by the Detroit faction we\r\nare told that \"the anarchist element that still calls itself the I. W.\r\nW. proceeded from the close of the 1908 convention to reveal its true\r\nnature by its actions. The western official organ of this element '_The\r\nIndustrial Worker_,' of Spokane, Wash., began to advocate theft, petty\r\nlarceny, chicken-stealing, breaking up small employment agencies, and\r\nalso advised the workers to 'strike at the ballot-box with an ax.'\"[492]\r\n\r\nWhen the doctrinaires held their 1915 convention (the \"Eighth I. W. W.\r\nConvention\") General Secretary Richter, in his report, took pains to\r\npay his compliments to the direct-actionists.\r\n\r\n    The anarcho-syndicalist aggregation [he said], the so-called\r\n    \"Chicago I. W. W.\" which in 1908 with great blare of trumpets\r\n    was going to show the workers how to get out of capitalism,\r\n    _via_ \"sabotage\" and \"direct action\" in double-quick time--what\r\n    is left of them has a precarious existence, trimmed to a\r\n    frazzle by the relentless forces of social progress, their\r\n    panaceas shrivelled, they make indeed a sorry-looking\r\n    crowd.[493]\r\n\r\nA few months before this, Richter remarked: \"Many of the followers of\r\nthe Saint [St. John] and 'Big Bill' [Haywood] are a sadder but wiser\r\nlot. Hundreds have already joined the Socialist [meaning the Detroit]\r\nI. W. W., and more are on the way.\"[494]\r\n\r\nThe Chicago I. W. W. was bracketed with the American Federation of\r\nLabor as being equally with it a snare and a delusion to the working\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n    We find the Bummery [the Chicago I. W. W.] denying the\r\n    ballot-box; we find the American Federation of Labor denying\r\n    the class struggle and proclaiming the identity of interest\r\n    between master and slave; we find the Socialist party of\r\n    America ... seeking the support of the craft union; ... we\r\n    find the Socialist Labor party which says the workers must own\r\n    collectively the land and the tools; ... we find the I. W. W.\r\n    of Detroit which says the workers must come together on the\r\n    political and industrial fields....[495]\r\n\r\nA sober explanation of the DeLeonites' position as compared with the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor and the \"Bummery\" was made by Rudolph Katz\r\nto the Commission on Industrial Relation. He said that the Chicago I.\r\nW.W.s look upon the ballot as a gift from the capitalist class. The\r\nDetroit I. W. W.s consider the ballot \"a conquest of civilization,\r\nand,\" continued Katz,\r\n\r\n    we are going to use it. Now a body that repudiates the ballot\r\n    naturally has to take something else, such as sabotage and\r\n    direct action. Now the American Federation of Labor does not\r\n    preach sabotage, but it practices it; and the Chicago I. W. W.\r\n    preaches sabotage but does not practice it.... The position\r\n    that we take [he concluded] is that if we have the majority,\r\n    and the capitalists [and] officials who count the ballots ...\r\n    refuse to count us in, well,--then there will be a scrap. But\r\n    we are going to test the peaceful method first.[496]\r\n\r\nThe DeLeonites cite the recent strike of the clothing workers in\r\nBaltimore in support of their strictures on the Federation and the\r\nChicago I. W. W. They call it \"a desperate attempt\" by the \"Bummery\" I.\r\nW. W. and the American Federation of Labor to crush out the Amalgamated\r\nClothing Workers. The strike was directed, they say, by leaders of\r\nthe United Garment Workers, the American Federation of Labor, and the\r\nChicago I. W. W.[497]\r\n\r\n    The struggle that is raging in Baltimore between the\r\n    Amalgamated Clothing Workers, on the one side, and the American\r\n    Federation of Labor and the Bummery I. W. W. on the other\r\n    side, is a struggle of clean _versus_ corrupt unionism.... In\r\n    this Baltimore affair we have revealed the kinship between the\r\n    Bummery I. W. W. and the American Federation of Labor. These\r\n    are both nothing more than parasites upon workingmen....[498]\r\n\r\nThe Detroiters and the Socialist Labor party fight the\r\nanarcho-syndicalist faction of the I. W. W., according to the report of\r\nthe party to the International Socialist Congress at Brussels in 1911,\r\nbecause the direct-actionists \"advocate physical force exclusively; at\r\nthe same time it [the Socialist Labor party] gives all possible support\r\nto the workers who, even under the otherwise baneful leadership of\r\nanarchy, are trying to throw off the yoke of the capitalist masters and\r\nthe reactionary trade-union lieutenants of those masters.\"[499]\r\n\r\nThe doctrinaires consider the Chicago I. W. W.s anarchists and\r\nthemselves socialists--but socialists of a simon-pure Marxian stripe\r\nas opposed to the opportunist socialism of the Socialist party. In\r\none of their propaganda leaflets they declare that \"the only labor\r\norganization in the United States today which is wholly dominated by\r\nanarchists is the so-called Industrial Workers of the World, with\r\nheadquarters, in Chicago, Ill.\"[500] A propaganda leaflet already\r\nquoted sums up in very characteristic fashion the theoretical position\r\nof the DeLeonites:\r\n\r\n    This, then, is the inspiring task of the I. W. W., and its\r\n    purpose and reason of being: To decry the ballot, which is\r\n    a civilized method of settling social issues; to advocate\r\n    physical force only; to preach petty larceny, rioting,\r\n    smashing machines, and all these things that come under\r\n    the term \"direct action,\" is unnecessary, and also invites\r\n    disaster to the workers and helps the forces of reaction. Such\r\n    measures are suicidal and condemned by civilization. For these\r\n    reasons the _bona fide_ I. W. W. sets its face like flint\r\n    against any organization that teaches such tragedy-producing\r\n    tactics. The working class cannot \"sabotage,\" cannot dynamite\r\n    itself into possession of the plants of production. Its only\r\n    requisite and available _might_ is its sound, class-conscious,\r\n    properly-constructed Industrial Union. With such it is\r\n    irresistible. By such agency, and by it alone, can it take\r\n    permanent possession of the tools of production, and only in\r\n    that way can civilization be saved from a catastrophe. As has\r\n    been well said, \"Right without Might is a fool's pastime; Might\r\n    without Right is the sport of the savage.\"[501]\r\n\r\nEugene Debs, who was one of the leading spirits in the organization\r\nof the I. W. W. in 1905, and who thought that the elimination of\r\nthe political clause by the Chicago faction in 1908 was a monstrous\r\nblunder, endorsed the position of the DeLeonites on political action.\r\n\"This faction,\" said Debs, \"is corner-stoned in the true principles of\r\nunionism in reference to political action.\"[502] He thought that there\r\nwas \"no essential difference between the Chicago and Detroit factions\r\nof the I. W. W.\" \"If I am right in believing that a majority of the\r\nrank and file of the Chicago faction favor political action,\" he said,\r\n\"then there is no reason why this majority should not consolidate\r\nwith the Detroit faction, and thus put an end to the division of\r\nthese forces.\"[503] Debs was of the opinion that, if the I. W. W. had\r\ncontinued as it began, \"a revolutionary industrial union, recognizing\r\nthe need of political as well as industrial action, instead of being\r\nhamstrung by its own leaders and converted ... into an anti-political\r\nmachine, it would today be the most formidable labor organization in\r\nAmerica, if not the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of the bifurcated era of I. W. W. history came in September,\r\n1915, when the DeLeonites at their national convention (called the\r\n\"Eighth I. W. W. Convention\") changed their name to the Workers'\r\nInternational Industrial Union, and the _Weekly People_[504] announced:\r\n\"The Industrial Workers of the World as founded at Chicago in 1905\r\nis no more.\" The reason given by the Detroiters for the change was\r\nvirtually that the \"Bummery\" had disgraced the letters \"I. W. W.\"\r\n\"The name I. W. W.,\" declared Fellow Worker Crawford, \"has come to be\r\nassociated with petty larceny and other slum tactics. It is up to us to\r\nchoose a new name so as to escape the odium attached to the one we now\r\nbear.\"[505] Their attitude was more fully explained in an announcement\r\nby the General Secretary-Treasurer in their official journal.\r\n\r\n    While the principles, methods and form of organization adopted\r\n    in 1905 have stood the test of time [the announcement runs]\r\n    a new element has asserted itself under the name of I. W. W.\r\n    whose practices and beliefs are different and opposed to\r\n    socialist Industrial Unionism. The capitalists and their\r\n    hirelings, quick to exploit any condition that serves their\r\n    interests, boosted along the shouters of \"sabotage\" and \"direct\r\n    action\" with such success since 1906 that today \"I. W. W.\"\r\n    stands for lunatics on a rampage, in the public mind and a\r\n    large portion of the workers.[506]\r\n\r\nThe name Socialist Labor Union, originally proposed in 1908,\r\nwas again discussed and considered very seriously because their\r\ndesire was appropriately to label an organization which claimed to\r\nstand for \"socialist class unionism.\" Finally, however, the name,\r\nWorkers' International Industrial Union, was decided upon \"as most\r\nappropriate for the designation of the economic wing of the Socialist\r\nmovement.\"[507]\r\n\r\nThe W. I. I. U. soon issued a \"Manifesto of Socialist Industrial\r\nUnionism\" which explained the principles of the newly-christened\r\norganization. The W. I. I. U., declares the Manifesto,\r\n\r\n    refuses to conduct the class struggle on the lines of a\r\n    dog fight. It does not sanction lawlessness on the part of\r\n    employers, the capitalists and their hirelings by doing\r\n    likewise. It condemns \"sabotage\" and all such childish\r\n    practices by any one as useless for the working class and\r\n    harmful to real progress.[508]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[474] _Private correspondence_, Feb. 17, 1915.\r\n\r\n[475] Arranged from figures given by Secretary-Treasurer Richter in\r\nletter dated Feb. 17, 1915.\r\n\r\n[476] Includes 15 mixed locals.\r\n\r\n[477] _Private correspondence._\r\n\r\n[478] Report of the convention by Russell Palmer, _Weekly People_,\r\nSeptember 27, 1913.\r\n\r\n[479] Palmer, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[480] _Private correspondence_, H.

W. W.\"),\r\nwith labels of identical design--bodies closely paralleling each\r\nother in scope and structure despite their disparity in doctrine and\r\ntactics--makes it very difficult to discuss either group, or I. W.\r\nW.-ism in general, without ambiguity. The I. W. W. which has been most\r\nadvertised in the United States is the Chicago, or \"Direct-Actionist,\"\r\nor \"Anarcho-Syndicalist,\" or \"Anti-Political,\" or \"Bummery\" or \"red\" I.\r\nW. W. This is the I. W. W. which was actively interested in the strikes\r\nat Lawrence, Massachusetts, Wheatland, California, and many other\r\nplaces, and in \"free speech\" fights at Spokane, Fresno, and San Diego.\r\nThey are the \"Wobblies\" of the West. In this present work they are\r\nconsidered, entirely without prejudice to the admittedly more \"correct\"\r\nand consistent position of the doctrinaires of the Detroit wing, to be\r\n_the_ I. W. W. The doctrinaires are the socialistic, pro-political,\r\n\"yellow\" I. W. W.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed in these chapters to sketch the main lines of\r\ndevelopment of the Chicago organization from 1908 to the present\r\ntime, as well as to indicate the general character of its activities\r\nfrom year to year. The important and bitterly fought struggle at the\r\nseventh and eighth conventions in 1912 and 1913 over the question of\r\ndecentralization is described as faithfully as possible. The relations\r\nbetween the I. W. W. and the Socialist party are set forth, especially\r\nin connection with the adoption of the famous _sabotage_ clause by\r\nthe Socialist party at its Indianapolis convention in 1912. The newer\r\nphases of the organizing and propaganda work of the I. W. W., the\r\nfree-speech fights, and its increased activity among the unskilled and\r\nfloating laborers are described. No attempt is made here to go into\r\nthe various strikes and free-speech controversies in more than a very\r\ncursory manner. This is not because their importance is underestimated.\r\nThe writer feels that the field work of the \"Wobblies\" is really the\r\nmost significant part of their history, if for no other reason than\r\nthat the I. W. W. expends perhaps more energy in proportion to its\r\nstrength and resources in propaganda, organizing and advertising\r\nwork afield than does almost any other labor organization in the\r\ncountry. The more striking episodes in the career of the I. W. W.,\r\nlike the Lawrence strike and the Wheatland hop riots, have, however,\r\nbeen extensively written up in the magazines and recorded as well\r\nin scientific journals and government reports. On the contrary, the\r\nvicissitudes of the career of the I. W. W. as an organized body of\r\nworkers have never even been recited.\r\n\r\nThe split of 1908 left the direct-actionists in almost as weak a\r\ncondition as the doctrinaires. The weakness of the latter has been\r\nchronic. The former were able to develop great strength because they\r\nhad modified their theories to the extent necessary to make some\r\nappreciable application of them to the actual conditions of economic\r\nlife. They were confronted by conditions and met them at the cost\r\nof doctrinal consistency. They were unconscious pragmatists and the\r\nresult is that they have made themselves felt to a much greater\r\nextent than the doctrinaires. They have been strikingly successful as\r\ngadflies--stinging and shocking the _bourgeoisie_ into the initiation\r\nof reforms. If the \"anarcho-syndicalist\" I. W. W. may not properly be\r\ncalled a successful organization, there is at least this much to be\r\nsaid for it: it has been a far less _unsuccessful_ organization than\r\nhas the doctrinaire faction.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the split in 1908 the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld scarcely more than kept alive. The membership dwindled and\r\nlocals expired by the score. Between September, 1908, and May 1, 1910,\r\nonly sixty-six new local unions were chartered.[509] Only in 1911 did\r\ntheir number begin to increase, and even then it was a halting and\r\nfitful progress. Levine writes that the I. W. W. had \"shrunk to a mere\r\nhandful of leaders, revolutionary in spirit and ideals, and persevering\r\nin action, with a small, scattered and shifting following and an\r\nunsatisfactory administrative machinery.\"[510]\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1909 the organization was actively interested in a\r\nnumber of strikes. The most important of these was the McKees Rocks\r\n(Pennsylvania) strike in which 6,000 employees of the Pressed Steel Car\r\nCompany were out for two months. Other strikes of the year involved the\r\nlumbermen at Somers and Kalispell, Montana; Eureka, California, and\r\nPrince Rupert, B. C.; the sheet and tin plate workers at New Castle\r\nand Shenango, Pennsylvania; and the farm laborers at Waterville,\r\nWashington. Secretary Trautmann believed that these \"constant\r\nirritative strikes\" were more than all else responsible for the fact\r\nthat less than one-third the gross membership was active (dues-paying)\r\nmembership. These strikes, he said, involved half the membership in the\r\ncourse of one year.[511]\r\n\r\nIt was in this same year that the I. W. W. made its bow to the American\r\npublic as the militant jail and soap-box belligerent in the free-speech\r\nfight. As early as April, 1906, there was a minor clash between\r\nthe police and the \"Wobblies,\" but it was not until nearly three\r\nyears later that the I. W. W. free-speech epidemic assumed national\r\nproportions. Since 1909 the I. W. W.s have attracted quite as much\r\nattention by their dramatic free-speech controversies with municipal\r\nauthorities here and there as they have by the time-honored resort\r\nto the strike. During the next few years after the schism of 1908\r\nthese free-speech struggles became rather frequent. The Pacific slope\r\nis the most fruitful soil for these conflicts. Labor is more mobile\r\nthere, and when the organizers in any particular town are arrested for\r\npreaching revolution a more effective call to \"foot-loose Wobblies\"\r\nfor an \"invasion\" is possible. On the Pacific slope the \"Wobblies\"\r\nalmost literally broke into the jails by hundreds. They came to speak,\r\nbut with the nearly certain foreknowledge that they would be collared\r\nby the police before they said many words. They simply crowded the\r\njails, and in this way, as they intended, clogged the machinery of\r\nmunicipal administration by making themselves the guests of the city\r\nin such numbers as to be no inconsiderable burden to their real hosts,\r\nthe taxpayers. Vincent St. John, then Secretary-Treasurer of the I. W.\r\nW., recently told the United States Commission on Industrial Relations\r\nthat \"wherever any local union becomes involved in a free-speech fight\r\nthey notify the general office and that information is sent to all the\r\nlocal unions, ... with the request that if they have any members that\r\nare foot-loose to send them along.\" Mr. St. John stated, however, that\r\nthe general (_i. e._, the national) organization does not in any way\r\nfinance or manage these free-speech fights except to contribute, so far\r\nas possible, at the call of the locals. The management of the struggle\r\nis in the hands, of the local union or unions most interested.[512]\r\nThe same tactics are pursued in nearly every instance--a policy of\r\nsullen non-resistance on the part of the I. W. W. and of wholesale\r\njailing by the authorities. The trouble always seems to begin because\r\nlocal authorities are revolted by--or at least nervously apprehensive\r\nabout--either the substance of the I. W. W. speeches or the language in\r\nwhich their ideas are conveyed, or both. The remarks are alleged to be\r\nseditious, incendiary, unpatriotic, immoral, _etc._, or, whether they\r\nare any or all these or none of them, they are alleged to be profane\r\nor vulgar beyond the limits of forbearance. In the judgment of the\r\nwriter the latter charge can be laid at the door of the I. W. W. with\r\nfar greater justification than can the former. Refinement is not the\r\nWobblies' long suit. How could it be? Our town fathers ought to be\r\nsomewhat more tolerant of a want of refinement which is more or less\r\ninevitable under the conditions--for which conditions, moreover, they\r\nare in part responsible.\r\n\r\nAs to the first charge, it can only be remarked that suppression of\r\nwhat authorities think is subversive and seditious almost invariable\r\nhas the same effect as would an effort to smother an active volcano.\r\nThe ideas get expressed anyhow--and more bitterly, with the added\r\ncircumstance that those who try to do the smothering are burnt.\r\nOf course, it is not easy to determine at just what point language\r\nbecomes directly provocative to violence. This limit of possible\r\nofficial tolerance is far less often reached than would be indicated\r\nby the actual conduct of local officials in these circumstances. \"It\r\ncannot be considered as provocative of immediate disorder,\" says\r\nPolice Commissioner Arthur Woods, of New York, \"if speakers criticize,\r\nno matter how vehemently, the existing order of things, or if they\r\nrecommend, no matter how enthusiastically, a change which they believe\r\nwould improve things.\"[513] When George Creel was police commissioner\r\nin Denver he took a similar position and worked on the theory that all\r\nideas could be safely given a hearing. He is reported to have given\r\nthe following answer to an I. W. W. committee which applied to him\r\nfor a \"soap-box permit\": \"Go ahead, boys; speak as much as you like;\r\nonly there's just one favor I'm going to ask. I wish you wouldn't\r\nspout directly under the army headquarters. They're not important, but\r\nthey're childish, and they'll make me lots of bother if you do.\"[514]\r\nThe result: nothing more happened than happens when the mine operators\r\nsay that the leaders of the United Mine Workers ought to be taken out\r\nand shot. There was free speech but no fight.\r\n\r\nAfter the experience of Spokane, Fresno, and San Diego some members\r\nof the organization at least recognized that no matter how absolute\r\ntheir right to pitch into established institutions from every angle,\r\nthe sober necessities of a successful propaganda for revolutionary\r\nindustrial unionism demanded more concentration upon that subject. In\r\nSeptember, 1913, Ewald Koetgen, a member of the General Executive\r\nBoard, made this suggestion to the delegates at the eighth convention:\r\n\r\n    If you confine yourself strictly to the propaganda of\r\n    industrial unionism, and then they prohibit you from using the\r\n    street corner, you have a much stronger case. Many ... attack\r\n    everybody, the police, the city officials, religion, politics,\r\n    and everything else. They speak about everything under the\r\n    sun and these pretexts are used in order to keep them off the\r\n    street, whereas, in a good many cities, the organizer could go\r\n    and speak on industrial unionism, and be left there a whole lot\r\n    longer....[515]\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1909 there were no less than three important free-speech\r\ncampaigns conducted by the I. W. W. These were staged at Missoula,\r\nMontana; Spokane, Washington; and New Castle, Pennsylvania. In 1910\r\nsmall \"fights\" were conducted in the spring and summer in Wenatchee\r\nand Walla Walla, Washington, and during the fall a much more important\r\none at Fresno, California. This latter struggle continued until March,\r\n1911. From this time until the end of the year 1913 hardly a mouth\r\nelapsed that did not witness a more or less important free-speech\r\ncontroversy between the Wobblies and the municipal authorities in some\r\npart of the United States. In the five-year period, 1909-1913, there\r\nwere at least twenty free-speech campaigns of importance, continuing\r\nunder definite I. W. W. direction for periods ranging from a few days\r\nto more than six months. The most important of these disturbances\r\nwas that at San Diego, which broke out about February 1, 1912, and\r\ncontinued until late the following summer. Since 1913 free speech has\r\nbeen a less important issue with the I. W. W., and there have been\r\ncomparatively few such disturbances.\r\n\r\nPaterson, New Jersey, Aberdeen, South Dakota, Old Forge, Pennsylvania,\r\nand Everett, Washington, are almost the only cases of any great\r\nimportance. The most serious of these was the Everett free-speech\r\ncontroversy which culminated in the fatal tragedy of November 6, 1916.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the residents of the cities where free-speech\r\nfights have been staged was naturally bitterly hostile. This was\r\nmost strikingly noticeable in business and commercial circles and\r\nwas of course reflected in the daily press. In San Diego during the\r\nfree-speech fight the local papers, almost without exception, kept up\r\na running fire of editorial abuse of the I. W. W.s. \"Hanging is none\r\ntoo good for them,\" said the _Tribune_; \"they would be much better\r\ndead, for they are absolutely useless in the human economy; they are\r\nthe waste material of creation and should be drained off into the\r\nsewer of oblivion there to rot in cold obstruction like any other\r\nexcrement.\"[516] In the face of such a tirade it is interesting to read\r\nthe report of the Special Commissioner sent by Governor Hiram Johnson\r\nto investigate the disturbances in San Diego. Commissioner Weinstock\r\ntook pains to follow up the stories of the brutality and cruelty of the\r\nself-constituted citizens' committee of Vigilantes not only to the I.\r\nW. W.s but also to any who were outspoken enough to defend them or who\r\nwere alleged to have aided and abetted them. Mr. Weinstock says that he\r\n\"is frank to confess that when he became satisfied of the truth of the\r\nstories ... it was hard for him to believe that he was not sojourning\r\nin Russia, conducting his investigation there instead of in this\r\nalleged 'land of the free and home of the brave.'\"[517]\r\n\r\nThe organization made no attempt to hold a convention in 1909, but in\r\nMay, 1910, the fifth convention met in Chicago. On the first day there\r\nwere twenty-two delegates present, representing forty-two local unions\r\nin the following states: California, Colorado, Montana, Rhode Island,\r\nMinnesota, Ohio, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Pennsylvania, Arizona,\r\nIndiana, and in British Columbia. Judging from the very fragmentary\r\nrecords available there was little business of any importance\r\ntransacted at this meeting. The delegates adopted a resolution to\r\n\"reaffirm the original [Industrial Union] Manifesto of 1905,...\"[518]\r\nand dispersed.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1911, fifteen months later, a somewhat more successful\r\nconvention was held. This sixth annual meeting of the I. W. W. was in\r\npoint of size almost as insignificant as the preceding one, thirty-one\r\ndelegates from eleven states being present. In addition to the regular\r\ndelegates there were present three \"fraternal delegates\" from the\r\nBrotherhood of Timber Workers. Twenty-one locals were represented\r\nin addition to the locals included in the Textile Workers National\r\nIndustrial Union of the I. W. W.--the only \"national industrial union\r\nat that time included in the organization.\"[519] The convention was\r\nharmonious, and there is, therefore, the less to chronicle. \"Most\r\nof the delegates were young men full of the fire and enthusiasm of\r\nyouth. 'Intellectuals' were conspicuous by their absence.\"[520] We\r\nare told that very few changes were made in the organic law of the\r\norganization. Proposals were made, however, by the score. In the\r\nappendix to the _Minutes_ is a list containing seventy resolutions\r\nwhich were presented on the floor of the convention.[521] The question\r\nof politics was scarcely touched upon. An anti-parliamentary resolution\r\nwas voted down without discussion. The bulk of the delegates were\r\nundoubtedly _non_-parliamentarians, that is to say, indifferent about\r\npolitics and legislative action. An official report of the convention\r\nin the _Industrial Worker_ says that the report of General Organizer\r\nTrautmann, which it declared would be published later in _Solidarity_,\r\n\r\n    was a scathing indictment of the criminal alliance between the\r\n    A. F. of L. fakirs and the self-styled revolutionary socialist\r\n    politicians, who, as the report shows, time and again have\r\n    acted in full concert in defeating strikes rather than to allow\r\n    the workers to win with I. W. W. methods--methods whose success\r\n    spells ruination for the political and craft union movements\r\n    which are sucking the life blood of the working class.[522]\r\n\r\nMr. Trautmann later transfered his allegiance to the Socialist Labor\r\nparty faction. The _Weekly People_ (the official S. L. P. organ) of\r\nJuly 26, 1913, published (on page 2) a letter from Trautmann to Eugene\r\nV. Debs in which he says:\r\n\r\n    In the convention of 1911 of the Industrial Workers of\r\n    the World my report contained a scathing attack on the\r\n    anti-political politicians and the never-will-I-work scavengers\r\n    who pose as organizers and spokesmen of the organization. The\r\n    convention ordered that report to be printed ... [but] Vincent\r\n    St. John and his clique put away the report and it never\r\n    appeared.\r\n\r\nOfficial reports of the convention claimed that there had been \"a\r\ngradual increase in the moral, financial and numerical strength of the\r\nI. W. W.\" This claim is not entirely justified by available figures.\r\nThe number of locals in the organization was but slightly, if any,\r\ngreater. Fewer charters were issued and more locals disbanded in 1911\r\nthan in 1910. The membership figures are conflicting, those furnished\r\nby the Secretary-Treasurer making a less favorable showing than those\r\nof Professor Barnett.[523] Mr. St. John says that the membership of the\r\norganization in good standing in October, 1911, was about 10,000.\r\n\r\n    We do not claim anything [he said] except membership in good\r\n    standing; as a matter of fact, however, the General Office has\r\n    issued 60,000 due books in the past eighteen months and of\r\n    this number only about one in ten keeps in good standing, due\r\n    to the kind of work the membership of the most part follow.\r\n    They are engaged in construction, harvesting and working in\r\n    the woods, _etc._ This means that they are out of touch with\r\n    the organization the greater part of the year either on the\r\n    job or moving about the country looking for work, and of\r\n    course they cannot and do not keep in good standing, but as\r\n    they drift into town they pay up. In passing, it may be stated\r\n    that the above number is the largest membership the I. W. W.\r\n    has had since its inception, except when the W. F. of M. was\r\n    supposed to be a part of the organization. I know that the\r\n    second annual convention reports claim 60,000 members, but the\r\n    books of the organization did not justify any such claim; in\r\n    fact, the average paid-up membership with the W. F. of M. for\r\n    the first year of the organization was 14,000 members in round\r\n    numbers.[524]\r\n\r\nThere was at this time a very considerable gain in particular\r\nindustries, such as metal working and railroad and building\r\nconstruction. This development is indicated in Table 1, which shows the\r\naverage membership of the I. W. W. in the specified industries during\r\nthe period 1910-1913:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1[525]\r\n\r\nAVERAGE MEMBERSHIP (CHICAGO) I. W.

The organization was now unquestionably picking\r\nup. In 1910 there had been a number of I. W. W. strikes--nine at any\r\nrate in which the organization was actively interested. In April, the\r\nfarm hands of North Yamhill, Oregon, who \"had been handing out the\r\nprinciples of revolutionary unionism in huge, raw chunks,\"[526] walked\r\nout on account of the discharge of some of their number. In August, the\r\nGas Works' laborers in southern California, chiefly Mexicans, were out\r\nfor about two weeks for higher wages. The settlement as reported fixed\r\nwages at $2.25 and provided that only I. W. W.s were to be employed in\r\nthe future. A strike of the window cleaners in Providence for a wage\r\nincrease and the closed shop was reported won. These instances will\r\ngive an idea of the character of the strikes and the workers involved.\r\nIn 1910 there appear to have been very few strikes in which the I. W.\r\nW. was interested. Such meager data as are available about I. W. W.\r\nstrikes have been gathered together in Appendix VIII.\r\n\r\nAlthough 1911 was an inactive year as regards strikes, the condition of\r\nthe organization was not nearly so hopeless as it had been.\r\n\r\n    Despite the prevailing \"hard times,\" [writes \"The Commentator\"]\r\n    the I. W. W. is (in February, 1911) upheld by six weekly\r\n    papers of its own.... Far from being weak and emaciated, as\r\n    in 1907, the I. W. W. is putting up a robust fight for free\r\n    speech and assemblage at Fresno, Cal.; and is giving the Shoe\r\n    Manufacturers' Association of Greater New York the struggle\r\n    of their lives--a struggle in which for the first time the\r\n    employers combat an organization which means to make the shop\r\n    the collective property of the workers....[527]\r\n\r\nAnother indication of growth was the expansion of the I. W. W. press.\r\nAt the close of the fourth convention the I. W. W. had only one\r\npaper, the _Industrial Union Bulletin_, which suspended publication\r\nearly in 1909 and whose place was filled by the _Industrial Worker_\r\n(II.) (Spokane), which in turn passed out in September, 1913. The\r\n_Industrial Worker_ (I.) was published from January, 1906, until\r\nthe summer of 1907. The _Industrial Worker_ (III.) (Seattle) began\r\npublication in April, 1916, and continues to appear.[528] It is stated\r\nin _Solidarity_, July 2, 1910, that in that year the I. W. W. had seven\r\npapers in as many different languages.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months preceding the sixth convention (September,\r\n1911) seventy locals were organized and forty-eight disbanded. They\r\nwere distributed among specified industries, as shown in Table 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2[529]\r\n\r\n  _Industry_                 _Organized_  _Disbanded_\r\n\r\n  Metal and machinery              11        10\r\n  Food stuffs (Bakers)              2         2\r\n  Recruiting locals                13         8\r\n  Tobacco                           1\r\n  Building                          4         4\r\n  Shoe                              1         1\r\n  Public Service                    8         4\r\n  Clothing                          3         3\r\n  Furniture                         1\r\n  Mining (coal)                     4\r\n  Transportation                    7         2\r\n  Smelting                          1\r\n  Lumber                            9         4\r\n  Farming                           2         2\r\n  Car building                      2         4\r\n  Steel                             1         4\r\n                                  -------------\r\n                                   70        48\r\n\r\nSecretary-Treasurer St. John presented an interesting classification of\r\nthe reasons given for the disbanding of these forty-eight local unions.\r\nHe distributes them as follows:\r\n\r\n  Disrupted by lack of interest             22\r\n  Disrupted by strike                        6\r\n  Disrupted by other organizations           6\r\n  Work closing down                          5\r\n  Disrupted by members leaving locality      2\r\n  Incompetent secretary                      2\r\n  Disrupted by internal dissension           1\r\n  Members left for Mexico                    1\r\n  No record                                  3\r\n                                           ---\r\n                                            48[530]\r\n\r\nIt was at this meeting that the question of the authority of the\r\ngeneral administration over the rank and file was first seriously\r\nconsidered in the I. W. W. A number of constitutional changes were\r\nproposed and most of them were brought forward with the more or less\r\ndefinite idea of minimizing, or at least modifying in some way, the\r\nauthority of the national officers and the other members or the General\r\nExecutive Board. These amendments originated chiefly from local unions\r\nin the Rocky Mountain and Pacific States. The debates lasted several\r\ndays and involved a rather thorough discussion of the relations\r\nbetween the different parts of the organization. All of these proposed\r\namendments were lost, the delegates being of the opinion probably that\r\nfew constitutional changes were necessary.[531]\r\n\r\nAt this (1911) convention, W. Z. Foster presented his report as\r\nrepresentative of the I. W. W. at the seventh conference of the\r\nInternational Labor Secretariat which met at Budapest in August.\r\nHe was unable to make a very favorable report. The international\r\nconference, after giving an entire day to a discussion of the question\r\nof the admission of the I. W. W., refused it unanimously despite\r\nthe fact that his claims were backed by the representatives of the\r\n_Confédération Générale du Travail_ of France.[532] At about this time\r\nthe French syndicalists were facing a serious crisis, which threatened\r\nthem as well with complete division. They escaped then, but there have\r\nsince developed two groups in the C. G. T.: the \"red\" (revolutionary)\r\nsyndicalists, and the \"yellow\" (conservative) syndicalists.[533]\r\n\r\nKarl Kautsky quotes M. Lagardelle as having admitted in 1911 that \"the\r\npresent crisis compels a general revision of the facts and the ideas\r\nof syndicalism. After a glorious beginning we find ourselves faced\r\nwith that which is generally the result of forced marches in complete\r\nexhaustion.\"[534]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. had had no direct contact with French syndicalism previous\r\nto 1908. Moreover, its relations with the French movement have not at\r\nany time been as close or as definite as is generally imagined. The\r\nI. W. W. _organization_ is an indigenous American product, if there\r\never was such a thing. The tactics used have come in part through the\r\nreading by I. W. W.s of the writings of Pouget, Sorel, Lagardelle, and\r\nothers of the French syndicalist school. This contagion of ideas has\r\nalso spread through personal contacts. In 1908 William D. Haywood went\r\nto Europe and there met some of the leaders of the C. G. T. Again in\r\n1910 he was present at the International Labor and Socialist Congress\r\nat Copenhagen. He nominally represented the Socialist party of America,\r\nbut he also, in an unofficial way, championed the cause of American\r\nsyndicalism as it had been developed by the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld.[535]\r\n\r\nThe biennial conference of the International (Labor) Secretariat\r\nmet at Budapest, Hungary, August 10-12, 1911. The entire first day's\r\nsession was taken up with a lengthy argument over the admission of W.\r\nZ. Foster, the I. W. W. delegate. His credentials were finally rejected\r\nsince he had only the support of the French _Confédération Générale du\r\nTravail_.[536] President Gompers of the American Federation of Labor,\r\nin his report to its convention held later on in the same year, refers\r\nto \"the repudiation of the so-called Industrial Workers of the World\"\r\nat the Budapest conference. \"Inasmuch,\" he said, \"as the would-be\r\ndelegate for the corporal's guard that composes the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World professed to support the policies and program of the\r\n_Confédération Générale du Travail_ of France, his pretensions were\r\nsupported by the latter organization.\"[537] James Duncan, the A. F. of\r\nL. delegate at Budapest, reported that \"a misguided man, named Foster,\r\nfrom Chicago, claiming to represent an alleged organization of labor\r\nin America, called the International [_sic_] Workers of the World, had\r\nbeen for some time in Paris ...\" and had apparently convinced the C.\r\nG. T. that he should be recognized at the Budapest conference instead\r\nof the A. F of L. representatives. \"During the discussion Foster lost\r\ncontrol of his temper,\" said Duncan; \"he even threatened\r\nassault ...--ocular demonstration of what an I. W. W. really is(!) ...\r\n[But] the Frenchmen were not dismayed at their tricolor being smudged\r\nwith I. W. W. mire.\"[538]\r\n\r\nFrench syndicalism, then, has entered the I. W. W. to give it certain\r\ncharacteristic strike tactics and a set of foggy philosophical\r\nconcepts about the General Strike, the \"militant minority,\" _etc._\r\nTo this extent the I. W. W. is a syndicalist union. In structure it\r\nis a decentralized body (to the extent that it has any body to be\r\ndecentralized), whereas the C. G. T. is decidedly centralized. In its\r\norganization and in its attitude toward compatriot labor bodies it is\r\nat variance with the French Confédération. The French idea has taken\r\nmore definite form in the United States in the shape of the Syndicalist\r\nLeague of North America.\r\n\r\nThe Syndicalist League is a propaganda body rather than a labor\r\norganization. It is directed largely against the I. W. W.--opposing\r\nsyndicalism to the industrialism of the American organization. It\r\nbelieves in the possibility of reforming the American Federation of\r\nLabor from within and condemns the dual-unionism of the I. W. W. It\r\nis optimistic regarding the craft union. \"It is aware,\" says William\r\nEnglish Walling, \"that it will be impossible to secure a revolutionary\r\nmajority in these organizations, whether of a socialistic or of an\r\nanarchistic character, and it has imported for this contingency\r\nthe French syndicalistic theory of the power of the 'militant\r\nminority.'\"[539] A number of the anarchists were inclined to favor the\r\nSyndicalist League because they feared the \"centralized government\" of\r\nthe I. W. W.[540]\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be well to note here the organization in\r\nNew York City in October, 1912, of the Syndicalist Educational League\r\nwith Hippolyte Havel, secretary, and Harry Kelly, treasurer. This,\r\nwe are informed, \"is an organization of active propagandists formed\r\nfor the purpose of spreading the idea of syndicalism, direct-action\r\nand the general-strike among the organized and unorganized workers of\r\nAmerica.\"[541]\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the trial of the MacNamara brothers for the dynamiting of the\r\n_Los Angeles Times_ building was stirring the country. The I. W. W.\r\nso vigorously championed the cause of the indicted men that the _San\r\nFrancisco Chronicle_ was moved to say:\r\n\r\n    ... Now comes every socialist agitator and every rascal who\r\n    calls himself a socialist, and declares that even the arrest\r\n    of the indicted men is an \"outrage.\" That hobo gang which\r\n    calls itself the \"Industrial Workers of the World\" calls for a\r\n    \"general strike\" as a protest against the alleged \"kidnapping\"\r\n    of the men who have been indicted.[542]\r\n\r\nA few days later the _Industrial Worker_ carried in capitals on the\r\nfront page the following\r\n\r\n                    OFFICIAL I. W. W. PROCLAMATION!\r\n\r\n           \"AROUSE! PREPARE TO DEFEND YOUR CLASS!\"\r\n\r\n    \"A general strike in all industries must be the answer of the\r\n    workers to the challenge of the masters! Tie up all industries!\r\n    Tie up all production! Eternal vigilance is the price of\r\n    liberty.\" Issued Apr. 25, 1911, by the Industrial Workers of\r\n    the World.[543]\r\n\r\nWhen the seventh convention met in 1912 the General Executive Board\r\ndeclared that the MacNamara case \"demonstrated beyond doubt that no\r\nlegal safeguard can be invoked to protect any member of the working\r\nclass who incurs the enmity of the employers by standing between them\r\nand unlimited exploitation of the workers.\" Furthermore, it charged\r\nthat the A. F. of L. \"did not come to their assistance as it should\r\nhave done ... [because] the moral support guaranteed these members\r\nof the working class was practically _nil_ so far as the American\r\nFederation of Labor was concerned.\"[544]\r\n\r\nThese militant utterances of the I. W. W. served to increase a growing\r\nhostility to that organization in the Socialist party. This increasing\r\nopposition was directed against the methods and tactics of I. W.\r\nW.-ism rather than against its criticism of capitalist society, its\r\nform or organization or its idea of the character of the society of\r\nthe future. The Socialists objected in general to the whole philosophy\r\nof direct action, and more particularly to certain phases of direct\r\naction--_viz._, the use of _sabotage_ and violence in general.\r\n\r\nOne I. W. W. official defines direct action as the \"withdrawal of labor\r\npower or efficiency from the place or object of production.\"[545]\r\nEmma Goldman, a prominent anarchist, describes it as the \"conscious\r\nindividual or collective effort to protest against or remedy social\r\nconditions through the systematic assertion of the economic power\r\nof the workers.\"[546] Professor Hubert Lagardelle, one of the\r\n_intellectuels_ of the French syndicalist movement, explains that\r\n\"Direct Action is opposed to the indirect and legalized action of\r\ndemocracy, of Parliament and of parties. It means that instead of\r\ndelegating to others the function of action (following the habit of\r\ndemocracy), the working class is determined to work for itself.\"[547]\r\n_Sabotage_ has been defined by the leading English Syndicalist, Tom\r\nMann, as \"the taking of advantage for personal or class gain.\"[548]\r\nPouget says that \"le sabotage est la mise en pratique da la maxime: à\r\nmauvaise paye, mauvais travail.\"[549] In its mildest form sabotage is\r\nsimply the time-honored trade-union practice--restriction of output.\r\nGustav Hervé, the editor of _La Guerre Sociale_, advocates its use as\r\na kind of _gymnastique révolutionnaire_ or training for the revolution\r\nwhich many socialists believe may be precipitated by the violence of\r\nthe capitalists, in the guise, perhaps, of martial law. It may be\r\nconvenient to think of direct action as the _inclusive_ term. Thus it\r\nmay take the form of concerted abstention from work and be simply a\r\nstrike, or it may take the form of working \"in a way detrimental to the\r\nboss\" and be one kind of _sabotage_.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of the I. W. W.'s press campaign for the methods\r\nof _sabotage_ and direct action was furnished when in the summer of\r\n1913 the I. W. W. locals of Los Angeles began the publication of a\r\nsemi-official weekly paper called _The Wooden Shoe_. This name was\r\nselected on the strength of the legend that the word _sabotage_ was\r\ncoined in France when a workman with a grievance threw his _sabot_\r\nor wooden shoe into the machinery and so clogged it and stopped\r\nproduction. This kind of direct action is picturesquely advocated on\r\nthe front page of each issue of this paper. Grouped around the title\r\nheading--_The Wooden Shoe_--are the following boxed mottoes and slogans:\r\n\r\n  \"A kick in time saves nine.\"\r\n  \"Kick your way out of wage slavery.\"\r\n  \"Our coat-of-arms: The shoe rampant.\"\r\n  \"A kick on the job is worth ten at the ballot-box.\"\r\n  \"Immediate demands: Wooden shoes on all jobs.\"\r\n  \"The foot in the wooden shoe will rock the world.\"\r\n  \"An injury to one is the concern of all.\"\r\n\r\nThese tactics had been more and more _talked about_ if not practised\r\nby the I. W. W. for several years past. Indeed, it is safe to say\r\nthat the practical application of those forms of direct action which\r\nthe \"Wobblies\" consider expedient was becoming constantly more\r\ngeneral. When the Socialists met in convention at Indianapolis in\r\nMay, 1912, the problem of the proper attitude for the Socialist party\r\nto take toward the I. W. W., and more especially toward the \"direct\r\naction\" propaganda, was made the occasion of a violent controversy.\r\nThe discussion centered on a motion to insert a new clause in the\r\nconstitution of the Socialist party providing (in Article II, Sec.\r\n6) that \"any member of the party who opposes political action or\r\nadvocates crime, _sabotage_, or other methods of violence as a weapon\r\nof the working class to aid in its emancipation shall be expelled from\r\nmembership in the party....\"[550] After a long debate the amendment was\r\nadopted by a vote of 191 to 90, and the now famous Article II., Sec. 6,\r\nbecame a party law.[551] During the discussion there were some quite\r\nviolent criticisms made of direct action and violence. Delegate W. R.\r\nGaylord said: \"We do not want any of it. None of it! We don't want the\r\ntouch of it on us. We do not want the hint of it connected with us.\r\nWe repudiate it in every fibre of us.\"[552] Victor Berger expressed\r\nhimself very emphatically on the \"sabotage clause.\"\r\n\r\n    I desire to say [he declared] that articles in the _Industrial\r\n    Worker_, of Spokane, the official organ of the I. W. W.,\r\n    breathe the same spirit, are as anarchistic as anything\r\n    that John Most has ever written. I want to say to you,\r\n    comrades, that I for one do not believe in murder as a\r\n    means of propaganda; I do not believe in theft as a means\r\n    of expropriation; nor in a continuous riot as a free-speech\r\n    agitation. Every true Socialist will agree with me when\r\n    I say that those who believe that we should substitute\r\n    \"Hallelujah, I'm a bum\" for the _Marseillaise_, and for the\r\n    _Internationale_, should start a \"bum organization\" of their\r\n    own. (Loud laughter and great cheering.)[553]\r\n\r\nIt was not alone the advocacy of \"direct action\" which incurred for the\r\nI. W. W. the enmity of the Socialists. The latter felt that when the\r\nI. W. W. in 1908 \"repudiated political action,\" it really declared war\r\non the Socialist party. That party obviously could not consistently\r\napprove of the Detroit I. W. W. because that faction was really the\r\nward of a rival political organization, the Socialist Labor party.\r\nErnest Untermann, who was one of the founders of the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World, said at a previous convention of the Socialist party:\r\n\"When we organized the I. W. W., we hoped that it would be both a\r\npolitical and an economic organization.... Instead of that, from the\r\nvery outside there crept in an element that made for disintegration,\r\nand today the I. W. W. has drifted back toward syndicalism.\"[554] He\r\ndeclared, moreover, that the I. W. W. deeply in debt to the Socialist\r\nparty, as he intimated, had ungratefully obstructed the work of the\r\nparty:\r\n\r\n    We helped the I. W. W. in its fight for free speech in Spokane\r\n    and for working-class power on the coast, [he said] and yet\r\n    while our speakers were collecting money [in San Francisco] ...\r\n    to help the I. W. W., the fighters from the I. W. W. were on\r\n    the outside of our meetings and knocking.... They sent their\r\n    fighters over to Local Oakland, right across the bay, with the\r\n    avowed purpose of breaking up that local and destroying the\r\n    activity of the Socialist party.... I shall be true to the\r\n    principle of industrial unionism, but the I. W. W. can go to\r\n    hell. (Applause.)[555]\r\n\r\nFinally the last tie that connected the I. W. W. with the Socialist\r\nparty was broken when, in February, 1913, William D. Haywood was\r\nrecalled from the National Executive Committee of the party.[556]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[509] _Cf._ Appendix iv, Table A.

Australia led off with the \"Unlawful Associations Act\"\r\npassed by the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth in December,\r\n1916. (Reported in the _New York Times_, December 20, 1916, p. 5. col.\r\n2. Cf. _infra_, p. 341.) Within three months of the passage of the\r\nAustralian Act, the American States of Minnesota and Idaho passed laws\r\n\"defining criminal syndicalism and prohibiting the advocacy thereof.\"\r\nIn February, 1918, the Montana legislature met in extraordinary session\r\nand enacted a similar statute. (These three state laws are printed in\r\nappendix x.) _Vide_ also _infra_, pp. 344-6.\r\n\r\nAt Sacramento, on January 16, 1919, according to daily press reports,\r\nall of the 46 defendants in the California I. W. W. conspiracy case\r\ntried there in the Federal District Court were found guilty of\r\nconspiring to violate the Constitution of the United States and the\r\nEspionage Act and with attempting to obstruct the war activities of the\r\nGovernment. All of the defendants were members--or alleged members--of\r\nthe I. W. W. and the case is similar to the one tried in Chicago in\r\n1918. On January 17 Judge Rudkin is reported to have sentenced 43 of\r\nthe defendants to prison terms of from one to ten years (_New York\r\nTimes_, January 17 and 18, 1919.) The trial is reported in _The Nation_\r\nof January 25, 1919. _Cf. supra_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE AND THE CREST OF POWER (1912)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1912 marks the high tide of I. W. W. activity. From Lawrence,\r\nMassachusetts, to San Diego, California, these restless militants\r\nstirred the nation with their startling strike and free-speech\r\npropaganda. Reports of strikes and free-speech activities in\r\n_Solidarity_ and the _Industrial Worker_ show a higher frequency for\r\nboth these types of industrial warfare in 1912 and 1913 than for any\r\nother corresponding period in the organization's career. During the\r\nyears 1911, 1912 and 1913 there were some fifteen free-speech fights\r\nof considerable importance--more than have been staged in all the rest\r\nof its history before or since.[557] The dynamic prominence of this\r\nperiod is less marked for the free-speech propaganda than for the then\r\nstrange and novel syndicalist strike propaganda of the I. W. W. The\r\nstrike activities were, however, confined quite largely to a shorter\r\nperiod--1912 and 1913. As already noted,[558] the years 1909 and 1910\r\nwere more crowded with I. W. W. strike activities than any previous\r\nperiod. These fat propaganda and lean organizing years were followed\r\nby twelve months of a general all-round leanness which was only saved\r\nfrom complete sterility by about half a dozen rather lively free-speech\r\nfights. Then followed the \"Wobblies'\" two big years, during which more\r\nthan thirty \"I. W. W. strikes\"[559] ran their course in different\r\nparts of the country. In Table 3 are given what facts are available\r\nconcerning I. W. W. strike activities in 1912.\r\n\r\nOvershadowing all others in importance was the gigantic strike of the\r\ntextile workers at Lawrence. This great struggle set new fashions in\r\nstrike methods. It Americanized the words, \"sabotage,\" \"direct action,\"\r\nand \"syndicalism\" and revealed to the hitherto ignorant public the\r\nmanner and effectiveness with which these alleged French importations\r\ncould be applied to an existing industrial situation. Lawrence,\r\ntogether with San Diego, and one or two other \"free-speech\" cities,\r\nreally introduced the Industrial Workers of the World to the American\r\npublic. The organization and its activities were known to students of\r\nthe labor problem and to others who happened to be on the spot when a\r\nfight was on, but they were not known to the great body of citizens.\r\nLawrence and the free-speech fights made the name of this little group\r\nof intransigents a household word, hardly less talked about and no whit\r\nbetter understood than the words \"socialist\" and \"anarchist.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 11, about 14,000 of the textile operatives left their work.\r\nDuring the strike, which continued until March 14, this number was\r\nincreased to 23,000. According to a Federal report, \"the immediate\r\ncause of the strike was a reduction in earnings, growing out of the\r\nState law which became effective January 1, 1912, and which reduced the\r\nhours of employment for women, and for children under 18 years of age\r\nfrom 56 to 54 hours per week.\"[560] At the beginning of the struggle\r\nonly a small minority of the operatives were organized.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.\r\n\r\nI.

A few of the skilled crafts,\r\n    composed principally of English-speaking workers, had their own\r\n    separate organizations, but the 10 crafts thus organized had at\r\n    the time of the strike only approximately 2,500 members. The\r\n    Industrial Workers of the World had also some years before this\r\n    established an organization in Lawrence. At the beginning of\r\n    the strike they claimed a membership of approximately 1,000.\r\n    They had at different times names on their rolls in excess\r\n    of this number, but it is estimated by active members of the\r\n    organization that at the beginning of January, 1912, there\r\n    were not more than 300 paid-up members on the rolls of the\r\n    Industrial Workers.[563]\r\n\r\nThis statement of the situation is borne out by Mr. John Golden's\r\ntestimony before the House Committee on Rules. He said that when the\r\nstrike broke out, \"according to the official books of the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World, they had 287 members.\"[564]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the strike there were many violent demonstrations\r\nand numerous acts of violence on the part of deputies, police, and\r\nmilitiamen, as well as on the part of the strikers. Early in the\r\nstrike, Joseph J. Ettor and Wm. D. Haywood, both I. W. W. officials,\r\ncame to Lawrence and thereafter figured prominently in the conduct\r\nof the strike, preaching \"solidarity,\" \"passive resistance,\" \"direct\r\naction,\" and \"sabotage\" as means to victory. The daily press reports of\r\nthe strike greatly exaggerated the violence of the strikers and almost\r\nuniformly neglected to mention acts of violence on the other side.\r\nIn the I. W. W. press the situation was reversed, and the lawlessness\r\nof the constituted authorities greatly overdrawn. A writer who is,\r\nat any rate, not sympathetic with the I. W. W. describes the strike\r\nactivities. He says that shortly after five o'clock (a.m., January 29,\r\n1912), when it was still dark, an attack was made upon the street-cars,\r\nduring which the trolleys were pulled off the feed-wire, the windows\r\nsmashed with chunks of ice, the motormen and conductors driven off,\r\nand the passengers in some cases not allowed to leave the cars, and\r\nin others, pulled from the cars and thrown into the streets.[565] And\r\nwhile conferences were still going on, according to the same authority,\r\nthe leaders of the Industrial Workers of the World\r\n\r\n    made a determined effort, by violence and intimidation of\r\n    various sorts to prevent those wishing to resume work from\r\n    reaching the mills. The endless chain system of picketing\r\n    was put into force, and women ... who did not work in the\r\n    mills, along with \"strong arm\" men, were pressed into service.\r\n    Women were assaulted by men, and pepper thrown in the eyes of\r\n    operatives and police officers. Early in the morning powerful\r\n    men followed, threatened, and seized girls on their way to the\r\n    mills, twisting their wrists, snatching their luncheons, and\r\n    terrorizing them generally. During the night strangers visited\r\n    the homes of the workers and threatened to cut their throats if\r\n    they persisted in going to work....[566]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is fairly conclusive evidence that the advent\r\nof Ettor and Haywood resulted, if not in the entire elimination of\r\nviolent tactics, at least in their marked reduction and shifting of\r\nemphasis to the tactics of passive resistance. According to one who\r\nwas on the spot, the riots occurred\r\n\r\n    before Ettor's organization was effected, when the strikers\r\n    gathered about the mills as an organized mob and mill bosses\r\n    turned streams of water upon them in zero weather. After the\r\n    \"blood-stained anarchists\" arrived on the scene, a policy of\r\n    non-resistance to the aggressions of the police and the militia\r\n    prevailed.[567]\r\n\r\nHowsoever passive the strikers may have been in their attitude to the\r\npolice and the militia, they were probably quite aggressive in their\r\ncampaign to win recruits to the ranks of the strikers. A Lawrence mill\r\noverseer reports that the I. W. W. strike committee[568] did it in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n    The addresses of the men working are given to a committee. They\r\n    are visited after nine o'clock at night by strangers, generally\r\n    Poles: \"Working today?\" \"Yah.\" (The man speaking has a sharp\r\n    knife and is whittling a stick.) \"Work tomorrow?\" \"I d'no.\" \"If\r\n    you work tomorrow, I cut your throat.\" \"No, no. I no work.\"\r\n    \"Shake.\" And they shake hands.[569]\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence of at least one attempt on the part of\r\nthe business and commercial interests of Lawrence to discredit the\r\nstrikers. In three places in the city a total of twenty-eight sticks of\r\ndynamite were found. The strikers declared that it had been \"planted.\"\r\nLater a business man of Lawrence, who had no connection with the\r\nstrikers, was arrested and finally tried and \"convicted of conspiracy\r\nto injure by the planting of dynamite.\" He was fined $500.00![570]\r\n\r\nThere was great friction between the I. W. W. and the locals of other\r\nlabor organizations. The Socialists and I. W. W.s accused the American\r\nFederation of Labor leaders of trying to break the strike. \"All the\r\nmechanical crafts,\" we read in a pro-I. W. W. journal, \"including\r\nengineers, firemen, electrical workers, machinists and railroaders ...\r\nremained at work, scabbing on their fellows with the full sanction ...\r\nof their officials.\"[571] In the face of this antagonism the rank and\r\nfile of the A. F. of L. membership contributed liberally to the strike\r\nfund, giving about $11,000 to the cause of the strikers. Socialist\r\ncontributions are placed at $40,000 and those of the I. W. W. local\r\nunions at $16,000.[572] The Federal investigators report that \"these\r\nrelief funds came from all sections of the country and average $1,000 a\r\nday throughout the strike.\"[573]\r\n\r\nThe Lawrence strike furnished the opportunity for some parading of the\r\nidea of a general strike. William D. Haywood, in his first speech to\r\nthe strikers after his arrival in Lawrence, said: \"If we prevail on\r\nother workers who handle your goods to help you out by going on strike,\r\nwe will tie up the railroads, put the city in darkness and starve the\r\nsoldiers out.\"[574] This agitation became more vigorous, however, after\r\nthe strike itself and during the subsequent trial of the two I. W. W.\r\nagitators, Ettor and Giovannitti.\r\n\r\nThey were in jail at Salem, Massachusetts, at the time of the seventh\r\nI. W. W. convention in September, 1912, and the General Executive\r\nBoard, in its report, threatened that unless these \"fellow-workers are\r\nacquitted the industries of this country will feel the power of the\r\nworkers expressed in a general tie-up in all industries....\"[575]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general strike, a boycott was demanded. Under the\r\ncaption, \"Boycott Lawrence,\" a heavily headlined announcement was\r\nprinted on the front page of the _Industrial Worker_.[576] It ran in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    _Boycott Lawrence.... Railroad men: Lose their cars for them!\r\n    Telegraphers: Lose their messages for them! Expressmen: Lose\r\n    their packages for them! Boycott Lawrence! Boycott it to the\r\n    limit!..._\r\n\r\n    Let nothing, cars, messages, packages, mails or anything\r\n    whatsoever that bears the sign, label or address of an official\r\n    of the Wool Trust, or of a bank, business house, or prostituted\r\n    newspaper, which favors them, or of a judge, policeman or\r\n    cossack, or any one who lends the slightest aid to the\r\n    mill-owners, go on its way undisturbed!\r\n\r\n                       _Boycott Lawrence!_\r\n\r\n    Against the bludgeons of _Industrial Despotism_ bring the\r\n    silent might of the _Industrial Democracy_!\r\n\r\n                       _Boycott Lawrence!_\r\n\r\nThe result of the strike was a decided victory for the strikers. The\r\nFederal government's investigators reported that\r\n\r\n    some 30,000 textile mill employees in Lawrence secured\r\n    an increase in wages of from 5 to 20 per cent; increased\r\n    compensation for overtime; and the reduction of the premium\r\n    period from four weeks to two weeks. Also, as an indirect\r\n    result of the Lawrence strike, material increases in wages\r\n    were granted to thousands of employees in other textile mills\r\n    throughout New England.[577]\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that the highest percentages of increases in\r\nwages were given to the unskilled employees. The General Executive\r\nBoard of the I. W. W. reported the range of wage increases as being\r\n\"from 5 per cent for the highly paid workers to 25 per cent for the\r\nlowest paid workers.\"[578] Moreover, there were other effects, no\r\nless important. This strike demonstrated that it was possible for\r\nthe unskilled and unorganized workers (preponderantly immigrants of\r\nvarious nationalities) to carry on a successful struggle with their\r\nemployers. It showed what latent power there is in the great masses\r\nof semi-skilled and unskilled workers. Moreover, it demonstrated the\r\npower of a new type of labor leaders over the ignorant and unskilled\r\nimmigrant workers. A writer who has little sympathy for revolutionary\r\nunionism says concerning Joseph J. Ettor:\r\n\r\n    This man ... steeped in the literature of revolutionary\r\n    socialism and anarchism, swayed the undisciplined mob as\r\n    completely as any general ever controlled the disciplined\r\n    troops ... [and was able] to organize these thousands\r\n    of heterogeneous, heretofore unsympathetic and jealous\r\n    nationalities, into a militant body of class-conscious workers.\r\n    His followers firmly believed, as they were told, that success\r\n    meant that they were about to enter a new era of brotherhood,\r\n    in which there would be no more union of trades and no more\r\n    departmental distinctions, but all workers would become the\r\n    real bosses in the mills.[579]\r\n\r\nThe Lawrence Citizens' Association reports that Ettor\r\n\r\n    avowed himself an advocate of the doctrine of \"direct action,\"\r\n    of violence, as a believer in the philosophy of force, for he\r\n    proclaimed time and again ... that \"he who has force on his\r\n    side has the law on his side.\" He also advocated destroying the\r\n    machinery of employers who did not grant all the demands of the\r\n    strikers.[580]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the strike on the membership of the I. W. W. in Lawrence\r\nwas to increase it greatly but only temporarily. Just after the\r\nstrike the organizers claimed 14,000 members in Lawrence. In October,\r\n1913, there were 700.[581] An investigator for the Federal Commission\r\non Industrial Relations reports that they had over 10,000 members\r\nimmediately after the strike.[582] The I. W. W. itself claimed 20,000\r\nin Lawrence in June, 1912, as well as 28,000 in Lowell, and boasted\r\nthat \"in nearly every town in the New England states there are locals\r\nranging from 800 to 5,000 in membership.\"[583] The Federal investigator\r\nreferred to puts the Lawrence membership of the I. W. W. in 1914 at\r\nabout 400 and says that local I. W. W. officials attribute this low\r\nfigure to unemployment, but he himself thinks that other factors\r\nentered.[584] The wage increase gained was, he said, offset by the\r\nincreased speed required on the machines.\r\n\r\nThis amounted to 50 per cent. Another factor was the forced scattering\r\nof I. W. W. leaders after the strike. He found in 1914 only one of\r\neight local I. W. W. leaders who were there at the time of the strike\r\nand reports that the employers established a system of espionage in the\r\nmills.[585]\r\n\r\nLawrence made the I. W. W. famous, especially in the East. It stirred\r\nthe country with the alarming slogans of a new kind of revolution.\r\nSocialism was respectable--even reactionary--by comparison. The\r\n\"Wobblies\" frankly abjured the rules under which, as they would\r\nexpress it, the capitalist game is played. They said: \"If it serves\r\nour interests as members of the working class to obey certain accepted\r\ncanons of conduct, we will obey them because it would be detrimental\r\nto our class to disobey them.\" Lawrence was not an ordinary strike.\r\nIt was a social revolution _in parvo_. St. John is said to have\r\nwritten to Haywood, \"a win in the Lawrence mills means the start that\r\nwill only end with the downfall of the wage system.\"[586] This was\r\na class war and the I. W. W. insists that the principle of military\r\nnecessity justifies it in a policy of _schrecklichkeit_, at least to\r\nproperty, which on the syndicalist hypothesis was stolen anyway, in\r\nthe beginning. The I. W. W. abjures current ethics and morality as\r\n_bourgeois_, and therefore inimical to the exploited proletarian for\r\nwhom a new and approved system of proletarian morality is set forth.\r\nIn this proletarian code the sanctions of conduct are founded on the\r\n(material) interests of the proletarian, _as such_. The criterion is\r\nexpediency--effectiveness to one particular end, the overthrow of\r\nthe wage system and the establishment of--something else--the words\r\n_industrial democracy_ or _coöperative commonwealth_ are commonly\r\nused in reference to that nebulous future state that all radicals\r\nsee as in a glass, more or less darkly. This means that staid old\r\nNew England was confronted with an organization which derided all\r\nher fond moralities. The most shocking _défi_ of these I. W. W.s was\r\nthe _défi_ they hurled at the church. Only less so was the _défi_\r\nthey leveled at the flag. The I. W. W. said that the church, obedient\r\nto the dictates of big business, preached to the workers a servile\r\nobedience now for the sake of a hypothetical heaven of comfort later;\r\n\"_ergo_,\" they said, \"the church is unethical and we abjure it for a\r\nsuperior proletarian ethics.\" It considered that the flag was being\r\nmade the excuse for a jingo patriotism which made the enlargement and\r\nconquest of markets and the further exploitation of labor the end and\r\naim of patriotism. In brief, the church and the flag are made to serve\r\ncommercialism. Commercialism is evil because unjust. Therefore, its\r\nservants are, _pro tanto_, evil also and rightly to be repudiated.\r\n\r\nThe conflicting attitudes are well illustrated by two placards carried\r\nalong Lawrence streets during the strike. The I. W. W. paraded first\r\nwith, among others, a placard reading:\r\n\r\n    XX Century civilization.... For the progress of the human race\r\n    we have jails, gallows, guillotines, ... and electric chairs\r\n    for the people who pay to keep the \"_soldiers_\" to kill them\r\n    when they revolt against Wood and other czars of capitalism.\r\n\r\n                  _Arise!!! Slaves of the World!!!\r\n                          No God! No Master!\r\n                   One for all and all for one!_\r\n\r\nThe citizens (no reference here to the textile operatives) of Lawrence\r\nparaded their righteous indignation as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"For God and Country,\r\n    The Stars and Stripes forever,\r\n    The Red Flag never.\r\n    A Protest against the I. W. W.,\r\n    Its principles and methods.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no better illustration of the reaction of the great\r\nbulk of the progressive citizenship of the country to the I. W. W.\r\nstrike-drama than the following editorial paragraph published during\r\nthe strike:\r\n\r\n    On all sides people are asking: Is this a new thing in the\r\n    industrial world?... Are we to see another serious, perhaps\r\n    successful, attempt to organize labor by whole industrial\r\n    groups instead of by trades? Are we to expect that instead of\r\n    playing the game respectably, or else frankly breaking out into\r\n    lawless riot which we know well enough how to deal with, the\r\n    laborers are to listen to a subtle anarchistic philosophy which\r\n    challenges the fundamental idea of law and order, inculcating\r\n    such strange doctrines as those of \"direct action,\" \"sabotage,\"\r\n    \"syndicalism,\" \"the general strike,\" and \"violence\"?... We\r\n    think that our whole current morality as to the sacredness of\r\n    property and even of life is involved in it.[587]\r\n\r\nAt the seventh convention held in Chicago in September, 1912, there\r\nwere present forty-five industrialists; twenty-nine of these being\r\ndelegates from as many regular local unions; one delegate each\r\nrepresented the two National Industrial Unions which were component\r\nparts of the I. W. W., viz., the Textile Workers and the Forest and\r\nLumber Workers; seven were General Executive Board members, and seven\r\n\"fraternal delegates\" from the Brotherhood of Timber Workers. Locals in\r\neight states and in British Columbia were represented.[588] During the\r\ntime the convention was in session, Joseph J. Ettor, a member of the\r\nGeneral Executive Board, was awaiting trial in the Essex County jail in\r\nSalem, Mass. He wrote to the delegates that\r\n\r\n    all of the past term's progress is mainly due to the policies\r\n    adopted, particularly by the sixth annual convention, and ...\r\n    I feel it an urgent duty on my part to advise that as much\r\n    as conditions will allow, the lines laid down by the last\r\n    convention be ratified....[589]\r\n\r\nThe General Executive Board specifically recommended to the convention\r\nthe use of direct action as a weapon of the working class.\r\n\r\n    The only effective weapon that the workers have with which\r\n    to meet this condition [runs the Board's report] is to [sic]\r\n    render unproductive the machinery of production with which\r\n    they labor, and have access to. Militant direct action in the\r\n    industries of the world is the weapon upon which they must rely\r\n    and which they must learn to use.[590]\r\n\r\nWith the growing interests of the I. W. W. in the workers in the\r\nagricultural and lumber industries came a realization of the need\r\nfor some kind of a land policy. Delegate Covington Hall presented a\r\npetition which was adopted as a resolution by the convention:\r\n\r\n    Why not ... proclaim today [the resolution asks] what we will\r\n    be compelled to proclaim tomorrow--a land policy? Why not\r\n    base this policy on the motto of the Russian peasant, \"Whose\r\n    the sweat, his the land,\" and couple this with a new I. W. W.\r\n    motto: \"Whose the sweat, theirs the machines\"? In other words,\r\n    proclaim that we will recognize no title to machinery except\r\n    that which vests its ownership in the users.[591]\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect of this convention was the sentiment which\r\nwas evidenced by some of the delegates in favor of reducing the power\r\nof the national administration--the central office--often referred to\r\nin this and following conventions as \"Headquarters.\" This agitation\r\nfor decentralization was not particularly successful, but the idea\r\nwas given a hearing. At the following convention a much more extended\r\ndiscussion took place and the subject will be resumed in connection\r\nwith the discussion of that meeting.[592] At this 1912 meeting the\r\nquestion of decentralization came up in the discussion of a motion\r\nto give the General Executive Board jurisdiction over the calling,\r\nmanagement and settlement of all free-speech fights. The alleged object\r\nof the motion was to restrict the number of such controversies. The\r\n\"Wobblies\" had been even more inclined to overindulge in free-speech\r\nfights than in strikes, and some thought this appetite might be kept\r\nin better control if it were made more difficult for locals to get\r\nsupport for such struggles from the national office. The motion was\r\nlost by an overwhelming majority. The vote expressed a significant\r\nreaction from the traditional I. W. W. policy of centralization. That\r\nthe latter policy was still strong was indicated in the overwhelming\r\ndefeat of motions to deprive the General Executive Board of its power\r\nover the strike activities of the organization.[593] The policy of the\r\nconvention was centralist on strike and decentralist on free-speech\r\nfights. The editor of _The Agitator_, an anarchist exponent of\r\nindustrial unionism, believes that this was due to the fact that\r\nthe I. W. W. had had much experience of \"free-speech fighting\" and\r\nrealized the need for local autonomy, whereas it had had limited strike\r\nexperience and so had \"not yet learned the danger of allowing a few\r\nmen ... to control its strike activities.\" The writer imagines that\r\ngeography was also a factor. The proponents of continued centralization\r\nof strike power were the more disciplined eastern members. The\r\ndefenders of local autonomy in free-speech fights were the western\r\n\"Wobblies,\" and the nature of their life and experience bred in them\r\nmuch of the anarchistic spirit of individualism.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Labor party and the doctrinaires of Detroit thought\r\nthat this convention was a very insignificant gathering. One of the\r\nDeLeonites described it: \"About thirty men acting in the capacity of\r\ndelegates and about a score of onlookers, leaning with their backs\r\nagainst the walls leisurely smoking their pipes or chewing tobacco....\r\nThis constituted the convention....\"[594] It is interpreted differently\r\nby one who is with the direct-actionists at least in sympathy. He says:\r\n\r\n    It is a significant proof of the sound base of the I. W. W.\r\n    philosophy that the tremendous growth of the past year has\r\n    not brought with it the germ of opportunism. There was no\r\n    suggestion of a desire on the part of any of the delegates\r\n    to swerve from the uncompromising and revolutionary attitude\r\n    of the organization; nor was there any reaching out for\r\n    \"respectability.\" Every man was a \"Red,\" most of them with jail\r\n    records, too.... All striving ... to hasten the day when \"the\r\n    whistle will blow for the Boss to go to work.\"[595]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[557] _Cf._ appendix vii.\r\n\r\n[558] _Supra_, p. 261 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[559] An \"I.

Even before his visit a growing minority had\r\nbeen feebly protesting against the accepted I. W. W. policy of creating\r\na new organization without regard to existing labor (or craft) unions\r\nin the locality instead of allowing the unorganized--and especially\r\nthe radicals--to enter the old unions (of the A. F. of L.) and\r\n\"bore from within\" their conservative shells to let in the light of\r\nrevolutionary industrial unionism. This renewed interest was largely\r\ndue to the exchange of ideas with European radicals at international\r\ncongresses. The policy in Europe and in England has been precisely\r\n\"the boring from within\" policy, and European unions--especially the\r\n_Confédération Générale du Travail_ of France--has prospered by it\r\nboth in numbers and influence. In 1911, William Z. Foster, a member\r\nof the I. W. W., visited Europe and made a careful examination of the\r\nlabor organizations there. He returned fully convinced that the I. W.\r\nW. should change its policy on \"dual unionism\" and begin to \"bore from\r\nwithin\" the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the proposal of his name for the office of editor of\r\nthe _Industrial Worker_ he sent a letter on the subject to that paper.\r\nHe makes such a cogent exposition of the case against dual unionism\r\nthat the greater part of it is here given:\r\n\r\n    The question, \"Why don't the I. W. W. grow?\" is being asked\r\n    on every hand, as well within our ranks as without. And\r\n    justly, too, as only the blindest enthusiast is satisfied at\r\n    the progress, or rather lack of progress, of the organization\r\n    to date. In spite of truly heroic efforts on the part of our\r\n    organizers and members in general ... the I. W. W. remains\r\n    small in membership and weak in influence. It is indeed time to\r\n    examine the situation and discover what is wrong.\r\n\r\n    The founders of the I. W. W. at its inception gave the\r\n    organization the working theory that in order to create a\r\n    revolutionary labor movement, it was necessary to build a new\r\n    organization separate and apart from the existing craft unions\r\n    which were considered incapable of development. This theory and\r\n    its consequent tactics has persisted in the organization, and\r\n    we later comers have inherited them and, without any serious\r\n    investigation, accepted the theory as an infallible dogma.\r\n    Parrot-like and unthinking, we glibly re-echo the sentiment\r\n    that \"craft unions cannot become revolutionary unions,\" and\r\n    usually consider the question undebatable. Convincing arguments\r\n    in favor of the theory I have never seen nor heard--I used to\r\n    accept it without question like the vast majority of the I.\r\n    W. W. membership does now, and in practice it has achieved\r\n    the negative results shown by the I. W. W. today with its\r\n    membership of but a few thousands. The theory's strength is\r\n    due to its being the one originally adopted by the founders of\r\n    the I. W. W., and to me this is but a poor recommendation, as\r\n    these same founders, in addition to giving us a constitution\r\n    manifestly inadequate to our needs and the changing and\r\n    ignoring of which occupies a large share of our time, made\r\n    the monumental mistake of trying to harmonize all the various\r\n    conflicting elements among them into one \"Happy Family\"\r\n    revolutionary organization--a blunder which cost the I. W.\r\n    W. three years of internal strife to rectify and one that\r\n    gives these founders--who have mostly quit the organization,\r\n    anything but an infallible reputation. And if we look about us\r\n    a little, at the labor movements of other countries in addition\r\n    to considering our own experiences, we will be more inclined\r\n    to question this theory that we have so long accepted as the\r\n    natural one for the revolutionary labor movement. It has been\r\n    applied in other countries and with similar results as here.\r\n\r\n    The German syndicalist movement, with a practically stationary\r\n    membership of about 15,000, is a pigmy compared to the giant\r\n    and rapidly growing socialist unions with their 2,300,000\r\n    members. The English I. W. W. is ridiculously small and weak;\r\n    the German syndicalist organization, the English I. W. W. and\r\n    the American I. W. W., using the same dual organization tactics\r\n    in the three greatest capitalist countries, are all afflicted\r\n    with a common stagnation and lack of influence in the labor\r\n    movement. On the other hand, in those countries where the\r\n    syndicalists use the despised \"boring from within\" tactics,\r\n    their revolutionary movements are vigorous and powerful.\r\n    France offers the most conspicuous example. There the C. G. T.\r\n    militants, inspired by the tactics of the anarchists who years\r\n    ago, discontented at their lack of success as an independent\r\n    movement, literally made a raid on the labor movement, captured\r\n    it and revolutionized it, and in so doing developed the new\r\n    working-class theory of syndicalism, have for one of their\r\n    cardinal principles to introduce [_sic_] competition in the\r\n    labor movement by creating dual organizations. By propagating\r\n    their doctrines in the old unions and forcing them to become\r\n    revolutionary, they have made their labor movement the most\r\n    feared one in the world. In Spain and Italy, where the rebels\r\n    are more and more copying French tactics, the syndicalist\r\n    movements are growing rapidly in power and influence. But it\r\n    is in England where we have the most striking example of the\r\n    comparative effectiveness of the two varieties of tactics. For\r\n    several years the English I. W. W. with its dual-organization\r\n    theory carried on a practically barren agitation. About a\r\n    year ago, Tom Mann, Guy Bowman and a few other revolutionists,\r\n    using the French \"boring from within\" tactics, commenced in the\r\n    face of a strong I. W. W. opposition to work on the old trades\r\n    unions, which Debs had called impossible. Some of the fruits of\r\n    their labors were seen in the recent series of great strikes in\r\n    England. The great influence of these syndicalists in causing\r\n    and giving the revolutionary character to these strikes which\r\n    sent chills along the spine of international capitalism, is\r\n    acknowledged by innumerable capitalist and revolutionary\r\n    journals alike.\r\n\r\n    Is not this striking success of \"boring from within\" after\r\n    continued failure of \"building from without\" tactics, which is\r\n    but typical of the respective results being achieved everywhere\r\n    by these tactics, worthy of the most serious consideration on\r\n    the part of the I. W. W.? Is it not time that we get up off our\r\n    knees before this time-honored dual organization dogma and give\r\n    it a thorough examination? And I'll promise--or threaten--that\r\n    if I am elected editor the matter will get as thorough an\r\n    investigation as lays in my power.... At Berlin a few months\r\n    ago Jouhaux, secretary of the C. G. T. [_Confédération Générale\r\n    du Travail_], in a large public meeting advised them to give\r\n    up their attempt to create a new movement and to get into the\r\n    conservative unions where they could make their influence felt.\r\n    At Budapest he extended the same advice to the I. W. W. _via_\r\n    myself, and I am frank to state that I am convinced that it\r\n    would be strictly good tactics for both movements to adopt it.\r\n    I am satisfied from my observations that the only way for the\r\n    I. W. W. to have the workers adopt and practice the principles\r\n    of revolutionary unionism ... is to give up its attempt to\r\n    create a new labor movement, turn itself into a propaganda\r\n    league, get into the organized labor movement and by building\r\n    up better fighting machines within the old unions than those\r\n    possessed by our reactionary enemies, revolutionize those\r\n    unions even as our French syndicalist fellow-workers have so\r\n    successfully done with theirs.[597]\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Mr. Mann, Mr. Foster again took up the cudgels for\r\nthe opponents of dual unionism.\r\n\r\n    Among many of the syndicalists [he said] the sentiment is\r\n    strong, and growing ceaselessly, that the tactics followed by\r\n    the I. W. W. are bad, and that endeavors should be made inside\r\n    the A. F. of L.; that it is in the existing unions that the\r\n    syndicalists must struggle without ceasing....[598]\r\n\r\nMr. Mann agreed with him. In a speech published in the _International\r\nSocialist Review_[599] he expressed his belief that \"if the fine\r\nenergy exhibited by the I. W. W. were put into the A. F. or L. or\r\ninto the existing trade-union movement ... the results would be\r\nfifty-fold greater than they now are.\" He went on to \"urge the\r\nadvisability, not of dropping the I. W. W., but certainly of dropping\r\nall dual organizations and serving as a feeder and purifier of the big\r\nmovement.\" William D. Haywood replied that \"it might as well be said\r\nthat if the fine energy exhibited by the I. W. W. were put into the\r\nCatholic church, that the results would be the establishment of the\r\ncontrol of industry.\"[600] He went on to show that it is well-nigh\r\nimpossible for the unskilled man to get into the A. F. of L., even when\r\nhe does desire to do so, because of what Haywood characterizes as \"a\r\nvicious system of apprenticeship, exorbitant fees,\" _etc._[601] Mr.\r\nHaywood's fellow-worker, Joseph J. Ettor, joined him in his attack on\r\nTom Mann's position:\r\n\r\n    The theory that what is needed to save the Federation is the\r\n    energetic and vigorous men who are now in the I. W. W. is on\r\n    a par with the \"socialist\" advice of [_sic_] how to save the\r\n    nation; but we don't want to save the Federation any more than\r\n    to save the nation. We aim at destroying it. The Socialists\r\n    advised us to roll up our sleeves and become active politically\r\n    within capitalism--\"We must capture the government for the\r\n    workers,\" _etc._ We tried, but the more we fooled with the\r\n    beast the more it _captured us_. Our best men went to \"bore\r\n    from within\" capitalist parliaments, and city councils, only\r\n    to be disgusted, thrown out, or fall victims of the game and\r\n    environment in which they found themselves.... We learned at an\r\n    awful cost particularly this: That the most unscrupulous labor\r\n    fakers now betraying the workers were once our \"industrialist,\"\r\n    \"anarchist\" and \"socialist\" comrades, who grew weary of the\r\n    slow progress we were making on the outside, went over, and\r\n    were not only lost, but ... became the greatest supporters of\r\n    the old and [the] most serious enemies of the new.[602]\r\n\r\nMr Mann's attitude was not appreciably changed during his trip through\r\nthe United States. His reaction to the situation so far as the\r\nprinciple of \"dual unionism\" is concerned is explained in an article\r\ncontributed to a French journal. He wrote:\r\n\r\n    As the situation appears to me after many deep conversations\r\n    and discussions with working men of all conditions, I say\r\n    very emphatically that the I. W. W. should work in harmony\r\n    with the American Federation of Labor. There is not the least\r\n    necessity for having two organizations. The field of action is\r\n    wide enough for all to be able to coöperate in the economic\r\n    struggle....\r\n\r\n    The greatest danger to which it [the A. F. of L.] is subject\r\n    at present is the firm hold the politicians have on it. Their\r\n    influence grows in the unions as well as in the Federation, and\r\n    that because the energetic, militant, enthusiastic men (_les\r\n    hommes énergiques et ardents_) who comprise the I. W. W. refuse\r\n    to work on the inside of the unions, so that they leave a free\r\n    field to the politicians, to whom the task becomes relatively\r\n    easy.... We know what comes to pass when politicians get\r\n    control of the unions and direct them.[603]\r\n\r\nIn reporting the eighth convention of the \"Bummery\" I. W. W., the\r\n_Weekly People_[604] declared that the St. John crowd was in control\r\nand that a wooden shoe was made use of in calling the convention in\r\norder and attempting to maintain it in order. This meeting continued\r\nin session from the 15th to the 29th of September, 1913. There were\r\npresent thirty-nine delegates and the seven members of the Executive\r\nBoard. Three national industrial unions were represented: the Textile\r\nWorkers by two delegates having thirty-one votes; the Forest and Lumber\r\nWorkers (formerly the Brotherhood of Timber Workers) by one delegate\r\nwith thirteen votes; and the Marine Transport Workers by one delegate\r\nwith forty-two votes. The other thirty-five delegates represented\r\neighty-five local unions with one hundred and ninety-two votes.[605]\r\n\r\nAttention has been called to the rather tepid discussion of the problem\r\nof centralization at the 1912 convention.[606] During the intervening\r\nyear this question had called forth such bitter factional animosity\r\nin the organization that we find it in 1913 divided into two hostile\r\ncamps and threatened again with disruption. The issue is significantly\r\ncomparable to the \"states' rights\" controversy in our political\r\nhistory. The I. W. W. _administration_ and its supporters were, very\r\nnaturally, \"centralists.\" They favored a strong federal government\r\nfor the I. W. W. and attacked the \"decentralizers'\" program for the\r\nemasculation of the general administration and the establishment of\r\na loose confederation of sovereign local unions--the states' rights\r\nprogram in industry. The states' rights doctrine failed of acceptance\r\nin the I. W. W. as it has failed in American politics. Nevertheless,\r\nthe decentralization crisis in the I. W. W. deserves more than passing\r\nnotice. In the first place, the doctrine was not annihilated in 1913;\r\nit was merely smothered. The I. W. W. may yet be \"unscrambled.\" In\r\nthe second place, this issue is perhaps the most fundamental one\r\never given wide discussion by the I. W. W. membership. It involves\r\ndirectly the whole question of the structure of the organization,\r\nthe proper distribution of functions and authority among the several\r\nparts of the organization and, indirectly, questions of efficiency\r\nin carrying on propaganda and organizing work and of the relative\r\nmerits of authoritarian (state) socialism and so-called \"voluntary\r\nsocialism.\" As the two groups lined up at Chicago in 1913, we may say\r\nthat the controversy between the administration's supporters and the\r\ndefenders of the local unions was, on the whole, a struggle between the\r\nwestern membership, individualistic and tainted with anarchism, and the\r\neastern membership, more schooled to subordination--infected with state\r\nsocialism.\r\n\r\nThe attack of the decentralizers took the form of specific resolutions\r\nfor the abolition of various features of the general administration\r\nand the restriction of the powers of the Executive Board and general\r\nofficers. The abolition of the office of president in 1906 was in\r\npart an expression of this revolt against centralized authority. But\r\nnow, with the presidency eliminated, with very little organization\r\nat the best, with a degree of central power and authority which the\r\nUnited Mine Workers of America would consider mild indeed, and with\r\na constantly shifting membership of less than 15,000, we find that\r\nthere is actually a little group of western locals which assumes that\r\nthere is already a dangerous centralization of power and authority\r\nat \"Headquarters.\" Some five hundred resolutions were introduced at\r\nthe convention and a large number of these were assorted decentralist\r\nproposals for giving the local union relatively greater power--demands,\r\nin other words, for readjustments which were expected to result in\r\nincreased \"local autonomy.\" This local autonomy was to be secured for\r\nthe benefit of the \"rank and file,\" _i. e._, the individual members,\r\nand particularly for the \"rank and file\" membership of the \"mixed\"\r\nlocals so predominant in the western part of the country. From the\r\nstandpoint of the mixed local, \"the disease within the I. W. W.\r\nis ... the gigantic machine formation attempted to be [_sic_] foisted\r\nupon it by the authoritarian socialists who presided at its birth....\"\r\n\"Decentralization deals essentially,\" we are told, \"with the right of\r\nthe locals to _control_ themselves and through their combined wills\r\nto run the general organization.\"[607] Following up the attack, the\r\nknights of the rank and file proposed to abolish, _inter alia_, the\r\nGeneral Executive Board, the office of the General Organizer, and the\r\nnational convention![608] One wonders that the Constitution itself\r\nwas not put bodily on the _index_! Indeed, a year later, a leader in\r\nthe movement in California did write an article to show that the I. W.\r\nW. Preamble is syndicalistic, and the Constitution state-socialistic,\r\ntherefore that the latter should be abolished.[609] For two weeks the\r\ndelegates wrangled over propositions of this kind and the general\r\nsubject of decentralization. Two and a half days were devoted to the\r\nproposal to abolish the General Executive Board. This action was\r\ndesired by locals in southern California and other parts of the West,\r\nas well, as by a few of the eastern locals.[610] Concerning their\r\ndemands, a supporter of the administration said:\r\n\r\n    They [the decentralizers] claim they will never submit to the\r\n    rule of a minority of four or five men.... They do not want to\r\n    submit to the rule of the G. E. B. composed of four or five,\r\n    but they will submit to the authority of the General Secretary\r\n    and the General Organizer whom they want to function in the\r\n    place of the G. E. B. The authority of the minority of five or\r\n    seven men is something terrible, but the authority and rule of\r\n    the minority of two is not so terrible.[611]\r\n\r\nThe locals of Calgary [Canada], Portland, Oregon, Seattle and\r\nSpokane, Washington, and Phoenix, Arizona, presented a resolution\r\nasking that \"the function of the headquarters [_i. e._, the general\r\nadministration] be reduced to a mere correspondence agency.\" No action\r\nwas taken.[612] \"We ... are working ... to overthrow this [wages]\r\nsystem,\" said a decentralist fellow-worker, \"and we claim ... that\r\nthe rank and file of the proletariat will have to do this themselves.\"\r\nThe General Executive Board members, according to this delegate,\r\n\"place themselves in exactly the same position over these people [the\r\nworkers] and put themselves in the same [position of] unique power\r\nover them as the capitalist class.\"[613] Said another: \"The minority\r\nin this organization is ... ruling ... today, namely, the G. E. B. I\r\nam certainly in favor of abolishing the G. E. B. I don't see any use\r\nfor it. I don't see what they can do for the rank and file.\"[614]\r\nAccording to the majority report of the constitution committee (which\r\nwas lost) all authority was, in the absence of the G. E. B., to be\r\nvested in the General Secretary-Treasurer and the General Organizer,\r\nboth responsible to the rank and file.[615] In line with the foregoing\r\nwas a resolution providing for a reduction in the per-capita tax of\r\n\"mixed\" locals from fifteen to five cents per month. The proponents of\r\nthis resolution insisted that the \"mixed\" locals bore more than their\r\nshare of the financial burden--that they practically supported the\r\nnational organization.[616] The proposition was given extended debate\r\nand finally killed. Naturally it was opposed by the General Executive\r\nBoard.[617]\r\n\r\nThis attack on the already weak central authority took the form of\r\nan attempt, first, to abolish the G. E. B.; second, to cut down\r\nthe financial support of the general office; third, to abolish the\r\nconvention and substitute for it the initiative and referendum; fourth,\r\nto place agitators under the direct control of the rank and file; and\r\nfifth, to make the general officers mere clerical assistants. The only\r\nreal success achieved by the decentralizers in these efforts in 1913\r\nwas the introduction into the I. W. W. constitution of a provision for\r\nthe initiative and referendum.[618] The introduction of the referendum\r\nfeature is another illustration of the unconscious tendency to follow\r\nthe lines of our political development. Note, too, that the I. W. W.\r\nreferendum advocates hailed from those very states which have recently\r\nattracted attention by introducing this feature into their political\r\nstructure. The I. W. W. is now much more decentralized than it was\r\nin 1905 or even 1913, and it appears to be drifting toward further\r\nchanges in that direction. So far, the movement away from what little\r\ncentralized power it could boast may be seen in two phases: (1) The\r\nabolition of the presidency; (2) the placing of the General Executive\r\nBoard under the control of a general referendum which can be initiated\r\nat any time and upon any subject by request of not less than ten locals\r\nin not less than three different industries.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the proposed abolition of the convention, Delegate B.\r\nE. Nilsson asserted that only at the second and fourth conventions\r\nhad anything worth while been done, and that in both these cases all\r\nthat had been accomplished had been done against the constitution, and\r\nconcluded with the statement that \"this [eighth convention] has cost us\r\nover $3,000 and it isn't worth three cents.\"[619] Delegate Elizabeth\r\nGurley Flynn advocated the abolition of the convention. She said that\r\nit was not genuinely representative, inasmuch as all the locals could\r\nnot afford to send delegates.[620] The proposal was finally defeated.\r\nIn general, the decentralizers--anarchistic advocates of the doctrine\r\nof the militant minority--found themselves decidedly in the minority,\r\nand so far unsuccessful. \"Fully a hundred of the resolutions,\" says one\r\nprominent anarchist who attended the convention, \"were progressive,\r\nfavored decentralization, and were fathered, mothered, and nursed by\r\nhalf a dozen militants. But every radical resolution,\" he thought, \"was\r\neither lost, laid on the table, or amended so that it was useless.\r\nThe motion for decentralization was lost by three to one, as was\r\nthe motion to do away with the G. E. B.\"[621] Another opponent of\r\ncentralized authority explained how \"for two long and tedious weeks\r\nthey [the decentralizers] presented their ideas ... and the centralists\r\nslaughtered them by the _brute force of voting power_....\" \"The\r\ndecentralizers held,\" lie said, \"that a revolutionary movement does\r\nnot depend [so much] upon votes as it does upon the recognition ... of\r\nthe fact that all minorities are to have an equal voice ... with the\r\nmajorities ... [because] the minority is always more militant than the\r\nmajority.\"[622] In the same issue which carried this statement, the\r\n_Voice of the People_ said editorially:\r\n\r\n    [The decentralization struggle in the I. W. W. is] a war\r\n    between the advocates of \"I am going to save myself\" and those\r\n    of \"let me save you.\"... Centralization in labor unions is\r\n    nothing less than government by representation, or political\r\n    action. The advocates of centralization in the I. W. W. are\r\n    socialists, in fact, if not in profession.... Only when they\r\n    repudiate labor-union governmentalism will they become real\r\n    direct-actionists.[623]\r\n\r\nThe \"decentralist agitation\" first assumed definite form at a\r\nconference of the Pacific Coast locals of the I. W. W. held at\r\nPortland, Oregon, in February, 1911. At this conference the eight-hours\r\nmovement, plans for the establishment of agitation circuits for\r\norganizers, and--this most of all--the evils of centralized authority\r\nwere discussed.[624] At this conference was established the Pacific\r\nCoast District Organization, known among the I. W. W.s as the \"P. C.\r\nD. O.\" This organization was an interesting compromise between the\r\nidea of absolutely self-governing locals on the one side and servile\r\nlocals completely controlled by a bureaucratic national machine on the\r\nother. It undertook to exercise some of the sovereign functions of\r\n\"Headquarters.\" According to a member of the General Executive Board,\r\n\r\n    this P. C. D. O. was to have its own due stamp books,\r\n    headquarters, General Secretary, General Executive Board, and\r\n    paper--this paper was the [_Industrial_] _Worker_. But the P.\r\n    C. D. O. made no success ... because of not having a strong\r\n    enough ground to build upon in order to interest the western\r\n    membership.[625]\r\n\r\nIt was believed in some quarters--especially at \"Headquarters\"--that\r\nthe real purpose of the Western Slope constituency which organized the\r\nP. C. D. O. was to disrupt the I. W. W., or to effect a secession from\r\nthe national body. Some months after the Conference above referred to\r\nan editorial appeared in _Solidarity_--the administration, organ. It\r\ndeclared that their purpose\r\n\r\n    was to disrupt the I. W. W. and form an independent\r\n    organization in the West. The Conference itself proposed\r\n    that the G. E. B. reduce the _per capita_ [tax] to the P. C.\r\n    D. O. to five cents and allow the locals in that district\r\n    organization to buy their stamps directly from the district\r\n    headquarters.... The final conclusion of the sixth convention\r\n    was that such an organization as the P. C. D. O., for purposes\r\n    of closer unity, localized activity and propaganda, was fully\r\n    justified and should be supported, but efforts to divide or\r\n    disrupt the organization as a whole would be fought to the\r\n    bitter end.[626]\r\n\r\nThe administration saw in the P. C. D. O. a very subversive _imperium\r\nin imperio_, and when the eighth convention met, the G. E. B. issued\r\nthe following statement concerning the western promoters of the P. C.\r\nD. O. idea:\r\n\r\n    Decentralization is what they want. To gain this point of\r\n    control in the movement, they begin with the officials by\r\n    saying they have too much power, and to break up the machine\r\n    we must divide up in various parts, do away with the General\r\n    Executive Board and the General Office. The first move ... was\r\n    ... when the scheme of a Pacific Coast District Organization\r\n    was launched under the mask of perfecting more organization\r\n    [_sic_] in the I. W. W. At the [P. C. D. O.] convention held in\r\n    Portland, Ore., they were to establish a western headquarters,\r\n    ... get control of the western organ, _The Industrial Worker_,\r\n    elect their own General Executive Board, and get out their own\r\n    due-books and stamps, _etc._ This idea ... is now prevailing in\r\n    various sections throughout the organization. The P. C. D. O.\r\n    scheme ... failed because of [lack of] support [and] died with\r\n    its first convention because of the fact that it smacked of\r\n    disruption and decentralization....[627]\r\n\r\nIn the I. W. W., as in all voluntary organizations covering areas of\r\ncontinental magnitude, doctrines are allocated territorially. There\r\nare many points of contrast between the eastern and the western\r\nconstituencies of the Industrial Workers of the World. At present we\r\nare only concerned with the eastern and western attitudes toward the\r\nidea of decentralization. The western environment drives the _petit\r\nbourgeoisie_ to demand _political_ home rule or local autonomy in\r\nlegislative government. The result is the recent remarkable spread\r\nof the initiative, referendum and recall in the three Pacific Coast\r\nstates. In these same three states we find the chief strongholds of\r\n_industrial_ autonomy. The life of the western proletarian imbues\r\nhim with the more individualistic kind of rebellion which expresses\r\nitself in the more or less coherent demand for an industrial state\r\nmade up of self-governing local groups of workers. The results have\r\nbeen the partially successful drive from the West for the referendum\r\nidea in union government, the chronic decentralist mutterings which\r\nhave constantly emanated from the West, the open but unsuccessful\r\ndecentralist attack at the eighth convention and--the P. C. D. O. In\r\nthe long run the decentralist pressure has had its effect and the\r\norganization, as already intimated, is now less centralized than it\r\nwas a decade ago. The writer realizes that the analogy between western\r\npolitical pioneering and labor-union or industrialist pioneering in\r\nthat section must not be pushed too far. For example, the ultimate\r\nresult of I. W. W. decentralization is anarchist communism, which is\r\nquite different from the kind of political society resulting from the\r\nhome-rule and referendum statutes enacted by a middle-class electorate.\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. leaders were not unaware of the effect of the geographical\r\nenvironment. B. H. Williams, the editor of _Solidarity_ puts it in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n    We see in the West, individualism in practice, combined with\r\n    a theory of collective action that scoffs at individual or\r\n    group initiative by general officers and executive boards and\r\n    conceives the possibility of \"direct action\" in all things\r\n    through the \"rank and file.\" Hence the proposal ... for\r\n    minimizing the power of the general administration.\r\n\r\nHe explains that the eastern delegates come from a different\r\nenvironment. Industry in the East is highly developed and centralized.\r\nThey don't think of Pennsylvania in a geographical sense.\r\n\r\n    Without the individualistic spirit himself, the eastern worker\r\n    nevertheless recognizes the value of individual initiative in\r\n    promoting mass action and in executing the mandates ... of the\r\n    organization. The problem before the sixth convention was to\r\n    preserve the balance between these two sets of ideas. In that\r\n    the convention succeeded admirably.[628]\r\n\r\nAnother industrialist thinks that \"the western part of the country,\r\nbeing very little developed industrially, has a tendency to develop\r\nindividualism in the minds of the workers.... On the other hand, the\r\nworkers in the large industrial centers develop a strong collectivism\r\nwhich expresses itself in mass action,\" and which requires a \"close[ly]\r\ncentralized organization.\"[629]\r\n\r\nThe western local union is usually a \"mixed\" union, and it is therefore\r\nnot directly connected with any \"shop\" or industry. It is more nearly\r\na propaganda club. It usually has a hall of some kind for meetings,\r\nand in many cases this hall is open all the time. Sometimes there is a\r\n\"jungle kitchen\" attached and meals can be served to itinerant Fellow\r\nWorkers who are passing through. This means that there is naturally\r\nmore hall-room conversation and less solid \"shop talk\" in the western\r\nlocal than there is in the strictly industrial shop organization of\r\nthe East. Many members felt that too much time was wasted in talking\r\npolitics and religion. At the eighth convention there was some\r\ncriticism of the loquaciousness of the western \"wobbly\" and of his\r\npersonal appearance as well.\r\n\r\n    To-day you have got to have a man go up and address the public\r\n    that looks like a human being [said Delegate Olson]. [See what]\r\n    you have got in the western country by their ragged agitators;\r\n    you have got nothing but disappointment, and then you holler at\r\n    the General Secretary.... If the rank and file were educated\r\n    well enough to make use of the organization instead of arousing\r\n    animosity they would do away with this spittoon philosophy.[630]\r\n\r\nFrank Bohn, in describing the methods by which this group of so-called\r\n\"spittoon philosophers\" in the mixed locals is said to have attempted\r\nto disrupt the I. W. W., asks, \"Is this chair-warming sect now the\r\nleading element in the I. W. W.? Is it in a majority? If it is, the I.\r\nW. W. is not dying. It is dead.\"[631]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the merits or demerits of philosophic anarchism, it\r\nis unquestionable that the anarchist--the _naïve_ anarchist, at any\r\nrate--is an unmitigated nuisance. Perhaps the General Executive Board\r\nhad something of this sort in mind when they said that \"word pictures\r\nof the ideal will not serve to satisfy the cry for bread for any great\r\nlength of time regardless of how beautifully they may be\r\nportrayed ...,\" and reminded the delegates that \"responsibilities,\r\nfinancial, moral and physical, must be met and not shirked.\"[632] The\r\nBoard was more specific farther on in its report:\r\n\r\n    There is an element in the I. W. W. [it declares] whose sole\r\n    purpose seems to be to disrupt the organization. We refer to\r\n    the syndicalists or decentralizers, as they are all the same,\r\n    in their attempt to disrupt the I. W. W.... While we do not\r\n    believe in a highly centralized organization, neither is the I.\r\n    W. W. such. In fact, it is the most decentralized movement in\r\n    the world today. It does not interfere with the action of the\r\n    locals as long as they abide by the fundamental principles of\r\n    the organization.... We find a situation in the West that if\r\n    carried on means a complete disruption of the only industrial\r\n    organization in the world. In time of strike they sit around\r\n    the hall talking of what ought to be done or devising ways\r\n    and means to do away with General Headquarters.... They will\r\n    talk of sabotage and direct action but leave it to the boss to\r\n    use it on the few who take up the fight. If these conditions\r\n    continue, the I. W. W. will die of dry rot.[633]\r\n\r\nDelegate Foss, in a despondent moment, remarked that there was \"a\r\ngeneral tendency to prevent organization of any kind in this [I.\r\nW. W.] movement.\"[634] At another time he remarked: \"The western\r\nportion of this organization does not need any decentralization.\r\nDecentralization has got hold of it now and that is the very reason why\r\nthis organization has no job control in the West....\"[635]\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the G. E. B. had assured the membership that they were \"not\r\nunmindful of the danger that will ever live in centralized power,\"\r\nbut they asserted that \"it does not follow that to centralize the\r\nadministrative machinery of your organization necessarily means a\r\ncentralized power,\" and that \"the only means by which centralization\r\nof power can be avoided is by correct education and a thoroughly\r\nintelligent membership....\"[636]\r\n\r\nA writer who favored the decentralists says that their defeat was\r\ndue very largely to their \"crudity and inexperience.\" \"Possessed\r\nof a red-hot issue, they failed,\" he said, \"to make good with it\"\r\npartly \"because of their unfamiliarity with the principles of\r\ndecentralization.\"[637] Alexander Berkman, one of the most prominent\r\nanarchists in the United States, regretted the victory of what he might\r\nhave called the \"entrenched oligarchy\" at Chicago.\r\n\r\n    The question of local autonomy [he says], in itself such an\r\n    axiomatic necessity of a truly revolutionary movement, has been\r\n    so obscured in the debates of the convention that apparently\r\n    sight was lost of the fact that no organization of independent\r\n    and self-reliant workers is thinkable without complete local\r\n    autonomy. It does not speak well either for the intelligence\r\n    or spirit of the convention delegates that the efforts of the\r\n    decentralists were defeated. The convention has given a very\r\n    serious blow to the ... spirit of the social revolution by\r\n    [passing] the resolution that the publications of the I. W.\r\n    W. should come under the supervision of the General Executive\r\n    Board. That is centralization with a vengeance.... We consider\r\n    the convention ... a sad failure [and] ... we sincerely hope\r\n    that the real militants and revolutionists of the I. W. W. will\r\n    take the lesson to heart and exert all their energies to stem\r\n    the tide of conservatism and faint-heartedness in the I. W. W.\r\n    organization.[638]\r\n\r\nIn a very interesting article Ben Reitman, another anarchist, has set\r\ndown his more personal impressions of this eighth I. W. W. convention.\r\nAfter assuring us that 98 per cent of the \"extremely interesting crowd\"\r\nof delegates had in all probability been in prison, but that none of\r\nthem were criminals, he continues:\r\n\r\n    As I sat in the hot, stuffy, smoky room of the convention\r\n    hall day after day and heard the discussions, and saw how\r\n    little regard the delegates had for grammar and the truth, and\r\n    realized that most of the delegates knew as much about the\r\n    real labor movement as they did about psychology, and that\r\n    they cared little about the broad principles of freedom, ...\r\n    I marvelled at the big things the I. W. W. have done during\r\n    their short career; ... and I said to myself,--\"God! Is it\r\n    possible that this bunch of pork-chop philosophers, agitators\r\n    who have no real, great organizing ability or creative brain\r\n    power, are able to frighten the capitalistic class more than\r\n    any other labor movement organized in America? Is it true that\r\n    this body of politicians were able to send 5,000 men to jail in\r\n    the various free-speech fights?... Are these the men who put\r\n    a song in the mouth and a sense of solidarity in the heart of\r\n    the hobo? Are the activities of these men forcing the A. F. of\r\n    L. and the sociologists to recognize the power and necessity\r\n    of Industrial Unionism?\" And as I looked at the delegates and\r\n    recounted their various activities, I felt that each one could\r\n    say, \"Yes, I'm the guy.\" And then I wondered how they did\r\n    it.[639]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. was by this time developing some slight capacity for\r\nintrospection. A few of the leaders at any rate clearly understood\r\nsome of the weaknesses of the organization. The editor of the official\r\norgan makes the frank admission that \"at present we are to the labor\r\nmovement what the high diver is to the circus--a sensation marvelous\r\nand nerve-thrilling. We attract the crowds ... [but] as far as making\r\nindustrial unionism fit the every-day life of the worker, we have\r\nfailed miserably.\"[640]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[596] E.

W. W. has not lessened since 1907. This antagonism has been\r\nmost acute in Arizona, Nevada and Montana mining camps. In the\r\nArizona-Montana territory the feeling on the side of the Federation\r\nis indicated by the following extract from a letter written to the\r\ntwenty-first convention of that organization by a member in Jerome,\r\nAriz.\r\n\r\n    We are very sorry [he writes] that we are unable to send a\r\n    delegate to Denver, but we have the fight of our life here\r\n    with an I. W. W. bunch. They are coming here from all over;\r\n    already they have got in some dirty work by getting some of our\r\n    members to quit the W. F. M., ... there seems to be a concerted\r\n    movement on the part of the I. W. W. to get in where the W. F.\r\n    M. are doing good work and disrupt the union.[641]\r\n\r\nIt is not unnatural that there should be increasing friction between\r\nthe two organizations, inasmuch as the Western Federation has become on\r\nthe whole more conservative, while the I. W. W. has grown constantly\r\nmore revolutionary. In June, 1910, the W. F. M. voted for affiliation\r\nwith the American Federation of Labor and the alliance was finally\r\nconsummated in May, 1911. \"What the mine owners failed to do by\r\nforce,\" declares the I. W. W., \"they have accomplished through Civic\r\nFederation methods. The process will doubtless continue, until the\r\nW. F. of M, becomes as completely the football of metalliferous mine\r\nowners as the United Mine Workers is of the coal barons.\"[642] At\r\nits twentieth annual convention in 1912, the W. F. M. now not only\r\ndivorced from the I. W. W., but wedded to the A. F. of L., reversed its\r\ntraditional embargo on agreements and accepted the policy of entering\r\ninto contracts with the operators.[643]\r\n\r\nArticle V, section 4. of the Federation's _Constitution_ (1910 edition)\r\nstipulated that \"no local union or unions of the W. F. M. shall enter\r\ninto any signed contract or verbal agreement for any specified length\r\nof time with their employers.\" This clause was stricken out in 1912.\r\nThe revised edition of the _Constitution_ for that year expressed the\r\nnew policy of the Federation (now the International Union of Mine, Mill\r\nand Smelter Workers) in these terms: \"Local unions or groups of local\r\nunions may enter into wage agreements for a specified time, providing\r\nsuch agreements have the approval of the Executive Board....\"[644]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness between the two organizations was most acute in the\r\nButte (Mont.) mining fields. The situation reached a dramatic climax in\r\nthe summer of 1914 when, on June 13, the Union Hall of Butte Miners'\r\nUnion No. 1 (W. F. M.) was dynamited. The writer is not sufficiently\r\nfamiliar with the facts to tell this story in detail, or to express an\r\nopinion as to whether or to what extent the I. W, W. element in Butte\r\nwas responsible for the dynamiting.\r\n\r\nThe friction between I. W. W. sympathizers and the management of the\r\nlocal W. F. M. union--Butte Miners' Union No. 1--was unquestionably a\r\nfactor in the quarrel which culminated in the dynamiting outrage. There\r\nwere certainly other factors. The local organization had been gradually\r\ndividing into two factors--the \"Reds\" and the \"Yellows.\" Among the\r\n\"Reds,\" I. W. W. members and sympathizers predominated. The \"Yellows\"\r\ncomprised the local officials of the union and their followers, and\r\nthey were in a majority. It was alleged by the \"Reds\" that at the\r\nunion meetings the administration element deliberately packed the\r\nhall with the \"reactionaries\" before the hour of opening, so that the\r\n\"Reds\" could not even voice their grievances. Then the hall was blown\r\nup. The administration accused the I. W. W. and pointed out that such\r\na deed was to be expected of a group which avowed its belief in the\r\ndoctrine of \"direct action by the militant minority.\" The _Miners'\r\nMagazine_ declares that \"the 'Red' faction composed of I. W. W. members\r\ndynamited the Union Hall.\"[645] At the last W. F. M. convention (1916),\r\nPresident Moyer said that the real cause of the Butte tragedy was the\r\n\"poison the I. W. W. promoters were scattering\" in the minds of the\r\nButte miners.[646] A large portion of the two weeks' session of the\r\ntwenty-first W. F. M. convention (Denver, 1914) was taken up with a\r\ndiscussion of the Butte dynamiting and the alleged complicity of the\r\nI. W. W. therein. One of the delegates related the following incident,\r\nwhich he said took place in front of the Union Hall in Butte a short\r\ntime before the dynamiting:\r\n\r\n    Three of the mob ... presented I. W. W. cards ... at the door\r\n    and asked to be admitted to the meeting, and on being refused,\r\n    one of them laid his I. W. W. card on the sidewalk, stooped\r\n    down and patted it with his hand and said, \"We will make you\r\n    fellows eat that card before long.\"[647]\r\n\r\nLewis J. Duncan, the Socialist mayor of Butte, declared that the I. W.\r\nW.s did not take part in the dynamiting. In a letter dated June 29,\r\n1914, and addressed to the _United Labor Bulletin_ (Denver), he asserts\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    the responsibility for Tuesday's disturbance cannot truthfully\r\n    be placed on the I. W. W. The \"600 itinerant I. W. W.\r\n    trouble-makers\" on whom your report lays the blame for the June\r\n    13th trouble, are non-existent.... The men in revolt against\r\n    the local officers of the miners [union] and against the W.\r\n    F. of M. officials are a majority of the miners of Butte, and\r\n    only a small minority of them are connected with the Propaganda\r\n    League of the I. W. W. here, or are even sympathetic with the\r\n    I. W. W.s. We have no economic organization of the I. W. W. in\r\n    this city. It is untrue that even all those in the lead of the\r\n    local revolt are connected with the I. W. W....[648]\r\n\r\nBut scarcely more than a week after the dynamiting it was announced in\r\nthe newspapers that\r\n\r\n    plans for forming an independent union of miners were made\r\n    today at a meeting ... attended by 5000 miners.... The seceders\r\n    [the dispatch continued] have an executive committee of twenty,\r\n    a majority of whom are known to be members of the Industrial\r\n    Workers of the World....[649]\r\n\r\nApparently nothing came of this in the way of an I. W. W.\r\norganization, for there was no I. W. W. local in Butte in 1914. At the\r\npresent time, however, there is an active local there.\r\n\r\nEntirely apart from the Butte controversy there has been a marked\r\nfeeling among the officials of the Western Federation that the I. W.\r\nW. had deliberately attempted to disrupt the Federation. President\r\nMoyer thought the I. W. W.s had tried by crooked methods to get control\r\nof, or disrupt the W. F. M.[650] He alleged that \"there had been a\r\nconspiracy entered into both in and out of the Western Federation of\r\nMiners ... to secure control of this organization for the purpose of\r\ngetting it back into the I. W. W.,\"[651] and that \"publications edited\r\nby this direct-action, sabotage-howling coterie have lent their aid to\r\nthis campaign....\"[652] Mr. J. M. O'Neill, the editor of the _Miners'\r\nMagazine_, a man who has since 1907 been particularly lavish of\r\nepithets on I. W. W.-ism, complained that\r\n\r\n    Since the Western Federation of Miners repudiated by referendum\r\n    vote the aggregation of characterless fanatics, who make up\r\n    the official coterie of the International Workless Wonders,\r\n    the officials of the Western Federation of Miners have\r\n    been assailed by every disreputable hoodlum in the I. W.\r\n    W....[653] The time has come [he went on] when the labor and\r\n    socialist press of America must hold up to the arc-light these\r\n    professional degenerates who create riots, and then, in the\r\n    name of _free speech_, solicit revenue to feed the prostituted\r\n    parasites who yell \"_scab_\" and \"_fakiration_\" at every\r\n    labor body whose members refuse to gulp down the lunacy of a\r\n    \"bummery\" that would disgrace the lower confines of Hades.[654]\r\n\r\nEach faction of the I. W. W., according to O'Neill, claims to\r\nbe \"the genuine brand of unionism that is ultimately destined to\r\nshatter empires, scatter kingdoms and strangle economic slavery to\r\ndeath....\"[655] Another editorial in the same journal declares that the\r\nFederation is\r\n\r\n    unalterably opposed to their tactics and methods.... Industrial\r\n    unionism will not come through soup houses, spectacular\r\n    free-speech fights, sabotage or insults to the flags of\r\n    nations.... Men will not be organized or educated by means of\r\n    violence, for violence is but the weapon of ignorance, blind to\r\n    the cause that subjugates humanity and sightless to the remedy\r\n    that will break the fetters of wage slavery.\r\n\r\nThere has been less trouble between the coal miners' union and the\r\nI. W. W. because the United Mine Workers have always been much less\r\nradical than the Western Federation and the I. W. W. has really never\r\nsucceeded in making inroads of any consequence among the United Mine\r\nWorkers. Max Hayes, International Vice President of the U. M. W., told\r\nthe United States Commission on Industrial Relations that the I. W.\r\nW. was \"rather an unknown quantity among the coal miners. In fact,\"\r\nhe said, \"we do not let them propagate their doctrines; at least, we\r\ntry to prevent their ideas from becoming accepted by our people....\r\nThere is nothing constructive about their philosophy: it is all\r\ndestructive.\"[656]\r\n\r\nThe Mine Workers' Union is perhaps the most constructively\r\nbusiness-like, and certainly one of the most successful, unions in the\r\nworld. Their hard-headed constructive work is most of all evidences\r\nin the business agreements which they negotiate with the operators at\r\nregular intervals.\r\n\r\nTo the I. W. W., agreements--particularly all _time_ agreements--are\r\nin themselves evil. Consequently the friction between the world's\r\nsmallest and most revolutionary industrial union and its largest\r\nand most conservative industrial union was experienced primarily in\r\nconnection with these agreements. \"Wherever the _bona fide_ labor\r\nunions have succeeded in effecting a satisfactory agreement with the\r\nemployers,\" declares the _Miners' Magazine_, \"... there will be found\r\nthe I. W. W. organizer, attempting to create dissension.\"[657]\r\n\r\n    The Wobblies justified their attacks upon the Mine Workers\r\n    [said President John Mitchell at the U. M. W. convention in\r\n    1906] by saying that we make trade agreements which so tie the\r\n    hands of our members as to render us unable to strike at any\r\n    time during the year when conditions would seem propitious.\r\n    They lost sight of the fact that if we ... were ... at liberty\r\n    to strike at our own sweet will, the operators would have\r\n    precisely the same right and could lock us out whenever trade\r\n    was dull....[658]\r\n\r\nThe most recent conflict between the I. W. W. and the Mine Workers was\r\nin the anthracite region around Scranton, Pennsylvania. In April, 1916,\r\nentirely against the will of the United Mine Workers, according to a\r\nconservative writer,\r\n\r\n    the I. W. W. leaders decided to close down certain of the\r\n    collieries about Scranton. The method ... was to picket the\r\n    collieries in the early morning hours, from four o'clock\r\n    until seven, to urge the men not to go to work, and then, if\r\n    unsuccessful by that means, to drive them off by force.[659]\r\n\r\nAt about this time (1914) Eugene Debs, one of the founders of the\r\nI. W. W., was again urging the formation of a great revolutionary\r\nindustrial union. He proposed to begin with the two big miners'\r\nunions--the Western Federation and the United Mine Workers--which\r\norganizations were to form the head and center of the new union.\r\n\r\n    It is vain to talk about the I. W. W. [he said]; the Chicago\r\n    faction, it now seems plain, stands for anarchy. So be it. Let\r\n    all who oppose political action and favor sabotage and the\r\n    program of anarchism join that faction. The Detroit faction,\r\n    for reasons not necessary to discuss here, will never amount to\r\n    more than it does today. A new organization must be built with\r\n    the miners, the leading industrial body, at the head of the\r\n    movement.[660]\r\n\r\n\"The consolidated miners and the reunited I. W. W.,\" he said, \"would\r\ndraw to themselves all the trade unions with industrial tendencies,\r\nand thus would the reactionary federation of craft unions [A. F. of\r\nL.] be transformed from both within and without, into a revolutionary\r\nindustrial organization.\"[661] In the same article Debs advocated a\r\nreunion of the Socialist and Socialist Labor parties, and William\r\nEnglish Walling in commenting on Debs' proposal for uniting the W.\r\nF. M. and the U. M. W. says that such an outcome \"if not immediately\r\nprobable, is decidedly possible.\"[662]\r\n\r\nThe ninth I. W. W. convention, which met in Chicago, Sept. 21, 1914,\r\nas not an important one. It was in session less than a week and\r\nthere were not more than twenty-five delegates present.[663] The\r\nwriter attended the sessions of September 22, 23 and 24. On the\r\n22nd he counted ten delegates actually present, and about the same\r\nnumber of spectators. The next morning there were sixteen delegates\r\non hand, and on the 27th, seventeen. No stenographic report of the\r\nproceedings--indeed, no complete report of any kind whatsoever--has\r\never been issued. A very brief account was printed in _Solidarity_,\r\nwhich emphasized the fact that all the delegates were \"typical\r\nspecimens of the working class rank and file, with some contempt for\r\nempty theorizing and a marked preference for action.\"[664] On the 23rd,\r\nresolutions were presented asking for a reduction in the amount of\r\ndues payable to the national office and proposing to limit convention\r\ndelegates to one vote each irrespective of the size of the locals which\r\nthey represented. Both were lost. The latter resolution was supported\r\nby a militant minority which very naturally believed that the majority\r\nis sluggish--always behind time--and therefore nearly always wrong.\r\nThey insisted that the new and fruitful ideas always come from the\r\nminority and that it should, therefore, be given representation rather\r\naccording to its (assumed) revolutionary initiative than according to\r\nits numerical strength. Their attitude was primarily the result of\r\nthe difficulty they experienced both in and out of the organization\r\nin getting their militant ideas \"across\" to the large majority. In a\r\nlesser degree they were stimulated by the example set them by their\r\nfellow syndicalists in France where the \"militant minorities\" in the\r\nsmall unions of the C. G. T. are given the same representation and\r\nvoting power as the large unions of that body. For this reason small\r\ngroups which make up the \"extreme left\" in the C. G. T. have more\r\ninfluence than similar groups in this country.[665]\r\n\r\nThe unemployment situation had been particularly acute the preceding\r\nwinter and it was reported that the greater part of the membership of\r\nthe I. W. W. were out of employment at the time of the convention.\r\n\"... the I. W. W. has no apologies to offer,\" says _Solidarity_, \"for\r\nthe smallness of its last convention ... most of our members are out\r\nof work, and few, if any, Pacific Coast locals could have financed a\r\ndelegate for even four days in Chicago.\"[666]\r\n\r\nAccording to the account appearing in the I. W. W. press, it was the\r\nunderstanding of the convention\r\n\r\n    that [unemployed] parades to City Halls, Capitols, _etc._,\r\n    should be discouraged as nothing more substantial than hot air\r\n    is to be found in these political centers. The delegates agreed\r\n    with Haywood that the places for the unemployed to demonstrate\r\n    were the places where there was plenty of food and clothing so\r\n    that they could help themselves.[667]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the delegates decided to take definite steps toward\r\norganizing the unemployed. According to the Chicago papers, Haywood had\r\nsaid: \"Millions have been appropriated for the militia; nothing for the\r\nwealth producers who will be without work. Where warehouses are full of\r\nfood, go in and take it; where machinery is lying idle, use it for your\r\npurposes; where houses are unoccupied, enter them and sleep.\"[668] At\r\na later session (on September 24) there was adopted unanimously and\r\nwithout discussion a resolution which, in effect, stipulated that all\r\nspeakers be instructed to recommend to the workers the necessity of\r\ncurtailing production by \"slowing down\" and the use of sabotage. The\r\nresolution also suggested the publication of an explanatory leaflet\r\non this subject.[669] The _Daily News_ dispatch, just quoted, reports\r\nF. H. Little, an executive board member from California, as saying,\r\n\"Wherever I go, I inaugurate sabotage among the workers. Eventually the\r\nbosses will learn why it is that their machinery is spoiled and their\r\nworkers slowing down.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same session it was proposed that a conference on harvest\r\norganization be held, and from this time on the harvest and the other\r\nagricultural workers attracted more and more of the organization's\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion of the methods used in conducting the\r\nbusiness of the local unions, especially in regard to the bookkeeping\r\nsystem--or lack of system. No definite decision was reached, but the\r\nremarks of the delegates show that they were beginning to realize that\r\nfinancial and membership records cannot be kept by the futurist or\r\nimpressionistic methods which are so effective on the soap-box. It was\r\nrealized also that responsible persons must be selected for the work\r\nof the local secretary-treasurer, and it was urged that some uniform\r\nsystem of bookkeeping be adopted for the use of local secretaries.\r\nSome I. W. W. officials, like some bank officials, no doubt abuse the\r\nconfidence placed in them, although the daily press probably heralds\r\nto the world the I. W. W. defalcation with greater promptness and\r\nenthusiasm than it does that of the banker. A dispatch in the _Omaha\r\nBee_ (Nov. 24, 1916) says that the local \"secretary-treasurer of the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World has been missing for the last four\r\ndays and so is $250 which was to be used for the relief of strikers\r\nand their families in Duluth, Minn.\" In another instance, according to\r\nVincent St. John, \"the National Secretary [of the 'National Industrial\r\nUnion of Forest and Lumber Workers' of the I. W. W.] left with all the\r\nfunds in his charge six or eight months ago and the organization had to\r\nstart all over again....\"[670]\r\n\r\nThe European war had broken out less than two months before this\r\nconvention met and the delegates did not fail to adopt a resolution\r\nagainst war. It was worded in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    ... The ignorance of the working class is the reason for the\r\n    continuation of the war.... The [German] Social Democracy\r\n    was a movement that engendered a spirit of patriotism within\r\n    political boundary lines. The industrial movement will wipe out\r\n    all boundaries and will establish an international relationship\r\n    between all races engaged in industry.... We, as members of the\r\n    industrial army, will refuse to fight for any purpose except\r\n    for the realization of industrial freedom.[671]\r\n\r\nOnly two constitutional amendments of importance were passed at the\r\nninth convention. One was a further development of the machinery of the\r\nreferendum and constituted a victory for the decentralist boosters of\r\nthe \"rank and file.\" The first three clauses read as follows:\r\n\r\n    (a) Any local union in good standing with the General Office\r\n    may institute or initiate a call for a referendum to be\r\n    submitted to the General Office at once, with reasons and\r\n    arguments for same.\r\n\r\n    (b) Upon receipt of the initiative call for a referendum the\r\n    General Office shall publish same with arguments for and\r\n    against, and must submit it to all Local Unions, National\r\n    Industrial Unions and Industrial Departments for seconds within\r\n    30 days.\r\n\r\n    (c) Before any referendum shall be submitted, the call for the\r\n    same must be seconded by at least ten [local] unions in good\r\n    standing in at least three different industries.[672]\r\n\r\nThe other amendment expressed in more specific terms than ever before\r\nthe attitude of the organization toward agreements between employers\r\nand employees. It replaced the former blanket prohibition with a clause\r\nwhich specifically defines the kinds of agreements which _must_ be\r\navoided, and, inferentially, permits the making of agreements which are\r\nfree from the objectionable features specified. The amendment is to\r\nArticle III., and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    No Local Union affiliated with the General Organization,\r\n    Industrial department, or National Industrial Union of the I.\r\n    W. W. shall enter into any contract with an individual, or\r\n    corporation of employers, binding the members to any of the\r\n    following conditions:\r\n\r\n    1. Any agreement wherein any specified length of time is\r\n    mentioned for the continuance of the said agreement.\r\n\r\n    2. Any agreement wherein the membership is bound to give notice\r\n    before making demands affecting hours, wages or shop conditions.\r\n\r\n    3. Any agreement wherein it is specified that the members will\r\n    work only for employers who belong to an Association of the\r\n    employers.\r\n\r\n    4. Any agreement that proposes to regulate the selling price of\r\n    the product they are employed in making.[673]\r\n\r\nThese two years of unprecedented field activity were naturally years\r\nof growth in membership. This is more especially true of 1912 than of\r\n1913, during the latter part of which a decline set in. The membership\r\nwas at its high tide in 1912 after the Lawrence strike. The I. W. W.\r\nthen boasted more than 18,000 members.[674]\r\n\r\nNever since that time has it reached that point nor had it previously,\r\nunless we include the W. F. M. in the membership for 1905. There was\r\nalso during both years a net increase in the number of locals in the\r\norganization. During the year ending August 31, 1913, two hundred\r\nand thirty-six new locals were organized, and during the same period\r\none hundred were disbanded. The new locals were organized in largest\r\nnumbers in the lumber, textile, and metal and machinery industries.\r\nThirty were \"mixed\" locals.[675]\r\n\r\nIn the following table is a complete list of these new and defunct\r\nlocals classified to show the number gained and lost in each industry:\r\n\r\nTABLE 4\r\n\r\nNumber of local unions organized and disbanded during the year ending\r\nAugust 31, 1913, classified by industries as reported.[676]\r\n\r\n      _Industry_            _Organized_   _Disbanded_\r\n  Agricultural                   1               2\r\n  Amusement                      1              ..\r\n  Automobile                     1               1\r\n  Bakery                         4               1\r\n  Brass                          1              ..\r\n  Brewery and distillery         1              ..\r\n  Brick, tile and terra cotta    1               2\r\n  Building construction         13               2\r\n  Building employees             1               2\r\n  Button                         2               2\r\n  Clerks, butchers and delivery  2               1\r\n  Confectionery and fruits       2               1\r\n  Car                           ..               1\r\n\r\n  Coal miners                    3               2\r\n  Construction (general)         4               2\r\n  Corn products                 ..               1\r\n  Department store               1               1\r\n  Domestic service               1               1\r\n  Electrical                     1               1\r\n  Fishermen                     ..               1\r\n  Furniture                      2              ..\r\n  Glass                          1               1\r\n  Hotel and restaurant           2               3\r\n  Laborers, general              2               3\r\n  Leather                        2               2\r\n  Light and power plant          1              ..\r\n  Lumber                        41              ..\r\n  Marine transport               3              ..\r\n  Match                          1               1\r\n  Metal and machinery           18              10\r\n  Miners                         1              ..\r\n  Mixed locals                  30              19\r\n  Musical and theatrical         1              ..\r\n  Oilcloth                      ..               1\r\n  Oil workers                    3               1\r\n  Packing house                  1               3\r\n  Paper mills                   ..               1\r\n  Piano and instruments          4              ..\r\n  Plaster composition            1              ..\r\n  Pottery                        1               1\r\n  Printing plant                 1               1\r\n  Propaganda League              1               2\r\n  Public service                10               2\r\n  Railroad construction          5               4\r\n  Railroad employees             5               5\r\n  Reed, willow, and rattan       4               1\r\n  Rubber                         3               3\r\n  Ship construction              1              ..\r\n  Steel                          5               4\r\n  Street car                     2              ..\r\n  Sugar plant                    2               2\r\n  Textile                       32              ..\r\n  Tobacco                        6               3\r\n  Transport                      1               2\r\n  Watch and clock               ..               1\r\n  Wood                           3              ..\r\n                              ----            ----\r\n                               236             100\r\n\r\nThe membership declined considerably in 1913 and 1914, since which\r\ntime it appears to have increased slightly. Conservative estimates fix\r\nit at about 15,000 in 1913, 11,000 in 1914, and 15,000 in 1915.[677]\r\nThe author has not yet been able to get a reliable estimate of the\r\nmembership for 1916. The reports of the tenth convention (November,\r\n1916) as published in _Solidarity_ give no clue. A dispatch to the\r\n_Weekly People_ (December 9, 1916, p. 1) reports that the delegates\r\nclaimed to represent a constituency of 35,000 to 40,000. As to 1912,\r\nProfessor Hoxie said the average paid-up membership was 14,300 and that\r\n\"local and national bodies have an additional dues-paying membership\r\nof 25,000 on which no _per-capita_ tax has been paid to the General\r\nOrganization,\" and credits the organization (for 1913) with a \"nominal\r\nnon-dues-paying _enrolment_ of from 50,000 to 60,000.\" He came to the\r\nconclusion \"that 100,000 or more men _have had_ I. W. W. dues cards\r\nin their possession during the past five years.\"[678] The figures in\r\nAppendix IV indicate that more than 191,000 persons have at one time\r\nor another during the last ten years been members of the I. W. W.\r\nThis table also shows that the I. W. W. often gives very exaggerated\r\nmembership estimates. This was true in 1913 when unofficial I. W.\r\nW. estimates ran into the hundreds of thousands. At this time, it\r\nis reported that, \"Hoxie walked into the office of St. John, the\r\nGeneral Secretary, and said, 'Look here, St. John, I've got the\r\ngoods on you. You have only 14,300 members.' 'You're a liar, Hoxie,'\r\nreplied St. John, 'we have 14,310.'\"[679] Levine gives an estimate\r\n(doubtless furnished by the general office of the I. W. W.) which\r\nis unquestionably much too high. He puts the membership for August,\r\n1913, at 70,000, distributed as follows: textile industry, 40,000;\r\nlumber industry, 15,000; railroad construction, 10,000; metal and\r\nmachinery industry, 1,000; and miscellaneous, 4,000.[680] The numerical\r\ninsignificance of the I. W. W. as compared to the American Federation\r\nof Labor was strikingly indicated by Professor Hoxie in the course of\r\nhis remarks before the American Economic Association in December, 1913.\r\nHe said that in 1913 the I. W. W. had paid-up membership amounting to\r\n\r\n    (1) Less than one-hundredth of the membership of the American\r\n    Federation of Labor;\r\n\r\n    (2) Less than one-sixtieth of the voters of the Socialist\r\n    ticket in 1912;\r\n\r\n    (3) Less than one-twentieth of the membership of a single\r\n    industrial union in the A. F. of L.;\r\n\r\n    (4) Less than six one-thousandths of the general body of\r\n    organized workmen;\r\n\r\n    (5) Less than one in 2,000 of American wage-workers.[681]\r\n\r\nThe years 1914 and 1915 were marked by a definite slump in the\r\nfortunes of the I. W. W. followed in 1916 by a noticeable increase of\r\nactivity. St. John says that the decrease in membership during these\r\nyears was most marked in the following industries: \"lumber, railroad\r\nconstruction, building, packing house, amusement workers and the\r\npublic service industries.\"[682] A possible exception to this general\r\ninactivity is the National Industrial Union of Marine Transport\r\nWorkers of the I. W. W., which affiliated with the I. W. W. in April,\r\n1913, and has since made some progress.[683] St. John informed the\r\nUnited States Commission on Industrial Relations that the cause of this\r\nfalling-off was the industrial depression. He said that \"the membership\r\non the Pacific Coast from one end of it to the other, seventy-five per\r\ncent of them, have been out of work in the last year and have not paid\r\nany dues.\"[684] Leonard Abbott thought that the reaction or slump of\r\n1914-15 in the I. W. W. was \"due perhaps to the great emotional strain\r\nof revolutionary activity....\"\r\n\r\n    There is something almost pathologic [he said] in the present\r\n    reaction of the I. W. W. It has stressed too much the\r\n    destructive side--sabotage, violence. Acts of violence have a\r\n    very violent rebound--the boomerang effect. Violence should not\r\n    be made a tactic. You can see the apotheosis of violence in\r\n    Europe today. The I. W. W. has too much gloried in it.[685]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1915 and in 1916 came a revival of I. W. W.\r\nactivity. The most energetic group of all has been the Agricultural\r\nWorkers' Organization or the \"A. W. O.\" (organized April, 1915),\r\nwhich has taken great strides in pushing the propaganda of industrial\r\nunionism among the farm laborers and harvest hands and organizing these\r\nhitherto unorganized workers. At the tenth convention \"the A. W. O.\r\nheld the center of the stage, being represented by seven delegates\r\nwith 36 votes each.\"[686] The \"A. W. O.\" has its headquarters in\r\nMinneapolis and is strongest in the Middle West and Northwest. The\r\nfollowing extracts from a daily press dispatch will give an idea of the\r\nstir which is being made by the \"A. W. O.\" of the I. W. W. The accuracy\r\nof the report is questionable but it is presented for what it is worth.\r\n\r\n    State and city officials of the states comprising the great\r\n    American grain belt are considering holding a conference in the\r\n    near future to devise methods of coping with the Industrial\r\n    Workers of the World. Thousands of these migratory mendicants\r\n    have thronged the Middle West this year creating a reign of\r\n    terror throughout the rural communities and intimidating all\r\n    who do not join their organization....\r\n\r\n    Coming with the slogan \"Six Dollars a Day or No Work,\"\r\n    thousands of I. W. W. members and organizers have spread over\r\n    the agricultural district of the Middle West, attempting to\r\n    organize harvest hands into a semblance of a union and compel\r\n    the farmers to grant their demands....\r\n\r\n    I. W. W. gangs have taken possession of trains, clubbing off\r\n    all who could not show a membership card in their organization.\r\n    In most cases they have even driven trainmen from their\r\n    trains.... Often they travel in mobs of 300 or 400....\r\n\r\n    Great camps are established, not only by the I. W. W. but\r\n    by those who are not members of that organization. The\r\n    men congregate at these \"jungles,\" cook their food, often\r\n    pilfered from nearby farms, wash their clothes, bathe, and not\r\n    infrequently stage drunken orgies. This year the I. W. W.s have\r\n    posted signs at their \"jungles\" reading, \"For I. W. W.s only,\"\r\n    and any man who dares wander into their camp without proper\r\n    credentials is due for a beating.... This year they have been\r\n    more numerous than ever....\r\n\r\n    All methods of handling the situation have proven\r\n    unavailing.... One method suggested is for each state to employ\r\n    forces of mounted police similar to the famous Northwest\r\n    Mounted Police of Canada to keep the bands from congregating,\r\n    break up their \"jungles\" and otherwise deal with them. Power\r\n    seems the only force they recognize, and they laugh at the\r\n    county sheriffs and town constables.[687]\r\n\r\nThe year 1916 saw a recrudescence of both free-speech and strike\r\nactivities. The most important were the Everett Free Speech fight\r\nculminating in the tragedy of November 6 and the miners' strike on the\r\nMesaba range during the spring and summer. The scope of the present\r\nstudy does not permit of a detailed account of either of these highly\r\nimportant labor struggles. Indeed, this is hardly possible now, since\r\nin neither case is the story complete.\r\n\r\nMany signs suggest the possibility of a split in the I. W. W. before\r\nmany months. The growing strength of the A. W. O. and its natural\r\nyearning to be a big independent organization as well as the failure of\r\nthe Pacific Coast to send more than one solitary delegate to the tenth\r\nconvention, both indicate a possible development of internal discord\r\nsufficient to divide the I. W. W. into eastern and western wings.\r\nMr. Roger W. Babson in one of his recent confidential labor reports\r\nsuggests another way in which a shifting of power may come. \"A very\r\nlarge labor organization ... has taken steps,\" he says, \"to leave the\r\nFederation of Labor and form an industrial union.... A convention for\r\nthis purpose is planned for Chicago in the near future. _The Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World plan to gain control of this convention and may\r\nsucceed._\"[688]\r\n\r\nA correspondent in the _Weekly People_ says that one delegate at\r\nthe tenth I. W. W. convention declared that there was very likely to\r\nbe a split in the organization and intimated that, in such an event,\r\nthe Agricultural Workers' Organization would be the chief factor in\r\nbringing it about.[689] The same writer continues:\r\n\r\n    The A. W. O.... has a membership of from 18,000 to 20,000. This\r\n    seems to be a lot, but last night one who just arrived from the\r\n    harvest fields told me that workers traveling through the West\r\n    on box cars were thrown off if they had no red card of the I.\r\n    W. W., and many were beaten up.... He told me that eight or\r\n    more go in groups with revolvers and board trains going out\r\n    from the limits of a town and go through the train kicking and\r\n    beating-up anyone who has no red card.[690]\r\n\r\nNo convention was held in 1915. The tenth convention met at Chicago\r\nin the latter part of November, 1916. Fairly complete reports have\r\nbeen published in the columns of _Solidarity_.[691] There were in\r\nattendance about 25 delegates, including three members of the General\r\nExecutive Board and the General Secretary. The delegates were almost\r\nentirely from the East and Middle West, only one coming from the\r\nPacific Coast.[692] The editor of _Solidarity_, commenting upon\r\nthe charter of the convention, says that \"the tenth convention is\r\nremarkable as denoting the decline of the 'soap-boxers' as the dominant\r\nelement.\" \"The dominant tone,\" he says, \"was constructive rather than\r\ncontroversial and the general demand was for such constitutional and\r\nother changes as would make for greater efficiency in the work of the\r\norganization,\" and he approvingly quotes one delegate as exclaiming,\r\n\"The I. W. W. is passing out of the purely propaganda stage and is\r\nentering the stage of constructive organization.\"[693]\r\n\r\nThe most recent official report says that the organization now (January\r\n1, 1917) \"consists of six industrial unions: Marine Transport Workers,\r\nMetal and Machinery Workers, Agricultural Workers (A. W. O.), Iron\r\nMiners, Lumber Workers, and Railway Workers, having fifty branches\r\nand 200 unions in other industries, together with 100 recruiting\r\nunions directly united with the general organization.\"[694] The\r\npaid-up membership is put at 60,000 on January 1st, 1917, up to which\r\ndate it is claimed that an aggregate of 300,000 membership cards had\r\nbeen issued since 1905.[695] The bulk of the present membership is\r\ndistributed among the following industries: textile, steel, lumber,\r\nmining, farming, railroad construction, and marine transportation.\r\nExcept in the textile industries, the majority of these workers are\r\nmigratory unskilled laborers.[696]\r\n\r\nThe activities of the I. W. W. are by no means confined to the United\r\nStates and Canada. The organization has been gradually extending its\r\npropaganda in most English-speaking countries. This study is primarily\r\nconcerned with the I. W. W. in the United States. But in any case it\r\nwould be impossible to present any adequate record of its work in\r\nother countries because of the difficulty of getting at the facts\r\nof the situation. The announcements from the Chicago headquarters\r\nmake reference to four foreign jurisdictions, viz.: its British, New\r\nZealand, Australian and South African \"administrations.\" It is unlikely\r\nthat the \"British Administration\" amounts to anything. The writer has\r\nhappened upon vague references to an \"I. W. W. local\" in London, but\r\nhas not been able to either disprove or verify them. It is in the\r\nBritish colonies of South Africa[697] and Australia that the I. W.\r\nW. has made headway with its propaganda and organizing work. After\r\nthe outbreak of the European War the I. W. W. in Australia became the\r\nobject of no little attention on the part of the government because of\r\ntheir anti-militarist agitation. Finally in Australia several of the\r\nWobblies were arrested, tried and convicted on charges of high treason.\r\n\r\n    All the machinery of the capitalist state has been turned\r\n    loose against us [says an I. W. W. paper published in\r\n    Sydney]. Our hall has been raided periodically as a matter of\r\n    principle, our literature, our papers, pictures, and press\r\n    have all been confiscated; our members and speakers have been\r\n    arrested and charged with almost every crime on the calendar;\r\n    the authorities are making unscrupulous, bitter and frantic\r\n    attempts to stifle the propaganda of the I. W. W.[698]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the nature and seriousness of that propaganda may be had\r\nfrom the meagre reports which have reached this country. A writer in\r\nthe _Sunset Magazine_[699] says that the striking coal miners\r\n\r\n    had Australia at their mercy.... In vain did the government\r\n    plead with the strikers for coal to start troop and wheat\r\n    ships.... As a last resort, the leaders ... were arrested....\r\n    The Industrial Workers of the World, the militant aggressive\r\n    organization whose doctrine of a general rebellion is rapidly\r\n    spreading through the \"paradise of labor,\" demanded the release\r\n    of the miners [and] threatened to burn down Sydney if their\r\n    demands were not complied with. They made good. Night after\r\n    night the incendiary work went on in Sydney.... Terrorized by\r\n    the handful of industrial rebels, the commonwealth was forced\r\n    to yield. The strike leaders were finally released [and] the\r\n    demands of the strikers were granted.\r\n\r\nA month later the _New York Times_ published some special\r\ncorrespondence on the subject. It appears that in October, 1916,\r\ncharges were preferred against 15 I. W. W.s in New South Wales.[700]\r\nThese charges involved, in Sydney, according to this report, treason,\r\nand wholesale arson amounting to $1,250,000. The chief issue involved\r\nwas the conscription policy of the government, to which the I. W. W.\r\nwas opposed. They were brought to trial on October 10th. The warrant\r\nagainst them charged that they were preaching sabotage by means of\r\nsurreptitious pamphlets and openly upon the streets. Further, the\r\nwarrant alleged, says the _Times_ correspondent, \"that they plotted\r\nrebellion against the King; that they conspired to burn down buildings\r\nin Sydney ... endeavored to put force or restraint upon the Parliament\r\nof New South Wales, [and that] they endeavored to intimidate and\r\noverawe Parliament.\"[701]\r\n\r\nTheir anti-war campaign at last became so obnoxious to the government\r\nthat the House of Representatives, in December, 1916, passed a statute,\r\ncalled \"The Unlawful Associations Act,\" which practically made it a\r\ncriminal offense to be a member of the I. W. W.; the apparent intention\r\nof the authorities being to arrest all prominent I. W. W. speakers and\r\nhold them for the duration of the war.[702]\r\n\r\nThe Australian _Unlawful Associations Act_[703] is to \"continue in\r\nforce for the duration of the present war and a period of six months\r\nthereafter, but no longer.\" Section 3 runs in part as follows: \"The\r\nfollowing are hereby declared to be unlawful associations, namely: (a)\r\nthe association known as the Industrial Workers of the World; and (b)\r\nany association which, by its constitution or propaganda, advocates\r\nor encourages, or incites or instigates to, the taking or endangering\r\nof human life, or the destruction or injury of property....\" The act\r\nimposes the penalty of imprisonment for six months upon any person who\r\n\"continues to be a member of an unlawful association,\" who \"advocates\r\nor encourages [or who \"prints or publishes any writing advocating or\r\nencouraging\"] ... the taking or endangering of human life, or the\r\ndestruction or injury of property,\" who \"advocates or encourages ...\r\nany action intended or calculated to prevent or hinder the production,\r\nmanufacture or transport ... of troops, arms, munitions or war-like\r\nmaterial,\" or who \"knowingly gives or contributes money or goods to an\r\nunlawful association.\"\r\n\r\nIn Australia as in the United States there were prior to the war\r\ntwo I. W. W. organizations in existence: a political I. W. W. and a\r\nnon-political I. W. W. In that country, however, the political group\r\n(counterpart of the Detroit wing in the United States) has been by\r\nall odds the more influential. Although both these groups were pretty\r\nwell smothered by the war and the _Unlawful Associations Act_, the I.\r\nW. W. industrial union idea made its appearance in another form in the\r\nsummer of 1918. In July of that year representatives of some of the\r\nmost powerful unions of New South Wales held a conference in Sydney.\r\nThis so-called \"Industrial Conference Board\" drew up a constitution for\r\nan organization on the I. W. W. model, adopted the I. W. W. preamble\r\nalmost word for word, and launched \"The Workers Industrial Union of\r\nAustralia.\"[704] Four of the six clauses of the preamble are almost\r\nidentical in phrasing with that of the American I. W. W. The other two\r\nclauses are worded as follows:\r\n\r\n    Between these two classes [proletarian and capitalist] the\r\n    struggle must continue until capitalism is abolished ...\r\n    by the workers uniting in one class-conscious economic\r\n    organization to take and hold the means of production by\r\n    revolutionary industrial and political action. \"Revolutionary\r\n    action\" means to secure a complete change, namely the\r\n    abolition of capitalistic class ownership of the means of\r\n    production--whether privately or through the state--and the\r\n    establishment in its place of social ownership by the whole\r\n    community.... We hold that, as the working class creates and\r\n    operates the socially operated machinery of production, it\r\n    should direct production and determine working conditions.[705]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the Federal government has enacted no law\r\nanalogous to the Australian _Unlawful Associations Act_. Several\r\nof the individual States, however, have passed so-called \"criminal\r\nsyndicalism\" laws and the United States Senate on May 6, 1918, passed\r\na so-called anti-sabotage bill[706] which the newspapers declared was\r\naimed at the I. W. W. The State laws referred to are quite generally\r\nunderstood to be directed against that organization. None of these\r\nstatutes, however, mentions the I. W. W. by name. The Senate bill\r\nreferred to declares to be unlawful any association\r\n\r\n    one of whose purposes or professed purposes is to bring about\r\n    any governmental, social, industrial or economic change within\r\n    the United States by the use, without authority of law, of\r\n    physical force, violence or physical injury to person or\r\n    property, or by threats of such injury, or which teaches,\r\n    advocates, advises or defends the use ... of physical force,\r\n    violence or physical injury to person or property, or threats\r\n    of such injury, to accomplish such change or for any other\r\n    purpose, and which, during any war in which the United States\r\n    is engaged, shall by any such means prosecute or pursue such\r\n    purpose or professed purpose, or shall so teach, advocate,\r\n    advise or defend....[707]\r\n\r\nThe penalties proposed in the bill are more severe than in the\r\nAustralian law. It would punish by imprisonment for not more than ten\r\nyears or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by both such fine and\r\nimprisonment, anyone who, while the United States is at war, (a) acts\r\nas an officer, or speaks as the representative, of such an association,\r\n(b) becomes or continues to be a member of, or contributes anything to,\r\nsuch an organization, or (c) publishes or distributes any publication\r\nwhatever which defends the use of \"physical force, violence of physical\r\ninjury to person or property ... as a means of accomplishing any\r\ngovernmental, social, industrial or economic change.\" The last section\r\nof the bill would impose a fine of not more than $500 and imprisonment\r\nfor not more than one year, or both, upon any landlord who permits on\r\nhis premises, while the United States is at war, any meeting of such an\r\nassociation or any assemblage of persons who teach or advocate the use\r\nof physical force or violence, etc.[708]\r\n\r\nSo-called \"criminal syndicalism\" or _sabotage_ laws have been\r\nenacted by the States of California,[709] Idaho,[710] Michigan,[711]\r\nMinnesota,[712] North Dakota,[713] Montana,[714] South Dakota,[715] and\r\nNebraska.[716] In the State of Washington a \"syndicalism bill,\" and\r\nin Arizona a \"_sabotage_\" law, were passed by the State legislatures\r\nin 1918 but were vetoed by the governor in each case.[717] The\r\n\"criminal syndicalism\" laws of Minnesota, Idaho and Montana are\r\nreprinted in Appendix X. The South Dakota statute is very similar to\r\nthat of Minnesota. It defines criminal syndicalism \"as any doctrine\r\nwhich teaches or advocates crime, sabotage (sabotage as used in this\r\nact means wilful and malicious damage or injury to the property of\r\nanother), violence or other methods of terrorism, or the destruction\r\nof life or property, for the accomplishment of social, economic,\r\nindustrial or political ends.\" It declares such advocacy to be a\r\nfelony and punishes \"by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for\r\nnot less than one nor more than twenty-five years, or by a fine of\r\nnot less than $1000 nor more than $10,000, or by both such fine\r\nand imprisonment ...\" anyone who (1) advocates or \"suggests\" such\r\ndoctrines, (2) publishes, circulates or has in his (or her) possession\r\nprinted matter which advocates or \"suggests\" any doctrine that economic\r\nor political ends should be brought about by \"crime, sabotage,\" etc.,\r\n(3) belongs to or assembles with any group or organization which\r\nadvocates or suggests such a doctrine, or (4) permits in any room or\r\nbuilding owned or controlled by him (or her) any assemblage of this\r\ncharacter. This statute is not limited to the duration of the war,\r\nwhich, indeed, is not mentioned. The North Dakota and Nebraska laws are\r\nless comprehensive and less drastic than the law of Minnesota. They are\r\nanti-_sabotage_ laws within the scope of the definition of _sabotage_\r\ngiven above in the South Dakota act. Of all the \"criminal syndicalism\"\r\nstatutes referred to in these pages that of South Dakota inflicts\r\nthe heaviest penalties. The Minnesota law has recently come into the\r\ncourts[718] and the State Supreme Court, in a decision rendered April\r\n19, 1918, held it to be constitutional.[719]\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. does not lack constructive ideas. The trouble has been\r\nalways that those ideas have not been applied very extensively.\r\nThey have remained merely a part of the Wobblies' varied collection\r\nof slogans and doctrines. As the delegates at the tenth convention\r\nrealized, the first decade of I. W. W.-ism in America has been marked\r\nby excessive propaganda activity--critical and non-constructive,\r\nif not destructive ... and very little constructive activity.[720]\r\nThis fact is strikingly illustrated by the very transient character\r\nof its membership. The \"turnover\" for the decade 1905-1915 has been\r\nexceedingly heavy--not only as measured by individual members but also\r\nby local unions. The most favorable report of the present strength of\r\nthe I. W. W. is given in the _World Almanac_ for 1917, where it is\r\nstated that the I. W. W. is composed of five hundred and thirty-five\r\nrecruiting and industrial unions (not including five [foreign]\r\n\"national administrations\") and has a membership of 85,000.[721] This\r\nlatter figure probably included delinquent members, and in any case\r\nis almost certainly much exaggerated. The same statement applies\r\nto the figure given for local unions. But even on such a generous\r\nassumption, the figures in columns 7 and 11 of Table A (Appendix IV)\r\nshow, first, that there have been more than five times as many local\r\nunions chartered by the I. W. W. as are now in the organization, and\r\nsecond, that there have been _at least_ twice and probably ten times\r\nas many membership cards issued during the past ten years as there\r\nare members in the organization today. But the real situation is much\r\nworse. Conservative estimates of the active membership in 1915 put it\r\nat 15,000, distributed among 150 local unions.[722] Not less than 2,000\r\nlocals were chartered and approximately 200,000 membership cards issued\r\nin the ten-year period 1905-1916. This indicates that only 7.5 per\r\ncent of the locals chartered and of the individuals enrolled in the I.\r\nW. W. have remained in the organization. This means an average annual\r\nturnover (of individual members and locals) for the past ten years of\r\n133 per cent. As the table shows, the numerical strength of the I. W.\r\nW. in comparison with the whole number in labor organizations and the\r\nwhole number gainfully employed is very insignificant. Its membership\r\nin 1910 was four-tenths of one per cent of all trade-unionists and\r\ntwo-hundredths of one per cent of all gainfully employed. In the\r\ntextile industry where the I. W. W. is numerically strongest, the\r\nDetroit I. W. W. had enrolled in 1910 one per cent and the Chicago I.\r\nW. W. fourteen per cent of all trade-unionists.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say to what extent the I. W. W. is likely to develop\r\nits constructive features. In so far as more and more stress is placed\r\non job organization, the I. W. W. is and will continue to become a more\r\nconstructive organization. But it is not easy to credit the statement\r\nmade at the tenth convention that the I. W. W. has \"passed out of the\r\npropaganda stage.\" It will become more actively constructive, probably,\r\nbut only its complete annihilation can put a period to its propaganda\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[641] T.

W. W. PREAMBLE[724]\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CHICAGO\r\n\r\nThe working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There\r\ncan be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of\r\nworking people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all\r\nthe good things of life.\r\n\r\n[Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers\r\ncome together on the political, as well as on the industrial field,\r\nand take hold of that which they produce by their labor through an\r\neconomic organization of the working class, without affiliation with\r\nany political party.]\r\n\r\n_Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of\r\nthe world organize as a class, take possession of the earth and the\r\nmachinery of production and abolish the wage system._\r\n\r\nWe find that the centering of management of industries into fewer and\r\nfewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever-growing\r\npower of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of\r\naffairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another\r\nset of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another\r\nin wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to\r\nmislead the workers into the belief that the workers have interest in\r\ncommon with their employers.\r\n\r\nThese conditions can be changed and the interest of the working class\r\nupheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its\r\nmembers in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease\r\nwork whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus\r\nmaking an injury to one an injury to all.\r\n\r\n_Instead of the conservative motto, \"A fair day's wage for a fair day's\r\nwork,\" we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword,\r\n\"Abolition of the wage system.\" It is the historic mission of the\r\nworking class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must\r\nbe organized, not only for the every-day struggle with capitalists, but\r\nto carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By\r\norganizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society\r\nwithin the shell of the old.

There\r\ncan be no peace as long as hunger and want are found among millions of\r\nworking people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all\r\nthe good things of life.\r\n\r\n[Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers\r\ncome together on the political, as well as the industrial field,\r\nand take and hold that which they produce by their labor through an\r\neconomic organization of the working class, without affiliation with\r\nany political party.]\r\n\r\n_Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the toilers\r\ncome together on the political field under the banner of a distinct\r\nrevolutionary political party governed by the workers' class interest,\r\nand on the industrial field under the banner of One Great Industrial\r\nUnion to take and hold all means of production and distribution, and\r\nto run them for the benefit of all wealth producers._\r\n\r\nThe rapid gathering of wealth and the centering of the management of\r\nindustries into fewer and fewer hands make the trade unions unable to\r\ncope with the ever-growing power of the employing class, because the\r\ntrade unions foster a state of things which allows one set of workers\r\nto be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry,\r\nthereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. The trade unions aid\r\nthe employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the\r\nworking class have interests in common with their employers.\r\n\r\nThese said conditions must be changed, the interests of the working\r\nclass upheld _and while the capitalist rule still prevails all possible\r\nrelief for the workers must be secured_. _That can only be done by\r\nan organization aiming steadily at the complete overthrow of the\r\ncapitalist wage system_ and formed in such a way that all its members\r\nin any one industry or in all industries, if necessary, cease work\r\nwhenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus\r\nmaking an injury to one an injury to all.\r\n\r\n[_Therefore, without endorsing any political party, we unite under the\r\nfollowing constitution._]\r\n\r\n_Therefore we unite under the following constitution._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[724] Additions to the original preamble are printed in italics.\r\nClauses dropped from it are enclosed in square brackets.\r\n\r\n[725] Additions to the original preamble are printed in italics.\r\nClauses dropped from it are enclosed in square brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE I.

BLOCK\r\n\r\nBY JOE HILL\r\n\r\n(Air: \"It Looks to Me like a Big Time Tonight\")\r\n\r\n    Please give me your attention, I'll introduce to you\r\n    A man that is a credit to \"Our Red, White and Blue\";\r\n    His head is made of lumber, and solid as a rock;\r\n    He is a common worker and his name is Mr. Block.\r\n              And Block he thinks he may\r\n              Be President some day.\r\n\r\n                                 CHORUS\r\n\r\n        Oh, Mr. Block, you were born by mistake,\r\n              You take the cake,\r\n              You make me ache.\r\n        Tie on a rock to your block and then jump in the lake,\r\n        Kindly do that for Liberty's sake.\r\n\r\n    Yes, Mr. Block is lucky; he found a job, by gee!\r\n    The sharks got seven dollars, for job and fare and fee.\r\n    They shipped him to a desert and dumped him with his truck,\r\n    But when he tried to find his job, he sure was out of luck.\r\n              He shouted, \"That's too raw,\r\n              I'll fix them with the law.\"\r\n\r\n    Block hiked back to the city, but wasn't doing well.\r\n    He said, \"I'll join the union--the great A. F. of L.\"\r\n    He got a job next morning, got fired in the night,\r\n    He said, \"I'll see Sam Gompers and he'll fix that foreman right.\"\r\n              Sam Gompers said, \"You see\r\n              You've got our sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n    Election day he shouted, \"A Socialist for Mayor!\"\r\n    The \"comrade\" got elected, he happy was for fair,\r\n    But after the election he got an awful shock.\r\n    A great big Socialist Bull did rap him on the block.\r\n              And Comrade Block did sob,\r\n              \"I helped him to his job.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTIE 'EM UP!\r\n\r\n(Words and music by G. G. Allen)\r\n\r\n    We have no fight with brothers of the old A. F. of L.\r\n    But we ask you use your reason with the facts we have to tell.\r\n    Your craft is but protection for a form of property,\r\n    The skill that you are losing, don't you see.\r\n    Improvements on machinery take your tool and skill away,\r\n    And you'll be among the common slaves upon some fateful day.\r\n    Now the things of which we're talking we are mighty sure about.--\r\n    So what's the use to strike the way you can't win out?\r\n\r\n                                CHORUS\r\n\r\n      Tie 'em up! tie 'em up; that's the way to win.\r\n      Don't notify the bosses till hostilities begin.\r\n      Don't furnish chance for gunmen, scabs and all their like;\r\n      What you need is One Big Union and the One Big Strike.\r\n\r\n    Why do you make agreements that divide you when you fight\r\n    And let the bosses bluff you with the contract's \"sacred right\"?\r\n    Why stay at work when other crafts are battling with the foe?\r\n    You all must stick together, don't you know?\r\n    The day when you begin to see the classes waging war\r\n    You can join the biggest tie-up that was ever known before.\r\n    When the strikes all o'er the country are united into one\r\n    Then the workers' One Big Union all the wheels shall run.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. F. OF L. SYMPATHY\r\n\r\nBY B. L. WEBER\r\n\r\n(Tune: \"All I Got was Sympathy\")\r\n\r\n    Bill Brown was a worker in a great big shop,\r\n      Where there worked two thousand others;\r\n    They all belonged to the A.

W.: its strikes,\r\nfree-speech fights, etc. There is also an extensive literature (in\r\nEnglish, French, Italian and other languages) devoted to special\r\naspects of syndicalism or I. W. W.-ism. Among the important topics\r\ncovered are the following: industrial _versus_ craft unionism;\r\nparliamentarianism and political action; war and militarism; I. W.\r\nW.-ism and (state) socialism; I.
