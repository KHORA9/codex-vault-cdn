Our country presents on every side\r\nthe evidences of that continued favor under whose auspices it, has\r\ngradually risen from a few feeble and dependent colonies to a prosperous\r\nand powerful confederacy. We are blessed with domestic tranquillity and all\r\nthe elements of national prosperity. The pestilence which, invading for a\r\ntime some flourishing portions of the Union, interrupted the general\r\nprevalence of unusual health has happily been limited in extent and\r\narrested in its fatal career. The industry and prudence of our citizens are\r\ngradually relieving them from the pecuniary embarrassments under which\r\nportions of them have labored; judicious legislation and the natural and\r\nboundless resources of the country have afforded wise end timely aid to\r\nprivate enterprise, and the activity always characteristic of our people\r\nhas already in a great degree resumed its usual and profitable channels.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our foreign relations has not materially changed since the\r\nlast annual message of my predecessor. We remain at peace with all nations,\r\nand no efforts on my part consistent with the preservation of our rights\r\nand the honor of the country shall be spared to maintain a position so\r\nconsonant to our institutions. We have faithfully sustained the foreign\r\npolicy with which the United States, under the guidance of their first\r\nPresident, took their stand in the family of nations--that of regulating\r\ntheir intercourse with other powers by the approved principles of private\r\nlife; asking and according equal rights and equal privileges; rendering and\r\ndemanding justice in all cases; advancing their own and discussing the\r\npretensions of others with candor, directness, and sincerity; appealing at\r\nall times to reason, but never yielding to force nor seeking to acquire\r\nanything for themselves by its exercise.\r\n\r\nA rigid adherence to this policy has left this Government with scarcely a\r\nclaim upon its justice for injuries arising from acts committed by its\r\nauthority. The most imposing and perplexing of those of the United States\r\nupon foreign governments for aggressions upon our citizens were disposed of\r\nby my predecessor. Independently of the benefits conferred upon our\r\ncitizens by restoring to the mercantile community so many millions of which\r\nthey had been wrongfully divested, a great service was also rendered to his\r\ncountry by the satisfactory adjustment of so many ancient and irritating\r\nsubjects of contention; and it reflects no ordinary credit on his\r\nsuccessful administration of public affairs that this great object was\r\naccomplished without compromising on any occasion either the honor or the\r\npeace of the nation.\r\n\r\nWith European powers no new subjects of difficulty have arisen, and those\r\nwhich were under discussion, although not terminated, do not present a more\r\nunfavorable aspect for the future preservation of that good understanding\r\nwhich it has ever been our desire to cultivate.\r\n\r\nOf pending questions the most important is that which exists with the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain in respect to our northeastern boundary. It is\r\nwith unfeigned regret that the people of the United States must look back\r\nupon the abortive efforts made by the Executive, for a period of more than\r\nhalf a century, to determine what no nation should suffer long to remain in\r\ndispute--the true line which divides its possessions from those of other\r\npowers. The nature of the settlements on the borders of the United States\r\nand of the neighboring territory was for a season such that this, perhaps,\r\nwas not indispensable to a faithful performance of the duties of the\r\nFederal Government. Time has, however, changed this state of things, and\r\nhas brought about a condition of affairs in which the true interests of\r\nboth countries imperatively require that this question should be put at\r\nrest. It is not to be disguised that, with full confidence, often\r\nexpressed, in the desire of the British Government to terminate it, we are\r\napparently as far from its adjustment as we were at the time of signing the\r\ntreaty of peace in 1783. The sole result of long-pending negotiations and a\r\nperplexing arbitration appears to be a conviction on its part that a\r\nconventional line must be adopted, from the impossibility of ascertaining\r\nthe true one according to the description contained in that treaty. Without\r\ncoinciding in this opinion, which is not thought to be well rounded, my\r\npredecessor gave the strongest proof of the earnest desire of the United\r\nStates to terminate satisfactorily this dispute by proposing the\r\nsubstitution of a conventional line if the consent of the States interested\r\nin the question could be obtained. To this proposition no answer has as yet\r\nbeen received. The attention of the British Government has, however, been\r\nurgently invited to the subject, and its reply can not, I am confident, be\r\nmuch longer delayed. The general relations between Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States are of the most friendly character, and I am well satisfied\r\nof the sincere disposition of that Government to maintain them upon their\r\npresent footing. This disposition has also, I am persuaded, become more\r\ngeneral with the people of England than at any previous period. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to say to you how cordially it is reciprocated by the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States. The conviction, which must be\r\ncommon to all, of the injurious consequences that result from keeping open\r\nthis irritating question, and the certainty that its final settlement can\r\nnot be much longer deferred, will, I trust, lead to an early and\r\nsatisfactory adjustment. At your last session I laid before you the recent\r\ncommunications between the two Governments and between this Government and\r\nthat of the State of Maine, in whose solicitude concerning a subject in\r\nwhich she has so deep an interest every portion of the Union participates.\r\n\r\nThe feelings produced by a temporary interruption of those harmonious\r\nrelations between France and the United States which are due as well to the\r\nrecollections of former times as to a correct appreciation of existing\r\ninterests have been happily succeeded by a cordial disposition on both\r\nsides to cultivate an active friendship in their future intercourse. The\r\nopinion, undoubtedly correct, and steadily entertained by us, that the\r\ncommercial relations at present existing between the two countries are\r\nsusceptible of great and reciprocally beneficial improvements is obviously\r\ngaining ground in France, and I am assured of the disposition of that\r\nGovernment to favor the accomplishment of such an object. This disposition\r\nshall be met in a proper spirit on our part. The few and comparatively\r\nunimportant questions that remain to be adjusted between us can, I have no\r\ndoubt, be settled with entire satisfaction and without difficulty.\r\n\r\nBetween Russia and the United States sentiments of good will continue to be\r\nmutually cherished. Our minister recently accredited to that Court has been\r\nreceived with a frankness and cordiality and with evidences of respect for\r\nhis country which leave us no room to doubt the preservation in future of\r\nthose amicable and liberal relations which have so long and so\r\nuninterruptedly existed between the two countries. On the few subjects\r\nunder discussion between us an early and just decision is confidently\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has been opened with the Government of Austria for the\r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations, in conformity with the wishes of\r\nCongress as indicated by an appropriation act of the session of 1837, and\r\narrangements made for the purpose, which will be duly carried into effect.\r\n\r\nWith Austria and Prussia and with the States of the German Empire (now\r\ncomposing with the latter the Commercial League) our political relations\r\nare of the most friendly character, whilst our commercial intercourse is\r\ngradually extending, with benefit to all who are engaged in it.\r\n\r\nCivil war yet rages in Spain, producing intense suffering to its own\r\npeople, and to other nations inconvenience and regret. Our citizens who\r\nhave claims upon that country will be prejudiced for a time by the\r\ncondition of its treasury, the inevitable consequence of long-continued and\r\nexhausting internal wars. The last installment of the interest of the debt\r\ndue under the convention with the Queen of Spain has not been paid and\r\nsimilar failures may be expected to happen until a portion of the resources\r\nof her Kingdom can be devoted to the extinguishment of its foreign debt.\r\n\r\nHaving received satisfactory evidence that discriminating tonnage duties\r\nwere charged upon the vessels of the United States in the ports of\r\nPortugal, a proclamation was issued on the 11th day of October last, in\r\ncompliance with the act of May 25, 1832, declaring that fact, and the\r\nduties on foreign tonnage which were levied upon Portuguese vessels in the\r\nUnited States previously to the passage of that act are accordingly\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nThe act of July 4, 1836, suspending the discriminating duties upon the\r\nproduce of Portugal imported into this country in Portuguese vessels, was\r\npassed, upon the application of that Government through its representative\r\nhere, under the belief that no similar discrimination existed in Portugal\r\nto the prejudice of the United States. I regret to state that such duties\r\nare now exacted in that country upon the cargoes of American vessels, and\r\nas the act referred to vests no discretion in the Executive, it is for\r\nCongress to determine upon the expediency of further legislation on the\r\nsubject. Against these discriminations affecting the vessels of this\r\ncountry and their cargoes seasonable remonstrance was made, and notice was\r\ngiven to the Portuguese Government that unless they should be discontinued\r\nthe adoption of countervailing measures on the part of the United States\r\nwould become necessary; but the reply of that Government, received at the\r\nDepartment of State through our charge d'affaires at Lisbon in the month of\r\nSeptember last, afforded no ground to hope for the abandonment of a system\r\nso little in harmony with the treatment shown to the vessels of Portugal\r\nand their cargoes in the ports of this country and so contrary to the\r\nexpectations we had a right to entertain.\r\n\r\nWith Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Naples, and Belgium a friendly intercourse\r\nhas been uninterruptedly maintained.\r\n\r\nWith the Government of the Ottoman Porte and its dependencies on the coast\r\nof the Mediterranean peace and good will are carefully cultivated, and have\r\nbeen fostered by such good offices as the relative distance and the\r\ncondition of those countries would permit.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with Greece is carried on under the laws of the two\r\nGovernments, reciprocally beneficial to the navigating interests of both;\r\nand I have reason to look forward to the adoption of other measures which\r\nwill be more extensively and permanently advantageous.\r\n\r\nCopies of the treaties concluded with the Governments of Siam and Muscat\r\nare transmitted for the information of Congress, the ratifications having\r\nbeen received and the treaties made public since the close of the last\r\nannual session. Already have we reason to congratulate ourselves on the\r\nprospect of considerable commercial benefit; and we have, besides, received\r\nfrom the Sultan of Muscat prompt evidence of his desire to cultivate the\r\nmost friendly feelings, by liberal acts toward one of our vessels, bestowed\r\nin a manner so striking as to require on our part a grateful\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico still labors under\r\nheavy restrictions, the continuance of which is a subject of regret. The\r\nonly effect of an adherence to them will be to benefit the navigation of\r\nother countries at the expense of both the United States and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe independent nations of this continent have ever since they emerged from\r\nthe colonial state experienced severe trials in their progress to the\r\npermanent establishment of liberal political institutions. Their unsettled\r\ncondition not only interrupts their own advances to prosperity, but has\r\noften seriously injured the other powers of the world. The claims of our\r\ncitizens upon Peru, Chili, Brazil, the Argentine Republic, the Governments\r\nformed out of the Republics of Colombia and Mexico, are still pending,\r\nalthough many of them have been presented for examination more than twenty\r\nyears. New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador have recently formed a\r\nconvention for the purpose of ascertaining and adjusting claims upon the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, from which it is earnestly hoped our citizens will\r\nere long receive full compensation for the injuries inflicted upon them and\r\nfor the delay in affording it.\r\n\r\nAn advantageous treaty of commerce has been concluded by the United States\r\nwith the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, which wants only the ratification of\r\nthat Government. The progress of a subsequent negotiation for the\r\nsettlement of claims upon Peru has been unfavorably affected by the war\r\nbetween that power and Chili and the Argentine Republic, and the same event\r\nis also likely to produce delays in the settlement of out demands on those\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe aggravating circumstances connected with our claims upon Mexico and a\r\nvariety of events touching the honor and integrity of our Government led my\r\npredecessor to make at the second session of the last Congress a special\r\nrecommendation of the course to be pursued to obtain a speedy and final\r\nsatisfaction of the injuries complained of by this Government and by our\r\ncitizens. He recommended a final demand of redress, with a contingent\r\nauthority to the Executive to make reprisals if that demand should be made\r\nin vain. From the proceedings of Congress on that recommendation it\r\nappeared that the opinion of both branches of the Legislature coincided\r\nwith that of the Executive, that any mode of redress known to the law of\r\nnations might justifiably be used. It was obvious, too, that Congress\r\nbelieved with the President that another demand should be made, in order to\r\ngive undeniable and satisfactory proof of our desire to avoid extremities\r\nwith a neighboring power, but that there was an indisposition to vest a\r\ndiscretionary authority in the Executive to take redress should it\r\nunfortunately be either denied or unreasonably delayed by the Mexican\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the necessary documents were prepared, after entering upon the\r\nduties of my office, a special messenger was sent to Mexico to make a final\r\ndemand of redress, with the documents required by the provisions of our\r\ntreaty. The demand was made on the 20th of July last. The reply, which\r\nbears date the 29th of the same month, contains assurances of a desire on\r\nthe part of that Government to give a prompt and explicit answer respecting\r\neach of the complaints, but that the examination of them would necessarily\r\nbe deliberate; that in this examination it would be guided by the\r\nprinciples of public law and the obligation of treaties; that nothing\r\nshould be left undone that might lead to the most speedy and equitable\r\nadjustment of our demands, and that its determination in respect to each\r\ncase should be communicated through the Mexican minister here.\r\n\r\nSince that time an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary has\r\nbeen accredited to this Government by that of the Mexican Republic. He\r\nbrought with him assurances of a sincere desire that the pending\r\ndifferences between the two Governments should be terminated in a manner\r\nsatisfactory to both. He was received with reciprocal assurances, and a\r\nhope was entertained that his mission would lead to a speedy, satisfactory,\r\nand final adjustment of all existing subjects of complaint. A sincere\r\nbeliever in the wisdom of the pacific policy by which the United States\r\nhave always been governed in their intercourse with foreign nations, it was\r\nmy particular desire, from the proximity of the Mexican Republic and\r\nwell-known occurrences on our frontier, to be instrumental in obviating all\r\nexisting difficulties with that Government and in restoring to the\r\nintercourse between the two Republics that liberal and friendly character\r\nby which they should always be distinguished. I regret, therefore, the more\r\ndeeply to have found in the recent communications of that Government so\r\nlittle reason to hope that any future efforts of mine for the\r\naccomplishment of those desirable objects would be successful.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger number--and many of them aggravated cases of personal\r\nwrongs--have been now for years before the Mexican Government, and some of\r\nthe causes of national complaint, and those of the most offensive\r\ncharacter, admitted of immediate, simple, and satisfactory replies, it is\r\nonly within a few days past that any specific communication in answer to\r\nour last demand, made five months ago, has been received from the Mexican\r\nminister. By the report of the Secretary of State herewith presented and\r\nthe accompanying documents it will be seen that for not one of our public\r\ncomplaints has satisfaction been given or offered, that but one of the\r\ncases of personal wrong has been favorably considered, and that but four\r\ncases of both descriptions out of all those formally presented and\r\nearnestly pressed have as yet been decided upon by the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nNot perceiving in what manner any of the powers given to the Executive\r\nalone could be further usefully employed in bringing this unfortunate\r\ncontroversy to a satisfactory termination, the subject was by my\r\npredecessor referred to Congress as one calling for its interposition. In\r\naccordance with the clearly understood wishes of the Legislature, another\r\nand formal demand for satisfaction has been made upon the Mexican\r\nGovernment, with what success the documents now communicated will show. On\r\na careful and deliberate examination of their contents, and considering the\r\nspirit manifested by the Mexican Government, it has become my painful duty\r\nto return the subject as it now stands to Congress, to whom it belongs to\r\ndecide upon the time, the mode, and the measure of redress. Whatever may be\r\nyour decision, it shall be faithfully executed, confident that it will be\r\ncharacterized by that moderation and justice which will, I trust, under all\r\ncircumstances govern the councils of our country.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on the 1st January, 1837, was $45,968,523. The\r\nreceipts during the present year from all sources, including the amount of\r\nTreasury notes issued, are estimated at $23,499,981, constituting an\r\naggregate of $69,468,504. Of this amount about $35,281,361 will have been\r\nexpended at the end of the year on appropriations made by Congress, and the\r\nresidue, amounting to $34,187,143, will be the nominal balance in the\r\nTreasury on the 1st of January next; but of that sum only $1,085,498 is\r\nconsidered as immediately available for and applicable to public purposes.\r\nThose portions of it which will be for some time unavailable consist\r\nchiefly of sums deposited with the States and due from the former deposit\r\nbanks. The details upon this subject will be found in the annual report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury. The amount of Treasury notes which it will\r\nbe necessary to issue during the year on account of those funds being\r\nunavailable will, it is supposed, not exceed four and a half millions. It\r\nseemed proper, in the condition of the country, to have the estimates on\r\nall subjects made as low as practicable without prejudice to any great\r\npublic measures. The Departments were therefore desired to prepare their\r\nestimates accordingly, and I am happy to find that they have been able to\r\ngraduate them on so economical a scale. In the great and often unexpected\r\nfluctuations to which the revenue is subjected it is not possible to\r\ncompute the receipts beforehand with great certainty, but should they not\r\ndiffer essentially from present anticipations, and should the\r\nappropriations not much exceed the estimates, no difficulty seems likely to\r\nhappen in defraying the current expenses with promptitude and fidelity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great embarrassments which have recently occurred in\r\ncommercial affairs, and the liberal indulgence which in consequence of\r\nthese embarrassments has been extended to both the merchants and the banks,\r\nit is gratifying to be able to anticipate that the Treasury notes which\r\nhave been issued during the present year will be redeemed and that the\r\nresources of the Treasury, without any resort to loans or increased taxes,\r\nwill prove ample for defraying all charges imposed on it during 1838.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will afford you a more minute\r\nexposition of all matters connected with the administration of the finances\r\nduring the current year--a period which for the amount of public moneys\r\ndisbursed and deposited with the States, as well as the financial\r\ndifficulties encountered and overcome, has few parallels in our history.\r\n\r\nYour attention was at the last session invited to the necessity of\r\nadditional legislative provisions in respect to the collection,\r\nsafe-keeping, and transfer of the public money. No law having been then\r\nmatured, and not understanding the proceedings of Congress as intended to\r\nbe final, it becomes my duty again to bring the subject to your notice.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion three modes of performing this branch of the public\r\nservice were presented for consideration. These were, the creation of a\r\nnational bank; the revival, with modifications, of the deposit system\r\nestablished by the act of the 23d of June, 1836, permitting the use of the\r\npublic moneys by the banks; and the discontinuance of the use of such\r\ninstitutions for the purposes referred to, with suitable provisions for\r\ntheir accomplishment through the agency of public officers. Considering the\r\nopinions of both Houses of Congress on the first two propositions as\r\nexpressed in the negative, in which I entirely concur, it is unnecessary\r\nfor me again in to recur to them. In respect to the last, you have had an\r\nopportunity since your adjournment not only to test still further the\r\nexpediency of the measure by the continued practical operation of such\r\nparts of it as are now in force, but also to discover what should ever be\r\nsought for and regarded with the utmost deference--the opinions and wishes\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe national will is the supreme law of the Republic, and on all subjects\r\nwithin the limits of his constitutional powers should be faithfully obeyed\r\nby the public servant. Since the measure in question was submitted to your\r\nconsideration most of you have enjoyed the advantage of personal\r\ncommunication with your constituents. For one State only has an election\r\nbeen held for the Federal Government; but the early day at which it took\r\nplace deprived the measure under consideration of much of the support it\r\nmight otherwise have derived from the result. Local elections for State\r\nofficers have, however, been held in several of the States, at which the\r\nexpediency of the plan proposed by the Executive has been more or less\r\ndiscussed. You will, I am confident, yield to their results the respect due\r\nto every expression of the public voice. Desiring, however, to arrive at\r\ntruth and a just view of the subject in all its bearings, you will at the\r\nsame time remember that questions of far deeper and more immediate local\r\ninterest than the fiscal plans of the National Treasury were involved in\r\nthose elections. Above all, we can not overlook the striking fact that\r\nthere were at the time in those States more than one hundred and sixty\r\nmillions of bank capital, of which large portions were subject to actual\r\nforfeiture, other large portions upheld only by special and limited\r\nlegislative indulgences, and most of it, if not all, to a greater or less\r\nextent dependent for a continuance of its corporate existence upon the will\r\nof the State legislatures to be then chosen. Apprised of this circumstance,\r\nyou will judge whether it is not most probable that the peculiar condition\r\nof that vast interest in these respects, the extent to which it has been\r\nspread through all the ramifications of society, its direct connection with\r\nthe then pending elections, and the feelings it was calculated to infuse\r\ninto the canvass have exercised a far greater influence over the result\r\nthan any which could possibly have been produced by a conflict of opinion\r\nin respect to a question in the administration of the General Government\r\nmore remote and far less important in its bearings upon that interest.\r\n\r\nI have found no reason to change my own opinion as to the expediency of\r\nadopting the system proposed, being perfectly satisfied that there will be\r\nneither stability nor safety either in the fiscal affairs of the Government\r\nor in the pecuniary transactions of individuals and corporations so long as\r\na connection exists between them which, like the past, offers such strong\r\ninducements to make them the subjects of political agitation. Indeed, I am\r\nmore than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased\r\nexercise of political opinion--the only sure foundation and safeguard of\r\nrepublican government--would be exposed by any further increase of the\r\nalready overgrown influence of corporate authorities. I can not, therefore,\r\nconsistently with my views of duty, advise a renewal of a connection which\r\ncircumstances have dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of the use of State banks for fiscal purposes ought not\r\nto be regarded as a measure of hostility toward those institutions. Banks\r\nproperly established and conducted are highly useful to the business of the\r\ncountry, and will doubtless continue to exist in the States so long as they\r\nconform to their laws and are found to be safe and beneficial. How they\r\nshould be created, what privileges they should enjoy, under what\r\nresponsibilities they should act, and to what restrictions they should be\r\nsubject are questions which, as I observed on a previous occasion, belong\r\nto the States to decide. Upon their rights or the exercise of them the\r\nGeneral Government can have no motive to encroach. Its duty toward them is\r\nwell performed when it refrains from legislating for their special benefit,\r\nbecause such legislation would violate the spirit of the Constitution and\r\nbe unjust to other interests; when it takes no steps to impair their\r\nusefulness, but so manages its own affairs as to make it the interest of\r\nthose institutions to strengthen and improve their condition for the\r\nsecurity and welfare of the community at large. They have no right to\r\ninsist on a connection with the Federal Government, nor on the use of the\r\npublic money for their own benefit. The object of the measure under\r\nconsideration is to avoid for the future a compulsory connection of this\r\nkind. It proposes to place the General Government, in regard to the\r\nessential points of the collection, safe-keeping, and transfer of the\r\npublic money, in a situation which shall relieve it from all dependence on\r\nthe will of irresponsible individuals or corporations; to withdraw those\r\nmoneys from the uses of private trade and confide them to agents\r\nconstitutionally selected and controlled by law; to abstain from improper\r\ninterference with the industry of the people and withhold inducements to\r\nimprovident dealings on the part of individuals; to give stability to the\r\nconcerns of the Treasury; to preserve the measures of the Government from\r\nthe unavoidable reproaches that flow from such a connection, and the banks\r\nthemselves from the injurious effects of a supposed participation in the\r\npolitical conflicts of the day, from which they will otherwise find it\r\ndifficult to escape.\r\n\r\nThese are my views upon this important subject, formed after careful\r\nreflection and with no desire but to arrive at what is most likely to\r\npromote the public interest. They are now, as they were before, submitted\r\nwith unfeigned deference for the opinions of others. It was hardly to be\r\nhoped that changes so important on a subject so interesting could be made\r\nwithout producing a serious diversity of opinion; but so long as those\r\nconflicting views are kept above the influence of individual or local\r\ninterests, so long as they pursue only the general good and are discussed\r\nwith moderation and candor, such diversity is a benefit, not an injury. If\r\na majority of Congress see the public welfare in a different light, and\r\nmore especially if they should be satisfied that the measure proposed would\r\nnot be acceptable to the people, I shall look to their wisdom to substitute\r\nsuch as may be more conducive to the one and more satisfactory to the\r\nother. In any event, they may confidently rely on my hearty cooperation to\r\nthe fullest extent to which my views of the Constitution and my sense of\r\nduty will permit.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously important to this branch of the public service and to the\r\nbusiness and quiet of the country that the whole subject should in some way\r\nbe settled and regulated by law, and, if possible, at your present session.\r\nBesides the plans above referred to, I am not aware that any one has been\r\nsuggested except that of keeping the public money in the State banks in\r\nspecial deposit. This plan is to some extent in accordance with the\r\npractice of the Government and with the present arrangements of the\r\nTreasury Department, which, except, perhaps, during the operation of the\r\nlate deposit act, has always been allowed, even during the existence of a\r\nnational bank, to make a temporary use of the State banks in particular\r\nplaces for the safe-keeping of portions of the revenue. This discretionary\r\npower might be continued if Congress deem it desirable, whatever general\r\nsystem be adopted. So long as the connection is voluntary we need, perhaps,\r\nanticipate few of those difficulties and little of that dependence on the\r\nbanks which must attend every such connection when compulsory in its nature\r\nand when so arranged as to make the banks a fixed part of the machinery of\r\ngovernment. It is undoubtedly in the power of Congress so to regulate and\r\nguard it as to prevent the public money from being applied to the use or\r\nintermingled with the affairs of individuals. Thus arranged, although it\r\nwould not give to the Government that entire control over its own funds\r\nwhich I desire to secure to it by the plan I have proposed, it would, it\r\nmust be admitted, in a great degree accomplish one of the objects which has\r\nrecommended that plan to my judgment--the separation of the fiscal concerns\r\nof the Government from those of individuals or corporations.\r\n\r\nWith these observations I recommend the whole matter to your dispassionate\r\nreflection, confidently hoping that some conclusion may be reached by your\r\ndeliberations which on the one hand shall give safety and stability to the\r\nfiscal operations of the Government, and be consistent, on the other, with\r\nthe genius of our institutions and with the interests and wishes of the\r\ngreat mass of our constituents.\r\n\r\nIt was my hope that nothing would occur to make necessary on this occasion\r\nany allusion to the late national bank. There are circumstances, however,\r\nconnected with the present state of its affairs that bear so directly on\r\nthe character of the Government and the welfare of the citizen that I\r\nshould not feel myself excused in neglecting to notice them. The charter\r\nwhich terminated its banking privileges on the 4th of March, 1836,\r\ncontinued its corporate power two years more for the sole purpose of\r\nclosing its affairs, with authority \"to use the corporate name, style, and\r\ncapacity for the purpose of suits for a final settlement and liquidation of\r\nthe affairs and acts of the corporation, and for the sale and disposition\r\nof their estate--real, personal, and mixed--but for no other purpose or in\r\nany other manner whatsoever.\" Just before the banking privileges ceased,\r\nits effects were transferred by the bank to a new State institution, then\r\nrecently incorporated, in trust, for the discharge of its debts and the\r\nsettlement of its affairs. With this trustee, by authority of Congress, an\r\nadjustment was subsequently made of the large interest which the Government\r\nhad in the stock of the institution. The manner in which a trust\r\nunexpectedly created upon the act granting the charter, and involving such\r\ngreat public interests, has been executed would under any circumstances be\r\na fit subject of inquiry; but much more does it deserve your attention when\r\nit embraces the redemption of obligations to which the authority and credit\r\nof the United States have given value. The two years allowed are now nearly\r\nat an end. It is well understood that the trustee has not redeemed and\r\ncanceled the outstanding notes of the bank, but has reissued and is\r\nactually reissuing, since the 3d of March, 1836, the notes which have been\r\nreceived by it to a vast amount. According to its own official statement,\r\nso late as the 1st of October last, nineteen months after the banking\r\nprivileges given by the charter had expired, it had under its control\r\nuncanceled notes of the late Bank of the United States to the amount of\r\n$27,561,866, of which $6,175,861 were in actual circulation, $ 1,468,627 at\r\nState bank agencies, and $3,002,390 in transitu, thus showing that upward\r\nof ten millions and a half of the notes of the old bank were then still\r\nkept outstanding.\r\n\r\nThe impropriety of this procedure is obvious, it being the duty of the\r\ntrustee to cancel and not to put forth the notes of an institution whose\r\nconcerns it had undertaken to wind up. If the trustee has a right to\r\nreissue these notes now, I can see no reason why it may not continue to do\r\nso after the expiration of the two years. As no one could have anticipated\r\na course so extraordinary, the prohibitory clause of the charter above\r\nquoted was not accompanied by any penalty or other special provision for\r\nenforcing it, nor have we any general law for the prevention of similar\r\nacts in future.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in this view of the subject alone that your interposition is\r\nrequired. The United States in settling with the trustee for their stock\r\nhave withdrawn their funds from their former direct liability to the\r\ncreditors of the old bank, yet notes of the institution continue to be sent\r\nforth in its name, and apparently upon the authority of the United States.\r\nThe transactions connected with the employment of the bills of the old bank\r\nare of vast extent, and should they result unfortunately the interests of\r\nindividuals may be deeply compromised. Without undertaking to decide how\r\nfar or in what form, if any, the trustee could be made liable for notes\r\nwhich contain no obligation on its part, or the old bank for such as are\r\nput in circulation after the expiration of its charter and without its\r\nauthority, or the Government for indemnity in case of loss, the question\r\nstill presses itself upon your consideration whether it is consistent with\r\nduty and good faith on the part of the Government to witness this\r\nproceeding without a single effort to arrest it.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, which will be\r\nlaid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury, will show how the affairs\r\nof that office have been conducted for the past year. The disposition of\r\nthe public lands is one of the most important trusts confided to Congress.\r\nThe practicability of retaining the title and control of such extensive\r\ndomains in the General Government, and at the same time admitting the\r\nTerritories embracing them into the Federal Union as coequals with the\r\noriginal States, was seriously doubted by many of our wisest statesmen. All\r\nfeared that they would become a source of discord, and many carried their\r\napprehensions so far as to see in them the seeds of a future dissolution of\r\nthe Confederacy. But happily our experience has already been sufficient to\r\nquiet in a great degree all such apprehensions. The position at one time\r\nassumed, that the admission of new States into the Union on the same\r\nfooting with the original States was incompatible with a right of soil in\r\nthe United States and operated as a surrender thereof, notwithstanding the\r\nterms of the compacts by which their admission was designed to be\r\nregulated, has been wisely abandoned. Whether in the new or the old States,\r\nall now agree that the right of soil to the public lands remains in the\r\nFederal Government, and that these lands constitute a common property, to\r\nbe disposed of for the common benefit of all the States, old and new.\r\nAcquiescence in this just principle by the people of the new States has\r\nnaturally promoted a disposition to adopt the most liberal policy in the\r\nsale of the public lands. A policy which should be limited to the mere\r\nobject of selling the lands for the greatest possible sum of money, without\r\nregard to higher considerations, finds but few advocates. On the contrary,\r\nit is generally conceded that whilst the mode of disposition adopted by the\r\nGovernment should always be a prudent one, yet its leading object ought to\r\nbe the early settlement and cultivation of the lands sold, and that it\r\nshould discountenance, if it can not prevent, the accumulation of large\r\ntracts in the same hands, which must necessarily retard the growth of the\r\nnew States or entail upon them a dependent tenantry and its attendant\r\nevils.\r\n\r\nA question embracing such important interests and so well calculated to\r\nenlist the feelings of the people in every quarter of the Union has very\r\nnaturally given rise to numerous plans for the improvement of the existing\r\nsystem. The distinctive features of the policy that has hitherto prevailed\r\nare to dispose of the public lands at moderate prices, thus enabling a\r\ngreater number to enter into competition for their purchase and\r\naccomplishing a double object--of promoting their rapid settlement by the\r\npurchasers and at the same time increasing the receipts of the Treasury; to\r\nsell for cash, thereby preventing the disturbing influence of a large mass\r\nof private citizens indebted to the Government which they have a voice in\r\ncontrolling; to bring them into market no faster than good lands are\r\nsupposed to be wanted for improvement, thereby preventing the accumulation\r\nof large tracts in few hands; and to apply the proceeds of the sales to the\r\ngeneral purposes of the Government, thus diminishing the amount to be\r\nraised from the people of the States by taxation and giving each State its\r\nportion of the benefits to be derived from this common fund in a manner the\r\nmost quiet, and at the same time, perhaps, the most equitable, that can be\r\ndevised. These provisions, with occasional enactments in behalf of special\r\ninterests deemed entitled to the favor of the Government, have in their\r\nexecution produced results as beneficial upon the whole as could reasonably\r\nbe expected in a matter so vast, so complicated, and so exciting. Upward of\r\n70,000,000, acres have been sold, the greater part of which is believed to\r\nhave been purchased for actual settlement. The population of the new States\r\nand Territories created out of the public domain increased between 1800 and\r\n1830 from less than 60,000 to upward of 2,300,000 souls, constituting at\r\nthe latter period about one-fifth of the whole people of the United States.\r\nThe increase since can not be accurately known, but the whole may now be\r\nsafely estimated at over three and a half millions of souls, composing nine\r\nStates, the representatives of which constitute above one-third of the\r\nSenate and over one-sixth of the House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThus has been formed a body of free and independent landholders with a\r\nrapidity unequaled in the history of mankind; and this great result has\r\nbeen produced without leaving anything for future adjustment between the\r\nGovernment and its citizens. The system under which so much has been\r\naccomplished can not be intrinsically bad, and with occasional\r\nmodifications to correct abuses and adapt it to changes of circumstances\r\nmay, I think, be safely trusted for the future. There is in the management\r\nof such extensive interests much virtue in stability; and although great\r\nand obvious improvements should not be declined, changes should never be\r\nmade without the fullest examination and the clearest demonstration of\r\ntheir practical utility. In the history of the past we have an assurance\r\nthat this safe rule of action will not be departed from in relation to the\r\npublic lands; nor is it believed that any necessity exists for interfering\r\nwith the fundamental principles of the system, or that the public mind,\r\neven in the new States, is desirous of any radical alterations. On the\r\ncontrary, the general disposition appears to be to make such modifications\r\nand additions only as will the more effectually carry out the original\r\npolicy of filling our new States and Territories with an industrious and\r\nindependent population.\r\n\r\nThe modification most perseveringly pressed upon Congress, which has\r\noccupied so much of its time for years past, and will probably do so for a\r\nlong time to come, if not sooner satisfactorily adjusted, is a reduction in\r\nthe cost of such portions of the public lands as are ascertained to be\r\nunsalable at the rate now established by law, and a graduation according to\r\ntheir relative value of the prices at which they may hereafter be sold. It\r\nis worthy of consideration whether justice may not be done to every\r\ninterest in this matter, and a vexed question set at rest, perhaps forever,\r\nby a reasonable compromise of conflicting opinions. Hitherto, after being\r\noffered at public sale, lands have been disposed of at one uniform price,\r\nwhatever difference there might be in their intrinsic value. The leading\r\nconsiderations urged in favor of the measure referred to are that in almost\r\nall the land districts, and particularly in those in which the lands have\r\nbeen long surveyed and exposed to sale, there are still remaining numerous\r\nand large tracts of every gradation of value, from the Government price\r\ndownward; that these lands will not be purchased at the Government price so\r\nlong as better can be conveniently obtained for the same amount; that there\r\nare large tracts which even the improvements of the adjacent lands will\r\nnever raise to that price, and that the present uniform price, combined\r\nwith their irregular value, operates to prevent a desirable compactness of\r\nsettlements in the new States and to retard the full development of that\r\nwise policy on which our land system is founded, to the injury not only of\r\nthe several States where the lands lie, but of the United States as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe remedy proposed has been a reduction of the prices according to the\r\nlength of time the lands have been in market, without reference to any\r\nother circumstances. The certainty that the efflux of time would not always\r\nin such cases, and perhaps not even generally, furnish a true criterion of\r\nvalue, and the probability that persons residing in the vicinity, as the\r\nperiod for the reduction of prices approached, would postpone purchases\r\nthey would otherwise make, for the purpose of availing themselves of the\r\nlower price, with other considerations of a similar character, have\r\nhitherto been successfully urged to defeat the graduation upon time.\r\n\r\nMay not all reasonable desires upon this subject be satisfied without\r\nencountering any of these objections? All will concede the abstract\r\nprinciple that the price of the public lands should be proportioned to\r\ntheir relative value, so far as can be accomplished without departing from\r\nthe rule heretofore observed requiring fixed prices in cases of private\r\nentries. The difficulty of the subject seems to lie in the mode of\r\nascertaining what that value is. Would not the safest plan be that which\r\nhas been adopted by many of the States as the basis of taxation--an actual\r\nvaluation of lands and classification of them into different rates? Would\r\nit not be practicable and expedient to cause the relative value of the\r\npublic lands in the old districts which have been for a certain length of\r\ntime in market to be appraised and classed into two or more rates below the\r\npresent minimum price by the officers now employed in this branch of the\r\npublic service or in any other mode deemed preferable, and to make those\r\nprices permanent if upon the coming in of the report they shall prove\r\nsatisfactory to Congress? Could not all the objects of graduation be\r\naccomplished in this way, and the objections which have hitherto been urged\r\nagainst it avoided? It would seem to me that such a step, with a\r\nrestriction of the sales to limited quantities and for actual improvement,\r\nwould be free from all just exception.\r\n\r\nBy the full exposition of the value of the lands thus furnished and\r\nextensively promulgated persons living at a distance would be informed of\r\ntheir true condition and enabled to enter into competition with those\r\nresiding in the vicinity; the means of acquiring an independent home would\r\nbe brought within the reach of many who are unable to purchase at present\r\nprices; the population of the new States would be made more compact, and\r\nlarge tracts would be sold which would otherwise remain on hand. Not only\r\nwould the land be brought within the means of a larger number of\r\npurchasers, but many persons possessed of greater means would be content to\r\nsettle on a larger quantity of the poorer lands rather than emigrate\r\nfarther west in pursuit of a smaller quantity of better lands. Such a\r\nmeasure would also seem to be more consistent with the policy of the\r\nexisting laws--that of converting the public domain into cultivated farms\r\nowned by their occupants. That policy is not best promoted by sending\r\nemigration up the almost interminable streams of the West to occupy in\r\ngroups the best spots of land, leaving immense wastes behind them and\r\nenlarging the frontier beyond the means of the Government to afford it\r\nadequate protection, but in encouraging it to occupy with reasonable\r\ndenseness the territory over which it advances, and find its best defense\r\nin the compact front which it presents to the Indian tribes. Many of you\r\nwill bring to the consideration of the subject the advantages of local\r\nknowledge and greater experience, and all will be desirous of making an\r\nearly and final disposition of every disturbing question in regard to this\r\nimportant interest. If these suggestions shall in any degree contribute to\r\nthe accomplishment of so important a result, it will afford me sincere\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country most of the public lands have been sold,\r\nand the registers and receivers have very little to do. It is a subject\r\nworthy of inquiry whether in many cases two or more districts may not be\r\nconsolidated and the number of persons employed in this business\r\nconsiderably reduced. Indeed, the time will come when it will be the true\r\npolicy of the General Government, as to some of the States, to transfer to\r\nthem for a reasonable equivalent all the refuse and unsold lands and to\r\nwithdraw the machinery of the Federal land offices altogether. All who take\r\na comprehensive view of our federal system and believe that one of its\r\ngreatest excellencies consists in interfering as little as possible with\r\nthe internal concerns of the States look forward with great interest to\r\nthis result.\r\n\r\nA modification of the existing laws in respect to the prices of the public\r\nlands might also have a favorable influence on the legislation of Congress\r\nin relation to another branch of the subject. Many who have not the ability\r\nto buy at present prices settle on those lands with the hope of acquiring\r\nfrom their cultivation the means of purchasing under preemption laws from\r\ntime to time passed by Congress. For this encroachment on the rights of the\r\nUnited States they excuse themselves under the plea of their own\r\nnecessities; the fact that they dispossess nobody and only enter upon the\r\nwaste domain: that they give additional value to the public lands in their\r\nvicinity, and their intention ultimately to pay the Government price. So\r\nmuch weight has from time to time been attached to these considerations\r\nthat Congress have passed laws giving actual settlers on the public lands a\r\nright of preemption to the tracts occupied by them at the minimum price.\r\nThese laws have in all instances been retrospective in their operation, but\r\nin a few years after their passage crowds of new settlers have been found\r\non the public lands for similar reasons and under like expectations, who\r\nhave been indulged with the same privilege. This course of legislation\r\ntends to impair public respect for the laws of the country. Either the laws\r\nto prevent intrusion upon the public lands should be executed, or, if that\r\nshould be impracticable or inexpedient, they should be modified or\r\nrepealed. If the public lands are to be considered as open to be occupied\r\nby any, they should by law be thrown open to all. That which is intended in\r\nall instances to be legalized should at once be made legal, that those who\r\nare disposed to conform to the laws may enjoy at least equal privileges\r\nwith those who are not. But it is not believed to be the disposition of\r\nCongress to open the public lands to occupancy without regular entry and\r\npayment of the Government price, as such a course must tend to worse evils\r\nthan the credit system, which it was found necessary to abolish.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, to be the part of wisdom and sound policy to\r\nremove as far as practicable the causes which produce intrusions upon the\r\npublic lands, and then take efficient steps to prevent them in future.\r\nWould any single measure be so effective in removing all plausible grounds\r\nfor these intrusions as the graduation of price already suggested? A short\r\nperiod of industry and economy in any part of our country would enable the\r\npoorest citizen to accumulate the means to buy him a home at the lower\r\nprices, and leave him without apology for settling on lands not his own. If\r\nhe did not under such circumstances, he would enlist no sympathy in his\r\nfavor, and the laws would be readily executed without doing violence to\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nA large portion of our citizens have seated themselves on the public lands\r\nwithout authority since the passage of the last preemption law, and now ask\r\nthe enactment of another to enable them to retain the lands occupied upon\r\npayment of the minimum Government price. They ask that which has been\r\nrepeatedly granted before. If the future may be judged of by the past,\r\nlittle harm can be done to the interests of the Treasury by yielding to\r\ntheir request. Upon a critical examination it is found that the lands sold\r\nat the public sales since the introduction of cash payments, in 1820, have\r\nproduced on an average the net revenue of only 6 cents an acre more than\r\nthe minimum Government price. There is no reason to suppose that future\r\nsales will be more productive. The Government, therefore, has no adequate\r\npecuniary interest to induce it to drive these people from the lands they\r\noccupy for the purpose of selling them to others.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these views, I recommend the passage of a preemption law for\r\ntheir benefit in connection with the preparatory steps toward the\r\ngraduation of the price of the public lands, and further and more effectual\r\nprovisions to prevent intrusions hereafter. Indulgence to those who have\r\nsettled on these lands with expectations that past legislation would be\r\nmade a rule for the future, and at the same time removing the most\r\nplausible ground on which intrusions are excused and adopting more\r\nefficient means to prevent them hereafter, appears to me the most judicious\r\ndisposition which can be made of this difficult subject. The limitations\r\nand restrictions to guard against abuses in the execution of a preemption\r\nlaw will necessarily attract the careful attention of Congress, but under\r\nno circumstances is it considered expedient to authorize floating claims in\r\nany shape. They have been heretofore, and doubtless would be hereafter,\r\nmost prolific sources of fraud and oppression, and instead of operating to\r\nconfer the favor of the Government on industrious settlers are often used\r\nonly to minister to a spirit of cupidity at the expense of the most\r\nmeritorious of that class.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War will bring to your view the\r\nstate of the Army and all the various subjects confided to the\r\nsuperintendence of that officer.\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the Army has been concentrated in Florida, with a\r\nview and in the expectation of bringing the war in that Territory to a\r\nspeedy close. The necessity of stripping the posts on the maritime and\r\ninland frontiers of their entire garrisons for the purpose of assembling in\r\nthe field an army of less than 4,000 men would seem to indicate the\r\nnecessity of increasing our regular forces; and the superior efficiency, as\r\nwell as greatly diminished expense of that description of troops, recommend\r\nthis measure as one of economy as well as of expediency. I refer to the\r\nreport for the reasons which have induced the Secretary of War to urge the\r\nreorganization and enlargement of the staff of the Army, and of the\r\nOrdnance Corps, in which I fully concur.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, compatible with the interests of the people to maintain\r\nin time of peace a regular force adequate to the defense of our extensive\r\nfrontiers. In periods of danger and alarm we must rely principally upon a\r\nwell-organized militia, and some general arrangement that will render this\r\ndescription of force more efficient has long been a subject of anxious\r\nsolicitude. It was recommended to the First Congress by General Washington,\r\nand has been since frequently brought to your notice, and recently its\r\nimportance strongly urged by my immediate predecessor. The provision in the\r\nConstitution that renders it necessary to adopt a uniform system of\r\norganization for the militia throughout the United States presents an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to an efficient arrangement by the classification\r\nheretofore proposed, and I invite your attention to the plan which will be\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary of War, for the organization of volunteer corps\r\nand the instruction of militia officers, as more simple and practicable, if\r\nnot equally advantageous, as a general arrangement of the whole militia of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nA moderate increase of the corps both of military and topographical\r\nengineers has been more than once recommended by my predecessor, and my\r\nconviction of the propriety, not to say necessity, of the measure, in order\r\nto enable them to perform the various and important duties imposed upon\r\nthem, induces me to repeat the recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy continues to answer all the purposes of its\r\nestablishment, and not only furnishes well-educated officers to the Army,\r\nbut serves to diffuse throughout the mass of our citizens individuals\r\npossessed of military knowledge and the scientific attainments of civil and\r\nmilitary engineering. At present the cadet is bound, with consent of his\r\nparents or guardians, to remain in service five years from the period of\r\nhis enlistment, unless sooner discharged, thus exacting only one year's\r\nservice in the Army after his education is completed. This does not appear\r\nto me sufficient. Government ought to command for a longer period the\r\nservices of those who are educated at the public expense, and I recommend\r\nthat the time of enlistment be extended to seven years, and the terms of\r\nthe engagement strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a national foundry for cannon, to be common to the service\r\nof the Army and Navy of the United States, has been heretofore recommended,\r\nand appears to be required in order to place our ordnance on an equal\r\nfooting with that of other countries and to enable that branch of the\r\nservice to control the prices of those articles and graduate the supplies\r\nto the wants of the Government, as well as to regulate their quality and\r\ninsure their uniformity. The same reasons induce me to recommend the\r\nerection of a manufactory of gunpowder, to be under the direction of the\r\nOrdnance Office. The establishment of a manufactory of small arms west of\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains, upon the plan proposed by the Secretary of War,\r\nwill contribute to extend throughout that country the improvements which\r\nexist in establishments of a similar description in the Atlantic States,\r\nand tend to a much more economical distribution of the armament required in\r\nthe western portion of our Union.\r\n\r\nThe system of removing the Indians west of the Mississippi, commenced by\r\nMr. Jefferson in 1804, has been steadily persevered in by every succeeding\r\nPresident, and may be considered the settled policy of the country.\r\nUnconnected at first with any well-defined system for their improvement,\r\nthe inducements held out to the Indians were confined to the greater\r\nabundance of game to be found in the West; but when the beneficial effects\r\nof their removal were made apparent a more philanthropic and enlightened\r\npolicy was adopted in purchasing their lands east of the Mississippi.\r\nLiberal prices were given and provisions inserted in all the treaties with\r\nthem for the application of the funds they received in exchange to such\r\npurposes as were best calculated to promote their present welfare and\r\nadvance their future civilization. These measures have been attended thus\r\nfar with the happiest results.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by referring to the report of the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs that the most sanguine expectations of the friends and promoters of\r\nthis system have been realized. The Choctaws, Cherokees, and other tribes\r\nthat first emigrated beyond the Mississippi have for the most part\r\nabandoned the hunter state and become cultivators of the soil. The\r\nimprovement in their condition has been rapid, and it is believed that they\r\nare now fitted to enjoy the advantages of a simple form of government,\r\nwhich has been submitted to them and received their sanction; and I can not\r\ntoo strongly urge this subject upon the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nStipulations have been made with all the Indian tribes to remove them\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, except with the bands of the Wyandots, the Six\r\nNations in New York, the Menomonees, Munsees, and Stockbridges in\r\nWisconsin, and Miamies in Indiana. With all but the Menomonees it is\r\nexpected that arrangements for their emigration will be completed the\r\npresent year. The resistance which has been opposed to their removal by\r\nsome of the tribes even after treaties had been made with them to that\r\neffect has arisen from various causes, operating differently on each of\r\nthem. In most instances they have been instigated to resistance by persons\r\nto whom the trade with them and the acquisition of their annuities were\r\nimportant, and in some by the personal influence of interested chiefs.\r\nThese obstacles must be overcome, for the Government can not relinquish the\r\nexecution of this policy without sacrificing important interests and\r\nabandoning the tribes remaining east of the Mississippi to certain\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in numbers of the tribes within the limits of the States and\r\nTerritories has been most rapid. If they be removed, they can be protected\r\nfrom those associations and evil practices which exert so pernicious and\r\ndestructive an influence over their destinies. They can be induced to labor\r\nand to acquire property, and its acquisition will inspire them with a\r\nfeeling of independence. Their minds can be cultivated, and they can be\r\ntaught the value of salutary and uniform laws and be made sensible of the\r\nblessings of free government and capable of enjoying its advantages. In the\r\npossession of property, knowledge, and a good government, free to give what\r\ndirection they please to their labor, and sharers in the legislation by\r\nwhich their persons and the profits of their industry are to be protected\r\nand secured, they will have an ever-present conviction of the importance of\r\nunion and peace among themselves and of the preservation of amicable\r\nrelations with us. The interests of the United States would also be greatly\r\npromoted by freeing the relations between the General and State Governments\r\nfrom what has proved a most embarrassing incumbrance by a satisfactory\r\nadjustment of conflicting titles to lands caused by the occupation of the\r\nIndians, and by causing the resources of the whole country to be developed\r\nby the power of the State and General Governments and improved by the\r\nenterprise of a white population.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with this subject is the obligation of the Government\r\nto fulfill its treaty stipulations and to protect the Indians thus\r\nassembled \"at their new residences from all interruptions and disturbances\r\nfrom any other tribes or nations of Indians or from any other person or\r\npersons whatsoever,\" and the equally solemn obligation to guard from Indian\r\nhostility its own border settlements, stretching along a line of more than\r\n1,000 miles. To enable the Government to redeem this pledge to the Indians\r\nand to afford adequate protection to its own citizens will require the\r\ncontinual presence of a considerable regular force on the frontiers and the\r\nestablishment of a chain of permanent posts. Examinations of the country\r\nare now making, with a view to decide on the most suitable points for the\r\nerection of fortresses and other works of defense, the results of which\r\nwill be presented to you by the Secretary of War at an early day, together\r\nwith a plan for the effectual protection of the friendly Indians and the\r\npermanent defense of the frontier States.\r\n\r\nBy the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith communicated it appears\r\nthat unremitted exertions have been made at the different navy-yards to\r\ncarry into effect all authorized measures for the extension and employment\r\nof our naval force. The launching and preparation of the ship of the line\r\nPennsylvania and the complete repairs of the ships of the line Ohio,\r\nDelaware, and Columbus may be noticed as forming a respectable addition to\r\nthis important arm of our national defense. Our commerce and navigation\r\nhave received increased aid and protection during the present year. Our\r\nsquadrons in the Pacific and on the Brazilian station have been much\r\nincreased, and that in the Mediterranean, although small, is adequate to\r\nthe present wants of our commerce in that sea. Additions have been made to\r\nour squadron on the West India station, where the large force under\r\nCommodore Dallas has been most actively and efficiently employed in\r\nprotecting our commerce, in preventing the importation of slaves, and in\r\ncooperating with the officers of the Army in carrying on the war in\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nThe satisfactory condition of our naval force abroad leaves at our disposal\r\nthe means of conveniently providing for a home squadron for the protection\r\nof commerce upon our extensive coast. The amount of appropriations required\r\nfor such a squadron will be found in the general estimates for the naval\r\nservice for the year 1838.\r\n\r\nThe naval officers engaged upon our coast survey have rendered important\r\nservice to our navigation. The discovery of a new channel into the harbor\r\nof New York, through which our largest ships may pass without danger, must\r\nafford important commercial advantages to that harbor and add greatly to\r\nits value as a naval station. The accurate survey of Georges Shoals, off\r\nthe coast of Massachusetts, lately completed, will render comparatively\r\nsafe a navigation hitherto considered dangerous.\r\n\r\nConsiderable additions have been made to the number of captains,\r\ncommanders, lieutenants, surgeons, and assistant surgeons in the Navy.\r\nThese additions were rendered necessary by the increased number of vessels\r\nput in commission to answer the exigencies of our growing commerce.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the various suggestions of the\r\nSecretary for the improvement of the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General exhibits the progress and condition of\r\nthe mail service. The operations of the Post-Office Department constitute\r\none of the most active elements of our national prosperity, and it is\r\ngratifying to observe with what vigor they are conducted. The mail routes\r\nof the United States cover an extent of about 142,877 miles, having been\r\nincreased about 37,103 miles within the last two years. The annual mail\r\ntransportation on these routes is about 36,228,962 miles, having been\r\nincreased about 10,359,476 miles within the same period. The number of\r\npost-offices has also been increased from 10,770 to 12,099, very few of\r\nwhich receive the mails less than once a week, and a large portion of them\r\ndaily. Contractors and postmasters in general are represented as attending\r\nto their duties with most commendable zeal and fidelity. The revenue of the\r\nDepartment within the year ending on the 30th of June last was\r\n$4,137,056.59, and its liabilities accruing within the same time were\r\n$3,380,847.75. The increase of revenue over that of the preceding year was\r\n$708,166.41.\r\n\r\nFor many interesting details I refer you to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, with the accompanying papers, Your particular attention\r\nis invited to the necessity of providing a more safe and convenient\r\nbuilding for the accommodation of that Department.\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of reports submitted in pursuance of a call\r\nmade by me upon the heads of Departments for such suggestions as their\r\nexperience might enable them to make as to what further legislative\r\nprovisions may be advantageously adopted to secure the faithful application\r\nof public moneys to the objects for which they are appropriated, to prevent\r\ntheir misapplication or embezzlement by those intrusted with the\r\nexpenditure of them, and generally to increase the security of the\r\nGovernment against losses in their disbursement. It is needless to dilate\r\non the importance of providing such new safeguards as are within the power\r\nof legislation to promote these ends, and I have little to add to the\r\nrecommendations submitted in the accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nBy law the terms of service of our most important collecting and disbursing\r\nofficers in the civil departments are limited to four years, and when\r\nreappointed their bonds are required to be renewed. The safety of the\r\npublic is much increased by this feature of the law, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that its application to all officers intrusted with the collection or\r\ndisbursement of the public money, whatever may be the tenure of their\r\noffices, would be equally beneficial. I therefore recommend, in addition to\r\nsuch of the suggestions presented by the heads of Departments as you may\r\nthink useful, a general provision that all officers of the Army or Navy, or\r\nin the civil departments, intrusted with the receipt or payment of public\r\nmoney, and whose term of service is either unlimited or for a longer time\r\nthan four years, be required to give new bonds, with good and sufficient\r\nsureties, at the expiration of every such period.\r\n\r\nA change in the period of terminating the fiscal year, from the 1st of\r\nOctober to the 1st of April, has been frequently recommended, and appears\r\nto be desirable.\r\n\r\nThe distressing casualties in steamboats which have so frequently happened\r\nduring the year seem to evince the necessity of attempting to prevent them\r\nby means of severe provisions connected with their customhouse papers. This\r\nsubject was submitted to the attention of Congress by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury in his last annual report, and will be again noticed at the\r\npresent session, with additional details. It will doubtless receive that\r\nearly and careful consideration which its pressing importance appears to\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nYour attention has heretofore been frequently called to the affairs of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and I should not again ask it did not their entire\r\ndependence on Congress give them a constant claim upon its notice.\r\nSeparated by the Constitution from the rest of the Union, limited in\r\nextent, and aided by no legislature of its own, it would seem to be a spot\r\nwhere a wise and uniform system of local government might have been easily\r\nadopted. This District has, however, unfortunately been left to linger\r\nbehind the rest of the Union. Its codes, civil and criminal, are not only\r\nvery defective, but full of obsolete or inconvenient provisions. Being\r\nformed of portions of two States, discrepancies in the laws prevail in\r\ndifferent parts of the territory, small as it is; and although it was\r\nselected as the seat of the General Government, the site of its public\r\nedifices, the depository of its archives, and the residence of officers\r\nintrusted with large amounts of public property and the management of\r\npublic business, yet it has never been subjected to or received that\r\nspecial and comprehensive legislation which these circumstances peculiarly\r\ndemand. I am well aware of the various subjects of greater magnitude and\r\nimmediate interest that press themselves on the consideration of Congress,\r\nbut I believe there is not one that appeals more directly to its justice\r\nthan a liberal and even generous attention to the interests of the District\r\nof Columbia and a thorough and careful revision of its local government.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nMartin van Buren\r\nDecember 3, 1838\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the favorable circumstances in the condition of our\r\ncountry under which you reassemble for the performance of your official\r\nduties. Though the anticipations of an abundant harvest have not everywhere\r\nbeen realized, yet on the whole the labors of the husbandman are rewarded\r\nwith a bountiful return; industry prospers in its various channels of\r\nbusiness and enterprise; general health again prevails through our vast\r\ndiversity of climate; nothing threatens from abroad the continuance of\r\nexternal peace; nor has anything at home impaired the strength of those\r\nfraternal and domestic ties which constitute the only guaranty to the\r\nsuccess and permanency of our happy Union, and which, formed in the hour of\r\nperil, have hitherto been honorably sustained through every vicissitude in\r\nour national affairs. These blessings, which evince the care and\r\nbeneficence of Providence, call for our devout and fervent gratitude.\r\n\r\nWe have not less reason to be grateful for other bounties bestowed by the\r\nsame munificent hand, and more exclusively our own.\r\n\r\nThe present year closes the first half century of our Federal institutions,\r\nand our system, differing from all others in the acknowledged practical and\r\nunlimited operation which it has for so long a period given to the\r\nsovereignty of the people, has now been fully tested by experience.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution devised by our forefathers as the framework and bond of\r\nthat system, then untried, has become a settled form of government; not\r\nonly preserving and protecting the great principles upon which it was\r\nrounded, but wonderfully promoting individual happiness and private\r\ninterests. Though subject to change and entire revocation whenever deemed\r\ninadequate to all these purposes, yet such is the wisdom of its\r\nconstruction and so stable has been the public sentiment that it remains\r\nunaltered except in matters of detail comparatively unimportant. It has\r\nproved amply sufficient for the various emergencies incident to our\r\ncondition as a nation. A formidable foreign war; agitating collisions\r\nbetween domestic, and in some respects rival, sovereignties; temptations to\r\ninterfere in the intestine commotions of neighboring countries; the\r\ndangerous influences that arise in periods of excessive prosperity, and the\r\nantirepublican tendencies of associated wealth--these, with other trials\r\nnot less formidable, have all been encountered, and thus far successfully\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the American Union to test the advantages of a\r\ngovernment entirely dependent on the continual exercise of the popular\r\nwill, and our experience has shown that it is as beneficent in practice as\r\nit is just in theory. Each successive change made in our local institutions\r\nhas contributed to extend the right of suffrage, has increased the direct\r\ninfluence of the mass of the community, given greater freedom to individual\r\nexertion, and restricted more and more the powers of Government; yet the\r\nintelligence, prudence, and patriotism of the people have kept pace with\r\nthis augmented responsibility. In no country has education been so widely\r\ndiffused. Domestic peace has nowhere so largely reigned. The close bonds of\r\nsocial intercourse have in no instance prevailed with such harmony over a\r\nspace so vast. All forms of religion have united for the first time to\r\ndiffuse charity and piety, because for the first time in the history of\r\nnations all have been totally untrammeled and absolutely free. The deepest\r\nrecesses of the wilderness have been penetrated; yet instead of the\r\nrudeness in the social condition consequent upon such adventures elsewhere,\r\nnumerous communities have sprung up, already unrivaled in prosperity,\r\ngeneral intelligence, internal tranquillity, and the wisdom of their\r\npolitical institutions. Internal improvement, the fruit of individual\r\nenterprise, fostered by the protection of the States, has added new links\r\nto the Confederation and fresh rewards to provident industry. Doubtful\r\nquestions of domestic policy have been quietly settled by mutual\r\nforbearance, and agriculture, commerce, and manufactures minister to each\r\nother. Taxation and public debt, the burdens which bear so heavily upon all\r\nother countries, have pressed with comparative lightness upon us. Without\r\none entangling alliance, our friendship is prized by every nation, and the\r\nrights of our citizens are everywhere respected, because they are known to\r\nbe guarded by a united, sensitive, and watchful people.\r\n\r\nTo this practical operation of our institutions, so evident and successful,\r\nwe owe that increased attachment to them which is among the most cheering\r\nexhibitions of popular sentiment and will prove their best security in time\r\nto come against foreign or domestic assault.\r\n\r\nThis review of the results of our institutions for half a century, without\r\nexciting a spirit of vain exultation, should serve to impress upon us the\r\ngreat principles from which they have sprung--constant and direct\r\nsupervision by the people over every public measure, strict forbearance on\r\nthe part of the Government from exercising any doubtful or disputed powers,\r\nand a cautious abstinence from all interference with concerns which\r\nproperly belong and are best left to State regulations and individual\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nFull information of the state of our foreign affairs having been recently\r\non different occasions submitted to Congress, I deem it necessary now to\r\nbring to your notice only such events as have subsequently occurred or are\r\nof such importance as to require particular attention.\r\n\r\nThe most amicable dispositions continue to be exhibited by all the nations\r\nwith whom the Government and citizens of the United States have an habitual\r\nintercourse. At the date of my last annual message Mexico was the only\r\nnation which could not be included in so gratifying a reference to our\r\nforeign relations.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be now able to inform you that an advance has been made\r\ntoward the adjustment of our differences with that Republic and the\r\nrestoration of the customary good feeling between the two nations. This\r\nimportant change has been effected by conciliatory negotiations that have\r\nresulted in the conclusion of a treaty between the two Governments, which,\r\nwhen ratified, will refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power all the\r\nsubjects of controversy between us growing out of injuries to individuals.\r\nThere is at present also reason to believe that an equitable settlement of\r\nall disputed points will be attained without further difficulty or\r\nunnecessary delay, and thus authorize the free resumption of diplomatic\r\nintercourse with our sister Republic.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the northeastern boundary of the United States, no official\r\ncorrespondence between this Government and that of Great Britain has passed\r\nsince that communicated to Congress toward the close of their last session.\r\nThe offer to negotiate a convention for the appointment of a joint\r\ncommission of survey and exploration I am, however, assured will be met by\r\nHer Majesty's Government in a conciliatory and friendly spirit, and\r\ninstructions to enable the British minister here to conclude such an\r\narrangement will be transmitted to him without needless delay. It is hoped\r\nand expected that these instructions will be of a liberal character, and\r\nthat this negotiation, if successful, will prove to be an important step\r\ntoward the satisfactory and final adjustment of the controversy.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that the respect for the laws and regard for the peace and\r\nhonor of their own country which have ever characterized the citizens of\r\nthe United States would have prevented any portion of them from using any\r\nmeans to promote insurrection in the territory of a power with which we are\r\nat peace, and with which the United States are desirous of maintaining the\r\nmost friendly relations. I regret deeply, however, to be obliged to inform\r\nyou that this has not been the case. Information has been given to me,\r\nderived from official and other sources, that many citizens of the United\r\nStates have associated together to make hostile incursions from our\r\nterritory into Canada and to aid and abet insurrection there, in violation\r\nof the obligations and laws of the United States and in open disregard of\r\ntheir own duties as citizens. This information has been in part confirmed\r\nby a hostile invasion actually made by citizens of the United States, in\r\nconjunction with Canadians and others, and accompanied by a forcible\r\nseizure of the property of our citizens and an application thereof to the\r\nprosecution of military operations against the authorities and people of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe results of these criminal assaults upon the peace and order of a\r\nneighboring country have been, as was to be expected, fatally destructive\r\nto the misguided or deluded persons engaged in them and highly injurious to\r\nthose in whose behalf they are professed to have been undertaken. The\r\nauthorities in Canada, from intelligence received of such intended\r\nmovements among our citizens, have felt themselves obliged to take\r\nprecautionary measures against them; have actually embodied the militia and\r\nassumed an attitude to repel the invasion to which they believed the\r\ncolonies were exposed from the United States. A state of feeling on both\r\nsides of the frontier has thus been produced which called for prompt and\r\nvigorous interference. If an insurrection existed in Canada, the amicable\r\ndispositions of the United States toward Great Britain, as well as their\r\nduty to themselves, would lead them to maintain a strict neutrality and to\r\nrestrain their citizens from all violations of the laws which have been\r\npassed for its enforcement. But this Government recognizes a still higher\r\nobligation to repress all attempts on the part of its citizens to disturb\r\nthe peace of a country where order prevails or has been reestablished.\r\nDepredations by our citizens upon nations at peace with the United States,\r\nor combinations for committing them, have at all times been regarded by the\r\nAmerican Government and people with the greatest abhorrence. Military\r\nincursions by our citizens into countries so situated, and the commission\r\nof acts of violence on the members thereof, in order to effect a change in\r\ntheir government, or under any pretext whatever, have from the commencement\r\nof our Government been held equally criminal on the part of those engaged\r\nin them, and as much deserving of punishment as would be the disturbance of\r\nthe public peace by the perpetration of similar acts within our own\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nBy no country or persons have these invaluable principles of international\r\nlaw--principles the strict observance of which is so indispensable to the\r\npreservation of social order in the world--been more earnestly cherished or\r\nsacredly respected than by those great and good men who first declared and\r\nfinally established the independence of our own country. They promulgated\r\nand maintained them at an early and critical period in our history; they\r\nwere subsequently embodied in legislative enactments of a highly penal\r\ncharacter, the faithful enforcement of which has hitherto been, and will, I\r\ntrust, always continue to be, regarded as a duty inseparably associated\r\nwith the maintenance of our national honor. That the people of the United\r\nStates should feel an interest in the spread of political institutions as\r\nfree as they regard their own to be is natural, nor can a sincere\r\nsolicitude for the success of all those who are at any time in good faith\r\nstruggling for their acquisition be imputed to our citizens as a crime.\r\nWith the entire freedom of opinion and an undisguised expression thereof on\r\ntheir part the Government has neither the right nor, I trust, the\r\ndisposition to interfere. But whether the interest or the honor of the\r\nUnited States requires that they should be made a party to any such\r\nstruggle, and by inevitable consequence to the war which is waged in its\r\nsupport, is a question which by our Constitution is wisely left to Congress\r\nalone to decide. It is by the laws already made criminal in our citizens to\r\nembarrass or anticipate that decision by unauthorized military operations\r\non their part. Offenses of this character, in addition to their criminality\r\nas violations of the laws of our country, have a direct tendency to draw\r\ndown upon our own citizens at large the multiplied evils of a foreign war\r\nand expose to injurious imputations the good faith and honor of the\r\ncountry. As such they deserve to be put down with promptitude and decision.\r\nI can not be mistaken, I am confident, in counting on the cordial and\r\ngeneral concurrence of our fellow-citizens in this sentiment. A copy of the\r\nproclamation which I have felt it my duty to issue is herewith\r\ncommunicated. I can not but hope that the good sense and patriotism, the\r\nregard for the honor and reputation of their country, the respect for the\r\nlaws which they have themselves enacted for their own government, and the\r\nlove of order for which the mass of our people have been so long and so\r\njustly distinguished will deter the comparatively few who are engaged in\r\nthem from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprises. In the\r\nmeantime the existing laws have been and will continue to be faithfully\r\nexecuted, and every effort will be made to carry them out in their full\r\nextent. Whether they are sufficient or not to meet the actual state of\r\nthings on the Canadian frontier it is for Congress to decide.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from the correspondence herewith submitted that the\r\nGovernment of Russia declines a renewal of the fourth article of the\r\nconvention of April, 1824, between the United States and His Imperial\r\nMajesty, by the third article of which it is agreed that \"hereafter there\r\nshall not be formed by the citizens of the United States or under the\r\nauthority of the said States any establishment upon the northwest coast of\r\nAmerica, nor in any of the islands adjacent, to the north of 54° 40' of\r\nnorth latitude, and that in the same manner there shall be none formed by\r\nRussian subjects or under the authority of Russia south of the same\r\nparallel;\" and by the fourth article, \"that during a term of ten years,\r\ncounting from the signature of the present convention, the ships of both\r\npowers, or which belong to their citizens or subjects, respectively, may\r\nreciprocally frequent, without any hindrance whatever, the interior seas,\r\ngulfs, harbors, and creeks upon the coast mentioned in the preceding\r\narticle, for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives of the\r\ncountry.\" The reasons assigned for declining to renew the provisions of\r\nthis article are, briefly, that the only use made by our citizens of the\r\nprivileges it secures to them has been to supply the Indians with\r\nspirituous liquors, ammunition, and firearms; that this traffic has been\r\nexcluded from the Russian trade; and as the supplies furnished from the\r\nUnited States are injurious to the Russian establishments on the northwest\r\ncoast and calculated to produce complaints between the two Governments, His\r\nImperial Majesty thinks it for the interest of both countries not to accede\r\nto the proposition made by the American Government for the renewal of the\r\narticle last referred to.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence herewith communicated will show the grounds upon which\r\nwe contend that the citizens of the United States have, independent of the\r\nprovisions of the convention of 1824, a right to trade with the natives\r\nupon the coast in question at unoccupied places, liable, however, it is\r\nadmitted, to be at any time extinguished by the creation of Russian\r\nestablishments at such points. This right is denied by the Russian\r\nGovernment, which asserts that by the operation of the treaty of 1824 each\r\nparty agreed to waive the general right to land on the vacant coasts on the\r\nrespective sides of the degree of latitude referred to, and accepted in\r\nlieu thereof the mutual privileges mentioned in the fourth article. The\r\ncapital and tonnage employed by our citizens in their trade with the\r\nnorthwest coast of America will, perhaps, on adverting to the official\r\nstatements of the commerce and navigation of the United States for the last\r\nfew years, be deemed too inconsiderable in amount to attract much\r\nattention; yet the subject may in other respects deserve the careful\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI regret to state that the blockade of the principal ports on the eastern\r\ncoast of Mexico, which, in consequence of differences between that Republic\r\nand France, was instituted in May last, unfortunately still continues,\r\nenforced by a competent French naval armament, and is necessarily\r\nembarrassing to our own trade in the Gulf, in common with that of other\r\nnations. Every disposition, however, is believed to exist on the part of\r\nthe French Government to render this measure as little onerous as\r\npracticable to the interests of the citizens of the United States and to\r\nthose of neutral commerce, and it is to be hoped that an early settlement\r\nof the difficulties between France and Mexico will soon reestablish the\r\nharmonious relations formerly subsisting between them and again open the\r\nports of that Republic to the vessels of all friendly nations.\r\n\r\nA convention for marking that part of the boundary between the United\r\nStates and the Republic of Texas which extends from the mouth of the Sabine\r\nto the Red River was concluded and signed at this city on the 25th of April\r\nlast. It has since been ratified by both Governments, and seasonable\r\nmeasures will be taken to carry it into effect on the part of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe application of that Republic for admission into this Union, made in\r\nAugust, 1837, and which was declined for reasons already made known to you,\r\nhas been formally withdrawn, as will appear from the accompanying copy of\r\nthe note of the minister plenipotentiary of Texas, which was presented to\r\nthe Secretary of State on the occasion of the exchange of the ratifications\r\nof the convention above mentioned.\r\n\r\nCopies of the convention with Texas, of a commercial treaty concluded with\r\nthe King of Greece, and of a similar treaty with the Peru-Bolivian\r\nConfederation, the ratifications of which have been recently exchanged,\r\naccompany this message, for the information of Congress and for such\r\nlegislative enactments as may be found necessary or expedient in relation\r\nto either of them.\r\n\r\nTo watch over and foster the interests of a gradually increasing and widely\r\nextended commerce, to guard the rights of American citizens whom business\r\nor pleasure or other motives may tempt into distant climes, and at the same\r\ntime to cultivate those sentiments of mutual respect and good will which\r\nexperience has proved so beneficial in international intercourse, the\r\nGovernment of the United States has deemed it expedient from time to time\r\nto establish diplomatic connections with different foreign states, by the\r\nappointment of representatives to reside within their respective\r\nterritories. I am gratified to be enabled to announce to you that since the\r\nclose of your last session these relations have been opened under the\r\nhappiest auspices with Austria and the Two Sicilies, that new nominations\r\nhave been made in the respective missions of Russia, Brazil, Belgium, and\r\nSweden and Norway in this country, and that a minister extraordinary has\r\nbeen received, accredited to this Government, from the Argentine\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nAn exposition of the fiscal affairs of the Government and of their\r\ncondition for the past year will be made to you by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nThe available balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next is\r\nestimated at $2,765,342. The receipts of the year from customs and lands\r\nwill probably amount to $20,615,598. These usual sources of revenue have\r\nbeen increased by an issue of Treasury notes, of which less than\r\n$8,000,000, including interest and principal, will be outstanding at the\r\nend of the year, and by the sale of one of the bonds of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States for $2,254,871. The aggregate of means from these and other\r\nsources, with the balance on hand on the 1st of January last, has been\r\napplied to the payment of appropriations by Congress. The whole expenditure\r\nfor the year on their account, including the redemption of more than eight\r\nmillions of Treasury notes, constitutes an aggregate of about $40,000,000,\r\nand will still leave in the Treasury the balance before stated.\r\n\r\nNearly $8,000,000 of Treasury notes are to be paid during the coming year\r\nin addition to the ordinary appropriations for the support of Government.\r\nFor both these purposes the resources of the Treasury will undoubtedly be\r\nsufficient if the charges upon it are not increased beyond the annual\r\nestimates. No excess, however, is likely to exist. Nor can the postponed\r\ninstallment of the surplus revenue be deposited with the States nor any\r\nconsiderable appropriations beyond the estimates be made without causing a\r\ndeficiency in the Treasury. The great caution, advisable at all times, of\r\nlimiting appropriations to the wants of the public service is rendered\r\nnecessary at present by the prospective and rapid reduction of the tariff,\r\nwhile the vigilant jealousy evidently excited among the people by the\r\noccurrences of the last few years assures us that they expect from their\r\nrepresentatives, and will sustain them in the exercise of, the most rigid\r\neconomy. Much can be effected by postponing appropriations not immediately\r\nrequired for the ordinary public service or for any pressing emergency, and\r\nmuch by reducing the expenditures where the entire and immediate\r\naccomplishment of the objects in view is not indispensable.\r\n\r\nWhen we call to mind the recent and extreme embarrassments produced by\r\nexcessive issues of bank paper, aggravated by the unforeseen withdrawal of\r\nmuch foreign capital and the inevitable derangement arising from the\r\ndistribution of the surplus revenue among the States as required by\r\nCongress, and consider the heavy expenses incurred by the removal of Indian\r\ntribes, by the military operations in Florida, and on account of the\r\nunusually large appropriations made at the last two annual sessions of\r\nCongress for other objects, we have striking evidence in the present\r\nefficient state of our finances of the abundant resources of the country to\r\nfulfill all its obligations. Nor is it less gratifying to find that the\r\ngeneral business of the community, deeply affected as it has been, is\r\nreviving with additional vigor, chastened by the lessons of the past and\r\nanimated by the hopes of the future. By the curtailment of paper issues, by\r\ncurbing the sanguine and adventurous spirit of speculation, and by the\r\nhonorable application of all available means to the fulfillment of\r\nobligations, confidence has been restored both at home and abroad, and ease\r\nand facility secured to all the operations of trade.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the Government in producing these results has been as\r\nefficient as its powers and means permitted. By withholding from the States\r\nthe deposit of the fourth installment, and leaving several millions at long\r\ncredits with the banks, principally in one section of the country, and more\r\nimmediately beneficial to it, and at the same time aiding the banks and\r\ncommercial communities in other sections by postponing the payment of bonds\r\nfor duties to the amount of between four and five millions of dollars; by\r\nan issue of Treasury notes as a means to enable the Government to meet the\r\nconsequences of their indulgences, but affording at the same time\r\nfacilities for remittance and exchange; and by steadily declining to employ\r\nas general depositories of the public revenues, or receive the notes of,\r\nall banks which refused to redeem them with specie--by these measures,\r\naided by the favorable action of some of the banks and by the support and\r\ncooperation of a large portion of the community, we have witnessed an early\r\nresumption of specie payments in our great commercial capital, promptly\r\nfollowed in almost every part of the United States. This result has been\r\nalike salutary to the true interests of agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures; to public morals, respect for the laws, and that confidence\r\nbetween man and man which is so essential in all our social relations.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the suspension of 1814 and that of 1837 is most\r\nstriking. The short duration of the latter, the prompt restoration of\r\nbusiness, the evident benefits resulting from an adherence by the\r\nGovernment to the constitutional standard of value instead of sanctioning\r\nthe suspension by the receipt of irredeemable paper, and the advantages\r\nderived from the large amount of specie introduced into the country\r\nprevious to 1837 afford a valuable illustration of the true policy of the\r\nGovernment in such a crisis. Nor can the comparison fail to remove the\r\nimpression that a national bank is necessary in such emergencies. Not only\r\nwere specie payments resumed without its aid, but exchanges have also been\r\nmore rapidly restored than when it existed, thereby showing that private\r\ncapital, enterprise, and prudence are fully adequate to these ends. On all\r\nthese points experience seems to have confirmed the views heretofore\r\nsubmitted to Congress. We have been saved the mortification of seeing the\r\ndistresses of the community for the third time seized on to fasten upon the\r\ncountry so dangerous an institution, and we may also hope that the business\r\nof individuals will hereafter be relieved from the injurious effects of a\r\ncontinued agitation of that disturbing subject. The limited influence of a\r\nnational bank in averting derangement in the exchanges of the country or in\r\ncompelling the resumption of specie payments is now not less apparent than\r\nits tendency to increase inordinate speculation by sudden expansions and\r\ncontractions; its disposition to create panic and embarrassment for the\r\npromotion of its own designs; its interference with politics, and its far\r\ngreater power for evil than for good, either in regard to the local\r\ninstitutions or the operations of Government itself. What was in these\r\nrespects but apprehension or opinion when a national bank was first\r\nestablished now stands confirmed by humiliating experience. The scenes\r\nthrough which we have passed conclusively prove how little our commerce,\r\nagriculture, manufactures, or finances require such an institution, and\r\nwhat dangers are attendant on its power--a power, I trust, never to be\r\nconferred by the American people upon their Government, and still less upon\r\nindividuals not responsible to them for its unavoidable abuses.\r\n\r\nMy conviction of the necessity of further legislative provisions for the\r\nsafe-keeping and disbursement of the public moneys and my opinion in regard\r\nto the measures best adapted to the accomplishment of those objects have\r\nbeen already submitted to you. These have been strengthened by recent\r\nevents, and in the full conviction that time and experience must still\r\nfurther demonstrate their propriety I feel it my duty, with respectful\r\ndeference to the conflicting views of others, again to invite your\r\nattention to them.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of limited sums deposited in the few banks still\r\nemployed under the act of 1836, the amounts received for duties, and, with\r\nvery inconsiderable exceptions, those accruing from lands also, have since\r\nthe general suspension of specie payments by the deposit banks been kept\r\nand disbursed by the Treasurer under his general legal powers, subject to\r\nthe superintendence of the Secretary of the Treasury. The propriety of\r\ndefining more specifically and of regulating by law the exercise of this\r\nwide scope of Executive discretion has been already submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nA change in the office of collector at one of our principal ports has\r\nbrought to light a defalcation of the gravest character, the particulars of\r\nwhich will be laid before you in a special report from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. By his report and the accompanying documents it will be seen that\r\nthe weekly returns of the defaulting officer apparently exhibited\r\nthroughout a faithful administration of the affairs intrusted to his\r\nmanagement. It, however, now appears that he commenced abstracting the\r\npublic moneys shortly after his appointment and continued to do so,\r\nprogressively increasing the amount, for the term of more than seven years,\r\nembracing a portion of the period during which the public moneys were\r\ndeposited in the Bank of the United States, the whole of that of the State\r\nbank deposit system, and concluding only on his retirement from office,\r\nafter that system had substantially failed in consequence of the suspension\r\nof specie payments.\r\n\r\nThe way in which this defalcation was so long concealed and the steps taken\r\nto indemnify the United States, as far as practicable, against loss will\r\nalso be presented to you. The case is one which imperatively claims the\r\nattention of Congress and furnishes the strongest motive for the\r\nestablishment of a more severe and secure system for the safe-keeping and\r\ndisbursement of the public moneys than any that has heretofore existed.\r\n\r\nIt seems proper, at all events, that by an early enactment similar to that\r\nof other countries the application of public money by an officer of\r\nGovernment to private uses should be made a felony and visited with severe\r\nand ignominious punishment. This is already in effect the law in respect to\r\nthe Mint, and has been productive of the most salutary results. Whatever\r\nsystem is adopted, such an enactment would be wise as an independent\r\nmeasure, since much of the public moneys must in their collection and\r\nultimate disbursement pass twice through the hands of public officers, in\r\nwhatever manner they are intermediately kept. The Government, it must be\r\nadmitted, has been from its commencement comparatively fortunate in this\r\nrespect. But the appointing power can not always be well advised in its\r\nselections, and the experience of every country has shown that public\r\nofficers are not at all times proof against temptation. It is a duty,\r\ntherefore, which the Government owes, as well to the interests committed to\r\nits care as to the officers themselves, to provide every guard against\r\ntransgressions of this character that is consistent with reason and\r\nhumanity. Congress can not be too jealous of the conduct of those who are\r\nintrusted with the public money, and I shall at all times be disposed to\r\nencourage a watchful discharge of this duty.\r\n\r\nIf a more direct cooperation on the part of Congress in the supervision of\r\nthe conduct of the officers intrusted with the custody and application of\r\nthe public money is deemed desirable, it will give me pleasure to assist in\r\nthe establishment of any judicious and constitutional plan by which that\r\nobject may be accomplished. You will in your wisdom determine upon the\r\npropriety of adopting such a plan and upon the measures necessary to its\r\neffectual execution. When the late Bank of the United States was\r\nincorporated and made the depository of the public moneys, a right was\r\nreserved to Congress to inspect at its pleasure, by a committee of that\r\nbody, the books and the proceedings of the bank. In one of the States,\r\nwhose banking institutions are supposed to rank amongst the first in point\r\nof stability, they are subjected to constant examination by commissioners\r\nappointed for that purpose, and much of the success of its banking system\r\nis attributed to this watchful supervision.\r\n\r\nThe same course has also, in view of its beneficial operation, been adopted\r\nby an adjoining State, favorably known for the care it has always bestowed\r\nupon whatever relates to its financial concerns. I submit to your\r\nconsideration whether a committee of Congress might not be profitably\r\nemployed in inspecting, at such intervals as might be deemed proper, the\r\naffairs and accounts of officers intrusted with the custody of the public\r\nmoneys. The frequent performance of this duty might be made obligatory on\r\nthe committee in respect to those officers who have large sums in their\r\npossession, and left discretionary in respect to others. They might report\r\nto the Executive such defalcations as were found to exist, with a view to a\r\nprompt removal from office unless the default was satisfactorily accounted\r\nfor, and report also to Congress, at the commencement of each session, the\r\nresult of their examinations and proceedings. It does appear to me that\r\nwith a subjection of this class of public officers to the general\r\nsupervision of the Executive, to examinations by a committee of Congress at\r\nperiods of which they should have no previous notice, and to prosecution\r\nand punishment as for felony for every breach of trust, the safe-keeping of\r\nthe public moneys might under the system proposed be placed on a surer\r\nfoundation than it has ever occupied since the establishment of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you additional information\r\ncontaining new details on this interesting subject. To these I ask your\r\nearly attention. That it should have given rise to great diversity of\r\nopinion can not be a subject of surprise. After the collection and custody\r\nof the public moneys had been for so many years connected with and made\r\nsubsidiary to the advancement of private interests, a return to the simple\r\nself-denying ordinances of the Constitution could not but be difficult. But\r\ntime and free discussion, eliciting the sentiments of the people, and aided\r\nby that conciliatory spirit which has ever characterized their course on\r\ngreat emergencies, were relied upon for a satisfactory settlement of the\r\nquestion. Already has this anticipation, on one important point at\r\nleast--the impropriety of diverting public money to private purposes--been\r\nfully realized. There is no reason to suppose that legislation upon that\r\nbranch of the subject would now be embarrassed by a difference of opinion,\r\nor fail to receive the cordial support of a large majority of our\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nThe connection which formerly existed between the Government and banks was\r\nin reality injurious to both, as well as to the general interests of the\r\ncommunity at large. It aggravated the disasters of trade and the\r\nderangements of commercial intercourse, and administered new excitements\r\nand additional means to wild and reckless speculations, the disappointment\r\nof which threw the country into convulsions of panic, and all but produced\r\nviolence and bloodshed. The imprudent expansion of bank credits, which was\r\nthe natural result of the command of the revenues of the State, furnished\r\nthe resources for unbounded license in every species of adventure, seduced\r\nindustry from its regular and salutary occupations by the hope of abundance\r\nwithout labor, and deranged the social state by tempting all trades and\r\nprofessions into the vortex of speculation on remote contingencies.\r\n\r\nThe same wide-spreading influence impeded also the resources of the\r\nGovernment, curtailed its useful operations, embarrassed the fulfillment of\r\nits obligations, and seriously interfered with the execution of the laws.\r\nLarge appropriations and oppressive taxes are the natural consequences of\r\nsuch a connection, since they increase the profits of those who are allowed\r\nto use the public funds, and make it their interest that money should be\r\naccumulated and expenditures multiplied. It is thus that a concentrated\r\nmoney power is tempted to become an active agent in political affairs; and\r\nall past experience has shown on which side that influence will be arrayed.\r\nWe deceive ourselves if we suppose that, it will ever be found asserting\r\nand supporting the rights of the community at large in opposition to the\r\nclaims of the few.\r\n\r\nIn a government whose distinguishing characteristic should be a diffusion\r\nand equalization of its benefits and burdens the advantage of individuals\r\nwill be augmented at the expense of the community at large. Nor is it the\r\nnature of combinations for the acquisition of legislative influence to\r\nconfine their interference to the single object for which they were\r\noriginally formed. The temptation to extend it to other matters is, on the\r\ncontrary, not unfrequently too strong to be resisted. The rightful\r\ninfluence in the direction of public affairs of the mass of the people is\r\ntherefore in no slight danger of being sensibly and injuriously affected by\r\ngiving to a comparatively small but very efficient class a direct and\r\nexclusive personal interest in so important a portion of the legislation of\r\nCongress as that which relates to the custody of the public moneys. If laws\r\nacting upon private interests can not always be avoided, they should be\r\nconfined within the narrowest limits, and left wherever possible to the\r\nlegislatures of the States. When not thus restricted they lead to\r\ncombinations of powerful associations, foster an influence necessarily\r\nselfish, and turn the fair course of legislation to sinister ends rather\r\nthan to objects that advance public liberty and promote the general good.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject now rests with you, and I can not but express a hope that\r\nsome definite measure will be adopted at the present session.\r\n\r\nIt will not, I am sure, be deemed out of place for me here to remark that\r\nthe declaration of my views in opposition to the policy of employing banks\r\nas depositories of the Government funds can not justly be construed as\r\nindicative of hostility, official or personal, to those institutions; or to\r\nrepeat in this form and in connection with this subject opinions which I\r\nhave uniformly entertained and on all proper occasions expressed. Though\r\nalways opposed to their creation in the form of exclusive privileges, and,\r\nas a State magistrate, aiming by appropriate legislation to secure the\r\ncommunity against the consequences of their occasional mismanagement, I\r\nhave yet ever wished to see them protected in the exercise of rights\r\nconferred by law, and have never doubted their utility when properly\r\nmanaged in promoting the interests of trade, and through that channel the\r\nother interests of the community. To the General Government they present\r\nthemselves merely as State institutions, having no necessary connection\r\nwith its legislation or its administration. Like other State\r\nestablishments, they may be used or not in conducting the affairs of the\r\nGovernment, as public policy and the general interests of the Union may\r\nseem to require. The only safe or proper principle upon which their\r\nintercourse with the Government can be regulated is that which regulates\r\ntheir intercourse with the private citizen--the conferring of mutual\r\nbenefits. When the Government can accomplish a financial operation better\r\nwith the aid of the banks than without it, it should be at liberty to seek\r\nthat aid as it would the services of a private banker or other capitalist\r\nor agent, giving the preference to those who will serve it on the best\r\nterms. Nor can there ever exist an interest in the officers of the General\r\nGovernment, as such, inducing them to embarrass or annoy the State banks\r\nany more than to incur the hostility of any other class of State\r\ninstitutions or of private citizens. It is not in the nature of things that\r\nhostility to these institutions can spring from this source, or any\r\nopposition to their course of business, except when they themselves depart\r\nfrom the objects of their creation and attempt to usurp powers not\r\nconferred upon them or to subvert the standard of value established by the\r\nConstitution. While opposition to their regular operations can not exist in\r\nthis quarter, resistance to any attempt to make the Government dependent\r\nupon them for the successful administration of public affairs is a matter\r\nof duty, as I trust it ever will be of inclination, no matter from what\r\nmotive or consideration the attempt may originate.\r\n\r\nIt is no more than just to the banks to say that in the late emergency most\r\nof them firmly resisted the strongest temptations to extend their paper\r\nissues when apparently sustained in a suspension of specie payments by\r\npublic opinion, even though in some cases invited by legislative\r\nenactments. To this honorable course, aided by the resistance of the\r\nGeneral Government, acting in obedience to the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States, to the introduction of an irredeemable paper medium, may be\r\nattributed in a great degree the speedy restoration of our currency to a\r\nsound state and the business of the country to its wonted prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe banks have but to continue in the same safe course and be content in\r\ntheir appropriate sphere to avoid all interference from the General\r\nGovernment and to derive from it all the protection and benefits which it\r\nbestows on other State establishments, on the people of the States, and on\r\nthe States themselves. In this, their true position, they can not but\r\nsecure the confidence and good will of the people and the Government, which\r\nthey can only lose when, leaping from their legitimate sphere, they attempt\r\nto control the legislation of the country and pervert the operations of the\r\nGovernment to their own purposes.\r\n\r\nOur experience under the act, passed at the last session, to grant\r\npreemption rights to settlers on the public lands has as yet been too\r\nlimited to enable us to pronounce with safety upon the efficacy of its\r\nprovisions to carry out the wise and liberal policy of the Government in\r\nthat respect. There is, however, the best reason to anticipate favorable\r\nresults from its operation. The recommendations formerly submitted to you\r\nin respect to a graduation of the price of the public lands remain to be\r\nfinally acted upon. Having found no reason to change the views then\r\nexpressed, your attention to them is again respectfully requested.\r\n\r\nEvery proper exertion has been made and will be continued to carry out the\r\nwishes of Congress in relation to the tobacco trade, as indicated in the\r\nseveral resolutions of the House of Representatives and the legislation of\r\nthe two branches. A favorable impression has, I trust, been made in the\r\ndifferent foreign countries to which particular attention has been\r\ndirected; and although we can not hope for an early change in their policy,\r\nas in many of them a convenient and large revenue is derived from\r\nmonopolies in the fabrication and sale of this article, yet, as these\r\nmonopolies are really injurious to the people where they are established,\r\nand the revenue derived from them may be less injuriously and with equal\r\nfacility obtained from another and a liberal system of administration, we\r\ncan not doubt that our efforts will be eventually crowned with, success if\r\npersisted in with temperate firmness and sustained by prudent legislation.\r\n\r\nIn recommending to Congress the adoption of the necessary provisions at\r\nthis session for taking the next census or enumeration of the inhabitants\r\nof the United States, the suggestion presents itself whether the scope of\r\nthe measure might not be usefully extended by causing it to embrace\r\nauthentic statistical returns of the great interests specially intrusted to\r\nor necessarily affected by the legislation of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War presents a satisfactory\r\naccount of the state of the Army and of the several branches of the public\r\nservice confided to the superintendence of that officer.\r\n\r\nThe law increasing and organizing the military establishment of the United\r\nStates has been nearly carried into effect, and the Army has been\r\nextensively and usefully employed during the past season.\r\n\r\nI would again call to your notice the subjects connected with and essential\r\nto the military defenses of the country which were submitted to you at the\r\nlast session, but which were not acted upon, as is supposed, for want of\r\ntime. The most important of them is the organization of the militia on the\r\nmaritime and inland frontiers. This measure is deemed important, as it is\r\nbelieved that it will furnish an effective volunteer force in aid of the\r\nRegular Army, and may form the basis of a general system of organization\r\nfor the entire militia of the United States. The erection of a national\r\nfoundry and gunpowder manufactory, and one for making small arms, the\r\nlatter to be situated at some point west of the Allegany Mountains, all\r\nappear to be of sufficient importance to be again urged upon your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by the Secretary of War for the distribution of the\r\nforces of the United States in time of peace is well calculated to promote\r\nregularity and economy in the fiscal administration of the service, to\r\npreserve the discipline of the troops, and to render them available for the\r\nmaintenance of the peace and tranquillity of the Country. With this view,\r\nlikewise, I recommend the adoption of the plan presented by that officer\r\nfor the defense of the western frontier. The preservation of the lives and\r\nproperty of our fellow-citizens who are settled upon that border country,\r\nas well as the existence of the Indian population, which might be tempted\r\nby our want of preparation to rush on their own destruction and attack the\r\nwhite settlements, all seem to require that this subject should be acted\r\nupon without delay, and the War Department authorized to place that country\r\nin a state of complete defense against any assault from the numerous and\r\nwarlike tribes which are congregated on that border.\r\n\r\nIt affords me sincere pleasure to be able to apprise you of the entire\r\nremoval of the Cherokee Nation of Indians to their new homes west of the\r\nMississippi. The measures authorized by Congress at its last session, with\r\na view to the long-standing controversy with them, have had the happiest\r\neffects. By an agreement concluded with them by the commanding general in\r\nthat country, who has performed the duties assigned to him on the occasion\r\nwith commendable energy and humanity, their removal has been principally\r\nunder the conduct of their own chiefs, and they have emigrated without any\r\napparent reluctance.\r\n\r\nThe successful accomplishment of this important object, the removal also of\r\nthe entire Creek Nation with the exception of a small number of fugitives\r\namongst the Seminoles in Florida, the progress already made toward a speedy\r\ncompletion of the removal of the Chickasaws, the Choctaws, the\r\nPottawatamies, the Ottawas, and the Chippewas, with the extensive purchases\r\nof Indian lands during the present year, have rendered the speedy and\r\nsuccessful result of the long-established policy of the Government upon the\r\nsubject of Indian affairs entirely certain. The occasion is therefore\r\ndeemed a proper one to place this policy in such a point of view as will\r\nexonerate the Government of the United States from the undeserved reproach\r\nwhich has been cast upon it through several successive Administrations.\r\nThat a mixed occupancy of the same territory by the white and red man is\r\nincompatible with the safety or happiness of either is a position in\r\nrespect to which there has long since ceased to be room for a difference of\r\nopinion. Reason and experience have alike demonstrated its\r\nimpracticability. The bitter fruits of every attempt heretofore to overcome\r\nthe barriers interposed by nature have only been destruction, both physical\r\nand moral, to the Indian, dangerous conflicts of authority between the\r\nFederal and State Governments, and detriment to the individual prosperity\r\nof the citizen as well as to the general improvement of the country. The\r\nremedial policy, the principles of which were settled more than thirty\r\nyears ago under the Administration of Mr. Jefferson, consists in an\r\nextinction, for a fair consideration, of the title to all the lands still\r\noccupied by the Indians within the States and Territories of the United\r\nStates; their removal to a country west of the Mississippi much more\r\nextensive and better adapted to their condition than that on which they\r\nthen resided; the guarantee to them by the United States of their exclusive\r\npossession of that country forever, exempt from all intrusions by white\r\nmen, with ample provisions for their security against external violence and\r\ninternal dissensions, and the extension to them of suitable facilities for\r\ntheir advancement in civilization. This has not been the policy of\r\nparticular Administrations only, but of each in succession since the first\r\nattempt to carry it out under that of Mr. Monroe. All have labored for its\r\naccomplishment, only with different degrees of success. The manner of its\r\nexecution has, it is true, from time to time given rise to conflicts of\r\nopinion and unjust imputations; but in respect to the wisdom and necessity\r\nof the policy itself there has not from the beginning existed a doubt in\r\nthe mind of any calm, judicious, disinterested friend of the Indian race\r\naccustomed to reflection and enlightened by experience.\r\n\r\nOccupying the double character of contractor on its own account and\r\nguardian for the parties contracted with, it was hardly to be expected that\r\nthe dealings of the Federal Government with the Indian tribes would escape\r\nmisrepresentation. That there occurred ill the early settlement of this\r\ncountry, as in all others where the civilized race has succeeded to the\r\npossessions of the savage, instances of oppression and fraud on the part of\r\nthe former there is too much reason to believe. No such offenses can,\r\nhowever, be justly charged upon this Government since it became free to\r\npursue its own course. Its dealings with the Indian tribes have been just\r\nand friendly throughout; its efforts for their civilization constant, and\r\ndirected by the best feelings of humanity; its watchfulness in protecting\r\nthem from individual frauds unremitting; its forbearance under the keenest\r\nprovocations, the deepest injuries, and the most flagrant outrages may\r\nchallenge at least a comparison with any nation, ancient or modern, in\r\nsimilar circumstances; and if in future times a powerful, civilized, and\r\nhappy nation of Indians shall be found to exist within the limits of this\r\nnorthern continent it will be owing to the consummation of that policy\r\nwhich has been so unjustly assailed. Only a very brief reference to facts\r\nin confirmation of this assertion can in this form be given, and you are\r\ntherefore necessarily referred to the report of the Secretary of War for\r\nfurther details. To the Cherokees, whose case has perhaps excited the\r\ngreatest share of attention and sympathy, the United States have granted in\r\nfee, with a perpetual guaranty of exclusive and peaceable possession,\r\n13,554,135 acres of land on the west side of the Mississippi, eligibly\r\nsituated, in a healthy climate, and in all respects better suited to their\r\ncondition than the country they have left, in exchange for only 9,492, 160\r\nacres on the east side of the same river. The United States have in\r\naddition stipulated to pay them $5,600,000 for their interest in and\r\nimprovements on the lands thus relinquished, and $1,160,000 for subsistence\r\nand other beneficial purposes, thereby putting it in their power to become\r\none of the most wealthy and independent separate communities of the same\r\nextent in the world.\r\n\r\nBy the treaties made and ratified with the Miamies, the Chippewas, the\r\nSioux, the Sacs and Foxes, and the Winnebagoes during the last year the\r\nIndian title to 18,458,000 acres has been extinguished. These purchases\r\nhave been much more extensive than those of any previous year, and have,\r\nwith other Indian expenses, borne very heavily upon the Treasury. They\r\nleave, however, but a small quantity of unbought Indian lands within the\r\nStates and Territories, and the Legislature and Executive were equally\r\nsensible of the propriety of a final and more speedy extinction of Indian\r\ntitles within those limits. The treaties, which were with a single\r\nexception made in pursuance of previous appropriations for defraying the\r\nexpenses, have subsequently been ratified by the Senate, and received the\r\nsanction of Congress by the appropriations necessary to carry them into\r\neffect. Of the terms upon which these important negotiations were concluded\r\nI can speak from direct knowledge, and I feel no difficulty in affirming\r\nthat the interest of the Indians in the extensive territory embraced by\r\nthem is to be paid for at its fair value, and that no more favorable terms\r\nhave been granted to the United States than would have been reasonably\r\nexpected in a negotiation with civilized men fully capable of appreciating\r\nand protecting their own rights. For the Indian title to 116,349,897 acres\r\nacquired since the 4th of March, 1829, the United States have paid\r\n$72,560,056 in permanent annuities, lands, reservations for Indians,\r\nexpenses of removal and subsistence, merchandise, mechanical and\r\nagricultural establishments and implements. When the heavy expenses\r\nincurred by the United States and the circumstance that so large a portion\r\nof the entire territory will be forever unsalable are considered, and this\r\nprice is compared with that for which the United States sell their own\r\nlands, no one can doubt that justice has been done to the Indians in these\r\npurchases also. Certain it is that the transactions of the Federal\r\nGovernment with the Indians have been uniformly characterized by a sincere\r\nand paramount desire to promote their welfare; and it must be a source of\r\nthe highest gratification to every friend to justice and humanity to learn\r\nthat not withstanding the obstructions from time to time thrown in its way\r\nand the difficulties which have arisen from the peculiar and impracticable\r\nnature of the Indian character, the wise, humane, and undeviating policy of\r\nthe Government in this the most difficult of all our relations, foreign or\r\ndomestic, has at length been justified to the world in its near approach to\r\na happy and certain consummation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the tribes which occupy the country set apart for them in\r\nthe West is highly prosperous, and encourages the hope of their early\r\ncivilization. They have for the most part abandoned the hunter state and\r\nturned their attention to agricultural pursuits. All those who have been\r\nestablished for any length of time in that fertile region maintain\r\nthemselves by their own industry. There are among them traders of no\r\ninconsiderable capital, and planters exporting cotton to some extent, but\r\nthe greater number are small agriculturists, living in comfort upon the\r\nproduce of their farms. The recent emigrants, although they have in some\r\ninstances removed reluctantly, have readily acquiesced in their unavoidable\r\ndestiny. They have found at once a recompense for past sufferings and an\r\nincentive to industrious habits in the abundance and comforts around them.\r\nThere is reason to believe that all these tribes are friendly in their\r\nfeelings toward the United States; and it is to be hoped that the\r\nacquisition of individual wealth, the pursuits of agriculture, and habits\r\nof industry will gradually subdue their warlike propensities and incline\r\nthem to maintain peace among themselves. To effect this desirable object\r\nthe attention of Congress is solicited to the measures recommended by the\r\nSecretary of War for their future government and protection, as well from\r\neach other as from the hostility of the warlike tribes around them and the\r\nintrusions of the whites. The policy of the Government has given them a\r\npermanent home and guaranteed to them its peaceful and undisturbed\r\npossession. It only remains to give them a government and laws which will\r\nencourage industry and secure to them the rewards of their exertions. The\r\nimportance of some form of government can not be too much insisted upon.\r\nThe earliest effects will be to diminish the causes and occasions for\r\nhostilities among the tribes, to inspire an interest in the observance of\r\nlaws to which they will have themselves assented, and to multiply the\r\nsecurities of property and the motives for self-improvement. Intimately\r\nconnected with this subject is the establishment of the military defenses\r\nrecommended by the Secretary of War, which have been already referred to.\r\nWithout them the Government will be powerless to redeem its pledge of\r\nprotection to the emigrating Indians against the numerous warlike tribes\r\nthat surround them and to provide for the safety of the frontier settlers\r\nof the bordering States.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Seminoles constitutes at present the only exception to the\r\nsuccessful efforts of the Government to remove the Indians to the homes\r\nassigned them west of the Mississippi. Four hundred of this tribe emigrated\r\nin 1836 and 1,500 in 1837 and 1838, leaving in the country, it is supposed,\r\nabout 2,000 Indians. The continued treacherous conduct of these people; the\r\nsavage and unprovoked murders they have lately committed, butchering whole\r\nfamilies of the settlers of the Territory without distinction of age or\r\nsex, and making their way into the very center and heart of the country, so\r\nthat no part of it is free from their ravages; their frequent attacks on\r\nthe light-houses along that dangerous coast, and the barbarity with which\r\nthey have murdered the passengers and crews of such vessels as have been\r\nwrecked upon the reefs and keys which border the Gulf, leave the Government\r\nno alternative but to continue the military operations against them until\r\nthey are totally expelled from Florida. There are other motives which would\r\nurge the Government to pursue this course toward the Seminoles. The United\r\nStates have fulfilled in good faith all their treaty stipulations with the\r\nIndian tribes, and have in every other instance insisted upon a like\r\nperformance of their obligations. To relax from this salutary rule because\r\nthe Seminoles have maintained themselves so long in the territory they had\r\nrelinquished, and in defiance of their frequent and solemn engagements\r\nstill continue to wage a ruthless war against the United States, would not\r\nonly evince a want of constancy on our part, but be of evil example in our\r\nintercourse with other tribes. Experience has shown that but little is to\r\nbe gained by the march of armies through a country so intersected with\r\ninaccessible swamps and marshes, and which, from the fatal character of the\r\nclimate, must be abandoned at the end of the winter. I recommend,\r\ntherefore, to your attention the plan submitted by the Secretary of War in\r\nthe accompanying report, for the permanent occupation of the portion of the\r\nTerritory freed from the Indians and the more efficient protection of the\r\npeople of Florida from their inhuman warfare.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith transmitted it will\r\nappear that a large portion of the disposable naval force is either\r\nactively employed or in a state of preparation for the purposes of\r\nexperience and discipline and the protection of our commerce. So effectual\r\nhas been this protection that so far as the information of Government\r\nextends not a single outrage has been attempted on a vessel carrying the\r\nflag of the United States within the present year, in any quarter, however\r\ndistant or exposed.\r\n\r\nThe exploring expedition sailed from Norfolk on the 19th of August last,\r\nand information has been received of its safe arrival at the island of\r\nMadeira. The best spirit animates the officers and crews, and there is\r\nevery reason to anticipate from its efforts results beneficial to commerce\r\nand honorable to the nation.\r\n\r\nIt will also be seen that no reduction of the force now in commission is\r\ncontemplated. The unsettled state of a portion of South America renders it\r\nindispensable that our commerce should receive protection in that quarter;\r\nthe vast and increasing interests embarked in the trade of the Indian and\r\nChina seas, in the whale fisheries of the Pacific Ocean, and in the Gulf of\r\nMexico require equal attention to their safety, and a small squadron may be\r\nemployed to great advantage on our Atlantic coast in meeting sudden demands\r\nfor the reenforcement of other stations, in aiding merchant vessels in\r\ndistress, in affording active service to an additional number of officers,\r\nand in visiting the different ports of the United States, an accurate\r\nknowledge of which is obviously of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is respectfully called to that portion of the\r\nreport recommending an increase in the number of smaller vessels, and to\r\nother suggestions contained in that document. The rapid increase and wide\r\nexpansion of our commerce, which is every day seeking new avenues of\r\nprofitable adventure; the absolute necessity of a naval force for its\r\nprotection precisely in the degree of its extension; a due regard to the\r\nnational rights and honor; the recollection of its former exploits, and the\r\nanticipation of its future triumphs whenever opportunity presents itself,\r\nwhich we may rightfully indulge from the experience of the past--all seem\r\nto point to the Navy as a most efficient arm of our national defense and a\r\nproper object of legislative encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe progress and condition of the Post-Office Department will be seen by\r\nreference to the report of the Postmaster-General. The extent of post-roads\r\ncovered by mail contracts is stated to be 134,818 miles, and the annual\r\ntransportation upon them 34,580,202 miles. The number of post-offices in\r\nthe United States is 12,553, and rapidly increasing. The gross revenue for\r\nthe year ending on the 30th day of June last was $4,262,145; the accruing\r\nexpenditures, $4,680,068; excess of expenditures, $417,923. This has been\r\nmade up out of the surplus previously on hand. The cash on hand on the 1st\r\ninstant was $314,068. The revenue for the year ending June 30, 1838, was\r\n$161,540 more than that for the year ending June 30, 1837. The expenditures\r\nof the Department had been graduated upon the anticipation of a largely\r\nincreased revenue. A moderate curtailment of mail service consequently\r\nbecame necessary, and has been effected, to shield the Department against\r\nthe danger of embarrassment. Its revenue is now improving, and it will soon\r\nresume its onward course in the march of improvement.\r\n\r\nYour particular attention is requested to so much of the\r\nPostmaster-Generals report as relates to the transportation of the mails\r\nupon railroads. The laws on that subject do not seem adequate to secure\r\nthat service, now become almost essential to the public interests, and at\r\nthe same time protect the Department from combinations and unreasonable\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nNor can I too earnestly request your attention to the necessity of\r\nproviding a more secure building for this Department. The danger of\r\ndestruction to which its important books and papers are continually\r\nexposed, as well from the highly combustible character of the building\r\noccupied as from that of others in the vicinity, calls loudly for prompt\r\naction.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again earnestly invited to the suggestions and\r\nrecommendations submitted at the last session in respect to the District of\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty also to bring to your notice certain proceedings at law\r\nwhich have recently been prosecuted in this District in the name of the\r\nUnited States, on the relation of Messrs. Stockton & Stokes, of the State\r\nof Maryland, against the Postmaster-General, and which have resulted in the\r\npayment of money out of the National Treasury, for the first time since the\r\nestablishment of the Government, by judicial compulsion exercised by the\r\ncommon-law writ of mandamus issued by the circuit court of this District.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the case and the grounds of the proceedings will be found\r\nfully stated in the report of the decision, and any additional information\r\nwhich you may desire will be supplied by the proper Department. No\r\ninterference in the particular case is contemplated. The money has been\r\npaid, the claims of the prosecutors have been satisfied, and the whole\r\nsubject, so far as they are concerned, is finally disposed of; but it is on\r\nthe supposition that the case may be regarded as an authoritative\r\nexposition of the law as it now stands that I have thought it necessary to\r\npresent it to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe object of the application to the circuit court was to compel the\r\nPostmaster-General to carry into effect an award made by the Solicitor of\r\nthe Treasury, under a special act of Congress for the settlement of certain\r\nclaims of the relators on the Post-Office Department, which award the\r\nPostmaster-General declined to execute in full until he should receive\r\nfurther legislative direction on the subject. If the duty imposed on the\r\nPostmaster-General by that law was to be regarded as one of an official\r\nnature, belonging to his office as a branch of the executive, then it is\r\nobvious that the constitutional competency of the judiciary to direct and\r\ncontrol him in its discharge was necessarily drawn in question; and if the\r\nduty so imposed on the Postmaster-General was to be considered as merely\r\nministerial, and not executive, it yet remained to be shown that the\r\ncircuit court of this District had authority to interfere by mandamus, such\r\na power having never before been asserted or claimed by that court. With a\r\nview to the settlement of these important questions, the judgment of the\r\ncircuit court was carried by a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. In the opinion of that tribunal the duty imposed on the\r\nPostmaster-General was not an official executive duty, but one of a merely\r\nministerial nature. The grave constitutional questions which had been\r\ndiscussed were therefore excluded from the decision of the case, the court,\r\nindeed, expressly admitting that with powers and duties properly belonging\r\nto the executive no other department can interfere by the writ of\r\nmandamus; and the question therefore resolved itself into this: Has\r\nCongress conferred upon the circuit court of this District the power to\r\nissue such a writ to an officer of the General Government commanding him to\r\nperform a ministerial act? A majority of the court have decided that it\r\nhas, but have rounded their decision upon a process of reasoning which in\r\nmy judgment renders further legislative provision indispensable to the\r\npublic interests and the equal administration of justice.\r\n\r\nIt has long since been decided by the Supreme Court that neither that\r\ntribunal nor the circuit courts of the United States, held within the\r\nrespective States, possess the power in question; but it is now held that\r\nthis power, denied to both of these high tribunals (to the former by the\r\nConstitution and to the latter by Congress), has been by its legislation\r\nvested in the circuit court of this District. No such direct grant of power\r\nto the circuit court of this District is claimed, but it has been held to\r\nresult by necessary implication from several sections of the law\r\nestablishing the court. One of these sections declares that the laws of\r\nMaryland, as they existed at the time of the cession, should be in force in\r\nthat part of the District ceded by that State, and by this provision the\r\ncommon law in civil and criminal cases, as it prevailed in Maryland in\r\n1801, was established in that part of the District.\r\n\r\nIn England the court of king's bench--because the Sovereign, who, according\r\nto the theory of the constitution, is the fountain of justice originally\r\nsat there in person, and is still deemed to be present in construction of\r\nlaw--alone possesses the high power of issuing the writ of mandamus, not\r\nonly to inferior jurisdictions and corporations, but also to magistrates\r\nand others, commanding them in the King's name to do what their duty\r\nrequires in cases where there is a vested right and no other specific\r\nremedy. It has been held in the case referred to that as the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States is by the Constitution rendered incompetent to\r\nexercise this power, and as the circuit court of this District is a court\r\nof general jurisdiction in cases at common law, and the highest court of\r\noriginal jurisdiction in the District, the right to issue the writ of\r\nmandamus is incident to its common-law powers. Another ground relied upon\r\nto maintain the power in question is that it was included by fair\r\nconstruction in the powers granted to the circuit courts of the United\r\nStates by the act \"to provide for the more convenient organization of the\r\ncourts of the United States,\" passed 13th February, 1801; that the act\r\nestablishing the circuit court of this District, passed the 27th day of\r\nFebruary, 1801, conferred upon that court and the judges thereof the same\r\npowers as were by law vested in the circuit courts of the United States and\r\nin the judges of the said courts; that the repeal of the first-mentioned\r\nact, which took place in the next year, did not divest the circuit court of\r\nthis District of the authority in dispute, but left it still clothed with\r\nthe powers over the subject which, it is conceded, were taken away from the\r\ncircuit courts of the United States by the repeal of the act of 13th\r\nFebruary, 1801.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the adoption of the laws of Maryland for a portion of this\r\nDistrict confers on the circuit court thereof, in that portion, the\r\ntranscendent extrajudicial prerogative powers of the court of king's bench\r\nin England, or that either of the acts of Congress by necessary implication\r\nauthorizes the former court to issue a writ of mandamus to an officer of\r\nthe United States to compel him to perform a ministerial duty, the\r\nconsequences are in one respect the same. The result in either case is that\r\nthe officers of the United States stationed in different parts of the\r\nUnited States are, in respect to the performance of their official duties,\r\nsubject to different laws and a different supervision--those in the States\r\nto one rule, and those in the District of Columbia to another and a very\r\ndifferent one. In the District their official conduct is subject to a\r\njudicial control from which in the States they are exempt.\r\n\r\nWhatever difference of opinion may exist as to the expediency of vesting\r\nsuch a power in the judiciary in a system of government constituted like\r\nthat of the United States, all must agree that these disparaging\r\ndiscrepancies in the law and in the administration of justice ought not to\r\nhe permitted to continue; and as Congress alone can provide the remedy, the\r\nsubject is unavoidably presented to your consideration.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nMartin van Buren\r\nDecember 2, 1839\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI regret that I can not on this occasion congratulate you that the past\r\nyear has been one of unalloyed prosperity. The ravages of fire and disease\r\nhave painfully afflicted otherwise flourishing portions of our country, and\r\nserious embarrassments yet derange the trade of many of our cities. But\r\nnotwithstanding these adverse circumstances, that general prosperity which\r\nhas been heretofore so bountifully bestowed upon us by the Author of All\r\nGood still continues to call for our warmest gratitude. Especially have we\r\nreason to rejoice in the exuberant harvests which have lavishly recompensed\r\nwell-directed industry and given to it that sure reward which is vainly\r\nsought in visionary speculations. I cannot, indeed, view without peculiar\r\nsatisfaction the evidences afforded by the past season of the benefits that\r\nspring from the steady devotion of the husbandman to his honorable pursuit.\r\nNo means of individual comfort is more certain and no source of national\r\nprosperity is so sure. Nothing can compensate a people for a dependence\r\nupon others for the bread they eat, and that cheerful abundance on which\r\nthe happiness of everyone so much depends is to be looked for nowhere with\r\nsuch sure reliance as in the industry of the agriculturist and the bounties\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nWith foreign countries our relations exhibit the same favorable aspect\r\nwhich was presented in my last annual message, and afford continued proof\r\nof the wisdom of the pacific, just, and forbearing policy adopted by the\r\nfirst Administration of the Federal Government and pursued by its\r\nsuccessors. The extraordinary powers vested in me by an act of Congress for\r\nthe defense of the country in an emergency, considered so far probable as\r\nto require that the Executive should possess ample means to meet it, have\r\nnot been exerted. They have therefore been attended with no other result\r\nthan to increase, by the confidence thus reposed in me, my obligations to\r\nmaintain with religious exactness the cardinal principles that govern our\r\nintercourse with other nations. Happily, in our pending questions with\r\nGreat Britain, out of which this unusual grant of authority arose, nothing\r\nhas occurred to require its exertion, and as it is about to return to the\r\nLegislature I trust that no future necessity may call for its exercise by\r\nthem or its delegation to another Department of the Government.\r\n\r\nFor the settlement of our northeastern boundary the proposition promised by\r\nGreat Britain for a commission of exploration and survey has been received,\r\nand a counter project, including also a provision for the certain and final\r\nadjustment of the limits in dispute, is now before the British Government\r\nfor its consideration. A just regard to the delicate state of this question\r\nand a proper respect for the natural impatience of the State of Maine, not\r\nless than a conviction that the negotiation has been already protracted\r\nlonger than is prudent on the part of either Government, have led me to\r\nbelieve that the present favorable moment should on no account be suffered\r\nto pass without putting the question forever at rest. I feel confident that\r\nthe Government of Her Britannic Majesty will take the same view of this\r\nsubject, as I am persuaded it is governed by desires equally strong and\r\nsincere for the amicable termination of the controversy.\r\n\r\nTo the intrinsic difficulties of questions of boundary lines, especially\r\nthose described in regions unoccupied and but partially known, is to be\r\nadded in our country the embarrassment necessarily arising out of our\r\nConstitution by which the General Government is made the organ of\r\nnegotiating and deciding upon the particular interests of the States on\r\nwhose frontiers these lines are to be traced. To avoid another controversy\r\nin which a State government might rightfully claim to have her wishes\r\nconsulted previously to the conclusion of conventional arrangements\r\nconcerning her rights of jurisdiction or territory, I have thought it\r\nnecessary to call the attention of the Government of Great Britain to\r\nanother portion of our conterminous dominion of which the division still\r\nremains to be adjusted I refer to the line from the entrance of Lake\r\nSuperior to the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods,\r\nstipulations for the settlement of which are to be found in the seventh\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent. The commissioners appointed under that\r\narticle by the two Governments having differed in their opinions, made\r\nseparate reports, according to its stipulations, upon the points of\r\ndisagreement, and these differences are now to be submitted to the\r\narbitration of some friendly sovereign or state. The disputed points should\r\nbe settled and the line designated before the Territorial government of\r\nwhich it is one of the boundaries takes its place in the Union as a State,\r\nand I rely upon the cordial cooperation of the British Government to effect\r\nthat object.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that disturbances like those which lately\r\nagitated the neighboring British Provinces will not again prove the sources\r\nof border contentions or interpose obstacles to the continuance of that\r\ngood understanding which it is the mutual interest of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States to preserve and maintain.\r\n\r\nWithin the Provinces themselves tranquillity is restored, and on our\r\nfrontier that misguided sympathy in favor of what was presumed to be a\r\ngeneral effort in behalf of popular rights, and which in some instances\r\nmisled a few of our more inexperienced citizens, has subsided into a\r\nrational conviction strongly opposed to all intermeddling with the internal\r\naffairs of our neighbors. The people of the United States feel, as it is\r\nhoped they always will, a warm solicitude for the success of all who are\r\nsincerely endeavoring to improve the political condition of mankind. This\r\ngenerous feeling they cherish toward the most distant nations, and it was\r\nnatural, therefore, that it should be awakened with more than common warmth\r\nin behalf of their immediate neighbors; but it does not belong to their\r\ncharacter as a community to seek the gratification of those feelings in\r\nacts which violate their duty as citizens, endanger the peace of their\r\ncountry, and tend to bring upon it the stain of a violated faith toward\r\nforeign nations. If, zealous to confer benefits on others, they appear for\r\na moment to lose sight of the permanent obligations imposed upon them as\r\ncitizens, they are seldom long misled. From all the information I receive,\r\nconfirmed to some extent by personal observation, I am satisfied that no\r\none can now hope to engage in such enterprises without encountering public\r\nindignation, in addition to the severest penalties of the law.\r\n\r\nRecent information also leads me to hope that the emigrants from Her\r\nMajesty's Provinces who have sought refuge within our boundaries are\r\ndisposed to become peaceable residents and to abstain from all attempts to\r\nendanger the peace of that country which has afforded them an asylum. On a\r\nreview of the occurrences on both sides of the line it is satisfactory to\r\nreflect that in almost every complaint against our country the offense may\r\nbe traced to emigrants from the Provinces who have sought refuge here. In\r\nthe few instances in which they were aided by citizens of the United States\r\nthe acts of these misguided men were not only in direct contravention of\r\nthe laws and well-known wishes of their own Government, but met with the\r\ndecided disapprobation of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nI regret to state the appearance of a different spirit among Her Majesty's\r\nsubjects in the Canadas. The sentiments of hostility to our people and\r\ninstitutions which have been so frequently expressed there, and the\r\ndisregard of our rights which has been manifested on some occasions, have,\r\nI am sorry to say, been applauded and encouraged by the people, and even by\r\nsome of the subordinate local authorities, of the Provinces. The chief\r\nofficers in Canada, fortunately, have not entertained the same feeling, and\r\nhave probably prevented excesses that must have been fatal to the peace of\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nI look forward anxiously to a period when all the transactions which have\r\ngrown out of this condition of our affairs, and which have been made the\r\nsubjects of complaint and remonstrance by the two Governments,\r\nrespectively, shall be fully examined, and the proper satisfaction given\r\nwhere it is due from either side.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred to disturb the harmony of our intercourse with\r\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Naples, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, or\r\nSweden. The internal state of Spain has sensibly improved, and a\r\nwell-grounded hope exists that the return of peace will restore to the\r\npeople of that country their former prosperity and enable the Government to\r\nfulfill all its obligations at home and abroad. The Government of Portugal,\r\nI have the satisfaction to state, has paid in full the eleventh and last\r\ninstallment due to our citizens for the claims embraced in the settlement\r\nmade with it on the 3d of March, 1837.\r\n\r\nI lay before you treaties of commerce negotiated with the Kings of Sardinia\r\nand of the Netherlands, the ratifications of which have been exchanged\r\nsince the adjournment of Congress. The liberal principles of these treaties\r\nwill recommend them to your approbation. That with Sardinia is the first\r\ntreaty of commerce formed by that Kingdom, and it will, I trust, answer the\r\nexpectations of the present Sovereign by aiding the development of the\r\nresources of his country and stimulating the enterprise of his people. That\r\nwith the Netherlands happily terminates a long-existing subject of dispute\r\nand removes from our future commercial intercourse all apprehension of\r\nembarrassment. The King of the Netherlands has also, in further\r\nillustration of his character for justice and of his desire to remove every\r\ncause of dissatisfaction, made compensation for an American vessel captured\r\nin 1800 by a French privateer, and carried into Curacoa, where the proceeds\r\nwere appropriated to the use of the colony, then, and for a short time\r\nafter, under the dominion of Holland.\r\n\r\nThe death of the late Sultan has produced no alteration in our relations\r\nwith Turkey. Our newly appointed minister resident has reached\r\nConstantinople, and I have received assurances from the present ruler that\r\nthe obligations of our treaty and those of friendship will be fulfilled by\r\nhimself in the same spirit that actuated his illustrious father.\r\n\r\nI regret to be obliged to inform you that no convention for the settlement\r\nof the claims of our citizens upon Mexico has yet been ratified by the\r\nGovernment of that country. The first convention formed for that purpose\r\nwas not presented by the President of Mexico for the approbation of its\r\nCongress, from a belief that the King of Prussia, the arbitrator in case of\r\ndisagreement in the joint commission to be appointed by the United States\r\nand Mexico, would not consent to take upon himself that friendly office.\r\nAlthough not entirely satisfied with the course pursued by Mexico, I felt\r\nno hesitation in receiving in the most conciliatory spirit the explanation\r\noffered, and also cheerfully consented to a new convention, in order to\r\narrange the payments proposed to be made to our citizens in a manner which,\r\nwhile equally just to them, was deemed less onerous and inconvenient to the\r\nMexican Government. Relying confidently upon the intentions of that\r\nGovernment, Mr. Ellis was directed to repair to Mexico, and diplomatic\r\nintercourse has been resumed between the two countries. The new convention\r\nhas, he informs us, been recently submitted by the President of that\r\nRepublic to its Congress under circumstances which promise a speedy\r\nratification, a result which I can not allow myself to doubt.\r\n\r\nInstructions have been given to the commissioner of the United States under\r\nour convention with Texas for the demarcation of the line which separates\r\nus from that Republic. The commissioners of both Governments met in New\r\nOrleans in August last. The joint commission was organized, and adjourned\r\nto convene at the same place on the 12th of October. It is presumed to be\r\nnow in the performance of its duties.\r\n\r\nThe new Government of Texas has shown its desire to cultivate friendly\r\nrelations with us by a prompt reparation for injuries complained of in the\r\ncases of two vessels of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith Central America a convention has been concluded for the renewal of its\r\nformer treaty with the United States. This was not ratified before the\r\ndeparture of our late charge d'affaires from that country, and the copy of\r\nit brought by him was not received before the adjournment of the Senate at\r\nthe last session. In the meanwhile, the period limited for the exchange of\r\nratifications having expired, I deemed it expedient, in consequence of the\r\ndeath of the charge d'affaires, to send a special agent to Central America\r\nto close the affairs of our mission there and to arrange with the\r\nGovernment an extension of the time for the exchange of ratifications.\r\n\r\nThe commission created by the States which formerly composed the Republic\r\nof Colombia for adjusting the claims against that Government has by a very\r\nunexpected construction of the treaty under which it acts decided that no\r\nprovision was made for those claims of citizens of the United States which\r\narose from captures by Colombian privateers and were adjudged against the\r\nclaimants in the judicial tribunals. This decision will compel the United\r\nStates to apply to the several Governments formerly united for redress.\r\nWith all these--New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador--a perfectly good\r\nunderstanding exists. Our treaty with Venezuela is faithfully carried into\r\nexecution, and that country, in the enjoyment of tranquillity, is gradually\r\nadvancing in prosperity under the guidance of its present distinguished\r\nPresident, General Paez. With Ecuador a liberal commercial convention has\r\nlately been concluded, which will be transmitted to the Senate at an early\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWith the great American Empire of Brazil our relations continue unchanged,\r\nas does our friendly intercourse with the other Governments of South\r\nAmerica--the Argentine Republic and the Republics of Uruguay, Chili, Peru,\r\nand Bolivia. The dissolution of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation may\r\noccasion some temporary inconvenience to our citizens in that quarter, but\r\nthe obligations on the new Governments which have arisen out of that\r\nConfederation to observe its treaty stipulations will no doubt be soon\r\nunderstood, and it is presumed that no indisposition will exist to fulfill\r\nthose which it contracted with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe financial operations of the Government during the present year have, I\r\nam happy to say, been very successful. The difficulties under which the\r\nTreasury Department has labored, from known defects in the existing laws\r\nrelative to the safe-keeping of the public moneys, aggravated by the\r\nsuspension of specie payments by several of the banks holding public\r\ndeposits or indebted to public officers for notes received in payment of\r\npublic dues, have been surmounted to a very gratifying extent. The large\r\ncurrent expenditures have been punctually met, and the faith of the\r\nGovernment in all its pecuniary concerns has been scrupulously maintained.\r\n\r\nThe nineteen millions of Treasury notes authorized by the act of Congress\r\nof 1837, and the modifications thereof with a view to the indulgence of\r\nmerchants on their duty bonds and of the deposit banks in the payment of\r\npublic moneys held by them, have been so punctually redeemed as to leave\r\nless than the original ten millions outstanding at any one time, and the\r\nwhole amount unredeemed now falls short of three millions. Of these the\r\nchief portion is not due till next year, and the whole would have been\r\nalready extinguished could the Treasury have realized the payments due to\r\nit from the banks. If those due from them during the next year shall be\r\npunctually made, and if Congress shall keep the appropriations within the\r\nestimates, there is every reason to believe that all the outstanding\r\nTreasury notes can be redeemed and the ordinary expenses defrayed without\r\nimposing on the people any additional burden, either of loans or increased\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this and to keep the expenditures within reasonable bounds is a\r\nduty second only in importance to the preservation of our national\r\ncharacter and the protection of our citizens in their civil and political\r\nrights. The creation in time of peace of a debt likely to become permanent\r\nis an evil for which there is no equivalent. The rapidity with which many\r\nof the States are apparently approaching to this condition admonishes us of\r\nour own duties in a manner too impressive to be disregarded. One, not the\r\nleast important, is to keep the Federal Government always in a condition to\r\ndischarge with ease and vigor its highest functions should their exercise\r\nbe required by any sudden conjuncture of public affairs--a condition to\r\nwhich we are always exposed and which may occur when it is least expected.\r\nTo this end it is indispensable that its finances should be untrammeled and\r\nits resources as far as practicable unencumbered. No circumstance could\r\npresent greater obstacles to the accomplishment of these vitally important\r\nobjects than the creation of an onerous national debt. Our own experience\r\nand also that of other nations have demonstrated the unavoidable and\r\nfearful rapidity with which a public debt is increased when the Government\r\nhas once surrendered itself to the ruinous practice of supplying its\r\nsupposed necessities by new loans. The struggle, therefore, on our part to\r\nbe successful must be made at the threshold. To make our efforts effective,\r\nsevere economy is necessary. This is the surest provision for the national\r\nwelfare, and it is at the same time the best preservative of the principles\r\non which our institutions rest. Simplicity and economy in the affairs of\r\nstate have never failed to chasten and invigorate republican principles,\r\nwhile these have been as surely subverted by national prodigality, under\r\nwhatever specious pretexts it may have been introduced or fostered.\r\n\r\nThese considerations can not be lost upon a people who have never been\r\ninattentive to the effect of their policy upon the institutions they have\r\ncreated for themselves, but at the present moment their force is augmented\r\nby the necessity which a decreasing revenue must impose. The check lately\r\ngiven to importations of articles subject to duties, the derangements in\r\nthe operations of internal trade, and especially the reduction gradually\r\ntaking place in our tariff of duties, all tend materially to lessen our\r\nreceipts; indeed, it is probable that the diminution resulting from the\r\nlast cause alone will not fall short of $5,000,000 in the year 1842, as the\r\nfinal reduction of all duties to 20 per cent then takes effect. The whole\r\nrevenue then accruing from the customs and from the sales of public lands,\r\nif not more, will undoubtedly be wanted to defray the necessary expenses of\r\nthe Government under the most prudent administration of its affairs. These\r\nare circumstances that impose the necessity of rigid economy and require\r\nits prompt and constant exercise. With the Legislature rest the power and\r\nduty of so adjusting the public expenditure as to promote this end. By the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution it is only in consequence of appropriations\r\nmade by law that money can be drawn from the Treasury. No instance has\r\noccurred since the establishment of the Government in which the Executive,\r\nthough a component part of the legislative power, has interposed an\r\nobjection to an appropriation bill on the sole ground of its extravagance.\r\nHis duty in this respect has been considered fulfilled by requesting such\r\nappropriations only as the public service may be reasonably expected to\r\nrequire. In the present earnest direction of the public mind toward this\r\nsubject both the Executive and the Legislature have evidence of the strict\r\nresponsibility to which they will be held; and while I am conscious of my\r\nown anxious efforts to perform with fidelity this portion of my public\r\nfunctions, it is a satisfaction to me to be able to count on a cordial\r\ncooperation from you.\r\n\r\nAt the time I entered upon my present duties our ordinary disbursements,\r\nwithout including those on account of the public debt, the Post-Office, and\r\nthe trust funds in charge of the Government, had been largely increased by\r\nappropriations for the removal of the Indians, for repelling Indian\r\nhostilities, and for other less urgent expenses which grew out of an\r\noverflowing Treasury. Independent of the redemption of the public debt and\r\ntrusts, the gross expenditures of seventeen and eighteen millions in 1834\r\nand 1835 had by these causes swelled to twenty-nine millions in 1836, and\r\nthe appropriations for 1837, made previously to the 4th of March, caused\r\nthe expenditure to rise to the very large amount of thirty-three millions.\r\nWe were enabled during the year 1838, notwithstanding the continuance of\r\nour Indian embarrassments, somewhat to reduce this amount, and that for the\r\npresent year (1839) will not in all probability exceed twenty-six millions,\r\nor six millions less than it was last year. With a determination, so far as\r\ndepends on me, to continue this reduction, I have directed the estimates\r\nfor 1840 to be subjected to the severest scrutiny and to be limited to the\r\nabsolute requirements of the public service. They will be found less than\r\nthe expenditures of 1839 by over $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe precautionary measures which will be recommended by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to protect faithfully the public credit under the fluctuations\r\nand contingencies to which our receipts and expenditures are exposed, and\r\nespecially in a commercial crisis like the present, are commended to your\r\nearly attention.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion your attention was invited to various considerations\r\nin support of a preemption law in behalf of the settlers on the public\r\nlands, and also of a law graduating the prices for such lands as had long\r\nbeen in the market unsold in consequence of their inferior quality. The\r\nexecution of the act which was passed on the first subject has been\r\nattended with the happiest consequences in quieting titles and securing\r\nimprovements to the industrious, and it has also to a very gratifying\r\nextent been exempt from the frauds which were practiced under previous\r\npreemption laws. It has at the same time, as was anticipated, contributed\r\nliberally during the present year to the receipts of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe passage of a graduation law, with the guards before recommended, would\r\nalso, I am persuaded, add considerably to the revenue for several years,\r\nand prove in other respects just and beneficial. Your early consideration\r\nof the subject is therefore once more earnestly requested.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the defenses of our principal seaports and\r\nnavy-yards, as represented by the accompanying report of the Secretary of\r\nWar, calls for the early and serious attention of Congress; and, as\r\nconnecting itself intimately with this subject, I can not recommend too\r\nstrongly to your consideration the plan submitted by that officer for the\r\norganization of the militia of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the expressed wishes of Congress, an attempt was made in\r\nthe spring to terminate the Florida war by negotiation. It is to be\r\nregretted that these humane intentions should have been frustrated and that\r\nthe effort to bring these unhappy difficulties to a satisfactory conclusion\r\nshould have failed; but after entering into solemn engagements with the\r\ncommanding general, the Indians, without any provocation, recommenced their\r\nacts of treachery and murder. The renewal of hostilities in that Territory\r\nrenders it necessary that I should recommend to your favorable\r\nconsideration the plan which will be submitted to you by the Secretary of\r\nWar, in order to enable that Department to conduct them to a successful\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nHaving had an opportunity of personally inspecting a portion of the troops\r\nduring the last summer, it gives me pleasure to bear testimony to the\r\nsuccess of the effort to improve their discipline by keeping them together\r\nin as large bodies as the nature of our service will permit. I recommend,\r\ntherefore, that commodious and permanent barracks be constructed at the\r\nseveral posts designated by the Secretary of War. Notwithstanding the high\r\nstate of their discipline and excellent police, the evils resulting to the\r\nservice from the deficiency of company officers were very apparent, and I\r\nrecommend that the staff officers be permanently separated from the line.\r\n\r\nThe Navy has been usefully and honorably employed in protecting the rights\r\nand property of our citizens wherever the condition of affairs seemed to\r\nrequire its presence. With the exception of one instance, where an outrage,\r\naccompanied by murder, was committed on a vessel of the United States while\r\nengaged in a lawful commerce, nothing is known to have occurred to impede\r\nor molest the enterprise of our citizens on that element, where it is so\r\nsignally displayed. On learning this daring act of piracy, Commodore Reed\r\nproceeded immediately to the spot, and receiving no satisfaction, either in\r\nthe surrender of the murderers or the restoration of the plundered\r\nproperty, inflicted severe and merited chastisement on the barbarians.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Navy respecting the\r\ndisposition of our ships of war that it has been deemed necessary to\r\nstation a competent force on the coast of Africa to prevent a fraudulent\r\nuse of our flag by foreigners.\r\n\r\nRecent experience has shown that the provisions in our existing laws which\r\nrelate to the sale and transfer of American vessels while abroad are\r\nextremely defective. Advantage has been taken of these defects to give to\r\nvessels wholly belonging to foreigners and navigating the ocean an apparent\r\nAmerican ownership. This character has been so well simulated as to afford\r\nthem comparative security in prosecuting the slave trade--a traffic\r\nemphatically denounced in our statutes, regarded with abhorrence by our\r\ncitizens, and of which the effectual suppression is nowhere more sincerely\r\ndesired than in the United States. These circumstances make it proper to\r\nrecommend to your early attention a careful revision of these laws, so that\r\nwithout impeding the freedom and facilities of our navigation or impairing\r\nan important branch of our industry connected with it the integrity and\r\nhonor of our flag may be carefully preserved. Information derived from our\r\nconsul at Havana showing the necessity of this was communicated to a\r\ncommittee of the Senate near the close of the last session, but too late,\r\nas it appeared, to be acted upon. It will be brought to your notice by the\r\nproper Department, with additional communications from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe latest accounts from the exploring expedition represent it as\r\nproceeding successfully in its objects and promising results no less useful\r\nto trade and navigation than to science.\r\n\r\nThe extent of post-roads covered by mail service on the 1st of July last\r\nwas about 133,999 miles and the rate of annual transportation upon them\r\n34,496,878 miles. The number of post-offices on that day was 12,780 and on\r\nthe 30th ultimo 13,028.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the Post-Office Department for the year ending with the 30th\r\nof June last was $4,476,638, exhibiting an increase over the preceding year\r\nof $241,560. The engagements and liabilities of the Department for the same\r\nperiod are $4,624,117.\r\n\r\nThe excess of liabilities over the revenue for the last two years has been\r\nmet out of the surplus which had previously accumulated. The cash on hand\r\non the 30th ultimo was about $206,701.95 and the current income of the\r\nDepartment varies very little from the rate of current expenditures. Most\r\nof the service suspended last year has been restored, and most of the new\r\nroutes established by the act of 7th July, 1838, have been set in\r\noperation, at an annual cost of $136,963. Notwithstanding the pecuniary\r\ndifficulties of the country, the revenue of the Department appears to be\r\nincreasing, and unless it shall be seriously checked by the recent\r\nsuspension of payment by so many of the banks it will be able not only to\r\nmaintain the present mail service, but in a short time to extend it. It is\r\ngratifying to witness the promptitude and fidelity with which the agents of\r\nthis Department in general perform their public duties.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties have arisen in relation to contracts for the\r\ntransportation of the mails by railroad and steamboat companies. It appears\r\nthat the maximum of compensation provided by Congress for the\r\ntransportation of the mails upon railroads is not sufficient to induce some\r\nof the companies to convey them at such hours as are required for the\r\naccommodation of the public. It is one of the most important duties of the\r\nGeneral Government to provide and maintain for the use of the people of the\r\nStates the best practicable mail establishment. To arrive at that end it is\r\nindispensable that the Post-Office Department shall be enabled to control\r\nthe hours at which the mails shall be carried over railroads, as it now\r\ndoes over all other roads. Should serious inconveniences arise from the\r\ninadequacy of the compensation now provided by law, or from unreasonable\r\ndemands by any of the railroad companies, the subject is of such general\r\nimportance as to require the prompt attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn relation to steamboat lines, the most efficient remedy is obvious and\r\nhas been suggested by the Postmaster-General. The War and Navy Departments\r\nalready employ steamboats in their service; and although it is by no means\r\ndesirable that the Government should undertake the transportation of\r\npassengers or freight as a business, there can be no reasonable objection\r\nto running boats, temporarily, whenever it may be necessary to put down\r\nattempts at extortion, to be discontinued as soon as reasonable contracts\r\ncan be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Postmaster-General relative to the inadequacy of the\r\nlegal allowance to witnesses in cases of prosecutions for mail depredations\r\nmerit your serious consideration. The safety of the mails requires that\r\nsuch prosecutions shall be efficient, and justice to the citizen whose time\r\nis required to be given to the public demands not only that his expenses\r\nshall be paid, but that he shall receive a reasonable compensation.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the War, Navy, and Post-Office Departments will accompany\r\nthis communication, and one from the Treasury Department will be presented\r\nto Congress in a few days.\r\n\r\nFor various details in respect to the matters in charge of these\r\nDepartments I would refer you to those important documents, satisfied that\r\nyou will find in them many valuable suggestions which will be found well\r\ndeserving the attention of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nFrom a report made in December of last year by the Secretary of State to\r\nthe Senate, showing the trial docket of each of the circuit courts and the\r\nnumber of miles each judge has to travel in the performance of his duties,\r\na great inequality appears in the amount of labor assigned to each judge.\r\nThe number of terms to be held in each of the courts composing the ninth\r\ncircuit, the distances between the places at which they sit and from thence\r\nto the seat of Government, are represented to be such as to render it\r\nimpossible for the judge of that circuit to perform in a manner\r\ncorresponding with the public exigencies his term and circuit duties. A\r\nrevision, therefore, of the present arrangement of the circuit seems to be\r\ncalled for and is recommended to your notice.\r\n\r\nI think it proper to call your attention to the power assumed by\r\nTerritorial legislatures to authorize the issue of bonds by corporate\r\ncompanies on the guaranty of the Territory. Congress passed a law in 1836\r\nproviding that no act of a Territorial legislature incorporating banks\r\nshould have the force of law until approved by Congress, but acts of a very\r\nexceptionable character previously passed by the legislature of Florida\r\nwere suffered to remain in force, by virtue of which bonds may be issued to\r\na very large amount by those institutions upon the faith of the Territory.\r\nA resolution, intending to be a joint one, passed the Senate at the same\r\nsession, expressing the sense of Congress that the laws in question ought\r\nnot to be permitted to remain in force unless amended in many material\r\nrespects; but it failed in the House of Representatives for want of time,\r\nand the desired amendments have not been made. The interests involved are\r\nof great importance, and the subject deserves your early and careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe continued agitation of the question relative to the best mode of\r\nkeeping and disbursing the public money still injuriously affects the\r\nbusiness of the country. The suspension of specie payments in 1837 rendered\r\nthe use of deposit banks as prescribed by the act of 1836 a source rather\r\nof embarrassment than aid, and of necessity placed the custody of most of\r\nthe public money afterwards collected in charge of the public officers. The\r\nnew securities for its safety which this required were a principal cause of\r\nmy convening an extra session of Congress, but in consequence of a\r\ndisagreement between the two Houses neither then nor at any subsequent\r\nperiod has there been any legislation on the subject. The effort made at\r\nthe last session to obtain the authority of Congress to punish the use of\r\npublic money for private purposes as a crime a measure attended under other\r\ngovernments with signal advantage--was also unsuccessful, from diversities\r\nof opinion in that body, notwithstanding the anxiety doubtless felt by it\r\nto afford every practicable security. The result of this is still to leave\r\nthe custody of the public money without those safeguards which have been\r\nfor several years earnestly desired by the Executive, and as the remedy is\r\nonly to be found in the action of the Legislature it imposes on me the duty\r\nof again submitting to you the propriety of passing a law providing for the\r\nsafe-keeping of the public moneys, and especially to ask that its use for\r\nprivate purposes by any officers intrusted with it may be declared to be a\r\nfelony, punishable with penalties proportioned to the magnitude of the\r\noffense.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, added to known defects in the existing laws and\r\nunusual derangement in the general operations of trade, have during the\r\nlast three years much increased the difficulties attendant on the\r\ncollection, keeping, and disbursement of the revenue, and called forth\r\ncorresponding exertions from those having them in charge. Happily these\r\nhave been successful beyond expectation. Vast sums have been collected and\r\ndisbursed by the several Departments with unexpected cheapness and ease,\r\ntransfers have been readily made to every part of the Union, however\r\ndistant, and defalcations have been far less than might have been\r\nanticipated from the absence of adequate legal restraints. Since the\r\nofficers of the Treasury and Post-Office Departments were charged with the\r\ncustody of most of the public moneys received by them there have been\r\ncollected $66,000,000, and, excluding the case of the late collector at New\r\nYork, the aggregate amount of losses sustained in the collection can not,\r\nit is believed, exceed $60,000. The defalcation of the late collector at\r\nthat city, of the extent and circumstances of which Congress have been\r\nfully informed, ran through all the modes of keeping the public money that\r\nhave been hitherto in use, and was distinguished by an aggravated disregard\r\nof duty that broke through the restraints of every system, and can not,\r\ntherefore, be usefully referred to as a test of the comparative safety of\r\neither. Additional information will also be furnished by the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, in reply to a call made upon that officer by the\r\nHouse of Representatives at the last session requiring detailed information\r\non the subject of defaults by public officers or agents under each\r\nAdministration from 1789 to 1837. This document will be submitted to you in\r\na few days. The general results (independent of the Post-Office, which is\r\nkept separately and will be stated by itself), so far as they bear upon\r\nthis subject, are that the losses which have been and are likely to be\r\nsustained by any class of agents have been the greatest by banks,\r\nincluding, as required in the resolution, their depreciated paper received\r\nfor public dues; that the next largest have been by disbursing officers,\r\nand the least by collectors and receivers. If the losses on duty bonds are\r\nincluded, they alone will be threefold those by both collectors and\r\nreceivers. Our whole experience, therefore, furnishes the strongest\r\nevidence that the desired legislation of Congress is alone wanting to\r\ninsure in those operations the highest degree of security and facility.\r\nSuch also appears to have been the experience of other nations. From the\r\nresults of inquiries made by the Secretary of the Treasury in regard to the\r\npractice among them I am enabled to state that in twenty-two out of\r\ntwenty-seven foreign governments from which undoubted information has been\r\nobtained the public moneys are kept in charge of public officers. This\r\nconcurrence of opinion in favor of that system is perhaps as great as\r\nexists on any question of internal administration.\r\n\r\nIn the modes of business and official restraints on disbursing officers no\r\nlegal change was produced by the suspension of specie payments. The report\r\nlast referred to will be found to contain also much useful information in\r\nrelation to this subject.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore assigned to Congress my reasons for believing that the\r\nestablishment of an independent National Treasury, as contemplated by the\r\nConstitution, is necessary to the safe action of the Federal Government.\r\nThe suspension of specie payments in 1837 by the banks having the custody\r\nof the public money showed in so alarming a degree our dependence on those\r\ninstitutions for the performance of duties required by law that I then\r\nrecommended the entire dissolution of that connection. This recommendation\r\nhas been subjected, as I desired it should be, to severe scrutiny and\r\nanimated discussion, and I allow myself to believe that notwithstanding the\r\nnatural diversities of opinion which may be anticipated on all subjects\r\ninvolving such important considerations, it has secured in its favor as\r\ngeneral a concurrence of public sentiment as could be expected on one of\r\nsuch magnitude.\r\n\r\nRecent events have also continued to develop new objections to such a\r\nconnection. Seldom is any bank, under the existing system and practice,\r\nable to meet on demand all its liabilities for deposits and notes in\r\ncirculation. It maintains specie payments and transacts a profitable\r\nbusiness only by the confidence of the public in its solvency, and whenever\r\nthis is destroyed the demands of its depositors and note holders, pressed\r\nmore rapidly than it can make collections from its debtors, force it to\r\nstop payment. This loss of confidence, with its consequences, occurred in\r\n1837, and afforded the apology of the banks for their suspension. The\r\npublic then acquiesced in the validity of the excuse, and while the State\r\nlegislatures did not exact from them their forfeited charters, Congress, in\r\naccordance with the recommendation of the Executive, allowed them time to\r\npay over the public money they held, although compelled to issue Treasury\r\nnotes to supply the deficiency thus created.\r\n\r\nIt now appears that there are other motives than a want of public\r\nconfidence under which the banks seek to justify themselves in a refusal to\r\nmeet their obligations. Scarcely were the country and Government relieved\r\nin a degree from the difficulties occasioned by the general suspension of\r\n1837 when a partial one, occurring within thirty months of the former,\r\nproduced new and serious embarrassments, though it had no palliation in\r\nsuch circumstances as were alleged in justification of that which had\r\npreviously taken place. There was nothing in the condition of the country\r\nto endanger a well-managed banking institution; commerce was deranged by no\r\nforeign war; every branch of manufacturing industry was crowned with rich\r\nrewards, and the more than usual abundance of our harvests, after supplying\r\nour domestic wants, had left our granaries and storehouses filled with a\r\nsurplus for exportation. It is in the midst of this that an irredeemable\r\nand depreciated paper currency is entailed upon the people by a large\r\nportion of the banks. They are not driven to it by the exhibition of a loss\r\nof public confidence or of a sudden pressure from their depositors or note\r\nholders, but they excuse themselves by alleging that the current of\r\nbusiness and exchange with foreign countries, which draws the precious\r\nmetals from their vaults, would require in order to meet it a larger\r\ncurtailment of their loans to a comparatively small portion of the\r\ncommunity than it will be convenient for them to bear or perhaps safe for\r\nthe banks to exact. The plea has ceased to be one of necessity. Convenience\r\nand policy are now deemed sufficient to warrant these institutions in\r\ndisregarding their solemn obligations. Such conduct is not merely an injury\r\nto individual creditors, but it is a wrong to the whole community, from\r\nwhose liberality they hold most valuable privileges, whose rights they\r\nviolate, whose business they derange, and the value of whose property they\r\nrender unstable and insecure. It must be evident that this new ground for\r\nbank suspensions, in reference to which their action is not only\r\ndisconnected with, but wholly independent of, that of the public, gives a\r\ncharacter to their suspensions more alarming than any which they exhibited\r\nbefore, and greatly increases the impropriety of relying on the banks in\r\nthe transactions of the Government.\r\n\r\nA large and highly respectable portion of our banking institutions are, it\r\naffords me unfeigned pleasure to state, exempted from all blame on account\r\nof this second delinquency. They have, to their great credit, not only\r\ncontinued to meet their engagements, but have even repudiated the grounds\r\nof suspension now resorted to. It is only by such a course that the\r\nconfidence and good will of the community can be preserved, and in the\r\nsequel the best interests of the institutions themselves promoted.\r\n\r\nNew dangers to the banks are also daily disclosed from the extension of\r\nthat system of extravagant credit of which they are the pillars. Formerly\r\nour foreign commerce was principally rounded on an exchange of commodities,\r\nincluding the precious metals, and leaving in its transactions but little\r\nforeign debt. Such is not now the case. Aided by the facilities afforded by\r\nthe banks, mere credit has become too commonly the basis of trade. Many of\r\nthe banks themselves, not content with largely stimulating this system\r\namong others, have usurped the business, while they impair the stability,\r\nof the mercantile community; they have become borrowers instead of lenders;\r\nthey establish their agencies abroad; they deal largely in stocks and\r\nmerchandise; they encourage the issue of State securities until the foreign\r\nmarket is glutted with them; and, unsatisfied with the legitimate use of\r\ntheir own capital and the exercise of their lawful privileges, they raise\r\nby large loans additional means for every variety of speculation. The\r\ndisasters attendant on this deviation from the former course of business in\r\nthis country are now shared alike by banks and individuals to an extent of\r\nwhich there is perhaps no previous example in the annals of our country. So\r\nlong as a willingness of the foreign lender and a sufficient export of our\r\nproductions to meet any necessary partial payments leave the flow of credit\r\nundisturbed all appears to be prosperous, but as soon as it is checked by\r\nany hesitation abroad or by an inability to make payment there in our\r\nproductions the evils of the system are disclosed. The paper currency,\r\nwhich might serve for domestic purposes, is useless to pay the debt due in\r\nEurope. Gold and silver are therefore drawn in exchange for their notes\r\nfrom the banks. To keep up their supply of coin these institutions are\r\nobliged to call upon their own debtors, who pay them principally in their\r\nown notes, which are as unavailable to them as they are to the merchants to\r\nmeet the foreign demand. The calls of the banks, therefore, in such\r\nemergencies of necessity exceed that demand, and produce a corresponding\r\ncurtailment of their accommodations and of the currency at the very moment\r\nwhen the state of trade renders it most inconvenient to be borne. The\r\nintensity of this pressure on the community is in proportion to the\r\nprevious liberality of credit and consequent expansion of the currency.\r\nForced sales of property are made at the time when the means of purchasing\r\nare most reduced, and the worst calamities to individuals are only at last\r\narrested by an open violation of their obligations by the banks--a refusal\r\nto pay specie for their notes and an imposition upon the community of a\r\nfluctuating and depreciated currency.\r\n\r\nThese consequences are inherent in the present system. They are not\r\ninfluenced by the banks being large or small, created by National or State\r\nGovernments. They are the results of the irresistible laws of trade or\r\ncredit. In the recent events, which have so strikingly illustrated the\r\ncertain effects of these laws, we have seen the bank of the largest capital\r\nin the Union, established under a national charter, and lately\r\nstrengthened, as we were authoritatively informed, by exchanging that for a\r\nState charter with new and unusual privileges--in a condition, too, as it\r\nwas said, of entire soundness and great prosperity--not merely unable to\r\nresist these effects, but the first to yield to them.\r\n\r\nNor is it to be overlooked that there exists a chain of necessary\r\ndependence among these institutions which obliges them to a great extent to\r\nfollow the course of others, notwithstanding its injustice to their own\r\nimmediate creditors or injury to the particular community in which they are\r\nplaced. This dependence of a bank, which is in proportion to the extent of\r\nits debts for circulation and deposits, is not merely on others in its own\r\nvicinity, but on all those which connect it with the center of trade.\r\nDistant banks may fail without seriously affecting those in our principal\r\ncommercial cities, but the failure of the latter is felt at the extremities\r\nof the Union. The suspension at New York in 1837 was everywhere, with very\r\nfew exceptions, followed as soon as it was known. That recently at\r\nPhiladelphia immediately affected the banks of the South and West in a\r\nsimilar manner. This dependence of our whole banking system on the\r\ninstitutions in a few large cities is not found in the laws of their\r\norganization, but in those of trade and exchange. The banks at that center,\r\nto which currency flows and where it is required in payments for\r\nmerchandise, hold the power of controlling those in regions whence it\r\ncomes, while the latter possess no means of restraining them; so that the\r\nvalue of individual property and the prosperity of trade through the whole\r\ninterior of the country are made to depend on the good or bad management of\r\nthe banking institutions in the great seats of trade on the seaboard.\r\n\r\nBut this chain of dependence does not stop here. It does not terminate at\r\nPhiladelphia or New York. It reaches across the ocean and ends in London,\r\nthe center of the credit system. The same laws of trade which give to the\r\nbanks in our principal cities power over the whole banking system of the\r\nUnited States subject the former, in their turn, to the money power in\r\nGreat Britain. It is not denied that the suspension of the New York banks\r\nin 1837, which was followed in quick succession throughout the Union, was\r\nproduced by an application of that power, and it is now alleged, in\r\nextenuation of the present condition of so large a portion of our banks,\r\nthat their embarrassments have arisen from the same cause.\r\n\r\nFrom this influence they can not now entirely escape, for it has its origin\r\nin the credit currencies of the two countries; it is strengthened by the\r\ncurrent of trade and exchange which centers in London, and is rendered\r\nalmost irresistible by the large debts contracted there by our merchants,\r\nour banks, and our States. It is thus that an introduction of a new bank\r\ninto the most distant of our villages places the business of that village\r\nwithin the influence of the money power in England; it is thus that every\r\nnew debt which we contract in that country seriously affects our own\r\ncurrency and extends over the pursuits of our citizens its powerful\r\ninfluence. We can not escape from this by making new banks, great or small,\r\nState or national. The same chains which bind those now existing to the\r\ncenter of this system of paper credit must equally fetter every similar\r\ninstitution we create. It is only by the extent to which this system has\r\nbeen pushed of late that we have been made fully aware of its irresistible\r\ntendency to subject our own banks and currency to a vast controlling power\r\nin a foreign lad, and it adds a new argument to those which illustrate\r\ntheir precarious situation.. Endangered in the first place by their own\r\nmismanagement and again by the conduct of every institution which connects\r\nthem with the center of trade in our own country, they are yet subjected\r\nbeyond all this to the effect of whatever measures policy, necessity, or\r\ncaprice may induce those who control the credits of England to resort to. I\r\nmean not to comment upon these measures, present or past, and much less to\r\ndiscourage the prosecution of fair commercial dealing between the two\r\ncountries, based on reciprocal benefits; but it having now been made\r\nmanifest that the power of inflicting these and similar injuries is by the\r\nresistless law of a credit currency and credit trade equally capable of\r\nextending their consequences through all the ramifications of our banking\r\nsystem, and by that means indirectly obtaining, particularly when our banks\r\nare used as depositories of the public moneys, a dangerous political\r\ninfluence in the United States, I have deemed it my duty to bring the\r\nsubject to your notice and ask for it your serious consideration.\r\n\r\nIs an argument required beyond the exposition of these facts to show the\r\nimpropriety of using our banking institutions as depositories of the public\r\nmoney? Can we venture not only to encounter the risk of their individual\r\nand mutual mismanagement, but at the same time to place our foreign and\r\ndomestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest?\r\nTo do so is to impair the independence of our Government, as the present\r\ncredit system has already impaired the independence of our banks; it is to\r\nsubmit all its important operations, whether of peace or war, to be\r\ncontrolled or thwarted, at first by our own banks and then by a power\r\nabroad greater than themselves. I can not bring myself to depict the\r\nhumiliation to which this Government and people might be sooner or later\r\nreduced if the means for defending their rights are to be made dependent\r\nupon those who may have the most powerful of motives to impair them.\r\n\r\nNor is it only in reference to the effect of this state of things on the\r\nindependence of our Government or of our banks that the subject presents\r\nitself for consideration; it is to be viewed also in its relations to the\r\ngeneral trade of our country. The time is not long passed when a deficiency\r\nof foreign crops was thought to afford a profitable market for the surplus\r\nof our industry, but now we await with feverish anxiety the news of the\r\nEnglish harvest, not so much from motives of commendable sympathy, but\r\nfearful lest its anticipated failure should narrow the field of credit\r\nthere. Does not this speak volumes to the patriot? Can a system be\r\nbeneficent, wise, or just which creates greater anxiety for interests\r\ndependent on foreign credit than for the general prosperity of our own\r\ncountry and the profitable exportation of the surplus produce of our\r\nlabor?\r\n\r\nThe circumstances to which I have thus adverted appear to me to afford\r\nweighty reasons, developed by late events, to be added to those which I\r\nhave on former occasions offered when submitting to your better knowledge\r\nand discernment the propriety of separating the custody of the public money\r\nfrom banking institutions. Nor has anything occurred to lessen, in my\r\nopinion, the force of what has been heretofore urged. The only ground on\r\nwhich that custody can be desired by the banks is the profitable use which\r\nthey may make of the money. Such use would be regarded in individuals as a\r\nbreach of trust or a crime of great magnitude, and yet it may be reasonably\r\ndoubted whether, first and last, it is not attended with more mischievous\r\nconsequences when permitted to the former than to the latter. The practice\r\nof permitting the public money to be used by its keepers, as here, is\r\nbelieved to be peculiar to this country and to exist scarcely anywhere\r\nelse. To procure it here improper influences are appealed to, unwise\r\nconnections are established between the Government and vast numbers of\r\npowerful State institutions, other motives than the public good are brought\r\nto bear both on the executive and legislative departments, and selfish\r\ncombinations leading to special legislation are formed. It is made the\r\ninterest of banking institutions and their stockholders throughout the\r\nUnion to use their exertions for the increase of taxation and the\r\naccumulation of a surplus revenue, and while an excuse is afforded the\r\nmeans are furnished for those excessive issues which lead to extravagant\r\ntrading and speculation and are the forerunners of a vast debt abroad and a\r\nsuspension of the banks at home.\r\n\r\nImpressed, therefore, as I am with the propriety of the funds of the\r\nGovernment being withdrawn from the private use of either banks or\r\nindividuals, and the public money kept by duly appointed public agents, and\r\nbelieving as I do that such also is the judgment which discussion,\r\nreflection, and experience have produced on the public mind, I leave the\r\nsubject with you. It is, at all events, essential to the interests of the\r\ncommunity and the business of the Government that a decision should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nMost of the arguments that dissuade us from employing banks in the custody\r\nand disbursement of the public money apply with equal force to the receipt\r\nof their notes for public dues. The difference is only in form. In one\r\ninstance the Government is a creditor for its deposits, and in the other\r\nfor the notes it holds. They afford the same opportunity for using the\r\npublic moneys, and equally lead to all the evils attendant upon it, since a\r\nbank can as safely extend its discounts on a deposit of its notes in the\r\nhands of a public officer as on one made in its own vaults. On the other\r\nhand, it would give to the Government no greater security, for in case of\r\nfailure the claim of the note holder would be no better than that of a\r\ndepositor.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the danger of inconvenience to the public and unreasonable\r\npressure upon sound banks have been urged as objections to requiring the\r\npayment of the revenue in gold and silver. These objections have been\r\ngreatly exaggerated. From the best estimates we may safely fix the amount\r\nof specie in the country at $85,000,000, and the portion of that which\r\nwould be employed at any one time in the receipts and disbursements of the\r\nGovernment, even if the proposed change were made at once, would not, it is\r\nnow, after fuller investigation, believed exceed four or five millions. If\r\nthe change were gradual, several years would elapse before that sum would\r\nbe required, with annual opportunities in the meantime to alter the law\r\nshould experience prove it to be oppressive or inconvenient. The portions\r\nof the community on whose business the change would immediately operate are\r\ncomparatively small, nor is it believed that its effect would be in the\r\nleast unjust or injurious to them.\r\n\r\nIn the payment of duties, which constitute by far the greater portion of\r\nthe revenue, a very large proportion is derived from foreign commission\r\nhouses and agents of foreign manufacturers, who sell the goods consigned to\r\nthem generally at auction, and after paying the duties out of the avails\r\nremit the rest abroad in specie or its equivalent. That the amount of\r\nduties should in such cases be also retained in specie can hardly be made a\r\nmatter of complaint. Our own importing merchants, by whom the residue of\r\nthe duties is paid, are not only peculiarly interested in maintaining a\r\nsound currency, which the measure in question will especially promote, but\r\nare from the nature of their dealings best able to know when specie will be\r\nneeded and to procure it with the least difficulty or sacrifice. Residing,\r\ntoo, almost universally in places where the revenue is received and where\r\nthe drafts used by the Government for its disbursements must concentrate,\r\nthey have every opportunity to obtain and use them in place of specie\r\nshould it be for their interest or convenience. Of the number of these\r\ndrafts and the facilities they may afford, as well as of the rapidity with\r\nwhich the public funds are drawn and disbursed, an idea may be formed from\r\nthe fact that of nearly $20,000,000 paid to collectors and receivers during\r\nthe present year the average amount in their hands at any one time has not\r\nexceeded a million and a half, and of the fifteen millions received by the\r\ncollector of New York alone during the present year the average amount held\r\nby him subject to draft during each week has been less than half a\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nThe ease and safety of the operations of the Treasury in keeping the public\r\nmoney are promoted by the application of its own drafts to the public dues.\r\nThe objection arising from having them too long outstanding might be\r\nobviated and they yet made to afford to merchants and banks holding them an\r\nequivalent for specie, and in that way greatly lessen the amount actually\r\nrequired. Still less inconvenience will attend the requirement of specie in\r\npurchases of public lands. Such purchases, except when made on speculation,\r\nare in general but single transactions, rarely repeated by the same person;\r\nand it is a fact that for the last year and a half, during which the notes\r\nof sound banks have been received, more than a moiety of these payments has\r\nbeen voluntarily made in specie, being a larger proportion than would have\r\nbeen required in three years under the graduation proposed.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, a principle than which none is better settled by\r\nexperience that the supply of the precious metals will always be found\r\nadequate to the uses for which they are required. They abound in countries\r\nwhere no other currency is allowed. In our own States, where small notes\r\nare excluded, gold and silver supply their place. When driven to their\r\nhiding places by bank suspensions, a little firmness in the community soon\r\nrestores them in a sufficient quantity for ordinary purposes. Postage and\r\nother public dues have been collected in coin without serious inconvenience\r\neven in States where a depreciated paper currency has existed for years,\r\nand this, with the aid of Treasury notes for a part of the time, was done\r\nwithout interruption during the suspension of 1837. At the present moment\r\nthe receipts and disbursements of the Government are made in legal currency\r\nin the largest portion of the Union. No one suggests a departure from this\r\nrule, and if it can now be successfully carried out it will be surely\r\nattended with even less difficulty when bank notes are again redeemed in\r\nspecie.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I can not think that a serious objection would anywhere be raised\r\nto the receipt and payment of gold and silver in all public transactions\r\nwere it not from an apprehension that a surplus in the Treasury might\r\nwithdraw a large portion of it from circulation and lock it up unprofitably\r\nin the public vaults. It would not, in my opinion, be difficult to prevent\r\nsuch an inconvenience from occurring; but the authentic statements which I\r\nhave already submitted to you in regard to the actual amount in the public\r\nTreasury at any one time during the period embraced in them and the little\r\nprobability of a different state of the Treasury for at least some years to\r\ncome seem to render it unnecessary to dwell upon it. Congress, moreover, as\r\nI have before observed, will in every year have an opportunity to guard\r\nagainst it should the occurrence of any circumstances lead us to apprehend\r\ninjury from this source. Viewing the subject in all its aspects, I can not\r\nbelieve that any period will be more auspicious than the present for the\r\nadoption of all measures necessary to maintain the sanctity of our own\r\nengagements and to aid in securing to the community that abundant supply of\r\nthe precious metals which adds so much to their prosperity and gives such\r\nincreased stability to all their dealings.\r\n\r\nIn a country so commercial as ours banks in some form will probably always\r\nexist, but this serves only to render it the more incumbent on us,\r\nnotwithstanding the discouragements of the past, to strive in our\r\nrespective stations to mitigate the evils they produce; to take from them\r\nas rapidly as the obligations of public faith and a careful consideration\r\nof the immediate interests of the community will permit the unjust\r\ncharacter of monopolies; to check, so far as may be practicable, by prudent\r\nlegislation those temptations of interest and those opportunities for their\r\ndangerous indulgence which beset them on every side, and to confine them\r\nstrictly to the performance of their paramount duty--that of aiding the\r\noperations of commerce rather than consulting their own exclusive\r\nadvantage. These and other salutary reforms may, it is believed, be\r\naccomplished without the violation of any of the great principles of the\r\nsocial compact, the observance of which is indispensable to its existence,\r\nor interfering in any way with the useful and profitable employment of real\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nInstitutions so framed have existed and still exist elsewhere, giving to\r\ncommercial intercourse all necessary facilities without inflating or\r\ndepreciating the currency or stimulating speculation. Thus accomplishing\r\ntheir legitimate ends, they have gained the surest guaranty for their\r\nprotection and encouragement in the good will of the community. Among a\r\npeople so just as ours the same results could not fail to attend a similar\r\ncourse. The direct supervision of the banks belongs, from the nature of our\r\nGovernment, to the States who authorize them. It is to their legislatures\r\nthat the people must mainly look for action on that subject. But as the\r\nconduct of the Federal Government in the management of its revenue has also\r\na powerful, though less immediate, influence upon them, it becomes our duty\r\nto see that a proper direction is given to it. While the keeping of the\r\npublic revenue in a separate and independent treasury and of collecting it\r\nin gold and silver will have a salutary influence on the system of paper\r\ncredit with which all banks are connected, and thus aid those that are\r\nsound and well managed, it will at the same time sensibly check such as are\r\notherwise by at once withholding the means of extravagance afforded by the\r\npublic funds and restraining them from excessive issues of notes which they\r\nwould be constantly called upon to redeem.\r\n\r\nI am aware it has been urged that this control may be best attained and\r\nexerted by means of a national bank. The constitutional objections which I\r\nam well known to entertain would prevent me in any event from proposing or\r\nassenting to that remedy; but in addition to this, I can not after past\r\nexperience bring myself to think that it can any longer be extensively\r\nregarded as effective for such a purpose. The history of the late national\r\nbank, through all its mutations, shows that it was not so. On the contrary,\r\nit may, after a careful consideration of the subject, be, I think, safely\r\nstated that at every period of banking excess it took the lead; that in\r\n1817 and 1818, in 1823, in 1831, and in 1834 its vast expansions, followed\r\nby distressing contractions, led to those of the State institutions. It\r\nswelled and maddened the tides of the banking system, but seldom allayed or\r\nsafely directed them. At a few periods only was a salutary control\r\nexercised, but an eager desire, on the contrary, exhibited for profit in\r\nthe first place; and if afterwards its measures were severe toward other\r\ninstitutions, it was because its own safety compelled it to adopt them. It\r\ndid not differ from them in principle or in form; its measures emanated\r\nfrom the same spirit of gain; it felt the same temptation to overissues; it\r\nsuffered from and was totally unable to avert those inevitable laws of\r\ntrade by which it was itself affected equally with them; and at least on\r\none occasion, at an early day, it was saved only by extraordinary exertions\r\nfrom the same fate that attended the weakest institution it professed to\r\nsupervise. In 1837 it failed equally with others in redeeming its notes\r\n(though the two years allowed by its charter for that purpose had not\r\nexpired), a large amount of which remains to the present time outstanding.\r\nIt is true that, having so vast a capital and strengthened by the use of\r\nall the revenues of the Government, it possessed more power; but while it\r\nwas itself by that circumstance freed from the control which all banks\r\nrequire, its paramount object and inducement were left the same--to make\r\nthe most for its stockholders, not to regulate the currency of the country.\r\nNor has it, as far as we are advised, been found to be greatly otherwise\r\nelsewhere. The national character given to the Bank of England has not\r\nprevented excessive fluctuations in their currency, and it proved unable to\r\nkeep off a suspension of specie payments, which lasted for nearly a quarter\r\nof a century. And why should we expect it to be otherwise? A national\r\ninstitution, though deriving its charter from a different source than the\r\nState banks, is yet constituted upon the same principles, is conducted by\r\nmen equally exposed to temptation, and is liable to the same disasters,\r\nwith the additional disadvantage that its magnitude occasions an extent of\r\nconfusion and distress which the mismanagement of smaller institutions\r\ncould not produce. It can scarcely be doubted that the recent suspension of\r\nthe United State Bank of Pennsylvania, of which the effects are felt not in\r\nthat State alone, but over half the Union, had its origin in a course of\r\nbusiness commenced while it was a national institution, and there is no\r\ngood reason for supposing that the same consequences would not have\r\nfollowed had it still derived its powers from the General Government. It is\r\nin vain, when the influences and impulses are the same, to look for a\r\ndifference in conduct or results. By such creations we do, therefore, but\r\nincrease the mass of paper credit and paper currency, without checking\r\ntheir attendant evils and fluctuations. The extent of power and the\r\nefficiency of organization which we give, so far from being beneficial, are\r\nin practice positively injurious. They strengthen the chain of dependence\r\nthroughout the Union, subject all parts more certainly to common disaster,\r\nand bind every bank more effectually in the first instance to those of our\r\ncommercial cities, and in the end to a foreign power. In a word, I can not\r\nbut believe that, with the full understanding of the operations of our\r\nbanking system which experience has produced, public sentiment is not less\r\nopposed to the creation of a national bank for purposes connected with\r\ncurrency and commerce than for those connected with the fiscal operations\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nYet the commerce and currency of the country are suffering evils from the\r\noperations of the State banks which can not and ought not to be overlooked.\r\nBy their means we have been flooded with a depreciated paper, which it was\r\nevidently the design of the framers of the Constitution to prevent when\r\nthey required Congress to \"Coin money and regulate the value of foreign\r\ncoins,\" and when they forbade the States \"to coin money, emit bills of\r\ncredit, make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts,\" or\r\n\"pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\" If they did not guard\r\nmore explicitly against the present state of things, it was because they\r\ncould not have anticipated that the few banks then existing were to swell\r\nto an extent which would expel to so great a degree the gold and silver for\r\nwhich they had provided from the channels of circulation, and fill them\r\nwith a currency that defeats the objects they had in view. The remedy for\r\nthis must chiefly rest with the States from whose legislation it has\r\nsprung. No good that might accrue in a particular case front the exercise\r\nof powers not obviously conferred on the General Government would authorize\r\nits interference or justify a course that might in the slightest degree\r\nincrease at the expense of the States the power of the Federal authorities;\r\nnor do I doubt that the States will apply the remedy. Within the last few\r\nyears events have appealed to them too strongly to be disregarded. They\r\nhave seen that the Constitution, though theoretically adhered to, is\r\nsubverted in practice; that while on the statute books there is no legal\r\ntender but gold and silver, no law impairing the obligations of contracts,\r\nyet that in point of fact the privileges conferred on banking corporations\r\nhave made their notes the currency of the country; that the obligations\r\nimposed by these notes are violated under the impulses of interest or\r\nconvenience, and that the number and power of the persons connected with\r\nthese corporations or placed under their influence give them a fearful\r\nweight when their interest is in opposition to the spirit of the\r\nConstitution and laws. To the people it is immaterial whether these results\r\nare produced by open violations of the latter or by the workings of a\r\nsystem of which the result is the same. An inflexible execution even of the\r\nexisting statutes of most of the States would redress many evils now\r\nendured, would effectually show the banks the dangers of mismanagement\r\nwhich impunity encourages them to repeat, and would teach all corporations\r\nthe useful lesson that they are the subjects of the law and the servants of\r\nthe people. What is still wanting to effect these objects must be sought in\r\nadditional legislation, or, if that be inadequate, in such further\r\nconstitutional grants or restrictions as may bring us back into the path\r\nfrom which we have so widely wandered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is the duty of the General Government to cooperate with\r\nthe States by a wise exercise of its constitutional powers and the\r\nenforcement of its existing laws. The extent to which it may do so by\r\nfurther enactments I have already adverted to, and the wisdom of Congress\r\nmay yet enlarge them. But above all, it is incumbent upon us to hold erect\r\nthe principles of morality and law, constantly executing our own contracts\r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and thus serving as\r\na rallying point by which our whole country may be brought back to that\r\nsafe and honored standard.\r\n\r\nOur people will not long be insensible to the extent of the burdens\r\nentailed upon them by the false system that has been operating on their\r\nsanguine, energetic, and industrious character, nor to the means necessary\r\nto extricate themselves from these embarrassments. The weight which presses\r\nupon a large portion of the people and the States is an enormous debt,\r\nforeign and domestic. The foreign debt of our States, corporations, and men\r\nof business can scarcely be less than $200,000,000, requiring more than\r\n$10,000,000 a year to pay the interest. This sum has to be paid out of the\r\nexports of the country, and must of necessity cut off imports to that\r\nextent or plunge the country more deeply in debt from year to year. It is\r\neasy to see that the increase of this foreign debt must augment the annual\r\ndemand on the exports to pay the interest, and to the same extent diminish\r\nthe imports, and in proportion to the enlargement of the foreign debt and\r\nthe consequent increase of interest must be the decrease of the import\r\ntrade. In lieu of the comforts which it now brings us we might have our.\r\ngigantic banking institutions and splendid, but in many instances\r\nprofitless, railroads and canals absorbing to a great extent in interest\r\nupon the capital borrowed to construct them the surplus fruits of national\r\nindustry for years to come, and securing to posterity no adequate return\r\nfor the comforts which the labors of their hands might otherwise have\r\nsecured. It is not by the increase of this debt that relief is to be\r\nsought, but in its diminution. Upon this point there is, I am happy to say,\r\nhope before us; not so much in the return of confidence abroad, which will\r\nenable the States to borrow more money, as in a change of public feeling at\r\nhome, which prompts our people to pause in their career and think of the\r\nmeans by which debts are to be paid before they are contracted. If we would\r\nescape embarrassment, public and private, we must cease to run in debt\r\nexcept for objects of necessity or such as will yield a certain return. Let\r\nthe faith of the States, corporations, and individuals already pledged be\r\nkept with the most punctilious regard. It is due to our national character\r\nas well as to justice that this should on the part of each be a fixed\r\nprinciple of conduct. But it behooves us all to be more chary in pledging\r\nit hereafter. By ceasing to run in debt and applying the surplus of our\r\ncrops and incomes to the discharge of existing obligations, buying less and\r\nselling more, and managing all affairs, public and private, with strict\r\neconomy and frugality, we shall see our country soon recover from a\r\ntemporary depression, arising not from natural and permanent causes, but\r\nfrom those I have enumerated, and advance with renewed vigor in her career\r\nof prosperity.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us at this moment, when the balance of trade is greatly\r\nagainst us and the difficulty of meeting it enhanced by the disturbed state\r\nof our money affairs, the bounties of Providence have come to relieve us\r\nfrom the consequences of past errors. A faithful application of the immense\r\nresults of the labors of the last season will afford partial relief for the\r\npresent, and perseverance in the same course will in due season accomplish\r\nthe rest. We have had full experience in times past of the extraordinary\r\nresults which can in this respect be brought about in a short period by the\r\nunited and well-directed efforts of a community like ours. Our surplus\r\nprofits, the energy and industry of our population, and the wonderful\r\nadvantages which Providence has bestowed upon our country in its climate,\r\nits various productions, indispensable to other nations, will in due time\r\nafford abundant means to perfect the most useful of those objects for which\r\nthe States have been plunging themselves of late in embarrassment and debt,\r\nwithout imposing on ourselves or our children such fearful burdens.\r\n\r\nBut let it be indelibly engraved on our minds that relief is not to be\r\nfound in expedients. Indebtedness can not be lessened by borrowing more\r\nmoney or by changing the form of the debt. The balance of trade is not to\r\nbe turned in our favor by creating new demands upon us abroad. Our currency\r\ncan not be improved by the creation of new banks or more issues from those\r\nwhich now exist. Although these devices sometimes appear to give temporary\r\nrelief, they almost invariably aggravate the evil in the end. It is only by\r\nretrenchment and reform--by curtailing public and private expenditures, by\r\npaying our debts, and by reforming our banking system--that we are to\r\nexpect effectual relief, security for the future, and an enduring\r\nprosperity. In shaping the institutions and policy of the General\r\nGovernment so as to promote as far as it can with its limited powers these\r\nimportant ends, you may rely on my most cordial cooperation.\r\n\r\nThat there should have been in the progress of recent events doubts in many\r\nquarters and in some a heated opposition to every change can not surprise\r\nus. Doubts are properly attendant on all reform, and it is peculiarly in\r\nthe nature of such abuses as we are now encountering to seek to perpetuate\r\ntheir power by means of the influence they have been permitted to acquire.\r\nIt is their result, if not their object, to gain for the few an ascendency\r\nover the many by securing to them a monopoly of the currency, the medium\r\nthrough which most of the wants of mankind are supplied; to produce\r\nthroughout society a chain of dependence which leads all classes to look to\r\nprivileged associations for the means of speculation and extravagance; to\r\nnourish, in preference to the manly virtues that give dignity to human\r\nnature, a craving desire for luxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth, which\r\nrenders those who seek them dependent on those who supply them; to\r\nsubstitute for republican simplicity and economical habits a sickly\r\nappetite for effeminate indulgence and an imitation of that reckless\r\nextravagance which impoverished and enslaved the industrious people of\r\nforeign lands, and at last to fix upon us, instead of those equal political\r\nrights the acquisition of which was alike the object and supposed reward of\r\nour Revolutionary struggle, a system of exclusive privileges conferred by\r\npartial legislation. To remove the influences which had thus gradually\r\ngrown up among us, to deprive them of their deceptive advantages, to test\r\nthem by the light of wisdom and truth, to oppose the force which they\r\nconcentrate in their sup-port--all this was necessarily the work of time,\r\neven among a people so enlightened and pure as that of the United States.\r\nIn most other countries, perhaps, it could only be accomplished through\r\nthat series of revolutionary movements which are too often found necessary\r\nto effect any great and radical reform; but it is the crowning merit of our\r\ninstitutions that they create and nourish in the vast majority of our\r\npeople a disposition and a power peaceably to remedy abuses which have\r\nelsewhere caused the effusion of rivers of blood and the sacrifice of\r\nthousands of the human race. The result thus far is most honorable to the\r\nself-denial, the intelligence, and the patriotism of our citizens; it\r\njustifies the confident hope that they will carry through the reform which\r\nhas been so well begun, and that they will go still further than they have\r\nyet gone in illustrating the important truth that a people as free and\r\nenlightened as ours will, whenever it becomes necessary, show themselves to\r\nbe indeed capable of self-government by voluntarily adopting appropriate\r\nremedies for every abuse, and submitting to temporary sacrifices, however\r\ngreat, to insure their permanent welfare.\r\n\r\nMy own exertions for the furtherance of these desirable objects have been\r\nbestowed throughout my official career with a zeal that is nourished by\r\nardent wishes for the welfare of my country, and by an unlimited reliance\r\non the wisdom that marks its ultimate decision on all great and\r\ncontroverted questions. Impressed with the solemn obligations imposed upon\r\nme by the Constitution, desirous also of laying before my fellow-citizens,\r\nwith whose confidence and support I have been so highly honored, such\r\nmeasures as appear to me conducive to their prosperity, and anxious to\r\nsubmit to their fullest consideration the grounds upon which my opinions\r\nare formed, I have on this as on preceding occasions freely offered my\r\nviews on those points of domestic policy that seem at the present time most\r\nprominently to require the action of the Government. I know that they will\r\nreceive from Congress that full and able consideration which the importance\r\nof the subjects merits, and I can repeat the assurance heretofore made that\r\nI shall cheerfully and readily cooperate with you in every measure that\r\nwill tend to promote the welfare of the Union.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nMartin van Buren\r\nDecember 5, 1840\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nOur devout gratitude is due to the Supreme Being for having graciously\r\ncontinued to our beloved country through the vicissitudes of another year\r\nthe invaluable blessings of health, plenty, and peace. Seldom has this\r\nfavored land been so generally exempted from the ravages of disease or the\r\nlabor of the husbandman more amply rewarded, and never before have our\r\nrelations with other countries been placed on a more favorable basis than\r\nthat which they so happily occupy at this critical conjuncture in the\r\naffairs of the world. A rigid and persevering abstinence from all\r\ninterference with the domestic and political relations of other States,\r\nalike due to the genius and distinctive character of our Government and to\r\nthe principles by which it is directed; a faithful observance in the\r\nmanagement of our foreign relations of the practice of speaking plainly,\r\ndealing justly, and requiring truth and justice in return as the best\r\nconservatives of the peace of nations; a strict impartiality in our\r\nmanifestations of friendship in the commercial privileges we concede and\r\nthose we require from others--these, accompanied by a disposition as prompt\r\nto maintain in every emergency our own rights as we are from principle\r\naverse to the invasion of those of others, have given to our country and\r\nGovernment a standing in the great family of nations of which we have just\r\ncause to be proud and the advantages of which are experienced by our\r\ncitizens throughout every portion of the earth to which their enterprising\r\nand adventurous spirit may carry them. Few, if any, remain insensible to\r\nthe value of our friendship or ignorant of the terms on which it can be\r\nacquired and by which it can alone be preserved.\r\n\r\nA series of questions of long standing, difficult in their adjustment and\r\nimportant in their consequences, in which the rights of our citizens and\r\nthe honor of the country were deeply involved, have in the course of a few\r\nyears (the most of them during the successful Administration of my\r\nimmediate predecessor) been brought to a satisfactory conclusion; and the\r\nmost important of those remaining are, I am happy to believe, in a fair way\r\nof being speedily and satisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\nWith all the powers of the world our relations are those of honorable\r\npeace. Since your adjournment nothing serious has occurred to interrupt or\r\nthreaten this desirable harmony. If clouds have lowered above the other\r\nhemisphere, they have not cast their portentous shadows upon our happy\r\nshores. Bound by no entangling alliances, yet linked by a common nature and\r\ninterest with the other nations of mankind, our aspirations are for the\r\npreservation of peace, in whose solid and civilizing triumphs all may\r\nparticipate with a generous emulation. Yet it behooves us to be prepared\r\nfor any event and to be always ready to maintain those just and enlightened\r\nprinciples of national intercourse for which this Government has ever\r\ncontended. In the shock of contending empires it is only by assuming a\r\nresolute bearing and clothing themselves with defensive armor that neutral\r\nnations can maintain their independent rights.\r\n\r\nThe excitement which grew out of the territorial controversy between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain having in a great measure subsided, it is\r\nhoped that a favorable period is approaching for its final settlement. Both\r\nGovernments must now be convinced of the dangers with which the question is\r\nfraught, and it must be their desire, as it is their interest, that this\r\nperpetual cause of irritation should be removed as speedily as practicable.\r\nIn my last annual message you were informed that the proposition for a\r\ncommission of exploration and survey promised by Great Britain had been\r\nreceived, and that a counter project, including also a provision for the\r\ncertain and final adjustment of the limits in dispute, was then before the\r\nBritish Government for its consideration. The answer of that Government,\r\naccompanied by additional propositions of its own, was received through its\r\nminister here since your separation. These were promptly considered, such\r\nas were deemed correct in principle and consistent with a due regard to the\r\njust rights of the United States and of the State of Maine concurred in,\r\nand the reasons for dissenting from the residue, with an additional\r\nsuggestion on our part, communicated by the Secretary of State to Mr. Fox.\r\nThat minister, not feeling himself sufficiently instructed upon some of the\r\npoints raised in the discussion, felt it to be his duty to refer the matter\r\nto his own Government for its further decision. Having now been for some\r\ntime under its advisement, a speedy answer may be confidently expected.\r\nFrom the character of the points still in difference and the undoubted\r\ndisposition of both parties to bring the matter to an early conclusion, I\r\nlook with entire confidence to a prompt and satisfactory termination of the\r\nnegotiation. Three commissioners were appointed shortly after the\r\nadjournment of Congress under the act of the last session providing for the\r\nexploration and survey of the line which separates the States of Maine and\r\nNew Hampshire from the British Provinces. They have been actively employed\r\nuntil their progress was interrupted by the inclemency of the season, and\r\nwill resume their labors as soon as practicable in the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that their respective examinations will throw new light\r\nupon the subject in controversy and serve to remove any erroneous\r\nimpressions which may have been made elsewhere prejudicial to the rights of\r\nthe United States. It was, among other reasons, with a view of preventing\r\nthe embarrassments which in our peculiar system of government impede and\r\ncomplicate negotiations involving the territorial rights of a State that I\r\nthought it my duty, as you have been informed on a previous occasion, to\r\npropose to the British Government, through its minister at Washington, that\r\nearly steps should be taken to adjust the points of difference on the line\r\nof boundary from the entrance of Lake Superior to the most northwestern\r\npoint of the Lake of the Woods by the arbitration of a friendly power in\r\nconformity with the seventh article of the treaty of Ghent. No answer has\r\nyet been returned by the British Government to this proposition.\r\n\r\nWith Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the remaining powers of Europe I\r\nam happy to inform you our relations continue to be of the most friendly\r\ncharacter. With Belgium a treaty of commerce and navigation, based upon\r\nliberal principles of reciprocity and equality, was concluded in March\r\nlast, and, having been ratified by the Belgian Government, will be duly\r\nlaid before the Senate. It is a subject of congratulation that it provides\r\nfor the satisfactory adjustment of a long-standing question of controversy,\r\nthus removing the only obstacle which could obstruct the friendly and\r\nmutually advantageous intercourse between the two nations. A messenger has\r\nbeen dispatched with the Hanoverian treaty to Berlin, where, according to\r\nstipulation, the ratifications are to be exchanged. I am happy to announce\r\nto you that after many delays and difficulties a treaty of commerce and\r\nnavigation between the United States and Portugal was concluded and signed\r\nat Lisbon on the 26th of August last by the plenipotentiaries of the two\r\nGovernments. Its stipulations are founded upon those principles of mutual\r\nliberality and advantage which the United States have always sought to make\r\nthe basis of their intercourse with foreign powers, and it is hoped they\r\nwill tend to foster and strengthen the commercial intercourse of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation of the last session of Congress an agent has been\r\nsent to Germany for the purpose of promoting the interests of our tobacco\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed under the convention for the adjustment of\r\nclaims of citizens of the United States upon Mexico having met and\r\norganized at Washington in August last, the papers in the possession of the\r\nGovernment relating to those claims were communicated to the board. The\r\nclaims not embraced by that convention are now the subject of negotiation\r\nbetween the two Governments through the medium of our minister at Mexico.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred to disturb the harmony of our relations with the\r\ndifferent Governments of South America. I regret, however, to be obliged to\r\ninform you that the claims of our citizens upon the late Republic of\r\nColombia have not yet been satisfied by the separate Governments into which\r\nit has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThe charge d'affaires of Brazil having expressed the intention of his\r\nGovernment not to prolong the treaty of 1828, it will cease to be\r\nobligatory upon either party on the 12th day of December, 1841, when the\r\nextensive commercial intercourse between the United States and that vast\r\nEmpire will no longer be regulated by express stipulations.\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to communicate to you that the Government of Chili\r\nhas entered into an agreement to indemnify the claimants in the case of the\r\nMacectonian for American property seized in 1819, and to add that\r\ninformation has also been received which justifies the hope of an early\r\nadjustment of the remaining claims upon that Government.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the convention between the\r\nUnited States and Texas for marking the boundary between them have,\r\naccording to the last report received from our commissioner, surveyed and\r\nestablished the whole extent of the boundary north along the western bank\r\nof the Sabine River from its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico to the\r\nthirty-second degree of north latitude. The commission adjourned on the\r\n16th of June last, to reassemble on the 1st of November for the purpose of\r\nestablishing accurately the intersection of the thirty-second degree of\r\nlatitude with the western bank of the Sabine and the meridian line thence\r\nto Red River. It is presumed that the work will be concluded in the present\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe present sound condition of their finances and the success with which\r\nembarrassments in regard to them, at times apparently insurmountable, have\r\nbeen overcome are matters upon which the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States may well congratulate themselves. An overflowing Treasury,\r\nhowever it may be regarded as an evidence of public prosperity, is seldom\r\nconducive to the permanent welfare of any people, and experience has\r\ndemonstrated its incompatibility with the salutary action of political\r\ninstitutions like those of the United States. Our safest reliance for\r\nfinancial efficiency and independence has, on the contrary, been found to\r\nconsist in ample resources unencumbered with debt, and in this respect the\r\nFederal Government occupies a singularly fortunate and truly enviable\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon the discharge of my official duties in March, 1837, the\r\nact for the distribution of the surplus revenue was in a course of rapid\r\nexecution. Nearly $28,000,000 of the public moneys were, in pursuance of\r\nits provisions, deposited with the States in the months of January, April,\r\nand July of that year. In May there occurred a general suspension of specie\r\npayments by the banks, including, with very few exceptions, those in which\r\nthe public moneys were deposited and upon whose fidelity the Government had\r\nunfortunately made itself dependent for the revenues which had been\r\ncollected from the people and were indispensable to the public service.\r\n\r\nThis suspension and the excesses in banking and commerce out of which it\r\narose, and which were greatly aggravated by its occurrence, made to a great\r\nextent unavailable the principal part of the public money then on hand,\r\nsuspended the collection of many millions accruing on merchants' bonds, and\r\ngreatly reduced the revenue arising from customs and the public lands.\r\nThese effects have continued to operate in various degrees to the present\r\nperiod, and in addition to the decrease in the revenue thus produced two\r\nand a half millions of duties have been relinquished by two biennial\r\nreductions under the act of 1833, and probably as much more upon the\r\nimportation of iron for railroads by special legislation.\r\n\r\nWhilst such has been our condition for the last four years in relation to\r\nrevenue, we have during the same period been subjected to an unavoidable\r\ncontinuance of large extraordinary expenses necessarily growing out of past\r\ntransactions, and which could not be immediately arrested without great\r\nprejudice to the public interest. Of these, the charge upon the Treasurer\r\nin consequence of the Cherokee treaty alone, without adverting to others\r\narising out of Indian treaties, has already exceeded $5,000,000; that for\r\nthe prosecution of measures for the removal of the Seminole Indians, which\r\nwere found in progress, has been nearly fourteen millions, and the public\r\nbuildings have required the unusual sum of nearly three millions.\r\n\r\nIt affords me, however, great pleasure to be able to say that from the\r\ncommencement of this period to the present day every demand upon the\r\nGovernment, at home or abroad, has been promptly met. This has been done\r\nnot only without creating a permanent debt or a resort to additional\r\ntaxation in any form, but in the midst of a steadily progressive reduction\r\nof existing burdens upon the people, leaving still a considerable balance\r\nof available funds which will remain in the Treasury at the end of the\r\nyear. The small amount of Treasury notes, not exceeding $4,500,000, still\r\noutstanding, and less by twenty-three millions than the United States have\r\nin deposit with the States, is composed of such only as are not yet due or\r\nhave not been presented for payment. They may be redeemed out of the\r\naccruing revenue if the expenditures do not exceed the amount within which\r\nthey may, it is thought, be kept without prejudice to the public interest,\r\nand the revenue shall prove to be as large as may justly be anticipated.\r\n\r\nAmong the reflections arising from the contemplation of these\r\ncircumstances, one, not the least gratifying, is the consciousness that the\r\nGovernment had the resolution and the ability to adhere in every emergency\r\nto the sacred obligations of law, to execute all its contracts according to\r\nthe requirements of the Constitution, and thus to present when most needed\r\na rallying point by which the business of the whole country might be\r\nbrought back to a safe and unvarying standard--a result vitally important\r\nas well to the interests as to the morals of the people. There can surely\r\nnow be no difference of opinion in regard to the incalculable evils that\r\nwould have arisen if the Government at that critical moment had suffered\r\nitself to be deterred from upholding the only true standard of value,\r\neither by the pressure of adverse circumstances or the violence of\r\nunmerited denunciation. The manner in which the people sustained the\r\nperformance of this duty was highly honorable to their fortitude and\r\npatriotism. It can not fail to stimulate their agents to adhere under all\r\ncircumstances to the line of duty and to satisfy them of the safety with\r\nwhich a course really right and demanded by a financial crisis may in a\r\ncommunity like ours be pursued, however apparently severe its immediate\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Federal Government in extinguishing as rapidly as\r\npossible the national debt, and subsequently in resisting every temptation\r\nto create a new one, deserves to be regarded in the same favorable light.\r\nAmong the many objections to a national debt, the certain tendency of\r\npublic securities to concentrate ultimately in the coffers of foreign\r\nstockholders is one which is every day gathering strength. Already have the\r\nresources of many of the States and the future industry of their citizens\r\nbeen indefinitely mortgaged to the subjects of European Governments to the\r\namount of twelve millions annually to pay the constantly accruing interest\r\non borrowed money--a sum exceeding half the ordinary revenues of the whole\r\nUnited States. The pretext which this relation affords to foreigners to\r\nscrutinize the management of our domestic affairs, if not actually to\r\nintermeddle with them, presents a subject for earnest attention, not to say\r\nof serious alarm. Fortunately, the Federal Government, with the exception\r\nof an obligation entered into in behalf of the District of Columbia, which\r\nmust soon be discharged, is wholly exempt from any such embarrassment. It\r\nis also, as is believed, the only Government which, having fully and\r\nfaithfully paid all its creditors, has also relieved itself entirely from\r\ndebt. To maintain a distinction so desirable and so honorable to our\r\nnational character should be an object of earnest solicitude. Never should\r\na free people, if it be possible to avoid it, expose themselves to the\r\nnecessity of having to treat of the peace, the honor, or the safety of the\r\nRepublic with the governments of foreign creditors, who, however well\r\ndisposed they may be to cultivate with us in general friendly relations,\r\nare nevertheless by the law of their own condition made hostile to the\r\nsuccess and permanency of political institutions like ours. Most\r\nhumiliating may be the embarrassments consequent upon such a condition.\r\nAnother objection, scarcely less formidable, to the commencement of a new\r\ndebt is its inevitable tendency to increase in magnitude and to foster\r\nnational extravagance. He has been an unprofitable observer of events who\r\nneeds at this day to be admonished of the difficulties which a government\r\nhabitually dependent on loans to sustain its ordinary expenditures has to\r\nencounter in resisting the influences constantly exerted in favor of\r\nadditional loans; by capitalists, who enrich themselves by government\r\nsecurities for amounts much exceeding the money they actually advance--a\r\nprolific source of individual aggrandizement in all borrowing countries; by\r\nstockholders, who seek their gains in the rise and fall of public stocks;\r\nand by the selfish importunities of applicants for appropriations for works\r\navowedly for the accommodation of the public, but the real objects of which\r\nare too frequently the advancement of private interests. The known\r\nnecessity which so many of the States will be under to impose taxes for the\r\npayment of the interest on their debts furnishes an additional and very\r\ncogent reason why the Federal Governments should refrain from creating a\r\nnational debt, by which the people would be exposed to double taxation for\r\na similar object. We possess within ourselves ample resources for every\r\nemergency, and we may be quite sure that our citizens in no future exigency\r\nwill be unwilling to supply the Government with all the means asked for the\r\ndefense of the country. In time of peace there can, at all events, be no\r\njustification for the creation of a permanent debt by the Federal\r\nGovernment. Its limited range of constitutional duties may certainly under\r\nsuch circumstances be performed without such a resort. It has, it is seen,\r\nbeen avoided during four years of greater fiscal difficulties than have\r\nexisted in a similar period since the adoption of the Constitution, and one\r\nalso remarkable for the occurrence of extraordinary causes of\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nBut to accomplish so desirable an object two things are indispensable:\r\nFirst, that the action of the Federal Government be kept within the\r\nboundaries prescribed by its founders, and, secondly, that all\r\nappropriations for objects admitted to be constitutional, and the\r\nexpenditure of them also, be subjected to a standard of rigid but\r\nwell-considered and practical economy. The first depends chiefly on the\r\npeople themselves--the opinions they form of the true construction of the\r\nConstitution and the confidence they repose in the political sentiments of\r\nthose they select as their representatives in the Federal Legislature; the\r\nsecond rests upon the fidelity with which their more immediate\r\nrepresentatives and other public functionaries discharge the trusts\r\ncommitted to them. The duty of economizing the expenses of the public\r\nservice is admitted on all hands; yet there are few subjects upon which\r\nthere exists a wider difference of opinion than is constantly manifested in\r\nregard to the fidelity with which that duty is discharged. Neither\r\ndiversity of sentiment nor even mutual recriminations upon a point in\r\nrespect to which the public mind is so justly sensitive can well be\r\nentirely avoided, and least so at periods of great political excitement. An\r\nintelligent people, however, seldom fail to arrive in the end at correct\r\nconclusions in such a matter. Practical economy in the management of public\r\naffairs can have no adverse influence to contend with more powerful than a\r\nlarge surplus revenue, and the unusually large appropriations for 1837 may\r\nwithout doubt, independently of the extraordinary requisitions for the\r\npublic service growing out of the state of our Indian relations, be in no\r\ninconsiderable degree traced to this source. The sudden and rapid\r\ndistribution of the large surplus then in the Treasury and the equally\r\nsudden and unprecedentedly severe revulsion in the commerce and business of\r\nthe country, pointing with unerring certainty to a great and protracted\r\nreduction of the revenue, strengthened the propriety of the earliest\r\npracticable reduction of the public expenditures.\r\n\r\nBut to change a system operating upon so large a surface and applicable to\r\nsuch numerous and diversified interests and objects was more than the work\r\nof a day. The attention of every department of the Government was\r\nimmediately and in good faith directed to that end, and has been so\r\ncontinued to the present moment. The estimates and appropriations for the\r\nyear 1838 (the first over which I had any control) were somewhat\r\ndiminished. The expenditures of 1839 were reduced $6,000,000. Those of\r\n1840, exclusive of disbursements for public debt and trust claims, will\r\nprobably not exceed twenty-two and a half millions, being between two and\r\nthree millions less than those of the preceding year and nine or ten\r\nmillions less than those of 1837. Nor has it been found necessary in order\r\nto produce this result to resort to the power conferred by Congress of\r\npostponing certain classes of the public works, except by deferring\r\nexpenditures for a short period upon a limited portion of them, and which\r\npostponement terminated some time since--at the moment the Treasury\r\nDepartment by further receipts from the indebted banks became fully assured\r\nof its ability to meet them without prejudice to the public service in\r\nother respects. Causes are in operation which will, it is believed, justify\r\na still further reduction without injury to any important national\r\ninterest. The expenses of sustaining the troops employed in Florida have\r\nbeen gradually and greatly reduced through the persevering efforts of the\r\nWar Department, and a reasonable hope may be entertained that the necessity\r\nfor military operations in that quarter will soon cease. The removal of the\r\nIndians from within our settled borders is nearly completed. The pension\r\nlist, one of the heaviest charges upon the Treasury, is rapidly diminishing\r\nby death. The most costly of our public buildings are either finished or\r\nnearly so, and we may, I think, safely promise ourselves a continued\r\nexemption from border difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe available balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next is\r\nestimated at $ 1,500,000. This sum, with the expected receipts from all\r\nsources during the next year, will, it is believed, be sufficient to enable\r\nthe Government to meet every engagement and have a suitable balance, in the\r\nTreasury at the end of the year, if the remedial measures connected with\r\nthe customs and the public lands heretofore recommended are adopted and the\r\nnew appropriations by Congress shall not carry the expenditures beyond the\r\nofficial estimates.\r\n\r\nThe new system established by Congress for the safe-keeping of the public\r\nmoney, prescribing the kind of currency to be received for the public\r\nrevenue and providing additional guards and securities against losses, has\r\nnow been several mouths in operation. Although it might be premature upon\r\nan experience of such limited duration to form a definite opinion in regard\r\nto the extent of its influences in correcting many evils under which the\r\nFederal Government and the country have hitherto suffered, especially those\r\nthat have grown out of banking expansions, a depreciated currency, and\r\nofficial defalcations, yet it is but right to say that nothing has occurred\r\nin the practical operation of the system to weaken in the slightest degree,\r\nbut much to strengthen, the confident anticipations of its friends. The\r\ngrounds of these have been heretofore so fully explained as to require no\r\nrecapitulation. In respect to the facility and convenience it affords in\r\nconducting the public service, and the ability of the Government to\r\ndischarge through its agency every duty attendant on the collection,\r\ntransfer, and disbursement of the public money with promptitude and\r\nsuccess, I can say with confidence that the apprehensions of those who felt\r\nit to be their duty to oppose its adoption have proved to be unfounded. On\r\nthe contrary, this branch of the fiscal affairs of the Government has been,\r\nand it is believed may always be, thus carried on with every desirable\r\nfacility and security. A few changes and improvements in the details of the\r\nsystem, without affecting any principles involved in it, will be submitted\r\nto you by the Secretary of the Treasury, and will, I am sure, receive at\r\nyour hands that attention to which they may on examination be found to be\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\nI have deemed this brief summary of our fiscal affairs necessary to the due\r\nperformance of a duty specially enjoined upon me by the Constitution. It\r\nwill serve also to illustrate more fully the principles by which I have\r\nbeen guided in reference to two contested points in our public policy which\r\nwere earliest in their development and have been more important in their\r\nconsequences than any that have arisen under our complicated and difficult,\r\nyet admirable, system of government. I allude to a national debt and a\r\nnational bank. It was in these that the political contests by which the\r\ncountry has been agitated ever since the adoption of the Constitution in a\r\ngreat measure originated, and there is too much reason to apprehend that\r\nthe conflicting interests and opposing principles thus marshaled will\r\ncontinue as heretofore to produce similar if not aggravated consequences.\r\nComing into office the declared enemy of both, I have earnestly endeavored\r\nto prevent a resort to either.\r\n\r\nThe consideration that a large public debt affords an apology, and produces\r\nin some degree a necessity also, for resorting to a system and extent of\r\ntaxation which is not only oppressive throughout, but is likewise so apt to\r\nlead in the end to the commission of that most odious of all offenses\r\nagainst the principles of republican government, the prostitution of\r\npolitical power, conferred for the general benefit, to the aggrandizement\r\nof particular classes and the gratification of individual cupidity, is\r\nalone sufficient, independently of the weighty objections which have\r\nalready been urged, to render its creation and existence the sources of\r\nbitter and unappeasable discord. If we add to this its inevitable tendency\r\nto produce and foster extravagant expenditures of the public moneys, by\r\nwhich a necessity is created for new loans and new burdens on the people,\r\nand, finally, refer to the examples of every government which has existed\r\nfor proof, how seldom it is that the system, when once adopted and\r\nimplanted in the policy of a country, has failed to expand itself until\r\npublic credit was exhausted and the people were no longer able to endure\r\nits increasing weight, it seems impossible to resist the conclusion that no\r\nbenefits resulting from its career, no extent of conquest, no accession of\r\nwealth to particular classes, nor any nor all its combined advantages, can\r\ncounterbalance its ultimate but certain results--a splendid government and\r\nan impoverished people.\r\n\r\nIf a national bank was, as is undeniable, repudiated by the framers of the\r\nConstitution as incompatible with the rights of the States and the\r\nliberties of the people; if from the beginning it has been regarded by\r\nlarge portions of our citizens as coming in direct collision with that\r\ngreat and vital amendment of the Constitution which declares that all\r\npowers not conferred by that instrument on the General Government are\r\nreserved to the States and to the people; if it has been viewed by them as\r\nthe first great step in the march of latitudinous construction, which\r\nunchecked would render that sacred instrument of as little value as an\r\nunwritten constitution, dependent, as it would alone be, for its meaning on\r\nthe interested interpretation of a dominant party, and affording no\r\nsecurity to the rights of the minority--if such is undeniably the case,\r\nwhat rational grounds could have been conceived for anticipating aught but\r\ndetermined opposition to such an institution at the present day.\r\n\r\nCould a different result have been expected when the consequences which\r\nhave flowed from its creation, and particularly from its struggles to\r\nperpetuate its existence, had confirmed in so striking a manner the\r\napprehensions of its earliest opponents; when it had been so clearly\r\ndemonstrated that a concentrated money power, wielding so vast a capital\r\nand combining such incalculable means of influence, may in those peculiar\r\nconjunctures to which this Government is unavoidably exposed prove an\r\novermatch for the political power of the people themselves; when the true\r\ncharacter of its capacity to regulate according to its will and its\r\ninterests and the interests of its favorites the value and production of\r\nthe labor and property of every man in this extended country had been so\r\nfully and fearfully developed; when it was notorious that all classes of\r\nthis great community had, by means of the power and influence it thus\r\npossesses, been infected to madness with a spirit of heedless speculation;\r\nwhen it had been seen that, secure in the support of the combination of\r\ninfluences by which it was surrounded, it could violate its charter and set\r\nthe laws at defiance with impunity; and when, too, it had become most\r\napparent that to believe that such an accumulation of powers can ever be\r\ngranted without the certainty of being abused was to indulge in a fatal\r\ndelusion?\r\n\r\nTo avoid the necessity of a permanent debt and its inevitable consequences\r\nI have advocated and endeavored to carry into effect the policy of\r\nconfining the appropriations for the public service to such objects only as\r\nare clearly within the constitutional authority of the Federal Government;\r\nof excluding from its expenses those improvident and unauthorized grants of\r\npublic money for works of internal improvement which were so wisely\r\narrested by the constitutional interposition of my predecessor, and which,\r\nif they had not been so checked, would long before this time have involved\r\nthe finances of the General Government in embarrassments far greater than\r\nthose which are now experienced by any of the States; of limiting all our\r\nexpenditures to that simple, unostentatious, and economical administration\r\nof public affairs which is alone consistent with the character of our\r\ninstitutions; of collecting annually from the customs, and the sales of\r\npublic lands a revenue fully adequate to defray all the expenses thus\r\nincurred; but under no pretense whatsoever to impose taxes upon the people\r\nto a greater amount than was actually necessary to the public service\r\nconducted upon the principles I have stated.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a national bank or a dependence upon banks of any description\r\nfor the management of our fiscal affairs, I recommended the adoption of the\r\nsystem which is now in successful operation. That system affords every\r\nrequisite facility for the transaction of the pecuniary concerns of the\r\nGovernment; will, it is confidently anticipated, produce in other respects\r\nmany of the benefits which have been from time to time expected from the\r\ncreation of a national bank, but which have never been realized; avoid the\r\nmanifold evils inseparable from such an institution; diminish to a greater\r\nextent than could be accomplished by any other measure of reform the\r\npatronage of the Federal Government--a wise policy in all governments, but\r\nmore especially so in one like ours, which works well only in proportion as\r\nit is made to rely for its support upon the unbiased and unadulterated\r\nopinions of its constituents; do away forever all dependence on corporate\r\nbodies either in the raising, collecting, safekeeping, or disbursing the\r\npublic revenues, and place the Government equally above the temptation of\r\nfostering a dangerous and unconstitutional institution at home or the\r\nnecessity of adapting its policy to the views and interests of a still more\r\nformidable money power abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is by adopting and carrying out these principles under circumstances the\r\nmost arduous and discouraging that the attempt has been made, thus far\r\nsuccessfully, to demonstrate to the people of the United States that a\r\nnational bank at all times, and a national debt except it be incurred at a\r\nperiod when the honor and safety of the nation demand the temporary\r\nsacrifice of a policy which should only be abandoned in such exigencies,\r\nare not merely unnecessary, but in direct and deadly hostility to the\r\nprinciples of their Government and to their own permanent welfare.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in the development of these positions appears in the\r\npreceding sketch of the past history and present state of the financial\r\nconcerns of the Federal Government. The facts there stated fully authorize\r\nthe assertion that all the purposes for which this Government was\r\ninstituted have been accomplished during four years of greater pecuniary\r\nembarrassment than were ever before experienced in time of peace, and in\r\nthe face of opposition as formidable as any that was ever before arrayed\r\nagainst the policy of an Administration; that this has been done when the\r\nordinary revenues of the Government were generally decreasing as well from\r\nthe operation of the laws as the condition of the country, without the\r\ncreation of a permanent public debt or incurring any liability other than\r\nsuch as the ordinary resources of the Government will speedily discharge,\r\nand without the agency of a national bank.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the proceedings of the Government for the period it\r\nembraces be warranted by the facts as they are known to exist; if the Army\r\nand Navy have been sustained to the full extent authorized by law, and\r\nwhich Congress deemed sufficient for the defense of the country and the\r\nprotection of its rights and its honor; if its civil and diplomatic service\r\nhas been equally sustained; if ample provision has been made for the\r\nadministration of justice and the execution of the laws; if the claims upon\r\npublic gratitude in behalf of the soldiers of the Revolution have been\r\npromptly met and faithfully discharged; if there have been no failures in\r\ndefraying the very large expenditures growing out of that long-continued\r\nand salutary policy of peacefully removing the Indians to regions of\r\ncomparative safety and prosperity; if the public faith has at all times and\r\neverywhere been most scrupulously maintained by a prompt discharge of the\r\nnumerous, extended, and diversified claims on the Treasury--if all these\r\ngreat and permanent objects, with many others that might be stated, have\r\nfor a series of years, marked by peculiar obstacles and difficulties, been\r\nsuccessfully accomplished without a resort to a permanent debt or the aid\r\nof a national bank, have we not a right to expect that a policy the object\r\nof which has been to sustain the public service independently of either of\r\nthese fruitful sources of discord will receive the final sanction of a\r\npeople whose unbiased and fairly elicited judgment upon public affairs is\r\nnever ultimately wrong?\r\n\r\nThat embarrassments in the pecuniary concerns of individuals of unexampled\r\nextent and duration have recently existed in this as in other commercial\r\nnations is undoubtedly true. To suppose it necessary now to trace these\r\nreverses to their sources would be a reflection on the intelligence of my\r\nfellow-citizens. Whatever may have been the obscurity in which the subject\r\nwas involved during the earlier stages of the revulsion, there can not now\r\nbe many by whom the whole question is not fully understood.\r\n\r\nNot deeming it within the constitutional powers of the General Government\r\nto repair private losses sustained by reverses in business having no\r\nconnection with the public service, either by direct appropriations from\r\nthe Treasury or by special legislation designed to secure exclusive\r\nprivileges and immunities to individuals or classes in preference to or at\r\nthe expense of the great majority necessarily debarred from any\r\nparticipation in them, no attempt to do so has been either made,\r\nrecommended, or encouraged by the present Executive.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, however, that the great purposes for the attainment of\r\nwhich the Federal Government was instituted have not been lost sight of.\r\nIntrusted only with certain limited powers, cautiously enumerated,\r\ndistinctly specified, and defined with a precision and clearness which\r\nwould seem to defy misconstruction, it has been my constant aim to confine\r\nmyself within the limits so clearly marked out and so carefully guarded.\r\nHaving always been of opinion that the best preservative of the union of\r\nthe States is to be found in a total abstinence from the exercise of all\r\ndoubtful powers on the part of the Federal Government rather than in\r\nattempts to assume them by a loose construction of the Constitution or an\r\ningenious perversion of its words, I have endeavored to avoid recommending\r\nany measure which I had reason to apprehend would, in the opinion even of a\r\nconsiderable minority of my fellow-citizens, be regarded as trenching on\r\nthe rights of the States or the provisions of the hallowed instrument of\r\nour Union. Viewing the aggregate powers of the Federal Government as a\r\nvoluntary concession of the States, it seemed to me that such only should\r\nbe exercised as were at the time intended to be given.\r\n\r\nI have been strengthened, too, in the propriety of this course by the\r\nconviction that all efforts to go beyond this tend only to produce\r\ndissatisfaction and distrust, to excite jealousies, and to provoke\r\nresistance. Instead of adding strength to the Federal Government, even when\r\nsuccessful they must ever prove a source of incurable weakness by\r\nalienating a portion of those whose adhesion is indispensable to the great\r\naggregate of united strength and whose voluntary attachment is in my\r\nestimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government strong in\r\nthe best of all possible strength--the confidence and attachment of all\r\nthose who make up its constituent elements.\r\n\r\nThus believing, it has been my purpose to secure to the whole people and to\r\nevery member of the Confederacy, by general, salutary, and equal laws\r\nalone, the benefit of those republican institutions which it was the end\r\nand aim of the Constitution to establish, and the impartial influence of\r\nwhich is in my judgment indispensable to their preservation. I can not\r\nbring myself to believe that the lasting happiness of the people, the\r\nprosperity of the States, or the permanency of their Union can be\r\nmaintained by giving preference or priority to any class of citizens in the\r\ndistribution of benefits or privileges, or by the adoption of measures\r\nwhich enrich one portion of the Union at the expense of another; nor can I\r\nsee in the interference of the Federal Government with the local\r\nlegislation and reserved rights of the States a remedy for present or a\r\nsecurity against future dangers.\r\n\r\nThe first, and assuredly not the least, important step toward relieving the\r\ncountry from the condition into which it had been plunged by excesses in\r\ntrade, banking, and credits of all kinds was to place the business\r\ntransactions of the Government itself on a solid basis, giving and\r\nreceiving in all cases value for value, and neither countenancing nor\r\nencouraging in others that delusive system of credits from which it has\r\nbeen found so difficult to escape, and which has left nothing behind it but\r\nthe wrecks that mark its fatal career.\r\n\r\nThat the financial affairs of the Government are now and have been during\r\nthe whole period of these wide-spreading difficulties conducted with a\r\nstrict and invariable regard to this great fundamental principle, and that\r\nby the assumption and maintenance of the stand thus taken on the very\r\nthreshold of the approaching crisis more than by any other cause or causes\r\nwhatever the community at large has been shielded from the incalculable\r\nevils of a general and indefinite suspension of specie payments, and a\r\nconsequent annihilation for the whole period it might have lasted of a just\r\nand invariable standard of value, will, it is believed, at this period\r\nscarcely be questioned.\r\n\r\nA steady adherence on the part of the Government to the policy which has\r\nproduced such salutary results, aided by judicious State legislation and,\r\nwhat is not less .important, by the industry, enterprise, perseverance, and\r\neconomy of the American people, can not fail to raise the whole country at\r\nan early period to a state of solid and enduring prosperity, not subject to\r\nbe again overthrown by the suspension of banks or the explosion of a\r\nbloated credit system. It is for the people and their representatives to\r\ndecide whether or not the permanent welfare of the country (which all good\r\ncitizens equally desire, however widely they may differ as to the means of\r\nits accomplishment) shall be in this way secured, or whether the management\r\nof the pecuniary concerns of the Government, and by consequence to a great\r\nextent those of individuals also, shall be carried back to a condition of\r\nthings which fostered those contractions and expansions of the currency and\r\nthose reckless abuses of credit from the baleful effects of which the\r\ncountry has so deeply suffered--a return that can promise in the end no\r\nbetter results than to reproduce the embarrassments the Government has\r\nexperienced, and to remove from the shoulders of the present to those of\r\nfresh victims the bitter fruits of that spirit of speculative enterprise to\r\nwhich our countrymen are so liable and upon which the lessons of experience\r\nare so unavailing. The choice is an important one, and I sincerely hope\r\nthat it may be wisely made.\r\n\r\nA report from the Secretary of War, presenting a detailed view of the\r\naffairs of that Department, accompanies this communication.\r\n\r\nThe desultory duties connected with the removal of the Indians, in which\r\nthe Army has been constantly engaged on the northern and western frontiers\r\nand in Florida, have rendered it impracticable to carry into full effect\r\nthe plan recommended by the Secretary for improving its discipline. In\r\nevery instance where the regiments have been concentrated they have made\r\ngreat progress, and the best results may be anticipated from a continuance\r\nof this system. During the last season a part of the troops have been\r\nemployed in removing Indians from the interior to the territory assigned\r\nthem in the West--a duty which they have performed efficiently and with\r\npraiseworthy humanity--and that portion of them which has been stationed in\r\nFlorida continued active operations there throughout the heats of summer.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States in regard to the Indians, of which a\r\nsuccinct account is given in my message of 1838, and of the wisdom and\r\nexpediency of which I am fully satisfied, has been continued in active\r\noperation throughout the whole period of my Administration. Since the\r\nspring of 1837 more than 40,000 Indians have been removed to their new\r\nhomes west of the Mississippi, and I am happy to add that all accounts\r\nconcur in representing the result of this measure as eminently beneficial\r\nto that people.\r\n\r\nThe emigration of the Seminoles alone has been attended with serious\r\ndifficulty and occasioned bloodshed, hostilities having been commenced by\r\nthe Indians in Florida under the apprehension that they would be compelled\r\nby force to comply with their treaty stipulations. The execution of the\r\ntreaty of Paynes Landing, signed in 1832, but not ratified until 1834, was\r\npostponed at the solicitation of the Indians until 1836, when they again\r\nrenewed their agreement to remove peaceably to their new homes in the West.\r\nIn the face of this solemn and renewed compact they broke their faith and\r\ncommenced hostilities by the massacre of Major Dade's command, the murder\r\nof their agent, General Thompson, and other acts of cruel treachery. When\r\nthis alarming and unexpected intelligence reached the seat of Government,\r\nevery effort appears to have been made to reenforce General Clinch, who\r\ncommanded the troops then in Florida. General Eustis was dispatched with\r\nreenforcements from Charleston, troops were called out from Alabama,\r\nTennessee, and Georgia, and General Scott was sent to take the command,\r\nwith ample powers and ample means. At the first alarm General Gaines\r\norganized a force at New Orleans, and without waiting for orders landed in\r\nFlorida, where he delivered over the troops he had brought with him to\r\nGeneral Scott.\r\n\r\nGovernor Call was subsequently appointed to conduct a summer campaign, and\r\nat the close of it was replaced by General Jesup. These events and changes\r\ntook place under the Administration of my predecessor. Notwithstanding the\r\nexertions of the experienced officers who had command there for eighteen\r\nmonths, on entering upon the administration of the Government I found the\r\nTerritory of Florida a prey to Indian atrocities. A strenuous effort was\r\nimmediately made to bring those hostilities to a close, and the army under\r\nGeneral Jesup was reenforced until it amounted to 10,000 men, and furnished\r\nwith abundant supplies of every description. In this campaign a great\r\nnumber of the enemy were captured and destroyed, but the character of the\r\ncontest only was changed. The Indians, having been defeated in every\r\nengagement, dispersed in small bands throughout the country and became an\r\nenterprising, formidable, and ruthless banditti. General Taylor, who\r\nsucceeded General Jesup, used his best exertions to subdue them, and was\r\nseconded in his efforts by the officers under his command; but he too\r\nfailed to protect the Territory from their depredations. By an act of\r\nsignal and cruel treachery they broke the truce made with them by General\r\nMacGrab, who was sent from Washington for the purpose of carrying into\r\neffect the expressed wishes of Congress, and have continued their\r\ndevastations ever since. General Armistead, who was in Florida when General\r\nTaylor left the army by permission, assumed the command, and after active\r\nsummer operations was met by propositions for peace, and from the fortunate\r\ncoincidence of the arrival in Florida at the same period of a delegation\r\nfrom the Seminoles who are happily settled west of the Mississippi and are\r\nnow anxious to persuade their countrymen to join them there hopes were for\r\nsome time entertained that the Indians might be induced to leave the\r\nTerritory without further difficulty. These hopes have proved fallacious\r\nand hostilities have been renewed throughout the whole of the Territory.\r\nThat this contest has endured so long is to be attributed to causes beyond\r\nthe control of the Government. Experienced generals have had the command of\r\nthe troops, officers and soldiers have alike distinguished themselves for\r\ntheir activity, patience, and enduring courage, the army has been\r\nconstantly furnished with supplies of every description, and we must look\r\nfor the causes which have so long procrastinated the issue of the contest\r\nin the vast extent of the theater of hostilities, the almost insurmountable\r\nobstacles presented by the nature of the country, the climate, and the wily\r\ncharacter of the savages.\r\n\r\nThe sites for marine hospitals on the rivers and lakes which I was\r\nauthorized to select and cause to be purchased have all been designated,\r\nbut the appropriation not proving sufficient, conditional arrangements only\r\nhave been made for their acquisition. It is for Congress to decide whether\r\nthese Conditional purchases shall be sanctioned and the humane intentions\r\nof the law carried into full effect.\r\n\r\nThe Navy, as will appear from the accompanying report of the Secretary, has\r\nbeen usefully and honorably employed in the protection of our commerce and\r\ncitizens in the Mediterranean, the Pacific, on the coast of Brazil, and in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. A small squadron, consisting of the frigate\r\nConstellation and the sloop of war Boston, under Commodore Kearney, is now\r\non its way to the China and Indian seas for the purpose of attending to our\r\ninterests in that quarter, and Commander Aulick, in the sloop of war\r\nYorktown, has been instructed to visit the Sandwich and Society islands,\r\nthe coasts of New Zealand and Japan, together with other ports and islands\r\nfrequented by our whale ships, for the purpose of giving them countenance\r\nand protection should they be required. Other smaller vessels have been and\r\nstill are employed in prosecuting the surveys of the coast of the United\r\nStates directed by various acts of Congress, and those which have been\r\ncompleted will shortly be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe exploring expedition at the latest date was preparing to leave the Bay\r\nof Islands, New Zealand, in further prosecution of objects which have thus\r\nfar been successfully accomplished. The discovery of a new continent, which\r\nwas first seen in latitude 66° 2' south, longitude 154° 27' east,\r\nand afterwards in latitude 66° 31' south, longitude 153° 40' east,\r\nby Lieutenants Wilkes and Hudson, for an extent of 1,800 miles, but on\r\nwhich they were prevented from landing by vast bodies of ice which\r\nencompassed it, is one of the honorable results of the enterprise.\r\nLieutenant Wilkes bears testimony to the zeal and good conduct of his\r\nofficers and men, and it is but justice to that officer to state that he\r\nappears to have performed the duties assigned him with an ardor, ability,\r\nand perseverance which give every assurance of an honorable issue to the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith transmitted will exhibit the\r\nservice of that Department the past year and its present condition. The\r\ntransportation has been maintained during the year to the full extent\r\nauthorized by the existing laws; some improvements have been effected which\r\nthe public interest seemed urgently to demand, but not involving any\r\nmaterial additional expenditure; the contractors have generally performed\r\ntheir engagements with fidelity; the postmasters, with few exceptions, have\r\nrendered their accounts and paid their quarterly balances with promptitude,\r\nand the whole service of the Department has maintained the efficiency for\r\nwhich it has for several years been distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe acts of Congress establishing new mail routes and requiring more\r\nexpensive services on others and the increasing wants of the country have\r\nfor three years past carried the expenditures something beyond the accruing\r\nrevenues, the excess having been met until the past year by the surplus\r\nwhich had previously accumulated. That surplus having been exhausted and\r\nthe anticipated increase in the revenue not having been realized owing to\r\nthe depression in the commercial business of the country, the finances of\r\nthe Department exhibit a small deficiency at the close of the last fiscal\r\nyear. Its resources, however, are ample, and the reduced rates of\r\ncompensation for the transportation service which may be expected on the\r\nfuture lettings from the general reduction of prices, with the increase of\r\nrevenue that may reasonably be anticipated from the revival of commercial\r\nactivity, must soon place the finances of the Department in a prosperous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nConsidering the unfavorable circumstances which have existed during the\r\npast year, it is a gratifying result that the revenue has not declined as\r\ncompared with the preceding year, but, on the contrary, exhibits a small\r\nincrease, the circumstances referred to having had no other effect than to\r\ncheck the expected income.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Postmaster-General suggests certain improvements\r\nin the establishment designed to reduce the weight of the mails, cheapen\r\nthe transportation, insure greater regularity in the service, and secure a\r\nconsiderable reduction in the rates of letter postage--an object highly\r\ndesirable. The subject is one of general interest to the community, and is\r\nrespectfully recommended to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the African slave trade has received the continued\r\nattention of the Government. The brig Dolphin and schooner Grampus have\r\nbeen employed during the last season on the coast of Africa for the purpose\r\nof preventing such portions of that trade as were said to be prosecuted\r\nunder the American flag. After cruising off those parts of the coast most\r\nusually resorted to by slavers until the commencement of the rainy season,\r\nthese vessels returned to the United States for supplies, and have since\r\nbeen dispatched on a similar service.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports of the commanding officers it appears that the trade is\r\nnow principally carried on under Portuguese colors, and they express the\r\nopinion that the apprehension of their presence on the slave coast has in a\r\ngreat degree arrested the prostitution of the American flag to this inhuman\r\npurpose. It is hoped that by continuing to maintain this force in that\r\nquarter and by the exertions of the officers in command much will be done\r\nto put a stop to whatever portion of this traffic may have been carried on\r\nunder the American flag and to prevent its use in a trade which, while it\r\nviolates the laws, is equally an outrage on the rights of others and the\r\nfeelings of humanity. The efforts of the several Governments who are\r\nanxiously seeking to suppress this traffic must, however, be directed\r\nagainst the facilities afforded by what are now recognized as legitimate\r\ncommercial pursuits before that object can be fully accomplished.\r\n\r\nSupplies of provisions, water casks, merchandise, and articles connected\r\nwith the prosecution of the slave trade are, it is understood, freely\r\ncarried by vessels of different nations to the slave factories, and the\r\neffects of the factors are transported openly from one slave station to\r\nanother without interruption or punishment by either of the nations to\r\nwhich they belong engaged in the commerce of that region. I submit to your\r\njudgments whether this Government, having been the first to prohibit by\r\nadequate penalties the slave trade, the first to declare it piracy, should\r\nnot be the first also to forbid to its citizens all trade with the slave\r\nfactories on the coast of Africa, giving an example to all nations in this\r\nrespect which if fairly followed can not fail to produce the most effective\r\nresults in breaking up those dens of iniquity.\r\n\r\nM.
