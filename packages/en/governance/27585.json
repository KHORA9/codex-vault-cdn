HUTTON\r\n   OF MERCHANT TAYLORS' SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nG. K. CHESTERTON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first met Belloc he remarked to the friend who introduced us that\r\nhe was in low spirits. His low spirits were and are much more uproarious\r\nand enlivening than anybody else's high spirits. He talked into the\r\nnight; and left behind in it a glowing track of good things. When I have\r\nsaid that I mean things that are good, and certainly not merely _bons\r\nmots,_ I have said all that can be said in the most serious aspect about\r\nthe man who has made the greatest fight for good things of all the men\r\nof my time.\r\n\r\nWe met between a little Soho paper shop and a little Soho restaurant;\r\nhis arms and pockets were stuffed with French Nationalist and French\r\nAtheist newspapers. He wore a straw hat shading his eyes, which are like\r\na sailor's, and emphasizing his Napoleonic chin. He was talking about\r\nKing John, who, he positively assured me, was _not_ (as was often\r\nasserted) the best king that ever reigned in England. Still, there were\r\nallowances to be made for him; I mean King John, not Belloc. \"He had\r\nbeen Regent,\" said Belloc with forbearance, \"and in all the Middle Ages\r\nthere is no example of a successful Regent.\" I, for one, had not come\r\nprovided with any successful Regents with whom to counter this\r\ngeneralization; and when I came to think of it, it was quite true. I\r\nhave noticed the same thing about many other sweeping remarks coming\r\nfrom the same source.\r\n\r\nThe little restaurant to which we went had already become a haunt for\r\nthree or four of us who held strong but unfashionable views about the\r\nSouth African War, which was then in its earliest prestige. Most of us\r\nwere writing on the _Speaker_, edited by Mr. J. L. Hammond with an\r\nindependence of idealism to which I shall always think that we owe much\r\nof the cleaner political criticism of to-day; and Belloc himself was\r\nwriting in it studies of what proved to be the most baffling irony. To\r\nunderstand how his Latin mastery, especially of historic and foreign\r\nthings, made him a leader, it is necessary to appreciate something of\r\nthe peculiar position of that isolated group of \"Pro-Boers.\" We were a\r\nminority in a minority. Those who honestly disapproved of the Transvaal\r\nadventure were few in England; but even of these few a great number,\r\nprobably the majority, opposed it for reasons not only different but\r\nalmost contrary to ours. Many were Pacifists, most were Cobdenites; the\r\nwisest were healthy but hazy Liberals who rightly felt the tradition of\r\nGladstone to be a safer thing than the opportunism of the Liberal\r\nImperialist. But we might, in one very real sense, be more strictly\r\ndescribed as Pro-Boers. That is, we were much more insistent that the\r\nBoers were right in fighting than that the English were wrong in\r\nfighting. We disliked cosmopolitan peace almost as much as cosmopolitan\r\nwar; and it was hard to say whether we more despised those who praised\r\nwar for the gain of money, or those who blamed war for the loss of it.\r\nNot a few men then young were already predisposed to this attitude; Mr.\r\nF. Y. Eccles, a French scholar and critic of an authority perhaps too\r\nfine for fame, was in possession of the whole classical case against\r\nsuch piratical Prussianism; Mr. Hammond himself, with a careful\r\nmagnanimity, always attacked Imperialism as a false religion and not\r\nmerely as a conscious fraud; and I myself had my own hobby of the\r\nromance of small things, including small commonwealths. But to all these\r\nBelloc entered like a man armed, and as with a clang of iron. He brought\r\nwith him news from the fronts of history; that French arts could again\r\nbe rescued by French arms; that cynical Imperialism not only should be\r\nfought, but could be fought and was being fought; that the street\r\nfighting which was for me a fairytale of the future was for him a fact\r\nof the past. There were many other uses of his genius, but I am speaking\r\nof this first effect of it upon our instinctive and sometimes groping\r\nideals. What he brought into our dream was this Roman appetite for\r\nreality and for reason in action, and when he came into the door there\r\nentered with him the smell of danger.\r\n\r\nThere was in him another element of importance which clarified itself in\r\nthis crisis. It was no small part of the irony in the man that different\r\nthings strove against each other in him; and these not merely in the\r\ncommon human sense of good against evil, but one good thing against\r\nanother. The unique attitude of the little group was summed up in him\r\nsupremely in this; that he did and does humanly and heartily love\r\nEngland, not as a duty but as a pleasure and almost an indulgence; but\r\nthat he hated as heartily what England seemed trying to become. Out of\r\nthis appeared in his poetry a sort of fierce doubt or double-mindedness\r\nwhich cannot exist in vague and homogeneous Englishmen; something that\r\noccasionally amounted to a mixture of loving and loathing. It is marked,\r\nfor instance, in the fine break in the middle of the happy song of\r\n_cameraderie_ called \"To the Balliol Men Still in South Africa.\"\r\n\r\n   \"I have said it before, and I say it again,\r\n     There was treason done and a false word spoken,\r\n   And England under the dregs of men,\r\n     And bribes about and a treaty broken.\"\r\n\r\nIt is supremely characteristic of the time that a weighty and\r\nrespectable weekly gravely offered to publish the poem if that central\r\nverse was omitted. This conflict of emotions has an even higher\r\nembodiment in that grand and mysterious poem called \"The Leader,\" in\r\nwhich the ghost of the nobler militarism passes by to rebuke the baser--\r\n\r\n   \"And where had been the rout obscene\r\n     Was an army straight with pride,\r\n   A hundred thousand marching men,\r\n     Of squadrons twenty score,\r\n   And after them all the guns, the guns,\r\n     But She went on before.\"\r\n\r\nSince that small riot of ours he may be said without exaggeration to\r\nhave worked three revolutions: the first in all that was represented by\r\nthe _Eyewitness_, now the _New Witness_, the repudiation of both\r\nParliamentary parties for common and detailed corrupt practices;\r\nsecond, the alarum against the huge and silent approach of the Servile\r\nState, using Socialists and Anti-Socialists alike as its tools; and\r\nthird, his recent campaign of public education in military affairs. In\r\nall these he played the part which he had played for our little party of\r\npatriotic Pro-Boers. He was a man of action in abstract things. There\r\nwas supporting his audacity a great sobriety. It is in this sobriety,\r\nand perhaps in this only, that he is essentially French; that he belongs\r\nto the most individually prudent and the most collectively reckless of\r\npeoples. There is indeed a part of him that is romantic and, in the\r\nliteral sense, erratic; but that is the English part. But the French\r\npeople take care of the pence that the pounds may be careless of\r\nthemselves. And Belloc is almost materialist in his details, that he may\r\nbe what most Englishmen would call mystical, not to say monstrous, in\r\nhis aim. In this he is quite in the tradition of the only country of\r\nquite successful revolutions. Precisely because France wishes to do wild\r\nthings, the things must not be too wild. A wild Englishman like Blake or\r\nShelley is content with dreaming them. How Latin is this combination\r\nbetween intellectual economy and energy can be seen by comparing Belloc\r\nwith his great forerunner Cobbett, who made war on the same Whiggish\r\nwealth and secrecy and in defence of the same human dignity and\r\ndomesticity. But Cobbett, being solely English, was extravagant in his\r\nlanguage even about serious public things, and was wildly romantic even\r\nwhen he was merely right. But with Belloc the style is often\r\nrestrained; it is the substance that is violent. There is many a\r\nparagraph of accusation he has written which might almost be called dull\r\nbut for the dynamite of its meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that I have dealt too much with this phase of him, for it\r\nis the one in which he appears to me as something different, and\r\ntherefore dramatic. I have not spoken of those glorious and fantastic\r\nguide-books which are, as it were, the textbooks of a whole science of\r\nErratics. In these he is borne beyond the world with those poets whom\r\nKeats conceived as supping at a celestial \"Mermaid.\" But the \"Mermaid\"\r\nwas English--and so was Keats. And though Hilaire Belloc may have a\r\nFrench name, I think that Peter Wanderwide is an Englishman.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the most real thing about Belloc, the religion,\r\nbecause it is above this purpose, and nothing of the later attacks on\r\nhim by the chief Newspaper Trust, because they are much below it. There\r\nare, of course, many other reasons for passing such matters over here,\r\nincluding the argument of space; but there is also a small reason of my\r\nown, which if not exactly a secret is at least a very natural ground of\r\nsilence. It is that I entertain a very intimate confidence that in a\r\nvery little time humanity will be saying, \"Who was this So-and-So with\r\nwhom Belloc seems to have debated?\"\r\n\r\n                                             G.

BELLOC AND THE PUBLIC\r\n\r\nA CASE FOR LEGISLATION _AD HOC_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stand upon the brink of a superb adventure. To rummage about in the\r\nlumber-room of a bygone period: to wipe away the dust from\r\nlong-neglected annals: to burnish up old facts and fancies: to piece\r\ntogether the life-story of some loved hero long dead: that is a work of\r\nreverent thought to be undertaken in peace and seclusion. But to plunge\r\nboldly into the study of a living personality: to strive to measure the\r\ngreatness of a man just entering the fullness of his powers: to attempt\r\nto grasp the nature of that greatness: this is to go out along the road\r\nof true adventure, the road which is hard to travel, the road which has\r\nno end.\r\n\r\nNaturally we cannot hope in this little study to escape those\r\ninnumerable pitfalls into which contemporary criticism always stumbles.\r\nIt is impossible to-day to view Mr. Belloc and his work in that due\r\nperspective so beloved of the don. No doubt we shall crash headlong into\r\nthe most shocking errors of judgement, exaggerating this feature and\r\nbelittling that in a way that will horrify the critic of a decade or two\r\nhence. Mr. Belloc himself may turn and rend us: deny our premises:\r\nscatter our syllogisms: pulverize our theories.\r\n\r\nThis only makes our freedom the greater. Scientific analysis being\r\nbeyond attainment, we are tied down by no rules. When we have examined\r\nMr. Belloc's work and Mr. Belloc's personality, we are free to put\r\nforward (provided we do not mind them being refuted) what theories we\r\nchoose. Nothing could be more alluring.\r\n\r\nIn a book about Mr. Belloc the reader may have expected to make Mr.\r\nBelloc's acquaintance on the first page. But Mr. Belloc is a difficult\r\nman to meet. Even if you have a definite appointment with him (as you\r\nhave in this book) you cannot be certain that you will not be obliged to\r\nwait. Every day of Mr. Belloc's life is so full of engagements that he\r\nis inevitably late for some of them. But his courtesy is invariable: and\r\nhe will often make himself a little later by stopping to ring you up in\r\norder to apologize for his lateness and to assure you that he will be\r\nwith you in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine him, then, hastening to meet us in one of those taxicabs\r\nof which he is so bountiful a patron, and, in the interval, before we\r\nmake his personal acquaintance, try to recall what we already know of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Mr. Hilaire Belloc to his largest public is quite\r\nsimply and solely the war expert. To those people, thousands in number,\r\nwho have become acquainted with Mr. Belloc through the columns of _Land\r\nand Water_, the _Illustrated Sunday Herald_, and other journals and\r\nperiodicals, or have swelled the audiences at his lectures in London and\r\nthe various provincial centres, his name promises escape from the\r\nbewilderment engendered by an irritated Press and an approximation, at\r\nleast, to a clear conception of the progress of the war. Those who\r\nrealize, as Mr. Belloc himself points out somewhere, that there has\r\nnever been a great public occasion in regard to which it is more\r\nnecessary that men should have a sound judgment than it is in regard to\r\nthis war, gladly turn to him for guidance. His _General Sketch of the\r\nEuropean War_ is read by the educated man who finds himself hampered in\r\nforming an opinion of the progress of events by an ignorance of military\r\nscience, while the mass of public opinion, which is less well-informed\r\nand less able to distinguish between the essential and the\r\nnon-essential, finds in the series of articles, reprinted in book-form\r\nunder the title _The Two Maps_, a rock-basis of general principles on\r\nwhich it may rest secure from the hurling waves of sensationalism,\r\nignorance, misrepresentation and foolishness which are striving\r\nperpetually to engulf it.\r\n\r\nSo intense and so widespread, indeed, is the vogue of Mr. Belloc to-day\r\nas a writer on the war, that one is almost compelled into forgetfulness\r\nof his earlier work and of the reputation he had established for himself\r\nin many provinces of literature and thought before, in the eyes of the\r\nworld, he made this new province his own. The colossal monument of\r\nunstinted public approbation, which records his work since the outbreak\r\nof the great war, overshadows, as it were, the temples of less\r\nmagnitude, though of equally solid foundation and often of more precious\r\ndesign, in which his former achievements in art and thought were\r\nenshrined.\r\n\r\nThat there existed, however, before the war, a large and increasing\r\npublic, which was gradually awakening to a realization of Mr. Belloc's\r\nimportance, there can be no question.\r\n\r\nThere can be equally little question, that only a very small percentage\r\nof his readers were in a position even to attempt an appreciation of Mr.\r\nBelloc's full importance.\r\n\r\nThis was due, chiefly, to the diversity of Mr. Belloc's writings.\r\n\r\nFor example, many thinking men, who saw no reason why the common sense,\r\nwhich served them so well in their business affairs, should be banished\r\nfrom their consideration of matters political, felt themselves in\r\nsympathy with his analysis and denunciation of the evils of our\r\nparliamentary machinery, thoroughly enjoying the vigorous lucidity of\r\n_The Party System_ and applauding the clear historical reasoning of _The\r\nServile State_.\r\n\r\nOther men, repelled, perhaps, by such logical grouping of cold facts,\r\nbut attracted by the satirical delights of _Emmanuel Burden_ or _Mr.\r\nClutterbuck_, of _Pongo and the Bull_ or _A Change in the Cabinet_, were\r\nled to like conclusions, and came to consider themselves adherents of\r\nMr. Belloc's political views.\r\n\r\nTake another instance. Bloodless students of history, absorbing the past\r\nfor the sake of the past and not for the sake of the present, who knew\r\nlittle of Mr. Belloc's attitude toward the politics of the day and\r\nstrongly disapproved of what little they did know, yet concerned\r\nthemselves with his historical method as applied in _Danton_,\r\n_Robespierre_ or _Marie Antoinette_, and were mildly excited by _The\r\nFrench Revolution_ into a discussion of what (to Mr. Belloc's horror)\r\nthey considered his _Weltanschauung_.\r\n\r\nThere are but one or two examples of cases in which men of different\r\ntypes came to a partial knowledge of Mr. Belloc and his work through\r\ntheir sympathy with the views he expressed. But far beyond and above the\r\nappeal which Mr. Belloc has made on occasion to the political and\r\nhistorical sense of his readers is the appeal which he has made\r\nconsistently to their literary sense in _The Path to Rome_, in _The Four\r\nMen_, in _Avril_, in _The Bad Child's Book of Beasts_, in _Esto\r\nPerpetua_--in his novels, his essays, his poems. If many have been\r\nattracted by his views, how many more have been influenced by his\r\nexpression of them?\r\n\r\n     \"A man desiring to influence his fellowmen,\" says Mr. Belloc, in\r\n     _The French Revolution_, \"has two co-related instruments at his\r\n     disposal.... These two instruments are his idea and his style.\r\n     However powerful, native, sympathetic to his hearers' mood or\r\n     cogently provable by reference to new things may be a man's idea,\r\n     he cannot persuade his fellowmen to it if he have not words that\r\n     express it. And he will persuade them more and more in proportion\r\n     as his words are well-chosen and in the right order, such order\r\n     being determined by the genius of the language from which they are\r\n     drawn.\"\r\n\r\nThese words fitly emphasize the importance of style: and when a\r\ndistinction is drawn, as is done above, between the appeal which Mr.\r\nBelloc has made to the political and historical sense of his readers and\r\nthe appeal he has made to their literary sense, it is, naturally, not\r\nintended to suggest that an appeal to his readers' literary sense is in\r\nany way lacking in Mr. Belloc's political and historical writings. The\r\nappeal to our literary sense is as strong in _The Servile State_ or\r\n_Danton_ as in _The Four Men_ or _Mr. Clutterbuck_. But in the one case,\r\nin the case of the two last-named books, the appeal Mr. Belloc makes is\r\nchiefly to our literary sense: in the other case, in the case of the two\r\nfirst-named books, there is added to the appeal to our literary sense an\r\nappeal to our political and historical sense.\r\n\r\nThe nature of Mr. Belloc's own style is dealt with in a later chapter:\r\nhere it is merely asserted that, before the war, at any rate, Mr.\r\nBelloc's style was accorded more general recognition than were his\r\nideas. Many who decried his matter extolled his manner. Many men of\r\ntalent, some men of genius, such as the late Rupert Brooke, regarded him\r\nas a very great writer of English prose. Literary _dilettanti_ envied\r\nhim the refrains of his _ballades_. His essays, many of which were\r\nmanner without matter, were thoroughly popular. What he said might be\r\nnonsense, but the way he said it was irresistible.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the war Mr. Belloc has had that to say which\r\neverybody desired to hear. He has known how to say that which everybody\r\ndesired to hear in the way it might best be said. He has been in a\r\nposition to express ideas with which every one wished to become\r\nfamiliar: he has known how to express those ideas so that they might be\r\nreadily grasped. And he has become famous.\r\n\r\nTo those who were acquainted with but a part of his work before the war\r\nMr. Belloc's sudden leap into prominence as the most noteworthy writer\r\non military affairs in England must have come as somewhat of a shock. To\r\nthose whose knowledge of Mr. Belloc's writings was confined to _The Path\r\nto Rome_ or the _Cautionary Tales_, who thought of him as essayist or\r\npoet, this must have seemed a strange metamorphosis indeed. Even those\r\nwho were conversant with his study of the military aspects of the\r\nRevolution and had noticed the careful attention paid by Mr. Belloc to\r\nmilitary matters in various books could scarcely have been prepared for\r\nsuch an avalanche of highly-specialized knowledge. For we are all prone\r\nto the mistake of confusing a man with his books.\r\n\r\nWith regard to some writers this error does not necessarily lead to very\r\nevil results. There are some writers who express themselves as much in\r\none part of their work as in another. Take Mr. H. G. Wells as an\r\nexample. His writings, it is true, are varied in character, ranging from\r\nphantasy to philosophy, from sociology to science. But through all his\r\nwritings there runs a thin thread which binds all of them together.\r\nThat thread is the personality of Mr. Wells finding expression. In such\r\na case as this personal knowledge of the man merely amplifies the idea\r\nof him which we have been able to gather from his work.\r\n\r\nBut with Mr. Belloc the case is different. Can any full idea of Mr.\r\nBelloc, the man, be formed by reading his books? It is to be doubted.\r\nWere you to consult a reader of Mr. Wells' phantasies and a reader of\r\nMr. Wells' sociological novels with regard to the ideas of the writer\r\nthey had gleaned, you would find that the mental pictures they had\r\npainted had many characteristics in common. Were you to make the same\r\nexperiment with a reader of Mr. Belloc's political writings and, say, a\r\nsubscriber to the _Morning Post_, who knew him by his essays alone, the\r\npictures would be entirely dissimilar.\r\n\r\nAnd if it be admitted that this is so, the question arises: why is it\r\nso? If, in the case of Mr. Wells, the writer is dimly visible through\r\nthe veil of his writings, why does Mr. Belloc remain hidden? This must\r\nnot be understood as meaning that Mr. Belloc's personality is not\r\nexpressed in his writings. To offer such an explanation would be merely\r\nabsurd. But it means that his personality is not expressed, as is that\r\nof Mr. Wells, completely though cloudily, in any one book. To offer as a\r\nreason that the one is subjective, the other objective is nonsense.\r\nEvery writer is necessarily both.\r\n\r\nThere are two answers to the question: the one partially, the other\r\nwholly true. To attempt to find the answer which is wholly true is one\r\nof the reasons why this book was written.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, let us be content with the answer which is\r\npartially true. Let us accept the charge of a contemporary and friend of\r\nMr. Belloc who has long loomed large in the world of literature:--\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Hilaire Belloc\r\n    Is a case for legislation _ad hoc_:\r\n    He seems to think nobody minds\r\n    His books being all of different kinds.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the charge. A plea of guilty and, at the same time, a defence\r\nbased on justification might be found in Mr. Belloc's words (which occur\r\nat the end of one of his essays): \"What a wonderful world it is and how\r\nmany things there are in it!\"\r\n\r\nThus might we bolster up the answer which is but partially true until\r\nit seemed wholly true. We might make Mr. Belloc's diversity his\r\ndisguise. We might hoodwink the public.\r\n\r\nBut that is a dangerous game. The public has a habit of finding out. Mr.\r\nBelloc himself is always on the watch to expose impostors (especially\r\nthe Parliamentary kind) and he has described most graphically the fate\r\nawaiting them:--\r\n\r\n   \"For every time She shouted 'Fire!'\r\n    The people answered 'Little Liar!'\"\r\n\r\nSo let us view the matter squarely.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this little study, if so ambitious a phrase may be used of\r\nwhat is purely a piece of self-indulgence, is to present the public with\r\nas complete an idea as possible of Mr. Belloc and his work. Up to the\r\npresent, the relations between Mr. Belloc and the public have been, to\r\nsay the least, peculiar. If we regard the public as a mass subject to\r\nattack and the author as the attacker, we may say that, whereas most\r\ncontemporary authors have attacked at one spot only and used their\r\ngradually increasing strength to drive on straight into the heart of the\r\nmass, Mr. Belloc has attacked at various points. It is obvious, however,\r\nthat these various separate attacks, if they are to achieve their\r\nobject, which is the subjection of the mass, must be thoroughly\r\nco-ordinated and have large reserve forces upon which to draw.\r\n\r\nSome slight outline of the nature of the various attacks on the public\r\nmade by Mr. Belloc has already been given. We stand amazed to-day by the\r\nunqualified success which has attended the attack carried into effect by\r\nhis writings on the war. But if we are to form even an approximation to\r\na complete idea of Mr. Belloc, it is necessary to examine these various\r\nattacks, not merely separately and in detail, but in their relation to\r\neach other and as a co-ordinated plan. And before we can hope to measure\r\nthe strength of that plan, we must examine the mind which ordains its\r\nco-ordination and the forces which render possible its execution: in\r\nother words, the personality of Mr. Belloc.\r\n\r\nAny rigid distinction, then, drawn between Mr. Belloc's political,\r\nhistorical and other writings is ultimately arbitrary. In the ensuing\r\npages of this book it will be seen how essentially interwoven and\r\ninterdependent are the various aspects of Mr. Belloc's work and how they\r\nhave developed, not the one out of the other, but alongside and in\r\nco-relation with each other. For the sake of clearness, however, some\r\nbasis of classification must be adopted, and that of _subject_, though\r\nrough and inadequate, will be understood, perhaps, most readily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a jerk a taxicab stops in the street outside. We hear the sound of\r\nquick footsteps along the stone-flagged passage, with a rattle of the\r\nhandle the door swings wide open and Mr. Belloc is in the middle of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMR. BELLOC THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nShort of stature, he yet dominates those in the room by virtue of the\r\nforce within him. So abundant is his vitality, that less forceful\r\nnatures receive from him an access of energy. This vigour appears, in\r\nhis person, in the massive breadth of his shoulders and the solidity of\r\nhis neck. With the exception of his marked breadth, he is\r\nwell-proportioned in build, though somewhat stout. His head is rather\r\nRoman in shape, and his face, with its wide, calm brow, piercing eyes,\r\naquiline nose, straight mouth and square jaw, expresses a power of deep\r\nreflection combined with a very lively interest in the things of the\r\nmoment, but, above all, tremendous determination. He holds himself\r\nerect, with square shoulders; but the appearance of a stoop is given to\r\nhis figure by the habit, acquired by continual writing and public\r\nspeaking, of moving with his head thrust forward.\r\n\r\nIn his movements, he is as rapid and decided as, in the giving of\r\ninstructions, he is clear and terse. In debate or argument his speech is\r\noften loud and accompanied by vigorous and decided gestures; but in\r\nconversation his manner is constrained and his voice quiet and clear\r\nwith a strong power of appeal which is enhanced by a slight French lisp.\r\nAt times he is violent in his language and movements, but he is never\r\nrestless or vague. In everything he says and does he is orderly. This\r\norderliness of speech and action is the outcome of an orderliness of\r\nmind which is as complete as it is rare, and endows Mr. Belloc with a\r\npower of detaching his attention from one subject and transferring it,\r\nnot partially but entirely, to another. As a result, whatever he is\r\ndoing, however small or however great the piece of work in hand, upon\r\nthat for the time being is his whole vigour concentrated.\r\n\r\nThis almost unlimited, but, at the same time, thoroughly controlled and\r\nwell-directed energy, is Mr. Belloc's most prominent characteristic. He\r\nis always busy, yet always with more to do than he can possibly\r\naccomplish. He has never a moment to waste. As a consequence, he often\r\ngives the impression of being brusque and domineering. His manner to\r\nthose he does not know is uninviting. This is because the meeting of\r\nstrangers to so busy a man can never be anything but an interruption,\r\nsignifying a loss of valuable time. He is anxious to bring you to your\r\npoint at once and to express his own opinion as shortly and plainly as\r\npossible. The temperamentally nervous who meet him but casually find him\r\nharsh and think him a bully.\r\n\r\nHe is nothing of the sort. He is a man of acute perceptions and fine\r\nfeelings; and with those whom he knows well he is scrupulous to make due\r\nallowance for temperamental peculiarities. When you have learnt to know\r\nhim well, when you have seen him in his rare moments of leisure and\r\nrepose, you realize how abundantly he is possessed of those qualities\r\nwhich go to form what is called depth of character. His humour and\r\ngood-fellowship attract men to him: his power of understanding and\r\nsympathy tie them to him. He is the very antithesis of a self-centred\r\nman. His first question, when he meets you, is of yourself and your\r\ndoings; he never speaks of himself. He is always more interested in the\r\nactivities of others than in what he himself is doing. He is engrossed\r\nin his work; but he is interested in it as in something outside himself,\r\nnot as in something which is a very vital part of himself. It is this\r\ncharacteristic which leads one to consider the whole of his work up to\r\nthe present time as the expression of but a part of the man. Great and\r\nvaluable as is that work--it has been said of him that he has had more\r\ninfluence on his generation than any other one man--Mr. Belloc's\r\npersonality inspires the belief that he is capable of yet greater\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nThis belief is supported by the undeniable fact that Mr. Belloc is an\r\nidealist. He has ideals both for individual and communal life. But\r\nideals to him are not, as to so many men, a delight of the imagination\r\nor a means of consoling themselves for being obliged to live in the\r\nworld as it is. They are guides to conduct and inspirations to action: a\r\ngoal which is reached in the striving.\r\n\r\nMost of us go about this world imagining ourselves to be not as we are,\r\nbut as we should like ourselves to be. No man who is not wholly\r\nunimaginative can escape this form of self-consciousness. Certainly no\r\nman who has in him anything of the artist can escape it: less still a\r\nman who is so much of an artist as Mr. Belloc. It has been remarked of\r\nMr. Belloc time and again that he would make an extraordinarily fine\r\nrevolutionary leader, and it is interesting to find in Mr. Belloc's work\r\na description of one of the greatest revolutionary leaders which might\r\nin many respects be a description of Mr. Belloc himself. We refer to Mr.\r\nBelloc's description of the appearance and character of Danton. Though\r\nit would be absurd to suggest that Mr. Belloc has deliberately modelled\r\nhis life on that of Danton, yet the resemblance between Mr. Belloc's own\r\npersonality and the personality (as Mr. Belloc describes it) of Danton\r\nis so striking, that we cannot avoid quoting the passage at considerable\r\nlength. It is interesting, too, to recall that this monograph, which is\r\nobviously based on very careful and deep research, was written by Mr.\r\nBelloc shortly after he came down from Oxford, and was the first work of\r\nimportance he published. Mr. Belloc describes Danton thus:--\r\n\r\n     He was tall and stout, with the forward bearing of the orator, full\r\n     of gesture and of animation. He carried a round French head upon\r\n     the thick neck of energy. His face was generous, ugly, and\r\n     determined. With wide eyes and calm brows, he yet had the quick\r\n     glance which betrays the habit of appealing to an audience.... In\r\n     his dress he had something of the negligence which goes with\r\n     extreme vivacity and with a constant interest in things outside\r\n     oneself; but it was invariably that of his rank. Indeed, to the\r\n     minor conventions Danton always bowed, because he was a man, and\r\n     because he was eminently sane. More than did the run of men at that\r\n     time, he understood that you cut down no tree by lopping at the\r\n     leaves, nor break up a society by throwing away a wig. The decent\r\n     self-respect which goes with conscious power was never absent from\r\n     his costume, though it often left his language in moments of\r\n     crisis, or even of irritation. I will not insist too much upon his\r\n     great character of energy, because it has been so over-emphasized\r\n     as to give a false impression of him. He was admirably sustained in\r\n     his action, and his political arguments were as direct as his\r\n     physical efforts were continuous, but the banal picture of fury\r\n     which is given you by so many writers is false. For fury is empty,\r\n     whereas Danton was full, and his energy was at first the force at\r\n     work upon a great mass of mind, and later its momentum. Save when\r\n     he had the direct purpose of convincing a crowd, his speech had no\r\n     violence, and even no metaphor; in the courts he was a close\r\n     reasoner, and one who put his points with ability and with\r\n     eloquence rather than with thunder. But in whatever he undertook,\r\n     vigour appeared as the taste of salt in a dish. He could not quite\r\n     hide this vigour: his convictions, his determination, his vision\r\n     all concentrate upon whatsoever thing he has in hand. He possessed\r\n     a singularly wide view of the Europe in which France stood. In this\r\n     he was like Mirabeau, and peculiarly unlike the men with whom\r\n     revolutionary government threw him into contact. He read and spoke\r\n     English, he was acquainted with Italian. He knew that the kings\r\n     were dilettanti, that the theory of the aristocracies was liberal.\r\n     He had no little sympathy with the philosophy which a leisurely\r\n     oligarchy had framed in England; it is one of the tragedies of the\r\n     Revolution that he desired to the last an alliance, or at least\r\n     peace, with this country. Where Robespierre was a maniac in foreign\r\n     policy, Danton was more than a sane--he was a just, and even a\r\n     diplomatic man. He was fond of wide reading, and his reading was of\r\n     the philosophers; it ranged from Rabelais to the physiocrats in his\r\n     own tongue, from Adam Smith to the _Essay on Civil Government_ in\r\n     that of strangers; and of the Encyclopaedia he possessed all the\r\n     numbers steadily accumulated. When we consider the time, his\r\n     fortune, and the obvious personal interest in so small and\r\n     individual a collection, few shelves will be found more interesting\r\n     than those which Danton delighted to fill. In his politics he\r\n     desired above all actual, practical, and apparent reforms; changes\r\n     for the better expressed in material results. He differed from many\r\n     of his countrymen at that time, and from most of his political\r\n     countrymen now, in thus adopting the tangible. It was a part of\r\n     something in his character which was nearly allied to the stock of\r\n     the race, something which made him save and invest in land as does\r\n     the French peasant, and love, as the French peasant loves, good\r\n     government, order, security, and well-being. There is to be\r\n     discovered in all the fragments which remain to us of his\r\n     conversation before the bursting of the storm, and still more\r\n     clearly in his demand for a _centre_ when the invasion and the\r\n     rebellion threatened the Republic, a certain conviction that the\r\n     revolutionary thing rather than the revolutionary idea should be\r\n     produced: not an inspiring creed, but a goal to be reached,\r\n     sustained him. Like all active minds, his mission was rather to\r\n     realize than to plan, and his energies were determined upon seeing\r\n     the result of theories which he unconsciously admitted, but which\r\n     he was too impatient to analyse. His voice was loud even when his\r\n     expressions were subdued. He talked no man down, but he made many\r\n     opponents sound weak and piping after his utterance. It was of the\r\n     kind that fills great halls, and whose deep note suggests hard\r\n     phrases. There was with all this a carelessness as to what his\r\n     words might be made to mean when partially repeated by others, and\r\n     such carelessness has caused historians still more careless to lend\r\n     a false aspect of Bohemianism to his character. A Bohemian he was\r\n     not; he was a successful and an orderly man; but energy he had, and\r\n     if there are writers who cannot conceive of energy without chaos,\r\n     it is probably because in the studious leisure of vast endowments\r\n     they have never felt the former in themselves, nor have been\r\n     compelled to control the latter in their surroundings.... His\r\n     friends also he loved, and above all, from the bottom of his soul,\r\n     he loved France. His faults--and they were many--his vices (and a\r\n     severe critic would have discovered these also) flowed from two\r\n     sources: first, he was too little of an idealist, too much absorbed\r\n     in the immediate thing; secondly, he suffered from all the evil\r\n     effects that abundant energy may produce--the habit of oaths, the\r\n     rhetoric of sudden diatribes, violent and overstrained action, with\r\n     its subsequent demand for repose.\r\n\r\nThis is neither the place nor the time to enter into details of Mr.\r\nBelloc's life. Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember a few points in\r\nhis career when tracing the development of his work. The first important\r\npoint to remember is that Mr. Belloc, for a man who has achieved so\r\nmuch, is still comparatively young. He was born at La Celle, St. Cloud,\r\nnear Paris, in 1870, the son of Louis Swanton Belloc, a French\r\nbarrister. His mother was English, the daughter of Joseph Parkes, a man\r\nof some considerable importance in his own time, a politician of the\r\nReform Bill period, and the historian of the Chancery Bar. His book on\r\nthis subject is still considered the best authority.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc was educated at the Oratory School, Edgbaston. On leaving\r\nschool he served as a driver in the 8th Regiment of French Artillery. He\r\nleft the service for Balliol in 1892, and in the following year became a\r\nBrackenbury History Scholar of that college and took First Class honours\r\nin his final history schools in 1895. In the same year he published\r\n_Verses and Sonnets_, which was followed in 1896 by _The Bad Child's\r\nBook of Beasts_. This was followed the next year by _More Beasts for\r\nWorse Children_. In 1898 _The Modern Traveller_ appeared, and in 1899 he\r\npublished his first work of outstanding importance--the study of\r\n_Danton_. _Robespierre_ was published in 1901, and _The Path to Rome_ in\r\n1902; _Emmanuel Burden_ was published in 1904, and _Esto Perpetua_ in\r\n1906. By this time Mr. Belloc's literary reputation was so firmly\r\nestablished that he was offered, and accepted, the post of chief\r\nreviewer on the staff of the _Morning Post_. During the time he was\r\nconnected with this paper he not only attracted attention to it by his\r\nown essays, but undoubtedly rendered it solid service by introducing to\r\nits somewhat conservative columns a new group of writing men. It was in\r\n1906, too, that Mr. Belloc was elected \"Liberal member\" for South\r\nSalford. His independent mind was at variance with the \"tone of the\r\nHouse,\" and he distinguished himself by demanding an audit of the Secret\r\nParty Funds, which he considered to be the chief source of political\r\ncorruption. At the next election in 1910 the Party Funds were not\r\nforthcoming in his support, but he stood as an independent candidate and\r\nwas returned in the face of the caucus. On the occasion of the second\r\nelection of 1910, he refused to repeat his candidature, having declared,\r\nin his last speech in the House, his opinion that a seat there under the\r\nexisting machine was valueless. In 1910 he resigned his appointment on\r\nthe _Morning Post_, and in 1911 became Head of the English Literature\r\nDepartment at the East London College, a post he lost (for political\r\nreasons) in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPERSONALITY IN STYLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters we have seen something of Mr. Belloc's career\r\nand caught a glimpse of the man as he is to-day. But in common with\r\nevery other writer of note Mr. Belloc expresses his personality in his\r\nwritings. And the lighter the subject with which he is dealing, the more\r\nhe is writing, as it were, out of himself, the clearer is the picture we\r\nget of him. If we turn, then, to his essays, collected from here and\r\nthere, on this and that, on everything and on nothing, we may see Mr.\r\nBelloc reflected in the clear stream of his own writing: and in\r\nproportion as the reflection is vivid or blurred we may rank him as a\r\nstylist and writer of English prose.\r\n\r\nStyle in prose or verse has never existed and cannot exist of itself\r\nalone. Style is not the art of writing melodious words or the craft or\r\ncunning of finding a way round the split infinitive. It is the ability\r\nso to choose forms of expression as completely to convey to a reader all\r\nthe twists and turns and outlines of a character.\r\n\r\nIt is not even necessarily confined to the handling of words: there is\r\nnothing more characteristic in the style of Mr. H. G. Wells than the use\r\nof the three dots ... which journalism has recently invented. There may\r\nbe style--that is, the expression of a temperament--in the position of a\r\ndash or of a semicolon: Heaven knows, a modern German poet enters the\r\nconfessional when he uses marks of exclamation.\r\n\r\nStyle, it must be repeated, is the exact and faithful representation of\r\na man's spirit in poetry or prose. The precise value of that spirit does\r\nnot matter for the moment. James Boswell, Dr. Johnson and Porteous,\r\nBishop of Chester, investigated the matter with some acumen and some\r\nfruitfulness in one of their terrifying conversations:\r\n\r\n     What I wanted to know [Boswell says] was, whether there was really\r\n     a peculiar style to every man whatever, as there is certainly a\r\n     peculiar hand-writing, a peculiar countenance, not widely different\r\n     in many, yet always enough to be distinctive:\r\n\r\n          \"--facies non omnibus una\r\n             nec diversa tamen\"--\r\n\r\n     The Bishop thought not; and said, he supposed that many pieces in\r\n     Dodsley's collection of poems, though all very pretty, had nothing\r\n     appropriated in their style, and in that particular could not be at\r\n     all distinguished. JOHNSON. \"Why, sir, I think every man whatever\r\n     has a peculiar style, which may be discerned by nice examination\r\n     and comparison with others: but a man must write a great deal to\r\n     make his style obviously discernible. As logicians say, this\r\n     appropriation of style is infinite _in potestate_, limited _in\r\n     actu_.\"\r\n\r\nIt would appear at first sight sufficient, to confute Johnson, to refer\r\nto the four hundred volumes of verse, which are published (so it is said\r\nin the newspapers of this trade) in every year. But he overlooked only\r\none thing: namely the tendency of literary men to be insincere. It is\r\nthe habit of writing in phrases, very much like building up a picture\r\nout of blocks that have on them already portions of a picture, which\r\ncomes between the spirit of the writer and its true expression in a\r\nnative style.\r\n\r\nEven this is no barrier to a sensitive ear. An experienced reporter once\r\ntold the present writer that he could distinguish, by internal evidence\r\nalone, the authorship of almost every paragraph in the detestable\r\nhalfpenny newspaper to which he then contributed.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc, at least, has covered a sufficient quantity of pages to make\r\nit easy, if Johnson's notion be correct, for any critic who honestly\r\nundertakes the task, to discern the characteristics of his style. To\r\nconvey his impression thereof in a convincing way to the reader is not\r\nso easy for the critic: and the wealth and breadth of his subject may\r\nhamper him here.\r\n\r\nBefore we begin an exposition of Mr. Belloc's style, an exposition which\r\nis meant to be in the true sense a criticism and in the full sense an\r\nappreciation, let us recapitulate the points we have already established\r\nin our inquiry into the nature of style as an abstract quality, and let\r\nus essay to add to them such points as may assist us in our difficult\r\ntask of estimating the worth of a very good style indeed.\r\n\r\nStyle, we have said, results from the exact and accurate expression of a\r\ntemperament or a character--as you please, for it is true that the word\r\n\"temperament\" is dangerous. We have also observed that, in viewing style\r\nfrom this angle of sight, it does not matter to the inquiry whether the\r\ncharacter in question is desirable or hateful. That man has a style who\r\ndoes sincerely and exactly express his true spirit in any medium, words\r\nor music or little dots. Such a style has the worth of genuineness and,\r\nto the curious in psychology, it has a certain positive value. A man who\r\nachieves so much deserves almost the title of poet: he certainly is of a\r\nkind rare in its appearances.\r\n\r\nBut when we begin seriously to speak of excellence in prose, or verse,\r\nwe must add yet another test, to pass which a man must not only express\r\nhis spirit with sincerity, but must also have a strong and original\r\nspirit. It will be our business now to search out, delimit and define,\r\nnot only Mr. Belloc's nicety and felicity of expression, but also the\r\nvalue of the thing which he expresses.\r\n\r\nEnough will be said up and down this book and going about in the\r\nchapters of it of that lucidity which is our author's peculiar merit and\r\nthe quality which most effectively permits him to play his part as a\r\nspreader of ideas and of information. It is a French virtue, we are\r\ntold, and Mr. Belloc is of the French blood: it is the essence of the\r\nLatin spirit, he tells us, and he has never wearied of praising the\r\nglories of the race which carefully and logically made all fast and\r\nsecure about it with a chain of irrefragable reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis lucidity, this patient passion for exactness, have added to what\r\nmight have been expected of Mr. Belloc's sincerity and unlimited\r\ncapacity for enthusiasm. In that admirable phrase of Buffon, too often\r\nquoted and too little applied, the style is the man. This is a fine\r\nwriter, because he has the craft truly to represent a fine spirit in\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nIt is a style which is strongly individual and which is on the whole\r\nrather restful than provocative. The reader's mind reposes on the\r\nsecurity of these strongly moulded sentences, these solid paragraphs and\r\nperiods. It is a considered style in which word after word falls\r\nadmirably into its appointed place. It is not quite of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, for it is stronger than that prose. It certainly has not the\r\nundisciplined aspect of Elizabethan writing. It has the exactitude\r\nwithout the occasional finickingness of the best French work, and it has\r\nthe breadth of English, but never falls into confusion, clumsiness or\r\nextravagance. Mr. Belloc does not experience difficulties with his\r\nrelative pronouns or bog himself in a mess of parentheses. The habit of\r\nexposition has taught him to disentangle his sentences and disengage his\r\nqualifying clauses.\r\n\r\nIt is pre-eminently and especially an instrument. It has been evolved by\r\na man whose passion it is to communicate his reflections, to make\r\nhimself understood. He has learnt the practice of good writing through\r\nthis desire and not by any sick languishing to construct beautiful\r\nmosaics or melodious descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe English are not a nation of prose-writers. Arnold reminded us often\r\nenough that we lacked the balance, the sense of the centre, the facility\r\nin the use of right reason; and Mr. Belloc has continued his arguments.\r\nBut Mr. Belloc has in his blood that touch of the Latin and in his mind\r\nthat sense of the centre, of a European life which corrects the English\r\nwaywardness. It is with no hesitation that we call him--subject to the\r\ncorrection of time, wherefrom no critic is exempt--the best writer of\r\nEnglish prose since Dryden.\r\n\r\nSome one said once that were Shakespeare living now he would be writing\r\narticles for the leader-page of the _Daily Mail_. As Shakespeare is not\r\nliving now, his place, of course, is filled by Mr. Charles Whibley. But\r\nthere is some sense in the apparently silly remark. The column of the\r\nmorning paper has, without doubt, provoked the creation of a new form\r\nand has brought forth a renaissance of the essay. If Shakespeare would\r\nnot have written for the daily papers, Bacon unquestionably would have\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\nIn a band of essayists who have been made or influenced by this\r\nopportunity, Mr. G. K. Chesterton, Mr. G. S. Street, Mr. E. V. Lucas,\r\nand a host of others, Mr. Hilaire Belloc is unchallengeably supreme. It\r\nis stupid to suppose, as some still do, that art and literature are not\r\nthus conditioned by the almost mechanical needs of the day. To protest\r\nthat our writers should not be influenced by the special features of the\r\nnewspaper would be to condemn Shakespeare for his conformity with the\r\nneeds of the apron-stage or Dickens for publishing his novels in parts.\r\n\r\nA mind of a character so actual as Mr. Belloc's is inevitably attracted\r\nby such an opportunity. The discerning reader will find the crown and\r\nbest achievement of all his varied work in the seven volumes of essays\r\nwhich he has published.\r\n\r\nThese volumes contain no fewer than 256 separate and distinct essays.\r\n(The essay _On the Traveller_ which was included in _On Anything_\r\nappears again, for some reason, as _The Old Things_ in _First and\r\nLast_, and is not here counted twice.) One is reduced to jealousy of the\r\nmere physical energy which could sit down so often to a new beginning:\r\nthe variety and power of the essays command our utmost admiration.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of travel and of country make up a great part of them: for\r\nthis is our author's own subject, if it be possible to select one from\r\nthe rest. But the rest of them range from the study of history and the\r\nhabits of the don, to the habits of the rich and the strange\r\nadvertisements that come, through the post, even to the least considered\r\nof us. You can only take his own words, the central point of his\r\nexperience, a very comforting and happy philosophy:\r\n\r\n     The world is not quite infinite--but it is astonishingly full. All\r\n     sorts of things happen in it. There are all sorts of men and\r\n     different ways of action and different goals to which life may be\r\n     directed. Why, in a little wood near home, not a hundred yards\r\n     long, there will soon burst, in the spring (I wish I were there!),\r\n     hundreds of thousands of leaves and no one leaf exactly like\r\n     another. At least, so the parish priest used to say, and though I\r\n     have never had the leisure to put the thing to the proof, I am\r\n     willing to believe that he was right, for he spoke with authority.\r\n\r\nThat is the impression given by these essays, the impression of the\r\nman's character. He seems to have a boundless curiosity, a range of\r\nobservation, which, if not infinite, is at least astonishingly full. He\r\ndoes not write from the mere desire of covering paper, though sometimes\r\nhe flourishes in one's face almost insolently the necessity he is in of\r\nsetting down so many words as will fill a column in tomorrow's paper.\r\nBut this insolence is rendered harmless by the fertility of his\r\nimagination and his inexhaustible invention.\r\n\r\nThe patch of purple is not rare in his writings. He says in _The Path to\r\nRome_:\r\n\r\n     ... But for my part, I think the best way of ending a book is to\r\n     rummage about among one's manuscripts till one has found a bit of\r\n     Fine Writing (no matter upon what subject), to lead up the last\r\n     paragraphs by no matter what violent shocks to the thing it deals\r\n     with, to introduce a row of asterisks, and then to paste on to the\r\n     paper below these the piece of Fine Writing one has found.\r\n\r\nThis reads like a frank confession of the way in which the last page of\r\n_Danton_ came to have its place. But who dare say that Mr. Belloc is not\r\njustified of his Fine Writing?\r\n\r\nIt does not come like the purple patches (or lumps) in Pater and the\r\n\"poetry\" in the prose and verse of Mr. Masefield: as though the author\r\nsaid to himself, \"God bless my soul, this is getting dull. I must\r\npositively do something and that at once.\" Mr. Belloc's fine writing\r\nseems to spring from an almost physical zest in the use of words and\r\nimages, to be the result of a bodily exaltation, the symbol of an\r\nenthusiastic mind and an energetic pen. No matter by what violent shocks\r\nthe author proceeds from Danton to Napoleon, that concluding passage,\r\nending with the shining and magniloquent phrase, \"the most splendid of\r\nhuman swords,\" is a glorious piece of writing.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time (and more frequently than the inexperienced would dare\r\nto suppose) this zest in the world and its contents, in the normal and\r\ninsoluble problems of life, breaks into passages of sheer beauty. One\r\nmay be quoted from an essay called _The Absence of the Past_:\r\n\r\n     There was a woman of charming vivacity, whose eyes were ever ready\r\n     for laughter, and whose tone of address of itself provoked the\r\n     noblest of replies. Many loved her: all admired. She passed (I will\r\n     suppose) by this street or by that; she sat at table in such and\r\n     such a house, Gainsborough painted her; and all that time ago there\r\n     were men who had the luck to meet her and to answer her laughter\r\n     with their own. And the house where she moved is there and the\r\n     street in which she walked, and the very furniture she used and\r\n     touched with her hands you may touch with your hands. You shall\r\n     come into the rooms that she inhabited, and there you shall see\r\n     her portrait, all light and movement and grace and beatitude.\r\n\r\n     She is gone altogether, the voice will never return, the gestures\r\n     will never be seen again. She was under a law, she changed, she\r\n     suffered, she grew old, she died; and there was her place left\r\n     empty. The not living things remain; but what counted, what gave\r\n     rise to them, what made them all that they are, has pitifully\r\n     disappeared, and the greater, the infinitely greater, thing was\r\n     subject to a doom perpetually of change and at last of vanishing.\r\n     The dead surroundings are not subject to such a doom. Why?\r\n\r\nThat passage is like a piece of music, like a movement in a sonata by\r\nBeethoven. The chords, the volume of sound are gravely added to, till\r\nthat solemn close on a single note. It is emotion, perfectly rendered,\r\nso grave, so sincere, so restrained as to be almost inimitable. And\r\nalike in the music of the words and sentences and in the mood which they\r\nconvey it is unique in English. Not one of our authors has just that\r\nframe of mind, just that method of expressing it.\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether Mr. Belloc wrote down those two paragraphs in hot\r\nhaste or considered their periods with delicate cunning. In the end it\r\nis all the same: it is a reasonable prose, it is the expression of a\r\nthought which is common in the human mind. Consider in relation to it\r\nthat notorious piece of Pater, that reflection of the essential don upon\r\na picture which is possibly a copy and certainly not very pleasant to\r\nlook upon, the _Mona Lisa_. Pater builds up his words with as grave a\r\ncare, with as solemn an emotion, but how different is the result. Pater\r\nsought for an effect of strangeness and cracked his prose in reaching at\r\nit: his rhythm is false, his images are blurred. But Mr. Belloc,\r\ntranslating into words a deep and tender mood, has had no care save\r\nfaithfully to render a thought so common and so hard to imprison in\r\nlanguage. His writing here rings true as a bell, it is as sweet and\r\nnormal as bread or wine.\r\n\r\nAn even better example is the essay called _Mowing a Field_ which is\r\nprinted in _Hills and the Sea_. The centre of this essay (which has also\r\ndecorations in the way of anecdotes and reflections) is a true and\r\nfaithful account of the procedure to be observed in the mowing of a\r\nfield of grass. Here you can see a most extraordinary power of conveying\r\ninformation in a pleasing manner. It would not be a bad thing to read\r\nthis essay first if one had the intention of engaging in such exercise,\r\nfor the instruction seems to be sound. Mr. Belloc touches hands very\r\neasily with the old Teachers who wrote their precepts in rhyme: such\r\nteachers, that is, as had good doctrine to teach, not such as the\r\nsophisticated Vergil, whose very naif _Georgics_ are said to lead to\r\nagricultural depression wherever men follow the advice they contain.\r\n\r\nTake this passage from that delicate and noble essay:\r\n\r\n     There is an art also in the sharpening of a scythe and it is worth\r\n     describing carefully. Your blade must be dry, and that is why you\r\n     will see men rubbing the scythe-blade with grass before they whet\r\n     it. Then also your rubber must be quite dry, and on this account it\r\n     is a good thing to lay it on your coat and keep it there during all\r\n     your day's mowing. The scythe you stand upright, with the blade\r\n     pointing away from you, and you put your left hand firmly on the\r\n     back of the blade, grasping it: then you pass the rubber first down\r\n     one side of the blade edge and then down the other, beginning near\r\n     the handle and going on to the point and working quickly and hard.\r\n     When you first do this you will, perhaps, cut your hand; but it is\r\n     only at first that such an accident will happen to you.\r\n\r\n     To tell when the scythe is sharp enough this is the rule. First the\r\n     stone clangs and grinds against the iron harshly; then it rings\r\n     musically to one note; then, at last, it purrs as though the iron\r\n     and the stone were exactly suited. When you hear this, your scythe\r\n     is sharp enough; and I, when I heard it that June dawn, with\r\n     everything quite silent except the birds, let down the scythe and\r\n     bent myself to mow.\r\n\r\nThat is a piece of prose which is at once practical and beautiful. It\r\nis sound advice to a man who would mow a meadow, and the soundness of it\r\nis in no way hurt by the last sentence, which delights the ear and which\r\nneed not be read by the truly earnest.\r\n\r\nIt is a style which conveys emotion and it is also a style which can be\r\nused perfectly to describe. We may refer, at least, as an example, to\r\nthe careful and exact account of the appearance and utility of the\r\nMediterranean lateen-sail which occurs at the beginning of _Esto\r\nPerpetua_, a piece of writing which enchants the reader with its beauty\r\nand its practical sense.\r\n\r\nConsider, too, that light and graceful composition of a different\r\ncharacter, equally perfect in beauty, the dialogue _On the Departure of\r\na Guest_, in the book called _On Nothing and Kindred Subjects_. Youth\r\nleaves the house of his Host and apologizes for removing certain\r\nproperty of his, which the Host may have thought, from its long\r\ncontinuance in the house, to have been his very own: included in this\r\nproperty are carelessness and the love of women. But, says Youth, he is\r\npermitted to make a gift to his Host of some things, among them the\r\nclout Ambition, the perfume Pride, Health, and a trinket which is the\r\nSense of Form and Colour (most delicate and lovely of gifts!) And, he\r\ncontinues, \"there is something else ... no less a thing than a promise\r\n... signed and sealed, to give you back all I take and more in\r\nImmortality!\" Then occurs this passage which closes the piece:\r\n\r\n     HOST. Oh! Youth.\r\n\r\n     YOUTH (_still feeling_). Do not thank me! It is my Master you\r\n     should thank. (_Frowns._) Dear me! I hope I have not lost it!\r\n     (_Feels in his trouser pockets._)\r\n\r\n     HOST (_loudly_). Lost it?\r\n\r\n     YOUTH (_pettishly_). I did not say I had lost it! I said I hoped I\r\n     had not.... (_Feels in his great coat pocket, and pulls out an\r\n     envelope._) Ah! Here it is! (_His face clouds over._) No, that is\r\n     the message to Mrs. George, telling her the time has come to get a\r\n     wig ... (_Hopelessly_.) Do you know I am afraid I have lost it! I\r\n     am really very sorry--I cannot wait. (_He goes off._)\r\n\r\nThat passage would appear to confute a quite common notion to the effect\r\nthat Mr. Belloc, who can and does write nearly everything else, does not\r\nwrite a play because he cannot. It is not for the purpose of arguing\r\nsuch a highly abstract point that we must call attention to the exact\r\nway in which it conforms to the necessities of this kind of expression\r\nwithout losing its character, its vividness, or its rhythm.\r\n\r\nIt is admirably moulded in its expression of a feeling or a sensation,\r\nand, in this way, Mr. Belloc's style comes very nearly as close to\r\nperfection as can be expected of a human instrument. He renders his\r\nmoods, the fine shades of a transitory emotion, the solid convictions\r\nthat make up a man's life with spirit, with humour, with beauty, but,\r\nabove all, with _accuracy_.\r\n\r\nHe builds up his sentences and paragraphs with the beauty and permanency\r\nof the old barns that one may see in his own country. He does this\r\nthrough his sincerity. He does not exaggerate an emotion to catch a\r\npublic for the space of half an hour: he does not, in the more subtle\r\nway, affect a cynical or conventional disregard of the noble feelings\r\nand fine motives which do exist in man. It has been his business with\r\npatience and fidelity to seize, with skill to make enduring and\r\ncomprehensible in words, the things which do exist.\r\n\r\nHis style is a weapon or an instrument like one of those primitive but\r\nexquisitely adapted instruments which are the foundations of man's work\r\nin the world. With his use of words, he knows how to expose the\r\ntechnicalities of a battle or the transformations of the human heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE POET\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for Mr. Belloc's most copious revelation of his personality. But\r\nthis is true--that the most personal expression of all for any man is in\r\nverse: even though it be small in quantity and uneven in quality. It is\r\nas though, here, in a more rarefied and more complex form of\r\ncomposition--we will not say \"more difficult\"--some kind of effort or\r\nstruggle called out all of a man's characteristics in their intensest\r\nshape. Such emotions as a man has to express will be, perhaps not more\r\nperfectly, but at any rate more keenly, set out in verse. It gives you\r\nhis characteristics in a smaller space. This is true of nearly all\r\nwriters who have used both forms of expression. It applies--to quote\r\nonly a few--to Arnold, to Meredith, and to Mr. Hardy.\r\n\r\nNow we must admit at the outset that Mr. Belloc's verse does not satisfy\r\nthe reader, in the same sense that his prose satisfies. It is\r\nfragmentary, unequal, very small in bulk, apparently the outcome of a\r\nscanty leisure. But it is an ingredient in the mass of his writing that\r\ncannot be dismissed without discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc realizes to the full the position of poetry in life. He gives\r\nit the importance of an element which builds up and broadens the\r\nunderstanding and the spirit. He has written some, but not very much,\r\nliterary criticism; and, of a piece with the rest of thinking, he thinks\r\nof poetry as a factor in, and a symptom of, the growth and maintenance\r\nof the European mind. He would not understand the facile critics who\r\nonly yesterday dismissed this necessary element of literature as\r\nsomething which the modern world has outgrown.\r\n\r\nBut, curiously, he is a disappointing critic of Literature. His essays\r\nin this regard are, like his essays on anything else, obviously in\r\ntouch with some substratum of connected thinking, a growth which springs\r\nfrom a settled and confident attitude towards man and the world. But\r\nthey are, as it were, less in touch with it; they are more on the\r\nsurface, more accidental, less continuous.\r\n\r\nHis little--very little--essays on the verse of the French Renaissance\r\nare extremely unsatisfactory. His criticism of Ronsard's _Mignonne,\r\nallons voir si la rose_ is a little masterpiece of delicate\r\ndiscrimination:\r\n\r\n     If it be asked why this should have become the most famous of\r\n     Ronsard's poems, no answer can be given save the \"flavour of\r\n     language.\" It is the perfection of his tongue. Its rhythm reaches\r\n     the exact limit of change which a simple metre will tolerate: where\r\n     it saddens, a lengthy hesitation at the opening of the seventh line\r\n     introduces a new cadence, a lengthy lingering upon the last\r\n     syllables of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth closes a grave\r\n     complaint. So, also by an effect of quantities, the last six lines\r\n     rise out of melancholy into their proper character of appeal and\r\n     vivacity: an exhortation.\r\n\r\nThis passage, which, as a demonstration of method, is not altogether\r\nmeaningless, even without the text beside it, shows the accuracy and\r\nnicety of his criticism. And _Avril_ contains a number of similar\r\nobservations which are valuable in the extreme as aids to judgement and\r\npleasure. But the book has written all over it a confession, that this\r\nis a department of writing which the author is content, comparatively,\r\nto neglect. The essays are short and, again comparatively, they are\r\ndetached: they examine each poem by itself, not in its general aspect.\r\nAnd it is, too, a singular example of book-making: there are more blank\r\npages, in proportion to its total bulk, than one could have believed\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe rare studies dealing with poetry which one finds among his general\r\nessays also bear witness to his discrimination and determined judgement.\r\nThe essay on Jose-Maria de Heredia in _First and Last_ is a remarkable\r\nexample of these, a remarkable analysis of a poet who is, if not\r\nobscure, at least reticent and difficult to like, and in whom Mr. Belloc\r\nsees the recapturer of \"the secure tradition of an older time.\" And this\r\nessay relates the spirit of a poet to the general conception of Europe\r\nand its destiny.\r\n\r\nSuch a relation is rare. Poetry seems to lie, to an extent, apart from\r\nMr. Belloc's definite and consistent view of life. He takes other\r\npleasures, beer, walking, singing and what not, with the utmost\r\nseriousness: this he treats, at bottom, casually and disconnectedly. We\r\ncan just perceive how he links it up with his general conception of\r\nlife, but we can only just see it. The link is there, but he has never\r\nstrengthened it.\r\n\r\nAnd when we turn from his opinions on other men's poetry to his own\r\ncompositions, we find the same broad effect of casualness varied with\r\npassages of singular achievement. His verse is very small in bulk:\r\nbetween two and three thousand lines would cover as much of it as he has\r\nyet published. Within this restricted space there are numerous\r\nvariations of type, but these, in verse, are so subtle and so fluid that\r\nwe are forbidden to attempt a rigid classification.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is our impression on surveying this collection of poetry? It\r\nincludes a number of small amusing books for children, a volume called\r\n_Verses_ and a few more verses scattered in the prose, most notably (as\r\nbeing not yet collected) in _The Four Men_. The general impression is,\r\nas we have said, one of confusion and lack of order: verse, the\r\nrevealing instrument, seems to be to Mr. Belloc a pastime for moments of\r\ndispersion, and most of these poems seem to point to intervals of\r\nrefreshment, periods of a light use of the powers, rather than to the\r\nseconds of intense feeling whereof verse, either at the time or later,\r\nis the proper expression.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that little enough of this verse is dull: it\r\nnearly all has character, a distinct personal flavour in phrasing and\r\nmotive. Yet this flavour is best known to the public in its development\r\nby the first of brilliant young men to be influenced by Mr. Belloc's\r\nstyle, as apart from his ideas. We may pause a moment to examine this\r\npoint, for its own special interest and for the guide it will give us to\r\nMr. Belloc's poetry.\r\n\r\nRupert Brooke has been called too often the disciple of Dr. Donne: no\r\ncritic, so far as we are aware, has called attention to his debt to Mr.\r\nBelloc. This debt was neither complete nor immediately obvious, but it\r\nexisted. Brooke knew it, spoke of Mr. Belloc with admiration,\r\nand quoted his poems with surprising memory. Some of these\r\nwere--necessarily--unpublished and may be apocryphal: they cannot be\r\nrepeated here. The resemblance between the styles of the two men was\r\nmost noticeable in Brooke's prose: his letters from America show a touch\r\nin working and a point of view singularly close to those of Mr. Belloc.\r\nBut it is also to be discovered in his poetry. Put a few lines from\r\n_Grantchester_ beside a few lines from one of Mr. Belloc's poems of\r\nOxford and you will realize how curiously the younger man was fascinated\r\nby the older. We will quote the passages we have in mind. The first is\r\nby Brooke:\r\n\r\n   \"In Grantchester, their skins are white,\r\n    They bathe by day, they bathe by night;\r\n    The women there do all they ought;\r\n    The men observe the Rules of Thought.\r\n    They love the Good; they worship Truth;\r\n    They laugh uproariously in youth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the second is from Mr. Belloc's _Dedicatory Ode_:\r\n\r\n   \"Where on their banks of light they lie,\r\n      The happy hills of Heaven between,\r\n    The Gods that rule the morning sky\r\n      Are not more young, nor more serene....\r\n\r\n    ... We kept the Rabelaisian plan:\r\n      We dignified the dainty cloisters\r\n    With Natural Law, the Rights of Man,\r\n      Song, Stoicism, Wine and Oysters.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a difference, for two men of different character are speaking:\r\nbut there is more than the accidental resemblance that comes from two\r\nmen making the same sort of joke.\r\n\r\nBut Brooke was, in his own desire and in the estimation of others, first\r\na poet: and Mr. Belloc has written his verses, as it would seem, at\r\nintervals. The common level of them is that of excellent workmanship,\r\nthe very best are simply glorious accidents.\r\n\r\nNow the common level, if we put away the books for children which will\r\nbe more conveniently dealt with in another chapter, is represented by\r\nsuch poems as _The Birds_, _The Night_, _A Bivouac_, and a Song of which\r\nwe may quote one verse, as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"You wear the morning like your dress\r\n    And are with mastery crowned;\r\n    When as you walk your loveliness\r\n    Goes shining all around.\r\n    Upon your secret, smiling way\r\n    Such new contents were found,\r\n    The Dancing Loves made holiday\r\n    On that delightful ground.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, these poems are of a certain grace and charm, neither\r\nfalse nor exalted, pleasant indeed to say over, but without that\r\nintensity of feeling which even in a small and light verse transfigures\r\nthe written words. The carols and Catholic poems are of this delightful\r\ncharacter, curiously one in feeling with such old folk-carols as are\r\nstill preserved. One of these compositions rises to a much higher plane\r\nby a truly extraordinary felicity of phrase, one of those inspired\r\nquaintnesses which move the reader so powerfully as the nakedest pathos\r\nor the most ornate grandeur. We mean the poem _Courtesy_, where the poet\r\nfinds this grace in three pictures:\r\n\r\n   \"The third it was our Little Lord,\r\n    Whom all the Kings in arms adored;\r\n    He was so small you could not see\r\n    His large intent of Courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nThese verses are certainly, as we have said, charming. They are really\r\nmediaeval, for Mr. Belloc admires the spirit of that age from within,\r\nwhich makes truth, not from without, which makes affectation.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of poem which is jolly--it is the best term--to\r\nread and better to sing. The _West Sussex Drinking Song_, a rather\r\nobvious reminiscence of Still's famous song, is perhaps the best known\r\nbut by no means the best. (It is, however, an excellent guide to the\r\nbeers of West Sussex.) We would give this distinction to a song in _The\r\nFour Men_, which begins:\r\n\r\n   \"On Sussex hills where I was bred,\r\n    When lanes in autumn rains are red,\r\n    When Arun tumbles in his bed\r\n        And busy great gusts go by;\r\n    When branch is bare in Burton Glen\r\n    And Bury Hill is a whitening, then\r\n    I drink strong ale with gentlemen;\r\n        Which nobody can deny, deny,\r\n          Deny, deny, deny, deny,\r\n           Which nobody can deny.\"\r\n\r\nWe must speak here, however, since our space is limited, not of these\r\nsporadic and inessential excellences, but of the isolated and admirable\r\naccidents--for so they seem--which make Mr. Belloc truly a poet.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the well-known, anthologized _The South Country_;\r\nanother is a passage in the mainly humorous poem called _Dedicatory Ode_\r\nwhich we have quoted in another connexion; two occur in _The Four Men_.\r\nAll of them deal with places and country, they are all by way of being\r\nmelancholy and express the quite human sadness that goes normally with\r\nthe joy in friends and in one's own home.\r\n\r\nSuch a verse as this in praise of Sussex is inspired, sad and gracious:\r\n\r\n   \"But the men that live in the South Country\r\n      Are the kindest and most wise.\r\n    They get their laughter from the loud surf,\r\n      And the faith in their happy eyes\r\n    Comes surely from our Sister the Spring\r\n      When over the sea she flies;\r\n    The violets suddenly bloom at her feet,\r\n      She blesses us with surprise.\"\r\n\r\nThe rhythm, apparently wavering, but in reality very exact, alone\r\nreflects in this stanza the sadness which elsewhere in the poem is put\r\nmore directly. It is a delicate, ingenuous rhythm, suited most admirably\r\nto (or rather, perhaps, dictating) the unstrained and easy words.\r\n\r\nThe same mood, the same rhythm, are repeated in a poem in _The Four\r\nMen_:\r\n\r\n   \"The trees that grow in my own country\r\n      Are the beech-tree and the yew;\r\n    Many stand together,\r\n      And some stand few.\r\n    In the month of May in my own country\r\n      All the woods are new.\"\r\n\r\nBut the summit of these poems is reached in another composition in the\r\nsame book. He has set it cunningly in a description of the way in which\r\nit was written, so as to be able to strew the approaches to it with\r\nsingle lines and fragments which he could not use, but which were too\r\ngood to be lost. The poem itself runs like this:\r\n\r\n   \"He does not die that can bequeath\r\n    Some influence to the land he knows,\r\n    Or dares, persistent, interwreath\r\n    Love permanent with the wild hedgerows;\r\n        He does not die but still remains\r\n        Substantiate with his darling plains.\r\n\r\n    The spring's superb adventure calls\r\n    His dust athwart the woods to flame;\r\n    His boundary river's secret falls\r\n    Perpetuate and repeat his name.\r\n        He rides his loud October sky:\r\n        He does not die. He does not die.\r\n\r\n    The beeches know the accustomed head\r\n    Which loved them, and a peopled air\r\n    Beneath their benediction spread\r\n    Comforts the silence everywhere;\r\n        For native ghosts return and these\r\n        Perfect the mystery in the trees.\r\n\r\n    So, therefore, though myself be crosst\r\n    The shuddering of that dreadful day\r\n    When friend and fire and home are lost\r\n    And even children drawn away--\r\n        The passer-by shall hear me still,\r\n        A boy that sings on Duncton Hill.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of a robuster sort than the other poems and in a way their climax\r\nfor it expresses the same emotion. It is indeed the final movement of\r\nthe book which treats in particular of the love of Sussex, but also of\r\nthe general emotion of the love of one's own country. There is\r\nmelancholy mixed with this feeling, as with all strong affections: with\r\nit are associated the love of friends and the dread of parting from them\r\nand regret for the accomplishment of such a thing.\r\n\r\nIn these few poems, his best, Mr. Belloc seems to have expressed this\r\nmood completely and so to have shown--we have said as it were by\r\naccident--an abiding and fundamental mood. We have been constrained to\r\ncriticize his poetry much as he has criticized the poetry of others,\r\nthat is to say, sporadically and without continuity. But we have touched\r\nhere perhaps on a thing, the obscure existence of which also we\r\nindicated, the secret root that shows his poetry to be a true and native\r\ngrowth of the soil from which his other writings have sprung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STUDENT OF MILITARY AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Belloc's most important writings on the war are to be found in _Land\r\nand Water_, the _Illustrated Sunday Herald_, and _Pearson's Magazine_.\r\nTo these must be added his series of books of which only one has so far\r\nappeared--_A General Sketch of the European War_. His series of articles\r\nin _Pearson's Magazine_ has also been reprinted in book-form under the\r\ntitle _The Two Maps_.\r\n\r\nOf these his writings in _Land and Water_ are, at the present time, the\r\nmost important. Since the earliest stages of the war Mr. Belloc has\r\ncontributed to _Land and Water_ a weekly article. What is the nature of\r\nthis article? In the first place, it is a commentary on the current\r\nevents of the campaign. Mr. Belloc himself, when challenged recently to\r\ndefend his work, said very modestly (as we think)--\"My work ... is no\r\nmore than an attempt to give week by week, at what I am proud to say is\r\na very great expense of time and of energy, an explanation of what is\r\ntaking place. There are many men who could do the same thing. I happen\r\nto have specialized upon military history and problems, and profess now,\r\nwith a complete set of maps, to be doing for others what their own\r\noccupations forbid them the time and opportunity to do.\"\r\n\r\nWith part of this description we may heartily agree; with the rest we\r\nmust disagree. We agree with Mr. Belloc when he refers to his work as\r\nbeing accomplished \"at a very great expense of time and of energy.\"\r\nThere may be some who doubt the truth of this statement. There is\r\nundoubtedly a large section of the public which, led astray by that\r\ncynicism and that distrust of newspapers and journalists which a certain\r\nsection of our Press has engendered in the public, has come to regard\r\nall newspaper reports on the war as unreliable and the writings of\r\nso-called \"experts\" as mere vapourings, undertaken in the hope of\r\nassisting the circulation of the paper in which they appear rather than\r\nthe circulation of the truth. If, then, any reader be inclined to\r\ninclude Mr. Belloc in such a denunciation and to doubt that his weekly\r\ncommentary in _Land and Water_ is written as he says, \"at a very great\r\nexpense of time and of energy,\" let him turn to one of Mr. Belloc's\r\narticles, reprinted in _The Two Maps_, on \"What to Believe in War News.\"\r\n\r\nIn this article Mr. Belloc asks the question--\"How is the plain man to\r\ndistinguish in the news of the war what is true from what is false, and\r\nso arrive at a sound opinion?\" His answer to this question is that \"in\r\nthe first place, the basis of all sound opinion are the official\r\n_communiques_ read with the aid of a map.\" And to this he adds the\r\nfollowing explanation:\r\n\r\n     When I say \"the official communiques\" I do not mean those of the\r\n     British Government alone, nor even of the Allies alone, but of\r\n     _all_ the belligerents. You just read impartially the communiques\r\n     of the Austro-Hungarian and of the German Governments together with\r\n     those of the British Government and its Allies, or you will\r\n     certainly miss the truth. By which statement I do not mean that\r\n     each Government is equally accurate, still less equally full in its\r\n     relation; but that, unless you compare all the statements of this\r\n     sort, you will have most imperfect evidence; just as you would have\r\n     very imperfect evidence in a court of law if you only listened to\r\n     the prosecution and refused to listen to the defence.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc then proceeds to show what characteristics all official\r\n_communiques_ have in common, and then to outline the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the _communiques_ of each belligerent. Although not\r\none unnecessary sentence is included, this short summary of his own\r\ndiscoveries covers seven pages. The final sentence of the article is as\r\nfollows: \"Nevertheless, unless you do follow fairly regularly the Press\r\nof all the belligerent nations, you will obtain but an imperfect view of\r\nthe war as a whole.\"\r\n\r\nThis comparison of the _communiques_ of the belligerents, which is seen\r\nin these pages to be no light task, naturally forms but a small part of\r\nMr. Belloc's work; so that further proof of his own statement, that his\r\nwork necessitates the expenditure of much time and energy, need hardly\r\nbe adduced.\r\n\r\nThis slight insight into the nature of Mr. Belloc's work will also serve\r\nto emphasize the point in which we disagree with Mr. Belloc's own\r\ndescription of his work. If, let us say, a bank manager, who may be\r\nregarded as a type of citizen of considerable intelligence and leisure,\r\nwere to adopt and faithfully to pursue the methods described in this\r\narticle, the methods which Mr. Belloc himself has found it necessary to\r\nadopt, he would certainly find his leisure time swallowed up. In so far\r\nas this alone were the case, we might agree with Mr. Belloc when he says\r\nof himself--\"I ... profess now ... to be doing for others what their own\r\noccupations forbid them the time and opportunity to do.\" But our bank\r\nmanager, when he had accomplished the long process of sifting out the\r\nonly war news that is reliable (and he would be only able to accomplish\r\nthis much, be it noted, with the aid of Mr. Belloc) would still be\r\nunable, in all probability, to grasp the full meaning and importance of\r\nthat news. To do that he would need what, in common with the majority of\r\nEnglishmen, he does not possess, and what it would take him years to\r\nacquire, namely, a knowledge of military history and military science.\r\n\r\nWe see then that Mr. Belloc, in his weekly commentary in _Land and\r\nWater_, is doing for others not merely \"what their own occupations\r\nforbid them the time and opportunity to do,\" but _what they could not do\r\nfor themselves_, even had they the time and opportunity.\r\n\r\nTo undertake this task he is peculiarly qualified. In his writings on\r\nthe war, indeed, Mr. Belloc appears as an expert, in the true sense of\r\nthat much abused word. He says of himself, in the paragraph already\r\nquoted--\"I happen to have specialized on military history and problems.\"\r\nThat is again too modest an estimation of the facts. He has done far\r\nmore than merely to specialize on military history; he has given\r\nmilitary history its true place in relation to other branches of\r\nhistory. The study of history at the present time is specialized. We\r\nsubdivide its various aspects, classify facts and speak of\r\nconstitutional history, economic history, ecclesiastical history,\r\nmilitary history, and so forth. Now Mr. Belloc, in addition to his study\r\nof all the branches of history, has not merely made a special study of\r\nmilitary history, but has realized and proved, more fully than any other\r\nhistorian, of what tremendous importance is the study of military\r\nhistory in its relation to those other branches of the study of history,\r\nsuch as the constitutional and economic. \"In writing of the military\r\naspect of any movement,\" he says, \"it is impossible to deal with that\r\naspect save as a living part of the whole; so knit into national life is\r\nthe business of war.\"\r\n\r\nIn those words, \"so knit into national life is the business of war,\" Mr.\r\nBelloc has finely expressed his conception of war as one of the\r\nweightiest factors in human events. In accordance with this attitude Mr.\r\nBelloc has shown us, what no other historian has ever made clear, that\r\nthe French Revolution, \"more than any other modern period, turns upon,\r\nand is explained by, its military history.\" In the preface to his short\r\nthesis _The French Revolution_ there occurs this passage:\r\n\r\n     The reader interested in that capital event should further seize\r\n     (and but too rarely has an opportunity for seizing) its military\r\n     aspect; and this difficulty of his proceeds from two causes: the\r\n     first, that historians, even when they recognize the importance of\r\n     the military side of some past movement, are careless of the\r\n     military aspect, and think it sufficient to relate particular\r\n     victories and general actions. The military aspect of any period\r\n     does not consist in these, but in the campaigns of which actions,\r\n     however decisive, are but incidental parts. In other words, the\r\n     reader must seize the movement and design of armies if he is to\r\n     seize a military period, and these are not commonly given him. In\r\n     the second place, the historian, however much alive to the\r\n     importance of military affairs, too rarely presents them as part of\r\n     a general position. He will make his story a story of war, or\r\n     again, a story of civilian development, and the reader will fail to\r\n     see how the two combine.\r\n\r\nIn this short excerpt we catch a glimpse, not only of Mr. Belloc's\r\nattitude towards military history, but also of his method in dealing\r\nwith it; and since this aspect of Mr. Belloc's work is of such capital\r\nimportance we may perhaps quote that passage which begins on page 142 of\r\n_The French Revolution_ and is so illuminating in regard both to Mr.\r\nBelloc's attitude and to his method:\r\n\r\n     The Revolution would never have achieved its object; on the\r\n     contrary, it would have led to no less than a violent reaction\r\n     against those principles which were maturing before it broke out,\r\n     and which it carried to triumph, had not the armies of\r\n     revolutionary France proved successful in the field; but the\r\n     grasping of this mere historic fact, I mean the success of the\r\n     revolutionary armies, is unfortunately no simple matter.\r\n\r\n     We all know that as a matter of fact the Revolution was, upon the\r\n     whole, successful in imposing its view upon Europe. We all know\r\n     that from that success as from a germ has proceeded, and is still\r\n     proceeding, modern society. But the nature, the cause and the\r\n     extent of the military success which alone made this possible, is\r\n     widely ignored and still more widely misunderstood. No other signal\r\n     military effort which achieved its object has in history ended in\r\n     military disaster--yet this was the case with the revolutionary\r\n     wars. After twenty years of advance, during which the ideas of the\r\n     Revolution were sown throughout Western civilization, and had time\r\n     to take root, the armies of the Revolution stumbled into the vast\r\n     trap or blunder of the Russian campaign; this was succeeded by the\r\n     decisive defeat of the democratic armies at Leipsic, and the superb\r\n     strategy of the campaign of 1814, the brilliant rally of what is\r\n     called the Hundred Days, only served to emphasize the completeness\r\n     of the apparent failure. For that masterly campaign was followed\r\n     by Napoleon's first abdication, that brilliant rally ended in\r\n     Waterloo and the ruin of the French army. When we consider the\r\n     spread of Grecian culture over the East by the parallel military\r\n     triumph of Alexander, or the conquest of Gaul by the Roman armies\r\n     under Caesar, we are met by political phenomena and a political\r\n     success no more striking than the success of the Revolution. The\r\n     Revolution did as much by the sword as ever did Alexander or Caesar,\r\n     and as surely compelled one of the great transformations of Europe.\r\n     But the fact that the great story can be read to a conclusion of\r\n     defeat disturbs the mind of the student.\r\n\r\n     Again, that element fatal to all accurate study of military\r\n     history, the imputation of civilian virtues and motives, enters the\r\n     mind of the reader with fatal facility when he studies the\r\n     revolutionary wars.\r\n\r\n     He is tempted to ascribe to the enthusiasm of the troops, nay, to\r\n     the political movement itself, a sort of miraculous power. He is\r\n     apt to use with regard to the revolutionary victories the word\r\n     \"inevitable,\" which, if ever it applies to the reasoned, willing\r\n     and conscious action of men, certainly applies least of all to men\r\n     when they act as soldiers.\r\n\r\n     There are three points which we must carefully bear in mind when we\r\n     consider the military history of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n     First, that it succeeded: the Revolution, regarded as the political\r\n     motive of its armies, won.\r\n\r\n     Secondly, that it succeeded through those military aptitudes and\r\n     conditions which happened to accompany, but by no means necessarily\r\n     accompanied, the strong convictions and the civic enthusiasm of the\r\n     time.\r\n\r\n     Thirdly, that the element of chance, which every wise and prudent\r\n     reasoner will very largely admit into all military affairs, worked\r\n     in favour of the Revolution in the critical moments of the early\r\n     wars.\r\n\r\nThe reader who could make closer acquaintance with this aspect of Mr.\r\nBelloc's work, and it is an aspect, as has been said, of capital\r\nimportance, need only turn to the too few pages of _The French\r\nRevolution_, where he will find ample evidence not only of Mr. Belloc's\r\nunderstanding of the importance of military history, but of his vast\r\nknowledge of military science; and the same may be said of those little\r\nbooks Mr. Belloc has published from time to time on some of the\r\noutstanding battles of the past, such as _Blenheim_, _Malplaquet_,\r\n_Waterloo_, _Cressy_ and _Tourcoing_.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, then, that Mr. Belloc brings to a task which the mass of\r\nthe English public is quite incapable of undertaking for itself peculiar\r\nadvantages, in that he has combined with a long and careful study of\r\nmilitary history a thorough technical knowledge of military science.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this major and essential qualification he possesses, as\r\nthe outcome of his pursuits and experience, other minor and subsidiary\r\nthough still very necessary qualifications. In this war, as in all wars\r\nof the past, the lie of country and the fatigue of men are two of the\r\nweightiest factors; and Mr. Belloc is enormously assisted in attempting\r\na nice appreciation of these factors by the knowledge acquired in the\r\nlong pursuit of his topographical tastes and by his practical experience\r\nin the ranks of the French army.\r\n\r\nOn this latter point too much insistence should not be laid, though to\r\nignore it entirely would be as foolish as to exaggerate its importance.\r\nWe may best assess its value, perhaps, by saying that Mr. Belloc has\r\nbeen in possession for more than twenty years of certain definite\r\nknowledge which the vast majority of Englishmen have only acquired in\r\nthe past year. More than twenty years ago he learnt the elementary rules\r\nof military organization and the ordinary facts of army life which are\r\ncommon knowledge in conscript countries. In England we have remained\r\nignorant of these facts. Many of us have learnt them for the first time\r\nsince August, 1914; many of us, though we have come to a consciousness\r\nof them, will never learn them. In a passage in _A General Sketch of the\r\nEuropean War_, in which Mr. Belloc exposes \"the fundamental contrast\r\nbetween the modern German military temper and the age-long traditions of\r\nthe French service,\" though he brings into play much information that\r\nhe has doubtless acquired in more recent years, we can see shining\r\nthrough, the memory of early experiences.\r\n\r\n     This contrast [he says] appears in everything, from tactical\r\n     details to the largest strategical conception, and from things so\r\n     vague and general as the tone of military writings, to things so\r\n     particular as the instruction of the conscript in his barrack-room.\r\n     The German soldier is taught--or was--that victory was inevitable,\r\n     and would be as swift as it would be triumphant; the French soldier\r\n     was taught that he had before him a terrible and doubtful ordeal,\r\n     one that would be long, one in which he ran a fearful risk of\r\n     defeat, and one in which he might, even if victorious, have to wear\r\n     down his enemy by the exercise of a most burdensome tenacity.\r\n\r\nNo useful purpose would be served by entering here into details of the\r\nnature of Mr. Belloc's service in the French army. There occurs,\r\nhowever, in _The Path to Rome_, a short passage which is too interesting\r\nand too amusing not to quote. Arriving at Toul, Mr. Belloc is reminded\r\nof the manoeuvres of 1891:\r\n\r\n     For there were two divisions employed in that glorious and\r\n     fatiguing great game, and more than a gross of guns--to be accurate\r\n     156--and of these one (the sixth piece of the tenth battery of the\r\n     eighth--I wonder where you all are now; I suppose I shall not see\r\n     you again, but you were the best companions in the world, my\r\n     friends) was driven by three drivers, of whom I was the middle one\r\n     and the worst, having on my livret the note \"Conducteur mediocre.\"\r\n\r\nIn _Hills and the Sea_ Mr. Belloc says:\r\n\r\n     In the French Artillery it is a maxim ... that you should weight\r\n     your limber (and, therefore, your horses) with useful things alone;\r\n     and as gunners are useful only to fire guns, they are not carried,\r\n     save into action or when some great rapidity of movement is\r\n     desired.... But on the march we (meaning the French) send the\r\n     gunners forward, and not only the gunners, but a reserve of drivers\r\n     also. We send them forward an hour or two before the guns start; we\r\n     catch them up with the guns on the road; they file up to let us\r\n     pass, and commonly salute us by way of formality and ceremony. Then\r\n     they come into the town of the halt an hour or two after we have\r\n     reached it.\r\n\r\nBut of far more vital interest is that vast fund of special knowledge\r\nwhich Mr. Belloc has amassed in the indulgence of his tastes in travel\r\nand topography. Of this knowledge the evidence to be found in Mr.\r\nBelloc's writings is so voluminous and overwhelming that it is as\r\nunnecessary as it is impossible to quote freely here. A detailed\r\nexamination of Mr. Belloc's books on travel will be found in another\r\nchapter; if one point more than another needs emphasis here, it is that\r\nMr. Belloc primarily views all country over which he passes from a\r\nmilitary standpoint. To accompany Mr. Belloc on a motor run through some\r\npart of his own county of Sussex suffices to convince one of this.\r\nWhether tramping along causeways and sidepaths, or speeding over railway\r\nlines, he cannot pass through any considerable stretch of country\r\nwithout exercising his mind as to the possible advantages that might be\r\nafforded opposing armies by this or that natural formation. It is fair\r\nto say that this question, if we may call it such, has been uppermost in\r\nMr. Belloc's mind throughout every journey of an extent that he has\r\nundertaken, whether in Southern, Western or Eastern Europe. It would be\r\nfalse to imagine that the prime motive of all Mr. Belloc's journeys was\r\nto view country purely from the military standpoint, but it is fair to\r\nsay that almost the first question Mr. Belloc asks himself when he\r\nstrikes a stretch of country with which he is unfamiliar, and the\r\nquestion he repeatedly and continually asks himself as he traverses that\r\ncountry, is--\"How would the natural formation of this country aid or\r\nhinder a modern army advancing or retreating through it?\" That great\r\nstretches of country, notably in France and Belgium, have been visited\r\nby Mr. Belloc, moreover, with the definite object of viewing them from a\r\npurely military standpoint, it is almost unnecessary to state; no reader\r\nwho will turn to the pages of _The French Revolution_ or of _Blenheim_\r\nor _Waterloo_, can fail to realize as much for himself. Common sense,\r\nindeed, plays a great part in Mr. Belloc's study of history. He regards\r\nit as virtually essential that a historian who would describe the action\r\nof a great battle of the past should be in a position faithfully to\r\nreconstruct the conditions under which that battle was fought. Mr.\r\nBelloc himself has settled the vexed question of why the Prussians did\r\nnot charge at Valmy by visiting the battlefield under the conditions of\r\nthe battle and discovering that they could not have charged.\r\n\r\nThrough the vast store of knowledge acquired in this way Mr. Belloc\r\nenjoys an advantage in his treatment of the present war which cannot be\r\noverestimated. In writing of the country in which the campaigns of\r\nto-day are taking place he is not writing of country as he sees it on\r\nthe map. To him that country is not, as to the majority of Englishmen it\r\nis, a conglomeration of patches, some heavily, some lightly shaded, of\r\nlarger and smaller dots, joined and intersected by an almost meaningless\r\nmaze of thin and thick lines. To him that country is hills and vales,\r\nwoods and fields, rivers and swamps, real things he has seen and among\r\nwhich he has moved. As an example of this we may perhaps give his\r\ndescription of the line of the Argonne which occurs on page 157 of _The\r\nFrench Revolution_:\r\n\r\n     The Argonne is a long, nearly straight range of hills running from\r\n     the south northward, a good deal to the west of north.\r\n\r\n     Their soil is clay, and though the height of the hills is only\r\n     three hundred feet above the plain, their escarpment or steep side\r\n     is towards the east, whence an invasion may be expected. They are\r\n     densely wooded, from five to eight miles broad, the supply of water\r\n     in them is bad, in many parts undrinkable; habitation with its\r\n     provision for armies and roads extremely rare. It is necessary to\r\n     insist upon all these details, because the greater part of civilian\r\n     readers find it difficult to understand how formidable an obstacle\r\n     so comparatively unimportant feature in the landscape may be to an\r\n     army upon the march. It was quite impossible for the guns, the\r\n     wagons, and therefore the food and the ammunition of the invading\r\n     army, to pass through the forest over the drenched clay land of\r\n     that wet autumn save where proper roads existed. These were only to\r\n     be found wherever a sort of natural pass negotiated the range.\r\n\r\n     Three of these passes alone existed, and to this day there is very\r\n     little choice in the crossing of these hills.\r\n\r\nWe may compare with this extract a most remarkable description of\r\ncountry given by Mr. Belloc in his article on \"The Great Offensive\" in\r\nthe issue of _Land and Water_ of October 2, 1915. Describing the chief\r\nmovement in Champagne, he points out that the French advanced on a front\r\nof seventeen and a half miles from the village of Auberive to the market\r\ntown of Ville-sur-Tourbe. He continues:\r\n\r\n     The first line of the enemy's defence in this region follows for\r\n     the most part a crest.... This ridge is not an even one, nor was\r\n     the whole of it occupied by the German works. In places it had been\r\n     seized by the French during their work last February, and has been\r\n     held ever since. Generally speaking, its summits nearly reach, or\r\n     just surpass, the 200 metre contour, above the sea, but the whole\r\n     of this country lies so high that such a height only means a matter\r\n     of 150 to 200 feet above the water levels of the little muddy\r\n     brooks that run in the folds of the land. It is a country of chalk,\r\n     but not of dry, turfy chalk, like those of the English Downs;\r\n     rather a chalk mixed with clay, which makes for bad going after\r\n     rain. It is the soil over which, further to the east, the battle of\r\n     Valmy was fought, an action largely determined by the impracticable\r\n     nature of the ground when wet. On the other hand, it is a soil that\r\n     dries quickly. The country as a whole is remarkably open. There are\r\n     no hedges, and the movement of troops is covered only by scattered,\r\n     not infrequent plantations of pine trees and larches, which grow to\r\n     no great height. From any one of the observation posts along the\r\n     seventeen miles of line one sees the landscape before one as a\r\n     whole. It is the very opposite of what is called \"blind country.\"\r\n     On the east, to the right of the French positions, there runs along\r\n     the horizon the low, even-wooded ridge of the Argonne, which rises\r\n     immediately behind Ville-sur-Tourbe. Far to the east, from the\r\n     left, in clear weather one distinguishes the great mass of Rheims\r\n     Cathedral rising above the town.\r\n\r\nThis tremendous advantage which he possesses is casually mentioned by\r\nMr. Belloc in his Introduction to _A General Sketch of the European\r\nWar_, where he says:\r\n\r\n     It is even possible, where the writer has seen the ground over\r\n     which the battles have been fought (and much of it is familiar to\r\n     the author of this) so to describe such ground to the reader that\r\n     he will in some sort be able to see for himself the air and the\r\n     view in which the things were done: thus more than through any\r\n     other method will the things be made real to him.\r\n\r\nIn co-relation with these particular and highly specialized\r\nqualifications which Mr. Belloc possessed before the war, should be\r\nreckoned perhaps two other qualifications of a more general character.\r\nThe first of these is the very long and thorough training which his\r\nscholarship has necessitated in the dispassionate examination of\r\nevidence. Through years of historical study he has learnt carefully to\r\nsort out strong from weak evidence and to base his judgements only on\r\nsuch evidence as may be regarded as thoroughly reliable. A cursory\r\nglance through the pages of _Danton_ and a quite casual perusal of a few\r\nof the foot-notes in that book will leave the reader with no doubts on\r\nthis point. In course of years this careful practice naturally develops\r\ninto a habit; and the value of this habit in approaching reports of\r\nactions and statistics of prisoners or effectives may easily be grasped.\r\n\r\nThe second of these two general qualifications with which we must credit\r\nMr. Belloc is the fact of his envisagement of the possibility of this\r\nwar. Europe, Mr. Belloc argues, reposes upon the foundations of\r\nnationality. Internationalism, whether it be expressed in the financial\r\nrings of Capitalism or the world-wide brotherhoods of Socialism, is only\r\nmade possible by a harmony of the wills of the great European nations.\r\nShould a conflict of wills not merely exist but break out into\r\nexpression in war, internationalism, though outwardly so powerful, must\r\ninevitably go by the board and the ancient foundations upon which\r\nEurope rests stand poignantly revealed. Such a conflict of wills Mr.\r\nBelloc has always seen to exist between Prussia and the rest of the\r\nnations of Europe. His knowledge of their history and character led him\r\nyears ago to that idea of the Prussians which this war has shown to be\r\nthe true idea, and which we find expressed on every hand to-day with\r\nremarkable sageness after the event. This view is that which recognizes\r\nfully that the Prussian spirit, \"the soul of Prussia in her\r\ninternational relations,\" is expressed in what is called the\r\n\"Frederician Tradition,\" which Mr. Belloc has put into the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n     The King of Prussia shall do all that may seem to advantage the\r\n     kingdom of Prussia among the nations, notwithstanding any European\r\n     conventions or any traditions of Christendom, or even any of those\r\n     wider and more general conventions which govern the international\r\n     conduct of other Christian peoples.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc further explains this tradition by saying:\r\n\r\n     For instance, if a convention of international morals has\r\n     arisen--as it did arise very strongly, and was kept until recent\r\n     times--that hostilities should not begin without a formal\r\n     declaration of war, the \"Frederician Tradition\" would go counter to\r\n     this, and would say: \"If ultimately it would be to the advantage of\r\n     Prussia to attack without declaration of war, then this convention\r\n     may be neglected.\"\r\n\r\n     Or, again, treaties solemnly ratified between two Governments are\r\n     generally regarded as binding. And certainly a nation that never\r\n     kept such a treaty would find itself in a position where it was\r\n     impossible to make any treaties at all. Still, if upon a vague\r\n     calculation of men's memories, the acuteness of the circumstance,\r\n     the advantage ultimately to follow, and so on, it be to the\r\n     advantage of Prussia to break such solemn treaty, then such a\r\n     treaty should be broken.\r\n\r\nTo this he adds:\r\n\r\n     This doctrine of the \"Frederician Tradition\" does not mean that the\r\n     Prussian statesmen wantonly do wrong, whether in acts of cruelty or\r\n     in acts of treason and bad faith. What it means is that, wherever\r\n     they are met by the dilemma, \"Shall I do _this_, which is to the\r\n     advantage of my country but opposed to European and common morals,\r\n     or _that_, which is consonant with those morals but to the\r\n     disadvantage of my country?\" they choose the former and not the\r\n     latter course.\r\n\r\nThat this tradition not merely existed but was the paramount influence\r\nin Prussian foreign politics Mr. Belloc had long realized, while, at the\r\nsame time, he had been very well aware of the fatuous illusions about\r\nthemselves under which the Prussians and a great portion of the\r\nGerman-speaking peoples labour--illusions which necessarily led the\r\nGerman national will into conflict with the will of the other European\r\nnations. Proof of the fact that Mr. Belloc had long held this view of\r\nPrussia may be found by any reader of his essays, while a passage which\r\noccurs in _Marie Antoinette_ is especially illuminating:\r\n\r\n     It is characteristic of the more deplorable forms of insurgence\r\n     against civilized morals that they originate either in a race\r\n     permanently alien to (though present in) the unity of the Roman\r\n     Empire, or in those barbaric provinces which were admitted to the\r\n     European scheme after the fall of Rome, and which for the most part\r\n     enjoyed but a brief and precarious vision of the Faith between\r\n     their tardy conversion and the schism of the sixteenth century.\r\n     Prussia was of this latter kind, and with Prussia Frederick. To-day\r\n     his successors and their advisers, when they attempt to justify the\r\n     man, are compelled still to ignore the European tradition of\r\n     honour. But this crime of his, the partition of Poland, the germ of\r\n     all that international distrust which has ended in the intolerable\r\n     armed strain of our time has another character added to it: a\r\n     character which attaches invariably to ill-doing when that\r\n     ill-doing is also uncivilized. It was a folly. The same folly\r\n     attached to it as has attached to every revolt against the historic\r\n     conscience of Europe: such blindnesses can only destroy; they\r\n     possess no permanent creative spirit, and the partition of Poland\r\n     has remained a peculiar and increasing curse to its promoters in\r\n     Prussia....\r\n\r\n     There is not in Christian history, though it abounds in coincidence\r\n     or design, a more striking example of sin suitably rewarded than\r\n     the menace which is presented to the Hohenzollerns to-day by the\r\n     Polish race. Not even their hereditary disease, which has reached\r\n     its climax in the present generation has proved so sure a\r\n     chastisement to the lineage of Frederick as have proved the\r\n     descendants of those whose country he destroyed. An economic\r\n     accident has scattered them throughout the dominions of the\r\n     Prussian dynasty; they are a source everywhere of increasing danger\r\n     and ill-will. They grow largely in representative power. They\r\n     compel the government to abominable barbarities which are already\r\n     arousing the mind of Europe. They will in the near future prove the\r\n     ruin of that family to which was originally due the partition of\r\n     Poland.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Belloc, then, holding this view of Prussia, it was obvious that\r\nthe conflict of wills between Prussia and the other nations would\r\ninevitably grow so intense as some day to result in war.\r\n\r\nBriefly to recapitulate, we may say that Mr. Belloc, in his weekly\r\ncommentary in _Land and Water_, has undertaken and carried on since the\r\nbeginning of the war a task which the vast majority of the English\r\npublic is quite unable to undertake for itself. He was qualified to\r\nundertake that task, and has been enabled to carry it on by the fact\r\nthat he has combined with a deep study of military history an exact\r\nknowledge of military science; by the knowledge he has gained from\r\npractical experience of army service; by the wide acquaintance he has\r\nmade with the vast stretches of country in the indulgence of his tastes\r\nin travel and topography; by the long and thorough training he has\r\npassed through in the dispassionate examination of evidence; and,\r\nlastly, by the fact that he had long envisaged the possibility of this\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWith this brief summary we may usefully contrast Mr. Belloc's own\r\nsummary of his work already quoted in the early part of this chapter. In\r\nthis he says: \"My work ... is no more than an attempt to give week by\r\nweek, at what I am proud to say is a very great expense of time and\r\nenergy, an explanation of what is taking place. There are many men who\r\ncould do the same thing. I happen to have specialized upon military\r\nhistory and problems, and profess now, with a complete set of maps, to\r\nbe doing for others what their own occupations forbid them the time and\r\nopportunity to do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMR. BELLOC AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving contrasted these two summaries, we will leave the reader to form\r\nhis own estimate of the nature of Mr. Belloc's work and of the\r\nqualifications he brings to it. There remains to be determined the\r\nmeasure of success which has attended Mr. Belloc's \"attempt to give an\r\nexplanation of what is taking place.\" \"There are many men,\" he says,\r\n\"who could do the same thing.\" On this point we cannot argue with Mr.\r\nBelloc. He may know them: we do not. What we do know is that there are\r\nmany men who are trying to do the same thing. In saying this we have no\r\nwish to belittle either individuals or as a class those courageous\r\ngentlemen, among whom the best-known, perhaps, are Colonel Repington and\r\nColonel Maude, who are striving, and striving honestly, we believe, to\r\nprovide the readers of various papers with an intelligent explanation of\r\nthe courses taken by the different campaigns. Nor do we regard them as\r\nin any way imitators of Mr. Belloc. We merely assert that no single one\r\nof them is achieving his object so nearly as Mr. Belloc is achieving\r\nhis. This should not be understood to mean that the course of events has\r\nproved Mr. Belloc to be right more often than it has proved his\r\ncontemporaries to be right, though if it were possible to collate all\r\nthe necessary evidence, such a statement might conceivably be proved\r\ncorrect. This assertion should be understood, rather, to mean that no\r\nsingle commentary on the war, regularly contributed to any journal or\r\nnewspaper, displays those merits of dispassionate honesty, detailed\r\nexplanation and lucid exposition in so marked a degree as does Mr.\r\nBelloc's weekly commentary in _Land and Water_.\r\n\r\nWere there any necessity to adduce proof of this it would be sufficient\r\nto regard the great gulf fixed between the circulation of _Land and\r\nWater_ and any other weekly journal of the same price. It is of greater\r\nservice, however, to realize how and why Mr. Belloc surpasses his\r\ncontemporaries than to waste space and time in proving what is already\r\nan admitted fact. The two outstanding features of Mr. Belloc's work in\r\n_Land and Water_--two of the most conspicuous features, indeed, as will\r\nbe seen in the course of this book, of all his work--are his fierce\r\nsincerity and amazing lucidity. In this first characteristic we are\r\nwilling to believe that his respectable contemporaries equal though they\r\ncannot surpass him. We will suppose, though we can find no signs of it,\r\nthat they equal him in that extraordinary combination of qualifications\r\nacquired by study, travel and experience which he has been seen to\r\npossess. Even then, all other things being supposed equal, they fall far\r\nshort of him in this quality of lucidity.\r\n\r\nThis is not merely the gift of the journalist to state things plainly.\r\nIt is the gift of the Latin races which Mr. Belloc was given at his\r\nbirth: it is the furnace of thought in which Mr. Belloc has forged his\r\nprose style into a finely-tempered instrument.\r\n\r\nTwo of life's chief difficulties, it has often been said, are, first, to\r\nthink exactly, and, second, to give your thought exact expression. It is\r\nthe lot of the majority of men to know what they want to say but to be\r\nunable to say it. Many men are shy of expressing their thoughts because\r\nof the very present but indefinite feeling they have that their\r\nthoughts, though real and sound in their minds, become in some\r\nextraordinary way unreal and unsound when expressed. That this curious\r\ntransformation takes place we all know; newspaper reporters carry\r\nincontestable evidence of it in their notebooks. Few public speakers,\r\nindeed, realize how deeply in debt they are to reporters, who are\r\ntrained in the art of reproducing in their reports and conveying to the\r\npublic, not what the speaker said, but what he intended to say. And this\r\ncurious transformation of our thoughts in the process of expression from\r\nreality to unreality, from sense to nonsense; this divergence between\r\nthought and language; this disability under which we all labour, but\r\nwhich so few of us overcome, which is so common among men as almost to\r\njustify the jibe that \"language was given to men to conceal their\r\nthought,\" is due entirely, of course, to the insufficiency of our power\r\nof expression. A speaker or writer is great in proportion as his power\r\nof expression nears perfection.\r\n\r\nAccording as we are satisfied to read in print what a writer says, and\r\ndo not find it necessary to read between the lines what he intended to\r\nsay, we may regard him as possessed of lucidity of thought and lucidity\r\nof style.\r\n\r\nMany of the ideas, emotions and actions to which Mr. Belloc has given\r\nexpression in his essays are so intimate a part of the collective\r\nexperience of man as to allow each one of us to see that he has\r\nvisualized and expressed them with exactness; and so to realize that he\r\npossesses in his style a wonderful instrument.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of that instrument it has been said he can expose the\r\ntechnicalities of a battle or the transformations of the human heart.\r\nHow great is the power of that instrument is at no time so generally\r\nsusceptible to proof as when it is seen applied to facts as in the\r\nwritings of Mr. Belloc on the war, which it is proposed to examine in\r\nthis chapter. But before we enter upon our examination of the nature and\r\ninfluence of those writings, it may be well to emphasize their\r\nimportance as an example of style.\r\n\r\nIn his writings on the war, and more especially in his weekly chronicle\r\nin _Land and Water_, Mr. Belloc is not expressing views or ideas of his\r\nown; he is not writing in support of the thesis or argument; he is\r\nstating facts. He is stating the facts of military science, which may be\r\nfound in a hundred books, side by side with the facts of the war, which\r\nmay be found in a thousand official _communiques_; and he is stating\r\nboth sets of facts, so that the one set is explanatory of the other set,\r\nand so that both may be easily understood. This Mr. Belloc is only able\r\nto accomplish by virtue of his peculiar power of lucid expression.\r\n\r\nNot alone, then, in this particular, but supremely alone in this\r\nparticular, Mr. Belloc towers above other contemporary writers on the\r\nwar. He can explain as they can never explain: expound as they can never\r\nexpound: describe as they can never describe. His meaning stands clear\r\nin print while theirs must be read between the lines. He makes himself\r\nunderstood while we must make ourselves understand them.\r\n\r\nThis is the supreme power that has carried all his other powers to\r\nfruition. We do not think that \"there are many men who could do the same\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nThat this great power, tremendous as it is, is afflicted by weaknesses\r\nin practice is unfortunately true. These weaknesses arise mainly from\r\nthe clash of Mr. Belloc's overpowering honesty with the cynical attitude\r\ntowards newspapers in general which recent methods in journalism have\r\nengendered in the public. There was a time in the history of journalism\r\nwhen it was a crime to be wrong. For \"wrong\" modern journalism has\r\nsubstituted \"dull.\" In recent years competition among newspaper\r\nproprietors and editors of newspapers has not been, as in times past,\r\nfor the most reliable news or the most trustworthy views on important\r\nevents, but for the latest news and the brightest \"stories.\" The\r\nreputation for a newspaper which has been looked upon as pre-eminently\r\ndesirable is not that it should be regarded by the public as\r\nwell-informed or as expressing a sound judgment, but as pithy and\r\ninteresting. The inevitable consequence of this tendency is that the\r\ngreat mass of English daily newspapers have lost their former high place\r\nin the estimation of the public as serious and necessary institutions,\r\nand have descended to the level of an amusement. The only exceptions\r\nthat can be made from this sweeping condemnation are the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_, the _Morning Post_, the _Manchester Guardian_, and the\r\n_Westminster Gazette_. Of the rest, some are of a higher, some of a\r\nlower type, but all are virtually forms of amusement and of distraction\r\nrather than of learning and instruction. What differences exist between\r\nthem are differences of degree, not differences of kind. Some of them\r\nmay be compared to a good comedy; others to those musical plays which\r\nare less plays than exercises in the production of plays; many rank no\r\nhigher than the picture palace. The most base of all, though they rank\r\nas distractions, can scarcely be classed as amusements. They are patent\r\nmedicines. It has been well said that the _Daily Mail_ has achieved what\r\nno other paper has ever achieved, in enabling some millions of the\r\nEnglish proletariat to be whisked from the breakfast to the office table\r\nevery day of the week and to forget in the process the discomfort they\r\nundergo.\r\n\r\nViewed from the other side, the existence of this state of affairs\r\nargues a curious temper of mind in the public, which permitted and\r\nassisted, even if it did not always quite approve of its continuance.\r\nThat is to say, English people bought and read the papers which were\r\npithy and interesting, but did not imagine that they were learned or\r\ninstructive, and when, by chance, they sought some statement on which\r\nthey could place reliance, they realized that it could not be found in\r\nthe newspapers. This strange development in the attitude of the public\r\ntowards newspapers in general, real as it is, is hard to follow and\r\ndifficult to define. It was due in great measure to the fact that the\r\npublic in ever-increasing numbers was gradually ceasing to regard as\r\nreal what the newspapers regarded as real. The chief realities for the\r\nnewspapers remained the various aspects of capitalism and party\r\npolitics, when to the public eye other things already appeared more\r\nreal. The whole effect of this development may best be summed up,\r\nperhaps, in the expression, half of annoyance, half of resignation, so\r\nusual on the lips of newspaper readers: \"It says so in the paper, but\r\nwho knows how much to believe.\"\r\n\r\nSome such pass had been reached in the growing estrangement between the\r\npublic and the Press when the war broke out and the public was faced by\r\nan event of overwhelming interest. The people of England woke to a\r\ndesire for the truth and clamoured for the newspapers to give it to\r\nthem. The newspapers were helpless. They had forgotten where truth was\r\nto be found. So far as any of our modern newspaper men could remember it\r\nwas one of those antiquated encumbrances, such as wood-cuts and flat-bed\r\nmachines, which they had banished long ago. The only distinct impression\r\nof it they retained was that it had been plainly labelled \"not\r\ninteresting.\" So they met the emergency by buying a new set of type,\r\nblacker and deeper than any they had used before, and introducing the\r\npage headline.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, while the mass of the English Press was left fatuously\r\nfloundering before the spectacle of the greatest military event the\r\nworld has ever seen, Mr. Belloc set out quite simply to give the public\r\nan account, week by week, of the progress of that event which was as\r\nplain and as truthful as he could make it. That approximately a hundred\r\nthousand persons are willing to pay sixpence a week to read this account\r\nwe already know. It is inevitable, however, that a considerable\r\npercentage of Mr. Belloc's readers should approach his commentary in\r\n_Land and Water_ in the same attitude of mind as they have for so long\r\napproached the perusal of the daily newspaper. They will tend to speak\r\nof Mr. Belloc's articles as \"interesting\" or \"dull,\" forgetting that\r\ncriticism on these lines can rightly be directed only to the events of\r\nwhich Mr. Belloc is writing. For it is not Mr. Belloc's object to make\r\nthe events of the war interesting to his readers. It does not even\r\nremotely concern him whether those events are interesting or not. His\r\nsole object is to give his readers as detailed an explanation of the\r\nnature of those events and as clear an account of their progress as it\r\nis possible for him to give.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point in which Mr. Belloc's amazing lucidity is\r\nafflicted by a peculiar weakness in practice. The method which he adopts\r\nso extensively of explaining situations by means of diagrams is\r\nundoubtedly very successful. It has, however, its limitations. So long\r\nas the situation which he is concerned to describe is of a simple nature\r\nit may be admirably expressed in diagrammatic form. When, however, the\r\nsituation itself is complex the diagram is also necessarily complex,\r\nwhich results, in the text of his writing, in long strings of letters or\r\nfigures which lead to almost greater confusion than would the\r\nenumeration of the objects they are intended to represent. This weakness\r\nappears very plainly in a passage in _A General Sketch of the European\r\nWar_, in which Mr. Belloc describes how the Allied force in the\r\noperative corner before Namur stood with relation to the two natural\r\nobstacles of the rivers Sambre and Meuse and the fortified zone round\r\nthe point where they met. To illustrate the position of the Allied\r\nforce he draws a diagram which is excellently clear. In describing this\r\ndiagram, however, he falls into difficulties which may be seen very\r\nplainly in the following extract in which he describes the French plan:\r\n\r\n     Now, the French plan was as follows. They said to themselves:\r\n     \"There will come against us an enemy acting along the arrows VWXYZ,\r\n     and this enemy will certainly be in superior force to our own. He\r\n     will perhaps be as much as fifty per cent. stronger than we are.\r\n     But he will suffer under these disadvantages:\r\n\r\n     \"The one part of his forces, V and W, will find it difficult to act\r\n     in co-operation with the other part of his forces, Y and Z, because\r\n     Y and Z (acting as they are on an outside circumference split by\r\n     the fortified zone SSS) will be separated, or only able to connect\r\n     in a long and roundabout way. The two lots, V and W, and Y and Z,\r\n     could only join hands by stretching round an awkward angle--that\r\n     is, by stretching round the bulge which SSS makes, SSS being the\r\n     ring of forts round Namur. Part of their forces (that along the\r\n     arrow X) will further be used up in trying to break down the\r\n     resistance of SSS. That will take a good deal of time. If our\r\n     horizontal line AB holds its own, naturally defended as it is,\r\n     against the attack from V and W, while our perpendicular line BC\r\n     holds its own still more firmly (relying on its much better natural\r\n     obstacle) against YZ, we shall have ample time to break the first\r\n     and worst shock of the enemy's attack, and to allow, once we have\r\n     concentrated that attack upon ourselves, the rest of our forces,\r\n     the masses of manoeuvre, or at any rate a sufficient portion of\r\n     them, to come up and give us a majority in _this_ part of the\r\n     field.\"\r\n\r\nAlongside these slight criticisms we may mention, perhaps, another\r\ncriticism which has been publicly levelled against Mr. Belloc's writings\r\non the military aspect of the present war. The issue of the _Daily Mail_\r\nof September 6, 1915, contained an article in which Mr. Belloc was\r\ncharged with grave errors of judgement. The gist of this article was\r\nthat Mr. Belloc had regarded an enemy offensive in the West in the\r\nspring of 1915, as certain to take place, whereas, in point of fact, the\r\nGermans made their great effort against the Russians in the East. This\r\nwas the chief charge brought against Mr. Belloc; and to it were added a\r\nnumber of lesser charges of which the majority were perfectly just,\r\nshowing how in this place and in that Mr. Belloc had overrated one\r\nfactor or underrated another.\r\n\r\nWith this criticism it is unnecessary to concern ourselves further than\r\nto note the nature of Mr. Belloc's reply, which appeared in _Land and\r\nWater_ on September 18, 1915:\r\n\r\n     There is in such an indictment as this [he says] nothing to\r\n     challenge, because I would be the first, not only to admit its\r\n     truth, but, if necessary, to supplement the list very lengthily. To\r\n     write a weekly commentary upon a campaign of this magnitude--a\r\n     campaign the facts of which are concealed as they have been in no\r\n     war of the past--is not only an absorbing and very heavy task, but\r\n     also one in which much suggestion and conjecture are necessarily\r\n     doubtful or wrong, and to pursue it as I have done steadily and\r\n     unbrokenly for so many months has tried my powers to the utmost.\r\n\r\n     But I confess that I am in no way ashamed of such occasional errors\r\n     in judgment and misinterpretations, for I think them quite\r\n     unavoidable. They will be discovered in every one of the many\r\n     current commentaries maintained upon the war throughout the Press\r\n     of Europe and even in the calculations of the General Staffs. Nay,\r\n     I will now add to the list spontaneously: In common with many\r\n     others, I thought that an invasion of Silesia was probable last\r\n     December. At the beginning of the war I believed that the French\r\n     operations in Lorraine would develop towards the north--an opinion\r\n     which will be found registered many months later in the official\r\n     records recently published. In the matter of numbers my early\r\n     estimates exaggerated the proportion of wounded to killed, while\r\n     only a few weeks ago I guessed for the number of German prisoners\r\n     in the West a number which subsequent official information conveyed\r\n     to me proved to be erroneous by between 17 and 18 per cent. I long\r\n     worked on the idea that the line from Ivangorod to Cholm was a\r\n     double line--a matter of some importance last July. I have since\r\n     found that it was single. The total reserve within and behind Paris\r\n     which decided the battle of the Marne was, I believe (though the\r\n     matter is not yet public), less large than I had suspected, and the\r\n     figures I gave would rather include the Sixth Army as well as the\r\n     Army of Paris. A few weeks ago I suggested that there was\r\n     difficulty in moving a great body of men rapidly across the Upper\r\n     Wierpz. Yet the movement, when it was made, might fairly be\r\n     described as rapid. At any rate, the aid lent to the Archduke came\r\n     more promptly than had seemed possible. I certainly thought, though\r\n     I did not say so in so many words, that the capture of the\r\n     bridgehead at Friedrichstadt would involve an immediate and\r\n     successful advance by the enemy upon Riga, and in this opinion, I\r\n     believe, no single authority, enemy or ally, differed. What has\r\n     caused the check to the enemy advance here for ten full days no one\r\n     in the West can tell, nor, for that matter, does any news from\r\n     Russia yet enlighten us.\r\n\r\nTo this criticism of the writer in the _Daily Mail_ Mr. Belloc's reply\r\nis so final and complete that any addition would be out of place. It is\r\nvery necessary, however, that we should devote careful consideration to\r\nthe facts which prompted the publication of this criticism; and this\r\nwill be done in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMR. BELLOC THE PUBLICIST\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as this article in the _Daily Mail_ was confined to an exposure\r\nof Mr. Belloc's errors in judgement, it may be regarded as a piece of\r\nlegitimate and fair, if foolish, criticism. But the irrelevant jeering\r\nwhich the article also contained, and, even more, the manner in which\r\nthe article was given publication (accompanied, as it was, by the\r\ncirculation of posters bearing the words \"Belloc's Fables\"), constituted\r\nnothing short of a violent personal attack. To understand how such an\r\nattack came to be made it is sufficient to possess an acquaintance with\r\nthe methods of Carmelite House or a knowledge of the personality of Lord\r\nNorthcliffe--a subject on which we could enlarge. It will better suit\r\nthe present purpose, however, to give Mr. Belloc's own explanation of\r\nthe reason why this attack was made upon him. In his \"Reply to\r\nCriticism,\" before proceeding to the part which has been quoted in the\r\nforegoing chapter, he says:\r\n\r\n     It has been the constant policy of this paper to avoid controversy\r\n     of any kind, both because the matters it deals with are best\r\n     examined as intellectual propositions and because the increasing\r\n     gravity of the time is ill-suited for domestic quarrel. I none the\r\n     less owe it to my readers to take some notice of the very violent\r\n     personal attack delivered by the Harmsworth Press some ten days ago\r\n     upon my work in this journal. I owe it to them because I should\r\n     otherwise appear to admit unanswered the depreciation of my work in\r\n     this paper, but, still more, because the incident would give the\r\n     general public a very false impression unless its cause were\r\n     exposed. I will deal with the matter as briefly as I can. It is not\r\n     a pleasant one, and I doubt whether the principal offender will\r\n     compel me to return to it. I must first explain to my readers the\r\n     occasion of so extraordinary an outburst on the part of the\r\n     proprietor of the _Daily Mail_. I have become, with many others,\r\n     convinced that a great combination of newspapers pretending to\r\n     speak with many voices, but really serving the private interests of\r\n     one man, is dangerous to the nation. It was breeding dissension\r\n     between various social classes at a moment when unity was more\r\n     necessary than ever; pretending to make and unmake Ministers;\r\n     weakening authority by calculated confusion, but, above all,\r\n     undermining public confidence and spreading panic in a methodical\r\n     way which has already made the opinion of London an extraordinary\r\n     contrast to that of the Armies, and gravely disturbing our Allies.\r\n     They could not understand the privilege accorded to this one\r\n     person. I, therefore to the best of my power, determined to attack\r\n     that privilege, and did so. I shall continue to do so. But such\r\n     action has nothing to do with this journal, in which I have\r\n     hitherto avoided all controversy.\r\n\r\nNow this matter, as Mr. Belloc rightly says, is not a pleasant one, and\r\nwe owe some apology both to Mr. Belloc and the public for returning to\r\nit here. It forms, however, so noteworthy an example of that aspect of\r\nMr. Belloc and his work which it is proposed to examine in this chapter\r\nthat any consideration of that aspect without some mention of this\r\nunpleasant affair would necessarily be incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of mind expressed by Mr. Belloc in this explanation should\r\nbe carefully noted. In this he appears, not, as we have seen him in the\r\nprevious chapter, as the exponent of intellectual propositions, but as\r\nthe champion of an opinion of his own. He is here expressing and\r\nupholding his particular view of the necessity, during the war, of unity\r\namong social classes and of the strengthening of public confidence. This\r\nview of his proceeds from two co-related causes; the first, his\r\nconception of the nature of the war, and, second, his knowledge of the\r\npart played in government by public opinion.\r\n\r\nThese two causes must be examined separately.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc has made clear his conception of the nature of the war in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n     The two parties are really fighting for their lives; that in Europe\r\n     which is arrayed against the Germanic alliance would not care to\r\n     live if it should fail to maintain itself against the threat of\r\n     that alliance. It is for them life and death. On the other side,\r\n     the Germans having propounded this theory of theirs, or rather the\r\n     Prussians having propounded it for them, there is no rest possible\r\n     until they shall either have \"made good\" to our destruction, or\r\n     shall have been so crushed that a recurrence of the menace from\r\n     them will for the future be impossible.... The fight, in a word, is\r\n     not like a fight with a man who, if he beats you, may make you sign\r\n     away some property, or make you acknowledge some principle to which\r\n     you are already half-inclined; it is like a fight with a man who\r\n     says, \"So long as I have life left in me, I will make it my\r\n     business to kill you.\" And fights of that kind can never reach a\r\n     term less absolute than the destruction of offensive power in one\r\n     side or the other. A peace not affirming complete victory in this\r\n     great struggle could, of its nature, be no more than a truce.\r\n\r\nThe second cause, Mr. Belloc's knowledge of the important part played by\r\npublic opinion in government, he has expressed in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     The importance of a sound public judgment upon the progress of the\r\n     war is not always clearly appreciated. It depends upon truths which\r\n     many men have forgotten, and upon certain political forces which,\r\n     in the ordinary rush and tumble of professional politics, are quite\r\n     forgotten. Let me recall those truths and those forces.\r\n\r\n     The truths are these: that no Government can effectively exercise\r\n     its power save upon the basis of public opinion. A Government can\r\n     exercise its power over a conquered province in spite of public\r\n     opinion, but it cannot work, save for a short time and at an\r\n     enormous cost in friction, counter to the opinion of those with\r\n     whom it is concerned as citizens and supporters. By which I do not\r\n     mean that party politicians cannot act thus in peace, and upon\r\n     unimportant matters. I mean that no kind of Government has ever\r\n     been able to act thus in a crisis.\r\n\r\n     It is also wise to keep the mass of people in ignorance of\r\n     disasters that may be immediately repaired, or of follies or even\r\n     vices in government which may be redressed before they become\r\n     dangerous.\r\n\r\n     It is always absolutely wise to prevent the enemy in time of war\r\n     from learning things which would be an aid to him. That is the\r\n     reason why a strict censorship in time of war is not only useful,\r\n     but essentially and drastically necessary. But though public\r\n     opinion, even in time of peace, is only in part informed, and\r\n     though in time of war it may be very insufficiently informed, yet\r\n     upon it and with it you govern. Without it or against it in time of\r\n     war you cannot govern.\r\n\r\n     Now if during the course of a great war men come quite to misjudge\r\n     its very nature, the task of the Government would be strained some\r\n     time or other in the future to breaking point. False news, too\r\n     readily credited, does not leave people merely insufficiently\r\n     informed, conscious of their ignorance, and merely grumbling\r\n     because they cannot learn more, it has the positive effect of\r\n     putting them into the wrong frame of mind, of making them support\r\n     what they should not support, and neglect what they should not\r\n     neglect.\r\n\r\nThe view, then, which Mr. Belloc holds, and which these two factors\r\ncombine to form, is one of enormous importance. This view is the key to\r\nall Mr. Belloc's writings on the political aspect of the war. He has\r\nexpressed it over and over again, but never in more solemn terms than in\r\nthe following passage. After showing the existence of the political\r\neffect of the German advance to the borders of Russia, he points out how\r\nnecessary it is to control, by public authority and through our own\r\nprivate wills, any corresponding political effect in England:\r\n\r\n     If, here, the one territory of the three great Allies not invaded\r\n     [he says] any insanity of fear be permitted, or any still baser\r\n     motive of saving private fortune by an inconclusive peace, then the\r\n     political effect at which the enemy is aiming will indeed have been\r\n     achieved. These things are contagious. We must root out and destroy\r\n     the seed of that before it grows more formidable. If we do not, we\r\n     are deliberately risking disaster. But be very certain of this:\r\n     That if by whatever lack of judgment, or worse, an inconclusive\r\n     peace be arranged, this country alone of the great alliance will,\r\n     perhaps unsupported, be the target of future attack....\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to show how the enemy's great offensive through Poland\r\nbegan in April, 1915, and throughout the summer failed and failed and\r\nfailed. He concludes:\r\n\r\n     It is not enough to know these things as a proposition in\r\n     mathematics or as a problem in chess may be known. They must enter\r\n     into the consciousness of the nation; and this they will not do if\r\n     the opposite and false statement calculated to spread panic and to\r\n     destroy judgment be permitted to work its full evil unchecked by\r\n     public authority.\r\n\r\nThese passages will suffice to show not only that Mr. Belloc works with\r\nan object, but also the very important nature of that object. In his own\r\nwords, he works \"for the instruction of public opinion.\" His whole\r\ndesire is to elucidate for the general public who have not the\r\nadvantages of his knowledge and pursuits, events which are both puzzling\r\nand urgent. In his commentary in _Land and Water_ he deals with those\r\nproblems which belong of their nature to the military aspect of the war,\r\nand we have seen how extraordinarily qualified he is to undertake that\r\ntask as well as with what marked success he has accomplished it. His\r\nwritings on the political aspect of the war are to be found chiefly in\r\nthe _Illustrated Sunday Herald_, while many articles which he has\r\ncontributed at various times to other journals and newspapers are of a\r\nsimilar character.\r\n\r\nIn so far as he is writing, as he is in these articles, on general\r\ntopics of the day for the public of the day, Mr. Belloc is a journalist.\r\nIn its former restricted meaning the word \"journalist\" expressed this.\r\nTo-day, however, we include under the designation of journalist all\r\nthose workers in the editorial departments of newspaper offices who,\r\nthough skilled in various ways, are not necessarily writers at all. In\r\nreferring, then, to Mr. Belloc as a journalist we are using the term in\r\nits older and more restricted sense: in the sense in which the term was\r\nemployed when journalism was a profession and not a trade, when the\r\nnewspaper was not merely an instrument to further the ends of a\r\ncapitalist or syndicate, but a means of communicating to the public the\r\nviews of an individual or group of individuals, each of whom was\r\nprepared to accept personal responsibility for the views he expressed.\r\n\r\nThe journalist in this sense is a rare figure to-day: so rare, indeed,\r\nthat we have forgotten he is a journalist and invented a new name for\r\nhim. In the field of journalism as it is at the present time it is\r\npossible to count on the fingers of one hand the number of men who write\r\nconstantly on general topics of the day and sign what they write, thus\r\naccepting personal responsibility for the views they express and not\r\nleaving that responsibility with the newspaper in which their views\r\nappear. Every weekly or monthly journal as well as the greater number of\r\ndaily newspapers contain, it is true, signed articles. The leader-pages\r\nof the halfpenny dailies make a feature nearly every day of one or more\r\nsigned articles. But these articles, in the main, deal only with\r\nsubjects on which the writer who signs his name is a specialist. They\r\nare written by men who happen to possess special knowledge of some\r\nsubject which is of pronounced interest to the public owing to the\r\ncourse of events at the moment. For instance, when the Germans were on\r\nthe point of entering Warsaw, articles dealing with various aspects of\r\nthe city, its history, character and buildings, appeared in nearly every\r\nnewspaper: and the better articles of this nature were written and\r\nsigned by men who possessed an intimate knowledge of the subject on\r\nwhich they were writing. In the same way, all signed criticism,\r\nliterary, dramatic or musical, which appears in the columns of the\r\nnewspapers of to-day is, or professes to be, the work of specialists.\r\nMany of the larger newspapers, indeed, pay retaining fees or salaries\r\nand give staff appointments to such specialists. Thus, the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ has as its literary specialist Mr. W. L. Courtney, its\r\nmusical specialist Mr. Robin H. Legge, its business specialist Mr. H. E.\r\nMorgan.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice, then, of newspapers at the present time to make\r\npersonally responsible for the opinions they express those who write in\r\ntheir columns on subjects which, though of great interest and\r\nimportance, can of their nature only concern certain classes of the\r\ncommunity. It should be noted, however, as perhaps the most curious\r\nanomaly among the mass of anomalies which constitute modern journalism,\r\nthat the newspapers do not insist upon this personal responsibility of\r\nthe writer in their treatment of those matters which concern not one\r\nclass but every class of the community. What the newspaper insists upon,\r\non the ground, presumably, that it is right and natural, in the minor\r\naffairs of life, it entirely ignores in the major matters of life. While\r\nit insists, for example, that the writer who expresses an opinion in its\r\ncolumns on the ludicrous inadequacy of the Promenade Concerts shall\r\naccept personal responsibility for that opinion, it allows views and\r\nopinions on such vital matters as the sovereignty of Parliament, the\r\ninvincibility of Capitalism and the immorality of Trades Unionism to be\r\nexpressed anonymously.\r\n\r\nThis practice is now firmly established. These anonymous opinions are\r\nthe \"opinions of the paper.\" But what does that phrase mean? A newspaper\r\nitself, as a mere material object, is incapable of forming or holding an\r\nopinion. Some person, or group of persons, must form and hold and be\r\nready to accept the responsibility for the expression of these \"opinions\r\nof the paper.\" And since the ultimate responsibility can fall on nobody\r\nbut the proprietor or proprietors of the papers, these anonymous\r\nopinions must properly be regarded as the opinions of the capitalist or\r\nsyndicate owning the paper in which they appear. In other words, the\r\nopinions anonymously expressed in the leading articles of the _Daily\r\nNews_ can only be the opinions of Messrs. Cadbury: of the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ of Lord Burnham or the Lawson family: in the _Manchester\r\nGuardian_ of Mr. C. P. Scott and his fellow-proprietors: in the _Morning\r\nPost_ of Lady Bathurst: in the _Daily Mail_ of Lord Northcliffe and the\r\nHarmsworth family.\r\n\r\nOf this system of purveying to the public opinions which, by an absurd,\r\nillogical and pernicious tradition, are supposed to be those of the\r\npublic, but which, in reality, are those either of a single capitalist\r\nor syndicate, Mr. Belloc is not merely the avowed enemy but the most\r\nactive enemy. It was his persistently inimical attitude, ruthlessly\r\nmaintained, which evoked the angry personal attack made upon him by Lord\r\nNorthcliffe; and we have seen how Mr. Belloc explains, justifies and\r\nmaintains his attitude. In this we see his enmity avowed, but we do not\r\nperhaps realize how practical and active is the expression he gives it.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, indeed, just above, that of this system he is the most\r\nactive enemy; and, in truth, we can find no other to equal him in this\r\nrespect except such as are working in co-operation with, if not under\r\nthe leadership of, Mr. Belloc. We have seen how, in so far as he is\r\nwriting on general topics of the day for the public of the day (as he is\r\ndoing, for example, in his articles which are concerned with various\r\nphases of the political aspect of the war in the _Illustrated Sunday\r\nHerald_ and other journals and newspapers), Mr. Belloc is a journalist\r\nin the older and more restricted sense of the term. It has been further\r\nshown that the journalist in this sense is a rare figure to-day, it\r\nbeing the practice of modern journalism to deal with general, as\r\ndistinct from special, topics of the day in the form of leading\r\narticles, which, in reality, contain what can only logically be regarded\r\nas the opinions of the proprietors of the newspapers in which they\r\nappear. The journalist who writes what may be called signed leading\r\narticles is so rare among us to-day that we have forgotten he is a\r\njournalist and invented a new name for him. We call him a publicist.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers of the day the number who rank as publicists is very\r\nsmall. The names that occur to one are those of Mr. G. K. Chesterton,\r\nMr. H. G. Wells, Mr. Bernard Shaw, Mr. A. G. Gardiner, Mr. E. B. Osborn\r\nand, possibly, Mr. Arnold Bennett. In addition there are a few\r\npublicists who speak through organs which they personally control, such\r\nas Mr. A. R. Orage, Mr. Sidney Webb, and Mr. Cecil Chesterton. Mr.\r\nArnold Bennett, indeed, has only occupied the position of publicist\r\nsince he has been a regular contributor to the _Daily News_, and we can\r\nonly say that, high as Mr. Bennett stands in our estimation as a\r\nnovelist and writer, we fail to see any particular in which his views on\r\npolitical and social matters of the day are of extraordinary importance\r\nto the welfare of the community at large. In a word, it seems to us that\r\nthose articles of his which from time to time occupy so prominent a\r\nposition on the leader page of the _Daily News_ might appear as fitly in\r\nthe correspondence column. Mr. G. K. Chesterton has won for himself a\r\nhigh place in contemporary letters, but it is more probable that that\r\nplace is due rather to the excellence and individuality of his writing\r\nthan to the originality of the opinions he holds. It may be said,\r\nindeed, of Mr. G. K. Chesterton, as an exceedingly competent critic has\r\nsaid of Mr. Shaw, that it is his manner of expressing his philosophy\r\nrather than his philosophy itself that will be valued by posterity. And\r\nas Mr. Shaw has expressed most of his views in his plays and prefaces\r\nrather than in the columns of the newspapers (and this is said in full\r\nremembrance of his manifold and copious letters to _The Times_), so Mr.\r\nH. G. Wells has given us his philosophy in his novels and fantasies. His\r\nappearances in the newspapers have been rare and invariably regrettable.\r\nThe two other gentlemen whose names are mentioned, Mr. E. B. Osborn and\r\nMr. A. G. Gardiner, should be classed, perhaps, rather with those other\r\nthree who are in control, more or less, of the papers in which their\r\nwritings appear, since both Mr. Osborn and Mr. Gardiner are definitely\r\nattached, the one to the _Morning Post_ and the other to the _Daily News\r\nand Leader_, of which, before the amalgamation, he was editor. This\r\nbeing the case, it is to be assumed that these two gentlemen express and\r\nsign their views in these papers because their views correspond to a\r\ndetermining extent with those of the proprietors of the papers. This\r\nmust logically be the case with Mr. Gardiner. So far as Mr. Osborn is\r\nconcerned, he occupies on the _Morning Post_ the same position as was\r\noccupied on that paper by Mr. Belloc and on the _Daily News_ in former\r\ntimes by Mr. Gilbert Chesterton. That is to say, he is an essayist of\r\nsuch standing as to make a regular contribution from him of value to the\r\nnewspaper so long as the views and opinions he expresses in those essays\r\ndo not contrast too violently with the opinions expressed in the leading\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nOf the other three gentlemen we have named, Mr. Orage, Mr. Cecil\r\nChesterton and Mr. Webb, it is difficult to speak as of individuals.\r\nThey are referred to more properly as the _New Age_, the _New Witness_,\r\nand the _New Statesman_, and their respective personalities and\r\nattitudes of mind are fitly expressed in the names of the organs through\r\nwhich they speak. All three agree in finding the times out of joint and\r\ndesiring new and better conditions of life: they differ in the\r\nstandpoints from which they approach an analysis of present conditions\r\nand in the solutions they propound. The _New Age_ is the most valuable\r\nbecause it is the most thorough. Not only is its analysis of present\r\nconditions the most acute and the most sound that we have to-day, but\r\nthe solutions it propounds to the problems it analyses are the most\r\nfearless, the most thorough and the most idealistic. The _New Witness_\r\nis equally thorough but more immediate. The scope of its analysis is not\r\nso wide. Although its views are based on principles similar to those of\r\nthe _New Age_, it is concerned more to influence the actions than the\r\nthoughts of men. Its object is to bear testimony to the wrongs that are\r\nbeing done to-day, the crimes that are committed every day against the\r\nwelfare of the community, and to cry aloud for the immediate righting of\r\nthose wrongs, the stern punishment of those crimes. Though these two\r\njournals are aiming at the same object, the methods they adopt are in\r\nalmost direct contrast. Mr. Orage looks down from the height, not of\r\nphilosophic doubt, but of philosophic certainty (where he alone feels\r\nhappy) upon the petty house of party politics, and seeks, by the magic\r\nmusic of his words and phrases, so to move and draw after him the sand\r\nof human nature on which that house is built, that it may no longer\r\nstand but fall and be banished utterly. Mr. Cecil Chesterton, on the\r\nother hand, only happy in the role of the new David, gives fearless\r\nbattle to the modern Goliath, caring no whit if at times the struggle go\r\nagainst him and he find himself hard pressed at the Old Bailey, but\r\ngleefully and dauntlessly springing at his monstrous assailant, in the\r\nhope that some day a lucky stone from his sling will find its mark.\r\nSomewhere between these two extremes stands (or wavers) the _New\r\nStatesman_, sometimes inclining more to the one, more to the other\r\nmethod. It is concerned neither entirely with the thoughts nor entirely\r\nwith the actions of men, but with each in part. Its object is so to\r\ninfluence the thoughts of men that they will find natural expression in\r\nthe clauses of beneficent Bills.\r\n\r\nThese are the publicists. As individuals they are of value to the\r\ncommunity according to the value of the views they hold and express. As\r\na class they are of value to the community because the views they hold\r\nand express, whether right or wrong, are _sincere_. In contrast with the\r\ngreat body of the Capitalist Press that expresses anonymous opinions\r\nwhich, whether sincere or not (and it can be proved that they are often\r\nquite insincere), must still necessarily aim at the maintenance and\r\nstrengthening of present social and economic conditions, these men\r\nexpress their own personal convictions as to what is wrong with the\r\nworld and how, as _they_ think, the world may be made a better place.\r\n\r\nIt is this inestimable quality of sincerity which links Mr. Belloc with\r\nthe too small band of publicists of the day. It has been said of Mr.\r\nBelloc that he is a \"man of independent mind, and, where necessary, of\r\nunpopular attitude ... his estimates, right or wrong, are his own ... he\r\ncarries a sword to grasp not an axe to grind.\" In the following chapters\r\na brief exposition of Mr. Belloc's views both of Europe and of England\r\nwill be given with a short summary of his translation of these views\r\ninto the language of practical reforms; and we shall then be able to\r\nform some estimate of Mr. Belloc's particular value to the community. In\r\nhis articles both on the military and on the political aspect of the war\r\nMr. Belloc is working, as we have seen, \"for the instruction of public\r\nopinion.\" That this is to-day true, moreover, of Mr. Belloc's whole\r\nattitude towards the public is not fully realized. Large numbers of\r\npeople have found in Mr. Belloc's war articles their only hope of sanity\r\nin the midst of distressing and unintelligible events. In the general\r\ncourse of modern life events move less rapidly, but are equally\r\nimportant, and there, too, Mr. Belloc has attempted with almost\r\npathetic lucidity to explain. His true earnestness will not be rewarded,\r\nhis true purpose will not be attained, until the thoughtful public\r\nrealizes that it can find in Mr. Belloc's historical and political\r\nwritings at large the guide to the formation of opinion and the help to\r\nsanity which it has already found in his explanations of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMR. BELLOC AND EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Mr. Belloc's literary career was in history. He took a\r\nfirst in the school of modern history at Oxford, and his first important\r\nwork was a study of the career of Danton. A study of Danton's career, be\r\nit noted, and not a biography: for this book deals more with so much of\r\nthe French Revolution as is reflected in its subject's actions than with\r\nits subject's actions in themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, as an historian that he begins and mainly as an historian\r\nthat he continues. His activities are varied, but all are related to a\r\nconception of the world, its growth and destiny, which is founded on a\r\nconception of universal history. He sees in man a political animal,\r\nwhose distinguishing function is not commerce or art, but politics.\r\nHistory is the record of man exercising this distinguishing function.\r\nOur own politics are based on the results of the exercise of this\r\nfunction in the past, and cannot be properly understood without a\r\nknowledge of the details of that exercise. To link up the argument: man\r\nis a political animal and finds his expression in the work of politics;\r\nhe can only be fitted for that work by the study of history. Mr. Belloc,\r\nthen, regards this as the most important of all studies.\r\n\r\nA casual glance at his essays will reveal some sentences or other\r\ntestifying to the strength with which this opinion is rooted in his\r\nmind. Take this from _First and Last_:\r\n\r\n     Of those factors in civic action amenable to civic direction,\r\n     conscious and positively effective, there is nothing to compare\r\n     with the right teaching and the right reading of history.\r\n\r\nOr again from _On Anything_, regarding the matter from a somewhat\r\ndifferent point of view:\r\n\r\n     History may be called the test of true philosophy, or it may be\r\n     called in a very modern and not very dignified metaphor the\r\n     object-lesson of political science, or it may be called the great\r\n     story whose interest is upon another plane from all other stories\r\n     because its irony, its tragedy and its moral are real, were acted\r\n     by real men, and were the manifestation of God.\r\n\r\nWherever you turn over these pages, you are more likely than not to find\r\nsome such earnest and emphatic sentence: this opinion is essential to\r\nMr. Belloc's life and thought. With the practical and business-like\r\nposition of the first of these quotations it is our affair to deal in\r\nthis chapter: and the more spiritual and poetic view expressed in the\r\nsecond will receive consideration in a later place.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it is our purpose to outline as briefly and as clearly\r\nas possible Mr. Belloc's conception of the growth of Europe, from the\r\nprehistoric men who knew how to make dew-pans which \"are older than the\r\nlanguage or the religion, and the finding of water with a stick, and the\r\ncatching of that smooth animal the mole,\" to the outbreak of the present\r\nwar. From this we shall omit, to a large extent, the development of\r\nEngland, which, as it is singular in Europe, is singular in Mr. Belloc's\r\nscheme of things, and must be considered separately.\r\n\r\nWe shall endeavour, as far as possible, to piece together from a great\r\nnumber of books and writings on various subjects a continuous view of\r\nEuropean history, which we believe to be Mr. Belloc's view, but which he\r\nhas never, as yet, stated all together in one place. We shall draw our\r\nmaterial from such varied sources as _Esto Perpetua_, _The Old Road_,\r\n_Paris_, _The Historic Thames_, and inevitably the essays: inevitably,\r\nfor all practical purposes, from all the books that Mr. Belloc has ever\r\nwritten. At some future time, it is very seriously to be hoped, Mr.\r\nBelloc will do this himself. It should be his _magnum opus_: \"A General\r\nSketch of European Development,\" let us suppose. In the meanwhile, we\r\nconceive that we shall serve a useful purpose if we make a consistent\r\nscheme out of the hints, allusions and detached statements which occur\r\nup and down in Mr. Belloc's books. For some such scheme, existing but\r\nunformulated, is, beyond all doubt, the solid sub-structure of all his\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nIn the essay _On History in Travel_, Mr. Belloc says: \"It is true that\r\nthose who write good guide-books do put plenty of history into them, but\r\nit is sporadic history, as it were; it is not continuous or organic, and\r\ntherefore it does not live.\" It is living, organic history that is\r\nnecessary, he would consider, to the proper understanding of present\r\nproblems and the proper furnishing of the human mind. He desires to see\r\nand grasp the development of Europe as a symmetrical whole, not as a\r\nconglomeration of unco-ordinated parts or a succession of unrelated\r\naccidents. He believes that Europe has developed from prehistoric man by\r\nway of the Roman Empire, the Christian religion, and the French\r\nRevolution, in an orderly, organic manner. He believes, far more than\r\nFreeman, in a real unity of history.\r\n\r\nAnd from this observation of continuous history he draws certain morals.\r\nHe sees, or believes that he sees, in Carthage a wealthy trading\r\nplutocracy, ruling a population averse from arms: and he sees this\r\nsociety falling to utter ruin before the Roman state, a polity of\r\npeasant proprietors with a popular army. From that spectacle he draws\r\ncertain conclusions. He sees the Roman Empire and the way in which it\r\ngoverned Europe, and from that huge organization and its mighty remains\r\nhe also draws certain lessons of wonder and reverence. From the decline\r\nof the Empire, the growth of a slave, and economically enslaved, class,\r\nthe growth of a wealthy class, he again deduces something. All these\r\nconclusions he applies constantly and unrelentingly to our own problems\r\nand institutions: he cannot forbear from mentioning imperial Rome when\r\nhe comes to discuss our war in the Transvaal. He cannot forbear from\r\nseeing the counterpart of the Peabody Yid in imperial Rome. All history\r\nis to him a living and organic whole. And as individuals can judge in\r\npresent problems what they shall do only by reference to their own\r\nexperience and what they know of that of others, so also societies and\r\nraces. _There is no guide for them but recorded history._ This\r\naccumulated experience, however, requires to be set out and interpreted.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc's view and conception of the history of Europe begins with\r\nRome. All the roads of his speculation start from that nodal point in\r\nthe story of man. Let us take a grotesque example:\r\n\r\n     Do you not notice how the intimate mind of Europe is reflected in\r\n     cheese? For in the centre of Europe, and where Europe is most\r\n     active, I mean in Britain and in Gaul and in Northern Italy, and in\r\n     the valley of the Rhine--nay, to some extent in Spain (in her\r\n     Pyrenean valleys at least)--there flourishes a vast burgeoning of\r\n     cheese, infinite in variety, one in goodness. But as Europe fades\r\n     away under the African wound which Spain suffered or the Eastern\r\n     barbarism of the Elbe, what happens to cheese? It becomes very flat\r\n     and similar. You can quote six cheeses perhaps which the public\r\n     power of Christendom has founded outside the limits of its ancient\r\n     Empire--but not more than six. I will quote you 253 between the\r\n     Ebro and the Grampians, between Brindisi and the Irish channel.\r\n\r\n     I do not write vainly. It is a profound thing.\r\n\r\nThat passage illustrates admirably how Mr. Belloc's mind, playing on all\r\nmanner of subjects, remains true to certain fixed points. In two phrases\r\nthere he gives us our starting-point: \"the public power of Christendom\"\r\nand \"the limits of its ancient Empire.\" For Rome is to him the beginning\r\nof Europe, and Christianity inherited what Rome had stored up in public\r\npower, public order, and public intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe sees in Rome the power which established a unity among the Western\r\nraces which lay already dormant in them. We can trace this idea very\r\nclearly in _Esto Perpetua_, where he speaks repeatedly of the Berbers,\r\nas having fallen easily under the power of Rome because they are \"of our\r\nown kind.\" We can trace it again inversely in _The Path to Rome_, in\r\nsuch a passage as this:\r\n\r\n     Here in Switzerland, for four marches, I touched a northern,\r\n     exterior and barbaric people; for though these mountains spoke a\r\n     distorted Latin tongue, and only after the first day began to give\r\n     me a Teutonic dialect, yet it was evident from the first that they\r\n     had about them neither the Latin order nor the Latin power to\r\n     create, but were contemplative and easily absorbed by a little\r\n     effort.\r\n\r\nIt is in this order, this power to create, that Mr. Belloc sees the\r\ngreatness of Rome and the innate gifts of our Western race. And if one\r\nobjects that a certain power of order would seem to reside also in\r\nPrussia, undoubtedly a Northern, exterior and barbaric country, Mr.\r\nBelloc would reply that the power to create was lacking, the power to\r\nmake their order living and to inform it with a spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is his opinion, we say, or rather one of the articles of his creed,\r\nthat Rome first beat and welded into unity the kindred peoples that\r\ninhabit Western Europe. What name he gives to this Western race, if any,\r\nhe has not yet explained. Professor Mueller and his contemporaries used\r\nto talk about the Indo-Germanic race, and Professor Sergi came forward\r\nwith a more plausible Mediterranean race, and all sorts of people talk\r\nwith the utmost possible vagueness about the Celtic race, that\r\nrubbish-heap of ethnological science or pretence. Whatever name he may\r\ngive to this race, or however ethnologically he may justify his\r\nconception of it, Mr. Belloc believes that it exists and that Rome first\r\ndiscovered it and gave it expression.\r\n\r\nLike all large and generalized conceptions, this idea of the Western\r\nrace is best explained in a contrast, and Mr. Belloc finds a sharp\r\nexample of such a contrast in the struggle between Rome and Carthage. He\r\nsets it out in _Esto Perpetua_:\r\n\r\n     It [the Phoenician attempt] failed for two reasons: the first was\r\n     the contrast between the Phoenician ideal and our own; the second\r\n     was the solidarity of the Western blood.\r\n\r\n     The army which Hannibal led recognized the voice of a Carthaginian\r\n     genius, but it was not Carthaginian. It was not levied, it was\r\n     paid. Even those elements in it which were native to Carthage or\r\n     her colonies must receive a wage, must be \"volunteer\"; and\r\n     meanwhile the policy which directed the whole from the centre in\r\n     Africa was a trading policy. Rome \"interfered with business\"; on\r\n     this account alone the costly and unusual effort of removing her\r\n     was made.\r\n\r\n     The Europeans undertook their defence in a very different spirit:\r\n     an abhorrence of this alien blood welded them together: the allied\r\n     and subjugated cities which had hated Rome had hated her as a\r\n     sister.\r\n\r\n     The Italian confederation was true because it rested on other than\r\n     economic supports. The European passion for military glory survived\r\n     every disaster, and above all that wholly European thing, the\r\n     delight in meeting great odds, made our people strangely stronger\r\n     for defeat.\r\n\r\nIt is in the European spirit, the spirit of \"our people,\" that Mr.\r\nBelloc finds the mission and the justification of Rome. It is on a\r\nbelief in the reality of this spirit that he founds his views of all\r\nsubsequent developments, of our own present and of our future. The work\r\nof Rome has been minimized in common estimation by our extraordinary\r\nhabit of telescoping the centuries and viewing history, as we say, in a\r\nperspective. There is no perspective in a right view of history: the\r\ncenturies do not diminish in length as they recede from our own day. The\r\nperception of this very simple fact has not come to many of our\r\nhistorians or to any of our politicians. It should be, indeed, the first\r\nsentence in every school history-book, and the don should begin each\r\ncourse of lectures with it.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the overlooking of so elementary a maxim are fairly\r\nclear. Time simplifies. The later centuries are more full of detail, and\r\nthat detail is more confused: much of it, moreover, relates more\r\ndirectly to the urgent detail of our own life than the similar events of\r\nearlier times. But for a sound conception of the historical development\r\nof the world, we must make an effort to overcome these delusive\r\ninfluences: we must realize that from the accession of Augustus to, say,\r\nthe death of Julian the Apostate was as long a period of time as the\r\nperiod from the accession of Queen Elizabeth to the death of Edward VII.\r\nOnly a false perspective has so telescoped these years together as to\r\nmake them seem a short and rapid period of decline, filled up with wars,\r\nmassacres and human misery. Gibbon has given the greatest weight of\r\nauthority to these errors and shown the Empire as a period of decay and\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n     Under the reign of these monsters [he says] the slavery of the\r\n     Romans was accompanied with two peculiar circumstances, the one\r\n     occasioned by their former liberty, the other by their extensive\r\n     conquests, which rendered their condition more wretched than that\r\n     of the victims of tyranny in any other age or country.[1]\r\n\r\nEven Mommsen closed his history of the Republic with the gloomy\r\nassertion that Caesar could only secure for the dying ancient world a\r\npeaceful twilight.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, during the first four centuries, the Empire was the\r\nmost successful, satisfactory and enduring political institution which\r\nthe world has yet seen, and a recognition of this is essential\r\nto the proper understanding of Mr. Belloc's theories. We should, as he\r\nsays, attempt \"to stand in the shoes of the time and to see it as must\r\nhave seen it the barber of Marcus Aurelius or the stud-groom of\r\nSidonius' palace.\"\r\n\r\n     We know what was coming [he continues],[2] the men of the time knew\r\n     it no more than we can know the future. We take at its own estimate\r\n     that violent self-criticism which accompanies vitality, and we are\r\n     content to see in these 400 years a process of mere decay.\r\n\r\n     The picture thus impressed upon us is certainly false. There is\r\n     hardly a town whose physical history we can trace, that did not\r\n     expand, especially towards the close of that time.\r\n\r\n     ... Our theory of political justice was partly formulated, partly\r\n     handed on, by those generations; our whole scheme of law, our\r\n     conceptions of human dignity and of right.... If a man will stand\r\n     back in the time of the Antonines and look around him and forward\r\n     to our own day, the consequence of the first four centuries will at\r\n     once appear. He will see the unceasing expansion of the paved\r\n     imperial ways. He will conceive those great Councils of the Church\r\n     which would meet indifferently in centres 1,500 miles apart, in the\r\n     extremity of Spain or on the Bosphorus: a sort of moving city whose\r\n     vast travel was not even noticed nor called a feat. He will be\r\n     appalled by the vigour of the Western mind between Augustus and\r\n     Julian when he finds that it could comprehend and influence and\r\n     treat as one vast State what is, even now, after so many centuries\r\n     of painful reconstruction, a mosaic of separate provinces.\r\n\r\nThe reader has there a handy conspectus of Mr. Belloc's view on a period\r\nhe considers cardinal in the history of what he would call \"our own\r\nkind.\" This is one of the pillars of his conception of the world: what\r\nthe other pillars are will appear later in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the story, he insists on minimizing the effect and extent of\r\nthe barbaric invasions. He does not indeed regard the auxiliary troops\r\nof the Empire who set up kingdoms in the West as invaders at all. The\r\nWandering of the Peoples which assumes such a dreadful aspect in\r\nGibbon, is, to him, until after Charlemagne at least, certainly a sign\r\nof decay and certainly an element of disorganization, but neither the\r\none nor the other to the extent which we are accustomed to believe. Here\r\nwe have a sign of a definite attitude towards historical fact, an\r\nattitude which is open to question but which is still permissible. He\r\nbelieves that the civilization of Rome endured for the main part,\r\nparticularly in Gaul, until the ninth century. In _The Eye-Witness_ he\r\nstates roundly that Charlemagne came of an old family of wealthy and\r\npowerful Gallo-Roman nobles. In _Paris_, an earlier work, he declines to\r\nestimate the exact amount of German blood in this ruler's veins.[3]\r\n\r\nIn any case, he believes that the German auxiliaries partly replaced and\r\npartly allied themselves with a rich, powerful and long-established\r\naristocracy; that they did in truth separate the State into fragments;\r\nbut that they touched very little the main social fabric, and only at\r\nmost hastened the elements of change. He perpetually insists on the\r\nfewness of the invaders who settled, and he believes that the Western\r\nrace, welded almost into one people by the vast political action of\r\nRome, was, in bulk, but little affected by the Northern barbarians.\r\n\r\nNot until the ninth century will he admit anything approaching the death\r\nof Roman influence in her Western provinces, except in Britain. Here, in\r\nthe ninth century, under the invasions of the Danes and the onslaughts\r\nof the Arabs, civilization is in peril and the West suffers its most\r\nserious wounds at the hands of the barbarians. And here already, the new\r\ninfluence, the Roman Church, which began to show itself in the\r\ncoronation of Charlemagne, first takes up its inheritance of the\r\noecumenical power of the Empire. The ninth century saw the climax of\r\n\"the gradual despair of the civil power; the new dream of the Church\r\nwhich meant to build a city of God on the shifting sands of the\r\ninvasions.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe new dream was but beginning to take on reality and the civil power\r\nhad in all fullness despaired. The old civilization, which had lasted so\r\nlong and changed so gradually, required to be refreshed by catastrophe:\r\neven as some men believe of our own times. The catastrophe came, and,\r\nthrough the struggle with the North and with Asia, the transformation\r\ntook place unseen in that lowest ebb of humanity. Europe had reached the\r\ncrest of one wave in the height of the Empire under the power of the\r\nRoman government. It was to reach another in the thirteenth century\r\nunder the influence of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nThe most of Mr. Belloc's conception of the Middle Ages is to be found in\r\nhis book _Paris_, where it is really incidental though profoundly\r\nimportant. We cannot too often insist upon this fact, that the brief and\r\ninsufficient historical sketch presented in this chapter is a piecing\r\ntogether often of mere indications as well as of detached statements.\r\nThe reader will do well to bear in mind that in this exposition we are\r\nlaying before him to the best of our powers what we take to be the\r\ndefinite scheme of events undoubtedly present in our author's mind, but\r\nnever as a whole expressed by him. It is frequently necessary to infer\r\nfrom what he states, the precise curve of his thought: this skeleton of\r\nhistory is deduced only from a few bones.\r\n\r\nIn the book _Paris_, then, we find the best guide to his conception of\r\nthe Middle Ages. It is naturally in principle a work of topographical\r\nand architectural purpose. But architecture is a guide to history. It\r\nis the capital art of a happy society. (And, incidentally, an art that\r\nis, in a definite and positive manner, dead in the present age.) Athens,\r\nat her climax, built: and the grandeur of Rome has been preserved in\r\narches and aqueducts. For Mr. Belloc, the progress of the upward curve\r\nfrom the ninth century to the thirteenth reaches its culmination in the\r\nbest of the Gothic. He sees in that structural time one of humanity's\r\nperiods of achievement, and he will not assent to the common theory of a\r\ngradual upward curve from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Middle Ages was a progress towards unity, less\r\nsuccessful but more spontaneous than that which was achieved under the\r\ncompelling hand of the Roman armies. Christianity, wounded and\r\nthreatened by the advance of the heathen, of a power opposed to them by\r\nreligion and by race, was shocked into feeling the existence of\r\nChristendom. The Western spirit, which had rallied to the Republic\r\nagainst Carthage, now gathered under the flag of the Church and\r\nexpressed itself in the Crusades.\r\n\r\nThe levying of Europe for a common and a noble purpose began the process\r\nwhich was continued by the intellectual stimulation of these wars. It\r\nflowered briefly but exquisitely in the Gothic, in the foundation of the\r\nuniversities and the teaching of philosophy, and in the establishment of\r\nstrong, well-ordered central governments in the feudal scheme.\r\n\r\nThe merits of the Middle Ages, to Mr. Belloc, lie not only in their\r\nartistic and philosophical achievements, but also and especially in\r\ntheir security. He has the French, the Latin attachment to a vigorous\r\ncentral power, and, of all political forms, he most fears and hates an\r\noligarchy. To others, to Dr. Johnson and to Goldsmith, for example, it\r\nhas seemed very clear that the interests of the poor lie with the king\r\nagainst the rich. Mr. Belloc sees in the feudal system strongly\r\nadministered from a centre, with the villein secured in his holding and\r\nthe townsman controlled and protected by his guild, if not a perfect, at\r\nleast a solidly successful polity. He applauds therefore those ages in\r\nwhich central justice was effective, the ages of Edward I in England and\r\nSt. Louis in France.\r\n\r\n     But [he says] the mediaeval theory in the State and its effect on\r\n     architecture, suited as they were to our blood, and giving us, as\r\n     they did, the only language in which we have ever found an exact\r\n     expression of our instincts, ruled in security for a very little\r\n     while; it began--almost in the hour of its perfection--to decay;\r\n     St. Louis outlived it a little, kept it vigorous, perhaps, in his\r\n     own immediate surroundings, when it was already weakened in the\r\n     rest of Europe, and long before the thirteenth century was out the\r\n     system to which it has given its name was drying up at the\r\n     roots.[5]\r\n\r\nWhy, then, was this crest of the curve so much less durable than that on\r\nwhich the Empire rode safely through four ordered centuries? To that\r\nthere are many possible answers. Some might suppose that the binding\r\nspiritual force of the Roman Church was weaker than the physical force\r\nof the Roman army. Mr. Belloc suggests that the mediaeval system came\r\ntoo suddenly into flower and had not enough strength to deal with new\r\nproblems. He offers also other reasons, such as these[6]:\r\n\r\n     First, the astounding series of catastrophes ... especially in the\r\n     earlier part; secondly, its loss of creative power. As for the\r\n     first of these, the black death, the famines, the hundred years'\r\n     war, the free companies, the abasement of the church, the great\r\n     schism--these things were misfortunes to which our modern time can\r\n     find no parallel. They came suddenly upon Western Europe and\r\n     defiled it like a blight.... They have made the mediaeval idea\r\n     odious to every half-instructed man and have stamped even its\r\n     beauty with associations of evil.\r\n\r\nSo for two hundred years the curve continued evilly downwards, and at\r\nlast, after a period of horror, rose in the lesser crest of the\r\nRenaissance, a time more splendid than solid, more active than\r\nbeneficent. In this period occurred the Reformation, an event which Mr.\r\nBelloc, a Catholic, frankly regards as evil.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that it tore in two the still expanding body of Christendom.\r\nBut, with the exception of one province, it left to the See of Rome all\r\nthose Western countries which the Empire of Rome had governed. Britain\r\nwas torn away in the process, but the remainder of the Western races was\r\nleft, if not united, at least with a bond of unity.\r\n\r\nSo the course of history went into the welter of religious wars which\r\ngradually merge into dynastic wars and confuse the record of the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century. At the end of the last of\r\nthese divisions of time came the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis event is the third of the three pillars on which Mr. Belloc\r\nsupports his notion of Western history: the Roman Empire, the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and the Revolution. He sees in it the principle result of the\r\nReformation, but an event which also undid and increasingly nullified\r\nthe effects of that schism.\r\n\r\nHe regards the Reformation as having not only disturbed the unity of\r\nEurope, but also having encouraged the growth of those wealthy and\r\nselfish classes of whom he has a particular dread. He speaks--in his\r\n_Marie Antoinette_, which becomes for some little distance here our\r\nprincipal guide--of how \"the attempt to force upon the French doctrines\r\nconvenient, in France as in England, to the wealthy merchants, the\r\nintellectuals and the squires was met by popular risings.\" He believes\r\nthat to the Catholic tradition descended from the Roman Empire that idea\r\nof the State which is always the salvation of the people as opposed to\r\nthe rich. The violent adhesion of France to the Church--only tempered by\r\nsome jealousy of Austria--saved the Faith for Europe: France thus became\r\nthe capital stronghold of the Western idea, whence it issued in renewed\r\nforce at the Revolution.[7] The Revolution itself was a drastic return\r\nto the ideas of universality and equality which are essentially Roman.\r\n\r\nIt has been Mr. Belloc's task and delight to reconcile the principles of\r\nthe Revolution with his own faith. He would show that the two were\r\nopposed only by this intellectual accident or that political blunder:\r\nthat the dogmas of each are capable of being held by the same mind. And,\r\nin the revival of religion in our own times, which \"may be called,\r\naccording to the taste of the scholar, the Catholic reaction or the\r\nCatholic renaissance,\" he sees not only the first and most beneficent\r\nresult of the principles of the Revolution, but also a sign that the\r\nwounds then inflicted are beginning to be healed.\r\n\r\nHis clearest and most connected exposition of these things is to be\r\nfound in the little book which is called _The French Revolution_, of\r\nwhich the object, he says, is \"to lay, if that be possible, an\r\nexplanation of it before the reader.\"\r\n\r\nHe begins by making a detailed explanation of the democratic theory,\r\nwhich is drawn from Rousseau's treatise _Le Contrat Social_. Let us\r\nselect one significant passage on the doctrine of equality:\r\n\r\n     The doctrine of the equality of man is a transcendent doctrine: a\r\n     \"dogma\" as we call such doctrines in the field of transcendental\r\n     religion. It corresponds to no physical reality which we can grasp,\r\n     it is hardly to be adumbrated even by metaphors drawn from physical\r\n     objects. We may attempt to rationalize it by saying that what is\r\n     common to all men is not _more_ important but _infinitely more_\r\n     important than the accidents by which men differ.\r\n\r\nOn such a simple statement does he found his explanation of the greatest\r\nevent of the modern world, an upheaval and a remoulding which\r\nastonishes us equally whether we consider how far it fell short of its\r\nhighest intentions or how much it actually accomplished.\r\n\r\nNow he proceeds from the obvious and historical fact of the quarrel\r\nwhich actually took place between the Revolution and the Church, and\r\nasks: \"_Was there a necessary and fundamental quarrel between the\r\ndoctrines of the Revolution and those of the Catholic Church_?\" And he\r\nreplies:\r\n\r\n     It is impossible for the theologian, or even for the practical\r\n     ecclesiastical teacher, to put his finger upon a political doctrine\r\n     essential to the Revolution and to say, \"This doctrine is opposed\r\n     to Catholic dogma or to Catholic morals.\" Conversely, it is\r\n     impossible for the Republican to put his finger upon a matter of\r\n     ecclesiastical discipline or religious dogma and to say, \"This\r\n     Catholic point is at issue with my political theory of the State.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the negative argument which at that point in that book was\r\nenough for Mr. Belloc's purpose. He proceeds to explain the material\r\naccidents and causes which nullified this argument. But we must attempt\r\nfurther to discover from the general trend of Mr. Belloc's character and\r\nthought the positive grounds by which he reconciles these two principles\r\nwhich have so far shown themselves divided in practice.\r\n\r\nThe two things are of Latin, that is to say of Roman origin. The Church\r\nis \"the ghost of the Roman Empire sitting crowned and throned on the\r\ngrave thereof\": it is a new manifestation (and a higher one) of the\r\npolitical and social ideal which inspired the Roman people. Also the\r\nFrench have inherited most of the Latin passion for reason, law and\r\norder: under Napoleon they strove to make a new empire, and they carried\r\ntogether a code of law and the idea of equality all over Europe.\r\n\r\nIn both the Faith and the Revolution there are secure dogmas on which\r\nthe mind can rest. Fundamental unprovable things are established by\r\ndeclaration, and fruitless argument about them is cut off at the roots.\r\nIn the clear certitude of such doctrines is a basis for action and for\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe purpose and the scope of work of both these ideas was much the same.\r\nEach proposed to establish a European community, in which the peoples of\r\nkindred blood might rest together and develop their resources. The\r\nRevolution might well have restored that unity of the Western race which\r\nvanished with Rome and which the Reformation forbade the Church to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nThat conception of Europe as an entity so far only conscious of itself,\r\nas it were, by lucid intervals in a long delirium, is very dear to Mr.\r\nBelloc. We have dwelt on it at the beginning of this chapter and must\r\nreturn to it now, for, if one idea can be said to underlie all his\r\nhistorical writings, this is that one idea. The notions which we have\r\ndescribed as the three pillars of his historical scheme are three\r\nexpressions of this vision, and the vision is of something transcendent,\r\nlike the dogmas on which his mind rests, something which is a reality,\r\nbut cannot be proved in words or seized by any merely physical metaphor.\r\nHe begins _Marie Antoinette_ with these words: \"Europe, which carries\r\nthe fate of the whole world ...\"\r\n\r\nThis fundamental point in its three expressions is the point which Mr.\r\nBelloc would have his public grasp before beginning to discuss the\r\nproblems which await it in the polling-booths and in the everyday\r\nconversations which more weightily mould the fate of the world. He is a\r\npropagandist historian, and his work has the liveliness given by an air\r\nof eagerness to convince.\r\n\r\nHis bias, the precise nature of his propaganda, are frankly exposed. He\r\nwould have the State and European society, especially the society of\r\nEngland, revived by a return to the profession and the practice of his\r\nown faith. In Prussia also historians compose their works with such a\r\ndefinite and positive end in contemporary affairs.\r\n\r\nBut between them and Mr. Belloc lies this great difference. He writes,\r\nas we have said, candidly, in a partisan spirit, with the eagerness of a\r\nman who wishes to convince. In the University of Berlin the\r\nindoctrination of the student is pursued under the cloak of a baleful\r\nand gloomy pedantry, laughably miscalled \"the scientific method.\" The\r\npropaganda of Frederick is not obvious and many are deceived.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic historian lies in England under a grave suspicion. Lingard,\r\nwho wrote, after all, one of the best histories of the English nation,\r\ncertainly more readable than Freeman and less prejudiced than Froude, is\r\nneither studied nor mentioned in our schools. Even poor Acton, whose\r\nsmug Whig bias is apparent to the stupidest, who nourished himself on\r\nLutheran learning, \"mostly,\" as he says, pathetically \"in octavo\r\nvolumes,\" is thought of darkly by the uninstructed as an emissary of the\r\nJesuits. But who can either suffer from or accuse the Catholic bias of\r\nMr. Belloc?\r\n\r\nHe says to you frankly in every page: \"I am a Catholic. I believe in the\r\nChurch of Rome. For these and these reasons, I am of opinion that the\r\nReformation was a disaster and that the Protestant peoples are still a\r\ndanger to Europe.\" Can you still complain of the propagandist turn of\r\nsuch a man? As well complain of a professed theologian that he is\r\nbiassed as to the existence of God. He warns you amply that he has a\r\nparticular point of view, and he gives you every opportunity to make\r\nallowance for it. When you have done so, you will find that his\r\nnarrative and interpretation are still astonishingly accurate and just.\r\nAnd he has a corrective to bias in his vivid poetic love of the past,\r\nwhich we shall analyse in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\nThis also is made a reproach against him by scholars. It is true that in\r\nhis serious historical works, _Robespierre_, _Danton_, and _Marie\r\nAntoinette_, he introduces more of romance than is commonly admitted by\r\nserious writers. He is apt to give his descriptions something of the\r\npositive and living character which we more usually expect in a novel.\r\nThe charge is made against him, under which Macaulay suffers justly and\r\nPrescott, the American, with less reason, of having written historical\r\nromances. Let us grant that it is not usual to give so much detail or so\r\nmuch colour as that in which Mr. Belloc takes delight.\r\n\r\nIs his accuracy thereby spoilt? He insists on seeing all the events and\r\ndetails of Cardinal de Rohan's interview with the pretended Queen of\r\nFrance. But it does not of itself testify that Mr. Belloc cannot judge\r\nwhether this interview took place or interfered with his estimate of its\r\nimportance. We contend, very seriously and very gravely, that these\r\nbooks will be found to show a singularly high level of accuracy and\r\njustice. In the interpretation of facts bias will show: in Acton equally\r\nwith Froude. If it did not, if the historian were an instrument and\r\nhumanly null, what effect would either his narrative or his reading have\r\non the student? He could not convey to another mind even his\r\ncomprehension of the bare facts. Mr. Belloc invests his narrative with a\r\nliving interest, and how he does this and why it is the surest guarantee\r\nof accuracy and impartiality, we shall endeavour to show in the\r\nsucceeding chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Professor Bury adds coyly in a footnote: \"But there is\r\nanother side to this picture which may be seen by studying Mommsen's\r\nvolume on the provinces.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Esto Perpetua._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: These sentences may appear to indicate indecision in Mr.\r\nBelloc's mind as to this point.

That earthwork is the earthwork where the British stood against\r\n     the charge of the Tenth Legion, and first heard, sounding on their\r\n     bronze, the arms of Caesar. Here the river was forded; here the\r\n     little men of the South went up in formation; here the barbarian\r\n     broke and took his way, as the opposing General has recorded,\r\n     through devious woodland paths, scattering in the pursuit; here\r\n     began the great history of England.\r\n\r\n     Is it not an enormous business merely to stand in such a place? I\r\n     think so.\r\n\r\nThere you have compactly and poignantly expressed a mood which is common\r\nto all men who have any feeling for the past. It is a pathetic, almost a\r\ntragic mood, a longing more pitiable than that of any fanatic for any\r\nparadise, any lover for any woman, because it is quite impossible that\r\nit should ever be satisfied. To see, to feel, to move among the\r\nfoundations of our generation--it is so natural a desire, and it is\r\nquite hopeless.\r\n\r\nIt is a desire which one might naturally suppose to be common among\r\nhistorians, and to govern their thoughts: but you will not find it in\r\nthe academies. Only in the true historian, the student who, like\r\nHerodotus, is also a poet and names the Muses, will you find its clear\r\nexpression. But it is and must be the mainspring of all good historical\r\nwriting, for this desire to know the concrete past is, in the end, the\r\nonly corrective to the propagandist bias, which is, as we have seen, the\r\nright motive of useful research. Acton had it not, Froude perhaps a\r\nlittle, Maitland, one might believe, to some extent,[8] Professor Bury,\r\nLord knows, neither that nor any other emotion comprehensible in man. To\r\nthe don, indeed, the absence of the past is one of the factors in his\r\nfascinating, esoteric game: were some astounding document to appear that\r\nshould make the origin and constitution of the mediaeval manor as clear\r\nas daylight, the problem would lose its interest, the agile don would\r\nfind it too easy for him. The equipment of the ideal historian consists\r\nof the attributes of practical and poetic man, the desire to gain some\r\npresent benefit, to learn some urgent lesson, and the desire to perfect\r\nthe spirit by contemplation of the past.\r\n\r\nHistory, indeed, is the record of the actions of individual men, and\r\nthese men, like ourselves, had arms, legs and stomachs, and suffered the\r\nworkings of the same fears and passions that we suffer. To derive any\r\npractical or spiritual benefit from the study of history, we must\r\nunderstand, as far as possible, by analogy from our own experience, how\r\nthe events of which we read came about: we must see them as personal\r\nevents, originated by the actions, and influencing the lives of human\r\nbeings like ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have expressed sufficiently in the previous chapter an opinion on the\r\nvalue of Mr. Belloc's historical conclusions: we must now examine more\r\nclosely the method by means of which he presents these conclusions and\r\nits effect on the reader.\r\n\r\nHis method, it goes without saying, is more lively. In the whole of the\r\n_Cambridge Modern History_ (sixteen volumes of unbelievable dimensions)\r\nyou will not find one living character or one paragraph of exhilarating\r\nprose.[9] Mr. Belloc's work, on the other hand, is full of both. But\r\nthis must not be taken, without further inquiry, to be an unqualified\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe lively writer is, by an ever-living commonplace, considered to be\r\ninaccurate: the donnish historian may, by his plodding want of\r\nimagination, give us only the strict facts. The lively writer, perhaps,\r\nin the desire to round out a character of a man concerning whom little\r\nis known or to perfect the rhythm of a paragraph, will consult his\r\nconvenient fancy rather than the difficult document. In academic\r\ncircles, it is rather a reproach to say that a man writes in an\r\ninteresting way: they remember Macaulay and would, if they could, forget\r\nGibbon.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc's writing, nevertheless, is not affected by the desire either\r\nto impress or to startle his readers, any more than the writing of a\r\ngood poet springs from an aiming at effect: it is like all true\r\nliterature, in the first place, the outcome of a strong and personal\r\npassion, the passion for the past. He says himself[10]:\r\n\r\n     To study something of great age until one grows familiar with it\r\n     and almost to live in its time, is not merely to satisfy a\r\n     curiosity or to establish aimless truths: it is rather to fulfil a\r\n     function whose appetite has always rendered History a necessity. By\r\n     the recovery of the Past, stuff and being are added to us; our\r\n     lives which, lived in the present only, are a film or surface, take\r\n     on body--are lifted into one dimension more. The soul is fed....\r\n     One may say that historical learning grants men glimpses of life\r\n     completed and a whole; and such a vision should be the chief solace\r\n     of whatever is mortal and cut off imperfectly from fulfilment.\r\n\r\nSuch a passion, then, such a purely poetic, spiritual, impractical\r\npassion is perhaps the cause of Mr. Belloc's note and career. It is the\r\npassion of a poet. Assuredly actuated by such a feeling, he has\r\ndeveloped his practical and political opinions: the true poet is always\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nIt is also in result a materially useful passion. It allows us to see in\r\nthe deeds of Henry VIII's Parliament not the blind working of political\r\ndevelopment, the impersonal and inevitable action of economic laws, but\r\nthe hot greed of a king and the astuteness of his supporters.\r\n\r\nActon speaks of \"the undying penalty which history has the power to\r\ninflict on wrong.\"[11] But how are we to fix a stigma, unless we know\r\nthe man's motives? How can we know his motives without an estimate of\r\nhis character? How can either of these be known unless we visualize him\r\nas he lived?\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc has made his most conscious and determined effort at\r\nvisualization in a book which is not historical, but which falls more,\r\nthough not altogether, into the category of historical fiction. This is\r\nthe book which is called _The Eye-Witness_.\r\n\r\nIt consists of twenty-seven sketches of historical incidents ranging\r\nfrom the year 55 B.C. to the year A.D. 1906. It begins with Caesar's\r\ninvasion of Britain, and goes by way of the disaster at Roncesvalles,\r\nthe Battle of Lewes, the execution of Charles I and the Battle of Valmy\r\nto an election in England which was held on the issues of Tariff Reform,\r\nChinese Labour in the Transvaal and other topics. One might say--a\r\ngloomy progress.\r\n\r\nIt falls partly into the category of historical fiction because much of\r\nit is sheerly created out of Mr. Belloc's own head. The interlocutors in\r\nmost of the sketches (where there are interlocutors), the individual who\r\nis the eye-witness (when there is one), these are imaginary. Mr. Barr,\r\nwho was held up in a crowd by the execution of Marie Antoinette and\r\nsuffered annoyance, the apprentice who saw an earlier royal head cut\r\noff, the Christian who was killed in the Arena by \"a little, low-built,\r\nbroad-shouldered man from the Auvergne of the sort that can tame an\r\nanimal in a day, hard as wood, and perfectly unfeeling,\" these are\r\ncharacters of fiction.\r\n\r\nBut in the \"stories\" that make up the book there is no plot. There is\r\njust a glimpse of a past life, sometimes, but not always, at a\r\nsignificant moment. In one of Mr. Wells' stories there is a queer fable\r\nof a crystal mysteriously in touch with a twin crystal on another\r\nplanet. Glancing into this, we get a glimpse of that different world.\r\nMr. Belloc's sketches are such crystals, suspended for a moment at a\r\ntime in centuries foreign to our own.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavoured passionately to be accurate in these. A passage from\r\nhis preface will show how this adverb is justified:\r\n\r\n     As to historical references, I must beg the indulgence of the\r\n     critic, but I believe I have not positively asserted an error, nor\r\n     failed to set down a considerable number of minute but entertaining\r\n     truths.\r\n\r\n     Thus the 10th Legion (which I have called a regiment in _The Two\r\n     Soldiers_) _did_ sail under Caesar for Britain from Boulogne, and\r\n     from no other port. There _was_ in those days a great land-locked\r\n     harbour from Pont-de-Briques right up to the Narrows, as the\r\n     readers of the _Gaule Romaine_ must know. The moon _was_ at her\r\n     last quarter (though presuming her not to be hidden by clouds is\r\n     but fancy). There _was_ a high hill just at the place where she\r\n     would have been setting that night--you may see it to-day. The\r\n     Roman soldiers _were_ recruited from the Teutonic and the Celtic\r\n     portions of Gaul; of the latter many _did_ know of that grotto\r\n     under Chartres which is among the chief historical interests of\r\n     Europe. The tide _was_, as I have said, on the flow at\r\n     midnight--and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe temper of that is the temper of the man who was at the pains, when\r\nwriting his life of Robespierre, to look up the reports of the Paris\r\nObservatory, so as to be able exactly to describe the weather in which\r\nsuch and such a great scene was played that hugely affected the fortunes\r\nof Europe. It is the temper, too, of a man with an immense historical\r\ncuriosity, who will not be satisfied with less than all of the past that\r\ncan reasonably be reconstructed.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc desires knowledge and experience of the past so earnestly\r\nthat he makes imaginary pictures of it, as it were to comfort himself.\r\nSome men, in this way, when walking alone, make imaginary pictures of\r\ntheir own futures, often to cheat the disappointments of a narrow life.\r\nToo fervid political idealists make pictures of the world's future: you\r\nthink immediately of Morris and Bellamy and many another. Mr. Belloc is\r\nnot likely to give way to this temptation.\r\n\r\nBut the strength and disinterestedness of this desire guarantee the\r\nreader of the book against the aridity of the pictures of past\r\ncivilizations which we all know: such as descriptions of how \"the\r\n_poeta_ (or poet) entered the _domus_ (or house), kicked the _canis_ (or\r\ndog) and summoned the _servus_ (or slave).\" It will be at all events a\r\nliving picture: it will be, to the best of the author's power, an\r\naccurate and impartial picture. It will translate characters, language\r\nand things as nearly as possible into terms comprehensible in our own\r\ntimes: but not so literally, or so extravagantly as to degenerate into\r\nthe _opera-bouffe_ of, for example, Mr. Shaw's _Caesar and Cleopatra_.\r\nThere will also be no tushery.\r\n\r\nThe method of description which Mr. Belloc employs in these sketches is\r\ncool and transparent. The emotion of the writer, as regards the\r\nparticular events he is describing, is suppressed, though the feeling of\r\neagerness to realize the past leaps out everywhere. It is only by great\r\nsteadiness of the vision and the hand that Mr. Belloc can secure the\r\neffects he here desires to convey.\r\n\r\nIt is only by great care in writing that he can secure the easy, even\r\nand real tone in which these glimpses of other centuries and other\r\nsocieties can be presented. Should he err on one side, he is in the bogs\r\nof tushery: on the other, he commits that fault of self-conscious,\r\nover-daring modernization, of which Mr. Shaw has been so guilty.\r\n\r\nLet us take a passage from the illuminating picture, \"The Pagans,\" which\r\ndescribes a dinner in a Narbonese house in the fifth century:\r\n\r\n     When it was already dark over the sea, they reclined together and\r\n     ate the feast, crowned with leaves in that old fashion which to\r\n     several of the younger men seemed an affectation of antique things,\r\n     but which all secretly enjoyed because such customs had about\r\n     them, as had the rare statues and the mosaics and the very pattern\r\n     of the lamps, a flavour of great established wealth and lineage. In\r\n     great established wealth and lineage lay all that was left of\r\n     strength to those old gods which still stood gazing upon the change\r\n     of the world.\r\n\r\n     The songs that were sung and the chaunted invocations had nothing\r\n     in them but the memories of Rome; but the instruments and dancers\r\n     were tolerated by that one guest who should most have complained,\r\n     and whose expression and apparel and gorgeous ornament and a\r\n     certain security of station in his manner proved him the head of\r\n     the Christian priests from Helena. When the music had ceased and\r\n     the night deepened, they talked all together as though the world\r\n     had but one general opinion; they talked with great courtesy of\r\n     common things. But from the slaves' quarters came the unmistakable\r\n     sing-song of the Christian vine-yard dance and hymn, which the\r\n     labourers sung together with rhythmic beating of hands and\r\n     customary cries, and through that din arose from time to time the\r\n     loud bass of one especially chosen to respond. The master sent out\r\n     word to them in secret to conduct their festival less noisily and\r\n     with closed doors. Upon the couches round the table where the lords\r\n     reclined together, more than one, especially among the younger men,\r\n     looked anxiously at their host and at the Priest next to him, but\r\n     they saw nothing in their expressions but a continued courtesy; and\r\n     the talk still moved upon things common to them all, and still\r\n     avoided that deep dissension which it was now useless to raise\r\n     because it would so soon be gone.\r\n\r\n     There came an hour when all but one ceased suddenly from wine; that\r\n     one, who still continued to drink as he saw fit, was the host. He\r\n     knew the reason of their abstention; he had heard the trumpet in\r\n     the harbour that told the hour and proclaimed the fast and vigil,\r\n     and he felt, as all did, that at last the figure and the presence\r\n     of which none would speak--the figure and the presence of the\r\n     Faith--had entered that room in spite of its dignity and its high\r\n     reserve.\r\n\r\n     For some little time, now talking of those great poets who were a\r\n     glory to them all, and whose verse was quite removed from these\r\n     newer things, the old man still sipped his wine and looked round at\r\n     the others whose fast had thus begun. He looked at them with an\r\n     expression of severity in which there was some challenge, but which\r\n     was far too disdainful to be insolent, and as he so looked the\r\n     company gradually departed.\r\n\r\nWe have quoted this passage at some length, because it is an almost\r\nperfect example of Mr. Belloc's style in these sketches, and because it\r\ntouches on, is the visualization of, a cardinal point in his historical\r\ntheories. This point has been dwelt upon more fully in the preceding\r\nchapter, and we cannot do more than mention it here. It expresses that\r\nview of the gradual development and transformation of the Roman Empire\r\nwith which Mr. Belloc would replace the gloomy view of Gibbon and the\r\nexaggerated horrors, to take a conspicuous but not now important\r\nexample, of Charles Kingsley's _Roman and Teuton_. He would represent it\r\nas a period of wealth and order, full of menace, warning and change, but\r\nno more prescient of utter disaster than our own time.\r\n\r\nThe sketch is a visualization of a short passage in the essay _On\r\nHistorical Evidences_:\r\n\r\n     You have the great Gallo-Roman noble family of Ferreolus running\r\n     down the centuries from the Decline of the Empire to the climax of\r\n     Charlemagne. Many of those names stand for some most powerful\r\n     individuality, yet all we have is a formula, a lineage, with\r\n     symbols and names in the place of living beings.... The men of that\r\n     time did not even think to tell us that there was such a thing as a\r\n     family tradition, nor did it seem important to them to establish\r\n     its Roman origin and its long succession in power.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc has endeavoured to see the reality of such a family, as he\r\nbelieves, as that from which Charlemagne sprung. He fights,\r\nparadoxically, for the unity of history against Freeman, who invented\r\nthat phrase and who yet thought that \"Charles the Great\" came from a\r\nline of German savages.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavoured passionately to realize this thing; it would be\r\npathetic, were not his desire so triumphantly gratified. Observe the\r\nease and sincerity of that long passage quoted above. One forcing of the\r\nnote, one moment's wish to show too great a scholarship or to emphasize\r\nthe antiquity of the scene, would have ruined the effect. It is full of\r\nemotion, the most poignant, the regret for passing and irrevocable\r\nthings, but the author is detached and cool. He is all bent on the\r\nfidelity of his picture.\r\n\r\n_The Girondin_ is very much a different matter and occupies a place in\r\nMr. Belloc's work difficult to discuss. It is frankly a novel, written\r\nas novels are, to entertain, to edify and to perform the spiritual\r\nfunctions of poetry and good literature. It is also unique in that it\r\ncontains a story of love, a motive largely absent from Mr. Belloc's\r\nimaginative writing.\r\n\r\nIn so far as it is an historical novel, we may expect to find in it, and\r\nwe do find in it, an accurate and living picture of one aspect of the\r\nage in which it is set. It should not surprise us to find this an\r\nunusual aspect; it is unusual. There are here none of the customary\r\ndecorations, no guillotine, no knitting women, no sea-green and\r\nmalignant Robespierre, no gently nurtured and heroic aristocrats. The\r\nprogress of the story does not touch even the fringes of Paris. The hero\r\nis an inhabitant of the Gironde and not a member of the party which bore\r\nthat name.\r\n\r\nThe action moves from a town in the Gironde to the frontiers. The hero\r\nis killed by an accident with a gun-team soon after the Battle of Valmy.\r\nThat is the unfamiliar aspect of the hackneyed French Revolution with\r\nwhich Mr. Belloc here chooses to deal: an aspect, we might even say, not\r\nmerely unfamiliar, but practically unknown to the English reader.\r\n\r\nThe matter of raising the armies was a matter of prime importance to the\r\nRepublic, and involved a task which even we, in this country, with all\r\nour recent experiences, can hardly comprehend. The officers had\r\ndeserted, the men were not all to be trusted, all told there were not\r\nenough for the pressing necessities of the State. A corps of officers\r\nhad to be improvised from nowhere, recruits had to be taught to ride as\r\nthey went to meet the Prussians. Such were the beginnings of the army\r\nthat afterwards visited the Pyramids, Vienna, Berlin and Moscow.\r\n\r\nAll this Mr. Belloc has shown with sufficient vividness in isolated\r\npassages. Even those who have played no part in the raising of the new\r\narmies of England, can gain from his descriptions something of what that\r\nbusiness must have been. But in this book he is not merely writing a\r\nsketch to visualize the past, he is writing a real story with a number\r\nof living characters and a sort of a plot. And in some way the story and\r\nthe historical matter weaken one another. They go and come by turns. The\r\nwhole book is an irregular succession of detached incidents. The witty\r\nBoutroux is a sport of chance and dies, fitly enough, not in action, but\r\nby a mishap.\r\n\r\nIf we separate from the rest the incident of the girl Joyeuse, it is\r\nextremely beautiful. Take by themselves the stratagems and the\r\nconversations of Boutroux: they are extremely witty. Take by themselves\r\nthe military scenes: they are impressive. But these do not make the book\r\na whole or leave the impression that the author knew from chapter to\r\nchapter what he was going to write next.\r\n\r\nFrankly, then, _The Girondin_ is a disappointment, but, perhaps, only\r\nbecause it held such possibilities and because we had reason to\r\nanticipate that Mr. Belloc would surprise us with these possibilities.\r\nHis great historical novel is yet to come.\r\n\r\nThat he is qualified to write such a book, whether from the standpoint\r\nof imaginative power or from that of historical knowledge, needs no\r\ndiscussion here. Whether he can, should he choose, combine these\r\nqualities, in an extended work, so perfectly that they do not clash, and\r\nthat neither transcends the other, is a question for the future to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nBut his imaginative power serves him already in the study, and in the\r\nwriting of pure history. It is a guarantee, we have said, that the\r\nreader will be preserved from barren, unco-ordinated details, which are\r\nset down without any reference to human purpose. It is also a guarantee,\r\nand this is most important, of as much impartiality as is possible to\r\nman. For the imaginative man does not seek fantasy in these things: he\r\ncan make that for himself in other and more suitable places. Here the\r\nplain facts are enough to feed his spirit and to make it rejoice. The\r\nmost fantastic theories that diversify the page of written history have\r\nsprung from the minds of barren dons, who sit in studies unhindered by\r\nany realization of the world, and in whose hands the facts are wooden\r\nblocks to be piled up in any shape of the grotesque. Mr. Belloc, with a\r\ndesire to realize and to know the past, a poetic desire that quite\r\novercomes any propagandist bias or routine of thought, is sure of this\r\nat least: that he will see the past centuries as clearly and as truly as\r\npossible, and with a vision that steadily resolves economic developments\r\nand political movements into the actions, and the results of the\r\nactions, of human beings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: But Maitland, of course, was human. He lived some part of\r\nhis life away from Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: We make this statement confidently without having read, and\r\nnot intending to read, the whole of the _Cambridge Modern History_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _The Old Road_, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Inaugural Lectures: Lecture on Modern History_, p. 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMR. BELLOC AND ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc is a democrat. He is politically democratic in the sense in\r\nwhich the French Revolution was democratic, and he is spiritually\r\ndemocratic in the sense in which the Church of Rome is democratic. What\r\nis common to all men is to him infinitely more important than the\r\naccidents by which men differ. The same may be said of his view of the\r\nnations of Europe. He does not view these great nations separately, but\r\nin their relation one to another. That in its history which each nation\r\nhas in common with the other European nations is infinitely more\r\nimportant than that which is peculiar to itself alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc said of Danton that he possessed a singularly wide view of\r\nthe Europe in which France stood. We may say that in Mr. Belloc's view\r\nEngland juts out from Europe in a precarious position. England forms an\r\nintegral part of Europe, but her position to-day, owing mainly to the\r\naccidents of her peculiar history, is as unique as it is perilous.\r\n\r\nThere are two books written by Mr. Belloc which deal exclusively with\r\ndifferent aspects of the England of to-day. Of these, the first is _The\r\nServile State_, in which Mr. Belloc is writing to maintain and prove the\r\nthesis that industrial society, as we know it, is tending towards the\r\nre-establishment of slavery. In this work he is concerned with an\r\nanalysis of the economic system existing in England to-day, and with\r\nsketching the course of development in which that system came into\r\nbeing. In the other book, _The Party System_, in which Mr. Cecil\r\nChesterton collaborated, he is concerned with an analysis of our present\r\nmethods of government.\r\n\r\nWith _The Party System_ and the views contained in it we shall deal in a\r\nlater chapter. Here we are concerned solely with Mr. Belloc's view of\r\nthe development of England and especially with that most startling and\r\noriginal view which he expounds in _The Servile State_ as to the origin\r\nof our present economic system.\r\n\r\nWhether in Mr. Belloc's view, or the view of any other historian, the\r\ncardinal point in the history of England is that England was Britain\r\nbefore it became England: though Mr. Belloc would probably add the\r\nreminder that England was Britain for as long a period as from the time\r\nof Henry VIII to the present day. England was once as much a province of\r\nthe Roman Empire as was France. This fact, of course, is commonly\r\nrecognized. Where Mr. Belloc differs from other historians, so far as\r\ncan be gathered by piecing together hints and allusions from his various\r\nwritings, is in emphasizing the fact that the successive hosts of\r\nbarbarian invaders were repeatedly brought under the influence of that\r\nChristian civilization which had inherited the magnificent institutions\r\nof the Empire. Thus the Angles and Saxons came under the influence of\r\nSt. Augustine and the later missionaries, who, as they became\r\necclesiastics and Christianity was recognized as the national religion,\r\nintroduced pieces of Roman Law into the Witenagemot and preserved in the\r\nBenedictine foundations the learning and experience of bygone centuries.\r\nIn the monastic institution of the sixth and seventh centuries Mr.\r\nBelloc sees the power which re-created North and Western Europe.\r\n\r\n     This institution [he says] did more work in Britain than in any\r\n     other province of the Empire. And it had far more to do. It found a\r\n     district utterly wrecked, perhaps half depopulated, and having lost\r\n     all but a vague memory of the old Roman order; it had to remake, if\r\n     it could, of all this part of a Europe. No other instrument was\r\n     fitted for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     The chief difficulty of starting again the machine of civilization\r\n     when its parts have been distorted by a barbarian interlude,\r\n     whether external or internal in origin, is the accumulation of\r\n     capital. The next difficulty is the preservation of such capital in\r\n     the midst of continual petty feuds and raids, and the third is that\r\n     general continuity of effort, and that treasuring up of proved\r\n     experience, to which a barbaric time, succeeding upon the decline\r\n     of a civilization, is particularly unfitted. For the surmounting of\r\n     all these difficulties the monks of Western Europe were suited in a\r\n     high degree. Fixed wealth could be accumulated in the hands of\r\n     communities whose whole temptation was to gather, and who had no\r\n     opportunity for spending in waste. The religious atmosphere in\r\n     which they grew up forbade their spoliation, at least in the\r\n     internal wars of a Christian people, and each of the great\r\n     foundations provided a community of learning and treasuring up of\r\n     experience which single families, especially families of barbaric\r\n     chieftains, could never have achieved. They provided leisure for\r\n     literary effort, and a strict disciplinary rule enforcing regular,\r\n     continuous, and assiduous labour, and they provided these in a\r\n     society from which exact application of such a kind had all but\r\n     disappeared.[12]\r\n\r\nIn this way the just heritage of \"our own kind\" was preserved for us.\r\nThe great monasteries suffered severely in the Danish invasions, \"the\r\npagan storm which all but repeated in Britain the disaster of the Saxon\r\ninvasions, which all but overcame the mystic tenacity of Alfred and the\r\npositive mission of the town of Paris\"; but they re-arose and were again\r\nexercising a strong civilizing influence \"when civilization returned in\r\nfullness with the Norman Conquest.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conquest, in Mr. Belloc's view, is \"almost as sharp a division in\r\nthe history of England as is the landing of St. Augustine ... though ...\r\nthe re-entry of England into European civilization in the seventh\r\ncentury must count as a far greater and more decisive event than its\r\nfirst experience of united and regular government under the Normans in\r\nthe eleventh.\" But it did not change the intimate philosophy of the\r\npeople:\r\n\r\n     The Conquest found England Catholic, vaguely feudal, and, though in\r\n     rather an isolated way, thoroughly European. The Normans organized\r\n     that feudality, extirpated whatever was unorthodox or slack in the\r\n     machinery of the religious system, and let in the full light of\r\n     European civilization through a wide-open door, which had hitherto\r\n     been half-closed.[13]\r\n\r\nThe organization of feudal government by the Normans brings us to a\r\nconsideration of the territorial system of England which can be traced\r\ncertainly from Saxon and conjecturally from Roman times.\r\n\r\nIn making the study of history, as does Mr. Belloc, living and organic,\r\nit is of capital importance to seize the fact that the fundamental\r\neconomic institution of pagan antiquity was slavery. Before the coming\r\nof the Christian Era, and even after its advent, slavery was taken for\r\ngranted. Mr. Belloc says:\r\n\r\n     In no matter what field of the European past we make our research,\r\n     we find, from two thousand years ago upwards one fundamental\r\n     institution whereupon the whole of society reposes; that\r\n     fundamental institution is Slavery.... Our European ancestry, those\r\n     men from whom we are descended and whose blood runs with little\r\n     admixture in our veins, took slavery for granted, made of it the\r\n     economic pivot upon which the production of wealth should turn, and\r\n     never doubted but that it was normal to all human society.[14]\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the Church, however, the servile institution was for\r\na time dissolved. This dissolution was a sub-conscious effect of the\r\nspread of Christianity and not the outcome of any direct attack of the\r\nChurch upon slavery:\r\n\r\n     No dogma of the Church pronounced Slavery to be immoral, or the\r\n     sale and purchase of men to be a sin, or the imposition of\r\n     compulsory labour upon a Christian to be a contravention of any\r\n     human right.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc traces the disappearance of this fundamental institution\r\nrather as follows. He says:\r\n\r\n     The sale of Christians to Pagan masters was abhorrent to the later\r\n     empire of the Barbarian Invasions, not because slavery in itself\r\n     was condemned, but because it was a sort of treason to civilization\r\n     to force men away from Civilization to Barbarism.[15]\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of slavery begins with the establishment as the\r\nfundamental unit of production of those great landed estates which were\r\nknown to the Romans as _villae_ and were cultivated by slaves. In the\r\nlast years of the Empire it became more convenient in the decay of\r\ncommunications and public power and more consonant with the social\r\nspirit of the time, to make sure of the slave's produce by asking him\r\nfor no more than certain customary dues. In course of time this\r\narrangement became a sort of bargain, and by the ninth century, when\r\nthis process had been gradually at work for nearly three hundred years,\r\nwhat we now call the Manorial system was fairly firmly established. By\r\nthe tenth century the system was crystallized and had become so natural\r\nto men that the originally servile character of the folk working on the\r\nland was forgotten. The labourer at the end of the Dark Ages was no\r\nlonger a slave but a serf.\r\n\r\nIn the early Middle Ages, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, at the\r\ntime, that is, of the Crusades and the Norman Conquest, the serf is\r\nalready nearly a peasant. As the generations pass he becomes more and\r\nmore free in the eyes of the courts and of society.\r\n\r\nWe see then that Saxon England, at the time the Conqueror landed, was\r\norganized on the Manorial system. This arrangement, with its village\r\nlords and their dependent serfs, was common to the whole of the West,\r\nand could be found on the Rhine, in Gaul and even in Italy; but the\r\nManorial system in England differed from the Manorial system of Western\r\nEurope in one fatally important particular.\r\n\r\n     In Saxon England [says Mr. Belloc] there was no systematic\r\n     organization by which the local landowner definitely recognized a\r\n     feudal superior and through him the power of a Central\r\n     Government.... When William landed, the whole system of tenure was\r\n     in disorder in the sense that the local lord of the village was not\r\n     accustomed to the interference of the superior, and that no groups\r\n     of lords had come into existence by which the territorial system\r\n     could be bound in sheaves, as it were, and the whole of it attached\r\n     to one central point at the Royal Court.\r\n\r\n     Such a system of groups _had_ arisen in Gaul, and to that\r\n     difference ultimately we owe the French territorial system of the\r\n     present day, but William the Norman's new subjects had no\r\n     comprehension of it.[16]\r\n\r\nThe order introduced by William was not strong enough to endure in face\r\nof the ancient customs of the populace and the lack of any bond between\r\nscattered and locally independent units. A recrudescence of the early\r\nindependence of the landowners was felt in the reign of Henry II, while\r\nunder John it blazed out into successful revolt. Throughout the Middle\r\nAges we may see the village landlord gradually growing in independence\r\nand usurping, as a class, the power of the Central Government.\r\n\r\nWhat the outcome of this state of affairs would have been had events\r\nbeen allowed to develop without interruption, it is impossible to say.\r\nWhether or not the peasant would have acquired freedom and wealth, at\r\nthe expense of the landlord; whether then a strong Central Government\r\nwould have arisen; whether property would have become more or less\r\nequally distributed and the State have been composed of a mass of small\r\nowners, all possessed of the means of production--these are things we\r\ncan only guess. What we do know, and what Mr. Belloc has made abundantly\r\nclear, is that \"with the close of the Middle Ages the societies of\r\nWestern Christendom, and England among the rest, were economically\r\nfree.\" In England the great mass of the populace was gradually becoming\r\nmore and more possessed of property; but at the same time there existed\r\na very considerable class of large landowners, who were not only wealthy\r\nand powerful, but incapable of rigid control by the Crown.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the state of England when an immediate and overwhelming\r\nchange occurred. \"Nothing like it,\" says Mr. Belloc, \"has been known in\r\nEuropean history.\" An artificial revolution was brought about which\r\ninvolved a transformation of a good quarter of the whole economic power\r\nof the nation. If we are to understand Mr. Belloc's view of the England\r\nof the present day, it is essential that we should grasp clearly his\r\nview of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, for from this operation, he\r\nsays, \"the whole economic future of England was to flow.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc analyses the effect of the Dissolution of the Monasteries\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     All over England men who already held in virtually absolute\r\n     property from one-quarter to one-third of the soil and the ploughs\r\n     and the barns of a village, became possessed in a very few years of\r\n     a further great section of the means of production which turned the\r\n     scale wholly in their favour. They added to that third a new and\r\n     extra fifth. They became at a blow the owners of _half_ the\r\n     land![17]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this increase in ownership was tremendous. The men of this\r\nlandowning class, says Mr. Belloc, \"began to fill the universities, the\r\njudiciary. The Crown less and less decided between great and small. More\r\nand more the great could decide in their own favour.\"\r\n\r\nThe process was in full swing before Henry died, and because Henry had\r\nfailed to keep the wealth of the monasteries in the hands of the Crown,\r\nas he undoubtedly intended to do, there existed in England, by about a\r\ncentury after his death, a Crown which, instead of disposing of revenues\r\nfar greater than that of any subject, was dominated by a wealthy class.\r\n\"By 1630-40 the economic revolution was finally accomplished and the new\r\neconomic reality thrusting itself upon the old traditions of England was\r\na powerful oligarchy of large owners overshadowing an impoverished and\r\ndwindled monarchy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this oligarchy, which was originally an oligarchy of birth as well\r\nas wealth, but which rapidly became an oligarchy of wealth alone--Mr.\r\nBelloc cites as an example the history of the family of Williams (alias\r\nCromwell)--not only so subjugated the power of the central government as\r\nto reduce the king, after 1660, to the level of a salaried puppet, but\r\nalso, in course of time, ate up all the smaller owners until, by about\r\n1700, \"more than half of the English were dispossessed of capital and of\r\nland. Not one man in two, even if you reckon the very small owners,\r\ninhabited a house of which he was the secure possessor, or tilled land\r\nfrom which he could not be turned off.\"\r\n\r\n     Such a proportion [continues Mr. Belloc] may seem to us to-day a\r\n     wonderfully free arrangement, and certainly if nearly one-half of\r\n     our population were possessed of the means of production, we should\r\n     be in a very different situation from that in which we find\r\n     ourselves. But the point to seize is that, though the bad business\r\n     was very far from completion in or about 1700, yet by that date\r\n     England had already become capitalist. She had already permitted a\r\n     vast section of her population to become _proletarian_, and it is\r\n     this and _not_ the so-called \"Industrial Revolution,\" a later\r\n     thing, which accounts for the terrible social conditions in which\r\n     we find ourselves to-day.[18]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps Mr. Belloc's most valuable contribution to the study of\r\nmodern English history that he has destroyed piecemeal that\r\nunintelligent, unhistorical and false statement, found in innumerable\r\ntextbooks and taught so glibly in our schools and universities, that\r\n\"the horrors of the industrial system were a blind and necessary product\r\nof material and impersonal forces\"; and has shown us instead that:\r\n\r\n     The vast growth of the proletariat, the concentration of ownership\r\n     into the hands of a few owners, and the exploitation by those\r\n     owners of the mass of the community, had no fatal or necessary\r\n     connection with the discovery of new and perpetually improving\r\n     methods of production. The evil proceeded in direct historical\r\n     sequence, proceeded patently and demonstrably, from the fact that\r\n     England, the seed plot of the industrial system, was _already_\r\n     captured by a wealthy oligarchy _before_ the series of great\r\n     discoveries began.[19]\r\n\r\nWe see then that the slave of the Roman villa, a being both economically\r\nand politically unfree, developed throughout North-Western Europe, in\r\nthe course of the thousand years or more of the uninterrupted growth of\r\nthe Church, first into the serf and then into the peasant, a being both\r\neconomically and politically free:\r\n\r\n     The three forms under which labour was exercised--the serf, secure\r\n     in his position, and burdened only with regular dues, which were\r\n     but a fraction of his produce; the freeholder, a man independent\r\n     save for money dues, which were more of a tax than a rent; the\r\n     Guild, in which well-divided capital worked co-operatively for\r\n     craft production, for transport and for commerce--all three between\r\n     them were making for a society which should be based upon the\r\n     principle of property. All, or most--the normal family--should own.\r\n     And on ownership the freedom of the State should repose.... Slavery\r\n     had gone and in its place had come that establishment of free\r\n     possession which seemed so normal to men, and so consonant to a\r\n     happy human life. No particular name was then found for it. To-day,\r\n     and now that it has disappeared, we must construct an awkward one,\r\n     and say that the Middle Ages had instinctively conceived and\r\n     brought into existence the Distributive State.[20]\r\n\r\nBy the mishandling of an artificial economic revolution which was so\r\nsudden as to be overwhelming, namely, the Dissolution of the\r\nMonasteries, an England which was economically free, was turned into the\r\nEngland we know to-day, \"of which at least one-third is indigent, of\r\nwhich nineteen-twentieths are dispossessed of capital and of land, and\r\nof which the whole industry and national life is controlled upon its\r\neconomic side by a few chance directors of millions, a few masters of\r\nunsocial and irresponsible monopolies.\"\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Belloc traces the growth and development of our economic\r\nconditions. In _The Servile State_ he goes further and shows what new\r\nconditions are rapidly developing out of those now in existence.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, we know, the economic freedom of\r\nnineteen-twentieths of the English people has disappeared. Will their\r\npolitical freedom also disappear?\r\n\r\nTo this question Mr. Belloc's answer is as decided as it is startling.\r\nHe does not argue that the political freedom of the proletariat may\r\npossibly disappear. He says that it has _already begun_ to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe Capitalist State, he argues, in which all are free but in which the\r\nmeans of production are in the hands of a few, grows unstable in\r\nproportion as it grows perfect. The internal strains which render it\r\nunstable are, first, the conflict between its social realities and its\r\nmoral and legal basis, and, second, the insecurity to which it condemns\r\nfree citizens; the fact, that is, that the few possessors can grant or\r\nwithhold livelihood from the many non-possessors. There are only three\r\nsolutions of this instability. These are, the distributive solution, the\r\ncollectivist solution, and the servile solution. Of these three stable\r\nsocial arrangements the reformer, owing to the Christian traditions of\r\nsociety, will not advocate the introduction of the servile state, which\r\nMr. Belloc defines as \"that arrangement of society in which so\r\nconsiderable a number of the families and individuals are constrained by\r\npositive law to labour for the advantage of other families and\r\nindividuals as to stamp the whole community with the mark of such\r\nlabour.\" If this arrangement be not advocated, there remain only the\r\ndistributive and the collectivist solutions. Collectivism being to a\r\ncertain extent a natural development of Capitalism and appealing both to\r\ncapitalist and proletarian, is apparently the easier solution. But, says\r\nMr. Belloc--and this is the kernel of his whole thesis--the Collectivist\r\ntheory _in action_ does not produce Collectivism, but something quite\r\ndifferent; namely, the Servile State. There is only one way, according\r\nto Mr. Belloc's argument, in which Collectivism can be put into force,\r\nand that is by confiscation. The reformer is not allowed to confiscate,\r\nbut he is allowed to do all he can to establish security and sufficiency\r\nfor the non-owners. In attaining this object he inevitably establishes\r\nservile conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of this extraordinarily valuable book Mr. Belloc\r\npoints to various examples of servile legislation, either already to be\r\nfound on the Statute Book or in process of being put there. He is\r\nconvinced that the re-establishment of the servile status in industrial\r\nsociety is already upon us; but records it as an impression, though no\r\nmore than an impression, that the Servile State, strong as the tide is\r\nmaking for it in Prussia and in England to-day, will be modified,\r\nchecked, perhaps defeated in war, certainly halted in its attempt to\r\nestablish itself completely by the strong reaction which such free\r\nsocieties as France and Ireland upon its flank will perpetually\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Historic Thames_, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Historic Thames_, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Servile State_, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Ib._, p. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Historic Thames_, p. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Servile State_, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Servile State_, p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Ib._, p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Servile State_, p. 49.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, unfortunately, in so brief a summary of Mr. Belloc's\r\nviews, even to suggest with what force of argument and wealth of example\r\nhe supports the thesis of _The Servile State_. What that thesis is it\r\nmay be well to state in full. Mr. Belloc says that _The Servile State_\r\nwas written \"to maintain and prove the following truth\":\r\n\r\n     That our free modern society in which the means of production are\r\n     owned by a few being necessarily in unstable equilibrium, it is\r\n     tending to reach a condition of stable equilibrium by the\r\n     establishment of compulsory labour legally enforcible upon those\r\n     who do not own the means of production for the advantage of those\r\n     who do. With this principle of compulsion applied against the\r\n     non-owners there must also come a difference in their status; and\r\n     in the eyes of society and of its positive law men will be divided\r\n     into two sets; the first economically free and politically free,\r\n     possessed of the means of production, and securely confirmed in\r\n     that possession; the second economically unfree and politically\r\n     unfree, but at first secured by their very lack of freedom in\r\n     certain necessaries of life and in a minimum of well-being beneath\r\n     which they shall not fall.[21]\r\n\r\nNow, the reader who has followed the brief summary of the preceding\r\nchapter cannot fail to arrive at a consideration of apparently cardinal\r\nimportance. Even if he be convinced--as we are convinced--that the\r\nservile state is actually upon us, he will yet feel that a people still\r\npolitically free will never allow what is to-day but a young growth to\r\nattain its full stature. The English people, he will argue, hold their\r\nown destiny in their own hand. We already possess all but manhood\r\nsuffrage; and, until that power is taken from us, which it could never\r\nbe without a fierce struggle, we possess a weapon with which any and\r\nevery attempt to re-introduce the servile status can successfully be\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nA man reasoning thus should ask himself two questions: first, does the\r\nproletariat object to the re-introduction of the servile status,\r\nprovided it brings with it security and sufficiency? second, does the\r\nenjoyment of a wide suffrage connote the power of self-government?\r\n\r\nThese are questions which every intelligent man must be able to answer\r\nfor himself, and, if he answer them honestly, his answers, we think,\r\nwill agree with those Mr. Belloc has given. In _The Servile State_ he\r\naffirms what we all know to be the fact, that the English proletariat of\r\nto-day would not merely fail to reject the servile status, but would\r\nwelcome it. He puts the matter in this way:\r\n\r\n     If you were to approach those millions of families now living at a\r\n     wage with the proposal for the contract of service for life,\r\n     guaranteeing them employment at what each regarded as his usual\r\n     full wage, how many would refuse?\r\n\r\n     Such a contract would, of course, involve a loss of freedom; a life\r\n     contract of the kind is, to be accurate, no contract at all. It is\r\n     the negation of contract and the acceptation of status.[22]\r\n\r\nEvery thinking man knows that the number to reject such a proposal would\r\nbe insignificant.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the great mass of the English people, the majority, that is,\r\nof the voters, is prepared to welcome rather than to reject the\r\nre-introduction of slavery, the possession or non-possession of the\r\npower to reject it appears immaterial.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, however, an extreme case. Let us suppose an attempt to\r\nreduce the wage-earners to slavery without guaranteeing them sufficiency\r\nand security. There are many amiable maniacs who would be willing to\r\nsupport such an attempt, though we cannot believe that their efforts\r\nwould be rewarded with success. They would be rewarded with revolution.\r\n\r\nThis is a point upon which too great insistence cannot be laid. Such an\r\nattempt, if it were ever made, would produce a revolution: it would not\r\nbe quashed in a General Election or by any other form of constitutional\r\nprocedure, because, as a fact, the English people have no constitutional\r\npower.\r\n\r\nUltimately, of course, the power of government can only rest with the\r\nmajority of the people, but in practice that power is often taken from\r\nthem. It has been taken from the English people.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the two great simple truths which underlie Mr. Belloc's\r\nwhole attitude towards the public affairs of the England of to-day:\r\n\r\nFirst, we are economically unfree.\r\n\r\nSecond, we are politically unfree.[23]\r\n\r\nThe causes of the existence of the first condition are analysed, as we\r\nhave seen, in _The Servile State_; the causes of the second are analysed\r\nin _The Party System_.\r\n\r\nWith the prime truths of this book every man possessing but the most\r\nelementary knowledge of political science and constitutional history is\r\nfamiliar. They were proved by Bagehot many years ago, and no observant\r\nman of average intelligence can fail to realize them for himself to-day.\r\nBriefly, they are these. The representative system existing in England,\r\nwhich was meant to be an organ of democracy, is actually an engine of\r\noligarchy. \"Instead of the executive being controlled by the\r\nrepresentative assembly, it controls it. Instead of the demands of the\r\npeople being expressed for them by their representatives, the matters\r\ndiscussed by the representatives are settled, not by the people, not\r\neven by themselves, but by the very body which it is the business of the\r\nrepresentative assembly to check and control.\"\r\n\r\nThese truths are to-day common knowledge. We all know that the power of\r\ngovernment does not reside in practice with the people, but with some\r\nbody which remains for most of us undefined. It is the peculiar service\r\nof the authors of _The Party System_ to have defined that body for us\r\nand to have exposed its nature and composition. Bagehot referred to this\r\nbody as the Cabinet; in _The Party System_ it is shown that this body is\r\nreally composed of the members of the two Front Benches, which form \"one\r\nclose oligarchical corporation, admission to which is only to be gained\r\nby the consent of those who have already secured places therein.\" The\r\ngreater number, and by far the most important members, of this\r\ncorporation enter by right of relationship, and these family ties are\r\nnot confined to the separate sides of the House. They unite the\r\nMinisterial with the Opposition Front Bench as closely as they unite\r\nMinisters and ex-Ministers to each other. There is thus formed a\r\ngoverning group which has attained absolute control over the procedure\r\nof the House of Commons. It can settle how much time shall be given to\r\nthe discussion of any subject, and therefore, in effect, determine\r\nwhether any particular measure shall have a chance of passing into law.\r\nIt can also settle what subjects may be discussed and what may be said\r\non those subjects. Further, this group has at its disposal large funds\r\nwhich are secretly subscribed and secretly disbursed, and, by the use of\r\nthese funds, as well as by other means, it is able to control elections\r\nand decide to a considerable extent who shall be the representatives of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nCan this system be mended? Is any reform possible within the system\r\nitself? As long ago as 1899, in the first important book he published,\r\nMr. Belloc wrote these words:\r\n\r\n     ... the _Mandat Imperatif_, the brutal and decisive weapon of the\r\n     democrats, the binding by an oath of all delegates, the mechanical\r\n     responsibility against which Burke had pleaded at Bristol, which\r\n     the American constitution vainly attempted to exclude in its\r\n     principal election, and which must in the near future be the method\r\n     of our final reforms.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking example of the solidity of Mr. Belloc's opinions to\r\nfind him expressing, twelve years later, exactly the same views. He went\r\ninto Parliament in 1906 holding this view; he came out of Parliament in\r\n1910 confirmed in it. In 1911, the only possible means of reforming our\r\nParliamentary system, so far as he can see, is this:\r\n\r\n     It might be possible, by scattering and using a sufficient number\r\n     of trained workers, to extract from candidates definite pledges\r\n     during the electoral period.... The principal pledge which should\r\n     and could be extracted from candidates would be a pledge that they\r\n     would vote against the Government--whatever its composition--unless\r\n     there were carried through the House of Commons, within a set time,\r\n     those measures to which they stood pledged already in their\r\n     election addresses and on the platform.\r\n\r\nBut, just as Mr. Belloc realizes that the power of government must\r\nalways rest ultimately with the majority of the people, so he realizes\r\nthat all final reforms are brought about by the will of the majority.\r\nConsequently, the first need in the attempt to remedy any evil is\r\nexposure. The political education of democracy is the first step towards\r\na reform.\r\n\r\n     To tell a particular truth with regard to a particular piece of\r\n     corruption is, of course, dangerous in the extreme; the rash man\r\n     who might be tempted to employ this weapon would find himself\r\n     bankrupted or in prison, and probably both. But the general nature\r\n     of the unpleasant thing can be drilled into the public by books,\r\n     articles, and speeches.\r\n\r\nThis is the whole secret of Mr. Belloc's actions as a reformer. His\r\nwhole object, as has already been said in another connection, is to\r\ninstruct public opinion. His views and opinions are to be found clearly\r\nexpressed in books, but he is not content merely to express his views as\r\nintellectual propositions, he is supremely anxious to convince men of\r\nthe truth and justice of his views, and to inspire men to action. Just\r\nas he regards history as the record of the actions of men like\r\nourselves, so he regards the evils of the present day as the result of\r\nmen's actions and men's apathy. His whole object is to check those\r\nactions and uproot that apathy.\r\n\r\nIt was with this object that he founded, in 1911, the weekly journal\r\ncalled _The Eye-Witness_, the chief aim of which was to conduct a steady\r\nand unflinching campaign against the evils of the Party System and of\r\nCapitalism, and a notable feature of Mr. Belloc's editorship was that\r\nthe paper, during the time he was connected with it, reached and\r\nmaintained an extraordinarily high literary standard. It is a matter of\r\nregret that Mr. Belloc, owing to a variety of circumstances, was\r\nobliged, in the early part of 1912, to resign the position of editor of\r\nthe paper which he founded and which now, under the title of _The New\r\nWitness_, is edited by Mr. Cecil Chesterton.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that the campaign which Mr. Belloc then\r\ninitiated has achieved some measure of success. Although it is\r\nimpossible to point to any organized body of opinion which definitely\r\nsupports Mr. Belloc's views on economic and political reform, yet it is\r\nundeniable that those views have taken root and are to-day far more\r\ncommon than at the time either _The Party System_ was written, or _The\r\nEye-Witness_ founded. This has come about by a very simple process--a\r\nprocess which Mr. Belloc himself has analysed. In the last pages of _The\r\nParty System_ there occurs this passage:\r\n\r\n     Truth has this particular quality about it (which the modern\r\n     defenders of falsehood seem to have forgotten), that when it has\r\n     been so much as suggested, it of its own self and by example tends\r\n     to turn that suggestion into a conviction.\r\n\r\n     You say to some worthy provincial, \"English Prime Ministers sell\r\n     peerages and places on the Front Bench.\"\r\n\r\n     He is startled, and he disbelieves you; but when a few days\r\n     afterwards he reads in his newspaper of how some howling nonentity\r\n     has just been made a peer, or a member of the Government, the\r\n     incredible sentence he has heard recurs to him. When in the course\r\n     of the next twelve months five or six other nonentities have\r\n     enjoyed this sort of promotion (one of whom perhaps he may know\r\n     from other sources than the Press to be a wealthy man who uses his\r\n     wealth in bribery) his doubt grows into conviction.\r\n\r\n     That is the way truth spreads....\r\n\r\n     The truth, when it is spoken for some useful purpose, must\r\n     necessarily seem obscure, extravagant, or merely false; for, were\r\n     it of common knowledge, it would not be worth expressing. And truth\r\n     being fact, and therefore hard, must irritate and wound; but it has\r\n     that power of growth and creation peculiar to itself which always\r\n     makes it worth the telling.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Servile State_, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Servile State_, p. 140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The reader should take care to distinguish between the\r\nphrase \"politically unfree,\" as connoting the lack of constitutional\r\npower, and the phrase \"politically unfree,\" used by Mr. Belloc in _The\r\nServile State_ as connoting the lack of a free status in positive law,\r\nand therefore the presence of servile conditions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE HUMORIST\r\n\r\n\r\nHumour is the instrument of the critic. If the psychological explanation\r\nof laughter be, as some have supposed, the sight of \"a teleological\r\nbeing suddenly behaving in an ateleological manner,\" then the mere act\r\nof laughter is in itself an act of comparison and of criticism. The true\r\ncastigator of morals has never striven to make his subjects appear\r\ndisgraceful, but to make them appear ridiculous. Except in the case of\r\npositive crime, for example, murder or treason, the true instrument of\r\nthe censor is burlesque. It fails him only when his subject is\r\nconsciously and deliberately breaking a moral law: it is irresistible\r\nwhen its target is a false moral law or convention of morals set up to\r\nprotect anti-social practices. Among these we may reckon bribery of\r\npoliticians, oppression of the poor, vulgar ostentation, the habit of\r\nadultery and the writing of bad verse. Aristophanes, Moliere, Byron, and\r\nDickens--these attempted to correct the social vices of their times by\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nBut humorous literature is not wholly confined to such practical ends.\r\nWe may derive pleasure from reading literary criticism for its own sake\r\nand not for the purpose of knowing what books to read: we also gain and\r\nrequire a pure pleasure from that constant criticism of human things\r\nwhich we call humour. It remains a function of criticism, as may be seen\r\nfrom the simple fact that no man was ever a good critic of anything\r\nunder the sun who had not a sense of humour. It is a perpetual\r\ncommentary on life, a constant guide to sanity. And a good joke, like a\r\ngood poem, enlarges the boundaries of the spirit and puts us in touch\r\nwith infinity. But too much abstract disquisition on the subject of\r\nhumour is a frequent cause of the lack of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc's first essays in humour were not of the satirical or\r\npurposeful sort: unless we consider an obscure volume called _Lambkin's\r\nRemains_ to be of this nature. The author has kept in affection, it\r\nwould seem, only one of these compositions sufficiently to reprint it\r\nout of a volume which can hardly now be obtained. Mr. Lambkin's poem,\r\nwritten for the Newdigate Prize in 1893 on the prescribed theme for that\r\nyear, \"The Benefits of the Electric Light,\" might fairly be considered a\r\nwarning to the examiners to set their subject with care.\r\n\r\nThe first of his popular essays in amusement, the one by which--owing to\r\nan accident of music--he is still best known, though anonymously, to a\r\nlarge public, is _The Bad Child's Book of Beasts_. Successors in a\r\nsimilar manner are _More Beasts for Worse Children_ (delightful title),\r\n_A Moral Alphabet_, and _Cautionary Tales for Children_. These are\r\nsuccessful books for children, of a great popularity, and may be read\r\nwith considerable pleasure by elder persons.\r\n\r\nTo define the particular quality which makes them good is more than a\r\nlittle difficult. It is much easier to analyse and expose the virtues\r\nof the most affecting poetry than to explain what moves us in the\r\nmildest piece of humour. This is amply proved by the fact that\r\ninnumerable volumes exist on the origin of comedy and the cause of\r\nlaughter, and there are more to come: while, roughly speaking, even\r\nphilosophers are agreed as to the manner in which serious poetry touches\r\nus.\r\n\r\nA great deal, too, of the appeal of these pieces is due to the\r\nillustrations of B. T. B. which complement the text with an apt and\r\ngrotesque commentary. The pleasure given by the verse, perhaps, if one\r\nmay handle so delicate and trifling a thing, lies in a sort of\r\ninconsequence and unexpectedness. Witness the poem on the Yak:\r\n\r\n   Then tell your Papa where the Yak can be got,\r\n     And if he is awfully rich\r\n   He will buy you the creature--\r\n\r\n(The reader now turns over the page.)\r\n\r\n     Or else\r\n       he will _not_.\r\n   (I cannot be positive which.)\r\n\r\nOr it may reside in mere genial idiocy, as in _The Dodo_:\r\n\r\n   The Dodo used to walk around\r\n     And take the sun and air.\r\n   The Sun yet warms his native ground--\r\n     The Dodo is not there!\r\n\r\n   The voice which used to squawk and squeak\r\n     Is now for ever dumb--\r\n   Yet may you see his bones and beak\r\n     All in the Mu-se-um.\r\n\r\nThis is the quality which chiefly inspires the _Cautionary Tales_, that\r\nadmirable series of biographies. \"_Matilda, Who told Lies and was Burned\r\nto Death_\" is perhaps too well known to quote, but we may extract a\r\npassage from \"_Lord Lundy, who was too Freely Moved to Tears, and\r\nthereby ruined his Political Career_\":\r\n\r\n   It happened to Lord Lundy then,\r\n   As happens to so many men:\r\n   Towards the age of twenty-six,\r\n   They shoved him into politics;\r\n   In which profession he commanded\r\n   The income that his rank demanded\r\n   In turn as Secretary for\r\n   India, the Colonies and War.\r\n   But very soon his friends began\r\n   To doubt if he were quite the man:\r\n   Thus, if a member rose to say\r\n   (As members do from day to day),\r\n   \"Arising out of that reply...!\"\r\n   Lord Lundy would begin to cry.\r\n   A hint at harmless little jobs\r\n   Would shake him with convulsive sobs,\r\n   While as for Revelations, these\r\n   Would simply bring him to his knees\r\n   And leave him whimpering like a child.\r\n\r\nThis genial idiocy, this unexpectedness and inconsequence, are perhaps\r\nthe most characteristic qualities of his freest humour elsewhere. Take,\r\nfor example, the flavour of this singular remark from _The Four Men_.\r\nGrizzlebeard is telling, according to his oath, in a most serious\r\nfashion the story of his first love. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"I learnt ... that she had married a man whose fame had long been\r\n     familiar to me, a politician, a patriot, and a most capable\r\n     manufacturer.... Then strong, and at last (at such a price) mature,\r\n     I noted the hour and went towards the doors through which she had\r\n     entered perhaps an hour ago in the company of the man with whose\r\n     name she had mingled her own.\"\r\n\r\n     _Myself._ \"What did he manufacture?\"\r\n\r\n     _Grizzlebeard._ \"Rectified lard; and so well, let me tell you, that\r\n     no one could compete with him.\"\r\n\r\nLet the reader explain, if he can, the comic effect of that startling\r\nirrelevance; we cannot, but it is characteristic.\r\n\r\nIt is some effect of dexterity with words, some happy spring of\r\ninconsequence, which produces this particular kind of joke. A certain\r\nexuberance in writing which plainly intoxicates the writer and carries\r\nthe reader with it, is at the bottom of humour of this sort. What is it\r\nthat causes us to smile at the following passage, a disquisition on the\r\naptitude of the word \"surprising\"?\r\n\r\n     An elephant escapes from a circus and puts his head in at your\r\n     window while you are writing and thinking of a word. You look up.\r\n     You may be alarmed, you may be astonished, you may be moved to\r\n     sudden processes of thought; but one thing you will find about it,\r\n     and you will find out quite quickly, and it will dominate all your\r\n     other emotions of the time: the elephant's head will be surprising.\r\n     You are caught. Your soul says loudly to its Creator: \"Oh, this is\r\n     something new!\"\r\n\r\nOne might suggest that psychological analysis with an example so absurd\r\nprovokes the sense of the comic, but it is not quite that. It is not\r\nHeinesque irony, the concealment of an insult, nor Wilde's paradox, the\r\nburlesque of a truth. It is merely comic: a humorous facility in the use\r\nof words, though not barren as such things are apt to be, but quite\r\ncommon and human. The philosophical rules of laughter do not explain it:\r\nbut it is funny.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same attraction rests in a quite absurd essay, wherein\r\nMr. Belloc describes how he was waylaid by an inventor and, having\r\nsuffered the explanations of the man, retaliated with advice as to the\r\nmeans to pursue to get the new machine adopted. The technical terms\r\ninvented for both parties to the dialogue are deliciously idiotic, a\r\nsort of exalted abstract play with the dictionary of technology.\r\n\r\nIn descriptions of persons we are on safer ground, and the reader, if he\r\nstill care, after all we have said, for such-like foolishness, may\r\nexplain these jokes by the incongruity of teleological beings acting in\r\nan ateleological manner. We are determined to be content in picking out\r\npassages that amuse us and in commenting on them but by no means\r\nexplaining them.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc himself has invented or recorded the distinction between\r\nthings that would be funny anyhow, and things that are funny because\r\nthey are true. Most of his jokes fall into the second category. The\r\nGerman baron at Oxford, the gentleman who asked when and for what action\r\nLord Charles Beresford received his title, the poet who wrote a poem\r\ncontaining the lines:\r\n\r\n   Neither the nations of the East, nor the nations of the West,\r\n   Have thought the thing Napoleon thought was to their interest,\r\n\r\nall these people are admirably funny because they do, or very well\r\nmight, exist. In fact, most of Mr. Belloc's humour is observation, a\r\nslow delicate savouring of human stupidity and pretence.\r\n\r\nThe sporadic stories in his books are funny because, at least, we can\r\nbelieve them to be true. Read this from _Esto Perpetua_:\r\n\r\n     An old man, small, bent, and full of energy opened the door to\r\n     me.... \"I was expecting you,\" he said. I remembered that the driver\r\n     had promised to warn him, and I was grateful.\r\n\r\n     \"I have prepared you a meal,\" he went on. Then, after a little\r\n     hesitation, \"It is mutton: it is neither hot nor cold.\" ... He\r\n     brought me their very rough African wine and a loaf, and sat down\r\n     opposite me, looking at me fixedly under the candle. Then he said:\r\n\r\n     \"To-morrow you will see Timgad, which is the most wonderful town in\r\n     the world.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Certainly not to-night,\" I answered; to which he said, \"No!\"\r\n\r\n     I took a bite of the food, and he at once continued rapidly:\r\n     \"Timgad is a marvel. We call it 'the marvel.' I had thought of\r\n     calling this house 'Timgad the Marvel,' or, again, 'Timgad\r\n     the----'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Is this sheep?\" I said.\r\n\r\n     \"Certainly,\" he answered. \"What else could it be but sheep?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Good Lord!\" I said, \"it might be anything. There is no lack of\r\n     beasts on God's earth.\" I took another bite and found it horrible.\r\n\r\n     \"I desire you to tell me frankly,\" said I, \"whether this is goat.\r\n     There are many Italians in Africa, and I shall not blame any man\r\n     for giving me goat's flesh. The Hebrew prophets ate it and the\r\n     Romans; only tell me the truth, for goat is bad for me.\"\r\n\r\n     He said it was not goat. Indeed, I believed him, for it was of a\r\n     large and terrible sort, as though it had roamed the hills and\r\n     towered above all goats and sheep. I thought of lions, but\r\n     remembered that their value would forbid their being killed for the\r\n     table. I again attempted the meal, and he again began:\r\n\r\n     \"Timgad is a place----\"\r\n\r\n     At this moment a god inspired me, and I shouted, \"Camel!\" He did\r\n     not turn a hair. I put down my knife and fork, and pushed the plate\r\n     away. I said:\r\n\r\n     \"You are not to be blamed for giving me the food of the country,\r\n     but for passing it under another name.\"\r\n\r\n     He was a good host and did not answer. He went out, and came back\r\n     with cheese. Then he said, as he put it down before me:\r\n\r\n     \"I do assure you it is sheep,\" and we discussed the point no more.\r\n\r\nThat is an amusing episode and wholly characteristic. The humour of Mr.\r\nBelloc's books, particularly of his books of travel, resides in a\r\nquantity of such tales, not acutely and extravagantly funny, but all\r\namusing because they are all (apparently) true.\r\n\r\nWith that more practical branch of humour, satire, the angle of view\r\nshifts a little. The power of making laughter becomes here a weapon, and\r\nits hostile purpose, as it were, sharpens the point. Mr. Belloc's satire\r\nhas a hardness and a precision lacking in the broad and general effects\r\nof his quite irresponsible humour.\r\n\r\nAll satire, as we have said, has a definite moral intent, whether it be\r\nto restrain a corrupt politician or a bad poet, and this makes it\r\nserious, sometimes painful, always, in failure, heavy and unpleasant.\r\nThe little book called _The Aftermath: or Caliban's Guide to Letters_ is\r\nnot altogether a success. One might believe that Mr. Belloc's disgust\r\nwith the tricks of journalism has killed, as never his disgust with the\r\ntricks of government, his sense of joy in human pretence. These\r\nsketches, by just a little, fail to give one a feeling of rejoicing in\r\nthe author's wit: they seem bitter, strained, and, while one appreciates\r\nthe justice of the serious charge, the humour which was to carry it off,\r\nbecomes from time to time heavy and lifeless. It is even a depressing\r\nbook: but this may be because the deepest rooted of our illusions,\r\ndeeper than the illusion about politics, is the illusion concerning the\r\ncleverness of authors.\r\n\r\nThe skit, written with Mr. G. K. Chesterton, on the proceedings of the\r\nTariff Reform Commission, is, on the other hand, one shout of laughter:\r\nas though that singular inquiry could not raise bitterness or indeed any\r\nemotion but delight in the breasts of true observers of humanity. It is\r\na pity it is no longer obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe two or three satirical poems show a very definite and determined\r\npurpose, a sort of ugly competent squaring of the fists, a fighting that\r\npleases by clean hard hitting.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a great pleasure to Mr. Belloc to write:\r\n\r\n   We also know the sacred height\r\n     Up on Tugela side,\r\n   Where the three hundred fought with Beit\r\n     And fair young Wernher died.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   The little empty homes forlorn,\r\n   The ruined synagogues that mourn\r\n     In Frankfort and Berlin;\r\n   We knew them when the peace was torn--\r\n   We of a nobler lineage born--\r\n   And now by all the gods of scorn\r\n     We mean to rub them in.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a great relief, too, to have planted such sound and\r\nswinging blows on the enemy's person. The enemy is not appreciably\r\ninconvenienced, but--Mr. Belloc has probably told himself--a few have\r\nchuckled, and that begins it.\r\n\r\nIn such a way we come naturally to the five satirical novels, obviously\r\nan illustration of the passage in _The Party System_, where Mr. Belloc\r\nadvocates the annulling of political evils by laughing at them. It is\r\nnot our business here to analyse these compositions from the point of\r\nview of considering the amount of political usefulness they may have\r\nachieved. We must consider rather Mr. Belloc's fine, contented industry\r\nin his satiric task, the persistence with which he builds up his\r\ninstrument of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe method in these books is exclusively ironic. Never does the writer\r\novertly state that he seeks to drag down a system which he hates by\r\nlaughter. In _Emmanuel Burden_, that extraordinary book, the severity of\r\nthe method is extreme, almost overwhelming. The author supposes himself\r\nto be writing a biography especially designed to uphold the principles\r\nof \"Cosmopolitan Finance--pitiless, destructive of all national ideals,\r\nobscene, and eating out the heart of our European tradition\": and he\r\npreserves that pose consistently.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, for example, in _Mr. Clutterbuck's Election_, the pretence is\r\nless elaborate: winks and nudges to the reader are permitted, and the\r\nwhole effect is less careful and more human, less bitter and more\r\nhumorous. But the general tone is maintained throughout the five books,\r\ndiscussing the same characters who appear and reappear, the Peabody Yid,\r\nMary Smith, the young and popular Prime Minister, \"Methlinghamhurtht,\r\nClutterbuck that wath,\" and the excellent Mr. William Bailey, who had\r\nthe number 666 on his shirts, subscribed to anti-Semitic societies on\r\nthe Continent and cherished with a peculiar affection _The Jewish\r\nEncyclopaedia_. Such a preservation of tone is admirable, for it is a\r\nsubtly restrained acidity, requiring either intense and unremitting care\r\n(which seems unlikely) or a special adjustment of temperament. It is\r\nvery Gaulish, it must have been modelled on Voltaire: but it is also\r\nenlivened with flashes of irresponsibility that are the author's own.\r\n\r\nTo have composed five such volumes as, taking them in order, _Emmanuel\r\nBurden_, _Mr. Clutterbuck's Election_, _A Change in the Cabinet_, _Pongo\r\nand the Bull_, and _The Green Overcoat_, is an achievement of a very\r\nremarkable sort, the more remarkable that the interest of these stories\r\nlies entirely in Mr. Belloc's peculiar views upon politics and finance.\r\nEven Disraeli, who liked writing novels about politics, could not\r\nrestrain himself from love interests, romance, poetry, and what not\r\nelse: but Mr. Belloc, serious and intent, concentrates his energies with\r\nmalevolent smile on one object.\r\n\r\nIn this consistent level of irony there are undoubtedly exalted patches\r\nof more than merely verbal humour, such as, for example, Sir Charles\r\nRepton's jolly speech at the Van Diemens meeting, in which he outlines\r\nwith enormous gusto the principles of procedure of modern finance. (It\r\nwill be remembered that an unfortunate accident had deprived Sir Charles\r\nof his power of restraint and afflicted him with Veracititis.)\r\n\r\n     \"Well, there you are then [he says], a shilling, a miserable\r\n     shilling. Now just see what that shilling will do!\r\n\r\n     \"In the first place it'll give publicity and plenty of it. Breath\r\n     of public life, publicity! Breath o' finance too! We'll have that\r\n     railway marked in a dotted line on the maps: all the maps: school\r\n     maps: office maps. We'll have leaders on it and speeches on it. And\r\n     good hearty attacks on it. And th-e-n ...\" He lowered his voice to\r\n     a very confidential wheedle--\"the price'll begin to creep up--Oh\r\n     ... o ... oh! the _real_ price, my beloved fellow-shareholders, the\r\n     price at which one can really _sell_, the price at which one can\r\n     handle the _stuff_.\"\r\n\r\n     He gave a great breath of satisfaction. \"Now d'ye see? It'll go to\r\n     forty shillings right off, it ought to go to forty-five, it may go\r\n     to sixty!... And then,\" he said briskly, suddenly changing his\r\n     tone, \"then, my hearties, you blasted well sell out: you unload ...\r\n     you dump 'em. Plenty more fools where your lot came from.... Most\r\n     of you'll lose on your first price: late comers least: a few o'\r\n     ye'll make if you bought under two pounds. Anyhow I shall....\r\n     There! if that isn't finance, I don't know what is!\"\r\n\r\nThat is great, it is humour of a positively enormous variety, and pure\r\nhumour bursting and shining through the careful web of purposeful irony.\r\n\r\nSuch is the tendency of Mr. Belloc in his most intent occupations, to be\r\nsuddenly overcome with a rush of something broad, human and jolly, in a\r\nword, poetic. In these moments he abandons his theories and his\r\npropaganda and sails off before the inspiration. By such passages, as\r\nmuch as or more than by their constant flow of skilful jeering, these\r\nbooks will last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELLER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a verse which criticism, baffled but revengeful, will not easily let\r\ndie, it has been stated that \"Mr. Hilaire Belloc Is a case for\r\nlegislation _ad hoc_. He seems to think nobody minds His books being all\r\nof different kinds.\" They certainly do mind. They ask what an author\r\n_is_. Mr. Bennett is a novelist, and so, one supposes, is Mr. Wells; Mr.\r\nShaw and Mr. Barker are dramatists; Mr. W. L. Courtney is a Critic, and\r\nMr. Noyes, they say, is a Poet.\r\n\r\nThere is, after all, a certain justice in the query. A novelist may also\r\nwrite a play or a sociological treatise: he remains a novelist and we\r\nknow him for what he is. What, then, is Mr. Belloc? If we examine his\r\nworks by a severely arithmetical test, we shall find that the greater\r\npart of them is devoted to description of travel. You will find his\r\ngreatest earnestness, perhaps his greatest usefulness, in his history:\r\nbut his travel lies behind his history and informs it. It is the most\r\nimportant of the materials out of which his history has been made.\r\n\r\nThe clue, then, that we find in the preponderance among his writings of\r\nbooks and essays drawn directly from experience of travel is neither\r\naccidental nor meaningless. All this has been a _training_ to him, and\r\nwe should miss the most important factor not only in what he has done,\r\nbut also in what he may do, did we omit consideration of this.\r\n\r\nTravel, in the oldest of platitudes, is an education: and here we would\r\nuse this word in the widest possible sense as indicating the practical\r\neducation, which is a means to an end, a preparation for doing\r\nsomething, and the spiritual education which is a preparation for being\r\nsomething. In both these ways, travel is good and widens the mind: and\r\nhere, as in his history, we can distinguish the two motives. One is\r\npractical and propagandist, the other poetic, the passion for knowing\r\nand understanding. Travel, considered under these heads, gives the\r\nobservant mind a fund of comparison and information upon agricultural\r\neconomy, modes of religion, political forms, the growth of trade and the\r\nmovement of armies, and gives also to the receptive spirit a sense of\r\nactive and reciprocal contact with the earth which nourishes us and\r\nwhich we inhabit.\r\n\r\nThese moods and motives seem to be unhappily scarce in the life of this\r\nage. Neither understandingly, like poets, nor unconsciously (or, at\r\nleast, dumbly), like peasants, are we aware of the places in which we\r\nlive. We make no pilgrimages to holy spots, nor have we wandering\r\nstudents who mark out and acutely set down the distinctions between this\r\npeople and that. Facilities of travel have perhaps damped our desire to\r\nhear news of other countries. They have not given us in exchange a store\r\nof accurate information. Curiosity has died without being satisfied.\r\nBoth materially and spiritually, we and our society suffer for it: our\r\nlives are not so large, we make more stupid and more universal blunders\r\nin dealing with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nOf the spiritual incentive to travel, Mr. Belloc has put this\r\ndescription into the mouth of a character in an essay:\r\n\r\n     Look you, good people all, in your little passage through the\r\n     daylight, get to see as many hills and buildings and rivers,\r\n     fields, books, men, horses, ships and precious stones as you can\r\n     possibly manage. Or else stay in one village and marry in it and\r\n     die there. For one of these two fates is the best fate for every\r\n     man. Either to be what I have been, a wanderer with all the\r\n     bitterness of it, or to stay at home and to hear in one's garden\r\n     the voice of God.\r\n\r\nThere you have the voice of Wandering Peter, who hoped to make himself\r\nloved in Heaven by his tales of many countries. On the other hand, you\r\nhave Mr. Belloc's voice of deadly common sense adjuring this age, before\r\nit is too late, to move about a little and see what the world really is,\r\nand how one institution is at its best in one country and another in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n     Without any doubt whatsoever [he says] the one characteristic of\r\n     the towns is the lack of reality in the impressions of the many:\r\n     now we live in towns: and posterity will be astounded at us! It\r\n     isn't only that we get our impressions for the most part as\r\n     imaginary pictures called up by printers' ink--that would be bad\r\n     enough; but by some curious perversion of the modern mind,\r\n     printers' ink ends by actually preventing one from seeing things\r\n     that are there; and sometimes, when one says to another who has not\r\n     travelled, \"Travel!\" one wonders whether, after all, if he does\r\n     travel, he will see the things before his eyes? If he does, he will\r\n     find a new world; and there is more to be discovered in this\r\n     fashion to-day than ever there was.\r\n\r\nIt is Mr. Belloc's habit, an arrogant and aggressive habit, not to be\r\ndrugged if he can avoid it with the repetition of phrases, but to\r\ndissolve these things, when they are dissoluble, with the acid of facts.\r\nHe applies his method, as we have already seen, in history: in travel,\r\nthe precursor of history, he strives to be as truthful and as\r\nclear-sighted.\r\n\r\nHe wishes to report with accuracy--as a mediaeval traveller wished to\r\nreport--what he has seen in foreign lands. He looks about him with a\r\ncertain candour, a certain openness to impressions, which is only\r\nequalled, we think, among his contemporaries by the whimsical and\r\ncapricious Mr. Hueffer: an artist whose interest lies wholly in\r\nliterature, and whose mania it is rather to write well than to arrest\r\nthe decay of our world.\r\n\r\nIn the essay which we have quoted above, Mr. Belloc continues:\r\n\r\n     The wise man, who really wants to see things as they are and to\r\n     understand them, does not say: \"Here I am on the burning soil of\r\n     Africa.\" He says: \"Here I am stuck in a snowdrift and the train\r\n     twelve hours late\"--as it was (with me in it) near Setif, in\r\n     January, 1905. He does not say as he looks on the peasant at his\r\n     plough outside Batna: \"Observe yon Semite!\" He says: \"That man's\r\n     face is exactly like the face of a dark Sussex peasant, only a\r\n     little leaner.\" He does not say: \"See these wild sons of the\r\n     desert! How they must hate the new artificial life around them!\"\r\n     Contrariwise, he says: \"See those four Mohammedans playing cards\r\n     with a French pack of cards and drinking liqueurs in the cafe! See!\r\n     they have ordered more liqueurs!\"\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Belloc would have us go about the world as much like little\r\nchildren as possible in order to learn the elements of foreign politics.\r\n\r\nBut travel is also, quite in the sense of the platitude, an education.\r\nAll that we can learn in books is made up of, or springs from, the\r\ndifference between the men living on the banks of this river, and the\r\nmen who live in the valleys of those hills. The man who understands the\r\ndistinctions of costumes, manners, methods and thought which thus exist,\r\nis tolerably well equipped for dealing with such problems in his own\r\ncountry: he has had a practical education which prepares him for life.\r\n\r\nMr. Belloc goes about the world with a ready open mind, and stores up\r\nobservations on these matters. In an essay on a projected guide-book he\r\nsets out some of them--how to pacify Arabs, how to frighten sheep-dogs,\r\nhow the people of Dax are the most horrible in all France, and so on.\r\nIt is a great pity that the book has never been written.\r\n\r\nAll this is human knowledge, of which he is avid. It has been gained\r\nfrom fellow wayfarers by the roadside and in inns. The persons he has\r\nmet and gravely noted on his travels are innumerable, and merely to read\r\nof them is an edification. His landscapes are mostly peopled, and if not\r\na man, perhaps the ghost of an army moves among them, for he is strongly\r\nof the belief that earth was made for humanity and is most lovable where\r\nit has been handled and moulded by men, in the marking out of fields and\r\nthe damming of rivers, till it becomes a garden.\r\n\r\nHis acquaintances of travel make a strange and entertaining gallery of\r\npeople. How admirable is the Arab who could not contain himself for\r\nthinking of the way his fruit trees bore, and the tinner of pots who\r\nimproved his trade with song, and the American who said that the\r\nMatterhorn was surprising. There is something restrained and credible in\r\nMr. Belloc's account of these curious beings. He seems to sit still and\r\nsavour their conversation: he hardly reports his own.\r\n\r\nHe conveys to the reader a solid and real impression of the men he has\r\nmet, and it is one of the most delightful parts of his work. They go and\r\ncome through the essays like minor characters in a novel written with\r\nprodigality of invention and genius. It is no exaggeration to say that\r\nthey are all interesting, persons one could wish to have met. They stand\r\nout with the same clearness, the same reality, as the landscapes and\r\nphysical features that Mr. Belloc describes: they bear the same witness\r\nto his curious gift for receiving an impression whole and clean, and\r\npresenting it again with lucidity.\r\n\r\nThis want of exaggeration we find again in the common-sense tone of his\r\ndescriptions. He makes no literary fuss about being in the open air:\r\nperhaps because he did not discover the value of the atmosphere as a\r\nstimulant for literature, but always naturally knew it as a proper\r\ningredient in life. He is no George Borrow. There is a reality in his\r\ntravels that may seem to some often far from poetical: dark shadows and\r\npatches about food and its absence, and a despair when marching in the\r\nrain which is anything but romantic. He is not self-conscious when\r\nspeaking of countries, and his boasting of miles covered and places seen\r\nhas always an essential modesty in it. He disdains no common-sense aid\r\nto travel, neither the railway nor his meals; he seems to keep\r\nexcellently in touch with his boots and his appetite, and to those\r\nkindred points his most surprising rhapsodies are true.\r\n\r\nTake as an illustration the end of his admirable and discerning judgment\r\nupon the inns in the Pyrenees:\r\n\r\n     In all Sobrarbe, there are but the inns of Bielsa and Torla (I mean\r\n     in all the upper valleys which I have described) that can be\r\n     approached without fear, and in Bielsa, as in Venasque and Torla,\r\n     the little place has but one. At Bielsa, it is near the bridge and\r\n     is kept by Pedro Pertos: I have not slept in it, but I believe it\r\n     to be clean and good. El Plan has a Posada called the Posada of the\r\n     Sun (del Sol), but it is not praised; nay, it is detested by those\r\n     who speak from experience. The inn that stands or stood at the\r\n     lower part of the Val d'Arazas is said to be good; that at Torla is\r\n     not so much an inn as an old chief's house or manor called that of\r\n     \"Viu,\" for that is the name of the family that owns it. They treat\r\n     travellers very well.\r\n\r\n     This is all that I know of the inns of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThat is practical writing, admirably done, and, as we should judge,\r\nwithout having tested it, no less likely to be useful to the traveller\r\nbecause it is a prose of literary flavour. On the other hand, the\r\npersonal avowal in the last sentence gives confidence.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to look at Mr. Belloc's travels from what we loosely\r\ncall the practical point of view, and we arrive now at those books in\r\nwhich travel is the means to the pursuit of a certain sort of study.\r\nThat is the study of history and, in particular, of military events,\r\nwhich can properly be carried out only on the ground where these took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWe have said that his travel is the material out of which his history is\r\nmade, and that, though a wide generalization, is to a great extent\r\nstrictly accurate. His notion of the Western race and its solidarity\r\nderives its force not only from a careful and vigorous interpretation of\r\nwritten records, but also from observation of that race to-day. You may\r\nsee in _Esto Perpetua_ how he verified and amplified his theory very\r\npractically by a journey through Northern Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is true also that his gifts of clear-headedness and lucidity which\r\nmake valuable his interpretations of written records make it easy for\r\nhim to read country, to grasp its present possibilities and the effects\r\nwhich it must have had in the past. This steady gift of shrewd and apt\r\nvision of the things which really are makes him a useful monitor in a\r\ntime when men usually deal in gratuitously spun theories.\r\n\r\nHis eye for country is a symbol, as well as an example, of his best\r\ntalents. To him, it seems, a piece of ground, an English county, say, is\r\nan orderly shape, not the jumble of ups and downs, fields, roads and\r\nwoods which appears to most. In a similar way an historical controversy\r\nin his hands reveals its principal streams, its watershed, and the\r\ncharacter of its soil.\r\n\r\nAt this point, just as we distinguished in his history the practical\r\nfrom the poetic motive, we can see the blending of the two motives for\r\ntravel. Mr. Belloc's researches into history and pre-history do show\r\nthese motives inextricably mixed: in _The Old Road_ you cannot separate\r\nthe purpose of research from the purpose of this pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn this book he gives us a few remarks on the origin of the prehistoric\r\ntrack-way which ran from Winchester to Canterbury, an itinerary as exact\r\nas research can make it, and a little discourse on the reasons why it\r\nis both pious and pleasant to pursue such knowledge.\r\n\r\nSearching for Roman roads or the earlier track-ways and determining as\r\nnear as possible the exact sites of historical events is with him a\r\nsport. The method pursued is that of rigid and scientific inquiry.\r\n_Paris_ especially, _Marie Antoinette_ and _The Historic Thames_ in a\r\nlesser degree, bear witness to this, which, in a don, we should call\r\nminute and painstaking research, but which in our subject we guess to be\r\nthe gratification of a desire.\r\n\r\nIn _The Old Road_ Mr. Belloc describes with severe accuracy but with an\r\nastonishing gusto how, having read all that was printed about this track\r\nand studied the best maps of the region through which it passes, he set\r\nout to examine the ground itself, and thus to reach his final\r\nconclusions. We have not space here to recount his methods at length or\r\nto show, as he has shown, how this parish boundary is a guide here,\r\nthose trees there, that church a mile further on. It is but one example\r\nout of many of his spirit and tastes in the numerous tasks of\r\nidentification which he has undertaken.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the proper place, perhaps, to disengage what we have called\r\nthe poetic motive of travel. He manifests a particular reverence for\r\nthese rests of antiquity which he has sought out. It is both in a\r\nreligious and in a poetic spirit that he considers The Road as a symbol\r\nof humanity. He writes in a grave and ritual tone:\r\n\r\n     Of these primal things [he says] the least obvious but the most\r\n     important is The Road. It does not strike the sense as do those\r\n     others I have mentioned; we are slow to feel its influence. We take\r\n     it so much for granted that its original meaning escapes us. Men,\r\n     indeed, whose pleasure it is perpetually to explore even their own\r\n     country on foot, and to whom its every phase of climate is\r\n     delightful, receive, somewhat tardily, the spirit of The Road. They\r\n     feel a meaning in it: it grows to suggest the towns upon it, it\r\n     explains its own vagaries, and it gives a unity to all that has\r\n     arisen along its way. But for the mass The Road is silent; it is\r\n     the humblest and the most subtle, but, as I have said, the greatest\r\n     and most original of the spells which we inherit from the earliest\r\n     pioneers of our race. It was the most imperative and the first of\r\n     our necessities. It is older than building and than wells; before\r\n     we were quite men we knew it, for the animals still have it to-day;\r\n     they seek their food and their drinking-places and, as I believe,\r\n     their assemblies, by known ways which they have made.\r\n\r\nAll travel is a pilgrimage, more or less exalted, and a Catholic with a\r\nmind of Mr. Belloc's type makes the performance of such an act both a\r\nreligious ceremonial and a personal pleasure. He feels it to be no less\r\nan act of religion because it is full of jolly human and coloured\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nOut of this conception he has developed a new and personal form of the\r\nFantastic or Unbridled Book of Travels: much as Heine's form of the same\r\nthing developed from a faint reflection of a half-remembered tradition\r\nof Jean-Jacques Rousseau's praise of nature. It is odd to compare the\r\ntwo, Mr. Belloc on pilgrimage for his religion of normality and good\r\nfellowship, Heine walking in honour of the religion of wit.\r\n\r\nThe comparison indeed is inevitable: for these men, each solid, sensible\r\nand humorous, each availing himself of the same form of literature, each\r\nstanding apart from the windiness of such as George Borrow, are as alike\r\nin method as they are distinct in spirit. The form, the method indeed,\r\nare admirable for men of the type of these two who resemble one another\r\nso much in general cast, in line of action, though so very little in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIt is a form, as it were, made for a man of various tastes and talents,\r\nfor the progress of his journey makes a frame-work suggesting and\r\nholding together a multitude of discursions. An event of the day's march\r\ncan set him off on a train of entertaining or profitable reflection and\r\nMr. Belloc, in the earlier of the two books which are the subject of\r\nthis disquisition, will abruptly introduce an irrelevant story as he\r\nexplains, to while away the tedium of a dull road. And at the end of the\r\nirrelevance, the purpose of travel restores him to the path and\r\npreserves the unity of the book.\r\n\r\n_The Path to Rome_, though perhaps better known, is a younger and a less\r\nmature book than _The Four Men_. It is brilliantly full of humour and\r\npoetic description: it has even remarkable stretches of Fine Writing.\r\nOne could deduce from it without much difficulty the general trend of\r\nMr. Belloc's mind, for he has tumbled into it pell-mell all his first\r\nthoughts and reflections. With the fixed basis of thought, on which we\r\nhave already so often insisted, he will think at all times and on all\r\nthings in the same general way. This gives his observations a uniform\r\ncharacter and a uniform interest. The pleasure in reading a book of this\r\nsort is to see how his method of thinking will play upon the various\r\nhares of subjects that he starts.\r\n\r\nThis basis of thought in him is continuous: it has not changed, but it\r\nhas ripened, and it is more fully expressed. _The Path to Rome_ is the\r\nbook of a young man, vigorous, exuberant, extravagant, almost, as it\r\nwere, \"showing off.\" The flavour is sharp and arresting. _The Four Men_,\r\nwhich we believe to be the present climax of Mr. Belloc's literature,\r\nis, Heaven knows, vigorous, exuberant and extravagant enough. But it is\r\nalso graver, deeper, more artful, more coherent.\r\n\r\nIt is, in all its ramifications, a lyric, the expression of a single\r\nidea or emotion, and that the love of one's own country. The cult of\r\nSussex, as it has been harshly and awkwardly called, makes a sort of\r\nnucleus to Mr. Belloc's examination and impression of the world. If he\r\nknows Western Europe tolerably well, he knows this one county perfectly,\r\nand from it his explorations go out in concentric circles. He finds it,\r\nas he found with The Road, a solemn, a ritual, and a pleasurable task to\r\npraise his own home.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here analyse this book in any detail, nor would its framework\r\nbear so pedantic an insistence. The writer describes how, sitting in an\r\ninn just within the Kentish borders of Sussex he determined to walk\r\nacross the county, admiring it by the way, and so to find his own home.\r\nHe is joined on the road by three companions, Grizzlebeard, the Sailor,\r\nand the Poet. It would be stupid, the act of a Prussian professor, to\r\nseek for allegories in these figures, who are described and moulded with\r\na quite human humour. The supernatural touch given to them in the last\r\npages of the book, the faint mystic flavour which clings to them from\r\nthe beginning and marks them as being just more than companions of\r\nflesh, these things are indicated with so delicate a hand, so\r\nreticently, that to analyse the method would be destruction--for the\r\nwriters at least.\r\n\r\nThe book should be, by rights, described as \"an extraordinary medley.\"\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is not. Mr. Belloc gives it, as sub-title, the\r\ndescription \"A Farrago,\" but we are not very clear what that means. It\r\ncontains all manner of stuff from an excellent drinking song, an\r\nexcellent marching song (which has now seen service), and a first-rate\r\nsong about religion to the story of St. Dunstan and the Devil and an\r\naccount of Mr. Justice Honeybubbe's Decision. But all this is strung\r\ntogether with such a curious tact on the string of the journey across\r\nSussex that the miscellaneous materials make one coherent composition.\r\n\r\nThe recurrent landscapes which mark the progress of that journey are\r\nslight but exquisite. Take this one example, describing the gap of\r\nArundel, just below Amberley:\r\n\r\n     ... The rain began to fall again out of heaven, but we had come to\r\n     such a height of land that the rain and the veils of it did but add\r\n     to the beauty of all we saw, and the sky and the earth together\r\n     were not like November, but like April, and filled us with wonder.\r\n     At this place the flat water-meadows, the same that are flooded\r\n     and turned to a lake in mid-winter, stretch out a sort of scene or\r\n     stage, whereupon can be planted the grandeur of the Downs, and one\r\n     looks athwart that flat from a high place upon the shoulder of\r\n     Rockham Mount to the broken land, the sand hills, and the pines,\r\n     the ridge of Egdean side, the uplifted heaths and commons which\r\n     flank the last of the hills all the way until one comes to the\r\n     Hampshire border, beyond which there is nothing. This is the\r\n     foreground of the gap of Arundel, a district of the Downs so made\r\n     than when one sees it one knows at once that here is a jewel for\r\n     which the whole County of Sussex was made and the ornament worthy\r\n     of so rare a setting. And beyond Arun, straight over the flat,\r\n     where the line against the sky is highest, the hills I saw were the\r\n     hills of home.\r\n\r\nThese pages are full of sentences, graciously praising Sussex, in\r\nthemselves small and perfect poems, as for example the praises of Arun,\r\n\"which, when a man bathes in it, makes him forget everything that has\r\ncome upon him since his eighteenth year--or possibly his\r\ntwenty-seventh,\" and again, \"Arun in his majesty, married to salt water,\r\nand a king.\"\r\n\r\nWe should be doing an injustice to _The Four Men_ did we give the\r\nimpression that it is nothing but a graceful and pleasant poem written\r\nabout Sussex. We have said that it is grave and deep and informed with\r\nemotion. We will quote one passage, Grizzlebeard's farewell:\r\n\r\n     There is nothing at all that remains: nor any house; nor any\r\n     castle, however strong; nor any love, however tender and sound; nor\r\n     any comradeship among men, however hardy. Nothing remains but the\r\n     things of which I will not speak, because we have spoken enough of\r\n     them already during these four days. But I who am old will give you\r\n     advice, which is this--to consider chiefly from now onward those\r\n     permanent things which are, as it were, the shores of this age and\r\n     the harbours of our glittering and pleasant but dangerous and\r\n     wholly changeful sea.\r\n\r\nOf such stuff is the basis of this book: on this basis, which is poetic,\r\na spiritual motive, the whole creation is raised, and the book is\r\ndestined to be more than an occasional account of travel or an amusing\r\nbut trivial display of wit and fancy. It is a poem, and a poem, as we\r\nthink, which will endure.\r\n\r\nIt is, in truth, the poetic instinct which animates all his activities\r\nand particularly his travel. The poetic instinct consists of two itches,\r\nthe first to comprehend fully in all dimensions the reality which we see\r\nbefore us, the second to express it again in words, paint, clay or\r\nmusic. This instinct in its pure and proper form has regard to no kind\r\nof profit, either in money or esteem. It moves the poet to the doing of\r\nthese things for the sake only of doing them.\r\n\r\nBut by a very wise dispensation it is also the mainspring of all\r\nmaterial usefulness in the world. We have sought to show, in this\r\nchapter as in others, how you can find the poetic, the disinterested\r\nmotive, whenever you try to discover what gives their value to Mr.\r\nBelloc's studies in actuality. Particularly this is so in the\r\naccumulation of knowledge which he has acquired in his travels and in\r\nthe use he makes of it. It seems as though this passion to see and to\r\nunderstand must sharpen his wits and his vision: it gives that life and\r\nenergy to his writings on this matter without which poetic composition\r\nis worthless and journalism fails to convince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMR. BELLOC AND THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nYou cannot sum up Mr. Belloc in a phrase. It is the aim of the phrase to\r\nselect and emphasize; and if you attempt to select from Mr. Belloc's\r\nwork you are condemned to lose more than you gain. It is not possible to\r\nseize upon any one aspect of his work as expressive of the whole man: to\r\nappreciate him at all fully it is essential to take every department of\r\nhis writings into consideration.\r\n\r\nIf we are to answer the question as to what Mr. Belloc is, we can only\r\nreply with a string of names--poet and publicist, essayist and\r\neconomist, novelist and historian, satirist and traveller, a writer on\r\nmilitary affairs and a writer of children's verses.\r\n\r\nSuch overwhelming diversity is in itself sufficient to mark out a man\r\nfrom his fellows; but if this diversity is to have any lasting meaning,\r\nif it is to be for us something more than the versatility of a practised\r\njournalist, it must have a reason.\r\n\r\nThe various aspects of Mr. Belloc's work are interwoven and\r\ninterdependent. They do not spring one out of another, but all from one\r\ncentre. We cannot take one group of his writings as a starting-point,\r\nand trace the phases of a steady development. We can only compare the\r\nwhole of his work to a number of lines which are obviously converging.\r\nIf you take one of these lines, that is to say, one of his works or a\r\nsingle department of his activities, you cannot deduce from its\r\ndirection the central point of his mind and nature. But if you take all\r\nthese lines you may deduce, as it were mathematically, that they must of\r\nnecessity intersect at a certain hypothetical point. This point, then,\r\nis the centre of Mr. Belloc's mind, a centre which we know to exist, but\r\nat which we can only arrive by hypothesis, because he has not yet\r\nwritten any full expression of it.\r\n\r\nThis point, the centre of all Mr. Belloc's published work, is to be\r\nfound, we believe, in the fact that he is an historian. History to him\r\nis the greatest and most important of all studies. A knowledge of\r\nhistory is essential to an understanding of life. Although only a small\r\npart of his work is definitely historical in character, yet it is on\r\nhistory that the whole of his work reposes. This is very apparent when\r\nhe is dealing with economic or political problems of the present day: it\r\nis less marked, though still quite obvious, in his essays and books on\r\ntravel. It is in his poetry, and his children's verses that it appears\r\nperhaps least.\r\n\r\nBut it is the qualities which make him a poet and give him an\r\nunderstanding of children, his catholicity, and his desire for simple,\r\nprimitive and enduring things which give him that consistent view of\r\nhistory which we believe him to hold, and which we have attempted to\r\noutline in the eighth and again in the tenth chapters of this book. We\r\nendeavoured there to make clear what we believe to be Mr. Belloc's view\r\nof the general course of European history, and, as we pointed out, we\r\nfound considerable difficulty in the fact that Mr. Belloc has never\r\nwritten any connected exposition of this view. We were, indeed, deducing\r\nthe existence of a centre from the evidence of the converging lines.\r\n\r\nThat such a centre exists in Mr. Belloc's mind we have no doubt\r\nwhatever. It is perfectly plain that he relates to some such considered\r\nand consistent scheme of history any particular historical event or\r\ncontemporary problem which is brought under his notice. If at some\r\nfuture date he should set out this scheme as fully and adequately as we\r\nthink it deserves, the resulting work would be of paramount value, both\r\nas an historical treatise, and as a guide to the understanding of all\r\nMr. Belloc's other activities.\r\n\r\nWhat we believe Mr. Belloc's view of the mainspring and the course of\r\nhistory to be we have outlined sufficiently, at least for the present\r\npurpose. The reader is already familiar with his conception of the\r\nEuropean race, of the political greatness of Rome, of the importance of\r\nthe Middle Ages, and of the principles of the French Revolution. But\r\nbehind this material appearance, dictating its form and inspiring its\r\nexpression, there is something else--the point of character from which\r\nhe judges and co-relates in his mind, not only transitory, but also\r\neternal things.\r\n\r\nWe might baldly express this point by saying that it is in the nature of\r\na reverence for tradition and authority: but such phrases are nets\r\nwhich, while they do indeed capture the main tendency of ideas, allow\r\nto escape the subtle reservations and qualifications wherein the life of\r\nideas truly resides. On such a point we can at best generalize: and this\r\ngeneralization will most easily be made clear, perhaps, by a contrast.\r\n\r\nThe point from which Mr. Belloc views the whole of life, the point about\r\nhim which it is of cardinal importance to seize, is the point where he\r\ncuts across the stream of contemporary thought. All literature and all\r\nart is conditioned by the social influences of the time. Mr. Belloc has\r\ntold us that the state of society which exists in England to-day, and\r\nwhich he regards as rapidly nearing its close, is necessarily unstable,\r\nand more properly to be regarded as a transitory phase lying between two\r\nstable states of society. If we examine in its broadest outline the\r\nliterature which is contemporaneous with the general consolidation of\r\ncapitalism we find that it bears stamped upon it the mark of\r\ninterrogation. From Wilde to Mr. Wells is the age of the question mark.\r\nIn almost every writer of this period we find the same tendency of\r\nthought: the endless questioning, the shattering of conventions, the\r\nrepeal of tradition, the denial of dogma.\r\n\r\nIt is the literature of an age of discomfort. Mr. Wells does not so much\r\ndenounce as complain; life appears to ruin Mr. Galsworthy's digestion.\r\nMr. Masefield, that robust and versifying sailor, is as irritable as a\r\nman with a bad cold. Our poets and our thinkers do not view the world\r\nwith a settled gaze either of appreciation or of contempt: they look at\r\nit with the wild eye of a man who cannot imagine where he has put his\r\ngloves. Their condemnations and suggestions are alike undignified,\r\nwhirling and flimsy. They pick up and throw down in the same space of\r\ntime every human institution: they are in a hurry to question everything\r\nand they have not the patience to wait for an answer to anything.\r\n\r\nWe would not appear to think lightly of our contemporaries. It was\r\nnecessary that they should arise to cleanse and garnish the world. They\r\nare symptomatic of an age, an evil age that is passing. They have\r\ncleared the ground for other men to build. If the world is not fuller\r\nand richer for their work, it is at any rate cleaner and healthier.\r\n\r\nThat their work is done, that the time is ripe for more solid things,\r\ngrows clearer every day. We are weary of our voyage of discovery and\r\nwishful to arrive at the promised land. We are glutted with questions,\r\nbut hungry for answers. Theories are no longer our need; our desire is\r\nfor fact. The philosophy and art of to-day exhibit this tendency. In\r\nliterature especially the naturalist method has seen its day: and a\r\ngeneral return to the romantic, or better, the classical form, is\r\nimminent. In a word, the tendency to establish as opposed to the\r\ntendency to demolish is everywhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nBy the very nature of his first principles Mr. Belloc is as much an ally\r\nof this tendency as he is an enemy of the tendency which is now reaching\r\nits term. His simplicity and catholicity give him a solid hold on\r\ntradition, and he will attack, on _a priori_ grounds, nothing that is\r\nalready established in the tradition of man. He is by no means a friend\r\nof reaction; but he can see nothing but peril and foolishness in Mr.\r\nWells' attempts to construct a new universe out of chaos between two\r\nnumbers of a half-crown review. Being, as he is, mystically impressed\r\nwith the transitoriness of individual man and the permanence of the\r\nhuman race, he will not lightly condemn anything that has appeared\r\nuseful to many past generations, and he cannot accept the mere charge of\r\nage as a damaging indictment against any human institution.\r\n\r\nIt is not Mr. Belloc's aim to drive us towards \"a world set free.\" He\r\ndoes not visualize an ideal state which he would have the world attain.\r\nHis whole object is to solve our immediate problems, practically and\r\nusefully, as they may best be solved; that is, by applying to the\r\npresent the teachings of the past. He leaves himself open to the\r\ninfluences of his time: he does not attempt to force the men of his day\r\ninto a mould of his own creation. For example, he points to the\r\ndistributive state as the happiest political condition to be found in\r\nthe Christian era. He sees no safe solution of present problems which\r\ndoes not involve a return to that state. But he does not indulge in the\r\nfoolish exercise of elaborating a ready-made scheme by which the\r\ndistributive state may be reinstituted. He is too much of an historian,\r\ntoo practical a reformer, to be a lover of fantasy.\r\n\r\nIn _Danton_, Mr. Belloc says:\r\n\r\n     A man who is destined to represent at any moment the chief energies\r\n     of a nation, especially a man who will not only represent but lead,\r\n     must, by his nature, follow the national methods on his road to\r\n     power.\r\n\r\n     His career must be nearly parallel (so to speak) with the direction\r\n     of the national energies, and must merge with their main current at\r\n     an imperceptible angle. It is the chief error of those who\r\n     deliberately plan success that they will not leave themselves\r\n     amenable to such influences, and it is the most frequent cause of\r\n     their failure. Thus such men as arrive at great heights of power\r\n     are most often observed to succeed by a kind of fatality, which is\r\n     nothing more than the course of natures vigorous and original, but,\r\n     at the same time, yielding unconsciously to an environment with\r\n     which they sympathize, or to which they were born.\r\n\r\nWe believe that society to-day is searching for a fixed morality and a\r\ndogmatic religion. We are seeking to establish once more conventions of\r\nconduct by which we may be ruled: our anxiety is to submit to the\r\nauthority of eternal truths.\r\n\r\nIt is on tradition and authority that the whole of Mr. Belloc's work is\r\nbased. He stands already on the heights society is striving to reach.\r\nThat his influence on the progress of society towards its goal will be\r\nconsiderable we may fairly believe; the exact measure of that influence\r\nonly the future can determine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     Printed in Great Britain\r\n                 by Butler & Tanner, Frome and London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to the text:\r\n\r\nPage 6: \"blinds all of them\" changed to \"binds all of them\".\r\n\r\nPage 13: \"leisurely obligarchy\" changed to leisurely oligarchy\".\r\n\r\nPage 20: \"crown and best achievment\" changed to \"crown and best\r\nachievement\".\r\n\r\nPage 56: \"perusual of the daily newspaper\" changed to \"perusal of the\r\ndaily newspaper\".\r\n\r\nPage 88 (in this version of the text): In footnote #1 \"Mommesn's volume\r\non the provinces\" changed to \"Mommsen's volume on the provinces\".\r\n\r\nPage 119: \"freeest humour\" changed to \"freest humour\".\r\n\r\nPage 119: \"What did he manufactare\" changed to \"What did he\r\nmanufacture\".\r\n\r\n\"Page 129: \"liqueurs in caf!e\" changed to \"liqueurs in the cafe!.\"",
