After enduring the tortures of poor Goldsmith (as\r\nteacher, traveler, editor, and author) for fifteen years, he takes the\r\nbasement of the crumbling ruin at No. 20 Wall street, and advertises\r\nfor a boy, when John Kelly (now a Member of Congress from the Fourth,\r\nSixth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Wards) thus responds:\r\n\r\n_Enter John Kelly in rags and barefooted._\r\n\r\n_John_—Mr. Bennett: Mother says you advertised for a boy, and sent me\r\nto ask you for the situation.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—What’s your name?\r\n\r\n_John_—Johnny Kelly.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Where do you live?\r\n\r\n_John_—In the Fourteenth Ward.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—How long have you been in this country?\r\n\r\n_John_—I have always been in this beautiful country.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Aint you an Irish boy?\r\n\r\n_John_—No, sir,—I am an American boy, and I’m very glad I am an\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Why are you glad of that?\r\n\r\n_John_—Because George Washington was an American, and I dearly love\r\nhis memory, because he always spoke the truth, and was good and brave,\r\nand loved and saved his country.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Who told you all this?\r\n\r\n_John_—My grandfather first told me of Washington’s greatness, and\r\ngoodness, and bravery, and since he died, I have read the Life of\r\nWashington several times.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Where was your grandfather born?\r\n\r\n_John_—In Scotland.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Ah! then, you are of Scotch descent?\r\n\r\n_John_—Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Did you ever hear of Wallace?\r\n\r\n_John_—Yes, sir, and of William Tell, and his son Albert, of\r\nSwitzerland. Grandfather told me all about their courageous deeds and\r\ngreat love of country.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Where were your parents born?\r\n\r\n_John_—In poor old Ireland.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Why did they leave their country?\r\n\r\n_John_—Because liberty was dead, and the people starving, and sorely\r\noppressed by tyrants.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Who crushed the liberty of Ireland?\r\n\r\n_John_—England, Scotland, and Wales.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—That will do, my boy, and I am pleased with your\r\nintelligence and love of liberty, though you should not denounce the\r\nglorious Scotland, because your grandfather came from its pretty vales\r\nand majestic mountains.\r\n\r\n_John_—If Scotland and Wales had sympathised with Ireland, and fought\r\nher battles for freedom, the sweetest and greenest Isle of all the\r\nearth would now be free like my dear America, and Scotland and Wales\r\ncould also have enjoyed the blessings of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enter Washer Woman._\r\n\r\n_Washer Woman_—And so I have caught the old Scotch Serpent at last,\r\neh? I have been here a dozen times, and also at your last boarding\r\nhouse, which you left without paying a poor widow (with five young\r\nchildren) for your board, and she is very sick in consequence of your\r\ncowardly villainy, and is about to have another child, and her landlord\r\ntold her yesterday that she must move immediately, or he would turn her\r\ninto the street, for not paying her rent. But I’ll stand none of your\r\nwickedness. And now, Bennett, if you don’t instantly pay me for washing\r\nand mending your filthy and ragged clothes, I will rope you on the\r\nspot. (She takes a rope from behind her apron.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Call in the morning, and I will certainly pay you.\r\n\r\n_Washer Woman_—I shall do no such thing, you lying diddler. I will\r\nhave it now, or I will rope you, and pull your hair, and scratch and\r\nbite, and maul you to a jelly. (She approaches him with menacing\r\ngestures.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—There, good woman,—there’s your money. (She seizes it and\r\ndeparts, wagging her head and body with victorious vociferations.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—There, Master Kelly, you perceive that I am very poor.\r\n\r\n_John_—Yes, sir, and so am I, and I like to be with the poor, because\r\nthey are far more kind and generous than the rich.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (wiping a tear from his eye)—My boy, I can see a noble heart\r\nin your breast, and you remind me of the happy friends I left in my\r\nnative land, whom I may never see again, and who are ignorant of the\r\nterrible vicissitudes through which I have passed, since I left my dear\r\nfather’s roof.\r\n\r\n_John_—What country is yours?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Scotland.\r\n\r\n_John_—Ah! Scotland! My adored grandfather’s native home! O, I love\r\nyou much better, now that I learn you came from Scotland.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—No more of this, dear boy. I cannot talk of my present\r\npoverty, and of my native skies, without sad emotions. And now to\r\nbusiness. Can you write a handsome hand?\r\n\r\n_John_—I can write a plain hand.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Can you spell well?\r\n\r\n_John_—Tolerably well, for a poor boy.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Do you understand figures?\r\n\r\n_John_—Better than spelling or writing.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—How much do you want a week?\r\n\r\n_John_—Enough to buy shoes and jacket and trowsers, and pay my father\r\nand mother something for my food and lodging.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Well, if you prove active, and answer my purpose, I will\r\nreward you according to my success in my new enterprise.\r\n\r\n_John_—When do you want me to come?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—You may stay now, and, after sweeping out the office, and\r\nfolding that pile of papers in the corner, which I could not sell\r\nyesterday, you can accompany me to my Printers, Anderson & Ward, in Ann\r\nstreet, for the _Herald_ papers of to-day. (John sprinkles and sweeps\r\nout, and folds the papers in half an hour, and he and Bennett start for\r\nAnn street.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (at his printer’s in Ann street)—Mr. Anderson, are my papers\r\nready?\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—Yes, but you can’t have them until you pay me for them.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I have not got enough.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—Then you can’t have them.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—But the newsboys are outside, waiting for them.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—I can’t help that.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—But, my dear sir, do let me have them.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—I shan’t do it.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Will you take my watch?\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—I have taken that twenty times, and, as I am not a\r\npawnbroker, I am sick of taking your watch as security for the results\r\nof my honest labor.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Do take it once more.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—I told you, when you last redeemed it, that I should not\r\ntake it again.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (crying)—Do take it once more, Mr. Anderson.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—No, sir. Here, Rufus, put these Heralds in a box, and nail\r\nit, and take the box to my house.\r\n\r\n_John_—Do take his watch once more, kind sir. Mr. Bennett has just\r\nemployed me, and I’m not afraid to trust him. Besides, just look at\r\nhis tears. See how big they are, and how fast they flow and roll down\r\nhis manly cheeks. Do, sir, O do let him have the papers, and spare his\r\ntears, and heal his broken heart.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_ (looking over his spectacles)—Who the devil are you?\r\n\r\n_John_—I am Johnny Kelly.\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—What! Does your father live in the Fourteenth Ward?\r\n\r\n_John_—Yes, sir, and that’s just where I was born, and have always\r\nlived, and always mean to, and die there also, and, if possible, I\r\nintend to be buried there, in some beautiful cemetery, because I most\r\nfondly love the good and generous people of the Fourteenth Ward. And\r\nnow, Mr. Anderson, have I not often seen you at my father’s, on winter\r\nevenings, telling each other funny and pleasing stories of the past?\r\n\r\n_Anderson_—Seen me at your father’s, you young rogue? Why, to be sure\r\nyou have. I came to America with your father and mother, and my wife\r\nwas present when you were born in Mott street, and after your mother\r\ngot well, we had a great frolic at your Christening, and went to the\r\nPark Theatre, and you were the fattest and prettiest baby I ever saw.\r\n\r\n_John_—You don’t say so? Give me your hand—\r\n\r\n_Anderson_ (jumping over the counter)—and a kiss, too, you rosy little\r\nrascal. (Kisses him, and then turns to Bennett.) There, Bennett, take\r\nyour papers, and give me your old dumb silver turnip once more, but\r\nI’ll be hanged before I will ever take it again. And you may attribute\r\nyour good luck this time to this bright and pretty and honest little\r\nboy, whom I have loved since his infancy. (Bennett and John take the\r\npapers, and let the boys outside have some, and then depart for No. 20\r\nWall street.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_ (on his way to Wall street)—Well, my lad, you have saved me\r\nto-day, and I’ll remember it with gratitude as long as I live. Tell\r\nyour father and mother that I will come and see them on Sunday evening,\r\nand take tea with them. You can tell them that I will let you have\r\nmoney enough on Saturday night to get you a pair of shoes, as it won’t\r\ndo for you to be my clerk with naked feet. Besides, I’m afraid you will\r\nget nails or splinters in your bare feet, and have the lock jaw. So,\r\nJohn, you had better ask your father to let you wear his shoes until\r\nSaturday.\r\n\r\n_John_—Daddy hasn’t got any shoes. He has been sick a long time with\r\ninflammatory rheumatism, and he can’t work any more, and he is obliged\r\nto go barefooted like myself.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Good Lord! Then ask your mother to let you wear her shoes\r\nuntil Saturday.\r\n\r\n_John_—Mother aint got but one pair, and they are slippers, and nearly\r\nworn out.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Well, then, I must try to get you some second-hand shoes in\r\nthe morning. I have only one pair myself, but I think I can borrow some\r\nthat are considerably worn from one of my room-mates. So, good day,\r\nJohnny, and come down early in the morning, and I guess I’ll have some\r\nprotection for your tender feet.\r\n\r\n_John_—Good day, sir, and I hope you will not cry any more until I see\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—I thank you, my dear boy, for your genial sympathy, and I\r\nwill strive not to cry again until I see you. So, good by.\r\n\r\n_John_—Good by, sir. (They separate.)\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncomparable Meanness.\r\n\r\n\r\nI taught Richard T. Compton grammar and composition, while he was\r\nPresident of the Board of Aldermen, at his residence, for which he\r\nnever fully paid me. I also went nearly two years to Ambrose C.\r\nKingsland’s princely residence in Fifth Avenue, for the purpose of his\r\neducation in spelling, grammar, and composition, and he has never paid\r\nme. Dick Compton’s Bill is small compared with Kingsland’s, who owes me\r\na large sum. President Compton and Ex-Mayor Kingsland were the most\r\ncorrupt men ever in the City Hall. I have asserted, and still assert,\r\nand intend to assert, to the very last hour of my existence, that one\r\nof my Aldermanic pupils of the scabby Common Councils of 1851 and 1852,\r\nassured me that Ex-Mayor Kingsland made more money while Mayor in\r\n1851 and 1852, than all the Mayors who preceded him, and that he (my\r\nAldermanic pupil) was an eye witness to many of Kingsland’s plundering\r\noperations. So, Compton and Kingsland, just put all this in your\r\npipes and smoke it, and now, if you attempt to violate my person (for\r\npublishing what I and you know to be true, and what I yearn to prove\r\nin the Courts,) you can come on as soon as you please, and if I don’t\r\ntumble your thievish carcases into the liquid fires of hell, I shall\r\nprove an unworthy advocate of the millions you have robbed and tried\r\nto starve, and of the land of Greene and Perry from which I proudly\r\nhail. I dunned Kingsland a long time for my just dues, and wearied and\r\nshocked with his meanness, I sent him a letter long since, presenting\r\nhim with my entire claim for learning him to spell the simplest words.\r\nAnd if he will publish my letter, I will give him a clock, gilded with\r\ngold and silver, as an ornament to the Chief parlor of his gorgeous\r\nmansion, which he stole from the poor creatures who crawl in nakedness\r\nto the corner groceries for food to keep them from the grave. I\r\nrecently asked Compton for an advertisement for the _Alligator_, in\r\norder to indirectly get the money he owes me for instruction, but he\r\neven declined the advertisement. And now I publicly give him the entire\r\nbalance of my claim against him for instruction, while he was President\r\nof the Board of Aldermen. Compton was as corrupt when he was in the\r\nCommon Council in 1845 and 1846, as he was in 1852 and 1853. His Ice\r\nPartner, Joseph Britton, was Assistant Alderman of the Fifteenth Ward\r\nin 1848, and Alderman in 1849, 1850, and 1851, and (as Chairman of the\r\nFinance Committee, in connection with James M. Bard,) he did not steal\r\nover $200,000. It is most time for Compton and Britton to return to the\r\nCommon Council, and make fresh grabs at the pockets and throats of the\r\npeople, who should seize such villains and hang them in the Park, and\r\nthrust their worthless bones into a felon’s grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, JUNE 19, 1858.\r\n\r\n STEPHEN H. BRANCH’S “ALLIGATOR” CAN BE obtained at all hours, (day\r\n or night,) at wholesale and retail, at No. 128 Nassau Street, Near\r\n Beekman Street, and opposite Ross & Tousey’s News Depot, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpectres and Hobgoblins.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor _Helen Jewett’s_ ghost appeared to James Gordon Bennett last\r\nnight, and he leaped from his bed, (_a la_ Richard from his tent,) and\r\nsweat terribly, and his jaws clattered, and his frame trembled, and he\r\nscreamed for Grinnell and others to come to his relief. But they could\r\nnot respond, because they were long since bled to death in the rear\r\nof the City Hospital, and are at the High Court of God, awaiting the\r\nspeedy arrival of Bennett’s soul, which they will convict of crimes\r\nthat will consign his wicked spirit to wasteless fires!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James Gordon Bennett and Frederic Hudson, his Cunning Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many members of your families and _Herald_ spies are quartered\r\nin the Departments of our Municipal Government? in the Post Office?\r\nin the Custom House? in the Departments at Washington? I am\r\nanxious to know, and, if you don’t soon publish the interminable\r\nlist, I will. Is Robert, your former book-keeper, and other family\r\nrelatives, still in the Custom House, and other public stations,\r\nand to keep them there, do you jump Jim Crow from Fremont to\r\nBuchanan, and defend the everlasting Wetmore robbers, and the\r\nbrothers Schell, and other public plunderers? You know you do, you\r\ndouble-dyed villains. And you know that I know that Bennett and\r\nFred and Ned Hudson, and black-mail-bottle-holder-Galbraith, and\r\n“Obscene-publication”-”British-alien”-”thirty-days-in-the-Tombs”-”Drury”\r\n-”go-between”-Fire Marshal Baker, are an irredeemable band of\r\nconsummate scamps. I mean to strip, and lash, and brand yourselves and\r\nwhole tribe of vultures, so that you cannot longer deceive the people.\r\nSo, prepare, ye two-faced, nauseous, scabby, leprous, and hellish gang\r\nof thieves, for a dissection that will enlarge the eyes of honest men,\r\nand make them stare like affrighted owls. You have quoted Scripture\r\nlong enough, and I intend that you shall hereafter quote from your\r\nfriend the Devil, and cease your hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Way New York is Bamboozled.\r\n\r\n “_First Annual Report of the American and Foreign Emigrant Protective\r\n and Employment Society_,” of which _Peter Cooper_ is President, and\r\n _Horace Greeley_ and _Solon Robinson_ are Directors.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL STATEMENT.\r\n\r\n_Receipts to date, from all sources—April 30, 1855._\r\n\r\n  By cash received in donations,\r\n    subscriptions, fees, &c.,                 $7,822 67\r\n                                              —————————\r\n                                              $7,822 67\r\n\r\n_Payments to Date—April 30, 1855._\r\n\r\n  Cash paid for repairs and offices             $350 38\r\n         ”      furniture and office\r\n                  fittings,                      444 50\r\n         ”      rents, firing, &c.,            1,113 92\r\n         ”      salaries,                      3,663 20\r\n         ”      petty disbursements,             310 07\r\n         ”      advertisements,                  356 73\r\n         ”      books, stationery and\r\n                  printing,                      525 75\r\n         ”      licenses,                         50 00\r\n         ”      _transportation of emigrants_,   482 33\r\n  Balance of cash on band,                       525 79\r\n                                              —————————\r\n                                              $7,822 67\r\n\r\nWe do hereby certify that we have examined the books of account of the\r\nAmerican and Foreign Emigrant Protective and Employment Society, and\r\naudited the above account, and find the same correct.\r\n\r\n  JASPER E.

This is the boldest robbery of a\r\nCharitable Society on record, though the following is close at its\r\nheels:\r\n\r\n_Official Statement_ of the _Hunter Woodis Academy of Music Calico\r\nBall_.\r\n\r\n  Receipts, (rogues’ exhibit,)                $9,202 30\r\n  Expenses, (rogues’ exhibit,)                4,288 72\r\n                                              —————————\r\n  Balance disbursed for _John Hecker’s_\r\n    Bread, with a very small balance\r\n    still in the hands of rogues              4,913 58\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper was also President of this Ball, and Mayor Tiemann and\r\nJames W.

The _Hunter Woodis Society_ Managers\r\ntold me on Monday last, that the receipts of the Crystal Palace Ball\r\nwere §10,147,38, and that the expenses were $6,828,03, leaving a\r\nbalance in the hands of their Treasurer of $3,319,35, which is now\r\nin their Safe, and that they have not disbursed one cent for bread\r\nnor any thing else for the relief of the poor, and do not intend to,\r\nuntil the next winter. I had a long interview with the officers of the\r\nself-constituted _Hunter Woodis Society_, (at their official quarters,)\r\nwho are remarkably well clad, and smelt very strongly of cologne and\r\npomatum, and they seemed extremely happy in their gaudy easy chairs,\r\nand I learn that they can often be seen on the fashionable avenues with\r\nfast steeds, and at the Italian Opera, and the aristocratic clubs. One\r\nof the leaders of the _Hunter Woodis Society_ (doubtless fearing that\r\nI was about to let loose my _Alligator_ upon himself and associates,)\r\nbreathed honied words during my visit to the Society, and boldly said\r\nthat Peter Cooper was anything but an honest man, but that the _Hunter\r\nWoodis_ Managers were all honorable men, and that all the members of\r\nthe _Hunter Woodis Society_ were Know Nothings. He told me this three\r\ntimes, lest I should forget it, the fool supposing that I regarded Know\r\nNothing thieves with less abhorrence than Irish or British thieves, of\r\nthe Busteed, Connolly, or Matsell brand. I believe that most of the\r\ncharitable funds of the “American and Foreign Emigrant Protective and\r\nEmployment Society,” and of the “Academy of Music and Crystal Palace\r\nBalls,” have gone into the pockets and bellies and bladders of the\r\nscoundrels who collected those sacred funds for the immediate relief of\r\nthe Emigrants and Starving Poor of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStartling Revelations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my coming revelations of Bennett and Hudson’s rascalities, I shall\r\nprove that the former strove to black mail me during my protracted\r\nMnemonic Controversy with Professor Francis Fauvel Gourard in 1843, for\r\nwhich I drew a revolver on _Satan_ in the _Herald_ office. I shall also\r\nprove that I got Bennett the Corporation Printing at $3,000 per annum,\r\nthrough my influence with my Aldermanic pupils,—that I wrote the\r\nPrinting Report, proposing to give Bennett $3,000 a year for the Common\r\nCouncil Printing, and the other Journals only $1,000 a year,—that I\r\ntold Bennett I was teaching the Aldermen, and, among them, Alderman A.\r\nA. Denman, of the Sixteenth Ward, who was Chairman of the Committee\r\nto whom the Corporation Printing was referred,—that I bet Bennett\r\n$100 that I would get the Corporation Printing for the _Herald_ at\r\n$3,000 per annum,—that I not only wrote the Printing Report for the\r\nCommittee, but got it adopted by both Boards of the Common Council,\r\nand got the Mayor to sign it, when Bennett gave me the $100, which was\r\na part of the $250 that I have only received from Bennett during my\r\nvoluntary connection with the _Herald_ since 1836,—that after I got\r\nthe Corporation Printing for Bennett, I continued to scourge the Common\r\nCouncil through the Fire Reports of Alfred Carson, and a Caucus was\r\nheld, and a vote passed, demanding me to cease my philippics against\r\nthe Common Council, because they had given Bennett the Corporation\r\nPrinting at my request,—that I told the Alderman who was delegated\r\nby the Aldermanic Caucus to request me to cease my philippics, that I\r\nshould not comply with their monstrous demand, and that I would see\r\nBennett and Hudson and the _Herald_ effaced from the earth, before\r\nI would desert Alfred Carson and his noble band of firemen,—that\r\nthis Alderman then went to Bennett, (by direction of the Caucus,) and\r\nrequested him not to publish my Fire philippics against the Common\r\nCouncil, and Bennett, (fearing they would deprive him of the Printing\r\nif he refused,) cowardly and mercenarily complied, and also pledged\r\nhimself to conceal the anticipated robberies of 1852 and 1853,—that\r\nthe Common Council was so pleased with Bennett’s course, that they\r\nmade him overtures, through which he acquired a princely fortune,\r\nas he did under Fernando Wood’s administration,—that one of the\r\nmembers of the Committee, who reported in favor of Bennett’s Printing,\r\n(who was my pupil,) received by a vote of the Common Council, 204\r\nvaluable lots on the banks of the East River, which he holds to this\r\nday,—that this corrupt Alderman boldly besought me, at his house at\r\nmidnight, to abandon Alfred Carson, and go into the embraces of the\r\nCommon Council, which would ensure me a splendid fortune,—that I\r\nnearly smote him on the spot with my maledictions and my indignant\r\nglances,—that this Alderman was a bosom friend and confidant of the\r\nthen Aldermen Tiemann and Peter Cooper,—that he is the sacred friend\r\nof Mayor Tiemann and Peter Cooper now,—that Mayor Tiemann and Peter\r\nCooper fear this Alderman, who has known them and all their political\r\nvillainy since 1828,—that this is the Alderman who first told me\r\nof Mayor Tiemann’s and Peter Cooper’s public robberies,—that Mayor\r\nTiemann was an Alderman of the Common Council that gave Bennett the\r\nCorporation Printing, and voted for it,—that this Alderman introduced\r\nme to Alderman Tiemann on the very day that Tiemann originated the\r\nWard Island Purchases, which have been and are the foulest sources of\r\ncorruption and plunder in the annals of municipal legislation,—that\r\nTiemann and this Alderman acted in concert in the Ward Island\r\nPurchases, and he assured me at the time that Tiemann was the slyest\r\nand most pliable member of the Board of Aldermen, when there was an\r\nenormous sum to be made at one grab, but that Tiemann would not peril\r\nhis reputation by embarking in small plundering operations—that Gov.\r\nWm. T. Pinkney recently told me in the rear of his Insurance Office in\r\nWall street, that this was precisely Tiemann’s course while a member\r\nof the Board of Ten Governors, who never could be drawn into small\r\noperations. I will also prove that Bennett has always been a Secret\r\nCorporation Plunderer, and also a State and National Thief,—that his\r\nunceasing denunciation of the Common Council, and the Legislature,\r\nand Congress, is only to blind the people, and enable him to steal\r\nthe more,—that Frederick Hudson, his Secretary, while Bennett was in\r\nEurope, got $30,000 from the Common Council, for suppressing one of\r\nAlfred Carson’s terrible philippics against the Corporation, at the\r\nelection of all the Assistant Engineers of the Fire Department,—that\r\none of my Aldermanic pupils assured me that §30,000 was the sum that\r\nHudson received, and which I publicly nailed on the brow of Hudson at\r\nthe time, in the _New York Sun_, and other Journals, including the\r\n_Firemen’s Journal_. These are only some of the numerous villanies I\r\nshall prove against these scoundrels. I will also show that Bennett and\r\nFred and Ned Hudson conceived the Parker Vein and Potosi Swindles,\r\nthrough which thousands were ruined, including widows and orphans,\r\nand my brother William and his wife and interesting children, who\r\nwere reduced from affluence and happiness, to utter destitution. Poor\r\nbrother William is now a skeleton and shadow and wanderer in the\r\nstreets of Saint Louis, and forever separated from his wife and adored\r\noffspring, through the heartless mercenary machinations and deviltry\r\nof Bennett and the Hudsons of the _Herald_. When the details of these\r\nRevelations are spread before the world, the question will be forever\r\nsettled as to the overshadowing Black Mail Operations of the _New York\r\nHerald_.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n\r\n                          STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n\r\n In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United States for\r\n                  the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Louisville I went to Wheeling, and thence to Baltimore, where I\r\nvisited a noble youth who had been my classmate, and during my illness\r\nat Columbian College, he was ever by my side, when young White was\r\nabsent. He was now an invalid, and about to leave for the Mediterranean\r\nin a clipper vessel, owned by his father, and strongly urged me to\r\naccompany him without charge. In about a week we left Baltimore for\r\nGibraltar, with the captain, first and second mate, and a choice crew.\r\nWe had but one gale in the Atlantic, and, after a brief sojourn at\r\nGibraltar, we passed on, touching at various ports, until we reached\r\nAlexandria. We visited the Pyramids, and passed a moonlight evening\r\non the Nile, and went to Damascus, Jerusalem, Constantinople, Athens,\r\nand Rome, where we sailed on the Tiber, and reveled on the soil of\r\nthe departed Romans. We left for Baltimore, and had terrific gales\r\nin the Mediterranean, and in the Atlantic. About ten days before our\r\narrival in Baltimore, my friend died, which shook me to the soul with\r\ngrief. On our arrival at Baltimore, his father and mother and sisters\r\nkissed the dust in agony, and treated me like a son or brother. The\r\nfather gave me $100, and I departed for New York, in deep affliction\r\nat my irreparable loss of a generous youth who had been so kind to\r\nme. I became ill, and nearly died, and exhausted the $100, and wrote\r\nto father, who sent me money, and I recovered after a severe struggle\r\nwith the arrows of death. I again saw Lewis Tappan, and began to teach\r\ncolored persons, for which I received a miserable pittance. I now\r\nobtained board in Beekman street, with Mrs. Tripler, some of whose\r\nboarders were named Thompson, Woodbury, Chapman, and Cuniffe. A Mr.\r\nBliss boarded there, who had been an eminent bookseller, and an early\r\nfriend to William Cullen Bryant, and, as he was now very poor, Mr.\r\nBryant obtained a situation for him in the Custom House. Mr. Bryant\r\noften came to Mrs. Tripler’s to see Mr. Bliss, and they weekly dined\r\nat the Spanish Hotel, in Fulton street. It was a pleasing and noble\r\nspectacle to behold Mr. Bryant’s fidelity to Mr. Bliss in his penury\r\nand old age. Henry J. Raymond (now editor of the _New York Times_) was\r\nin the employ of Horace Greeley, at $4 a week, with a promise of more,\r\nif he _proved true_ to Greeley, and became an expert paragraphist.\r\nRaymond roomed and slept with my brother Thomas, at a boarding house\r\nin Beekman street, near mine, and they each paid $1 75 a week, for\r\nboard and lodging, exclusive of washing, ironing, and mending. Their\r\nroom was next to the roof, and their only window was the sky light.\r\nThere was a large pillar in the centre of their funny little extra\r\nattic cubby-hole, which had recently been placed there, to prevent\r\nthe dilapidated and shrunken and sunken roof from utterly caving in,\r\nand burying the entire inhabitants of the superannuated edifice,\r\nincluding the Lieutenant Governor in embryo of the Empire State. A man\r\nninety-four years old lived over the way, who told me that he was born\r\nin the venerable building in question, and that his aged aunt often\r\ntold him that she was born there, and that the building could not be\r\nless than one hundred and seventy years old. I closely examined the\r\nbeams and chimneys, and formed the opinion that it had seen not less\r\nthan two hundred winters, including summer tornadoes. I often visited\r\nbrother Thomas, and always dreaded climbing the ladder that led to his\r\nand Raymond’s apartment. And when I entered their comic room, I had\r\nto take off my hat, and squat down, and often when I arose to depart,\r\nI bumped my head severely against the pigeon-house ceiling. But Tommy\r\nand the proud Governor and Editor in the invisible future were very\r\nshort, and could walk erect as turkeys without bumping their heads, and\r\nthey really seemed to enjoy their little oven amazingly. They had but\r\none squeaking cot, (that Parson Brown, their host, bought at auction,)\r\nand only one stool, and a pine table with only three legs. The fourth\r\nleg was Raymond’s cane, which he placed under the table when he wrote\r\nhis $4 a week articles for Greeley’s _Tribune_. And it was a funny\r\nspectacle for me to see Raymond seated on the stool, beside the three\r\nlegged pine table, (with his hair shaved to the skull.) writing for his\r\nlife, with Tom on the squealing cot, waiting for Raymond to close his\r\nlast paragraph, so that he (Tom) could have a chance to write a letter\r\nin answer to an Advertiser in the _New York Sun_ for a clerk. They had\r\nno wash bowl, nor pitcher, nor comb, nor looking glass, and washed\r\ntheir hands and face in the yard with cistern water. I bought a pocket\r\ncomb for Tommy, which he often loaned to Raymond, and finally sold it\r\nto him for a free ticket to a concert, which Greeley gave Raymond. I\r\nat last obtained a situation for Tommy, and about daylight rushed into\r\nhis boarding house, (the door was always open all night,) and up I flew\r\nthe last flight of stairs and precarious ladder, and popped into their\r\ncosy room, and there they lay, reposing and dreaming of the past, and\r\nof better days in perspective. Tommy was on his side, and his face\r\nwas partially eclipsed with his sheet, but Raymond was flat on his\r\nback, and he had a tooth-ache poultice on his cheek, covered with his\r\nhandkerchief, which encircled his head around his ears, and he looked\r\npale, and plaintive, and care worn, and I pitied him. I softly thrust\r\nmy hand into the clothes, in pursuit of Tom’s feet, which I began to\r\ntickle, when Tom (who was always as nervous and ticklish as a very\r\nsusceptible girl) suddenly popped over on the other side, and gave\r\nRaymond’s poultice n bang, when the latter gave a growl, and popped\r\nover on his other side, and, in doing so, dislocated his poultice,\r\nwhich came out in great profusion, and run all over his face and down\r\ninto his neck, and the bed clothes, and yet the Governor and Editor in\r\nembryo snored on, as though nothing had transpired. I then made another\r\nlunge for Tommy’s feet, and grabbed one, and held it, and tickled it\r\ntremendously, which proved to be Raymond’s, who darted up from his\r\npillow, and exclaimed: “Sir: What under Heaven are you doing with my\r\nfeet? I demand you to let them alone. I despise your impertinence,”\r\nand, without waiting for my explanation or apology, he violently buried\r\nhimself in the clothes, and off he went into a profound and noisy\r\nslumber. I seized Tom by his ear and hair and arm, and dragged him from\r\nthe bed, and he unconsciously pulled all the bed clothes with him,\r\nas he was yet about half asleep. It always took about half an hour to\r\nthoroughly arouse Tom from his morning orisons. But when I told Tom\r\nI had got him a situation, he awoke mighty quick. Raymond was so mad\r\nto find himself stripped of all the bed clothes, that he threatened\r\nto tell Parson Brown, the host, but Tom told him if he did, that he\r\nwould give him the worst thrashing he ever had, which made Raymond\r\ntremble. Although Tom was much shorter and weighed infinitely less than\r\nRaymond, yet he could strike a powerful blow, and Raymond knew it.\r\nTom and Raymond slept together two nights after that, without saying\r\na word to each other, but Sunday morning came, and as Raymond was a\r\nstiff Presbyterian, and attended Dr. Potts’ Church, he extended the\r\nhand of forgiveness and friendship to little Tommy, who accepted his\r\napology, and they were sweeter friends than ever. I now get mournful\r\nintelligence from New Orleans and Providence. I receive news of the\r\ndeath of my dear brother Albert at New Orleans, and my father writes me\r\nthat my wife’s father told him that he was about to induce his daughter\r\nto apply for a divorce from me. My father told him that I had been in\r\ndelicate health for several years, which had kept me very poor,—that\r\nhe was obliged, from humanity, to send me money occasionally, and that\r\nunder these melancholy circumstances, and in view of all that had\r\ntranspired in previous years, if he chose to induce his daughter to\r\napply for a divorce, he could not help it, and that probably neither\r\nhimself nor myself would oppose it. My father-in-law then said that\r\nthere was no alternative, and his daughter would apply for a divorce\r\nimmediately, and my father and father-in-law bade each other a cold\r\nfarewell, and never recognised each other afterwards. The divorce soon\r\nfollowed, to which I made not the shadow of resistance. What rendered\r\nthe divorce extremely painful was the almost daily visits of my wife\r\nto my father’s house ever since my disastrous crisis in 1837, when\r\nI was confined in the Providence jail. And even after the divorce,\r\nmy faithful and unfortunate wife continued her visits to my father’s\r\nfor a long period, without the knowledge of her father and mother,\r\nand wept, and wailed, (as my step mother has often told me,) like the\r\ndisconsolate and ever-weeping Niobe. My father-in-law owned several\r\nships, and not long after the divorce, the carrying trade was suddenly\r\nparalysed, and he failed for an immense sum, and he struggled, and\r\ntottered, and fell, and never recovered his commercial position. And\r\nthe magnificent mansion in which I was married, was violently seized\r\nduring his occupation, and his furniture thrown into the street,\r\nand himself and family ruthlessly ejected from its palacious halls.\r\nI lamented his downfall, but his fellow merchants did not, as they\r\never regarded him as a merciless miser. I brooded long on my wife’s\r\ncalamities and my own, and with a melancholy heart I went to Saint\r\nThomas’s Church on a cloudy summer day, and the Sexton politely\r\nescorted me to a pew. I had not long been seated, when a youth entered\r\nwith beautiful eyes and hair and features of touching sadness, and\r\ntook a seat beside me. He so strongly resembled a youth named Charles\r\nManton, who early died, (and whom I loved as no other being not of my\r\nkindred blood,) that I could not withdraw my eyes from his fascinating\r\nform and expression. During the prayers and chaunts, we divided the\r\nsacred book between us, and at the close of the exercises, we left the\r\npew together. As we were about to leave the church, I inquired his\r\nname, and residence, which he readily imparted, informing me that his\r\nname was Charles A. Jesup,—that he had recently lost his father,—that\r\nhis mother resided in\r\n\r\n(To be continued to our last dream.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!
