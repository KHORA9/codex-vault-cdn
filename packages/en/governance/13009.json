Arrived at Charleston, the travelers\r\nfitted themselves out for an overland journey, awaited a stretch of\r\nfavorable weather, and set off for the Waxhaw settlement, one hundred\r\nand eighty miles to the northwest, where numbers of their kinsmen and\r\ncountrymen were already established. There the Jacksons were received\r\nwith open arms by the family of a second brother-in-law, who had\r\nmigrated a few years earlier and who now had a comfortable log house\r\nand a good-sized clearing.\r\n\r\nThe settlement lay on the banks of the upper Catawba, near the junction\r\nof that stream with Waxhaw Creek; and as it occupied a fertile oasis in\r\na vast waste of pine woods, it was for decades largely cut off from\r\ntouch with the outside world. The settlement was situated, too, partly\r\nin North Carolina and partly in South Carolina, so that in the\r\npre-Revolutionary days many of the inhabitants hardly knew, or cared to\r\nknow, in which of the two provinces they dwelt.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival Jackson's friends bought land on the creek and\r\nwithin the bounds of the settlement. Jackson himself was too poor,\r\nhowever, to do this, and accordingly took up a claim six miles distant\r\non another little stream known as Twelve-mile Creek. Here, in the fall\r\nof 1765, he built a small cabin, and during the winter he cleared five\r\nor six acres of ground. The next year he was able to raise enough corn,\r\nvegetables, and pork to keep his little household from want. The tract\r\nthus occupied cannot be positively identified, but it lay in what is\r\nnow Union County, North Carolina, a few miles from Monroe, the county\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThen came tragedy of a sort in which frontier history abounds. In the\r\nmidst of his efforts to hew out a home and a future for those who were\r\ndear to him the father sickened and died, in March, 1767, at the early\r\nage of twenty-nine, less than two years after his arrival at the\r\nsettlement. Tradition says that his death was the result of a rupture\r\nsuffered in attempting to move a heavy log, and that it was so sudden\r\nthat the distracted wife had no opportunity to seek aid from the\r\ndistant neighbors. When at last the news got abroad, sympathy and\r\nassistance were lavished in true frontier fashion. Borne in a rude farm\r\nwagon, the remains were taken to the Waxhaw burying ground and were\r\ninterred in a spot which tradition, but tradition only, is able today\r\nto point out.\r\n\r\nThe widow never returned to the desolated homestead. She and her little\r\nones were taken into the family of one of her married sisters, where\r\nshe spent her few remaining years. On the 15th of March, less than two\r\nweeks after her husband's death, she gave birth to a third son; and the\r\nchild was promptly christened Andrew, in memory of the parent he would\r\nnever know.\r\n\r\nCuriously, the seventh President's birthplace has been a matter of\r\nsharp controversy. There is a tradition that the birth occurred while\r\nthe mother was visiting a neighboring family by the name of McKemy; and\r\nParton, one of Jackson's principal biographers, adduces a good deal of\r\nevidence in support of the story. On the other hand, Jackson always\r\nbelieved that he was born in the home of the aunt with whom his\r\nbereaved mother took up her residence; and several biographers,\r\nincluding Bassett, the most recent and the best, accept this\r\ncontention. It really matters not at all, save for the circumstance\r\nthat if the one view is correct Jackson was born in North Carolina,\r\nwhile if the other is correct he was born in South Carolina. Both\r\nStates have persistently claimed the honor. In the famous proclamation\r\nwhich he addressed to the South Carolina nullifiers in 1832 Jackson\r\nreferred to them as \"fellow-citizens of my native state\"; in his will\r\nhe spoke of himself as a South Carolinian; and in correspondence and\r\nconversation he repeatedly declared that he was born on South Carolina\r\nsoil. Jackson was far from infallible, even in matters closely touching\r\nhis own career. But the preponderance of evidence on the point lies\r\ndecidedly with South Carolina.\r\n\r\nNo one, at all events, can deny to the Waxhaw settlement an honored\r\nplace in American history. There the father of John C. Calhoun first\r\nmade his home. There the Revolutionary general, Andrew Pickens, met and\r\nmarried Rebecca Calhoun. There grew up the eminent North Carolinian\r\nGovernor and diplomat, William R. Davie. There William H. Crawford\r\nlived as a boy. And there Jackson dwelt until early manhood.\r\n\r\nFor the times, young Andrew was well brought up. His mother was a woman\r\nof strong character, who cherished for her last-born the desire that he\r\nshould become a Presbyterian clergyman. The uncle with whom he lived\r\nwas a serious-minded man who by his industry had won means ample for\r\nthe comfortable subsistence of his enlarged household. When he was old\r\nenough, the boy worked for his living, but no harder than the frontier\r\nboys of that day usually worked; and while his advantages were only\r\nsuch as a backwoods community afforded, they were at least as great as\r\nthose of most boys similarly situated, and they were far superior to\r\nthose of the youthful Lincoln.\r\n\r\nJackson's earlier years, nevertheless, contained little promise of his\r\nfuture distinction. He grew up amidst a rough people whose tastes ran\r\nstrongly to horse-racing, cockfighting, and heavy drinking, and whose\r\nideal of excellence found expression in a readiness to fight upon any\r\nand all occasions in defense of what they considered to be their\r\npersonal honor. In young Andrew Jackson these characteristics appeared\r\nin a superlative degree. He was mischievous, willful, daring, reckless.\r\nHardly an escapade took place in the community in which he did not\r\nshare; and his sensitiveness and quick temper led him continually into\r\ntrouble. In his early teens he swore like a trooper, chewed tobacco\r\nincessantly, acquired a taste for strong drink, and set a pace for\r\nwildness which few of his associates could keep up. He was passionately\r\nfond of running foot races, leaping the bar, jumping, wrestling, and\r\nevery sort of sport that partook of the character of mimic battle--and\r\nhe never acknowledged defeat. \"I could throw him three times out of\r\nfour,\" testifies an old schoolmate, \"but he would never stay throwed.\r\nHe was dead game even then, and never would give up.\" Another early\r\ncompanion says that of all the boys he had known Jackson was the only\r\nbully who was not also a coward.\r\n\r\nOf education the boy received only such as was put unavoidably in his\r\nway. It is said that his mother taught him to read before he was five\r\nyears old; and he attended several terms in the little low-roofed log\r\nschoolhouse in the Waxhaw settlement. But his formal instruction never\r\ntook him beyond the fundamentals of reading, writing, geography,\r\ngrammar, and \"casting accounts.\" He was neither studious nor teachable.\r\nAs a boy he preferred sport to study, and as a man he chose to rely on\r\nhis own fertile ideas rather than to accept guidance from others. He\r\nnever learned to write the English language correctly, although he\r\noften wrote it eloquently and convincingly. In an age of bad spellers\r\nhe achieved distinction from the number of ways in which he could spell\r\na word within the space of a single page. He could use no foreign\r\nlanguages; and of the great body of science, literature, history, and\r\nthe arts he knew next to nothing. He never acquired a taste for books,\r\nalthough vanity prompted him to treasure throughout his public career\r\nall correspondence and other documentary materials that might be of use\r\nto future biographers. Indeed, he picked as a biographer first his\r\nmilitary aide, John Reid, and later his close friend, John H. Eaton,\r\nwhom he had the satisfaction in 1829 of appointing Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution came, young Andrew was a boy of ten. For a time the\r\nCarolina backwoods did not greatly feel the effect of the change. But\r\nin the spring of 1780 all of the revolutionary troops in South Carolina\r\nwere captured at Charleston, and the lands from the sea to the\r\nmountains were left at the mercy of Tarleton's and Rawdon's bands of\r\nredcoats and their Tory supporters. Twice the Waxhaw settlement was\r\nravaged before the patriots could make a stand. Young Jackson witnessed\r\ntwo battles in 1780, without taking part in them, and in the following\r\nyear he, a brother, and a cousin were taken prisoners in a skirmish. To\r\nthe day of his death Jackson bore on his head and hand the marks of a\r\nsaber blow administered by a British lieutenant whose jack boots he\r\nrefused to polish. When an exchange of prisoners was made, Mrs. Jackson\r\nsecured the release of her two boys, but not until after they had\r\ncontracted smallpox in Camden jail. The older one died, but the\r\nyounger, though reduced to a skeleton, survived. Already the third\r\nbrother had given up his life in battle; and the crowning disaster came\r\nwhen the mother, going as a volunteer to nurse the wounded Waxhaw\r\nprisoners on the British vessels in Charleston harbor, fell ill of\r\nyellow fever and perished. Small wonder that Andrew Jackson always\r\nhated the British uniform, or that when he sat in the executive chair\r\nan anti-British feeling colored all of his dealings with foreign\r\nnations!\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen, the sandy-haired, pockmarked lad of the Waxhaws\r\nfound himself alone in the world. The death of his relatives had made\r\nhim heir to a portion of his grandfather's estate in Carrickfergus; but\r\nthe property was tied up in the hands of an administrator, and the boy\r\nwas in effect both penniless and homeless. The memory of his mother and\r\nher teachings was, as he was subsequently accustomed to say, the only\r\ncapital with which he started life. To a natural waywardness and\r\nquarrelsomeness had been added a heritage of bitter memories, and the\r\noutlook was not bright.\r\n\r\nUpon one thing the youth was determined: he would no longer be a charge\r\nupon his uncle or upon any one else. What to turn to, however, was not\r\nso easy to decide. First he tried the saddler's trade, but that was too\r\nmonotonous. Then he undertook school-teaching; that proved little\r\nbetter. Desirous of a glimpse of the world, he went to Charleston in\r\nthe autumn of 1782. There he made the acquaintance of some people of\r\nwealth and fell into habits of life which were beyond his means. At the\r\nrace track he bet and swaggered himself into notice; and when he ran\r\ninto debt he was lucky enough to free himself by winning a large wager.\r\nBut the proceeds of his little inheritance, which had in the meantime\r\nbecome available, were now entirely used up; and when in the spring the\r\nyoung spendthrift went back to the Waxhaws, he had only a fine horse\r\nwith elegant equipment, a costly pair of pistols, a gold watch, and a\r\nfair wardrobe--in addition to some familiarity with the usages of\r\nfashion--to show for his spent \"fortune.\"\r\n\r\nOne other thing which Jackson may have carried back with him from\r\nCharleston was an ambition to become a lawyer. At all events, in the\r\nfall of 1784 he entered the law office of a certain Spruce Macay in the\r\ntown of Salisbury, North Carolina; and, after three years of\r\nintermittent study, he was admitted to practice in the courts of the\r\nState. The instruction which he had received was not of a high order,\r\nand all accounts agree that the young man took his tasks lightly and\r\nthat he learned but little law. That he fully sustained the reputation\r\nwhich he had gained in the Waxhaws is indicated by testimony of one of\r\nMacay's fellow townsmen, after Jackson had become famous, to the effect\r\nthat the former student had been \"the most roaring, rollicking,\r\ngame-cocking, card-playing, mischievous fellow that ever lived in\r\nSalisbury.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his admission to the bar the irresponsible young blade hung out\r\nhis shingle in Martinsville, Guilford County, North Carolina, and sat\r\ndown to wait for clients. He was still less than twenty years old,\r\nwithout influence, and with only such friends as his irascible\r\ndisposition permitted him to make and hold. Naturally business came\r\nslowly, and it became necessary to eke out a living by serving as a\r\nlocal constable and also by assisting in a mercantile enterprise\r\ncarried on by two acquaintances in the town. After a year this\r\nhand-to-mouth existence began to pall. Neither then nor in later life\r\ndid Jackson have any real taste or aptitude for law. He was not of a\r\nlegal turn of mind, and he was wholly unprepared to suffer the\r\nsacrifices and disappointments which a man of different disposition\r\nwould have been willing to undergo in order to win for himself an\r\nestablished position in his profession. Chagrin in this restless young\r\nman was fast yielding to despair when an alluring field of action\r\nopened for him in the fast-developing country beyond the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of white men in that part of North Carolina which lay\r\nwest of the Alleghanies had begun a year or two after Jackson's birth.\r\nAt first the hardy pioneers found lodgment on the Watauga, Holston,\r\nNolichucky, and other streams to the east of modern Knoxville. But in\r\n1779 a colony was planted by James Robertson and John Donelson on the\r\nbanks of the Cumberland, two hundred miles farther west, and in a brief\r\ntime the remoter settlement, known as Nashville, became a Mecca for\r\nhomeseeking Carolinians and Virginians. The intervening hill and forest\r\ncountry abounded in hostile Indians. The settler or trader who\r\nundertook to traverse this region took his life in his hands, and the\r\nsettlements themselves were subject to perennial attack.\r\n\r\nIn 1788, after the collapse of an attempt of the people of the \"Western\r\nDistrict\" to set up an independent State by the name of Franklin, the\r\nNorth Carolina Assembly erected the three counties included in the\r\nCumberland settlement into a superior court district; and the person\r\nselected for judge was a close friend of Jackson, John McNairy, who\r\nalso had been a law pupil of Spruce Macay in Salisbury. McNairy had\r\nbeen in the Tennessee region two years, but at the time of receiving\r\nhis judicial appointment he was visiting friends in the Carolinas. His\r\ndescription of the opportunities awaiting ambitious young men in the\r\nback country influenced a half-dozen acquaintances, lawyers and others,\r\nto make the return trip with him; and among the number was Jackson.\r\nSome went to assume posts which were at McNairy's disposal, but Jackson\r\nwent only to see the country.\r\n\r\nAssembling at Morganton, on the east side of the mountains, in the fall\r\nof 1788, the party proceeded leisurely to Jonesboro, which, although as\r\nyet only a village of fifty or sixty log houses, was the metropolis of\r\nthe eastern Tennessee settlements. There the party was obliged to wait\r\nfor a sufficient band of immigrants to assemble before they could be\r\nled by an armed guard with some degree of safety through the dangerous\r\nmiddle country. As a highway had just been opened between Jonesboro and\r\nNashville, the travelers were able to cover the distance in fifteen\r\ndays. Jackson rode a fine stallion, while a pack mare carried his\r\nworldly effects, consisting of spare clothes, blankets, half a dozen\r\nlaw books, and small quantities of ammunition, tea, tobacco, liquor,\r\nand salt. For defense he bore a rifle and three pistols; and in his\r\npocket he carried one hundred and eighty dollars of the much valued\r\nhard money. On the second day of November the emigrant train made its\r\nappearance in Nashville bringing news of much interest--in particular,\r\nthat the Federal Constitution had been ratified by the ninth State, and\r\nthat the various legislatures were preparing to choose electors, who\r\nwould undoubtedly make George Washington the first President of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nLess than ten years old, Nashville had now a population of not over two\r\nhundred. But it was the center of a somewhat settled district extending\r\nup and down the Cumberland for a distance of eighty or ninety miles,\r\nand the young visitor from the Waxhaws quickly found it a promising\r\nfield for his talents. There was only one lawyer in the place, and\r\ncreditors who had been outbid for his services by their debtors were\r\nglad to put their cases in the hands of the newcomer. It is said that\r\nbefore Jackson had been in the settlement a month he had issued more\r\nthan seventy writs to delinquent debtors. When, in 1789, he was\r\nappointed \"solicitor,\" or prosecutor, in Judge McNairy's jurisdiction\r\nwith a salary of forty pounds for each court he attended, his fortune\r\nseemed made and he forthwith gave up all thought of returning to his\r\nCarolina home. Instead he took lodgings under the roof of the widow of\r\nJohn Donelson, and in 1791 he married a daughter of that doughty\r\nfrontiersman. Land was still cheap, and with the proceeds of his fees\r\nand salary he purchased a large plantation called Hunter's Hill,\r\nthirteen miles from Nashville, and there he planned to establish a home\r\nwhich would take rank as one of the finest in the western country.\r\n\r\nThe work of a frontier solicitor was diverse and arduous. A turbulent\r\nsociety needed to be kept in order and the business obligations of a\r\nshifty and quarrelsome people to be enforced. No great knowledge of law\r\nwas required, but personal fearlessness, vigor, and incorruptibility\r\nwere indispensable. Jackson was just the man for the business. His\r\nphysical courage was equaled by his moral strength; he was passionately\r\ndevoted to justice; he was diligent and conscientious; and, as one\r\nwriter has remarked, bad grammar, incorrect pronunciation, and violent\r\ndenunciation did not shock the judges of that day or divert the mind of\r\njuries from the truth. Traveling almost constantly over the wretched\r\nroads and through the dark forests, dodging Indians, swimming his horse\r\nacross torrential streams, sleeping alone in the woods with hand on\r\nrifle, threatened by desperate wrongdoers, Andrew Jackson became the\r\nbest-known figure in all western Tennessee and won at this time a great\r\nmeasure of that public confidence which later became his chief\r\npolitical asset.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rapid growth of population south of the Ohio River made\r\nnecessary new arrangements for purposes of government. In 1790 the\r\nregion between the Ohio and the present States of Alabama and\r\nMississippi, having been turned over to the Nation by its earlier\r\npossessors, was erected into the \"Southwest Territory,\" and in 1791 the\r\nnorthern half became the State of Kentucky. In 1793 the remainder of\r\nthe Territory set up a Legislature, and three years later delegates\r\nfrom the eleven counties met at Knoxville to draw up a new frame of\r\ngovernment with a view to admission to statehood. Jackson was a member\r\nof this convention, and tradition has it that it was he who brought\r\nabout the selection of the name Tennessee, an Indian term meaning \"The\r\nGreat Crooked River,\" as against Franklin, Washington, and other\r\nproposed designations for the new State. At all events, upon the\r\nadmission of the State in 1796, he was chosen as its sole\r\nrepresentative in the lower branch of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn of that year the young lawmaker set out for the\r\nnational capital at Philadelphia, and there he arrived, after a journey\r\nof almost eight hundred miles on horseback, just as the triumphs of the\r\nDemocrats in the recent presidential election were being duly\r\ncelebrated. He had not been chosen as a party man, but it is altogether\r\nprobable that his own sympathies and those of most of his constituents\r\nlay with the Jeffersonians; and his appearance on the floor of Congress\r\nwas an omen of the fast-rising tide of western democracy which should\r\nnever find its ultimate goal until this rough but honest Tennesseean\r\nshould himself be borne into the presidential chair.\r\n\r\nJackson's career in Congress was brief and uneventful. After a year of\r\nservice in the House of Representatives he was appointed to fill the\r\nunexpired term of William Blount in the Senate. But this post he\r\nresigned in 1798 in order to devote his energies to his private\r\naffairs. While at Philadelphia he made the acquaintance not only of\r\nJohn Adams, Jefferson, Randolph, Gallatin, and Burr, but of his future\r\nSecretary of State, Edward Livingston, and of some other persons who\r\nwere destined to be closely connected with his later career. But\r\nJackson was not fitted for a legislative body either by training or by\r\ntemperament. He is recorded as speaking in the House only twice and in\r\nthe Senate not at all, and he seems to have made no considerable\r\nimpression upon his colleagues. Gallatin later described him as \"a\r\ntall, lank, uncouth-looking personage, with long locks of hair hanging\r\nover his face, and a queue down his back tied in an eel-skin; his dress\r\nsingular, his manners and deportment those of a rough backwoodsman.\"\r\nAnd Jefferson is represented as saying of Jackson to Webster at\r\nMonticello in 1824: \"His passions are terrible. When I was president of\r\nthe Senate he was Senator, and he could never speak on account of the\r\nrashness of his feelings. I have seen him attempt it repeatedly, and as\r\noften choke with rage.\"\r\n\r\nReturn to Tennessee meant, however, only a transfer from one branch of\r\nthe public service to another, for the ex-Senator was promptly\r\nappointed to a judgeship of the state supreme court at a salary of six\r\nhundred dollars a year. The position he found not uncongenial and he\r\nretained it for six years. Now, as earlier, Jackson's ignorance of law\r\nwas somewhat compensated by his common sense, courage, and\r\nimpartiality; and while only one of his decisions of this period is\r\nextant, Parton reports that the tradition of fifty years ago\r\nrepresented them as short, untechnical, unlearned, sometimes\r\nungrammatical, but generally right. The daily life of Jackson as a\r\nfrontier judge was hardly less active and exciting than it had been\r\nwhen he was a prosecuting attorney. There were long and arduous\r\nhorseback journeys \"on circuit\"; ill-tempered persons often threatened,\r\nand sometimes attempted, to deal roughly with the author of an\r\nunfavorable decision; occasionally it was necessary to lay aside his\r\ndignity long enough to lend a hand in capturing or controlling a\r\ndesperate character. For example, on arriving once in a settlement\r\nJackson found that a powerful blacksmith had committed a crime and that\r\nthe sheriff dared not arrest him. \"Summon me,\" said the judge;\r\nwhereupon he walked down from the bench, found the culprit, led him\r\ninto court, and sentenced him.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Jackson resigned his judgeship in order to give exclusive\r\nattention again to his private affairs. He had fallen badly into debt,\r\nand his creditors were pressing him hard. One expedient after another\r\nfailed, and finally Hunter's Hill had to be given up. He saved enough\r\nfrom the wreck, however, to purchase a small plantation eight miles\r\nfrom Nashville; and there, after several years of financial\r\nrehabilitation, he erected the handsome brick house which the country\r\ncame subsequently to know as \"The Hermitage.\" In partnership with two\r\nof his wife's relatives, Jackson had opened a store in which, even\r\nwhile still a member of the highest tribunal of the State, he not\r\ninfrequently passed tea and salt and calico over the counter to his\r\nneighbors. In small trading, however, he was not adept, and the store\r\nfailed. Nevertheless, from 1804 until 1813 he successfully combined\r\nwith planting and the stock-raising business enterprises of a larger\r\nsort, especially slave and horse dealing. His debts paid off, he now\r\nbecame one of the most prosperous, as he already was one of the most\r\ninfluential, men of the Cumberland country.\r\n\r\nBut it was not given to Andrew Jackson to be a mere money-maker or to\r\ndwell in quietness. In 1804 he was denied the governorship of the New\r\nOrleans Territory because he was described to Jefferson as \"a man of\r\nviolent passions, arbitrary in his disposition, and frequently engaged\r\nin broils and disputes.\" During the next decade he fully lived up to\r\nthis description. He quarreled with Governor John Sevier, and only the\r\nintervention of friends prevented the two from doing each other\r\nviolence. He broke off friendly relations with his old patron, Judge\r\nMcNairy. In a duel he killed Charles Dickinson, who had spoken\r\ndisparagingly of Mrs. Jackson, and he himself suffered a wound which\r\nweakened him for life. He publicly caned one Thomas Swann. In a\r\nrough-and-tumble encounter with Thomas Hart Benton and the latter's\r\nbrother Jesse he was shot in the shoulder and one of his antagonists\r\nwas stabbed. This list of quarrels, threats, fights, and other violent\r\noutbursts could be extended to an amazing length. \"Yes, I had a fight\r\nwith Jackson,\" Senator Benton admitted late in life; \"a fellow was\r\nhardly in the fashion then who hadn't.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of forty-five Jackson had not yet found himself. He was\r\nknown in his own State as \"a successful planter, a breeder and racer of\r\nhorses, a swearer of mighty oaths, a faithful and generous man to his\r\nfriends, a chivalrous man to women, a hospitable man at his home, a\r\ndesperate and relentless man in personal conflicts, a man who always\r\ndid the things he set himself to do.\" But he had achieved no\r\nnation-wide distinction; he had not wrought out a career; he had made\r\nalmost as many enemies as friends, he had cut himself off from official\r\nconnections; he had no desire to return to the legal profession; and he\r\nwas so dissatisfied with his lot and outlook that he seriously\r\nconsidered moving to Mississippi in order to make a fresh start.\r\n\r\nOne thread, however, still bound him to the public service. From 1802\r\nhe had been major general of militia in the eleven counties of western\r\nTennessee; and notwithstanding the fact that three calls from the\r\nGovernment during a decade had yielded no real opportunity for action,\r\nhe clung both to the office and to the hope for a chance to lead his\r\n\"hardy sons of the West\" against a foe worthy of their efforts. This\r\nchance came sooner than people expected, and it led in precisely the\r\ndirection that Jackson would have chosen--toward the turbulent,\r\nmisgoverned Spanish dependency of Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE CREEK WAR AND THE VICTORY OF NEW ORLEANS\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows and loves the story of the midnight ride of Paul\r\nRevere. But hardly anybody has heard of the twenty-day,\r\nfifteen-hundred-mile ride of \"Billy\" Phillips, the President's express\r\ncourier, who in 1812 carried to the Southwest the news that the people\r\nof the United States had entered upon a second war with their British\r\nkinsmen. William Phillips was a young, lithe Tennesseean whom Senator\r\nCampbell took to Washington in 1811 as secretary. When not more than\r\nsixteen years old he had enjoyed the honor of riding Andrew Jackson's\r\nfamous steed, Truxton, in a heat race, for the largest purse ever heard\r\nof west of the mountains, with the proud owner on one side of the\r\nstakes. In Washington he occasionally turned an honest penny by\r\njockey-riding in the races on the old track of Bladensburg, and\r\neventually he became one of a squad of ten or twelve expert horsemen\r\nemployed by the Government in carrying urgent long-distance messages.\r\n\r\nAfter much hesitation, Congress passed a joint resolution at about five\r\no'clock on Friday, June 18, 1812, declaring war against Great Britain.\r\nBefore sundown the express couriers were dashing swiftly on their\r\nseveral courses, some toward reluctant New England, some toward\r\nPennsylvania and New York, some southward, some westward. To Phillips\r\nit fell to carry the momentous news to his own Tennessee country and\r\nthence down the Mississippi to New Orleans. That the task was\r\nundertaken with all due energy is sufficiently attested in a letter\r\nwritten by a Baptist clergyman at Lexington, North Carolina, to a\r\nfriend, who happened to have been one of Jackson's old teachers at the\r\nWaxhaws. \"I have to inform you,\" runs the communication, \"that just now\r\nthe President's express-rider, Bill Phillips, has tore through this\r\nlittle place without stopping. He came and went in a cloud of dust, his\r\nhorse's tail and his own long hair streaming alike in the wind as they\r\nflew by. But as he passed the tavern stand where some were gathered he\r\nswung his leather wallet by its straps above his head and\r\nshouted--'Here's the Stuff! Wake up! War! War with England!! War!!!'\r\nThen he disappeared in a cloud of dust down the Salisbury Road like a\r\nstreak of Greased Lightnin'.\" Nine days brought the indefatigable\r\ncourier past Hillsboro, Salisbury, Morganton, Jonesboro, and Knoxville\r\nto Nashville--a daily average of ninety-five miles over mountains and\r\nthrough uncleared country. In eleven days more the President's\r\ndispatches were in the hands of Governor Claiborne at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe joy of the West was unbounded. The frontiersman was always ready\r\nfor a fight, and just now he especially wanted a fight with England. He\r\nresented the insults that his country had suffered at the hands of the\r\nEnglish authorities and had little patience with the vacillating policy\r\nso long pursued by Congress and the Madison Administration. Other\r\ngrievances came closer home. For two years the West had been disturbed\r\nby Indian wars and intrigues for which the English officers and agents\r\nin Canada were held largely responsible. In 1811 Governor Harrison of\r\nIndiana Territory defeated the Indians at Tippecanoe. But Tecumseh was\r\neven then working among the Creeks, Cherokees, and other southern\r\ntribes with a view to a confederation which should be powerful enough\r\nto put a stop to the sale of land to the advancing white population. A\r\nrenewal of the disorders was therefore momentarily expected.\r\nFurthermore, the people of the Southwest were as usual on bad terms\r\nwith their Spanish neighbors in Florida and Texas; they coveted an\r\nopportunity for vengeance for wrongs which they had suffered; and some\r\nlonged for the conquest of Spanish territory. At all events, war with\r\nEngland was the more welcome because Spain, as an ally of that power,\r\nwas likely to be involved.\r\n\r\nNowhere was the news received with greater enthusiasm than at\r\nNashville; and by no one with more satisfaction than by Andrew Jackson.\r\nAs major general of militia Jackson had for ten years awaited just such\r\na chance for action. In 1811 he wrote fervently to Harrison offering to\r\ncome to his assistance in the Wabash expedition with five hundred West\r\nTennesseeans, but his services were not needed. At the close of the\r\nyear he induced the Governor of his State, William Blount, to inform\r\nthe War Department that he could have twenty-five hundred men \"before\r\nQuebec within ninety days\" if desired. Again he was refused. But now\r\nhis opportunity had come. Billy Phillips was hardly on his way to\r\nNatchez before Jackson, Blount, and Benton were addressing a mass\r\nmeeting called to \"ratify\" the declaration of war, and on the following\r\nday a courier started for Washington with a letter from Jackson\r\ntendering the services of twenty-five hundred Tennesseeans and assuring\r\nthe President, with better patriotism than syntax, that wherever it\r\nmight please him to find a place of duty for these men he could depend\r\nupon them to stay \"till they or the last armed foe expires.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some delay the offer was accepted. Already the fiery major\r\ngeneral was dreaming of a conquest of Florida. \"You burn with anxiety,\"\r\nran a proclamation issued to his division in midsummer, \"to learn on\r\nwhat theater your arms will find employment. Then turn your eyes to the\r\nSouth! Behold in the province of West Florida a territory whose rivers\r\nand harbors are indispensable to the prosperity of the western, and\r\nstill more so, to the eastern division of our state. . . . It is here\r\nthat an employment adapted to your situation awaits your courage and\r\nyour zeal, and while extending in this quarter the boundaries of the\r\nRepublic to the Gulf of Mexico, you will experience a peculiar\r\nsatisfaction in having conferred a signal benefit on that section of\r\nthe Union to which you yourselves immediately belong.\"\r\n\r\nIt lay in the cards that Jackson was to be a principal agent in\r\nwresting the Florida country from the Spaniards; and while there was at\r\nWashington no intention of allowing him to set off post-haste upon the\r\nmission, all of the services which he was called upon to render during\r\nthe war converged directly upon that objective. After what seemed an\r\ninterminable period of waiting came the first order to move. Fifteen\r\nhundred Tennessee troops were to go to New Orleans, ostensibly to\r\nprotect the city against a possible British attack, but mainly to be\r\nquickly available in case an invasion of West Florida should be decided\r\nupon; and Jackson, freshly commissioned major general of volunteers,\r\nwas to lead the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe rendezvous was fixed at Nashville for early December; and when more\r\nthan two thousand men, representing almost every family of influence in\r\nthe western half of the State, presented themselves, Governor Blount\r\nauthorized the whole number to be mustered. On the 7th of January the\r\nhastily equipped detachment started, fourteen hundred infantrymen going\r\ndown the ice-clogged Cumberland in flatboats and six hundred and\r\nseventy mounted riflemen proceeding by land. The Governor sent a letter\r\ncarrying his blessing. Jackson responded with an effusive note in which\r\nhe expressed the hope that \"the God of battles may be with us.\" Parton\r\nsays with truth that the heart of western Tennessee went down the river\r\nwith the expedition. In a letter to the Secretary of War Jackson\r\ndeclared that his men had no \"constitutional scruples,\" but would, if\r\nso ordered, plant the American eagle on the \"walls\" of Mobile,\r\nPensacola, and St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nAfter five weeks the troops, in high spirits, reassembled at Natchez.\r\nThen came cruel disappointment. From New Orleans Governor James\r\nWilkinson, doubtless moved by hatred of Jackson quite as much as by\r\nconsiderations of public policy, ordered the little army to stay where\r\nit was. And on the 15th of March there was placed in the commander's\r\nhands a curt note from the Secretary of War saying that the reasons for\r\nthe undertaking had disappeared, and announcing that the corps under\r\nthe Tennesseean's command had \"ceased to exist.\"\r\n\r\nJackson flew into a rage--and with more reason than on certain other\r\noccasions. He was sure that there was treachery somewhere; at the\r\nleast, it was all a trick to bring a couple of thousand good Tennessee\r\nvolunteers within the clutches of Wilkinson's recruiting officers. He\r\nmanaged to write to the President a temperate letter of protest; but to\r\nGovernor Blount and to the troops he unbosomed himself with\r\ncharacteristic forcefulness of speech. There was nothing to do but\r\nreturn home. But the irate commander determined to do it in a manner to\r\nimpress the country. He kept his force intact, drew rations from the\r\ncommissary department at Natchez, and marched back to Nashville with\r\nall the Èclat that would have attended a returning conqueror. When\r\nWilkinson's subordinates refused to pay the cost of transporting the\r\nsick, Jackson pledged his own credit for the purpose, to the amount of\r\ntwelve thousand dollars. It was on the trying return march that his\r\nriflemen conferred on him the happy nickname \"Old Hickory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War later sought to appease the irascible major\r\ngeneral by offering a wholly plausible explanation of the sudden\r\nreversal of the Government's policy; and the expenses of the troops on\r\nthe return march were fully met out of the national treasury. But\r\nJackson drew from the experience only gall and wormwood. About the time\r\nwhen the men reached Natchez, Congress definitely authorized the\r\nPresident to take possession of Mobile and that part of Florida west of\r\nthe Perdido River; and, back once more in the humdrum life of\r\nNashville, the disappointed officer could only sit idly by while his\r\npet project was successfully carried out by General Wilkinson, the man\r\nwhom, perhaps above all others, he loathed. But other work was\r\npreparing; and, after all, most of Florida was yet to be won.\r\n\r\nIn the late summer of 1813 the western country was startled by news of\r\na sudden attack of a band of upwards of a thousand Creeks on Fort Mims,\r\nAlabama, culminating in a massacre in which two hundred and fifty white\r\nmen, women, and children lost their lives. It was the most bloody\r\noccurrence of the kind in several decades, and it brought instantly to\r\na head a situation which Jackson, in common with many other military\r\nmen, had long viewed with apprehension.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the broad stretches of hill and valley land\r\nsouthwards from the winding Tennessee to the Gulf were occupied, or\r\nused as hunting grounds, by the warlike tribes forming the loose-knit\r\nCreek Confederacy. Much of this land was extremely fertile, and most of\r\nit required little labor to prepare it for cultivation. Consequently\r\nafter 1800 the influx of white settlers, mainly cotton raisers, was\r\nheavy; and by 1812 the great triangular area between the Alabama and\r\nthe Tombigbee, as well as extensive tracts along the upper Tombigbee\r\nand the Mobile, was quite fully occupied. The heart of the Creek\r\ncountry was the region about the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, which\r\njoin in central Alabama to form the stream which bears the State's\r\nname. But not even this district was immune from encroachment.\r\n\r\nThe Creeks were not of a sort to submit to the loss of their lands\r\nwithout a struggle. Though Tecumseh, in 1811, had brought them to the\r\npoint of an uprising, his plans were not carried out, and it remained\r\nfor the news of hostilities between the United States and Great Britain\r\nto rouse the war spirit afresh. In a short time the entire Creek\r\ncountry was aflame. Arms and ammunition the Indians obtained from the\r\nSpaniards across the Florida border, and Colonel Edward Nicholls, now\r\nstationed at Pensacola as provisional British Governor, gave them open\r\nencouragement. The danger was understood not only among the people of\r\nthe Southwest but in Washington. Before plans of defense could be\r\ncarried into effect, however, the war broke out, and the wretched\r\npeople who had crowded into the flimsy stockade called by courtesy Fort\r\nMims were massacred.\r\n\r\nHardly had the heap of ruins, ghastly with human bodies, ceased to\r\nsmolder before fleet riders were spreading the news in Georgia, in\r\nLouisiana, and in Tennessee. A shudder swept the country. Every exposed\r\ncommunity expected to be attacked next. The people's demand for\r\nvengeance was overmastering, and from north, west, and east volunteer\r\narmies were soon on the march. Tennessee sent two quotas, one from the\r\neastern counties under General John Cocke, the other from the western\r\nunder Andrew Jackson. When the news of the disaster on the Mobile\r\nreached Nashville, Jackson was lying helpless from wounds received in\r\nhis fight with the Bentons. But he issued the necessary orders from his\r\nbed and let it be known with customary vigor that he, the senior major\r\ngeneral, and no one else, would lead the expedition; and though three\r\nweeks later he started off with his arm tightly bandaged to his side\r\nand a shoulder so sore that it could not bear the pressure of an\r\nepaulette, lead the expedition he did.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of October the emaciated but dogged commander brought\r\nhis forces together, 2700 strong, at Huntsville and began cutting his\r\nway across the mountains toward the principal Creek settlements. His\r\nplan was to fall suddenly upon these settlements, strike terror into\r\nthe inhabitants, and force a peace on terms that would guarantee the\r\nsafety of the frontier populations. Supplies were slow to arrive, and\r\nJackson fumed and stormed. He quarreled desperately, too, with Cocke,\r\nwhom he unjustly blamed for mismanagement. But at last he was able to\r\nemerge on the banks of the Coosa and build a stockade, Fort Strother,\r\nto serve as a base for the campaign.\r\n\r\nDuring the months that followed, the intrepid leader was compelled to\r\nfight two foes--his insubordinate militiamen and the Creeks. His\r\ncommand consisted partly of militia and partly of volunteers, including\r\nmany men who had first enlisted for the expedition down the\r\nMississippi. Starvation and disease caused loud murmurings, and after\r\none or two minor victories had been won the militiamen took it into\r\ntheir heads to go back home. Jackson drew up the volunteers across the\r\nmutineers' path and drove them back to the camp. Then the volunteers\r\nstarted off, and the militia had to be used to bring them back! At one\r\ntime the furious general faced a mutinous band single-handed and,\r\nswearing that he would shoot the first man who stirred, awed the\r\nrecalcitrants into obedience. On another occasion he had a youth who\r\nhad been guilty of insubordination shot before the whole army as an\r\nobject lesson. At last it became apparent that nothing could be done\r\nwith such troops, and the volunteers--such of them as had not already\r\nslipped away--were allowed to go home. Governor Blount advised that the\r\nwhole undertaking be given up. But Jackson wrote him a letter that\r\nbrought a flush of shame to his cheek, and in a short time fresh forces\r\nby the hundreds, with ample supplies, were on the way to Fort Strother.\r\nAmong the newcomers was a lank, angular-featured frontiersman who\r\nanswered to the name of Sam Houston.\r\n\r\nAfter having been reduced for a short period to one hundred men,\r\nJackson by early spring had an army of five thousand, including a\r\nregiment of regulars, and found it once more possible to act. The enemy\r\ndecided to make its stand at a spot called by the Indians Tohopeka, by\r\nthe whites Horseshoe Bend, on the Tallapoosa. Here a thousand warriors,\r\nwith many women and children, took refuge behind breastworks which they\r\nbelieved impregnable, and here, in late March, Jackson attacked with a\r\nforce of three thousand men. No quarter was asked and none given, on\r\neither side, and the battle quickly became a butchery. Driven by fire\r\nfrom a thicket of dry brush in which they took refuge, the Creek\r\nwarriors were shot down or bayoneted by the hundreds; those who plunged\r\ninto the river for safety were killed as they swam. Scarcely a hundred\r\nsurvived. Among the number was a youth who could speak a little\r\nEnglish, and whose broken leg one of the surgeons undertook to treat.\r\nThree stalwart riflemen were required to hold the patient. \"Lie still,\r\nmy boy, they will save your life,\" said Jackson encouragingly, as he\r\ncame upon the scene. \"No good,\" replied the disconsolate victim. \"No\r\ngood. Cure um now, kill um again!\"\r\n\r\nThe victory practically ended the war. Many of the \"Red Sticks,\" as the\r\nCreek braves were called, fled beyond the Florida border; but\r\nmany--among them the astute half-breed Weathersford, who had ordered\r\nthe assault on Fort Mims--came in and surrendered. Fort Jackson, built\r\nin the river fork, became an outpost of American sovereignty in the\r\nvery heart of the Creek district. \"The fiends of the Tallapoosa,\"\r\ndeclared the victorious commander in his farewell address to his men,\r\n\"will no longer murder our women and children, or disturb the quiet of\r\nour borders.\"\r\n\r\nJackson returned to Tennessee to find himself the most popular man in\r\nthe State. Nashville gave him the first of what was destined to be a\r\nlong series of tumultuous receptions; and within a month the news came\r\nthat William Henry Harrison had resigned his commission and that\r\nJackson had been appointed a major general in the army of the United\r\nStates, with command in the southwestern district, including Mobile and\r\nNew Orleans. \"Thus did the frontier soldier, who eighteen months\r\nearlier had not commanded an expedition or a detachment, come to occupy\r\nthe highest rank in the army of his country. No other man in that\r\ncountry's service since the Revolution has risen to the top quite so\r\nquickly.\" π π Bassett, The Life of Andrew Jackson, Vol. I, p. 123.\r\n\r\nBy his appointment Jackson became the eventual successor of General\r\nWilkinson, with headquarters at New Orleans. His first move, however,\r\nwas to pay a visit to Mobile; and on his way thither, in August, 1814,\r\nhe paused in the Creek country to garner the fruits of his late\r\nvictory. A council of the surviving chiefs was assembled and a treaty\r\nwas presented, with a demand that it be signed forthwith. The terms\r\ntook the Indians aback, but argument was useless. The whites were\r\ngranted full rights to maintain military posts and roads and to\r\nnavigate the rivers in the Creek lands; the Creeks had to promise to\r\nstop trading with British and Spanish posts; and they were made to cede\r\nto the United States all the lands which their people had claimed west\r\nand southeast of the Coosa River--more than half of their ancient\r\nterritories. Thus was the glory of the Creek nation brought to an end.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war with Great Britain was entering a new and threatening\r\nphase. No notable successes had been achieved on land, and repeated\r\nattempts to reduce Canada had signally failed. On the Great Lakes and\r\nthe high seas the navy had won glory, but only a handful of privateers\r\nwas left to keep up the fight. The collapse of Napoleon's power had\r\nbrought a lull in Europe, and the British were free to concentrate\r\ntheir energies as never before on the conflict in America. The effects\r\nwere promptly seen in the campaign which led to the capture of\r\nWashington and the burning of the Federal Capitol in August, 1814. They\r\nwere equally manifest in a well-laid plan for a great assault on the\r\ncountry's southern borders and on the great Mississippi Valley beyond.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned project meant that, after two years of immunity, the\r\nSouthwest had become a main theater of the war. There was plenty of\r\nwarning of what was coming, for the British squadron intended for the\r\nattack began assembling in the West Indies before the close of summer.\r\nNo one knew, however, where or when the blow would fall. To Jackson the\r\nfirst necessity seemed to be to make sure of the defenses of Mobile.\r\nFor a time, at all events, he believed that the attack would be made\r\nthere, rather than at New Orleans; and an attempt of a British naval\r\nforce in September to destroy Fort Bowyer, at the entrance to Mobile\r\nBay, confirmed his opinion.\r\n\r\nBut the chief attraction of Mobile for the General was its proximity to\r\nFlorida. In July he had written to Washington asking permission to\r\noccupy Pensacola. Months passed without a reply. Temptation to action\r\ngrew; and when, in October, three thousand Tennessee troops arrived\r\nunder one of the subordinate officers in the recent Creek War, longer\r\nhesitation seemed a sign of weakness. Jackson therefore led his forces\r\nagainst the Spanish stronghold, now in British hands, and quickly\r\nforced its surrender. His men blew up one of the two forts, and the\r\nBritish blew up the other. Within a week the work was done and the\r\nGeneral, well pleased with his exploit, was back at Mobile. There he\r\nfound awaiting him, in reply to his July letter, an order from the new\r\nSecretary of War, James Monroe, forbidding him to touch Pensacola. No\r\ngreat harm was done, for the invaded territory was no longer neutral\r\nsoil, and the task of soothing the ruffled feelings of the Spanish\r\ncourt did not prove difficult.\r\n\r\nAs the autumn wore on, signs multiplied that the first British\r\nobjective in the South was to be New Orleans, and no efforts were\r\nspared by the authorities at Washington to arouse the Southwest to its\r\ndanger and to stimulate an outpouring of troops sufficient to repel any\r\nforce that might be landed at the mouth of the Mississippi. On the 21st\r\nof November, Jackson set out for the menaced city. Five days later a\r\nfleet of fifty vessels, carrying ten thousand veteran British troops\r\nunder command of Generals Pakenham and Gibbs, started from Jamaica for\r\nwhat was expected to be an easy conquest. On the 10th of December the\r\nhostile armada cast anchor off the Louisiana coast. Two weeks later\r\nsome two thousand redcoats emerged from Lake Borgne, within six or\r\nseven miles of New Orleans, when the approach to the city on that side\r\nwas as yet unguarded by a gun or a man or an entrenchment.\r\n\r\nThat the \"impossible\" was now accomplished was due mainly to Jackson,\r\nalthough credit must not be withheld from a dozen energetic subordinate\r\nofficers nor from the thousands of patriots who made up the rank and\r\nfile of the hastily gathered forces of defense. Men from Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee--all contributed to one\r\nof the most remarkable military achievements in our history; although\r\nwhen the fight was over it was found that hundreds were still as\r\nunarmed as when they arrived upon the scene.\r\n\r\nA preliminary clash, in a dense fog, on the second evening before\r\nChristmas served to inspire each army with a wholesome respect for the\r\nother. The British decided to postpone further action until their\r\nentire force could be brought up, and this gave Jackson just the time\r\nhe needed to assemble his own scattered divisions, select lines of\r\ndefense, and throw up breastworks. By the end of the first week of\r\nJanuary both sides were ready for the test.\r\n\r\nThe British army was a splendid body of seven thousand trained\r\nsoldiers, seamen, and marines.\r\n\r\nThere were regiments which had helped Wellington to win Talavera,\r\nSalamanca, and Victoria, and within a few short months some of these\r\nsame regiments were to stand in that thin red line which Ney and\r\nNapoleon's guard could never break. Their general, Pakenham,\r\nWellington's brother-in-law, was a distinguished pupil of his\r\nillustrious kinsman. Could frontiersmen who had never fought together\r\nbefore, who had never seen the face of a civilized foe, withstand the\r\nconquerors of Napoleon? But two branches of the same stubborn race were\r\nrepresented on that little watery plain. The soldiers trained to serve\r\nthe strongest will in the Old World were face to face with the rough\r\nand ready yeomanry embattled for defense by the one man of the new\r\nworld whose soul had most iron in it. It was Salamanca against\r\nTohopeka, discipline against individual alertness, the Briton of the\r\nlittle Isle against the Briton of the wastes and wilds. But there was\r\none great difference. Wellington, \"the Iron Duke,\" was not there; \"Old\r\nHickory\" was everywhere along the American lines. π\r\n\r\nπ Brown, Andrew Jackson, pp. 75-76.\r\n\r\nBehind their battery-studded parapets the Americans waited for the\r\nBritish to make an assault. This the invaders did, five thousand\r\nstrong, on January 8, 1815. The fighting was hard, but the main attack\r\nfailed at every point. Three British major generals, including\r\nPakenham, were killed early in the action, and the total British loss\r\nexceeded two thousand. The American loss was but seventy-one. The\r\nshattered foe fell back, lay inactive for ten days, and then quietly\r\nwithdrew as they had come. Though Jackson was not noted for piety, he\r\nalways believed that his success on this occasion was the work of\r\nProvidence. \"Heaven, to be sure,\" he wrote to Monroe, \"has interposed\r\nmost wonderfully in our behalf, and I am filled with gratitude when I\r\nlook back to what we have escaped.\"\r\n\r\nBy curious irony, the victory had no bearing upon the formal results of\r\nthe war. A treaty of peace had been signed at Ghent two weeks before,\r\nand the news of the pacification and of the exploit at New Orleans\r\nreached the distracted President at almost the same time. But who shall\r\nsay that the battle was not one of the most momentous in American\r\nhistory? It compensated for a score of humiliations suffered by the\r\ncountry in the preceding years. It revived the people's drooping pride\r\nand put new energy into the nation's dealings with its rivals,\r\ncontributing more than any other single event to make this war indeed a\r\n\"second war of independence.\" \"Now,\" declared Henry Clay when the news\r\nreached him in Paris, \"I can go to England without mortification.\"\r\nFinally, the battle brought Andrew Jackson into his own as the idol and\r\nincarnation of the West, and set the western democracy decisively\r\nforward as a force to be reckoned with in national affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE \"CONQUEST\" OF FLORIDA\r\n\r\nThe victory at New Orleans made Jackson not only the most popular man\r\nin the United States but a figure of international interest. \"Napoleon,\r\nreturning from Elba to eke out the Hundred Days and add the name\r\nWaterloo to history, paused now and then a moment to study Jackson at\r\nNew Orleans. The Duke of Wellington, chosen by assembled Europe to meet\r\nthe crisis, could find time even at Brussels to call for 'all available\r\ninformation on the abortive expedition against Louisiana.'\" π\r\n\r\nπ Buell, History of Andrew Jackson, Vol II, pp. 94-95.\r\n\r\nWhile his countrymen were sounding his praises, the General, however,\r\nfell into a controversy with the authorities and people of New Orleans\r\nwhich lent a drab aspect to the closing scene of an otherwise brilliant\r\ndrama. One of his first acts upon arriving in the defenseless city had\r\nbeen to declare martial law; and under the decree the daily life of the\r\ninhabitants had been rigorously circumscribed, citizens had been\r\npressed into military service, men under suspicion had been locked up,\r\nand large quantities of cotton and other supplies had been seized for\r\nthe soldiers' use. When Pakenham's army was defeated, people expected\r\nan immediate return to normal conditions. Jackson, however, proposed to\r\ntake no chances. Neither the sailing of the British fleet nor the\r\nreceipt of the news of peace from Admiral Cochrane influenced him to\r\nrelax his vigilance, and only after official instructions came from\r\nWashington in the middle of March was the ban lifted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a violent quarrel had broken out between the commander and\r\nthe civil authorities, who naturally wished to resume their accustomed\r\nfunctions. Finding that the Creoles were systematically evading service\r\nby registering as French citizens, Jackson abruptly ordered all such\r\npeople from the city; and he was responsible for numerous other\r\narbitrary acts. Protests were lodged, and some people threatened\r\njudicial proceedings. But they might have saved their breath. Jackson\r\nwas not the man to argue matters of the kind. A leading Creole who\r\npublished an especially pointed protest was clapped into prison, and\r\nwhen the Federal district judge, Hall, issued a writ of habeas corpus\r\nin his behalf, Jackson had him also shut up.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was liberated, the irate judge summoned Jackson into\r\ncourt to show why he should not be held in contempt. Beyond a blanket\r\nvindication of his acts, the General would not plead. \"I will not\r\nanswer interrogatories,\" he declared. \"I may have erred, but my motives\r\ncannot be misinterpreted.\" The judge thereupon imposed a fine of one\r\nthousand dollars, the only question being, he declared, \"whether the\r\nLaw should bend to the General or the General to the Law.\" Jackson\r\naccepted the sentence with equanimity, and to a group of admirers who\r\ndrew him in a carriage from the court room to one of the leading\r\ncoffeehouses, he expressed lofty sentiments on the obligation of\r\ncitizens of every rank to obey the laws and uphold the courts.\r\nTwenty-nine years afterwards Congress voted reimbursement to the full\r\namount of the fine with interest.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks after the arrival of the treaty of peace Jackson\r\nlingered at New Orleans, haggling by day with the contractors and\r\nmerchants whose cotton, blankets, and bacon were yet to be paid for,\r\nand enjoying in the evening the festivities planned in his honor by\r\ngrateful citizens. His pleasure in the gala affairs of the time was\r\ndoubled by the presence of his wife, who one day arrived quite\r\nunexpectedly in the company of some Tennessee friends. Mrs. Jackson was\r\na typical frontier planter's wife--kind-hearted, sincere, benevolent,\r\nthrifty, pious, but unlettered and wholly innocent of polished manners.\r\nIn all her forty-eight years she had never seen a city more pretentious\r\nthan Nashville. She was, moreover, stout and florid, and it may be\r\nsupposed that in her rustic garb she was a somewhat conspicuous figure\r\namong the fashionable ladies of New Orleans society.\r\n\r\nBut the wife of Jackson's accomplished friend and future Secretary of\r\nState, Edward Livingston, fitted her out with fashionable clothes and\r\ntactfully instructed her in the niceties of etiquette, and ere long she\r\nwas able to demean herself, if not without a betrayal of her\r\nunfamiliarity with the environment, at all events to the complete\r\nsatisfaction of the General. The latter's devotion to his wife was a\r\nmatter of much comment. \"Debonair as he had been in his association\r\nwith the Creole belles, he never missed an opportunity to demonstrate\r\nthat he considered the short, stout, beaming matron at his side the\r\nperfection of her sex and far and away the most charming woman in the\r\nworld.\" π \"Aunt Rachel,\" as she was known throughout western Tennessee,\r\nlived to see the hero of New Orleans elected President, but not to\r\nshare with him the honors of the position. \"I have sometimes thought,\"\r\nsaid Thomas Hart Benton, \"that General Jackson might have been a more\r\nequable tenant of the White House than he was had she been spared to\r\nshare it with him. At all events, she was the only human being on earth\r\nwho ever possessed the power to swerve his mighty will or soothe his\r\nfierce temper.\"\r\n\r\nπ Buell, History of Andrew Jackson, Vol II, p. 97.\r\n\r\nShortly before their departure the Jacksons were guests of honor at a\r\ngrand ball at the Academy. The upper floor was arranged for dancing and\r\nthe lower for supper, and the entire building was aglow with flowers,\r\ncolored lamps, and transparencies. As the evening wore on and the\r\ndances of polite society had their due turn, the General finally avowed\r\nthat he and his bonny wife would show the proud city folk what real\r\ndancing was. A somewhat cynical observer--a certain Nolte, whom Jackson\r\nhad just forced to his own terms in a settlement for war\r\nsupplies--records his impression as follows: \"After supper we were\r\ntreated to a most delicious pas de deux by the conqueror and his\r\nspouse. To see these two figures, the General, a long haggard man, with\r\nlimbs like a skeleton, and Madame la GÈnÈrale, a short fat dumpling,\r\nbobbing opposite each other like half-drunken Indians, to the wild\r\nmelody of Possum up de Gum Tree, and endeavoring to make a spring into\r\nthe air, was very remarkable, and far more edifying a spectacle than\r\nany European ballet could possibly have furnished.\" But Jackson was\r\nonly less proud of his accomplishments as a dancer than as a fighter,\r\nand it was the part of discretion for a man of Nolte's critical turn to\r\nkeep a straight face on this occasion.\r\n\r\nIn early April the General and his wife started homeward, the latter\r\nbearing as a parting gift from the women of New Orleans the somewhat\r\ngaudy set of topaz jewelry which she wears in her most familiar\r\nportrait. The trip was a continuous ovation, and at Nashville a series\r\nof festivities wound up with a banquet attended by the most\r\ndistinguished soldiers and citizens of Tennessee and presided over by\r\nthe Governor of the State. Other cities gave dinners, and legislatures\r\nvoted swords and addresses. A period of rest at the Hermitage was\r\ninterrupted in the autumn of 1815 by a horseback trip to Washington\r\nwhich involved a succession of dinners and receptions. But after a few\r\nmonths the much fÍted soldier was back at Nashville, ready, as he said,\r\nto \"resume the cultivation of that friendly intercourse with my friends\r\nand neighbors which has heretofore constituted so great a portion of my\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Jackson had talked over his actions at New Orleans with both the\r\nPresident and the Secretary of War, he had received, as he says, \"a\r\nchart blank,\" approving his \"whole proceedings\"; so he had nothing\r\nfurther to worry about on that score. The national army had been\r\nreorganized on a peace footing, in two divisions, each under command of\r\na major general. The northern division fell to Jacob Brown of New York,\r\nthe hero of Lundy's Lane; the southern fell to Jackson, with\r\nheadquarters at Nashville.\r\n\r\nJackson was the last man to suppose that warfare in the southern half\r\nof the United States was a thing of the past. He knew that the late\r\ncontest had left the southern Indians restless and that the existing\r\ntreaties were likely to be repudiated at any moment. Florida was still\r\nin the hands of the Spaniards, and he had never a doubt that some day\r\nthis territory would have to be conquered and annexed. Moreover Jackson\r\nbelieved for some years after 1815, according to General Eaton, that\r\nGreat Britain would again make war on the United States, using Florida\r\nas a base. At all events, it can have caused the General no\r\nsurprise--or regret--to be called again into active service on the\r\nFlorida border before the close of 1817.\r\n\r\nThe hold of the Spaniards upon Florida had been so far weakened by the\r\nWar of 1812 that after the restoration of peace they occupied only\r\nthree important points--Pensacola, St. Marks, and St. Augustine. The\r\nrest of the territory became a No Man's Land, an ideal resort for\r\ndesperate adventurers of every race and description. There was a\r\nconsiderable Indian population, consisting mainly of Seminoles, a tribe\r\nbelonging to the Creek Confederacy, together with other Creeks who had\r\nfled across the border to escape the vengeance of Jackson at Tohopeka.\r\nAll were bitterly hostile to the United States. There were Spanish\r\nfreebooters, Irish roustabouts, Scotch free lances, and runaway\r\nslaves--a nondescript lot, and all ready for any undertaking that\r\npromised excitement, revenge, or booty. Furthermore there were some\r\nBritish soldiers who had remained on their own responsibility after the\r\ntroops were withdrawn. The leading spirit among these was Colonel\r\nEdward Nicholls, who had already made himself obnoxious to the United\r\nStates by his conduct at Pensacola.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war Nicholls and his men built a fort on the\r\nApalachicola, fifteen miles from the Gulf, and began again to collect\r\nand organize fugitive slaves, Indians, and adventurers of every sort,\r\nwhom they employed on raids into the territory of the United States and\r\nin attacks upon its inhabitants. The Creeks were falsely informed that\r\nin the Treaty of Ghent the United States had promised to give up all\r\nlands taken from them during the late war, and they were thus incited\r\nto rise in vindication of their alleged rights. What Nicholls was\r\naiming at came out when, in company with several chieftains, he\r\nreturned to England to ask for an alliance between the \"mother country\"\r\nand his buccaneer state. He met no encouragement, however, and in reply\r\nto an American protest the British Government repudiated his arts. His\r\nrÙle was nevertheless promptly taken up by a misguided Scotch trader,\r\nAlexander Arbuthnot, and the reign of lawlessness continued.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was Spain's business to keep order on the frontier; and\r\nthe United States waited a year and a half for the Madrid Government to\r\ngive evidence of intent to do so. But, as nothing but vain promises\r\nwere forthcoming, some American troops engaged in building a fort on\r\nthe Apalachicola, just north of the boundary line, marched down the\r\nriver in July, 1816, bombarded Nicholls's Negro Fort, blew up its\r\nmagazine, and practically exterminated the Negro and Indian garrison. A\r\nmenace to the slave property of southern Georgia was thus removed, but\r\nthe bigger problem remained. The Seminoles were restive; the refugee\r\nCreeks kept up their forays across the border; and the rich lands\r\nacquired by the Treaty of Fort Jackson were fast filling with white\r\nsettlers who clamored for protection. Though the Monroe Administration\r\nhad opened negotiations for the cession of the whole Florida country to\r\nthe United States, progress was slow and the outcome doubtful.\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head in the closing weeks of 1817. General Gaines,\r\nwho was in command on the Florida border, had tried repeatedly to get\r\nan interview with the principal \"Red Stick\" chieftain, but all of his\r\novertures had been repulsed. Finally he sent a detachment of soldiers\r\nto conduct the dignitary and his warriors from their village at\r\nFowltown, on the American side of the line, to a designated parley\r\nground. In no mood for negotiation, the chief ordered his followers to\r\nfire on the visitors; whereupon the latter seized and destroyed the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe fight at Fowltown may be regarded as the beginning of the Seminole\r\nWar. General Gaines was directed to begin operations against the\r\nIndians and to pursue them if necessary into East Florida; but before\r\nhe could carry out his orders, Jackson was put in personal command of\r\nthe forces acting against the Indians and was instructed to concentrate\r\nall of the troops in his department at Fort Scott and to obtain from\r\nthe Governors of Georgia and Tennessee such other assistance as he\r\nshould need.\r\n\r\nJackson received his orders at the Hermitage. Governor Blount was\r\nabsent from Nashville, but the eager commander went ahead raising\r\ntroops on his own responsibility. Nothing was so certain to whet his\r\nappetite for action as the prospect of a war in Florida. Not only did\r\nhis instructions authorize him to pursue the enemy, under certain\r\nconditions, into Spanish territory, but from the first he himself\r\nconceived of the enterprise as decidedly more than a punitive\r\nexpedition. The United States wanted Florida and was at the moment\r\ntrying to induce Spain to give it up. Here was the chance to take it\r\nregardless of Spain. \"Let it be signified to me through any channel\r\n(say Mr. J. Rhea),\" wrote the Major General to the President, \"that the\r\npossession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and\r\nin sixty days it will be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"Rhea letter\" became the innocent source of one of the most famous\r\ncontroversies in American history. Jackson supposed that the\r\ncommunication had been promptly delivered to Monroe, and that his plan\r\nfor the conquest of Florida had the full, if secret, approval of the\r\nAdministration. Instructions from the Secretary of War, Calhoun, seemed\r\nsusceptible of no other interpretation; besides, the conqueror\r\nsubsequently maintained that he received through Rhea the assurance\r\nthat he coveted. Monroe, however, later denied flatly that he had given\r\nany orders of the kind. Indeed he said that through a peculiar\r\ncombination of circumstances he had not even read Jackson's letter\r\nuntil long after the Florida campaign was ended. Each man, no doubt,\r\nthought he was telling the truth, and historians will probably always\r\ndiffer upon the merits of the case. The one thing that is perfectly\r\ncertain is that Jackson, when he carried his troops into Florida in\r\n1818, believed that the Government expected him to prepare the\r\nterritory for permanent American occupation.\r\n\r\nIn early March, Jackson was at Fort Scott, on the Georgia frontier,\r\nwith about two thousand men. Though he expected other forces, Jackson\r\nfound that scarcity of rations made it inadvisable to wait for them,\r\nand he therefore marched his army on as rapidly as possible down the\r\nsoggy bank of the Apalachicola, past the ruins of Negro Fort, into\r\nFlorida, where he found in readiness the provisions which had been sent\r\nforward by way of Mobile. Turning eastward, Jackson bore down upon the\r\nSpanish settlement of St. Marks, where it was rumored that the hostile\r\nnatives had assembled in considerable numbers. A small fleet of\r\ngunboats from Mobile and New Orleans was ordered to move along the\r\ncoast and intercept any fugitives, \"white, red, or black.\" Upwards of\r\ntwo thousand friendly Indians joined the land expedition, and the\r\ninvasion became from a military standpoint a sheer farce. The Seminoles\r\nwere utterly unprepared for war, and their villages were taken\r\npossession of, one by one, without opposition. At St. Marks the Indians\r\nfled precipitately, and the little Spanish garrison, after a glimpse of\r\nthe investing force, asked only that receipts be given for the movable\r\nproperty confiscated. The Seminole War was over almost before it was\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nBut Jackson was not in Florida simply to quell the Seminoles. He was\r\nthere to vindicate the honor and establish the sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States. Hence there was further work for him to do. The British\r\ninstigators of lawlessness were to be apprehended; the surviving\r\nevidences of Spanish authority were to be obliterated. Both objects\r\nJackson attained with characteristic speed and thoroughness. At St.\r\nMarks he made Arbuthnot a prisoner; at Suwanee he captured another\r\nmeddler by the name of Ambrister; and after a court-martial he hanged\r\none and shot the other in the presence of the chieftains whom these men\r\nhad deceived into thinking that Great Britain stood ready to come to\r\nthe red man's relief. Two Indian chiefs who were considered ringleaders\r\nhe likewise executed. Then, leaving St. Marks in the possession of two\r\nhundred troops, Jackson advanced upon Pensacola, the main seat of\r\nSpanish authority in the colony.\r\n\r\nFrom the Governor, Don JosÈ Callava, now came a dignified note of\r\nprotest; but the invader's only reply was an announcement of his\r\npurpose to take possession of the town, on the ground that its\r\npopulation had encouraged the Indians and given them supplies. On May\r\n24, 1818, the American forces and their allies marched in, unopposed,\r\nand the commander coolly apprised Callava that he would \"assume the\r\ngovernment until the transaction can be amicably adjusted by the two\r\ngovernments.\" \"If, contrary to my hopes,\" responded the Spanish\r\ndignitary, \"Your Excellency should persist in your intention to occupy\r\nthis fortress, which I am resolved to defend to the last extremity, I\r\nshall repel force by force; and he who resists aggression can never be\r\nconsidered an aggressor. God preserve Your Excellency many years.\" To\r\nwhich Jackson replied that \"resistance would be a wanton sacrifice of\r\nblood,\" and that he could not but remark on the Governor's\r\ninconsistency in presuming himself capable of repelling an army which\r\nhad conquered Indian tribes admittedly too powerful for the Spaniards\r\nto control.\r\n\r\nWhen the Americans approached the fort in which Callava had taken\r\nrefuge, they were received with a volley which they answered, as\r\nJackson tells us, with \"a nine-pound piece and five eight-inch\r\nhowitzers.\" The Spaniards, whose only purpose was to make a decent show\r\nof defending the place, then ran up the white flag and were allowed to\r\nmarch out with the honors of war. The victor sent the Governor and\r\nsoldiery off to Havana, installed a United States collector of customs,\r\nstationed a United States garrison in the fort, and on the following\r\nday set out on his way to Tennessee.\r\n\r\nIn a five months' campaign Jackson had established peace on the border,\r\nhad broken the power of the hostile Indians, and had substantially\r\nconquered Florida. Not a white man in his army had been killed in\r\nbattle, and not even the most extravagant eulogist could aver that the\r\nwar had been a great military triumph. None the less, the\r\npeople--especially in the West and South--were intensely pleased. Life\r\nin the frontier regions would now be safer; and the acquisition of the\r\ncoveted Florida country was brought appreciably nearer. The popular\r\nsentiment on the latter subject found characteristic expression in a\r\ntoast at a banquet given at Nashville in honor of the returning\r\nconqueror: \"Pensacola--Spanish perfidy and Indian barbarity rendered\r\nits capture necessary. May our Government never surrender it from the\r\nfear of war!\"\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough for Jackson to \"take\" Florida and for the people to\r\nrejoice in the exploit. To defend or explain away the irregular\r\nfeatures of the act was, however, quite a different matter; and that\r\nwas the task which fell to the authorities at Washington. \"The\r\nterritory of a friendly power had been invaded, its officers deposed,\r\nits towns and fortresses taken possession of; two citizens of another\r\nfriendly and powerful nation had been executed in scandalously summary\r\nfashion, upon suspicion rather than evidence.\" The Spanish Minister,\r\nOnis, wrathfully protested to the Secretary of State and demanded that\r\nJackson be punished; while from London Rush quoted Castlereagh as\r\nsaying that English feeling was so wrought up that war could be\r\nproduced by the raising of a finger.\r\n\r\nMonroe and his Cabinet were therefore given many anxious days and\r\nsleepless nights. They wanted to buy Florida, not conquer it. They had\r\nentertained no thought of authorizing the things that Jackson had done.\r\nThey recognized that the Tennesseean's crude notions of international\r\nlaw could not be upheld in dealings with proud European States. Yet it\r\nwas borne in upon them from every side that the nation approved what\r\nhad been done; and the politically ambitious might well think twice\r\nbefore casting any slur upon the acts of the people's hero. Moreover\r\nthe irascibility of the conqueror himself was known and feared.\r\nCalhoun, the Secretary of War, who was specially annoyed because his\r\ninstructions had not been followed, favored a public censure. On the\r\nother hand, John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State, took the ground\r\nthat everything that Jackson had done was \"defensive and incident to\r\nhis main duty to crush the Seminoles.\" The Administration finally\r\nreached the decision to surrender the posts but otherwise to back up\r\nthe General, in the hope of convincing Spain of the futility of trying\r\nlonger to hold Florida. Monroe explained the necessities of the\r\nsituation to Jackson as tactfully as he could, leaving him under the\r\nimpression--which was corrected only in 1830--that Crawford, rather\r\nthan Calhoun, was the member of the Cabinet who had held out against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut the controversy spread beyond the Cabinet circle. During the winter\r\nof 1818-19 Congress took it up, and a determined effort was made to\r\ncarry a vote of censure. The debate in the House--with galleries\r\ncrowded to suffocation, we are informed by the National\r\nIntelligencer--lasted four weeks and was notable for bringing Clay for\r\nthe first time publicly into opposition to the Tenneseean. The\r\nresolutions containing the censure were voted down, however, by a\r\nmajority of almost two to one. In the Senate a select committee, after\r\na laborious investigation, brought in an unfavorable report, but no\r\nfurther action was taken.\r\n\r\nWhen the discussion in Congress was at its height, Jackson himself\r\nappeared in Washington. Certain friends at the capital, fearing that\r\nhis outbursts of temper would prejudice his case, urged him to remain\r\nat home, but others assured him that his presence was needed. To his\r\nneighbor, Major Lewis, Jackson confided: \"A lot of d------d rascals,\r\nwith Clay at their head--and maybe with Adams in the rear-guard--are\r\nsetting up a conspiracy against me. I'm going there to see it out with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nUntil vindicated by the House vote, he remained quietly in his hotel.\r\nAfter that he felt free to pay and receive calls, attend dinners, and\r\naccept the tokens of regard which were showered upon him. It was now\r\nthat he paid his first visit to a number of the larger eastern cities.\r\nPhiladelphia fÍed him four days. In New York the freedom of the city\r\nwas presented by the mayor on a delicately inscribed parchment enclosed\r\nin a gold box, and Tammany gave a great dinner at which the leading\r\nguest, to the dismay of the young Van Buren and other supporters of\r\nCrawford, toasted DeWitt Clinton, the leader of the opposing Republican\r\nfaction. At Baltimore there was a dinner, and the city council asked\r\nthe visitor to sit for a picture by Peale for the adornment of the\r\ncouncil room. Here the General was handed a copy of the Senate\r\ncommittee's report, abounding in strictures on his Seminole campaign.\r\nHastening back to Washington, he filled the air with threats, and was\r\nnarrowly prevented from personally assaulting a member of the\r\ninvestigating committee. When, however, it appeared that the report was\r\nto be allowed to repose for all time on the table, Jackson's\r\nindignation cooled, and soon he was on his way back to Tennessee. With\r\nhim went the news that Adams and Onis had signed a treaty of \"amity,\r\nsettlements, and limits,\" whereby for a consideration of five million\r\ndollars the sovereignty of all Florida was transferred to the United\r\nStates. This treaty, as Jackson viewed it, was the crowning vindication\r\nof the acts which had been called in question; and public sentiment\r\nagreed with him.\r\n\r\nDilatory tactics on the part of the Madrid Government delayed the\r\nactual transfer of the territory more than two years. After having\r\ntwice refused, Jackson at length accepted the governorship of Florida,\r\nand in the early summer of 1821 he set out, by way of New Orleans, for\r\nhis new post. Mrs. Jackson went with him, although she had no liking\r\nfor either the territory or its people. On the morning of the 17th of\r\nJuly the formal transfer took place. A procession was formed,\r\nconsisting of such American soldiers as were on the spot. A ship's band\r\nbriskly played The Star Spangled Banner and the new Governor rode\r\nproudly at the fore as the procession moved along Main Street to the\r\ngovernment house, where ex-Governor Callava with his staff was in\r\nwaiting. The Spanish flag was hauled down, the American was run up, the\r\nkeys were handed over, and the remaining members of the garrison were\r\nsent off to the vessels which on the morrow were to bear them on their\r\nway to Cuba. Only Callava and a few other officials and merchants\r\nstayed behind to close up matters of public and private business.\r\n\r\nJackson's governorship was brief and stormy. In the first place, he had\r\nno taste for administrative routine, and he found no such opportunity\r\nas he had hoped for to confer favors upon his friends. \"I am sure our\r\nstay here will not be long,\" wrote Mrs. Jackson to a brother in early\r\nAugust. \"This office does not suit my husband. . . . There never was a\r\nman more disappointed than he has been. He has not the power to appoint\r\none of his friends.\" In the second place, the new Governor's status was\r\nwholly anomalous, since Congress had extended to the territory only the\r\nrevenue and anti-slave-trade laws, leaving Jackson to exercise in other\r\nmatters the rather vague powers of the captain general of Cuba and of\r\nthe Spanish governors of the Floridas. And in the third place, before\r\nhis first twenty-four hours were up, the new executive fell into a\r\ndesperate quarrel with his predecessor, a man of sufficiently similar\r\ntemperament to make the contest a source of sport for the gods.\r\n\r\nJackson was prepared to believe the worst of any Spaniard, and his\r\nrelations with Callava grew steadily more strained until finally, with\r\na view to obtaining possession of certain deeds and other legal papers,\r\nhe had the irate dignitary shut up overnight in the calaboose. Then he\r\nfell upon the judge of the Western District of Florida for issuing a\r\nwrit of habeas corpus in the Spaniard's behalf; and all\r\nparties--Jackson, Callava, and the judge--swamped the wearied officials\r\nat Washington with \"statements\" and \"exhibitions\" setting forth in\r\nlurid phraseology their respective views upon the questions involved.\r\nCallava finally carried his complaints to the capital in person and\r\nstirred the Spanish Minister to a fresh bombardment of the White House.\r\nMonroe's Cabinet spent three days discussing the subject, without\r\ncoming to a decision. Many were in honest doubt as to the principles of\r\nlaw involved; some were fearful of the political effects of any stand\r\nthey might take; all were inexpressibly relieved when, late in the\r\nyear, word came that \"Don Andrew Jackson\" had resigned the governorship\r\nand was proposing to retire to private life at the Hermitage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE DEATH OF \"KING CAUCUS\"\r\n\r\nOn a bracing November afternoon in 1821 Jackson rode up with his family\r\nto the Hermitage free for the first time in thirty-two years from all\r\nresponsibility of civil and military office. He was now fifty-four\r\nyears old and much broken by exposure and disease; the prospect of\r\nspending the remainder of his days among his hospitable neighbors on\r\nthe banks of the Cumberland yielded deep satisfaction. The home-loving\r\nMrs. Jackson, too, earnestly desired that he should not again be drawn\r\ninto the swirl of public life. \"I do hope,\" she wrote plaintively to a\r\nniece soon after her return to the Hermitage, \"they will leave Mr.\r\nJackson alone. He is not a well man and never will be unless they allow\r\nhim to rest. He has done his share for the country. How little time has\r\nhe had to himself or for his own interests in the thirty years of our\r\nwedded life. In all that time he has not spent one-fourth of his days\r\nunder his own roof. The rest of the time away, traveling, holding\r\ncourt, or at the capital of the country, or in camp, or fighting its\r\nbattles, or treating with the Indians; mercy knows what not.\"\r\n\r\nThe intent to retire was honest enough but not so easy to carry out.\r\nThe conqueror of the Creeks and Seminoles belonged not merely to\r\nTennessee but to the entire Southwest; the victor of New Orleans\r\nbelonged to the Nation. Already there was talk--\"talk everlastingly,\"\r\nMrs. Jackson tells us in the letter just quoted--of making the hero\r\nPresident. Jackson, furthermore, was not the type of man to sit idly by\r\nwhile great scenes were enacted on the political stage. When he\r\nreturned from Florida, he faced the future with the weary vision of a\r\nsick man. Rest and reviving strength, however, put the old vim into his\r\nwords and acts. In two years he was a second time taking a seat in the\r\nUnited States Senate, in three he was contesting for the presidency,\r\nand in seven he was moving into the White House.\r\n\r\nThe glimpses which one gets of the General's surroundings and habits\r\nduring his brief interval of repose create a pleasing impression.\r\nFollowing the winding turnpike westward from Nashville a distance of\r\nnine or ten miles and rumbling across the old wooden bridge over Stone\r\nRiver, a visitor would find himself at Hermitage Farm. The estate\r\ncontained at that time somewhat more than a thousand acres, of which\r\nfour hundred were under cultivation and the remainder luxuriant forest.\r\nNegro cabins stood here and there, and in one corner was a little brick\r\nchurch which the proprietor had built for the solace of his wife. In\r\nthe center of a well-kept lawn, flanked with cedars and oaks, stood the\r\nfamily mansion, the Hermitage, whose construction had been begun at the\r\nclose of the Seminole War in 1819. The building was of brick, two\r\nstories high, with a double wooden piazza in both front and rear. The\r\nrooms were small and simply furnished, the chief adornment being\r\nportraits of the General and his friends, though later was added the\r\nfamiliar painting of Mrs. Jackson. Lavasseur, who as private secretary\r\nof La Fayette visited the place in 1825, was greatly surprised to find\r\na person of Jackson's renown living in a structure which in France\r\nwould hardly suffice for the porter's lodge at the ch‚teau of a man of\r\nsimilar standing. But western Tennessee afforded nothing finer, and\r\nJackson considered himself palatially housed.\r\n\r\nLife on the Hermitage estate had its full share of the charm of the old\r\nSouth. After breakfasting at eight or nine, the proprietor spent the\r\nday riding over his broad acres, giving instructions to his workmen,\r\nkeeping up his accounts, chatting with neighbors and passers-by, and\r\ndevouring the newspapers with a zeal born of unremitting interest in\r\npublic affairs. After the evening meal the family gathered on the cool\r\npiazza in summer, or around the blazing hearth of the great living room\r\nin winter, and spent the hours until the early bedtime in telling\r\nstories, discussing local and national happenings, or listening to the\r\nnews of distant localities as retailed by the casual visitor. The\r\nhospitality of the Jackson home was proverbial. The General's army\r\nfriends came often to see him. Political leaders and advisers flocked\r\nto the place. Clergymen of all denominations were received with special\r\nwarmth by Mrs. Jackson. Eastern men of distinction, when traveling to\r\nthe West, came to pay their respects. No foreigner who penetrated as\r\nfar as the Mississippi Valley would think of returning to his native\r\nland without calling upon the picturesque figure at the Hermitage.\r\n\r\nChief among visitors from abroad was La Fayette. The two men met in\r\nWashington in 1824 and formed an instant attachment for each other. The\r\ngreat French patriot was greeted at Nashville the following year with a\r\npublic reception and banquet at which Jackson, as the first citizen of\r\nthe State, did the honors. Afterwards he spent some days in the Jackson\r\nhome, and one can imagine the avidity with which the two men discussed\r\nthe American and French revolutions, Napoleon, and the late New Orleans\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nJackson was first and last a democrat. He never lost touch with the\r\ncommonest people. Nevertheless there was always something of the grand\r\nmanner about him. On formal and ceremonial occasions he bore himself\r\nwith becoming dignity and even grace; in dress he was, as a rule,\r\npunctilious. During his years at the Hermitage he was accustomed to\r\nride about in a carriage drawn by four spirited iron-gray horses,\r\nattended by servants in blue livery with brass buttons, glazed hats,\r\nand silver bands. \"A very big man, sir,\" declared an old hotel waiter\r\nto the visiting biographer Parton long afterwards. \"We had many big\r\nmen, sir, in Nashville at that time, but General Jackson was the\r\nbiggest man of them all. I knew the General, sir; but he always had so\r\nmany people around him when he came to town that it was not often I\r\ncould get a chance to say anything to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe question as to who first proposed Jackson for the presidency will\r\nprobably never be answered. The victory at New Orleans evidently\r\nbrought the idea into many minds. As the campaign of 1816 was\r\nbeginning, Aaron Burr wrote to his son-in-law that, if the country\r\nwanted a President of firmness and decision, \"that man is Andrew\r\nJackson.\" Not apparently until 1821 was the suggestion put forward in\r\nsuch a way as to lead Jackson himself to take note of it. Even then he\r\nscoffed at it. To a friend who assured him that he was not \"safe from\r\nthe presidency\" in 1824, he replied: \"I really hope you don't think\r\nthat I am d------ fool enough to believe that. No sir; I may be pretty\r\nwell satisfied with myself in some things, but am not vain enough for\r\nthat.\" On another occasion he declared: \"No sir; I know what I am fit\r\nfor. I can command a body of men in a rough way; but I am not fit to be\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\nIt really mattered little what the General himself thought. His\r\nTennessee friends had conceived the idea that he could be elected, and\r\nalready they were at work to realize this vision. One of the most\r\nactive was John H. Eaton, who had lately written the hero's biography\r\ndown to the return from New Orleans. Another of his friends was\r\nGovernor Blount. John Rhea, Felix Grundy, and half a dozen more helped.\r\nBut the man who really made Jackson President was his near neighbor and\r\nhis inseparable companion of later years, William B. Lewis.\r\n\r\nIn a day of astute politicians Major Lewis was one of the cleverest. He\r\nknew Jackson more intimately than did any other man and could sway him\r\nreadily to his purposes in all matters upon which the General's mind\r\nwas not absolutely made up. He had a wide acquaintance over the\r\ncountry; he was possessed of ample means and leisure; he was an adept\r\nat pulling judiciously laid and well-concealed political wires; he\r\nfully understood the ideas, aspirations, and feelings of the classes\r\nwhose support was necessary to the success of his plans. In the present\r\njuncture he worked on two main lines: first, to arouse Jackson's own\r\nState to a feverish enthusiasm for the candidacy of its \"favorite son,\"\r\nand, second, to start apparently spontaneous Jackson movements in\r\nvarious sections of the country, in such a manner that their cumulative\r\neffect would be to create an impression of a nation-wide and\r\nirresistible demand for the victor of New Orleans as a candidate.\r\n\r\nTennessee was easily stirred. That the General merited the highest\r\nhonor within the gift of the people required no argument among his\r\nfellow citizens. The first open steps were taken in January, 1822, when\r\nthe Gazette and other Nashville papers sounded the clarion call. The\r\nresponse was overwhelming; and when Jackson himself, in reply to a\r\nletter from Grundy, diplomatically declared that he would \"neither seek\r\nnor shun\" the presidency, his candidacy was regarded as an established\r\nfact. On the 20th of July, the Legislature of the State placed him\r\nformally in nomination. Meanwhile Lewis had gone to North Carolina to\r\nwork up sentiment there, and by the close of the year assurances of\r\nsupport were coming in satisfactorily. From being skeptical or at best\r\nindifferent, Jackson himself had come to share the enthusiasm of his\r\nassiduous friends.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson managers banked from the first upon two main assets: one\r\nwas the exceptional popularity of their candidate, especially in the\r\nSouth and West; the other was a political situation so muddled that at\r\nthe coming election it might be made to yield almost any result. For\r\nupwards of a generation the presidency and vice presidency had been at\r\nthe disposal of a working alliance of Virginia and New York, buttressed\r\nby such support as was needed from other controllable States. Virginia\r\nregularly got the presidency, New York (except at the time of the\r\nClinton defection of 1812) the vice presidency. After the second\r\nelection of Monroe, in 1820, however, there were multiplying signs that\r\nthis affiliation of interests had reached the end of its tether. In the\r\nfirst place, the Virginia dynasty had run out; at all events Virginia\r\nhad no candidate to offer and was preparing to turn its support to a\r\nGeorgian of Virginian birth, William H. Crawford. In the second place,\r\nparty lines had totally disappeared, and the unifying and stabilizing\r\ninfluences of party names and affiliations could not be counted on to\r\nkeep down the number of independent candidacies. Already, indeed, by\r\nthe end of 1822 there were a half-dozen avowed candidates, three of\r\nwhom had seats at Monroe's Cabinet table. Each was the representative\r\nof a section or of a distinct interest, rather than of a party, and no\r\none was likely to feel under any compulsion to withdraw from the race\r\nat a preliminary stage.\r\n\r\nNew England offered John Quincy Adams. She did so with reluctance, for\r\nthe old Federalist elements had never forgiven him for his desertion to\r\nthe Republican camp in the days of the embargo, while the back country\r\ndemocracy had always looked upon him as an alien. But he was the\r\nsection's only available man--indeed, the only promising candidate from\r\nany Northern State. His frigid manner was against him. But he had had a\r\nlong and honorable diplomatic career; he was winning new distinction as\r\nSecretary of State; and he could expect to profit both by the feeling\r\nthat the North was entitled to the presidency and by the fact that he\r\nwas the only candidate from a non-slave State.\r\n\r\nCrawford, Secretary of the Treasury, was the heir apparent of the\r\nVirginia dynasty. Formerly this would have meant a clear road to the\r\nWhite House. Even now it was supposed to be a tremendous asset; and\r\nnotwithstanding the Georgian's personal unpopularity in most parts of\r\nthe country, his advantages as the \"regular candidate,\" coupled with\r\nthe long and careful campaign carried on in his behalf, were expected\r\nby many keen observers to pull him through.\r\n\r\nA third candidate within the Cabinet circle was Calhoun, Secretary of\r\nWar. Like Crawford, he could expect to reach the presidency only by\r\nwinning the support of one or more of the greater Northern States. For\r\na while he had hopes of Pennsylvania. When it appeared that he had\r\nnothing to look for in this direction, he resigned himself to the\r\nconclusion that, since he was yet hardly forty years of age, his time\r\nhad not yet come.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, the West now put forward candidates--two of them,\r\nClay and Jackson. Clay was a Kentuckian, of Virginian birth and\r\nbreeding, in whom were mingled the leading characteristics of both his\r\nnative and his adopted section. He was \"impetuous, wilful,\r\nhigh-spirited, daring, jealous, but, withal, a lovable man.\" For a\r\ndecade he had been the most conspicuous figure in the national House of\r\nRepresentatives. He had raised the speakership to a high level of\r\nimportance and through its power had fashioned a set of issues,\r\nreflective of western and middle-state ideas, upon which the politics\r\nof the country turned for more than a quarter of a century. As befitted\r\na \"great conciliator,\" he had admirers in every corner of the land.\r\nWhether his strength could be sufficiently massed to yield electoral\r\nresults remained to be discovered.\r\n\r\nBut what of Jackson? If, as one writer has said, Clay was one of the\r\nfavorites of the West, Jackson was the West itself. \"While Clay was\r\nable to voice, with statesmanlike ability, the demand for economic\r\nlegislation to promote her interests, and while he exercised an\r\nextraordinary fascination by his personal magnetism and his eloquence,\r\nhe never became the hero of the great masses of the West; he appealed\r\nrather to the more intelligent--to the men of business and of\r\nproperty.\" π Jackson, however, was the very personification of the\r\ncontentious, self-confident, nationalistic democracy of the interior.\r\nHe could make no claim to statesmanship. He had held no important\r\nlegislative or administrative position in his State, and his brief\r\ncareer in Congress was entirely without distinction. He was a man of\r\naction, not a theorist, and his views on public questions were, even as\r\nlate as 1820, not clear cut or widely known. In a general way he\r\nrepresented the school of Randolph and Monroe, rather than that of\r\nJefferson and Madison. He was a moderate protectionist, because he\r\nbelieved that domestic manufactures would make the United States\r\nindependent of European countries in time of war. On the Bank and\r\ninternal improvements his mind was not made up, although he was\r\ninclined to regard both as unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nπ Turner, Rise of the New West, p. 188.\r\n\r\nJackson's attitude toward the leading political personalities of the\r\ntime left no room for doubt. He supported Monroe in 1816 and in 1820\r\nand continued on friendly terms with him notwithstanding the\r\nPresident's failure on certain occasions to follow his advice. Among\r\nthe new contenders for the presidency the one he disliked most was\r\nCrawford. \"As to Wm. H. Crawford,\" he wrote to a friend in 1821, \"you\r\nknow my opinion. I would support the Devil first.\" Clay, also, he\r\ndisliked--partly out of recollection of the Kentuckian's censorious\r\nattitude during the Seminole debates, partly because of the natural\r\nrivalry between the two men for the favor of the western people. Clay\r\nfully reciprocated by refusing to believe that \"killing 2500 Englishmen\r\nat New Orleans\" qualified Jackson for the \"various difficult and\r\ncomplicated duties of the chief magistracy.\" Toward Adams, Jackson was\r\nnot ill disposed; before he decided to permit his own name to be used,\r\nhe said that he would give his support in 1824 to the New\r\nEnglander--unless one other person should be brought forward. That\r\nperson was Calhoun, for whom, among all the candidates of the day, he\r\nthus far had the warmest regard.\r\n\r\nAmong so many aspirants--and not all have been mentioned--how should\r\nthe people make up their minds? In earlier days the party caucuses in\r\nCongress would have eliminated various candidates, and the voters would\r\nhave found themselves called upon to make a choice between probably but\r\ntwo opponents. The caucus was an informal, voluntary gathering of the\r\nparty members in the two houses to canvass the political situation and\r\ndecide upon the men to be supported by the rank and file of the party\r\nfor the presidency and vice presidency. In the lack of other nominating\r\nmachinery it served a useful purpose, and nominations had been commonly\r\nmade in this manner from 1796 onwards. There were obvious objections to\r\nthe plan--chiefly that the authority exercised was assumed rather than\r\ndelegated--and, as the campaign of 1824 approached, opposition flared\r\nup in a very impressive manner.\r\n\r\nCrawford, as the \"regular\" candidate, wanted a caucus, and his\r\nadherents supported him in the wish. But all his rivals were opposed to\r\nit, partly because they felt that they could not gain a caucus\r\nnomination, partly because their followers generally objected to the\r\nsystem. \"King Caucus\" became the target of general criticism.\r\nNewspapers, except those for Crawford, denounced the old system;\r\nlegislatures passed resolutions against it; public meetings condemned\r\nit; ponderous pamphlets were hurled at it; the campaigns of Jackson and\r\nClay, in particular, found their keynote in hostility toward it.\r\nFailing to perceive that under the changed circumstances a caucus\r\nnomination might become a liability rather than an asset, the Crawford\r\nelement pushed its plans, and on February 14, 1824, a caucus--destined\r\nto be the last of the kind in the country--was duly held. It proved a\r\nfiasco, for it was attended by only sixty-six persons. Crawford was\r\n\"recommended to the people of the United States\" by an almost unanimous\r\nvote, but the only effect was to infuse fresh energy into the campaigns\r\nof his leading competitors. \"The caucus,\" wrote Daniel Webster to his\r\nbrother Ezekiel, \"has hurt nobody but its friends.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time in eight years the country witnessed a real\r\npresidential contest. The campaign, none the less, was one in which the\r\ncandidates themselves took but little active part. The days of\r\n\"swinging around the circle\" had not yet dawned in our national\r\npolitics, nor had even those of the \"front-porch\" campaign. Adams made\r\nno effort either to be nominated or to be elected, retaining throughout\r\nthe contest that austere reserve in public manner which contrasted so\r\nsingularly with his amiability and good humor in private life. Jackson\r\nremained quietly at the Hermitage, replying to correspondents and\r\nacknowledging expressions of support, but leaving to his managers the\r\nwork of winning the voters. Clay, whose oratorical gifts would have\r\nmade him an invincible twentieth century campaigner, contented himself\r\nwith a few interviews and speeches. The candidate who normally would\r\nhave taken most active personal part in the campaign was Crawford. But\r\nin August, 1823--six months before the caucus nomination--he was\r\nstricken with paralysis and rendered speechless, almost blind, and\r\npractically helpless. For months he hovered between life and death in a\r\n\"mansion\" on the outskirts of Washington, while his friends labored to\r\nconceal the seriousness of his condition and to keep his canvass going.\r\nGradually he rallied; but his powerful frame was shattered, and even\r\nwhen the caucus discharged its appointed task of nominating him, the\r\npoliticians were cold-heartedly speculating upon who would receive the\r\n\"old republican\" support if he should die. He recovered and lived ten\r\nyears; but his chances of the presidency were much diminished by his\r\nill fortune. \"He had fallen with his face toward the goal, with his\r\neyes and his heart fixed upon it.\"\r\n\r\nAs the canvass progressed, Jackson steadily gained. His election to the\r\nUnited States Senate, in the autumn of 1823, over a stanch supporter of\r\nCrawford showed that his own State was acting in good faith when it\r\nproposed him for the higher position. Clever propaganda turned\r\nPennsylvania \"Jackson mad\"; whereupon Calhoun, with an eye to the\r\nfuture, sought an alliance with his competitor. The upshot was that a\r\nconvention held at Harrisburg in March, 1824, nominated Jackson almost\r\nunanimously and named Calhoun for the vice presidency. Hostility to the\r\ncaucus became also a great asset. Tariff, internal improvements, and\r\nforeign policy were discussed in the campaign, but the real issue was\r\nthe manner of selecting the President. Should he continue to be chosen\r\nby a combination of Congressmen, or should the people take matters into\r\ntheir own hands? Impatience with the caucus system showed itself in\r\nnumerous nominations of Clay, Adams, and Jackson by sundry state\r\nconventions, legislatures, and other more or less official bodies. The\r\nsupporters of Jackson, in particular, made \"down with the caucus\" their\r\nrallying cry and found it tremendously effective. In the earlier stages\r\nof the campaign the politicians, aside from Lewis and his coworkers,\r\nwere unwilling to believe that Jackson could be elected. Later,\r\nhowever, they were forced to acknowledge his strength, and at the end\r\nthe fight was really between Jackson and the field, rather than between\r\nCrawford and the field as had been anticipated.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November, Jackson, accompanied by his wife and\r\ntraveling in a handsome coach drawn by four of the finest Hermitage\r\nthoroughbreds, set out for Washington. Hostile scribblers lost no time\r\nin contrasting this display of grandeur with the republican simplicity\r\nof Jefferson, who rode from Monticello to the capital on the back of a\r\nplantation nag without pedigree. But Jackson was not perturbed. At\r\nvarious points on the road he received returns from the elections, and\r\nwhen after four or five weeks the equipage drew up in the capital\r\nJackson knew the general result. Calhoun had been elected vice\r\npresident with little opposition. But no one of the presidential\r\ncandidates had obtained an electoral majority, and the task of choosing\r\namong the highest three would, under the terms of the Constitution,\r\ndevolve upon the House of Representatives. When, by the middle of\r\nDecember, the returns were all in, it was found that Jackson would have\r\n99 votes in the electoral college, Adams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay 37.\r\n\r\nThe country awaited the 9th of February--the day of the official\r\ncount--with great interest. Clay was, of course, eliminated. Crawford\r\nlikewise, by reason of his poor showing and the precarious state of his\r\nhealth, could not expect to do more than hold his own. The contest had\r\nnarrowed to Jackson and Adams, with Clay holding the balance. There\r\nwere twenty-four States in the Union; the successful candidate must\r\ncommand the votes of thirteen.\r\n\r\nThe choice that Clay now had to make was distasteful, although not\r\nreally difficult. Jackson had obtained a substantial plurality of the\r\nelectoral votes; he probably had a plurality of the popular vote,\r\nalthough in the six States in which the electors were chosen by the\r\nLegislature the popular vote could not be computed; the Legislature of\r\nClay's own State called upon the Congressmen from the State to give the\r\nTenneseean its support. But Clay had felt very bitterly about the\r\ncandidacy of \"this military chieftain.\" Furthermore, he knew that if\r\nJackson were to be elected, the country would not be disposed to take\r\nhis successor from the West. Besides, Calhoun had put himself in line\r\nfor the Jacksonian succession. On the other hand, Clay was not without\r\ngrievances against Adams. The New Englander had captured the coveted\r\nSecretaryship of State in Monroe's Cabinet; he had taken no pains to\r\nconceal his dislike of the Kentucky \"gamester in politics\"; his foreign\r\npolicy had been the target of many of Clay's keenest oratorical\r\nthrusts. But the country would be safe in his hands; and a popular\r\nwesterner might well hope to become his successor. The decision in\r\nfavor of Adams was reached with little delay and was confided to\r\nintimates almost two months before the House balloted. Though Clay's\r\nchoice did not insure the election of Adams, it made that outcome\r\nextremely probable.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks passed, the situation became more tense. All the\r\nprincipals in the drama were at the capital--Adams as Secretary of\r\nState, Crawford as Secretary of the Treasury, Clay as Speaker of the\r\nHouse, Jackson as Senator--and the city was filled with followers who\r\nbusied themselves in proposing combinations and making promises which,\r\nfor the greater part, could not be traced to the candidates themselves.\r\nO'Neil's Tavern--graced by the vivacious \"Peggy,\" who, as Mrs. John H.\r\nEaton, was later to upset the equilibrium of the Jackson\r\nAdministration--and other favorite lodging houses were the scenes of\r\nmidnight conferences, intimate conversations, and mysterious comings\r\nand goings which kept their oldest and most sophisticated frequenters\r\non the alert. \"Incedo super ignes--I walk over fires,\" confided the\r\nstraitlaced Adams to his diary, and not without reason. A group of\r\nClay's friends came to the New Englander's room to urge in somewhat\r\nveiled language that their chief be promised, in return for his\r\nsupport, a place in the Cabinet. A Missouri representative who held the\r\nbalance of power in his delegation plainly offered to swing the State\r\nfor Adams if the latter would agree to retain a brother on the federal\r\nbench and be \"reasonable\" in the matter of patronage.\r\n\r\nBy the last week of January it was rather generally understood that\r\nClay's strength would be thrown to Adams. Up to this time the Jackson\r\nmen had refused to believe that such a thing could happen. But evidence\r\nhad been piled mountain-high; adherents of both allies were openly\r\nboasting of the arrangements that had been made. The Jacksonians were\r\nfurious, and the air was filled with recriminations. On January 28,\r\n1825, an anonymous letter in the Columbian Observer of Philadelphia\r\nmade the direct charge that the agents of Clay had offered the\r\nKentuckian's support to both Jackson and Adams in return for an\r\nappointment as Secretary of State, and that, while the friends of\r\nJackson would not descend to \"such mean barter and sale,\" a bargain\r\nwith the Adams forces had been duly closed. Clay's rage was\r\nungovernable. Through the columns of the National Intelligencer he\r\npronounced his unknown antagonist \"a base and infamous calumniator, a\r\ndastard and a liar,\" called upon him to \"unveil himself,\" and declared\r\nthat he would hold him responsible \"to all the laws which govern and\r\nregulate men of honor.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later an obscure Pennsylvania Congressman by the name of\r\nGeorge Kremer tendered his respects to \"the Honorable H. Clay,\" avowed\r\nhis authorship of the communication in question, offered to prove the\r\ntruth of his charges, and closed sententiously by affirming that as a\r\nrepresentative of the people he would \"not fear to 'cry aloud and spare\r\nnot' when their rights and privileges are at stake.\" The matter was\r\nserious, but official Washington could hardly repress a smile. Kremer\r\nwas a thoroughly honest but grossly illiterate rustic busybody who thus\r\nfar had attracted the capital's attention mainly by reason of his\r\ncuriously cut leopard-skin overcoat. The real author of the charge\r\nseems to have been James Buchanan, and Kremer was simple-minded and\r\ncredulous enough to be made the catspaw in the business. Clay was taken\r\naback. Kremer significantly made no reference to the \"code of honor\";\r\nand since a duel with such a personage would be an absurdity, Clay\r\nsubstituted a request that the House make an immediate investigation of\r\nthe charges. A committee of seven was appointed. But when it summoned\r\nKremer to give his testimony, he refused to appear, on the\r\nground--which in the present instance was a mere pretext--that the\r\nHouse had no jurisdiction over the conduct of its members outside the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is that Kremer was only a tool in the hands of\r\nthe Jackson managers. He admitted privately to members of the committee\r\nthat he did not write the letter in the Observer, and it was plain\r\nenough that he did not understand its purport. His promise to\r\nsubstantiate its contents was made in a moment of surprise, because\r\nsomebody had neglected to coach him on the point. Finding that it could\r\nmake no headway, the committee reported the fact, on the 9th of\r\nFebruary, and the investigation was dropped. This was precisely what\r\nthe Jackson managers wanted. Whatever happened, Jackson would be the\r\ngainer. \"If Clay transferred his following to Adams, the charge would\r\ngain credence with the masses; if he were not made Secretary of State,\r\nit would be alleged that honest George Kremer (an ardent Jacksonian)\r\nhad exposed the bargain and prevented its consummation.\" π\r\n\r\nπ Turner, Rise of the New West, p. 208.\r\n\r\nWas this charge of a \"corrupt bargain\" well founded? For a generation\r\nevery public man had views on that subject for which he was ready to\r\nfight; mid-century and later historians came to conclusions of the most\r\ncontradictory nature. The pros and cons are too complicated to be\r\npresented here, but certain things are fairly clear. In two elaborate\r\nspeeches Clay marshaled evidence that before leaving Kentucky he\r\ndecided to support Adams in preference to Jackson and Crawford. This\r\nevidence did not convince the Jacksonians; but it could hardly have\r\nbeen expected to do so, and nowadays it looks to be unimpeachable. It\r\nis certain that the friends of Clay approached the Adams managers with\r\na view to a working agreement involving the Secretaryship of State; but\r\nit is equally clear that the Jackson and Crawford men solicited Clay's\r\nsupport \"by even more unblushing offers of political reward than those\r\nalleged against Adams.\" Finally it is known that Adams gave some\r\nexplicit preÎlection pledges, and that by doing so he drew some votes;\r\nbut on the subject of an alliance with Clay he is not known to have\r\ngone further than to say to a delegation of Clay supporters that if\r\nelected by western votes he would naturally look to the West for much\r\nof the support which his Administration would need.\r\n\r\nAt noon, on the 9th of February, the Senate and House met in joint\r\nsession to witness the count of the electoral vote. Spectators packed\r\nthe galleries and overflowed into every available space. The first acts\r\nwere of a purely formal nature. Then the envelopes were opened; the\r\nvotes were counted; Calhoun was declared elected to the vice\r\npresidency; and it was announced that no candidate for the presidency\r\nhad received a majority. Then the senators withdrew, and the\r\nrepresentatives addressed themselves to the task which the Constitution\r\ndevolved upon them. The members of each delegation took their seats\r\ntogether; the vote of each State was placed in a separate box on a\r\ntable; and Daniel Webster and John Randolph, acting as tellers, opened\r\nthe boxes and tabulated the results. No one expected the first ballot\r\nto be decisive; indeed the friends of Crawford, who were present in\r\nlarge numbers, were pinning their hopes to the possibility that after\r\nrepeated ballotings the House would break the deadlock between Jackson\r\nand Adams by turning to their candidate. A hush fell upon the expectant\r\nassemblage as Webster rose to announce the result; and seasoned\r\npoliticians could hardly trust their ears when they heard: Adams,\r\nthirteen votes; Jackson, seven; Crawford, four. An eleventh-hour change\r\nof mind by a New York representative had thrown the vote of that State\r\ninto the Adams column and had thereby assured the triumph of the New\r\nEnglander.\r\n\r\nThat evening Jackson and Adams came face to face at a presidential\r\nlevee, Jackson with a lady on his right arm. Each man hesitated an\r\ninstant, and spectators wondered what was going to happen. But those\r\nwho were looking for a sensation were disappointed. Reaching out his\r\nlong arm, the General said in his most cordial manner: \"How do you do,\r\nMr. Adams? I give you my left hand, for the right, as you see, is\r\ndevoted to the fair: I hope you are very well, sir.\" The reply came in\r\nclear but icy tones: \"Very well, sir; I hope General Jackson is well.\"\r\nIt is the testimony of an unprejudiced observer that of the two, the\r\ndefeated Tenneseean bore himself more graciously than the victorious\r\nNew Englander.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Adams, following a conference with Monroe, invited upon\r\nhis head the fires of heaven by announcing that he had decided to\r\nappoint Clay Secretary of State, \"considering it due to his talents and\r\nservices to the western section of the United States, whence he comes,\r\nand to the confidence in me manifested by their delegations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH\r\n\r\nMonroe's Administration drew to a close in a mellow sunset of popular\r\napproval. But no prophetic genius was required to foresee that clouds\r\nof discontent and controversy would hang heavy about the head of his\r\nsuccessor. Adams certainly did not expect it to be otherwise.\r\n\"Prospects are flattering for the immediate issue,\" he recorded in his\r\ndiary shortly before the election, \"but the fearful condition of them\r\nis that success would open to a far severer trial than defeat.\" The\r\ndarkest forebodings were more than realized. No one of our chief\r\nexecutives, except possibly Andrew Johnson, was ever the target of more\r\nrelentless and vindictive attacks.\r\n\r\nAdams was, in the first place, a minority President. Jackson's popular\r\nvote was probably larger; his electoral vote was certainly so; and the\r\nvote in the House of Representatives was at the last moment swung to\r\nAdams only by certain unexpected and more or less accidental\r\ndevelopments. By thus receiving his office at the hands of a branch of\r\nCongress, in competition with a candidate who had a wider popular\r\nsupport, the New Englander fell heir to all the indignation that had\r\nbeen aroused against congressional intrigue, and especially against the\r\nselection of a President by Congressmen.\r\n\r\nThere was, in addition, the charge of a \"corrupt bargain.\" It mattered\r\nnot greatly whether the accusation was true or not. The people widely\r\naccepted it as true, and the Administration had to bear the stigma.\r\n\"The coalition of Blifil and Black George, of the Puritan and the\r\nblack-leg,\" John Randolph called the new alliance; and while Clay\r\nsought to vindicate his honor in a duel with the author of the phrase,\r\nnothing that he or Adams could do or say was able to overcome the\r\neffect upon the public mind created by the cold fact that when the Clay\r\nmen turned their support to Adams their leader was forthwith made\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nA further source of difficulty in the situation was the temperament of\r\nAdams himself. There was no abler, more honest, or more patriotic man\r\nin public life; yet in the presidency he was, especially at this\r\njuncture of affairs, a misfit. He was cold and reserved when every\r\nconsideration called for cordiality; he was petulant when tolerance and\r\ngood humor were the qualities most needful. He could neither arouse\r\nenthusiasm nor win friends. He was large visioned and adept at mapping\r\nout broad policies, but he lacked the elements of leadership requisite\r\nto carry his plans into effect. He scorned the everyday arts of\r\npolitics, and by the very loftiness of his ideals he alienated support.\r\nIn short, as one writer has remarked, he was \"a weigher of scruples and\r\nvalues in a time of transition, a representative of old-school politics\r\non the threshold of triumphant democracy. The people did not understand\r\nhim, but they felt instinctively that he was not one of themselves;\r\nand, therefore, they cast him out.\" Nobody had ever called him \"Old\r\nHickory\" or any other name indicative of popular endearment.\r\n\r\nClay's appointment as Secretary of State was thoroughly typical of the\r\nindependent, unyielding attitude of the new Administration. Adams had\r\nnot the slightest sympathy with the idea of rotation in public\r\nposition: such a policy, he said, would make government \"a perpetual\r\nand unremitting scramble for office.\" He announced that there would be\r\nno removals except such as complaint showed to be for the good of the\r\nservice, and only twelve removals took place during his entire term.\r\nThe spoilsmen argued and fumed. The editor of an administration\r\nnewspaper warmly told the President that in consequence of his policy\r\nhe would himself be removed as soon as the term for which he had been\r\nelected had expired. But entreaties and threats were alike of no avail.\r\nEven Clay could not get the removal of a naval officer guilty of\r\nunbecoming conduct. In his zeal for nonpartizanship Adams fairly leaned\r\nbackwards, with the result that incompetents were shielded and the\r\noffices were left in the hands of men who, in a very large number of\r\ncases, were openly hostile to the President and to his policies.\r\n\r\n\"Less possessed of your confidence in advance than any of my\r\npredecessors,\" wrote Adams in his first message to Congress, \"I am\r\ndeeply conscious of the prospect that I shall stand more and oftener in\r\nneed of your indulgence.\" In the principles and measures which he urged\r\nupon the legislative branch, none the less, he showed small regard for\r\nmoderation or expediency. He defined the object of government to be the\r\nimprovement of the condition of the people, and he refused to recognize\r\nin the federal Constitution restrictions which would prevent the\r\nnational authorities from fulfilling this function in the highest\r\ndegree. He urged not only the building of roads and canals but the\r\nestablishment of a national university, the support of observatories,\r\n\"the light-houses of the skies,\" and the exploration of the interior\r\nand of the far northwestern parts of the country. He advocated heavy\r\nprotective duties on goods imported from abroad, and asked Congress to\r\npass laws not alone for the betterment of agriculture, manufactures,\r\nand trade but for the \"encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant\r\narts, the advancement of literature, and the progress of the sciences,\r\nornamental and profound.\" He thought that the public lands should be\r\nsold at the highest prices they would bring and that the money should\r\nbe used by the Government to promote the general welfare. He had no\r\ndoubt of either the power or the duty of the Government to maintain a\r\nnational bank.\r\n\r\nSince the War of 1812 the Republicans, with whom Adams had been\r\nnumbered, had inclined strongly toward a liberal construction of the\r\nConstitution, but none had gone to the limits marked out in this\r\nprogram. Besides, a strong reaction was now setting in. The President's\r\nrecommendations were received in some quarters with astonishment, in\r\nsome rather with amusement. Nowhere were they regarded, in their\r\nentirety, with favor. Even Clay--spokesman of nationalism though he\r\nwas--could not follow his chief in his untrammeled flights. Men still\r\nwidely believed that the National Government ought to spend money\r\nfreely on highways, canals, and other improvements. But by his bold\r\navowals Adams characteristically threw away support for both himself\r\nand his cause; and the era of federal initiative and management was\r\nthus hastened toward its close.\r\n\r\nNo one who knew Jackson and his political managers expected them to\r\naccept the anomalous electoral results of 1825 as expressing the real\r\nwill of the nation, and it was a foregone conclusion not only that the\r\nGeneral would again be a candidate, but that the campaign of 1828 would\r\nat once begin. The defeated Senator remained in Washington long enough\r\nto present himself at the White House on Inauguration Day and\r\nfelicitate his successful rival. Then he set out on the long journey\r\nhomeward. Every town through Pennsylvania and along the Ohio turned out\r\nen masse to greet him, and at Nashville he was given a prodigious\r\nreception. To friends and traveling companions he talked constantly\r\nabout the election, leaving no doubt of his conviction that he had been\r\ndefeated by intrigue. To a sympathetic group of passengers traveling\r\ndown the Ohio with him on board the General Neville he declared\r\nemphatically that, if he had been willing to make the same promises and\r\noffers to Clay that Adams had made, he would that minute be in the\r\npresidential chair. If he should yet attain that dignity, he added\r\nsignificantly, he would do it \"with clean hands.\" It is reported that\r\nas he spoke there was in his eye the fire of determination, such as his\r\nsoldiers had seen there as he strode up and down the breastworks at New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nTo this point Jackson had sought the presidency rather at the\r\ninstigation of his friends than because of personal desire for the\r\noffice. Now all was changed. The people had expressed their preference\r\nfor him, and their will had been thwarted. Henceforth he was moved by\r\nan inflexible purpose to vindicate both his own right to the position\r\nand the right of his fellow citizens to choose their chief executive\r\nwithout hindrance. In this determination he was warmly backed up by his\r\nneighbors and advisers, and the machinery for a long, systematic, and\r\nresistless campaign was speedily put into running order. One group of\r\nmanagers took charge in Washington. Another set to work in New York. A\r\nthird undertook to keep Pennsylvania in line. A fourth began to\r\nconsolidate support in the South. At the capital the United States\r\nTelegraph, edited by Duff Green of Missouri, was established as a\r\nJackson organ, and throughout the country friendly journals were set\r\nthe task of keeping up an incessant fire upon the Administration and of\r\nholding the Jackson men together. Local committees were organized;\r\npamphlets and handbills were put into circulation; receptions and\r\npublic dinners were exploited, whenever possible, in the interest of\r\nthe cause. First, last, and always, Jackson's candidacy was put forward\r\nas the hope and opportunity of the plain people as against the\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nIn October the Tennessee Legislature again placed its favorite formally\r\nin nomination, and a few days later the candidate resigned his seat in\r\nthe Senate in order to be more advantageously situated for carrying on\r\nhis campaign. For more than a year he remained quietly at the\r\nHermitage, dividing his attention between his blooded horses and dogs\r\nand his political interests. Lewis stayed at his side, partly to\r\nrestrain him from outbreaks of temper or other acts that might injure\r\nhis interests, partly to serve as an intermediary between him and the\r\nWashington manipulators.\r\n\r\nBefore Adams had been in the White House six months the country was\r\ndivided substantially into Jackson men and anti-Jackson or\r\nadministration men. The elements from which Jackson drew support were\r\nmany and discordant. The backbone of his strength was the\r\nself-assertive, ambitious western Democracy, which recognized in him\r\nits truest and most eminent representative. The alliance with the\r\nCalhoun forces was kept up, although it was already jeopardized by the\r\nfeeling of the South Carolinian's friends that they, and not Jackson's\r\nfriends, should lead in the coming campaign. After a good deal of\r\nhesitation the supporters of Crawford came over also. Van Buren\r\ncoquetted with the Adams forces for a year, and the old-line\r\nRepublicans, strong in the Jeffersonian faith, brought themselves to\r\nthe support of the Tenneseean with difficulty; but eventually both\r\nnorthern and southern wings of the Crawford contingent alined\r\nthemselves against the Administration. The decision of Van Buren\r\nbrought into the Jackson ranks a past master in party management, \"the\r\ncleverest politician in a State in which the sort of politics that is\r\nconcerned with the securing of elections rather than fighting for\r\nprinciples had grown into a science and an art.\" By 1826 the Jackson\r\nforces were welded into a substantial party, although for a long time\r\ntheir principles involved little more than hostility to Adams and\r\nenthusiasm for Jackson, and they bore no other designation than Jackson\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe elements that were left to support the Administration were the\r\nfollowers of Adams and Clay. These eventually drew together under the\r\nname of National Republicans. Their strength, however, was limited, for\r\nAdams could make no appeal to the masses, even in New England; while\r\nClay, by contributing to Jackson's defeat, had forfeited much of the\r\npopularity that would otherwise have been his.\r\n\r\nIf the story of Adams's Administration could be told in detail, it\r\nwould be one long record of rancorous warfare between the President and\r\nthe Jacksonian opposition in Congress. Adams, on the one hand, held\r\ninflexibly to his course, advocating policies and recommending measures\r\nwhich he knew had not the remotest chance of adoption; and, on the\r\nother hand, the opposition--which in the last two years of the\r\nAdministration controlled the Senate as well as the House of\r\nRepresentatives--balked at no act that would humiliate the President\r\nand make capital for its western idol. At the outset the Jacksonians\r\ntried to hold up the confirmation of Clay. It fell furiously, and quite\r\nwithout discrimination, upon the President's great scheme of national\r\nimprovements, professing to see in it evidence of an insatiable desire\r\nfor \"concentration.\" In the discussion of a proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution providing for direct election of the President by the\r\npeople it was constantly assumed and frequently stated that Adams had\r\nno moral right to the position which he occupied. The President's\r\ndecision to send delegates to the Panama Congress of 1826 raised a\r\nstorm of acrimonious debate and brought the Administration's enemies\r\ninto closer unison. To cap the climax, Adams was solemnly charged with\r\nabuse of the federal patronage, and in the Senate six bills for the\r\nremedy of the President's pernicious practices were brought in by\r\nBenton in a single batch! Adams was able and honest, but he got no\r\ncredit from his opponents for these qualities. He, in turn, displayed\r\nlittle magnanimity; and in refusing to shape his policies and methods\r\nto meet the conditions under which he had to work, he fell short of the\r\nhighest statesmanship.\r\n\r\nAs election year approached, it became clear that the people would at\r\nlast have an opportunity to make a direct choice between Adams and\r\nJackson. Each candidate was formally nominated by sundry legislatures\r\nand other bodies; no one so much as suggested nomination by\r\ncongressional caucus. In the early months of 1828 the campaign rapidly\r\nrose to an extraordinary level of vigor and public interest. Each party\r\ngroup became bitter and personal in its attacks upon the other; in our\r\nentire political history there have been not more than two or three\r\ncampaigns so smirched with vituperation and abuse. The Jackson papers\r\nand stump speakers laid great stress on Adams's aristocratic\r\ntemperament, denounced his policies as President, and exploited the\r\n\"corrupt bargain\" charge with all possible ingenuity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Adams-Clay forces dragged forth in long array\r\nJackson's quarrels, duels, and rough-and-tumble encounters to prove\r\nthat he was not fit to be President; they distributed handbills\r\ndecorated with coffins bearing the names of the candidate's victims;\r\nthey cited scores of actions, from the execution of mutinous militiamen\r\nin the Creek War to the quarrel with Callava, to show his arbitrary\r\ndisposition; and they strove in a most malicious manner to undermine\r\nhis popularity by breaking down his personal reputation, and even that\r\nof his wife and of his mother. It has been said that \"the reader of old\r\nnewspaper files and pamphlet collections of the Adamsite persuasion, in\r\nthe absence of other knowledge, would gather that Jackson was a\r\nusurper, an adulterer, a gambler, a cock-fighter, a brawler, a\r\ndrunkard, and withal a murderer of the most cruel and blood-thirsty\r\ndescription.\" Issues--tariff, internal improvements, foreign policy,\r\nslavery--receded into the background; the campaign became for all\r\npractical purposes a personal contest between the Tennessee soldier and\r\nthe two statesmen whom he accused of bargain and corruption. \"Hurrah\r\nfor Jackson!\" was the beginning and end of the creed of the masses bent\r\non the Tenneseean's election.\r\n\r\nJackson never wearied of saying that he was \"no politician.\" He was,\r\nnone the less, one of the most forceful and successful politicians that\r\nthe country has known. He was fortunate in being able to personify a\r\ncause which was grounded deeply in the feelings and opinions of the\r\npeople, and also in being able to command the services of a large group\r\nof tireless and skillful national and local managers. He was willing to\r\nleave to these managers the infinite details of his campaign. But he\r\nkept in close touch with them and their subordinates, and upon occasion\r\nhe did not hesitate to take personal command. In politics, as in war,\r\nhe was imperious; persons not willing to support him with all their\r\nmight, and without question or quibble, he preferred to see on the\r\nother side. Throughout the campaign his opponents hoped, and his\r\nfriends feared, that he would commit some deed of anger that would ruin\r\nhis chances of election. The temptation was strong, especially when the\r\ncircumstances of his marriage were dragged into the controversy. But\r\nwhile he chafed inwardly, and sometimes expressed himself with more\r\nforce than elegance in the presence of his friends, he maintained an\r\noutward calm and dignity. His bitterest feeling was reserved for Clay,\r\nwho was known to be the chief inspirer of the National Republicans'\r\nmud-slinging campaign. But he felt that Adams had it in his power to\r\nput a stop to the slanders that were set in circulation, had he cared\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign drew to a close, circumstances pointed with increasing\r\nsureness to the triumph of the Jackson forces. Adams, foreseeing the\r\nend, found solace in harsh and sometimes picturesque entries in his\r\ndiary. A group of opposition Congressmen he pronounced \"skunks of party\r\nslander.\" Calhoun he described as \"stimulated to frenzy by success,\r\nflattery, and premature advancement; governed by no steady principle,\r\nbut sagacious to seize upon every prevailing popular breeze to swell\r\nhis own sails.\" Clay, likewise, became petulant and gloomy. In the last\r\ntwo months of the canvass Jackson ordered a general onslaught upon\r\nKentucky, and when finally it was affirmed that the State had been\r\n\"carried out from under\" its accustomed master, Clay knew only too well\r\nthat the boast was true. To Adams's assurances that after four years of\r\nJackson the country would gladly turn to the Kentuckian, the latter\r\ncould only reply that there would, indeed, be a reaction, but that\r\nbefore another President would be taken from the West he would be too\r\nold; and it was with difficulty that Adams persuaded him not to retire\r\nimmediately from the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe results of the contest fully bore out the apprehensions of the\r\nAdministration. Jackson received nearly 140,000 more popular votes than\r\nAdams and carried every State south of the Potomac and west of the\r\nAlleghanies. He carried Pennsylvania also by a vote of two to one and\r\ndivided about equally with his opponent the votes of New York and\r\nMaryland. Only New England held fast for Adams. As one writer has\r\nfacetiously remarked, \"It took a New England conscience to hold a\r\nfollower in line for the New England candidate.\" The total electoral\r\nvote was 178 for Jackson and 83 for Adams. Calhoun was easily reÎlected\r\nto the vice presidency. Both branches of Congress remained under the\r\ncontrol of Jackson's partizans.\r\n\r\nMonths before the election, congratulatory messages began to pour into\r\nthe Hermitage. Some came from old friends and disinterested\r\nwell-wishers, many from prospective seekers of office or of other\r\nfavors. Influential people in the East, and especially at the capital,\r\nhastened to express their desire to be of service to the Jacksons in\r\nthe new life to which they were about to be called. In the list one\r\nnotes with interest the names of General Thomas Cadwalader of\r\nPhiladelphia, salaried lobbyist for the United States Bank, and Senator\r\nRobert Y. Hayne, the future South Carolina nullifier.\r\n\r\nReturns sufficiently complete to leave no doubt of Jackson's election\r\nreached the Hermitage on the 9th of December. That afternoon, Lewis,\r\nCarroll, and a few other members of the \"general headquarters staff\"\r\ngathered at the Jackson home to review the situation and look over the\r\nbulky correspondence that had come in. \"General Jackson,\" reports\r\nLewis, \"showed no elation. In fact, he had for some time considered his\r\nelection certain, the only question in his mind being the extent of the\r\nmajority. When he finished looking over the summary by States, his only\r\nremark was that Isaac Hill, considering the odds against him, had done\r\nwonders in New Hampshire!\"\r\n\r\nWhen, two weeks later, the final returns were received, leading\r\nTenneseeans decided to give a reception, banquet, and ball which would\r\noutshine any social occasion in the annals of the Southwest. Just as\r\narrangements were completed, however, Mrs. Jackson, who had long been\r\nin failing health, suffered an attack of heart trouble; and at the very\r\nhour when the General was to have been received, amid all the trappings\r\nof civil and military splendor, with the huzzas of his neighbors,\r\nfriends, and admirers, he was sitting tearless, speechless, and almost\r\nexpressionless by the corpse of his life companion. Long after the\r\nbeloved one had been laid to rest in the Hermitage garden amid the\r\nrosebushes she had planted, the President-elect continued as one\r\nbenumbed. He never gave up the idea that his wife had been killed by\r\nworry over the attacks made upon him and upon her by the Adams\r\nnewspapers--that, as he expressed it, she was \"murdered by slanders\r\nthat pierced her heart.\" Only under continued prodding from Lewis and\r\nother friends did he recall himself to his great task and set about\r\npreparing for the arduous winter journey to Washington, composing his\r\ninaugural address, selecting his Cabinet, and laying plans for the\r\nreorganization of the federal Civil Service on lines already definitely\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE \"REIGN\" BEGINS\r\n\r\nJackson's election to the presidency in 1828 was correctly described by\r\nSenator Benton as \"a triumph of democratic principle, and an assertion\r\nof the people's right to govern themselves.\" Jefferson in his day was a\r\ncandidate of the masses, and his triumph over John Adams in 1800 was\r\nreceived with great public acclaim. Yet the Virginian was at best an\r\naristocratic sort of democrat; he was never in the fullest sense a man\r\nof the people. Neither Madison nor Monroe inspired enthusiasm, and for\r\nJohn Quincy Adams even New Englanders voted, as Ezekiel Webster\r\nconfessed, from a cold sense of duty. Jackson was, as no President\r\nbefore him, the choice of the masses. His popular vote in 1824 revealed\r\nnot only his personal popularity but the growing power of the\r\ndemocratic elements in the nation, and his defeat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives only strengthened his own and the people's\r\ndetermination to be finally victorious. The untrained, self-willed,\r\npassionate frontier soldier came to power in 1828 as the standard\r\nbearer of a mighty democratic uprising which was destined before it ran\r\nits course to break down oligarchical party organizations, to\r\nliberalize state and local governments, and to turn the stream of\r\nnational politics into wholly new channels. It was futile for men of\r\nthe old school to protest and to prophesy misfortune for the country\r\nunder its new rulers. The people had spoken, and this time the people's\r\nwill was not to be denied.\r\n\r\nStill haggard from his recent personal loss, the President-elect set\r\nout for Washington, at the middle of January, 1829. With him went his\r\nnephew, Andrew Jackson Donelson, who was to be his private secretary;\r\nMrs. Donelson, who was to preside over the executive mansion; an\r\naccomplished niece of Mrs. Jackson, who was to be of social assistance;\r\nan artist by the name of Earl, who resided at the White House\r\nthroughout Jackson's two Administrations, engaged continually in\r\npainting portraits of the General; and, finally, the faithful Major\r\nLewis, whose intention was merely to attend the inauguration and then\r\nreturn to his plantation. The puffing little steamboat on which the\r\nparty traveled down the Cumberland and up the Ohio was saluted and\r\ncheered a hundred times a day; at Louisville, Cincinnati, and\r\nPittsburgh there were great outpourings of demonstrative citizens. Duff\r\nGreen, one of the party managers, proposed that a great cavalcade\r\nshould meet the victor at Pittsburgh and escort him by relays to the\r\ncapital. On Van Buren's advice the plan was abandoned. But as the party\r\npassed along the National Road toward its destination it was accorded\r\nan ovation which left nothing to be desired as an evidence of the\r\npublic favor.\r\n\r\nArrived in Washington, on the 11th of February--the day on which the\r\nelectoral votes were counted in the Senate--Jackson and his friends\r\nfound temporary lodgings at the Indian Queen Tavern, commonly known as\r\n\"the Wigwam.\" During the next three weeks the old inn was the scene of\r\nunwonted activity. Office seekers besieged it morning, noon, and night;\r\npoliticians came to ask favors or give advice; exponents of every sort\r\nof cause watched for opportunities to obtain promises of presidential\r\nsupport; scores of the curious came with no other purpose than to see\r\nwhat a backwoods President looked like. \"The city is full of\r\nspeculation and speculators,\" wrote Daniel Webster to his sister-in-law\r\na few days after Jackson's arrival; \"a great multitude, too many to be\r\nfed without a miracle, are already in the city, hungry for office.\r\nEspecially, I learn that the typographical corps is assembled in great\r\nforce. From New Hampshire, our friend Hill; from Boston, Mr. Greene . .\r\n. and from everywhere else somebody else. So many friends ready to\r\nadvise, and whose advice is so disinterested, make somewhat of a\r\nnumerous council about the President-elect; and, if report be true, it\r\nis a council which only makes that darker which was dark enough\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nTo all, Jackson was accessible. But he was not communicative, and up to\r\nInauguration Day people were left to speculate not only upon the truth\r\nof the rumor that there was to be a \"full sweep\" in the offices but\r\nupon the new Administration's attitude on public questions in general.\r\nEven Isaac Hill, a warm friend and supporter, was obliged to write to\r\nan acquaintance four days before the inauguration that Jackson had\r\nlittle to say about the future, \"except in a general way.\" The men with\r\nwhom the Executive-elect was daily closeted were Major Lewis and\r\nSenators Eaton and White. Van Buren would have been of the number, had\r\nnot his recently assumed duties as Governor kept him at Albany. He was\r\nably represented, however, by James A. Hamilton, a son of Alexander\r\nHamilton, to whose correspondence we owe most of what we know about the\r\nlaying of the plans for the new Administration.\r\n\r\nThe most pressing question was the personnel of the Cabinet. Upon only\r\none appointment was Jackson fully determined when he reached\r\nWashington: Van Buren was to be Secretary of State. The \"little\r\nmagician\" had been influential in turning New York from Crawford to\r\nJackson; he had resigned his seat in the Senate and run for the\r\ngovernorship with a view to uniting the party for Jackson's benefit; he\r\nwas the cleverest politician and, next to Calhoun, the ablest man, in\r\nthe Democratic ranks. When offered the chief place in the Cabinet he\r\npromptly accepted. Edward Livingston was given his choice of the\r\nremaining positions, but preferred to accept an election to the Senate.\r\nWith due regard for personal susceptibilities and sectional interests,\r\nthe list was then completed. A Pennsylvania Congressman, Samuel D.\r\nIngham, became Secretary of the Treasury; Senator John H. Eaton was\r\nmade Secretary of War; a Calhoun supporter from North Carolina, John\r\nBranch, was given the Navy portfolio; Senator John M. Berrien of\r\nGeorgia became Attorney-General; and William T. Barry of Kentucky was\r\nappointed Postmaster-General, after the incumbent, John McLean, refused\r\nto accept the policy of a clean slate in the department. The\r\nappointments were kept secret until one week before the inauguration,\r\nwhen they were announced in the party organ at the capital, Duff\r\nGreen's United States Telegraph.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the list caused consternation. Van Buren's was the only name\r\nof distinction in it; and only one of the appointees had had experience\r\nin the administration of national affairs. Hamilton pronounced the\r\ngroup \"the most unintellectual Cabinet we ever had.\" Van Buren doubted\r\nwhether he ought to have accepted a seat in such company. A crowning\r\nexpression of dissatisfaction came from the Tennessee delegation in\r\nCongress, which formally protested against the appointment of Eaton.\r\nBut the President-elect was not to be swayed. His ideas of\r\nadministrative efficiency were not highly developed, and he believed\r\nthat his Cabinet would prove equal to all demands made upon it. Not the\r\nleast of its virtues in his eyes was the fact that, although nearly\r\nevenly divided between his own followers and the friends of Calhoun, it\r\ncontained not one person who was not an uncompromising anti-Clay man.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a motley army of office seekers, personal friends, and\r\nsightseers--to the number of ten or fifteen thousand--poured into\r\nWashington to see the old rÈgime of Virginia, New York, and\r\nMassachusetts go out and the new rÈgime of the people come in. \"A\r\nmonstrous crowd of people,\" wrote Webster on Inauguration Day, \"is in\r\nthe city. I never saw anything like it before. Persons have come five\r\nhundred miles to see General Jackson, and they really seem to think\r\nthat the country is rescued from some dreadful danger.\" Another\r\nobserver, who was also not a Jacksonian, wrote: π\r\n\r\nπ Parton, Life of Andrew Jackson, Vol. III, p. 168.\r\n\r\nNo one who was in Washington at the time of General Jackson's\r\ninauguration is likely to forget that period to the day of his death.\r\nTo us, who had witnessed the quiet and orderly period of the Adams\r\nAdministration, it seemed as if half the nation had rushed at once into\r\nthe capital. It was like the inundation of the northern barbarians into\r\nRome, save that the tumultuous tide came in from a different point of\r\nthe compass. The West and the South seemed to have precipitated\r\nthemselves upon the North and overwhelmed it. . . .\r\n\r\nStrange faces filled every public place, and every face seemed to bear\r\ndefiance on its brow. It appeared to me that every Jackson editor in\r\nthe country was on the spot. They swarmed, especially in the lobbies of\r\nthe House, an expectant host, a sort of PrÊtorian band, which, having\r\nborne in upon their shields their idolized leader, claimed the reward\r\nof the hard-fought contest.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March dawned clear and balmy. \"By ten o'clock,\" says an\r\neye-witness, \"the Avenue was crowded with carriages of every\r\ndescription, from the splendid baronet and coach, down to wagons and\r\ncarts, filled with women and children, some in finery and some in rags,\r\nfor it was the People's president.\" The great square which now\r\nseparates the Capitol and the Library of Congress was in Jackson's day\r\nshut in by a picket fence. This enclosure was filled with people--\"a\r\nvast agitated sea\"--while in all directions the slopes of Capitol Hill\r\nwere thickly occupied. At noon watchers on the west portico, looking\r\ndown Pennsylvania Avenue, saw a group of gentlemen issue from the\r\nIndian Queen and thread its way slowly up the hill. All wore their hats\r\nexcept one tall, dignified, white-haired figure in the middle, who was\r\nquickly recognized as Jackson. Passing through the building, the party,\r\nreinforced by Chief Justice Marshall and certain other dignitaries,\r\nemerged upon the east portico, amid the deafening cheers of the\r\nspectators. The President-elect bowed gravely, and, stepping forward to\r\na small cloth-covered table, read in a low voice the inaugural address;\r\nthe aged Chief Justice, \"whose life was a protest against the political\r\nviews of the Jackson party,\" administered the oath of office; and the\r\nceremony was brought to a close in the customary manner by the new\r\nExecutive kissing the Bible. Francis Scott Key, watching the scene from\r\none of the gates, was moved to exclaim: \"It is beautiful, it is\r\nsublime.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the people had been sufficiently impressed by the dignity of\r\nthe occasion to keep their places and preserve a reasonable silence.\r\nBut when the executive party started to withdraw, men, women, and\r\nchildren rushed past the police and scrambled up the steps in a wild\r\neffort to reach their adored leader and grasp his hand. Disheveled and\r\npanting, the President finally reached a gate at which his horse was in\r\nwaiting; and, mounting with difficulty, he set off for the White House,\r\nfollowed by a promiscuous multitude, \"countrymen, farmers, gentlemen,\r\nmounted and unmounted, boys, women, and children, black and white.\"\r\n\r\nThe late President had no part in the day's proceedings. On arriving in\r\nWashington, Jackson had refused to make the usual call of the incoming\r\nupon the outgoing Executive, mainly because he held Adams responsible\r\nfor the newspaper virulence which had caused Mrs. Jackson such distress\r\nand had possibly shortened her life. Deserted by all save his most\r\nintimate friends, the New Englander faced the last hours of his\r\nAdministration in bitterness. His diary bears ample evidence of his\r\nill-humor and chagrin. On the 3d of March he took up his residence on\r\nMeridian Hill, near the western limits of the city; and thence he did\r\nnot venture until the festivities of the ensuing day were ended. No\r\namount of effort on the part of mediators ever availed to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between him and his successor.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom, the inaugural program came to an end with a\r\nreception at the White House; and arrangements were made to entertain a\r\nlarge number of guests. Police control, however, proved wholly\r\ninadequate, and when the throng that followed the President up the\r\nAvenue reached the executive grounds it engulfed the mansion and poured\r\nin by windows as well as doors, until the reception rooms were packed\r\nto suffocation. Other guests, bidden and unbidden--\"statesmen and\r\nstable-boys, fine ladies and washerwomen, white people and\r\nblacks\"--continued for hours to besiege the doors. \"I never saw such a\r\nmixture,\" records Judge Story; \"the reign of King Mob seemed\r\ntriumphant. I was glad to escape from the scene as soon as possible.\"\r\nThe President, too, after being jostled for an hour, very willingly\r\nmade his way by a side entrance to the street and thence to his hotel.\r\n\r\nA profusion of refreshments, including barrels of orange punch, had\r\nbeen provided; and an attempt to serve the guests led to a veritable\r\nsaturnalia. Waiters emerging from doors with loaded trays were borne to\r\nthe floor by the crush; china and glassware were smashed; gallons of\r\npunch were spilled on the carpets; in their eagerness to be served men\r\nin muddy boots leaped upon damask-covered chairs, overturned tables,\r\nand brushed bric-‡-brac from mantles and walls. \"It would have done Mr.\r\nWilberforce's heart good,\" writes a cynical observer, \"to have seen a\r\nstout black wench eating in this free country a jelly with a gold spoon\r\nat the President's House.\" Only when some thoughtful person directed\r\nthat tubs of punch be placed here and there on the lawn was the\r\ncongestion indoors relieved. When it was all over, the White House\r\nresembled a pigsty. \"Several thousand dollars' worth of broken china\r\nand cut glass and many bleeding noses attested the fierceness of the\r\nstruggle.\" It was the people's day, and it was of no avail for\r\nfastidious Adamsites to lift their eyebrows in ridicule or scorn.\r\n\r\nThose in whom the establishment of the new order aroused keenest\r\napprehension were the officeholders. A favorite theme of the Jackson\r\nforces during the late campaign was the abuses of the patronage, and\r\nthe General came into office fully convinced that an overhauling of the\r\ncivil service would be one of the greatest contributions that he could\r\nmake to his country's welfare. Even if he had been less sure of this\r\nthan he was, the pressure which office seekers and their friends\r\nbrought to bear upon him would have been irresistible. Four-fifths of\r\nthe people who flocked to Washington at inauguration time were seekers\r\nafter office for themselves or their friends, and from every county and\r\ntown the country over came pleas of service rendered and claims for\r\nreward. But Jackson needed little urging. He thought, and rightly, that\r\nmany of the incumbents had grown lax in the performance of their\r\nduties, if indeed they had ever been anything else, and that fresh\r\nblood was needed in the government employ. He believed that short terms\r\nand rapid rotation made for alertness and efficiency. He felt that one\r\nman had as much right to public office as another, and he was so\r\nunacquainted with the tasks of administration as to suppose all honest\r\ncitizens equally capable of serving their fellowmen in public station.\r\nAs for the grievances of persons removed, his view was that \"no\r\nindividual wrong is done by removal, since neither appointment to nor\r\ncontinuance in office is a matter of right.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the election Major Lewis wrote to a friend that the\r\nGeneral was \"resolved on making a pretty clean sweep of the\r\ndepartments.\" It is expected, he added, that \"he will cleanse the\r\nAugean stables, and I feel pretty confident that he will not disappoint\r\nthe popular expectation in this particular.\" If a complete overturn was\r\never really contemplated, the plan was not followed up; and it is more\r\nthan possible that it was Van Buren who marked off the limits beyond\r\nwhich it would not be expedient to go. None the less, Jackson's\r\nremovals far exceeded those made by his predecessors. Speaking broadly,\r\nthe power of removal had never yet been exercised in the Federal\r\nGovernment with offensive partizanship. Even under Jefferson, when the\r\nholders of half of the offices were changed in the space of four years,\r\nthere were few removals for political reasons.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Jackson in office, however, than wholesale proscription\r\nbegan. The ax fell in every department and bureau, and cut off chiefs\r\nand clerks with equal lack of mercy. Age and experience counted rather\r\nagainst a man than in his favor, and rarely was any reason given for\r\nremoval other than that some one else wanted the place. When Congress\r\nmet, in December, it was estimated that a thousand persons had been\r\nousted; and during the first year of the Administration the number is\r\nsaid to have reached two thousand. The Post-Office Department and the\r\nCustoms Service were purged with special severity. The sole principle\r\non which the new appointees were selected was loyalty to Jackson.\r\nPractically all were inexperienced, most were incompetent, and several\r\nproved dishonest.\r\n\r\n\"There has been,\" wrote the President in his journal a few weeks after\r\nthe inauguration, \"a great noise made about removals.\" Protest arose\r\nnot only from the proscribed and their friends, but from the Adams-Clay\r\nforces generally, and even from some of the more moderate Jacksonians.\r\n\"Were it not for the outdoor popularity of General Jackson,\" wrote\r\nWebster, \"the Senate would have negatived more than half his\r\nnominations.\" As it was, many were rejected; and some of the worst\r\nwere, under pressure, withdrawn. On the general principle the President\r\nheld his ground. \"It is rotation in office,\" he again and again\r\nasserted in all honesty, \"that will perpetuate our liberty,\" and from\r\nthis conviction no amount of argument or painful experience could shake\r\nhim. After 1830 one hears less about the subject, but only because the\r\nnovelty and glamor of the new regime had worn off.\r\n\r\nJackson was not the author of the spoils system. The device of using\r\nthe offices as rewards for political service had long been familiar in\r\nthe state and local governments, notably in New York. What Jackson and\r\nhis friends did was simply to carry over the spoils principle into the\r\nNational Government. No more unfortunate step was ever taken by an\r\nAmerican President; the task of undoing the mischief has been long and\r\nlaborious. Yet the spoils system was probably an inevitable feature of\r\nthe new rule of the people; at all events, it was accepted by all\r\nparties and sanctioned by public sentiment for more than half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nLike Philip II of Spain, who worked twelve hours a day at the business\r\nof being a King, Jackson took the duties of his exalted post very\r\nseriously. No man had ever accused him of laxness in public office,\r\ncivil or military; on the contrary, his superiors commonly considered\r\nthemselves fortunate if they could induce or compel him to keep his\r\nenergies within reasonable bounds. As President he was not without\r\ndistressing shortcomings. He was self-willed, prejudiced, credulous,\r\npetulant. But he was honest, and he was industrious. No President ever\r\nkept a closer watch upon Congress to see that the rights of the\r\nexecutive were not invaded or the will of the people thwarted; and his\r\nvigilance was rewarded, not only by his success in vindicating the\r\nindependence of the executive in a conflict whose effects are felt to\r\nthis day, but by the very respectable amount of legislation which he\r\ncontrived to obtain in the furtherance of what he believed to be the\r\npublic welfare. When a rebellious Congress took the bit in its teeth,\r\nhe never hesitated to crack the whip over its head. Sometimes the\r\npressure was applied indirectly, but with none the less effect. One of\r\nthe first acts of the Senate to arouse strong feelings in the White\r\nHouse was the rejection of the nomination of Isaac Hill to be Second\r\nComptroller of the Treasury. A New Hampshire senatorship soon falling\r\nvacant, the President deftly brought about the election of Hill to the\r\nposition; and many a gala hour he had in later days as Lewis and other\r\nwitnesses described the chagrin of the senators at being obliged to\r\naccept as one of their colleagues a man whom they had adjudged unfit\r\nfor a less important office.\r\n\r\nMuch thought had been bestowed upon the composition of the Cabinet, and\r\nsome of the President's warmest supporters urged that he should make\r\nuse of the group as a council of state, after the manner of his\r\npredecessors. Jackson's purposes, however, ran in a different\r\ndirection. He had been on intimate terms with fewer than half of the\r\nmembers, and he saw no reason why these men, some of whom were\r\nprimarily the friends of Calhoun, should be allowed to supplant old\r\nconfidants like Lewis. Let them, he reasoned, go about their appointed\r\ntasks as heads of the administrative departments, while he looked for\r\ncounsel whithersoever he desired. Hence the official Cabinet fell into\r\nthe background, and after a few weeks the practice of holding meetings\r\nwas dropped.\r\n\r\nAs advisers on party affairs and on matters of general policy the\r\nPresident drew about himself a heterogeneous group of men which the\r\npublic labeled the \"Kitchen Cabinet.\" Included in the number were the\r\ntwo members of the regular Cabinet in whom Jackson had implicit\r\nconfidence, Van Buren and Eaton. Isaac Hill was a member. Amos Kendall,\r\na New Englander who had lately edited a Jackson paper in Kentucky, and\r\nwho now found his reward in the fourth auditorship of the Treasury, was\r\nanother. William B. Lewis, prevailed upon by Jackson to accept another\r\nauditorship along with Kendall, rather than to follow out his original\r\nintention to return to his Tennessee plantation, was not only in the\r\nKitchen Cabinet but was also a member of the President's household.\r\nDuff Green, editor of the Telegraph, and A. J. Donelson, the\r\nPresident's nephew and secretary, were included in the group; as was\r\nalso Francis P. Blair after, in 1830, he became editor of the new\r\nadministration organ, the Globe. It was the popular impression that the\r\ninfluence of these men, especially of Lewis and Kendall, was very\r\ngreat--that, indeed, they virtually ruled the country. There was some\r\ntruth in the supposition. In matters upon which his mind was not fully\r\nmade up, Jackson was easily swayed; and his most intimate \"Kitchen\"\r\nadvisers were adepts at playing upon his likes and dislikes. He,\r\nhowever, always resented the insinuation that he was not his own\r\nmaster, and all testimony goes to show that when he was once resolved\r\nupon a given course his friends were just as powerless to stop him as\r\nwere his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Jacksonians were carried into office on a great wave of popular\r\nenthusiasm, and for the time being all the powers of government were\r\ntheirs. None the less, their position was imperiled almost from the\r\nbeginning by a breach within the administration ranks. Calhoun had\r\ncontented himself with reÎlection to the vice presidency in 1828 on the\r\nunderstanding that, after Jackson should have had one term, the road to\r\nthe White House would be left clear for himself. Probably Jackson, when\r\nelected, fully expected Calhoun to be his successor. Before long,\r\nhowever, the South Carolinian was given ground for apprehension. Men\r\nbegan to talk about a second term for Jackson, and the White House gave\r\nno indication of disapproval. Even more disconcerting was the large\r\nplace taken in the new rÈgime by Van Buren. The \"little magician\" held\r\nthe chief post in the Cabinet; he was in the confidence of the\r\nPresident as Calhoun was not; there were multiplying indications that\r\nhe was aiming at the presidency; and if he were to enter the race he\r\nwould be hard to beat, for by general admission he was the country's\r\nmost astute politician. With every month that passed the Vice\r\nPresidentªs star was in graver danger of eclipse.\r\n\r\nSeveral curious circumstances worked together to widen the breach\r\nbetween the Calhoun and Van Buren elements and at the same time to\r\nbring the President definitely into the ranks of the New Yorker's\r\nsupporters. One was the controversy over the social status of \"Peggy\"\r\nEaton. Peggy was the daughter of a tavern keeper, William O'Neil, at\r\nwhose hostelry both Jackson and Eaton had lived when they were\r\nsenators. Her first husband, a purser in the navy, committed suicide at\r\nsea; and Washington gossips said that he was driven to the act by\r\nchagrin caused by his wife's misconduct, both before and after her\r\nmarriage. On the eve of Jackson's inauguration the widow became Mrs.\r\nEaton, and certain disagreeable rumors connecting the names of the two\r\nwere confirmed in the public mind. When Eaton was made Secretary of\r\nWar, society shrugged its shoulders and wondered what sort of figure\r\n\"Peg O'Neil\" would cut in Cabinet circles. The question was soon\r\nanswered. At the first official functions Mrs. Eaton was received with\r\nstudied neglect by the wives of the other Cabinet officers; and all\r\nrefused either to call on her or to receive her in their homes.\r\n\r\nJackson was furious. It was enough for him that Mrs. Jackson had\r\nthought well of the suspected woman, and all his gallantry rose in her\r\ndefense. Professing to regard the attitude of the protesters as nothing\r\nless than an affront to his Administration, he called upon the men of\r\nthe Cabinet, and upon the Vice President, to remonstrate with their\r\nwives in Mrs. Eaton's behalf. But if any such remonstrances were made,\r\nnothing came of them. \"For once in his life, Andrew Jackson was\r\ndefeated. Creeks and Spaniards and Redcoats he could conquer, but the\r\nladies of Washington never surrendered, and Peggy Eaton, though her\r\naffairs became a national question, never got into Washington society.\"\r\nπ The political effect of the episode was considerable. Van Buren was a\r\nwidower, and, having no family to object, he showed Mrs. Eaton all\r\npossible courtesy. On the other hand, Mrs. Calhoun was the leader of\r\nthose who refused Mrs. Eaton recognition. Jackson was not slow to note\r\nthese facts, and his opinion of Van Buren steadily rose, while he set\r\ndown Calhoun as an obdurate member of the \"conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\nπ Brown, Andrew Jackson, p. 127.\r\n\r\nThroughout the winter of 1829-30 the Calhoun and Van Buren factions\r\nkept up a contest which daily became more acrimonious and open. Already\r\nthe clique around the President had secretly decided that in 1832 he\r\nmust run again, with Van Buren as a mate, and that the New Yorker\r\nshould be the presidential candidate in 1836. Though irritated by the\r\nVice President's conduct in the Eaton affair and in other matters,\r\nJackson threw over the understanding of 1828 with reluctance. Even\r\nwhen, on the last day of 1829, his friends, alarmed by the state of his\r\nhealth, persuaded him to write a letter to a Tennessee judge warmly\r\ncommending Van Buren and expressing grave doubts about the South\r\nCarolinian--a statement which, in the event of worst fears being\r\nrealized, would be of the utmost value to the Van Buren men--he was\r\nunwilling to go the full length of an open break.\r\n\r\nBut Lewis and his coworkers were craftily laying the train of powder\r\nthat would lead to an explosion, and in the spring of 1830 they were\r\nready to apply the match. When the President had been worked up to the\r\nright stage of suspicion, it was suddenly made known to him that it was\r\nCalhoun, not Crawford, who in Monroe's Cabinet circle in 1818 had urged\r\nthat the conqueror of Florida be censured for his bold deeds. This had\r\nthe full effect desired. Jackson made a peremptory demand upon the Vice\r\nPresident for an explanation of his perfidy. Calhoun responded in a\r\nletter which explained and explained, yet got nowhere. Whereupon\r\nJackson replied in a haughty communication, manifestly prepared by the\r\nmen who were engineering the whole business, declaring the former\r\nSecretary guilty of the most reprehensible duplicity and severing all\r\nrelations with him. This meant the end of Calhoun's hopes, at all\r\nevents for the present. He could never be President while Jackson's\r\ninfluence lasted. Van Buren had won; and the embittered South\r\nCarolinian could only turn for solace to the nullification movement, in\r\nwhich he was already deeply engulfed.\r\n\r\nPursuing their plans to the final stroke, the Administration managers\r\nforced a reconstruction of the Cabinet, and all of Calhoun's supporters\r\nwere displaced. Louis McLane of Delaware became Secretary of the\r\nTreasury; Lewis Cass of Michigan, Secretary of War; Levi Woodbury of\r\nNew Hampshire, Secretary of the Navy; and Roger B. Taney of Maryland,\r\nAttorney-General. Van Buren also retired, in conformity with Jackson's\r\nannounced intention not to have any one in the Cabinet who was a\r\ncandidate for the succession; and Edward Livingston, Jackson's old\r\nLouisiana friend, became Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that a fitting post for a successor while awaiting his\r\nturn--particularly for one who was not popular--would be the\r\nministership to Great Britain; and Van Buren duly traveled to London to\r\ntake up the duties of this position. But when the appointment was\r\nsubmitted to the Senate, Calhoun's friends adroitly managed matters so\r\nthat the Vice President should have the satisfaction of preventing\r\nconfirmation by his casting vote. \"It will kill him, sir, kill him\r\ndead,\" declared the vengeful South Carolinian to a doubting friend. \"He\r\nwill never kick, sir, never kick.\" But no greater tactical error could\r\nhave been committed. Benton showed the keener insight when he informed\r\nthe jubilant Calhoun men that they had \"broken a minister,\" only to\r\nelect a Vice President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nTHE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE\r\n\r\nThe United States came out of her second war with Great Britain a proud\r\nand fearless nation, though her record was not, on its face, glorious.\r\nShe went to war shockingly unprepared; the people were of divided\r\nopinion, and one great section was in open revolt; the military leaders\r\nwere without distinction; the soldiery was poorly trained and equipped;\r\nfinances were disordered; the operations on land were mostly failures;\r\nand the privateers, which achieved wonders in the early stages of the\r\ncontest, were driven to cover long before the close; for the\r\nrestoration of peace the nation had to thank England's war weariness\r\nfar more than her own successes; and the Treaty of Ghent did not so\r\nmuch as mention impressment, captures, or any of the other matters\r\nmainly at issue when the war was begun. Peace, however, brought\r\ngratitude, enthusiasm, optimism. Defeats were quickly forgotten; and\r\nJackson's victory at New Orleans atoned for the humiliations of years.\r\nAfter all, the contest had been victorious in its larger outcome, for\r\nthe new world conditions were such as to insure that the claims and\r\npractices which had troubled the relations of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain would never be revived. The carpings of critics were\r\ndrowned in the public rejoicings. The Hartford Convention dissolved\r\nunwept and unsung. Flushed with pride and confidence, the country\r\nentered upon a new and richer epoch.\r\n\r\nThe dominant tone of this dawning period was nationalism. The nation\r\nwas to be made great and rich and free; sectional interests and\r\nambitions were to be merged in the greater national purpose. Congress\r\nvoiced the sentiment of the day by freely laying tariffs to protect\r\nnewly risen manufactures, by appropriating money for \"internal\r\nimprovements,\" by establishing a second United States Bank, and by\r\ngiving full support to the annexation of territory for the adjustment\r\nof border difficulties and the extension of the country to its natural\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of John Marshall, the Supreme Court handed down an\r\nimposing series of decisions restricting the powers of the States and\r\nthrowing open the floodgates for the expansion of national functions\r\nand activities. Statesmen of all sections put the nation first in their\r\nplans and policies as they had not always done in earlier days. John C.\r\nCalhoun was destined shortly to take rank as the greatest of\r\nsectionalists. Nevertheless, between 1815 and 1820 he voted for\r\nprotective tariffs, brought in a great bill for internal improvements,\r\nand won from John Quincy Adams praise for being \"above all sectional .\r\n. . prejudices more than any other statesman of this union\" with whom\r\nhe \"had ever acted.\"\r\n\r\nThe differences between the nationalist and state rights schools were,\r\nhowever, deep-rooted--altogether too fundamental to be obliterated by\r\neven the nationalizing swing of the war period; and in a brief time the\r\nold controversy of Hamilton and Jefferson was renewed on the former\r\nlines. The pull of political tradition and of sectional interest was\r\ntoo strong to be resisted. In the commercial and industrial East\r\ntradition and interest supported, in general, the doctrine of broad\r\nnational powers; and the same was true of the West and Northwest. The\r\nSouth, however, inclined to limited national powers, large functions\r\nfor the States, and such a construction of the Constitution as would\r\ngive the benefit of the doubt in all cases to the States.\r\n\r\nThe political theory current south of the Potomac and the Ohio made of\r\nstate rights a fetish. Yet the powerful sectional reaction which set in\r\nafter 1820 against the nationalizing tendency had as its main impetus\r\nthe injustice which the Southern people felt had been done to them\r\nthrough the use of the nation's larger powers. They objected to the\r\nprotective tariff as a device which not only brought the South no\r\nbenefit but interfered with its markets and raised the cost of certain\r\nof its staple supplies. They opposed internal improvements at national\r\nexpense because of their consolidating tendency, and because few of the\r\nprojects carried out were of large advantage to the Southern people.\r\nThey regarded the National Bank as at best useless; and they resisted\r\nfederal legislation imposing restrictions on slavery as prejudicial to\r\nvested rights in the \"peculiar institution.\"\r\n\r\nAfter 1820 the pendulum swung rapidly back toward particularism. State\r\nrights sentiment was freely expressed by men, both Southern and\r\nNorthern, whose views commanded respect; and in more than one\r\nState--notably in Ohio and Georgia--bold actions proclaimed this\r\nsentiment to be no mere matter of academic opinion. Ohio in 1819\r\nforcibly collected a tax on the United States Bank in defiance of the\r\nSupreme Court's decision in the case of M'Culloch vs. Maryland; and in\r\n1821 her Legislature reaffirmed the doctrines of the Virginia and\r\nKentucky resolutions and persisted in resistance, even after the\r\nSupreme Court had rendered a decision π specifically against the\r\nposition which the State had taken. Judge Roane of Virginia, in a\r\nseries of articles in the Richmond Enquirer, argued that the Federal\r\nUnion was a compact among the States and that the nationalistic\r\nreasoning of his fellow Virginian, Marshall, in the foregoing decisions\r\nwas false; and Jefferson heartily endorsed his views. In Cohens vs.\r\nVirginia, in 1821, the Supreme Court held that it had appellate\r\njurisdiction in a case decided by a state court where the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States were involved, even though a State was a\r\nparty; whereupon the Virginia House of Delegates declared that the\r\nState's lawyers had been right in their contention that final\r\nconstruction of the Constitution lay with the courts of the States.\r\nJefferson, also, gave this assertion his support, and denounced the\r\ncentralizing tendencies of the Judiciary, \"which, working like gravity\r\nwithout any intermission, is to press us at last into one consolidated\r\nmass.\"\r\n\r\nπ Osborn vs. Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Jefferson actually proposed that the Virginia Legislature\r\nshould pass a set of resolutions pronouncing null and void the whole\r\nbody of federal laws on the subject of internal improvements. The\r\nGeorgia Legislature, aroused by growing antislavery activities in the\r\nNorth, declared in 1827 that the remedy lay in \"a firm and determined\r\nunion of the people and the States of the South\" against interference\r\nwith the institutions of that section of the country. Already Georgia\r\nhad placed herself in an attitude of resistance to the Federal\r\nGovernment upon the rights of the Indians within her borders, and\r\nwithin the next decade she repeatedly nullified decisions of the\r\nfederal courts on this subject. In 1828 the South Carolina Legislature\r\nadopted a series of eight resolutions denouncing the lately enacted\r\n\"tariff of abominations,\" and a report, originally drafted by Calhoun\r\nand commonly known as The South Carolina Exposition, in which were to\r\nbe found all of the essentials of the constitutional argument\r\nunderlying the nullification movement of 1832.\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson went into the White House, the country was therefore\r\nfairly buzzing with discussions of constitutional questions. What was\r\nthe true character of the Constitution and of the Union established\r\nunder it? Were the States sovereign? Who should determine the limits of\r\nstate and federal powers? What remedy had a State against\r\nunconstitutional measures of the National Government? Who should say\r\nwhen an act was unconstitutional?\r\n\r\nThe South, in particular, was in an irritable frame of mind.\r\nAgriculture was in a state of depression; manufacturing was not\r\ndeveloping as had been expected; the steadily mounting tariffs were\r\nworking economic disadvantage; the triumph of members of Congress and\r\nof the Supreme Court who favored a loose construction of the\r\nConstitution indicated that there would be no end of acts and decisions\r\ncontrary to what the South regarded as her own interests. Some\r\napprehensive people looked to Jackson for reassurance. But his first\r\nmessage to Congress assumed that the tariff would continue as it was,\r\nand, indeed, gave no promise of relief in any direction.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that the whole controversy flared up\r\nunexpectedly in one of the greatest debates ever heard on the floor of\r\nour Congress or in the legislative halls of any country. On December\r\n29, 1829, Senator Samuel A. Foote of Connecticut offered an\r\ninnocent-looking resolution proposing a temporary restriction of the\r\nsale of public lands to such lands as had already been placed on the\r\nmarket. The suggestion was immediately resented by western members, who\r\nprofessed to see in it a desire to check the drain of eastern\r\npopulation to the West; and upon the reconvening of Congress following\r\nthe Christmas recess Senator Benton of Missouri voiced in no uncertain\r\nterms the indignation of his State and section. The discussion might\r\neasily have led to nothing more than the laying of the resolution on\r\nthe table; and in that event we should never have heard of it. But it\r\nhappened that one of the senators from South Carolina, Robert Y. Hayne,\r\nsaw in the situation what he took to be a chance to deliver a telling\r\nblow for his own discontented section. On the 19th of January he got\r\nthe floor, and at the fag-end of a long day he held his colleagues'\r\nattention for an hour.\r\n\r\nThe thing that Hayne had in mind to do primarily was to draw the West\r\nto the side of the South, in common opposition to the East. He\r\ntherefore vigorously attacked the Foote resolution, agreeing with\r\nBenton that it was an expression of Eastern jealousy and that its\r\nadoption would greatly retard the development of the West. He laid much\r\nstress upon the common interests of the Western and Southern people and\r\nopenly invited the one to an alliance with the other. He deprecated the\r\ntendencies of the Federal Government to consolidation and declared\r\nhimself \"opposed, in any shape, to all unnecessary extension of the\r\npowers or the influence of the Legislature or Executive of the Union\r\nover the States, or the people of the States.\" Throughout the speech\r\nran side by side the twin ideas of strict construction and state\r\nrights; in every sentence breathed the protest of South Carolina\r\nagainst the protective tariff.\r\n\r\nJust as the South Carolinian began speaking, a shadow darkened the\r\ndoorway of the Senate chamber, and Daniel Webster stepped casually\r\ninside. The Massachusetts member was at the time absorbed in the\r\npreparation of certain cases that were coming up before the Supreme\r\nCourt, and he had given little attention either to Foote's resolution\r\nor to the debate upon it. What he now heard, however, quickly drove\r\nCarver's Lessee vs. John Jacob Astor quite out of his mind. Aspersions\r\nwere being cast upon his beloved New England; the Constitution was\r\nunder attack; the Union itself was being called in question. Webster's\r\ndecision was instantaneous: Hayne must be answered--and answered while\r\nhis arguments were still hot.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing the true grounds of the Constitution thus attacked,\" the New\r\nEnglander subsequently explained at a public dinner in New York, \"I\r\nraised my voice in its favor, I must confess, with no preparation or\r\nprevious intention. I can hardly say that I embarked in the contest\r\nfrom a sense of duty. It was an instantaneous impulse of inclination,\r\nnot acting against duty, I trust, but hardly waiting for its\r\nsuggestions. I felt it to be a contest for the integrity of the\r\nConstitution, and I was ready to enter into it, not thinking, or\r\ncaring, personally, how I came out.\" In a speech characterized by Henry\r\nCabot Lodge as \"one of the most effective retorts, one of the strongest\r\npieces of destructive criticism, ever uttered in the Senate,\" Webster\r\nnow defended his section against the charges of selfishness, jealousy,\r\nand snobbishness that had been brought against it, and urged that the\r\nSenate and the people be made to hear no more utterances, such as those\r\nof Hayne, tending \"to bring the Union into discussion, as a mere\r\nquestion of present and temporary expediency.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was now fairly started, and the word quickly went round that\r\na battle of the giants was impending. Each foeman was worthy of the\r\nother's steel. Hayne was representative of all that was proudest and\r\nbest in the South Carolina of his day. \"Nature had lavished on him,\"\r\nsays Benton, \"all the gifts which lead to eminence in public, and to\r\nhappiness in private, life.\" He was tall, well-proportioned, graceful;\r\nhis features were clean-cut and expressive of both intelligence and\r\namiability; his manner was cordial and unaffected; his mind was\r\nvigorous and his industry unremitting. Furthermore, he was an able\r\nlawyer, a fluent orator, a persuasive debater, an adroit\r\nparliamentarian. Upon entering the Senate at the early age of\r\nthirty-two, he had won prompt recognition by a powerful speech in\r\nopposition to the tariff of 1824; and by 1828, when he was reÎlected,\r\nhe was known as the South's ablest and boldest spokesman in the upper\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nWebster was an equally fitting representative of rugged New England.\r\nBorn nine years earlier than Hayne, he struggled up from a boyhood of\r\nphysical frailty and poverty to an honored place at the Boston bar, and\r\nin 1812, at the age of thirty, was elected to Congress. To the Senate\r\nhe brought, in 1827, qualities that gave him at once a preeminent\r\nposition. His massive head, beetling brow, flashing eye, and stately\r\ncarriage attracted instant attention wherever he went. His physical\r\nimpressiveness was matched by lofty traits of character and by\r\nextraordinary powers of intellect; and by 1830 he had acquired a\r\nreputation for forensic ability and legal acumen which were second to\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, on the 21st of January, Hayne rose to deliver his\r\nFirst Reply, and Webster five days later took the floor to begin his\r\nSecond Reply--probably the greatest effort in the history of American\r\nlegislative oratory--the little chamber then used by the Senate, but\r\nnowadays given over to the Supreme Court, presented a spectacle fairly\r\nto be described as historic. Every senator who could possibly be\r\npresent answered at roll call. Here were Webster's more notable fellow\r\nNew Englanders--John Holmes of Maine, Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire,\r\nHoratio Seymour of Vermont. There were Mahlon Dickerson and Theodore\r\nFrelinghuysen of New Jersey, and John M. Clayton of Delaware. Here,\r\nJohn Tyler of Virginia, John Forsyth of Georgia, William R. King of\r\nAlabama; there, Hugh L. White and Felix Grundy of Tennessee, and Thomas\r\nH. Benton of Missouri. From the President's chair Hayne's distinguished\r\nfellow South Carolinian, Calhoun, looked down upon the assemblage with\r\nemotions which he vainly strove to conceal.\r\n\r\nDuring the later stages of the discussion people of prominence from\r\nadjoining States filled the hotels of the city and bombarded the\r\nsenators with requests for tickets of admission to the senate\r\ngalleries. Lines were formed, and when the doors were thrown open in\r\nthe morning every available inch of space was instantly filled with\r\ninterested and excited spectators. So great was the pressure that all\r\nrules governing the admission of the public were waived. On the day of\r\nWebster's greatest effort ladies were admitted to the seats of the\r\nmembers, and the throng overflowed through the lobbies and down the\r\nlong stairways, quite beyond hearing distance. In the House of\r\nRepresentatives the Speaker remained at his post, but the attendance\r\nwas so scant that no business could be transacted.\r\n\r\nHayne's speech--begun on the 21st and continued on the 25th of\r\nJanuary--was the fullest and most forceful exposition of the doctrines\r\nof strict construction, state rights, and nullification that had ever\r\nfallen upon the ear of Congress. It was no mere piece of abstract\r\nargumentation. Hayne was not the man to shrink from personalities, and\r\nhe boldly accused the New England Federalists of disloyalty and Webster\r\nhimself of complicity in \"bargain and corruption.\" Thrusting and\r\nparrying, he stirred his supporters to wild enthusiasm and moved even\r\nthe solemn-visaged Vice President to smiles of approval. The\r\nnationalists winced and wondered whether their champion would be able\r\nto measure up with so keen an antagonist. Webster sat staring into\r\nspace, breaking his reverie only now and then to make a few notes.\r\n\r\nThe debate reached a climax in Webster's powerful Second Reply, on the\r\n26th and 27th of January. Everything was favorable for a magnificent\r\neffort: the hearing was brilliant, the theme was vital, the speaker was\r\nin the prime of his matchless powers. On the desk before the New\r\nEnglander as he arose were only five small letter-paper pages of notes.\r\nHe spoke with such immediate preparation merely as the labors of a\r\nsingle evening made possible. But it may be doubted whether any\r\nforensic effort in our history was ever more thoroughly prepared for,\r\nbecause Webster lived his speech before he spoke it. The origins of the\r\nFederal Union, the theories and applications of the Constitution, the\r\nhistory and bearings of nullification--these were matters with which\r\nyears of study, observation, professional activity, and association\r\nwith men had made him absolutely familiar. If any living American could\r\nanswer Hayne and his fellow partizans, Webster was the man to do it.\r\n\r\nForty-eight in the total of seventy-three pages of print filled by this\r\nspeech are taken up with a defense of New England against the Southern\r\ncharges of sectionalism and disloyalty. Few utterances of the time are\r\nmore familiar than the sentences bringing this part of the oration to a\r\nclose: \"Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium of Massachusetts;\r\nshe needs none. There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves.\r\nThere is her history; the world knows it by heart. . . . There is\r\nBoston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there they\r\nwill remain forever.\" If this had been all, the speech would have been\r\nonly a spirited defense of the good name of a section and would hardly\r\nhave gained immortality. It was the Union, however, that most needed\r\ndefense; and for that service the orator reserved his grandest efforts.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening of the discussion Webster's object had been to \"force\r\nfrom Hayne or his supporters a full, frank, clear-cut statement of what\r\nnullification meant; and then, by opposing to this doctrine the\r\nConstitution as he understood it, to show its utter inadequacy and\r\nfallaciousness either as constitutional law or as a practical working\r\nscheme.\" π In the Southerner's First Reply Webster found the statement\r\nthat he wanted; he now proceeded to demolish it. Many pages of print\r\nwould be required to reproduce, even in substance, the arguments which\r\nhe employed. Yet the fundamentals are so simple that they can be stated\r\nin a dozen lines. Sovereignty, under our form of government, resides in\r\nthe people of the United States. The exercise of the powers of\r\nsovereignty is entrusted by the people partly to the National\r\nGovernment and partly to the state Governments. This division of\r\nfunctions is made in the federal Constitution. If differences arise, as\r\nthey must, as to the precise nature of the division, the decision\r\nrests--not with the state legislatures, as Hayne had said--but with the\r\nfederal courts, which were established in part for that very purpose.\r\nNo State has a right to \"nullify\" a federal law; if one State has this\r\nright, all must have it, and the result can only be conflicts that\r\nwould plunge the Government into chaos and the people ultimately into\r\nwar. If the Constitution is not what the people want, they can amend\r\nit; but as long as it stands, the Constitution and all lawful\r\ngovernment under it must be obeyed.\r\n\r\nπ MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, p. 98.\r\n\r\nThe incomparably eloquent peroration penetrated to the heart of the\r\nwhole matter. The logic of nullification was disunion. Fine theories\r\nmight be spun and dazzling phrases made to convince men otherwise, but\r\nthe hard fact would remain. Hayne, Calhoun, and their like were playing\r\nwith fire. Already they were boldly weighing \"the chances of preserving\r\nliberty when the bonds that unite us together shall be broken asunder\";\r\nalready they were hanging over the precipice of disunion, to see\r\nwhether they could \"fathom the depth of the abyss below.\" The last\r\npowerful words of the speech were, therefore, a glorification of the\r\nUnion:\r\n\r\nWhile the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects\r\nspread out before us, for us and our children. Beyond that I seek not\r\nto penetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at least, that curtain\r\nmay not rise. . . . When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last\r\ntime the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and\r\ndishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered,\r\ndiscordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched,\r\nit may be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and lingering\r\nglance, rather, behold the gorgeous ensign of the Republic, now known\r\nand honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced, its arms\r\nand trophies streaming in their original lustre, not a stripe erased or\r\npolluted, nor a single star obscured, bearing for its motto no such\r\nmiserable interrogatory as \"What is all this worth?\" nor those other\r\nwords of delusion and folly \"Liberty first and Union afterward\"; but\r\neverywhere, spread all over in characters of living light, blazing on\r\nall its ample folds, as they float over the sea and over the land, and\r\nin every wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear to\r\nevery American heart--\"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and\r\ninseparable!\"\r\n\r\nUndaunted by the flood of eloquence that for four hours held the Senate\r\nspellbound, Hayne replied in a long speech that touched the zenith of\r\nhis own masterful powers of argumentation. He conceded nothing. Each\r\nState, he still maintained, is \"an independent sovereignty\"; the Union\r\nis based upon a compact; and every party to the compact has a right to\r\ninterpret for itself the terms of the agreement by which all are bound\r\ntogether. In a short, crisp speech, traversing the main ground which he\r\nhad already gone over, Webster exposed the inconsistencies and dangers\r\ninvolved in this argument; and the debate was over. The Foote\r\nresolution, long since forgotten, remained on the Senate calendar four\r\nmonths and was then tabled. Webster went back to his cases; the\r\npoliticians turned again to their immediate concerns; the humdrum of\r\ncongressional business was resumed; and popular interest drifted to\r\nother things.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were well satisfied with the presentation of their views.\r\nCertainly neither was converted to the position of the other. The\r\ndebate served, however, to set before the country with greater\r\nclearness than ever before the two great systems of constitutional\r\ninterpretation that were struggling for mastery, and large numbers of\r\nmen whose ideas had been hazy were now led to adopt thoughtfully either\r\nthe one body of opinions or the other. The country was not yet ready to\r\nfollow the controversy to the end which Webster clearly foresaw--civil\r\nwar. But each side treasured its vitalized and enriched arguments for\r\nuse in a more strenuous day.\r\n\r\nAdvantage in the great discussion lay partly with Hayne and partly with\r\nhis brilliant antagonist. On the whole, the facts of history were on\r\nthe side of Hayne. Webster attempted to argue from the intent of the\r\nframers of the Constitution and from early opinion concerning the\r\nnature of the Union; but a careful appraisal of the evidence hardly\r\nbears out his contentions. On economic matters also, notably the\r\noperation of the protective tariff, he trod uncertain ground. He\r\nrealized this fact and as far as possible kept clear of economic\r\ndiscussion. The South had real grievances, and Webster was well enough\r\naware that they could not be argued out of existence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Northerner was vastly superior to his opponent\r\nin his handling of the theoretical issues of constitutional law; and in\r\nhis exposition of the practical difficulties that would attend the\r\noperation of the principle of nullification he employed a fund of\r\nargument that was simply unanswerable. The logic of the larger phases\r\nof the situation lay, too, with him. If the Union for which he pleaded\r\nwas not the Union which the Fathers intended to establish or even that\r\nwhich actually existed in the days of Washington and the elder Adams,\r\nit was at all events the Union in which, by the close of the fourth\r\ndecade under the Constitution, a majority of the people of the United\r\nStates had come to believe. It was the Union of Henry Clay, of Andrew\r\nJackson, of Abraham Lincoln. And the largest significance of Webster's\r\narguments in 1830 arises from the definiteness and force which they put\r\ninto popular convictions that until then were vague and\r\ninarticulate--convictions which, as has been well said, \"went on\r\nbroadening and deepening until, thirty years afterward, they had a\r\nforce sufficient to sustain the North and enable her to triumph in the\r\nterrible struggle which resulted in the preservation of national life.\"\r\nIt was the Second Reply to Hayne which, more than any other single\r\nevent or utterance between 1789 and 1860, \"compacted the States into a\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTARIFF AND NULLIFICATION\r\n\r\nIt was more than brilliant oratory that had drawn to the Senate chamber\r\nthe distinguished audiences faced by Webster and Hayne in the great\r\ndebate of 1830. The issues discussed touched the vitality and\r\npermanence of the nation itself. Nullification was no mere abstraction\r\nof the senator from South Carolina. It was a principle which his\r\nState--and, for aught one could tell, his section--was about to put\r\ninto action. Already, in 1830, the air was tense with the coming\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina had traveled a long road, politically, since 1789. In\r\nthe days of Washington and the elder Adams the State was strongly\r\nFederalist. In 1800 Jefferson secured its electoral vote. But the\r\nVirginian's leadership was never fully accepted, and even before the\r\nRepublican party had elsewhere submitted to the inevitable\r\nnationalization the South Carolina membership was openly arrayed on the\r\nside of a protective tariff, the National Bank, and internal\r\nimprovements. Calhoun and Cheves were for years among the most ardent\r\nexponents of broad constitutional construction; Hayne himself was\r\nelected to the Senate in 1822 as a nationalist, and over another\r\ncandidate whose chief handicap was that he had proposed that his State\r\nsecede rather than submit to the Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\nAfter 1824 sentiment rapidly shifted. The cause appeared to be the\r\ntariff; but in reality deeper forces were at work. South Carolina was\r\nan agricultural State devoted almost exclusively to the raising of\r\ncotton and rice. Soil and climate made her such, and the \"peculiar\r\ninstitution\" confirmed what Nature already had decreed. But the\r\nplanters were now beginning to feel keenly the competition of the new\r\ncotton lands of the Gulf plains. As production increased, the price of\r\ncotton fell. \"In 1816,\" writes Professor Turner, \"the average price of\r\nmiddling uplands . . . was nearly thirty cents, and South Carolina's\r\nleaders favored the tariff; in 1820 it was seventeen cents, and the\r\nSouth saw in the protective system a grievance; in 1824 it was fourteen\r\nand three-quarters cents, and the South Carolinians denounced the\r\ntariff as unconstitutional.\" π\r\n\r\nπ Turner, The Rise of the New West, p. 325.\r\n\r\nMen of the Clay-Adams school argued that the tariff stimulated\r\nindustry, doubled the profits of agriculture, augmented wealth, and\r\nhence promoted the well-being of the nation as a whole. The Southern\r\nplanter was never able to discover in the protective system any real\r\nadvantage for himself, but as long as the tariffs were moderate he was\r\ninfluenced by nationalistic sentiment to accept them. The demand for\r\nprotection on the part of the Northern manufacturers seemed, however,\r\ninsatiable. An act of 1824 raised the duties on cotton and woolen\r\ngoods. A measure of 1827 which applied to woolens the ruinous principle\r\nalready applied to cottons was passed by the House and was laid on the\r\ntable in the Senate only by the casting vote of Vice President Calhoun.\r\nThe climax was reached in the Tariff Act of 1828, which the Southerners\r\nthemselves loaded with objectionable provisions in the vain hope of\r\nmaking it so abominable that even New England congressmen would vote\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nA few years of such legislation sufficed to rouse the South to a deep\r\nfeeling of grievance. It was no longer a question of reasonable\r\nconcession to the general national good. A vast artificial economic\r\nsystem had been set up, whose benefits accrued to the North and whose\r\nburdens fell disproportionately upon the South. The tone and temper of\r\nthe manufacturing sections and of the agricultural West gave no promise\r\nof a change of policy. The obvious conclusion was that the planting\r\ninterests must find some means of bringing pressure to bear for their\r\nown relief.\r\n\r\nThe means which they found was nullification; and it fell to South\r\nCarolina, whose people were most ardent in their resentment of anything\r\nthat looked like discrimination, to put the remedy to the test. The\r\nLegislature of this State had made an early beginning by denouncing the\r\ntariff of 1824 as unconstitutional. In 1827 Robert J. Turnbull, one of\r\nthe abler political leaders, published under the title of The Crisis a\r\nseries of essays in which he boldly proclaimed nullification as the\r\nremedy. In the following summer Calhoun put the nullification doctrine\r\ninto its first systematic form in a paper--the so-called\r\nExposition--which for some time was known to the public only as the\r\nreport of a committee of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nBy 1829 the State was sharply divided into two parties, the\r\nnationalists and the nullifiers. All were agreed that the protective\r\nsystem was iniquitous and that it must be broken down. The difference\r\nwas merely as to method. The nationalists favored working through the\r\ncustomary channels of legislative reform; the nullifiers urged that the\r\nState interpose its authority to prevent the enforcement of the\r\nobjectionable laws. For a time the leaders wavered. But the swing of\r\npublic sentiment in the direction of nullification was rapid and\r\noverwhelming, and one by one the representatives in Congress and other\r\nmen of prominence fell into line. Hayne and McDuffie were among the\r\nfirst to give it their support; and Calhoun, while he was for a time\r\nheld back by his political aspirations and by his obligations as Vice\r\nPresident, came gradually to feel that his political future would be\r\nworth little unless he had the support of his own State.\r\n\r\nAs the election of 1828 approached, the hope of the discontented forces\r\ncentered in Jackson. They did not overlook the fact that his record was\r\nthat of a moderate protectionist. But the same was true of many South\r\nCarolinians and Georgians, and it seemed not at all impossible that, as\r\na Southern man and a cotton planter, he should undergo a change of\r\nheart no less decisive than that which Hayne and Calhoun had\r\nexperienced. Efforts to draw him out, however, proved not very\r\nsuccessful. Lewis saw to it that Jackson's utterances while yet he was\r\na candidate were safely colorless; and the single mention of the tariff\r\ncontained in the inaugural address was susceptible of the most varied\r\ninterpretations. The annual message of 1829 indicated opposition to\r\nprotection; on the other hand, the presidential message of the next\r\nyear not only asserted the full power of Congress to levy protective\r\nduties but declared the abandonment of protection \"neither to be\r\nexpected or desired.\" Gradually the antiprotectionist leaders were made\r\nto see that the tariff was not a subject upon which the President felt\r\nkeenly, and that therefore it was useless to look to him for effective\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nEven the adroit efforts which were made to get from the incoming\r\nexecutive expressions that could be interpreted as endorsements of\r\nnullification were successfully fended off. For some months the\r\nPresident gave no outward sign of his disapproval. With more than his\r\nusual deliberateness, Jackson studied the situation, awaiting the right\r\nmoment to speak out with the maximum of effect.\r\n\r\nThe occasion finally came on April 13, 1830, at a banquet held in\r\nWashington in celebration of Jefferson's birthday. The Virginia patron\r\nof democracy had been dead four years, and Jackson had become, more\r\ntruly than any other man, his successor. Jacksonian democracy was,\r\nhowever, something very different from Jeffersonian, and never was the\r\ncontrast more evident than on this fateful evening. During the earlier\r\npart of the festivities a series of prearranged toasts, accompanied by\r\nshort speeches, put before the assemblage the Jeffersonian teachings in\r\na light highly favorable--doubtless unwarrantably so--to the ultra\r\nstate rights theory. Then followed a number of volunteer toasts. The\r\nPresident was, of course, accorded the honor of proposing the\r\nfirst--and this gave Jackson his chance. Rising in his place and\r\ndrawing himself up to his full height, he raised his right hand, looked\r\nstraight at Calhoun and, amid breathless silence, exclaimed in that\r\ncrisp, harsh tone that had so often been heard above the crashing of\r\nmany rifles: \"Our Union! It must be preserved!\"\r\n\r\nAn account of the scene which is given by Isaac Hill, a member of the\r\nKitchen Cabinet and an eyewitness, is interesting:\r\n\r\nA proclamation of martial law in South Carolina and an order to arrest\r\nCalhoun where he sat could not have come with more blinding, staggering\r\nforce. All hilarity ceased. The President, without adding one word in\r\nthe way of speech, lifted up his glass as a notice that the toast was\r\nto be quaffed standing. Calhoun rose with the rest. His glass so\r\ntrembled in his hand that a little of the amber fluid trickled down the\r\nside. Jackson stood silent and impassive. There was no response to the\r\ntoast. Calhoun waited until all sat down. Then he slowly and with\r\nhesitating accent offered the second volunteer toast: \"The Union! Next\r\nto Our Liberty Most Dear!\" Then, after a minute's hesitation, and in a\r\nway that left doubt as to whether he intended it for part of the toast\r\nor for the preface to a speech, he added: \"May we all remember that it\r\ncan only be preserved by respecting the rights of the States and by\r\ndistributing equally the benefit and burden of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe nullifiers had carefully planned the evening's proceedings with a\r\npurpose to strengthen their cause with the country. They had not\r\nreckoned on the President, and the dash of cold water which he had\r\nadministered caused them more anguish than any opposition that they had\r\nyet encountered. The banquet broke up earlier than had been expected,\r\nand the diners went off by twos and threes in eager discussion of the\r\nscene that they had witnessed. Some were livid with rage; some shook\r\ntheir heads in fear of civil war; but most rejoiced in the splendid\r\nexhibition of executive dignity and patriotic fervor which the\r\nPresident had given. Subsequently it transpired that Jackson had acted\r\non no mere impulse and that his course had been carefully planned in\r\nconsultation with Van Buren and other advisers.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer and autumn of 1830 both the State Rights and\r\nUnion parties in South Carolina worked feverishly to perfect their\r\norganizations. The issue that both were making ready to meet was\r\nnothing less than the election of a convention to nullify the tariff\r\nlaws. Those upholding nullification lost no opportunity to consolidate\r\ntheir forces, and by the close of the year these were clearly in the\r\nmajority, although the unionist element contained many of the ablest\r\nand most respected men in the State. Calhoun directed the nullifier\r\ncampaign, though he did not throw off all disguises until the summer of\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nThough Jackson made no further public declarations, the views which he\r\nexpressed in private were usually not slow to reach the public ear. In\r\na letter to a committee of the Union party in response to an invitation\r\nto attend a Fourth of July dinner the President intimated that force\r\nmight properly be employed if nullification should be attempted. And to\r\na South Carolina Congressman who was setting off on a trip home he\r\nsaid: \"Tell them [the nullifiers] from me that they can talk and write\r\nresolutions and print threats to their hearts' content. But if one drop\r\nof blood be shed there in defiance of the laws of the United States, I\r\nwill hang the first man of them I can get my hands on to the first tree\r\nI can find.\" When Hayne heard of this threat he expressed in Benton's\r\nhearing a doubt as to whether the President would really hang anybody.\r\n\"I tell you, Hayne,\" the Missourian replied, \"when Jackson begins to\r\ntalk about hanging, they can begin to look for the ropes.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile actual nullification awaited the decision of the Vice\r\nPresident to surrender himself completely to the cause and to become\r\nits avowed leader. Calhoun did not find this an easy decision to make.\r\nAbove all things he wanted to be President. He was not the author of\r\nnullification; and although he did not fully realize until too late how\r\nmuch his state rights leanings would cost him in the North, he was\r\nshrewd enough to know that his political fortunes would not be bettered\r\nby his becoming involved in a great sectional controversy.\r\nCircumstances worked together, however, to force Calhoun gradually into\r\nthe position of chief prominence in the dissenting movement. The tide\r\nof public opinion in his State swept him along with it; the breach with\r\nJackson severed the last tie with the northern and western democracy;\r\nand his resentment of Van Buren's rise to favor prompted words and acts\r\nwhich completed the isolation of the South Carolinian. His party's\r\nenthusiastic acceptance of Jackson as a candidate for reÎlection in\r\n1832 and of \"Little Van\" as a candidate for the vice presidency--and,\r\nby all tokens, for the presidency four years later--was the last straw.\r\nBroken and desperate, Calhoun sank back into the rÙle of an extremist,\r\nsectional leader. There was no need of further concealment; and in\r\nmidsummer, 1831, he issued his famous Address to the People of South\r\nCarolina, and this restatement of the Exposition of 1828 now became the\r\navowed platform of the nullification party. The Fort Hill Letter of\r\nAugust 28, 1832, addressed to Governor Hamilton, was a simpler and\r\nclearer presentation of the same body of doctrine.\r\n\r\nMatters were at last brought to a head by a new piece of tariff\r\nlegislation which was passed in 1832 not to appease South Carolina but\r\nto take advantage of a comfortable state of affairs that had arisen in\r\nthe national treasury. The public lands were again selling well, and\r\nthe late tariff laws were yielding lavishly. The national debt was\r\ndwindling to the point of disappearance, and the country had more money\r\nthan it could use. Jackson therefore called upon Congress to revise the\r\ntariff system so as to reduce the revenue, and in the session of\r\n1831-32 several bills to that end were brought forward. The scale of\r\nduties finally embodied in the Act of July 14, 1832, corrected many of\r\nthe anomalies of the Act of 1828, but it cut off some millions of\r\nrevenue without making any substantial change in the protective system.\r\nVirginia and North Carolina voted heavily for the bill, but South\r\nCarolina and Georgia as vigorously opposed it; and the nullifiers\r\nrefused to see in it any concession to the tariff principles for which\r\nthey stood. \"I no longer consider the question one of free trade,\"\r\nwrote Calhoun when the passage of the bill was assured, \"but of\r\nconsolidation.\" In an address to their constituents the South Carolina\r\ndelegation in Congress declared that \"protection must now be regarded\r\nas the settled policy of the country,\" that \"all hope from Congress is\r\nirrevocably gone,\" and that it was for the people to decide \"whether\r\nthe rights and liberties which you received as a precious inheritance\r\nfrom an illustrious ancestry shall be tamely surrendered without a\r\nstruggle, or transmitted undiminished to your posterity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the disaffected State events now moved rapidly. The elections of the\r\nearly autumn were carried by the nullifiers, and the new Legislature,\r\nacting on the recommendation of Governor Hamilton, promptly called a\r\nstate convention to consider whether the \"federal compact\" had been\r\nviolated and what remedy should be adopted. The 162 delegates who\r\ngathered at Columbia on the 19th of November were, socially and\r\npolitically, the Èlite of the State: Hamiltons, Haynes, Pinckneys,\r\nButlers--almost all of the great families of a State of great families\r\nwere represented. From the outset the convention was practically of one\r\nmind; and an ordinance of nullification drawn up by a committee of\r\ntwenty-one was adopted within five days by a vote of 136 to 26.\r\n\r\nThe tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 were declared \"null, void, and no law,\r\nnor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens.\" None of the\r\nduties in question were to be permitted to be collected in the State\r\nafter February 1, 1833. Appeals to the federal courts for enforcement\r\nof the invalidated acts were forbidden, and all officeholders, except\r\nmembers of the Legislature, were required to take an oath to uphold the\r\nordinance. Calhoun had laboriously argued that nullification did not\r\nmean disunion. But his contention was not sustained by the words of the\r\nordinance, which stated unequivocally that the people of the State\r\nwould not \"submit to the application of force on the part of the\r\nfederal Government to reduce this State to obedience.\" Should force be\r\nused, the ordinance boldly declared--indeed, should any action contrary\r\nto the will of the people be taken to execute the measures declared\r\nvoid--such efforts would be regarded as \"inconsistent with the longer\r\ncontinuance of South Carolina in the Union,\" and \"the people of this\r\nState\" would \"thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further\r\nobligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the\r\npeople of the other States, and will forthwith proceed to organize a\r\nseparate Government, and to do all other acts and things which\r\nsovereign and independent States may of right do.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the instructions of the convention, the Legislature\r\nforthwith reassembled to pass the measures deemed necessary to enforce\r\nthe ordinance. A replevin act provided for the recovery of goods seized\r\nor detained for payment of duty; the use of military force, including\r\nvolunteers, to \"repel invasion\" was authorized; and provision was made\r\nfor the purchase of arms and ammunition. Throughout the State a martial\r\ntone resounded. Threats of secession and war were heard on every side.\r\nNightly meetings were held and demonstrations were organized. Blue\r\ncockades with a palmetto button in the center became the most popular\r\nof ornaments. Medals were struck bearing the inscription: \"John C.\r\nCalhoun, First President of the Southern Confederacy.\" The Legislature,\r\nreassembling in December, elected Hayne as Governor and chose\r\nCalhoun--who now resigned the vice presidency--to take the vacant seat\r\nin the Senate. In his first message to the Legislature Webster's former\r\nantagonist declared his purpose to carry into full effect the\r\nnullification ordinance and the legislation supplementary to it, and\r\nexpressed confidence that, if the sacred soil of the State should be\r\n\"polluted by the footsteps of an invader,\" no one of her sons would be\r\nfound \"raising a parricidal arm against our common mother.\"\r\n\r\nThus the proud commonwealth was panoplied for a contest of wits, and\r\nperchance of arms, with the nation. Could it hope to win? South\r\nCarolina had a case which had been forcibly and plausibly presented. It\r\ncould count on a deep reluctance of men in every part of the country to\r\nsee the nation fall into actual domestic combat. There were, however, a\r\ndozen reasons why victory could not reasonably be looked for. One would\r\nhave been enough--the presence of Andrew Jackson in the White House.\r\n\r\nThrough federal officers and the leaders of the Union party Jackson\r\nkept himself fully informed upon the situation, and six weeks before\r\nthe nullification convention was called he began preparations to meet\r\nall eventualities. The naval authorities at Norfolk were directed to be\r\nin readiness to dispatch a squadron to Charleston; the commanders of\r\nthe forts in Charleston Harbor were ordered to double their vigilance\r\nand to defend their posts against any persons whatsoever; troops were\r\nordered from Fortress Monroe; and General Scott was sent to take full\r\ncommand and to strengthen the defenses as he found necessary. The South\r\nCarolinians were to be allowed to talk, and even to adopt \"ordinances,\"\r\nto their hearts' content. But the moment they stepped across the line\r\nof disobedience to the laws of the United States they were to be made\r\nto feel the weight of the nation's restraining hand.\r\n\r\n\"The duty of the Executive is a plain one,\" wrote the President to Joel\r\nR. Poinsett, a prominent South Carolina unionist; \"the laws will be\r\nexecuted and the United States preserved by all the constitutional and\r\nlegal means he is invested with.\" When the situation bore its most\r\nserious aspect Jackson received a call from Sam Dale, who had been one\r\nof his dispatch bearers at the Battle of New Orleans. \"General Dale,\"\r\nexclaimed the President during the conversation, \"if this thing goes\r\non, our country will be like a bag of meal with both ends open. Pick it\r\nup in the middle or endwise, and it will run out. I must tie the bag\r\nand save the country.\" \"Dale,\" he exclaimed again later, \"they are\r\ntrying me here; you will witness it; but, by the God of heaven, I will\r\nuphold the laws.\" \"I understood him to be referring to nullification\r\nagain,\" related Dale in his account of the interview, \"and I expressed\r\nthe hope that things would go right.\" \"They shall go right, sir,\" the\r\nPresident fairly shouted, shattering his pipe on the table by way of\r\nfurther emphasis.\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson heard that the convention at Columbia had taken the step\r\nexpected of it, he made the following entry in his diary: \"South\r\nCarolina has passed her ordinance of nullification and secession. As\r\nsoon as it can be had in authentic form, meet it with a proclamation.\"\r\nThe proclamation was issued December 10, 1832. Parton relates that the\r\nPresident wrote the first draft of this proclamation under such a glow\r\nof feeling that he was obliged \"to scatter the written pages all over\r\nthe table to let them dry,\" and that the document was afterwards\r\nrevised by his scholarly Secretary of State, Edward Livingston. With\r\nJackson supplying the ideas and spirit and Livingston the literary\r\nform, the result was the ablest and most impressive state paper of the\r\nperiod. It categorically denied the right of a State either to annul a\r\nfederal law or to secede from the Union. It admitted that the laws\r\ncomplained of operated unequally but took the position that this must\r\nbe true of all revenue measures. It expressed the inflexible\r\ndetermination of the Administration to repress and punish every form of\r\nresistance to federal authority. Deep argument, solemn warning, and\r\nfervent entreaty were skillfully combined. But the most powerful effect\r\nwas likely to be that produced by the President's flaming denial--set\r\nin bold type in the contemporary prints--of the Hayne-Calhoun creed: \"I\r\nconsider the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one\r\nState, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted\r\nexpressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its\r\nspirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and\r\ndestructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the North this vindication of national dignity and power\r\nstruck a responsive chord, and for once even the Adams and Clay men\r\nfound themselves in hearty agreement with the President. Bostonians\r\ngathered in Faneuil Hall and New Yorkers in a great meeting in the Park\r\nto shower encomiums upon the proclamation and upon its author. The\r\nnullifiers did not at once recoil from the blow. The South Carolina\r\nLegislature called upon Governor Hayne officially to warn \"the good\r\npeople of this State against the attempt of the President of the United\r\nStates to seduce them from their allegiance\"; and the resulting\r\ncounterblast, in the form of a proclamation made public on the 20th of\r\nDecember, was as vigorous as the liveliest \"fire-eater\" could have\r\nwished. The Governor declared that the State would maintain its\r\nsovereignty or be \"buried beneath its ruins.\"\r\n\r\nThe date of the expected crisis--February 1, 1833, when the\r\nnullification ordinance was to take effect--was now near at hand, and\r\non both sides preparations were pushed. During the interval, however,\r\nthe tide turned decidedly against the nullifiers. A call for a general\r\nconvention of the States \"to determine and consider . . . questions of\r\ndisputed power\" served only to draw out strong expressions of\r\ndisapproval of the South Carolina program, showing that it could not\r\nexpect even moral support from outside. On the 16th of January Jackson\r\nasked Congress for authority to alter or abolish certain ports of\r\nentry, to use force to execute the revenue laws, and to try in the\r\nfederal courts cases that might arise from the present emergency. Five\r\ndays later a bill on these lines--popularly denominated the \"Force\r\nBill\"--was introduced; and while many men who had no sympathy with\r\nnullification drew back from a plan involving the coercion of a State,\r\nit was soon settled that some sort of measure for strengthening the\r\nPresident's hand would be passed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a way of escape from the whole difficulty was unexpectedly\r\nopened. The friends of Van Buren began to fear that the disagreement of\r\nNorth and South upon the tariff question would cost their favorite the\r\nunited support of the party in 1836. Accordingly they set on foot a\r\nmovement in Congress to bring about a moderate reduction of the\r\nprevailing rates; and it was of course their hope that the nullifiers\r\nwould be induced to recede altogether from the position which they had\r\ntaken. Through Verplanck of New York, the Ways and Means Committee of\r\nthe House brought in a measure reducing the duties, within two years,\r\nto about half the existing rates. Jackson approved the plan, although\r\npersonally he had little to do with it.\r\n\r\nBut though the Verplanck Bill could not muster sufficient support to\r\nbecome law, it revived tariff discussion on promising lines, and it\r\nbrought nullification proceedings to a halt in the very nick of time.\r\nShortly before February 1, 1833, the leading nullifiers came together\r\nin Charleston and entered into an extralegal agreement to postpone the\r\nenforcement of the nullification ordinance until the outcome of the new\r\ntariff debates should be known. The failure of the Verplanck measure,\r\nhowever, left matters where they were, and civil war in South Carolina\r\nagain loomed ominously.\r\n\r\nIn this juncture patriots of all parties turned to the one man whose\r\nleadership seemed indispensable in tariff legislation--the \"great\r\npacificator,\" Henry Clay, who after two years in private life had just\r\ntaken his seat in the Senate. Clay was no friend of Jackson or of Van\r\nBuren, and it required much sacrifice of personal feeling to lend his\r\nservices to a program whose political benefits would almost certainly\r\naccrue to his rivals. Finally, however, he yielded and on the 12th of\r\nFebruary he rose in the Senate and offered a compromise measure\r\nproposing that on all articles which paid more than twenty per cent the\r\namount in excess of that rate should be reduced by stages until in 1842\r\nit would entirely disappear.\r\n\r\nStormy debates followed on both the Compromise Tariff and the Force\r\nBill, but before the session closed on the 4th of March both were on\r\nthe statute book. When, therefore, the South Carolina convention, in\r\naccordance with an earlier proclamation of Governor Hamilton,\r\nreassembled on the 11th of March, the wind had been taken out of the\r\nnullifiers' sails; the laws which they had \"nullified\" had been\r\nrepealed, and there was nothing for the convention to do but to rescind\r\nthe late ordinance and the legislative measures supplementary to it.\r\nThere was a chance, however, for one final fling. By a vote of 132 to\r\n19 the convention soberly adopted an ordinance nullifying the Force\r\nBill and calling on the Legislature to pass laws to prevent the\r\nexecution of that measure--which, indeed, nobody was now proposing to\r\nexecute.\r\n\r\nSo the tempest passed. Both sides claimed victory, and with some show\r\nof reason. So far as was possible without an actual test of strength,\r\nthe authority of the Federal Government had been vindicated and its\r\ndignity maintained; the constitutional doctrines of Webster acquired a\r\nnew sanction; the fundamental point was enforced that a law--that every\r\nlaw--enacted by Congress must be obeyed until repealed or until set\r\naside by the courts as unconstitutional. On the other hand, the\r\nnullifiers had brought about the repeal of the laws to which they\r\nobjected and had been largely instrumental in turning the tariff policy\r\nof the country for some decades into a new channel. Moreover they\r\nexpressed no regret for their acts and in no degree renounced the views\r\nupon which those acts had been based. They submitted to the authority\r\nof the United States, but on terms fixed by themselves. And, what is\r\nmore, they supplied practically every constitutional and political\r\nargument to be used by their sons in 1860 to justify secession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE WAR ON THE UNITED STATES BANK\r\n\r\n\"Nothing lacks now to complete the love-feast,\" wrote Isaac Hill\r\nsardonically to Thomas H. Benton after the collapse of nullification,\r\n\"but for Jackson and Webster to solemnize the coalition [in support of\r\nthe Union] with a few mint-juleps! I think I could arrange it, if\r\nassured of the coˆperation of yourself and Blair on our side, and Jerry\r\nMason and Nick Biddle on theirs. But never fear, my friend. This mixing\r\nof oil and water is only the temporary shake-up of Nullification. Wait\r\ntill Jackson gets at the Bank again, and then the scalping-knives will\r\nglisten once more.\"\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina controversy had indeed brought Jacksonians and\r\nanti-Jacksonians together. But once the tension was relaxed, there\r\nbegan the conflict of interests which the New Hampshire editor had\r\npredicted. Men fell again into their customary political relationships;\r\nissues that for the moment had been pushed into the\r\nbackground--internal improvements, public land policy, distribution of\r\nsurplus revenue, and above all the Bank--were revived in full vigor.\r\nNow, indeed, the President entered upon the greatest task to which he\r\nhad yet put his hand. To curb nullification was a worthy achievement.\r\nBut, after all, Congress and an essentially united nation had stood\r\nfirmly behind the Executive at every stage of that performance. To\r\ndestroy the United States Bank was a different matter, for this\r\ninstitution had the full support of one of the two great parties in\r\nwhich the people of the country were now grouped; Jackson's own party\r\nwas by no means a unit in opposing it; and the prestige and influence\r\nof the Bank were such as to enable it to make a powerful fight against\r\nany attempts to annihilate it.\r\n\r\nThe second Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816 for twenty\r\nyears, with a capital of thirty-five million dollars, one-fifth of\r\nwhich had been subscribed by the Government. For some time it was not\r\nnotably successful, partly because of bad management but mainly because\r\nof the disturbance of business which the panic of 1819 had produced.\r\nFurthermore, its power over local banks and over the currency system\r\nmade it unpopular in the West and South, and certain States sought to\r\ncripple it by taxing out of existence the several branches which the\r\nboard of directors voted to establish. In two notable\r\ndecisions--M'Culloch vs. Maryland in 1819 and Osborn vs. United States\r\nBank in 1824--the Supreme Court saved the institution by denying the\r\npower of a State to impose taxation of the sort and by asserting\r\nunequivocally the right of Congress to enact the legislation upon which\r\nthe Bank rested. And after Nicholas Biddle, a Philadelphia\r\nlawyer-diplomat, succeeded Langdon Cheves as president of the Bank in\r\n1823 an era of great prosperity set in.\r\n\r\nThe forces of opposition were never reconciled; indeed, every evidence\r\nof the increasing strength of the Bank roused them to fresh hostility.\r\nThe verdict of the Supreme Court in support of the constitutionality of\r\nthe Act of 1816 carried conviction to few people who were not already\r\nconvinced. The restraints which the Bank imposed upon the dubious\r\noperations of the southern and western banks were vigorously resented.\r\nThe Bank was regarded as a great financial monopoly, an \"octopus,\" and\r\nBiddle as an autocrat bent only on dominating the entire banking and\r\ncurrency system of the country.\r\n\r\nOn Jackson's attitude toward the Bank before he became President we\r\nhave little direct information. But it is sufficiently clear that\r\neventually he came to share the hostile views of his Tennessee friends\r\nand neighbors. In 1817 he refused to sign a memorial \"got up by the\r\naristocracy of Nashville\" for the establishment of a branch in that\r\ntown. When, ten years later, such a branch was installed, General\r\nThomas Cadwalader of Philadelphia, agent of the Bank, visited the town\r\nto supervise the arrangements and became very friendly with the \"lord\r\nof the Hermitage.\" But correspondence of succeeding years, though\r\nfilled with insinuating cordiality, failed to bring out any expression\r\nof goodwill toward the institution such as the agent manifestly\r\ncoveted.\r\n\r\nJackson seems to have carried to Washington in 1829 a deep distrust of\r\nthe Bank, and he was disposed to speak out boldly against it in his\r\ninaugural address. But he was persuaded by his friends that this would\r\nbe ill-advised, and he therefore made no mention of the subject. Yet he\r\nmade no effort to conceal his attitude, for he wrote to Biddle a few\r\nmonths after the inauguration that he did not believe that Congress had\r\npower to charter a bank outside of the District of Columbia, that he\r\ndid not dislike the United States Bank more than other banks, but that\r\never since he had read the history of the South Sea Bubble he had been\r\nafraid of banks. After this confession the writer hardly needed to\r\nconfess that he was \"no economist, no financier.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the officers of the \"mother bank\" at Philadelphia and of the\r\nbranches were anti-Jackson men, and Jackson's friends put the idea into\r\nhis mind that the Bank had used its influence against him in the late\r\ncampaign. Specific charges of partizanship were brought against\r\nJeremiah Mason, president of the branch at Portsmouth, New Hampshire;\r\nand although an investigation showed the accusation to be groundless,\r\nBiddle's heated defense of the branch had no effect save to rouse the\r\nJacksonians to a firmer determination to compass the downfall of the\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nBiddle labored manfully to stem the tide. He tried to improve his\r\npersonal relations with the President, and he even allowed Jackson men\r\nto gain control of several of the western branches. The effort,\r\nhowever, was in vain. When he thought the situation right, Biddle\r\nbrought forward a plan for a new charter which received the assent of\r\nmost of the members of the official Cabinet, as well as that of some of\r\nthe \"Kitchen\" group. But Jackson met the proposal with his unshakable\r\nconstitutional objections and, to Biddle's deep disappointment,\r\nadvanced in his first annual message to the formal, public assault. The\r\nBank's charter, he reminded Congress, would expire in 1836; request for\r\na new charter would probably soon be forthcoming; the matter could not\r\nreceive too early attention from the legislative branch. \"Both the\r\nconstitutionality and the expediency of the law creating this bank,\"\r\ndeclared the President, \"are well questioned by a large portion of our\r\nfellow-citizens; and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in\r\nthe great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency.\" The first\r\npart of the statement was true, but the second was distinctly unfair.\r\nThe Bank, to be sure, had not established \"a uniform and sound\"\r\ncurrency. But it had accomplished much toward that end and was\r\npractically the only agency that was wielding any influence in that\r\ndirection. The truth is that the more efficient the Bank proved in this\r\ntask the less popular it became among those elements of the people from\r\nwhich Jackson mainly drew his strength.\r\n\r\nNothing came of the President's admonition except committee reports in\r\nthe two Houses, both favorable to the Bank; in fact, the Senate report\r\nwas copied almost verbatim from a statement supplied by Biddle. A year\r\nlater Jackson returned to the subject, this time with an alternative\r\nplan for a national bank to be organized as a branch of the Treasury\r\nand hence to have \"no means to operate on the hopes, fears, or\r\ninterests of large masses of the community.\" In a set of autograph\r\nnotes from which the second message was prepared the existing Bank was\r\ndeclared not only unconstitutional but dangerous to liberty, \"because\r\nthrough its officers, loans, and participation in politics it could\r\nbuild up or pull down parties or men, because it created a monopoly of\r\nthe money power, because much of the stock was owned by foreigners,\r\nbecause it would always support him who supported it, and because it\r\nweakened the state and strengthened the general government.\" Congress\r\npaid no attention to either criticisms or recommendations, and the\r\nsupporters of the Bank took fresh heart.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress again met, in December, 1831, a presidential election was\r\nimpending and everybody was wondering what part the bank question would\r\nplay. Most Democrats were of the opinion that the subject should be\r\nkept in the background. After all, the present bank charter had more\r\nthan four years to run, and there seemed to be no reason for injecting\r\nso thorny an issue into the campaign. With a view to keeping the bank\r\nauthorities quiet, two members of the reconstructed Cabinet, Livingston\r\nand McLane, entered into a modus vivendi with Biddle under which the\r\nAdministration agreed not to push the issue until after the election.\r\nIn his annual report as Secretary of the Treasury, McLane actually made\r\nan argument for rechartering the Bank; and in his message of the 6th of\r\nDecember the President said that, while he still held \"the opinions\r\nheretofore expressed in relation to the Bank as at present organized,\"\r\nhe would \"leave it for the present to the investigation of an\r\nenlightened people and their representatives.\" He had been persuaded\r\nthat his own plan for a Bank, suggested a year earlier, was not\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\nBiddle now made a supreme mistake. Misled in some degree unquestionably\r\nby the optimistic McLane, he got the idea that Jackson was weakening,\r\nthat the Democrats were afraid to take a stand on the subject until\r\nafter the election, and that now was the strategic time to strike for a\r\nnew charter. In this belief he was further encouraged by Clay, Webster,\r\nand other leading anti-Administration men, as well as by McDuffie, a\r\nCalhoun supporter and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the\r\nHouse. There was small doubt that a bill for a new charter could be\r\ncarried in both branches of Congress. Jackson must either sign it,\r\nargued Biddle's advisers, or run grave risk of losing Pennsylvania and\r\nother commercial States whose support was necessary to his election. On\r\nthe other hand, Biddle was repeatedly warned that an act for a new\r\ncharter would be vetoed. He chose to press the issue and on January 9,\r\n1832, the formal application of the Bank for a renewal of its charter\r\nwas presented to Congress, and within a few weeks bills to recharter\r\nwere reported in both Houses.\r\n\r\nRealizing that defeat or even a slender victory in Congress would be\r\nfatal, the Bank flooded Washington with lobbyists, and Biddle himself\r\nappeared upon the scene to lead the fight. The measure was carried by\r\nsafe majorities--in the Senate, on the 11th of June, by a vote of 28 to\r\n20, and in the House on the 3d of July, by a vote of 107 to 86. To the\r\ndismay of the bank forces, although it ought not to have been to their\r\nsurprise, Jackson was as good as his word. On the 10th of July the bill\r\nwas vetoed. The veto message as transmitted to the Senate was probably\r\nwritten by Taney, but the ideas were Jackson's--ideas which, so far as\r\nthey relate to finance and banking operations, have been properly\r\ncharacterized as \"in the main beneath contempt.\" The message, however,\r\nwas intended as a campaign document, and as such it showed great\r\ningenuity. It attacked the Bank as a monopoly, a \"hydra of corruption,\"\r\nand an instrumentality of federal encroachment on the rights of the\r\nStates, and in a score of ways appealed to the popular distrust of\r\ncapitalistic institutions. The message acquired importance, too, from\r\nthe President's extraordinary claim to the right of judging both the\r\nconstitutionality and the expediency of proposed legislation,\r\nindependently of Congress and the Courts.\r\n\r\nThe veto plunged the Senate into days of acrid debate. Clay pronounced\r\nJackson's construction of the veto power \"irreconcilable with the\r\ngenius of representative government.\" Webster declared that\r\nresponsibility for the ruin of the Bank and for the disasters that\r\nmight follow would have to be borne by the President alone. Benton and\r\nother prominent members, however, painted Jackson as the savior of his\r\ncountry; and the second vote of 22 to 19 yielded a narrower majority\r\nfor the bill than the first had done. Thus the measure perished.\r\n\r\nThe bank men received the veto with equanimity. They professed to\r\nbelieve that the balderdash in which the message abounded would make\r\nconverts for their side; they even printed thirty thousand copies of\r\nthe document for circulation. Events, however, did not sustain their\r\noptimism. In the ensuing campaign the Bank became, by its own choice,\r\nthe leading issue. The National Republicans, whose nominee was Clay,\r\ndefended the institution and attacked the veto; the Jacksonians\r\nreiterated on the stump every charge and argument that their leader had\r\ntaught them. The verdict was decisive. Jackson received 219 and Clay 49\r\nelectoral votes.\r\n\r\nThe President was unquestionably right in interpreting his triumph as\r\nan endorsement of the veto, and he naturally felt that the question was\r\nsettled. The officers and friends of the Bank still hoped, however, to\r\nsnatch victory from defeat. They had no expectation of converting\r\nJackson or of carrying a charter measure at an early date. But they\r\nforesaw that to wind up the business of the Bank in 1836 it would be\r\nnecessary to call in loans and to withdraw a vast amount of currency\r\nfrom circulation, with the result of a general disturbance, if not a\r\nsevere crippling, of business. This, they thought, would bring about an\r\neleventh-hour measure giving the Bank a new lease of life.\r\n\r\nJackson, too, realized that a sudden termination of the activities of\r\nthe Bank would derange business and produce distress, and that under\r\nthese circumstances a charter might be wrung from Congress in spite of\r\na veto. But he had no intention of allowing matters to come to such a\r\npass. His plan was rather to cut off by degrees the activities of the\r\nBank, until at last they could be suspended altogether without a shock.\r\nThe most obvious means of doing this was to withdraw the heavy deposits\r\nmade by the Government; and to this course the President fully\r\ncommitted himself as soon as the results of the election were known. He\r\nwas impelled, further, by the conviction--notwithstanding unimpeachable\r\nevidence to the contrary--that the Bank was insolvent, and by his\r\nindignation at the refusal of Biddle and his associates to accept the\r\nelectoral verdict as final. \"Biddle shan't have the public money to\r\nbreak down the public administration with. It's settled. My mind's made\r\nup.\" So the President declared to Blair early in 1833. And no one could\r\nhave any reasonable doubt that decisive action would follow threat.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, all plain sailing. Under the terms of the charter\r\nof 1816 public funds were to be deposited in the Bank and its branches\r\nunless the Secretary of the Treasury should direct that they be placed\r\nelsewhere; and such deposits elsewhere, together with actual\r\nwithdrawals, were to be reported to Congress, with reasons for such\r\naction. McLane, the Secretary of the Treasury, was friendly toward the\r\nBank and could not be expected to give the necessary orders for\r\nremoval. This meant that the first step was to get a new head for the\r\nTreasury. But McLane was too influential a man to be summarily\r\ndismissed. Hence it was arranged that Livingston should become Minister\r\nto France and that McLane should succeed him as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the new Secretary of the Treasury would have been a\r\nclever stroke if things had worked out as Jackson expected. The\r\nappointee was William J. Duane, son of the editor of the Aurora, which\r\nhad long been the most popular and influential newspaper in\r\nPennsylvania. This State was the seat of the \"mother bank\" and,\r\nalthough a Jackson stronghold, a cordial supporter of the proscribed\r\ninstitution; so that it was well worth while to forestall criticism in\r\nthat quarter, so far as might be, by having the order for removal\r\nissued by a Pennsylvanian. Duane, however, accepted the post rather\r\nbecause he coveted office than because he supported the policy of\r\nremoval, and when the test came Jackson found to his chagrin that he\r\nstill had a Secretary who would not take the desired action. There was\r\nnothing to do but procure another; and this time he made no mistake.\r\nDuane, weakly protesting, was dismissed, and Roger B. Taney, the\r\nAttorney-General, was appointed in his stead. \"I am fully prepared to\r\ngo with you firmly through this business,\" Jackson was assured by the\r\nnew Secretary, \"and to meet all its consequences.\"\r\n\r\nThe way was now clear, and an order was issued requiring all treasury\r\nreceipts after October 1, 1833, to be deposited in the Girard Bank of\r\nPhiladelphia and twenty-two other designated state banks. Deposits in\r\nthe United States Bank and its branches were not immediately \"removed\";\r\nthey were left, rather, to be withdrawn as the money was actually\r\nneeded. Nevertheless there was considerable disturbance of business,\r\nand deputation after deputation came to the White House to ask that\r\nTaney's order be rescinded. Jackson, however, was sure that most of the\r\ntrouble was caused by Biddle and his associates, and to all these\r\nappeals he remained absolutely deaf. After a time he refused so much as\r\nto see the petitioners. In his message of the 3d of December he assumed\r\nfull responsibility for the removals, defending his course mainly on\r\nthe ground that the Bank had been \"actively engaged in attempting to\r\ninfluence the elections of the public officers by means of its money.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this point the question became entirely one of politics. The Bank\r\nitself was doomed. On the one side, the National Republicans united in\r\nthe position that the Administration had been entirely in the wrong,\r\nand that the welfare of the country demanded a great fiscal institution\r\nof the character of the Bank. On the other side, the Democrats,\r\nderiving, indeed, a new degree of unity from the controversy on this\r\nissue, upheld the President's every word and act. \"You may continue,\"\r\nsaid Benton to his fellow partizans in the Senate, \"to be for a bank\r\nand for Jackson, but you cannot be for this Bank and Jackson.\" Firmly\r\nallied with the Bank interests, the National Republicans resolved to\r\nbring all possible discomfiture upon the Administration.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was controlled by the Democrats, and\r\nlittle could be accomplished there. But the Senate contained not only\r\nthe three ablest anti-Jacksonians of the day--Clay, Webster,\r\nCalhoun--but an absolute majority of anti-Administration men; and there\r\nthe attack was launched. On December 26, 1833, Clay introduced two\r\nresolutions declaring that in the removal of the deposits the President\r\nhad \"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the\r\nConstitution and laws but in derogation of both,\" and pronouncing\r\nTaney's statement of reasons \"unsatisfactory and insufficient.\" After a\r\nstormy debate, both resolutions in slightly amended form were carried\r\nby substantial majorities.\r\n\r\nJackson was not in the habit of meekly swallowing censure, and on the\r\n15th of April he sent to the Senate a formal protest, characterizing\r\nthe action of the body as \"unauthorized by the Constitution, contrary\r\nto its spirit and to several of its express provisions,\" and\r\n\"subversive of that distribution of the powers of government which it\r\nhas ordained and established.\" Aside from a general defense of his\r\ncourse, the chief point that the President made was that the\r\nConstitution provided a procedure in cases of this kind, namely\r\nimpeachment, which alone could be properly resorted to if the\r\nlegislative branch desired to bring charges against the Executive. The\r\nSenate was asked respectfully to spread the protest on its records.\r\nThis, however, it refused to do. On the contrary, it voted that the\r\nright of protest could not be recognized; and it found additional\r\nsatisfaction in negativing an unusual number of the President's\r\nnominations.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remainder of his second Administration Jackson\r\nmaintained his hold upon the country and kept firm control in the lower\r\nbranch of Congress. Until very near the end, the Senate, however,\r\ncontinued hostile. During the debate on the protest Benton served\r\nnotice that he would introduce, at each succeeding session, a motion to\r\nexpunge the resolution of censure. Such a motion was made in 1835, and\r\nagain in 1836, without result. But at last, in January, 1837, after a\r\ndebate lasting thirteen hours, the Senate adopted, by a vote of 24 to\r\n19, a resolution meeting the Jacksonian demand.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript journal of the session of 1833-1834 was brought into the\r\nSenate, and the secretary, in obedience to the resolution, drew black\r\nlines around the resolution of censure, and wrote across the face\r\nthereof, \"in strong letters,\" the words: \"Expunged by order of the\r\nSenate, this sixteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord 1837.\"\r\nMany members withdrew rather than witness the proceeding; but a crowded\r\ngallery looked on, while Benton strengthened his supporters by\r\nproviding \"an ample supply of cold hams, turkeys, rounds of beef,\r\npickles, wines, and cups of hot coffee\" in a near-by committee-room.\r\nJackson gave a dinner to the \"expungers\" and their wives, and placed\r\nBenton at the head of the table. That the action of the Senate was\r\nunconstitutional interested no one save the lawyers, for the Bank was\r\ndead. Jackson was vindicated, and the people were enthroned. π\r\n\r\nπ MacDonald, Jacksonian Democracy, p. 239.\r\n\r\nThe struggle thus brought to a triumphant close was one of the severest\r\nin American political history. In 1836 the Bank obtained a charter from\r\nPennsylvania, under the name of the Bank of the United States of\r\nPennsylvania, and all connection between it and the Federal Government\r\nceased. The institution and the controversies centering about it left,\r\nhowever, a deep impress upon the financial and political history of our\r\nfifth and sixth decades. It was the bank issue, more than anything\r\nelse, that consolidated the new political parties of the period. It was\r\nthat issue that proved most conclusively the hold of Jackson upon\r\npublic opinion. And it was the destruction of the Bank that capped the\r\nmid-century reaction against the rampant nationalism of the decade\r\nsucceeding the War of 1812. The Bank itself had been well managed,\r\nsound, and of great service to the country. But it had also showed\r\nstrong monopolistic tendencies, and as a powerful capitalistic\r\norganization it ran counter to the principles and prejudices which\r\nformed the very warp and woof of Jacksonian democracy.\r\n\r\nFor more than a decade after the Bank was destroyed the United States\r\nhad a troubled financial history. The payment of the last dollar of the\r\nnational debt in 1834 gave point to a suggestion which Clay had\r\nrepeatedly offered that, as a means of avoiding an embarrassing\r\nsurplus, the proceeds of the sales of public lands should be\r\ndistributed according to population among the States. One bill on this\r\nsubject was killed by a veto in 1832, but another was finally approved\r\nin 1836. Before distribution could be carried far, however, the country\r\nwas overtaken by the panic of 1837; and never again was there a surplus\r\nto distribute. For seven years the funds of the Government continued to\r\nbe kept in state banks, until, in 1840, President Van Buren prevailed\r\nupon Congress to pass a measure setting up an independent treasury\r\nsystem, thereby realizing the ultimate purpose of the Jacksonians to\r\ndivorce the Government from banks of every sort. When the Whigs came\r\ninto power in 1841, they promptly abolished the independent Treasury\r\nwith a view to resurrecting the United States Bank. Tyler's vetoes,\r\nhowever, frustrated their designs, and it remained for the Democrats in\r\n1846 to revive the independent Treasury and to organize it\r\nsubstantially as it operates today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nTHE REMOVAL OF THE SOUTHERN INDIANS\r\n\r\nIt was not by chance that the Jacksonian period made large contribution\r\nto the working out of the ultimate relations of the red man with his\r\nwhite rival and conqueror. Jackson was himself an old frontier soldier,\r\nwho never doubted that it was part of the natural order of things that\r\nconflict between the two peoples should go on until the weaker was\r\ndispossessed or exterminated. The era was one in which the West guided\r\npublic policy; and it was the West that was chiefly interested in\r\nfurther circumscribing Indian lands, trade, and influence. In Jackson's\r\nday, too, the people ruled; and it was the adventurous, pushing,\r\nland-hungry common folk who decreed that the red man had lingered long\r\nenough in the Middle West and must now move on.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the white population upon the Indian lands was felt\r\nboth in the Northwest and in the Southwest; but the pressure was\r\nunevenly applied in the two sections. North of the Ohio there was\r\nsimply one great glacier-like advance of the white settlers, driving\r\nwestward before it practically all of the natives who did not perish in\r\nthe successive attempts to roll back the wave of conquest upon the\r\nAlleghanies. The redskins were pushed from Ohio into Indiana, from\r\nIndiana into Illinois, from Illinois and Wisconsin into Iowa and\r\nMinnesota; the few tribal fragments which by treaty arrangement\r\nremained behind formed only insignificant \"islands\" in the midst of the\r\nfast-growing flood of white population.\r\n\r\nIn the South the great streams of migration were those that flowed down\r\nthe Ohio, filling the back lands on each side, and thence down the\r\nMississippi to its mouth. Hence, instead of pressing the natives\r\nsteadily backward from a single direction, as in the North, the whites\r\nhemmed them in on east, west, and north; while to the southward the\r\nGulf presented a relentless barrier. Powerful and populous tribes were\r\nleft high and dry in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama--peoples who in\r\ntheir day of necessity could hope to find new homes only by long\r\nmigrations past the settled river districts that lay upon their western\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nOf these encircled tribes, four were of chief importance: the Creeks,\r\nthe Cherokees, the Choctaws, and the Chickasaws. In 1825 the Creeks\r\nnumbered twenty thousand, and held between five and six million acres\r\nof land in western Georgia and eastern Alabama. The Cherokees numbered\r\nabout nine thousand and had even greater areas, mainly in northwestern\r\nGeorgia, but to some extent also in northeastern Alabama and\r\nsoutheastern Tennessee. The Choctaws, numbering twenty-one thousand,\r\nand the Chickasaws, numbering thirty-six hundred, together held upwards\r\nof sixteen million acres in Mississippi--approximately the northern\r\nhalf of the State--and a million and a quarter acres in western\r\nAlabama. The four peoples thus numbered fifty-three thousand souls, and\r\nheld ancestral lands aggregating over thirty-three million acres, or\r\nnearly the combined area of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they were no longer savages. The Creeks were the lowest in\r\ncivilization; but even they had become more settled and less warlike\r\nsince their chastisement by Jackson in 1814. The Choctaws and\r\nChickasaws lived in frame houses, cultivated large stretches of land,\r\noperated workshops and mills, maintained crude but orderly governments,\r\nand were gradually accepting Christianity. Most advanced of all were\r\nthe Cherokees. As one writer has described them, they \"had horses and\r\ncattle, goats, sheep, and swine. They raised maize, cotton, tobacco,\r\nwheat, oats, and potatoes, and traded with their products to New\r\nOrleans. They had gardens, and apple and peach orchards. They had built\r\nroads, and they kept inns for travelers. They manufactured cotton and\r\nwool. . . . One of their number had invented an alphabet for their\r\nlanguage. They had a civil government, imitated from that of the United\r\nStates.\" Under these improved conditions all of the tribes were growing\r\nin numbers and acquiring vested rights which it would be increasingly\r\ndifficult to deny or to disregard.\r\n\r\nA good while before Jackson entered the White House the future of these\r\nlarge, settled, and prosperous groups of red men began to trouble the\r\npeople of Georgia, Alabama, and other Southern States. The Indians made\r\nbut little use of the major part of their land; vast tracts lay\r\nuntrodden save by hunters. Naturally, as the white population grew and\r\nthe lands open for settlement became scarcer and poorer, the rich\r\ntribal holdings were looked upon with covetous eyes. In the decade\r\nfollowing the War of 1812, when cotton cultivation was spreading\r\nrapidly over the southern interior, the demand that they be thrown open\r\nfor occupation to white settlers became almost irresistible.\r\n\r\nThree things, obviously, could happen. The tribes could be allowed to\r\nretain permanently their great domains, while the white population\r\nflowed in around them; or the lands could be opened to the whites under\r\nterms looking to a peaceful intermingling of the two peoples; or the\r\ntribes could be induced or compelled to move en masse to new homes\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. The third plan was the only one ever considered\r\nby most people to be feasible, although it offered great difficulties\r\nand was carried out only after many delays.\r\n\r\nThe State which felt the situation most keenly was Georgia, partly\r\nbecause there an older and denser population pressed more eagerly for\r\nnew lands, partly--it must be admitted--because lands obtained by\r\ncession were, under the practice of that State, distributed among the\r\npeople by lottery. The first move in this direction was to dispossess\r\nthe Creeks. As far back as 1802, when Georgia made her final cession of\r\nwestern lands to United States, the latter agreed to extinguish the\r\nIndian title to lands within the State whenever it could be done\r\n\"peaceably and on reasonable terms.\" This pledge the Georgians never\r\nallowed the federal authorities to forget. After 1815 several large\r\ntracts were liberated. But by that date the State wanted unbroken\r\njurisdiction over all of the territory within her limits, and her\r\ncomplaints of laxness on the part of the Federal Government in bringing\r\nthis about became no less frequent than vigorous.\r\n\r\nNear the close of his Administration President Monroe sent two\r\ncommissioners to procure a general cession; and at Indian Spring a\r\ntreaty was concluded in which the Creeks ceded practically all of their\r\nlands between the Flint and the Chattahoochee rivers. The Senate\r\nratified the treaty, and the Georgians were elated. But investigation\r\nshowed that the Creeks who stood behind the agreement represented only\r\nan insignificant fraction of the nation, and President Adams refused to\r\nallow Troup, the irate Georgian Governor, to proceed with the intended\r\noccupation until further negotiations should have taken place. Stormy\r\nexchanges of views followed, in the course of which the Governor more\r\nthan once reminded Adams that Georgia was \"sovereign on her own soil.\"\r\nBut in 1826 and 1827 treaties were obtained finally extinguishing Creek\r\ntitles in the State. Land west of the Mississippi was promised to all\r\nCreeks who would go there.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Cherokees was more difficult. By a series of\r\ntreaties beginning in 1785 the United States had recognized this people\r\nas a nation, capable of making peace and war, of owning the lands\r\nwithin its boundaries, and of governing and punishing its own citizens\r\nby its own laws. At the close of Jefferson's second Administration the\r\ntribe seriously considered moving west of the Mississippi, and shortly\r\nafter the War of 1812 most of the northern members resident in\r\nTennessee took the long-deferred step. The refusal of the Georgia\r\nmembers to go with the Tenneseeans disappointed the land-hungry whites,\r\nand from that time the authorities of the State labored incessantly\r\nboth to break down the notion that the Cherokees were a \"nation\" to be\r\ndealt with through diplomatic channels, and to extend over them, in\r\neffect, the full sovereignty of the State. In December, 1828, the\r\nLegislature took the bold step of enacting that all white persons in\r\nthe Cherokee territory should be subject to the laws of Georgia; that\r\nafter June 1, 1830, all Indians resident in this territory should be\r\nsubject to such laws as might be prescribed for them by the State; and\r\nthat after this date all laws made by the Cherokee Government should be\r\nnull and void.\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson became President he found on his desk a vigorous protest\r\nagainst this drastic piece of legislation. But appeal to him was\r\nuseless. He was on record as believing, in common with most\r\nsouthwesterners, that Georgia had a rightful jurisdiction over her\r\nIndian lands; and his Secretary of War, Eaton, was instructed to say to\r\nthe Cherokee representatives that their people would be expected either\r\nto yield to Georgia's authority or to remove beyond the Mississippi. In\r\nhis first annual message, on December 8, 1829, the President set forth\r\nthe principles that guided him from first to last in dealing with the\r\nIndian problem. It would be greatly to the interest of the Indians\r\nthemselves, he said, to remove to the ample lands that would be set\r\napart for them permanently in the West, where each tribe could have its\r\nown home and its own government, subject to no control by the United\r\nStates except for the maintenance of peace on the frontier and among\r\nthe tribes. Forcible removal was not to be contemplated; that would be\r\ncruel and unjust. But every effort was to be made to bring about a\r\nvoluntary migration. One thing was to be clearly understood: any tribe\r\nor group that chose to remain in Georgia must submit to the laws of the\r\nState and yield its claim to all land which had not been improved. The\r\nPresident was not indifferent to the well-being of the red men; but he\r\nrefused to recognize the Cherokees as a \"nation\" having \"rights\" as\r\nagainst either Georgia or the United States. A few weeks after the\r\nmessage was received Congress passed a bill creating an Indian\r\nreservation beyond the Mississippi and appropriating five hundred\r\nthousand dollars to aid in the removal of such Indians as should choose\r\nto accept the offer of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the Cherokees was now dark. Both the executive and\r\nlegislative branches of the Federal Government were committed to a\r\npolicy which offered only the alternatives of removal or subjection;\r\nand, thus encouraged, the Georgia Legislature voted to proceed with the\r\nextension of the full authority of the State over both the Cherokees\r\nand the Creeks after June 1, 1830. To make matters worse, the discovery\r\nof gold in the northeastern corner of the State in 1829 brought down\r\nupon the Cherokee lands a horde of scrambling, lawless fortune seekers,\r\nnumbered already in 1830 by the thousand. None the less, the Cherokee\r\nopposition stiffened. The Indian legislative council voted that all who\r\naccepted lands beyond the Mississippi and settled on them should\r\nforfeit their tribal membership, that those who sold their individual\r\nproperty to emigrate should be flogged, and that those who voted to\r\nsell a part or all of the tribal possessions should be put to death.\r\n\r\nOne resource remained to be exhausted in defense of the Indian claims;\r\nthis was the courts. But here again things went unfavorably. After many\r\ndelays a test case, Cherokee Nation vs. State of Georgia, was placed\r\nupon the docket of the Supreme Court. The bill set forth the plaintiff\r\nto be \"the Cherokee Nation of Indians, a foreign State, not owning\r\nallegiance to the United States, nor to any State of this union, nor to\r\nany prince, potentate, or State other than their own,\" and it asked\r\nthat the Court declare null the Georgia Acts of 1828 and 1829 and\r\nenjoin the Georgia officials from interfering with Cherokee lands,\r\nmines, and other property, or with the persons of Cherokees on account\r\nof anything done by them within the Cherokee territory. The Indians\r\nwere represented before the Court by two attorneys, one of them being\r\nWilliam Wirt; Georgia employed no counsel. The opinion of the Court as\r\nannounced at the January term, 1831, by Chief Justice Marshall was that\r\nwhile the Cherokee nation was a State and had uniformly been dealt with\r\nas such by the Federal Government since 1789, it was not a \"foreign\r\nState\" within the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore was not\r\nentitled to sue in that character in the courts of the United States.\r\n\"If it be true,\" the decision concluded, \"that wrongs have been\r\ninflicted and that still greater are to be apprehended, this is not the\r\ntribunal which can redress the past or prevent the future. The motion\r\nfor an injunction is denied.\"\r\n\r\nThe case was thus thrown out of court. Yet the Cherokees were\r\nrecognized as a \"domestic, dependent\" nation, and there was nothing in\r\nthe decision to indicate that the extension of the laws of Georgia over\r\nthem was valid and constitutional. Indeed, in a second case that came\r\nup shortly, Worcester vs. State of Georgia, the Court strongly backed\r\nup the Indians' contention. Worcester was a Presbyterian missionary who\r\nwas imprisoned for violation of a Georgia statute forbidding white\r\npersons to reside in the Cherokee territory without a license. The case\r\nwas appealed to the Supreme Court, and in the decision of March 10,\r\n1832, Marshall affirmed the status of the Cherokees as a \"nation\"\r\nwithin whose territory \"the laws of Georgia can have no force, and\r\nwhich the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter but with the\r\nassent of the Cherokees themselves or in conformity with treaties and\r\nwith the acts of Congress.\" The statute was accordingly declared to be\r\nunconstitutional and Worcester was ordered to be discharged.\r\n\r\nThis ought to have been enough to protect the Cherokees in their\r\nrights. But it was not, and for two reasons: the contempt of Georgia\r\nfor the Court's opinions, and the refusal of Jackson to restrain the\r\nState in its headstrong course. Already the state authorities had\r\nrefused to take notice of a writ of error to the Supreme Court sued out\r\nin December, 1830, in behalf of a condemned Cherokee, Corn Tassel, and\r\nhad permitted the execution of the unfortunate redskin. The state court\r\nnow refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of Worcester,\r\nand the prisoner was held--precisely as if the law under which he was\r\nconvicted had been pronounced constitutional--until he was pardoned by\r\nthe Governor a year later.\r\n\r\nThis action on the part of the State was, of course, nothing less than\r\nnullification. Yet Jackson did not lift a finger. \"John Marshall has\r\nmade his decision,\" he is reported to have said; \"now let him enforce\r\nit.\" The South Carolinians were quick to seize upon the inconsistencies\r\nof the situation. Nullification in their State was apparently one\r\nthing; in Georgia, quite another. The very fact, however, that the\r\nGeorgians had successfully defied the federal Supreme Court did much to\r\nencourage their neighbors in a course of similar boldness. Jackson's\r\nleniency toward Georgia has never been wholly explained. He was\r\nundoubtedly influenced by his sympathy with the purpose of the State to\r\nestablish its jurisdiction over all lands within its borders.\r\nFurthermore he cherished an antipathy for Marshall which even led him\r\nto refuse in 1835 to attend a memorial meeting in the great jurist's\r\nhonor. But these considerations do not wholly cover the case. All that\r\nthe historian can say is that the President chose to take notice of the\r\nthreats and acts of South Carolina and to ignore the threats and acts\r\nof Georgia, without ever being troubled by the inconsistency of his\r\ncourse. His political career affords many such illustrations of the\r\narbitrary and even erratic character of his mind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great Indian migration was setting in. Emulating the\r\nexample of Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi extended their laws over\r\nall of the Indian lands within their boundaries; and in all parts of\r\nthe South the red folk--some of them joyously, but most of them\r\nsorrowfully--prepared to take up their long journey. In 1832 the Creeks\r\nyielded to the United States all of their remaining lands east of the\r\nMississippi. By the spring of 1833 the Choctaws and Chickasaws had done\r\nthe same thing and were on their way westward. Only the Cherokees\r\nremained, and in his message of December 3, 1833, Jackson reiterated\r\nhis earlier arguments for their removal. Realizing that further\r\nresistance was useless, a portion of the tribe signified its readiness\r\nto go. The remainder, however, held out, and it was only at the close\r\nof 1835 that the long-desired treaty of cession could be secured. All\r\nCherokee lands east of the Mississippi were now relinquished to the\r\nUnited States, which agreed to pay five million dollars for them, to\r\nprovide an adequate home in the new Indian Territory created by\r\nCongress during the preceding year, and to bear all the costs of\r\nremoving the tribe thither.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone the South, however, that witnessed widespread\r\ndisplacements of Indian populations in the Jacksonian period. How the\r\nBlack Hawk War of 1832 grew out of, and in turn led to, removals in the\r\nremoter Northwest has been related in another volume in this series. π\r\nAnd, in almost every western State, surviving Indian titles were\r\nrapidly extinguished. Between 1829 and 1837 ninety-four Indian\r\ntreaties, most of them providing for transfers of territory, were\r\nconcluded; and before Jackson went out of office he was able to report\r\nto Congress that, \"with the exception of two small bands living in Ohio\r\nand Indiana, not exceeding fifteen hundred persons, and of the\r\nCherokees, all of the tribes on the east side of the Mississippi, and\r\nextending from Lake Michigan to Florida, have entered into engagements\r\nwhich will lead to their transplantation.\" With little delay the\r\nCherokees, too, were added to this list, although a group of\r\nirreconcilables resisted until 1838, when they were forcibly ejected by\r\na contingent of United States troops under General Winfield Scott.\r\n\r\nπ See The Old Northwest, by Frederic Austin Ogg (in The Chronicles of\r\nAmerica).\r\n\r\nAll of this was done not without strong protest from other people\r\nbesides the Indians. Some who objected did so for political effect.\r\nWhen Clay and Calhoun, for example, thundered in the Senate against the\r\nremoval treaties, they were merely seeking to discredit the\r\nAdministration; both held views on Indian policy which were\r\nsubstantially the same as Jackson's. But there was also objection on\r\nhumanitarian grounds; and the Society of Friends and other religious\r\nbodies engaged in converting and educating the southern tribes used all\r\npossible influence to defeat the plan of removal. On the whole,\r\nhowever, the country approved what was being done. People felt that the\r\nfurther presence of large, organized bodies of natives in the midst of\r\na rapidly growing white population, and of tribes setting themselves up\r\nas quasi-independent nations within the bounds of the States, was an\r\nanomaly that could not last; and they considered that, distressing as\r\nwere many features of the removals, both white man and red man would\r\nultimately be better off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE JACKSONIAN SUCCESSION\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang General Jackson,\" exclaimed Fanny Kemble one day, after\r\ndinner, in the cabin of the ship that brought her, in the summer of\r\n1832, to the United States. Even before she set foot on our shores, the\r\nbrilliant English actress was tired of the din of politics and bored by\r\nthe incessant repetition of the President's name. Subsequently she was\r\npresented at the White House and had an opportunity to form her own\r\nopinion of the \"monarch\" whose name and deeds were on everybody's lips;\r\nand the impression was by no means unfavorable. \"Very tall and thin he\r\nwas,\" says her journal, \"but erect and dignified; a good specimen of a\r\nfine old, well-battered soldier; his manners perfectly simple and\r\nquiet, and, therefore, very good.\"\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that the name of Jackson was heard wherever men and women\r\ncongregated in 1832! Something more than half of the people of the\r\ncountry were at the moment trying to elect the General to a second term\r\nas President, and something less than half were putting forth their\r\nbest efforts to prevent such a \"calamity.\" Three years of Jacksonian\r\nrule had seen the civil service revolutionized, the Cabinet banished\r\nfrom its traditional place in the governmental system, and the conduct\r\nof the executive branch given a wholly new character and bent. Internal\r\nimprovements had been checked by the Maysville Road veto. The United\r\nStates Bank had been given a blow, through another veto, which sent it\r\nstaggering. Political fortunes had been made and unmade by a wave of\r\nthe President's hand. The first attempt of a State to put the stability\r\nof the Union to the test had brought the Chief Executive dramatically\r\ninto the rÙle of defender of the nation's dignity and perpetuity. No\r\nprevious President had so frequently challenged the attention of the\r\npublic; none had kept himself more continuously in the forefront of\r\npolitical controversy.\r\n\r\nFrail health and close application to official duties prevented Jackson\r\nfrom traveling extensively during his eight years in the White House.\r\nHe saw the Hermitage but once in this time, and on but one occasion did\r\nhe venture far from the capital. This was in the summer of 1833, when\r\nhe toured the Middle States and New England northward as far as\r\nConcord, New Hampshire. Accompanied by Van Buren, Lewis Cass, Levi\r\nWoodbury, and other men of prominence, the President set off from\r\nWashington in early June. At Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and\r\nintervening cities the party was received with all possible\r\ndemonstrations of regard. Processions moved through crowded streets;\r\nartillery thundered salutes; banquet followed banquet; the enthusiasm\r\nof the masses was unrestrained. At New York the furnishings of the\r\nhotel suite occupied by the President were eventually auctioned off as\r\nmementoes of the occasion.\r\n\r\nNew England was, in the main, enemy country. None the less, the\r\nPresident was received there with unstinted goodwill. Edward Everett\r\nsaid that only two other men had ever been welcomed in Boston as\r\nJackson was. They were Washington and La Fayette. The President's\r\ndetermined stand against nullification was fresh in mind, and the\r\npeople, regardless of party, were not slow to express their\r\nappreciation. Their cordiality was fully reciprocated. \"He is amazingly\r\ntickled with the Yankees,\" reports a fellow traveler more noted for\r\nveracity than for elegance of speech, \"and the more he sees on 'em, the\r\nbetter he likes 'em. 'No nullification here,' says he. 'No,' says I,\r\n'General; Mr. Calhoun would stand no more chance down east than a\r\nstumped-tail bull in fly time.'\"\r\n\r\nTo the infinite disgust of John Quincy Adams, Harvard University\r\nconferred upon the distinguished visitor the honorary degree of doctor\r\nof laws. In the course of the ceremony one of the seniors delivered, in\r\nLatin, a salutatory concluding with the words: \"Harvard welcomes\r\nJackson the President. She embraces Jackson the Patriot.\" \"A splendid\r\ncompliment, sir, a splendid compliment,\" declared the honored guest\r\nafter Woodbury had translated the phrases for his benefit; \"but why\r\ntalk about so live a thing as patriotism in a dead language?\" At the\r\nclose of the exercises the students filed past the President and were\r\nintroduced to him, each greeting him, \"to the infinite edification and\r\namusement of the grizzly old warrior,\" by his new title Doctor Jackson.\r\nThe wits of the opposition lost no opportunity to poke fun at the\r\nPresident's accession to the brotherhood of scholars. As he was closing\r\na speech some days later an auditor called out, \"You must give them a\r\nlittle Latin, Doctor.\" In nowise abashed, the President solemnly doffed\r\nhis hat again, stepped to the front of the platform, and resumed: \"E\r\npluribus unum, my friends, sine qua non!\"\r\n\r\nLife at the White House, as one writer has remarked, lost under Jackson\r\nsomething of the good form of the Virginia rÈgime, but it lost nothing\r\nof the air of domesticity. Throughout the two Administrations the\r\nmistress of the mansion was Mrs. Andrew Jackson Donelson, wife of the\r\nPresident's secretary and in every respect a very capable woman. Of\r\nformality there was little or none. Major Lewis was a member of the\r\npresidential household, and other intimates--Van Buren, Kendall, Blair,\r\nHill--dropped in at anytime, \"before breakfast, or in the evening, as\r\ninclination prompted.\" The President was always accessible to callers,\r\nwhether or not their business was important. Yet he found much time,\r\nespecially in the evenings, for the enjoyment of his long reed pipe\r\nwith red clay bowl, in the intimacy of the White House living room,\r\nwith perhaps a Cabinet officer to read dispatches or other state papers\r\nto him in a corner, while the ladies sewed and chatted and half a dozen\r\nchildren played about the room.\r\n\r\nSocial affairs there were, of course. But they were simple enough to\r\nplease the most ardent Jeffersonian--much too simple to please people\r\naccustomed to somewhat rigorous etiquette. Thus George Bancroft, who\r\nhad the reputation of being one of Washington's most punctilious\r\ngentlemen, thought well of Jackson's character but very poorly of his\r\nlevees. In describing a White House reception which he attended in\r\n1831, he wrote:\r\n\r\nThe old man stood in the center of a little circle, about large enough\r\nfor a cotillion, and shook hands with everybody that offered. The\r\nnumber of ladies who attended was small; nor were they brilliant. But\r\nto compensate for it there was a throng of apprentices, boys of all\r\nages, men not civilized enough to walk about the room with their hats\r\noff; the vilest promiscuous medley that ever was congregated in a\r\ndecent house; many of the lowest gathering round the doors, pouncing\r\nwith avidity upon the wine and refreshments, tearing the cake with the\r\nravenous keenness of intense hunger; starvelings, and fellows with\r\ndirty faces and dirty manners; all the refuse that Washington could\r\nturn forth from its workshops and stables.\r\n\r\nThe \"people\" still ruled. Yet it was only the public receptions that\r\npresented such scenes of disorder. The dinners which the President\r\noccasionally gave were well appointed. A Philadelphia gentleman who was\r\nonce invited to the White House with two or three friends testifies\r\nthat \"the dinner was very neat and served in excellent taste, while the\r\nwines were of the choicest qualities. The President himself dined on\r\nthe simplest fare: bread, milk, and vegetables.\"\r\n\r\nJackson was never a rich man, and throughout his stay in the White\r\nHouse he found it no easy matter to make ends meet. He entertained his\r\npersonal friends and official guests royally. He lavished hospitality\r\nupon the general public, sometimes spending as much as a thousand or\r\nfifteen hundred dollars on a single levee. He drew a sharp line between\r\npersonal and public expenditures, and met out of his own pocket outlays\r\nthat under administrations both before and after were charged to the\r\npublic account. He loaned many thousands of dollars, in small amounts,\r\nto needy friends, to old comrades in arms, and especially to widows and\r\norphans of his soldiery and of his political supporters; and a large\r\nproportion of these debts he not only never collected but actually\r\nforgot. Receipts from the Hermitage farm during his years of absence\r\nwere small, and fire in 1834 made necessary a rebuilding of the family\r\nresidence at considerable cost. The upshot was that when, in 1837, the\r\nGeneral was preparing to leave Washington, he had to scrape together\r\nevery available dollar in cash, and in addition pledge the cotton crop\r\nof his plantation six months ahead for a loan of six thousand dollars,\r\nin order to pay the bills outstanding against him in the capital.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the country came to the election of 1836. From the time of\r\nVan Buren's withdrawal from the Cabinet in 1831 to become, with\r\nJackson's full approval, a candidate for the vice presidency, there\r\nnever was doubt that the New Yorker would be the Democratic\r\npresidential nominee in 1836, or that his election would mean a\r\ncontinuation, in most respects, of the Jacksonian rÈgime. Never did a\r\nPresident more clearly pick his successor. There was, of course, some\r\nprotest within the party. Van Buren was not popular, and it required\r\nall of the personal and official influence that the President could\r\nbring to bear, backed up by judicious use of the patronage, to carry\r\nhis program through. At that, his own State rebelled and, through a\r\nresolution of the Legislature, put itself behind the candidacy of\r\nSenator Hugh L. White. The bold actions of his second Administration,\r\ndefiant alike of precedent and opposition, had alienated many of the\r\nPresident's more intelligent and conservative followers. Yet the\r\nallegiance of the masses was unshaken; and when the Democratic\r\nconvention assembled at Baltimore in May, 1835,--a year and a half\r\nbefore the election--the nomination of Van Buren was secured without a\r\ndissenting vote. There was no need to adopt a platform; everybody\r\nunderstood that Jackson's policies were the platform, and that Jackson\r\nhimself was as truly before the electorate as if he had been a\r\ncandidate for a third term. In his letter of acceptance Van Buren met\r\nall expectations by declaring his purpose \"to tread generally in the\r\nfootsteps of President Jackson.\"\r\n\r\nThe anti-Administration forces entered the campaign with no flattering\r\nprospects. Since 1832 their opposition to \"executive usurpation\" had\r\nwon for them a new party name, \"Whig.\" But neither their opposition nor\r\nany other circumstance had given them party solidarity. National\r\nRepublicans, anti-Masons, converted Jacksonians, state rights men--upon\r\nwhat broad and constructive platform could they hope to unite? They had\r\nno lack of able presidential aspirants. There was Clay, the National\r\nRepublican candidate in 1832; there was Webster, of whom Jackson once\r\nsaid that he would never be President because he was \"too far east,\r\nknows too much, and is too honest\"; and there were lesser lights, such\r\nas Judge John McLean. But, again, how could the many discordant groups\r\nbe rallied to the support of any single leader?\r\n\r\nJackson predicted in 1834 that his opponents would nominate William\r\nHenry Harrison, because \"they have got to take up a soldier; they have\r\ntried orators enough.\" The prophecy was a shrewd one, and in 1840 it\r\nwas fulfilled to the letter. Upon the present occasion, however, the\r\nleaders decided to place no single nominee in the field, but rather to\r\nbring forward a number of candidates who could be expected to develop\r\nlocal strength and so to split the vote as to throw the final choice\r\ninto the House of Representatives. This seemed the only hope of\r\ncircumventing Van Buren's election. Four sectional candidates entered\r\nthe race: Webster was backed by New England; the Northwest united on\r\nHarrison; the Southwest joined the Tennessee revolters in support of\r\nWhite; Ohio had her own candidate in the person of McLean.\r\n\r\nThe plan was ingenious, but it did not work. Van Buren received 170\r\nelectoral votes against 124 in spite of his opponents. He carried\r\nfifteen of the twenty-six States, including four in New England.\r\nHarrison received 73 votes, White 26 (including those of Tennessee),\r\nand Webster 14. South Carolina refused to support any of the candidates\r\non either side and threw away her votes on W.P. Mangum of North\r\nCarolina. The Democrats kept control of both branches of Congress.\r\n\r\nVictory, therefore, rested with the Jacksonians--which means with\r\nJackson himself. The Democrats would have control of both the executive\r\nand legislative branches of the Government for some years to come; the\r\nBank would not soon be re-chartered; the veto power would remain\r\nintact; federal expenditure upon internal improvements had been curbed,\r\nand the \"American system\" had been checked; the national debt was\r\ndischarged and revenue was superabundant; Jackson could look back over\r\nthe record of his Administrations with pride and forward to the rule of\r\n\"Little Van\" with satisfaction. \"When I review the arduous\r\nadministration through which I have passed,\" declared the President\r\nsoon after the results of the election were made known, \"the formidable\r\nopposition, to its very close, of the combined talents, wealth, and\r\npower of the whole aristocracy of the United States, aided as it is by\r\nthe moneyed monopolies of the whole country with their corrupting\r\ninfluence, with which we had to contend, I am truly thankful to my God\r\nfor this happy result.\"\r\n\r\nCongress met on the 5th of December for the closing session of the\r\nAdministration. The note of victory pervaded the President's message.\r\nYet there was one more triumph to be won: the resolution of censure\r\nvoted by the Senate in 1834 was still officially on the record book.\r\nNow it was that Benton finally procured the passage of his expunging\r\nresolution, although not until both branches of Congress had been\r\ndragged into controversy more personal and acrid, if possible, than any\r\nin the past eight years. The action taken was probably\r\nunconstitutional. But Jackson's \"honor\" was vindicated, and that was\r\nall that he and his friends saw, or cared to see, in the proceeding.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1831 the President conceived the idea of issuing a farewell\r\naddress to the people upon the eve of his retirement; and a few weeks\r\nbefore the election of Van Buren he sent to Taney a list of subjects\r\nwhich he proposed to touch upon in the document, requesting him to\r\n\"throw on paper\" his ideas concerning them. The address was issued on\r\nMarch 4, 1837, and followed closely the copy subsequently found in\r\nTaney's handwriting in the Jackson manuscripts. Its contents were\r\nthoroughly commonplace, being indeed hardly more than a rÈsumÈ of the\r\neight annual messages; and it might well have been dismissed as the\r\namiable musings of a garrulous old man. But nothing associated with the\r\nname of Jackson ever failed to stir controversy. The Whigs ridiculed\r\nthe egotism which underlay the palpable imitation of Washington.\r\n\"Happily,\" said the New York American, \"it is the last humbug which the\r\nmischievous popularity of this illiterate, violent, vain, and\r\niron-willed soldier can impose upon a confiding and credulous people.\"\r\nThe Democrats, however, lauded the address, praised the wisdom and\r\nsincerity of its author, and laid away among their most valued\r\nmementoes the white satin copies which admiring friends scattered\r\nbroadcast over the country.\r\n\r\nShowered with evidences of undiminished popularity, the General came\r\ndown to his last day in office. One enthusiast sent him a light wagon\r\nmade entirely of hickory sticks with the bark upon them. Another\r\npresented a phaeton made of wood taken from the old frigate\r\nConstitution. A third capped the climax by forwarding from New York a\r\ncheese four feet in diameter, two feet thick, and weighing fourteen\r\nhundred pounds--twice as large, the Globe fondly pointed out, as the\r\ncheese presented to Jefferson under similar circumstances a quarter of\r\na century earlier. From all parts of the country came callers, singly\r\nand in delegations, to pay their respects and to assure the outgoing\r\nChief of their goodwill and admiration. March 4, 1837, was a raw,\r\ndisagreeable day. But Jackson, pale and racked by disease, rode with\r\nhis chosen successor to the place where he had himself assumed office\r\neight years before, and sat uncovered while the oath was administered\r\nand the inaugural delivered. The suave, elegantly dressed Van Buren was\r\npolitely applauded as the new Chief to whom respect was due. But it was\r\nthe tall, haggard, white-haired soldier-politician who had put Van\r\nBuren where he was who awoke the spontaneous enthusiasm of the crowds.\r\n\r\nThree days after the inauguration Jackson started for the Hermitage.\r\nHis trip became a series of ovations, and he was obliged several times\r\nto pause for rest. At last he reached Nashville, where once again, as\r\nin the old days of the Indian wars, he was received with an acclaim\r\ndeeply tinged by personal friendship and neighborly pride. A great\r\nbanquet in his honor was presided over by James K. Polk, now Speaker of\r\nthe national House of Representatives; and the orators vied one with\r\nanother in extolling his virtues and depicting his services to the\r\ncountry. Then Jackson went on to the homestead whose seclusion he\r\ncoveted.\r\n\r\nNo one knew better than the ex-President himself that his course was\r\nalmost run. He was seventy years of age and seldom free from pain for\r\nan hour. He considered himself, moreover, a poor man--mainly, it\r\nappears, because he went back to Tennessee owing ten thousand dollars\r\nand with only ninety dollars in his pockets. He was, however, only\r\n\"land poor,\" for his plantation of twenty-six hundred acres was rich\r\nand valuable, and he had a hundred and forty slaves--\"servants\" he\r\nalways called them--besides large numbers of horses and cattle. A year\r\nor two of thrifty supervision brought his lands and herds back to\r\nliberal yields; his debts were soon paid off; and notwithstanding heavy\r\noutlays for his adopted son, whose investments invariably turned out\r\nbadly, he was soon able to put aside all anxiety over pecuniary\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nEstablished again in his old home, surrounded by congenial relatives\r\nand friends, respected by neighbors without regard to politics, and\r\nvisited from time to time by notable foreigners and Americans, Jackson\r\nfound much of satisfaction in his declining years. For a time he fully\r\nlived up to the promise made to Benton and Blair that he would keep\r\nclear of politics. His interest in the fortunes of his party, however,\r\nwas not diminished by his retirement from public life. He corresponded\r\nfreely with Van Buren, whose policies he in most respects approved; and\r\nas the campaign of 1840 approached the \"old war-horse began once more\r\nto sniff the battle from afar.\" Admitting to his friends that the\r\nsituation looked \"a little dubious,\" he exerted himself powerfully to\r\nbring about the reÎlection of the New Yorker. He wrote a letter\r\nbelittling the military qualities of the Whig candidate, thereby\r\nprobably doing the Democratic cause more harm than good; and finally,\r\nto avert the humiliation of a Whig victory in Tennessee, he \"took the\r\nstump\" and denounced the enemy up and down through all western\r\nTennessee and southern Kentucky. But \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\" was too\r\nmuch for him; the Whig candidates carried both Tennessee and Kentucky\r\nand won the nation-wide contest by 234 to 60 electoral votes.\r\n\r\nThe old warrior took the defeat--his defeat, he always regarded\r\nit--philosophically, and at once began to lay plans for a recovery of\r\nDemocratic supremacy in 1844. For another quadrennium his hand was on\r\nthe party throttle. When men speculated as to whether Van Buren,\r\nGeneral Cass, General Butler, or Senator Benton would be the standard\r\nbearer in 1844, they always asked what Jackson's edict on the subject\r\nwould be; and the final selection of James K. Polk, while not fully\r\ndictated by the ex-President, was the result of a compromise in which\r\nhis advice played a prominent part. Though past seventy-seven and\r\nhardly able to sign his name, Jackson threw himself into the campaign\r\nand undoubtedly contributed to the election of his fellow-Tenneseean.\r\nHis satisfaction with the outcome and with the annexation of Texas\r\nwhich quickly followed found expression in a barbecue attended by all\r\nthe Democrats of the neighborhood and by some of note from a distance.\r\n\"We have restored the Government to sound principles,\" declared the\r\nhost in a brief, faltering speech from the Hermitage portico, \"and\r\nextended the area of our institutions to the Rio Grande. Now for Oregon\r\nand Fifty-four-forty.\"\r\n\r\nOregon--although not to fifty-four forty--was soon to be duly made\r\nAmerican soil. But Jackson did not live to witness the event. Early in\r\n1845 his health began to fail rapidly and on the very day of Polk's\r\ninauguration he was at the point of death. Rallying, he struggled\r\nmanfully for three months against the combined effects of consumption,\r\ndropsy, and dysentery. But on Sunday, the 8th of June, the end came. In\r\naccordance with a pledge which he had given his wife years before, he\r\nhad become a communicant of the Presbyterian church; and his last words\r\nto the friends about his bedside were messages of Christian cheer.\r\nAfter two days the body was laid to rest in the Hermitage garden,\r\nbeside the grave of the companion whose loss he had never ceased to\r\nmourn with all the feeling of which his great nature was capable. The\r\nauthorities at the national capital ordered public honors to be paid to\r\nthe ex-President, and gatherings in all parts of the country listened\r\nwith much show of feeling to appropriate eulogies.\r\n\r\n\"General Jackson,\" said Daniel Webster to Thurlow Weed in 1837, \"is an\r\nhonest and upright man. He does what he thinks is right, and does it\r\nwith all his might. He has a violent temper, which leads him often to\r\nhasty conclusions. It also causes him to view as personal to himself\r\nthe public acts of other men. For this reason there is great difference\r\nbetween Jackson angry and Jackson in good humor. When he is calm, his\r\njudgment is good; when angry, it is usually bad. . . . His patriotism\r\nis no more to be questioned than that of Washington. He is the greatest\r\nGeneral we have and, except Washington, the greatest we ever had.\"\r\n\r\nTo this characterization of Andrew Jackson by his greatest American\r\ncontemporary it is impossible to make noteworthy addition. His was a\r\ncharacter of striking contradictions. His personal virtues were\r\nhonesty, bravery, open-heartedness, chivalry toward women, hospitality,\r\nsteadfastness. His personal faults were irascibility, egotism,\r\nstubbornness, vindictiveness, and intolerance of the opinions of\r\nothers. He was not a statesman; yet some of the highest qualities of\r\nstatesmanship were in him. He had a perception of the public will which\r\nhas rarely been surpassed; and in most, if not all, of the great issues\r\nof his time he had a grasp of the right end of the question.\r\n\r\nThe country came to the belief that the National Bank should not be\r\nrevived. It accepted and perpetuated Van Buren's independent treasury\r\nplan. The annexation of Texas, which Jackson strongly favored, became\r\nan accomplished fact with the approval of a majority of the people. The\r\nmoderated protective tariff to which Jackson inclined was kept up until\r\nthe Civil War. The removal of the Indians to reservations beyond the\r\nMississippi fell in with the views of the public upon that subject and\r\ninaugurated an Indian policy which was closely adhered to for more than\r\nhalf a century. In his vindication of executive independence Jackson\r\nbroke new ground, crudely enough it is true; yet, whatever the merits\r\nof his ideas at the moment, they reshaped men's conception of the\r\npresidency and helped make that office the power that it is today. The\r\nstrong stand taken against nullification clarified popular opinion upon\r\nthe nature of the Union and lent new and powerful support to national\r\nvigor and dignity.\r\n\r\nOver against these achievements must be placed the introduction of the\r\nSpoils System, which debauched the Civil Service and did the country\r\nlasting harm; yet Jackson only responded to public opinion which held\r\n\"rotation in office to be the cardinal principle of democracy.\" It\r\nneeded a half-century of experience to convince the American people of\r\nthis fallacy and to place the national Civil Service beyond the reach\r\nof spoilsmen. Even now public opinion is slow to realize that\r\nefficiency in office can be secured only by experience and relative\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\nThe events of the period covered in this volume are described with some\r\nfullness in all of the general American histories. Of these, two are\r\nespecially noteworthy for literary quality and other elements of\r\npopular interest: Woodrow Wilson's History of the American People, 5\r\nvols. (1902), and John B. McMaster's History of the People of the\r\nUnited States, 8 vols. (1883-1913). The Jacksonian epoch is treated in\r\nWilson's fourth volume and in McMaster's fifth and sixth volumes. On\r\nsimilar lines, but with more emphasis on political and constitutional\r\nmatters, is James Schouler's History of the United States under the\r\nConstitution, 7 vols. (1880-1913), vols. III-IV. One seeking a\r\nscholarly view of the period, in an adequate literary setting, can\r\nhardly do better, however, than to read Frederick J. Turner's Rise of\r\nthe New West (1906) and William MacDonald's Jacksonian Democracy\r\n(1906). These are volumes XIV and XV in The American Nation, edited by\r\nAlbert B. Hart.\r\n\r\nBiographies are numerous and in a number of instances excellent. Of\r\nlives of Jackson, upwards of a dozen have been published. The most\r\nrecent and in every respect the best is John S. Bassett's Life of\r\nAndrew Jackson, 2 vols. (1911). This work is based throughout on the\r\nsources; its literary quality is above the average and it appraises\r\nJackson and his times in an unimpeachable spirit of fairness. Within\r\nvery limited space, William G. Brown's Andrew Jackson (1900) tells the\r\nstory of Jackson admirably; and a good biography, marred only by a lack\r\nof sympathy and by occasional inaccuracy in details, is William G.\r\nSumner's Andrew Jackson (rev. ed., 1899). Of older biographies, the\r\nmost important is James Parton's Life of Andrew Jackson, 3 vols.\r\n(1861). This work is sketchy, full of irrelevant or unimportant matter,\r\nand uncritical; but for a half-century it was the repository from which\r\nhistorians and biographers chiefly drew in dealing with Jackson's\r\nepoch. John H. Eaton's Life of Andrew Jackson (1842) describes\r\nJackson's earlier career, mainly on the military side; but it never\r\nrises above the level of a campaign document.\r\n\r\nAmong biographies of Jackson's contemporaries may be mentioned George\r\nT. Curtis, Life of Daniel Webster, 2 vols. (1870); Henry C. Lodge,\r\nDaniel Webster (1883); John B. McMaster, Daniel Webster (1902);\r\nFrederic A. Ogg, Daniel Webster (1914); Carl Schurz, Henry Clay, 2\r\nvols. (1887); Gaillard Hunt, John C. Calhoun (1908); William M. Meigs,\r\nThe Life of John Caldwell Calhoun, 2 vols. (1917); John T. Morse, John\r\nQuincy Adams (1882); Edward M. Shepard, Martin Van Buren (1888);\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, Thomas Hart Benton (1888); and Theodore D. Jervey,\r\nRobert Y. Hayne and His Times (1909).\r\n\r\nOn many topics the reader will do well to go to monographs or other\r\nspecial works. Thus Jackson's policy of removals from public office is\r\npresented with good perspective in Carl R. Fish, The Civil Service and\r\nthe Patronage (Harvard Historical Studies, xi, 1905). The history of\r\nthe bank controversy is best told in Ralph C. H. Catterall, The Second\r\nBank of the United States (1903); and interesting chapters in the\r\ncountry's financial history are presented in Edward G. Bourne, History\r\nof the Surplus Revenue of 1837 (1885), and David Kinley, The History,\r\nOrganization, and Influence of the Independent Treasury of the United\r\nStates (1893). On the tariff one should consult Frank W. Taussig,\r\nTariff History of the United States (6th ed., 1914) and Edward\r\nStanwood, American Tariff Controversies, 2 vols. (1903). Similarly\r\nilluminating studies of nullification are David F. Houston, Critical\r\nStudy of Nullification in South Carolina (Harvard Historical Studies,\r\nIII, 1896) and Ulrich B. Phillips, Georgia and State Rights (American\r\nHistorical Association Reports, 1901, II).\r\n\r\nAside from newspapers, and from collections of public documents of\r\nprivate correspondence, which cannot be enumerated here, the source\r\nmaterials for the period fall into two main classes: books of\r\nautobiography and reminiscence, and the writings of travelers. Most\r\nconspicuous in the first group is Thomas H. Benton, Thirty Years' View;\r\nor, a History of the Working of the American Government for Thirty\r\nYears, from 1820 to 1850, 2 vols. (1854). Benton was an active member\r\nof the Senate throughout the Jacksonian period, and his book gives an\r\ninteresting and valuable first-hand account of the public affairs of\r\nthe time. Amos Kendall's Autobiography (1872) is, unfortunately, hardly\r\nmore than a collection of papers and scattered memoranda. Nathan\r\nSargent's Public Men and Events, 1817-1853, 2 vols. (1875), consists of\r\nchatty sketches, with an anti-Jackson slant. Other books of\r\ncontemporary reminiscence are Lyman Beecher's Autobiography, 2 vols.\r\n(1863-65); Robert Mayo's Political Sketches of Eight Years in\r\nWashington (1839); and S.C. Goodrich's Recollections of a Lifetime, 2\r\nvols. (1856). The one monumental diary is John Quincy Adams, Memoirs;\r\nComprising Portions of his Diary from 1795 to 1848 (ed. by Charles F.\r\nAdams, 12 vols., 1874-77). All things considered, there is no more\r\nimportant nonofficial source for the period.\r\n\r\nIn Jackson's day the United States was visited by an extraordinary\r\nnumber of Europeans who forthwith wrote books descriptive of what they\r\nhad seen. Two of the most interesting--although the least\r\nflattering--of these works are Charles Dickens's American Notes for\r\nGeneral Circulation (1842, and many reprints) and Mrs. Frances E.\r\nTrollope's Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832). Two very readable\r\nand generally sympathetic English accounts are Frances A. Kemble's\r\nJournal, 1832-1833, 2 vols. (1835) and Harriet Martineau's Society in\r\nAmerica, 3 vols. (2d ed., 1837). The principal French work of the sort\r\nis M. Chevalier, Society, Manners, and Politics in the United States\r\n(Eng. trans. from 3d French ed., 1839). Political conditions in the\r\ncountry are described in Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America\r\n(Eng. trans. by Reeve in 2 vols., 1862), and the economic situation is\r\nset forth in detail in James S. Buckingham, America, Historical,\r\nStatistical and Descriptive, 2 vols. (1841), and The Slave States of\r\nAmerica, 2 vols. (1842).\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX A Adams, John, Jackson makes acquaintance of, 17.
