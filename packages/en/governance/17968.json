Yves Guyot and Dr. Kuyper and M. Brunetière (Appendix B), the\r\nreader will understand how the publication of _Le Siècle_ articles in\r\npamphlet form arose.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May when M. Yves Guyot's _La Politique Boer_ made its\r\nappearance, the supply of literature by more or less competent judges on\r\nSouth African affairs was already so formidable in this country, that an\r\nEnglish publication of his pamphlet was apparently not wanted. Moreover,\r\nas my master's arguments were written for readers on the continent and\r\nnot for those of Great Britain, such a publication was not thought of at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nOf the first editions of _La Politique Boer_ placed before the reading\r\npublic in various countries, a few thousand copies were sent to London.\r\nThe demand, however, exceeded the supply to such a large extent, and so\r\nmany letters were received at this office from British readers\r\n(unfamiliar with the French language) asking for a translation, that an\r\nEnglish dress of _La Politique Boer_ was decided upon.\r\n\r\nAs the translation was proceeding various incidents of importance in\r\nconnection with the South African crisis took place. These were\r\ncommented upon by M. Yves Guyot in _Le Siècle_ and added to the\r\nexisting pamphlet; the English edition is consequently more up-to-date\r\nthan the original.\r\n\r\nOur thanks for valuable assistance given in the translation are largely\r\ndue to Mrs. Ellen Waugh and Mr. Charles Baxter.\r\n\r\nM. Yves Guyot has renounced his author's rights, and the profits to _Le\r\nSiècle_, resulting from this publication, will be handed in two equal\r\nshares to the societies here and in South Africa which represent the\r\ninterests of the widows and orphans of English and Boer combatants who\r\nhave given their lives for their countries.\r\n\r\nJULES HEDEMAN.\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON OFFICE OF _Le Siècle_\r\n32, CHARING CROSS, S.W.\r\n\r\n_25th October, 1900._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n1.

Cavaignac when, in\r\nhis speech of July 7th, 1898, he abandoned the \"bordereau\" to substitute\r\nfor it the Henry forgery.\r\n\r\nThey keep talking of the Great Trek of 1836; of England's greed; of the\r\ngold mines; and, above all, of the Jameson raid. The Jameson raid is\r\ntheir pet grievance; it takes the place of all argument. The Uitlanders\r\nmay well say that \"Jameson has been Krüger's best friend.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the Jameson raid is the best proof of the powerlessness\r\nof England to protect the interests of her subjects against the\r\npretentions of the Pretoria Government.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Lord Ripon had already made ineffectual representations to that\r\nGovernment concerning the contempt with which it was treating the\r\nConvention of 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlanders had approached the Volksraad in a petition signed by\r\n14,800 persons. The petitioners did not ask that the Republic should be\r\nplaced under the control of the British Government; on the contrary,\r\nthey postulated the maintenance of its independence; all that they asked\r\nwas for \"equitable administration and fair representation.\" This\r\npetition was received with angry contempt. \"Protest, protest as much as\r\nyou like,\" said Mr. Krüger, \"I have arms, and you have none.\"\r\n\r\nIt is contended that if President Krüger did provide himself to a\r\nformidable extent with munitions of war, it was not until after the\r\nJameson Raid.\r\n\r\nHere the connexion between cause and effect is not very clear; Jameson\r\nonce beaten there was no further cause to arm against him. But from the\r\nUitlanders' petition, to which allusion has been made, it is evident\r\nthat armaments had begun before. Among the alleged grievances we find\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n     \"A policy of force is openly declared against us; £250,000 have\r\n     been expended on the construction of forts; upon one alone,\r\n     designed to terrorise the inhabitants of Johannesburg, £100,000 has\r\n     been spent. Large orders have been given to Krupp for big guns and\r\n     maxims; and it is said that German Officers are coming to drill the\r\n     burghers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Uitlanders of Johannesburg treated with contumely, adopted the\r\ntheories made use of by the Boers in their Petition of Rights of\r\nFebruary 17th, 1881, by which they justified their insurrection against\r\nBritish rule, of December, 1880.\r\n\r\n     \"Then the cause was unexpectedly helped on by the courageous\r\n     resistance of O. Bezuidenhout against the seizure of his household\r\n     effects for non-payment of taxes. Here was a breach of the law easy\r\n     to lay hold of; here was a crime indeed! It was illegal,\r\n     undoubtedly, but illegal in the same sense as was the refusal of\r\n     Hampden to pay the four or five shillings \"ship money\"; the taking\r\n     of den Briel by the Watergeuzen (Waterbeggars) in 1572; as was the\r\n     throwing overboard of a cargo of tea in Boston; as was the plot in\r\n     Cape Colony against the importation of convicts. All these acts\r\n     were illegal, but of such are the illegalities in which a people\r\n     takes refuge, when a Government fails in its duty to a law higher\r\n     than that of man.\"\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the principles invoked by the Boers, the Johannesburg\r\nUitlanders entered into a conspiracy; Jameson was to come to their aid\r\nafter they had risen. Messrs. Leonard and Phillips put themselves in\r\ncommunication with Cecil Rhodes. He listened to their manifesto, and the\r\ninstant they came to the mention of free trade in South Africa, he said:\r\n\"That will do for me.\" The supposition that he desired to annex the\r\nTransvaal is absurd.[1] He has admitted that he gave his personal\r\nco-operation to Jameson without having first consulted his colleagues of\r\nthe Chartered Company. Jameson was to have gone to the assistance of the\r\nUitlanders; not to forestall the insurrection, which was fixed for\r\nJanuary 4th. On December 29th, Jameson invaded the Transvaal with 480\r\nmen. They got as far as Krugersdorp, about 31 miles distant from\r\nJohannesburg, and after a fight at Doornkop, in which the Raiders'\r\nlosses were 18 killed and 40 wounded, and on the Boers' side four killed\r\nand five wounded, they surrendered on the condition that their lives\r\nshould be spared.\r\n\r\nThat stipulation is forgotten when we fall to admiring President\r\nKrüger's magnanimity in handing over Jameson to the British Government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fitzpatrick. \"The Transvaal from Within.\" p. 122.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Profits from the Jameson Raid._\r\n\r\nThe trial by the Government of Pretoria of the sixty-four members of the\r\n\"Reform Committee\" was held in Johannesburg. Four of them, Mr. Lionel\r\nPhillips, Colonel Rhodes, Mr. George Farrar, and Mr. Hammond were\r\ncondemned to death. The remainder were sentenced to two years'\r\nimprisonment and £2,000 fine, or failing payment, to another year's\r\nimprisonment and three years' banishment. The Executive reserved to\r\nthemselves the right to confiscate their property.\r\n\r\nIn commutation of the four death sentences, the Government exacted\r\n£100,000; fifty-six other prisoners paid in a sum of £112,000. One of\r\nthe accused died, another who had pleaded not guilty, was so ill that\r\nhis sentence was not carried out; Messrs. Sampson and Davies refused to\r\npay the fine. The British Government left Mr. Krüger a free hand in the\r\nmatter; it cannot be reproached with having interposed on their\r\nbehalf--although it was its own representatives who persuaded the\r\nJohannesburg conspirators to deliver up their arms. In the moment of\r\ndanger many and various hopes were held out by Mr. Krüger in his\r\nproclamation of December 30th, 1895. The danger once past, the promises\r\nwere forgotten. He remembered the Jameson Raid only as an excuse for\r\ndemanding an indemnity of £677,938 3s. 6d. for material damages, and a\r\nfurther £1,000,000 for damages \"moral and intellectual.\"\r\n\r\nIn February, 1896, Mr. Chamberlain proposed to him \"the autonomy of that\r\nportion occupied by mining industries\" (see details of the proposal,\r\nletter of Mr. Chamberlain, published in _Le Siècle_, July 5th, 1899.)\r\nMr. Krüger refused contemptuously. At the same time he got the Volksraad\r\nto pass a bill giving him the right to expel any foreigner, at his\r\ndiscretion, at a fortnight's notice. Mr. Chamberlain reminded him that\r\nthis bill was contrary to Act 14 of the Convention of 1884. Krüger took\r\nno notice of this remonstrance, and the bill became law on October 24th.\r\nIn December, 1896, Mr. Chamberlain made a renewed protest.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence continued. Mr. Chamberlain recapitulated the breaches\r\nof the Convention of 1884 committed by the Boer Government. In the\r\nsummer of 1897, the act was at last repealed, but always with the\r\nunavowed intention of re-enacting it in another form.\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger persistently continued to refuse all demands for reform,\r\nbecoming more and more insolent, while, thanks to the wealth brought to\r\nthe exchequer by the gold mines, he continued to increase the very\r\narmaments against which the petitioners of 1894 had protested.\r\n\r\nTo all representations, his answer was \"The Jameson Raid.\" To all\r\nEurope, his plea was \"The Jameson Raid.\" If you mention Transvaal\r\naffairs to a Pro-Boer, he shuts you up at once with \"what about the\r\nJameson Raid?\" He will listen to no arguments; and loses his temper. If\r\nyou suggest that the Jameson Raid bears a certain analogy to the\r\nexpedition of Garibaldi's One Thousand, he gazes at you with amazement.\r\nIf you proceed to remark that the Jameson Raid took place at the close\r\nof the year 1895; that we are now in 1900; that it is _res judicata_;\r\nthat the British Government left Boer Justice a free hand to deal with\r\nthe conspirators, he accuses you of having been bought by England. Not a\r\nwhisper, of course, is heard about the millions of secret service money\r\nplaced at the disposal of Dr. Leyds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Logical Consequences of the Jameson Raid._\r\n\r\nAccording to the Boers, they are briefly: (1) The Jameson Raid of Dec.\r\n29th, 1895, gives the South African Republic the right in perpetuity to\r\nregard the Convention of 1884 as null and void. (2) The Jameson Raid\r\ngives the Government of the South African Republic the right to treat\r\nall Uitlanders, especially the British, as Boers treat Kaffirs. (3) The\r\nJameson Raid gives the Government of the South African Republic an\r\nundefined and perpetual right to plunder the Uitlanders.\r\n\r\nYVES GUYOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBOER APOLOGISTS.[2]\r\n\r\n1.--_Disregard of Facts and Subordination to the Vatican._\r\n\r\n\r\nI notice with satisfaction, that people, who a short time ago would not\r\nlisten to a word about the Transvaal, are now no longer animated by the\r\nsame spirit of confidence, and are even beginning to wonder whether they\r\nhave not fallen into the same mistake made by so many in the Dreyfus\r\ncase, who only began to entertain doubts after the exposure of the Henry\r\nforgery.\r\n\r\nI have been asked \"Why have you not answered Dr. Kuyper's article in the\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_?\" and it appears that Dr. Leyds has been heard\r\nto say in Brussels: \"M. Yves Guyot has made no answer to Dr. Kuyper's\r\narticle.\" As though it were unanswerable!\r\n\r\nI might well retort with the question: \"Why does the Pro-Boer press\r\nnever reply to counter arguments save by vague phrases, and evading the\r\nreal issue? Why does the French press, in particular, confine itself to\r\nlauding \"the brave Boers\" and the \"venerable President Krüger,\" and to\r\nextolling the virtues with which it credits them, instead of studying\r\ntheir actual social condition, and giving its readers the plain facts?\r\nWhy do we not find one word in our papers of the articles by M.M.\r\nVillarais and Tallichet, published in the _Bibliothèque\r\nUniverselle_.[3]\"\r\n\r\nIt is an exact repetition of the method employed by the Anti-Dreyfusard\r\npapers in the Dreyfus case. But the odd thing is, that many who were\r\nthen exasperated by it, now look upon it as quite natural, and are not\r\nsurprised to find themselves bosom friends of Drumont, Rochefort, Judet,\r\nand Arthur Mayer. The Transvaal question unites them in a \"nationalist\"\r\npolicy, which, if it were to go beyond mere words, would result in a war\r\nwith England and might complete, by a naval Sedan, the disaster of 1870.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Frenchmen have brought to the scrutiny of the matter a\r\ndegree of pigheadedness that clearly proves the influence of our method\r\nof subjective education. We state our faith on words, and\r\nbelieve--because it is a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe _Revue des Deux Mondes_, in which Dr. Kuyper's article is published\r\n(February 1st), has become an organ of Leo XIII. Those free-thinkers,\r\nprotestants, and Jews in France who take part in the Anglophobe\r\nmovement, are thus naively furthering the aims of the Vatican and the\r\nJesuits, whose endeavour has ever been to stir up Europe against\r\nEngland--England that shall never be forgiven for the liberalism of her\r\ninstitutions, for the independence of her thinkers, and for her\r\npolitics, to which they attribute, not without reason, the downfall of\r\nthe temporal power.\r\n\r\nThe apologetic portion of Dr. Kuyper's article shows the Boers in their\r\ntrue light. Far from refuting it, I will quote from it. The critical\r\npart obscures the points at issue. I will clear them up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Le Siècle_, March 20th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See _Le Siècle_, February 3rd and March 14th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Boers, the Natives, and Slavery._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper's article begins with the words: \"Once more the yuletide has\r\nsent forth the angelic message 'Peace on Earth,' even to where the\r\nnatives gather at the humble chapels of our missionaries.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper then undertakes to show us how the Boers understand \"the\r\nangelic message\" in their treatment of the coloured race. He begins by\r\nwaxing wroth with the English who, in 1816, in consequence of the\r\nrepresentations of their missionaries, had instituted an enquiry as to\r\nthe manner in which the Boers treated their slaves, \"England humiliated\r\nthem before their slaves,\" he says. The English also protected natives.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper says:--\r\n\r\n     \"With little regard for the real rights of their ancient colonists,\r\n     _the English prided themselves on protecting the imaginary rights\r\n     of the natives_.\"\r\n\r\nThe italics are his own. This virtuous protester continues:--\r\n\r\n     \"Deceived by the reports from their missionaries, little worthy of\r\n     belief, and led astray by a sentimental love for primitive man,\r\n     'The Aborigines Protection Societies,' so drastically exposed by\r\n     Edmund Burke, saw their opportunity. With their Aborigines\r\n     Societies, the deists posed in the political arena as protectors of\r\n     the native races, while, in religious circles, the Christians with\r\n     their missionary societies posed as their benefactors.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper forgives neither the deists nor the missionaries. And what of\r\nthe Boers?\r\n\r\n     \"The Boers had introduced a system of slavery copied from that\r\n     adopted by the English in their American colonies; but greatly\r\n     modified. I do not deny that, at times, the Boers have been too\r\n     harsh, and have committed excesses....\r\n\r\n     \"The Boers are not sentimentalists, but are eminently practical.\r\n     They recognised that these Hottentots and Basutos were an inferior\r\n     race....\r\n\r\n     \"The Boers have always resolutely faced the difficulty of the\r\n     colour question so persistently kept out of view by the English.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Kuyper goes on to speak of the multiplication of the blacks in\r\nSouth Africa. He dare not point to the logical solution, which would be\r\nto regulate matters by extermination, pure and simple; but he gives vent\r\nto his hatred of the English who, far from checking that multiplication,\r\nassist it by their humane treatment of the natives. He is especially\r\nwrathful with English missionaries, \"those black-frocked gentlemen.\" He\r\nstates that the Boers do their best \"to keep them at a distance\"; and he\r\ncites, as a fact, which fills him with indignation and alarm:--\r\n\r\n     \"A coloured bishop has been appointed president of a kind of negro\r\n     council in Africa.\"\r\n\r\nI confine myself to quoting Dr. Kuyper. He shows too plainly the\r\ncharacter, passions, and hatreds of the Boers, to render comment\r\nnecessary. He acknowledges that the Great Trek, the emigration\r\nnorthwards, did not begin till after 1834, when, according to the\r\nmanifesto of 1881, known as the Petition of Rights, \"in consequence of\r\nthe enforced sale of their slaves, the old patriarchal farmers were\r\nruined.\" This document represents that it was treating them \"with\r\ncontumely\" to offer them money compensation, adding regretfully \"that\r\nthe greater portion of the money remained in the hands of London\r\nswindlers.\" The regret and the contumely are difficult to reconcile.\r\nAncestors of the Boers had more than once acted in a similar manner\r\ntowards the Dutch East India Company when dissatisfied with their\r\nadministration, and unwilling to pay their taxes. But Pro-Boers have a\r\ncurious habit of magnifying things. One would imagine, to hear them\r\nspeak, that every Boer in the Cape had packed wife, children, and goods\r\ninto ox-wagons and had trekked north. As a matter of fact, the greater\r\nproportion remained behind, and their descendants formed the majority of\r\nthe 376,000 whites enumerated in the census of 1891. The Great Trek was\r\nreally composed of various detachments which started one after another\r\nin 1836. Statistics of the numbers of trekkers vary from 5,000 to\r\n10,000. I have not been able to trace whether these figures refer only\r\nto adult males, or whether they include the women and children. In any\r\ncase, when discussing South African affairs, we must always bear in mind\r\nthe small number of persons concerned, in comparison with the vast\r\nextent of the area in question.\r\n\r\nNot only these trekkers, but all who, from the period of the seventeenth\r\ncentury onwards, had had the tendency to wander from the Cape, belonged\r\nto the most adventurous and warlike portion of the population. They had\r\nspread themselves over an enormous tract of country, and were in close\r\ntouch with kaffirs and bushmen, cattle-lifters using poisoned arrows.\r\nLiving in isolated families, they acquired, in the course of their\r\nunceasing struggle with their savage neighbours, not only their\r\nqualities of daring and warlike skill, but habits of cruelty and cunning\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_Essentially a Man of War and Politics._\r\n\r\nBetween the Dutchman of Amsterdam, Haarlem, the Hague, or Rotterdam,\r\ninstalled in his comfortable dwelling, cultivating his tulips, priding\r\nhimself upon his pictures, and drinking his beer, and the Boer, pure and\r\nsimple, there is not the slightest analogy.\r\n\r\nThis Dr. Kuyper acknowledges. The Boer population is a compound of\r\nDutchmen, Frenchmen, Hugenots, Germans and Scotchmen. Krüger and Reitz\r\nare of German, Joubert and Cronje, of French origin. Here is what Dr.\r\nKuyper, himself, says of the Boers:--\r\n\r\n     \"The word Boer signifies 'peasant,' but it would be a mistake to\r\n     compare Boers with French peasants, English farmers, or even the\r\n     settlers of America. They are rather a _conquering race_, who\r\n     established themselves among the Hottentots and Basutos, in the\r\n     same manner that the _Normans, in the XIth Century, established\r\n     themselves among the Anglo-Saxons_. Abstaining from all manual\r\n     labour, they devote themselves to their properties, sometimes as\r\n     much as 5,000 to 6,000 acres in extent, and to the breeding of\r\n     cattle and horses. Beyond this, their object in life is hunting\r\n     lion and big game. _The Boer is essentially a man of war and\r\n     politics._\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the true Boer, and not the idyllic \"small farmer\" pictured\r\nto us by a contributor to _Le Temps_. He is essentially the \"man of war\r\nand politics,\" the counterpart of an Arab chief, the sole difference\r\nbeing that the Boer is not a polygamist and has no tribe under him; on\r\nthe contrary, the Boers swarm off in isolated groups or families. Their\r\nconception of life is, however, the same. I quote here from my treatise\r\non The Evolution of Property (p. 46) on the subject of Pastoral\r\nTribes:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was at one time the fashion to hold up pastoral tribes and the\r\n     patriarchs with their long flowing beards, as subjects of\r\n     admiration. Long-bearded patriarchs were objects of veneration.\r\n     Despite the quarrels of Esau and Jacob, and the story of Joseph\r\n     sold by his brethren, pastoral life was pictured to us as mild as\r\n     milk, as innocent as that of sheep in the fold, until Renan pointed\r\n     out its qualities and defects. At the same time we were told of the\r\n     Bedouins \"with saddle, bridle, and life on the Islam,\" always\r\n     mounted, always armed, always engaged in war or razzias and mutual\r\n     pillage; of the Turkomans and their motto: 'Thy soul is in thy\r\n     sword'; and those who thus celebrated the amenities of pastoral\r\n     life, and the heroic adventures of the Arabs of the desert, never\r\n     perceived the contradictions they had fallen into.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of that Chapter I spoke of the Boers, according to\r\nLevaillant, \"the most carniverous of men,\" as having turned out of their\r\npossessions the nomadic Hottentot and Kaffir shepherds. _The Boers\r\nrepresent that form of warlike and political civilisation in which\r\nproduction is indirect, and obtained by utilising the labour of others._\r\nIt is a type of that ancient pillaging civilisation which we call\r\nwar-like, when its methods have been reduced to rules. In this stage\r\npolitics mean the organisation of pillage. Mr. Kuyper is right. \"The\r\nBoer is essentially a man of war and politics.\" He has employed his\r\ntalents at the expense of Hottentots and Kaffirs; he has continued to\r\nemploy them to the detriment of the Uitlanders; and he thought the time\r\nhad come to realise his programme of February 17th, 1881, formulated by\r\nDr. Reitz at the end of his official pamphlet,[4] \"Africa for the\r\nAfricanders from the Zambesi to Simon's Bay.\" We have seen what view,\r\naccording to his apologist, \"the man of war and politics\" takes of his\r\nrelations with the natives; we shall now see how he regards his\r\nrelations with the whites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"A Century of Injustice.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nENGLISH AND BOERS.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_The Ideal of the Boers._\r\n\r\nNo French Pro-Boer has reproduced the portrait I have published, as\r\ngiven by Dr. Kuyper. It disturbs the conception presented to their\r\nreaders by journalists, whose dishonesty is only equalled by their\r\nignorance. Quoting his own statements, I have shown Boer relations with\r\nthe natives; I will now proceed to show their relations with the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Dr. Kuyper's evidence, I will avail myself of a document\r\nfrom Boer sources: The Petition of Rights, addressed to the President of\r\nthe Orange Free State, February 17th, 1881, and bearing Krüger's name at\r\nthe head of the list of signatures. This document clearly shows not only\r\nthe manner in which Boers write history, but also that, five years\r\nbefore the discovery of the Gold Mines, they cherished as their ideal,\r\nnot only the preservation of their independence, but the driving out of\r\nthe English from all South Africa: \"From the Zambesi to Simon's Bay,\r\n_Africa for the Afrikanders!_\" This is the rallying cry with which the\r\ndocument ends, and we find it repeated by Dr. Reitz, as the concluding\r\nwords of his pamphlet, \"A Century of Injustice.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Le Siècle_, March 23rd, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The English in South Africa._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper cannot forgive the English their occupation of the Cape. Yet,\r\nthey had only followed the example of the Dutch who, during their war\r\nwith Spain, 1568-1648, had seized the greater portion of the Portuguese\r\ncolonies, because Portugal had been an ally of Spain. Holland had been\r\nforced into an alliance with France, and in exactly the same way, in\r\n1794 and 1806, England seized the Cape. In 1814 she bought it from the\r\nPrince of Orange. Dr. Kuyper does not deny that the price was paid, but\r\nremarks that it did not replenish the coffers of the prince. Be that as\r\nit may, the treaty is none the less valid, and the \"Petition of Rights\"\r\nbegins by protesting against \"the action of the King of Holland who, in\r\n1814, had ceded Cape Colony to England in exchange for Belgium.\" The\r\nEnglish valued the newly acquired colony only as a naval station; they\r\ndid not endeavour to extend the territory they occupied. Professor Bryce\r\nclearly shows in his \"Impressions of South Africa\" that if England had\r\nenlarged her possessions it had been in despite of herself, and solely\r\nto ensure their safety; although, from the treatise \"Great Britain and\r\nthe Dutch Republics,\" published in _The Times_, and reproduced in _Le\r\nSiècle_, it is evident that she had always considered that her rights in\r\nSouth Africa extended to the frontier of the Portuguese possessions;\r\nthat is to say, to the 25° of latitude, in which latitude Delagoa Bay\r\nis situated.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper begins by himself putting us somewhat on our guard concerning\r\nhis feelings towards England; for, not only does he decline to forgive\r\nher the occupation of Cape Colony, but also her triumph over Holland in\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n     \"Nowhere had resentment against 'perfide Albion' penetrated\r\n     national feeling more deeply than in the Netherlands. Between the\r\n     Dutch and English characters there is absolute incompatibility.\"\r\n\r\nAs a rule, I attach little faith to such generalities; in this case, I\r\nam sure, rightly. Forgetting his dictum of \"absolute incompatibility\"\r\n(p. 449), Dr. Kuyper, at p. 520, shows that, as far as he is concerned,\r\nit is only relative; for in speaking of England, he goes on to say:--\r\n\r\n     \"Were I not a Dutchman, I should prefer to be one of her sons. Her\r\n     habitual veracity is above suspicion; the sense of duty and justice\r\n     is innate in her. Her constitutional institutions are universally\r\n     imitated. Nowhere else do we find the sense of self-respect more\r\n     largely developed.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper further admits that the \"incompatibility\" is relative as far\r\nas Afrikanders are concerned, it is only \"absolute\" as applied to the\r\nBoers. After giving us this example of the consistency of his views, Dr.\r\nKuyper speaks of the English as being \"unobservant.\" A reproach somewhat\r\nunexpected, when directed against the countrymen of Darwin. As a proof,\r\nhe presents us with this metaphor, equally unexpected from the pen of a\r\nDutchman--a dweller of the plains:--\r\n\r\n     \"Because, in winter, the English had only seen in these\r\n     insignificant river beds a harmless thread of frozen water, they\r\n     took no thought of the formidable torrent which the thawing of the\r\n     snow, in spring, would send rushing down to inundate their banks.\"\r\n\r\n\"The torrent\" is of course the war now going on. Lord Roberts seems to\r\nbe successfully coping with the \"inundation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_\"The Crime.\"_\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper approves of the \"Petition of Rights\" of 1881. It sets forth\r\nthat the South African Dutch do not recognise the cession made by the\r\nKing of Holland in 1814; it does not admit that he had the right to\r\n\"sell them like a flock of sheep.\" There have been Boers in rebellion\r\nsince 1816.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a man named Bezuidenhout. In resisting a Sheriff who\r\ntried to arrest him, he was shot. His friends summoned to their aid a\r\nKaffir Chief, named Gaika. The English authorities condemned five of the\r\ninsurgents to be hanged. The rope broke. They were hanged over again.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper, and the \"Petition of Rights\" found their indictment of the\r\nBritish upon this event which they denominate \"the Crime.\" The scene of\r\nthe execution was named \"Slachtersnek,\" \"hill of slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThis act of repression was violent, but it may possibly have been\r\nindispensable. At any rate, it bears but a very far off relation to the\r\nevents of to-day. Dr. Kuyper in resuscitating, and laying stress upon\r\nit, follows a method well known in rhetoric; he begins by discrediting\r\nhis adversary. However, despite his good intentions, he has not\r\nincreased our admiration for the Boers by pointing out to us that the\r\nmost serious grievances they can allege against the English are the\r\nprotection accorded by the latter to the natives and slaves, and the\r\nfinal emancipation of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_British Sphere of Influence in 1838._\r\n\r\nIn a few lines Dr. Kuyper draws a conventional picture of British policy\r\nwith regard to the Boers, making it out to be ever greedy of power. The\r\ncontrary is the truth. A vacillating and timid policy has been England's\r\ngreat mistake in South Africa; it is this very vacillation that has\r\nbrought about the present war.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper bitterly reproaches the English for having in 1842, six years\r\nafter the Great Trek, claimed those emigrants as British subjects. The\r\nGreat Trek was similar to the emigration of the Mormons. The United\r\nStates have never admitted that they were at liberty to found a separate\r\nState within the limits of the national possessions. If on the same\r\nground alone English had proclaimed their suzeranity over the Boers who\r\nwere endeavouring to form States in Natal, the Orange Free State, and\r\nthe Transvaal, they would have been perfectly within their rights; but\r\nDr. Kuyper forgets that as far back as 1836 England promulgated the\r\n_Cape of Hope Punishment Act_. The object of that Act was to repress\r\ncrimes committed by whites under English dominion throughout the whole\r\nof South Africa, as far north as the 25° South Latitude; that is, as far\r\nas the Portuguese frontier; and it is so thoroughly imbued with that\r\nidea, that it specially excepts any Portuguese territory south of that\r\nlatitude. It is thus proved that with the exception of the portions\r\noccupied by the Portuguese, England claimed, as comprised within her\r\nsphere of influence, the whole of the remaining South African territory.\r\nA certain number of Boers, irreconcilably opposed to British rule, so\r\nfully recognised this, that they trekked as far as Delagoa Bay. Another\r\nobject of the Act was the protection of the Natives against the Boers.\r\nThe constantly recurring and sanguinary conflicts between the Boers and\r\nthe Zulus led England to extend her direct sovereign rights to Natal for\r\nthe peace, protection and good government of all classes of men, who may\r\nhave settled in the interior or vicinity of this important part of South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_England, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State._\r\n\r\nFar from being anxious to assume direct control over these territories,\r\nthe Cape Government for a long time disregarded the petitions for\r\nannexation addressed to it by the inhabitants of Durban; until one fine\r\nday, a Dutch vessel laden with provisions for the Boers, arriving in\r\nPort Natal, the Captain, Smellekamp, took it upon himself to assure them\r\nof the protection of the King of Holland. Thereupon, England established\r\na small garrison under the command of Captain Smith. It was attacked by\r\nthe Boers; a volunteer, named Dick King, contrived to make his escape\r\nfrom the town, and after an adventurous journey reached Grahamstown.\r\nTroops were despatched by the Government, and it was incorporated with\r\nthe Cape Colony; some of the Boers left Natal, some remained; their\r\ndescendants are there to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the Government entered into a series of treaties known as the\r\n\"Napier Treaties,\" for the constitution of Native States extending from\r\nPondoland, on the frontiers of Natal, to the district of which Kimberley\r\nforms the centre (see _Great Britain and the Dutch Republics_). Great\r\nBritain demanded no more than peace and guarantees of security on her\r\nfrontiers. Dr. Kuyper himself admits this, when he sums up in the\r\nfollowing sentence, the history of the emancipation of the Transvaal and\r\nthe Orange Free State.\r\n\r\n     \"Natal was to remain an English Colony, but the English were to\r\n     retire from the Orange and Vaal rivers; it was thus that the\r\n     Independence of the Transvaal was recognised by the Treaty of Sand\r\n     River, of 17th January, 1852; and the Independence of the Free\r\n     State by the Convention of Bloemfontein, of 22nd February, 1854.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper is compelled to admit that England was not forced into this\r\nact of generosity, she having on the 29th August, 1848, defeated the\r\nBoers at Boomplaats, on the Orange table land.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Kuyper forgets to say that the majority of the Free Staters were\r\nfar from desiring the gift made to them by the British Government in\r\n1854. They considered it not as a measure of liberation, but as an\r\nabandonment to the tender mercies of the Basutos. Some years later the\r\nOrange Free State entered into an arrangement with Sir George Grey, for\r\nforming a Confederation with Cape Colony. This was not ratified by the\r\nCape Government.\r\n\r\nNor do we find that Dr. Kuyper takes notice of certain stipulations\r\ncontained in the above Conventions; among others, the abolition of\r\nslavery, and free permission to merchants and missionaries to travel and\r\nsettle where they pleased; which obligations continued to England the\r\nright of control over the administration and legislation of those\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe development of subsequent events is explained by Dr. Kuyper in the\r\nsimplest possible manner:--\r\n\r\n     \"The promptings of selfish and aggressive materialism now took\r\n     unchecked sway, and, although bound by solemn treaties which\r\n     England could not thrust aside without open violation of pledged\r\n     faith, she did not hesitate. The diamonds of Kimberley in the Free\r\n     State flashed with a too seductive brilliancy, and the Gold Mines\r\n     of the Rand became the misfortune of the Transvaal.\"\r\n\r\nI would here observe to Dr. Kuyper that England's friendly relations\r\nwith the Orange Free State, remained unbroken until October 9th, 1899,\r\nwhen, led away by Krüger's promises, it committed the folly of engaging\r\nin war with England.\r\n\r\nAs for the Transvaal, it was annexed by England in 1877, but not on\r\naccount of the Gold Mines, which were only discovered ten years' later.\r\nDr. Kuyper has a trick of neglecting dates, and arranging his facts\r\nafter the fashion of an advocate who supposes that those whom he is\r\naddressing will be content with his assertions, and not trouble to\r\nverify them. For his rhetoric, I shall substitute the actual facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL AND THE CONVENTIONS OF 1881 AND 1884.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_The \"Gold Mines\" Argument._\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Kuyper asserts that \"the gold mines of the Rand became the\r\nmisfortune of the Transvaal,\" it is clear, that in his endeavour to\r\nconvince his readers, he has no regard to the facts of the case, but\r\nthat his aim is to suggest the idea that England's sole object in the\r\npresent war has been to possess herself of the gold mines. Here Dr.\r\nKuyper employs the arguments of _L'Intransigeant_, _La Libre Parole_,\r\nand _Le Petit Journal_; for he is perfectly well aware that England will\r\nderive no benefit from the gold mines, nor will she take possession of\r\nthem any more than she has done of the gold mines of Australia. They are\r\nprivate property.\r\n\r\nFurther, Dr. Kuyper well knows that the gold mines of the Rand were only\r\ndiscovered in 1886, and he himself states that the annexation of the\r\nTransvaal took place on April 12th, 1877. The annexation therefore was\r\nprompted by other motives than the possession of the gold mines, but Dr.\r\nKuyper is careful not to suggest these to his readers.\r\n\r\nHe informs us that Sir Theophilus Shepstone \"entered Pretoria at the\r\nhead of a small army.\" In reality, he had with him five-and-twenty\r\npolicemen. Why then did the Boers, \"so essentially men of war and\r\npolitics,\" permit this?\r\n\r\n\"Once again, the fate of the natives served as pretext,\" Mr. Kuyper adds\r\n\"but the wheel of fortune turns; two years later the English,\r\nthemselves, were at daggers drawn with the natives, and massacred 10,000\r\nmen, women and children.\" That is how Dr. Kuyper writes history! The\r\npretext was not the fate of the natives, but the fate of the Boers, who,\r\nhaving gone to war with Sekukuni, had been beaten. This is admitted in\r\nthe \"Petition of Rights\": \"At first, our operations were not very\r\nsuccessful, our opponents declare that we were unable to defend\r\nourselves against the natives.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Le Siècle_, March 26th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Boer Anarchy._\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that after the Sand River Convention, the most complete\r\nanarchy existed among the Transvaal Boers; and that as much after the\r\npromulgation of their Constitution of 1857 as before. The republicans of\r\nPotchefstroom had taken the title of _The South African Republic_, but\r\ntheir Raad maintained authority only over a small district; Lydenburg,\r\nZoutpansberg, Utrecht, formed themselves into independent republics. It\r\nis estimated that, at that time, the entire population of the Transvaal\r\nconsisted of 8,000 Boers; admitting that this number comprised only the\r\nyoung men and adults capable of bearing arms, and old men, then each\r\nrepublic would be composed, approximately, of 2,000 men. On the death of\r\nAndries Pretorius and of Potgieter, who hated each other like poison,\r\nthe son of Pretorius conceived the design of making himself master of\r\nthe Orange Free State, so as to secure to himself later on the foremost\r\nposition in the Transvaal. A war was on the point of breaking out, but\r\ncame to nothing, as Pretorius hastily recrossed the frontier in the face\r\nof an advance by Boshof, the Free State President, at the head of a\r\ncommando. This action, which demonstrated that his courage and resource\r\nwere less lofty than his ambition, did not however prevent his being\r\nelected President of the South African Republic. In 1860 the union took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his incursion and subsequent flight, Pretorius succeeded\r\nin getting himself elected president of the Orange Free State also. But\r\nthe Transvaal burghers dreaded absorption by their neighbours, and\r\ndeposed him. A petty civil war between his partisans and opponents was\r\nthe consequence; several presidents were elected and deposed. Krüger,\r\nwhom we now see making his appearance, and Schoeman, in turn, chased\r\neach other out of Potchefstroom. In 1864 Pretorius forsook the Free\r\nState, and was re-elected President of the Transvaal, Krüger contenting\r\nhimself with the office of Commandant-General.\r\n\r\nThe Orange Free State was at war with the Basutos. The English\r\nGovernment intervened, and finally annexed Basutoland (1868).\r\n\r\nIn the same year, the Transvaal Government, disregarding the Sand River\r\nConvention, issued a proclamation extending their frontier in the east\r\nto the seaboard; in the West to Lake Ngami, and in the North to\r\nMashonaland. The Portuguese and English Governments entered protests and\r\nthe matter dropped.\r\n\r\nNo minister of the Reformed Dutch Church had accompanied the Boers in\r\ntheir Trek. They therefore formed themselves into a separate reformed\r\nChurch, whose members called themselves \"doppers\" (round-heads). They\r\nallow no liberty of thought; they believe in literal inspiration. If\r\nthey had ever heard of Galileo, they would have looked upon him as an\r\nimpostor. They place the authority of the Old Testament above that of\r\nthe New. There are three contending sects in the Transvaal, whose\r\nhostility is such that both before and after 1881 threats of Civil War\r\nwere indulged in.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_The Boers saved by the English._\r\n\r\nIn 1871, the question of fixing the frontier between the Transvaal and\r\nthe Barolongs, a Bechuana tribe, was submitted to arbitration. The\r\ndecision was given by Mr. Keate, Governor of Natal. President Pretorius\r\nhaving accepted it, the Boers deposed him, and continued to occupy the\r\nterritory to which they laid claim. They were at a loss whom next to\r\nelect as President.\r\n\r\nOvertures were made to Mr. Brand, President of the Orange Free State;\r\nbut he wisely refused. They next turned to a Cape Afrikander, a former\r\nminister of the Dutch Reformed Church, Mr. F. Burgers, a capable,\r\nintelligent man. It was his desire to correct abuses; to repress the\r\nslavery that was being carried on under the name of \"apprenticeship\"; to\r\nintroduce railways and schools; he claimed the right to impose\r\ntaxation, he got to be credited, in the long run, with the belief that\r\nthe devil's tail was not as long as it is represented in the old Bible\r\npictures. When the Boers were defeated by Sekukuni, they looked upon it\r\nas a punishment from God for having a \"free thinker\" for President. The\r\ncommandos disbanded themselves. At the same time Cetewayo, the Zulu\r\nChief, was threatening the Boers in the south. Caught between two fires,\r\nwithout resources or organisation, annihilation was before them. Now the\r\nEnglish, for their own security, had the greatest interest in preventing\r\nthe extermination of white men by natives; and on that ground, apart\r\nfrom all sentimentality, they had never ceased to protest against the\r\nmethods employed by the Boers, as the surest means of bringing about\r\nthat result. Theophilus Shepstone, who possessed great influence over\r\nthe Zulus, was sent to Pretoria. Unable, even with the help of their\r\nPresident, to bring any order into the Government of the Transvaal, he\r\nended by annexing it on 12th April, 1877. He annexed it in order to save\r\nit. Had the English abandoned it to itself, the Boer territory would\r\nhave been occupied by Basutos and the Zulus, and the Boers would have\r\ndisappeared from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_The Annexation of the Transvaal and the Conventions of 1881 and\r\n1884._\r\n\r\nM. Kuyper is very unjust when he reproaches the English with the\r\nmassacre of the Zulus; for it was all to the profit of the Boers, who,\r\nit may be added, rendered no assistance. Once delivered from their\r\nnative enemies by the English, the Boers appointed, December 16th, 1880,\r\na triumvirate, composed of Pretorius, Krüger and Joubert. They demanded\r\nthe re-instatement of the South African Republic, under British\r\nprotection; they commenced attacking small detachments of English\r\ntroops, and on February 27th they surrounded a force on Majuba Hill,\r\nkilling 92 officers and men, General Colley among them, wounding 134,\r\nand taking 59 prisoners. That is what is called \"the disaster of Majuba\r\nHill.\" An army of 12,000 men was on the way out; Mr. Gladstone, in his\r\nMidlothian Campaign, had protested against the annexation; and,\r\nalthough, after he became Prime Minister, he supported it in the speech\r\nfrom the Throne, the hopes he had given to the separatists proved well\r\nfounded, for after this defeat he became a party to the Convention of\r\n1881, by which the independence of the Transvaal, under the suzerainty\r\nof England, was recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_The Convention of 1881 inapplicable._\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, that the Liberal Government committed a grave\r\nerror. It seemed afraid of a rebellion among the Afrikanders of the\r\nCape; and these quickly learned that threats only were needed to induce\r\nthe English Government to yield to their demands. The English Garrison\r\nin Pretoria was withdrawn; no reparation was exacted from the Boers who,\r\nunder the command of Cronje, had conducted themselves in an infamous\r\nmanner at the siege of Potchefstroom, and had been guilty of actual\r\ntreachery in the case of Captains Elliot and Lambert.\r\n\r\nTrue, the Convention prescribed the suppression of slavery; gave\r\nguarantees for the safety of the persons and property of alien whites;\r\nplaced the foreign relations of the Transvaal under the control of the\r\nBritish Government. But, in reality, it was of little value, for the\r\nEnglish Resident was in the position of a man who has been conquered\r\nwith the pretension of controlling the actions of the conquerer.\r\n\r\nAt the first election under the new conditions, Krüger, who represented\r\nthe extreme reactionary party, was elected President, although he had\r\naccepted office under the British Government, while Joubert, who had\r\ndeclined any dealings with them, was defeated, being suspected of\r\nsympathising with the Uitlanders. His defeat does not prove him to have\r\nbeen in the minority. His partisans affirm, with a fair show of reason,\r\nthat Mr. Krüger never greatly respected the sanctity of the ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--_Violation by the Boers._\r\n\r\nThe powerlessness of the British Government to ensure respect for the\r\nConvention of 1881, explains its consent to the modification of 1884.\r\n\"It would be easy to find a _casus belli_ in the behaviour of the\r\nBoers,\" said Lord Derby in the House of Lords. But the Government had no\r\nwish to find one, and added to the weakness it had displayed after\r\nMajuba a fresh show of weakness, which convinced Mr. Krüger that the\r\nviolation of a convention was the easiest method of obtaining anything\r\nhe wanted.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, it is the British Government that is responsible for\r\nthe present war, through having inspired President Krüger with the\r\nconviction, that he had only to continue in 1899 the policy which had\r\nsucceeded so well in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF THE CONVENTION OF 1884.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Krüger's Point of View._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper has a simple method of solving difficulties. Speaking of\r\nArticle 4 of the Convention of 1884, which gives England the right of\r\nveto on all treaties contemplated between the South African Republic and\r\nforeign powers, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"This is not Mr. Krüger's point of view. He, like us, has always\r\n     stigmatised the occupation of 1877 as a violation of the Sand River\r\n     Treaty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger did not stigmatise it thus when he accepted office from the\r\nEnglish Government. But, in any case, he was party to the negotiations\r\nwhich resulted in the Conventions of 1881 and 1884. Dr. Kuyper tells us\r\nthat neither he nor Mr. Krüger recognise them, considering them to have\r\nbeen vitiated by the Annexation of 1877. Be it so; but in that view\r\ndiscussion is useless. Mr. Krüger held them as null and void. He has\r\nchosen his own time to declare war. A government has always the right to\r\ntear up a treaty just as a private individual has the right to refuse\r\nimplement of a contract. In the case of the individual, his refusal\r\nexposes him to a claim of damages; in the case of a country, the result\r\nis war. It is the simplest thing in the world; but then why go seeking\r\nfor pretexts and explanations, and worrying oneself about making\r\neverybody believe that it was England who brought about the war, when\r\nafter all she was only claiming the due execution of a convention?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Le Siècle_, March 27th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_England's Obligations._\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone committed the error of entering into the Convention\r\nof 1881, he fully believed that he was guaranteeing the rights of\r\nEnglish and foreign residents in the Transvaal, of the Boers who might\r\nhave compromised themselves with the English, and also of the natives.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Birmingham, on March 8th, 1881, on the motion of Sir\r\nWilfrid Lawson, a resolution was passed demanding that \"satisfaction\r\nshould be given to the claims of the Boers, without prejudice always to\r\nthe rights of the natives and English residents.\" On July 25th, Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach reminded the House of the necessity for exacting the\r\nnecessary guarantees, and of ensuring the tranquillity and security of\r\nthe English possessions.[8] He reminded the House of the position of\r\nthose 3,700 Boer petitioners who had asked for annexation, and of the\r\nBritish residents who had invested capital in the Transvaal, upon the\r\nguarantee of the British Government. Mr. William Rathbone proposed a\r\nresolution demanding equal political rights for all the white population\r\nin the Transvaal. Mr. Chamberlain stated that \"loyal settlers\" should\r\nbe protected in their legal rights, lives, and property. Mr. Gladstone,\r\nat the close of the debate, stated that \"they would all be in a position\r\nof most perfect equality with the other inhabitants.\" (July 25th, 1881.)\r\n\r\nThus, the British Government deliberately affirmed its obligations\r\ntowards the foreign, British, and black population of the Transvaal, and\r\nits determination not to forsake them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Britain and the Boers. \"Who is responsible for the War in\r\nSouth Africa?\" By Lewis Appleton.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_Equality of Rights among the Whites according to Mr. Krüger in\r\n1881._\r\n\r\nThe Blue Book of May, 1882, contains the report of the meeting of the\r\nBritish and Transvaal Commission of May 10th, 1881.\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger was a member of the latter, Sir Hercules Robinson was\r\nChairman. Here is a dialogue between the Chairman and Mr. Krüger:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Chairman: 'Before the Annexation, did British subjects enjoy\r\n     the rights of complete freedom of trade throughout the Transvaal?\r\n     Were they on the same footing as the citizens of the Transvaal?'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Krüger: 'They were on the same footing as the burghers. In\r\n     accordance with the Sand River Convention there was not the\r\n     slightest difference.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Hercules Robinson: 'I presume you do not object to that\r\n     continuing?'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Krüger: 'No. There will be equal protection for everybody.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Evelyn Wood: 'And equal privileges?'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Krüger: 'We make no difference so far as burgher rights are\r\n     concerned. There may be, perhaps, some slight difference in the\r\n     case of a young person who has just come into the country.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th May, Dr. Jorissen, a Boer delegate, reverting to the\r\nquestion, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Concerning the paragraph referring to a young person, I desire to\r\n     remove what may create an erroneous impression. What Mr. Krüger\r\n     meant to say is this; according to our law, a newcomer is not\r\n     immediately considered a burgher. The words 'young person' have not\r\n     reference to age but to length of residence. According to our\r\n     ancient 'Grondwet' (constitution) you must have resided one year in\r\n     the country to become a burgher.\"\r\n\r\nThese minutes were not compiled for the present occasion, for they were\r\npublished in 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_Preamble of the Convention of 1881._\r\n\r\nThe preamble of the convention is in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty's Commissioners for the settlement of the Transvaal\r\n     territory, duly appointed as such by a Commission, &c., the 5th day\r\n     of April, 1881, do hereby undertake and guarantee on behalf of Her\r\n     Majesty, that from and after the 8th day of August, 1881, complete\r\n     self-government, subject to the suzerainty of Her Majesty, her\r\n     heirs and successors, will be accorded to the inhabitants of the\r\n     Transvaal territory.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this is not a treaty between two parties contracting\r\non a footing of equality. The English Government grants the Transvaal\r\nthe right of self-government, reserving the suzerainty under certain\r\nconditions. I have already shown the difficulties in the way of carrying\r\nout the Convention of 1881, the false position of the Resident who was\r\nas one conquered, was supposed to control the actions of the conqueror;\r\nand I have also spoken of the great and long suffering of the English\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. R.D. Faure, who acted as interpreter to the Conference of 1884, has\r\nstated that \"the Transvaal delegates asked for a clause suppressing the\r\nsuzerainty, and that Lord Derby refused it.\" To this Mr. R.G.W. Herbert,\r\nPermanent Under Secretary for the Colonies, replied \"that the\r\nCommissioners did not venture to ask for the abolition of the\r\nsuzerainty.\" They confined themselves to asking in their letter to Lord\r\nDerby of November 14th, 1883, that \"the relation of dependence, _publici\r\njuris_, in which our Country finds itself placed with regard to the\r\nCrown of Great Britain should be replaced by that of two contracting\r\nparties.\"\r\n\r\nLord Derby on 29th November, answered that \"neither in form, nor in\r\nsubstance could the Government accept such a demand.\" The Government\r\nthus refused to substitute a \"treaty\" for a \"convention\" in which the\r\nQueen granted to the Transvaal the right of self-government under\r\ncertain conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_Articles 4, 7 and 14 of the Convention of 1884._\r\n\r\nThese conditions are determined by the articles 4, 7 and 14 of the\r\nconvention of 1884, of which the following is the text:--\r\n\r\n     \"Article 4. The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or\r\n     engagement with any State or Nation other than the Orange Free\r\n     State, nor with any native tribe to the Eastward or Westward of the\r\n     Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the\r\n     Queen.\r\n\r\n     \"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her\r\n     Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after the receipt\r\n     of a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them\r\n     immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion\r\n     of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain,\r\n     or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa.\r\n\r\n     \"Article 7. All persons who held property in the Transvaal on the\r\n     8th day of August, 1881, and still hold the same, will continue to\r\n     enjoy the rights of property which they have enjoyed since the 12th\r\n     April, 1877. No person who has remained loyal to Her Majesty during\r\n     the late hostilities shall suffer any molestation by reason of his\r\n     loyalty; or be liable to any criminal prosecution or civil action\r\n     for any part taken in connection with such hostilities; and all\r\n     such persons will have full liberty to reside in the country, with\r\n     enjoyment of all civil rights, and protection for their persons and\r\n     property.\r\n\r\n     \"Article 14. All persons, other than natives, conforming themselves\r\n     to the laws of the South African Republic (_a_) will have full\r\n     liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any\r\n     part of the South African Republic; (_b_) they will be entitled to\r\n     hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and\r\n     premises; (_c_) they may carry on their commerce either in person\r\n     or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (_d_) they will\r\n     not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in\r\n     respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether\r\n     general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon\r\n     Citizens of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Kuyper's estimation the Articles 7 and 14 are as nothing. I do\r\nnot even think he makes mention of them in his article (fifty-three\r\npages in length), that has appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.\r\nThus, nothing is easier than to argue in the vacuum he creates about his\r\nreaders. They hear nothing but words; of the facts they are kept in\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLAW AND JUSTICE IN THE TRANSVAAL.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Contempt of Justice._\r\n\r\nI stated at the close of my last article that I did not think that Dr.\r\nKuyper had even made mention of Articles 7 and 14 of the Convention of\r\n1884. I find that I was mistaken. He has said a few words about the\r\nlatter, to draw from it the inference that it did not give the right of\r\nfranchise to Uitlanders. He is right.\r\n\r\nBut Articles 7 and 14 guarantee to all white men, civil rights, the\r\nprotection of their persons and property, the right to enter into trade,\r\nand equality of taxation. How did the Boers construe the application of\r\nthese conditions of the Convention of 1884? As early as 1885 Mr.\r\nGladstone found himself obliged to send Sir Charles Warren to prevent\r\nthe Boers from invading Bechuanaland. Mr. Krüger had already attacked\r\nMafeking, and annexed the territory. The Boers retreated, but brutally\r\nmurdered a man named Bethell who had been wounded by them.\r\n\r\nThat same year, the case of Mr. James Donaldson came before the House of\r\nCommons. He held property in Lydenburg. He had been ordered by two Boers\r\n(one of whom was in the habit of boasting that he had shot an unarmed\r\nEnglishman since the beginning of the war, and had fired on several\r\nothers) to abstain from collecting hut taxes on his own farm. On his\r\nrefusal he was attacked by them; three other Boers joined them, and he\r\nwas left in such a condition that he was thought to be dead.\r\n\r\nUpon the representations of the English Government the aggressors were\r\ncondemned to pay a fine; but the Government of Pretoria remitted it!\r\n\r\nAn Indian, a British subject and man of education far superior to that\r\nof the greater part of the Boers, while following a bridle path\r\ntrespassed on the farm property of a member of the Volksraad, named\r\nMeyer. He was arrested, and accused of intent to steal. Sent before the\r\nowner's brother, who was a \"field cornet\" (district judge), he was\r\ncondemned, with each of the Hottentot servants accompanying him, to\r\nreceive twenty-five lashes, and to pay a fine. Rachmann protested,\r\ndeclared that the field cornet was exceeding his authority, intimated an\r\nappeal, and offered bail of £40; notwithstanding, he received the\r\ntwenty-five lashes. George Meyer, the field cornet, knew perfectly well\r\nthat he was exceeding his authority, but thought it too good a joke to\r\ndesist. The Court, presided over by Mr. Jorissen, condemned him to pay\r\ndamages to Rachmann. This was reimbursed to Meyer by the Government,\r\nand, despite the judgment of the Court, the President said he was in the\r\nright, and that he would protect him.\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which Mr. Krüger understands justice towards\r\nEuropeans and European subjects; let us see how he understands it with\r\nregard to natives.\r\n\r\nA Kaffir, named April, having worked several years on a farm, asked for\r\nhis salary as agreed in cattle and a pass. The farmer refused him the\r\ncattle, and wanted to force him, his wives, and children, to continue\r\nworking for him. The Kaffir appealed to the field cornet Prinsloo, who\r\ntreated him as an unruly slave. The Court condemned Prinsloo for abuse\r\nof power. Some days later the President announced that he had reimbursed\r\nPrinsloo his expenses and damages, remarking: \"Notwithstanding the\r\njudgment of the Court, we consider Prinsloo to have been in the right.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Le Siècle_ 29th March, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Confusion of Powers._\r\n\r\nThe Volksraad confuses legislative and judicial functions. Should a\r\njudgment displease it, it arrogates to itself the right to annul it. Nor\r\nis there any more respect shown by the Volksraad for contracts, and, on\r\none occasion, it solemnly accorded to the Government the right to annul\r\nclauses which had ceased to be satisfactory. It is unnecessary to add\r\nthat the principle of the non-retrospectiveness of laws is altogether\r\nunknown to it.\r\n\r\nIn the Dom case the Volksraad passed a resolution disabling the\r\naggrieved individual from taking action against the Government.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1897, the Government appointed for a given day, the\r\nallocation of the Witfontein farm in \"claims\" (mine concessions of 150\r\nby 400 feet). At the last moment it was announced that the claims would\r\nbe decided by lottery; several persons having made known that they\r\nintended to sue the Government for their claims already pegged out, a\r\nmeasure was passed by the Volksraad declaring all such actions null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Brown, an American, took proceedings. The President of the High\r\nCourt, Mr. Kotzé, pronounced that this law was unconstitutional, and\r\ngave judgment in favor of Brown, but left the amount of damages to be\r\ndetermined later after hearing further evidence.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Mr. Krüger introduced a law known as Law I. of 1897, which\r\nempowered him to exact assurances from the judges that they would\r\nrespect all resolutions of the Volksraad, without testing whether they\r\nwere in accord or contradiction with the Constitution; and in the event\r\nof the President not being satisfied with the replies of the judges, it\r\nfurther empowered him to dismiss them summarily. The judges protested in\r\na body that they would not submit to such treatment. The High Court was\r\nsuspended and all legal business adjourned.\r\n\r\nSir Henry de Villiers, Chief Justice of Cape Colony, came to Pretoria to\r\nendeavour to avert the crisis. Mr. Krüger promised to refrain from\r\nenforcing Law I. of 1897, and to introduce a new law. The judges resumed\r\ntheir functions.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1898, a year later, President Krüger had not introduced a\r\nnew law; President Kotzé wrote to Krüger reminding him of his promise.\r\nMr. Krüger at once applied to him Law I. of 1897, and dismissed him.\r\n\r\nKotzé was replaced by Mr. Gregorowski, who, at the time the law was\r\npassed had solemnly protested that no honourable man could continue to\r\nact as a judge in the Transvaal until the law was repealed.\r\n\r\nNow what does Dr. Kuyper think of the Volksraad's mode of legislation,\r\nand of the manner in which Mr. Krüger, that man \"of intelligence and\r\nsuperior morality,\" interprets respect for justice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOLICE, JUSTICE, AND LAW ACCORDING TO BOER METHODS.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Legal and Judicial System of the Transvaal._\r\n\r\nIn the Transvaal, law is an instrument made use of either to favor or\r\noppress the individual, according to circumstances. If necessary it is\r\nmade retrospective. To provide for the case of judges refusing to apply\r\nsuch laws, Law I. of 1897 has been passed, which compels them to swear\r\nobedience to the President and gives him the right to dismiss summarily\r\nsuch as prove insubordinate or lukewarm. The President of the High\r\nCourt, Mr. Kotzé, fell under the action of this law, in February, 1898.\r\n\r\nBefore that law, the President annulled any judgments that displeased\r\nhim and caused the fines or damages inflicted upon the delinquents to be\r\npaid out of the public Treasury.\r\n\r\nSuch is judicial and legal rule in the Transvaal; and there are European\r\nlawyers of the opinion that the Uitlanders must be the most contemptible\r\nand lowest set of adventurers for not being satisfied with it! Dr.\r\nKuyper declares that \"the factitious discontent existed only among the\r\nEnglish\"; and adds with contempt, \"Let us look into the Edgar,\r\nLombaard, and Amphitheatre cases--mere police affairs.\"\r\n\r\nWell; let us consider Mr. Krüger's interpretation of the duties of the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Le Siècle,_ March 30th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Police._\r\n\r\nThe chief of the departments of justice and police is called the State\r\nAttorney.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, when Mr. Esselen was promoted to the post, he stipulated that\r\nhe should have full liberty of action. As chief detective officer he\r\nappointed an officer belonging to the Cape Administration, Mr. Andrew\r\nTrimble, who entered upon his duties with vigour and determination. The\r\ngold thieves and receivers and the illicit canteen keepers who supplied\r\nthe natives with liquor were up in arms at once and appealed to\r\nPresident Krüger. They represented Trimble as having served in the\r\nEnglish Army, and as being in receipt of a pension from the Cape\r\nGovernment, further stating that his appointment was an insult to the\r\nBoers, who had been thus judged unworthy to provide from among\r\nthemselves a Head of Police. Mr. Esselen, who stood his ground, was\r\ndismissed and replaced by a Hollander, Dr. Coster. Mr. Trimble, chief of\r\nthe detective force, was replaced by a man who had previously been\r\ndismissed, and has since been dismissed again.\r\n\r\nAs it was useless to depend upon the police for the arrest of thieves,\r\nthe directors and officials of the _City and Suburban Gold Mining\r\nCompany_ took upon themselves the risks and dangers of police work. They\r\ncaught two notorious characters, known thieves, with gold in their\r\npossession. The thieves openly boasted that nothing would be done to\r\nthem; the next day, one was allowed to escape, the other, a notorious\r\ncriminal, was condemned to six months' imprisonment. Mr. Krüger regarded\r\nthis penalty as excessive, remitted three-fourths of the sentence, and\r\nhad him discharged unconditionally.\r\n\r\nThe police of Johannesburg, a town almost entirely inhabited by English,\r\ndo not speak English--an excellent method of ensuring order! They are\r\nchosen from among the worst types of Boers, some of whom are the\r\ndescendants of English deserters and Kaffir women; whence comes the fact\r\nthat some bear English names. The policeman Jones, who killed Edgar, is\r\na case in point.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Edgar was a small matter in the same way as the Dreyfus\r\ncase was a small matter; only when a case of this nature arises, it\r\nreveals a condition of things so grave that it excites widespread\r\nfeeling at once.\r\n\r\nEdgar was an English workman, a boilermaker, who had been a long time in\r\nJohannesburg; a well-conducted man and generally respected. He was going\r\nhome, one Sunday night in 1898, when three drunken men insulted and set\r\nupon him. He knocked one of them down. The other two called the police.\r\nEdgar, meanwhile, entered his own house. Four policemen broke open his\r\ndoor, and the instant Edgar came out into the passage, Policeman Jones\r\nshot him dead with a revolver. \"A mere police row,\" says Dr. Kuyper.\r\n\r\nJones was arrested next morning, but straightway released upon a bail of\r\n£200. The money was not even paid in, but carried over to be deducted\r\nmonthly from the future salaries of other members of the Johannesburg\r\npolice force.\r\n\r\nFeeling was strong among the other English workmen, many of whom knew\r\nEdgar; and this feeling was intensified by the subsequent parody of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_An Ingenious Collusion._\r\n\r\nThe State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, informed the Acting British Agent, Mr.\r\nFraser, that it would be better to bring a charge against Policeman\r\nJones, for \"culpable homicide\" than for murder, but that he considered\r\nthe chance of his conviction by a Boer jury to be very small. The word\r\n\"culpable,\" says Webster (English Dictionary) is \"applied to acts which\r\nhave not the gravity of crime.\" In this instance, it made Jones' action\r\nexcusable on the grounds that Edgar struck him with a stick, at the\r\nmoment of his entering the house.\r\n\r\nA journalist, Mr. J.S. Dunn, Editor of _The Critic_, commented upon the\r\naction of Dr. Krause, the First Public Prosecutor. Dr. Krause took\r\ncriminal action against Mr. Dunn for libel, and, before proceeding with\r\nthe murder trial, appeared as witness in his own case, and swore that he\r\ndid not consider that Jones had been guilty of murder; he not only made\r\nthis statement on oath, but called the Second Public Prosecutor who gave\r\nsimilar evidence. Nor was this all. He brought forward the accused\r\nhimself, as witness to state that the First Public Prosecutor was right\r\nin not committing him for murder!\r\n\r\nWhen this ghastly farce had been performed, which is much on a footing\r\nwith the examination of Esterhazy by Pellieux, the murderer was free to\r\npresent himself confidently before a Boer jury. Not only was he\r\nacquitted, but the presiding judge, Kock, who had claimed a judgeship as\r\na \"son of the soil,\" in pronouncing judgment added this little speech:\r\n\"I hope that this verdict will show the police how to do their duty.\"\r\nThis amiable conclusion did not seem very re-assuring to the Uitlanders.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mr. Krüger suppressed two newspapers, _The Critic_ and\r\n_The Star_. (See Blue Book C. 9, 345.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_The Lombaard Case._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper states that Edgar was in the wrong, that Jones acted within\r\nhis rights, that the Public Prosecutor and the jury fulfilled their\r\nduty. As for Lombaard, \"he too,\" Dr. Kuyper tells us, \"was a\r\nJohannesburg policeman, and like Jones a little rough in his mode of\r\naction\".... \"He committed no outrage; the sole reproach attaching to him\r\nwas that he conducted his search at night, and without a special\r\nwarrant.\" And Dr. Kuyper is very contemptuous of any who may be disposed\r\nto question such proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that Lombaard, at the head of sixteen or eighteen police,\r\nhad taken upon himself, without warrant, to enter the houses of coloured\r\nBritish subjects, men and women, to demand their passes; to send them to\r\nprison whether right or wrong; to ill-treat and flog them. A mere\r\ntrifle; scarce worth talking about; they were only people of colour, and\r\nDr. Kuyper has told us his ideas on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe Edgar case was the origin of the petition of the 21,000 Uitlanders\r\nto the English Government, to ask the protection it had undertaken to\r\nextend to them under the Convention of 1884.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have given in _Le Siècle_ of the 29th March, and those\r\nI now give here, are sufficient to prove that under Mr. Krüger's\r\nGovernment, police, justice and law do not exist in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS ACCORDING TO BOER IDEAS.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_The Amphitheatre Case._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper proceeds with charming serenity:\r\n\r\n\"The affair called the 'Amphitheatre Case' is more ridiculous still.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is his mode of telling it:--\r\n\r\n     \"One day the _South African League_ wished to hold a meeting in the\r\n     Amphitheatre, and, through Mr. Wybergh, intimated to the State\r\n     Attorney that they preferred not to be hampered by the presence of\r\n     the police. In conformity with this wish, the State Attorney\r\n     telegraphed to the Johannesburg police to keep away. But scarcely\r\n     had the meeting commenced before the opponents of the League\r\n     invaded the hall; and the few police stationed at the door were\r\n     unable to separate the combatants quickly enough. There followed\r\n     complaints to London ...\"\r\n\r\nThis is Dr. Kuyper's account. I would ask him, in the first place, why\r\nhe does not give the date of this meeting, which took place on the 14th\r\nof January, 1899, one month after the death of Edgar. Secondly, what was\r\nthe object of this meeting? Dr. Kuyper is silent on these points. He\r\nspeaks of the step taken by Mr. Wybergh, but he altogether misrepresents\r\nit, forgetting that Mr. Wybergh has given his own account of it.\r\n\r\nIn the serious condition of affairs in Johannesburg at that time, he\r\nwent to the State Attorney and the Secretary of State, to acquaint them\r\nwith his intention to hold a meeting in a large building, called the\r\nAmphitheatre, generally used as a circus. He informed them that the\r\nmeeting was convened for three objects: 1. To protest against the arrest\r\nof Messrs. T.R. Dodd and C.D. Webb; 2. To protest against the law of\r\npublic meetings; 3. To obtain signatures to a petition praying for the\r\nprotection of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe State Attorney and Secretary of State replied that \"although the\r\nobjects of this meeting were naturally distasteful to the Transvaal\r\nGovernment, they did not forbid the meeting. Only, all persons who\r\nshould commit acts of violence, or who should make use of seditious\r\nlanguage, would be held personally responsible.\"\r\n\r\nLadies were invited to attend the meeting, which was held at four\r\no'clock in the afternoon. The members of the League were unarmed.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived, they found the hall already in possession of three or\r\nfour hundred burghers, who had been recruited by Papenfus, Acting Road\r\nInspector, and were acting under the orders of Mr. Broeksma, Third\r\nPublic Prosecutor, and Mr. de Villiers, Second Public Prosecutor. These\r\nmen were placed in groups about the Amphitheatre. No sooner had the\r\nmeeting begun, than, on a signal given by Mr. Broeksma, chairs were\r\nbroken, and, under the orders of Sergeant Smith, of the municipal\r\npolice, of Erasmus, of the special police, Lieutenants Murphy and Keller\r\nof the secret police, and, with the assistance of policemen in uniform,\r\nthey commenced an assault upon the members. Lieutenant Posthuysen, on\r\nhorseback in the arena, encouraged the rioters.\r\n\r\nNothing could show Dr. Kuyper's manner of stating and interpreting facts\r\nbetter than the following sentence:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was simply a matter of the careful protection of British\r\n     subjects, or rather of the worthy apostles of Johannesburg, who had\r\n     begun by saying to the magistrates of the Transvaal 'keep away your\r\n     police!' and who, later, crawling back from this meeting, after\r\n     being well thrashed, complained bitterly that the police had not\r\n     protected them.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper seems to think it highly amusing that the \"worthy apostles of\r\nJohannesburg had been well thrashed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we find a European Dutchman, a man of letters, showing such animus\r\nin the examination of facts, one may judge of what the Boers are\r\ncapable, ignorant and rough as they are, and inflated with the\r\nconviction that they are the elect people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Le Siècle_, March 31st, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Different modes of estimating bail._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that one of the objects of the meeting had been to protest\r\nagainst the arrests of Messrs. Dodd and Webb. These two gentlemen had\r\nbeen arrested as the organisers of an illegal meeting in the public\r\nmarket square, a public place, where no speeches had been made, but\r\nwhere the petition to the Queen had been openly read, before they had\r\ntaken it to the British Vice-Consul. To obtain their release they had\r\neach to find sureties of £1,000, while Jones, Edgar's murderer, had been\r\nset at liberty on bail being found for £200 unpaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_The Uitlanders' Petition._\r\n\r\nThese proceedings only resulted in more signatures to the petition\r\naddressed to the Queen. When Sir Alfred Milner, March 28th, 1899,\r\nforwarded a copy to Mr. Chamberlain it contained 21,684 signatures. Sir\r\nAlfred Milner did not undertake to guarantee the authenticity of them\r\nall, but gave reasons for considering the greater number as _bonâ fide_.\r\n\r\nMr. Wybergh in a letter of April 10th, to the British Vice-Consul,\r\nexplains the measures that had been taken to collect and verify the\r\nsignatures. They were such as to inspire confidence. He states that\r\namong the whole number, only 700 are of illiterate or coloured people;\r\nand adds, that after the dispatch of the petition 1,300 other signatures\r\nwere sent in, thus raising the total to 23,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Pretoria, after a lapse of more than a month succeeded\r\nin raising a counter-petition addressed to itself, which, at first, it\r\nstated, contained 9,000 signatures; some time later, on the 30th of May,\r\nthe British Government was informed that it numbered 23,000 signatures.\r\nKrüger wished to prove that he had at least the same number of\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nOnly he had out-witted himself in the drawing up of this\r\ncounter-petition. His signatories affirmed that security of property\r\nand individuals was assured in the Transvaal. Pangloss, himself, would\r\nnot have gone so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_Security of the Individual according to Boer ideas._\r\n\r\nKrüger's petitioners further asserted that the petition to the Queen was\r\n\"the work of capitalists and not of the public.\" As a matter of fact,\r\nincensed at the murder of Edgar--a working man--the men who were the\r\nfirst to sign that petition were working men. The principal mining\r\ncompany of Johannesburg had shown an example of that prudence we see too\r\noften among capitalists, and had dismissed Mr. Wybergh, the President of\r\nthe _South African League_, who was one of their employés. The President\r\nof the Chamber of Mines, Mr. Rouliot, in his statement of January 26th,\r\n1899, took pains to dissociate it from the campaign of agitation. This\r\ndisplay of weakness availed nothing. The Government of Pretoria took up\r\nthe attitude that has succeeded so well in deceiving public opinion:\r\nthat of a council composed of honest men, innocent victims of capitalist\r\nrapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_The Murder of Mrs. Appelbe._\r\n\r\nHere is a proof of the security enjoyed by the Uitlanders, at the very\r\ntime when the Government of Pretoria closed its list of signatures to\r\nthe counter-petition. On Friday April 28th, Mrs. Appelbe, the wife of a\r\nWesleyan minister of Johannesburg, was going to chapel accompanied by a\r\nMr. Wilson, a chemist. They were set upon by a band of men in the pay,\r\nit is said, of canteen keepers, sellers of liquor to the natives. Mrs.\r\nAppelbe received such severe injuries that she died on the Thursday\r\nfollowing. Mr. Wilson, who was badly wounded in the head, eventually\r\nrecovered. On May 8th, the police affected to know nothing of the\r\noutrage; nor did they ever discover the murderers of Mrs. Appelbe, thus\r\nproving the grand irony of the apologist petition which \"emphatically\"\r\naffirmed the complete security of life and property in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBOER OLIGARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper, who has juggled with these facts, enumerates with a sort of\r\namazed frankness the reproaches addressed to the Transvaal Government:\r\n\r\n     The relations between legislative and judicial authority give rise\r\n     to comments which cannot be considered groundless.... It has been\r\n     called scandalous that the Chief Justice of the High Court should\r\n     have been deposed. But, in 1839, President Johnson, of the United\r\n     States, met the difficulty by making a majority of nine in the High\r\n     Court, thus assuring to himself a compliant majority.\r\n\r\nThere is a mis-print in the Article in the _Revue de Deux Mondes_. The\r\ndate should be 1869 not 1839; and truly Dr. Kuyper has lighted upon a\r\ngood example in his selection of President Johnson; the only President\r\nof the United States who has been impeached!\r\n\r\nI know that sort of argument generally employed by people who are in the\r\nwrong and especially employed by people whom Dr. Kuyper can scarcely\r\nbring forward as models. \"All very well, but what of that little slip of\r\nyours.\" ... Dr. Kuyper might as reasonably invoke _la loi de\r\ndessaisissement_ voted by the French Chamber last year. Our answer to\r\nhim is that the violation of the most elementary principles of justice\r\nin one country, does not justify it in another. He proceeds:\r\n\r\n     \"The Boer Government is said to be an oligarchy. And yet every\r\n     citizen has his vote--Throughout the land there are juries....\"\r\n\r\nReally Dr. Kuyper affects too great _naïveté_. The Boers may have\r\ncreated a democracy among themselves; with regard to natives and\r\nUitlanders they are an oligarchy.\r\n\r\n\"Every citizen has his vote\": But Mr. Krüger's argument for refusing the\r\nfranchise to Uitlanders is that they numbered 70,000, while the Burghers\r\nwere only 30,000. Here we have a minority governing the majority; what\r\nelse is an oligarchy?\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the land there are juries\"; yes, but juries made up of Boers\r\nwho try Uitlanders, treat them as enemies, and find that the policeman\r\nJones acted rightly in killing Edgar. That way of constituting a jury is\r\na certainty of injustice to the Uitlanders, and not a guarantee of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nPresident Krüger promised to do something for the municipal organisation\r\nof Johannesburg; this is how he keeps his promise. Each division of that\r\ntown elects two members, a Burgher and an Uitlander; according to the\r\nlast census, the burghers living in Johannesburg, numbered 1,039; the\r\nUitlanders 23,503; thus 1,039 burghers had as many representatives in\r\nthe municipal Corporation as the 23,503 Uitlanders. The Mayor, who was\r\nnominated by the Government, had the right of absolute veto.\r\n\r\nIn modern law there exists a principle introduced by England, which is\r\nthe true basis of representative Government: \"no representation, no\r\ntaxation.\" It is the right of every citizen who contributes to the taxes\r\nto approve of them and to control the use of them.\r\n\r\nIn autocratic governments, he has no such right. In oligarchic\r\ngovernments, the governing class imposes burdens upon those it governs.\r\nThis is the case in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nIn an oligarchy, taxes are not levied with a view to the general good of\r\nthe community, but for the benefit of the ruling class; and this is the\r\npolitical conception of the Boers.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper says, in speaking of the Uitlanders:\r\n\r\n     \"No one invited them here; they came of their own accord.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore they possess the right to be taxed, but nothing else.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper's assertion is not strictly correct; for he forgets the\r\ninvitation addressed by Mr. Krüger, in London in 1884, to all who were\r\nwilling to take their abilities and their capital to the Transvaal, in\r\nwhich he promised them rights of citizenship and assured them of his\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nBut the matter of invitation is of little account. Let us allow that\r\nthere was no invitation. Neither did Fra Diavolo invite the travellers\r\nhe despoiled; _ergo._, according to Dr. Kuyper, he had the right to\r\ndespoil them. The Uitlanders are travellers, at whose expense the\r\ngovernment of Pretoria has the right to live, and to support the Boers.\r\n\r\nSuch is plainly the idea of Mr. Krüger and of the majority of the 29\r\nmembers of the Volksraad, and we shall see that that idea underlies the\r\nwhole of its political economy.\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger was, however, in error in supposing that he could practise\r\nthis system indefinitely in these times of ours, and with respect to the\r\ncitizens of a country which represents the modern conception of\r\nindustrial civilization.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bryce, a strong opponent of the present policy of England,\r\nsays in his _Impressions of South Africa_ (p. 470):\r\n\r\n     \"A country must after all take its character from the large\r\n     majority of its inhabitants, especially when those who form that\r\n     majority are the wealthiest, most educated, and most enterprising\r\n     part of the population.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger has aimed at realizing this paradox: the oppression and\r\nplunder of the most enterprising, most educated, the richest and most\r\nnumerous portion of the population by the poorest, most ignorant, most\r\nindolent of minorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT THE GOLD MINES.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_That Gold is Mine!_\r\n\r\nLet us see in what terms Dr. Kuyper justifies the Boer policy of\r\nexaction:\r\n\r\n     \"The Leonards and their set are very ready to tell us that the\r\n     taxes in Johannesburg exceed in proportion those levied in every\r\n     other country.... As to the quota paid by Uitlanders to the State,\r\n     we beg leave to remind the British of two points: first, that they\r\n     are exempt from all military service; secondly, that it is a far\r\n     more serious matter for the Boers to pay with their lives, and the\r\n     lives of their sons, than it is for these wealthy owners of gold\r\n     mines to pay so much per cent. upon their enormous dividends; and\r\n     that if they do pay the Transvaal some thousands of pounds, they\r\n     pocket their millions. Moreover, love for the Transvaal has never\r\n     entered their metallised hearts.\"\r\n\r\nThis little gem merits careful analysis. Mr. Kuyper shares the belief\r\nthat one has only to go to Johannesburg to shovel in the gold. If the\r\nworking of mines were so simple a matter, Boer intelligence would be\r\nequal to the undertaking. As they are not worked by them, it must be\r\nbecause there are difficulties. These difficulties have been overcome\r\nfor them by the Uitlanders. Once overcome, the Boers present themselves\r\nand say: \"That gold is mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then did you not take it yourselves?\"\r\n\r\nThe Boers, who pride themselves upon driving their teams of oxen, but\r\nwho consider that to in-span them is work only fit for Kaffirs, consider\r\ngold mining beneath them, let alone that they have not the capacity for\r\nit. They leave it to the Uitlanders: all the same, Dr. Kuyper holds it\r\njust that it is they who should take the profit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Le Siècle_, 3rd April, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Proportion of Gold per Ton._\r\n\r\nGold ore is found in infinitesimal quantities in large deposits of waste\r\nmatter. In 1898 of the 77 Gold Mining Companies at work, three-fourths\r\nreported a yield of 1/2 oz. per ton; some only 6 to 7 dwts. per ton.\r\nConsequently we find mines worked where one ton of rock will yield 1/2\r\noz. of ore, or perhaps only half as much. There are other mines which\r\nswallow up the capital, and give no return at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_Cost of Production._\r\n\r\nIn 1892 gold producing in the Transvaal cost 35s. 6d. per ton; in 1897\r\nthe cost was reduced to 28s. 6d.; in 1898 to 27s. 6d. This reduction of\r\ncost is in no way due to any reforms made by the Government, but to\r\nimprovements in the methods employed, and especially to the more\r\nextensive use of compressed air drills.\r\n\r\nOut of 8,965,960 tons of ore raised in the Witwatersrand nearly 18.2 per\r\ncent. had to be thrown out; that is: about 1,634,500 tons of ore were\r\nrejected as sterile. In some cases the proportion of sterile ore has\r\namounted to as much as 40 per cent. The cost of production from the\r\ndeep levels is 34s. 6d. Out of the profits of each month, expenses and\r\nthe cost of working material have to be met. (Speech of Mr. Rouliot,\r\nPresident of _The Chamber of Mines_, January 26th, 1899.)[13]\r\n\r\nMr. J.H. Curle in his valuable work _The Gold Mines of the World_,\r\npublished in 1899, estimated the debts of the Rand Companies at\r\n£5,515,000. \"It is not unusual,\" he writes, \"for the directors of a deep\r\nlevel mine to spend £500,000 before one single ton has been crushed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See the _Revue Sud-Africaine_ (Paris), February 26th,\r\n1899.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_A Gold Mine is an Industrial Undertaking._\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of the Industrial Commission appointed to\r\ninquire into the mining industry, there were, in 1896, 183 gold mines in\r\nthe Transvaal. Of these 79 had been gold-producing, while 104, still in\r\nprocess of development, had as yet produced nothing. Of the 183 only 25\r\nhad paid dividends.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, a year of great progress, of the 156 mines situated in the\r\nRand, 40 only were paying dividends, representing, on an average, a\r\nreturn of 8.7 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn reality, a gold mine is as entirely an industrial undertaking, as is\r\nany other form of commerce; for its proper development it requires men\r\nof the highest capacity, not a mere set of adventurers, as Dr. Kuyper\r\nand other Pro-Boers tell the simpletons who judge without examining\r\nfacts. This is what is said on the subject by Mr. Curle, who saw the\r\nmines at work during his extended and conscientious enquiry:\r\n\r\n     \"The average mine manager, whether in South Africa, or India, or\r\n     Australia, or wherever I have met him, is an extremely capable man.\r\n     Of course, there are exceptions--some managers are not capable;\r\n     some are not even honest, but, as a rule, those in actual charge of\r\n     our gold mines to-day are men who can be relied on, but I do not\r\n     wish to confine my praise to the managers only. The mine captain,\r\n     whose valuable qualities are known more to the manager than to\r\n     outsiders, is usually a most capable man, and devoted to his work.\r\n     Many and many a time, after his hard day's work should have been\r\n     over, has a mine captain cheerfully started off with me on a three\r\n     or four hours inspection of his workings, only too delighted to\r\n     oblige, and asking merely that his visitor should show an\r\n     intelligent interest in what he saw. To these men, and to the other\r\n     heads of departments, to battery managers, cyanide works managers,\r\n     assayers, samplers, surveyors, office staff; the shareholders in\r\n     every mine owe a debt which they do not realise and which is often\r\n     inadequately acknowledged. Amongst these men--I could give hundreds\r\n     of examples--there is the greatest sense of duty to their\r\n     employers, and from one year's end to another, by day and night, in\r\n     the bush, on mountain tops, in fever swamps, in wild and deep\r\n     places all over the world, they faithfully carry through their\r\n     arduous work.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the type of Uitlander the gold mines have attracted; add to\r\nthem, mechanics and the most highly skilled artisans: for it is to the\r\ninterest of the mines which pay high salaries to employ the most skilled\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nA population such as this, has nothing in common with the adventurers\r\nwho rushed to the placers of California, or with the fancy picture of\r\nthe \"wealthy metal-hearted mine owners,\" presented to us by Dr. Kuyper.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_Distribution of the Gold Production._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper speaks of \"the vultures\" who come to rob the country of its\r\ngold; we would point out to him that before gold can be extracted from\r\nthe rock, a vast amount must be sunk in it. We have just seen that the\r\ncost of production often exceeds the profits.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper, in his childish innocence, imagines that \"the vultures\"\r\ncarry off the gold as soon as it is extracted.\r\n\r\nHad he taken the trouble to ascertain the facts, he would have seen that\r\nthe greater part of this gold remains in the Transvaal, and either goes\r\nto the Government, or to defray the cost of production.\r\n\r\nI borrow the following figures from the supplement to _The Critic_ of\r\nJuly 8th, 1899.\r\n\r\nLet us take the last five years:--\r\n\r\n      Gross Profits.   Dividend to   Paid to Boer\r\n                      Shareholders.   Government.\r\n\r\n1894     £7,930,481    £1,595,963    £2,247,728\r\n1895      8,768,942     2,329,941     2,923,648\r\n1896      8,742,811     1,918,631     3,912,095\r\n1897     11,514,016     2,923,574     3,956,402\r\n1898     15,942,573     4,999,489     3,329,958\r\n        -----------   -----------   -----------\r\n        £52,898,823   £13,767,598   £16,370,387\r\n        ===========   ===========   ===========\r\n\r\nThus upon £52,898,823 worth of gold produced between the years 1894 and\r\n1898 only 25 per cent. of this amount went to the shareholders, 30 per\r\ncent. was paid to the Transvaal Government, while the cost of production\r\nabsorbed 45 per cent. The two last figures show that about 75 per cent.,\r\nthat is to say, three-quarters of the entire production remained in the\r\nTransvaal; and we have only taken the average of the last few years,\r\nduring which the cost of production has been reduced to a minimum,\r\nthanks to the perfecting of the methods of working.\r\n\r\nLet us add that while according to the above table in 1898 the estimate\r\nof the revenue was £3,329,000, the expenditure rose to £3,476,000. In\r\n1899, the estimate of the revenue was £4,087,000.\r\n\r\nFrom 1894-97 the amount paid directly into the Transvaal Exchequer had\r\nexceeded the shareholders' dividends; and when the reverse happened in\r\n1898, the Government of Pretoria determined to put that matter right.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--_Cost of Production and the Transvaal._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper also complained that the entire cost of production was not\r\nabsorbed by the Transvaal. In his statement of January 26th 1899, Mr.\r\nRouliot proved that the greater portion was in point of fact expended\r\nthere. He gave the following figures concerning the expenditure of\r\nfifty-six companies in 1898.\r\n\r\nThe mines had only imported direct to the amount of £369,000, paid for\r\nmachinery, which could only be constructed in Europe, and for Cyanide,\r\nto avoid having to buy the latter from a local trust, which raised the\r\nprice 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nThrough local firms they had imported machinery and certain products to\r\nthe amount of £324,438. From local merchants they had bought machinery,\r\n&c., to the amount of £2,487,660. They had paid £767,600 to the Dynamite\r\nMonopoly. They had distributed £3,329,000 in salaries to their employés,\r\nnative or European. If we take it that the expenditure of the sixty\r\nother Mining Companies, gold or coal, in the vicinity of Johannesburg,\r\nwas similar to the above, we have a total of something like nine million\r\npounds sterling put in circulation, _plus_ purchases of dynamite, _plus_\r\nmerchandise bought through the medium of local tradespeople. Thus we see\r\nthat the bulk of the cost of production actually remained in the\r\nTransvaal.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.--_What the \"Vultures\" brought._\r\n\r\nBefore Dr. Kuyper's \"vultures\" came to despoil it, the Transvaal was in\r\na very shaky condition. It was heavily in debt and the Exchequer was\r\nempty; the Boer having always had a horror of paying his taxes. In 1884\r\nwhen Messrs. Krüger and Smits came to London to sign the famous\r\nConvention, and stayed at the Albemarle Hotel, they found themselves,\r\nafter the first few weeks unable to pay their bill, and Baron Grant had\r\nto come to their assistance. Now the \"vultures\" have been pouring some\r\nmillions annually into the coffers of the Transvaal; a certain\r\nproportion of which has stuck to the fingers of Mr. Krüger, his family\r\nand intimates. The \"vultures\" have brought riches, industry, and\r\ncivilisation into a wild and uncivilised country. The simile of the bird\r\nof prey is more applicable to the Boer than to the Uitlander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL POLICY OF THE BOERS[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Receipt of the Boer Exchequer._\r\n\r\nLike every true aristocrat, the Boer has always had a horror of paying\r\ntaxes; he only approves of taxes paid by others.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the annexation of the Transvaal by England in 1877, the\r\nGovernment was being crushed by debt, the burghers resolutely refusing\r\nto pay their taxes.\r\n\r\nSome order was brought into the finances by England; but the Boer revolt\r\nin December, 1880, was caused by the determination of Colonel Owen\r\nLanyon, the English Resident, to seize the bullocks and wagons of\r\nrecalcitrant tax-payers.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Government obtained the Convention of 1881. In 1883, the\r\nbudget showed £143,000 revenue, and £184,000 expenditure. From April\r\n1st, 1884, to March 31st, 1885, the revenue rose to £161,000, the\r\nexpenditure remained at £184,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, the gold mines were discovered, and in 1889, the revenue rose\r\nto £1,577,000. The crisis of 1890 caused it to drop below the million;\r\nin 1892 it rose again, reaching in:--\r\n\r\n1894             £2,247,728\r\n1895              2,923,648\r\n1896              3,912,095\r\n1897              3,956,402\r\n1898              3,329,958\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1899, it was estimated at £4,087,000. These figures do not include\r\nthe sale of explosives from 1895 to 1898; the share of licences of\r\nclaims from 1895 to 1899; nor the Delagoa Bay customs dues paid to the\r\nNetherlands Railway for 1898 and 1899.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Le Siècle_, April 4th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Budget Assessment of the Burghers._\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Staats Almanak_, the white population numbers 300,000,\r\nof whom 175,000 are males. The number of burghers aged between sixteen\r\nand sixty, entitled to vote, is 29,447; that of Uitlanders, between the\r\nsame ages, 81,000.\r\n\r\nThese 30,000 Boers who represent the electoral portion of the community,\r\ndo not pay one-tenth of the revenue of the state. They represent,\r\nhowever, a budget of over four millions of pounds; or, £133 per head. If\r\nour 10,800,000 electors in France had a proportionate budget at their\r\ndisposal, it would amount annually to £1,436,400,000; or considerably\r\nmore than our whole National Debt.\r\n\r\nThe burghers are thus fund-holders in receipt, per head, of a yearly\r\nincome of £133 from the Uitlanders. Never has there been an oligarchy so\r\nfavoured. It is true that all do not profit in the same proportion. \"The\r\nTransvaal Republic\" says a Dutchman, Mr. C. Hutten, \"is administered in\r\nthe interests of a clique of some three dozen families.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _The Doom of the Boer Oligarchies_. (_North American\r\nReview_, March, 1900.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_Salaries of Boer Officials._\r\n\r\nThe salaries of the Transvaal officials amounted, in 1886, to £51,831;\r\nin 1898, to £1,080,382; and in 1899, they were estimated at £1,216,394.\r\nSalaries amounting to £1,216,394 for 30,000 electors! Such are the\r\nfigures of the Transvaal Budget.\r\n\r\nHere we find undoubtedly a great superiority over other countries; and\r\nthe officials in receipt of such salaries would look down with\r\nprofoundest contempt on the much more modest pay of their European\r\ncolleagues if they knew anything about them. Each elector represents\r\nmore than £40 of official salaries. At the same rate the pay of the\r\nFrench Government officials would amount annually to about four hundred\r\nand thirty-two millions pounds sterling (£432,000,000)! This is not all.\r\nIn 1897, a member of the Volksraad asked what had become of some\r\n£2,400,000 which had been paid over to Transvaal officials, in the form\r\nof advances of salary. He received no reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_The Debit Side of the Boer Budget._\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet, by M. Edouard Naville, _La Question du Transvaal_, and\r\nalso in the _Revue Sud-Africaine_ of October 22nd, 1899, we find a list\r\nshowing the expenditure of the Pretoria Government, from which may be\r\ngathered the extraordinarily rapid rate of increase: In the fourteen\r\nyears--1886-99--the budget expenditure amounted to £37,031,000, of which\r\nnine-tenths have been defrayed by the gold industry. From information\r\nsupplied by the Government of Pretoria itself, we find that five sources\r\nhave absorbed more than half:--\r\n\r\nSalaries, &c.               £7,003,898\r\nMilitary expenditure         2,236,942\r\nSpecial expenditure          2,287,559\r\nSundry services              1,581,042\r\nPublic works                 5,809,996\r\n                           -----------\r\n                           £18,919,437\r\n                           -----------\r\nLeaving a surplus of       £18,111,601\r\n                           ===========\r\n\r\nUnder the headings of \"special,\" and \"sundry services,\" are concealed\r\nthe secret service expenditure, remuneration to influential electors,\r\nand the various political expedients by which Mr. Krüger has proved \"his\r\nintellectual and moral\" superiority.\r\n\r\nThe official salaries of 1899, estimated at £1,216,000, included a sum\r\nof £326,640 for the police. We have seen what kind of police it is.\r\n\r\nThe legislature is composed of two Volksraads, each consisting of\r\ntwenty-nine members; or fifty-eight in all. Now the estimate of salaries\r\nfor the legislature is £43,960, or about £758 each, more than double the\r\nallowances of the French senators and deputies.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat imprudent of Dr. Kuyper to refer to the educational\r\nexpenditure. The expenditure amount allocated for the education of the\r\nchildren of Uitlanders in 1896, was £650, or at the rate 1s. 10d. per\r\nhead, while the gross estimate for education in the budget for that year\r\namounted to £63,000, which works thus out at a cost of £8 6s. 1d. per\r\nhead for the Boer children. Dr. Mansveldt, Head of the Education\r\nDepartment of the Transvaal, a Hollander, seems to have but one aim: to\r\nenforce the use of the _taal_, the Boer patois--a language spoken by no\r\none else--the use of which keeps them in isolated ignorance. The English\r\nlanguage is banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_New Taxes._\r\n\r\nThis revenue, employed almost exclusively for the benefit of the Boers,\r\ndid not suffice for the insatiable government in Pretoria. At a meeting\r\nof the Chamber of Mines, on November 21st, 1898, Mr. Rouliot summarized\r\na statement by Mr. Krüger in the Raad, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"But recently, Mr. Krüger had said he would give the mines the\r\n     chance of establishing themselves before a percentage should be\r\n     imposed upon their returns; and that no tax would be levied till\r\n     the diggings had been completed, and the machinery set up. It\r\n     appeared to him, however, that the government intended to\r\n     appropriate some of their profits, although it had given no\r\n     facilities for the preparatory works on the mines, during which it\r\n     should be remembered that their capital had been burdened by\r\n     exceptionally heavy indirect taxation. The moment that capital\r\n     began to be productive, it was to be taxed.\" (_Blue Book_, No.\r\n     9345, p. 48.)\r\n\r\nIn four-and-twenty hours, Mr. Krüger had unexpectedly managed to pass a\r\nlaw levying a new tax of 2-1/2 per cent. of the gross production from\r\nmynpachts (mining leases), and 5 per cent. from the gross production of\r\nother mines. In his report of January 26th, 1899, Mr. Rouliot says: \"Had\r\nthis new tax formed part of a general scheme for the readjustment of\r\ntaxation, it might have been defended, but those who are considered best\r\nqualified to express the views of the government, content themselves by\r\nsaying that it has the right to take a share of the profits realised by\r\nthe mines and add that this tax is only a beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--_Attempt to Raise a Loan._\r\n\r\nNot content with increasing taxation, the government now wished to raise\r\na loan. The attempt failed. The Government of Pretoria blamed the mining\r\ncompanies for the failure. Mr. Rouliot said, on January 26th: \"It is\r\ntrue that the companies did not actually support the government in its\r\nefforts;\" but he added:--\r\n\r\n     \"Neither the Chamber of Mines, nor, to my knowledge, anyone\r\n     directly, or indirectly, connected with mining interests did\r\n     anything to embarass the government in its financial negotiations.\r\n     It is useless to abstain from plain speaking; on the contrary, I\r\n     hold it to be my duty to be frank and to state to the government\r\n     that if it failed in its negotiations, it is due to its bad\r\n     financial policy; to its want of an efficient system of audit; to\r\n     its costly and terribly wasteful administration; to the want of\r\n     precise information as to the object of the loan, and the manner in\r\n     which it was to be expended.\"\r\n\r\nIn fine, Law I. of 1897, and the fantastic method of legislation adopted\r\nby the Volksraad, show that the Government of Pretoria offers no better\r\nguarantee to people dealing with it than did the Grand Turk, some fifty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.--_Fleecing the Uitlanders!_\r\n\r\nTaxation, to the Boer, means getting all he can out of the Uitlander,\r\nthe old characteristic of all oligarchies. The Boer may cheerfully\r\naugment both the taxes and his expenditure. It is not he who will\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nI admire the Frenchmen, Belgians, Swiss, &c., who pretend that the\r\nUitlanders are a bad lot for not being delighted with such a\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES IN THE TRANSVAAL AND THE NETHERLANDS RAILWAY COMPANY.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Article XIV. and the Monopolies._\r\n\r\nThe avowed taxes are far from representing the whole of the burden laid\r\nupon the Uitlanders by the Government of Pretoria.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of 1881 guaranteed freedom of commerce; nevertheless,\r\nfrom 1882 onwards \"the triumvirate who ruled the country,\" says Mr.\r\nFitzPatrick (_The Transvaal from Within_), \"granted numbers of\r\nconcessions, ostensibly for the purpose of opening up industries. The\r\nreal reasons are generally considered to have been personal.\" In 1884,\r\nArticle XIV. renewed the guarantee of freedom of commerce; the Volksraad\r\nitself one day passed a resolution condemning monopolies in principle:\r\nand in December 1895 the President granted a monopoly for the\r\nimportation of products, under the guise of a government agency with a\r\ncommission to the agent!\r\n\r\nOne of the first monopolies established was for the manufacture of\r\nspirits. The quality of liquor it supplies to the natives is atrocious.\r\nTo drunkenness is attributed a loss of 15 per cent. on the labour of\r\n90,000 natives whose pay and food are equivalent to £40 per head, a loss\r\ntherefore of £550,000 a year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Le Siècle_, April 5th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Dynamite Monopoly._\r\n\r\nTwo despatches, one from Mr. Chamberlain, dated January 13th, 1899, and\r\nthe other from the Transvaal Government, dated March 9th, 1899, indicate\r\nhow Mr. Krüger always meant to interpret Article XIV. of the Convention\r\nof 1884:\r\n\r\nOn October 13th, 1893, the Transvaal Government granted a monopoly of\r\nthe dynamite trade to Mr. L.G. Vorstman for a period of 15 years. The\r\nprice of No. 1 dynamite was fixed at £4 15s. per case, of which 5s. was\r\nto be paid to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Government maintains that this monopoly does not violate\r\nthe freedom of labour, as it was established in the interest of the\r\nState, not in that of the concessionaires, and that the manufacture of\r\ndynamite is forbidden to the Boers as much as it is to foreigners.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain in his despatch denies that the dynamite monopoly has\r\nbeen established in the interest of the State; and points out that even\r\naccording to General Joubert, Vice-President of the Republic, this is\r\nreally not a State monopoly but the monopoly of one, Lippert, because it\r\nis he who has derived the greatest profits from it.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly company has always failed to fulfil its engagements; the\r\ninstallation was to be completed in two-and-a-half years: in October,\r\n1896, the company was only able to produce 80,000 cases, the\r\nconsumption at that time amounting to 200,000. The commission of the\r\nVolksraad estimated that between 1897 and 1899 it would be necessary to\r\nimport 430,000 cases in addition to the quantity produced by the\r\ncompany. It is more to the company's interest to import than to\r\nmanufacture, since importation affords a profit of £2 per case, and to\r\nthe State a duty of 5s. Were dynamite imported by the State itself, the\r\nlatter would realise about £860,000 instead of, as at present, £107,500,\r\nmaking a difference of at least about £752,500.\r\n\r\nThe price at which dynamite is sold is from 40s. to 45s. above its real\r\nvalue, from which excessive charge only certain individuals, living for\r\nthe greater part in Europe, derive the benefit. This fact is attested,\r\nnot by the English, but by Mr. Philipp, State Director of the\r\nManufacture of Explosives. The Commission demanded that all dynamite\r\nshould be manufactured by the State, and imposed a duty of 20s. per case\r\non all imported dynamite.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were passed by the Volksraad Commission in 1897; the\r\nmonopoly has continued to exist, and in 1899 it was proposed to prolong\r\nit for a period of fifteen years. On May 1st, 1898, it is true, the\r\nprice was reduced by 10s.; the company giving up 5s., and the State\r\nrenouncing the whole of the 5s. duty. It had therefore no interest in\r\nmaintaining the monopoly; 2s. of the net profits were still payable to\r\nit, it is true; but there are no public accounts.\r\n\r\nBy way of compensation new taxes were imposed by the Government. Mr.\r\nRouliot, President of the Chamber of Mines, in his speech, January\r\n26th, 1899, put it thus:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a burden borne by us on another shoulder, not a lightening of the\r\nburden.\"\r\n\r\nAllowing for the increased consumption of dynamite, it has been\r\nestimated that, even with a further reduction of 5s. per case, the\r\nannual burden imposed upon the industry by the monopoly would, at the\r\nend of the period, amount to from £687,500 to £825,000. The Transvaal\r\nGovernment in its reply of March 9th, 1899, did not dispute these\r\nfigures, but stated simply that, \"the government had the right to judge\r\nwhat was most advantageous to itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the British Government on behalf of the mining\r\nindustry of the Transvaal, were founded solely upon the statement of the\r\nVolksraad Commission itself. This mania of the Government for a monopoly\r\nby which the shareholders profit greatly and the State hardly at all,\r\nproves that there are other interests at stake than those of the public.\r\n\r\nAt its meeting on February 3rd, 1899, the Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines\r\ndecided to guarantee a Government loan of £600,000 at 5 per cent., to be\r\napplied in buying-out the concessionaires of the dynamite monopoly.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_Railways._\r\n\r\nA concession for all the State railways was granted on April 16th, 1884,\r\nto a group of Hollander and German capitalists, and confirmed by the\r\nVolksraad on August 23rd following. In 1887 the shares, to the number\r\nof 2,000, representing a capital of £166,666, were held as follows:--\r\n\r\nBy Germans            819 shares carrying 30 votes.\r\n\"  Hollanders         581   \"       \"     76   \"\r\n\"  The Republic       600   \"       \"      6   \"\r\n\r\nThis astonishing division of votes which gave to the Transvaal\r\nGovernment 6 out of 112, although it subscribed one-third of the\r\ncapital, and assured to the Hollanders twice as many votes as the other\r\nholders put together, although they only provided one-third of the\r\ncapital, was the work of Dr. Leyds. The contract for the construction of\r\nthe first 70 miles is not less surprising. Messrs. Van Hattum & Co. were\r\nto build the line, at a cost mutually to be agreed upon by them and the\r\nrailway company; and they were to receive as remuneration 11 per cent.\r\nupon the amount of the specification. The 11 per cent. was to be\r\nproportionately decreased by a sliding scale so arranged that it\r\ndisappeared by the time Van Hattum & Co. had exceeded the contract price\r\nby 100 per cent. Beyond that the company had the right to cancel the\r\ncontract. From this it follows, that, by deciding to lose the 11 per\r\ncent., Messrs. Van Hattum could make a gain of 89 per cent. This they\r\ndid, and whole sections of earthworks, which should not have cost £8,000\r\nper mile, cost £23,000 instead. A thousand Hollanders were brought out\r\nto work on the line; and sent home again at the expense of the\r\nGovernment. In a country which abounded in stone, the Komati Bridge was\r\nbuilt of dressed stone imported from Holland, with the cost of a transit\r\nof 7,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_The Drift Question._\r\n\r\nThe Cape Colony Free State Railway ends at the Vaal River, 50 miles from\r\nJohannesburg. Thence goods are transmitted by the Netherlands Railway at\r\na charge of 8-1/2d. per ton per mile, the rate being 3d. over the rest\r\nof the line.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape this rate manufacturers resorted to the use of\r\nox-wagons; Mr. Krüger forbade them the drifts in order to compel the\r\ntransit of goods by railway. This was another flagrant violation of\r\nArticle 14 of the Convention of 1884, which called forth the\r\nintervention of Mr. Chamberlain. The indignation at the Cape was so\r\ngreat, that Mr. Chamberlain having asked the Cape Government, whether,\r\nin the event of war resulting, it would pay half the cost, and undertake\r\nthe transport of the troops by the railways, the proposal was accepted\r\nby an Afrikander minister! Mr. Krüger yielded and re-opened the drifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_Methods of Exaction._\r\n\r\nA reduction of £100,000 was made on the railway tariffs; but in July,\r\n1897, the duties on corn and food-stuffs were increased by £200,000. At\r\nthe end of 1898, a certain number of these were lessened, but not that\r\non flour. A comparison of the list of duties between 1897 and the end of\r\n1898 shows that they were increased on twenty-eight products, and\r\ndecreased on four.\r\n\r\nCoal travelling a distance of 25-1/2 miles, the charge made by the\r\nNetherlands Railway Co. is 4s. 5d., which is 8-1/2d. per ton per mile;\r\nwhile the Free State Railway only charges 5-3/4d. and the Natal line\r\n3d.\r\n\r\nThe Company collects the customs dues for account of the State, as\r\nsecurity for the payment of interest on their shares and debentures.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper is quite willing to admit that the \"financial administration\r\nleaves something to be desired,\" but he adds that, \"while at the Cape\r\nthe taxes on produce are at the rate of 15 per cent., in the Transvaal\r\nthey are only 10 per cent.\" But it is easy to see how, by means of\r\nrailway tariffs and various combinations, due to the cunning of Mr.\r\nKrüger and his Hollander friends, it has been possible to enhance prices\r\nof every description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\"CAPITALIST INTRIGUES\" AND THE WAR.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_A War of Capitalists._\r\n\r\n\"It is a war of capitalists against a set of poor Boers who have no sort\r\nof interest in the dispute!\" Such is the general cry.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the facts.\r\n\r\nThe other day, anent the attempt upon the Prince of Wales, I referred to\r\nthe anarchist and socialistic attacks of certain Pro-Boer and Anglophobe\r\njournals on capitalists, financiers, and the wealthy \"metal-hearted\r\nmine-owners,\" as Dr. Kuyper calls them. I reminded my readers that\r\nProfessor Bryce himself treats as absurd the tale that the aim of the\r\nJameson Raid, as stated by those papers, was the conquest of the\r\nTransvaal for Rhodesia. I shall now show by documentary evidence that\r\nthe war did not break out through any action on the part of gold-mine\r\nproprietors. In the first place, the greater number of these proprietors\r\nreside in Europe; and as much in France, Germany and Belgium, as in\r\nEngland. Their representatives in the Transvaal may hold more or less\r\nimportant interests in those mines, but they are imbued with a full\r\nsense of their responsibilities.\r\n\r\nNow, commercial men never seek to bring about a political crisis\r\nunnecessarily; they invariably endeavour to avoid one. If they resign\r\nthemselves to such a course, it is only as a last resource.\r\n\r\nThe truth of these general assertions is verified in the case in point\r\nby two documents which have not been fabricated after the events.\r\n\r\nThey are the reports of the Chamber of Mines, published by Mr. Rouliot,\r\nin January 1898, and January 1899.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Le Siècle_, April 7th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Published in the _Revue Sud-Africaine_ (Paris).]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_A Local Board._\r\n\r\nThe report made by Mr. Rouliot to the Chamber of Mines on January 20th,\r\n1898, refers to the burdens imposed upon the gold industry by the faulty\r\nadministration of the Transvaal. It shows how the Volksraad\r\ncontemptuously rejected, in 1897, a petition signed by more than ten\r\nthousand inhabitants of all nationalities and all professions. It\r\ndeclares that \"the Chamber of Mines has no desire to interfere in the\r\nconduct of general affairs in the Transvaal\"; it recalls the fact that\r\nthe Commission of Enquiry nominated after the Crisis of 1896, had\r\nrecommended the constitution of a \"Local Board\" which President Krüger\r\nhad contemptuously rejected; and goes on to say:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is nonsense to affirm that the creation of such a Board would\r\n     have made a government within a government, and would have\r\n     threatened the independence of the State. At the time that we made\r\n     the proposal, we sincerely trusted that what had happened might be\r\n     buried in oblivion and that we might dwell together in amity. We\r\n     had hoped that the burghers would have recognised that want of\r\n     experience, and their education would have made them unfitted for\r\n     dealing with the most difficult problems that could face a young\r\n     nation, and that they would have seen the necessity of calling men\r\n     to their aid who could give them the benefit of their experience,\r\n     and help them to ensure sound conditions for the State and its\r\n     industrial development. Unfortunately, we have been deceived in our\r\n     hopes....\"\r\n\r\nThat is all; save that Mr. Rouliot alludes cursorily to the fact that\r\nthe government had endeavoured to found a Chamber of Mines in opposition\r\nto the old one, but that an amalgamation had taken place; he,\r\nconsequently, was speaking in the name of the entire industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_A Deliberative Council._\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year 1898, Mr. Krüger's policy became more and more\r\nprovocative. The Chamber of Mines confined itself to the request for the\r\nappointment of a deliberative council, to be composed of members\r\nnominated by the government, the powers of which should be limited to\r\nthe application of the laws concerning gold-theft, the sale of\r\nspirituous liquors, and the \"pass-law\" concerning native labourers.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Volksraad, June, 1898, the sub-committee appointed\r\nto enquire into this modest request, decided to recommend its rejection.\r\nMr. A.D. Wolmarans said that \"the council would be the means of placing\r\nover the heads of the agents of the State, a commission whose members\r\nwere not in possession of the franchise; and that the Volksraad would\r\npractically be adopting the proposition of home rule, and autonomy, put\r\nforward by Mr. Chamberlain in 1896.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 12th, the question was revived. A member of the Volksraad,\r\nnamed Lombaard, said that: \"Johannesburg would never be satisfied until\r\nit had a little government of its own\"; and that, as for the sale of\r\nliquor, as far as he was concerned, he saw no reason why Kaffirs should\r\nnot drink themselves to death, if such was their taste.\r\n\r\nThe request was rejected by 14 votes to six. Four-and-twenty hours later\r\nthe government passed a measure for an additional tax upon mining\r\nprofits; then the Lombaard and Edgar cases occurred. The Chamber of\r\nMines remained calm, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_Timidity of the Chamber of Mines._\r\n\r\nIn his report of January 26th, 1899, Mr. Rouliot seems to have but one\r\naim, and that is to dissociate the Chamber of Mines completely from the\r\nagitation excited among the English workmen by the murder of their\r\ncomrade, Edgar, at the hands of policeman Jones. I quote his words:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Chamber of Mines has never taken part in any political\r\n     agitation, nor has it encouraged or organised demonstrations of a\r\n     political nature. We take our stand solely upon an economic basis,\r\n     endeavouring by constitutional means the alleviation of our\r\n     burdens, and offering our advice upon questions that affect the\r\n     State, equally with an industry, our thorough knowledge of which is\r\n     undeniable. We ask neither for concessions, nor for monopoly. All\r\n     that we ask is fair treatment for our business and our\r\n     shareholders. I may here express my disappointment at seeing that\r\n     all our efforts to bring about good feeling and union between\r\n     ourselves and the executive, meet with nothing but contempt on the\r\n     part of the latter.\"\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to allude to Hollander officials; and possibly, to\r\ncertain members of the diplomatic body:--\r\n\r\n     \"Those act in bad faith who unceasingly encourage the executive of\r\n     this country in their retrograde policy, and constantly tell them\r\n     that all they do is well done.\"\r\n\r\nHe concludes by pointing out the manner in which the Press and political\r\nagents of the Government of Pretoria are stirring up ill-feeling against\r\nthe proprietors and managers of mines. Persons without any defined\r\nprofession, attracted by the vision of gold, have flocked to\r\nJohannesburg; unable to find employment, they have become a discontented\r\nproletariat. These are the true adventurers, if the word be taken in its\r\nworst sense. Mr. Krüger and his agents choose them as colleagues and pit\r\nthem against the \"wealthy metal-hearted mine owners.\" This is the policy\r\npursued by Dr. Leyds in Europe, where he has been clever enough to\r\nexcite alike the capitalist and socialist Press against the hated mine\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nMr. Rouliot continues, that it is not within the province of the Chamber\r\nof Mines to provide work for incompetent workmen. It was, no doubt,\r\nfrom among these men that Mr. Krüger had raised the signatures of the\r\ncounter-petition which so \"emphatically\" declared the administration of\r\nthe South African Republic \"to be all that could be desired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_The Petition and the Despatch of May 10th._\r\n\r\nThey were _bonâ fide_ workmen who took the initiative in the petition of\r\nMarch 28th, 1899, called forth by the murder of their fellow-workman,\r\nEdgar. We see, from Mr. Rouliot's report, that the Chamber of Mines\r\nregarding the petition as compromising, disassociated itself from it.\r\nNor was that all. The President of the South African League in the\r\nTransvaal, Mr. W. John Wybergh, a consulting engineer by profession, was\r\ndismissed by one of the principal companies.\r\n\r\nThese undeniable facts prove that \"capitalist intrigues,\" as Dr. Kuyper\r\ncalls them, were not the causes of the present war.\r\n\r\nThe British Government could not disregard a petition which 21,684\r\nBritish subjects addressed to it; even had its responsibility not been\r\npledged by Articles 7 and 14 of the Convention of 1884, relying upon\r\nwhich those British subjects had settled in the Transvaal. Every\r\ncivilised Government concerns itself with injuries done to its citizens\r\nin foreign lands. The petition of March 28th, was acknowledged by Mr.\r\nChamberlain in a despatch to Sir A. Milner of May 10th, 1899, in which\r\nhe says that \"the complaints of the Uitlanders rested on a solid basis.\"\r\nFrom the moment that the British Government \"put its hand to the\r\nplough,\" and that Lord Salisbury declared it would not draw back, the\r\nend was easy to foresee. Mr. Krüger had recourse to his habitual\r\nexpedients. I said at the time what must certainly be the result; and an\r\neminent French statesman may remember a conversation I then had with\r\nhim, in the course of which he declared that the English would never,\r\nnever, make up their minds to go to war. That was the dangerous idea\r\nthen spread throughout European diplomacy, and which must have been\r\ntransmitted to Krüger by Dr. Leyds, and some of the representatives of\r\nEuropean Governments then in Pretoria. Thus Krüger thought he need not\r\ntrouble. Hence his attitude at Bloemfontein. It was not because England\r\nwas desirous of war that it broke out, it was because she bore the\r\nreputation of being too pacific, and because she had given too many\r\nproofs of forbearance to the Boers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCHISE.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Impossible Comparisons._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper favors us with a long dissertation upon the various laws of\r\nnaturalisation existing throughout the world. But he cannot compare a\r\ncountry such as Belgium with 226 inhabitants per square kilomètre, or as\r\nFrance with 72 per square kilomètre, with a country that has two\r\ninhabitants to the square kilomètre. Had he been logical, he would have\r\nsaid that the 9,712,000 square kilomètres of the United States should\r\nalways have been exclusively peopled by the 600,000 or 700,000 Sioux\r\nIroquois and Apaches who used to dispute them.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper will reply that they were Redskins and so do not count. Be it\r\nso! Though the theory of inferior races has very grave consequences from\r\nthe standpoint taken up by him.\r\n\r\nBut, to be logical, he ought to regret that the Puritans of\r\nMassachusetts opened wide the doors of the frontiers of their young\r\nRepublic to English, Irish, and German immigrants, and, having given\r\nthem equal rights with themselves, fused and made them into citizens of\r\nthe United States. My present object however is not to discuss theories,\r\nbut to state facts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Le Siècle_, April 9th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Policy of Reaction._\r\n\r\nIn the Conference which resulted in the Convention of 1881, Messrs.\r\nKrüger and Jorissen stated to the English Commissioners that the\r\nFranchise would be extended to whites after one year's residence. (V.\r\nchap IV. § 3.) This period had been fixed in 1874. In 1882 it\r\nwas altered to five years' residence.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Boers felt it expedient to offer a satisfaction of some\r\nkind, and, in accordance with their usual methods, conceived in 1890 the\r\ndevice of creating a Second Volksraad, deprived of all executive power,\r\nto which naturalised aliens were eligible.\r\n\r\nBut more especially, after the deep levels began to be worked in 1892,\r\nwhen vast outlays of capital were required, and a long duration to gold\r\nmining undertakings was ensured, the Uitlanders began to feel that they\r\nmust no longer be regarded as suspicious aliens, liable to be expelled\r\nfrom the country at any moment. In 1892, they accordingly formed an\r\nAssociation, _The National Union_, \"for the purpose of obtaining by all\r\nConstitutional means, equal rights for all the citizens of the Republic\r\nand the redress of grievances.\" Far from desiring to place the Republic\r\nunder control of the British Government, they affirmed the maintenance\r\nof its Independence.\r\n\r\nIn his manifesto, Mr. Leonard, Chairman of the Union, demands: (1) The\r\nestablishment of the Republic as a true Republic; (2) A Constitution\r\nwhich should be drawn up by competent men, to be elected by the whole\r\npopulation, and which should be a guarantee against all hasty\r\nmodifications; (3) An equitable system of franchise, and honest\r\nrepresentation; the equality of Dutch and English languages.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Pretoria had done everything that was possible to\r\nprovoke and justify these demands.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, ignoring the three months' delay between the promulgation and\r\nenforcing of a law required by the Constitution, it was enacted that\r\nchildren born in the Transvaal of alien parents should not be recognised\r\nas citizens, unless their fathers had taken the oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\nOne Uitlander wrote: \"Thirteen years ago I entered my name on the Field\r\nCornet's book, in the belief that I should receive the franchise at\r\nexpiration of four years. For nine years I have been deprived of my\r\nrights; and I may have to wait twenty years in this country without\r\nbecoming a citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boer government, instead of becoming more and more liberal in\r\nproportion to the wealth and power with which its alien residents have\r\nendowed it, has grown more and more reactionary; and this state of\r\nreaction has been marked by a series of broken pledges.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to give an account of the varying phases of the Franchise\r\nQuestion, since the beginning of the Conference at Bloemfontein.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_The Bloemfontein Conference._\r\n\r\nThe Conference at Bloemfontein opened on the 31st of May and closed on\r\nthe 5th of June, 1889. Mr. Chamberlain's Despatch, of the 10th of May,\r\nto Sir Alfred Milner, suggests that he should adopt \"a spirit of\r\nconciliation in order to arrive at an acceptable arrangement which\r\nmight be presented to the Uitlander population, as a reasonable\r\nconcession to their just demands.\"\r\n\r\nThe position assumed by the English Government was a very simple one; it\r\nhad declined to interfere to a large degree, and it desired to interfere\r\nstill less, in the disputes between the Uitlanders and Boers. It was of\r\nopinion that the only way of putting an end to them was the granting of\r\nthe franchise, so as to enable them to attend to their own interests.\r\nThe English Government, far from desiring to increase its intervention\r\nin the actions of the Transvaal Government, desired to say to the\r\nUitlanders: \"You have your electoral rights; make use of them in your\r\nown defence.\"\r\n\r\nAs was easy to foresee, President Krüger, in accordance with his custom\r\nbegan on a number of side issues, instead of going straight to the\r\npoint, thus employing the method, known to most of us who have had\r\ndealings with mistrustful and ignorant peasants. He raised among others\r\nthe following questions: (1) Swaziland, which he wanted to annex; (2)\r\nThe mobilisation of the army; (3) The payment of the Jameson Raid\r\nindemnity (of which we will speak later); (4) The Uitlanders' petition;\r\n(5) The Gold law; (6) The Mining law; (7) The Liquor law; (8) The Tariff\r\nlaw; (9) The Independence of the Republic; (10) The Dynamite Monopoly;\r\n(11) Arbitration on all disputed points; (12) British intervention in\r\nthe internal policy of the South African Republic. And then, added Mr.\r\nKrüger ingeniously, when all these matters have been disposed of, we can\r\ntake up the question of Franchise.\r\n\r\nAt the very first sitting Sir Alfred Milner declined to enter upon\r\nthose subjects; at the second sitting he proposed the following\r\nconditions for the Franchise; (_a_) A five years' residence; (_b_)\r\nDeclaration of intention to settle in the Transvaal; (_c_) Oath to obey\r\nthe laws, and to fulfil all the obligations of citizenship, military\r\nservice included; (_d_) The Franchise to be accorded only to men of good\r\nrepute, holders of a given amount of property or of a given income;\r\n(_e_) a certain number of seats to be reserved in the Volksraad for\r\ndistricts where Uitlanders were in the majority.\r\n\r\nAfter keenly contesting these points, Mr. Krüger gave renewed proof of\r\nhis 'intellectual superiority' by advancing counter proposals bristling\r\nwith conditions such as sorcerers exact to enable them to accomplish\r\ntheir miracles. As there is always at least one impossible of\r\nrealisation, the dupe is always in the wrong; in the same manner, it was\r\nKrüger's aim to be able to say to the Uitlanders, who did not obtain the\r\nFranchise: \"It is your own fault. You have not carried out the\r\nconditions!\"\r\n\r\nOh! Mr. Krüger showed again at Bloemfontein how very clever he is, and\r\nhow worthy of Bismarck's admiration--but, Bismarck only entered upon a\r\npolicy which he could carry through.\r\n\r\nAccording to Krüger's proposal, every new-comer must within a fortnight\r\nof arrival have himself inscribed as a candidate for naturalisation and\r\nthe Franchise; the former would be granted after two years; the latter\r\nafter five more years; seven years in all. But should the first\r\nformality have been neglected within the stated time, the Uitlander was\r\nto forfeit for good and all the right of obtaining either the one or\r\nthe other! The first condition having been fulfilled, the inscribed\r\nUitlander was to prove \"his obedience to the laws\"; but President Krüger\r\ndid not signify how he was to give this negative proof.\r\n\r\nHe had, moreover, to prove that he had \"committed no act contrary to the\r\nGovernment, or its independence.\" But to vote against any candidate of\r\nKrüger's is, in the Transvaal, an act contrary to the Government. What\r\nUitlander then could ever have obtained his naturalisation? \"Two years\r\nof continuous registration,\"--but are the registers carefully kept in\r\nthe Transvaal? These formalities accomplished, and naturalisation\r\nobtained, there followed five years of registration, and the obligation\r\nof permanent residence. A stay at the Cape, a voyage to Europe, would\r\nhave sufficed to forfeit the whole benefit of the formalities observed,\r\nincluding inscription during the first fourteen days after arrival.\r\nFinally, the retrospective clause demonstrates the cunning nature of the\r\nmethods employed by Mr. Krüger.\r\n\r\nFirst it deals with a nine years' residence, _plus_ two years for\r\nnaturalisation, _plus_ six months' declaration, in all eleven\r\nyears-and-a-half, at the least.\r\n\r\nThe wording of the clause is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Residents in the South African Republic before 1890, who shall\r\n     become naturalised within six months of the promulgation of the\r\n     proposed law, after giving six months' notice of their intention to\r\n     apply for naturalisation, shall obtain the full franchise two years\r\n     after naturalisation, instead of five years. Those who have not\r\n     been naturalised within six months will have to fulfil the\r\n     conditions applying to new comers.\"\r\n\r\nLook at the trickery of this regulation. A man must apply for his\r\nnaturalisation six months beforehand, and he is bound to be naturalised\r\nwithin six months of the promulgation of the law. If he does not make\r\nhis application on the very day of the promulgation, he loses all the\r\nadvantages of his residence in the Transvaal before 1890, and he must\r\nwait another seven years. Note, that on the actual day of promulgation\r\nthe administration of the Transvaal could never, even in good faith,\r\nhave dealt with the 20,000 or 30,000 declarations that would have been\r\nmade; and Mr. Krüger calmly proceeds to adjourn to another seven years\r\nthe Uitlanders who had already put in nine years of residence, total 16\r\nyears. Yes, Mr. Krüger is very clever to have invented such a skilful\r\ncontrivance; to have had the audacity to propound it; and to hold the\r\nopinion of Europe in such contempt that he could think it possible to\r\nmake the majority of people the dupe of such schemes; and he has\r\nsucceeded!\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner replied in the courteous language of diplomacy that\r\nafter the interchange of these two propositions, Mr. Krüger and himself\r\nfound themselves on exactly the same ground as before the Conference,\r\nand that, therefore, there was no object to be gained by prolonging it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCHISE.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE CONFERENCE OF BLOEMFONTEIN.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_A Krüger Trick._\r\n\r\nThe Anglophobe Pro-Boers of course blame Mr. Chamberlain for the rupture\r\nof the Bloemfontein Conference, and extol the forbearance of Mr. Krüger,\r\nwho carried off his proposal to have it passed by the Volksraad, and\r\n\"his\" burghers.\r\n\r\nThey do not reflect, that, had he honestly desired to put the matter on\r\nthe road to settlement, Mr. Krüger should first have come to an\r\nunderstanding upon it. By passing it through the Volksraad as law, he\r\nshould have cut the cable, were he in reality, anything but an autocrat,\r\nand such ratifications anything but mere formalities.\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger had the condescension to say to England, \"So you will have\r\nnone of my proposals which compel those already in the Transvaal to an\r\neleven or twelve years' residence, coupled with impossible formalities,\r\nbefore obtaining the franchise? Very well, I will renew my offer to you\r\nin the name of the Volksraad and of \"my\" burghers, and if you are not\r\nsatisfied, leave me alone to hoodwink a large proportion of enlightened\r\nmen on the Continent into believing that I am simply the victim of Mr.\r\nChamberlain's animosity, and England's greed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Le Siècle_, April 10th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Bill passed by the Volksraad._\r\n\r\nThe bill introduced into the Volksraad on July 13th was passed on July\r\n19th, with only the addition of one amendment to Article 4, by which\r\nresidents in the Transvaal, prior to the promulgation of the law, were\r\nentitled to obtain naturalisation after seven, instead of nine years of\r\nresidence, on condition that they had complied with the requisite\r\nformalities, and had submitted to the delays before stated. People\r\nadmired Mr. Krüger's generosity. Nine or ten years, instead of eleven or\r\ntwelve, for the Uitlanders already settled in the Transvaal! What\r\nsacrifices he was making to ensure peace! What magnanimity towards\r\nUitlanders! The first paragraph of Article 4 runs thus:\r\n\r\n     \"Article 4. All persons who shall have settled in the South African\r\n     Republic prior to the commencement of this Act, and who shall be\r\n     eligible according to the conditions laid down in Article 1, may\r\n     obtain letters of naturalisation seven years after arrival in the\r\n     country.\"\r\n\r\nThis article, therefore, only accorded naturalisation to former\r\nresidents; their seven years in the country counted no more than two.\r\n\r\nSuppose them naturalised; in reality, they are deprived of all\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nThey belong no longer to the land of their birth; if wronged, or\r\nmaltreated they have no claim upon it for redress.\r\n\r\nThey are not burghers: they have no political rights; they are, in fact,\r\nminors who have lost their guardian.\r\n\r\nThis condition was to last for seven years in a country where changes\r\nare made by the week.\r\n\r\nThe art of importing confusion into the simplest matters, has been most\r\nsuccessfully practised by Mr. Krüger and Dr. Leyds. They have even\r\nsucceeded in persuading thinking men that the Uitlanders should have\r\naccepted with enthusiasm the law of July 19th, and that they should have\r\nbeen deeply grateful to Mr. Krüger who had \"reduced from nine to seven\r\nyears the term first proposed by him at Bloemfontein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_Pretended Concessions._\r\n\r\nThe changes referring to the \"redistribution\" of seats in the Volksraad\r\nwere numerous. Mr. Krüger posed as making a huge concession to mining\r\ndistricts in raising the number of seats to twelve; but six of these\r\nwere for the second Volksraad. Now the second Volksraad must always have\r\nthe same number of members as the First; thus the apparent concession\r\nwas merely a valueless automatic arrangement, for it is well understood\r\nthat the second Volksraad is simply a show institution, devised in 1890.\r\nThe various schemes for redistribution lead one to the conclusion that\r\nthe number of members in the First Volksraad were to be in inverse ratio\r\nto the population.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlander looked with mistrust upon a law voted one day which could\r\nbe modified the next by a simple resolution of the Volksraad; he\r\nconsidered it an illusion which might vanish at any moment Mr. Krüger\r\nand his friends thought proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_The Joint Commission._\r\n\r\nThe British Government might have replied that it did not recognise this\r\nlaw, and have confined itself to the proposals put forward by Sir Alfred\r\nMilner at the Bloemfontein Conference. It did not take this attitude\r\nwhich, in France, would have been advised by the most half-hearted of\r\nour Nationalists, had the French Government been engaged in similar\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nIn his despatch of July 27, Mr. Chamberlain appears to think that \"the\r\nconcessions made to the Uitlanders to guarantee them something of the\r\nequality promised them in 1881 were made in good faith; but this law of\r\nJuly 19th is full of complicated details; he therefore proposes that it\r\nshould be examined by a joint commission.\" In the Colonial Secretary's\r\ndespatch of August 2nd to Pretoria, he adds: \"It is understood that the\r\nCommission to examine into the question of the Uitlanders' Electoral\r\nrights shall be prepared to discuss every subject that the Government of\r\nthe South African Republic may desire to bring before it, including\r\narbitration, exclusive always of the intervention of Foreign Powers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_Bargaining._\r\n\r\nThe Government of Pretoria had put the law in force without waiting to\r\nconsider these remarks.\r\n\r\nOn August 15th a despatch of Sir Alfred Milner's makes mention of a\r\nproposal of the State Attorney to the British Government to waive their\r\ninvitation to a joint enquiry, in respect of the concession of a\r\nretrospective Franchise of seven years being substituted for mere\r\nnaturalisation, and of an increase in the number of seats. Such a\r\nproposition on the part of the Government of Pretoria shows plainly that\r\nit wished to evade enquiry into a law so fettered with formalities that\r\nits working was chimerical. And when Sir Alfred Milner referred to his\r\nproposal at Bloemfontein, the State Attorney decreased to five years the\r\nterm of retrospective registration, gave eight seats to the Rand, and\r\ntwo to other mining districts.\r\n\r\nUpon which Pro-Boers exclaim: The Government of Pretoria has made every\r\npossible concession!\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--_The Conditions, and Withdrawal of Proposals._\r\n\r\nThey prove by that exclamation that they had not read Sir Alfred\r\nMilner's despatches of the 22nd and 23rd of August.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Pretoria made these concessions, indeed but on\r\ncondition: (1) That the British Government shall withdraw its proposal\r\nfor a joint Commission to enquire into whether the law was workable; (2)\r\nThat the British Government shall renounce suzerainty; (3) That\r\narbitration--apart from Foreign Powers, with exception of the Orange\r\nFree State--shall be granted immediately upon the Franchise Law being\r\nsettled. On August 28th Mr. Chamberlain replies. Concerning the\r\nsuzerainty, he refers to his despatch of July 13th; he consents to\r\ndiscuss the Constitution of a Tribunal of Arbitration from which Foreign\r\nPowers, and foreign influence, shall be excluded; he concludes by\r\nproposing a fresh Conference.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reply of the Boer Government on September 2nd? The\r\nwithdrawal of its proposals of August 19th and 21st, relative to the\r\nfive years' Franchise and increase of number of seats in the Volksraad.\r\n\r\nThus, at the end of three months' negotiations, no conclusion had been\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nIt is to this despatch of September 2nd, that Mr. Chamberlain's despatch\r\nof September 8th, replies; in that despatch he states, that he is still\r\nprepared to accept the proposals of August 19th concerning the\r\nFranchise, provided that the enquiry by a Commission, joint or\r\nunilateral, prove that the law is workable.\r\n\r\nThe representation of Uitlanders in the Volksraad, is, of course, only\r\npossible on condition that they had the right to make use of the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nOn September 23rd, the Transvaal Government replies that the _taal_, a\r\nlanguage not spoken by any but Boers, is to remain the only language\r\nused in the Volksraad, and in dilatory phraseology paves the way for the\r\nultimatum of October 9th. Here we have a summary of the negotiations\r\nrelating to the franchise, from the time of the Bloemfontein Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.--_The Franchise is Self-Government._\r\n\r\nConfronted with these facts, the Pro-Boer cries: \"Ah, but Mr. Krüger was\r\nobliged to protect himself. He could not have his burghers swamped by\r\nUitlanders. He was perfectly right.\"\r\n\r\nGood. There is the theory that honest dealing is unnecessary in public\r\nnegotiations; an apology for that system which is in direct\r\ncontradiction to the maxim of private law that you cannot give and\r\nwithhold at one and the same time.\r\n\r\n\"But why should the English insist upon obtaining the franchise for\r\nUitlanders?\"\r\n\r\nIn order that there should be no more need for the British Government to\r\nconcern itself in Transvaal affairs, Sir Alfred Milner was right when he\r\nsaid to the State Attorney (despatch of August 15th):\r\n\r\n     \"I am sure that the present proposal is made _bonâ fide_ in order\r\n     to establish the rights of British subjects once for all; and the\r\n     Government of the South African Republic need not entertain any\r\n     fear that we should wish to intervene in its internal affairs in\r\n     future.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 28th, Mr. Chamberlain speaks the same language; at the same\r\ntime justly observing, that only a portion of the Englishmen residing in\r\nthe Transvaal would seek to become naturalised.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact when in February, 1896, the British Government demanded\r\nautonomy for the Rand, and on this proposition being refused, demanded\r\nat Bloemfontein the Franchise for Uitlanders, it was neither bent upon a\r\npolicy of absorption nor of conquest. They desired to place\r\nself-government in the hands of the Uitlanders, in order to be able to\r\nsay to them: \"Now manage your own affairs with the Boers, obtain respect\r\nfor your rights by constitutional measures. We are no further concerned\r\nin the matter.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the conquest of the Transvaal that was desired by the British\r\nGovernment, it was the establishment of an autonomous Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlanders of British, Australian, German and American extraction,\r\ninter-mixing with the Boers, would soon have merged their national\r\ncharacteristics, and have become simply citizens of the South African\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe Boers might have constructed a vast, wealthy and powerful State in\r\nwhich for generations to come, they would have held the supremacy. As a\r\nconquered people they will be compelled to accept the constitution they\r\nmight have granted, and granted the more readily as they would have\r\nreaped the largest share of the benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE SUZERAINTY OF ENGLAND AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Who raised the Question of Suzerainty?_\r\n\r\nNine persons out of ten, when speaking of the Transvaal question, say:\r\n\"Why did Chamberlain, at the last moment, raise the question of\r\nsuzerainty? When everything had been settled, that question ruined all.\"\r\n\r\nThe more thoughtful men base their opinion on an article in _Le Temps_\r\nof September 15th, in which occurs this hypothetical paragraph:--\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover it is possible, that, in the dim recesses of his brain,\r\n     the Colonial Minister treasures, as a supreme hope and shadowy\r\n     idea, the half-formed design of profiting by the discussion he is\r\n     raising in order to excite fresh disputes, such as the complex\r\n     question of suzerainty.\"\r\n\r\nThis insiduous and disloyal conjecture has been reproduced and utilised;\r\nthe absolutely unfounded insinuation of _Le Temps_, has been turned into\r\nan accusation against Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nSome people who fancy they can gauge the motives of statesmen better\r\nthan their neighbours, add: \"If he raised the question of suzerainty,\r\nit was because he wanted to bring about a war.\" Facts prove, however,\r\nthat the suzerainty question was not raised by England, but by the\r\nGovernment at Pretoria.\r\n\r\nThe argument against England's suzerainty over the Transvaal is well\r\nknown; the preamble to the 1881 Convention, in which the word occurs was\r\nnot reproduced in the Convention of 1884.\r\n\r\nBut it is also known, that, in the letter to Lord Derby of November\r\n14th, 1883, the delegates from the Pretoria Government demanded\r\nrestrictions of \"the right of suzerainty reserved to Her Majesty by\r\nArticles 2 and 18 of the Convention of 1881,\" and claimed, that \"the\r\nrelation of dependence _publici juris_ in which their country now finds\r\nitself placed with regard to the British Crown shall be replaced by that\r\nof two contracting parties.\" In his despatch of November 29th, Lord\r\nDerby replied, that their \"pretension to enter into treaty as between\r\ntwo contracting powers was neither in form nor substance acceptable by\r\nHer Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe Preamble of the Convention of 1884 speaks of the representations of\r\nthe delegates of the Pretoria Government, \"which Her Majesty has been\r\npleased to take into consideration.\"\r\n\r\nNot daring to efface with a stroke of his pen the suzerainty question,\r\nDr. Kuyper attempts a metaphorical distinction:--\r\n\r\n     \"The suzerainty question solves itself. Suzerainty may be an\r\n     \"organic or mechanical relation\"; if mechanical, it is arranged by\r\n     contract.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Kuyper declares England's suzerainty to be of the mechanical\r\norder, he admits that the Transvaal did not hold towards England the\r\nposition of an absolutely independent State.\r\n\r\nHaving been obliged to recognise the right of _veto_, which Article 4\r\nconfers upon England regarding the external relations of the Transvaal,\r\nhe contradicts himself when he invokes the principle of the equality \"of\r\nStates among themselves.\"\r\n\r\nTaking refuge in a kind of prescription, he says: \"Never, before 1898,\r\nhad England breathed a word regarding suzerainty throughout all her\r\ninterminable correspondence.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 6th, 1897, however, Mr. Chamberlain addressed a despatch to the\r\nSouth African Republic, in which he complains of several failures to\r\nobserve the Convention of 1884. The following facts are cited by him:\r\n(1) Conclusion of a treaty of extradition with Holland, signed at the\r\nHague, November 14th, 1895; of an act with Portugal, signed at Lisbon,\r\nNovember 3rd, 1893; of a convention with Switzerland, signed September\r\n30th, 1896--none of these treaties had been submitted to the English\r\nGovernment, in violation of Article 4 of the Convention of 1884; (2)\r\nLaws concerning the emigration of foreigners, the expulsion of\r\nforeigners, the Press, all in contravention of Article 14 of the 1884\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Boeschoten, Secretary of State to the Transvaal at that time,\r\nproposed arbitration, the arbitrator to be chosen by the President of\r\nthe Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nReplying on October 16th, 1897, Mr. Chamberlain said that in making this\r\nproposal the Pretoria Government \"appears to have misunderstood the\r\ndistinction existing between two independent powers.\"\r\n\r\nThere we see a distinct assertion of suzerainty, the question which,\r\naccording to Dr. Kuyper, was first raised in 1898.\r\n\r\n     \"By the Pretoria Convention of 1881, Her Majesty, as Sovereign of\r\n     the Transvaal, granted to the inhabitants of this territory\r\n     complete self-government subject to the suzerainty of Her Majesty;\r\n     and according to the London Convention of 1884, Her Majesty, while\r\n     maintaining the preamble to the preceding instrument declared that\r\n     certain other Articles would be substituted for Articles contained\r\n     in the Convention of 1881. The Articles of the Convention of 1881\r\n     have been accepted by the Volksraad of the Transvaal State and\r\n     those of the Convention of 1884 by the Volksraad of the South\r\n     African Republic.\r\n\r\n     \"According to these Conventions Her Majesty's position towards the\r\n     South African Republic is that of a suzerain, who has granted to\r\n     the people of this Republic self-government under certain\r\n     conditions; and it would be incompatible with this situation to\r\n     submit to arbitration the meaning of the conditions under which she\r\n     has granted self-government to the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain concluded by saying that he could not admit the\r\nintervention of any Foreign power between the English Government and\r\nthat of the South African Republic, and that, therefore, he could not\r\nsubmit the violations of the Convention of 1884 to the consideration of\r\nsuch a power.\r\n\r\nOn April 11th, 1898, the new State Secretary, Mr. Reitz, returned to the\r\nquestion in a long despatch described by Dr. Kuyper as \"crushing\"\r\n(_foudroyante_), and which proves, at least, that the Suzerainty\r\nQuestion had been raised before 1898, since it endeavours to refute Mr.\r\nChamberlain's despatches of March 6th, and October 16th, 1897.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Chamberlain replies, December 15th, 1898:--\r\n\r\n     \"The preamble to the Convention of 1881 remains the basis of the\r\n     relations between Her Majesty and the inhabitants of the South\r\n     African Republic. To these inhabitants Her Majesty guarantees\r\n     internal independence, to Herself she reserves the Suzerainty. The\r\n     concession of internal independence and the reservation of the\r\n     Suzerainty have but one common origin--the preamble to the\r\n     Convention of 1881.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Reitz succeeded Dr. Leyds as Secretary of State, and on May 9th,\r\n1899, replied to the despatch of the preceding December 15th. In\r\nforwarding this despatch Sir Alfred Milner observed that it contained a\r\npretension never before put forward by the Government of Pretoria, the\r\nfollowing words being used: \"the inherent right of a Sovereign\r\nInternational State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain replied, July 13th, 1899, summarising the Conventions of\r\n1852, 1881, and 1884; he recalled Lord Derby's declaration in the House\r\nof Lords, March 17th, 1884: \"Whatever Suzerainty meant in the Convention\r\nof Pretoria, the condition of things which it implies still remains.\r\nThough the word is not actually used, we have kept the substance.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Le Siècle_, April 11th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Suzerainty and the Conference of the Hague._\r\n\r\nHow was it that the theorists, who take up the utterance of Dr. Reitz,\r\nthat: \"the Transvaal has the inherent rights of a Sovereign\r\nInternational State,\" did not ask the Queen of the Netherlands that the\r\nSouth African Republic might be represented at the Conference of the\r\nHague? It was a grand opportunity, which they no more dreamt of seizing,\r\nthan the thought of asking that the Bey of Tunis should take part in it.\r\n\r\nThese documents referred to by us prove that the Suzerainty Question was\r\nnot raised at the last moment, as the _Temps_ of September 15th, 1899,\r\nis affirmed to have stated; that it was not raised only in 1898, as\r\nstated by Dr. Kuyper; that at least it was raised on March 6th, 1897;\r\nthat, since the last mentioned date, it has given rise to an important\r\ncorrespondence; and, finally, that it was the first subject raised by\r\nPresident Krüger at the Bloemfontein Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ARBITRATION QUESTION.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_How the Transvaal interprets Arbitration._\r\n\r\nAccording to the idea prevailing throughout Europe, President Krüger had\r\nconceded everything from the franchise point of view, when all was\r\nruined by Mr. Chamberlain raising the Suzerainty Question at the last\r\nmoment. We have seen the value of these two assertions.\r\n\r\nThen, certain members of the ultra peace party ask hotly: \"Why did he\r\nnot accept arbitration?\" The word in itself appears to them to possess\r\nsome sovereign virtue. Dr. Kuyper seems to me to be suffering from that\r\nterrible intellectual malady psittacism when he exclaims:--\r\n\r\n     \"Arbitration is the _mot d'ordre_ of modern civilisation.\"\r\n\r\nand he adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"As if arbitration were not the rule between _masters_ and\r\n     _workmen_.\"\r\n\r\nI have often demonstrated the \"illusion of such arbitration\" (among\r\nothers see _Le Siècle_, October 6th, 1899), the negative effects\r\nproduced in France by the law on optional arbitration, and in England by\r\nthe Conciliation Act of 1896.\r\n\r\nFrom an international point of view, the judgment passed by the\r\nArbitration Tribunal in the matter of the Delagoa Bay Railway, after a\r\nlapse of ten years, is not one to induce governments to have recourse to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the relations between England and the Transvaal, the Arbitration\r\nQuestion is closely connected with the Suzerainty Question. It was\r\nraised May 7th, 1897, by the State Secretary, Mr. Van Boeschoten, in\r\nreply to the complaints made in Mr. Chamberlain's despatch of March 6th,\r\n1897, relating to the violation of the 1884 Convention. Mr. Van\r\nBoeschoten's proposal was that the President of the Swiss Confederation\r\nshould be asked to appoint an arbitrator.\r\n\r\nOn October 16th, 1897, Mr. Chamberlain replied:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Government of the South African Republic proposes that the\r\n     contested points of the Convention shall be submitted to\r\n     arbitration, the arbitrator to be appointed by the President of the\r\n     Swiss Confederation. In making this proposal the Government appears\r\n     to have misunderstood the difference existing between the\r\n     Conventions of 1881 and 1884 and an ordinary treaty between two\r\n     independent powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe conventions had been made up; they did not suit the Government of\r\nthe South African Republic. Could the British Government say: \"They do\r\nnot suit you. Very well, we will ask the head of a foreign State to\r\nappoint an arbitrator by whom they will be considered and annulled in\r\nthe event of his sympathizing with you.\"\r\n\r\nIn diplomatic terms Mr. Chamberlain explains that the English Government\r\ncould not carry its condescension so far as to subject to the judgment\r\nof a foreigner the result of its policy and the negotiations of its\r\ndiplomats. On April 16th, 1898, a claim was made by Dr. Leyds for: \"A\r\ntribunal under international law for the especial purpose of deciding\r\ndifferences of opinion regarding the mode of Government, and the rights\r\nand obligations of the South African Republic towards the British\r\nGovernment.\" Again Mr. Chamberlain replied, on December 15th, 1898, that\r\nthe English Government could admit of no intervention of a Foreign power\r\nbetween the Pretoria Government and itself.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of the second day of the Bloemfontein Conference\r\nthe arbitration question with regard to Swazieland, was raised by Mr.\r\nKrüger. He returned to the subject on the third day, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the event of Swazieland becoming part of my Republic; an\r\n     agreement being arrived at with reference to the Jameson Raid\r\n     indemnity; Her Majesty's Government agreeing to interfere no more\r\n     with my internal government; and arriving at an acceptable solution\r\n     of the Franchise Question; the matter of English subjects, who,\r\n     having no need to become burghers, yet still have reason to\r\n     complain of illegal actions, might be submitted to arbitration.\"\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner replied that: \"the English Government could not allow\r\ninterference between itself and the South African Republic, of a foreign\r\npower or influence; that it might, however, be possible to consider some\r\nother way of nominating an impartial tribunal, and examining certain\r\nquestions; but that he himself was not authorised to do so.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion President Krüger said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Give me Swazieland, the indemnity for the Jameson Raid, and\r\n     arbitration, in exchange for the Franchise, otherwise, I should\r\n     have nothing. These points would make something worth having.\"\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner's reply was that President Krüger had raised the\r\nquestion of arbitration, without mentioning the manner of arbitration;\r\nthat there were some questions, with regard to which it could not be\r\nadmitted by the English Government; that there were others on which it\r\nmight be admitted; that, if proposals were put forward, he would submit\r\nthem to his Government.\r\n\r\nMr. Krüger's closing words were:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have nothing to add, I shall submit the questions concerning the\r\n     Franchise to the Volksraad as soon as I receive the reply that the\r\n     English Government accepts my proposal of arbitration.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 9th, the proposals relating to arbitration were formulated by\r\nMr. Reitz, State Secretary to the Pretoria Government. He began by\r\nproving that he could put into people's mouths words which had never\r\nbeen uttered by them. He declared that \"at the Bloemfontein Conference\r\nthe High Commissioner was personally favourable to the settlement by\r\narbitration of all the differences between the two Governments.\" Sir\r\nAlfred Milner had been careful not to go so far as this.\r\n\r\nAfter this inaccurate preamble the following proposals were made by Mr.\r\nReitz:--\r\n\r\n     (1) \"In future, all questions arising between the two Governments,\r\n     and relating to the interpretation of the London Convention to be\r\n     submitted to a tribunal of arbitration, with the exception of\r\n     questions of trifling importance.\"\r\n\r\n     (2) \"The tribunal to be composed of two arbitrators appointed\r\n     respectively by each government, as for instance the Chief Justices\r\n     of the South African Republic, Cape Colony or Natal. The power to\r\n     be given to them of choosing as a third arbitrator, someone who\r\n     should be a subject of neither of the disputing parties; the\r\n     decision in all cases to rest with the majority.\"\r\n\r\n     (3) \"The instrument of submission to be considered in each case by\r\n     the two governments, in order that both may have the right of\r\n     reserving and excluding any points appearing to them too important\r\n     to be submitted to arbitration.\"\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner remarked that this project was \"a mere skeleton\r\nproposal by which too many things were left undefined.\" For instance,\r\nwhat did the words \"trifling matters\" mean? and what was meant by the\r\nthird article, which gives to both Governments the right of excluding\r\nfrom arbitration points which may appear to them too important to be\r\nsubmitted to it?\r\n\r\nFinally, the very composition of the tribunal was in contradiction to\r\nthe reservations made by the English Government. The third arbitrator\r\nwould be a foreigner, and with this third arbitrator would rest the\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Le Siècle_, April 26th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Mr. Chamberlain's Conditions._\r\n\r\nIn his telegram of July 27th, however, Mr. Chamberlain did not reply by\r\nan absolute definite refusal. He rejected the composition of the\r\ntribunal; but he acknowledged that: \"the interpretation of the\r\nconvention in detail is not exempt from difficulties, putting aside the\r\nquestion of the interpretation of the preamble of the Convention of\r\n1881, which regulates the articles substituted in the Convention of\r\n1884.\" And then Mr. Chamberlain invited Sir Alfred Milner to enquire of\r\nMr. Krüger whether he would accept the exclusion of the Foreign element\r\nin the settlement of disputes, arising from the interpretation of the\r\nConvention of 1884:\r\n\r\n     \"As to how far and by what method, questions could be decided by a\r\n     judicial authority whose independence, impartiality and capacity\r\n     should be above suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nThus the constitution of a tribunal of arbitration was accepted by Mr.\r\nChamberlain, and in his despatch of August 28th he directed Sir Alfred\r\nMilner to arrange a fresh conference with Mr. Krüger. On September 2nd\r\nthe Pretoria Government asks whether the British Government will receive\r\nburghers of the Free State as members of the arbitration tribunal? which\r\nare the subjects it will be competent to settle? and which will be\r\nreserved?\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner's views on this subject are stated in a lengthy\r\ndespatch to the Government, dated September 8th. The points which Sir\r\nAlfred Milner considered should be excluded from arbitration as being\r\nlikely to re-open discussion are the following: (1) The position of the\r\nBritish Indians; (2) the position of other British coloured subjects;\r\n(3) the right of all British subjects to be treated as favourably as\r\nthose of any other country; \"a right which has never been formally\r\nadmitted by the South African Republic.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Arbitration Question may be said to have dropped, Sir A.\r\nMilner's telegram of September 8th being followed by the ultimatum of\r\nOctober 9th.\r\n\r\nHence this question was not a new one at the time of the Bloemfontein\r\nConference. It had been raised by the Government of Pretoria as a means\r\nby which its \"inherent rights as a Sovereign State\" should be\r\nacknowledged, a pretension which could not be admitted by the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, however, arbitration was not absolutely refused by Mr.\r\nChamberlain; he imposed two conditions; the Conventions of 1881 and 1884\r\nwere not to be questioned, foreigners were not to be chosen as\r\narbitrators; the points referred to arbitration should be clearly\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast difference between this attitude and the arrogant tone\r\ngenerally ascribed to Mr. Chamberlain. It is always advisable to refer\r\nto the documents on a question before discussing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE BOER ULTIMATUM.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Dr. Kuyper's Logic._\r\n\r\nReferring to the Bloemfontein Conference, Dr. Kuyper says:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Chamberlain opened his criminal negotiations ... Unfortunately\r\n     for him, his opponent, of whom Bismarck said there was not a\r\n     statesman in Europe who surpassed him for sagacity and sound\r\n     judgment, did not fall into the trap. He prolonged the negotiations\r\n     ... but from the moment he held in his hands undeniable proofs of\r\n     the manner in which Mr. Chamberlain was luring him on and seeking\r\n     to gain time, he hurled at him the reproach of \"coveting Naboth's\r\n     vineyard,\" and sent an ultimatum to London.\" (p. 502).\r\n\r\nWe are struck in this passage by the admirable logic of Dr. Kuyper. It\r\nis Krüger who \"prolongs the negotiations,\" and Chamberlain who \"seeks to\r\ngain time.\" To heighten the prestige of Mr. Krüger, Dr. Kuyper invokes\r\nthe testimony of Bismarck. I certainly think that it was Krüger's\r\nambition to become the Bismarck of South Africa, and President of the\r\n\"Africa for the Afrikanders, from the Zambesi to Simon's Bay.\"\r\n\r\nI come to the final act:--\r\n\r\nOn September 2nd, the Government of Pretoria withdrew its proposal to\r\nreduce the delay in granting the franchise to five years; the British\r\nGovernment not having accepted the conditions imposed: (1) Refusal of\r\nall enquiry into the condition of the Franchise Law by a Joint\r\nCommission; (2) Abrogation of Suzerainty in conformity with the note of\r\nthe Government of Pretoria, of April 16th, 1898; (3) Refusal to submit\r\nquestions under discussion to Arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Le Siècle_, April 13th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_Despatches of the 8th and 22nd September._\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain replied in his despatch of September 8th. He was unable\r\nto accept the terms of the Note of April 16th, 1898, which he had\r\nformally refused.\r\n\r\nHe maintained that the Franchise Law was insufficient to guarantee an\r\nimmediate and effective representation of the Uitlanders.\r\n\r\nHe demanded that a joint, or unilateral, Commission should be instituted\r\nto examine whether the law on the Franchise were not rendered\r\ninoperative by the conditions which would make such representations\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n     The acceptance of these propositions by the South African Republic\r\n     would put an end to the tension existing between the two\r\n     Governments, and, in all probability, would render ulterior\r\n     intervention on the part of Her Majesty's Government to ensure\r\n     redress of the Uitlanders' grievances unnecessary, as they\r\n     themselves would thenceforth be entitled to bring them directly to\r\n     the cognizance of the Executive and the Raad.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain adds that the British Government is prepared to\r\nauthorise a fresh Conference between the President of the South African\r\nRepublic and the High Commissioner in order to settle all details of a\r\nTribunal of Arbitration, and the questions capable of being submitted to\r\nit on the basis of the Note of August 30th.\r\n\r\nThis very moderately worded despatch, embodying equally moderate\r\npropositions, ended as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Should, however--which Her Majesty's Government earnestly trusts\r\n     may not be the case--the reply of the South African Government be\r\n     negative, or dilatory, it reserves to itself the right to consider\r\n     the situation _de novo_, and to formulate its own propositions for\r\n     a final settlement.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government of Pretoria replied on September 16th, by referring to\r\nits Note of September 2nd. It devotes an entire paragraph to the\r\nstatement that the English language will not be admitted in the\r\nVolksraad. It refuses to consider at that juncture the appointment of a\r\nfresh Conference; it accepts, however, the proposed Joint Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain replies in his despatch of September 22nd, in which he\r\nclearly states the attitude of the British Government. It has no desire\r\nto interfere in any way with the independence of the South African\r\nRepublic. It has not asserted any other rights of interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of the South African Republic than those derived from\r\nthe Conventions, or \"which belong to every neighbouring Government for\r\nthe protection of its subjects and of its adjoining possessions. But, by\r\nthe action of the Government of the South African Republic, who have in\r\ntheir Note of May 9th, asserted the right of the Republic to be a\r\nSovereign International State, it has been compelled to repudiate any\r\nsuch claim.\" He repeats that the Franchise would enable the Uitlanders\r\nto procure just treatment for themselves, and concludes by saying: \"the\r\nrefusal of the South African Republic to entertain the offer thus made\r\ncoming, as it does, at the end of nearly four months of negotiations,\r\nand of five years of agitation, makes it useless to further pursue a\r\ndiscussion on the lines hitherto followed, and Her Majesty's Government\r\nare now compelled to consider the situation afresh and to formulate\r\ntheir own proposals for a final settlement.\"\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Government has accused Sir Alfred Milner of not keeping\r\nhis word. Two despatches, one from Mr. Chamberlain, September 16th, the\r\nother from Sir Alfred Milner, September 20th, refute this allegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_The Ultimatum._\r\n\r\nThese two despatches received no reply. On September 28th, the Volksraad\r\nof the Orange Free State proclaimed that it would \"faithfully and\r\nhonorably fulfil its obligations towards the South African Republic, in\r\naccordance with the alliance between the two States, whatever might be\r\nthe consequences.\" Mr. Steyn, the President, gave an account of the\r\nnegotiations from his point of view. The Cape presented a petition drawn\r\nup by fifty-eight members of the Cape Parliament, five of whom were\r\nMinisters and had adopted Mr. Steyn's view; on the other side,\r\nfifty-three members of both Chambers passed a resolution approving the\r\npolicy of the British Government. President Steyn complained of troops\r\nbeing sent to Africa. Later events have proved whether these complaints\r\nwere justifiable. On September 29th, the Netherlands Railway stated that\r\ncommunication with Natal was interrupted. The telegraph wires were cut.\r\nOn October 2nd, President Krüger, in adjourning the Volksraad _sine\r\ndie_, stated that \"War is inevitable,\" and on October 9th, the\r\nGovernment of the South African Republic handed an Ultimatum to the\r\nBritish Agent at Pretoria.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimatum demanded Arbitration on all subjects; the withdrawal of\r\nBritish troops; the re-embarkation of British troops landed after June\r\n1st; troops on the high seas not be landed.\r\n\r\n     \"The Transvaal Government requires an immediate and affirmative\r\n     reply on these four points, before five o'clock, p.m. on Wednesday,\r\n     October 11th, and it is added that should a satisfactory reply not\r\n     have reached within that period, it will, to its great regret, be\r\n     compelled to consider the action of Her Majesty's Government as a\r\n     formal declaration of War.\"\r\n\r\nNext day Mr. Chamberlain naturally replied that \"henceforth all\r\ndiscussion was impossible.\" Notification was made on the 11th of\r\nOctober. Englishmen and suspected foreigners were expelled; and\r\nPresident Steyn, with the special Boer skill, in misrepresenting facts,\r\nannounced that \"England had committed itself to an open, and\r\nunjustifiable attack upon the independence of the South African\r\nRepublic.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen from which side the attack came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nDR. KUYPER'S FINAL METAPHOR.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Where are the Peace Lovers?_\r\n\r\nI have finished my criticism of Dr. Kuyper's article.\r\n\r\nShould he not find it clear, perhaps he will be kind enough to mark the\r\npoints which he desires to have explained. I will gladly insert his\r\nreply, on condition that he allows me to publish it, with his article,\r\nin pamphlet form, so that readers may have both sides of the question\r\nbefore them. I do not follow him in detail in his apologetic, religious,\r\nmetaphysical, and oratorical digressions where common-places stand for\r\nfacts and arguments.\r\n\r\n\"Has civilisation the right to propagate itself by means of war?\" he\r\ncries. As far as I am concerned, I think war a very bad vehicle of\r\ncivilisation, albeit it has often served the purpose; but as long as it\r\nremains the last resource of international relations, it is impossible\r\nto suppress it.\r\n\r\nI return the question. \"Has an inferior civilisation the right to impose\r\nitself upon a superior civilisation, and to propagate itself by means of\r\nwar?\"\r\n\r\nPro-Boers delight to exhibit in the shop windows a picture representing\r\nthree Transvaal soldiers; a youth of sixteen, an old man of sixty-five,\r\nand a man in the prime of life. What does it prove? That every Boer is\r\na soldier. They have no other calling; to drive ox-teams; ride; shoot;\r\nkeep a sharp eye on the Kaffirs in charge of their cattle; use the\r\nsjambok freely \"in Boer fashion,\" to make them work; these are their\r\noccupations. Their civilisation is one of the most characteristic types\r\nof a military civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing, that so many Europeans among the lovers of peace,\r\nshould actually be the fiercest enemies of England, a country which\r\nrepresents industrial civilisation in so high a degree, that she stands\r\nalone, in all Europe, in refusing to adopt compulsory military service.\r\nSuch lovers of peace range themselves on the side of professional\r\nfighters against peaceable citizens. They are for the Boer spoliator\r\nagainst the despoiled Uitlanders. They take their stand against the\r\nEnglish who in 1881 and 1884 voluntarily restored autonomy to the\r\nTransvaal, and in favor of the Boer, who in the Petition of Rights,\r\n1881, took for programme, as in the pamphlet recently published by Dr.\r\nReitz, \"Africa for the Afrikanders from the Zambesi to Simon's Bay.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Government, far from desiring fresh conquests, is drawn on\r\nby its colonists. France colonises by sending an army, to be followed by\r\nofficials; then the government, the press, and committees of all sorts,\r\nbeg and pray refractory home lovers to go forth and settle in the\r\nconquered territory. Englishmen go out to Australia, Borneo,\r\nJohannesburg; and the British Government has to follow them. It is not\r\nEnglish trade which follows the flag, it is the flag which follows the\r\ntrade. The present crisis was not brought about by the zeal of British\r\nstatesmen, but by their weakness in 1881 and 1884; and by the habit\r\nwhich they have allowed the Government of Pretoria of violating\r\nconventions with impunity. To such a degree were these violations\r\ncarried on with regard to the Uitlanders (chiefly English) who, relying\r\non the guarantee of the Transvaal Government, had settled and invested\r\nmillions of capital in the country, that, dreading for their lives after\r\nthe murder of Edgar, they presented the petition of March 28th, 1899, to\r\nthe British Government. No government in the world, approached in such a\r\nmanner, could have refused to move; and where European governments have\r\ngone wrong is that, instead of supporting the action of Great Britain,\r\nthey let President Krüger believe that they would intervene against her,\r\nto the prejudice even of their own countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that British Uitlanders only appealed to their own\r\ngovernment, after having, conjointly with Uitlanders of other\r\nnationalities, addressed various petitions, since 1894, to the Pretoria\r\nGovernment which petitions were received with contempt, President Krüger\r\nreplying: \"Protest! protest as much as you like! I have arms, and you\r\nhave none!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Le Siècle_, April 14th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--_The Moral Worth of the Boers._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper affirms that \"with regard to moral worth the Boers do not\r\nfall short of any European nation.\" I have not wished to digress from my\r\nargument by entering upon known cases of corruption concerning the\r\nVolksraad in general, and Mr. Krüger in particular, but we have seen\r\ntheir methods of legislation, of administering justice, and of keeping\r\ntheir pledged word; let that suffice.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper collects all the calumnies against British soldiers, but he\r\ndare not aver that the Boers have not been guilty of the abuse of the\r\nwhite flag, and of the Red Cross. At the beginning of April, Lieutenant\r\nWilliams, trusting in the good faith of a party of Boers, who hoisted\r\nthe white flag, was shot dead by them.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper says \"all the despatches have been garbled, defeats turned\r\ninto victories.\" It is not of Dr. Leyds he is speaking, but of the\r\nEnglish. He declares (February 1st) that \"the best English regiments are\r\nalready disintegrated,\" that \"the immensity of the cost will frighten\r\nthe English shopkeepers,\" that \"the ministerial majority will likely\r\nsoon be dissipated.\" In giving these proofs of perspicacity, Dr. Kuyper\r\ncharitably adds, concerning England, \"her reverses may be her\r\nsalvation.\" And in order to ensure her this salvation, he looks forward\r\nto \"those projected alliances, whose tendency it is unquestionably to\r\ndraw together against that insular power,\" of which Dr. Kuyper would\r\nfain \"be the son, were he not a Dutchman,\" and yet whose destruction he\r\nso ardently desires. This far seeing politician forgets that were his\r\nwishes realised, Holland would be the first victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--_A Lioness out of Place._\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper delivers a lengthy dissertation upon \"the inadequacy of the\r\nChristian movement\"; and shows himself worthy to be a collaborator of\r\nM. Brunetière by excommunicating Schleiermacher, \"the typical\r\nrepresentative,\" says the Rev. J.F. Smith, of modern effort to reconcile\r\nscience, theology and the \"world of to-day with Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nHe inveighs against individualism, Darwinism, and the law of evolution;\r\nhe speaks of \"the broad paths of human sin,\" and accuses the English\r\nclergy of \"betraying the God of Justice\"; he places before them the God\r\nof the Boers, declaring that \"an invisible Power protects their\r\ncommandos.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Kuyper who is much better acquainted with the North Sea herrings\r\nthan with African lions, concludes his articles with this daring\r\nmetaphor:--\r\n\r\n     \"So long as the roar of the Transvaal lioness, surrounded by her\r\n     cubs, shall be heard from the heights of the Drakensberg, so long\r\n     shall the Boers remain unconquered.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the Boers have surmounted the armorial bearings of the South\r\nAfrican Republic with an eagle, bird of prey beloved of conquerers. It\r\nis true that in the left quarter of their coat of arms is a small lion\r\nlying down with bristling mane. It is probably the lady-friend of this\r\nferocious quadruped which Dr. Kuyper has chosen to symbolise the people\r\nof the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nI would merely remark to him that the highest summit of the Drakensberg\r\nrises to an elevation of something like 10,000 feet. It is situated away\r\nfrom the frontier of the Transvaal, between Natal, Basutoland, and the\r\nOrange Free State. I imagine it is there that Dr. Kuyper's Transvaal\r\nlioness is to take her stand, in order to carry out Krüger's programme\r\n\"Africa for the Afrikanders, from the Zambesi to Simon's Bay.\" But the\r\npoor animal would not be long on that height, before she would die of\r\ncold and hunger. This concluding imagery well reflects the spirit of Dr.\r\nKuyper's essay; it demonstrates to perfection the rapacious and\r\nmegalomaniac ideal of the Boers; and in his grandiloquence the author\r\ncontrives to express exactly the reverse of what he means.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--_Moral Unity by Means of Unity of Method._\r\n\r\nHere again Dr. Kuyper puts metaphor in the place of reasoning; a truly\r\nEastern mode of discussion.\r\n\r\nEver since I entered upon public life, I have always endeavoured, in the\r\nstudy of social and political phenomena, to eliminate subjective\r\naffirmations, the dogmatic and comminatory _a priori_, the antiquated\r\nmethods which consist of taking words for things, _nomina_ for _numina_,\r\nmetaphors for realities.\r\n\r\nPhysical and biological science owe to the objective method the progress\r\nthat, from the times of Bacon and Galileo, has transformed the face of\r\nthe world; social science must henceforth replace rhetoric,\r\nscholasticism and all balderdash of that kind; affirmations, _a priori_,\r\nand excommunications, by the rigorous scrutiny of facts: Unity of Method\r\nwill lead to Moral Unity.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Yves Guyot. _Les Principes de 1789 et le Socialisme_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot do better than reproduce at the end of this pamphlet the\r\nanalysis made by me in _Le Siècle_, March 14th, of a remarkable article\r\nwritten by M. Tallichet, Editor of the _Bibliothèque Universelle de\r\nLausanne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND, HOLLAND AND GERMANY.[26]\r\n\r\nI have good reason for believing that President Krüger was kept by Dr.\r\nLeyds under the illusion that he could count on intervention in his\r\nfavour. However, \"Who should intervene?\" is the question asked by M.\r\nTallichet in his article, _La Guerre du Transvaal et l'Europe_,\r\npublished by _La Bibliothèque Universelle de Lausanne_.\r\n\r\n     \"President MacKinley, as was asked of him in a petition organised\r\n     by the Peace League? He has no such intention. Of the European\r\n     Powers, three only could have tried to do so: Russia, Germany and\r\n     France. Russia, however, who might have induced France to act with\r\n     her, will not trouble herself about it. Nicholas II., her\r\n     sovereign, has but lately taken part at the Hague in a conference\r\n     promoted by himself for the purpose of considering the means of\r\n     insuring peace. Having taken the initiative he may be believed to\r\n     have been actuated by philanthropic motives. But it also happens\r\n     that peace is, for Russia, of the greatest importance, grown, as\r\n     she is, out of all proportion, continuing to extend her tentacles\r\n     wherever there is a chance of seizing something. To this cause of\r\n     weakness must be added others: the need of money for her gigantic\r\n     enterprises; the famine, now become endemic, by which her European\r\n     provinces are ravaged, depopulated and reduced to the greatest\r\n     misery. She is profiting now by her experiences after the Crimean\r\n     War. As long as she remains inactive, the influence she exercises\r\n     on general politics by her mere extent, and the mysterious power\r\n     which seems to be the corollary of it, far exceeds her actual\r\n     strength. On her descending into the arena, however, this optical\r\n     illusion is dissipated, as was apparent in the recent Turkish War;\r\n     her prestige was lessened. No steps will therefore be taken by her\r\n     to increase England's difficulties by which she gains much without\r\n     striking a single blow.\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to France, her only interest in the question is her\r\n     rivalry with England and the possibility, afforded by the latter's\r\n     difficulties, of re-opening the Egyptian Question. Public opinion\r\n     was sounded on this subject by a few newspapers, government organs\r\n     among them, but without obtaining the desired result. Although not\r\n     daring to counsel a formal alliance with Germany, they would have\r\n     liked to see her intervene. The present French Government, and\r\n     especially M. Delcassé may be credited with too much good sense and\r\n     good feeling to resort to the foolish, pin-pricking policy of M.\r\n     Hanotaux to which the Fashoda incident is really due. Such blunders\r\n     are not made a second time.\"\r\n\r\nOnly Germany remains to be considered. That there have been intimate\r\nrelations between the Governments at Pretoria and Berlin, is certain. At\r\none time the Emperor's aspiration was to unite his possessions in East\r\nAfrica to those in the West, and he counted on the Transvaal to assist\r\nhim. Mr. Stead's opinion on this subject, at the time of the Jameson\r\nRaid, has already been quoted by us (_Le Siècle_, December 28th, 1899).\r\nBut this policy has since been renounced by him; the German Government\r\ntook fright at the influence exercised by Dr. Leyds on certain of the\r\nBerlin newspapers; guns and Mauser rifles have been furnished by Krupp,\r\nbut that is a private firm; German officers have entered the Boer army,\r\nto what extent have they been disavowed? The Emperor William is\r\ncertainly interested in the Transvaal War.\r\n\r\n     \"He gets others to experiment on the value of German armaments,\r\n     rifles, guns, and all the tactical and strategetical problems\r\n     incident to the perfection of modern arms, and which have not yet\r\n     been solved. Experience, that is to say war, is worth everything in\r\n     such a matter as this, and the Boers with their German officers are\r\n     literally working for 'the King of Prussia.'\"\r\n\r\nThat the Emperor should wish the Boers to succeed is logical enough, and\r\nto all Frenchmen capable of thought, to Belgians, Swiss and Dutch too we\r\ncommend the way in which this desire is proved by M. Tallichet:\r\n\r\n     \"Should the Boers be successful, England's power would be lessened.\r\n     She could no longer maintain the balance of power in Europe, which\r\n     is a service of inestimable benefit to our continent, especially to\r\n     the smaller countries, and to none more than to Holland. The\r\n     conquest of the Netherlands is a great temptation to Germany, who\r\n     would thereby gain exactly what she wishes: an excellent sea-board;\r\n     a great number of sailors; colonies, at the very moment when she is\r\n     aspiring to a first-class fleet. In a recent number of the\r\n     semi-official _Norddeutsche Zeitung_, an article was published by\r\n     Dr. Ed. von Hartmann, suggesting that Holland should be persuaded,\r\n     or if necessary forced by commercial competition to become part of\r\n     the German Empire, which would thus gain all it could possibly\r\n     desire. Is it likely that this glorious little country will\r\n     consent? Its charming young Queen, said to be a great sympathiser\r\n     with the Boers, will she descend from her present position to take\r\n     rank with the German Princes under the Emperor whose equal she is\r\n     to-day? Assuredly not.\r\n\r\n     \"But if, on the other hand, England were to be paralysed, no\r\n     defence of Holland would be possible; France could not undertake it\r\n     alone, much as it would be to her interest; and what other Powers\r\n     would be capable of resisting?\r\n\r\n     \"Of course, it may be urged, the German Emperor would never do such\r\n     a thing. Perhaps not, he is not immortal however, and there is no\r\n     knowing what may be done by his successors. Besides, by his\r\n     friendship with Abdul-Hamid, he has shown himself capable of\r\n     sacrificing everything to the greatness of his Empire. It would in\r\n     all probability be unnecessary to resort to force; there are less\r\n     brutal ways just as efficacious. In the event of Germany possessing\r\n     undisputed preponderance, with no counter-weight, she will bring an\r\n     irresistible pressure to bear upon Holland, as did Russia to poor\r\n     Finland, and induce her to join the Germanic Confederation. When,\r\n     therefore, Holland upholds the Transvaal, and seeks to annihilate\r\n     England, she, like the Boers, though in a different manner, is\r\n     working for \"the King of Prussia\".\"\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend this passage in M. Ed. Tallichet's article to the\r\nattention of my fellow-countrymen; the folly which dominates our foreign\r\npolicy, alarms me as much as that which caused the innocence of Dreyfus\r\nto be denied for years, by Ministers, _the état-major_, and many\r\nmillions of Frenchmen. Justice was sacrificed by them to paltry\r\nconsiderations, and to-day those of us who are infatuated with sympathy\r\nfor the pillaging policy of the Boers seem to have set up as their ideal\r\nthe completion of the disaster of 1870!\r\n\r\nM. Ed. Tallichet's article should be read and carefully considered by\r\nall who take an interest in the future of Europe. The question is\r\npresented by him fully and clearly; there is no trace of sympathy for or\r\nantipathy to Boers or British; the fate of France, Holland, Belgium,\r\nSwitzerland, is equally discussed. Their position is linked with\r\nEngland's power; any injury to her power would weaken any of the smaller\r\ncountries above-mentioned, and be a source of danger to France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Le Siècle_, March 14th, 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. KUYPER'S ADMISSION.\r\n\r\nI. Offer to Dr. Kuyper to reproduce his article.--II. Dilatory reply of\r\nDr. Kuyper.--III. Withdrawal of Dr. Kuyper.--IV. M. Brunetière's\r\nrefusal.--V. The Queen of Holland and Dr. Kuyper's article.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFER TO DR. KUYPER.\r\n\r\nOn March 25th I addressed the following registered letter to Dr. Kuyper:\r\n\r\n     _March 25th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to send you the numbers of _Le Siècle_ containing\r\n     a criticism of your article, \"La Crise Sud-Africaine,\" which\r\n     appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.\r\n\r\n     In order to present the _pros_ and _cons_ to the reader at one and\r\n     the same time, I ask you to agree to the following proposition: _I\r\n     offer to publish in one pamphlet your article and my reply._ I\r\n     undertake to pay the cost and if there should be any profits to\r\n     divide them with you.\r\n\r\n     By accepting this proposal you will show that you are as convinced\r\n     of the solidity of your arguments as I am of the solidity of mine.\r\n\r\n     YVES GUYOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. REPLY OF DR. KUYPER.\r\n\r\nI received the following letter, March 29th:\r\n\r\n     AMSTERDAM,\r\n       _March 28th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     TO M. YVES GUYOT.\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     Only having received one number of your paper (23,381) I do not\r\n     know whether your criticism is finished. As soon as I have it all\r\n     before me--with references to the documents cited, if you please,\r\n     otherwise it is difficult to follow--I will see whether it calls\r\n     for a detailed reply on my part, in which case I might, according\r\n     to American precedent, republish my article, inserting, with your\r\n     permission, your reply. This was done by the New York _Outlook_,\r\n     when it published in the same number, \"the Case of the Boers,\" and\r\n     \"the Case of the British.\"\r\n\r\n     At the same time the copyright of my article belongs to the Editor\r\n     of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, without whose permission I can do\r\n     nothing. As I shall be in Paris before long I will ask him for it,\r\n     should your polemic attack seem to me to require a reply.\r\n\r\n     With regard to your proposal to leave the risks of a fresh\r\n     publication to you, while sharing the profits, although I\r\n     appreciate the delicacy of such a suggestion, I could not accept\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     KUYPER.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks on his letter were published by me in _Le Siècle_,\r\nMarch 30th.\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to the first point, I regret that, at the time of\r\n     writing, Dr. Kuyper should only have received one number of _Le\r\n     Siècle_; each of my replies having been sent to him under\r\n     registered cover on the day of publication. It is unfortunate for\r\n     me that Dr. Kuyper's Article should have appeared in the _Revue des\r\n     Deux Mondes_, for that brings me again into contact with M.\r\n     Brunetière, and it is well-known that M. Brunetière who, last year\r\n     for fifteen days burdened _Le Siècle_ with his prose, does not wish\r\n     this discussion to be presented to the reader in its entirety. I am\r\n     greatly afraid of his desiring the same isolation for Dr. Kuyper's\r\n     article.\r\n\r\n     \"As far as I am concerned, having began my reply to Dr. Kuyper I\r\n     shall continue it. If it is not M. Brunetière's wish that our\r\n     articles should be published together he will thereby acknowledge\r\n     anew the force of my replies. Were they not documented and\r\n     convincing, he would not fear their proximity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ANOTHER LETTER.\r\n\r\nOn April 6th I sent the following letter to Dr. Kuyper (registered).\r\n\r\n     _April 6th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     In a few days I shall have finished my replies to your article;\r\n     they will then be published in pamphlet form. I have the honour to\r\n     ask you definitely whether you accept my proposal to precede them\r\n     with your article in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.\r\n\r\n     YVES GUYOT.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this I received the following letter from Dr. Kuyper\r\nwritten from the Grand Hotel, Paris:\r\n\r\n         GRAND HOTEL,\r\n     12, BOULEVARD DES CAPUCINES,\r\n       _April 12th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     My last letter informed you to what extent I could meet your\r\n     wishes.\r\n\r\n     Now that, without regard to my reply, you simply ask for the\r\n     authorisation to print my article in a pamphlet which you propose\r\n     to publish, I can only refer you to the person who has the power to\r\n     dispose of the copyright.\r\n\r\n     KUYPER.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that I had acted in accordance with the reply\r\nof Dr. Kuyper, who in his letter, March 28th, wrote: \"The copyright of\r\nmy article belongs to the Editor of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, without\r\nwhose permission I can do nothing. As I shall be in Paris before long I\r\nwill ask him for it should your polemics seem to me to require a reply.\"\r\n\r\nBut since Mr. Kuyper withdrew from the correspondence I wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to Mr. Brunetière, Editor of the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_:\r\n\r\n     _April 13th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     TO THE EDITOR, SIR,\r\n\r\n     In the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, February 1st, an article was\r\n     published by Dr. Kuyper under the title of \"La Crise\r\n     Sud-Africaine.\"\r\n\r\n     I have published a criticism upon it in _Le Siècle;_ and in order\r\n     that both sides of the question may be presented to the reader, I\r\n     have asked Dr. Kuyper's authorisation to reproduce his article in a\r\n     pamphlet in which I purpose to collect my own.\r\n\r\n     On March 28th, Dr. Kuyper wrote me: \"The copyright of my article\r\n     belongs to the editor of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, without whose\r\n     permission I can do nothing. As I shall be in Paris before long I\r\n     will ask him for it, should your polemic attack seem to me to\r\n     require a reply.\"\r\n\r\n     To-day Dr. Kuyper writes to me from the Grand Hotel, Paris: \"I can\r\n     only refer you to the person who has the power to dispose of the\r\n     copyright.\" Since I am asked by Dr. Kuyper to make the request\r\n     which he had undertaken to make himself, I will do so. I have the\r\n     honour to ask you for the authorisation to publish Dr. Kuyper's\r\n     article which appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ under the\r\n     title of \"La Crise Sud-Africaine,\" and to inform me of your\r\n     conditions for the reproduction.\r\n\r\n     YVES GUYOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. M. BRUNETIÈRE'S REFUSAL.\r\n\r\nThe next day I received the following from M. Brunetière:\r\n\r\n       PARIS,\r\n     _April 14th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     You ask me for the authorisation to publish in a pamphlet Dr.\r\n     Kuyper's article which appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\n     under the title of \"La Crise Sud-Africaine.\" I hasten to refuse you\r\n     the authorisation.\r\n\r\n     I am, Sir, etc.,\r\n       F. BRUNETIÈRE.\r\n\r\nIn this reply I trace M. Brunetière's habitual courtesy. If I do not\r\nthank him for his refusal, I yet thank him for the promptness with which\r\nit was signified by him.\r\n\r\nIt had been my desire to enable the reading public to judge for\r\nthemselves the value of the arguments put forward by Dr. Kuyper and\r\nmyself; but it was evidently M. Brunetière's wish that Dr. Kuyper's\r\narticle should be known only to the readers of the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, and that they should remain ignorant of my reply. This is in\r\nitself a confession; for undoubtedly had Dr. Kuyper been convinced that\r\nit was impossible for me to refute his arguments he would have requested\r\nM. Brunetière to give me the authorisation to reproduce his article.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nOn April 26th a telegram from the Havas Agency announced that the Queen\r\nof Holland had received the journalists of Amsterdam, of whom Dr. Kuyper\r\nis President.\r\n\r\nI therefore wrote the following letter to Mr. W.H. de Beaufort, the\r\nDutch Minister for Foreign Affairs:\r\n\r\n       PARIS,\r\n     _April 27th, 1900._\r\n\r\n     TO H.E. THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     The Havas Agency, in a telegram, April 26, gives the following\r\n     information:\r\n\r\n          \"Replying to a speech made by Dr. Kuyper, President of the\r\n          Society of Journalists, the Queen said she had read with\r\n          interest his article on the South African crisis, published in\r\n          a Paris review. The Queen expressed the hope that the article\r\n          would be circulated abroad, adding that she considered it\r\n          important that it should be widely distributed in America.\"\r\n\r\n     That the Queen of a constitutional government, such as that of\r\n     Holland, should have spoken in this way, proves that the Cabinet is\r\n     of the same mind. I trust, therefore, that I am not too bold in\r\n     asking your assistance to carry out Her Majesty's intentions.\r\n\r\n     I had asked Dr. Kuyper's authorisation to reproduce his article at\r\n     the beginning of a pamphlet; he referred me to M. Brunetière, who\r\n     with the courtesy of which he has given me so many proofs, replied:\r\n     \"I hasten to refuse your request.\"\r\n\r\n     M. Brunetière's views are evidently opposed to those of the Queen\r\n     of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n     It is true that the article would have been followed by my\r\n     criticism, but if the arguments therein contained are irrefutable,\r\n     why fear the proximity of my refutation? I beg you, therefore, to\r\n     be kind enough to ask M. Brunetière to give me permission to second\r\n     the views of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands by assisting\r\n     to circulate Dr. Kuyper's article.\r\n\r\n     YVES GUYOT.\r\n\r\nI have published my pamphlet while awaiting M. Brunetière's reply to the\r\nDutch Government which can hardly do otherwise than make the request,\r\nagreeing, as it does, with the views of Her Majesty. Should M.\r\nBrunetière by any chance cease to fear the proximity to Dr. Kuyper's\r\nassertions of the facts and documents published by me, I will issue a\r\nnew Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST PRO-BOER MANIFESTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing articles were written Dr. Leyds and Mr. Boer have\r\nnot been idle. M. Pierre Foncin, a General Inspector of the University,\r\nhas compiled on behalf of a Society called \"Le Sou des Boers,\" a\r\nmanifesto ending thus: \"Well then, since this lust of gold has resulted\r\nin war, let the gold of France be poured out in floods, in aid of the\r\ninnocent victims!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of considerable influence brought to bear upon this member of\r\nthe University, the Committee, after some weeks' work, only managed to\r\nscrape together something like four hundred pounds. Since then, no more\r\nhas been heard of it, and its place has been taken by \"The Committee for\r\nthe Independence of the Boers,\" with M. Pauliat, a Nationalist Senator,\r\nat its head. Its object was, in the first place, to organise a reception\r\nfor the Boer delegates on their return from America.\r\n\r\nIt was confidently expected by the promoters of the enterprise that it\r\nwould afford a good opportunity for a demonstration in opposition to the\r\nGovernment on the fourteenth of July. The delegates were received at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville by the Nationalist Municipal Council, whose President, M.\r\nGrébauval, addressed them in virulent speeches, while the great square\r\nin front remained empty. The Irish Banquet which took place this year on\r\nthe twelfth of July under the Presidency of Mr. Archdeacon, and which\r\nhad been much talked of in 1899 at the time of the Auteuil\r\nmanifestation, when President Loubet was hit with a stick by Baron\r\nChristiani, passed off amidst complete indifference. No disturbance of\r\nany kind occurred on the fourteenth of July.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the Interparliamentary Union in favour of Peace and\r\nArbitration was to be held on the 31st of July. It was stated that the\r\nBoer delegates were going to present a memorial, whilst M. Pauliat\r\nintended to raise the Transvaal question. My answer was that I intended\r\nto be there too, and considered it of interest to treat that question.\r\nDr. Leyds knew that the majority of the English Members of Parliament\r\nwho belonged to the Congress had declared themselves against the South\r\nAfrican war, and he anticipated that owing to their former declarations\r\nthey would find it difficult not to side with the pro-Boer sympathisers.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a clever idea. But on the 30th of July there was a meeting\r\nof the executive Committee composed of two members of each of the\r\nvarious nationalities, at which the English members declared that, if\r\ncontrary to its regulations, the Transvaal question was to be discussed\r\nthey were resolved to withdraw. The Committee decided to admit Mr.\r\nWessels, formerly Speaker of the Orange Free State Parliament, simply as\r\na member of the Congress; to oppose any discussion of the Transvaal\r\nquestion and to rule that the communication made by the Boer delegates\r\nwas merely to be circulated among the members as individuals.\r\n\r\nMy pamphlet, _La Politique Boer_, and my answer in _Le Siècle_ of the\r\n1st of August, were also distributed. Here are a few extracts:\r\n\r\n     \"The manifesto of Messrs. Fisher, Wessels and Wolmarans, delegates\r\n     for the South African Republics, has been a disappointment to me. I\r\n     expected that these gentlemen would produce some arguments; they\r\n     have contented themselves with giving us a summary of Dr. Reitz's\r\n     pamphlet--\"A Century of Wrongs.\" It ends with the same incitement\r\n     to annexation, which was already to be found in the cry for help\r\n     sent on the 17th of February, 1881, by the Transvaal to the Orange\r\n     Free State--\"Africa for the Afrikander, from the Zambesi to Simon's\r\n     Bay!\" The delegates recognise that the time for claiming new\r\n     territories has passed; they describe themselves as a nation of\r\n     mild and peace-loving men, the victims of perpetual English\r\n     persecution. I do not wish to discuss their way of dealing with\r\n     historical facts, about which they are not so candid as was Mr.\r\n     Krüger in his 1881 manifesto, because what we are now interested\r\n     in, is not that which happened in times long ago, but what has\r\n     happened since the annexation of the Transvaal by England, on the\r\n     12th of April, 1877. They do not say a word of the state of anarchy\r\n     then prevailing in the Transvaal, nor of its military reserves, nor\r\n     of the threatening attitude of Sekukuni and Cetewayo. Whereas in\r\n     the manifesto of 1881, with these facts still fresh in the memory\r\n     of its author, it is said: \"At the outset our military operations\r\n     were not very successful. In the opinion of our opponents we were\r\n     too weak to resist successfully an attack from the natives,\" Sir\r\n     Theophilus Shepstone, unable to restore order, had finally to annex\r\n     the Transvaal. This he did at the head of twenty-five policemen\r\n     only. Had the Transvaal been left to itself Sekukuni's and\r\n     Cetewayo's impis would have overrun the country and turned out the\r\n     Boers, who, after they had been delivered from their enemies by the\r\n     English, proclaimed \"a war of independence\" in December, 1880. The\r\n     Majuba disaster, 27th of February, 1881, in which the English had\r\n     92 killed, 134 wounded, and 59 prisoners, is of course mentioned by\r\n     the delegates. An English army twelve thousand strong was\r\n     advancing; but though the Queen's speech referred to the fact of\r\n     the annexation, Mr. Gladstone, who in his Midlothian campaign, had\r\n     protested against it, agreed to the 1881 Convention in which the\r\n     independence of the Transvaal under England's suzerainty was\r\n     recognised.\r\n\r\n     \"The Boer nation,\" the Boer delegates say in their Memorandum,\r\n     \"could not bring themselves to accept the Convention; from all\r\n     parts of the country protests arose against the Suzerainty clause.\"\r\n     I admit willingly that the Boers did not abide by the Convention.\r\n     In 1884, speaking in the House of Lords,--Lord Derby said: \"The\r\n     attitude of the Boers might constitute a _casus belli_ but as the\r\n     Government were not in the mood for war, and the position of the\r\n     English resident in Pretoria was anomalous,\" he assented to the\r\n     Convention of 27th February, 1884, \"by which,\" say the Boer\r\n     delegates, \"the suzerainty over the Transvaal was abolished, and\r\n     the South African Republic's complete independence acknowledged.\"\r\n     This is their contention, now for the facts.\"\r\n\r\nI then adverted to the events of which the XVth. and XVIth. chapters of\r\n_La Politique Boer_ give a summary. The Jameson raid is, of course, the\r\nmainstay of the delegates' argument. After showing what this is really\r\nworth, and also discussing the arbitration question, I concluded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The Memorandum shirks all the questions; documents are not\r\n     referred to; there is nothing in it but assertions, which are to be\r\n     accepted without discussion. It ends by mixing up what relates to\r\n     the organisation and adminstration of the two Republics. But the\r\n     adminstration of the Orange Free State and the adminstration of the\r\n     South African Republic were quite different things. By following\r\n     Krüger's policy Mr. Steyn has been guilty of a crime as well as a\r\n     great political blunder. Had he remained neutral the English army\r\n     would have been compelled to establish the basis of its operations\r\n     much farther North, and would have been deprived of the use of the\r\n     railway line to Bloemfontein. Moreover, when peace was restored, he\r\n     would have remained independent. The Memorandum alludes to the\r\n     prosperity of the Transvaal, but forgets to mention that the only\r\n     share taken in it by the Boers has been an ever-increasing\r\n     appropriation of the wealth created by the Uitlanders' industry,\r\n     capital and labour.\r\n\r\n     \"The Memorandum mentions also the laws passed annually, but is\r\n     careful to omit law No. 1 of 1897, by which Mr. Krüger was\r\n     empowered to exact from the judges a declaration that decisions of\r\n     the Volksraad would be enforced by them as legal enactments,\r\n     whether they were in agreement with the constitutions or not, and\r\n     to dismiss at a moment's notice any one of them whose response\r\n     might seem to him unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n     \"We have already spoken of the concluding sentences in the\r\n     Memorandum. Messrs. A. Fischer, C.H. Wessels, A.D.W. Wolmarans\r\n     \"appeal to the _Conférence de l'Union Interparlementaire_ to take\r\n     in hand their cause.\" The Executive Committee has, as has already\r\n     been said, ruled the question out of order. This decision is not to\r\n     be regretted considering the tendencies of the delegates'\r\n     Memorandum; it does not help their cause any more than does Dr.\r\n     Kuyper's article.\"\r\n\r\nM. Pauliat complained bitterly of the decision. A progressive member of\r\nthe Belgian deputation, Mr. Lorand, tried to revive the question on the\r\n2nd of August by means of the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"The tenth Conference of the Interparliamentary Union for\r\n     International Arbitration now meeting in Paris being cognisant of\r\n     acknowledging the resolutions of the Conference at the Hague, and\r\n     being desirous to express its gratitude to all who have contributed\r\n     towards its results; trusts, that in future the Powers will avail\r\n     themselves of the means put at their disposal for the amicable\r\n     settlement of international disputes and regret that \"they have not\r\n     done so\" in the actual conflict between England and the South\r\n     African Republics.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, M. Beernaert, with all authority conferred upon him by his\r\nposition as the delegate of the Belgian Government at the Hague\r\nConference, observed that the Transvaal was not in a position to avail\r\nitself of the resolution arrived at by the Conference--because that\r\nConference was no longer in existence, and because the Boers had not\r\nbeen a party to it. On his motion the words \"could not do so\" were\r\ninserted instead of the words \"had not done so.\"\r\n\r\nNow why were the Boers not represented at the Hague Conference?\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Holland, in whose name the invitations were issued, had\r\nundoubtedly been appealed to by them, to admit the Transvaal to the\r\nCongress in conformity with Dr. Reitz's contention that \"the Transvaal\r\nhad inherent rights to be an international state,\"--but their request\r\nhad been refused, as would have been a similar demand coming from\r\nFinland or the Bey of Tunis.\r\n\r\nThe case was on all fours with that of the Vatican. When the Italian\r\nGovernment declared that they would not sit in the Conference if an\r\ninvitation were sent to the Holy See, the Vatican was omitted.\r\n\r\nSuch is the simple fact; and it is just this fact which M. Lorand and M.\r\nBeernaert brought into relief by the resolution of 2nd August. I am\r\nquite sure that that was not their intention; the fact remains,\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICAN CRITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters written by Messrs. Labouchere, Ellis and Clark, Members of\r\nParliament, found in Pretoria, are not of much importance to my mind.\r\nThe authors were not branded as traitors by Mr. Chamberlain, he only\r\nwanted to place the letters before the public and their electors, who\r\nmost likely will find these three gentlemen guilty of another offence\r\nthan that of supporting Mr. Chamberlain's policy with President Krüger\r\nwhile they made him believe that, as they were fighting against that\r\npolicy in England, there was no necessity for him to heed their advice.\r\nTheir attitude in Europe was bound to nullify the effect of the warnings\r\nthey were sending to Africa. It is astounding to see sedate men\r\ncontradict themselves in that way. I cannot help wondering at Dr. Clark\r\nboasting on the 27th of September that owing to his endeavours Mr.\r\nStead's pamphlet was widely circulated, though, according to his words,\r\n\"Mr. Stead had to the last moment been our enemy.\" The fact is that Mr.\r\nStead had met Dr. Leyds (he went on meeting him during the war), and had\r\nbeen persuaded to drop Cecil Rhodes and Jameson in spite of his former\r\npraise of them. The publicity given to these letters does evidently not\r\ngive weight to the opinion of the writers or Mr. Stead either; the\r\ninterest of the Blue Book on \"Correspondence relating to the recent\r\nPolitical Situation in South Africa\" does not lie that way, but it lies\r\nin the opinion and advice of an Afrikander--to be found in Sir H. de\r\nVilliers' letters--he being the Speaker of the House in Cape Colony,\r\nChief Justice, and one of the leaders of the Afrikander party. Sir\r\nHenry de Villiers has been often taken to task for being a partisan of\r\nthe Boers, he cannot, therefore, be suspected of biassed ideas in favour\r\nof Great Britain. Some extracts of the letters he wrote to President\r\nSteyn on the 21st of May to Mr. Fischer and to his brother Mr. Melius de\r\nVilliers on the 31st of July, then on the 28th September, twelve days\r\nbefore the ultimatum was sent by Mr. Krüger, show to what extent he\r\nappreciated the latter's policy. His opinion carries all the more weight\r\nas he was one of the delegates to negotiate the 1881 Convention.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"I am quite certain that if in 1881 it had been known to my fellow\r\n     Commissioners that the President would adopt his retrogressive\r\n     policy, neither President Brand nor I would ever have induced them\r\n     to consent to sign the Convention. They would have advised the\r\n     Secretary of State to let matters revert to the condition in which\r\n     they were before peace was concluded; in other words, to recommence\r\n     the war.\"\r\n\r\nHere are his views on the actual situation:\r\n\r\n     \"On my recent visit to Pretoria I did not visit the President as I\r\n     considered it hopeless to think of making any impression on him,\r\n     but I saw Reitz, Smuts and Schalk Burger, who, I thought, would be\r\n     amenable to argument, but I fear that either my advice had no\r\n     effect on them, or else their opinion had no weight with the\r\n     President.\r\n\r\n     \"I urged upon them to advise the President to open the Volksraad\r\n     with promises of a liberal franchise and drastic reforms.\r\n\r\n     \"It would have been so much better if these had come voluntarily\r\n     from the Government instead of being gradually forced from them. In\r\n     the former case they would rally the greater number of the\r\n     malcontents around them, in the latter case no gratitude will be\r\n     felt to the Republic for any concessions made by it. Besides, there\r\n     can be no doubt that as the alien population increases, as it\r\n     undoubtedly will, their demands will increase with their\r\n     discontent, and ultimately a great deal more will have to be\r\n     conceded than will now satisfy them. The franchise proposals made\r\n     by the President seems to be simply ridiculous.\r\n\r\n     \"I have always been a well-wisher to the Republic, and if I had any\r\n     influence with the President I would advise him no longer to sit on\r\n     the boiler to prevent it from bursting. Some safety-valves are\r\n     required for the activities of the new population. In their\r\n     irritation they abuse the Government, often unjustly, in the press,\r\n     and send petitions to the Queen, but that was only to be expected.\r\n     Let the Transvaal Legislature give them a liberal franchise and\r\n     allow them local self-government for their towns and some portion\r\n     of the discontent will be allayed.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I beg to observe, is exactly what I said at the time when people\r\nin Europe who called themselves friends of the Boers yet are only Dr.\r\nLeyds' friends or rather dupes urged upon Mr. Krüger the expediency of\r\ngoing on with his mistaken and retrograde policy, and continental\r\ndiplomatists assured him that he might with impunity disregard the\r\nclaims of the Uitlanders and England's warnings.\r\n\r\nThose who have never condescended to read the Blue Book or the short\r\nchapter in this pamphlet, in which an analysis of this Blue Book is\r\ngiven are never tired of referring to concessions and franchise schemes\r\nproffered by Mr. Krüger.\r\n\r\nWhat does Sir Henry de Villiers say about it!\r\n\r\n     \"The franchise proposal made by the President seems to be simply\r\n     ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Krüger he sent the English Enactment of 1870 on Naturalisation,\r\nand urged him to have it adopted. Is not this an answer to those who\r\ncontended that England \"would not be satisfied with what she offered the\r\nTransvaal?\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time his lack of confidence in the Volksraad's promises is\r\nshown here:\r\n\r\n     \"I fear there would always still be a danger of the Volksraad\r\n     revoking the gift before it has come into operation.\"\r\n\r\nHis second letter is dated 31st of July, more than six weeks after the\r\nBloemfontein Conference. He writes to Mr. Fischer who acted as\r\ngo-between the Cape Afrikanders and President Krüger. Mr. Chamberlain\r\nhad requested that a mixed Commission be appointed to enquire into the\r\nmerits of the franchise law, passed in accordance with Mr. Krüger's\r\nproposals. Here is Sir Henry de Villiers' judgment upon Mr. Krüger's and\r\nMr. Chamberlain's proceedings.\r\n\r\n     \"I am convinced Mr. Krüger's friends must now regret they did not\r\n     recommend to President Krüger three months ago, as I strongly\r\n     urged, to offer voluntarily a liberal franchise bill with such\r\n     safeguards as would prevent the old burghers from being swamped.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Chamberlain's speech was more moderate than I expected it\r\n     would be, and as he holds out an olive branch in the form of a\r\n     joint enquiry into the franchise proposals, would it not be well to\r\n     meet him in this matter? I know that it might be regarded as a\r\n     _partial_ surrender.\"\r\n\r\nThe last sentence runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I don't think that President Krüger and his friends realise the\r\n     gravity of the situation. Even now the State Secretary is doing\r\n     things which would be almost farcical if the times were not so\r\n     serious.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Henry telegrams were suppressed by Dr. Reitz on the\r\nplea that \"the Government should not disseminate lies by its own wires.\"\r\n\r\nMr. de Villiers added:\r\n\r\n     \"The Transvaal will soon not have a single friend left among the\r\n     cultivated classes.\"\r\n\r\nEvents have proved he had a better opinion of them than they deserved.\r\nHe goes on with the following:\r\n\r\n     \"The time really has come when the friends of the Transvaal must\r\n     induce President Krüger to become perfectly frank and take the new\r\n     comers into his confidence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd ends with saying again:\r\n\r\n     \"As one who signed the Convention in 1881 I can assure you that my\r\n     fellow Commissioners would not have signed it if they had not been\r\n     led to believe that President Krüger's policy towards the\r\n     Uitlanders would have been very different from what it has been.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter written the same day to his brother Melius, one can see in\r\nwhat fool's paradise Dr. Reitz and his colleagues were living:\r\n\r\n     \"When I was in the Transvaal three months ago, I found that Reitz\r\n     and others had the most extraordinary notions of the powers and\r\n     duties of a Cape Ministry in case of war. They are Ministers of the\r\n     Crown, and it will be their duty to afford every possible\r\n     assistance to the British Government. Under normal conditions a\r\n     responsible Ministry is perfectly independent in matters of\r\n     internal concern, but in case of war they are bound to place all\r\n     the resources of the Colony at the disposal of the British Crown;\r\n     at least, if they did not do so, they would be liable to\r\n     dismissal.\"\r\n\r\nHere is his opinion on the proceedings in the House of Commons:\r\n\r\n     \"The debate which took place in the House of Commons since I last\r\n     wrote to you satisfies me that the British nation is now determined\r\n     to settle the Transvaal business in a manner satisfactory to\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"I accordingly begged of Krüger's friends to put the matter to him\r\n     in this way: On the one side there is war with England--on the\r\n     other side there are concessions which will avoid war or occupation\r\n     of the country. Now decide at once how far you will ultimately go;\r\n     adopt the English five years' franchise--offer it voluntarily to\r\n     the Uitlanders--make them your friends, be a far-sighted statesman,\r\n     and you will have a majority of the Uitlanders with you when they\r\n     become Burghers. The answer I got was: 'We have done too much\r\n     already and cannot do more.'\"\r\n\r\nOne is aware of the fact that Mr. Krüger contended that the\r\n_non_-English Uitlanders would side with him. Sir Henry Villiers writes:\r\n\r\n     \"I have never been able to understand why Krüger never attempted to\r\n     take the Uitlanders into his confidence. He has always kept them at\r\n     arm's length with the result that he has entirely alienated them.\r\n     It is said that there are 21,000 Uitlanders in Johannesburg who\r\n     support him, and yet no meeting has been held at Johannesburg to\r\n     compare with the meetings held by his opponents.\r\n\r\n     \"Why should he not appoint as one of his nominees an Uitlander of\r\n     position, whose integrity and judgment he has confidence in? If\r\n     none such exists, it would only be a proof of his want of tact and\r\n     statesmanship in not rallying such people to his side.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Melius de Villiers who was in Bloemfontein, while paying due\r\nattention to his brother's warnings, wanted only to persuade Krüger to\r\nyield for the time being. Forwarding his brother's letter he wrote to\r\nMr. Fischer:\r\n\r\n     \"Please impress upon Oom Paul what I think is an important fact,\r\n     namely, that the present Ministry in England will not always last.\r\n\r\n     \"By giving way now, we do not do so in perpetuity; but I feel\r\n     assured a Liberal Ministry will be willing to reconsider the\r\n     relations of the South African Republic to England, and even to\r\n     revoke the Convention of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Africa for the Afrikander, from the Zambezi to Simon's Bay\" remained\r\nthe motto, only Mr. de Villiers looked to the future for its\r\nrealization. Yet Mr. Krüger sticks to his policy of deceit taking back\r\nwhat had been already granted.\r\n\r\nMr. de Villiers is down upon the summary and arrogant way with which\r\nreasonable offers have been rejected, and alluded to the despatch of the\r\n21st of August in which proposals made in the despatch of the 19th are\r\ndeclared to be subordinate to the abandonment of suzeranity rights and\r\nacceptance of the principle of arbitration for pending questions.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of September Mr. de Villiers appeals to Mr. Fischer for the\r\nlast time:--\r\n\r\n     \"Supposing a war does take place, is there any chance of the\r\n     Transvaal obtaining better terms when the war is over? The war will\r\n     not cease until the Transvaal is entirely subjugated. What will the\r\n     position of the Republics then be?\r\n\r\n     \"The very best friends of the Transvaal feel that the Bill\r\n     providing for the seven years' franchise is not a fair or workable\r\n     measure.\r\n\r\n     \"I am assuming, of course, that the proposals are such as can be\r\n     accepted without dishonour.\r\n\r\n     \"I confess I look with horror on a war to be fought by Afrikanders\r\n     to bolster up President Krüger's régime. I could understand a war\r\n     in defence of the South African Republic after it has made\r\n     reasonable concessions to the demands of the new-comers, and after\r\n     it has displayed the same desire to secure good government as is\r\n     seen in the Orange Free State; but of such a desire I have not seen\r\n     the faintest trace.\"\r\n\r\nHe alludes again to the doings of Dr. Reitz and Smuts:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have carefully read the latest correspondence, and I am by no\r\n     means satisfied that the British Resident was guilty of a breach of\r\n     faith. The utmost I would say is that there was a misunderstanding.\r\n     The dispatch of the 21st August seems to me to have been wholly\r\n     unnecessary, unless something happened between the 19th and 21st\r\n     which led the Transvaal Government to think they had yielded too\r\n     much. I have heard it said that between those dates a cablegram\r\n     from Dr. Leyds gave hopes of European intervention....\"\r\n\r\nDoes this telegram exist? It is indeed likely. At any rate the\r\nresponsibility of the war rests upon those who--be they diplomatists or\r\njournalists--have deluded Dr. Leyds to that extent. And the blood which\r\nis now shed is on the head of those who still try and persuade the Boers\r\nthat Russia, Germany, or France is going to interfere.\r\n\r\nIn _Le Siècle_ of the 3rd September, extracts from the \"Blue Book\" have\r\nbeen printed. We also find there letters from the 11th of March, 1898,\r\nup to the 8th of May, 1899, written by Mr. J.X. Merriman, the Cape\r\nTreasurer during the Schreiner Ministry. As he is one of the leaders of\r\nthe irreconcilable Afrikander group he cannot be suspected of undue\r\nsympathy towards England. In his first letter to Mr. Steyn a year before\r\nthe Uitlanders had petitioned for a redress, fourteen months before the\r\nBloemfontein Conference, eighteen months before the declaration of war,\r\nthe following passage is to be found:--\r\n\r\n     \"Yet one cannot conceal the fact that the greatest danger to the\r\n     future lies in the attitude of President Krüger and his vain hope\r\n     of building up a State on a foundation of a narrow unenlightened\r\n     minority, and his obstinate rejection of all prospect of using the\r\n     materials which lie ready to his hand to establish a true Republic\r\n     on a broad liberal basis. The report of recent discussions in the\r\n     Volksraad on his finances and their mismanagement fill one with\r\n     apprehension. Such a state of affairs cannot last, it must break\r\n     down from inherent rottenness, and it will be well if the fall does\r\n     not sweep away the freedom of all of us.\r\n\r\n     \"I write in no hostility to the Republics: my own feelings are all\r\n     in the opposite direction; but the foes of that form of government\r\n     are too often those of their own household. I am quite sure that\r\n     you have done what you can in modifying the attitude at Pretoria;\r\n     but I entreat you, for the welfare of South Africa, to persevere,\r\n     however unsatisfactory it may be to see your advice flouted and\r\n     your motives so cruelly misrepresented by a section of colonists.\r\n\r\n     \"Humanly speaking, the advice and good will of the Free State is\r\n     the only thing that stands between the South African Republic and a\r\n     catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to the Kotzé incident, the upshot of which was that Krüger and\r\nthe Volksraad claimed the right to overrun judicial decisions, he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     \"The radical fault is the utter incapacity of the body that affects\r\n     to issue its mandates to the Courts. In England it is a Parliament,\r\n     but then it represents the intelligence of the country, and in\r\n     Switzerland the same; in the Transvaal it is a narrow oligarchy.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated 1st January, 1899, President Krüger is depicted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"I had the opportunity the other day of a long talk, or rather\r\n     several talks, with Lippert about the Transvaal. He takes a very\r\n     sane view of matters there, and is very hopeless. He represents\r\n     Krüger--as others describe him--as more dogged and bigoted than\r\n     ever, and surrounded by a crew of self-seekers who prevent him from\r\n     seeing straight. He has no one to whom he turns for advice, and he\r\n     is so inflated as to have the crazy belief that he (Krüger) is born\r\n     to bring about peace between Germany and France!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merriman is confident that the Orange Free State will interfere (Mr.\r\nSteyn was alas, so blind as to fall in with Mr. Krüger's temper instead\r\nof smoothing it down), and says:\r\n\r\n     \"Is there no opportunity of bringing about a _rapprochement_\r\n     between us, in which the Free State might play the part of honest\r\n     broker?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Us_\" here means Cape Colony and Orange Free State.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of matters of general interest for South Africa, of\r\nuniform custom duties, etc., he ends by saying:\r\n\r\n     \"The deplorable confusion and maladministration of his financial\r\n     arrangements still continue, and are a standing menace to the peace\r\n     of South Africa. Yet, judging from the utterances of the leading\r\n     men from the Rand who come down here, a very moderate reform would\r\n     satisfy all except those who do not want to be satisfied, and, I\r\n     believe, there is very little sympathy for the mischievous\r\n     agitation that, rightly or wrongly, is attributed to the designs of\r\n     Rhodes and Beit.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May, 1899, on the eve of the Bloemfontein Conference, he\r\nwrites to Mr. Fischer, prompter and organiser of the Conference,\r\nforeseeing the results of the policy advocated by Dr. Leyds:\r\n\r\n     \" ... but there is, of course, an even worse prospect, namely, that\r\n     misrepresentation may goad Great Britain into a position where,\r\n     _with the concurrence and invitation of the other powers_, she\r\n     might feel obliged, even at the risk of enormous military outlay,\r\n     to cut the Gordian knot. You will probably say, as I certainly say,\r\n     'where is the _casus belli_,' and refuse to believe it possible to\r\n     imagine such a contingency. Unfortunately, you and I, who keep our\r\n     heads, must not ignore the fact that an immense number of people\r\n     seem to have lost theirs and are ready, without reflection or\r\n     examination, to accept the highly-coloured statements of a partisan\r\n     press.\"\r\n\r\nHe mentions the maladministration in the Transvaal several months before\r\nhe had written to Mr. Smuts, asking for detailed account of the money\r\ngranted by the Boer Government to Johannesburg but without getting an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n     \"Of course I know from previous correspondence that you and the\r\n     President are not disposed to minimize the blots on the\r\n     administration of the South African Republic, the weak points in\r\n     the Constitution, and the ignorance and laxity that prevails in\r\n     financial matters. To do so would be to fatally complicate the\r\n     situation.\r\n\r\n     \"I am sure that you will, and I most strongly urge you to use your\r\n     utmost influence to bear on President Krüger to concede some\r\n     colourable measure of reform, not so much in the interests of\r\n     outsiders as in those of his own State.\r\n\r\n     \"Granted that he does nothing. What is the future? His Boers, the\r\n     backbone of the country, are perishing off the land; hundreds have\r\n     become impoverished loafers, landless hangers-on of the town\r\n     population. In his own interests he should recruit his Republic\r\n     with new blood--and the sands are running out. I say this\r\n     irrespective of agitation about Uitlanders. The fabric will go to\r\n     pieces of its own accord unless something is done.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the opinion of Mr. Merriman, a friend of the Transvaal, yet\r\nevery day in Europe one is told that its misfortunes are due to the\r\nUitlanders.\r\n\r\nMr. Merriman thought on the contrary that it was necessary to ask them\r\nto come forward and help the State out of its ruinous course.\r\n\r\n     \"Surely it would be better to come forward now and earn the\r\n     gratitude of South Africa by a comprehensive and liberal measure\r\n     than to have the State torn and distracted by constant irritation\r\n     and bad blood. A moderate franchise reform and municipal privileges\r\n     would go far to satisfy any reasonable people, while a maintenance\r\n     of the oath ought to be a sufficient safeguard against the swamping\r\n     of the old population.\r\n\r\n     \"President Krüger should reflect that nine out of ten people that\r\n     receive the franchise will be supporters of the Republic in which\r\n     they will have an interest, and that he will, by granting liberal\r\n     reforms, disarm all opposition provoked.\r\n\r\n     \"Try and persuade President Krüger to confer a benefit on the whole\r\n     of South Africa by granting a broad measure of reform, and you will\r\n     have done the best day's work any statesman ever did in South\r\n     Africa.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months after the declaration of war, while the Boers' military\r\noperations were somehow successful he wrote to Mr. Piet de Wet also a\r\nmember of the Cape Parliament--\"it is hopeless....\"\r\n\r\n     \"If the Republics had not made the fatal mistake of sending the\r\n     ultimatum when they did, things would have gone differently; but it\r\n     is of no use going back on what might have been.\"\r\n\r\nHis letter had no effect upon Mr. de Wet, who now is under trial for\r\nhigh treason along with three other Members of the House.\r\n\r\nThere are other letters, among them one written by Mr. Te Water, who\r\nleft the Schreiner Ministry. In a speech delivered at Graaff-Reinet some\r\ntime ago he has declared that the Cape Government ought not to have\r\nallowed the railway lines to be used by English troops. Yet in a letter\r\nto President Steyn on the 8th of May, 1899, he asked him to put pressure\r\nupon \"our friends in Pretoria\" to adopt conciliatory measures. Alluding\r\nto the impending Conference he writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"In your position you as go-between can do endless good towards\r\n     arriving at an understanding at such Conference. I know well that\r\n     there is a party who will do everything possible to prevent this.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless he also is in favour of the policy advocated by Mr. Melius\r\nde Villiers:--\r\n\r\n     \"We must now play to win time. Governments are not perpetual. It is\r\n     honestly now the time to yield a little, however one may later\r\n     again tighten the rope.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows how this former Minister at the Cape meant to abide by\r\nConventions. How Mr. Krüger did abide by the Conventions of 1881 and\r\n1884 is a well-known fact. No wonder if England was suspicious of the\r\n\"ridiculous proposals,\" to use Mr. de Villiers' phrase, offered by\r\nPresident Krüger. The letters written by Mr. Te Water and Mr. Melius de\r\nVilliers show that there was good reason for suspicion. These letters\r\nshow also what responsibility has been assumed by the members of the\r\nLiberal party who sided so eagerly with Mr. Krüger and by those who,\r\nlike Mr. Stead, backed at first Mr. Rhodes' policy with all their might\r\n(so Mr. Clark wrote to General Joubert, Mr. Krüger, and President\r\nSteyn) and were blind enough to imagine that their party was strong\r\nenough to elbow out the Government and revert to Mr. Gladstone's policy\r\nafter Majuba. Had they been more far-sighted they would have recognised\r\nthat the Transvaal had since 1881 condemned itself, and that no\r\nMinistry, be it Liberal or Conservative, could follow again in the steps\r\nof Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince President Krüger has left the Transvaal, and Botha is negotiating\r\nfor a surrender, the pacification of the Transvaal needs no more war\r\noperation, it has become a mere question of police arrangements.\r\nNevertheless Dr. Leyds is still as active as ever. He reminds us of the\r\nSpanish Ministers who when they got the news that the Spanish fleet had\r\nbeen annihilated by Dewey, manufactured forthwith a report to the effect\r\nthat Americans had suffered a defeat at the hands of the Spaniards. _Le\r\nPetit Bleu_ does the same. The announcement--English troops\r\nretreating--appeared in a marginal note the very day that Lydenburg was\r\ntaken. On Tuesday, 11th September, _L'Eclair_ made the following\r\nannouncement: \"London, 10th September, Prince Henry sails back to\r\nGermany. From well-informed quarters I learn that the main object of the\r\nGerman Emperor's brother's visit was to discuss the ways and means of\r\npreserving Transvaal independence.\"\r\n\r\nEight days previous to this Dr. Leyds had tried to make the world\r\nbelieve that he had come to an understanding with the Czar. In both\r\ncases the object aimed at was obvious. Yet though the Dreyfus affair\r\nhas taught me the all-powerful and far-reaching influence of a lie, I\r\nconfess that Dr. Leyds is a puzzle to me.\r\n\r\nBut his work is at an end now. He may have succeeded cleverly in\r\ndeceiving Krüger and Steyn what the European Powers really meant to do,\r\nor in giving those same Powers garbled accounts of the state of affairs\r\nin the Transvaal, and the true bearings of the Bloemfontein negotiation,\r\nyet the fact remains that it is mainly through him that the South\r\nAfrican Republics have lost their independence. He could not like Mr.\r\nKrüger, excuse himself upon being led astray by blind and ignorant\r\npatriotism. He knew well enough how far the very help he depicted as\r\nforthcoming could be depended upon, he knew that England was bound to\r\nwin in the long run, but there was only one thing which he cared for; to\r\nmake people in Europe believe that he had an important part to play in\r\nthe political arena. The war came as a welcome diversion to an endurable\r\nposition. And now that his country's interests have been entirely\r\nsacrificed to his own, he may look upon his work with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSVAAL AND THE PEACE CONFERENCE HELD IN PARIS FROM SEPTEMBER\r\n30TH TO OCTOBER 5TH, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nSITTING OF OCTOBER 1ST.\r\n\r\nIn the English section of the Peace Conference the most prominent\r\nmembers of which were Dr. Clarke, Mr. Moscheles and Mr. Alexander, the\r\nfollowing resolutions had been unanimously adopted to be proposed at the\r\nPeace Conference:\r\n\r\n     \"That according to the report sent by the Berne International\r\n     Bureau it has come to the knowledge of the International Peace\r\n     Congress, that:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) \"The British Government steadily opposed various attempts\r\n     made with the object to submit the South African difficulties to\r\n     arbitration.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) \"Arbitration was eagerly accepted by the South African\r\n     Republics, who had repeatedly asked for it, therefore, the\r\n     International Peace Congress feels compelled to arrive at the\r\n     following conclusions:\r\n\r\n     1st. \"Of the two opponents the one who declined arbitration,\r\n     _i.e._, the British Government is responsible for the war in South\r\n     Africa.\r\n\r\n     2nd. \"As long as arbitration can possibly be resorted to the appeal\r\n     to arms is tantamount to being guilty of a crime against\r\n     civilisation and humanity; therefore,\r\n\r\n     3rd. \"The application of brutal force by Great Britain so as to end\r\n     their quarrel with the South African Republics deserves an\r\n     everlasting blame for what must be considered as an outrage\r\n     against human conscience, and a betrayal of the cause of progress\r\n     and humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThen a lengthy discussion arose, in the course of which M. Yves Guyot\r\nquoted facts in contradiction to the assertions which the proposed\r\nresolution contained.\r\n\r\nThat resolution was passed in principle by the Congress Commission of\r\nActuality, with the proviso that some words should be left out as being\r\ntoo offensive.\r\n\r\nFor instance the words: _an outrage_ or a _reprehensible attempt_\r\nagainst the right of nations should be substituted for _a crime_ against\r\ncivilisation. The former version was adopted and submitted to the\r\nCongress by the Commission, whilst soliciting its opinion on the text of\r\nthe proposition and of its bearings. After the English delegates had\r\nexposed their views, M. Yves Guyot rose and said that he considered it\r\nhis duty, as a member of the Congress Committee of Patronage, not only\r\nto find fault with the proposals of the Commission in their details,\r\n_but to object also to the spirit as well as to the letter of the\r\nresolution_.\r\n\r\n     \"Looking at actual facts\", said Mr. Yves Guyot, \"it was not true\r\n     that arbitration had been accepted by the Governments of the South\r\n     African Republics. The acceptance, if any, had been hedged in by\r\n     all sorts of restrictions, for instance, in making it conditional\r\n     that England should drop the suzerainty, a condition which Her\r\n     British Majesty's Government could not accept. True, arbitration\r\n     was mentioned. But arbitration of what kind? about what? Could\r\n     England recognise the right which the Boers had given themselves,\r\n     to violate over and over again the Conventions of 1881 and 1884?\r\n\r\n     \"Really it was astounding to see such an amount of sympathy wasted\r\n     on people who had constantly set at naught Art. 14 of the 1884\r\n     Convention with respect to the Uitlanders, who had come and\r\n     brought them civilisation, energy and wealth.\r\n\r\n     \"A retrospect history of the Boers would quickly show that their\r\n     hatred of the English was in the first place due to the protection\r\n     which the latter had given to the natives. It is clearly apparent\r\n     from documents dealing with the Bloemfontein Conference, that when\r\n     Mr. Krüger brought forward the arbitration question he merely meant\r\n     to throw dust into the public's eyes. Now he (M. Yves Guyot)\r\n     considered it to the interest of the Congress to point out that its\r\n     members, generous-minded as they were, were irresponsible people.\r\n     What authority did they attribute to resolutions, blame and\r\n     reproach, addressed to governments who are themselves responsible\r\n     for the destinies of their countries?\r\n\r\n     \"Their resolution might be couched in words as strong as they\r\n     liked, but what effective sanction could they give it? Was it not\r\n     to be feared rather that by its very violence their language might\r\n     fan the flames, or rake the embers of new conflicts instead of\r\n     making its peaceful influence felt?\"\r\n\r\nM. Guyot's speech was listened to with silent and earnest attention,\r\nthough now and then objections were heard.\r\n\r\nThen after Dr. Clark, Mr. Frederic Passy, Mr. Moscheles and Mr. Arnaud\r\nhad made their observations the final decision was put off till the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of October the Russian delegate, Mr. Nevicow, read the text\r\nof the resolution as it had been amended by the commission:\r\n\r\n_Motion of the Commission._\r\n\r\n\"The Ninth International Peace Congress after hearing the report on the\r\nevents of the year sent by the Berne Bureau, though without pretending\r\nto assume the right to pass judgment on the policy of a friendly nation\r\nunless it should be to affirm publicly the everlasting principles of\r\ninternational justice, declares that:\r\n\r\n     1st. \"The responsibility of the war which is now devastating South\r\n     Africa lies with the Government which refused several times to\r\n     countenance arbitration, that is with the British Government.\r\n\r\n     2nd. \"The English Government by ignoring the principles of right\r\n     and justice, which have been the glory of the great British nation,\r\n     _i.e._, by refusing to arbitrate and indulging in threats which\r\n     were bound fatally to lead to war, whereas the difficulties might\r\n     have been solved by judicial means, has committed an outrage\r\n     against the rights of nations, of such a nature as to check the\r\n     pacific evolutions of humanity.\r\n\r\n     3rd. \"The Congress equally regrets that, the majority of the\r\n     Governments represented at the Hague Conference, had not taken any\r\n     steps to assure the respect of resolutions which were to them an\r\n     undertaking of honour.\r\n\r\n     4th. \"The Congress considers that it is advisable to appeal to\r\n     public opinion as regards the Transvaal.\r\n\r\n     5th. \"The Congress expresses its profound sympathy and admiration\r\n     to the English members of the Congress for the manliness of their\r\n     declarations, and it hopes that under similar circumstances their\r\n     example will be followed by other nations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jaffe, of London, alluding to public opinion in England, said that\r\narbitration could only be resorted to by sovereign powers, that the\r\nTransvaal was not a sovereign power, and also that any judgment arrived\r\nat by arbitration on the various points in dispute between England and\r\nthe Transvaal, would have been difficult to execute. Mr. Jaffe referred\r\nto the approval, almost unanimous, with which the war was looked upon\r\nin England and her Colonies; it had provoked great enthusiasm, and it\r\nwould be a mistake to hurt the feelings of a whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe wording of the resolution as proposed by the Commission was adopted\r\nby all the members but one.\r\n\r\nMr. Lafontaine, Belgium, proposed to add another resolution which ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The congress hopes that the crime or to use the corrected phrase,\r\n     the error of depriving the South African Republics of their\r\n     existence and independence will not be committed definitely; it\r\n     makes an earnest appeal to civilised governments to intervene as\r\n     mediators in favour of the two Republics.\"\r\n\r\nAfter various observations had been made by Mr. Giretti (Italy), Hodgson\r\nPratt, Frederic Passy and Moscheles (the English delegates) the\r\nproposition was rejected by 170 votes against 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n         LONDON:\r\nBOYLE, SON & WATCHURST,\r\n        PRINTERS,\r\n    WARWICK SQUARE, E.C.",
