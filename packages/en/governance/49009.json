The elegant solitude of this place,\r\nand the greatest pleasures of it, I owe to its being so near those\r\nbeautiful manors wherein you sometimes reside: it is not retiring from\r\nthe world, but enjoying its most valuable blessings, when a man is\r\npermitted to share in your Lordship's conversations in the country.\r\nAll the bright images which the wits of past ages have left behind\r\nthem in their writings, the noble plans which the greatest statesmen\r\nhave laid down for administration of affairs, are equally the familiar\r\nobjects of your knowledge. But what is peculiar to your Lordship above\r\nall the illustrious personages that have appeared in any age, is, that\r\nwit and learning have from your example fallen into a new era. Your\r\npatronage has produced those arts, which before shunned the commerce\r\nof the world, into the service of life; and it is to you we owe, that\r\nthe man of wit has turned himself to be a man of business. The false\r\ndelicacy of men of genius, and the objections which others were apt\r\nto insinuate against their abilities for entering into affairs, have\r\nequally vanished. And experience has shown, that men of letters are not\r\nonly qualified with a greater capacity, but also a greater integrity\r\nin the despatch of business. Your own studies have been diverted from\r\nbeing the highest ornament, to the highest use to mankind, and the\r\ncapacities which would have rendered you the greatest poet of your\r\nage, have to the advantage of Great Britain been employed in pursuits\r\nwhich have made you the most able and unbiassed patriot. A vigorous\r\nimagination, an extensive apprehension, and a ready judgment have\r\ndistinguished you in all the illustrious parts of administration, in\r\na reign attended with such difficulties, that the same talents without\r\nthe same quickness in the possession of them would have been incapable\r\nof conquering. The natural success of such abilities has advanced\r\nyou to a seat in that illustrious House where you were received by a\r\ncrowd of your relations. Great as you are in your honours and personal\r\nqualities, I know you will forgive a humble neighbour the vanity of\r\npretending to a place in your friendship, and subscribing himself,\r\n\r\n  My Lord,\r\n          Your Lordship's most obliged\r\n                    and most devoted Servant,\r\n                                         RICHARD STEELE.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Charles Montague, grandson of the first Earl of Manchester, was\r\nborn in 1661, at Horton, in Northamptonshire, and was educated at\r\nWestminster, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1687 he joined\r\nwith Prior in writing the \"County and the City Mouse,\" a burlesque on\r\nDryden's \"Hind and Panther.\" Montague was amongst those who signed\r\nthe invitation sent to William of Orange. After the Revolution, he\r\nwas made a Lord of the Treasury (March 1692), Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer (1694), and First Lord of the Treasury in 1698. These last\r\ntwo offices he held together until 1699. Among the important schemes\r\nwhich he carried out were a re-coining of the money, the founding of\r\nthe Bank of England and the new East India Company, and the issue of\r\nExchequer bills. In 1700 he was made Auditor of the Exchequer, and was\r\ncreated Baron Halifax. A Tory House of Commons twice attacked him, but\r\nwithout success. In 1706 he took a leading part in the negotiations\r\nwhich led to the Union with Scotland. He voted for the sentence upon\r\nDr. Sacheverell in 1710, and in the subsequent peace negotiations he\r\nopposed the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht. In October 1714 he again\r\nbecame First Lord of the Treasury, and was created Viscount Sunbury and\r\nEarl of Halifax; but he died in May 1715. He was the patron of numerous\r\nmen of letters, and was lauded by many as a second Mæcenas. Pope says\r\nhe was \"fed with soft dedication all day long.\" In 1711 Steele and\r\nAddison dedicated the second volume of the _Spectator_ to Lord Halifax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TATLER\r\n\r\nBY ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                =No. 194.=                   [STEELE.[2]\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, July 4_, to _Thursday, July 6, 1710_.\r\n\r\n              Militat omnis amans.--OVID, Amor. El. ix. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, July 5._\r\n\r\nI was this morning reading the tenth canto in the fourth book of\r\nSpenser, in which Sir Scudamore relates the progress of his courtship\r\nto Amoret under a very beautiful allegory, which is one of the most\r\nnatural and unmixed of any in that most excellent author. I shall\r\ntransprose it, to use Mr. Bayes's term,[3] for the benefit of many\r\nEnglish lovers who have by frequent letters desired me to lay down some\r\nrules for the conduct of their virtuous amours; and shall only premise,\r\nthat by the shield of love is meant a generous, constant passion for\r\nthe person beloved.\r\n\r\nWhen the fame, says he, of this celebrated beauty first flew abroad, I\r\nwent in pursuit of her to the Temple of Love. This temple, continues\r\nhe, bore the name of the goddess Venus, and was seated in a most\r\nfruitful island, walled by nature against all invaders. There was\r\na single bridge that led into the island, and before it a castle\r\ngarrisoned by twenty knights. Near the castle was an open plain, and\r\nin the midst of it a pillar, on which was hung the shield of love; and\r\nunderneath it, in letters of gold, was this inscription:\r\n\r\n    _Happy the man who well can use his bliss;\r\n    Whose ever be the shield, fair Amoret be his._\r\n\r\nMy heart panted upon reading the inscription: I struck upon the shield\r\nwith my spear. Immediately issued forth a knight well mounted, and\r\ncompletely armed, who, without speaking, ran fiercely at me. I received\r\nhim as well as I could, and by good fortune threw him out of the\r\nsaddle. I encountered the whole twenty successively, and leaving them\r\nall extended on the plain, carried off the shield in token of victory.\r\nHaving thus vanquished my rivals, I passed on without impediment, till\r\nI came to the outermost gate of the bridge, which I found locked and\r\nbarred. I knocked and called, but could get no answer. At last I saw\r\none on the other side of the gate, who stood peeping through a small\r\ncrevice. This was the porter; he had a double face resembling a Janus,\r\nand was continually looking about him, as if he mistrusted some sudden\r\ndanger. His name, as I afterwards learned, was Doubt. Over against him\r\nsat Delay, who entertained passengers with some idle story, while they\r\nlost such opportunities as were never to be recovered. As soon as the\r\nporter saw my shield, he opened the gate; but upon my entering, Delay\r\ncaught hold of me, and would fain have made me listen to her fooleries.\r\nHowever, I shook her off, and passed forward till I came to the second\r\ngate, the Gate of Good Desert, which always stood wide open; but in\r\nthe porch was a hideous giant, that stopped the entrance: his name\r\nwas Danger. Many warriors of good reputation, not able to bear the\r\nsternness of his look, went back again. Cowards fled at the first sight\r\nof him, except some few, who watching their opportunity, slipped by\r\nhim unobserved. I prepared to assault him; but upon the first sight of\r\nmy shield, he immediately gave way. Looking back upon him, I found his\r\nhinder parts much more deformed and terrible than his face; Hatred,\r\nMurder, Treason, Envy, and Detraction lying in ambush behind him, to\r\nfall upon the heedless and unwary.\r\n\r\nI now entered the Island of Love, which appeared in all the beauties\r\nof art and nature, and feasted every sense with the most agreeable\r\nobjects. Amidst a pleasing variety of walks and alleys, shady seats and\r\nflowery banks, sunny hills and gloomy valleys, were thousands of lovers\r\nsitting, or walking together in pairs, and singing hymns to the deity\r\nof the place.\r\n\r\nI could not forbear envying this happy people, who were already in\r\npossession of all they could desire. While I went forward to the\r\ntemple, the structure was beautiful beyond imagination. The gate stood\r\nopen. In the entrance sat a most amiable woman, whose name was Concord.\r\n\r\nOn either side of her stood two young men, both strongly armed, as if\r\nafraid of each other. As I afterwards learned, they were both her sons,\r\nbut begotten of her by two different fathers; their names, Love and\r\nHatred.\r\n\r\nThe lady so well tempered and reconciled them both, that she forced\r\nthem to join hands; though I could not but observe, that Hatred turned\r\naside his face, as not able to endure the sight of his younger brother.\r\n\r\nI at length entered the inmost temple, the roof of which was raised\r\nupon a hundred marble pillars, decked with crowns, chains, and\r\ngarlands. The ground was strewn with flowers. A hundred altars, at each\r\nof which stood a virgin priestess clothed in white, blazed all at once\r\nwith the sacrifice of lovers, who were perpetually sending up their\r\nvows to heaven in clouds of incense.\r\n\r\nIn the midst stood the goddess herself, upon an altar, whose substance\r\nwas neither gold nor stone, but infinitely more precious than either.\r\nAbout her neck flew numberless flocks of little Loves, Joys, and\r\nGraces; and all about her altar lay scattered heaps of lovers,\r\ncomplaining of the disdain, pride, or treachery of their mistresses.\r\nOne among the rest, no longer able to contain his grief, broke out into\r\nthe following prayer: \"Venus, queen of grace and beauty, joy of gods\r\nand men, who with a smile becalmest the seas, and renewest all nature;\r\ngoddess, whom all the different species in the universe obey with joy\r\nand pleasure, grant I may at last obtain the object of my vows.\"\r\n\r\nThe impatient lover pronounced this with great vehemence; but I in a\r\nsoft murmur besought the goddess to lend me her assistance. While I was\r\nthus praying, I chanced to cast my eye on a company of ladies, who were\r\nassembled together in a corner of the temple waiting for the anthem.\r\n\r\nThe foremost seemed something elder and of a more composed countenance\r\nthan the rest, who all appeared to be under her direction. Her name\r\nwas Womanhood. On one side of her sat Shamefacedness, with blushes\r\nrising in her cheeks, and her eyes fixed upon the ground: on the other\r\nwas Cheerfulness, with a smiling look, that infused a secret pleasure\r\ninto the hearts of all that saw her. With these sat Modesty, holding\r\nher hand on her heart; Courtesy, with a graceful aspect, and obliging\r\nbehaviour; and the two sisters, who were always linked together, and\r\nresembled each other, Silence and Obedience.\r\n\r\n    _Thus sat they all around in seemly rate,\r\n    And in the midst of them a goodly maid\r\n    Even in the lap of Womanhood there sat,\r\n    The which was all in lily-white arrayed,\r\n    Where silver streams among the linen strayed;\r\n    Like to the morn, when first her shining face\r\n    Hath to the gloomy world itself bewrayed.\r\n    That same was fairest Amoret in place,\r\n    Shining with beauty's light, and heavenly virtue's grace._\r\n\r\nAs soon as I beheld the charming Amoret, my heart throbbed with hopes.\r\nI stepped to her, and seized her hand; when Womanhood immediately\r\nrising up, sharply rebuked me for offering in so rude a manner to lay\r\nhold on a virgin. I excused myself as modestly as I could, and at\r\nthe same time displayed my shield; upon which, as soon as she beheld\r\nthe god emblazoned with his bow and shafts, she was struck mute, and\r\ninstantly retired.\r\n\r\nI still held fast the fair Amoret, and turning my eyes towards the\r\ngoddess of the place, saw that she favoured my pretensions with a\r\nsmile, which so emboldened me, that I carried off my prize.\r\n\r\nThe maid, sometimes with tears, sometimes with smiles, entreated me to\r\nlet her go: but I led her through the temple-gate, where the goddess\r\nConcord, who had favoured my entrance, befriended my retreat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis allegory is so natural, that it explains itself. The persons in it\r\nare very artfully described, and disposed in proper places. The posts\r\nassigned to Doubt, Delay, and Danger, are admirable. The Gate of Good\r\nDesert has something noble and instructive in it. But above all, I am\r\nmost pleased with the beautiful group of figures in the corner of the\r\ntemple. Among these, Womanhood is drawn like what the philosophers call\r\na universal nature, and is attended with beautiful representatives of\r\nall those virtues that are the ornaments of the female sex, considered\r\nin its natural perfection and innocence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] This paper may be by John Hughes, who published an edition of\r\nSpenser in 1715.\r\n\r\n[3] In the \"Rehearsal,\" Act I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 195.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Thursday, July 6_, to _Saturday, July 8, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grecian Coffee-house, July 7._\r\n\r\nThe learned world are very much offended at many of my ratiocinations,\r\nand have but a very mean opinion of me as a politician. The reason\r\nof this is, that some erroneously conceive a talent for politics to\r\nconsist in the regard to a man's own interest; but I am of quite\r\nanother mind, and think the first and essential quality towards being a\r\nstatesman is to have a public spirit. One of the gentlemen who are out\r\nof humour with me, imputes my falling into a way wherein I am so very\r\nawkward to a barrenness of invention, and has the charity to lay new\r\nmatter before me for the future. He is at the bottom my friend, but is\r\nat a loss to know whether I am a fool or a physician, and is pleased\r\nto expostulate with me with relation to the latter. He falls heavy\r\nupon licentiates, and seems to point more particularly at us who are\r\nnot regularly of the faculty. But since he has been so civil to me as\r\nto meddle only with those who are employed no further than about men's\r\nlives, and not reflected upon me as of the astrological sect, who\r\nconcern ourselves about lives and fortunes also, I am not so much hurt\r\nas to stifle any part of his fond letter.[4]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid there is something in the suspicions of some people, that\r\nyou begin to be short of matter for your Lucubrations. Though several\r\nof them now and then did appear somewhat dull and insipid to me, I was\r\nalways charitably inclined to believe the fault lay in myself, and that\r\nI wanted the true key to uncipher your mysteries, and remember your\r\nadvertisement upon this account. But since I have seen you fall in an\r\nunpardonable error, yea, with a relapse: I mean, since I have seen you\r\nturn politician in the present unhappy dissensions, I have begun to\r\nstagger, and could not choose but lessen the great value I had for the\r\ncensor of our isle. How is it possible that a man, whom interest did\r\nnaturally lead to a constant impartiality in these matters, and who\r\nhath wit enough to judge that his opinion was not like to make many\r\nproselytes; how is it possible, I say, that a little passion (for I\r\nhave still too good an opinion of you to think you was bribed by the\r\nstaggering party) could blind you so far as to offend the very better\r\nhalf of the nation, and to lessen off so much the number of your\r\nfriends? Mr. Morphew will not have cause to thank you, unless you give\r\nover, and endeavour to regain what you have lost. There is still a\r\ngreat many themes you have left untouched; such as the ill-managements\r\nof matters relating to law and physic, the setting down rules for\r\nknowing the quacks in both professions. What a large field is there\r\nleft in discovering the abuses of the College, who had a charter and\r\nprivileges granted them to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of\r\nquacks and pretenders; and yet grant licences to barbers, and write\r\nletters of recommendation in the country towns, out of the reach of\r\ntheir practice, in favour of mere boys; valuing the health and lives of\r\ntheir countrymen no further than they get money by them. You have said\r\nvery little or nothing about the dispensation of justice in town and\r\ncountry, where clerks are the counsellors to their masters.\r\n\r\n\"But as I can't expect that the censor of Great Britain should publish\r\na letter, wherein he is censured with too much reason himself; yet I\r\nhope you will be the better for it, and think upon the themes I have\r\nmentioned, which must certainly be of greater service to the world,\r\nyourself, and Mr. Morphew, than to let us know whether you are a Whig\r\nor a Tory. I am still\r\n\r\n  \"Your Admirer and Servant,\r\n                \"CATO JUNIOR.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis gentleman and I differ about the words \"staggering\" and \"better\r\npart\"; but instead of answering to the particulars of this epistle, I\r\nshall only acquaint my correspondent, that I am at present forming my\r\nthoughts upon the foundation of Sir Scudamore's progress in Spenser,[5]\r\nwhich has led me from all other amusements, to consider the state of\r\nlove in this island; and from the corruptions in the government of\r\nthat, to deduce the chief evils of life. In the meantime that I am thus\r\nemployed, I have given positive orders to Don Saltero,[6] of Chelsea,\r\nthe tooth-drawer, and Dr. Thomas Smith,[7] the corn-cutter, of King\r\nStreet, Westminster (who have the modesty to confine their pretensions\r\nto manual operations), to bring me in, with all convenient speed,\r\ncomplete lists of all who are but of equal learning with themselves,\r\nand yet administer physic beyond the feet and gums. These advices I\r\nshall reserve for my future leisure; but have now taken a resolution\r\nto dedicate the remaining part of this instant July to the service\r\nof the fair sex, and have almost finished a scheme for settling the\r\nwhole remainder of that sex who are unmarried, and above the age of\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nIn order to this good and public service, I shall consider the passion\r\nof love in its full extent, as it is attended both with joys and\r\ninquietudes; and lay down, for the conduct of my lovers, such rules as\r\nshall banish the cares, and heighten the pleasures, which flow from\r\nthat amiable spring of life and happiness. There is no less than an\r\nabsolute necessity that some provision be made to take off the dead\r\nstock of women in city, town, and country. Let there happen but the\r\nleast disorder in the streets, and in an instant you see the inequality\r\nof the numbers of males and females. Besides that the feminine crowd on\r\nsuch occasions is more numerous in the open way, you may observe them\r\nalso to the very garrets huddled together, four at least at a casement.\r\nAdd to this, that by an exact calculation of all that have come to town\r\nby stage-coach or waggon for this twelvemonth last, three times in four\r\nthe treated persons have been males. This over-stock of beauty, for\r\nwhich there are so few bidders, calls for an immediate supply of lovers\r\nand husbands; and I am the studious knight-errant who have suffered\r\nlong nocturnal contemplations to find out methods for the relief of\r\nall British females who at present seem to be devoted to involuntary\r\nvirginity. The scheme upon which I design to act, I have communicated\r\nto none but a beauteous young lady (who has for some time left the\r\ntown), in the following letter:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"To AMANDA, in Kent.\r\n\r\n  \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"I send with this, my discourse of ways and means for encouraging\r\nmarriage, and repeopling the island. You will soon observe, that\r\naccording to these rules, the mean considerations (which make beauty\r\nand merit cease to be the objects of love and courtship) will be fully\r\nexploded. I have unanswerably proved, that jointures and settlements\r\nare the bane of happiness; and not only so, but the ruin even of their\r\nfortunes who enter into them. I beg of you, therefore, to come to\r\ntown upon the receipt of this, where I promise you, you shall have as\r\nmany lovers as toasters; for there needed nothing but to make men's\r\ninterests fall in with their inclinations, to render you the most\r\ncourted of your sex. As many as love you will now be willing to marry\r\nyou: hasten then, and be the honourable mistress of mankind. Cassander,\r\nand many others, stand in the Gate of Good Desert[8] to receive you.

He sighed, and ended\r\nhis discourse by saying, \"You, Mr. Censor, some time ago, gave us your\r\nthoughts of the behaviour of great men to their creditors. This sort\r\nof demand upon them, for what they invite men to expect, is a debt of\r\nhonour, which, according to custom, they ought to be most careful of\r\npaying, and would be a very worthy subject for a lucubration.\"\r\n\r\nOf all men living, I think, I am the most proper to treat of this\r\nmatter; because in the character and employment of censor, I have had\r\nencouragement so infinitely above my desert, that what I say cannot\r\npossibly be supposed to arise from peevishness, or any disappointment\r\nin that kind which I myself have met with. When we consider patrons\r\nand their clients, those who receive addresses, and those who are\r\naddressed to, it must not be understood that the dependants are such as\r\nare worthless in their natures, abandoned to any vice or dishonour,\r\nor such as without a call thrust themselves upon men in power; nor\r\nwhen we say patrons, do we mean such as have it not in their power,\r\nor have no obligation, to assist their friends; but we speak of such\r\nleagues where there are power and obligation on the one part, and merit\r\nand expectation on the other. Were we to be very particular on this\r\nsubject, I take it that the division of patron and client may include a\r\nthird part of our nation. The want of merit and real worth will strike\r\nout about ninety-nine in the hundred of these, and want of ability in\r\nthe patron will dispose of as many of that order. He who out of mere\r\nvanity to be applied to will take up another's time and fortune in his\r\nservice, where he has no prospect of returning it, is as much more\r\nunjust as those who took up my friend the upholder's[9] goods without\r\npaying him for them. I say, he is as much more unjust as our life and\r\ntime is more valuable than our goods and movables. Among many whom you\r\nsee about the great, there is a contented, well-pleased set, who seem\r\nto like the attendance for its own sake, and are early at the abodes\r\nof the powerful, out of mere fashion. This sort of vanity is as well\r\ngrounded as if a man should lay aside his own plain suit, and dress\r\nhimself up in a gay livery of another's.\r\n\r\nThere are many of this species who exclude others of just expectation,\r\nand make those proper dependants appear impatient, because they are\r\nnot so cheerful as those who expect nothing. I have made use of the\r\npenny post for the instruction of these voluntary slaves, and informed\r\nthem, that they will never be provided for; but they double their\r\ndiligence upon admonition. Will Afterday has told his friends, that he\r\nwas to have the next thing these ten years; and Harry Linger has been\r\nfourteen within a month of a considerable office. However the fantastic\r\ncomplaisance which is paid to them may blind the great from seeing\r\nthemselves in a just light, they must needs (if they in the least\r\nreflect) at some times have a sense of the injustice they do in raising\r\nin others a false expectation. But this is so common a practice in all\r\nthe stages of power, that there are not more cripples come out of the\r\nwars than from the attendance of patrons. You see in one a settled\r\nmelancholy, in another a bridled rage, a third has lost his memory,\r\nand a fourth his whole constitution and humour. In a word, when you\r\nsee a particular cast of mind or body, which looks a little upon the\r\ndistracted, you may be sure the poor gentleman has formerly had great\r\nfriends. For this reason, I have thought it a prudent thing to take a\r\nnephew of mine out of a lady's service, where he was a page, and have\r\nbound him to a shoemaker.\r\n\r\nBut what of all the humours under the sun is the most pleasant\r\nto consider, is, that you see some men lay as it were a set of\r\nacquaintance by them, to converse with when they are out of employment,\r\nwho had no effect of their power when they were in. Here patrons and\r\nclients both make the most fantastical figure imaginable. Friendship\r\nindeed is most manifested in adversity; but I do not know how to behave\r\nmyself to a man who thinks me his friend at no other time but that.\r\nDick Reptile of our club had this in his head the other night, when\r\nhe said, \"I am afraid of ill news when I am visited by any of my old\r\nfriends.\" These patrons are a little like some fine gentlemen, who\r\nspend all their hours of gaiety with their wenches, but when they fall\r\nsick, will let no one come near them but their wives. It seems, truth\r\nand honour are companions too sober for prosperity. It is certainly\r\nthe most black ingratitude to accept of a man's best endeavours to be\r\npleasing to you, and return it with indifference.\r\n\r\nI am so much of this mind, that Dick Estcourt[10] the comedian, for\r\ncoming one night to our club, though he laughed at us all the time he\r\nwas there, shall have our company at his play on Thursday. A man of\r\ntalents is to be favoured, or never admitted. Let the ordinary world\r\ntruck for money and wares, but men of spirit and conversation should\r\nin every kind do others as much pleasure as they receive from them.\r\nBut men are so taken up with outward forms, that they do not consider\r\ntheir actions; else how should it be, that a man shall deny that to\r\nthe entreaties and almost tears of an old friend, which he shall\r\nsolicit a new one to accept of? I remember, when I first came out of\r\nStaffordshire, I had an intimacy with a man of quality, in whose gift\r\nthere fell a very good employment. All the town cried, \"There's a\r\nthing for Mr. Bickerstaff!\" when, to my great astonishment, I found my\r\npatron had been forced upon twenty artifices to surprise a man with it\r\nwho never thought of it. But sure it is a degree of murder to amuse\r\nmen with vain hopes. If a man takes away another's life, where is the\r\ndifference, whether he does it by taking away the minutes of his time,\r\nor the drops of his blood? But indeed, such as have hearts barren of\r\nkindness are served accordingly by those whom they employ, and pass\r\ntheir lives away with an empty show of civility for love, and an\r\ninsipid intercourse of a commerce in which their affections are no way\r\nconcerned. But on the other side, how beautiful is the life of a patron\r\nwho performs his duty to his inferiors? a worthy merchant who employs\r\na crowd of artificers? a great lord who is generous and merciful to\r\nthe several necessities of his tenants? a courtier who uses his credit\r\nand power for the welfare of his friends? These have in their several\r\nstations a quick relish of the exquisite pleasure of doing good. In a\r\nword, good patrons are like the guardian angels of Plato, who are ever\r\nbusy, though unseen, in the care of their wards; but ill patrons are\r\nlike the deities of Epicurus, supine, indolent, and unconcerned, though\r\nthey see mortals in storms and tempests even while they are offering\r\nincense to their power.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] See No. 180.\r\n\r\n[10] See Nos. 51 and 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 197.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, July 11_, to _Thursday, July 13, 1710_.\r\n\r\n              Semper ego auditor tantum?--JUV., Sat. i. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grecian Coffee-house, July 12._\r\n\r\nWhen I came hither this evening, the man of the house delivered me a\r\nbook very finely bound. When I received it, I overheard one of the boys\r\nwhisper another, and say, \"It was a fine thing to be a great scholar!\r\nWhat a pretty book that is!\" It has indeed a very gay outside, and is\r\ndedicated to me by a very ingenious gentleman, who does not put his\r\nname to it. The title of it (for the work is in Latin) is, \"Epistolarum\r\nObscurorum Virorum, ad Dm. M. Ortuinum Gratium, Volumina II. &c.\"[11]\r\n(\"The Epistles of the Obscure Writers to Ortuinus, &c.\"). The purpose\r\nof the work is signified in the dedication, in very elegant language,\r\nand fine raillery. It seems this is a collection of letters which\r\nsome profound blockheads, who lived before our times, have written in\r\nhonour of each other, and for their mutual information in each other's\r\nabsurdities. They are mostly of the German nation, whence from time\r\nto time inundations of writers have flowed, more pernicious to the\r\nlearned world than the swarms of Goths and Vandals to the politic. It\r\nis, methinks, wonderful, that fellows could be awake, and utter such\r\nincoherent conceptions, and converse with great gravity like learned\r\nmen, without the least taste of knowledge or good sense. It would have\r\nbeen an endless labour to have taken any other method of exposing such\r\nimpertinences, than by an edition of their own works, where you see\r\ntheir follies, according to the ambition of such _virtuosi_, in a most\r\ncorrect edition.\r\n\r\nLooking over these accomplished labours, I could not but reflect upon\r\nthe immense load of writings which the commonalty of scholars have\r\npushed into the world, and the absurdity of parents, who educate crowds\r\nto spend their time in pursuit of such cold and sprightless endeavours\r\nto appear in public. It seems therefore a fruitless labour to attempt\r\nthe correction of the taste of our contemporaries, except it was in\r\nour power to burn all the senseless labours of our ancestors. There\r\nis a secret propensity in nature from generation to generation in the\r\nblockheads of one age to admire those of another; and men of the same\r\nimperfections are as great admirers of each other, as those of the same\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nThis great mischief of voluminous follies proceeds from a misfortune\r\nwhich happens in all ages, that men of barren geniuses, but fertile\r\nimaginations, are bred scholars. This may at first appear a paradox;\r\nbut when we consider the talking creatures we meet in public places,\r\nit will no longer be such. Ralph Shallow is a young fellow, that has\r\nnot by nature any the least propensity to strike into what has not\r\nbeen observed and said every day of his life by others; but with\r\nthat inability of speaking anything that is uncommon, he has a great\r\nreadiness at what he can speak of, and his imagination runs into all\r\nthe different views of the subject he treats of in a moment. If Ralph\r\nhad learning added to the common chit-chat of the town, he would\r\nhave been a disputant upon all topics that ever were considered by\r\nmen of his own genius. As for my part, I never am teased by an empty\r\ntown-fellow, but I bless my stars that he was not bred a scholar. This\r\naddition, we must consider, would have made him capable of maintaining\r\nhis follies. His being in the wrong would have been protected by\r\nsuitable arguments; and when he was hedged in by logical terms, and\r\nfalse appearances, you must have owned yourself convinced before you\r\ncould then have got rid of him, and the shame of his triumph had been\r\nadded to the pain of his impertinence.\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of littleness in the minds of men of wrong sense, which\r\nmakes them much more insufferable than mere fools, and has the further\r\ninconvenience of being attended by an endless loquacity. For which\r\nreason, it would be a very proper work, if some well-wisher to human\r\nsociety would consider the terms upon which people meet in public\r\nplaces, in order to prevent the unseasonable declamations which we meet\r\nwith there. I remember, in my youth it was a humour at the University,\r\nwhen a fellow pretended to be more eloquent than ordinary, and had\r\nformed to himself a plot to gain all our admiration, or triumph over\r\nus with an argument, to either of which he had no manner of call; I\r\nsay, in either of these cases, it was the humour to shut one eye. This\r\nwhimsical way of taking notice to him of his absurdity, has prevented\r\nmany a man from being a coxcomb. If amongst us on such an occasion\r\neach man offered a voluntary rhetorician some snuff, it would probably\r\nproduce the same effect. As the matter now stands, whether a man will\r\nor no, he is obliged to be informed in whatever another pleases to\r\nentertain him with, though the preceptor makes these advances out of\r\nvanity, and not to instruct, but insult him.\r\n\r\nThere is no man will allow him who wants courage to be called a\r\nsoldier; but men who want good sense are very frequently not only\r\nallowed to be scholars, but esteemed for being such. At the same time\r\nit must be granted, that as courage is the natural part of a soldier,\r\nso is a good understanding of a scholar. Such little minds as these,\r\nwhose productions are collected in the volume to which I have the\r\nhonour to be patron, are the instruments for artful men to work with,\r\nand become popular with the unthinking part of mankind. In courts,\r\nthey make transparent flatterers; in camps, ostentatious bullies;\r\nin colleges, unintelligible pedants; and their faculties are used\r\naccordingly by those who lead them.\r\n\r\nWhen a man who wants judgment is admitted into the conversation of\r\nreasonable men, he shall remember such improper circumstances, and draw\r\nsuch groundless conclusions from their discourse, and that with such\r\ncolour of sense, as would divide the best set of company that can be\r\ngot together. It is just thus with a fool who has a familiarity with\r\nbooks, he shall quote and recite one author against another, in such\r\na manner as shall puzzle the best understanding to refute him; though\r\nthe most ordinary capacity may observe, that it is only ignorance which\r\nmakes the intricacy. All the true use of that we call learning, is to\r\nennoble and improve our natural faculties, and not to disguise our\r\nimperfections. It is therefore in vain for folly to attempt to conceal\r\nitself by the refuge of learned languages. Literature does but make a\r\nman more eminently the thing which nature made him; and Polyglottes,\r\nhad he studied less than he has, and written only in his mother tongue,\r\nhad been known only in Great Britain for a pedant.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff thanks Dorinda, and will both answer her letter,[12]\r\nand take her advice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Steele was apparently unaware that the letters in this famous book\r\nwere a satire, directed against the clergy of the Catholic Church. The\r\nletters, written by Ulrich von Hutten and his friends, purported to\r\nbe from certain monks and theologians to Ortuinus Gratius, doctor of\r\ntheology. They were intended to ridicule the bad Latin of the clergy,\r\nand in every way to satirise the anti-reform party. (See Bayle's\r\n\"Dictionary,\" Arts. Hochstrat and Hutten; and _Retrospective Review_,\r\nv. 56.) The elegant edition of this book published in London in 1710,\r\nin 12mo, was dedicated to Steele by the editor, Maittaire.\r\n\r\n[12] No mention is afterwards made of Dorinda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 198.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n        From _Thursday, July 13_, to _Saturday, July 15, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Quale sit id quod amas celeri circumspice mente,\r\n    Et tua læsuro substrahe colla jugo.\r\n\r\n                                            OVID, Rem. Amor., i. 89.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _From my own Apartment, July 14._\r\n\r\n                         THE HISTORY OF CÆLIA.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to look back into the first years of this young\r\nlady, whose story is of consequence only as her life has lately met\r\nwith passages very uncommon. She is now in the twentieth year of her\r\nage, and owes a strict, but cheerful education, to the care of an\r\naunt, to whom she was recommended by her dying father, whose decease\r\nwas hastened by an inconsolable affliction for the loss of her mother.\r\nAs Cælia is the offspring of the most generous passion that has been\r\nknown in our age, she is adorned with as much beauty and grace as the\r\nmost celebrated of her sex possess; but her domestic life, moderate\r\nfortune, and religious education gave her but little opportunity, and\r\nless inclination, to be admired in public assemblies. Her abode has\r\nbeen for some years a convenient distance from the Cathedral of St.\r\nPaul's, where her aunt and she chose to reside, for the advantage of\r\nthat rapturous way of devotion which gives ecstasy to the pleasures of\r\ninnocence, and, in some measure, is the immediate possession of those\r\nheavenly enjoyments for which they are addressed.\r\n\r\nAs you may trace the usual thoughts of men in their countenances, there\r\nappeared in the face of Cælia a cheerfulness, the constant companion of\r\nunaffected virtue, and a gladness, which is as inseparable from true\r\npiety. Her every look and motion spoke the peaceful, mild, resigning,\r\nhumble inhabitant that animated her beauteous body. Her air discovered\r\nher body a mere machine of her mind, and not that her thoughts were\r\nemployed in studying graces and attractions for her person. Such\r\nwas Cælia when she was first seen by Palamede at her usual place of\r\nworship. Palamede is a young man of two-and-twenty, well-fashioned,\r\nlearned, genteel, and discreet, and son and heir of a gentleman of a\r\nvery great estate, and himself possessed of a plentiful one by the\r\ngift of an uncle. He became enamoured with Cælia, and after having\r\nlearned her habitation, had address enough to communicate his passion\r\nand circumstances with such an air of good sense and integrity, as\r\nsoon obtained permission to visit and profess his inclinations towards\r\nher. Palamede's present fortune and future expectations were no way\r\nprejudicial to his addresses; but after the lovers had passed some time\r\nin the agreeable entertainments of a successful courtship, Cælia one\r\nday took occasion to interrupt Palamede in the midst of a very pleasing\r\ndiscourse of the happiness he promised himself in so accomplished a\r\ncompanion, and assuming a serious air, told him, there was another\r\nheart to be won before he gained hers, which was that of his father.\r\nPalamede seemed much disturbed at the overture, and lamented to her,\r\nthat his father was one of those too provident parents, who only\r\nplace their thoughts upon bringing riches into their families by\r\nmarriages, and are wholly insensible of all other considerations. But\r\nthe strictness of Cælia's rules of life made her insist upon this\r\ndemand; and the son, at a proper hour, communicated to his father the\r\ncircumstances of his love, and the merit of the object. The next day\r\nthe father made her a visit. The beauty of her person, the fame of her\r\nvirtue, and a certain irresistible charm in her whole behaviour on so\r\ntender and delicate an occasion, wrought so much upon him, in spite of\r\nall prepossessions, that he hastened the marriage with an impatience\r\nequal to that of his son. Their nuptials were celebrated with a privacy\r\nsuitable to the character and modesty of Cælia, and from that day, till\r\na fatal one of last week, they lived together with all the joy and\r\nhappiness which attend minds entirely united.\r\n\r\nIt should have been intimated, that Palamede is a student of the\r\nTemple, and usually retired thither early in a morning, Cælia still\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nIt happened a few days since, that she followed him thither to\r\ncommunicate to him something she had omitted in her redundant fondness\r\nto speak of the evening before. When she came to his apartment, the\r\nservant there told her, she was coming with a letter to her. While\r\nCælia in an inner room was reading an apology from her husband, that\r\nhe had been suddenly taken by some of his acquaintance to dine at\r\nBrentford, but that he should return in the evening, a country girl,\r\ndecently clad, asked, if those were not the chambers of Mr. Palamede?\r\nShe was answered, they were, but that he was not in town. The stranger\r\nasked, when he was expected at home? The servant replied, she would\r\ngo in and ask his wife. The young woman repeated the word \"wife,\" and\r\nfainted. This accident raised no less curiosity than amazement in\r\nCælia, who caused her to be removed into the inner room. Upon proper\r\napplications to revive her, the unhappy young creature returned to\r\nherself, and said to Cælia, with an earnest and beseeching tone, \"Are\r\nyou really Mr. Palamede's wife?\" Cælia replies, \"I hope I do not look\r\nas if I were any other in the condition you see me.\" The stranger\r\nanswers, \"No, madam, he is my husband.\" At the same instant she threw\r\na bundle of letters into Cælia's lap, which confirmed the truth of\r\nwhat she asserted. Their mutual innocence and sorrow made them look at\r\neach other as partners in distress, rather than rivals in love. The\r\nsuperiority of Cælia's understanding and genius gave her an authority\r\nto examine into this adventure as if she had been offended against, and\r\nthe other the delinquent. The stranger spoke in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Madam, if it shall please you, Mr. Palamede having an uncle of a good\r\nestate near Winchester, was bred at the school there, to gain the more\r\nhis good-will by being in his sight. His uncle died, and left him the\r\nestate, which my husband now has. When he was a mere youth he set his\r\naffections on me: but when he could not gain his ends he married me,\r\nmaking me and my mother, who is a farmer's widow, swear we would never\r\ntell it upon any account whatsoever; for that it would not look well\r\nfor him to marry such a one as me; besides, that his father would cut\r\nhim off of the estate. I was glad to have him in an honest way, and he\r\nnow and then came and stayed a night and away at our house. But very\r\nlately he came down to see us, with a fine young gentleman his friend,\r\nwho stayed behind there with us, pretending to like the place for the\r\nsummer; but ever since Master Palamede went, he has attempted to abuse\r\nme; and I ran hither to acquaint him with it, and avoid the wicked\r\nintentions of his false friend.\"\r\n\r\nCælia had no more room for doubt, but left her rival the same agonies\r\nshe felt herself. Palamede returns in the evening, and finding his wife\r\nat his chambers, learned all that had passed, and hastened to Cælia's\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to imagine than express the sentiments of either the\r\ncriminal or the injured at this encounter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Palamede had found way for speech, he confessed his\r\nmarriage, and his placing his companion on purpose to vitiate his wife,\r\nthat he might break through a marriage made in his nonage, and devote\r\nhis riper and knowing years to Cælia. She made him no answer; but\r\nretired to her closet. He returned to the Temple, where he soon after\r\nreceived from her the following letter:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"You, who this morning were the best, are now the worst of men who\r\nbreathe vital air. I am at once overwhelmed with love, hatred, rage,\r\nand disdain. Can infamy and innocence live together? I feel the weight\r\nof the one too strong for the comfort of the other. How bitter, Heaven,\r\nhow bitter is my portion! How much have I to say; but the infant which\r\nI bear about me stirs with my agitation. I am, Palamede, to live in\r\nshame, and this creature be heir to it. Farewell for ever.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] This quotation is attributed erroneously to Horace in the early\r\neditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =No. 199.=          [STEELE.[14]\r\n\r\n         From _Saturday, July 15_, to _Tuesday, July 18, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we revolve in our thoughts such catastrophes as that in the\r\nhistory of the unhappy Cælia, there seems to be something so hazardous\r\nin the changing a single state of life into that of marriage, that (it\r\nmay happen) all the precautions imaginable are not sufficient to defend\r\na virgin from ruin by her choice. It seems a wonderful inconsistence\r\nin the distribution of public justice, that a man who robs a woman of\r\nan ear-ring or a jewel, should be punished with death; but one who by\r\nfalse arts and insinuations should take from her her very self, is only\r\nto suffer disgrace. This excellent young woman has nothing to console\r\nherself with, but the reflection that her sufferings are not the effect\r\nof any guilt or misconduct, and has for her protection the influence of\r\na power which, amidst the unjust reproach of all mankind, can give not\r\nonly patience, but pleasure to innocence in distress.\r\n\r\nAs the person who is the criminal against Cælia cannot be sufficiently\r\npunished according to our present law, so are there numberless unhappy\r\npersons without remedy according to present custom. That great ill\r\nwhich has prevailed among us in these latter ages, is the making even\r\nbeauty and virtue the purchase of money. The generality of parents, and\r\nsome of those of quality, instead of looking out for introducing health\r\nof constitution, frankness of spirit, or dignity of countenance, into\r\ntheir families, lay out all their thoughts upon finding out matches\r\nfor their estates, and not their children. You shall have one form a\r\nplot for the good of his family, that there shall not be six men in\r\nEngland capable of pretending to his daughter. A second shall have a\r\nson obliged, out of mere discretion, for fear of doing anything below\r\nhimself, follow all the drabs in town. These sage parents meet; and\r\nas there is no pass, no courtship, between the young ones, it is no\r\nunpleasant observation to behold how they proceed to treaty. There is\r\never in the behaviour of each something that denotes his circumstance;\r\nand honest Coupler the conveniencer says, he can distinguish upon sight\r\nof the parties, before they have opened any point of their business,\r\nwhich of the two has the daughter to sell. Coupler is of our club, and\r\nI have frequently heard him declaim upon this subject, and assert, that\r\nthe marriage-settlements which are now used have grown fashionable even\r\nwithin his memory.\r\n\r\nWhen the theatre in some late reigns owed its chief support to those\r\nscenes which were written to put matrimony out of countenance,\r\nand render that state terrible, then it was that pin-money[15]\r\nfirst prevailed, and all the other articles inserted which create\r\na diffidence; and intimate to the young people, that they are very\r\nsoon to be in a state of war with each other: though this had seldom\r\nhappened, except the fear of it had been expressed. Coupler will tell\r\nyou also, that jointures were never frequent till the age before his\r\nown; but the women were contented with the third part of the estate the\r\nlaw allotted them, and scorned to engage with men whom they thought\r\ncapable of abusing their children. He has also informed me, that those\r\nwho were the oldest benchers when he came to the Temple told him, the\r\nfirst marriage-settlement of considerable length was the invention of\r\nan old serjeant, who took the opportunity of two testy fathers, who\r\nwere ever squabbling to bring about an alliance between their children.\r\nThese fellows knew each other to be knaves, and the serjeant took hold\r\nof their mutual diffidence, for the benefit of the law, to extend the\r\nsettlement to three skins of parchment.\r\n\r\nTo this great benefactor to the profession is owing the present\r\nprice current of lines and words. Thus is tenderness thrown out of\r\nthe question; and the great care is, what the young couple shall do\r\nwhen they come to hate each other? I do not question but from this\r\none humour of settlements, might very fairly be deduced not only our\r\npresent defection in point of morals, but also our want of people. This\r\nhas given way to such unreasonable gallantries, that a man is hardly\r\nreproachable that deceives an innocent woman, though she has never so\r\nmuch merit, if she is below him in fortune. The man has no dishonour\r\nfollowing his treachery; and her own sex are so debased by force of\r\ncustom, as to say in the case of the woman, \"How could she expect he\r\nwould marry her.\"\r\n\r\nBy this means the good offices, the pleasures and graces of life, are\r\nnot put into the balance: the bridegroom has given his estate out of\r\nhimself, and he has no more left but to follow the blind decree of his\r\nfate, whether he shall be succeeded by a sot, or a man of merit, in his\r\nfortune. On the other side, a fine woman, who has also a fortune, is\r\nset up by way of auction; her first lover has ten to one against him.\r\nThe very hour after he has opened his heart and his rent-roll, he is\r\nmade no other use of, but to raise her price. She and her friends lose\r\nno opportunity of publishing it to call in new bidders. While the poor\r\nlover very innocently waits till the plenipotentiaries at the Inns of\r\nCourt have debated about the alliance, all the partisans of the lady\r\nthrow difficulties in the way, till other offers come in; and the man\r\nwho came first is not put in possession, till she has been refused by\r\nhalf the town. If an abhorrence to such mercenary proceedings were well\r\nsettled in the minds of my fair readers, those of merit would have a\r\nway opened to their advancement; nay, those who abound in wealth only,\r\nwould in reality find their account in it. It would not be in the power\r\nof their prude acquaintance, their waiters, their nurses, cousins and\r\nwhisperers, to persuade them, that there are not above twenty men in\r\na kingdom (and those such as perhaps they may never set eyes on) whom\r\nthey can think of with discretion. As the case stands now, let any one\r\nconsider, how the great heiresses, and those to whom they were offered,\r\nfor no other reason but that they could make them suitable settlements,\r\nlive together. What can be more insipid, if not loathsome, than for\r\ntwo persons to be at the head of a crowd, who have as little regard\r\nfor them as they for each other, and behold one another in an affected\r\nsense of prosperity, without the least relish of that exquisite\r\ngladness at meeting, that sweet inquietude at parting, together with\r\nthe charms of voice, look, gesture, and that general benevolence\r\nbetween well-chosen lovers, which makes all things please, and leaves\r\nnot the least trifle indifferent.\r\n\r\nBut I am diverted from these sketches for future essays[16] in behalf\r\nof my numerous clients of the fair sex, by a notice sent to my office\r\nin Sheer Lane, that a blooming widow, in the third year of her\r\nwidowhood, and twenty-sixth of her age, designs to take a colonel of\r\ntwenty-eight. The parties request I would draw up their terms of coming\r\ntogether, as having a regard to my opinion against long and diffident\r\nsettlements; and I have sent them the following indenture:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We John ---- and Mary ---- having estates for life, resolve to take\r\neach other.

That\r\nwhich follows is of importance:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"You can't think it strange if I, who know little of the world, apply\r\nto you for advice in the weighty affair of matrimony, since you\r\nyourself have often declared it to be of that consequence as to require\r\nthe utmost deliberation. Without further preface, therefore, give\r\nme leave to tell you, that my father at his death left me a fortune\r\nsufficient to make me a match for any gentleman. My mother (for she\r\nis still alive) is very pressing with me to marry; and I am apt to\r\nthink, to gratify her, I shall venture upon one of two gentlemen who\r\nat this time make their addresses to me. My request is, that you would\r\ndirect me in my choice; which that you may the better do, I shall give\r\nyou their characters; and to avoid confusion, desire you to call them\r\nby the names of Philander and Silvius. Philander is young, and has a\r\ngood estate; Silvius is as young, and has a better. The former has\r\nhad a liberal education, has seen the town, is retired from thence to\r\nhis estate in the country, is a man of few words, and much given to\r\nbooks. The latter was brought up under his father's eye, who gave\r\nhim just learning enough to enable him to keep his accounts; but\r\nmade him withal very expert in country business, such as ploughing,\r\nsowing, buying, selling, and the like. They are both very sober men,\r\nneither of their persons is disagreeable, nor did I know which to\r\nprefer till I had heard them discourse; when the conversation of\r\nPhilander so much prevailed, as to give him the advantage, with me, in\r\nall other respects. My mother pleads strongly for Silvius, and uses\r\nthese arguments, that he not only has the larger estate at present,\r\nbut by his good husbandry and management increases it daily; that his\r\nlittle knowledge in other affairs will make him easy and tractable;\r\nwhereas (according to her) men of letters know too much to make good\r\nhusbands. To part of this I imagine I answer effectually, by saying,\r\nPhilander's estate is large enough; that they who think £2000 a year\r\nsufficient, make no difference between that and three. I easily believe\r\nhim less conversant in those affairs, the knowledge of which she so\r\nmuch commends in Silvius; but I think them neither so necessary or\r\nbecoming in a gentleman as the accomplishments of Philander. It is no\r\ngreat character of a man to say, he rides in his coach and six, and\r\nunderstands as much as he who follows his plough. Add to this, that the\r\nconversation of these sort of men seems so disagreeable to me, that\r\nthough they may make good bailiffs, I can hardly be persuaded they can\r\nbe good companions. It is possible I may seem to have odd notions,\r\nwhen I say I am not fond of a man only for being of (what is called) a\r\nthriving temper. To conclude, I own I am at a loss to conceive how good\r\nsense should make a man an ill husband, or conversing with books less\r\ncomplaisant.\r\n\r\n\"CÆLIA.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution which this lady is going to take, she may very well say\r\nis founded on reason: for after the necessities of life are served,\r\nthere is no manner of competition between a man of liberal education\r\nand an illiterate. Men are not altered by their circumstances, but as\r\nthey give them opportunities of exerting what they are in themselves;\r\nand a powerful clown is a tyrant in the most ugly form he can possibly\r\nappear. There lies a seeming objection in the thoughtful manner of\r\nPhilander: but let her consider which she shall oftener have occasion\r\nto wish, that Philander would speak, or Silvius hold his tongue.\r\n\r\nThe train of my discourse is prevented by the urgent haste of another\r\ncorrespondent:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                              _July 14_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"This comes to you from one of those virgins of twenty-five years old\r\nand upwards, that you, like a patron of the distressed, promised to\r\nprovide for;[17] who makes it her humble request, that no occasional\r\nstories or subjects may (as they have for three or four of your last\r\ndays) prevent your publishing the scheme you have communicated to\r\nAmanda, for every day and hour is of the greatest consequence to\r\ndamsels of so advanced an age.

If the matter bears, I shall\r\nnot be unjust to his merit: I only desire to enlarge his plan; for\r\nwhich purpose I lay it before the town, as well for the improvement as\r\nencouragement of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Amicable Contribution for raising the Fortunes of Ten Young\r\nLadies._\r\n\r\n\"_Imprimis_, It is proposed to raise 100,000 crowns by way of lots,\r\nwhich will advance for each lady £2500, which sum, together with one\r\nof the ladies, the gentleman that shall be so happy as to draw a prize\r\n(provided they both like), will be entitled to, under such restrictions\r\nhereafter mentioned. And in case they do not like, then either party\r\nthat refuses shall be entitled to £1000 only, and the remainder to him\r\nor her that shall be willing to marry, the man being first to declare\r\nhis mind. But it is provided, that if both parties shall consent to\r\nhave one another, the gentleman shall, before he receives the money\r\nthus raised, settle £1000 of the same in substantial hands (who shall\r\nbe as trustees for the said ladies), and shall have the whole and sole\r\ndisposal of it for her use only.\r\n\r\n\"_Note._--Each party shall have three months' time to consider, after\r\nan interview had, which shall be within ten days after the lots are\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\n\"_Note also._--The name and place of abode of the prize shall be placed\r\non a proper ticket.\r\n\r\n\"_Item._--They shall be ladies that have had a liberal education,\r\nbetween fifteen and twenty-three, all genteel, witty, and of unblamable\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\"The money to be raised shall be kept in an iron box, and when there\r\nshall be 2000 subscriptions, which amounts to £500, it shall be taken\r\nout and put into a goldsmith's hands, and the note made payable to the\r\nproper lady, or her assigns (with a clause therein to hinder her from\r\nreceiving it, till the fortunate person that draws her shall first sign\r\nthe note), and so on till the whole sum is subscribed for: and as soon\r\nas 100,000 subscriptions are completed, and 200 crowns more to pay the\r\ncharges, the lottery shall be drawn at a proper place, to be appointed\r\na fortnight before the drawing.\"\r\n\r\n_Note._--Mr. Bickerstaff objects to the marriageable years here\r\nmentioned; and is of opinion, they should not commence till after\r\ntwenty-three.

In vain do we\r\nsay, the whole sex would run into England, while the privileges which\r\nare allowed them do no way balance the inconveniences arising from\r\nthose very immunities. Our women have very much indulged to them in\r\nthe participation of our fortunes and our liberty; but the errors they\r\ncommit in the use of either, are by no means so impartially considered\r\nas the false steps which are made by men. In the commerce of lovers,\r\nthe man makes the address, assails, and betrays, and yet stands in\r\nthe same degree of acceptance as he was in before he committed that\r\ntreachery: the woman, for no other crime but believing one whom she\r\nthought loved her, is treated with shyness and indifference at the\r\nbest, and commonly with reproach and scorn. He that is past the power\r\nof beauty may talk of this matter with the same unconcern as of any\r\nother subject: therefore I shall take upon me to consider the sex, as\r\nthey live within rules, and as they transgress them. The ordinary class\r\nof the good or the ill have very little influence upon the actions of\r\nothers; but the eminent in either kind are those who lead the world\r\nbelow them. The ill are employed in communicating scandal, infamy, and\r\ndisease, like furies; the good distribute benevolence, friendship,\r\nand health, like angels. The ill are damped with pain and anguish at\r\nthe sight of all that is laudable, lovely, or happy. The virtuous are\r\ntouched with commiseration toward the guilty, the disagreeable, and the\r\nwretched. There are those who betray the innocent of their own sex, and\r\nsolicit the lewd of ours. There are those who have abandoned the very\r\nmemory, not only of innocence, but shame. There are those who never\r\nforgave, nor could ever bear being forgiven. There are also who visit\r\nthe beds of the sick, lull the cares of the sorrowful, and double the\r\njoys of the joyful. Such is the destroying fiend, such the guardian\r\nangel, woman.\r\n\r\nThe way to have a greater number of the amiable part of womankind, and\r\nlessen the crowd of the other sort, is to contribute what we can to\r\nthe success of well-grounded passions; and therefore I comply with the\r\nrequest of an enamoured man in inserting the following billet:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bickerstaff you always read, though me you will never hear. I am\r\nobliged therefore to his compassion for the opportunity of imploring\r\nyours. I sigh for the most accomplished of her sex. That is so just a\r\ndistinction of her to whom I write, that the owning I think so is no\r\ndistinction of me who write. Your good qualities are peculiar to you,\r\nmy admiration in common with thousands. I shall be present when you\r\nread this, but fear every woman will take it for her character, sooner\r\nthan she who deserves it.\"\r\n\r\nIf the next letter which presents itself should come from the mistress\r\nof this modest lover, and I make them break through the oppression of\r\ntheir passions, I shall expect gloves at their nuptials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"You that are a philosopher know very well the make of the mind of\r\nwoman, and can best instruct me in the conduct of an affair which\r\nhighly concerns me.

'Tis a strange thing\r\nthis distance in men of sense; why do not they always urge their fate?\r\nIf we are sincere in our severity, you lose nothing by attempting. If\r\nwe are hypocrites, you certainly succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, July 21._\r\n\r\nBefore I withdraw from business for the night, it is my custom to\r\nreceive all addresses to me, that others may go to rest as well as\r\nmyself, at least as far as I can contribute to it. When I called to\r\nknow if any would speak with me, I was informed that Mr. Mills,[19]\r\nthe player, desired to be admitted. He was so, and with much modesty\r\nacquainted me, as he did other people of note, that \"Hamlet\" was to be\r\nacted on Wednesday next for his benefit. I had long wanted to speak\r\nwith this person, because I thought I could admonish him of many things\r\nwhich would tend to his improvement. In the general I observed to him,\r\nthat though action was his business, the way to that action was not to\r\nstudy gesture, for the behaviour would follow the sentiments of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAction to the player, is what speech is to an orator. If the matter be\r\nwell conceived, words will flow with ease; and if the actor is well\r\npossessed of the nature of his part, a proper action will necessarily\r\nfollow. He informed me, that Wilks was to act Hamlet. I desired him, to\r\nrequest of him in my name, that he would wholly forget Mr. Betterton;\r\nfor that he failed in no part of Othello, but where he had him in view.\r\nAn actor's forming himself by the carriage of another, is like the\r\ntrick among the widows, who lament their husbands as their neighbours\r\ndid theirs, and not according to their own sentiments of the deceased.\r\n\r\nThere is a fault also in the audience which interrupts their\r\nsatisfaction very much, that is, the figuring to themselves the actor\r\nin some part wherein they formerly particularly liked him, and not\r\nattending to the part he is at that time performing. Thus, whatever\r\nWilks (who is the strictest follower of nature) is acting, the vulgar\r\nspectators turn their thoughts upon Sir Harry Wildair.\r\n\r\nWhen I had indulged the loquacity of an old man for some time in such\r\nloose hints, I took my leave of Mr. Mills, and was told, Mr. Elliot[20]\r\nof St. James's Coffee-house would speak with me. His business was to\r\ndesire I would, as I am an astrologer, let him know beforehand who were\r\nto have the benefit tickets in the ensuing lottery; which knowledge he\r\nwas of opinion he could turn to great account, as he was concerned in\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nI granted his request, upon an oath of secrecy, that he would only\r\nmake his own use of it, and not let it be publicly known till after\r\nthey were drawn. I had not done speaking, when he produced to me a\r\nplan which he had formed of keeping books, with the names of all such\r\nadventurers, and the numbers of their tickets, as should come to him,\r\nin order to give an hourly account[21] of what tickets shall come up\r\nduring the whole time of the lottery, the drawing of which is to begin\r\non Wednesday next. I liked his method of disguising the secret I had\r\ntold him, and pronounced him a thriving man who could so well watch the\r\nmotion of things, and profit by a prevailing humour and impatience so\r\naptly, as to make his honest industry agreeable to his customers, as it\r\nis to be the messenger of their good fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n               _From the Trumpet in Sheer Lane, July 20._\r\n\r\nOrdered, that for the improvement of the pleasures of society, a member\r\nof this house, one of the most wakeful of the soporific assembly beyond\r\nSmithfield Bars, and one of the order of story-tellers in Holborn, may\r\nmeet and exchange stale matter, and report the same to their principals.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--No man is to tell above one story in the same evening; but has\r\nliberty to tell the same the night following.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff desires his love correspondents to vary the names they\r\nshall assume in their future letters, for that he is overstocked with\r\nPhilanders.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] John Mills, the elder, who died in 1736. Cibber says that Mills\r\nowed his advancement to Wilks, to whose friendship his qualities as an\r\n\"honest, quiet, careful man, of as few faults as excellences, commended\r\nhim.\" Mills' salary (see table printed in vol. ii. p. 164) was the same\r\nas Betterton's--£4 a week, and £1 for his wife.\r\n\r\n[20] On November 19, 1710, Swift and Steele met at the St. James's\r\nCoffee-house. \"This evening,\" says Swift, \"I christened our coffee-man\r\nElliot's child, where the rogue had a most noble supper, and Steele and\r\nI sat among some scurvy company over a bowl of punch; so that I am come\r\nlate home.\"\r\n\r\n[21] See No. 202, end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 202.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Saturday, July 22_, to _Tuesday, July 25, 1710_.\r\n\r\n                                ----Est hic,\r\n    Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit æquus.\r\n\r\n                                                     HOR., 1 Ep. xi. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, July 24._\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I went to visit a gentleman of my acquaintance at Mile\r\nEnd, and passing through Stepney Churchyard, I could not forbear\r\nentertaining myself with the inscriptions on the tombs and graves.\r\nAmong others, I observed one with this notable memorial:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies the body of T.B.\"\r\n\r\nThis fantastical desire of being remembered only by the two first\r\nletters of a name, led me into the contemplation of the vanity and\r\nimperfect attainments of ambition in general. When I run back in my\r\nimagination all the men whom I have ever known and conversed with in my\r\nwhole life, there are but very few who have not used their faculties\r\nin the pursuit of what it is impossible to acquire, or left the\r\npossession of what they might have been (at their setting out) masters,\r\nto search for it where it was out of their reach. In this thought it\r\nwas not possible to forget the instance of Pyrrhus, who proposing to\r\nhimself in discourse with a philosopher,[22] one, and another, and\r\nanother conquest, was asked, what he would do after all that? \"Then,\"\r\nsays the King, \"we will make merry.\" He was well answered, \"What\r\nhinders your doing that in the condition you are already?\" The restless\r\ndesire of exerting themselves above the common level of mankind is not\r\nto be resisted in some tempers; and minds of this make may be observed\r\nin every condition of life. Where such men do not make to themselves or\r\nmeet with employment, the soil of their constitution runs into tares\r\nand weeds. An old friend of mine, who lost a major's post forty years\r\nago, and quitted, has ever since studied maps, encampments, retreats,\r\nand countermarches, with no other design but to feed his spleen and\r\nill-humour, and furnish himself with matter for arguing against all\r\nthe successful actions of others. He that at his first setting out in\r\nthe world was the gayest man in our regiment, ventured his life with\r\nalacrity, and enjoyed it with satisfaction, encouraged men below him,\r\nand was courted by men above him, has been ever since the most froward\r\ncreature breathing. His warm complexion spends itself now only in a\r\ngeneral spirit of contradiction; for which he watches all occasions,\r\nand is in his conversation still upon sentry, treats all men like\r\nenemies, with every other impertinence of a speculative warrior.\r\n\r\nHe that observes in himself this natural inquietude, should take all\r\nimaginable care to put his mind in some method of gratification, or he\r\nwill soon find himself grow into the condition of this disappointed\r\nmajor. Instead of courting proper occasions to rise above others,\r\nhe will be ever studious of pulling others down to him: it being\r\nthe common refuge of disappointed ambition, to ease themselves by\r\ndetraction. It would be no great argument against ambition, that there\r\nare such mortal things in the disappointment of it; but it certainly\r\nis a forcible exception, that there can be no solid happiness in the\r\nsuccess of it. If we value popular praise, it is in the power of the\r\nmeanest of the people to disturb us by calumny. If the fame of being\r\nhappy, we cannot look into a village but we see crowds in actual\r\npossession of what we seek only the appearance. To this may be added,\r\nthat there is I know not what malignity in the minds of ordinary\r\nmen to oppose you in what they see you fond of; and it is a certain\r\nexception against a man's receiving applause, that he visibly courts\r\nit. However, this is not only the passion of great and undertaking\r\nspirits, but you see it in the lives of such as one would believe were\r\nfar enough removed from the ways of ambition. The rural squires of this\r\nnation even eat and drink out of vanity. A vainglorious fox-hunter\r\nshall entertain half a county for the ostentation of his beef and\r\nbeer, without the least affection for any of the crowd about him.\r\nHe feeds them, because he thinks it a superiority over them that he\r\ndoes so: and they devour him, because they know he treats them out of\r\ninsolence. This indeed is ambition in grotesque, but may figure to us\r\nthe condition of politer men, whose only pursuit is glory. When the\r\nsuperior acts out of a principle of vanity, the dependant will be sure\r\nto allow it him; because he knows it destructive of the very applause\r\nwhich is courted by the man who favours him, and consequently makes him\r\nnearer himself.\r\n\r\nBut as every man living has more or less of this incentive, which\r\nmakes men impatient of an inactive condition, and urges men to attempt\r\nwhat may tend to their reputation, it is absolutely necessary they\r\nshould form to themselves an ambition which is in every man's power to\r\ngratify. This ambition would be independent, and would consist only in\r\nacting what to a man's own mind appears most great and laudable. It is\r\na pursuit in the power of every man, and is only a regular prosecution\r\nof what he himself approves. It is what can be interrupted by no\r\noutward accidents, for no man can be robbed of his good intention.\r\nOne of our society of the Trumpet therefore started last night a\r\nnotion which I thought had reason in it. \"It is, methinks,\" said he,\r\n\"an unreasonable thing, that heroic virtue should (as it seems to be\r\nat present) be confined to a certain order of men, and be attainable\r\nby none but those whom fortune has elevated to the most conspicuous\r\nstations. I would have everything to be esteemed as heroic which\r\nis great and uncommon in the circumstances in the man who performs\r\nit.\" Thus there would be no virtue in human life which every one of\r\nthe species would not have a pretence to arrive at, and an ardency\r\nto exert. Since Fortune is not in our power, let us be as little as\r\npossible in hers. Why should it be necessary that a man should be rich,\r\nto be generous? If we measured by the quality, and not the quantity,\r\nof things, the particulars which accompany an action are what should\r\ndenominate it mean or great. The highest station of human life is to\r\nbe attained by each man that pretends to it: for every man can be as\r\nvaliant, as generous, as wise, and as merciful, as the faculties and\r\nopportunities which he has from Heaven and fortune will permit. He\r\nthat can say to himself, I do as much good, and am as virtuous, as my\r\nmost earnest endeavours will allow me, whatever is his station in the\r\nworld, is to himself possessed of the highest honour. If ambition is\r\nnot thus turned, it is no other than a continual succession of anxiety\r\nand vexation. But when it has this cast, it invigorates the mind, and\r\nthe consciousness of its own worth is a reward which it is not in the\r\npower of envy, reproach, or detraction, to take from it. Thus the seat\r\nof solid honour is in a man's own bosom, and no one can want support\r\nwho is in possession of an honest conscience, but he who would suffer\r\nthe reproaches of it for other greatness.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--I was going on in my philosophy, when notice was brought me\r\nthat there was a great crowd in my ante-chamber, who expected audience.\r\nWhen they were admitted, I found they all met at my lodgings; each\r\ncoming upon the same errand, to know whether they were of the fortunate\r\nin the lottery, which is now ready to be drawn. I was much at a loss\r\nhow to extricate myself from their importunity; but observing the\r\nassembly made up of both sexes, I signified to them, that in this case\r\nit would appear Fortune is not blind, for all the lots would fall upon\r\nthe wisest and the fairest. This gave so general a satisfaction, that\r\nthe room was soon emptied, and the company retired with the best air,\r\nand the most pleasing grace, I had anywhere observed. Mr. Elliot[23]\r\nof St. James's Coffee-house now stood alone before me, and signified\r\nto me, he had now not only prepared his books, but had received a\r\nvery great subscription already. His design was, to advertise his\r\nsubscribers at their respective places of abode, within an hour after\r\ntheir number is drawn, whether it was a blank or benefit, if the\r\nadventurer lives within the bills of mortality; if he dwells in the\r\ncountry, by the next post. I encouraged the man in his industry, and\r\ntold him, the ready path to good fortune was to believe there was no\r\nsuch thing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Cineas the orator (see Plutarch's \"Life of Pyrrhus\").\r\n\r\n[23] See No. 201.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 203.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, July 25_, to _Thursday, July 27, 1710_.\r\n\r\n   Ut tu fortunam, sic nos te, Celse, feremus.--HOR., 1 Ep. viii. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, July 26._\r\n\r\nIt is natural for the imaginations of men who lead their lives in too\r\nsolitary a manner, to prey upon themselves, and form from their own\r\nconceptions beings and things which have no place in nature. This\r\noften makes an adept as much at a loss when he comes into the world\r\nas a mere savage. To avoid therefore that ineptitude for society,\r\nwhich is frequently the fault of us scholars, and has to men of\r\nunderstanding and breeding something much more shocking and untractable\r\nthan rusticity itself, I take care to visit all public solemnities,\r\nand go into assemblies as often as my studies will permit. This being\r\ntherefore the first day of the drawing of the lottery,[24] I did\r\nnot neglect spending a considerable time in the crowd: but as much\r\na philosopher as I pretend to be, I could not but look with a sort\r\nof veneration upon the two boys which received the tickets from the\r\nwheels, as the impartial and equal dispensers of the fortunes which\r\nwere to be distributed among the crowd, who all stood expecting the\r\nsame chance. It seems at first thought very wonderful, that one\r\npassion should so universally have the pre-eminence of another in the\r\npossession of men's minds as that in this case; all in general have a\r\nsecret hope of the great ticket: and yet fear in another instance, as\r\nin going into a battle, shall have so little influence, as that though\r\neach man believes there will be many thousands slain, each is confident\r\nhe himself shall escape. This certainty proceeds from our vanity; for\r\nevery man sees abundance in himself that deserves reward, and nothing\r\nwhich should meet with mortification. But of all the adventurers that\r\nfilled the hall, there was one who stood by me, who I could not but\r\nfancy expected the thousand pounds per annum, as a mere justice to his\r\nparts and industry. He had his pencil and table-book, and was at the\r\ndrawing of each lot, counting how much a man with seven tickets was\r\nnow nearer the great prize, by the striking out another and another\r\ncompetitor. This man was of the most particular constitution I had ever\r\nobserved; his passions were so active, that he worked in the utmost\r\nstretch of hope and fear. When one rival fell before him, you might\r\nsee a short gleam of triumph in his countenance, which immediately\r\nvanished at the approach of another. What added to the particularity\r\nof this man, was, that he every moment cast a look, either upon the\r\ncommissioners, the wheels, or the boys. I gently whispered him, and\r\nasked, when he thought the thousand pounds would come up? \"Pugh!\" says\r\nhe, \"who knows that?\" and then looks upon a little list of his own\r\ntickets, which were pretty high in their numbers, and said it would not\r\ncome this ten days. This fellow will have a good chance, though not\r\nthat which he has put his heart on. The man is mechanically turned, and\r\nmade for getting. The simplicity and eagerness which he is in, argues\r\nan attention to his point; though what he is labouring at does not\r\nin the least contribute to it. Were it not for such honest fellows as\r\nthese, the men who govern the rest of their species would have no tools\r\nto work with: for the outward show of the world is carried on by such\r\nas cannot find out that they are doing nothing. I left my man with\r\ngreat reluctance, seeing the care he took to observe the whole conduct\r\nof the persons concerned, and compute the inequality of the chances\r\nwith his own hands and eyes. \"Dear sir,\" said I, \"they must rise early\r\nthat cheat you.\" \"Ay,\" said he, \"there's nothing like a man's minding\r\nhis business himself.\" \"'Tis very true,\" said I; \"the master's eye\r\nmakes the horse fat.\"\r\n\r\nAs it is much the greater number who are to go without prizes, it\r\nis but very expedient to turn our lecture[25] to the forming just\r\nsentiments on the subject of fortune. One said this morning, that\r\nthe chief lot he was confident would fall upon some puppy; but this\r\ngentleman is one of those wrong tempers who approve only the unhappy,\r\nand have a natural prejudice to the fortunate. But as it is certain\r\nthat there is a great meanness in being attached to a man purely for\r\nhis fortune, there is no less a meanness in disliking him for his\r\nhappiness. It is the same perverseness under different colours, and\r\nboth these resentments arise from mere pride.\r\n\r\nThe true greatness of mind consists in valuing men apart from their\r\ncircumstances, or according to their behaviour in them. Wealth is\r\na distinction only in traffic; but it must not be allowed as a\r\nrecommendation in any other particular, but only just as it is applied.\r\nIt was very prettily said, that we may learn the little value of\r\nfortune by the persons on whom Heaven is pleased to bestow it.[26]\r\nHowever, there is not a harder part in human life than becoming wealth\r\nand greatness. He must be very well stocked with merit, who is not\r\nwilling to draw some superiority over his friends from his fortune: for\r\nit is not every man that can entertain with the air of a guest, and do\r\ngood offices with the mien of one that receives them.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I cannot conceive how a man can place himself in a\r\nfigure wherein he can so much enjoy his own soul, and that greatest\r\nof pleasures, the just approbation of his own actions, than as an\r\nadventurer on this occasion, to sit and see the lots go off without\r\nhope or fear, perfectly unconcerned as to himself, but taking part in\r\nthe good fortune of others.\r\n\r\nI will believe there are happy tempers in being, to whom all the good\r\nthat arrives to any of their fellow-creatures gives a pleasure. These\r\nlive in a course of substantial and lasting happiness, and have the\r\nsatisfaction to see all men endeavour to gratify them. This state of\r\nmind not only lets a man into certain enjoyments, but relieves him from\r\nas certain anxieties. If you will not rejoice with happy men, you must\r\nrepine at them. Dick Reptile alluded to this when he said, he would\r\nhate no man out of pure idleness. As for my own part, I look at fortune\r\nquite in another view than the rest of the world; and, by my knowledge\r\nin futurity, tremble at the approaching prize which I see coming to a\r\nyoung lady for whom I have much tenderness; and have therefore written\r\nher the following letter, to be sent by Mr. Elliot with the notice of\r\nher ticket:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"You receive at the instant this comes to your hands, an account of\r\nyour having (what only you wanted) fortune; and to admonish you, that\r\nyou may not now want everything else. You had yesterday wit, virtue,\r\nbeauty; but you never heard of them till to-day. They say Fortune\r\nis blind; but you will find she has opened the eyes of all your\r\nbeholders. I beseech you, madam, make use of the advantages of having\r\nbeen educated without flattery. If you can still be Chloe, Fortune has\r\nindeed been kind to you; if you are altered, she has it not in her\r\npower to give you an equivalent.\"[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grecian Coffee-house, July 26._\r\n\r\nSome time ago a virtuoso, my very good friend, sent me a plan of a\r\ncovered summer-house, which a little after was rallied by another of my\r\ncorrespondents.[28] I cannot therefore defer giving him an opportunity\r\nof making his defence to the learned in his own words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      \"To ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n       \"SIR,                                    _July 15, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\"I have been this summer upon a ramble to visit several friends and\r\nrelations; which is the reason I have left you, and our ingenious,\r\nunknown friend of South Wales, so long in your error concerning the\r\ngrass-plots in my green-house. I will not give you the particulars\r\nof my gardener's conduct in the management of my covered garden, but\r\ncontent myself with letting you know, that my little fields within\r\ndoors, though by their novelty they appear too extravagant to you to\r\nsubsist even in a regular imagination, are in the effect things that\r\nrequire no conjuration. Your correspondent may depend upon it, that\r\nunder a sashed roof, which lets in the sun at all times, and the air\r\nas often as is convenient, he may have grass-plots in the greatest\r\nperfection, if he will be at the pains to water, mow, and roll them.\r\nGrass and herbs in general, the less they are exposed to the sun and\r\nwind, the livelier is their verdure. They require only warmth and\r\nmoisture; and if you were to see my plots, your eye would soon confess,\r\nthat the bowling-green at Marybone[29] wears not half so bright a\r\nlivery.\r\n\r\n\"The motto with which the gentleman has been pleased to furnish you, is\r\nso very proper, and pleases me so well, that I design to have it set\r\nupon the front of my green-house in letters of gold.\r\n\r\n\"I am, Sir, &c.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] See No. 124.\r\n\r\n[25] Discourse.\r\n\r\n[26] A writer in _Notes and Queries_ (March 19, 1887) has pointed out\r\nthat Luther says in his \"Colloquies\" (1652), p. 90, \"Our Lord commonly\r\ngiveth riches to such gross asses to whom He affordeth nothing else\r\nthat is good.\"\r\n\r\n[27] Chloe's reply is in No. 207.\r\n\r\n[28] See Nos. 179 and 188.\r\n\r\n[29] In 1728 we hear of persons arriving in London \"from their\r\ncountry-houses in Marylebone\" (_cf._ No. 18).

When she came to make her\r\ndefence, she was so very full of, \"his Worship,\" and of, \"if it should\r\nplease his Honour,\" that we could for some time hardly hear any other\r\napology she made for herself than that of atoning for the ill language\r\nshe had been accused of towards her neighbour by the great civilities\r\nshe paid to her judge. But this extravagance in her sense of doing\r\nhonour, was no more to be wondered at than that her many rings on each\r\nfinger were worn as instances of finery and dress. The vulgar may thus\r\nheap and huddle terms of respect, and nothing better be expected from\r\nthem; but for people of rank to repeat appellatives insignificantly,\r\nis a folly not to be endured, neither with regard to our times or our\r\nunderstanding. It is below the dignity of speech to extend it with more\r\nwords or phrases than are necessary to explain ourselves with elegance:\r\nand it is, methinks, an instance of ignorance, if not of servitude, to\r\nbe redundant in such expressions.\r\n\r\nI waited upon a man of quality some mornings ago: he happened to be\r\ndressing; and his shoemaker fitting him, told him, that if his Lordship\r\nwould please to tread hard, or that if his Lordship would stamp a\r\nlittle, his Lordship would find his Lordship's shoe will fit as easy\r\nas any piece of work his Lordship should see in England. As soon as\r\nmy lord was dressed, a gentleman approached him with a very good air,\r\nand told him, he had an affair which had long depended in the Lower\r\nCourts, which, through the inadvertency of his ancestors on the one\r\nside, and the ill arts of their adversaries on the other, could not\r\npossibly be settled according to the rules of the Lower Courts: that\r\ntherefore he designed to bring his cause before the House of Lords next\r\nsession, where he should be glad if his Lordship should happen to be\r\npresent; for he doubted not but his cause would be approved by all men\r\nof justice and honour. In this place the word \"Lordship\" was gracefully\r\ninserted, because it was applied to him in that circumstance wherein\r\nhis quality was the occasion of the discourse, and wherein it was most\r\nuseful to the one, and most honourable to the other.\r\n\r\nThis way is so far from being disrespectful to the honour of nobles,\r\nthat it is an expedient for using them with greater deference. I would\r\nnot put \"Lordship\" to a man's hat, gloves, wig, or cane; but to desire\r\nhis Lordship's favour, his Lordship's judgment, or his Lordship's\r\npatronage, is a manner of speaking which expresses an alliance between\r\nhis quality and his merit. It is this knowledge which distinguished\r\nthe discourse of the shoemaker from that of the gentleman. The highest\r\npoint of good-breeding, if any one can hit it, is to show a very nice\r\nregard to your own dignity, and with that in your heart express your\r\nvalue for the man above you.\r\n\r\nBut the silly humour to the contrary has so much prevailed, that\r\nthe slavish addition of title enervates discourse, and renders the\r\napplication of it almost ridiculous. We writers of diurnals are nearer\r\nin our styles to that of common talk than any other writers, by which\r\nmeans we use words of respect sometimes very unfortunately. The\r\n_Post-Man_,[30] who is one of the most celebrated of our fraternity,\r\nfell into this misfortune yesterday in his paragraph from Berlin of\r\nJuly 26. \"Count Wartenberg,\" says he, \"Great Chamberlain, and Chief\r\nMinister of this Court, who on Monday last accompanied the King of\r\nPrussia to Oranienburg, was taken so very ill, that on Wednesday his\r\nlife was despaired of; and we had a report, that his Excellency was\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nI humbly presume, that it flattens the narration, to say \"his\r\nExcellency\" in a case which is common to all men; except you would\r\ninfer what is not to be inferred, to wit, that the author designed to\r\nsay, \"all wherein he excelled others was departed from him.\"\r\n\r\nWere distinctions used according to the rules of reason and sense,\r\nthose additions to men's names would be, as they were first intended,\r\nsignificant of their worth, and not their persons; so that in some\r\ncases it might be proper to say, \"The man is dead, but his excellency\r\nwill never die.\" It is, methinks, very unjust to laugh at a Quaker,\r\nbecause he has taken up a resolution to treat you with a word, the most\r\nexpressive of complaisance that can be thought of, and with an air of\r\ngood-nature and charity calls you friend. I say, it is very unjust to\r\nrally him for this term to a stranger, when you yourselves, in all your\r\nphrases of distinction, confound phrases of honour into no use at all.\r\n\r\nTom Courtly, who is the pink of courtesy, is an instance of how little\r\nmoment an undistinguishing application of sounds of honour are to those\r\nwho understand themselves. Tom never fails of paying his obeisance to\r\nevery man he sees, who has title or office to make him conspicuous;\r\nbut his deference is wholly given to outward considerations. I, who\r\nknow him, can tell within half an acre how much land one man has more\r\nthan another by Tom's bow to him. Title is all he knows of honour,\r\nand civility of friendship: for this reason, because he cares for no\r\nman living, he is religiously strict in performing what he calls\r\nhis respects to you. To this end he is very learned in pedigree, and\r\nwill abate something in the ceremony of his approaches to a man, if\r\nhe is in any doubt about the bearing of his coat of arms. What is the\r\nmost pleasant of all his character is, that he acts with a sort of\r\nintegrity in these impertinences; and though he would not do any man\r\nany solid kindness, he is wonderfully just and careful not to wrong his\r\nquality. But as integrity is very scarce in the world, I cannot forbear\r\nhaving respect for the impertinent: it is some virtue to be bound by\r\nanything. Tom and I are upon very good terms for the respect he has for\r\nthe house of Bickerstaff. Though one cannot but laugh at his serious\r\nconsideration of things so little essential, one must have a value even\r\nfor a frivolous good conscience.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] See No. 155.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =No. 205.=       [FULLER.[31]\r\n\r\n         From _Saturday, July 29_, to _Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Νήπιοι, οὐδὲ ἴσασιν ὅσῳ πλέον ἥμισυ παντός,\r\n    Οὐδ' ὅσον ἐν μαλάχῃ τε καὶ ἀσφοδέλῳ μέγ' ὄνειαρ.\r\n\r\n                                             HESIOD, Works and Days, 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, July 31._\r\n\r\nNature has implanted in us two very strong desires, hunger for the\r\npreservation of the individual, and lust for the support of the\r\nspecies; or, to speak more intelligibly, the former to continue\r\nour own persons, and the latter to introduce others into the world.\r\nAccording as men behave themselves with regard to these appetites,\r\nthey are above or below the beasts of the field, which are incited by\r\nthem without choice or reflection. But reasonable creatures correct\r\nthese incentives, and improve them into elegant motives of friendship\r\nand society. It is chiefly from this homely foundation, that we are\r\nunder the necessity of seeking for the agreeable companion, and the\r\nhonourable mistress. By this cultivation of art and reason, our wants\r\nare made pleasures, and the gratification of our desires, under proper\r\nrestrictions, a work no way below our noblest faculties. The wisest\r\nman may maintain his character, and yet consider in what manner he\r\nshall best entertain his friend, or divert his mistress: nay, it is so\r\nfar from being a derogation to him, that he can in no other instances\r\nshow so true a taste of his life or his fortune. What concerns one of\r\nthe above-mentioned appetites, as it is elevated into love, I shall\r\nhave abundant occasion to discourse of before I have provided for\r\nthe numberless crowd of damsels I have proposed to take care of. The\r\nsubject therefore of the present paper shall be that part of society\r\nwhich owes its beginning to the common necessity of hunger. When this\r\nis considered as the support of our being, we may take in under the\r\nsame head thirst also; otherwise when we are pursuing the glutton,\r\nthe drunkard may make his escape. The true choice of our diet, and\r\nour companions at it, seems to consist in that which contributes\r\nmost to cheerfulness and refreshment: and these certainly are best\r\nconsulted by simplicity in the food, and sincerity in the company. By\r\nthis rule are in the first place excluded from pretence to happiness\r\nall meals of state and ceremony, which are performed in dumb show and\r\ngreedy sullenness. At the boards of the great, they say, you shall\r\nhave a number attending with as good habits and countenances as the\r\nguests, which only circumstance must destroy the whole pleasure of\r\nthe repast: for if such attendants are introduced for the dignity of\r\ntheir appearance, modest minds are shocked by considering them as\r\nspectators, or else look upon them as equals, for whose servitude they\r\nare in a kind of suffering. It may be here added, that the sumptuous\r\nsideboard to an ingenuous eye has often more the air of an altar than\r\na table. The next absurd way of enjoying ourselves at meals, is, where\r\nthe bottle is plied without being called for, where humour takes place\r\nof appetite, and the good company are too dull or too merry to know any\r\nenjoyment in their senses.\r\n\r\nThough this part of time is absolutely necessary to sustain life, it\r\nmust be also considered, that life itself is to the endless being of\r\nman but what a meal is to this life, not valuable for itself, but\r\nfor the purpose of it. If there be any truth in this, the expense\r\nof many hours this way is somewhat unaccountable; and placing much\r\nthought either in too great sumptuousness and elegance in this matter,\r\nor wallowing in noise and riot at it, are both, though not equally,\r\nunaccountable. I have often considered these different people with very\r\ngreat attention, and always speak of them with the distinction of the\r\neaters and the swallowers. The eaters sacrifice all their senses and\r\nunderstanding to this appetite: the swallowers hurry themselves out of\r\nboth, without pleasing this or any other appetite at all. The latter\r\nare improved brutes, the former degenerated men. I have sometimes\r\nthought it would not be improper to add to my dead and living men,\r\npersons in an intermediate state of humanity, under the appellation of\r\ndozers. The dozers are a sect, who, instead of keeping their appetites\r\nin subjection, live in subjection to them; nay, they are so truly\r\nslaves to them, that they keep at too great a distance ever to come\r\ninto their presence. Within my own acquaintance, I know those that I\r\ndaresay have forgot that they ever were hungry, and are no less utter\r\nstrangers to thirst and weariness, who are beholden to sauces for their\r\nfood, and to their food for their weariness.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered, considering the excellent and choice spirits\r\nthat we have among our divines, that they do not think of putting\r\nvicious habits into a more contemptible and unlovely figure than\r\nthey do at present. So many men of wit and spirit as there are in\r\nsacred orders, have it in their power to make the fashion of their\r\nside. The leaders in human society are more effectually prevailed\r\nupon this way than can easily be imagined. I have more than one\r\nin my thoughts at this time capable of doing this against all the\r\nopposition of the most witty, as well as the most voluptuous. There\r\nmay possibly be more acceptable subjects, but sure there are none more\r\nuseful. It is visible, that though men's fortunes, circumstances, and\r\npleasures give them prepossessions too strong to regard any mention\r\neither of punishments or rewards, they will listen to what makes them\r\ninconsiderable or mean in the imaginations of others, and by degrees in\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nIt is certain such topics are to be touched upon in the light we mean,\r\nonly by men of the most consummate prudence, as well as excellent wit:\r\nfor these discourses are to be made, if made to run into example,\r\nbefore such as have their thoughts more intent upon the propriety than\r\nthe reason of the discourse. What indeed leads me into this way of\r\nthinking, is, that the last thing I read was a sermon of the learned\r\nDr. South,[32] upon the Ways of Pleasantness. This admirable discourse\r\nwas made at court, where the preacher was too wise a man not to\r\nbelieve; the greatest argument, in that place, against the pleasures\r\nthen in vogue, must be, that they lost greater pleasures by prosecuting\r\nthe course they were in. The charming discourse has in it whatever wit\r\nand wisdom can put together. This gentleman has a talent of making all\r\nhis faculties bear to the great end of his hallowed profession. Happy\r\ngenius! he is the better man for being a wit. The best way to praise\r\nthis author is to quote him; and, I think, I may defy any man to say a\r\ngreater thing of him, or his ability, than that there are no paragraphs\r\nin the whole discourse I speak of below these which follow.\r\n\r\nAfter having recommended the satisfaction of the mind, and the pleasure\r\nof conscience, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"An ennobling property of it is, that it is such a pleasure as never\r\nsatiates or wearies; for it properly affects the spirit, and a spirit\r\nfeels no weariness, as being privileged from the causes of it. But\r\ncan the epicure say so of any of the pleasures he so much dotes upon?\r\nDo they not expire while they satisfy, and after a few minutes'\r\nrefreshment determine in loathing and unquietness? How short is the\r\ninterval between a pleasure and a burden! How undiscernible the\r\ntransition from one to the other! Pleasure dwells no longer upon the\r\nappetite than the necessities of nature, which are quickly and easily\r\nprovided for; and then all that follows is a load and an oppression.\r\nEvery morsel to a satisfied hunger is only a new labour to a tired\r\ndigestion. Every draught to him that has quenched his thirst is but a\r\nfurther quenching of nature, and a provision for rheum and diseases, a\r\ndrowning of the quickness and activity of the spirits.\r\n\r\n\"He that prolongs his meals, and sacrifices his time, as well as\r\nhis other conveniences, to his luxury, how quickly does he outsit\r\nhis pleasure! And then, how is all the following time bestowed upon\r\nceremony and surfeit! Till at length, after a long fatigue of eating,\r\nand drinking, and babbling, he concludes the great work of dining\r\ngenteelly, and so makes a shift to rise from table, that he may lie\r\ndown upon his bed; where, after he has slept himself into some use of\r\nhimself, by much ado he staggers to his table again, and there acts\r\nover the same brutish scene: so that he passes his whole life in a\r\ndozed condition, between sleeping and waking, with a kind of drowsiness\r\nand confusion upon his senses, which, what pleasure it can be, is hard\r\nto conceive. All that is of it dwells upon the tip of his tongue, and\r\nwithin the compass of his palate. A worthy prize for a man to purchase\r\nwith the loss of his time, his reason, and himself!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Samuel Partiger Fuller was M.P. for Petersfield from 1715 to\r\n1722. Steele's letters show that he was an intimate friend of Fuller's\r\nin 1716-17; and in February 1716, when Steele spoke in the House of\r\nCommons on behalf of the noblemen condemned for the part they had taken\r\nin the rebellion of 1715, he was seconded by Fuller. The following\r\npassage from Steele's _Theatre_, No. 26, March 29, 1720, is the\r\nauthority for attributing this paper to young Fuller, then a secret\r\ncorrespondent:\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly conceive a more laudable act, than declaring an\r\nabhorrence of so fashionable a crime [viz., duelling], which weakness,\r\ncowardice, and an impatience of the reproach of fools, have brought\r\nupon reasonable men. This sort of behaviour cannot proceed but from a\r\ntrue and undaunted courage; and I cannot but have in great veneration\r\na generous youth, who, in public, declared his assent and concurrence\r\nto this law, by saying, that in spite of the prevailing custom, he\r\ntriumphed more in being a second to prevent, than he should have done\r\nin being one to promote murder. A speech thus ingenuous could come only\r\nfrom a heart that scorned reserves, in compliance to falsehood, to do\r\ninjury to truth.\r\n\r\n\"This was true greatness of mind; and the man who did it, could not\r\npossibly do it for his own sake, but must be conscious of a courage\r\nsufficient for his own defence, who could thus candidly, at this time\r\nof life, rescue other men from the necessity of bearing contempt, or\r\ndoing an ill action.\r\n\r\n\"The mind usually exerts itself in all its faculties with an equal pace\r\ntowards maturity; and this gentleman, who at the age of sixteen could\r\nform such pleasant pictures of the false and little ambitions of low\r\nspirits, as Mr. Fuller did, to whom, when a boy, we owe, with several\r\nother excellent pieces, \"The Vainglorious Glutton,\" when a secret\r\ncorrespondent of the _Tatler_: I say, such a one might easily, as he\r\nproceeded in human life, arrive at this superior strength of mind at\r\nfour-and-twenty. The soul that labours against prejudice, and follows\r\nreason, ripens in her capacities and grows in her talents at the same\r\ntime. As therefore courage is what a man attains by thought, as much as\r\nhe improves his wit by study, it is only from want of opportunities to\r\ncall the one or the other forth, and draw the respective qualities into\r\nhabit, if ever a man of sense is a coward.\"\r\n\r\n[32] See Nos. 61 and 211. In the _Guardian_ (No. 135), Addison quotes\r\nfrom South a passage which, he says, \"cannot but make the man's heart\r\nburn within him who reads it with due attention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 206.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Aug. 1_, to _Thursday, Aug. 3, 1710_.\r\n\r\n            Metiri se quemque suo modulo ac pede verum est.\r\n\r\n                                                    HOR., 1 Ep. vii. 98.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Aug. 2._\r\n\r\nThe general purposes of men in the conduct of their lives (I mean with\r\nrelation to this life only), end in gaining either the affection or the\r\nesteem of those with whom they converse. Esteem makes a man powerful in\r\nbusiness, and affection desirable in conversation; which is certainly\r\nthe reason that very agreeable men fail of their point in the world,\r\nand those who are by no means such arrive at it with much ease. If it\r\nbe visible in a man's carriage that he has a strong passion to please,\r\nno one is much at a loss how to keep measures with him, because there\r\nis always a balance in people's hands to make up with him, by giving\r\nhim what he still wants in exchange for what you think fit to deny him.\r\nSuch a person asks with diffidence, and ever leaves room for denial\r\nby that softness of his complexion. At the same time he himself is\r\ncapable of denying nothing, even what he is not able to perform. The\r\nother sort of man who courts esteem, having a quite different view,\r\nhas as different a behaviour, and acts as much by the dictates of his\r\nreason, as the other does by the impulse of his inclination. You must\r\npay for everything you have of him. He considers mankind as a people\r\nin commerce, and never gives out of himself what he is sure will not\r\ncome in with interest from another. All his words and actions tend to\r\nthe advancement of his reputation and of his fortune, toward which he\r\nmakes hourly progress, because he lavishes no part of his good-will\r\nupon such as do not make some advances to merit it. The man who values\r\naffection sometimes becomes popular, he who aims at esteem seldom fails\r\nof growing rich.\r\n\r\nThus far we have looked at these different men as persons who endeavour\r\nto be valued and beloved from design or ambition; but they appear in\r\nquite another figure, when you observe the men who are agreeable and\r\nvenerable from the force of their natural inclinations. We affect the\r\ncompany of him who has least regard of himself in his carriage, who\r\nthrows himself into unguarded gaiety, voluntary mirth, and general\r\ngood-humour; who has nothing in his head but the present hour, and\r\nseems to have all his interests and passions gratified, if every man\r\nelse in the room is as unconcerned as himself. This man usually has no\r\nquality or character among his companions; let him be born of whom\r\nhe will, have what great qualities he please, let him be capable of\r\nassuming for a moment what figure he pleases, he still dwells in the\r\nimagination of all who know him but as Jack Such-a-One. This makes Jack\r\nbrighten up the room wherever he enters, and change the severity of the\r\ncompany into that gaiety and good-humour into which his conversation\r\ngenerally leads them. It is not unpleasant to observe even this sort of\r\ncreature go out of his character, to check himself sometimes for his\r\nfamiliarities, and pretend so awkwardly at procuring to himself more\r\nesteem than he finds he meets with. I was the other day walking with\r\nJack Gainly towards Lincoln's Inn Walks. We met a fellow who is a lower\r\nofficer where Jack is in the direction. Jack cries to him, so, \"How is\r\nit, Mr. ----?\" He answers, \"Mr. Gainly, I am glad to see you well.\"\r\nThis expression of equality gave my friend a pang, which appeared in a\r\nflush of his countenance. \"Prithee, Jack,\" says I, \"do not be angry at\r\nthe man; for do what you will, the man can only love you: be contented\r\nwith the image the man has of thee; for if thou aimest at any other,\r\nit must be hatred or contempt.\" I went on, and told him, \"Look'ee,\r\nJack, I have heard thee sometimes talk like an oracle for half-an-hour,\r\nwith the sentiments of a Roman, the closeness of a school-man, and the\r\nintegrity of a divine; but then, Jack, while I admired thee, it was\r\nupon topics which did not concern thyself, and where the greatness of\r\nthe subject (added to thy being personally unconcerned in it) created\r\nall that was great in thy discourse.\" I did not mind his being a little\r\nout of humour, but comforted him, by giving him several instances of\r\nmen of our acquaintance, who had no one quality in any eminence, that\r\nwere much more esteemed than he was with very many: but the thing is,\r\nif your character is to give pleasure, men will consider you only in\r\nthat light, and not in those acts which turn to esteem and veneration.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of Jack Gainly, I cannot but reflect also upon his sister\r\nGatty. She is young, witty, pleasant, innocent. This is her natural\r\ncharacter; but when she observes any one admired for what they call\r\na fine woman, she is all the next day womanly, prudent, observing,\r\nand virtuous. She is every moment asked in her prudential behaviour,\r\nwhether she is not well? Upon which she as often answers in a fret,\r\n\"Do people think one must be always romping, always a Jack-pudding?\" I\r\nnever fail to inquire of her, if my Lady Such-a-One, that awful beauty,\r\nwas not at the play last night? She knows the connection between that\r\nquestion and her change of humour, and says, \"It would be very well,\r\nif some people would examine into themselves as much as they do into\r\nothers;\" or, \"Sure there is nothing in the world so ridiculous as an\r\namorous old man.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was saying, there is a class which every man is in by his post in\r\nnature, from which it is impossible for him to withdraw to another,\r\nand become it. Therefore it is necessary that each should be contented\r\nwith it, and not endeavour at any progress out of that tract. To\r\nfollow nature, is the only agreeable course; which is what I would\r\nfain inculcate to those jarring companions, Flavia and Lucia. They\r\nare mother and daughter. Flavia, who is the mamma, has all the charms\r\nand desires of youth still about her, and not much turned of thirty:\r\nLucia is blooming and amorous, and but a little above fifteen. The\r\nmother looks very much younger than she is, the girl very much older.\r\nIf it were possible to fix the girl to her sick-bed, and preserve the\r\nportion (the use of which the mother partakes), the good widow Flavia\r\nwould certainly do it. But for fear of Lucia's escape, the mother is\r\nforced to be constantly attended with a rival, that explains her age,\r\nand draws off the eyes of her admirers. The jest is, they can never\r\nbe together in strangers' company, but Lucy is eternally reprimanded\r\nfor something very particular in her behaviour; for which she has the\r\nmalice to say, she hopes she shall always obey her parents. She carried\r\nher passion and jealousy to that height the other day, that coming\r\nsuddenly into the room, and surprising Colonel Lofty speaking rapture\r\non one knee to her mother, she clapped down by him and asked her\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it is so proper to tell family occurrences of\r\nthis nature; but we every day see the same thing happen in the public\r\nconversation in the world. Men cannot be contented with what is\r\nlaudable, but they must have all that is laudable. This affectation is\r\nwhat destroys the familiar man into pretences to take state upon him,\r\nand the contrary character to the folly of aiming at being winning and\r\ncomplaisant. But in these cases men may easily lay aside what they are,\r\nbut can never arrive at what they are not.\r\n\r\nAs to the pursuits after affection and esteem, the fair sex are happy\r\nin this particular, that with them the one is much more nearly related\r\nto the other than in men. The love of a woman is inseparable from\r\nsome esteem of her; and as she is naturally the object of affection,\r\nthe woman who has your esteem has also some degree of your love.[33]\r\nA man that dotes on a woman for her beauty, will whisper his friend,\r\n\"That creature has a great deal of wit when you are well acquainted\r\nwith her.\" And if you examine the bottom of your esteem for a woman,\r\nyou will find you have a greater opinion of her beauty than anybody\r\nelse. As to us men, I design to pass most of my time with the facetious\r\nHarry Bickerstaff; but William Bickerstaff, the most prudent man of our\r\nfamily, shall be my executor.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] \"Inseparable always from his passion is the exalted admiration he\r\nfeels; and his love is the very flower of his respect\" (Forster's Essay\r\non Steele).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 207.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Thursday, Aug. 3_, to _Saturday, Aug. 5, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Aug. 4._\r\n\r\nHaving yesterday morning received a paper of Latin verses, written\r\nwith much elegance in honour of these my papers, and being informed\r\nat the same time that they were composed by a youth under age, I read\r\nthem with much delight, as an instance of his improvement. There is\r\nnot a greater pleasure to old age, than seeing young people entertain\r\nthemselves in such a manner as that we can partake of their enjoyments.\r\nOn such occasions we flatter ourselves that we are not quite laid aside\r\nin the world, but that we are either used with gratitude for what we\r\nwere, or honoured for what we are. A well-inclined young man, and whose\r\ngood-breeding is founded upon the principles of nature and virtue,\r\nmust needs take delight in being agreeable to his elders, as we are\r\ntruly delighted when we are not the jest of them. When I say this, I\r\nmust confess I cannot but think it a very lamentable thing that there\r\nshould be a necessity for making that a rule of life, which should\r\nbe, methinks, a mere instinct of nature. If reflection upon a man in\r\npoverty, whom we once knew in riches, is an argument of commiseration\r\nwith generous minds; sure old age, which is a decay from that vigour\r\nwhich the young possess, and must certainly (if not prevented against\r\ntheir will) arrive at, should be more forcibly the object of that\r\nreverence which honest spirits are inclined to from a sense of being\r\nthemselves liable to what they observe has already overtaken others.\r\n\r\nMy three nephews, whom in June last was twelvemonth I disposed of\r\naccording to their several capacities and inclinations, the first to\r\nthe University, the second to a merchant, and the third to a woman\r\nof quality as her page, by my invitation dined with me to-day. It\r\nis my custom often, when I have a mind to give myself a more than\r\nordinary cheerfulness, to invite a certain young gentlewoman of our\r\nneighbourhood to make one of the company. She did me that favour this\r\nday. The presence of a beautiful woman of honour, to minds which\r\nare not trivially disposed, displays an alacrity which is not to be\r\ncommunicated by any other object. It was not unpleasant to me to look\r\ninto her thoughts of the company she was in. She smiled at the party\r\nof pleasure I had thought of for her, which was composed of an old\r\nman and three boys. My scholar, my citizen, and myself were very soon\r\nneglected; and the young courtier, by the bow he made to her at her\r\nentrance, engaged her observation without a rival. I observed the\r\nOxonian not a little discomposed at this preference, while the trader\r\nkept his eye upon his uncle. My nephew Will had a thousand secret\r\nresolutions to break in upon the discourse of his younger brother,\r\nwho gave my fair companion a full account of the fashion, and what\r\nwas reckoned most becoming to this complexion, and what sort of habit\r\nappeared best upon the other shape. He proceeded to acquaint her,\r\nwho of quality was well or sick within the bills of mortality, and\r\nnamed very familiarly all his lady's acquaintance, not forgetting\r\nher very words when he spoke of their characters. Besides all this,\r\nhe had a road of flattery; and upon her inquiring what sort of woman\r\nLady Lovely was in her person, \"Really, madam,\" says the jackanapes,\r\n\"she is exactly of your height and shape; but as you are fair, she is\r\na brown woman.\" There was no enduring that this fop should outshine\r\nus all at this unmerciful rate, therefore I thought fit to talk to\r\nmy young scholar concerning his studies; and because I would throw\r\nhis learning into present service, I desired him to repeat to me the\r\ntranslation he had made of some tender verses in Theocritus. He did so,\r\nwith an air of elegance peculiar to the college to which I sent him.\r\nI made some exceptions to the turn of the phrases, which he defended\r\nwith much modesty, as believing in that place the matter was rather to\r\nconsult the softness of a swain's passion, than the strength of his\r\nexpressions. It soon appeared that Will had outstripped his brother\r\nin the opinion of our young lady. A little poetry to one who is bred\r\na scholar has the same effect that a good carriage of his person has\r\non one who is to live in courts. The favour of women is so natural a\r\npassion, that I envied both the boys their success in the approbation\r\nof my guest; and I thought the only person invulnerable was my young\r\ntrader. During the whole meal, I could observe in the children a mutual\r\ncontempt and scorn of each other, arising from their different way of\r\nlife and education, and took that occasion to advertise them of such\r\ngrowing distastes, which might mislead them in their future life, and\r\ndisappoint their friends, as well as themselves, of the advantages\r\nwhich might be expected from the diversity of their professions and\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe prejudices which are growing up between these brothers from\r\nthe different ways of education, are what create the most fatal\r\nmisunderstandings in life. But all distinctions of disparagement merely\r\nfrom our circumstances, are such as will not bear the examination of\r\nreason. The courtier, the trader, and the scholar should all have an\r\nequal pretension to the denomination of a gentleman. That tradesman\r\nwho deals with me in a commodity which I do not understand with\r\nuprightness, has much more right to that character, than the courtier\r\nwho gives me false hopes, or the scholar who laughs at my ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe appellation of gentleman is never to be affixed to a man's\r\ncircumstances, but to his behaviour in them. For this reason I shall\r\never, as far as I am able, give my nephews such impressions as shall\r\nmake them value themselves rather as they are useful to others, than as\r\nthey are conscious of merit in themselves. There are no qualities from\r\nwhich we ought to pretend to the esteem of others, but such as render\r\nus serviceable to them; for free men have no superiors but benefactors.\r\nI was going on like a true old fellow to this purpose to my guests,\r\nwhen I received the following epistle:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I have yours,[34] with notice of a benefit ticket of £400 per annum,\r\nboth enclosed by Mr. Elliot, who had my numbers for that purpose. Your\r\nphilosophic advice came very seasonably to me with that good fortune;\r\nbut I must be so sincere with you as to acknowledge, I owe my present\r\nmoderation more to my own folly than your wisdom. You will think this\r\nstrange till I inform you, that I had fixed my thoughts upon the £1000\r\na year, and had with that expectation laid down so many agreeable\r\nplans for my behaviour towards my new lovers and old friends, that I\r\nhave received this favour of fortune with an air of disappointment.\r\nThis is interpreted by all who know not the springs of my heart as a\r\nwonderful piece of humility. I hope my present state of mind will grow\r\ninto that; but I confess my conduct to be now owing to another cause.\r\nHowever, I know you will approve my taking hold even of imperfections\r\nto find my way towards virtue, which is so feeble in us at the best,\r\nthat we are often beholden to our faults for the first appearances of\r\nit. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n            \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n                                          \"CHLOE.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] See No. 203.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 208.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Aug. 5_, to _Tuesday, Aug. 8, 1710_.\r\n\r\nSi dixeris \"æstuo,\" sudat.----\r\n\r\n                                                    JUV., Sat. iii. 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment Aug. 7._\r\n\r\nAn old acquaintance who met me this morning seemed overjoyed to see\r\nme, and told me, I looked as well as he had known me do these forty\r\nyears: but, continued he, \"not quite the man you were when we visited\r\ntogether at Lady Brightly's. Oh, Isaac! those days are over. Do you\r\nthink there are any such fine creatures now living as we then conversed\r\nwith?\" He went on with a thousand incoherent circumstances, which, in\r\nhis imagination, must needs please me; but they had the quite contrary\r\neffect. The flattery with which he began, in telling me how well I\r\nwore, was not disagreeable; but his indiscreet mention of a set of\r\nacquaintances we had outlived, recalled ten thousand things to my\r\nmemory, which made me reflect upon my present condition with regret.\r\nHad he indeed been so kind as, after a long absence, to felicitate me\r\nupon an indolent and easy old age, and mentioned how much he and I had\r\nto thank for, who at our time of day could walk firmly, eat heartily,\r\nand converse cheerfully, he had kept up my pleasure in myself. But\r\nof all mankind there are none so shocking as these injudicious civil\r\npeople. They ordinarily begin upon something that they know must be\r\na satisfaction; but then, for fear of the imputation of flattery,\r\nthey follow it with the last thing in the world of which you would be\r\nreminded. It is this that perplexes civil persons. The reason that\r\nthere is such a general outcry amongst us against flatterers, is, that\r\nthere are so very few good ones. It is the nicest art in this life,\r\nand is a part of eloquence which does not want the preparation that is\r\nnecessary to all other parts of it, that your audience should be your\r\nwell-wishers: for praise from an enemy is the most pleasing of all\r\ncommendations.\r\n\r\nIt is generally to be observed, that the person most agreeable to a\r\nman for a constancy is he that has no shining qualities, but is a\r\ncertain degree above great imperfections, whom he can live with as\r\nhis inferior, and who will either overlook or not observe his little\r\ndefects. Such an easy companion as this, either now and then throws\r\nout a little flattery, or lets a man silently flatter himself in his\r\nsuperiority to him. If you take notice, there is hardly a rich man in\r\nthe world who has not such a led friend[35] of small consideration,\r\nwho is a darling for his insignificancy. It is a great ease to have\r\none in our own shape a species below us, and who, without being listed\r\nin our service, is by nature of our retinue. These dependants are of\r\nexcellent use on a rainy day, or when a man has not a mind to dress\r\nor to exclude solitude, when one has neither a mind to that or to\r\ncompany. There are of this good-natured order who are so kind as to\r\ndivide themselves, and do these good offices to many. Five or six\r\nof them visit a whole quarter of the town, and exclude the spleen\r\nwithout fees from the families they frequent. If they do not prescribe\r\nphysic, they can be company when you take it. Very great benefactors\r\nto the rich, or those whom they call people at their ease, are your\r\npersons of no consequence. I have known some of them, by the help of a\r\nlittle cunning, make delicious flatterers. They know the course of the\r\ntown and the general characters of persons: by this means they will\r\nsometimes tell the most agreeable falsehoods imaginable. They will\r\nacquaint you, that such a one of a quite contrary party said, that\r\nthough you were engaged in different interests, yet he had the greatest\r\nrespect for your good sense and address. When one of these has a little\r\ncunning, he passes his time in the utmost satisfaction to himself and\r\nhis friends: for his position is never to report or speak a displeasing\r\nthing to his friend. As for letting him go on in an error, he knows\r\nadvice against them is the office of persons of greater talents and\r\nless discretion.\r\n\r\nThe Latin word for a flatterer (_assentator_) implies no more than\r\na person that barely consents; and indeed such a one, if a man were\r\nable to purchase or maintain him, cannot be bought too dear. Such a\r\none never contradicts you, but gains upon you, not by a fulsome way\r\nof commending you in broad terms, but liking whatever you propose or\r\nutter; at the same time is ready to beg your pardon, and gainsay you,\r\nif you chance to speak ill of yourself. An old lady is very seldom\r\nwithout such a companion as this, who can recite the names of all her\r\nlovers, and the matches refused by her in the days when she minded such\r\nvanities (as she is pleased to call them, though she so much approves\r\nthe mention of them). It is to be noted, that a woman's flatterer is\r\ngenerally older than herself, her years serving at once to recommend\r\nher patroness's age, and to add weight to her complaisance in all other\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nWe gentlemen of small fortunes are extremely necessitous in this\r\nparticular. I have indeed one who smokes with me often; but his parts\r\nare so low, that all the incense he does me is to fill his pipe with\r\nme, and to be out at just as many whiffs as I take. This is all the\r\npraise or assent that he is capable of, yet there are more hours when I\r\nwould rather be in his company than that of the brightest man I know.\r\nIt would be a hard matter to give an account of this inclination to be\r\nflattered; but if we go to the bottom of it, we shall find that the\r\npleasure in it is something like that of receiving money which lay out.\r\nEvery man thinks he has an estate of reputation, and is glad to see one\r\nthat will bring any of it home to him: it is no matter how dirty a bag\r\nit is conveyed to him in, or by how clownish a messenger, so the money\r\nis good. All that we want to be pleased with flattery, is to believe\r\nthat the man is sincere who gives it us. It is by this one accident\r\nthat absurd creatures often outrun the more skilful in this art. Their\r\nwant of ability is here an advantage, and their bluntness, as it is the\r\nseeming effect of sincerity, is the best cover to artifice.\r\n\r\nTerence introduces a flatterer talking to a coxcomb whom he cheats out\r\nof a livelihood, and a third person on the stage makes on him this\r\npleasant remark, \"This fellow has an art of making fools madmen.\"[36]\r\nThe love of flattery is indeed sometimes the weakness of a great mind;\r\nbut you see it also in persons who otherwise discover no manner of\r\nrelish of anything above mere sensuality. These latter it sometimes\r\nimproves, but always debases the former. A fool is in himself the\r\nobject of pity till he is flattered. By the force of that his stupidity\r\nis raised into affectation, and he becomes of dignity enough to be\r\nridiculous. I remember a droll, that upon one's saying, \"The times\r\nare so ticklish that there must great care be taken what one says in\r\nconversation,\" answered with an air of surliness and honesty, \"If\r\npeople will be free, let them be so in the manner that I am, who never\r\nabuse a man but to his face.\" He had no reputation for saying dangerous\r\ntruths; therefore when it was repeated, \"You abuse a man but to his\r\nface?\" \"Yes,\" says he, \"I flatter him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is indeed the greatest of injuries to flatter any but the unhappy,\r\nor such as are displeased with themselves for some infirmity. In this\r\nlatter case we have a member of our club, that when Sir Jeffery falls\r\nasleep, wakens him with snoring. This makes Sir Jeffery hold up for\r\nsome moments the longer, to see there are men younger than himself\r\namong us who are more lethargic than he is.\r\n\r\nWhen flattery is practised upon any other consideration, it is the most\r\nabject thing in nature; nay, I cannot think of any character below the\r\nflatterer, except he that envies him. You meet with fellows prepared\r\nto be as mean as possible in their condescensions and expressions;\r\nbut they want persons and talents to rise up to such a baseness. As a\r\ncoxcomb is a fool of parts, so is a flatterer a knave of parts.\r\n\r\nThe best of this order that I know, is one who disguises it under a\r\nspirit of contradiction or reproof. He told an errant driveller the\r\nother day, that he did not care for being in company with him, because\r\nhe heard he turned his absent friends into ridicule. And upon Lady\r\nAutumn's[37] disputing with him about something that happened at the\r\nRevolution, he replied with a very angry tone, \"Pray, madam, give me\r\nleave to know more of a thing in which I was actually concerned, than\r\nyou, who were then in your nurse's arms.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] A hanger-on.

For this purpose I have pitched upon that\r\nremarkable incident between Alexander the Great and his physician.\r\nThis Prince, in the midst of his conquests in Persia, was seized by a\r\nviolent fever; and according to the account we have of his vast mind,\r\nhis thoughts were more employed about his recovery as it regarded the\r\nwar, than as it concerned his own life. He professed, a slow method\r\nwas worse than death to him, because it was what he more dreaded, an\r\ninterruption of his glory. He desired a dangerous, so it might be a\r\nspeedy remedy. During this impatience of the King, it is well known\r\nthat Darius had offered an immense sum to any who should take away\r\nhis life. But Philippus, the most esteemed and most knowing of his\r\nphysicians, promised, that within three days' time he would prepare a\r\nmedicine for him which should restore him more expeditiously than could\r\nbe imagined. Immediately after this engagement, Alexander receives a\r\nletter from the most considerable of his captains, with intelligence,\r\nthat Darius had bribed Philippus to poison him. Every circumstance\r\nimaginable favoured this suspicion; but this monarch, who did nothing\r\nbut in an extraordinary manner, concealed the letter; and while the\r\nmedicine was preparing, spent all his thoughts upon his behaviour\r\nin this important incident. From his long soliloquy he came to this\r\nresolution: \"Alexander must not lie here alive to be oppressed by his\r\nenemy. I will not believe my physician guilty; or, I will perish rather\r\nby his guilt than my own diffidence.\"\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour, Philippus enters with the potion. One cannot\r\nbut form to one's self on occasion the encounter of their eyes,\r\nthe resolution in those of the patient, and the benevolence in the\r\ncountenance of the physician. The hero raised himself in his bed, and\r\nholding the letter in one hand, and the potion in the other, drank\r\nthe medicine. It will exercise my friend's pencil and brain to place\r\nthis action in its proper beauty. A prince observing the features of\r\na suspected traitor after having drank the poison he offered him, is\r\na circumstance so full of passion, that it will require the highest\r\nstrength of his imagination to conceive it, much more to express it.\r\nBut as painting is eloquence and poetry in mechanism, I shall raise\r\nhis ideas, by reading with him the finest draughts of the passions\r\nconcerned in this circumstance from the most excellent poets and\r\norators. The confidence which Alexander assumes from the air of\r\nPhilippus's face as he is reading his accusation, and the generous\r\ndisdain which is to rise in the features of a falsely accused man, are\r\nprincipally to be regarded. In this particular he must heighten his\r\nthoughts, by reflecting, that he is not drawing only an innocent man\r\ntraduced, but a man zealously affected to his person and safety, full\r\nof resentment for being thought false. How shall we contrive to express\r\nthe highest admiration mingled with disdain? How shall we in strokes of\r\na pencil say what Philippus did to his Prince on this occasion? \"Sir,\r\nmy life never depended on yours more than it does now. Without knowing\r\nthis secret, I prepared the potion, which you have taken as what\r\nconcerned Philippus no less than Alexander; and there is nothing new in\r\nthis adventure, but that it makes me still more admire the generosity\r\nand confidence of my master.\" Alexander took him by the hand, and\r\nsaid, \"Philippus, I am confident you had rather I had any other way to\r\nhave manifested the faith I have in you, than a case which so nearly\r\nconcerns me: and in gratitude I now assure you, I am anxious for the\r\neffect of your medicine, more for your sake than my own.\"[38]\r\n\r\nMy painter is employed by a man of sense and wealth to furnish him a\r\ngallery, and I shall join with my friend in the designing part. It is\r\nthe great use of pictures to raise in our minds either agreeable ideas\r\nof our absent friends, or high images of eminent personages. But the\r\nlatter design is, methinks, carried on in a very improper way; for to\r\nfill a room full of battle-pieces, pompous histories of sieges, and\r\na tall hero alone in a crowd of insignificant figures about him, is\r\nof no consequence to private men. But to place before our eyes great\r\nand illustrious men in those parts and circumstances of life wherein\r\ntheir behaviour may have an effect upon our minds, as being such as\r\nwe partake with them merely as they were men: such as these, I say,\r\nmay be just and useful ornaments of an elegant apartment. In this\r\ncollection therefore that we are making, we will not have the battles,\r\nbut the sentiments of Alexander. The affair we were just now talking\r\nof, has circumstances of the highest nature, and yet their grandeur has\r\nlittle to do with his fortune. If by observing such a piece as that of\r\nhis taking a bowl of poison with so much magnanimity, a man, the next\r\ntime he has a fit of the spleen, is less froward to his friend or his\r\nservants; thus far is some improvement.\r\n\r\nI have frequently thought, that if we had many draughts which were\r\nhistorical of certain passions, and had the true figure of the great\r\nmen we see transported by them, it would be of the most solid advantage\r\nimaginable. To consider this mighty man on one occasion administer to\r\nthe wants of a poor soldier, benumbed with cold, with the greatest\r\nhumanity; at another, barbarously stabbing a faithful officer: at\r\none time, so generously chaste and virtuous as to give his captive\r\nStatira her liberty; at another, burning a town at the instigation of\r\nThais--this sort of changes in the same person are what would be more\r\nbeneficial lessons of morality than the several revolutions in a great\r\nman's fortune. There are but one or two in an age to whom the pompous\r\nincidents of his life can be exemplary; but I or any man may be as\r\nsick, as good-natured, as compassionate, and as angry as Alexander the\r\nGreat. My purpose in all this chat is, that so excellent a furniture\r\nmay not for the future have so romantic a turn, but allude to incidents\r\nwhich come within the fortunes of the ordinary race of men. I do not\r\nknow but it is by the force of this senseless custom that people are\r\ndrawn in postures they would not for half they are worth be surprised\r\nin. The unparalleled fierceness of some rural squires drawn in red,\r\nor in armour, who never dreamed to destroy anything above a fox, is a\r\ncommon and ordinary offence of this kind. But I shall give an account\r\nof our whole gallery on another occasion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Q.

She went so far as to fall foul on a young woman who has\r\nhad imputations; but whether they were just or not, no one knows but\r\nherself. However that is, she is in her present behaviour modest,\r\nhumble, pious, and discreet. I thought it became me to bring this\r\ncensorious lady to reason, and let her see she was a much more vicious\r\nwoman than the person she spoke of.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said I, \"you are very severe to this poor young woman, for a\r\ntrespass which I believe Heaven has forgiven her, and for which you\r\nsee she is for ever out of countenance.\" \"Nay, Mr. Bickerstaff,\" she\r\ninterrupted, \"if you at this time of day contradict people of virtue,\r\nand stand up for ill women--\" \"No, no, madam,\" said I, \"not so fast;\r\nshe is reclaimed, and I fear you never will be. Nay, nay, madam, do not\r\nbe in a passion, but let me tell you what you are. You are indeed as\r\ngood as your neighbours, but that is being very bad. You are a woman at\r\nthe head of a family, and lead a perfect town lady's life. You go on\r\nyour own way, and consult nothing but your glass. What imperfections\r\nindeed you see there, you immediately mend as fast as you can. You may\r\ndo the same by the faults I tell you of, for they are much more in your\r\npower to correct.\r\n\r\n\"You are to know, then, that you visiting ladies, that carry your\r\nvirtue from house to house with so much prattle in each other's\r\napplause, and triumph over other people's faults, I grant you have but\r\nthe speculation of vice in your own conversations, but promote the\r\npractice of it in all others you have to do with.\r\n\r\n\"As for you, madam, your time passes away in dressing, eating,\r\nsleeping, and praying. When you rise in a morning, I grant you an hour\r\nspent very well; but you come out to dress in so froward a humour,\r\nthat the poor girl who attends you, curses her very being in that she\r\nis your servant, for the peevish things you say to her; when this poor\r\ncreature is put into a way, that good or evil are regarded but as they\r\nrelieve her from the hours she has and must pass with you. The next you\r\nhave to do with is your coachman and footmen. They convey your ladyship\r\nto church. While you are praying there, they are cursing, swearing,\r\nand drinking in an alehouse. During the time also which your ladyship\r\nsets apart for heaven, you are to know, that your cook is swearing and\r\nfretting in preparation for your dinner. Soon after your meal you make\r\nvisits, and the whole world that belongs to you speaks all the ill of\r\nyou which you are repeating of others. You see, madam, whatever way you\r\ngo, all about you are in a very broad one. The morality of these people\r\nit is your proper business to inquire into; and till you reform them,\r\nyou had best let your equals alone; otherwise, if I allow you you are\r\nnot vicious, you must allow me you are not virtuous.\"\r\n\r\nI took my leave, and received at my coming home the following letter:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"I have lived a pure and undefiled virgin these twenty-seven years; and\r\nI assure you, 'tis with great grief and sorrow of heart I tell you,\r\nthat I become weary and impatient of the derision of the gigglers of\r\nour sex, who call me old maid, and tell me I shall lead apes.[39] If\r\nyou are truly a patron of the distressed, and an adept in astrology,\r\nyou will advise whether I shall or ought to be prevailed upon by the\r\nimpertinencies of my own sex, to give way to the importunities of\r\nyours. I assure you, I am surrounded with both, though at present a\r\nforlorn.\r\n\r\n\"I am, &c.\"\r\n\r\nI must defer my answer to this lady out of a point of chronology. She\r\nsays, she has been twenty-seven years a maid; but I fear, according\r\nto a common error, she dates her virginity from her birth, which is a\r\nvery erroneous method; for a woman of twenty is no more to be thought\r\nchaste so many years, than a man of that age can be said to have been\r\nso long valiant. We must not allow people the favour of a virtue till\r\nthey have been under the temptation to the contrary. A woman is not\r\na maid till her birthday, as we call it, of her fifteenth year. My\r\nplaintiff is therefore desired to inform me, whether she is at present\r\nin her twenty-eighth or forty-third year, and she shall be despatched\r\naccordingly.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Aug. 11._[41]\r\n\r\nA merchant came hither this morning, and read a letter from a\r\ncorrespondent of his at Milan. It was dated of the 7th instant, N.S.\r\nThe following is an abstract of it: On the 25th of the last month, five\r\nthousand men were on their march in the Lampourdan, under the command\r\nof General Wesell, having received orders from his Catholic Majesty to\r\njoin him in his camp with all possible expedition. The Duke of Anjou\r\nsoon had intelligence of their motion, and took a resolution to decamp,\r\nin order to intercept them, within a day's march of our army. The King\r\nof Spain was apprehensive the enemy might make such a movement, and\r\ncommanded General Stanhope[42] with a body of horse, consisting of\r\nfourteen squadrons, to observe their course, and prevent their passage\r\nover the rivers Segre and Noguera between Lerida and Balaguer. It\r\nhappened to be the first day that officer had appeared abroad after\r\na dangerous and violent fever; but he received the King's commands\r\non this occasion with a joy which surmounted his present weakness,\r\nand on the 27th of last month came up with the enemy on the plains\r\nof Balaguer. The Duke of Anjou's rear-guard consisting of twenty-six\r\nsquadrons, that general sent intelligence of their posture to the King,\r\nand desired his Majesty's orders to attack them. During the time which\r\nhe waited for his instructions, he made his disposition for the charge,\r\nwhich was to divide themselves into three bodies; one to be commanded\r\nby himself in the centre, a body on the right by Count Maurice of\r\nNassau, and the third on the left by the Earl of Rochford.[43] Upon the\r\nreceipt of his Majesty's direction to attack the enemy, the general\r\nhimself charged with the utmost vigour and resolution, while the Earl\r\nof Rochford and Count Maurice extended themselves on his right and\r\nleft, to prevent the advantage the enemy might make of the superiority\r\nof their numbers. What appears to have misled the enemy's general\r\nin this affair was, that it was not supposed practicable that the\r\nconfederates would attack him till they had received a reinforcement.\r\nFor this reason he pursued his march without facing about, till we\r\nwere actually coming on to engagement. General Stanhope's disposition\r\nmade it impracticable to do it at that time, Count Maurice and the\r\nEarl of Rochford attacking them in the instant in which they were\r\nforming themselves. The charge was made with the greatest gallantry,\r\nand the enemy very soon put into so great disorder, that their whole\r\ncavalry were commanded to support their rear-guard. Upon the advance\r\nof this reinforcement, all the horse of the King of Spain were come\r\nup to sustain General Stanhope, insomuch that the battle improved\r\nto a general engagement of the cavalry of both armies. After a warm\r\ndispute for some time, it ended in the utter defeat of all the Duke\r\nof Anjou's horse. Upon the despatch of these advices, that Prince was\r\nretiring towards Lerida. We have no account of any considerable loss on\r\nour side, except that both those heroic youths, the Earl of Rochford\r\nand Count Nassau, fell in this action. They were, you know, both sons\r\nof persons who had a great place in the confidence of your late King\r\nWilliam; and I doubt not but their deaths will endear their families,\r\nwhich were ennobled by him, in your nation. General Stanhope has been\r\nreported by the enemy dead of his wounds; but he received only a slight\r\ncontusion on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"_P.S._--We acknowledge you here a mighty brave people; but you are\r\nsaid to love quarrelling so well, that you cannot be quiet at home. The\r\nfavourers of the House of Bourbon among us affirm, that this Stanhope,\r\nwho could as it were get out of his sick-bed to fight against their\r\nKing of Spain, must be of the anti-monarchical party.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] Lady Strafford, writing in 1712, says: \"Sis Betty ... hopes you'll\r\nprovide her a husband against she comes, for she begins to be in fears\r\nof leading apes in hell\" (\"Wentworth Papers,\" 285).\r\n\r\n[40] See reply in No. 212.\r\n\r\n[41] The fifth paper of the first volume of the _Examiner_ is a\r\ncritique on this article, with a comparison of the account of the same\r\nevents given in the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\"We too are sorry,\" says the writer, \"for the loss of the Earl of\r\nRochford; but I am afraid Isaac Bickerstaff, who now compliments him\r\nwith the title of 'heroic youth,' has forgot the _Tatler_ of Tun, Gun,\r\nand Pistol.\" This seems to allude to No. 24.\r\n\r\nIn the conclusion of the paper, Steele is reproached for meddling\r\nwith matters of State, and warned in a contemptuous manner, with a\r\nreference, no doubt, to his being gazetteer, &c., to take care of\r\nhimself. Arguments of a different kind, it is said, were made use of\r\nabout this time, to detach Steele from his party, equally in vain.\r\n\r\n[42] James Stanhope, who became Secretary of State on the accession\r\nof George I., and Earl Stanhope in 1718, had been appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the British forces in Spain in 1708. He died in\r\n1721.\r\n\r\n[43] William, second Earl of Rochford, brigadier-general, was\r\nthirty-six years of age when he was killed at the battle of Almenara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 211.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Aug. 12_, to _Tuesday, Aug. 15, 1710_.\r\n\r\n                 ----Nequeo monstrare et sentio tantum.\r\n\r\n                                                     JUV., Sat. vii. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday, Aug. 13._\r\n\r\nIf there were no other consequence of it, but barely that human\r\ncreatures on this day assemble themselves before their Creator, without\r\nregard to their usual employments, their minds at leisure from the\r\ncares of this life, and their bodies adorned with the best attire\r\nthey can bestow on them; I say, were this mere outward celebration of\r\na Sabbath all that is expected from men, even that were a laudable\r\ndistinction, and a purpose worthy the human nature. But when there is\r\nadded to it the sublime pleasure of devotion, our being is exalted\r\nabove itself; and he who spends a seventh day in the contemplation of\r\nthe next life, will not easily fall into the corruptions of this in\r\nthe other six. They who never admit thoughts of this kind into their\r\nimagination, lose higher and sweeter satisfactions than can be raised\r\nby any other entertainment. The most illiterate man who is touched\r\nwith devotion, and uses frequent exercises of it, contracts a certain\r\ngreatness of mind, mingled with a noble simplicity, that raises him\r\nabove those of the same condition; and there is an indelible mark of\r\ngoodness in those who sincerely possess it. It is hardly possible it\r\nshould be otherwise; for the fervours of a pious mind will naturally\r\ncontract such an earnestness and attention towards a better being,\r\nas will make the ordinary passages of life go off with a becoming\r\nindifference. By this, a man in the lowest condition will not appear\r\nmean, or in the most splendid fortune, insolent.\r\n\r\nAs to all the intricacies and vicissitudes under which men are\r\nordinarily entangled with the utmost sorrow and passion, one who is\r\ndevoted to Heaven when he falls into such difficulties is led by a\r\nclue through a labyrinth. As to this world, he does not pretend to\r\nskill in the mazes of it, but fixes his thoughts upon one certainty,\r\nthat he shall soon be out of it. And we may ask very boldly, What can\r\nbe a more sure consolation than to have a hope in death? When men are\r\narrived at thinking of their very dissolution with pleasure, how few\r\nthings are there that can be terrible to them? Certainly nothing can\r\nbe dreadful to such spirits, but what would make death terrible to\r\nthem, falsehood towards man, or impiety towards Heaven. To such as\r\nthese, as there are certainly many such, the gratifications of innocent\r\npleasures are doubled, even with reflections upon their imperfection.\r\nThe disappointments which naturally attend the great promises we make\r\nourselves in expected enjoyments, strike no damp upon such men, but\r\nonly quicken their hopes of soon knowing joys, which are too pure to\r\nadmit of allay or satiety.\r\n\r\nIt is thought among the politer part of mankind an imperfection to want\r\na relish of any of those things which refine our lives. This is the\r\nfoundation of the acceptance which eloquence, music, and poetry make\r\nin the world; and I know not why devotion, considered merely as an\r\nexaltation of our happiness, should not at least be so far regarded as\r\nto be considered. It is possible the very inquiry would lead men into\r\nsuch thoughts and gratifications as they did not expect to meet with\r\nin this place. Many a good acquaintance has been lost from a general\r\nprepossession in his disfavour, and a severe aspect has often hid under\r\nit a very agreeable companion.\r\n\r\nThere are no distinguishing qualities among men to which there are\r\nnot false pretenders; but though none is more pretended to than that\r\nof devotion, there are, perhaps, fewer successful impostors in this\r\nkind than any other. There is something so natively great and good\r\nin a person that is truly devout, that an awkward man may as well\r\npretend to be genteel, as a hypocrite to be pious. The constraint in\r\nwords and actions are equally visible in both cases, and anything set\r\nup in their room does but remove the endeavourers the further off\r\ntheir pretensions. But however the sense of true piety is abated,\r\nthere is no other motive of action that can carry us through all the\r\nvicissitudes of life with alacrity and resolution. But piety, like\r\nphilosophy, when it is superficial, does but make men appear the worse\r\nfor it; and a principle that is but half received, does but distract,\r\ninstead of guiding our behaviour. When I reflect upon the unequal\r\nconduct of Lotius, I see many things that run directly counter to his\r\ninterest; therefore I cannot attribute his labours for the public good\r\nto ambition. When I consider his disregard to his fortune, I cannot\r\nesteem him covetous. How then can I reconcile his neglect of himself,\r\nand his zeal for others? I have long suspected him to be a little\r\npious: but no man ever hid his vice with greater caution than he does\r\nhis virtue. It was the praise of a great Roman, that he had rather be,\r\nthan appear good. But such is the weakness of Lotius, that I dare say,\r\nhe had rather be esteemed irreligious than devout. By I know not what\r\nimpatience of raillery he is wonderfully fearful of being thought too\r\ngreat a believer. A hundred little devices are made use of to hide a\r\ntime of private devotion; and he will allow you any suspicion of his\r\nbeing ill employed, so you do not tax him with being well. But alas!\r\nhow mean is such a behaviour? To boast of virtue is a most ridiculous\r\nway of disappointing the merit of it, but not so pitiful as that of\r\nbeing ashamed of it. How unhappy is the wretch who makes the most\r\nabsolute and independent motive of action the cause of perplexity and\r\ninconstancy? How much another figure does Cælicola[44] make with all\r\nwho know him? His great and superior mind, frequently exalted by the\r\nraptures of heavenly meditation, is to all his friends of the same use\r\nas if an angel were to appear at the decision of their disputes. They\r\nvery well understand he is as much disinterested and unbiassed as such\r\na being. He considers all applications made to him, as those addresses\r\nwill effect his own application to heaven. All his determinations are\r\ndelivered with a beautiful humility; and he pronounces his decisions\r\nwith the air of one who is more frequently a supplicant than a judge.\r\n\r\nThus humble, and thus great, is the man who is moved by piety, and\r\nexalted by devotion. But behold this recommended by the masterly hand\r\nof a great divine[45] I have heretofore made bold with:\r\n\r\n\"It is such a pleasure as can never cloy or overwork the mind; a\r\ndelight that grows and improves under thought and reflection; and\r\nwhile it exercises, does also endear itself to the mind. All pleasures\r\nthat affect the body must needs weary, because they transport; and\r\nall transportation is a violence; and no violence can be lasting, but\r\ndetermines upon the falling of the spirits, which are not able to keep\r\nup that height of motion that the pleasure of the senses raises them\r\nto. And therefore how inevitably does an immoderate laughter end in a\r\nsigh, which is only nature's recovering itself after a force done to\r\nit; but the religious pleasure of a well-disposed mind moves gently,\r\nand therefore constantly. It does not effect by rapture and ecstasy,\r\nbut is like the pleasure of health, greater and stronger than those\r\nthat call up the senses with grosser and more affecting impressions.\r\nNo man's body is as strong as his appetites; but Heaven has corrected\r\nthe boundlessness of his voluptuous desires by stinting his strengths,\r\nand contracting his capacities.... The pleasure of the religious man\r\nis an easy and a portable pleasure, such a one as he carries about in\r\nhis bosom, without alarming either the eye or envy of the world. A man\r\nputting all his pleasure into this one, is like a traveller putting all\r\nhis goods into one jewel; the value is the same, and the convenience\r\ngreater.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] Possibly John Hughes, author of the \"Siege of Damascus,\" who\r\ncontributed to both _Tatler_ and _Spectator_. He died in 1720, aged\r\nforty-seven. In the _Theatre_ (No. 15) Steele said that Hughes's \"head,\r\nhand, or heart was always employed in something worthy imitation.\"\r\n\r\n[45] Dr. South (see Nos. 61 and 205).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 212.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Tuesday, Aug. 15_, to _Thursday, Aug. 17, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Aug. 16._\r\n\r\nI have had much importunity to answer the following letter:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"Reading over a volume of yours, I find the words _simplex munditiis_\r\nmentioned as a description of a very well-dressed woman.[46] I beg\r\nof you, for the sake of the sex, to explain these terms. I cannot\r\ncomprehend what my brother means, when he tells me they signify my own\r\nname, which is,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n        \"Your humble Servant,\r\n                              \"PLAIN ENGLISH.\"\r\n\r\nI think the lady's brother has given us a very good idea of that\r\nelegant expression, it being the greatest beauty of speech to be\r\nclose and intelligible. To this end nothing is to be more carefully\r\nconsulted than plainness. In a lady's attire this is the single\r\nexcellence; for to be what some call fine, is the same vice in that\r\ncase as to be florid is in writing or speaking. I have studied and\r\nwritten on this important subject till I almost despair of making a\r\nreformation in the females of this island, where we have more beauty\r\nthan in any spot in the universe, if we did not disguise it by false\r\ngarniture, and detract from it by impertinent improvements. I have\r\nby me a treatise concerning pinners, which I have some hopes will\r\ncontribute to the amendment of the present head-dresses, to which I\r\nhave solid and unanswerable objections. But most of the errors in that\r\nand other particulars of adorning the head, are crept into the world\r\nfrom the ignorance of modern tirewomen; for it is come to that pass,\r\nthat an awkward creature in the first year of her apprenticeship, that\r\ncan hardly stick a pin, shall take upon her to dress a woman of the\r\nfirst quality. However, it is certain that there requires in a good\r\ntirewoman a perfect skill in optics; for all the force of ornament is\r\nto contribute to the intention of the eyes. Thus she who has a mind to\r\nlook killing, must arm her face accordingly, and not leave her eyes\r\nand cheeks undressed. There is Araminta so sensible of this, that she\r\nnever will see even her own husband without a hood[47] on. Can any one\r\nliving bear to see Miss Gruel, lean as she is, with her hair tied back\r\nafter the modern way? But such is the folly of our ladies, that because\r\none who is a beauty, out of ostentation of her being such, takes care\r\nto wear something that she knows cannot be of any consequence to her\r\ncomplexion; I say, our women run on so heedlessly in the fashion,\r\nthat though it is the interest of some to hide as much of their faces\r\nas possible, yet because a leading toast appeared with a backward\r\nhead-dress, the rest shall follow the mode, without observing that the\r\nauthor of the fashion assumed it because it could become no one but\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nFlavia[48] is ever well dressed, and always the genteelest woman you\r\nmeet: but the make of her mind very much contributes to the ornament of\r\nher body. She has the greatest simplicity of manners of any of her sex.\r\nThis makes everything look native about her, and her clothes are so\r\nexactly fitted, that they appear as it were part of her person. Every\r\none that sees her, knows her to be of quality; but her distinction\r\nis owing to her manner, and not to her habit. Her beauty is full of\r\nattraction, but not of allurement. There is such a composure in her\r\nlooks, and propriety in her dress, that you would think it impossible\r\nshe should change the garb you one day see her in for anything so\r\nbecoming, till you next day see her in another. There is no other\r\nmystery in this, but that however she is apparelled, she is herself the\r\nsame: for there is so immediate a relation between our thoughts and\r\ngestures, that a woman must think well to look well.\r\n\r\nBut this weighty subject I must put off for some other matters in which\r\nmy correspondents are urgent for answers, which I shall do where I can,\r\nand appeal to the judgment of others where I cannot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                        _Aug. 15, 1710_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"Taking the air the other day on horseback in the Green Lane that leads\r\nto Southgate, I discovered coming towards me a person well mounted in\r\na mask; and I accordingly expected, as any one would, to have been\r\nrobbed. But when we came up with each other, the spark, to my greater\r\nsurprise, very peaceably gave me the way; which made me take courage\r\nenough to ask him, if he masqueraded, or how? He made me no answer,\r\nbut still continued _incognito_. This was certainly an ass in a lion's\r\nskin; a harmless bull-beggar,[49] who delights to fright innocent\r\npeople, and set them a-galloping. I bethought myself of putting as good\r\na jest upon him, and had turned my horse, with a design to pursue him\r\nto London, and get him apprehended, on suspicion of being a highwayman:\r\nbut when I reflected, that it was the proper office of the magistrate\r\nto punish only knaves, and that we had a censor of Great Britain for\r\npeople of another denomination, I immediately determined to prosecute\r\nhim in your court only. This unjustifiable frolic I take to be neither\r\nwit nor humour: therefore hope you will do me, and as many others as\r\nwere that day frighted, justice.

I should be glad\r\nto know, whether this cautious politician means to commend or to rally\r\nhim, by saying, 'He expressed as much bravery as conduct'? If you can\r\nexplain this dubious phrase, it will inform the public, and oblige,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n                           \"Your humble Servant, &c.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] See No. 151.\r\n\r\n[47] The _Spectator_ contains accounts of the new-fashioned hoods,\r\nwhich were made in various tints, especially cherry-colour. In the\r\nreign of King William the ladies wore a high head-dress, as appears\r\nfrom the following passage in a letter of Swift to Esther Johnson,\r\ndated Nov. 22, 1711: \"I dined to-day with Sir Thomas Hanmer, whose\r\nlady, the Duchess of Grafton, wears a great high head-dress, such as\r\nwas in fashion fifteen years ago, and looks like a mad woman in it, yet\r\nshe has great remains of beauty.\" In the _Spectator_ (No. 98) Addison\r\nrefers to these high head-dresses as in fashion ten years earlier,\r\n_i.e._ about 1701.\r\n\r\n[48] This picture of Flavia has been thought to be a representation of\r\nMrs. Anne Oldfield (see No. 10), of whom Cibber wrote: \"Had her birth\r\nplaced her in a higher rank of life, she had certainly appeared in\r\nreality what in the character of Lady Betty Modish she only excellently\r\nacted, an agreeable gay woman of quality, a little too conscious of\r\nher natural attractions. I have often seen her in private societies,\r\nwhere women of the first rank might have borrowed some part of their\r\nbehaviour, without the least diminution of their sense of dignity.\"\r\nFrom this passage it will be seen that the account of a lady \"of\r\nquality,\" with \"the greatest simplicity of manners,\" can hardly be a\r\ndescription of Mrs. Oldfield. Moreover, the name \"Flavia\" occurs in No.\r\n239, by Addison, and it appears that the lady there referred to was\r\nMiss Osborne, who became Atterbury's wife.\r\n\r\n[49] Something used to frighten children. _Cf._ Sir T.

But before we discourse of this vice, it will be\r\nnecessary to observe, that the learned make a difference between\r\nsimulation and dissimulation.[52] Simulation is a pretence of what\r\nis not, and dissimulation a concealment of what is. The latter is\r\nour present affair. When you look round you in public places in this\r\nisland, you see the generality of mankind carry in their countenance\r\nan air of challenge or defiance: and there is no such man to be found\r\namong us who naturally strives to do greater honours and civilities\r\nthan he receives. This innate sullenness or stubbornness of complexion\r\nis hardly to be conquered by any of our islanders. For which reason,\r\nhowever they may pretend to choose one another, they make but very\r\nawkward rogues; and their dislike to each other is seldom so well\r\ndissembled, but it is suspected. When once it is so, it had as good\r\nbe professed. A man who dissembles well must have none of what we call\r\nstomach, otherwise he will be cold in his professions of good-will\r\nwhere he hates; an imperfection of the last ill consequence in\r\nbusiness. This fierceness in our natures is apparent from the conduct\r\nof our young fellows, who are not got into the schemes and arts of life\r\nwhich the children of this world walk by. One would think that, of\r\ncourse, when a man of any consequence for his figure, his mien, or his\r\ngravity, passes by a youth, he should certainly have the first advances\r\nof salutation; but he is, you may observe, treated in a quite different\r\nmanner, it being the very characteristic of an English temper to defy.\r\nAs I am an Englishman, I find it a very hard matter to bring myself\r\nto pull off the hat first; but it is the only way to be upon any good\r\nterms with those we meet with: therefore the first advance is of high\r\nmoment. Men judge of others by themselves; and he that will command\r\nwith us must condescend. It moves one's spleen very agreeably to see\r\nfellows pretend to be dissemblers without this lesson. They are so\r\nreservedly complaisant till they have learned to resign their natural\r\npassions, that all the steps they make towards gaining those whom they\r\nwould be well with, are but so many marks of what they really are, and\r\nnot of what they would appear.\r\n\r\nThe rough Britons, when they pretend to be artful towards one another,\r\nare ridiculous enough; but when they set up for vices they have\r\nnot, and dissemble their good with an affectation of ill, they are\r\ninsupportable. I know two men in this town who make as good figures\r\nas any in it, that manage their credit so well as to be thought\r\natheists, and yet say their prayers morning and evening. Tom Springly\r\nthe other day pretended to go to an assignation with a married woman\r\nat Rosamond's Pond,[53] and was seen soon after reading the responses\r\nwith great gravity at six-of-clock prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, Aug. 17._\r\n\r\nThough the following epistle bears a just accusation of myself, yet in\r\nregard it is a more advantageous piece of justice to another, I insert\r\nit at large:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                               _Garraway's Coffee-house,\r\n                                                               Aug. 10._\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"I have lately read your paper[54] wherein you represent a conversation\r\nbetween a young lady, your three nephews, and yourself; and am not\r\na little offended at the figure you give your young merchant in the\r\npresence of a beauty. The topic of love is a subject on which a man is\r\nmore beholden to nature for his eloquence, than to the instruction of\r\nthe schools, or my lady's woman. From the two latter, your scholar and\r\npage must have reaped all their advantage above him. I know by this\r\ntime you have pronounced me a trader.

You are to remember, that somewhere in your writings, for\r\nenlarging the territories of virtue and honour, you have multiplied\r\nthe opportunities of attaining to heroic virtue, and have hinted, that\r\nin whatever state of life a man is, if he does things above what is\r\nordinarily performed by men of his rank, he is in those instances a\r\nhero.[55]\r\n\r\n\"Tom Trueman, a young gentleman of eighteen years of age, fell\r\npassionately in love with the beauteous Almira, daughter to his master.\r\nHer regard for him was no less tender. Trueman was better acquainted\r\nwith his master's affairs than his daughter, and secretly lamented\r\nthat each day brought him by many miscarriages nearer bankruptcy than\r\nthe former. This unhappy posture of their affairs the youth suspected\r\nwas owing to the ill management of a factor, in whom his master had\r\nan entire confidence. Trueman took a proper occasion, when his master\r\nwas ruminating on his decaying fortune, to address him for leave\r\nto spend the remainder of his time with his foreign correspondent.\r\nDuring three years' stay in that employment he became acquainted\r\nwith all that concerned his master; and by his great address in the\r\nmanagement of that knowledge, saved him ten thousand pounds. Soon after\r\nthis accident, Trueman's uncle left him a considerable estate. Upon\r\nreceiving that advice, he returned to England, and demanded Almira of\r\nher father. The father, overjoyed at the match, offered him the £10,000\r\nhe had saved him, with the further proposal of resigning to him all his\r\nbusiness. Trueman refused both, and retired into the country with his\r\nbride, contented with his own fortune, though perfectly skilled in all\r\nthe methods of improving it.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be noted, that Trueman refused twenty thousand pounds with\r\nanother young lady; so that reckoning both his self-denials, he is to\r\nhave in your court the merit of having given £30,000 for the woman he\r\nloved.

These are persons of a stubborn,\r\nunpliant morality, that sullenly adhere to their friends when they are\r\ndisgraced, and to their principles, though they are exploded. I shall\r\ntherefore give up this stiff-necked generation to their own obstinacy,\r\nand turn my thoughts to the advantage of the supple, who pay their\r\nhomage to places, and not persons; and without enslaving themselves\r\nto any particular scheme of opinions, are as ready to change their\r\nconduct in point of sentiment as of fashion. The well-disciplined part\r\nof a court are generally so perfect at their exercise, that you may see\r\na whole assembly, from front to rear, face about at once to a new man\r\nof power, though at the same time they turn their backs upon him that\r\nbrought them thither. The great hardship these complaisant members of\r\nsociety are under, seems to be the want of warning upon any approaching\r\nchange or revolution; so that they are obliged in a hurry to tack about\r\nwith every wind, and stop short in the midst of a full career, to the\r\ngreat surprise and derision of their beholders.\r\n\r\nWhen a man foresees a decaying ministry, he has leisure to grow a\r\nmalcontent, reflect upon the present conduct, and by gradual murmurs\r\nfall off from his friends into a new party, by just steps and measures.\r\nFor want of such notices, I have formerly known a very well-bred person\r\nrefuse to return a bow of a man whom he thought in disgrace, that was\r\nnext day made Secretary of State; and another, who after a long neglect\r\nof a minister, came to his levee, and made professions of zeal for his\r\nservice the very day before he was turned out.\r\n\r\nThis produces also unavoidable confusions and mistakes in the\r\ndescriptions of great men's parts and merits. That ancient lyric, Mr.\r\nD'Urfey,[57] some years ago wrote a dedication to a certain lord,\r\nin which he celebrated him for the greatest poet and critic of that\r\nage, upon a misinformation in Dyer's Letter[58], that his noble patron\r\nwas made Lord Chamberlain. In short, innumerable votes, speeches, and\r\nsermons have been thrown away, and turned to no account, merely for\r\nwant of due and timely intelligence. Nay, it has been known, that a\r\npanegyric has been half printed off, when the poet, upon the removal of\r\nthe minister, has been forced to alter it into a satire.\r\n\r\nFor the conduct therefore of such useful persons as are ready to do\r\ntheir country service upon all occasions, I have an engine in my\r\nstudy, which is a sort of a Political Barometer, or, to speak more\r\nintelligibly, a State Weather-Glass, that, by the rising and falling\r\nof a certain magical liquor, presages all changes and revolutions\r\nin government, as the common glass does those of the weather. This\r\nweather-glass is said to have been invented by Cardan,[59] and given by\r\nhim as a present to his great countryman and contemporary Machiavel,\r\nwhich (by the way) may serve to rectify a received error in chronology,\r\nthat places one of these some years after the other. How or when it\r\ncame into my hands, I shall desire to be excused if I keep to myself;\r\nbut so it is, that I have walked by it for the better part of a\r\ncentury, to my safety at least, if not to my advantage; and have among\r\nmy papers, a register of all the changes that happened in it from the\r\nmiddle of Queen Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nIn the time of that princess, it stood long at Settled Fair. At the\r\nlatter end of King James the First, it fell to Cloudy. It held several\r\nyears after at Stormy; insomuch that at last despairing of seeing any\r\nclear weather at home, I followed the royal exile, and some time after\r\nfinding my glass rise, returned to my native country with the rest of\r\nthe loyalists. I was then in hopes to pass the remainder of my days\r\nin Settled Fair: but alas! during the greatest part of that reign,\r\nthe English nation lay in a Dead Calm, which, as it is usual, was\r\nfollowed by high winds and tempests till of late years: in which, with\r\nunspeakable joy and satisfaction, I have seen our political weather\r\nreturned to Settled Fair. I must only observe, that for all this last\r\nsummer my glass has pointed at Changeable. Upon the whole, I often\r\napply to Fortune Æneas's speech to the sybil:\r\n\r\n                  _----Non ulla laborum,\r\n    O virgo, nova mi fades inopinave surgit:\r\n    Omnia præcepi, atque animo me cum ante peregi._[60]\r\n\r\nThe advantages which have accrued to those whom I have advised in\r\ntheir affairs, by virtue of this sort of prescience, have been very\r\nconsiderable. A nephew of mine, who has never put his money into the\r\nstocks, or taken it out, without my advice, has in a few years raised\r\nfive hundred pounds to almost so many thousands. As for myself, who\r\nlook upon riches to consist rather in content than possessions, and\r\nmeasure the greatness of the mind rather by its tranquillity than its\r\nambition, I have seldom used my glass to make my way in the world, but\r\noften to retire from it. This is a by-path to happiness, which was\r\nfirst discovered to me by a most pleasing apothegm of Pythagoras: \"When\r\nthe winds,\" says he, \"rise, worship the echo.\" That great philosopher\r\n(whether to make his doctrines the more venerable, or to gild his\r\nprecepts with the beauty of imagination, or to awaken the curiosity\r\nof his disciples; for I will not suppose what is usually said, that\r\nhe did it to conceal his wisdom from the vulgar) has couched several\r\nadmirable precepts in remote allusions and mysterious sentences.

With the circumstances in which he represents the matter,\r\nhe had no small provocation to be offended, for he attacked him in so\r\nwrong a season, that he could not have any relish of pleasure in it;\r\nthough, perhaps, at another time, it might have passed upon him without\r\ngiving him much uneasiness. Lysander had, after a long satiety of the\r\ntown, been so happy as to get to a solitude he extremely liked, and\r\nrecovered a pleasure he had long discontinued, that of reading. He was\r\ngot to the bank of a rivulet, covered by a pleasing shade, and fanned\r\nby a soft breeze, which threw his mind into that sort of composure and\r\nattention in which a man, though with indolence, enjoys the utmost\r\nliveliness of his spirits, and the greatest strength of his mind at\r\nthe same time. In this state, Lysander represents that he was reading\r\nVirgil's \"Georgics\"; when on a sudden the gentleman above-mentioned\r\nsurprised him, and, without any manner of preparation, falls upon him\r\nat once. \"What! I have found you out at last, after searching all over\r\nthe wood. We wanted you at cards after dinner, but you are much better\r\nemployed. I have heard indeed that you are an excellent scholar: but at\r\nthe same time, is it not a little unkind to rob the ladies, who like\r\nyou so well, of the pleasure of your company? But that is indeed the\r\nmisfortune of you great scholars, you are seldom so fit for the world\r\nas those who never trouble themselves with books. Well, I see you are\r\ntaken up with your learning there, and I'll leave you.\" Lysander says,\r\nhe made him no answer, but took a resolution to complain to me.\r\n\r\nIt is a substantial affliction, when men govern themselves by the rules\r\nof good-breeding, that by the very force of them they are subjected to\r\nthe insolence of those who either never will, or never can, understand\r\nthem. The superficial part of mankind form to themselves little\r\nmeasures of behaviour from the outside of things. By the force of these\r\nnarrow conceptions, they act amongst themselves with applause, and do\r\nnot apprehend they are contemptible to those of higher understanding,\r\nwho are restrained by decencies above their knowledge from showing\r\na dislike. Hence it is, that because complaisance is a good quality\r\nin conversation, one impertinent takes upon him on all occasions to\r\ncommend; and because mirth is agreeable, another thinks fit eternally\r\nto jest. I have of late received many packets of letters complaining\r\nof these spreading evils. A lady who is lately arrived at the Bath\r\nacquaints me, there was in the stage-coach wherein she went down, a\r\ncommon flatterer, and a common jester. These gentlemen were (she tells\r\nme) rivals in her favour; and adds, if there ever happened a case\r\nwherein of two persons one was not liked more than another, it was in\r\nthat journey. They differed only in proportion to the degree of dislike\r\nbetween the nauseous and the insipid. Both these characters of men\r\nare born out of a barrenness of imagination. They are never fools by\r\nnature, but become such out of an impotent ambition of being what she\r\nnever intended them, men of wit and conversation. I therefore think fit\r\nto declare, that according to the known laws of this land, a man may\r\nbe a very honest gentleman, and enjoy himself and his friend, without\r\nbeing a wit; and I absolve all men from taking pains to be such for\r\nthe future. As the present case stands, is it not very unhappy that\r\nLysander must be attacked and applauded in a wood, and Corinna jolted\r\nand commended in a stage-coach; and this for no manner of reason, but\r\nbecause other people have a mind to show their parts? I grant indeed,\r\nif these people (as they have understanding enough for it) would\r\nconfine their accomplishments to those of their own degree of talents,\r\nit were to be tolerated; but when they are so insolent as to interrupt\r\nthe meditations of the wife, the conversations of the agreeable, and\r\nthe whole behaviour of the modest, it becomes a grievance naturally in\r\nmy jurisdiction. Among themselves, I cannot only overlook, but approve\r\nit. I was present the other day at a conversation, where a man of this\r\nheight of breeding and sense told a young woman of the same form, \"To\r\nbe sure, madam, everything must please that comes from a lady.\" She\r\nanswered, \"I know, sir, you are so much a gentleman that you think so.\"\r\nWhy, this is very well on both sides; and it is impossible that such\r\na gentleman and lady should do other than think well of one another.\r\nThese are but loose hints of the disturbances in human society, of\r\nwhich there is yet no remedy; but I shall in a little time publish\r\ntables of respect and civility, by which persons may be instructed in\r\nthe proper times and seasons, as well as at what degree of intimacy a\r\nman may be allowed to commend or rally his companions; the promiscuous\r\nlicence of which is at present far from being among the small errors in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--The following letter was left, with a request to be immediately\r\nanswered, lest the artifices used against a lady in distress may come\r\ninto common practice:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"My elder sister buried her husband about six months ago; and at his\r\nfuneral, a gentleman of more art than honesty, on the night of his\r\ninterment, while she was not herself, but in the utmost agony of her\r\ngrief, spoke to her of the subject of love. In that weakness and\r\ndistraction which my sister was in (as one ready to fall is apt to lean\r\non anybody), he obtained her promise of marriage, which was accordingly\r\nconsummated eleven weeks after. There is no affliction comes alone,\r\nbut one brings another. My sister is now ready to lie-in. She humbly\r\nasks of you, as you are a friend to the sex, to let her know who is\r\nthe lawful father of this child, or whether she may not be relieved\r\nfrom this second marriage, considering it was promised under such\r\ncircumstances as one may very well suppose she did not what she did\r\nvoluntarily, but because she was helpless otherwise. She is advised\r\nsomething about engagements made in gaol, which she thinks the same as\r\nto the reason of the thing. But, dear sir, she relies upon your advice,\r\nand gives you her service; as does\r\n\r\n  \"Your humble Servant,\r\n                   \"REBECCA MIDRIFFE.\"\r\n\r\nThe case is very hard; and I fear, the plea she is advised to make,\r\nfrom the similitude of a man who is in duress, will not prevail.

For this reason, I would not discourage\r\nany searches that are made into the most minute and trivial parts of\r\nthe creation. However, since the world abounds in the noblest fields of\r\nspeculation, it is, methinks, the mark of a little genius to be wholly\r\nconversant among insects, reptiles, animalcules, and those trifling\r\nrarities that furnish out the apartment of a virtuoso.\r\n\r\nThere are some men whose heads are so oddly turned this way, that\r\nthough they are utter strangers to the common occurrences of life, they\r\nare able to discover the sex of a cockle, or describe the generation\r\nof a mite, in all its circumstances. They are so little versed in the\r\nworld, that they scarce know a horse from an ox; but at the same\r\ntime will tell you, with a great deal of gravity, that a flea is a\r\nrhinoceros, and a snail an hermaphrodite. I have known one of these\r\nwhimsical philosophers who has set a greater value upon a collection of\r\nspiders than he would upon a flock of sheep, and has sold his coat off\r\nhis back to purchase a tarantula.\r\n\r\nI would not have a scholar wholly unacquainted with these secrets and\r\ncuriosities of nature; but certainly the mind of man, that is capable\r\nof so much higher contemplations, should not be altogether fixed upon\r\nsuch mean and disproportioned objects. Observations of this kind are\r\napt to alienate us too much from the knowledge of the world, and to\r\nmake us serious upon trifles, by which means they expose philosophy\r\nto the ridicule of the witty, and contempt of the ignorant. In short,\r\nstudies of this nature should be the diversions, relaxations, and\r\namusements; not the care, business, and concern of life.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed wonderful to consider, that there should be a sort of\r\nlearned men who are wholly employed in gathering together the refuse\r\nof nature, if I may call it so, and hoarding up in their chests and\r\ncabinets such creatures as others industriously avoid the sight of.\r\nOne does not know how to mention some of the most precious parts of\r\ntheir treasure without a kind of an apology for it. I have been shown\r\na beetle valued at twenty crowns, and a toad at a hundred: but we must\r\ntake this for a general rule, that whatever appears trivial or obscene\r\nin the common notions of the world, looks grave and philosophical in\r\nthe eye of a virtuoso.\r\n\r\nTo show this humour in its perfection, I shall present my reader with\r\nthe legacy of a certain virtuoso, who laid out a considerable estate\r\nin natural rarities and curiosities, which upon his death-bed he\r\nbequeathed to his relations and friends, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Will of a Virtuoso._\r\n\r\nI Nicholas Gimcrack being in sound health of mind, but in great\r\nweakness of body, do by this my last will and testament bestow my\r\nworldly goods and chattels in manner following:\r\n\r\n_Imprimis_, to my dear wife,\r\n\r\n  One box of butterflies,\r\n  One drawer of shells,\r\n  A female skeleton,\r\n  A dried cockatrice.\r\n\r\n_Item_, to my daughter Elizabeth,\r\n\r\n  My receipt for preserving dead caterpillars.\r\n  As also my preparations of winter May-dew, and embryo pickle.\r\n\r\n_Item_, to my little daughter Fanny,\r\n\r\n  Three crocodile's eggs.\r\n\r\nAnd upon the birth of her first child, if she marries with her mother's\r\nconsent,\r\n\r\n  The nest of a humming-bird.\r\n\r\n_Item_, to my eldest brother, as an acknowledgment for the lands he has\r\nvested in my son Charles, I bequeath\r\n\r\n  My last year's collection of grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n_Item_, to his daughter Susanna, being his only child, I bequeath my\r\n\r\n  English weeds pasted on royal paper.\r\n  With my large folio of Indian cabbage.\r\n\r\n_Item_, to my learned and worthy friend Dr. Johannes Elscrikius,\r\nProfessor in Anatomy, and my associate in the studies of nature, as an\r\neternal monument of my affection and friendship for him, I bequeath\r\n\r\n  My rat's testicles, and\r\n  Whale's pizzle,\r\n\r\nto him and his issue male; and in default of such issue in the said\r\nDr. Elscrikius, then to return to my executor and his heirs for ever.\r\n\r\nHaving fully provided for my nephew Isaac, by making over to him some\r\nyears since\r\n\r\n  A horned scarabæus,\r\n  The skin of a rattlesnake, and\r\n  The mummy of an Egyptian king,\r\n\r\nI make no further provision for him in this my will.\r\n\r\nMy eldest son John having spoken disrespectfully of his little sister,\r\nwhom I keep by me in spirits of wine, and in many other instances\r\nbehaved himself undutifully towards me, I do disinherit, and wholly cut\r\noff from any part of this my personal estate, by giving him a single\r\ncockle-shell.\r\n\r\nTo my second son Charles, I give and bequeath all my flowers, plants,\r\nminerals, mosses, shells, pebbles, fossils, beetles, butterflies,\r\ncaterpillars, grasshoppers, and vermin, not above specified: as also\r\nall my monsters, both wet and dry, making the said Charles whole and\r\nsole executor of this my last will and testament; he paying, or causing\r\nto be paid, the aforesaid legacies within the space of six months after\r\nmy decease.

The generality of women are\r\nby nature loquacious: therefore mere volubility of speech is not to be\r\nimputed to them, but should be considered with pleasure when it is used\r\nto express such passions as tend to sweeten or adorn conversation: but\r\nwhen, through rage, females are vehement in their eloquence, nothing in\r\nthe world has so ill an effect upon the features; for by the force of\r\nit, I have seen the most amiable become the most deformed, and she that\r\nappeared one of the Graces, immediately turned into one of the Furies.\r\nI humbly conceive, the great cause of this evil may proceed from a\r\nfalse notion the ladies have of what we call a modest woman. They have\r\ntoo narrow a conception of this lovely character, and believe they have\r\nnot at all forfeited their pretensions to it, provided they have no\r\nimputations on their chastity. But alas! the young fellows know they\r\npick out better women in the side-boxes[63] than many of those who pass\r\nupon the world and themselves for modest.\r\n\r\nModesty never rages, never murmurs, never pouts: when it is\r\nill-treated, it pines, it beseeches, it languishes. The neighbour I\r\nmention is one of your common modest women, that is to say, those as\r\nare ordinarily reckoned such. Her husband knows every pain in life\r\nwith her but jealousy. Now because she is clear in this particular,\r\nthe man can't say his soul is his own, but she cries, \"No modest woman\r\nis respected nowadays.\" What adds to the comedy in this case is, that\r\nit is very ordinary with this sort of women to talk in the language\r\nof distress: they will complain of the forlorn wretchedness of their\r\ncondition, and then the poor helpless creatures shall throw the next\r\nthing they can lay their hands on at the person who offends them. Our\r\nneighbour was only saying to his wife, she went a little too fine, when\r\nshe immediately pulled his periwig off, and stamping it under her feet,\r\nwrung her hands, and said, \"Never modest woman was so used.\" These\r\nladies of irresistible modesty are those who make virtue unamiable; not\r\nthat they can be said to be virtuous, but as they live without scandal;\r\nand being under the common denomination of being such, men fear to meet\r\ntheir faults in those who are as agreeable as they are innocent.\r\n\r\nI take the bully among men, and the scold among women, to draw the\r\nfoundation of their actions from the same defect in the mind. A bully\r\nthinks honour consists wholly in being brave, and therefore has regard\r\nto no one rule of life, if he preserves himself from the accusation of\r\ncowardice. The froward woman knows chastity to be the first merit in\r\na woman; and therefore, since no one can call her one ugly name, she\r\ncalls all mankind all the rest.\r\n\r\nThese ladies, where their companions are so imprudent as to take their\r\nspeeches for any other than exercises of their own lungs, and their\r\nhusband's patience, gain by the force of being resisted, and flame\r\nwith open fury, which is no way to be opposed but by being neglected:\r\nthough at the same time human frailty makes it very hard to relish\r\nthe philosophy of contemning even frivolous reproach. There is a very\r\npretty instance of this infirmity in the man of the best sense that\r\never was, no less a person than Adam himself. According to Milton's\r\ndescription of the first couple, as soon as they had fallen, and the\r\nturbulent passions of anger, hatred, and jealousy first entered their\r\nbreasts, Adam grew moody, and talked to his wife, as you may find it\r\nin the 359th page, and ninth book, of \"Paradise Lost,\" in the octavo\r\nedition, which out of heroics, and put into domestic style, would run\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"Madam, if my advice had been of any authority with you when that\r\nstrange desire of gadding possessed you this morning, we had still been\r\nhappy: but your cursed vanity and opinion of your own conduct, which is\r\ncertainly very wavering when it seeks occasions of being proved, has\r\nruined both yourself, and me who trusted you.\"\r\n\r\nEve had no fan in her hand to ruffle, or tucker to pull down,[64] but\r\nwith a reproachful air she answered:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, do you impute that to my desire of gadding, which might have\r\nhappened to yourself with all your wisdom and gravity? The serpent\r\nspoke so excellently, and with so good a grace, that--Besides, what\r\nharm had I ever done him, that he should design me any? Was I to have\r\nbeen always at your side, I might as well have continued there, and\r\nbeen but your rib still: but if I was so weak a creature as you thought\r\nme, why did you not interpose your sage authority more absolutely? You\r\ndenied me going as faintly, as you say I resisted the serpent. Had not\r\nyou been too easy, neither you or I had now transgressed.\"\r\n\r\nAdam replied, \"Why, Eve, hast thou the impudence to upbraid me as the\r\ncause of thy transgression for my indulgence to thee? Thus it will\r\never be with him who trusts too much to woman: at the same time that\r\nshe refuses to be governed, if she suffers by her obstinacy, she will\r\naccuse the man that shall leave her to herself.\"\r\n\r\n    _Thus they in mutual accusation spent\r\n    The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning:\r\n    And of their vain contest appeared no end._[65]\r\n\r\nThis to the modern will appear but a very faint piece of conjugal\r\nenmity; but you are to consider, that they were but just begun to be\r\nangry, and they wanted new words for expressing their new passions. But\r\nher accusing him of letting her go, and telling him how good a speaker\r\nand how fine a gentleman the devil was, we must reckon, allowing for\r\nthe improvements of time, that she gave him the same provocation as\r\nif she had called him cuckold. The passionate and familiar terms\r\nwith which the same case, repeated daily for so many thousand years,\r\nhas furnished the present generation, were not then in use; but the\r\nfoundation of debate has ever been the same, a contention about their\r\nmerit and wisdom. Our general mother was a beauty, and hearing there\r\nwas another now in the world, could not forbear (as Adam tells her)\r\nshowing herself, though to the devil, by whom the same vanity made her\r\nliable to be betrayed.\r\n\r\nI cannot, with all the help of science and astrology, find any other\r\nremedy for this evil, but what was the medicine in this first quarrel;\r\nwhich was, as appeared in the next book, that they were convinced of\r\ntheir being both weak, but one weaker than the other.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible that the beauteous could but rage a little before\r\na glass, and see their pretty countenances grow wild, it is not to be\r\ndoubted but it would have a very good effect; but that would require\r\ntemper: for Lady Firebrand, upon observing her features swell when\r\nher maid vexed her the other day, stamped her dressing-glass under\r\nher feet. In this case, when one of this temper is moved, she is\r\nlike a witch in an operation, and makes all things turn round with\r\nher. The very fabric is in a vertigo when she begins to charm. In an\r\ninstant, whatever was the occasion that moved her blood, she has such\r\nintolerable servants, Betty is so awkward, Tom can't carry a message,\r\nand her husband has so little respect for her, that she, poor woman, is\r\nweary of this life, and was born to be unhappy.\r\n\r\n                            _Desunt multa._\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe season now coming on in which the town will begin to fill, Mr.\r\nBickerstaff gives notice, that from the 1st of October next, he will be\r\nmuch wittier than he has hitherto been.[66]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] See No. 50.\r\n\r\n[64] The tucker \"ran in a small kind of ruffle round the uppermost\r\nverge of the woman's stays, and by that means covered a great part of\r\nthe shoulders and bosom\" (_Guardian_, No. 100).

The freshness of the dews that lay upon everything\r\nabout me, with the cool breath of the morning, which inspired the birds\r\nwith so many delightful instincts, created in me the same kind of\r\nanimal pleasure, and made my heart overflow with such secret emotions\r\nof joy and satisfaction as are not to be described or accounted for. On\r\nthis occasion I could not but reflect upon a beautiful simile in Milton:\r\n\r\n    _As one who long in populous city pent,\r\n    Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,\r\n    Forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe\r\n    Among the pleasant villages and farms\r\n    Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight:\r\n    The smell of grain, or tedded[67] grass, or kine,\r\n    Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound._[68]\r\n\r\nThose who are conversant in the writings of polite authors, receive\r\nan additional entertainment from the country, as it revives in their\r\nmemories those charming descriptions with which such authors do\r\nfrequently abound.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of the foregoing beautiful simile in Milton, and\r\napplying it to myself, when I observed to the windward of me a black\r\ncloud falling to the earth in long trails of rain, which made me betake\r\nmyself for shelter to a house which I saw at a little distance from\r\nthe place where I was walking. As I sat in the porch, I heard the\r\nvoices of two or three persons, who seemed very earnest in discourse.\r\nMy curiosity was raised when I heard the names of Alexander the Great\r\nand Artaxerxes; and as their talk seemed to run on ancient heroes,\r\nI concluded there could not be any secret in it; for which reason I\r\nthought I might very fairly listen to what they said.\r\n\r\nAfter several parallels between great men, which appeared to me\r\naltogether groundless and chimerical, I was surprised to hear one say,\r\nthat he valued the Black Prince more than the Duke of Vendôme. How the\r\nDuke of Vendôme should become a rival of the Black Prince's, I could\r\nnot conceive; and was more startled when I heard a second affirm with\r\ngreat vehemence, that if the Emperor of Germany was not going off,\r\nhe should like him better than either of them. He added, that though\r\nthe season was so changeable, the Duke of Marlborough was in blooming\r\nbeauty. I was wondering to myself from whence they had received this\r\nodd intelligence, especially when I heard them mention the names of\r\nseveral other great generals, as the Prince of Hesse, and the King of\r\nSweden, who, they said, were both running away: to which they added,\r\nwhat I entirely agreed with them in, that the Crown of France was very\r\nweak, but that the Mareschal Villars still kept his colours. At last\r\none of them told the company, if they would go along with him, he would\r\nshow them a chimney-sweeper and a painted lady in the same bed, which\r\nhe was sure would very much please them. The shower which had driven\r\nthem, as well as myself, into the house, was now over: and as they were\r\npassing by me into the garden, I asked them to let me be one of their\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman of the house told me, if I delighted in flowers, it would\r\nbe worth my while, for that he believed he could show me such a blow of\r\ntulips as was not to be matched in the whole country.\r\n\r\nI accepted the offer, and immediately found that they had been talking\r\nin terms of gardening, and that the kings and generals they had\r\nmentioned were only so many tulips, to which the gardeners, according\r\nto their usual custom, had given such high titles and appellations of\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nI was very much pleased and astonished at the glorious show of these\r\ngay vegetables, that arose in great profusion on all the banks about\r\nus. Sometimes I considered them with the eye of an ordinary spectator\r\nas so many beautiful objects, varnished over with a natural gloss, and\r\nstained with such a variety of colours as are not to be equalled in\r\nany artificial dyes or tinctures. Sometimes I considered every leaf\r\nas an elaborate piece of tissue, in which the threads and fibres were\r\nwoven together into different configurations, which gave a different\r\ncolouring to the light as it glanced on the several parts of the\r\nsurface. Sometimes I considered the whole bed of tulips, according to\r\nthe notion of the greatest mathematician and philosopher that ever\r\nlived,[69] as a multitude of optic instruments, designed for the\r\nseparating light into all those various colours of which it is composed.\r\n\r\nI was awakened out of these my philosophical speculations, by observing\r\nthe company often seemed to laugh at me. I accidentally praised a tulip\r\nas one of the finest that I ever saw; upon which they told me, it was\r\na common fool's-coat. Upon that I praised a second, which it seems was\r\nbut another kind of fool's-coat. I had the same fate with two or three\r\nmore; for which reason I desired the owner of the garden to let me know\r\nwhich were the finest of the flowers, for that I was so unskilful in\r\nthe art, that I thought the most beautiful were the most valuable, and\r\nthat those which had the gayest colours were the most beautiful. The\r\ngentleman smiled at my ignorance: he seemed a very plain honest man,\r\nand a person of good sense, had not his head been touched with that\r\ndistemper which Hippocrates calls the Τυλιππομανια (Tulippomania);\r\ninsomuch that he would talk very rationally on any subject in the world\r\nbut a tulip.\r\n\r\nHe told me, that he valued the bed of flowers which lay before us, and\r\nwas not above twenty yards in length, and two in breadth, more than he\r\nwould the best hundred acres of land in England; and added, that it\r\nwould have been worth twice the money it is, if a foolish cook-maid of\r\nhis had not almost ruined him the last winter, by mistaking a handful\r\nof tulip-roots for a heap of onions, \"and by that means,\" says he,\r\n\"made me a dish of porridge, that cost me above £1000 sterling.\" He\r\nthen showed me what he thought the finest of his tulips, which I found\r\nreceived all their value from their rarity and oddness, and put me in\r\nmind of your great fortunes, which are not always the greatest beauties.\r\n\r\nI have often looked upon it as a piece of happiness, that I have never\r\nfallen into any of these fantastical tastes, nor esteemed anything the\r\nmore for its being uncommon and hard to be met with. For this reason,\r\nI look upon the whole country in spring-time as a spacious garden, and\r\nmake as many visits to a spot of daisies, or a bank of violets, as\r\na florist does to his borders and parterres. There is not a bush in\r\nblossom within a mile of me which I am not acquainted with, nor scarce\r\na daffodil or cowslip that withers away in my neighbourhood without my\r\nmissing it. I walked home in this temper of mind through several fields\r\nand meadows with an unspeakable pleasure, not without reflecting on\r\nthe bounty of Providence, which has made the most pleasing and most\r\nbeautiful objects the most ordinary and most common.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67] Grass mown and spread for drying.\r\n\r\n[68] \"Paradise Lost,\" ix. 445.\r\n\r\n[69] Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             =No. 219.=                      [?

These pert puppies immediately resolved to come\r\nwith him, and from the beginning to the end of the night entertained\r\neach other with impertinences, to which we were perfect strangers. I\r\nam come home very much tired; for the affliction was so irksome to me,\r\nthat it surpasses all other I ever knew, insomuch that I cannot reflect\r\nupon this sorrow with pleasure, though it is past.\r\n\r\nAn easy manner of conversation is the most desirable quality a man can\r\nhave; and for that reason coxcombs will take upon them to be familiar\r\nwith people whom they never saw before. What adds to the vexation of it\r\nis, that they will act upon the foot of knowing you by fame, and rally\r\nwith you, as they call it, by repeating what your enemies say of you;\r\nand court you, as they think, by uttering to your face at a wrong time\r\nall the kind things your friends speak of you in your absence.\r\n\r\nThese people are the more dreadful, the more they have of what\r\nis usually called wit: for a lively imagination, when it is not\r\ngoverned by a good understanding, makes such miserable havoc both in\r\nconversation and business, that it lays you defenceless, and fearful\r\nto throw the least word in its way that may give it new matter for its\r\nfurther errors.\r\n\r\nTom Mercett has as quick a fancy as any one living; but there is no\r\nreasonable man can bear him half-an-hour. His purpose is to entertain,\r\nand it is of no consequence to him what is said, so it be what is\r\ncalled well said; as if a man must bear a wound with patience, because\r\nhe that pushed at you came up with a good air and mien. That part\r\nof life which we spend in company, is the most pleasing of all our\r\nmoments; and therefore I think our behaviour in it should have its\r\nlaws as well as the part of our being which is generally esteemed the\r\nmore important. From hence it is, that from long experience I have\r\nmade it a maxim, that however we may pretend to take satisfaction in\r\nsprightly mirth and high jollity, there is no great pleasure in any\r\ncompany where the basis of the society is not mutual good-will. When\r\nthis is in the room, every trifling circumstance, the most minute\r\naccident, the absurdity of a servant, the repetition of an old story,\r\nthe look of a man when he is telling it, the most indifferent and\r\nthe most ordinary occurrences, are matters which produce mirth and\r\ngood-humour. I went to spend an hour after this manner with some\r\nfriends who enjoy it in perfection whenever they meet, when those\r\ndestroyers above-mentioned came in upon us. There is not a man among\r\nthem has any notion of distinction of superiority to one another,\r\neither in their fortunes or their talents, when they are in company.\r\nOr if any reflection to the contrary occurs in their thoughts, it only\r\nstrikes a delight upon their minds, that so much wisdom and power is in\r\npossession of one whom they love and esteem.\r\n\r\nIn these my Lucubrations, I have frequently dwelt upon this one topic.\r\nIt would make short work for us reformers, for it is only want of\r\nmaking this a position that renders some characters bad which would\r\notherwise be good. Tom Mercett means no man ill, but does ill to\r\neverybody. His ambition is to be witty; and to carry on that design,\r\nhe breaks through all things that other people hold sacred. If he\r\nthought wit was no way to be used but to the advantage of society, that\r\nsprightliness would have a new turn, and we should expect what he is\r\ngoing to say with satisfaction instead of fear. It is no excuse for\r\nbeing mischievous, that a man is mischievous without malice: nor will\r\nit be thought an atonement that the ill was done not to injure the\r\nparty concerned, but to divert the indifferent.\r\n\r\nIt is, methinks, a very great error that we should not profess honesty\r\nin conversation as much as in commerce. If we consider that there is no\r\ngreater misfortune than to be ill received where we love the turning\r\na man to ridicule among his friends, we rob him of greater enjoyments\r\nthan he could have purchased by his wealth; yet he that laughs at him,\r\nwould perhaps be the last man who would hurt him in this case of less\r\nconsequence. It has been said, the history of Don Quixote utterly\r\ndestroyed the spirit of gallantry in the Spanish nation; and I believe\r\nwe may say much more truly, that the humour of ridicule has done as\r\nmuch injury to the true relish of company in England.\r\n\r\nSuch satisfactions as arise from the secret comparison of ourselves\r\nto others, with relation to their inferior fortunes or merit, are\r\nmean and unworthy. The true and high state of conversation is when\r\nmen communicate their thoughts to each other upon such subjects, and\r\nin such a manner, as would be pleasant if there were no such thing as\r\nfolly in the world; for it is but a low condition of wit in one man\r\nwhich depends upon folly in another.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--I was here interrupted by the receipt of my letters, among\r\nwhich is one from a lady, who is not a little offended at my\r\ntranslation of the discourse between Adam and Eve.[71] She pretends\r\nto tell me my own, as she calls it, and quotes several passages in my\r\nworks which tend to the utter disunion of man and wife. Her epistle\r\nwill best express her. I have made an extract of it, and shall insert\r\nthe most material passages:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you know we women are not too apt to forgive: for which\r\nreason, before you concern yourself any further with our sex, I would\r\nadvise you to answer what is said against you by those of your own.\r\nI enclose to you business enough till you are ready for your promise\r\nof being witty.

I do not find,\r\nhowever, any great use made of this instrument till it fell into the\r\nhands of a learned and vigilant priest or minister (for he frequently\r\nwrote himself both one and the other), who was some time Vicar of Bray.\r\nThis gentleman lived in his vicarage to a good old age; and after\r\nhaving seen several successions of his neighbouring clergy either burnt\r\nor banished, departed this life with the satisfaction of having never\r\ndeserted his flock, and died Vicar of Bray. As this glass was first\r\ndesigned to calculate the different degrees of heat in religion, as it\r\nraged in Popery, or as it cooled and grew temperate in the Reformation,\r\nit was marked at several distances, after the manner our ordinary\r\nthermometer is to this day, viz., Extreme Hot, Sultry Hot, Very Hot,\r\nHot, Warm, Temperate, Cold, Just Freezing, Frost, Hard Frost, Great\r\nFrost, Extreme Cold.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that Toricellius, the inventor of the common\r\nweather-glass, made the experiment in a long tube which held thirty-two\r\nfeet of water; and that a more modern virtuoso finding such a machine\r\naltogether unwieldy and useless, and considering that thirty-two inches\r\nof quicksilver weighed as much as so many feet of water in a tube of\r\nthe same circumference, invented that sizable instrument which is now\r\nin use. After this manner, that I might adapt the thermometer I am\r\nnow speaking of to the present constitution of our Church, as divided\r\ninto High and Low, I have made some necessary variations both in the\r\ntube and the fluid it contains. In the first place, I ordered a tube\r\nto be cast in a planetary hour, and took care to seal it hermetically,\r\nwhen the sun was in conjunction with Saturn. I then took the proper\r\nprecautions about the fluid, which is a compound of two very different\r\nliquors: one of them a spirit drawn out of a strong heady wine; the\r\nother a particular sort of rock water, colder than ice, and clearer\r\nthan crystal. The spirit is of a red fiery colour, and so very apt to\r\nferment, that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the water, or\r\npent up very close, it will burst the vessel that holds it, and fly\r\nup in fume and smoke. The water, on the contrary, is of such a subtle\r\npiercing cold, that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the\r\nspirits, it will sink through almost everything that it is put into,\r\nand seems to be of the same nature as the water mentioned by Quintus\r\nCurtius, which, says the historian, could be contained in nothing but\r\nin the hoof or (as the Oxford manuscript has it) in the skull of an\r\nass. The thermometer is marked according to the following figure, which\r\nI set down at length, not only to give my reader a clear idea of it,\r\nbut also to fill up my paper.\r\n\r\n  Ignorance.\r\n  Persecution.\r\n  Wrath.\r\n  Zeal.\r\n  CHURCH.\r\n  Moderation.\r\n  Lukewarmness.\r\n  Infidelity.\r\n  Ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe, that the Church is placed in the middle point\r\nof the glass, between Zeal and Moderation, the situation in which she\r\nalways flourishes, and in which every good Englishman wishes her who is\r\na friend to the constitution of his country. However, when it mounts\r\nto Zeal, it is not amiss; and when it sinks to Moderation, is still in\r\na most admirable temper. The worst of it is, that when once it begins\r\nto rise, it has still an inclination to ascend, insomuch that it is\r\napt to climb from Zeal to Wrath, and from Wrath to Persecution, which\r\nalways ends in Ignorance, and very often proceeds from it. In the same\r\nmanner it frequently takes its progress through the lower half of the\r\nglass; and when it has a tendency to fall, will gradually descend from\r\nModeration to Lukewarmness, and from Lukewarmness to Infidelity, which\r\nvery often terminates in Ignorance, and always proceeds from it.\r\n\r\nIt is a common observation, that the ordinary thermometer will be\r\naffected by the breathing of people who are in the room where it\r\nstands; and indeed, it is almost incredible to conceive how the glass\r\nI am now describing will fall by the breath of a multitude crying\r\n\"Popery\"; or on the contrary, how it will rise when the same multitude\r\n(as it sometimes happens) cry out in the same breath, \"The Church is in\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had finished this my glass, and adjusted it to the\r\nabove-mentioned scale of religion, that I might make proper experiments\r\nwith it, I carried it under my cloak to several coffee-houses,\r\nand other places of resort about this great city. At St. James's\r\nCoffee-house, the liquor stood at Moderation; but at Will's, to my\r\nextreme surprise, it subsided to the very lowest mark on the glass. At\r\nthe Grecian, it mounted but just one point higher; at the Rainbow,[74]\r\nit still ascended two degrees: Child's fetched it up to Zeal, and other\r\nadjacent coffee-houses to Wrath.\r\n\r\nIt fell into the lower half of the glass as I went farther into the\r\ncity, till at length it settled at Moderation, where it continued all\r\nthe time I stayed about the 'Change, as also whilst I passed by the\r\nBank. And here I cannot but take notice, that through the whole course\r\nof my remarks, I never observed my glass to rise at the same time that\r\nthe stocks did.\r\n\r\nTo complete the experiment, I prevailed upon a friend of mine, who\r\nworks under me in the occult sciences, to make a progress with my glass\r\nthrough the whole island of Great Britain; and after his return, to\r\npresent me with a register of his observations. I guessed beforehand\r\nat the temper of several places he passed through, by the characters\r\nthey have had time out of mind. Thus that facetious divine, Dr. Fuller,\r\nspeaking of the town of Banbury near a hundred years ago, tells us,\r\nit was a place famous for cakes and zeal, which I find by my glass is\r\ntrue to this day as to the latter part of this description; though I\r\nmust confess, it is not in the same reputation for cakes that it was in\r\nthe time of that learned author; and thus of other places. In short, I\r\nhave now by me, digested in an alphabetical order, all the counties,\r\ncorporations, and boroughs in Great Britain, with their respective\r\ntempers, as they stand related to my thermometer: but this I shall keep\r\nto myself, because I would by no means do anything that may seem to\r\ninfluence any ensuing elections.\r\n\r\nThe point of doctrine which I would propagate by this my invention, is\r\nthe same which was long ago advanced by that able teacher Horace, out\r\nof whom I have taken my text for this discourse: we should be careful\r\nnot to overshoot ourselves in the pursuits even of virtue. Whether zeal\r\nor moderation be the point we aim at, let us keep fire out of the one,\r\nand frost out of the other. But alas! the world is too wise to want\r\nsuch a precaution. The terms High Church and Low Church, as commonly\r\nused, do not so much denote a principle, as they distinguish a party.\r\nThey are like words of battle, that have nothing to do with their\r\noriginal signification, but are only given out to keep a body of men\r\ntogether, and to let them know friends from enemies.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I have considered with some little attention the\r\ninfluence which the opinions of these great national sects have upon\r\ntheir practice; and do look upon it as one of the unaccountable things\r\nof our times, that multitudes of honest gentlemen, who entirely agree\r\nin their lives, should take it in their heads to differ in their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] See No. 214.\r\n\r\n[74] The Rainbow Tavern, by the Inner Temple Gate, Fleet Street, was\r\nestablished as a coffee-house by James Farr, a barber, in or before\r\n1657.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             =No. 221.=                    [?

When I married this gentleman, he had\r\na very handsome estate; but upon buying a set of microscopes, he\r\nwas chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society; from which time I do not\r\nremember ever to have heard him speak as other people did, or talk\r\nin a manner that any of his family could understand him. He used,\r\nhowever, to pass away his time very innocently in conversation with\r\nseveral members of that learned body; for which reason I never advised\r\nhim against their company for several years, till at last I found his\r\nbrain was quite turned with their discourses. The first symptom which\r\nhe discovered of his being a virtuoso, as you call him, poor man! was\r\nabout fifteen years ago, when he gave me positive orders to turn off\r\nan old weeding-woman that had been employed in the family for several\r\nyears. He told me at the same time, that there was no such thing in\r\nnature as a weed, and that it was his design to let his garden produce\r\nwhat it pleased; so that you may be sure it makes a very pleasant show\r\nas it now lies. About the same time he took a humour to ramble up and\r\ndown the country, and would often bring home with him his pockets\r\nfull of moss and pebbles. This you may be sure gave me a heavy heart;\r\nthough at the same time I must needs say, he had the character of a\r\nvery honest man, notwithstanding he was reckoned a little weak, till\r\nhe began to sell his estate, and buy those strange baubles that you\r\nhave taken notice of. Upon Midsummer-day last, as he was walking with\r\nme in the fields, he saw a very odd-coloured butterfly just before\r\nus. I observed, that he immediately changed colour, like a man that is\r\nsurprised with a piece of good luck, and telling me that it was what\r\nhe had looked for above these twelve years, he threw off his coat,\r\nand followed it. I lost sight of them both in less than a quarter of\r\nan hour; but my husband continued the chase over hedge and ditch till\r\nabout sunset; at which time, as I was afterwards told, he caught the\r\nbutterfly, as she rested herself upon a cabbage, near five miles from\r\nthe place where he first put her up. He was here lifted from the ground\r\nby some passengers in a very fainting condition, and brought home to\r\nme about midnight. His violent exercise threw him into a fever, which\r\ngrew upon him by degrees, and at last carried him off. In one of the\r\nintervals of his distemper, he called to me, and after having excused\r\nhimself for running out of his estate, he told me, that he had always\r\nbeen more industrious to improve his mind than his fortune; and that\r\nhis family must rather value themselves upon his memory as he was a\r\nwise man, than a rich one. He then told me, that it was a custom among\r\nthe Romans, for a man to give his slaves their liberty when he lay upon\r\nhis death-bed. I could not imagine what this meant, till after having\r\na little composed himself, he ordered me to bring him a flea which he\r\nhad kept for several months in a chain, with a design, as he said, to\r\ngive it its manumission. This was done accordingly. He then made the\r\nwill, which I have since seen printed in your works word for word. Only\r\nI must take notice, that you have omitted the codicil, in which he left\r\na large _Concha Veneris_, as it is there called, to a member of the\r\nRoyal Society, who was often with him in his sickness, and assisted him\r\nin his will. And now, sir, I come to the chief business of my letter,\r\nwhich is, to desire your friendship and assistance in the disposal of\r\nthose many rarities and curiosities which lie upon my hands. If you\r\nknow any one that has an occasion for a parcel of dried spiders, I will\r\nsell them a pennyworth.[77] I could likewise let any one have a bargain\r\nof cockle-shells. I would also desire your advice, whether I had best\r\nsell my beetles in a lump, or by retail. The gentleman above mentioned,\r\nwho was my husband's friend, would have me make an auction of all his\r\ngoods, and is now drawing up a catalogue of every particular for that\r\npurpose, with the two following words in great letters over the head\r\nof them, _Auctio Gimcrackiana_. But upon talking with him, I begin to\r\nsuspect he is as mad as poor Sir Nicholas was. Your advice in all these\r\nparticulars will be a great piece of charity to,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n     \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n                             \"ELIZABETH GIMCRACK.\"\r\n\r\nI shall answer the foregoing letter, and give the widow my best advice,\r\nas soon as I can find out chapmen for the wares which she has to put\r\noff. In the meantime, I shall give my reader the sight of a letter\r\nwhich I have received from another female correspondent by the same\r\npost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"GOOD MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced by a late paper of yours,[78] that a passionate woman\r\n(which among the common people goes under the name of a scold) is one\r\nof the most insupportable creatures in the world. But alas! sir, what\r\ncan we do? I have made a thousand vows and resolutions every morning\r\nto guard myself against this frailty, but have generally broken them\r\nbefore dinner, and could never in my life hold out till the second\r\ncourse was set upon the table. What most troubles me is, that my\r\nhusband is as patient and good-natured as your own Worship, or any man\r\nliving can be. Pray give me some directions, for I would observe the\r\nstrictest and severest rules you can think of to cure myself of this\r\ndistemper, which is apt to fall into my tongue every moment. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n         \"Your most humble Servant, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this most unfortunate lady, I must acquaint her, that\r\nthere is now in town an ingenious physician of my acquaintance, who\r\nundertakes to cure all the vices and defects of the mind by inward\r\nmedicines, or outward applications. I shall give the world an account\r\nof his patients and his cures in other papers, when I shall be more\r\nat leisure to treat upon this subject. I shall only here inform my\r\ncorrespondent, that for the benefit of such ladies that are troubled\r\nwith virulent tongues, he has prepared a cold bath, over which there is\r\nfastened, at the end of a long pole, a very convenient chair, curiously\r\ngilt and carved. When the patient is seated in this chair, the doctor\r\nlifts up the pole, and gives her two or three total immersions in the\r\ncold bath, till such time as she has quite lost the use of speech.\r\nThis operation so effectually chills the tongue, and refrigerates the\r\nblood, that a woman, who at her entrance into the chair is extremely\r\npassionate and sonorous, will come out as silent and gentle as a lamb.\r\nThe doctor told me, he would not practise this experiment upon women of\r\nfashion, had not he seen it made upon those of meaner condition with\r\nvery good effect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] This paper has been attributed to Addison, though not included\r\nin his works, because it is a sequel to No. 216, and because of\r\nthe corrections in the following number of the folio issue.

And whereas I have been\r\nimportuned to publish some edict against these midnight alarms, which,\r\nunder the name of serenades, do greatly annoy many well-disposed\r\npersons, not only in the place above mentioned, but also in most of the\r\npolite towns of this island.\r\n\r\nI have taken that matter into my serious consideration, and do find,\r\nthat this custom is by no means to be indulged in this country and\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed very unaccountable, that most of our British youth should\r\ntake such great delight in these nocturnal expeditions. Your robust\r\ntrue-born Briton, that has not yet felt the force of flames and darts,\r\nhas a natural inclination to break windows; while those whose natural\r\nruggedness has been soothed and softened by gentle passion, have as\r\nstrong a propensity to languish under them, especially if they have\r\na fiddler behind them to utter their complaints: for as the custom\r\nprevails at present, there is scarce a young man of any fashion in a\r\ncorporation who does not make love with the town music. The waits often\r\nhelp him through his courtship; and my friend Mr. Banister[80] has told\r\nme, he was proffered five hundred pounds by a young fellow to play but\r\nfor one winter under the window of a lady that was a great fortune, but\r\nmore cruel than ordinary. One would think they hoped to conquer their\r\nmistresses' hearts as people tame hawks and eagles, by keeping them\r\nawake, or breaking their sleep when they are fallen into it.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to search into the original of this impertinent\r\nway of making love, which, according to some authors, is of great\r\nantiquity. If we may believe Monsieur Dacier and other critics,\r\nHorace's tenth ode of the third book was originally a serenade. And if\r\nI was disposed to show my learning, I could produce a line of him in\r\nanother place, which seems to have been the burthen of an old heathen\r\nserenade.\r\n\r\n    ----Audis minus et minus jam:\r\n    \"Me tuo longas pereunte noctes,\r\n        Lydia, dormis?\"[81]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the opinions of many learned men upon this subject,\r\nI rather agree with them who look upon this custom, as now practised,\r\nto have been introduced by castrated musicians, who found out this way\r\nof applying themselves to their mistresses at these hours, when men\r\nof hoarser voices express their passions in a more vulgar method. It\r\nmust be confessed, that your Italian eunuchs do practise this manner of\r\ncourtship to this day.\r\n\r\nBut whoever were the persons that first thought of the serenade, the\r\nauthors of all countries are unanimous in ascribing the invention to\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThere are two circumstances which qualified that country above all\r\nother for this midnight music.\r\n\r\nThe first I shall mention, was the softness of their climate.\r\n\r\nThis gave the lover opportunities of being abroad in the air, or of\r\nlying upon the earth whole hours together, without fear of damps or\r\ndews; but as for our tramontane lovers, when they begin their midnight\r\ncomplaint with,\r\n\r\n               _My lodging it is on the cold ground,_[82]\r\n\r\nwe are not to understand them in the rigour of the letter, since it\r\nwould be impossible for a British swain to condole himself long in that\r\nsituation without really dying for his mistress. A man might as well\r\nserenade in Greenland as in our region. Milton seems to have had in\r\nhis thoughts the absurdity of these Northern serenades in the censure\r\nwhich he passes upon them:\r\n\r\n                  _----Or midnight ball,\r\n    Or serenade, which the starved lover sings\r\n    To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain._[83]\r\n\r\nThe truth of it is, I have often pitied, in a winter night, a vocal\r\nmusician, and have attributed many of his trills and quavers to the\r\ncoldness of the weather.\r\n\r\nThe second circumstance which inclined the Italians to this custom, was\r\nthat musical genius which is so universal among them. Nothing is more\r\nfrequent in that country than to hear a cobbler working to an opera\r\ntune. You can scarce see a porter that has not one nail much longer\r\nthan the rest, which you will find, upon inquiry, is cherished for some\r\ninstrument. In short, there is not a labourer, or handicraft-man, that\r\nin the cool of the evening does not relieve himself with solos and\r\nsonatas.\r\n\r\nThe Italian soothes his mistress with a plaintive voice, and bewails\r\nhimself in such melting music that the whole neighbourhood sympathises\r\nwith him in his sorrow:\r\n\r\n    _Qualis populea mœrens Philomela sub umbra ...\r\n    Flet noctem, ramoque sedens miserabile carmen\r\n    Integrat, et mœstis late loca questibus implet._[84]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, our honest countrymen have so little an inclination to\r\nmusic, that they seldom begin to sing till they are drunk, which also\r\nis usually the time when they are most disposed to serenade.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] This paper is ascribed to Addison by Nichols, because of the\r\ncorrections--five in number--in the following number of the folio issue.\r\n\r\n[80] John Banister (died 1735) was the son of a composer and violinist\r\nof the same name.

I have with very\r\nmuch attention considered the case; and among all the observations that\r\nI have made through a long course of years, I have thought the coldness\r\nof wives to their husbands, as well as disrespect from children to\r\nparents, to arise from this one source. This trade for minds and bodies\r\nin the lump, without regard to either, but as they are accompanied\r\nwith such sums of money, and such parcels of land, cannot but produce\r\na commerce between the parties concerned suitable to the mean motives\r\nupon which they at first came together. I have heretofore given an\r\naccount that this method of making settlements was first invented by\r\na griping lawyer, who made use of the covetous tempers of the parents\r\nof each side to force two young people into these vile measures of\r\ndiffidence, for no other end but to increase the skins of parchment, by\r\nwhich they were put into each other's possession out of each other's\r\npower. The law of our country has given an ample and generous provision\r\nfor the wife, even the third of the husband's estate, and left to her\r\ngood-humour and his gratitude the expectation of further provision;\r\nbut the fantastical method of going further, with relation to their\r\nheirs, has a foundation in nothing but pride and folly: for as all men\r\nwish their children as like themselves, and as much better as they\r\ncan possibly, it seems monstrous that we should give out of ourselves\r\nthe opportunities of rewarding and discouraging them according to\r\ntheir deserts. This wise institution has no more sense in it than\r\nif a man should begin a deed with, \"Whereas no man living knows how\r\nlong he shall continue to be a reasonable creature, or an honest man:\r\nand whereas I B. am going to enter in the state of matrimony with\r\nMrs. D., therefore I shall from henceforth make it indifferent to me\r\nwhether from this time forward I shall be a fool or a knave: and\r\ntherefore in full and perfect health of body, and as sound mind, not\r\nknowing which of my children will prove better or worse, I give to my\r\nfirst-born, be he perverse, ungrateful, impious, or cruel, the lump\r\nand bulk of my estate, and leave one year's purchase only to each of\r\nmy younger children, whether they shall be brave or beautiful, modest\r\nor honourable, from the time of the date hereof wherein I resign my\r\nsenses, and hereby promise to employ my judgment no further in the\r\ndistribution of my worldly goods from the day of the date hereof,\r\nhereby further confessing and covenanting, that I am from henceforth\r\nmarried and dead in law.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no man that is conversant in modern settlements, but knows\r\nthis is an exact translation of what is inserted in these instruments.\r\nMen's passions could only make them submit to such terms; and therefore\r\nall unreasonable bargains in marriage ought to be set aside, as well as\r\ndeeds extorted from men under force or in prison, who are altogether as\r\nmuch masters of their actions as he that is possessed with a violent\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nHow strangely men are sometimes partial to themselves appears by the\r\nrapine of him that has a daughter's beauty under his direction. He will\r\nmake no scruple of using it to force from her lover as much of his\r\nestate as is worth £10,000, and at the same time, as a Justice on the\r\nBench, will spare no pains to get a man hanged that has taken but a\r\nhorse from him.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped the Legislature will in due time take this kind of\r\nrobbery into consideration, and not suffer men to prey upon each other\r\nwhen they are about making the most solemn league, and entering into\r\nthe strictest bonds. The only sure remedy is to fix a certain rate on\r\nevery woman's fortune; one price for that of a maid, and another for a\r\nwidow: for it is of infinite advantage, that there should be no frauds\r\nor uncertainties in the sale of our women.\r\n\r\nIf any man should exceed the settled rate, he ought to be at liberty\r\nafter seven years are over (by which time his love may be supposed\r\nto abate a little, if it is not founded upon reason) to renounce the\r\nbargain, and be freed from the settlement upon restoring the portion;\r\nas a youth married under fourteen years old may be off if he pleases\r\nwhen he comes to that age, and as a man is discharged from all bargains\r\nbut that of marriage made when he is under twenty-one.\r\n\r\nIt grieves me when I consider, that these restraints upon matrimony\r\ntake away the advantage we should otherwise have over other countries,\r\nwhich are sunk much by those great checks upon propagation, the\r\nconvents. It is thought chiefly owing to these that Italy and Spain\r\nwant above half their complement of people. Were the price of wives\r\nalways fixed and settled, it would contribute to filling the nation\r\nmore than all the encouragements that can possibly be given to\r\nforeigners to transplant themselves hither.\r\n\r\nI therefore, as censor of Britain, till a law is made, will lay down\r\nrules which shall be observed with penalty of degrading all that break\r\nthem into Pretty Fellows, Smarts, Squibs, Hunting-Horns, Drums, and\r\nBagpipes.\r\n\r\nThe females that are guilty of breaking my orders I shall respectively\r\npronounce to be Kits, Hornpipes, Dulcimers, and Kettle-drums. Such\r\nwidows as wear the spoils of one husband I will bury if they attempt to\r\nrob another.\r\n\r\nI ordain, that no woman ever demand one shilling to be paid after\r\nher husband's death, more than the very sum she brings him, or an\r\nequivalent for it in land.\r\n\r\nThat no settlement be made, in which the man settles on his children\r\nmore than the reversion of the jointure, or the value of it in money;\r\nso that at his death he may in the whole be bound to pay his family but\r\ndouble to what he has received. I would have the eldest, as well as the\r\nrest, have his provision out of this.\r\n\r\nWhen men are not able to come up to those settlements I have proposed,\r\nI would have them receive so much of the portion only as they can come\r\nup to, and the rest to go to the woman by way of pin-money, or separate\r\nmaintenance. In this, I think, I determined equally between the two\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nIf any lawyer varies from these rules, or is above two days in drawing\r\na marriage settlement, or uses more words in it than one skin of\r\nparchment will contain, or takes above five pounds for drawing it, I\r\nwould have him thrown over the bar.\r\n\r\nWere these rules observed, a woman with a small fortune, and a great\r\ndeal of worth, would be sure to marry according to her deserts, if the\r\nman's estate were to be less encumbered in proportion as her fortune is\r\nless than he might have with others.\r\n\r\nA man of a great deal of merit, and not much estate, might be chosen\r\nfor his worth; because it would not be difficult for him to make a\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe man that loves a woman best, would not lose her for not being able\r\nto bid so much as another, or for not complying with an extravagant\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nA fine woman would no more be set up to auction as she is now. When a\r\nman puts in for her, her friends or herself take care to publish it;\r\nand the man that was the first bidder is made no other use of but to\r\nraise the price. He that loves her, will continue in waiting as long\r\nas she pleases (if her fortune be thought equal to his), and under\r\npretence of some failure in the rent-roll, or difficulties in drawing\r\nthe settlement, he is put off till a better bargain is made with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the sex that are not rich or beautiful to the highest\r\ndegree are plainly gainers, and would be married so fast, that the\r\nleast charming of them would soon grow beauties to the bachelors.\r\n\r\nWidows might be easily married, if they would not, as they do now, set\r\nup for discreet, only by being mercenary.\r\n\r\nThe making matrimony cheap and easy, would be the greatest\r\ndiscouragement to vice: the limiting the expense of children would\r\nnot make men ill inclined, or afraid of having them in a regular way;\r\nand the men of merit would not live unmarried, as they often do now,\r\nbecause the goodness of a wife cannot be insured to them; but the loss\r\nof an estate is certain, and a man would never have the affliction of a\r\nworthless heir added to that of a bad wife.\r\n\r\nI am the more serious, large, and particular on this subject, because\r\nmy Lucubrations designed for the encouragement of virtue cannot\r\nhave the desired success as long as this encumbrance of settlements\r\ncontinues upon matrimony.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] Steele (or Addison) edited this paper, but the real author was\r\ntheir friend Edward Wortley Montagu, to whom the second volume of the\r\n_Tatler_ was dedicated. Mr. Moy Thomas says that Addison and Steele\r\n\"were in the habit of asking him for hints and heads for papers; and\r\nthere are among the Wortley Manuscripts original sketches of essays\r\nwhich may be found in the _Tatler_.\" This essay on marriage settlements\r\n\"was entirely founded on Mr. Wortley's notes, and is frequently in\r\nhis own words.\" He quarrelled with his future father-in-law because\r\nhe objected to settle his property upon a future son, and he eloped\r\nwith Lady Mary Pierrepont in August 1712. In a letter to Addison which\r\naccompanied the \"loose hints\" for this number, he says, \"What made me\r\nthink so much of it was a discourse with Sir P. King, who says that a\r\nman that settles his estate does not know that two and two make four\"\r\n(\"Letters of Lady M. W. Montagu,\" ed. Moy Thomas, i. 5, 10, 62).

If in one we hear that a sovereign prince is fled from\r\nhis capital city, in the other we hear of a tradesman who hath shut up\r\nhis shop, and run away. If in one we find the victory of a general, in\r\nthe other we see the desertion of a private soldier. I must confess, I\r\nhave a certain weakness in my temper that is often very much affected\r\nby these little domestic occurrences, and have frequently been caught\r\nwith tears in my eyes over a melancholy advertisement.\r\n\r\nBut to consider this subject in its most ridiculous lights,\r\nadvertisements are of great use to the vulgar: first of all, as they\r\nare instruments of ambition. A man that is by no means big enough\r\nfor the _Gazette_, may easily creep into the advertisements; by\r\nwhich means we often see an apothecary in the same paper of news\r\nwith a plenipotentiary, or a running-footman with an ambassador. An\r\nadvertisement from Piccadilly[88] goes down to posterity with an\r\narticle from Madrid; and John Bartlet[89] of Goodman's Fields is\r\ncelebrated in the same paper with the Emperor of Germany. Thus the\r\nfable tells us, that the wren mounted as high as the eagle, by getting\r\nupon his back.\r\n\r\nA second use which this sort of writings have been turned to of late\r\nyears, has been the management of controversy, insomuch that above half\r\nthe advertisements one meets with nowadays are purely polemical. The\r\ninventors of Strops for Razors[90] have written against one another\r\nthis way for several years, and that with great bitterness; as the\r\nwhole argument _pro_ and _con_ in the case of the Morning-gowns[91]\r\nis still carried on after the same manner. I need not mention the\r\nseveral proprietors of Dr. Anderson's pills;[92] nor take notice of the\r\nmany satirical works of this nature so frequently published by Dr.\r\nClark,[93] who has had the confidence to advertise upon that learned\r\nknight, my very worthy friend, Sir William Read.[94] But I shall\r\nnot interpose in their quarrel; Sir William can give him his own in\r\nadvertisements, that, in the judgment of the impartial, are as well\r\npenned as the doctor's.\r\n\r\nThe third and last use of these writings is, to inform the world where\r\nthey may be furnished with almost everything that is necessary for\r\nlife. If a man has pains in his head, colics in his bowels, or spots in\r\nhis clothes, he may here meet with proper cures and remedies. If a man\r\nwould recover a wife or a horse that is stolen or strayed; if he wants\r\nnew sermons, electuaries,[95] ass's milk,[96] or anything else, either\r\nfor his body or his mind, this is the place to look for them in.\r\n\r\nThe great art in writing advertisements, is the finding out a proper\r\nmethod to catch the reader's eye; without which, a good thing may pass\r\nover unobserved, or be lost among commissions of bankrupt. Asterisks\r\nand hands were formerly of great use for this purpose. Of late years,\r\nthe _N.B._ has been much in fashion; as also little cuts and figures,\r\nthe invention of which we must ascribe to the author of Spring Trusses.\r\nI must not here omit the blind Italian character, which being scarce\r\nlegible, always fixes and detains the eye, and gives the curious reader\r\nsomething like the satisfaction of prying into a secret.\r\n\r\nBut the great skill in an advertiser is chiefly seen in the style which\r\nhe makes use of. He is to mention the universal esteem, or general\r\nreputation, of things that were never heard of. If he is a physician\r\nor astrologer, he must change his lodgings frequently, and (though he\r\nnever saw anybody in them besides his own family) give public notice\r\nof it, for the information of the nobility and gentry. Since I am\r\nthus usefully employed in writing criticisms on the works of these\r\ndiminutive authors, I must not pass over in silence an advertisement\r\nwhich has lately made its appearance, and is written altogether in\r\na Ciceronian manner. It was sent to me, with five shillings, to be\r\ninserted among my advertisements; but as it is a pattern of good\r\nwriting in this way, I shall give it a place in the body of my paper:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The highest compounded spirit of lavender, the most glorious (if the\r\nexpression may be used) enlivening scent and flavour that can possibly\r\nbe, which so raptures the spirits, delights the gust, and gives such\r\nairs to the countenance, as are not to be imagined but by those that\r\nhave tried it. The meanest sort of the thing is admired by most\r\ngentlemen and ladies; but this far more, as by far it exceeds it, to\r\nthe gaining among all a more than common esteem. It is sold (in neat\r\nflint bottles fit for the pocket) only at the Golden Key, in Warton's\r\nCourt, near Holborn Bars, for 3s. 6d. with directions.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time that I recommend the several flowers in which this\r\nspirit of lavender is wrapped up (if the expression may be used), I\r\ncannot excuse my fellow-labourers for admitting into their papers\r\nseveral uncleanly advertisements, not at all proper to appear in the\r\nworks of polite writers. Among these I must reckon the Carminative\r\nWind-expelling Pills.[97] If the doctor had called them only his\r\ncarminative pills, he had been as cleanly as one could have wished;\r\nbut the second word entirely destroys the decency of the first. There\r\nare other absurdities of this nature so very gross, that I dare not\r\nmention them; and shall therefore dismiss this subject, with a public\r\nadmonition to Michael Parrot,[98] that he do not presume any more to\r\nmention a certain worm he knows of, which, by the way, has grown seven\r\nfoot in my memory; for, if I am not much mistaken, it is the same that\r\nwas but nine foot long about six months ago.\r\n\r\nBy the remarks I have here made, it plainly appears, that a collection\r\nof advertisements is a kind of miscellany; the writers of which,\r\ncontrary to all authors, except men of quality, give money to the\r\nbooksellers who publish their copies. The genius of the bookseller\r\nis chiefly shown in his method of ranging and digesting these little\r\ntracts. The last paper I took up in my hands, places them in the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n  The True Spanish Blacking for Shoes, &c.[99]\r\n  The Beautifying Cream for the Face, &c.[100]\r\n  Pease and Plaisters, &c.\r\n  Nectar and Ambrosia, &c.[101]\r\n  Four Freehold Tenements of £15 per Annum, &c.[102]\r\n  ⁂ \"The Present State of England,\" &c.[103]\r\n  †‡† \"Annotations upon the _Tatler_,\" &c.[104]\r\n\r\nA Commission of Bankrupt being awarded against B.

The common\r\nfault in this case, is that of growing too intimate, and falling into\r\ndispleasing familiarities: for it is a very ordinary thing for men to\r\nmake no other use of a close acquaintance with each other's affairs,\r\nbut to tease one another with unacceptable allusions. One would pass\r\nover patiently such as converse like animals, and salute each other\r\nwith bangs on the shoulder, sly raps with canes, or other robust\r\npleasantries practised by the rural gentry of this nation: but even\r\namong those who should have more polite ideas of things, you see a set\r\nof people who invert the design of conversation, and make frequent\r\nmention of ungrateful subjects; nay, mention them because they are\r\nungrateful; as if the perfection of society were in knowing how to\r\noffend on the one part, and how to bear an offence on the other. In\r\nall parts of this populous town you find the merry world made up of\r\nan active and a passive companion; one who has good-nature enough to\r\nsuffer all his friend shall think fit to say, and one who is resolved\r\nto make the most of his good-humour to show his parts. In the trading\r\npart of mankind, I have ever observed the jest went by the weight of\r\npurses, and the ridicule is made up by the gains which arise from it.\r\nThus the packer allows the clothier to say what he pleases, and the\r\nbroker has his countenance ready to laugh with the merchant, though the\r\nabuse is to fall on himself, because he knows that, as a go-between,\r\nhe shall find his account in being in the good graces of a man of\r\nwealth. Among these just and punctual people, the richest man is ever\r\nthe better jester; and they know no such thing as a person who shall\r\npretend to a superior laugh at a man, who does not make him amends\r\nby opportunities of advantage in another kind: but among people of a\r\ndifferent way, where the pretended distinction in company is only what\r\nis raised from sense and understanding, it is very absurd to carry on\r\na rough raillery so far, as that the whole discourse should turn upon\r\neach other's infirmities, follies, or misfortunes.\r\n\r\nI was this evening with a set of wags of this class. They appear\r\ngenerally by two and two; and what is most extraordinary, is, that\r\nthose very persons who are most together, appear least of a mind\r\nwhen joined by other company. This evil proceeds from an indiscreet\r\nfamiliarity, whereby a man is allowed to say the most grating thing\r\nimaginable to another, and it shall be accounted weakness to show\r\nan impatience for the unkindness. But this and all other deviations\r\nfrom the design of pleasing each other when we meet, are derived\r\nfrom interlopers in society, who want capacity to put in a stock\r\namong regular companions, and therefore supply their wants by stale\r\nhistories, sly observations, and rude hints, which relate to the\r\nconduct of others. All cohabitants in general run into this unhappy\r\nfault; men and their wives break into reflections which are like so\r\nmuch Arabic to the rest of the company; sisters and brothers often\r\nmake the like figure from the same unjust sense of the art of being\r\nintimate and familiar. It is often said, such a one cannot stand the\r\nmention of such a circumstance: if he cannot, I am sure it is for want\r\nof discourse, or a worse reason, that any companion of his touches upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity, among the truly well-bred, never gives authority to\r\ntrespass upon one another in the most minute circumstance, but it\r\nallows to be kinder than we ought otherwise presume to be. Eusebius\r\nhas wit, humour, and spirit; but there never was a man in his company\r\nwho wished he had less, for he understands familiarity so well, that\r\nhe knows how to make use of it in a way that neither makes himself or\r\nhis friend contemptible; but if any one is lessened by his freedom,\r\nit is he himself, who always likes the place, the diet, and the\r\nreception, when he is in the company of his friends. Equality is the\r\nlife of conversation; and he is as much out who assumes to himself\r\nany part above another, as he who considers himself below the rest\r\nof the society. Familiarity in inferiors is sauciness; in superiors,\r\ncondescension; neither of which are to have being among companions,\r\nthe very word implying that they are to be equal. When therefore we\r\nhave abstracted the company from all considerations of their quality or\r\nfortune, it will immediately appear, that to make it happy and polite,\r\nthere must nothing be started which shall discover that our thoughts\r\nrun upon any such distinctions. Hence it will arise, that benevolence\r\nmust become the rule of society, and he that is most obliging must be\r\nmost diverting.\r\n\r\nThis way of talking I am fallen into from the reflection that I am\r\nwherever I go entertained with some absurdity, mistake, weakness, or\r\nill luck of some man or other, whom not only I, but the person who\r\nmakes me those relations has a value for. It would therefore be a\r\ngreat benefit to the world, if it could be brought to pass that no\r\nstory should be a taking one, but what was to the advantage of the\r\nperson of whom it is related. By this means, he that is now a wit in\r\nconversation, would be considered as a spreader of false news is in\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBut above all, to make a familiar fit for a bosom friend, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that we should always be inclined rather to hide\r\nthan rally each other's infirmities. To suffer for a fault is a sort\r\nof atonement; and nobody is concerned for the offence for which he has\r\nmade reparation.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--I have received the following letter, which rallies me\r\nfor being witty sooner than I designed; but I have now altered\r\nmy resolution, and intend to be facetious till the day in October\r\nheretofore mentioned, instead of beginning for that day.[106]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                        _Sept. 6, 1710_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"By your own reckoning, you came yesterday about a month before the\r\ntime you looked yourself, much to the satisfaction of\r\n\r\n  \"Your most obliged\r\n            \"Humble Servant,\r\n                      \"PLAIN ENGLISH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 15._\r\n\r\nAdvices from Madrid of the 8th say, the Duke of Anjou, with his Court,\r\nand all the Councils, were preparing to leave that place in a day or\r\ntwo, in order to remove to Valladolid.

This sudden departure is attributed\r\nto the advice that the Portuguese army was in motion to enter Spain by\r\nBraganza, and that his Catholic Majesty was on the march with a strong\r\ndetachment towards Castille. Two thousand horse were arrived at Agreda,\r\nand it is reported they were to join the rest of the body, with the\r\nKing, and advance to Calatayud, on their way to Madrid, whilst General\r\nStaremberg observed the enemy on the frontier of Navarre.

For\r\nthis reason I shall here publish to the world the life of a person\r\nwho was neither man nor woman, as written by one of my ingenious\r\ncorrespondents, who seems to have imitated Plutarch in that\r\nmultifarious erudition, and those occasional dissertations, which he\r\nhas wrought into the body of his history. The Life I am putting out,\r\nis that of Margery, _alias_ John Young, commonly known by the name of\r\nDr. Young, who (as the town very well knows) was a woman that practised\r\nphysic in man's clothes, and after having had two wives and several\r\nchildren, died about a month since.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I here make bold to trouble you with a short account of the famous\r\nDr. Young's life, which you may call (if you please) a second part\r\nof the farce of the 'Sham Doctor.' This perhaps will not seem so\r\nstrange to you, who (if I am not mistaken) have somewhere mentioned\r\nwith honour your sister Kirleus[107] as a practitioner both in physic\r\nand astrology: but in the common opinion of mankind, a she-quack is\r\naltogether as strange and astonishing a creature as the centaur\r\nthat practised physic in the days of Achilles, or as King Phys in\r\n'The Rehearsal.'[108] Æsculapius, the great founder of your art,\r\nwas particularly famous for his beard, as we may conclude from the\r\nbehaviour of a tyrant who is branded by heathen historians as guilty\r\nboth of sacrilege and blasphemy, having robbed the statue of Æsculapius\r\nof a thick bushy golden beard, and then alleged for his excuse, that\r\nit was a shame the son should have a beard when his father Apollo had\r\nnone. This latter instance indeed seems something to favour a female\r\nprofessor, since (as I have been told) the ancient statues of Apollo\r\nare generally made with the head and face of a woman: nay, I have been\r\ncredibly informed by those who have seen them both, that the famous\r\nApollo in the Belvedere did very much resemble Dr. Young. Let that be\r\nas it will, the doctor was a kind of Amazon in physic, that made as\r\ngreat devastations and slaughters as any of our chief heroes in the\r\nart, and was as fatal to the English in these our days, as the famous\r\nJoan d'Arc was in those of our forefathers.\r\n\r\n\"I do not find anything remarkable in the Life I am about to write\r\ntill the year 1695, at which time the doctor, being about twenty-three\r\nyears old, was brought to bed of a bastard child. The scandal of such\r\na misfortune gave so great uneasiness to pretty Mrs. Peggy (for that\r\nwas the name by which the doctor was then called), that she left her\r\nfamily, and followed her lover to London, with a fixed resolution some\r\nway or other to recover her lost reputation: but instead of changing\r\nher life, which one would have expected from so good a disposition of\r\nmind, she took it in her head to change her sex. This was soon done by\r\nthe help of a sword and a pair of breeches. I have reason to believe,\r\nthat her first design was to turn man-midwife, having herself had some\r\nexperience in those affairs: but thinking this too narrow a foundation\r\nfor her future fortune, she at length bought her a gold button coat,\r\nand set up for a physician. Thus we see the same fatal miscarriage in\r\nher youth made Mrs. Young a doctor, that formerly made one of the same\r\nsex a Pope.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor succeeded very well in his business at first, but very\r\noften met with accidents that disquieted him. As he wanted that deep\r\nmagisterial voice which gives authority to a prescription, and is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the right pronouncing of those words, 'Take\r\nthese pills,' he unfortunately got the nickname of the Squeaking\r\nDoctor. If this circumstance alarmed the doctor, there was another that\r\ngave him no small disquiet, and very much diminished his gains. In\r\nshort, he found himself run down as a superficial prating quack in all\r\nfamilies that had at the head of them a cautious father or a jealous\r\nhusband. These would often complain among one another, that they did\r\nnot like such a smock-faced physician; though in truth had they known\r\nhow justly he deserved that name, they would rather have favoured his\r\npractice than have apprehended anything from it.\r\n\r\n\"Such were the motives that determined Mrs. Young to change her\r\ncondition, and take in marriage a virtuous young woman, who lived\r\nwith her in good reputation, and made her the father of a very pretty\r\ngirl. But this part of her happiness was soon after destroyed by a\r\ndistemper which was too hard for our physician, and carried off his\r\nfirst wife. The doctor had not been a widow long before he married his\r\nsecond lady, with whom also he lived in very good understanding. It\r\nso happened that the doctor was with child at the same time that his\r\nlady was; but the little ones coming both together, they passed for\r\ntwins. The doctor having entirely established the reputation of his\r\nmanhood, especially by the birth of the boy of whom he had been lately\r\ndelivered, and who very much resembles him, grew into good business,\r\nand was particularly famous for the cure of venereal distempers; but\r\nwould have had much more practice among his own sex, had not some of\r\nthem been so unreasonable as to demand certain proofs of their cure,\r\nwhich the doctor was not able to give them. The florid blooming look,\r\nwhich gave the doctor some uneasiness at first, instead of betraying\r\nhis person, only recommended his physic. Upon this occasion I cannot\r\nforbear mentioning what I thought a very agreeable surprise in one\r\nof Molière's plays, where a young woman applies herself to a sick\r\nperson in the habit of a quack, and speaks to her patient, who was\r\nsomething scandalised at the youth of his physician, to the following\r\npurpose: 'I began to practise in the reign of Francis I., and am now\r\nin the hundred-and-fiftieth year of my age; but, by the virtue of my\r\nmedicaments, have maintained myself in the same beauty and freshness I\r\nhad at fifteen.' For this reason Hippocrates lays it down as a rule,\r\nthat a student in physic should have a sound constitution and a healthy\r\nlook, which indeed seem as necessary qualifications for a physician as\r\na good life and virtuous behaviour for a divine. But to return to our\r\nsubject. About two years ago the doctor was very much afflicted with\r\nthe vapours, which grew upon him to such a degree, that about six weeks\r\nsince they made an end of him. His death discovered the disguise he had\r\nacted under, and brought him back again to his former sex. 'Tis said,\r\nthat at his burial the pall was held up by six women of some fashion.\r\nThe doctor left behind him a widow and two fatherless children, if\r\nthey may be called so, besides the little boy before mentioned; in\r\nrelation to whom we may say of the doctor, as the good old ballad about\r\nthe 'Children in the Wood' says of the unnatural uncle, that he was\r\nfather and mother both in one. These are all the circumstances that I\r\ncould learn of Dr. Young's life, which might have given occasion to\r\nmany obscene fictions: but as I know those would never have gained a\r\nplace in your paper, I have not troubled you with any impertinence of\r\nthat nature; having stuck to the truth very scrupulously, as I always\r\ndo when I subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n                              \"Your, &c.\r\n\r\n\"I shall add, as a postscript to this letter, that I am informed, the\r\nfamous Saltero,[109] who sells coffee in his museum at Chelsea, has by\r\nhim a curiosity which helped the doctor to carry on his imposture, and\r\nwill give great satisfaction to the curious inquirer.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[107] See No. 14.\r\n\r\n[108] The Physician was one of the usurping Kings of Brentford.\r\n\r\n[109] See No. 34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 227.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Sept. 19_, to _Thursday, Sept. 21, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Omnibus invideas, Zoile,[110] nemo tibi.--MARTIAL, Epig. i. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 20._\r\n\r\nIt is the business of reason and philosophy to soothe and allay the\r\npassions of the mind, or turn them to a vigorous prosecution of what\r\nis dictated by the understanding. In order to this good end, I would\r\nkeep a watchful eye upon the growing inclinations of youth, and be\r\nparticularly careful to prevent their indulging themselves in such\r\nsentiments as may embitter their more advanced age. I have now under\r\ncure a young gentleman, who lately communicated to me, that he was of\r\nall men living the most miserably envious. I desired the circumstances\r\nof his distemper; upon which, with a sigh that would have moved the\r\nmost inhuman breast: \"Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said he, \"I am nephew to a\r\ngentleman of a very great estate, to whose favour I have a cousin that\r\nhas equal pretensions with myself. This kinsman of mine is a young\r\nman of the highest merit imaginable, and has a mind so tender and so\r\ngenerous, that I can observe he returns my envy with pity. He makes me\r\nupon all occasions the most obliging condescensions: and I cannot but\r\ntake notice of the concern he is in to see my life blasted with this\r\nracking passion, though it is against himself. In the presence of my\r\nuncle, when I am in the room, he never speaks so well as he is capable\r\nof, but always lowers his talents and accomplishments out of regard to\r\nme. What I beg of you, dear sir, is to instruct me how to love him,\r\nas I know he does me; and I beseech you, if possible, to set my heart\r\nright, that it may no longer be tormented where it should be pleased,\r\nor hate a man whom I cannot but approve.\"\r\n\r\nThe patient gave me this account with such candour and openness, that\r\nI conceived immediate hopes of his cure; because in diseases of the\r\nmind the person affected is half recovered when he is sensible of his\r\ndistemper. \"Sir,\" said I, \"the acknowledgment of your kinsman's merit\r\nis a very hopeful symptom; for it is the nature of persons afflicted\r\nwith this evil, when they are incurable, to pretend a contempt of the\r\nperson envied, if they are taxed with that weakness. A man who is\r\nreally envious will not allow he is so; but upon such an accusation is\r\ntormented with the reflection, that to envy a man is to allow him your\r\nsuperior. But in your case, when you examine the bottom of your heart,\r\nI am apt to think it is avarice which you mistake for envy. Were it not\r\nthat you have both expectations from the same man, you would look upon\r\nyour cousin's accomplishments with pleasure. You that now consider him\r\nas an obstacle to your interest, would then behold him as an ornament\r\nto your family.\" I observed my patient upon this occasion recover\r\nhimself in some measure; and he owned to me, that he hoped it was as\r\nI imagined; for that in all places but where he was his rival, he had\r\npleasure in his company. This was the first discourse we had upon this\r\nmalady; and I do not doubt but, after two or three more, I shall by\r\njust degrees soften his envy into emulation.\r\n\r\nSuch an envy as I have here described may possibly creep into an\r\ningenuous mind; but the envy which makes a man uneasy to himself and\r\nothers, is a certain distortion and perverseness of temper, that\r\nrenders him unwilling to be pleased with anything without him that\r\nhas either beauty or perfection in it. I look upon it as a distemper\r\nin the mind (which I know no moralist that has described in this\r\nlight), when a man cannot discern anything which another is master\r\nof that is agreeable. For which reason I look upon the good-natured\r\nman to be endowed with a certain discerning faculty which the envious\r\nare altogether deprived of. Shallow wits, superficial critics, and\r\nconceited fops are with me so many blind men in respect of excellences.\r\nThey can behold nothing but faults and blemishes, and indeed see\r\nnothing that is worth seeing. Show them a poem, it is stuff; a picture,\r\nit is daubing. They find nothing in architecture that is not irregular,\r\nor in music that is not out of tune. These men should consider, that\r\nit is their envy which deforms everything, and that the ugliness is\r\nnot in the object, but in the eye. And as for nobler minds, whose\r\nmerits are either not discovered, or are misrepresented by the envious\r\npart of mankind, they should rather consider their defamers with pity\r\nthan indignation. A man cannot have an idea of perfection in another\r\nwhich he was never sensible of in himself. Mr. Locke tells us, that\r\nupon asking a blind man, what he thought scarlet was, he answered,\r\nthat he believed it was like the sound of a trumpet. He was forced to\r\nform his conceptions of ideas which he had not by those which he had.\r\nIn the same manner, ask an envious man, what he thinks of virtue? he\r\nwill call it design: what of good-nature? and he will term it dulness.\r\nThe difference is, that as the person before mentioned was born blind,\r\nyour envious men have contracted the distemper themselves, and are\r\ntroubled with a sort of an acquired blindness. Thus the devil in\r\nMilton, though made an angel of light, could see nothing to please him\r\neven in Paradise, and hated our first parents, though in their state of\r\ninnocence.[111]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[110] \"Livide\" (Martial).\r\n\r\n[111] \"Paradise Lost,\" iv. 358 seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 228.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n       From _Thursday, Sept. 21_, to _Saturday, Sept. 23, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    ----Veniet manus, auxilio quæ\r\n    Sit mihi----\r\n\r\n                                                   HOR., 1 Sat. iv. 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Sept. 22._\r\n\r\nA man of business who makes a public entertainment, may sometimes leave\r\nhis guests, and beg them to divert themselves as well as they can\r\ntill his return.

I have now been\r\nsome time in holy orders, and fellow of a certain college in one of\r\nthe universities; but weary of that inactive life, I resolve to be\r\ndoing good in my generation. A worthy gentleman has lately offered me\r\na fat rectory, but means, I perceive, his kinswoman should have the\r\nbenefit of the clergy.

You know very well, that in our ordinary almanacs, the\r\nwind and rain, snow and hail, clouds and sunshine, have their proper\r\nseasons, and come up as regularly in their several months as the fruits\r\nand plants of the earth.[113] As for my own part, I freely own to you\r\nthat I generally steal my weather out of some antiquated almanac that\r\nforetold it several years ago. Now, sir, what I humbly beg of you is,\r\nthat you would lend me your State weather-glass, in order to fill up\r\nthis vacant column in my works. This, I know, would sell my almanac\r\nbeyond any other, and make me a richer man than Poor Robin.[114] If you\r\nwill not grant me this favour, I must have recourse to my old method,\r\nand will copy after an almanac which I have by me, and which I think\r\nwas made for the year when the great storm was.

A flea has a thousand invisible insects that tease him\r\nas he jumps from place to place, and revenge our quarrels upon him.\r\nA very ordinary microscope shows us that a louse is itself a very\r\nlousy creature. A whale, besides those seas and oceans in the several\r\nvessels of his body, which are filled with innumerable shoals of little\r\nanimals, carries about it a whole world of inhabitants; insomuch that,\r\nif we believe the calculations some have made, there are more living\r\ncreatures which are too small for the naked eye to behold about the\r\nleviathan, than there are of visible creatures upon the face of the\r\nwhole earth. Thus every nobler creature is as it were the basis and\r\nsupport of multitudes that are his inferiors.\r\n\r\nThis consideration very much comforts me, when I think on those\r\nnumberless vermin that feed upon this paper, and find their sustenance\r\nout of it: I mean, the small wits and scribblers that every day turn\r\na penny by nibbling at my Lucubrations. This has been so advantageous\r\nto this little species of writers, that, if they do me justice, I may\r\nexpect to have my statue erected in Grub Street, as being a common\r\nbenefactor to that quarter.\r\n\r\nThey say, when a fox is very much troubled with fleas, he goes into\r\nthe next pool with a little lock of wool in his mouth, and keeps his\r\nbody under water till the vermin get into it, after which he quits the\r\nwool, and diving, leaves his tormentors to shift for themselves, and\r\nget their livelihood where they can. I would have these gentlemen take\r\ncare that I do not serve them after the same manner; for though I have\r\nhitherto kept my temper pretty well, it is not impossible but I may\r\nsome time or other disappear; and what will then become of them? Should\r\nI lay down my paper, what a famine would there be among the hawkers,\r\nprinters, booksellers, and authors? It would be like Dr. B----'s[116]\r\ndropping his cloak, with the whole congregation hanging upon the\r\nskirts of it. To enumerate some of these my doughty antagonists, I\r\nwas threatened to be answered weekly _Tit for Tat_: I was undermined\r\nby the _Whisperer_, haunted by _Tom Brown's Ghost_, scolded at by\r\na _Female Tatler_, and slandered by another of the same character,\r\nunder the title of _Atalantis_. I have been _annotated_, _re-tattled_,\r\n_examined_, and _condoled_;[117] but it being my standing maxim never\r\nto speak ill of the dead, I shall let these authors rest in peace, and\r\ntake great pleasure in thinking that I have sometimes been the means\r\nof their getting a bellyful. When I see myself thus surrounded by such\r\nformidable enemies, I often think of the Knight of the Red Cross in\r\nSpenser's \"Den of Error,\" who after he has cut off the dragon's head,\r\nand left it wallowing in a flood of ink, sees a thousand monstrous\r\nreptiles making their attempts upon him, one with many heads, another\r\nwith none, and all of them without eyes.\r\n\r\n      _The same so sore annoyèd has the knight,\r\n      That well-nigh chokèd with the deadly stink,\r\n      His forces fail, he can no longer fight;\r\n      Whose courage when the fiend perceived to shrink,\r\n      She pourèd forth out of her hellish sink\r\n      Her fruitful cursèd spawn of serpents small,\r\n      Deformèd monsters, foul, and black as ink;\r\n      Which swarming all about his legs did crawl,\r\n    And him encumbered sore, but could not hurt at all._\r\n\r\n      _As gentle shepherd in sweet eventide,\r\n      When ruddy Phœbus 'gins to welk in West,\r\n      High on an hill, his flock to viewen wide,\r\n      Marks which do bite their hasty supper best;\r\n      A cloud of cumbrous gnats do him molest,\r\n      All striving to infix their feeble stings,\r\n      That from their 'noyance he nowhere can rest;\r\n      But with his clownish hands their tender wings\r\n    He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings._[118]\r\n\r\nIf ever I should want such a fry of little authors to attend me, I\r\nshall think my paper in a very decaying condition. They are like ivy\r\nabout an oak, which adorns the tree at the same time that it eats into\r\nit; or like a great man's equipage, that do honour to the person on\r\nwhom they feed. For my part, when I see myself thus attacked, I do not\r\nconsider my antagonists as malicious, but hungry, and therefore am\r\nresolved never to take any notice of them.\r\n\r\nAs for those who detract from my labours without being prompted to it\r\nby an empty stomach, in return to their censures I shall take pains to\r\nexcel, and never fail to persuade myself, that their enmity is nothing\r\nbut their envy or ignorance.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to conclude, like an old man and a moralist, with a fable:\r\n\r\nThe owls, bats, and several other birds of night, were one day got\r\ntogether in a thick shade, where they abused their neighbours in a very\r\nsociable manner. Their satire at last fell upon the sun, whom they\r\nall agreed to be very troublesome, impertinent, and inquisitive. Upon\r\nwhich the sun, who overheard them, spoke to them after this manner:\r\n\"Gentlemen, I wonder how you dare abuse one that you know could in an\r\ninstant scorch you up, and burn every mother's son of you: but the\r\nonly answer I shall give you, or the revenge I shall take of you, is,\r\nto _shine on_.\"[119]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[116] Daniel Burgess (see No. 66).\r\n\r\n[117] The first number of _Tit for Tat_ appeared under the name\r\nof Jo. Partridge, Esq., on March 2, 1710, with an announcement of\r\nBickerstaff's death; probably it reached only to five numbers. Of the\r\n_Whisperer_ (October 11, 1709), and the _Gazette à-la-Mode, or Tom\r\nBrown's Ghost_ (May 12, 1709), only single numbers are known. The\r\n_Female Tatler_, issued by Thomas Baker, lasted from July 8, 1709,\r\nto March 31, 1710; and there was a rival paper, with the same title,\r\nprinted for A Baldwin. The \"New Atalantis,\" Mrs. Manley's well-known\r\nbook, contained more than one attack on Steele. \"Annotated\" refers to\r\nthe satirical \"Annotations upon the _Tatler_,\" 1710 (see No. 224);\r\nand \"condoled,\" to a pamphlet, \"A Condoling Letter to the _Tatler_;\r\non account of the misfortunes of Isaac Bickerstaff, a prisoner in the\r\n---- on suspicion of debt\" (September 19, 1710). The Tory _Examiner_\r\nhad much to say about the _Tatler_ and Steele's subsequent writings.\r\nNothing is known of a _Re-Tatler_.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" wrote Defoe, \"I have always thought that the weakest\r\nstep the Tatler ever took, if that complete author can be said to\r\nhave done anything weak, was to stoop to take the least notice of the\r\nbarkings of the animals that have condoled him, examined him, &c.

The affectation of\r\npoliteness is exposed in this epistle with a great deal of wit and\r\ndiscernment; so that whatever discourses I may fall into hereafter upon\r\nthe subjects the writer treats of, I shall at present lay the matter\r\nbefore the world without the least alteration from the words of my\r\ncorrespondent.[120]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                       To ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"There are some abuses among us of great consequence, the reformation\r\nof which is properly your province; though as far as I have been\r\nconversant in your papers, you have not yet considered them. These are\r\nthe deplorable ignorance that for some years hath reigned among our\r\nEnglish writers, the great depravity of our taste, and the continual\r\ncorruption of our style. I say nothing here of those who handle\r\nparticular sciences, divinity, law, physic, and the like; I mean the\r\ntraders in history and politics, and the _belles lettres_; together\r\nwith those by whom books are not translated, but (as the common\r\nexpressions are) done out of French, Latin, or other language, and made\r\nEnglish. I cannot but observe to you, that till of late years a Grub\r\nStreet book was always bound in sheepskin, with suitable print and\r\npaper, the price never above a shilling, and taken off wholly by common\r\ntradesmen or country pedlars; but now they appear in all sizes and\r\nshapes, and in all places. They are handed about from lapfuls in every\r\ncoffee-house to persons of quality; are shown in Westminster Hall and\r\nthe Court of Requests. You may see them gilt and in royal paper of five\r\nor six hundred pages, and rated accordingly. I would engage to furnish\r\nyou with a catalogue of English books published within the compass of\r\nseven years past, which at the first hand would cost you a hundred\r\npounds, wherein you shall not be able to find ten lines together of\r\ncommon grammar or common sense.\r\n\r\n\"These two evils, ignorance and want of taste, have produced a third;\r\nI mean the continual corruption of our English tongue, which, without\r\nsome timely remedy, will suffer more by the false refinements of twenty\r\nyears past than it hath been improved in the foregoing hundred. And\r\nthis is what I design chiefly to enlarge upon, leaving the former evils\r\nto your animadversion.\r\n\r\n\"But instead of giving you a list of the late refinements crept into\r\nour language, I here send you the copy of a letter I received some time\r\nago from a most accomplished person in this way of writing; upon which\r\nI shall make some remarks. It is in these terms:\r\n\r\n  \"'SIR,\r\n\r\n\"'I _cou'dn't_ get the things you sent for all _about town_. I _thôt_\r\nto _ha'_ come down myself, and then _I'd h' bôt 'um_; but I _ha'n't\r\ndon't_, and I believe I _can't d't, that's pozz_. Tom[121] begins\r\nto _gi'mself_ airs, because _he's_ going with the _plenipo's_. 'Tis\r\nsaid the French King will _bamboozl' us agen_, which _causes many\r\nspeculations_. The Jacks and others of that _kidney_ are very _uppish_,\r\nand _alert upon't_, as you may see by their _phizz's_. Will Hazzard has\r\ngot the _hipps_, having lost _to the tune of_ five hundr'd pound, _thô_\r\nhe understands play very well, _nobody better_. He has promis't me upon\r\n_rep_, to leave off play; but you know 'tis a weakness _he's_ too apt\r\nto _give into, thô_ he has as much wit as any man, _nobody more_. He\r\nhas lain _incog._ ever since. The _mobb's_ very quiet with us now. I\r\nbelieve you _thôt_ I _bantr'd_ you in my last like a _country put_. I\r\n_shan't_ leave town this month,' &c.\r\n\r\n\"This letter is in every point an admirable pattern of the present\r\npolite way of writing, nor is it of less authority for being an\r\nepistle: you may gather every flower in it, with a thousand more\r\nof equal sweetness, from the books, pamphlets, and single papers,\r\noffered us every day in the coffee-houses: and these are the beauties\r\nintroduced to supply the want of wit, sense, humour, and learning,\r\nwhich formerly were looked upon as qualifications for a writer. If\r\na man of wit, who died forty years ago, were to rise from the grave\r\non purpose, how would he be able to read this letter? And after he\r\nhad got through that difficulty, how would he be able to understand\r\nit? The first thing that strikes your eye is the breaks at the end of\r\nalmost every sentence, of which I know not the use, only that it is a\r\nrefinement, and very frequently practised. Then you will observe the\r\nabbreviations and elisions, by which consonants of most obdurate sound\r\nare joined together, without one softening vowel to intervene; and\r\nall this only to make one syllable of two, directly contrary to the\r\nexample of the Greeks and Romans, altogether of the Gothic strain, and\r\na natural tendency towards relapsing into barbarity, which delights\r\nin monosyllables, and uniting of mute consonants, as it is observable\r\nin all the Northern languages. And this is still more visible in the\r\nnext refinement, which consists in pronouncing the first syllable in\r\na word that has many, and dismissing the rest; such as phizz, hipps,\r\nmobb, pozz, rep, and many more, when we are already overloaded with\r\nmonosyllables, which are the disgrace of our language. Thus we cram one\r\nsyllable, and cut off the rest, as the owl fattened her mice after she\r\nhad bit off their legs, to prevent them from running away; and if ours\r\nbe the same reason for maiming our words, it will certainly answer the\r\nend, for I am sure no other nation will desire to borrow them. Some\r\nwords are hitherto but fairly split, and therefore only in their way\r\nto perfection, as incog. and plenipo; but in a short time, 'tis to be\r\nhoped, they will be further docked to inc. and plen. This reflection\r\nhas made me of late years very impatient for a peace, which I believe\r\nwould save the lives of many brave words, as well as men. The war has\r\nintroduced abundance of polysyllables, which will never be able to\r\nlive many more campaigns. Speculations, operations, preliminaries,\r\nambassadors, palisadoes, communication, circumvallation, battalions,\r\nas numerous as they are, if they attack us too frequently in our\r\ncoffee-houses, we shall certainly put them to flight, and cut off the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\n\"The third refinement observable in the letter I send you, consists in\r\nthe choice of certain words invented by some pretty fellows, such as\r\nbanter, bamboozle, country put, and kidney, as it is there applied,\r\nsome of which are now struggling for the vogue, and others are in\r\npossession of it. I have done my utmost for some years past to stop\r\nthe progress of mobb and banter, but have been plainly borne down by\r\nnumbers, and betrayed by those who promised to assist me.\r\n\r\n\"In the last place, you are to take notice of certain choice phrases\r\nscattered through the letter, some of them tolerable enough, till they\r\nwere worn to rags by servile imitators. You might easily find them,\r\nthough they were not in a different print, and therefore I need not\r\ndisturb them.\r\n\r\n\"These are the false refinements in our style which you ought to\r\ncorrect: first, by argument and fair means; but if those fail, I think\r\nyou are to make use of your authority as censor, and by an annual\r\n'Index Expurgatorius' expunge all words and phrases that are offensive\r\nto good sense, and condemn those barbarous mutilations of vowels and\r\nsyllables. In this last point the usual pretence is, that they spell as\r\nthey speak: a noble standard for language! To depend upon the caprice\r\nof every coxcomb, who, because words are the clothing of our thoughts,\r\ncuts them out and shapes them as he pleases, and changes them oftener\r\nthan his dress. I believe all reasonable people would be content that\r\nsuch refiners were more sparing in their words and liberal in their\r\nsyllables: and upon this head I should be glad you would bestow some\r\nadvice upon several young readers in our churches, who coming up from\r\nthe university full fraught with admiration of our town politeness,\r\nwill needs correct the style of their prayer-books. In reading the\r\nAbsolution, they are very careful to say 'pardons' and 'absolves';\r\nand in the prayer for the royal family it must be 'endue 'um, enrich\r\n'um, prosper 'um, and bring 'um.' Then in their sermons they use all\r\nthe modern terms of art: sham, banter, mob, bubble, bully, cutting,\r\nshuffling, and palming; all which, and many more of the like stamp, as\r\nI have heard them often in the pulpit from such young sophisters, so\r\nI have read them in some of those sermons that have made most noise\r\nof late. The design, it seems, is to avoid the dreadful imputation\r\nof pedantry; to show us that they know the town, understand men and\r\nmanners, and have not been poring upon old unfashionable books in the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to see you the instrument of introducing into our\r\nstyle that simplicity which is the best and truest ornament of most\r\nthings in life, which the politer ages always aimed at in their\r\nbuilding and dress (_simplex munditiis_), as well as their productions\r\nof wit. It is manifest, that all new affected modes of speech,\r\nwhether borrowed from the court, the town, or the theatre, are the\r\nfirst perishing parts in any language; and, as I could prove by many\r\nhundred instances, have been so in ours. The writings of Hooker, who\r\nwas a country clergyman, and of Parsons the Jesuit, both in the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, are in a style that, with very few allowances,\r\nwould not offend any present reader; much more clear and intelligible\r\nthan those of Sir H. Wootton, Sir Rob. Naunton, Osborn, Daniel the\r\nhistorian, and several others who wrote later; but being men of the\r\ncourt, and affecting the phrases then in fashion, they are often either\r\nnot to be understood, or appear perfectly ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"What remedies are to be applied to these evils, I have not room to\r\nconsider, having, I fear, already taken up most of your paper. Besides,\r\nI think it is our office only to represent abuses, and yours to redress\r\nthem. I am with great respect,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n                             \"Your, &c.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] Swift was author of the letter which fills the remainder of\r\nthis paper.

We have a sort of proverbial expression, of taking a\r\nwoman down in her wedding shoes, if you would bring her to reason. An\r\nearly behaviour of this sort had a very remarkable good effect in a\r\nfamily wherein I was several years an intimate acquaintance.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in Lincolnshire[122] had four daughters, three of which\r\nwere early married very happily; but the fourth, though no way\r\ninferior to any of her sisters, either in person or accomplishments,\r\nhad from her infancy discovered so imperious a temper (usually called a\r\nhigh spirit), that it continually made great uneasiness in the family,\r\nbecame her known character in the neighbourhood, and deterred all\r\nher lovers from declaring themselves. However, in process of time, a\r\ngentleman of a plentiful fortune and long acquaintance, having observed\r\nthat quickness of spirit to be her only fault, made his addresses, and\r\nobtained her consent in due form. The lawyers finished the writings\r\n(in which, by the way, there was no pin-money), and they were married.\r\nAfter a decent time spent in the father's house, the bridegroom went\r\nto prepare his seat for her reception. During the whole course of his\r\ncourtship, though a man of the most equal temper, he had artificially\r\nlamented to her, that he was the most passionate creature breathing. By\r\nthis one intimation, he at once made her understand warmth of temper\r\nto be what he ought to pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her\r\nagainst that constitution in himself. She at the same time thought\r\nherself highly obliged by the composed behaviour which he maintained\r\nin her presence. Thus far he with great success soothed her from being\r\nguilty of violences, and still resolved to give her such a terrible\r\napprehension of his fiery spirit, that she should never dream of giving\r\nway to her own. He returned on the day appointed for carrying her home;\r\nbut instead of a coach and six horses, together with the gay equipage\r\nsuitable to the occasion, he appeared without a servant, mounted on the\r\nskeleton of a horse which his huntsman had the day before brought in\r\nto feast his dogs on the arrival of their new mistress, with a pillion\r\nfixed behind, and a case of pistols before him, attended only by a\r\nfavourite hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging (but somewhat\r\npositive) manner desired his lady to seat herself on the cushion; which\r\ndone, away they crawled. The road being obstructed by a gate, the dog\r\nwas commanded to open it: the poor cur looked up and wagged his tail;\r\nbut the master, to show the impatience of his temper, drew a pistol and\r\nshot him dead. He had no sooner done it, but he fell into a thousand\r\napologies for his unhappy rashness, and begged as many pardons for his\r\nexcesses before one for whom he had so profound a respect. Soon after\r\ntheir steed stumbled, but with some difficulty recovered: however,\r\nthe bridegroom took occasion to swear, if he frightened his wife so\r\nagain, he would run him through: and alas! the poor animal being now\r\nalmost tired, made a second trip; immediately on which the careful\r\nhusband alights, and with great ceremony first takes off his lady,\r\nthen the accoutrements, draws his sword, and saves the huntsman the\r\ntrouble of killing him: then says to his wife, \"Child, prithee take\r\nup the saddle;\" which she readily did, and tugged it home, where they\r\nfound all things in the greatest order, suitable to their fortune and\r\nthe present occasion. Some time after the father of the lady gave an\r\nentertainment to all his daughters and their husbands, where, when\r\nthe wives were retired, and the gentlemen passing a toast about, our\r\nlast married man took occasion to observe to the rest of his brethren,\r\nhow much, to his great satisfaction, he found the world mistaken as\r\nto the temper of his lady, for that she was the most meek and humble\r\nwoman breathing. The applause was received with a loud laugh: but as a\r\ntrial which of them would appear the most master at home, he proposed\r\nthey should all by turns send for their wives down to them. A servant\r\nwas despatched, and answer was made by one, \"Tell him I will come\r\nby-and-by;\" another, that she would come when the cards were out of\r\nher hand; and so on. But no sooner was her husband's desire whispered\r\nin the ear of our last married lady, but the cards were clapped on the\r\ntable, and down she comes with, \"My dear, would you speak with me?\" He\r\nreceives her in his arms, and after repeated caresses, tells her the\r\nexperiment, confesses his good-nature, and assures her, that since she\r\ncould now command her temper, he would no longer disguise his own.\r\n\r\nI received the following letter, with a dozen of wine, and cannot but\r\ndo justice to the liquor, and give my testimony, that I have tried\r\nit upon several of my acquaintances, who were given to impertinent\r\nabbreviations,[123] with great success:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"I send you by this bearer, and not per bearer, a dozen of that\r\nclaret which is to be sold at Garraway's Coffee-house on Thursday the\r\nfifth of October next. I can assure you, I have found by experience\r\nthe efficacy of it in amending a fault you complain of in your last.\r\nThe very first draught of it has some effect upon the speech of the\r\ndrinker, and restores all the letters taken away by the elisions so\r\njustly complained of. Will Hazzard was cured of his hypochondria by\r\nthree glasses; and the gentleman who gave you an account of his late\r\nindisposition, has in public company, after the first quart, spoke\r\nevery syllable of the word plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\n\"Your, &c.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[122] This story is simply that of Katherine and Petruchio, in \"The\r\nTaming of the Shrew,\" retold.

Having not seen\r\nhim for some time, I was in fear I should soon hear of his death,\r\nespecially since he never appeared, though the noons have been of late\r\npretty warm, and the councils at that place very full from the hour of\r\ntwelve to three, which the sages of that board employ in conference,\r\nwhile the unthinking part of mankind are eating and drinking for the\r\nsupport of their own private persons, without any regard to the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I should have waited on you very frequently to have discoursed you\r\nupon some matters of moment, but that I love to be well informed in\r\nthe subject upon which I consult my friends before I enter into debate\r\nwith them. I have therefore with the utmost care and pains applied\r\nmyself to the reading all the writings and pamphlets which have come\r\nout since the trial,[125] and have studied night and day in order to be\r\nmaster of the whole controversy; but the authors are so numerous, and\r\nthe state of affairs alters so very fast, that I am now a fortnight\r\nbehindhand in my reading, and know only how things stood twelve days\r\nago. I wish you would enter into those useful subjects; for, if I may\r\nbe allowed to say so, these are not times to jest in. As for my own\r\npart, you know very well, that I am of a public spirit, and never\r\nregarded my own interest, but looked further; and let me tell you,\r\nthat while some people are minding only themselves and families, and\r\nothers are thinking only of their own country, things go on strangely\r\nin the North. I foresee very great evils arising from the neglect of\r\ntransactions at a distance; for which reason I am now writing a letter\r\nto a friend in the country, which I design as an answer to the Czar\r\nof Muscovy's letter to the Grand Signior concerning his Majesty of\r\nSweden. I have endeavoured to prove that it is not reasonable to expect\r\nthat his Swedish Majesty should leave Bender without forty thousand\r\nmen; and I have added to this an apology for the Cossacks. But the\r\nmatter multiplies upon me, and I grow dim with much writing; therefore\r\ndesire, if you have an old green pair of spectacles, such as you used\r\nabout your fiftieth year, that you send them to me; as also, that you\r\nwould please to desire Mr. Morphew to send me in a bushel of coals on\r\nthe credit of my answer to his Czarian Majesty; for I design it shall\r\nbe printed for Morphew, and the weather grows sharp. I shall take it\r\nkindly if you would order him also to send me the papers as they come\r\nout. If there are no fresh pamphlets published, I compute that I shall\r\nknow before the end of next month what has been done in town to this\r\nday. If it were not for an ill custom lately introduced by a certain\r\nauthor, of talking Latin at the beginning of papers, matters would\r\nbe in a much clearer light than they are; but to our comfort, there\r\nare solid writers who are not guilty of this pedantry. The _Post-Man_\r\nwrites like an angel: the _Moderator_[126] is fine reading! It would\r\ndo you no harm to read the _Post-Boy_ with attention; he is very deep\r\nof late. He is instructive; but I confess a little satirical: a sharp\r\npen! He cares not what he says. The _Examiner_ is admirable, and is\r\nbecome a grave and substantial author. But above all, I am at a loss\r\nhow to govern myself in my judgment of those whose whole writings\r\nconsist in interrogatories: and then the way of answering, by proposing\r\nquestions as hard to them, is quite as extraordinary. As for my part, I\r\ntremble at these novelties; we expose, in my opinion, our affairs too\r\nmuch by it. You may be sure the French King will spare no cost to come\r\nat the reading of them. I dread to think if the fable of the Blackbirds\r\nshould fall into his hands. But I shall not venture to say more till I\r\nsee you. In the meantime,\r\n\r\n\"I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\"_P.S._--I take the Bender letter in the _Examiner_ to be\r\nspurious.\"[127]\r\n\r\nThis unhappy correspondent, whose fantastical loyalty to the King of\r\nSweden has reduced him to this low condition of reason and fortune,\r\nwould appear much more monstrous in his madness, did we not see crowds\r\nvery little above his circumstances from the same cause, a passion to\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIt is no unpleasant entertainment to consider the commerce even of\r\nthe sexes interrupted by difference in State affairs. A wench and her\r\ngallant parted last week upon the words \"unlimited\" and \"passive\":\r\nand there is such a jargon of terms got into the mouths of the very\r\nsilliest of the women, that you cannot come into a room even among\r\nthem, but you find them divided into Whig and Tory. What heightens the\r\nhumour is, that all the hard words they know they certainly suppose\r\nto be terms useful in the disputes of the parties. I came in this day\r\nwhere two were in very hot debate, and one of them proposed to me\r\nto explain to them what was the difference between circumcision and\r\npredestination. You may be sure I was at a loss; but they were too\r\nangry at each other to wait for my explanation, but proceeded to lay\r\nopen the whole state of affairs, instead of the usual topics of dress,\r\ngallantry, and scandal.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered how it should be possible that this turn to\r\npolitics should so universally prevail, to the exclusion of every other\r\nsubject out of conversation; and upon mature consideration, find it is\r\nfor want of discourse. Look round you among all the young fellows you\r\nmeet, and you see those who have least relish for books, company, or\r\npleasure, though they have no manner of qualities to make them succeed\r\nin those pursuits, shall make very passable politicians. Thus the most\r\nbarren invention shall find enough to say to make one appear an able\r\nman in the top coffee-houses. It is but adding a certain vehemence in\r\nuttering yourself, let the thing you say be never so flat, and you\r\nshall be thought a very sensible man, if you were not too hot. As love\r\nand honour are the noblest motives of life; so the pretenders to them,\r\nwithout being animated by them, are the most contemptible of all sorts\r\nof pretenders. The unjust affectation of anything that is laudable, is\r\nignominious in proportion to the worth of the thing we affect: thus, as\r\nlove of one's country is the most glorious of all passions, to see the\r\nmost ordinary tools in a nation give themselves airs that way, without\r\nany one good quality in their own life, has something in it romantic,\r\nyet not so ridiculous as odious.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff has received Silvia's letter from the Bath, and his\r\nsister is set out thither.

When those whom we know to be excellent and deserving\r\nof a better fate are wretched, we cannot but resign ourselves, whom\r\nmost of us know to merit a much worse state than that we are placed\r\nin. For such and many other occasions, there is one admirable relation\r\nwhich one might recommend for certain periods of one's life, to touch,\r\ncomfort, and improve the heart of man. Tully says, somewhere, the\r\npleasures of a husbandman are next to those of a philosopher. In like\r\nmanner one may say (for methinks they bear the same proportion one to\r\nanother), the pleasures of humanity are next to those of devotion. In\r\nboth these latter satisfactions, there is a certain humiliation which\r\nexalts the soul above its ordinary state. At the same time that it\r\nlessens our value of ourselves, it enlarges our estimation of others.\r\nThe history I am going to speak of, is that of Joseph in Holy Writ,\r\nwhich is related with such majestic simplicity, that all the parts\r\nof it strike us with strong touches of nature and compassion, and he\r\nmust be a stranger to both who can read it with attention, and not be\r\noverwhelmed with the vicissitudes of joy and sorrow. I hope it will not\r\nbe a profanation to tell it one's own way here, that they who may be\r\nunthinking enough to be more frequently readers of such papers as this\r\nthan of Sacred Writ, may be advertised, that the greatest pleasures the\r\nimagination can be entertained with are to be found there, and that\r\neven the style of the Scriptures is more than human.\r\n\r\nJoseph, a beloved child of Israel, became invidious to his elder\r\nbrethren, for no other reason but his superior beauty and excellence of\r\nbody and mind, insomuch that they could not bear his growing virtue,\r\nand let him live. They therefore conspire his death; but nature pleaded\r\nso strongly for him in the heart of one of them, that by his persuasion\r\nthey determined rather to bury him in a pit, than be his immediate\r\nexecutioners with their own hands. When thus much was obtained for him,\r\ntheir minds still softened towards him, and they took the opportunity\r\nof some passengers to sell him into Egypt. Israel was persuaded by\r\nthe artifice of his sons, that the youth was torn to pieces by wild\r\nbeasts: but Joseph was sold to slavery, and still exposed to new\r\nmisfortunes, from the same cause as before, his beauty and his virtue.\r\nBy a false accusation he was committed to prison, but in process of\r\ntime delivered from it, in consideration of his wisdom and knowledge,\r\nand made the governor of Pharaoh's house. In this elevation of his\r\nfortune, his brothers were sent into Egypt to buy necessaries of life\r\nin a famine. As soon as they are brought into his presence, he beholds,\r\nbut he beholds with compassion, the men who had sold him to slavery\r\napproaching him with awe and reverence. While he was looking over his\r\nbrethren, he takes a resolution to indulge himself in the pleasure of\r\nstirring their and his own affections, by keeping himself concealed,\r\nand examining into the circumstances of their family. For this end,\r\nwith an air of severity, as a watchful minister to Pharaoh, he accuses\r\nthem as spies, who are come into Egypt with designs against the State.\r\nThis led them into the account which he wanted of them, the condition\r\nof their ancient father and little brother, whom they had left behind\r\nthem. When he had learned that his brother was living, he demands the\r\nbringing him to Egypt, as a proof of their veracity.\r\n\r\nBut it would be a vain and empty endeavour to attempt laying this\r\nexcellent representation of the passions of man in the same colours\r\nas they appear in the Sacred Writ in any other manner, or almost\r\nany other words, than those made use of in the page itself. I am\r\nobliged therefore to turn my designed narration rather into a comment\r\nupon the several parts of that beautiful and passionate scene. When\r\nJoseph expects to see Benjamin, how natural and how forcible is the\r\nreflection, \"This affliction is come upon us in that we saw the anguish\r\nof our brother's soul without pity!\" How moving must it be to Joseph to\r\nhear Reuben accuse the rest, that they would not hear what he pleaded\r\nin behalf of his innocence and distress! He turns from them and weeps,\r\nbut commands his passion so far as to give orders for binding one of\r\nthem in the presence of the rest, while he at leisure observed their\r\ndifferent sentiments and concern in their gesture and countenance. When\r\nBenjamin is demanded in bondage for stealing the cup, with what force\r\nand what resignation does Judah address his brother!\r\n\r\n\"In what words shall I speak to my lord; with what confidence can I say\r\nanything? Our guilt is but too apparent; we submit to our fate. We are\r\nmy lord's servants, both we and he also with whom the cup is found.\"\r\nWhen that is not accepted, how pathetically does he recapitulate the\r\nwhole story! And approaching nearer to Joseph, delivers himself as\r\nfollows; which, if we fix our thoughts upon the relation between the\r\npleader and the judge, it is impossible to read without tears:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, let me intrude so far upon you, even in the high condition\r\nin which you are, and the miserable one in which you see me and my\r\nbrethren, to inform you of the circumstances of us unhappy men that\r\nprostrate ourselves before you. When we were first examined by you,\r\nyou inquired (for what reason my lord inquired we know not), but you\r\ninquired whether we had not a father or a brother? We then acquainted\r\nyou, that we had a father, an old man, who had a child of his old age,\r\nand had buried another son whom he had by the same woman. You were\r\npleased to command us to bring the child he had remaining down to\r\nus: we did so, and he has forfeited his liberty. But my father said\r\nto us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons: one of them was torn\r\nin pieces: if mischief befall this also, it will bring my grey hairs\r\nwith sorrow to the grave. Accept, therefore, oh my lord! me for your\r\nbondman, and let the lad return with his brethren, that I may not see\r\nthe evil that shall come on my father.' Here Joseph's passion grew too\r\ngreat for further disguise, and he reveals himself with exclamations of\r\ntransport and tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"After their recovery from their first astonishment, his brethren were\r\nseized with fear for the injuries they had done him; but how generously\r\ndoes he keep them in countenance, and make an apology for them: 'Be not\r\nangry with yourselves for selling me hither; call it not so, but think\r\nProvidence sent me before you to preserve life.'\"\r\n\r\nIt would be endless to go through all the beauties of this sacred\r\nnarrative; but any who shall read it, at an hour when he is disengaged\r\nfrom all other regard or interests than what arise from it, will feel\r\nthe alternate passion of a father, a brother, and a son, so warm in\r\nhim, that they will incline him to exert himself (in such of those\r\ncharacters as happen to be his) much above the ordinary course of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 234.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Thursday, Oct. 5_, to _Saturday, Oct. 7, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Oct. 6._\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that certain of my contemporaries have made\r\nuse of an art I some time ago professed, of being often designedly\r\ndull;[128] and for that reason shall not exert myself when I see them\r\nlazy. He that has so much to struggle with as the man who pretends to\r\ncensure others, must keep up his fire for an onset, and may be allowed\r\nto carry his arms a little carelessly upon an ordinary march. This\r\npaper therefore shall be taken up by my correspondents, two of which\r\nhave sent me the two following plain, but sensible and honest letters,\r\nupon subjects no less important than those of education and devotion:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,[129]\r\n\r\n\"I am an old man, retired from all acquaintance with the town, but what\r\nI have from your papers (not the worst entertainment of my solitude);\r\nyet being still a well-wisher to my country and the commonwealth of\r\nlearning (_a qua, confiteor, nullam ætatis meæ partem abhorruisse_),\r\nand hoping the plain phrase in writing that was current in my younger\r\ndays would have lasted for my time, I was startled at the picture of\r\nmodern politeness transmitted by your ingenious correspondent, and\r\ngrieved to see our sterling English language fallen into the hands of\r\nclippers and coiners. That mutilated epistle, consisting of _hipps_,\r\n_reps_, and such-like enormous curtailings, was a mortifying spectacle,\r\nbut with the reserve of comfort to find this, and other abuses of our\r\nmother-tongue, so pathetically complained of, and to the proper person\r\nfor redressing them, the Censor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"He had before represented the deplorable ignorance that for several\r\nyears past has reigned amongst our English writers, the great\r\ndepravity of our taste, and continual corruption of our style: but,\r\nsir, before you give yourself the trouble of prescribing remedies\r\nfor these distempers (which you own will require the greatest care\r\nand application), give me leave (having long had my eye upon these\r\nmischiefs, and thoughts exercised about them) to mention what I humbly\r\nconceive to be the cause of them, and in your friend Horace's words,\r\n\"Quo fonte derivata clades In patriam populumque fluxit.\"[130]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I take our corrupt ways of writing to proceed from the mistakes and\r\nwrong measures in our common methods of education, which I always\r\nlooked upon as one of our national grievances, and a singularity that\r\nrenders us no less than our situation,\r\n\r\n            _----Penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos._[131]\r\n\r\nThis puts me upon consulting the most celebrated critics on that\r\nsubject, to compare our practice with their precepts, and find where it\r\nwas that we came short or went wide.\r\n\r\n\"But after all, I found our case required something more than these\r\ndoctors had directed, and the principal defect of our English\r\ndiscipline to lie in the initiatory part, which, although it needs the\r\ngreatest care and skill, is usually left to the conduct of those blind\r\nguides, viz., Chance and Ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"I shall trouble you with but a single instance, pursuant to what your\r\nsagacious friend has said, that he could furnish you with a catalogue\r\nof English books, that would cost you a hundred pounds at first hand,\r\nwherein you could not find ten lines together of common grammar; which\r\nis a necessary consequence of our mismanagement in that province.\r\n\r\n\"For can anything be more absurd than our way of proceeding in this\r\npart of literature? To push tender wits into the intricate mazes\r\nof grammar, and a Latin grammar? To learn an unknown art by an\r\nunknown tongue? To carry them a dark roundabout way to let them in\r\nat a back-door? Whereas by teaching them first the grammar of their\r\nmother-tongue (so easy to be learned), their advance to the grammars of\r\nLatin and Greek would be gradual and easy; but our precipitate way of\r\nhurrying them over such a gulf, before we have built them a bridge to\r\nit, is a shock to their weak understandings, which they seldom, or very\r\nlate, recover. In the meantime we wrong nature, and slander infants,\r\nwho want neither capacity nor will to learn, till we put them upon\r\nservice beyond their strength, and then indeed we baulk them.\r\n\r\n\"The liberal arts and sciences are all beautiful as the Graces, nor\r\nhas Grammar (the severe mother of all) so frightful a face of her\r\nown; it is the vizard put upon it that scares children. She is made\r\nto speak hard words that to them sound like conjuring. Let her talk\r\nintelligibly, and they will listen to her.\r\n\r\n\"In this, I think, as on other accounts, we show ourselves true\r\nBritons, always overlooking our natural advantages. It has been the\r\npractice of wisest nations to learn their own language by stated rules,\r\nto avoid the confusion that would follow from leaving it to vulgar use.\r\nOur English tongue, says a learned man, is the most determinate in its\r\nconstruction, and reducible to the fewest rules: whatever language has\r\nless grammar in it, is not intelligible; and whatever has more, all\r\nthat it has more is superfluous; for which reasons he would have it\r\nmade the foundation of learning Latin, and all other languages.\r\n\r\n\"To speak and write without absurdity the language of one's country,\r\nis commendable in persons of all stations, and to some indispensably\r\nnecessary; and to this purpose, I would recommend above all things the\r\nhaving a grammar of our mother-tongue first taught in our schools,\r\nwhich would facilitate our youths learning their Latin and Greek\r\ngrammars, with spare time for arithmetic, astronomy, cosmography,\r\nhistory, &c., that would make them pass the spring of their life\r\nwith profit and pleasure, that is now miserably spent in grammatical\r\nperplexities.\r\n\r\n\"But here, methinks, I see the reader smile, and ready to ask me (as\r\nthe lawyer did sexton Diego on his bequeathing rich legacies to the\r\npoor of the parish,[132] Where are these mighty sums to be raised?),\r\nWhere is there such a grammar to be had? I will not answer, as he did,\r\nEven where your Worship pleases. No, it is our good fortune to have\r\nsuch a grammar, with notes, now in the press, and to be published next\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n\"I hear it is a chargeable work, and wish the publisher to have\r\ncustomers of all that have need of such a book; yet fancy that he\r\ncannot be much a sufferer, if it is only bought by all that have more\r\nneed for it than they think they have.\r\n\r\n\"A certain author brought a poem to Mr. Cowley, for his perusal and\r\njudgment of the performance, which he demanded at the next visit with a\r\npoetaster's assurance; and Mr. Cowley, with his usual modesty, desired\r\nthat he would be pleased to look a little to the grammar of it. 'To\r\nthe grammar of it! What do you mean, sir? Would you send me to school\r\nagain?' 'Why, Mr. H----, would it do you any harm?'\r\n\r\n\"This put me on considering how this voyage of literature may be\r\nmade with more safety and profit, expedition and delight; and at\r\nlast, for completing so good a service, to request your directions\r\nin so deplorable a case; hoping that, as you have had compassion on\r\nour overgrown coxcombs in concerns of less consequence, you will\r\nexert your charity towards innocents, and vouchsafe to be guardian to\r\nthe children and youth of Great Britain in this important affair of\r\neducation, wherein mistakes and wrong measures have so often occasioned\r\ntheir aversion to books, that had otherwise proved the chief ornament\r\nand pleasure of their life. I am with sincerest respect,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n                             \"Your, &c.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                               _St. Cl[eme]nts, Oct. 5_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"I observe, as the season begins to grow cold, so does people's\r\ndevotion; insomuch that, instead of filling the churches, that united\r\nzeal might keep one warm there, one is left to freeze in almost bare\r\nwalls, by those who in hot weather are troublesome the contrary way.\r\nThis, sir, needs a regulation that none but you can give to it, by\r\ncausing those who absent themselves on account of weather only this\r\nwinter time, to pay the apothecary's bills occasioned by coughs,\r\ncatarrhs, and other distempers contracted by sitting in empty seats.\r\nTherefore to you I apply myself for redress, having gotten such a cold\r\non Sunday was sevennight, that has brought me almost to your worship's\r\nage from sixty within less than a fortnight.

The present\r\nletter, which is supposed to be by James Greenwood, closes with the\r\nstatement that an English grammar, with notes, would be published next\r\nterm. Soon afterwards there appeared, with the date 1711, \"A Grammar\r\nof the English Tongue, with Notes.... Printed for John Brightland,\"\r\n&c. This book was noticed in the _Works of the Learned_ for November\r\n1710. Facing the title is a page bearing the head of Cato the Censor,\r\nand the following lines: \"The Approbation of Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.:\r\n'The following treatise being submitted to my censure, that I may\r\npass it with integrity, I must declare, that as grammar in general is\r\non all hands allowed to be the foundation of all arts and sciences,\r\nso it appears to me that this Grammar of the English Tongue has done\r\nthat justice to our language which, till now, it never obtained. The\r\ntext will improve the most ignorant, and the notes will employ the\r\nmost learned. I therefore enjoin all my female correspondents to buy,\r\nread, and study this grammar, that their letters may be something\r\nless enigmatic; and on all my male correspondents likewise, who make\r\nno conscience of false spelling and false English, I lay the same\r\ninjunction, on pain of having their epistles exposed in their own\r\nproper dress in my Lucubrations.--Isaac Bickerstaff, Censor.'\" There is\r\na Dedication to the Queen, and a Preface in which \"the Authors\" explain\r\nhow they have come to undertake a much-needed work at the request of\r\nMr. Brightland.\r\n\r\nThis book was followed by a pamphlet of six pages, \"Reasons for an\r\nEnglish Education, by teaching the Youth of both Sexes the Arts of\r\nGrammar, Rhetoric, Poetry, and Logic, in their own Mother-Tongue,\r\n1711.\" On p. 5 the writer asks, \"Has our Censor complained without\r\ncause, and given a false alarm of danger to the language of our\r\ncountry? (Lucubrat., Sept. 28, 1710);\" and on the next page we are told\r\nthat I. B., encouraged by the success of his book, was industriously\r\ncorrecting it for a second edition. This appeared in 1712, with an\r\nincrease in the number of pages from 180 to 264. Other editions\r\nappeared in 1714 and 1720. The fifth is dated 1729, and is advertised\r\nin the _Craftsman_ for July 5, 1729, as \"recommended by Sir Richard\r\nSteele, for the use of the schools of Great Britain;\" but according to\r\nthe _Monthly Chronicle_, it really appeared on August 8, 1728, being\r\ncalled in the Index, \"Bickerstaffe's Grammar.\" The seventh and eighth\r\neditions were published in 1746 and 1759.\r\n\r\nIn Nos. 254 and 255 of the _Tatler_ there was advertised, as shortly\r\nto be published, \"An Essay towards a Practical English Grammar, by\r\nJames Greenwood.... Particular care has been taken to render this\r\nbook useful and agreeable to the Fair Sex.\" This book is dated 1711,\r\nand is noticed in the _Works of the Learned_ for July. The Preface\r\ngives \"part of a letter which I wrote about a twelvemonth ago to the\r\ningenious author of the _Tatler_ upon this head\" (_i.e._ knowledge of\r\ngrammar among the fair sex). Greenwood's remarks on female education\r\nwere not printed in the _Tatler_; but they may have formed part of\r\nthe letter in this number (234), if this letter is by Greenwood. The\r\nthird edition, enlarged, of Greenwood's \"Essay\" appeared on May 24,\r\n1729. Greenwood was sub-master at St. Paul's School, and afterwards\r\nkept a boarding-school at Woodford, in Essex. He published \"The London\r\nVocabulary, English and Latin,\" of which there was a third edition in\r\n1713, with curious illustrations. By 1817 this book had passed through\r\ntwenty six-editions in England, besides several in America. Greenwood\r\nalso published in 1713 \"The Virgin Muse,\" a collection of poetry for\r\n\"young gentlemen and ladies at school.\" Second and third editions\r\nappeared in 1722 and 1731.\r\n\r\nMichael Maittaire also issued, in 1712, \"An English Grammar; or,\r\nan Essay on the Art of Grammar, applied to and exemplified in the\r\nEnglish Tongue.\" In the same year a pamphlet appeared with the title,\r\n\"Bellum Grammatical, or the Grammatical Battle-Royal. In Reflections\r\non the three English Grammars published in about a year last past.\" It\r\nconsists chiefly of an attack on Greenwood's \"Essay,\" and praise of\r\nBrightland's \"Grammar,\" which \"merits what the Censor said of it.\" In\r\na postscript Maittaire's \"Grammar\" is described as the worst of all.\r\nBrightland and Greenwood deserve to be remembered for their efforts\r\nto spread abroad a knowledge of \"the genius and nature of the English\r\ntongue.\" (The facts in this note are taken from a paper by the present\r\nwriter in _Watford's Antiquarian_ for October 1885.)\r\n\r\n[130] Horace, 3 Od. iv. 19.\r\n\r\n[131] Virgil, \"Eclog.\" i. 67.\r\n\r\n[132]\r\n\r\n    \"_Bartolus_ (_a covetous lawyer_).

Sometimes vanity and self-love appear\r\nto have a share towards this effect; and in other instances I have\r\nbeen apt to attribute it to mere instinct: but however that is, we\r\nfrequently see the child that has been beholden to neither of these\r\nimpulses in their parents, in spite of being neglected, snubbed, and\r\nthwarted at home, acquire a behaviour which makes it as agreeable to\r\nall the rest of the world, as that of every one else of their family is\r\nto each other. I fell into this way of thinking from an intimacy which\r\nI have with a very good house in our neighbourhood, where there are\r\nthree daughters of a very different character and genius. The eldest\r\nhas a great deal of wit and cunning; the second has good sense, but\r\nno artifice; the third has much vivacity, but little understanding.\r\nThe first is a fine, but scornful woman; the second is not charming,\r\nbut very winning; the third no way commendable, but very desirable.\r\nThe father of these young creatures was ever a great pretender to wit,\r\nthe mother a woman of as much coquetry. This turn in the parents has\r\nbiassed their affections towards their children. The old man supposes\r\nthe eldest of his own genius, and the mother looks upon the youngest\r\nas herself renewed. By this means, all the lovers that approach the\r\nhouse are discarded by the father for not observing Mrs. Mary's wit\r\nand beauty, and by the mother for being blind to the mien and air of\r\nMrs. Biddy. Come never so many pretenders, they are not suspected to\r\nhave the least thoughts of Mrs. Betty, the middle daughter. Betty\r\ntherefore is mortified into a woman of a great deal of merit, and knows\r\nshe must depend on that only for her advancement. The middlemost is\r\nthus the favourite of all her acquaintance as well as mine, while the\r\nother two carry a certain insolence about them in all conversations,\r\nand expect the partiality which they meet with at home to attend them\r\nwherever they appear. So little do parents understand that they are of\r\nall people the least judges of their children's merit, that what they\r\nreckon such, is seldom anything else but a repetition of their own\r\nfaults and infirmities.\r\n\r\nThere is, methinks, some excuse for being particular when one of the\r\noffspring has any defect in nature. In this case, the child, if we may\r\nso speak, is so much the longer the child of its parents, and calls for\r\nthe continuance of their care and indulgence from the slowness of its\r\ncapacity, or the weakness of its body. But there is no enduring to see\r\nmen enamoured only at the sight of their own impertinences repeated,\r\nand to observe, as we may sometimes, that they have a secret dislike\r\nof their children for a degeneracy from their very crimes. Commend\r\nme to Lady Goodly; she is equal to all her own children, but prefers\r\nthem to those of all the world beside. My lady is a perfect hen in the\r\ncare of her brood; she fights and squabbles with all that appear where\r\nthey come, but is wholly unbiassed in dispensing her favours among\r\nthem. It is no small pains she is at to defame all the young women in\r\nher neighbourhood by visits, whispers, intimations, and hearsays; all\r\nwhich she ends with thanking Heaven, that no one living is so blessed\r\nwith such obedient and well-inclined children as herself. Perhaps, says\r\nshe, Betty cannot dance like Mrs. Frontinett, and it is no great matter\r\nwhether she does or not; but she comes into a room with a good grace;\r\nthough she says it that should not, she looks like a gentlewoman. Then\r\nif Mrs. Rebecca is not so talkative as the mighty wit Mrs. Clapper, yet\r\nshe is discreet, she knows better what she says when she does speak.\r\nIf her wit be slow, her tongue never runs before it. This kind parent\r\nlifts up her eyes and hands in congratulation of her own good fortune,\r\nand is maliciously thankful that none of her girls are like any of her\r\nneighbours: but this preference of her own to all others, is grounded\r\nupon an impulse of nature; while those who like one before another of\r\ntheir own, are so unpardonably unjust, that it could hardly be equalled\r\nin the children, though they preferred all the rest of the world to\r\nsuch parents. It is no unpleasant entertainment to see a ball at a\r\ndancing-school, and observe the joy of relations when the young ones,\r\nfor whom they are concerned, are in motion. You need not be told whom\r\nthe dancers belong to: at their first appearance the passion of their\r\nparents are in their faces, and there is always a nod of approbation\r\nstolen at a good step, or a graceful turn.\r\n\r\nI remember among all my acquaintance but one man whom I have thought\r\nto live with his children with equanimity and a good grace. He had\r\nthree sons and one daughter, whom he bred with all the care imaginable\r\nin a liberal and ingenuous way.[134] I have often heard him say, he\r\nhad the weakness to love one much better than the other, but that\r\nhe took as much pains to correct that as any other criminal passion\r\nthat could arise in his mind. His method was, to make it the only\r\npretension in his children to his favour to be kind to each other;\r\nand he would tell them, that he who was the best brother, he would\r\nreckon the best son. This turned their thoughts into an emulation for\r\nthe superiority in kind and tender affection towards each other. The\r\nboys behaved themselves very early with a manly friendship; and their\r\nsister, instead of the gross familiarities and impertinent freedoms in\r\nbehaviour, usual in other houses, was always treated by them with as\r\nmuch complaisance as any other young lady of their acquaintance. It was\r\nan unspeakable pleasure to visit or sit at meal in that family. I have\r\noften seen the old man's heart flow at his eyes with joy upon occasions\r\nwhich would appear indifferent to such as were strangers to the turn\r\nof his mind; but a very slight accident, wherein he saw his children's\r\ngood-will to one another, created in him the God-like pleasure of\r\nloving them, because they loved each other.[135] This great command of\r\nhimself, in hiding his first impulse to partiality, at last improved\r\nto a steady justice towards them; and that which at first was but an\r\nexpedient to correct his weakness, was afterwards the measure of his\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nThe truth of it is, those parents who are interested in the care of one\r\nchild more than that of another, no longer deserve the name of parents,\r\nbut are in effect as childish as their children, in having such\r\nunreasonable and ungovernable inclinations. A father of this sort has\r\ndegraded himself into one of his own offspring; for none but a child\r\nwould take part in the passions of children.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[133] Nichols thinks that Addison was probably the author of this\r\npaper, because of the allusion to Addison's family at the close. But\r\nSteele had visited Dr. Lancelot Addison's home when he was a boy at the\r\nCharterhouse. The paper is not printed in Addison's works.\r\n\r\n[134] Addison's father, Dr. Lancelot Addison, Dean of Lichfield, had\r\nthree sons: (1) Joseph; (2) Gulston, who died Governor of Fort-George\r\nin the East Indies; (3) Lancelot, who was entered in Queen's College,\r\nand afterwards became Master of Arts, and Fellow of Magdalen College in\r\nOxford; and a daughter, Dorothy, first married to Dr. Sartre, formerly\r\nminister of Montpellier, and afterwards Prebendary of Westminster; and,\r\nsecondly, to Daniel Combes, Esq. Swift wrote on October 25, 1710: \"I\r\ndined to-day with Addison and Steele, and a sister of Mr. Addison, who\r\nis married to one Mons. Sartre, a Frenchman, prebendary of Westminster,\r\nwho has a delicious house and garden; yet I thought it was a sort of\r\nmonastic life in those cloisters, and I liked Laracor better. Addison's\r\nsister is a sort of a wit, very like him. I am not fond of her.\"\r\n\r\nAddison had two other sisters, who died young. Of his brother Gulston\r\nwe read thus in the \"Wentworth Papers\" (pp. 75-76): \"Since I wrote\r\nthis, I am told a great piece of news, that Mr. Addison is really a\r\nvery great man with the juncto, and that he has got his elder brother,\r\nwho has been a factor abroad in those parts, to be Governor of Fort St.\r\nGeorge.... It seems Mr. Addison's friends can do what they please with\r\nthe chief of the East India Company, who, I think, have the liberty of\r\nnaming their Governor, and by management with them this place is got,\r\nwhich they say some years is worth £20,000\" (Peter Wentworth to Lord\r\nRaby, January 28, 1709).\r\n\r\n[135] In the Dedication to Congreve of Addison's \"Drummer\" (1722),\r\nSteele said, \"Mr. Dean Addison, father of this memorable man, left\r\nbehind him four children, each of whom, for excellent talents and\r\nsingular perfections, was as much above the ordinary world as their\r\nbrother Joseph was above them. Were things of this nature to be exposed\r\nto public view, I could show, under the Dean's own hand, in the warmest\r\nterms, his blessing on the friendship between his son and me; nor had\r\nhe a child who did not prefer me in the first place of kindness and\r\nesteem, as their father loved me like one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              =No. 236.=                     [STEELE.[136]\r\n\r\n         From _Tuesday, Oct. 10_, to _Thursday, Oct. 12, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine mentem\r\n    Tangit, et immemorem non sinit esse sui.\r\n\r\n                                              OVID, Ep. ex Pont. 1. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Oct. 11._\r\n\r\nI find in the registers of my family, that the branch of the\r\nBickerstaffs from which I am descended, came originally out of\r\nIreland.[137] This has given me a kind of natural affection for that\r\ncountry. It is therefore with pleasure that I see not only some of the\r\ngreatest warriors, but also of the greatest wits, to be natives of that\r\nkingdom. The gentleman who writes the following letter is one of these\r\nlast. The matter of fact contained in it is literally true, though the\r\ndiverting manner in which it is told may give it the colour of a fable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq., at his House in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n                                                               _Dublin_.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Finding by several passages of your _Tatlers_, that you are a person\r\ncurious in natural knowledge, I thought it would not be unacceptable\r\nto you to give you the following history of the migration of frogs\r\ninto this country. There is an ancient tradition among the wild\r\nphilosophers of the kingdom, that this whole island was once as much\r\ninfested by frogs, as that wherein Whittington made his fortune was by\r\nmice; insomuch that it is said, Macdonald the First could no more sleep\r\nby reason of these Dutch nightingales (as they are called at Paris),\r\nthan Pharaoh could when they croaked in his bed-chamber. It was in\r\nthe reign of this great monarch that St. Patrick arrived in Ireland,\r\nbeing as famous for destroying vermin as any rat-catcher of our times.\r\nIf we may believe the tradition, he killed more in one day than a\r\nflock of storks could have done in a twelvemonth. From that time for\r\nabout five hundred years, there was not a frog to be heard in Ireland,\r\nnotwithstanding the bogs still remained, which in former ages had been\r\nso plentifully stocked with those inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"When the arts began to flourish in the reign of King Charles the\r\nSecond, and that great monarch had placed himself at the head of the\r\nRoyal Society, to lead them forward into the discoveries of nature, it\r\nis said, that several proposals were laid before his Majesty for the\r\nimporting of frogs into Ireland. In order to it, a virtuoso of known\r\nabilities was unanimously elected by the Society, and entrusted with\r\nthe whole management of that affair. For this end he took along with\r\nhim a sound, able-bodied frog, of a strong, hale constitution, that had\r\ngiven proof of his vigour by several leaps which he made before that\r\nlearned body. They took ship, and sailed together till they came within\r\nsight of the Hill of Howth, before the frog discovered any symptoms\r\nof being indisposed by his voyage: but as the wind chopped about,\r\nand began to blow from the Irish coast, he grew sea-sick, or rather\r\nland-sick; for his learned companion ascribed it to the particles of\r\nthe soil with which the wind was impregnated. He was confirmed in his\r\nconjecture, when, upon the wind's turning about, his fellow-traveller\r\nsensibly recovered, and continued in good health till his arrival upon\r\nthe shore, where he suddenly relapsed, and expired upon a Ring's End\r\ncar[138] on his way to Dublin. The same experiment was repeated several\r\ntimes in that reign, but to no purpose. A frog was never known to take\r\nthree leaps upon Irish turf, before he stretched himself out and died.\r\n\r\n\"Whether it were that the philosophers on this side the water despaired\r\nof stocking the island with this useful animal, or whether in the\r\nfollowing reign it was not thought proper to undo the miracle of a\r\nPopish saint, I do not hear of any further progress made in this affair\r\ntill about two years after the battle of the Boyne.\r\n\r\n\"It was then that an ingenious physician,[139] to the honour as well as\r\nimprovement of his native country, performed what the English had been\r\nso long attempting in vain. This learned man, with the hazard of his\r\nlife, made a voyage to Liverpool, where he filled several barrels with\r\nthe choicest spawn of frogs that could be found in those parts. This\r\ncargo he brought over very carefully, and afterwards disposed of it in\r\nseveral warm beds that he thought most capable of bringing it to life.\r\nThe doctor was a very ingenious physician, and a very good Protestant;\r\nfor which reason, to show his zeal against Popery, he placed some of\r\nthe most promising spawn in the very fountain that is dedicated to the\r\nSaint, and known by the name of St. Patrick's Well, where these animals\r\nhad the impudence to make their first appearance. They have since that\r\ntime very much increased and multiplied in all the neighbourhood of\r\nthis city. We have here some curious inquirers into natural history who\r\nobserve their motions, with a design to compute in how many years they\r\nwill be able to hop from Dublin to Wexford; though, as I am informed,\r\nnot one of them has yet passed the mountains of Wicklow.\r\n\r\n\"I am further informed, that several graziers of the county of Cork\r\nhave entered into a project of planting a colony in those parts, at the\r\ninstance of the French Protestants: and I know not but the same design\r\nmay be on foot in other parts of the kingdom, if the wisdom of the\r\nBritish nation do not think fit to prohibit the further importation of\r\nEnglish frogs. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n            \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n                                                      \"T.

I have made observations in this matter\r\nso long, that when I meet with a young fellow that is a humble admirer\r\nof the sciences, but more dull than the rest of the company, I conclude\r\nhim to be a Fellow of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] The authorship of the letter which forms the principal part of\r\nthis number is unknown. Goldsmith was told that a Dean of Killaloe was\r\nthe author of a paper in the _Tatler_ or _Spectator_, but there is\r\nnothing to connect the Dean (Jerome Ryves) with this particular number.\r\n\r\n[137] This may apply either to Swift, from whom Steele borrowed the\r\nname of Bickerstaff, or to Steele himself.\r\n\r\n[138] \"Our one horse vehicles have always been peculiar to ourselves,\r\nand were in use long before anything of a similar kind was introduced\r\ninto England.

Milton chanced\r\nto be my author, whose admirable poem of \"Paradise Lost\" serves, at\r\nonce, to fill the mind with pleasing ideas, and with good thoughts,\r\nand was therefore the most proper book for my purpose. I was amusing\r\nmyself with that beautiful passage in which the poet represents Eve\r\nsleeping by Adam's side, with the devil sitting at her ear, and\r\ninspiring evil thoughts under the shape of a toad. Ithuriel, one of\r\nthe guardian angels of the place, walking his nightly rounds, saw the\r\ngreat enemy of mankind hid in this loathsome animal, which he touched\r\nwith his spear. This spear being of a celestial temper, had such a\r\nsecret virtue in it, that whatever it was applied to, immediately flung\r\noff all disguise, and appeared in its natural figure. I am afraid the\r\nreader will not pardon me if I content myself with explaining the\r\npassage in prose, without giving it in the author's own inimitable\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    _----On he led his radiant files,\r\n    Dazzling the morn: these to the bower direct,\r\n    In search of whom they sought. Him there they found,\r\n    Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve;\r\n    Essaying by his devilish art to reach\r\n    The organs of her fancy, and with them forge\r\n    Illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams;\r\n    Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint\r\n    The animal spirits (that from pure blood arise\r\n    Like gentle breaths from rivers pure), thence raise\r\n    At least distempered, discontented thoughts,\r\n    Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,\r\n    Blown up with high conceits, engendering pride.\r\n    Him thus intent, Ithuriel with his spear\r\n    Touched lightly; for no falsehood can endure\r\n    Touch of celestial temper, but returns\r\n    Of force to his own likeness. Up he starts,\r\n    Discovered and surprised. As when a spark\r\n    Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid\r\n    Fit for the tun, some magazine to store\r\n    Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,\r\n    With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;\r\n    So started up in his own shape the fiend._[142]\r\n\r\nI could not forbear thinking how happy a man would be in the possession\r\nof this spear; or what an advantage it would be to a Minister of State,\r\nwere he master of such a white staff. It would let him discover his\r\nfriends from his enemies, men of abilities from pretenders: it would\r\nhinder him from being imposed upon by appearances and professions, and\r\nmight be made use of as a kind of State test, which no artifice could\r\nelude.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts made very lively impressions on my imagination, which\r\nwere improved, instead of being defaced by sleep, and produced in me\r\nthe following dream: I was no sooner fallen asleep, but, methought, the\r\nangel Ithuriel appeared to me, and with a smile that still added to his\r\ncelestial beauty, made me a present of the spear which he held in his\r\nhand, and disappeared. To make trials of it, I went into a place of\r\npublic resort.\r\n\r\nThe first person that passed by me, was a lady that had a particular\r\nshyness in the cast of her eye, and a more than ordinary reservedness\r\nin all the parts of her behaviour. She seemed to look upon man as an\r\nobscene creature, with a certain scorn and fear of him. In the height\r\nof her airs I touched her gently with my wand, when, to my unspeakable\r\nsurprise, she fell upon her back, and kicked up her heels in such a\r\nmanner as made me blush in my sleep. As I was hasting away from this\r\nundisguised prude, I saw a lady in earnest discourse with another, and\r\noverheard her say with some vehemence, \"Never tell me of him, for I am\r\nresolved to die a virgin!\" I had a curiosity to try her; but as soon\r\nas I laid my wand upon her head, she immediately fell in labour. My\r\neyes were diverted from her by a man and his wife, who walked near me\r\nhand-in-hand after a very loving manner. I gave each of them a gentle\r\ntap, and the next instant saw the woman in breeches, and the man with\r\na fan in his hand. It would be tedious to describe the long series of\r\nmetamorphoses that I entertained myself with in my night's adventure,\r\nof Whigs disguised in Tories, and Tories in Whigs; men in red coats\r\nthat denounced terror in their countenances, trembling at the touch of\r\nmy spear; others in black with peace in their mouths, but swords in\r\ntheir hands. I could tell stories of noblemen changed into usurers,\r\nand magistrates into beadles; of free-thinkers into penitents, and\r\nreformers into whoremasters. I must not, however, omit the mention of\r\na grave citizen that passed by me with a huge clasped Bible under his\r\narm, and a band of most immoderate breadth; but upon a touch on the\r\nshoulder, he let drop his book, and fell a-picking my pocket.\r\n\r\nIn the general I observed, that those who appeared good, often\r\ndisappointed my expectation; but that, on the contrary, those who\r\nappeared very bad, still grew worse upon the experiment; as the toad\r\nin Milton, which one would have thought the most deformed part of the\r\ncreation, at Ithuriel's stroke, became more deformed, and started up\r\ninto a devil.\r\n\r\nAmong all the persons that I touched, there was but one who stood the\r\ntest of my wand; and after many repetitions of the stroke, stuck to his\r\nform, and remained steady and fixed in his first appearance. This was a\r\nyoung man who boasted of foul distempers, wild debauches, insults upon\r\nholy men, and affronts to religion.\r\n\r\nMy heart was extremely troubled at this vision: the contemplation of\r\nthe whole species, so entirely sunk in corruption, filled my mind with\r\na melancholy that is inexpressible, and my discoveries still added to\r\nmy affliction.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these sorrows which I had in my heart, methought there\r\npassed by me a couple of coaches with purple liveries. There sat in\r\neach of them a person with a very venerable aspect. At the appearance\r\nof them, the people who were gathered round me in great multitudes\r\ndivided into parties, as they were disposed to favour either of those\r\nreverend persons. The enemies of one of them begged me to touch him\r\nwith my wand, and assured me, I should see his lawn converted into a\r\ncloak. The opposite party told me with as much assurance, that if I\r\nlaid my wand upon the other, I should see his garments embroidered\r\nwith fleurs-de-lis, and his head covered with a cardinal's cap. I\r\nmade the experiment, and, to my great joy, saw them both, without any\r\nchange, distributing their blessings to the people, and praying for\r\nthose who had reviled them. Is it possible, thought I, that good men,\r\nwho are so few in number, should be divided among themselves, and give\r\nbetter quarter to the vicious that are in their party, than the most\r\nstrictly virtuous who are out of it? Are the ties of faction above\r\nthose of religion?--I was going on in my soliloquies, but some sudden\r\naccident awakened me, when I found my hand grasped, but my spear gone.\r\nThe reflection on so very odd a dream made me figure to myself, what\r\na strange face the world would bear, should all mankind appear in\r\ntheir proper shapes and characters, without hypocrisy and disguise? I\r\nam afraid the earth we live upon would appear to other intellectual\r\nbeings no better than a planet peopled with monsters. This should,\r\nmethinks, inspire us with an honest ambition of recommending ourselves\r\nto those invisible spies, and of being what we would appear. There\r\nwas one circumstance in my foregoing dream which I at first intended\r\nto conceal; but upon second thoughts, I cannot look upon myself as a\r\ncandid and impartial historian, if I do not acquaint my reader, that\r\nupon taking Ithuriel's spear into my hand, though I was before an old\r\ndecrepid fellow, I appeared a very handsome, jolly, black man. But I\r\nknow my enemies will say, this is praising my own beauty, for which\r\nreason I will speak no more of it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[141] Nichols thought this paper was written by Addison, or with his\r\nassistance. \"The _Tatler_ upon Milton's 'spear' is not mine, madam.\r\nWhat a puzzle there was between you and your judgment!

Virgil's Tempest is a masterpiece in this kind, and is\r\nindeed so naturally drawn, that one who has made a voyage can scarce\r\nread it without being sea-sick.\r\n\r\nLand showers are no less frequent among the poets than the former,\r\nbut I remember none of them which have not fallen in the country; for\r\nwhich reason they are generally filled with the lowings of oxen and the\r\nbleatings of sheep, and very often embellished with a rainbow.\r\n\r\nVirgil's Land Shower is likewise the best in its kind: it is indeed a\r\nshower of consequence, and contributes to the main design of the poem,\r\nby cutting off a tedious ceremonial, and bringing matters to a speedy\r\nconclusion between two potentates of different sexes.

I do not question but the\r\nreader remembers my cousin's description of the Morning as it breaks in\r\ntown, which is printed in the ninth _Tatler_, and is another exquisite\r\npiece of this local poetry:\r\n\r\n      Careful observers may foretell the hour\r\n    (By sure prognostics) when to dread a shower:\r\n    While rain depends, the pensive cat gives o'er\r\n    Her frolics, and pursues her tail no more.\r\n    Returning home at night, you'll find the sink\r\n    Strike your offended sense with double stink.\r\n    If you be wise, then go not far to dine,\r\n    You'll spend in coach-hire more than save in wine.\r\n    A coming shower your shooting corns presage,\r\n    Old aches throb,[144] your hollow tooth will rage.\r\n    Saunt'ring in coffee-house is Dulman seen;\r\n    He damns the climate, and complains of spleen.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile the south rising with dabbled wings,\r\n    A sable cloud athwart the welkin flings,\r\n    That swilled more liquor than it could contain,\r\n    And like a drunkard gives it up again.\r\n    Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope,\r\n    While the first drizzling shower is borne aslope.\r\n    Such is that sprinkling which some careless quean\r\n    Flirts on you from her mop, but not so clean.\r\n    You fly, invoke the gods; then turning, stop\r\n    To rail; she singing, still whirls on her mop.\r\n    Not yet the dust had shunned th'unequal strife,\r\n    But aided by the wind, fought still for life;\r\n    And wafted with its foe by violent gust,\r\n    'Twas doubtful which was rain and which was dust.\r\n    Ah! where must needy poet seek for aid,\r\n    When dust and rain at once his coat invade;\r\n    His only coat, where dust confused with rain\r\n    Roughen the nap, and leave a mingled stain.\r\n\r\n      Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down,\r\n    Threatening with deluge this devoted town.\r\n    To shops in crowds the daggled females fly,\r\n    Pretend to cheapen goods, but nothing buy.\r\n    The Templar spruce, while every spout's abroach,\r\n    Stays till 'tis fair, yet seems to call a coach.\r\n    The tucked-up sempstress walks with hasty strides,\r\n    While streams run down her oiled umbrella's sides.\r\n    Here various kinds by various fortunes led,\r\n    Commence acquaintance underneath a shed.\r\n    Triumphant Tories and desponding Whigs\r\n    Forget their feuds, and join to save their wigs.\r\n    Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits,\r\n    While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits;\r\n    And ever and anon with frightful din\r\n    The leather sounds, he trembles from within.\r\n    So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed,\r\n    Pregnant with Greeks, impatient to be freed.\r\n    (Those bully Greeks, who, as the moderns do,\r\n    Instead of paying chairmen, run them through.)\r\n    Laocoon struck the outside with his spear,\r\n    And each imprisoned hero quaked for fear.\r\n\r\n      Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow,\r\n    And bear their trophies with them as they go:\r\n    Filth of all hues and odours seem to tell\r\n    What street they sailed from, by their sight and smell.\r\n    They, as each torrent drives, with rapid force,\r\n    From Smithfield or St. Pulchre's shape their course,\r\n    And in huge confluent joined at Snow Hill ridge,\r\n    Fall from the Conduit, prone to Holborn Bridge.\r\n    Sweepings from butchers' stalls, dung, guts, and blood,\r\n    Drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud,\r\n    Dead cats and turnip-tops come tumbling down the flood.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[143] \"I am going to work at another _Tatler_\" (Swift's \"Journal,\"\r\nOct. 4, 1710). \"And now I am going in charity to send Steele another\r\n_Tatler_, who is very low of late\" (_Ib._, Oct. 7, 1710). \"I am now\r\nwriting my poetical description of a 'Shower in London,' and will\r\nsend it to the _Tatler_\" (_Ib._, Oct. 10, 1710). \"I have finished my\r\npoem on the 'Shower,' all but the beginning; and am going on with my\r\n_Tatler_\" (_Ib._, Oct. 12, 1710). \"This day came out the _Tatler_,\r\nmade up wholly of my 'Shower,' and a preface to it. They say it is the\r\nbest thing I ever wrote, and I think so too. I suppose the Bishop of\r\nClogher will show it you. Pray tell me how you like it\" (_Ib._, Oct.\r\n17, 1710). \"They both [Rowe and Prior] fell commending my 'Shower'\r\nbeyond anything that has been written of the kind; there never was such\r\na 'Shower' since Danae's,\" &c. \"You must tell me how it is liked among\r\nyou\" (_Ib._, Oct. 27, 1710). \"The Bishop of Clogher says, I bid him\r\nread the London 'Shaver,' and that you both swore it was 'Shaver,' and\r\nnot 'Shower.' You all lie, and you are puppies, and can't read Presto's\r\nhand\" (_Ib._, Nov. 28, 1710). \"My 'Shower' admired with you; why the\r\nBishop of Clogher says, he has seen something of mine of the same sort,\r\nbetter than the 'Shower.'

A judge would\r\nmake but an indifferent figure who had never been known at the bar.\r\nCicero was reputed the greatest orator of his age and country before\r\nhe wrote a book \"De Oratore\"; and Horace the greatest poet before he\r\npublished his \"Art of Poetry.\" This observation arises naturally in\r\nany one who casts his eye upon this last-mentioned author, where he\r\nwill find the criticisms placed in the latter end of his book, that is,\r\nafter the finest odes and satires in the Latin tongue.\r\n\r\nA modern, whose name I shall not mention,[145] because I would not make\r\na silly paper sell, was born a critic and an Examiner, and, like one\r\nof the race of the serpent's teeth, came into the world with a sword\r\nin his hand. His works put me in mind of the story that is told of a\r\nGerman monk, who was taking a catalogue of a friend's library, and\r\nmeeting with a Hebrew book in it, entered it under the title of \"A\r\nbook that has the beginning where the end should be.\" This author, in\r\nthe last of his crudities, has amassed together a heap of quotations,\r\nto prove that Horace and Virgil were both of them modester men than\r\nmyself, and if his works were to live as long as mine, they might\r\npossibly give posterity a notion, that Isaac Bickerstaff was a very\r\nconceited old fellow, and as vain a man as either Tully or Sir Francis\r\nBacon. Had this serious writer fallen upon me only, I could have\r\noverlooked it; but to see Cicero abused, is, I must confess, what I\r\ncannot bear. The censure he passes upon this great man runs thus: \"The\r\nitch of being very abusive, is almost inseparable from vainglory. Tully\r\nhas these two faults in so high a degree, that nothing but his being\r\nthe best writer in the world can make amends for them.\" The scurrilous\r\nwretch goes on to say I am as bad as Tully. His words are these: \"And\r\nyet the Tatler, in his paper of September 26, has outdone him in both.\r\nHe speaks of himself with more arrogance, and with more insolence of\r\nothers.\" I am afraid by his discourse, this gentleman has no more read\r\nPlutarch than he has Tully. If he had, he would have observed a passage\r\nin that historian, wherein he has with great delicacy distinguished\r\nbetween two passions which are usually complicated in human nature,\r\nand which an ordinary writer would not have thought of separating. Not\r\nhaving my Greek spectacles by me, I shall quote the passage word for\r\nword as I find it translated to my hand. \"Nevertheless, though he was\r\nintemperately fond of his own praise, yet he was very free from envying\r\nothers, and most liberally profuse in commending both the ancients and\r\nhis contemporaries, as is to be understood by his writings; and many\r\nof those sayings are still recorded, as that concerning Aristotle, that\r\nhe was a river of flowing gold: of Plato's 'Dialogue,' that if Jupiter\r\nwere to speak, he would discourse as he did. Theophrastus he was wont\r\nto call his peculiar delight; and being asked, which of Demosthenes his\r\norations he liked best? he answered, the longest.\r\n\r\n\"And as for the eminent men of his own time, either for eloquence or\r\nphilosophy, there was not one of them which he did not, by writing or\r\nspeaking favourably of, render more illustrious.\"\r\n\r\nThus the critic tells us, that Cicero was excessively vainglorious and\r\nabusive; Plutarch, that he was vain, but not abusive. Let the reader\r\nbelieve which of them he pleases.\r\n\r\nAfter this he complains to the world, that I call him names; and\r\nthat in my passion I said, he was \"a flea, a louse, an owl, a bat,\r\na small wit, a scribbler, and a nibbler.\" When he has thus bespoken\r\nhis reader's pity, he falls into that admirable vein of mirth, which\r\nI shall set down at length, it being an exquisite piece of raillery,\r\nand written in great gaiety of heart. \"After this list of names (viz.,\r\nflea, louse, owl, bat, &c.), I was surprised to hear him say, that he\r\nhas hitherto kept his temper pretty well; I wonder how he will write\r\nwhen he has lost his temper? I suppose, as he now is very angry and\r\nunmannerly, he will then be exceeding courteous and good-humoured.\" If\r\nI can outlive this raillery, I shall be able to bear anything.\r\n\r\nThere is a method of criticism made use of by this author (for I shall\r\ntake care how I call him a scribbler again), which may turn into\r\nridicule any work that was ever written, wherein there is a variety of\r\nthoughts: this the reader will observe in the following words: \"He\r\n(meaning me) is so intent upon being something extraordinary, that he\r\nscarce knows what he would be; and is as fruitful in his similes, as\r\na brother of his[146] whom I lately took notice of. In the compass of\r\na few lines he compares himself to a fox, to Daniel Burgess, to the\r\nKnight of the Red Cross, to an oak with ivy about it, and to a great\r\nman with an equipage.\" I think myself as much honoured by being joined\r\nin this part of his paper with the gentleman whom he here calls my\r\nbrother, as I am in the beginning of it, by being mentioned with Horace\r\nand Virgil.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard that a man cannot publish ten papers without stealing\r\nfrom himself; but to show you that this is only a knack of writing, and\r\nthat the author is got into a certain road of criticism, I shall set\r\ndown his remarks on the works of the gentleman whom he here glances\r\nupon, as they stand in his sixth paper, and desire the reader to\r\ncompare them with the foregoing passage upon mine:\r\n\r\n\"In thirty lines his patron is a river, the _primum mobile_, a pilot, a\r\nvictim, the sun, anything, and nothing. He bestows increase, conceals\r\nhis source, makes the machine move, teaches to steer, expiates our\r\noffences, raises vapours, and looks larger as he sets.\"\r\n\r\nWhat poem can be safe from this sort of criticism? I think I was\r\nnever in my life so much offended as at a wag whom I once met with in\r\na coffee-house: he had in his hand one of the Miscellanies, and was\r\nreading the following short copy of verses, which, without flattery to\r\nthe author,[147] is, I think, as beautiful in its kind as any one in\r\nthe English tongue:\r\n\r\n    _Flavia the least and slightest toy\r\n    Can with resistless art employ.\r\n    This fan in meaner hands would prove\r\n    An engine of small force in love;\r\n    But she with such an air and mien,\r\n    Not to be told, or safely seen,\r\n    Directs its wanton motions so,\r\n    That it wounds more than Cupid's bow;\r\n    Gives coolness to the matchless dame,\r\n    To every other breast a flame._\r\n\r\nWhen this coxcomb had done reading them, \"Heyday!\" says he, \"what\r\ninstrument is this that Flavia employs in such a manner as is not to be\r\ntold, nor safely seen? In ten lines it is a toy, a Cupid's bow, a fan,\r\nand an engine in love. It has wanton motions, it wounds, it cools, and\r\ninflames.\"\r\n\r\nSuch criticisms make a man of sense sick, and a fool merry.\r\n\r\nThe next paragraph of the paper we are talking of falls upon somebody\r\nwhom I am at a loss to guess at:[148] but I find the whole invective\r\nturns upon a man who (it seems) has been imprisoned for debt. Whoever\r\nhe was, I most heartily pity him; but at the same time must put the\r\nExaminer in mind, that notwithstanding he is a critic, he still ought\r\nto remember he is a Christian. Poverty was never thought a proper\r\nsubject for ridicule; and I do not remember that I ever met with a\r\nsatire upon a beggar.\r\n\r\nAs for those little retortings of my own expressions, of being dull by\r\ndesign, witty in October, shining, excelling, and so forth; they are\r\nthe common cavils of every witling, who has no other method of showing\r\nhis parts, but by little variations and repetitions of the man's words\r\nwhom he attacks.\r\n\r\nBut the truth of it is, the paper before me, not only in this\r\nparticular, but in its very essence, is like Ovid's echo:\r\n\r\n    ----Quæ nec reticere loquenti,\r\n    Nec prior ipsa loqui didicit.[149]\r\n\r\nI should not have deserved the character of a censor, had I not\r\nanimadverted upon the above-mentioned author by a gentle chastisement:\r\nbut I know my reader will not pardon me, unless I declare, that nothing\r\nof this nature for the future (unless it be written with some wit)\r\nshall divert me from my care of the public.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[145] The _Examiner_, the eleventh number of which consisted of jibes\r\nagainst No. 229 of the _Tatler_, by Addison.\r\n\r\n[146] Sir Samuel Garth, who has attacked in the sixth number of the\r\n_Examiner_.\r\n\r\n[147] Bishop Atterbury.

It will be remarked\r\nthat No. 229 was really by Addison, who here nobly defends his friend.\r\n\r\n[149] Ovid, \"Met.\" iii, 357.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 240.=                                       [ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Oct. 19_, to _Saturday, Oct. 21, 1710_.\r\n\r\n               Ad populum phaleras.--PERS., Sat. iii. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Oct. 20._\r\n\r\nI do not remember that in any of my Lucubrations I have touched upon\r\nthat useful science of physic, notwithstanding I have declared myself\r\nmore than once a professor of it. I have indeed joined the study of\r\nastrology with it, because I never knew a physician recommend himself\r\nto the public who had not a sister art to embellish his knowledge in\r\nmedicine. It has been commonly observed in compliment to the ingenious\r\nof our profession, that Apollo was god of verse as well as physic; and\r\nin all ages the most celebrated practitioners of our country were the\r\nparticular favourites of the Muses. Poetry to physic is indeed like the\r\ngilding to a pill; it makes the art shine, and covers the severity of\r\nthe doctor with the agreeableness of the companion.\r\n\r\nThe very foundation of poetry is good sense, if we may allow Horace to\r\nbe a judge of the art:\r\n\r\n        _Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons._[150]\r\n\r\nAnd if so, we have reason to believe that the same man who writes well\r\ncan prescribe well, if he has applied himself to the study of both.\r\nBesides, when we see a man making profession of two different sciences,\r\nit is natural for us to believe he is no pretender in that which we are\r\nnot judges of when we find him skilful in that which we understand.\r\n\r\nOrdinary quacks and charlatans are thoroughly sensible how necessary it\r\nis to support themselves by these collateral assistances, and therefore\r\nalways lay their claim to some supernumerary accomplishments which are\r\nwholly foreign to their profession.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago it was impossible to walk the streets without\r\nhaving an advertisement thrust into your hand of a doctor who was\r\narrived at the knowledge of the green and red dragon, and had\r\ndiscovered the female fern seed. Nobody ever knew what this meant; but\r\nthe green and red dragon so amused the people, that the doctor lived\r\nvery comfortably upon them. About the same time there was pasted a very\r\nhard word upon every corner of the streets. This, to the best of my\r\nremembrance, was\r\n\r\n                            TETRACHYMAGOGON,\r\n\r\nwhich drew great shoals of spectators about it, who read the bill that\r\nit introduced with unspeakable curiosity; and when they were sick,\r\nwould have nobody but this learned man for their physician.\r\n\r\nI once received an advertisement of one who had studied thirty\r\nyears by candle-light for the good of his countrymen. He might have\r\nstudied twice as long by daylight, and never have been taken notice\r\nof: but lucubrations cannot be overvalued. There are some who have\r\ngained themselves great reputation for physic by their birth, as the\r\nseventh son of a seventh son; and others by not being born at all, as\r\nthe Unborn Doctor,[151] who, I hear, is lately gone the way of his\r\npatients, having died worth five hundred pounds per annum, though he\r\nwas not born to a halfpenny.\r\n\r\nMy ingenious friend Dr. Saffold[152] succeeded my old contemporary\r\nDr. Lilly[153] in the studies both of physic and astrology, to which\r\nhe added that of poetry, as was to be seen both upon the sign where\r\nhe lived, and in the bills which he distributed. He was succeeded by\r\nDr. Case,[154] who erased the verses of his predecessor out of the\r\nsign-post, and substituted in their stead two of his own, which were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    _Within this place\r\n    Lives_ Doctor CASE.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have got more by this distich than Mr. Dryden did by all\r\nhis works. There would be no end of enumerating the several imaginary\r\nperfections and unaccountable artifices by which this tribe of men\r\nensnare the minds of the vulgar, and gain crowds of admirers. I have\r\nseen the whole front of a mountebank's stage from one end to the other\r\nfaced with patents, certificates, medals, and great seals, by which the\r\nseveral princes of Europe have testified their particular respect and\r\nesteem for the doctor. Every great man with a sounding title has been\r\nhis patient. I believe I have seen twenty mountebanks that have given\r\nphysic to the Czar of Muscovy. The great Duke of Tuscany escapes no\r\nbetter. The Elector of Brandenburg was likewise a very good patient.\r\n\r\nThis great condescension of the doctor draws upon him much good-will\r\nfrom his audience; and it is ten to one, but if any of them be troubled\r\nwith an aching tooth, his ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a\r\nperson who has had so many princes, kings, and emperors under his hands.\r\n\r\nI must not leave this subject without observing, that as physicians are\r\napt to deal in poetry, apothecaries endeavour to recommend themselves\r\nby oratory, and are therefore without controversy the most eloquent\r\npersons in the whole British nation. I would not willingly discourage\r\nany of the arts, especially that of which I am a humble professor; but\r\nI must confess, for the good of my native country, I could wish there\r\nmight be a suspension of physic for some years, that our kingdom, which\r\nhas been so much exhausted by the wars, might have leave to recruit\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, the only physic which has brought me safe to almost the\r\nage of man, and which I prescribe to all my friends, is abstinence.\r\nThis is certainly the best physic for prevention, and very often the\r\nmost effectual against a present distemper. In short, my recipe is,\r\nTake nothing.\r\n\r\nWere the body politic to be physicked like particular persons, I should\r\nventure to prescribe to it after the same manner. I remember when our\r\nwhole island was shaken with an earthquake some years ago, there was\r\nan impudent mountebank who sold pills which (as he told the country\r\npeople) were very good against an earthquake. It may perhaps be thought\r\nas absurd to prescribe a diet for the allaying popular commotions, and\r\nnational ferments. But I am verily persuaded, that if in such a case a\r\nwhole people were to enter into a course of abstinence, and eat nothing\r\nbut water-gruel for a fortnight, it would abate the rage and animosity\r\nof parties, and not a little contribute to the cure of a distracted\r\nnation. Such a fast would have a natural tendency to the procuring of\r\nthose ends for which a fast is usually proclaimed. If any man has a\r\nmind to enter on such a voluntary abstinence, it might not be improper\r\nto give him the caution of Pythagoras in particular:[155]\r\n\r\n                          _Abstine a fabis._\r\n                         \"Abstain from beans.\"\r\n\r\nThat is, say the interpreters, meddle not with elections, beans having\r\nbeen made use of by the voters among the Athenians in the choice of\r\nmagistrates.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150] Ars Poet. 309\r\n\r\n[151] Kirleus (see No. 14).\r\n\r\n[152] Saffold (see No. 20, note) is said to have been originally a\r\nweaver. Afterwards he told fortunes, and practised as a quack doctor.\r\nA satirical \"Elegy on the Death of Thomas Saffold, who departed this\r\nlife, May 12, 1691,\" was published after his death.\r\n\r\n[153] William Lilly, astrologer, died in 1681, aged seventy-nine.

It is very common\r\nthat events arise from a debauch which are fatal, and always such as\r\nare disagreeable. With all a man's reason and good sense about him,\r\nhis tongue is apt to utter things out of mere gaiety of heart which\r\nmay displease his best friends. Who then would trust himself to the\r\npower of wine, without saying more against it, than that it raises the\r\nimagination, and depresses the judgment. Were there only this single\r\nconsideration, that we are less masters of ourselves when we drink in\r\nthe least proportion above the exigencies of thirst; I say, were this\r\nall that could be objected, it were sufficient to make us abhor this\r\nvice. But we may go on to say, that as he who drinks but a little is\r\nnot master of himself, so he who drinks much is a slave to himself.\r\nAs for my part, I ever esteemed a drunkard of all vicious persons the\r\nmost vicious: for if our actions are to be weighed and considered\r\naccording to the intention of them, what can we think of him who puts\r\nhimself into a circumstance wherein he can have no intention at all,\r\nbut incapacitates himself for the duties and offices of life, by a\r\nsuspension of all his faculties. If a man considered, that he cannot\r\nunder the oppression of drink be a friend, a gentleman, a master, or a\r\nsubject; that he has so long banished himself from all that is dear,\r\nand given up all that is sacred to him, he would even then think of a\r\ndebauch with horror: but when he looks still further, and acknowledges,\r\nthat he is not only expelled out of all the relations of life, but also\r\nliable to offend against them all, what words can express the terror\r\nand detestation he would have of such a condition? And yet he owns all\r\nthis of himself who says he was drunk last night.\r\n\r\nAs I have all along persisted in it, that all the vicious in general\r\nare in a state of death, so I think I may add to the non-existence\r\nof drunkards, that they died by their own hands. He is certainly as\r\nguilty of suicide who perishes by a slow, as he that is despatched by\r\nan immediate poison. In my last Lucubration I proposed the general use\r\nof water-gruel, and hinted that it might not be amiss at this very\r\nseason: but as there are some whose cases, in regard to their families,\r\nwill not admit of delay, I have used my interest in several wards of\r\nthe city, that the wholesome restorative above mentioned may be given\r\nin tavern kitchens to all the morning's draught-men within the walls\r\nwhen they call for wine before noon. For a further restraint and mark\r\nupon such persons, I have given orders, that in all the offices where\r\npolicies are drawn upon lives, it shall be added to the article which\r\nprohibits that the nominee should cross the sea, the words, \"Provided\r\nalso, that the above-mentioned A. B. shall not drink before dinner\r\nduring the term mentioned in this indenture.\"\r\n\r\nI am not without hopes but by this method I shall bring some\r\nunsizable friends of mine into shape and breath, as well as others\r\nwho are languid and consumptive into health and vigour. Most of the\r\nself-murderers whom I yet hinted at, are such as preserve a certain\r\nregularity in taking their poison, and make it mix pretty well with\r\ntheir food: but the most conspicuous of those who destroy themselves,\r\nare such as in their youth fall into this sort of debauchery, and\r\ncontract a certain uneasiness of spirit, which is not to be diverted\r\nbut by tippling as often as they can fall into company in the day, and\r\nconclude with downright drunkenness at night. These gentlemen never\r\nknow the satisfaction of youth, but skip the years of manhood, and are\r\ndecrepid soon after they are of age. I was god-father to one of these\r\nold fellows. He is now three-and-thirty, which is the grand climacteric\r\nof a young drunkard. I went to visit the crazy wretch this morning,\r\nwith no other purpose but to rally him under the pain and uneasiness of\r\nbeing sober.\r\n\r\nBut as our faults are double when they affect others besides ourselves,\r\nso this vice is still more odious in a married than a single man. He\r\nthat is the husband of a woman of honour, and comes home overloaded\r\nwith wine, is still more contemptible in proportion to the regard\r\nwe have to the unhappy consort of his bestiality. The imagination\r\ncannot shape to itself anything more monstrous and unnatural than the\r\nfamiliarities between drunkenness and chastity. The wretched Astrea,\r\nwho is the perfection of beauty and innocence, has long been thus\r\ncondemned for life. The romantic tales of virgins devoted to the jaws\r\nof monsters, have nothing in them so terrible as the gift of Astrea to\r\nthat bacchanal.\r\n\r\nThe reflection of such a match as spotless innocence with abandoned\r\nlewdness, is what puts this vice in the worst figure it can bear with\r\nregard to others; but when it is looked upon with respect only to the\r\ndrunkard himself, it has deformities enough to make it disagreeable,\r\nwhich may be summed up in a word, by allowing, that he who resigns his\r\nreason, is actually guilty of all that he is liable to from the want of\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--Among many other enormities, there are two in the following\r\nletters which I think should be suddenly amended; but since they are\r\nsins of omission only, I shall not make remarks upon them till I find\r\nthe delinquents persist in their errors; and the inserting the letters\r\nthemselves shall be all their present admonition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                           _October 16_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"Several that frequent divine service at St. Paul's, as well as\r\nmyself, having with great satisfaction observed the good effect which\r\nyour animadversion had on an excess in performance there;[156] it is\r\nrequested, that you will take notice of a contrary fault, which is the\r\nunconcerned silence and the motionless postures of others who come\r\nthither.

Thus for example: he kept the best house of any\r\nman in England; he understood this, and that, and the other, the best\r\nof any man in England. How harsh and ungrateful soever this expression\r\nmight sound to one of my nation, yet the gentleman was one whom it\r\nno ways became me to interrupt; but perhaps a new term put into his\r\nby-words (as they call a sentence a man particularly affects) may cure\r\nhim. I therefore took a resolution to apply to you, who, I dare say,\r\ncan easily persuade this gentleman (whom I cannot believe an enemy to\r\nthe Union) to mend his phrase, and be hereafter the wisest of any man\r\nin Great Britain.

He has a great deal of wit, but satire is\r\nhis particular talent. Did you mind how he put the young fellow out of\r\ncountenance that pretended to talk to him?\" Such impertinent applauses,\r\nwhich one meets with every day, put me upon considering what true\r\nraillery and satire were in themselves; and this, methought, occurred\r\nto me from reflection upon the great and excellent persons that were\r\nadmired for talents this way. When I had run over several such in\r\nmy thoughts, I concluded (however unaccountable the assertion might\r\nappear at first sight) that good-nature was an essential quality in a\r\nsatirist, and that all the sentiments which are beautiful in this way\r\nof writing must proceed from that quality in the author. Good-nature\r\nproduces a disdain of all baseness, vice, and folly, which prompts\r\nthem to express themselves with smartness against the errors of men,\r\nwithout bitterness towards their persons. This quality keeps the mind\r\nin equanimity, and never lets an offence unseasonably throw a man\r\nout of his character. When Virgil said, he that did not hate Bavius\r\nmight love Mævius,[157] he was in perfect good-humour, and was not so\r\nmuch moved at their absurdities as passionately to call them sots or\r\nblockheads in a direct invective, but laughed at them with a delicacy\r\nof scorn, without any mixture of anger.\r\n\r\nThe best good man, with the worst-natured muse, was the character among\r\nus of a gentleman as famous for his humanity as his wit.[158]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary subjects for satire are such as incite the greatest\r\nindignation in the best tempers, and consequently men of such a make\r\nare the best qualified for speaking of the offences in human life.\r\nThese men can behold vice and folly when they injure persons to\r\nwhom they are wholly unacquainted, with the same severity as others\r\nresent the ills they do themselves. A good-natured man cannot see an\r\noverbearing fellow put a bashful man of merit out of countenance, or\r\noutstrip him in the pursuit of any advantage; but he is on fire to\r\nsuccour the oppressed, to produce the merit of the one, and confront\r\nthe impudence of the other.\r\n\r\nThe men of the greatest character in this kind were Horace and Juvenal.\r\nThere is not, that I remember, one ill-natured expression in all their\r\nwritings, not one sentence of severity which does not apparently\r\nproceed from the contrary disposition. Whoever reads them, will, I\r\nbelieve, be of this mind; and if they were read with this view, it\r\nmay possibly persuade our young fellows, that they may be very witty\r\nmen without speaking ill of any but those who deserve it: but in\r\nthe perusal of these writers it may not be unnecessary to consider,\r\nthat they lived in very different times. Horace was intimate with\r\na prince of the greatest goodness and humanity imaginable, and his\r\ncourt was formed after his example; therefore the faults that poet\r\nfalls upon were little inconsistencies in behaviour, false pretences\r\nto politeness, or impertinent affectations of what men were not fit\r\nfor. Vices of a coarser sort could not come under his consideration,\r\nor enter the palace of Augustus. Juvenal, on the other hand, lived\r\nunder Domitian, in whose reign everything that was great and noble was\r\nbanished the habitations of the men in power. Therefore he attacks vice\r\nas it passes by in triumph, not as it breaks into conversation. The\r\nfall of empire, contempt of glory, and a general degeneracy of manners,\r\nare before his eyes in all his writings. In the days of Augustus, to\r\nhave talked like Juvenal had been madness, or in those of Domitian\r\nlike Horace. Morality and virtue are everywhere recommended in Horace,\r\nas became a man in a polite court, from the beauty, the propriety,\r\nthe convenience, of pursuing them. Vice and corruption are attacked\r\nby Juvenal in a style which denotes, he fears he shall not be heard\r\nwithout he calls to them in their own language, with a bare-faced\r\nmention of the villanies and obscenities of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThis accidental talk of these two great men runs me from my design,\r\nwhich was to tell some coxcombs that run about this town with the name\r\nof smart satirical fellows, that they are by no means qualified for the\r\ncharacters they pretend to, of being severe upon other men, for they\r\nwant good-nature. There is no foundation in them for arriving at what\r\nthey aim at; and they may as well pretend to flatter, as rail agreeably\r\nwithout being good-natured.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain impartiality necessary to make what a man says\r\nbear any weight with those he speaks to. This quality, with respect\r\nto men's errors and vices, is never seen but in good-natured men.\r\nThey have ever such a frankness of mind, and benevolence to all men,\r\nthat they cannot receive impressions of unkindness without mature\r\ndeliberation; and writing or speaking ill of a man upon personal\r\nconsiderations, is so irreparable and mean an injury, that no one\r\npossessed of this quality is capable of doing it: but in all ages there\r\nhave been interpreters to authors when living, of the same genius with\r\nthe commentators, into whose hands they fall when dead. I dare say, it\r\nis impossible for any man of more wit than one of these to take any of\r\nthe four-and-twenty letters, and form out of them a name to describe\r\nthe character of a vicious man with greater life, but one of these\r\nwould immediately cry, Mr. Such-a-one is meant in that place. But the\r\ntruth of it is, satirists describe the age, and backbiters assign their\r\ndescriptions to private men.\r\n\r\nIn all terms of reproof, when the sentence appears to arise from\r\npersonal hatred or passion, it is not then made the cause of mankind,\r\nbut a misunderstanding between two persons. For this reason, the\r\nrepresentations of a good-natured man bear a pleasantry in them, which\r\nshows there is no malignity at heart, and by consequence are attended\r\nto by his hearers or readers because they are unprejudiced. This\r\ndeference is only what is due to him; for no man thoroughly nettled\r\ncan say a thing general enough to pass off with the air of an opinion\r\ndeclared, and not a passion gratified. I remember a humorous fellow at\r\nOxford, when he heard any one had spoken ill of him, used to say, \"I\r\nwon't take my revenge of him till I have forgiven him.\" What he meant\r\nby this, was, that he would not enter upon this subject till it was\r\ngrown as indifferent to him as any other; and I have, by this rule,\r\nseen him more than once triumph over his adversary with an inimitable\r\nspirit and humour; for he came to the assault against a man full of\r\nsore places, and he himself invulnerable.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of succeeding in a satirical way of writing or\r\nspeaking, except a man throws himself quite out of the question. It is\r\ngreat vanity to think any one will attend a thing because it is your\r\nquarrel. You must make your satire the concern of society in general,\r\nif you would have it regarded. When it is so, the good-nature of a\r\nman of wit will prompt him to many brisk and disdainful sentiments\r\nand replies, to which all the malice in the world will not be able to\r\nrepartee.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] Virgil, \"Eclog.\" iii. 90.\r\n\r\n[158] This was said of Lord Buckhurst, afterwards Earl of Dorset, by\r\nthe Earl of Rochester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 243.=                                       [ADDISON.\r\n\r\n        From _Thursday, Oct. 26_, to _Saturday, Oct. 28, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Infert se septus nebula, mirabile dictu,\r\n    Per medios, miscetque viris; neque cernitur ulli.\r\n\r\n                                                      VIRG., Æn. i. 439.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Oct. 27._\r\n\r\nI have somewhere made mention of Gyges's ring,[159] and intimated to\r\nmy reader, that it was at present in my possession, though I have not\r\nsince made any use of it. The tradition concerning this ring is very\r\nromantic, and taken notice of both by Plato and Tully, who each of\r\nthem make an admirable use of it for the advancement of morality. This\r\nGyges was the master shepherd to King Candaules. As he was wandering\r\nover the plains of Lydia, he saw a great chasm in the earth, and had\r\nthe curiosity to enter it. After having descended pretty far into\r\nit, he found the statue of a horse in brass, with doors in the sides\r\nof it. Upon opening of them, he found the body of a dead man bigger\r\nthan ordinary, with a ring upon his finger, which he took off, and\r\nput it upon his own. The virtues of it were much greater than he at\r\nfirst imagined; for upon his going into the assembly of shepherds, he\r\nobserved, that he was invisible when he turned the stone of the ring\r\nwithin the palm of his hand, and visible when he turned it towards\r\nhis company. Had Plato and Cicero been as well versed in the occult\r\nsciences as I am, they would have found a great deal of mystic learning\r\nin this tradition; but it is impossible for an adept to be understood\r\nby one who is not an adept.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I have with much study and application arrived at this\r\ngreat secret of making myself invisible, and by that means conveying\r\nmyself where I pleased; or to speak in Rosicrucian lore, I have entered\r\ninto the clefts of the earth, discovered the brazen horse, and robbed\r\nthe dead giant of his ring. The tradition says further of Gyges, that\r\nby the means of this ring he gained admission into the most retired\r\nparts of the court, and made such use of those opportunities, that he\r\nat length became King of Lydia. For my own part, I, who have always\r\nrather endeavoured to improve my mind than my fortune, have turned this\r\nring to no other advantage than to get a thorough insight into the ways\r\nof men, and to make such observations upon the errors of others as may\r\nbe useful to the public, whatever effect they may have upon myself.\r\n\r\nAbout a week ago, not being able to sleep, I got up and put on my\r\nmagical ring, and with a thought transported myself into a chamber\r\nwhere I saw a light. I found it inhabited by a celebrated beauty,\r\nthough she is of that species of women which we call a slattern. Her\r\nhead-dress and one of her shoes lay upon a chair, her petticoat in\r\none corner of the room, and her girdle, that had a copy of verses\r\nmade upon it but the day before, with her thread stockings, in the\r\nmiddle of the floor. I was so foolishly officious, that I could not\r\nforbear gathering up her clothes together to lay them upon the chair\r\nthat stood by her bedside, when, to my great surprise, after a little\r\nmuttering, she cried out, \"What do you do? Let my petticoat alone.\" I\r\nwas startled at first, but soon found that she was in a dream; being\r\none of those who, to use Shakespeare's expression, are \"so loose of\r\nthought,\"[160] that they utter in their sleep everything that passes\r\nin their imagination. I left the apartment of this female rake, and\r\nwent into her neighbour's, where there lay a male coquet. He had a\r\nbottle of salts hanging over his head, and upon the table, by his\r\nbedside, Suckling's Poems, with a little heap of black patches on it.\r\nHis snuff-box was within reach on a chair: but while I was admiring\r\nthe disposition which he made of the several parts of his dress, his\r\nslumber seemed interrupted by a pang, that was accompanied by a sudden\r\noath, as he turned himself over hastily in his bed. I did not care for\r\nseeing him in his nocturnal pains, and left the room.\r\n\r\nI was no sooner got into another bed-chamber, but I heard very harsh\r\nwords uttered in a smooth uniform tone. I was amazed to hear so great\r\na volubility in reproach, and thought it too coherent to be spoken by\r\none asleep; but upon looking nearer, I saw the headdress of the person\r\nwho spoke, which showed her to be a female with a man lying by her\r\nside broad awake, and as quiet as a lamb. I could not but admire his\r\nexemplary patience, and discovered by his whole behaviour, that he was\r\nthen lying under the discipline of a curtain lecture.\r\n\r\nI was entertained in many other places with this kind of nocturnal\r\neloquence, but observed, that most of those whom I found awake, were\r\nkept so either by envy or by love. Some of these were fighting, and\r\nothers cursing, in soliloquy; some hugged their pillows, and others\r\ngnashed their teeth.\r\n\r\nThe covetous I likewise found to be a very wakeful people. I happened\r\nto come into a room where one of them lay sick. His physician and his\r\nwife were in close whisper near his bedside. I overheard the doctor\r\nsay to the poor gentlewoman, \"He cannot possibly live till five in\r\nthe morning.\" She received it like the mistress of a family prepared\r\nfor all events. At the same instant came in a servant-maid, who said,\r\n\"Madam, the undertaker is below according to your order.\" The words\r\nwere scarce out of her mouth, when the sick man cried out with a feeble\r\nvoice, \"Pray, doctor, how went bank-stock to-day at 'Change?\" This\r\nmelancholy object made me too serious for diverting myself further this\r\nway: but as I was going home, I saw a light in a garret, and entering\r\ninto it, heard a voice crying, \"And, hand, stand, band, fanned,\r\ntanned.\" I concluded him by this, and the furniture of his room, to be\r\na lunatic; but upon listening a little longer, perceived it was a poet,\r\nwriting an heroic upon the ensuing peace.\r\n\r\nIt was now towards morning, an hour when spirits, witches, and\r\nconjurers are obliged to retire to their own apartments, and feeling\r\nthe influence of it, I was hastening home, when I saw a man had got\r\nhalf way into a neighbour's house. I immediately called to him, and\r\nturning my ring, appeared in my proper person. There is something\r\nmagisterial in the aspect of the Bickerstaffs, which made him run away\r\nin confusion.\r\n\r\nAs I took a turn or two in my own lodging, I was thinking, that, old\r\nas I was, I need not go to bed alone, but that it was in my power to\r\nmarry the finest lady in this kingdom, if I would wed her with this\r\nring. For what a figure would she that should have it make at a visit,\r\nwith so perfect a knowledge as this would give her of all the scandal\r\nin the town? But instead of endeavouring to dispose of myself and it in\r\nmatrimony, I resolved to lend it to my loving friend the author of the\r\n\"Atalantis,\"[161] to furnish a new Secret History of Secret Memoirs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[159] See No. 138.\r\n\r\n[160] Iago's words (\"Othello,\" act iii. sc. 3) are, \"There are a kind\r\nof men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;\r\none of this kind is Cassio.\"\r\n\r\n[161] Mrs. Manley (see Nos. 35 and 63). In the dedication prefixed\r\nto her play of \"Lucius\" (1717), Mrs. Manley made public apology for\r\nthe attacks upon Steele in her earlier writings: \"I have not known a\r\ngreater mortification than when I have reflected upon the severities\r\nwhich have flowed from a pen which is now, you see, disposed as much to\r\ncelebrate and commend you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 244.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Saturday, Oct. 28_, to _Tuesday, Oct. 31, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno,\r\n    Qui sapere et fari possit quæ sentiat?----\r\n\r\n                                                      HOR., I Ep. iv. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, Oct. 30._\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter when people are advancing in anything, to prevent\r\ntheir going too fast for want of patience. This happens in nothing\r\nmore frequently than in the prosecution of studies. Hence it is,\r\nthat we meet crowds who attempt to be eloquent before they can speak.\r\nThey affect the flowers of rhetoric before they understand the parts\r\nof speech. In the ordinary conversation of this town, there are so\r\nmany who can, as they call it, talk well, that there is not one in\r\ntwenty that talks to be understood. This proceeds from an ambition to\r\nexcel, or, as the term is, to shine, in company. The matter is not to\r\nmake themselves understood, but admired. They come together with a\r\ncertain emulation, rather than benevolence. When you fall among such\r\ncompanions, the safe way is to give yourself up, and let the orators\r\ndeclaim for your esteem, and trouble yourself no further. It is said\r\nthat a poet must be born so; but I think it may be much better said\r\nof an orator, especially when we talk of our town poets and orators;\r\nbut the town poets are full of rules and laws, the town orators go\r\nthrough thick and thin, and are, forsooth, persons of such eminent\r\nnatural parts and knowledge of the world, that they despise all men as\r\ninexperienced scholastics who wait for an occasion before they speak,\r\nor who speak no more than is necessary. They had half persuaded me to\r\ngo to the tavern the other night, but that a gentleman whispered me,\r\n\"Prithee, Isaac, go with us; there is Tom Varnish will be there, and he\r\nis a fellow that talks as well as any man in England.\"\r\n\r\nI must confess, when a man expresses himself well upon any occasion,\r\nand his falling into an account of any subject arises from a desire\r\nto oblige the company, or from fulness of the circumstance itself, so\r\nthat his speaking of it at large is occasioned only by the openness of\r\na companion; I say, in such a case as this, it is not only pardonable,\r\nbut agreeable, when a man takes the discourse to himself; but when\r\nyou see a fellow watch for opportunities for being copious, it is\r\nexcessively troublesome. A man that stammers, if he has understanding,\r\nis to be attended with patience and good-nature; but he that speaks\r\nmore than he need, has no right to such an indulgence. The man who\r\nhas a defect in his speech takes pains to come to you, while a man of\r\na weak capacity with fluency of speech triumphs in outrunning you.\r\nThe stammerer strives to be fit for your company; the loquacious man\r\nendeavours to show you, you are not fit for his.\r\n\r\nWith thoughts of this kind do I always enter into that man's company\r\nwho is recommended as a person that talks well; but if I were to choose\r\nthe people with whom I would spend my hours of conversation, they\r\nshould be certainly such as laboured no further than to make themselves\r\nreadily and clearly apprehended, and would have patience and curiosity\r\nto understand me. To have good sense, and ability to express it, are\r\nthe most essential and necessary qualities in companions. When thoughts\r\nrise in us fit to utter, among familiar friends there needs but very\r\nlittle care in clothing them.\r\n\r\nUrbanus is, I take it, a man one might live with whole years, and enjoy\r\nall the freedom and improvement imaginable, and yet be insensible of\r\na contradiction to you in all the mistakes you can be guilty of. His\r\ngreat good-will to his friends has produced in him such a general\r\ndeference in his discourse, that if he differs from you in his\r\nsense of anything, he introduces his own thoughts by some agreeable\r\ncircumlocution, or he has often observed such and such a circumstance\r\nthat made him of another opinion. Again, where another would be apt\r\nto say, \"This I am confident of; I may pretend to judge of this\r\nmatter as well as anybody;\" Urbanus says, \"I am verily persuaded;\r\nI believe one may conclude.\" In a word, there is no man more clear\r\nin his thoughts and expressions than he is, or speaks with greater\r\ndiffidence. You shall hardly find one man of any consideration, but\r\nyou shall observe one of less consequence form himself after him.\r\nThis happens to Urbanus; but the man who steals from him almost every\r\nsentiment he utters in a whole week, disguises the theft, by carrying\r\nit with quite a different air. Umbratilis knows Urbanus's doubtful way\r\nof speaking proceeds from good-nature and good-breeding, and not from\r\nuncertainty in his opinions. Umbratilis therefore has no more to do\r\nbut repeat the thoughts of Urbanus in a positive manner, and appear to\r\nthe undiscerning a wiser man than the person from whom he borrows: but\r\nthose who know him, can see the servant in his master's habit; and the\r\nmore he struts, the less do his clothes appear his own.\r\n\r\nIn conversation, the medium is neither to affect silence or eloquence;\r\nnot to value our approbation, and to endeavour to excel us who are of\r\nyour company, are equal injuries. The great enemies therefore to good\r\ncompany, and those who transgress most against the laws of equality\r\n(which is the life of it), are, the clown, the wit, and the pedant. A\r\nclown, when he has sense, is conscious of his want of education, and\r\nwith an awkward bluntness hopes to keep himself in countenance, by\r\noverthrowing the use of all polite behaviour. He takes advantage of the\r\nrestraint good-breeding lays upon others not to offend him to trespass\r\nagainst them, and is under the man's own shelter while he intrudes upon\r\nhim. The fellows of this class are very frequent in the repetition of\r\nthe words \"rough\" and \"manly.\" When these people happen to be by their\r\nfortunes of the rank of gentlemen, they defend their other absurdities\r\nby an impertinent courage; and to help out the defect of their\r\nbehaviour, add their being dangerous to their being disagreeable. This\r\ngentleman (though he displeases, professes to do so, and knowing that,\r\ndares still go on to do so) is not so painful a companion as he who\r\nwill please you against your will, and resolves to be a wit.\r\n\r\nThis man upon all occasions, and whoever he falls in company with,\r\ntalks in the same circle, and in the same round of chat which he has\r\nlearned at one of the tables of this coffee-house. As poetry is in\r\nitself an elevation above ordinary and common sentiments, so there is\r\nno fop is so very near a madman in indifferent company as a poetical\r\none. He is not apprehensive that the generality of the world are\r\nintent upon the business of their own fortune and profession, and have\r\nas little capacity as curiosity to enter into matters of ornament or\r\nspeculation. I remember at a full table in the city, one of these\r\nubiquitary wits was entertaining the company with a soliloquy (for so I\r\ncall it when a man talks to those who do not understand him) concerning\r\nwit and humour. An honest gentleman who sat next to me, and was worth\r\nhalf a plum, stared at him, and observing there was some sense, as he\r\nthought, mixed with his impertinence, whispered me, \"Take my word for\r\nit, this fellow is more knave than fool.\" This was all my good friend's\r\napplause of the wittiest man of talk that I was ever present at, which\r\nwanted nothing to make it excellent but that there was no occasion for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe pedant is so obvious to ridicule, that it would be to be one to\r\noffer to explain him. He is a gentleman so well known, that there is\r\nnone but those of his own class who do not laugh at and avoid him.\r\nPedantry proceeds from much reading and little understanding. A pedant\r\namong men of learning and sense, is like an ignorant servant giving\r\nan account of a polite conversation. You may find he has brought with\r\nhim more than could have entered into his head without being there, but\r\nstill that he is not a bit wiser than if he had not been there at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 245.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Tuesday, Oct. 31_, to _Thursday, Nov. 2, 1710_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 1._\r\n\r\nThe lady hereafter mentioned having come to me in very great haste,\r\nand paid me much above the usual fee as a cunning man to find\r\nher stolen goods, and also having approved my late discourse of\r\nadvertisements,[162] obliged me to draw up this, and insert it in the\r\nbody of my paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhereas Bridget Howd'ee,[163] late servant to the Lady Farthingale, a\r\nshort, thick, lively, hard-favoured wench, of about twenty-nine years\r\nof age, her eyes small and bleared, her nose very broad at bottom,\r\nand turning up at the end, her mouth wide, and lips of an unusual\r\nthickness, two teeth out before, the rest black and uneven, the tip\r\nof her left ear being of a mouse-colour, her voice loud and shrill,\r\nquick of speech, and something of a Welsh accent; withdrew herself\r\non Wednesday last from her ladyship's dwelling-house, and, with the\r\nhelp of her consorts, carried off the following goods of her said\r\nlady--viz., a thick wadded calico wrapper, a musk-coloured velvet\r\nmantle lined with squirrel-skins, eight night-shifts, four pair of\r\nsilk stockings curiously darned, six pair of laced shoes, new and old,\r\nwith the heels of half two inches higher than their fellows; a quilted\r\npetticoat of the largest size, and one of canvas with whalebone hoops;\r\nthree pair of stays, bolstered below the left shoulder; two pair of\r\nhips of the newest fashion, six roundabout aprons with pockets, and\r\nfour striped muslin night-rails very little frayed; a silver pot for\r\ncoffee or chocolate, the lid much bruised; a broad-brimmed flat silver\r\nplate for sugar with Rhenish wine, a silver ladle for plum-porridge;\r\na silver cheese-toaster with three tongues, an ebony handle, and\r\nsilvering at the end; a silver posnet[164] to butter eggs; one caudle\r\nand two cordial-water cups, two cocoa cups, and an ostrich's egg,\r\nwith rims and feet of silver; a marrow spoon, with a scoop at the\r\nother end; a silver orange-strainer, eight sweetmeat spoons made with\r\nforks at the end, an agate-handle knife and fork in a sheath, a silver\r\ntongue-scraper, a silver tobacco-box, with a tulip graved on the top;\r\nand a Bible bound in shagreen, with gilt leaves and clasps, never\r\nopened but once.

This in\r\na great measure proceeds from self-conceit, which were to be endured\r\nin one or other individual person; but the folly has spread itself\r\nalmost over all the species; and one cannot only say, Tom, Jack, or\r\nWill, but in general, that man is a coxcomb. From this source it is\r\nthat any excellence is faintly received, any imperfection unmercifully\r\nexposed. But if things were put in a true light, and we would take\r\ntime to consider that man in his very nature is an imperfect being,\r\nour sense of this matter would be immediately altered, and the\r\nword \"imperfection\" would not carry an unkinder idea than the word\r\n\"humanity.\" It is a pleasant story, that we, forsooth, who are the only\r\nimperfect creatures in the universe, are the only beings that will not\r\nallow of imperfection. Somebody has taken notice, that we stand in the\r\nmiddle of existences, and are by this one circumstance the most unhappy\r\nof all others. The brutes are guided by instinct, and know no sorrow;\r\nthe angels have knowledge, and they are happy; but men are governed by\r\nopinion, which is I know not what mixture of instinct and knowledge,\r\nand are neither indolent nor happy. It is very observable, that\r\ncritics are a people between the learned and the ignorant, and by that\r\nsituation enjoy the tranquillity of neither. As critics stand among\r\nmen, so do men in general between brutes and angels. Thus every man as\r\nhe is a critic and a coxcomb, till improved by reason and speculation,\r\nis ever forgetting himself, and laying open the faults of others.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that I am talking of the cruelty of urging people's\r\nfaults with severity, I cannot but bewail some which men are guilty\r\nof for want of admonition. These are such as they can easily mend,\r\nand nobody tells them of; for which reason I shall make use of the\r\npenny-post (as I have with success to several young ladies about\r\nturning their eyes, and holding up their heads) to certain gentlemen\r\nwhom I remark habitually guilty of what they may reform in a moment.\r\nThere is a fat fellow whom I have long remarked wearing his breast\r\nopen in the midst of winter, out of an affectation of youth. I have\r\ntherefore sent him just now the following letter in my physical\r\ncapacity:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"From the twentieth instant to the first of May next, both days\r\ninclusive, I beg of you to button your waistcoat from your collar to\r\nyour waistband. I am,\r\n\r\n   \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n  \"ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, _Philomath_.\"[175]\r\n\r\nThere is a very handsome well-shaped youth that frequents the\r\ncoffee-houses about Charing Cross, and ties a very pretty ribbon with\r\na cross of jewels at his breast.[176] This being something new, and a\r\nthing in which the gentleman may offend the Heralds' Office, I have\r\naddressed myself to him as I am censor:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"DEAR COUNTRYMAN,\r\n\r\n\"Was that ensign of honour which you wear, given you by a prince or a\r\nlady that you have served? If you bear it as an absent lover, please to\r\nhang it on a black ribbon; if as a rewarded soldier, you may have my\r\nlicence to continue the red.\r\n\r\n  \"Your faithful Servant,\r\n           \"BICKERSTAFF, _Censor_.\"\r\n\r\nThese little intimations do great service, and are very useful, not\r\nonly to the persons themselves, but to inform others how to conduct\r\nthemselves towards them.\r\n\r\nInstead of this honest private method, or a friendly one face to face,\r\nof acquainting people with things in their power to explain or amend,\r\nthe usual way among people is to take no notice of things you can help,\r\nand nevertheless expose you for those you cannot.\r\n\r\nPlumbeus and Levis are constantly in each other's company: they would,\r\nif they took proper methods, be very agreeable companions; but they so\r\nextravagantly aim at what they are unfit for, and each of them rallies\r\nthe other so much in the wrong place, that instead of doing each other\r\nthe offices of friends, they do but instruct the rest of the world to\r\nlaugh at them with more knowledge and skill. Plumbeus is of a saturnine\r\nand sullen complexion; Levis, of a mercurial and airy disposition.\r\nBoth these gentlemen have but very slow parts, but would make a very\r\ngood figure, did they pursue what they ought. If Plumbeus would take\r\nto business, he would in a few years know the forms of orders so well,\r\nas to direct and dictate with so much ease, as to be thought a solid,\r\nable, and at the same time a sure man of despatch. Levis, with a little\r\nreading and coming more into company, would soon be able to write a\r\nsong, or lead up a country-dance. Instead of these proper pursuits, in\r\nobedience to their respective geniuses, Plumbeus endeavours to be the\r\nman of pleasure, and Levis the man of business. This appears in their\r\nspeech, and in their dress: Plumbeus is ever egregiously fine, and\r\ntalking something like wit; Levis is ever extremely grave, and with a\r\nsilly face repeating maxims. These two pardon each other for affecting\r\nwhat each is incapable of, the one to be wise, and the other gay; but\r\nare extremely critical in their judgments of each other in their way\r\ntowards what they pretend to. Plumbeus acknowledges Levis a man of a\r\ngreat reach, because it is what Plumbeus never cared for being thought\r\nhimself; and Levis allows Plumbeus to be an agreeable rake for the same\r\nreason. Now were these dear friends to be free with each other as they\r\nought to be, they would change characters, and be both as commendable,\r\ninstead of being as ridiculous, as their capacities will admit of.\r\n\r\nWere it not too grave, all that I would urge on this subject is,\r\nthat men are bewildered when they consider themselves in any other\r\nview than that of strangers, who are in a place where it is no great\r\nmatter whether they can, or unreasonable to expect they should, have\r\neverything about them as well as at their own home. This way of\r\nthinking is, perhaps, the only one that can put this being into a\r\nproper posture for the ease of society. It is certain, this would\r\nreduce all faults into those which proceed from malice or dishonesty:\r\nit would quite change our manner of beholding one another, and nothing\r\nthat was not below a man's nature would be below his character. The\r\narts of this life would be proper advances towards the next; and a\r\nvery good man would be a very fine gentleman. As it now is, human life\r\nis inverted, and we have not learned half the knowledge of this world\r\nbefore we are dropping into another. Thus, instead of the raptures\r\nand contemplations which naturally attend a well-spent life from the\r\napproach of eternity, even we old fellows are afraid of the ridicule of\r\nthose who are born since us, and ashamed not to understand, as well as\r\npeevish to resign, the mode, the fashion, the ladies, the fiddles, the\r\nballs, and what not. Dick Reptile, who does not want humour, is very\r\npleasant at our club when he sees an old fellow touchy at being laughed\r\nat for anything that is not in the mode, and bawls in his ear, \"Prithee\r\ndon't mind him; tell him thou art mortal.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[175] See No. 95.\r\n\r\n[176] Possibly Colonel Ambrose Edgworth, a great dandy, whom Swift\r\ncalls \"that prince of puppies\" (\"Journal to Stella,\" Oct. 17, 1710).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      =No. 247.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n                     By JENNY DISTAFF, HALF-SISTER\r\n                          TO MR.

His sense of the matter he desired\r\nme to communicate to you. O Almeira! the common failing of our sex\r\nis to value the merit of our lovers rather from the grace of their\r\naddress than the sincerity of their hearts. 'He has expressed himself\r\nso handsomely!' Can you say that after you have reason to doubt his\r\ntruth? It is a very melancholy thing, that in this circumstance of love\r\n(which is the most important of all others in female life) we women,\r\nwho are, they say, always weak, are still weakest. The true way of\r\nvaluing a man, is to consider his reputation among the men: for want of\r\nthis necessary rule towards our conduct, when it is too late we find\r\nourselves married to the outcasts of that sex; and it is generally from\r\nbeing disagreeable among men, that fellows endeavour to make themselves\r\npleasing to us. The little accomplishments of coming into a room with\r\na good air, and telling while they are with us what we cannot hear\r\namong ourselves, usually make up the whole of a woman's man's merit.\r\nBut if we, when we began to reflect upon our lovers, in the first place\r\nconsidered what figures they make in the camp, at the bar, on the\r\n'Change, in their country, or at court, we should behold them in quite\r\nanother view than at present.\r\n\r\n\"Were we to behave ourselves according to this rule, we should not\r\nhave the just imputation of favouring the silliest of mortals, to the\r\ngreat scandal of the wisest, who value our favour as it advances their\r\npleasure, not their reputation. In a word, madam, if you would judge\r\naright in love, you must look upon it as in a case of friendship. Were\r\nthis gentleman treating with you for anything but yourself, when you\r\nhad consented to his offer, if he fell off, you would call him a cheat\r\nand an impostor. There is therefore nothing left for you to do, but to\r\ndespise him and yourself for doing with regret.\r\n\r\n  \"I am,\r\n                             \"Madam, &c.\"\r\n\r\nI have heard it often argued in conversation, that this evil practice\r\nis owing to the perverted taste of the wits in the last generation. A\r\nlibertine on the throne could very easily make the language and the\r\nfashion turn his own way. Hence it is, that woman is treated as a\r\nmistress, and not a wife. It is from the writings of those times, and\r\nthe traditional accounts of the debauches of their men of pleasure,\r\nthat the coxcombs nowadays take upon them, forsooth, to be false swains\r\nand perjured lovers. Methinks I feel all the woman rise in me, when I\r\nreflect upon the nauseous rogues that pretend to deceive us. Wretches,\r\nthat can never have it in their power to overreach anything living\r\nbut their mistresses! In the name of goodness, if we are designed by\r\nnature as suitable companions to the other sex, why are we not treated\r\naccordingly? If we have merit, as some allow, why is it not as base\r\nin men to injure us as one another? If we are the insignificants\r\nthat others call us, where is the triumph in deceiving us? But when\r\nI look at the bottom of this disaster, and recollect the many of my\r\nacquaintance whom I have known in the same condition with the Northern\r\nlass that occasions this discourse, I must own I have ever found the\r\nperfidiousness of men has been generally owing to ourselves, and we\r\nhave contributed to our own deceit. The truth is, we do not conduct\r\nourselves as we are courted, but as we are inclined. When we let\r\nour imaginations take this unbridled swing, it is not he that acts\r\nbest is most lovely, but he that is most lovely acts best. When our\r\nhumble servants make their addresses, we do not keep ourselves enough\r\ndisengaged to be judges of their merit; and we seldom give our judgment\r\nof our lover, till we have lost our judgment for him.\r\n\r\nWhile Clarinda was passionately attended and addressed to by Strephon,\r\nwho is a man of sense and knowledge in the world, and Cassio, who has\r\na plentiful fortune and an excellent understanding, she fell in love\r\nwith Damon at a ball: from that moment she that was before the most\r\nreasonable creature of all my acquaintance, cannot hear Strephon speak,\r\nbut it is something \"so out of the way of ladies' conversation;\" and\r\nCassio has never since opened his mouth before us, but she whispers me,\r\n\"How seldom do riches and sense go together!\" The issue of all this is,\r\nthat for the love of Damon, who has neither experience, understanding,\r\nor wealth, she despises those advantages in the other two which she\r\nfinds wanting in her lover; or else thinks he has them for no reason\r\nbut because he is her lover. This and many other instances may be given\r\nin this town; but I hope thus much may suffice to prevent the growth of\r\nsuch evils at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      =No. 248.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n                      By ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n\r\n         From _Tuesday, Nov. 7_, to _Thursday, Nov. 9, 1710_.\r\n\r\n            ----Media sese tulit obvia silva,\r\n    Virginis os habitumque gerens----\r\n\r\n                                                      VIRG., Æn. i. 314.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 8._\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps appear ridiculous; but I must confess, this last\r\nsummer as I was riding in Enfield Chase, I met a young lady whom\r\nI could hardly get out of my head, and for aught I know my heart,\r\never since.[177] She was mounted on a pad, with a very well-fancied\r\nfurniture. She sat her horse with a very graceful air; and when I\r\nsaluted her with my hat, she bowed to me so obligingly, that whether\r\nit was her civility or beauty that touched me so much, I know not, but\r\nI am sure I shall never forget her. She dwells in my imagination in a\r\nfigure so much to her advantage, that if I were to draw a picture of\r\nyouth, health, beauty, or modesty, I should represent any or all of\r\nthem in the person of that young woman.\r\n\r\nI do not find that there are any descriptions in the ancient poets\r\nso beautiful as those they draw of nymphs in their pastoral dresses\r\nand exercises. Virgil gives Venus the habit of a Spartan huntress\r\nwhen she is to put Æneas in his way, and relieve his cares with the\r\nmost agreeable object imaginable.[178] Diana and her train are always\r\ndescribed as inhabitants of the woods, and followers of the chase. To\r\nbe well diverted, is the safest guard to innocence; and, methinks,\r\nit should be one of the first things to be regarded among people of\r\ncondition to find out proper amusements for young ladies. I cannot but\r\nthink this of riding might easily be revived among them, when they\r\nconsider how much it must contribute to their beauty. This would lay up\r\nthe best portion they could bring into a family, a good stock of health\r\nto transmit to their posterity. Such a charming bloom as this gives the\r\ncountenance, is very much preferable to the real or affected feebleness\r\nor softness which appear in the faces of our modern beauties.\r\n\r\nThe comedy called \"The Ladies' Cure,\"[179] represents the affectation\r\nof wan looks and languid glances to a very entertaining extravagance.\r\nThere is, as the lady in the play complains, something so robust in\r\nperfect health, that it is with her a point of breeding and delicacy to\r\nappear in public with a sickly air. But the natural gaiety and spirit\r\nwhich shine in the complexion of such as form to themselves a sort of\r\ndiverting industry by choosing recreations that are exercises, surpass\r\nall the false ornaments and graces that can be put on by applying the\r\nwhole dispensary of a toilet. A healthy body and a cheerful mind give\r\ncharms as irresistible as inimitable. The beauteous Dyctinna, who came\r\nto town last week, has, from the constant prospect in a delicious\r\ncountry, and the moderate exercise and journeys in the visits she\r\nmade round it, contracted a certain life in her countenance which will\r\nin vain employ both the painters and poets to represent. The becoming\r\nnegligence in her dress, the severe sweetness of her looks, and a\r\ncertain innocent boldness in all her behaviour, are the effect of the\r\nactive recreations I am talking of.\r\n\r\nBut instead of such or any other as innocent and pleasing method of\r\npassing away their time with alacrity, we have many in town who spend\r\ntheir hours in an indolent state of body and mind, without either\r\nrecreations or reflections. I am apt to believe, there are some parents\r\nimagine their daughters will be accomplished enough, if nothing\r\ninterrupts their growth or their shape. According to this method of\r\neducation, I could name you twenty families, where all the girls hear\r\nof in this life is, that it is time to rise and to come to dinner; as\r\nif they were so insignificant as to be wholly provided for when they\r\nare fed and clothed.\r\n\r\nIt is with great indignation that I see such crowds of the female world\r\nlost to human society, and condemned to a laziness which makes life\r\npass away with less relish than in the hardest labour. Palestris, in\r\nher drawing-room, is supported by spirits to keep off the returns of\r\nspleen and melancholy, before she can get over half the day for want of\r\nsomething to do, while the wench in the kitchen sings and scours from\r\nmorning to night.\r\n\r\nThe next disagreeable thing to a lazy lady is a very busy one. A man\r\nof business in good company, who gives an account of his abilities and\r\ndespatches, is hardly more insupportable than her they call a notable\r\nwoman and a manager. Lady Goodday, where I visited the other day at\r\na very polite circle, entertained a great lady with a recipe for a\r\npoultice, and gave us to understand, that she had done extraordinary\r\ncures since she was last in town. It seems a countryman had wounded\r\nhimself with his scythe as he was mowing; and we were obliged to hear\r\nof her charity, her medicine, and her humility, in the harshest tone\r\nand coarsest language imaginable.\r\n\r\nWhat I would request in all this prattle is, that our females would\r\neither let us have their persons or their minds in such perfection as\r\nnature designed them.\r\n\r\nThe way to this is, that those who are in the quality of gentlewomen\r\nshould propose to themselves some suitable method of passing away\r\ntheir time. This would furnish them with reflections and sentiments\r\nproper for the companions of reasonable men, and prevent the unnatural\r\nmarriages which happen every day between the most accomplished women\r\nand the veriest oafs, the worthiest men and the most insignificant\r\nfemales. Were the general turn of women's education of another kind\r\nthan it is at present, we should want one another for more reasons than\r\nwe do as the world now goes. The common design of parents is to get\r\ntheir girls off as well as they can, and make no conscience of putting\r\ninto our hands a bargain for our whole life which will make our hearts\r\nache every day of it.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore take this matter into serious consideration, and\r\nwill propose, for the better improvement of the fair sex, a female\r\nlibrary.[180] This collection of books shall consist of such authors\r\nas do not corrupt while they divert, but shall tend more immediately\r\nto improve them, as they are women. They shall be such as shall not\r\nhurt a feature by the austerity of their reflections, nor cause one\r\nimpertinent glance by the wantonness of them. They shall all tend\r\nto advance the value of their innocence as virgins, improve their\r\nunderstanding as wives, and regulate their tenderness as parents.\r\nIt has been very often said in these Lucubrations, that the ideas\r\nwhich most frequently pass through our imaginations, leave traces of\r\nthemselves in our countenances. There shall be a strict regard had to\r\nthis in my female library, which shall be furnished with nothing that\r\nshall give supplies to ostentation or impertinence; but the whole shall\r\nbe so digested for the use of my students, that they shall not go out\r\nof character in their inquiries, but their knowledge appear only a\r\ncultivated innocence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[177] This lady is believed to have been the unfortunate Elizabeth\r\nMalyn, whose third husband was Charles, eighth Lord Cathcart. Her\r\nfourth husband was Colonel Hugh Macguire, who kept her in confinement\r\nfor more than twenty years at Tempo, in Enniskillen. (See Miss\r\nEdgeworth's \"Castle Rackrent\"; and a pamphlet entitled \"Tewin-Water;\r\nor, the Story of Lady Cathcart,\" by Mr. Edward Ford, of Old Park,\r\nEnfield.)\r\n\r\n[178] \"Æneid,\" i. 315 _seq._\r\n\r\n[179] \"The Double Gallant; or, the Sick Lady's Cure,\" by Colley Cibber\r\n(1707).\r\n\r\n[180] Addison wrote on this subject in the _Spectator_ (No. 37); and\r\nin 1714 Steele published \"The Ladies' Library,\" in three volumes, a\r\ngathering from the most approved religious and moral writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 249.=                                       [ADDISON.\r\n\r\n         From _Thursday, Nov. 9_, to _Saturday, Nov. 11, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum,\r\n    Tendimus----\r\n\r\n                                                      VIRG., Æn. i. 204.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 10._\r\n\r\nI was last night visited by a friend[181] of mine who has an\r\ninexhaustible fund of discourse, and never fails to entertain his\r\ncompany with a variety of thoughts and hints that are altogether new\r\nand uncommon. Whether it were in complaisance to my way of living, or\r\nhis real opinion, he advanced the following paradox, that it required\r\nmuch greater talents to fill up and become a retired life than a life\r\nof business. Upon this occasion he rallied very agreeably the busy men\r\nof the age, who only valued themselves for being in motion, and passing\r\nthrough a series of trifling and insignificant actions. In the heat of\r\nhis discourse, seeing a piece of money lying on my table, \"I defy,\"\r\nsays he, \"any of these active persons to produce half the adventures\r\nthat this twelvepenny-piece has been engaged in, were it possible for\r\nhim to give us an account of his life.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend's talk made so odd an impression upon my mind, that soon\r\nafter I was a-bed I fell insensibly into a most unaccountable reverie,\r\nthat had neither moral nor design in it, and cannot be so properly\r\ncalled a dream as a delirium.\r\n\r\nMethought the shilling that lay upon the table reared itself upon its\r\nedge, and turning the face towards me, opened its mouth, and in a soft\r\nsilver sound gave me the following account of his life and adventures:\r\n\r\n\"I was born,\" says he, \"on the side of a mountain, near a little\r\nvillage of Peru, and made a voyage to England in an ingot, under the\r\nconvoy of Sir Francis Drake. I was, soon after my arrival, taken out\r\nof my Indian habit, refined, naturalised, and put into the British\r\nmode, with the face of Queen Elizabeth on one side, and the arms of the\r\ncountry on the other. Being thus equipped, I found in me a wonderful\r\ninclination to ramble, and visit all the parts of the new world\r\ninto which I was brought. The people very much favoured my natural\r\ndisposition, and shifted me so fast from hand to hand, that before I\r\nwas five years old, I had travelled into almost every corner of the\r\nnation. But in the beginning of my sixth year, to my unspeakable grief,\r\nI fell into the hands of a miserable old fellow, who clapped me into\r\nan iron chest, where I found five hundred more of my own quality who\r\nlay under the same confinement. The only relief we had, was to be taken\r\nout and counted over in the fresh air every morning and evening. After\r\nan imprisonment of several years, we heard somebody knocking at our\r\nchest, and breaking it open with a hammer. This we found was the old\r\nman's heir, who, as his father lay a-dying, was so good as to come to\r\nour release: he separated us that very day. What was the fate of my\r\ncompanions, I know not: as for myself, I was sent to the apothecary's\r\nshop for a pint of sack. The apothecary gave me to a herb-woman, the\r\nherb-woman to a butcher, the butcher to a brewer, and the brewer to\r\nhis wife, who made a present of me to a Nonconformist preacher. After\r\nthis manner I made my way merrily through the world; for, as I told you\r\nbefore, we shillings love nothing so much as travelling. I sometimes\r\nfetched in a shoulder of mutton, sometimes a play-book, and often had\r\nthe satisfaction to treat a Templar at a twelvepenny ordinary, or carry\r\nhim with three friends to Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of this pleasant progress which I made from place to\r\nplace, I was arrested by a superstitious old woman, who shut me up in\r\na greasy purse, in pursuance of a foolish saying, that while she kept\r\na Queen Elizabeth's shilling about her, she should never be without\r\nmoney. I continued here a close prisoner for many months, till at last\r\nI was exchanged for eight-and-forty farthings.\r\n\r\n\"I thus rambled from pocket to pocket till the beginning of the Civil\r\nWars, when, to my shame be it spoken, I was employed in raising\r\nsoldiers against the King; for being of a very tempting breadth, a\r\nsergeant made use of me to inveigle country fellows, and list them in\r\nthe service of the Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he had made one man sure, his way was to oblige him to\r\ntake a shilling of a more homely figure, and then practise the same\r\ntrick upon another. Thus I continued doing great mischief to the Crown,\r\ntill my officer chancing one morning to walk abroad earlier than\r\nordinary, sacrificed me to his pleasures, and made use of me to seduce\r\na milkmaid. This wench bent me, and gave me to her sweetheart, applying\r\nmore properly than she intended the usual form of, 'To my love and from\r\nmy love.' This ungenerous gallant marrying her within few days after,\r\npawned me for a dram of brandy, and drinking me out next day, I was\r\nbeaten flat with a hammer, and again set a-running.\r\n\r\n\"After many adventures, which it would be tedious to relate, I was\r\nsent to a young spendthrift, in company with the will of his deceased\r\nfather. The young fellow, who I found was very extravagant, gave great\r\ndemonstrations of joy at the receiving the will; but opening it, he\r\nfound himself disinherited and cut off from the possession of a fair\r\nestate, by virtue of my being made a present to him. This put him into\r\nsuch a passion, that after having taken me in his hand, and cursed\r\nme, he squirred[182] me away from him as far as he could fling me. I\r\nchanced to light in an unfrequented place under a dead wall, where I\r\nlay undiscovered and useless during the usurpation of Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\n\"About a year after the King's return, a poor cavalier that was walking\r\nthere about dinner-time fortunately cast his eye upon me, and, to the\r\ngreat joy of us both, carried me to a cook's-shop, where he dined upon\r\nme, and drank the King's health. When I came again into the world,\r\nI found that I had been happier in my retirement than I thought,\r\nhaving probably by that means escaped wearing a monstrous pair of\r\nbreeches.[183]\r\n\r\n\"Being now of great credit and antiquity, I was rather looked upon as a\r\nmedal than an ordinary coin; for which reason a gamester laid hold of\r\nme, and converted me to a counter, having got together some dozens of\r\nus for that use. We led a melancholy life in his possession, being busy\r\nat those hours wherein current coin is at rest, and partaking the fate\r\nof our master, being in a few moments valued at a crown, a pound, or a\r\nsixpence, according to the situation in which the fortune of the cards\r\nplaced us. I had at length the good luck to see my master break, by\r\nwhich means I was again sent abroad under my primitive denomination of\r\na shilling.\r\n\r\n\"I shall pass over many other accidents of less moment, and hasten to\r\nthat fatal catastrophe when I fell into the hands of an artist, who\r\nconveyed me under ground, and with an unmerciful pair of shears cut\r\noff my titles, clipped my brims, retrenched my shape, rubbed me to my\r\ninmost ring, and, in short, so spoiled and pillaged me, that he did not\r\nleave me worth a groat. You may think what a confusion I was in to see\r\nmyself thus curtailed and disfigured. I should have been ashamed to\r\nhave shown my head, had not all my old acquaintance been reduced to the\r\nsame shameful figure, excepting some few that were punched through the\r\nbelly. In the midst of this general calamity, when everybody thought\r\nour misfortune irretrievable, and our case desperate, we were thrown\r\ninto the furnace together, and (as it often happens with cities rising\r\nout of a fire) appeared with greater beauty and lustre than we could\r\never boast of before. What has happened to me since the change of\r\nsex which you now see, I shall take some other opportunity to relate.\r\nIn the meantime I shall only repeat two adventures, as being very\r\nextraordinary, and neither of them having ever happened to me above\r\nonce in my life. The first was, my being in a poet's pocket, who was so\r\ntaken with the brightness and novelty of my appearance, that it gave\r\noccasion to the finest burlesque poem in the British language, entitled\r\nfrom me, 'The Splendid Shilling.'[184] The second adventure, which I\r\nmust not omit, happened to me in the year 1703, when I was given away\r\nin charity to a blind man; but indeed this was by a mistake, the person\r\nwho gave me having heedlessly thrown me into the hat among a pennyworth\r\nof farthings.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[181] Swift. This paper is mentioned twice in the \"Journal to Stella,\"\r\nNov. 30 and Dec. 14, 1710: \"You are mistaken in all your conjectures\r\nabout the _Tatlers_. I have given him one or two hints, and you\r\nhave heard me talk about 'The Shilling.'\" \"No, the _Tatler_ of 'The\r\nShilling' was not mine, more than the hint, and two or three general\r\nheads for it. I have much more important business on my hands; and,\r\nbesides, the ministry hate to think that I should help him, and have\r\nmade reproaches on it; and I frankly told them I would do it no more.\r\nThis is a secret, though, Madam Stella.\"\r\n\r\n[182] Threw with a jerk.

The vintner's case[185] which I there tried\r\nis still fresh in every man's memory. That of the petticoat[186] gave\r\nalso a general satisfaction, not to mention the more important points\r\nof the cane and perspective;[187] in which, if I did not give judgments\r\nand decrees according to the strictest rules of equity and justice,\r\nI can safely say, I acted according to the best of my understanding.\r\nBut as for the proceedings of that court, I shall refer my reader\r\nto an account of them, written by my secretary, which is now in the\r\npress, and will shortly be published under the title of \"Lillie's[188]\r\nReports.\"\r\n\r\nAs I last year presided over a Court of Justice, it is my intention\r\nthis year to set myself at the head of a Court of Honour. There is no\r\ncourt of this nature anywhere at present, except in France, where,\r\naccording to the best of my intelligence, it consists of such only as\r\nare marshals of that kingdom. I am likewise informed, that there is not\r\none of that honourable board at present who has not been driven out\r\nof the field by the Duke of Marlborough; but whether this be only an\r\naccidental or a necessary qualification, I must confess I am not able\r\nto determine.\r\n\r\nAs for the Court of Honour of which I am here speaking, I intend to sit\r\nmyself in it as president, with several men of honour on my right hand,\r\nand women of virtue on my left, as my assistants. The first place of\r\nthe bench I have given to an old Tangerine captain with a wooden leg.\r\nThe second is a gentleman of a long twisted periwig without a curl in\r\nit, a muff with very little hair upon it, and a threadbare coat with\r\nnew buttons, being a person of great worth, and second brother to a\r\nman of quality. The third is a gentleman-usher, extremely well read in\r\nromances, and grandson to one of the greatest wits in Germany, who was\r\nsome time master of the ceremonies to the Duke of Wolfembuttel.\r\n\r\nAs for those who sit farther on my right hand, as it is usual in\r\npublic courts, they are such as will fill up the number of faces upon\r\nthe bench, and serve rather for ornament than use.[189]\r\n\r\nThe chief upon my left hand are, an old maiden lady, that preserves\r\nsome of the best blood of England in her veins.\r\n\r\nA Welsh woman of a little stature, but high spirit.\r\n\r\nAn old prude that has censured every marriage for these thirty years,\r\nand is lately wedded to a young rake.\r\n\r\nHaving thus furnished my bench, I shall establish correspondencies with\r\nthe Horse Guards, and the veterans of Chelsea College; the former to\r\nfurnish me with twelve men of honour as often as I shall have occasion\r\nfor a grand jury, and the latter with as many good men and true for a\r\npetty jury.\r\n\r\nAs for the women of virtue, it will not be difficult for me to find\r\nthem about midnight at crimp and basset.\r\n\r\nHaving given this public notice of my court, I must further add, that\r\nI intend to open it on this day sevennight, being Monday the twentieth\r\ninstant; and do hereby invite all such as have suffered injuries and\r\naffronts that are not to be redressed by the common laws of this land,\r\nwhether they be short bows, cold salutations, supercilious looks,\r\nunreturned smiles, distant behaviour, or forced familiarity; as also\r\nall such as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous expression, accidental\r\njostle, or unkind repartee; likewise all such as have been defrauded\r\nof their right to the wall, tricked out of the upper end of the table,\r\nor have been suffered to place themselves in their own wrong on the\r\nback seat of the coach: these, and all of these, I do, as I above said,\r\ninvite to bring in their several cases and complaints, in which they\r\nshall be relieved with all imaginable expedition.\r\n\r\nI am very sensible, that the office I have now taken upon me will\r\nengage me in the disquisition of many weighty points that daily perplex\r\nthe youth of the British nation, and therefore I have already discussed\r\nseveral of them for my future use; as, How far a man may brandish his\r\ncane in the telling a story, without insulting his hearer? What degree\r\nof contradiction amounts to the lie? How a man should resent another's\r\nstaring and cocking a hat in his face? If asking pardon is an atonement\r\nfor treading upon one's toes? Whether a man may put up [with] a box\r\non the ear received from a stranger in the dark? Or, Whether a man of\r\nhonour may take a blow off his wife? With several other subtleties of\r\nthe like nature.\r\n\r\nFor my direction in the duties of my office, I have furnished myself\r\nwith a certain astrological pair of scales which I have contrived\r\nfor this purpose. In one of them I lay the injuries, in the other\r\nthe reparations. The first are represented by little weights made of\r\na metal resembling iron, and the other in gold. These are not only\r\nlighter than the weights made use of in avoirdupois, but also than such\r\nas are used in troy weight. The heaviest of those that represent the\r\ninjuries amount but to a scruple; and decrease by so many subdivisions,\r\nthat there are several imperceptible weights which cannot be seen\r\nwithout the help of a very fine microscope. I might acquaint my reader,\r\nthat these scales were made under the influence of the sun when he was\r\nin Libra, and describe many signatures on the weights both of injury\r\nand reparation: but as this would look rather to proceed from an\r\nostentation of my own art than any care for the public, I shall pass it\r\nover in silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe letter of the 7th instant, inquired for by another of the 11th,\r\ncame to hand.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] See No. 132.\r\n\r\n[186] See No. 116.\r\n\r\n[187] See No. 103.\r\n\r\n[188] Charles Lillie; see No. 110.\r\n\r\n[189] The Masters in Chancery sat on the bench with the Lord\r\nChancellor, but he was the sole judge of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 251.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Tuesday, Nov. 14_, to _Thursday, Nov. 16, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Quisnam igitur liber?

The\r\nway to this state is to measure our actions by our own opinion, and\r\nnot by that of the rest of the world. The sense of other men ought to\r\nprevail over us in things of less consideration, but not in concerns\r\nwhere truth and honour are engaged. When we look into the bottom of\r\nthings, what at first appears a paradox is a plain truth; and those\r\npossessions which, for want of being duly weighed, seem to proceed from\r\na sort of romantic philosophy, and ignorance of the world, after a\r\nlittle reflection are so reasonable, that it is direct madness to walk\r\nby any other rules. Thus to contradict our desires, and to conquer the\r\nimpulses of our ambition, if they do not fall in with what we in our\r\ninward sentiments approve, is so much our interest, and so absolutely\r\nnecessary to our real happiness, that to contemn all the wealth and\r\npower in the world, where they stand in competition with a man's\r\nhonour, is rather good sense than greatness of mind.\r\n\r\nDid we consider that the mind of a man is the man himself, we should\r\nthink it the most unnatural sort of self-murder to sacrifice the\r\nsentiment of the soul to gratify the appetites of the body. Bless\r\nus! Is it possible, that when the necessities of life are supplied,\r\na man would flatter to be rich, or circumvent to be powerful? When\r\nwe meet a poor wretch urged with hunger and cold asking an alms, we\r\nare apt to think this a state we could rather starve than submit\r\nto: but yet how much more despicable is his condition who is above\r\nnecessity, and yet shall resign his reason and his integrity to\r\npurchase superfluities? These are both abject and common beggars; but\r\nsure it is less despicable to beg a supply to a man's hunger than his\r\nvanity. But custom and general prepossessions have so far prevailed\r\nover an unthinking world, that those necessitous creatures who cannot\r\nrelish life without applause, attendance, and equipage, are so far from\r\nmaking a contemptible figure, that distressed virtue is less esteemed\r\nthan successful vice. But if a man's appeal in cases that regarded his\r\nhonour were made to his own soul, there would be a basis and standing\r\nrule for our conduct, and we should always endeavour rather to be\r\nthan appear honourable. Mr. Collier, in his essay on Fortitude,[190]\r\nhas treated this subject with great wit and magnanimity. \"What,\" says\r\nhe, \"can be more honourable than to have courage enough to execute\r\nthe commands of reason and conscience; to maintain the dignity of our\r\nnature, and the station assigned us? To be proof against poverty,\r\npain, and death itself? I mean so far as not to do anything that is\r\nscandalous or sinful to avoid them? To stand adversity under all\r\nshapes with decency and resolution? To do this, is to be great above\r\ntitle and fortune. This argues the soul of a heavenly extraction, and\r\nis worthy the offspring of the Deity.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a generous ambition has this man pointed to us? When men have\r\nsettled in themselves a conviction by such noble precepts, that there\r\nis nothing honourable that is not accompanied with innocence; nothing\r\nmean but what has guilt in it; I say, when they have attained thus\r\nmuch, though poverty, pain, and death may still retain their terrors,\r\nyet riches, pleasures, and honours will easily lose their charms, if\r\nthey stand between us and our integrity.\r\n\r\nWhat is here said with allusion to fortune and fame, may as justly be\r\napplied to wit and beauty; for these latter are as adventitious as the\r\nother, and as little concern the essence of the soul. They are all\r\nlaudable in the man who possesses them only for the just application of\r\nthem. A bright imagination, while it is subservient to an honest and\r\nnoble soul, is a faculty which makes a man justly admired by mankind,\r\nand furnishes him with reflections upon his own actions, which add\r\ndelicates to the feast of a good conscience: but when wit descends to\r\nwait upon sensual pleasures, or promote the base purposes of ambition,\r\nit is then to be contemned in proportion to its excellence. If a man\r\nwill not resolve to place the foundation of his happiness in his\r\nown mind, life is a bewildered and unhappy state, incapable of rest\r\nor tranquillity: for to such a one the general applause of valour,\r\nwit, nay of honesty itself, can give him but a very feeble comfort,\r\nsince it is capable of being interrupted by any one who wants either\r\nunderstanding or good-nature to see or acknowledge such excellences.\r\nThis rule is so necessary, that one may very safely say, it is\r\nimpossible to know any true relish of our being without it. Look about\r\nyou in common life among the ordinary race of mankind, and you will\r\nfind merit in every kind is allowed only to those who are in particular\r\ndistricts or sets of company: but since men can have little pleasure\r\nin these faculties which denominate them persons of distinction, let\r\nthem give up such an empty pursuit, and think nothing essential to\r\nhappiness but what is in their own power, the capacity of reflecting\r\nwith pleasure on their own actions, however they are interpreted.\r\n\r\nIt is so evident a truth, that it is only in our own bosoms we are to\r\nsearch for anything to make us happy, that it is, methinks, a disgrace\r\nto our nature to talk of the taking our measures from thence only as\r\na matter of fortitude. When all is well there, the vicissitudes and\r\ndistinctions of life are the mere scenes of a drama, and he will never\r\nact his part well who has his thoughts more fixed upon the applause of\r\nthe audience than the design of his part.\r\n\r\nThe life of a man who acts with a steady integrity, without valuing the\r\ninterpretation of his actions, has but one uniform regular path to move\r\nin, where he cannot meet opposition, or fear ambuscade. On the other\r\nside, the least deviation from the rules of honour introduces a train\r\nof numberless evils, and involves him in inexplicable mazes. He that\r\nhas entered into guilt has bid adieu to rest, and every criminal has\r\nhis share of the misery expressed so emphatically in the tragedian:[191]\r\n\r\n                  _Macbeth shall sleep no more!_[192]\r\n\r\nIt was with detestation of any other grandeur but the calm command of\r\nhis own passion, that the excellent Mr. Cowley cries out with so much\r\njustice:\r\n\r\n    _If e'er ambition did my fancy cheat\r\n    With any thought so mean as to be great,\r\n    Continue, Heaven, still from me to remove\r\n    The humble blessings of that life I love._[193]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[190] See Jeremy Collier's \"Essays upon Several Moral Subjects\" (1709),\r\nPart iv. pp. 205-236.\r\n\r\n[191] Here used for tragic writer.\r\n\r\n[192] \"Macbeth,\" act ii. sc. 2.\r\n\r\n[193] \"Essays,\" vi.: \"Of Greatness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 252.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Thursday, Nov. 16_ to _Saturday, Nov. 18, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Narratur et prisci Catonis\r\n      Sæpe mero caluisse virtus.\r\n\r\n                                                    HOR., 3 Od. xxi. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 17._\r\n\r\nThe following letter, and several others to the same purpose, accuse\r\nme of a rigour of which I am far from being guilty, to wit, the\r\ndisallowing the cheerful use of wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"_From my Country-house,\r\n                                                               Oct. 25._\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"Your discourse against drinking, in Tuesday's _Tatler_,[194] I like\r\nwell enough in the main; but in my humble opinion, you are become\r\ntoo rigid where you say to this effect: 'Were there only this single\r\nconsideration, that we are the less masters of ourselves if we drink\r\nthe least proportion beyond the exigence of thirst.' I hope no one\r\ndrinks wine to allay this appetite. This seems to be designed for a\r\nloftier indulgence of Nature; for it were hard to suppose, that the\r\nAuthor of Nature, who imposed upon her her necessities and pains, does\r\nnot allow her her pleasures, and we may reckon among the latter the\r\nmoderate use of the grape: and though I am as much against excess, or\r\nwhatever approaches it, as yourself, yet I conceive one may safely\r\ngo further than the bounds you there prescribe, not only without\r\nforfeiting the title of being one's own master, but also to possess\r\nit in a much greater degree. If a man's expressing himself upon any\r\nsubject with more life and vivacity, more variety of ideas, more\r\ncopiously, more fluently, and more to the purpose, argues it, he thinks\r\nclearer, speaks more ready, and with greater choice of comprehensive\r\nand significant terms. I have the good fortune now to be intimate\r\nwith a gentleman remarkable for this temper, who has an inexhaustible\r\nsource of wit to entertain the curious, the grave, the humorous, and\r\nthe frolic. He can transform himself into different shapes, and adapt\r\nhimself to every company; yet in a coffee-house, or in the ordinary\r\ncourse of affairs, appears rather dull than sprightly. You can seldom\r\nget him to the tavern, but when once he is arrived to his pint, and\r\nbegins to look about and like his company, you admire a thousand things\r\nin him, which before lay buried. Then you discover the brightness of\r\nhis mind and the strength of his judgment, accompanied with the most\r\ngraceful mirth. In a word, by this enlivening aid, he is whatever is\r\npolite, instructive, and diverting. What makes him still more agreeable\r\nis, that he tells a story, serious or comical, with as much delicacy\r\nof humour as Cervantes himself. And for all this, at other times,\r\neven after a long knowledge of him, you shall scarce discern in this\r\nincomparable person a whit more than what might be expected from one\r\nof a common capacity. Doubtless there are men of great parts that are\r\nguilty of downright bashfulness, that by a strange hesitation and\r\nreluctance to speak, murder the finest and most elegant thoughts, and\r\nrender the most lively conceptions flat and heavy.\r\n\r\n\"In this case, a certain quantity of my white or red cordial, which you\r\nwill, is an easy, but an infallible remedy. It awakens the judgment,\r\nquickens memory, ripens understanding, disperses melancholy, cheers the\r\nheart; in a word, restores the whole man to himself and his friends\r\nwithout the least pain or indisposition to the patient. To be taken\r\nonly in the evening in a reasonable quantity before going to bed.\r\n_Note._--My bottles are sealed with three fleurs-de-lis and a bunch of\r\ngrapes. Beware of counterfeits. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Your most humble Servant, &c.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever has been said against the use of wine, upon the supposition\r\nthat it enfeebles the mind, and renders it unfit for the duties of\r\nlife, bears forcibly to the advantage of that delicious juice, in cases\r\nwhere it only heightens conversation, and brings to light agreeable\r\ntalents, which otherwise would have lain concealed under the oppression\r\nof an unjust modesty. I must acknowledge I have seen many of the temper\r\nmentioned by this correspondent, and own, wine may very allowably be\r\nused in a degree above the supply of mere necessity by such as labour\r\nunder melancholy, or are tongue-tied by modesty. It is certainly a very\r\nagreeable change, when we see a glass raise a lifeless conversation\r\ninto all the pleasures of wit and good-humour. But when Caska adds to\r\nhis natural impudence the fluster of a bottle, that which fools called\r\nfire when he was sober, all men abhor as outrage when he is drunk. Thus\r\nhe that in the morning was only saucy, is in the evening tumultuous.\r\nIt makes one sick to hear one of these fellows say, they love a friend\r\nand a bottle. Noisy mirth has something too rustic in it to be\r\nconsidered without terror by men of politeness: but while the discourse\r\nimproves in a well-chosen company, from the addition of spirits which\r\nflow from moderate cups, it must be acknowledged, that leisure time\r\ncannot be more agreeably, or perhaps more usefully employed than at\r\nsuch meetings: but there is a certain prudence in this and all other\r\ncircumstances which makes right or wrong in the conduct of ordinary\r\nlife. Sir Geoffrey Wildacre has nothing so much at heart as that his\r\nson should know the world betimes: for this end he introduces him among\r\nthe sots of his own age, where the boy learns to laugh at his father\r\nfrom the familiarity with which he sees him treated by his equals. This\r\nthe old fellow calls living well with his heir, and teaching him to be\r\ntoo much his friend to be impatient for his estate. But for the more\r\nexact regulation of society in this and other matters, I shall publish\r\ntables of the characters and relations among men, and by them instruct\r\nthe town in making sets and companies for a bottle. This humour of Sir\r\nGeoffrey shall be taken notice of in the first place; for there is,\r\nmethinks, a sort of incest in drunkenness, and sons are not to behold\r\nfathers stripped of all reverence.\r\n\r\nIt is shocking in nature for the young to see those whom they should\r\nhave an awe for in circumstances of contempt. I shall therefore utterly\r\nforbid, that those in whom nature should admonish to avoid too gross\r\nfamiliarities, shall be received in parties of pleasure where there is\r\nthe least danger of excess. I should run through the whole doctrine of\r\ndrinking, but that my thoughts are at present too much employed in the\r\nmodelling my Court of Honour; and altering the seats, benches, bar, and\r\ncanopy from that of the court wherein I last winter sat upon causes\r\nof less moment. By the way, I shall take an opportunity to examine,\r\nwhat method is to be taken to make joiners and other artificers get out\r\nof a house they have once entered, not forgetting to tie them under\r\nproper regulations. It is for want of such rules, that I have a day or\r\ntwo longer than I expected been tormented and deafened with hammers,\r\ninsomuch that I neither can pursue this discourse, or answer the\r\nfollowing and many other letters of the highest importance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"We are man and wife, and have a boy and a girl: the lad seventeen, the\r\nmaiden sixteen.

Mr. Truncheon immediately\r\ndrew his sword, and holding it with the point towards his own body,\r\npresented it to the censor. Mr. Bickerstaff received it, and after\r\nhaving surveyed the breadth of the blade, and sharpness of the point,\r\nwith more than ordinary attention, returned it to the foreman in a very\r\ngraceful manner. The rest of the jury, upon the delivery of the sword\r\nto their foreman, drew all of them together as one man, and saluted the\r\nbench with such an air, as signified the most resigned submission to\r\nthose who commanded them, and the greatest magnanimity to execute what\r\nthey should command.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff, after having received the compliments on his right\r\nhand, cast his eye upon the left, where the whole female jury paid\r\ntheir respects by a low courtesy, and by laying their hands upon their\r\nmouths. Their forewoman was a professed Platonist,[197] that had spent\r\nmuch of her time in exhorting the sex to set a just value upon their\r\npersons, and to make the men know themselves.\r\n\r\nThere followed a profound silence, when at length, after some\r\nrecollection, the censor, who continued hitherto uncovered, put on his\r\nhat with great dignity; and after having composed the brims of it in a\r\nmanner suitable to the gravity of his character, he gave the following\r\ncharge, which was received with silence and attention, that being the\r\nonly applause which he admits of, or is ever given in his presence:\r\n\r\n\"The nature of my office, and the solemnity of this occasion, requiring\r\nthat I should open my first session with a speech, I shall cast what I\r\nhave to say under two principal heads.\r\n\r\n\"Under the first, I shall endeavour to show the necessity and\r\nusefulness of this new-erected court; and under the second, I shall\r\ngive a word of advice and instruction to every constituent part of it.\r\n\r\n\"As for the first, it is well observed by Phædrus, a heathen poet:\r\n\r\n        _Nisi utile est quod facimus, frustra est gloria._[198]\r\n\r\nWhich is the same, ladies, as if I should say, It would be of no\r\nreputation for me to be president of a court which is of no benefit to\r\nthe public. Now the advantages that may arise to the weal-public from\r\nthis institution will more plainly appear, if we consider what it\r\nsuffers for the want of it. Are not our streets daily filled with wild\r\npieces of justice and random penalties? Are not crimes undetermined,\r\nand reparations disproportioned? How often have we seen the lie\r\npunished by death, and the liar himself deciding his own cause? nay,\r\nnot only acting the judge, but the executioner? Have we not known a\r\nbox on the ear more severely accounted for than manslaughter? In these\r\nextra-judicial proceedings of mankind, an unmannerly jest is frequently\r\nas capital as a premeditated murder.\r\n\r\n\"But the most pernicious circumstance in this case is, that the man\r\nwho suffers the injury must put himself upon the same foot of danger\r\nwith him that gave it, before he can have his just revenge; so that\r\nthe punishment is altogether accidental, and may fall as well upon the\r\ninnocent as the guilty.\r\n\r\n\"I shall only mention a case which happens frequently among the more\r\npolite nations of the world, and which I the rather mention, because\r\nboth sexes are concerned in it, and which therefore you gentlemen\r\nand you ladies of the jury will the rather take notice of; I mean\r\nthat great and known case of cuckoldom. Supposing the person who has\r\nsuffered insults in his dearer and better half; supposing, I say, this\r\nperson should resent the injuries done to his tender wife, what is the\r\nreparation he may expect? Why, to be used worse than his poor lady, run\r\nthrough the body, and left breathless upon the bed of honour. What then\r\nwill you on my right hand say must the man do that is affronted? Must\r\nour sides be elbowed, our shins broken? Must the wall, or perhaps our\r\nmistress, be taken from us? May a man knit his forehead into a frown,\r\ntoss up his arm, or pish at what we say, and must the villain live\r\nafter it? Is there no redress for injured honour? Yes, gentlemen, that\r\nis the design of the judicature we have here established.\r\n\r\n\"A Court of Conscience, we very well know, was first instituted for\r\nthe determining of several points of property that were too little and\r\ntrivial for the cognisance of higher courts of justice. In the same\r\nmanner, our Court of Honour is appointed for the examination of several\r\nniceties and punctilios that do not pass for wrongs in the eye of our\r\ncommon laws. But notwithstanding no legislators of any nation have\r\ntaken into consideration these little circumstances, they are such as\r\noften lead to crimes big enough for their inspection, though they come\r\nbefore them too late for their redress.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, I appeal to you, ladies [here Mr. Bickerstaff turned to his\r\nleft hand], if these are not the little stings and thorns in life\r\nthat make it more uneasy than its most substantial evils? Confess\r\ningenuously, did you never lose a morning's devotions because you could\r\nnot offer them up from the highest place of the pew? Have you not been\r\nin pain, even at a ball, because another has been taken out to dance\r\nbefore you? Do you love any of your friends so much as those that are\r\nbelow you?

You\r\nhave answered me in your looks, I ask no more.\r\n\r\n\"I come now to the second part of my discourse, which obliges me to\r\naddress myself in particular to the respective members of the court, in\r\nwhich I shall be very brief.\r\n\r\n\"As for you, gentlemen and ladies, my assistants and grand juries,\r\nI have made choice of you on my right hand, because I know you very\r\njealous of your honour; and you on my left, because I know you very\r\nmuch concerned for the reputation of others; for which reason I expect\r\ngreat exactness and impartiality in your verdicts and judgments.\r\n\r\n\"I must in the next place address myself to you, gentlemen of the\r\ncouncil: you all know, that I have not chosen you for your knowledge\r\nin the litigious parts of the law, but because you have all of you\r\nformerly fought duels, of which I have reason to think you have\r\nrepented, as being now settled in the peaceable state of benchers.\r\nMy advice to you is, only that in your pleadings you are short and\r\nexpressive: to which end you are to banish out of your discourses all\r\nsynonymous terms, and unnecessary multiplications of verbs and nouns.\r\nI do moreover forbid you the use of the words 'also' and 'likewise';\r\nand must further declare, that if I catch any one among you, upon any\r\npretence whatsoever, using the particle 'or,' I shall incessantly order\r\nhim to be stripped of his gown, and thrown over the bar.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a true copy.--CHARLES LILLIE.\"\r\n\r\n_N.B._--The sequel of the proceedings of this day will be published on\r\nTuesday next.[199]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[195] Tickell says that Steele assisted in this paper.\r\n\r\n[196] See No. 250.\r\n\r\n[197] Mary Astell (see Nos. 32 and 166).\r\n\r\n[198] \"Fables,\" iii. 17. 12.

Among all the authors of this kind, our\r\nrenowned countryman Sir John Mandeville[201] has distinguished himself,\r\nby the copiousness of his invention, and greatness of his genius. The\r\nsecond to Sir John I take to have been Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,[202]\r\na person of infinite adventure and unbounded imagination. One reads\r\nthe voyages of these two great wits with as much astonishment as the\r\ntravels of Ulysses in Homer, or of the Red-Cross Knight in Spenser. All\r\nis enchanted ground and fairy-land.\r\n\r\nI have got into my hands by great chance several manuscripts of these\r\ntwo eminent authors, which are filled with greater wonders than any\r\nof those they have communicated to the public; and indeed, were they\r\nnot so well attested, would appear altogether improbable. I am apt to\r\nthink, the ingenious authors did not publish them with the rest of\r\ntheir works, lest they should pass for fictions and fables: a caution\r\nnot unnecessary, when the reputation of their veracity was not yet\r\nestablished in the world. But as this reason has now no further weight,\r\nI shall make the public a present of these curious pieces at such times\r\nas I shall find myself unprovided with other subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present paper I intend to fill with an extract of Sir John's\r\njournal, in which that learned and worthy knight gives an account of\r\nthe freezing and thawing of several short speeches which he made in the\r\nterritories of Nova Zembla.[203] I need not inform my reader, that\r\nthe author of \"Hudibras\" alludes to this strange quality in that cold\r\nclimate, when, speaking of abstracted notions clothed in a visible\r\nshape, he adds that apt simile:\r\n\r\n              _Like words congealed in Northern air._[204]\r\n\r\nNot to keep my reader any longer in suspense, the relation put into\r\nmodern language is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We were separated by a storm in the latitude of 73, insomuch that only\r\nthe ship which I was in, with a Dutch and a French vessel, got safe\r\ninto a creek of Nova Zembla. We landed, in order to refit our vessels,\r\nand store ourselves with provisions. The crew of each vessel made\r\nthemselves a cabin of turf and wood, at some distance from each other,\r\nto fence themselves against the inclemencies of the weather, which was\r\nsevere beyond imagination. We soon observed, that in talking to one\r\nanother we lost several of our words, and could not hear one another at\r\nabove two yards' distance, and that too when we sat very near the fire.\r\nAfter much perplexity, I found that our words froze in the air before\r\nthey could reach the ears of the person to whom they were spoken. I\r\nwas soon confirmed in this conjecture, when, upon the increase of the\r\ncold, the whole company grew dumb, or rather deaf; for every man was\r\nsensible, as we afterwards found, that he spoke as well as ever; but\r\nthe sounds no sooner took air than they were condensed and lost. It was\r\nnow a miserable spectacle to see us nodding and gaping at one another,\r\nevery man talking, and no man heard. One might observe a seaman that\r\ncould hail a ship at a league distance, beckoning with his hands,\r\nstraining his lungs, and tearing his throat, but all in vain.\r\n\r\n               _----Nec vox, nec verba, sequuntur._[205]\r\n\r\n\"We continued here three weeks in this dismal plight. At length, upon a\r\nturn of wind, the air about us began to thaw. Our cabin was immediately\r\nfilled with a dry clattering sound, which I afterwards found to be the\r\ncrackling of consonants that broke above our heads, and were often\r\nmixed with a gentle hissing, which I imputed to the letter S, that\r\noccurs so frequently in the English tongue. I soon after felt a breeze\r\nof whispers rushing by my ear; for those being of a soft and gentle\r\nsubstance, immediately liquefied in the warm wind that blew across our\r\ncabin. These were soon followed by syllables and short words, and at\r\nlength by entire sentences, that melted sooner or later, as they were\r\nmore or less congealed; so that we now heard everything that had been\r\nspoken during the whole three weeks that we had been silent, if I may\r\nuse that expression. It was now very early in the morning, and yet,\r\nto my surprise, I heard somebody say, 'Sir John, it is midnight, and\r\ntime for the ship's crew to go to bed.' This I knew to be the pilot's\r\nvoice, and upon recollecting myself, I concluded that he had spoken\r\nthese words to me some days before, though I could not hear them before\r\nthe present thaw. My reader will easily imagine how the whole crew was\r\namazed, to hear every man talking, and see no man opening his mouth.\r\nIn the midst of this great surprise we were all in, we heard a volley\r\nof oaths and curses, lasting for a long while, and uttered in a hoarse\r\nvoice, which I knew belonged to the boatswain, who was a very choleric\r\nfellow, and had taken his opportunity of cursing and swearing at me\r\nwhen he thought I could not hear him; for I had several times given him\r\nthe strappado on that account, as I did not fail to repeat it for these\r\nhis pious soliloquies when I got him on shipboard.\r\n\r\n\"I must not omit the names of several beauties in Wapping, which were\r\nheard every now and then, in the midst of a long sigh that accompanied\r\nthem; as, 'Dear Kate!' 'Pretty Mrs. Peggy!' 'When shall I see my Sue\r\nagain?' This betrayed several amours which had been concealed till that\r\ntime, and furnished us with a great deal of mirth in our return to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\"When this confusion of voices was pretty well over, though I was\r\nafraid to offer at speaking, as fearing I should not be heard, I\r\nproposed a visit to the Dutch cabin, which lay about a mile farther\r\nup into the country. My crew were extremely rejoiced to find they had\r\nagain recovered their hearing, though every man uttered his voice with\r\nthe same apprehensions that I had done.\r\n\r\n            _----Et timide verba intermissa retentat._[206]\r\n\r\n\"At about half a mile's distance from our cabin, we heard the groanings\r\nof a bear, which at first startled us; but upon inquiry we were\r\ninformed by some of our company, that he was dead, and now lay in salt,\r\nhaving been killed upon that very spot about a fortnight before, in\r\nthe time of the frost. Not far from the same place we were likewise\r\nentertained with some posthumous snarls and barkings of a fox.\r\n\r\n\"We at length arrived at the little Dutch settlement, and upon entering\r\nthe room, found it filled with sighs that smelt of brandy, and several\r\nother unsavoury sounds that were altogether inarticulate. My valet,\r\nwho was an Irishman, fell into so great a rage at what he heard, that\r\nhe drew his sword; but not knowing where to lay the blame, he put it\r\nup again. We were stunned with these confused noises, but did not hear\r\na single word till about half-an-hour after; which I ascribed to the\r\nharsh and obdurate sounds of that language, which wanted more time than\r\nours to melt and become audible.\r\n\r\n\"After having here met with a very hearty welcome, we went to the\r\nFrench cabin, who, to make amends for their three weeks' silence, were\r\ntalking and disputing with greater rapidity and confusion than ever I\r\nheard in an assembly even of that nation. Their language as I found,\r\nupon the first giving of the weather, fell asunder and dissolved. I\r\nwas here convinced of an error into which I had before fallen; for I\r\nfancied, that for the freezing of the sound, it was necessary for it\r\nto be wrapped up, and, as it were, preserved in breath; but I found\r\nmy mistake, when I heard the sound of a kit playing a minuet over our\r\nheads. I asked the occasion of it; upon which one of the company told\r\nme, that it would play there above a week longer if the thaw continued;\r\n'for,' says he, 'finding ourselves bereft of speech, we prevailed upon\r\none of the company, who had this musical instrument about him, to play\r\nto us from morning to night; all which time we employed in dancing, in\r\norder to dissipate our chagrin, _et tuer le temps_.'\"\r\n\r\nHere Sir John gives very good philosophical reasons why the kit could\r\nbe heard during the frost; but as they are something prolix, I pass\r\nthem over in silence, and shall only observe, that the honourable\r\nauthor seems, by his quotations, to have been well versed in the\r\nancient poets, which perhaps raised his fancy above the ordinary pitch\r\nof historians, and very much contributed to the embellishment of his\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200] \"Sir R.

Whether or no you shall\r\nthink it a proper case to come before your Court of Honour, I cannot\r\ntell; but thus it is: I am chaplain to an honourable family, very\r\nregular at the hours of devotion, and I hope of an unblamable life; but\r\nfor not offering to rise at a second course, I found my patron and his\r\nlady very sullen and out of humour, though at first I did not know the\r\nreason of it. At length, when I happened to help myself to a jelly, the\r\nlady of the house, otherwise a devout woman, told me, that it did not\r\nbecome a man of my cloth to delight in such frivolous food: but as I\r\nstill continued to sit out the last course, I was yesterday informed by\r\nthe butler, that his lordship had no further occasion for my service.\r\nAll which is humbly submitted to your consideration by,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n      \"Your most humble Servant, &c.\"[207]\r\n\r\nThe case of this gentleman deserves pity, especially if he loves\r\nsweetmeats, to which, if I may guess by his letter, he is no enemy. In\r\nthe meantime, I have often wondered at the indecency of discarding the\r\nholiest man from the table as soon as the most delicious parts of the\r\nentertainment are served up, and could never conceive a reason for so\r\nabsurd a custom. Is it because a liquorish palate or a sweet tooth (as\r\nthey call it) is not consistent with the sanctity of his character?\r\nThis is but a trifling pretence. No man of the most rigid virtue gives\r\noffence by any excesses in plum-pudding or plum-porridge, and that,\r\nbecause they are the first parts of the dinner. Is there anything\r\nthat tends to incitation in sweetmeats more than in ordinary dishes?\r\nCertainly not. Sugar-plums are a very innocent diet, and conserves of a\r\nmuch colder nature than your common pickles. I have sometimes thought\r\nthat the ceremony of the chaplain's flying away from the dessert was\r\ntypical and figurative, to mark out to the company how they ought\r\nto retire from all the luscious baits of temptation, and deny their\r\nappetites the gratifications that are most pleasing to them; or at\r\nleast to signify, that we ought to stint ourselves in our most lawful\r\nsatisfactions, and not make our pleasure, but our support, the end of\r\neating: but most certainly, if such a lesson of temperance had been\r\nnecessary at a table, our clergy would have recommended it to all the\r\nlay-masters of families, and not have disturbed other men's tables with\r\nsuch unseasonable examples of abstinence. The original, therefore,\r\nof this barbarous custom I take to have been merely accidental.\r\nThe chaplain retired out of pure complaisance to make room for the\r\nremoval of the dishes, or possibly for the ranging of the dessert.\r\nThis by degrees grew into a duty, till at length, as the fashion\r\nimproved, the good man found himself cut off from the third part of\r\nthe entertainment; and if the arrogance of the patron goes on, it is\r\nnot impossible but, in the next generation, he may see himself reduced\r\nto the tithe, or tenth dish of the table; a sufficient caution not to\r\npart with any privilege we are once possessed of. It was usual for the\r\npriest in old times to feast upon the sacrifice, nay the honey-cake,\r\nwhile the hungry laity looked upon him with great devotion, or as the\r\nlate Lord Rochester describes it in a very lively manner:\r\n\r\n           _And while the priest did eat, the people stared._\r\n\r\nAt present the custom is inverted; the laity feast, while the priest\r\nstands by as a humble spectator. This necessarily puts the good man\r\nupon making great ravages on all the dishes that stand near him, and\r\ndistinguishing himself by voraciousness of appetite, as knowing that\r\nhis time is short. I would fain ask these stiff-necked patrons,\r\nwhether they would not take it ill of a chaplain that, in his grace\r\nafter meat, should return thanks for the whole entertainment, with an\r\nexception to the dessert? And yet I cannot but think, that in such a\r\nproceeding he would but deal with them as they deserved. What would a\r\nRoman Catholic priest think, who is always helped first, and placed\r\nnext the ladies, should he see a clergyman giving his company the\r\nslip at the first appearance of the tarts or sweetmeats? Would not\r\nhe believe that he had the same antipathy to a candied orange, or a\r\npiece of puff-paste, as some have to a Cheshire cheese, or a breast of\r\nmutton? Yet to so ridiculous a height is this foolish custom grown,\r\nthat even the Christmas pie, which in its very nature is a kind of\r\nconsecrated cate, and a badge of distinction, is often forbidden to the\r\nDruid of the family. Strange! that a sirloin of beef, whether boiled\r\nor roasted, when entire, is exposed to his utmost depredations and\r\nincisions; but if minced into small pieces, and tossed up with plums\r\nand sugar, changes its property, and, forsooth, is meat for his master.\r\n\r\nIn this case I know not which to censure, the patron or the chaplain,\r\nthe insolence of power, or the abjectness of dependence. For my own\r\npart, I have often blushed to see a gentleman, whom I knew to have\r\nmuch more wit and learning than myself, and who was bred up with me at\r\nthe University upon the same foot of a liberal education, treated in\r\nsuch an ignominious manner, and sunk beneath those of his own rank, by\r\nreason of that character which ought to bring him honour. This deters\r\nmen of generous minds from placing themselves in such a station of\r\nlife, and by that means frequently excludes persons of quality from the\r\nimproving and agreeable conversation of a learned and obsequious friend.\r\n\r\nMr. Oldham lets us know, that he was affrighted from the thought of\r\nsuch an employment by the scandalous sort of treatment which often\r\naccompanies it:\r\n\r\n    _Some think themselves exalted to the sky\r\n    If they light in some noble family:\r\n    Diet, a horse, and thirty pounds a year,\r\n    Besides the advantage of his lordship's ear.\r\n    The credit of the business, and the state,\r\n    Are things that in a youngster's sense sound great.\r\n    Little the inexperienced wretch does know\r\n    What slavery he oft must undergo:\r\n    Who, though in silken scarf and cassock dressed,\r\n    Wears but a gayer livery at best.\r\n    When dinner calls, the implement must wait,\r\n    With holy words to consecrate the meat;\r\n    But hold it for a favour seldom known,\r\n    If he be deigned the honour to sit down.\r\n    Soon as the tarts appear, Sir Crape, withdraw,\r\n    Those dainties are not for a spiritual maw.\r\n    Observe your distance, and be sure to stand\r\n    Hard by the cistern with your cap in hand:\r\n    There for diversion you may pick your teeth,\r\n    Till the kind voider comes for your relief.\r\n    Let others who such meannesses can brook,\r\n    Strike countenance to every great man's look;\r\n    I rate my freedom higher._[208]\r\n\r\nThis author's raillery is the raillery of a friend, and does not turn\r\nthe sacred order into ridicule, but is a just censure on such persons\r\nas take advantage from the necessities of a man of merit, to impose\r\non him hardships that are by no means suitable to the dignity of his\r\nprofession.[209]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[207] Mr. Overton, in his \"Life in the English Church, 1660-1714,\"\r\ndenies the truth of Macaulay's account of the condition of the clergy.\r\nHe points out that the sons of many noble families were in the\r\nChurch, and many clergymen of the highest standing were once domestic\r\nchaplains. But there was much \"contempt of the clergy,\" as Eachard\r\nputs it, in his book published in 1670. Many enjoyed pluralities,\r\nwhich, of course, meant that a larger number than would otherwise have\r\nbeen the case were poor all their lives. Swift wrote: \"I never dined\r\nwith the chaplains till to-day; but my friend Gastrel and the Dean of\r\nRochester had often invited me, and I happened to be disengaged: it is\r\nthe worst provided table at court. We ate on pewter. Every chaplain,\r\nwhen he is made a dean, gives a piece of plate, and so they have got a\r\nlittle, some of it very old\" (\"Journal,\" October 6, 1711). See, too,\r\nSwift's \"Project for the Advancement of Religion,\" and \"Directions to\r\nthe Waiting-Maid.\" Many private chaplains had salaries of £10 to £30\r\na year, with vales, and were called Mess Johns, trencher chaplains,\r\nand young Levites (Lecky's \"History of England in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury,\" i. 77, 78). Bishop Bramhall replied to Eachard in 1671, in\r\n\"An Answer to a Letter of Inquiry,\" &c., and said that some gentlemen,\r\nat any rate, treated their chaplains with all proper respect. Edward\r\nChamberlayne, on the other hand, in his \"Angliæ Notitia\" (1669),\r\nsaid that men thought it a stain to their blood to make their sons\r\nclergymen, and that women were ashamed to marry with any of them.\r\n\r\n[208] Oldham's \"Satire addressed to a Friend that is about to leave the\r\nUniversity.\"\r\n\r\n[209] \"The last paper having been worked off in different presses,\r\nthere are some errata in one set of them, which the reader is desired\r\nto correct,\" &c.

The\r\nprosecutor alleged, that he was the cadet of a very ancient family;\r\nand that according to the principles of all the younger brothers of\r\nthe said family, he had never sullied himself with business, but had\r\nchosen rather to starve like a man of honour than do anything beneath\r\nhis quality. He produced several witnesses, that he had never employed\r\nhimself beyond the twisting of a whip, or the making of a pair of\r\nnut-crackers, in which he only worked for his diversion, in order to\r\nmake a present now and then to his friends. The prisoner being asked\r\nwhat he could say for himself, cast several reflections upon the\r\nHonourable Mr. Gules: as, that he was not worth a groat; that nobody\r\nin the city would trust him for a halfpenny; that he owed him money,\r\nwhich he had promised to pay him several times, but never kept his\r\nword; and in short, that he was an idle, beggarly fellow, and of no\r\nuse to the public. This sort of language was very severely reprimanded\r\nby the Censor, who told the criminal, that he spoke in contempt of the\r\ncourt, and that he should be proceeded against for contumacy if he did\r\nnot change his style. The prisoner therefore desired to be heard by\r\nhis counsel, who urged in his defence, that he put on his hat through\r\nignorance, and took the wall by accident. They likewise produced\r\nseveral witnesses, that he made several motions with his hat in his\r\nhand, which are generally understood as an invitation to the person we\r\ntalk with to be covered; and that the gentleman not taking the hint,\r\nhe was forced to put on his hat, as being troubled with a cold. There\r\nwas likewise an Irishman who deposed, that he had heard him cough three\r\nand twenty times that morning. And as for the wall, it was alleged that\r\nhe had taken it inadvertently to save himself from a shower of rain\r\nwhich was then falling. The Censor having consulted the men of honour\r\nwho sat at his right hand on the bench, found they were all of opinion,\r\nthat the defence made by the prisoner's counsel did rather aggravate\r\nthan extenuate his crime; that the motions and intimations of the hat\r\nwere a token of superiority in conversation, and therefore not to be\r\nused by the criminal to a man of the prosecutor's quality, who was\r\nlikewise vested with a double title to the wall at the time of their\r\nconversation, both as it was the upper hand, and as it was a shelter\r\nfrom the weather. The evidence being very full and clear, the jury,\r\nwithout going out of court, declared their opinion unanimously by the\r\nmouth of their foreman, that the prosecutor was bound in honour to make\r\nthe sun shine through the criminal, or, as they afterwards explained\r\nthemselves, to whip him through the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe Censor knitting his brows into a frown, and looking very sternly\r\nupon the jury, after a little pause, gave them to know, that this court\r\nwas erected for the finding out of penalties suitable to offences,\r\nand to restrain the outrages of private justice; and that he expected\r\nthey should moderate their verdict. The jury therefore retired, and\r\nbeing willing to comply with the advices of the Censor, after an hour's\r\nconsultation, declared their opinion as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That in consideration this was Peter Plumb's first offence, and that\r\nthere did not appear any _malice prepense_ in it, as also that he\r\nlived in good reputation among his neighbours, and that his taking the\r\nwall was only _se defendendo_, the prosecutor should let him escape\r\nwith life, and content himself with the slitting of his nose, and the\r\ncutting off both his ears.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff smiling upon the court, told them, that he thought the\r\npunishment, even under its present mitigation, too severe; and that\r\nsuch penalties might be of ill consequence in a trading nation. He\r\ntherefore pronounced sentence against the criminal in the following\r\nmanner: that his hat, which was the instrument of offence, should be\r\nforfeited to the court; that the criminal should go to the warehouse\r\nfrom whence he came, and thence, as occasion should require, proceed\r\nto the Exchange, or Garraway's Coffee-house, in what manner he\r\npleased; but that neither he nor any of the family of the Plumbs should\r\nhereafter appear in the streets of London out of their coaches, that so\r\nthe footway might be left open and undisturbed for their betters.\r\n\r\nDathan, a peddling Jew, and T.R., a Welshman, were indicted by the\r\nkeeper of an alehouse in Westminster, for breaking the peace and two\r\nearthen mugs, in a dispute about the antiquity of their families,\r\nto the great detriment of the house, and disturbance of the whole\r\nneighbourhood. Dathan said for himself, that he was provoked to it by\r\nthe Welshman, who pretended that the Welsh were an ancienter people\r\nthan the Jews; \"whereas,\" says he, \"I can show by this genealogy in my\r\nhand, that I am the son of Meshec, that was the son of Naboth, that\r\nwas the son of Shalem, that was the son of----\" The Welshman here\r\ninterrupted him, and told him that he could produce shennalogy as well\r\nas himself; for that he was John ap Rice, ap Shenkin, ap Shones. He\r\nthen turned himself to the Censor, and told him in the same broken\r\naccent, and with much warmth, that the Jew would needs uphold that King\r\nCadwallader was younger than Issachar. Mr. Bickerstaff seemed very much\r\ninclined to give sentence against Dathan, as being a Jew, but finding\r\nreasons, by some expressions which the Welshman let fall in asserting\r\nthe antiquity of his family, to suspect that the said Welshman was a\r\nPre-Adamite,[213] he suffered the jury to go out without any previous\r\nadmonition. After some time they returned, and gave their verdict,\r\nthat it appearing the persons at the bar did neither of them wear a\r\nsword, and that consequently they had no right to quarrel upon a point\r\nof honour: to prevent such frivolous appeals for the future, they\r\nshould both of them be tossed in the same blanket, and there adjust\r\nthe superiority as they could agree it between themselves. The Censor\r\nconfirmed the verdict.\r\n\r\nRichard Newman was indicted by Major Punto, for having used the words,\r\n\"Perhaps it may be so,\" in a dispute with the said Major. The Major\r\nurged, that the word \"perhaps\" was questioning his veracity, and that\r\nit was an indirect manner of giving him the lie. Richard Newman had\r\nnothing more to say for himself, than that he intended no such thing,\r\nand threw himself upon the mercy of the court. The jury brought in\r\ntheir verdict special.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff stood up, and after having cast his eyes over the whole\r\nassembly, hem'd thrice. He then acquainted them, that he had laid\r\ndown a rule to himself, which he was resolved never to depart from,\r\nand which, as he conceived, would very much conduce to the shortening\r\nthe business of the court; \"I mean,\" says he, \"never to allow of the\r\nlie being given by construction, implication, or induction, but by\r\nthe sole use of the word itself.\" He then proceeded to show the great\r\nmischiefs that had arisen to the English nation from that pernicious\r\nmonosyllable; that it had bred the most fatal quarrels between the\r\ndearest friends; that it had frequently thinned the Guards, and made\r\ngreat havoc in the army; that it had sometimes weakened the city\r\ntrained-bands; and, in a word, had destroyed many of the bravest men in\r\nthe isle of Great Britain. For the prevention of which evils for the\r\nfuture, he instructed the jury to present the word itself as a nuisance\r\nin the English tongue; and further promised them, that he would, upon\r\nsuch their presentment, publish an edict of the court for the entire\r\nbanishment and exclusion of it out of the discourses and conversation\r\nof all civil societies.\r\n\r\n\"This is a true copy.--CHARLES LILLIE.\"\r\n\r\nMonday next is set apart for the trial of several female causes.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--The case of the hassock will come on between the hours of nine\r\nand ten.[214]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[210] Virgil's words are, \"Non nostrum inter vos tantas,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[211] See No 253.\r\n\r\n[212] Forster observed that Mr. Thomas Gules is the forerunner of Will\r\nWimble, of the _Spectator_.\r\n\r\n[213] See vol. ii. p. 150.\r\n\r\n[214] See No. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           =No. 257.=                   [ADDISON and STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Tuesday, Nov. 28_, to _Thursday, Nov. 30, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas\r\n    Corpora: Di, cœptis (nam vos mutastis) et illac\r\n    Aspirate meis.----\r\n\r\n                                                        OVID, Met. i. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Nov. 29._\r\n\r\nEvery nation is distinguished by productions that are peculiar to it.\r\nGreat Britain is particularly fruitful in religions, that shoot up\r\nand flourish in this climate more than in any other. We are so famous\r\nabroad for our great variety of sects and opinions, that an ingenious\r\nfriend of mine, who is lately returned from his travels, assures\r\nme, there is a show at this time carried up and down in Germany,\r\nwhich represents all the religions of Great Britain in waxwork.\r\nNotwithstanding that the pliancy of the matter in which the images are\r\nwrought makes it capable of being moulded into all shapes and figures,\r\nmy friend tells me, that he did not think it possible for it to be\r\ntwisted and tortured into so many screwed faces and wry features as\r\nappeared in several of the figures that composed the show. I was indeed\r\nso pleased with the design of the German artist, that I begged my\r\nfriend to give me an account of it in all its particulars, which he did\r\nafter the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"I have often,\" says he, \"been present at a show of elephants, camels,\r\ndromedaries, and other strange creatures, but I never saw so great an\r\nassembly of spectators as were met together at the opening of this\r\ngreat piece of waxwork. We were all placed in a large hall, according\r\nto the price that we had paid for our seats. The curtain that hung\r\nbefore the show was made by a master of tapestry, who had woven it\r\nin the figure of a monstrous hydra that had several heads, which\r\nbrandished out their tongues, and seemed to hiss at each other. Some\r\nof these heads were large and entire; and where any of them had been\r\nlopped away, there sprouted up several in the room of them; insomuch\r\nthat for one head cut off, a man might see ten, twenty, or a hundred\r\nof a smaller size, creeping through the wound. In short, the whole\r\npicture was nothing but confusion and bloodshed. On a sudden,\" says my\r\nfriend, \"I was startled with a flourish of many musical instruments\r\nthat I had never heard before, which was followed by a short tune\r\n(if it might be so called), wholly made up of jars and discords.\r\nAmong the rest, there was an organ, a bagpipe, a groaning-board,[215]\r\na stentorophonic-trumpet, with several wind instruments of a most\r\ndisagreeable sound, which I do not so much as know the name of. After\r\na short flourish, the curtain was drawn up, and we were presented with\r\nthe most extraordinary assembly of figures that ever entered into a\r\nman's imagination. The design of the workman was so well expressed in\r\nthe dumb show before us, that it was not hard for an Englishman to\r\ncomprehend the meaning of it.\r\n\r\n\"The principal figures were placed in a row, consisting of seven\r\npersons. The middle figure, which immediately attracted the eyes of\r\nthe whole company, and was much bigger than the rest, was formed like\r\na matron, dressed in the habit of an elderly woman of quality in Queen\r\nElizabeth's days. The most remarkable parts of her dress was the beaver\r\nwith the steeple crown, the scarf that was darker than sable, and the\r\nlawn apron that was whiter than ermine. Her gown was of the richest\r\nblack velvet, and just upon her heart studded with large diamonds of\r\nan inestimable value, disposed in the form of a cross. She bore an\r\ninexpressible cheerfulness and dignity in her aspect; and though she\r\nseemed in years, appeared with so much spirit and vivacity, as gave\r\nher at the same time an air of old age and immortality. I found my\r\nheart touched with so much love and reverence at the sight of her, that\r\nthe tears ran down my face as I looked upon her; and still the more\r\nI looked upon her, the more my heart was melted with the sentiments\r\nof filial tenderness and duty. I discovered every moment something\r\nso charming in this figure, that I could scarce take my eyes off it.\r\nOn its right hand there sat the figure of a woman so covered with\r\nornaments, that her face, her body, and her hands were almost entirely\r\nhid under them. The little you could see of her face was painted; and\r\nwhat I thought very odd, had something in it like artificial wrinkles;\r\nbut I was the less surprised at it when I saw upon her forehead an\r\nold-fashioned tower of grey hairs. Her head-dress rose very high by\r\nthree several storeys or degrees; her garments had a thousand colours\r\nin them, and were embroidered with crosses in gold, silver and silk:\r\nshe had nothing on, so much as a glove or a slipper, which was not\r\nmarked with this figure; nay, so superstitiously fond did she appear\r\nof it, that she sat cross-legged. I was quickly sick of this tawdry\r\ncomposition of ribands, silks, and jewels, and therefore cast my eye\r\non a dame which was just the reverse of it. I need not tell my reader,\r\nthat the lady before described was Popery, or that she I am now going\r\nto describe is Presbytery. She sat on the left hand of the venerable\r\nmatron, and so much resembled her in the features of her countenance,\r\nthat she seemed her sister; but at the same time that one observed a\r\nlikeness in her beauty, one could not but take notice, that there was\r\nsomething in it sickly and splenetic. Her face had enough to discover\r\nthe relation, but it was drawn up into a peevish figure, soured with\r\ndiscontent, and overcast with melancholy. She seemed offended at the\r\nmatron for the shape of her hat, as too much resembling the triple\r\ncoronet of the person who sat by her. One might see likewise, that she\r\ndissented from the white apron and the cross; for which reasons she had\r\nmade herself a plain, homely dowdy, and turned her face towards the\r\nsectaries that sat on her left hand, as being afraid of looking upon\r\nthe matron, lest she should see the harlot by her.\r\n\r\n\"On the right hand of Popery sat Judaism, represented by an old man\r\nembroidered with phylacteries, and distinguished by many typical\r\nfigures, which I had not skill enough to unriddle. He was placed among\r\nthe rubbish of a temple; but instead of weeping over it (which I\r\nshould have expected from him), he was counting out a bag of money upon\r\nthe ruins of it.\r\n\r\n\"On his right hand was Deism, or natural religion. This was a figure\r\nof a half-naked, awkward country wench, who with proper ornaments and\r\neducation would have made an agreeable and beautiful appearance; but\r\nfor want of those advantages, was such a spectacle as a man would blush\r\nto look upon.\r\n\r\n\"I have now,\" continued my friend, \"given you an account of those who\r\nwere placed on the right hand of the matron, and who, according to the\r\norder in which they sat, were Deism, Judaism, and Popery. On the left\r\nhand, as I told you, appeared Presbytery. The next to her was a figure\r\nwhich somewhat puzzled me: it was that of a man looking, with horror in\r\nhis eyes, upon a silver basin filled with water. Observing something\r\nin his countenance that looked like lunacy, I fancied at first that\r\nhe was to express that kind of distraction which the physicians call\r\nthe hydrophobia; but considering what the intention of the show was, I\r\nimmediately recollected myself, and concluded it to be Anabaptism.\r\n\r\n\"The next figure was a man that sat under a most profound composure of\r\nmind: he wore a hat whose brims were exactly parallel with the horizon:\r\nhis garment had neither sleeve nor skirt, nor so much as a superfluous\r\nbutton. What they called his cravat, was a little piece of white linen\r\nquilled with great exactness, and hanging below his chin about two\r\ninches. Seeing a book in his hand, I asked our artist what it was, who\r\ntold me it was the Quaker's religion; upon which I desired a sight of\r\nit. Upon perusal, I found it to be nothing but a new-fashioned grammar,\r\nor an art of abridging ordinary discourse. The nouns were reduced to a\r\nvery small number, as the 'light,' 'friend,' 'Babylon.' The principal\r\nof his pronouns was 'thou'; and as for 'you,' 'ye,' and 'yours,' I\r\nfound they were not looked upon as parts of speech in this grammar. All\r\nthe verbs wanted the second person plural; the participles ended all in\r\n'ing' or 'ed,' which were marked with a particular accent. There were\r\nno adverbs besides 'yea' and 'nay.' The same thrift was observed in\r\nthe prepositions. The conjunctions were only 'hem!' and 'ha!' and the\r\ninterjections brought under the three heads of 'sighing,' 'sobbing,'\r\nand 'groaning.'\r\n\r\n\"There was at the end of the grammar a little nomenclature, called 'The\r\nChristian Man's Vocabulary,' which gave new appellations, or (if you\r\nwill) Christian names, to almost everything in life. I replaced the\r\nbook in the hand of the figure, not without admiring the simplicity of\r\nits garb, speech, and behaviour.\r\n\r\n\"Just opposite to this row of religions, there was a statue dressed in\r\na fool's coat, with a cap of bells upon his head, laughing and pointing\r\nat the figures that stood before him. This idiot is supposed to say in\r\nhis heart what David's fool did some thousands of years ago, and was\r\ntherefore designed as a proper representative of those among us who are\r\ncalled atheists and infidels by others, and free-thinkers by themselves.\r\n\r\n\"There were many other groups of figures which I did not know the\r\nmeaning of; but seeing a collection of both sexes turning their backs\r\nupon the company, and laying their heads very close together, I\r\ninquired after their religion, and found that they called themselves\r\nthe Philadelphians, or the Family of Love.\r\n\r\n\"In the opposite corner there sat another little congregation of\r\nstrange figures, opening their mouths as wide as they could gape, and\r\ndistinguished by the title of the Sweet Singers of Israel.\r\n\r\n\"I must not omit, that in this assembly of wax there were several\r\npieces that moved by clockwork, and gave great satisfaction to the\r\nspectators. Behind the matron there stood one of these figures, and\r\nbehind Popery another, which, as the artist told us, were each of them\r\nthe genius of the person they attended. That behind Popery represented\r\nPersecution, and the other Moderation. The first of these moved by\r\nsecret springs towards a great heap of dead bodies that lay piled\r\nupon one another at a considerable distance behind the principal\r\nfigures. There were written on the foreheads of these dead men\r\nseveral hard words, as 'Pre-Adamites, 'Sabbatarians,' 'Cameronians,'\r\n'Muggletonians,' 'Brownists,' 'Independents,' 'Masonites,' 'Camisards,'\r\nand the like. At the approach of Persecution, it was so contrived, that\r\nas she held up her bloody flag, the whole assembly of dead men, like\r\nthose in the 'Rehearsal,'[216] started up and drew their swords. This\r\nwas followed by great clashings and noise, when, in the midst of the\r\ntumult, the figure of Moderation moved gently towards this new army,\r\nwhich upon her holding up a paper in her hand, inscribed, 'Liberty of\r\nConscience,' immediately fell into a heap of carcasses, remaining in\r\nthe same quiet posture that they lay at first.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[215] \"At the sign of the Woolsack in Newgate Market, is to be seen\r\na strange and wonderful thing, which is, an elm-board; being touched\r\nwith a hot iron, it doth express itself as if it were a man dying with\r\ngroans and trembling, to the great admiration of all hearers. It hath\r\nbeen presented before the King and his nobles, and hath given great\r\nsatisfaction\" (Advertisement of 1682, in Sloane MSS., 958).\r\n\r\n[216] In act ii. sc. 5, Bayes says, \"Now here's an odd surprise: all\r\nthese dead men you shall see rise up presently, at a certain note that\r\nI have made, in effaut flat, and fall a-dancing.

I was surprised at\r\nall this civility, and knew not to what I might ascribe it, except to\r\nmy bright beaver and shining scarf that were new that day. But I was\r\nstill more astonished to find such an agreeable change at the table:\r\nmy lord helped me to a fat slice of venison with his own hand, and my\r\nlady did me the honour to drink to me. I offered to rise at my usual\r\ntime, but was desired to sit still, with this kind expression, 'Come,\r\ndoctor, a jelly or a conserve will do you no harm; don't be afraid of\r\nthe dessert.' I was so confounded with the favour, that I returned my\r\nthanks in a most awkward manner, wondering what was the meaning of this\r\ntotal transformation: but my lord soon put an end to my admiration,\r\nby showing me a paper that challenged you, sir, for its author, and\r\nrallied me very agreeably on the subject, asking me, which was best\r\nhandled, the lord or his chaplain?

The prosecutor deposed, that as she stood up to make\r\na curtsey to a person of quality in a neighbouring pew, the criminal\r\nconveyed away the hassock by stealth, insomuch that the prosecutor\r\nwas obliged to sit all the while she was at church, or to say her\r\nprayers in a posture that did not become a woman of her quality. The\r\nprisoner pleaded inadvertency; and the jury were going to bring it in\r\nchance-medley, had not several witnesses been produced against the said\r\nElizabeth Makebate, that she was an old offender, and a woman of a bad\r\nreputation. It appeared in particular, that on the Sunday before she\r\nhad detracted from a new petticoat of Mrs. Mary Doelittle, having said\r\nin the hearing of several credible witnesses, that the said petticoat\r\nwas scoured,[226] to the great grief and detriment of the said Mary\r\nDoelittle. There were likewise many evidences produced against the\r\ncriminal, that though she never failed to come to church on Sunday,\r\nshe was a most notorious Sabbath-breaker, and that she spent her whole\r\ntime, during divine service, in disparaging other people's clothes, and\r\nwhispering to those who sat next her. Upon the whole, she was found\r\nguilty of the indictment, and received sentence to ask pardon of the\r\nprosecutor upon her bare knees, without either cushion or hassock under\r\nher, in the face of the court.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--As soon as the sentence was executed on the criminal, which\r\nwas done in open court with the utmost severity, the first lady of the\r\nbench on Mr. Bickerstaff's right hand stood up, and made a motion to\r\nthe court, that whereas it was impossible for women of fashion to dress\r\nthemselves before the church was half done, and whereas many confusions\r\nand inconveniences did arise thereupon, it might be lawful for them to\r\nsend a footman, in order to keep their places, as was usual in other\r\npolite and well-regulated assemblies.[227] The motion was ordered to\r\nbe entered in the books, and considered at a more convenient time.\r\n\r\nCharles Cambric, linen-draper, in the city of Westminster, was indicted\r\nfor speaking obscenely to the Lady Penelope Touchwood. It appeared,\r\nthat the prosecutor and her woman going in a stage-coach from London\r\nto Brentford, where they were to be met by the lady's own chariot, the\r\ncriminal and another of his acquaintance travelled with them in the\r\nsame coach, at which time the prisoner talked bawdy for the space of\r\nthree miles and a half. The prosecutor alleged that over against the\r\nOld Fox at Knightsbridge he mentioned the word \"linen\"; that at the\r\nfarther end of Kensington he made use of the term \"smock\"; and that\r\nbefore he came to Hammersmith, he talked almost a quarter of an hour\r\nupon wedding-shifts. The prosecutor's woman confirmed what her lady\r\nhad said, and added further, that she had never seen her lady in so\r\ngreat a confusion, and in such a taking, as she was during the whole\r\ndiscourse of the criminal. The prisoner had little to say for himself,\r\nbut that he talked only in his own trade, and meant no hurt by what he\r\nsaid. The jury, however, found him guilty, and represented by their\r\nforewoman, that such discourses were apt to sully the imagination, and\r\nthat by a concatenation of ideas, the word \"linen\" implied many things\r\nthat were not proper to be stirred up in the mind of a woman who was\r\nof the prosecutor's quality, and therefore gave it as their verdict,\r\nthat the linen-draper should lose his tongue. Mr. Bickerstaff said, he\r\nthought the prosecutor's ears were as much to blame as the prisoner's\r\ntongue, and therefore gave sentence as follows: that they should both\r\nbe placed over against one another in the middle of the court, there\r\nto remain for the space of one quarter of an hour, during which time\r\nthe linen-draper was to be gagged, and the lady to hold her hands close\r\nupon both her ears, which was executed accordingly.\r\n\r\nEdward Callicot was indicted as an accomplice to Charles Cambric,\r\nfor that he, the said Edward Callicot, did, by his silence and his\r\nsmiles, seem to approve and abet the said Charles Cambric in everything\r\nhe said. It appeared, that the prisoner was foreman of the shop to\r\nthe aforesaid Charles Cambric, and by his post obliged to smile at\r\neverything that the other should be pleased to say: upon which he was\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nJosias Shallow was indicted in the name of Dame Winifred, sole relict\r\nof Richard Dainty, Esq., for having said several times in company,\r\nand in the hearing of several persons there present, that he was\r\nextremely obliged to the widow Dainty, and that he should never be\r\nable sufficiently to express his gratitude. The prosecutor urged that\r\nthis might blast her reputation, and that it was in effect a boasting\r\nof favours which he had never received. The prisoner seemed to be much\r\nastonished at the construction which was put upon his words, and said\r\nthat he meant nothing by them, but that the widow had befriended him\r\nin a lease, and was very kind to his younger sister. The jury finding\r\nhim a little weak in his understanding, without going out of the court,\r\nbrought in their verdict Ignoramus.\r\n\r\nUrsula Goodenough was accused by the Lady Betty Wouldbe, for having\r\nsaid that she, the Lady Betty Wouldbe, was painted. The prisoner\r\nbrought several persons of good credit to witness to her reputation,\r\nand proved by undeniable evidences, that she was never at the place\r\nwhere the words were said to have been uttered. The Censor observing\r\nthe behaviour of the prosecutor, found reason to believe that she had\r\nindicted the prisoner for no other reason but to make her complexion\r\nbe taken notice of, which indeed was very fresh and beautiful: he\r\ntherefore asked the offender with a very stern voice, how she could\r\npresume to spread so groundless a report? and whether she saw any\r\ncolours in the Lady Wouldbe's face that could procure credit to such a\r\nfalsehood? \"Do you see,\" says he, \"any lilies or roses in her cheeks,\r\nany bloom, any probability----\" The prosecutor, not able to bear such\r\nlanguage any longer, told him, that he talked like a blind old fool,\r\nand that she was ashamed to have entertained any opinion of his wisdom:\r\nbut she was soon put to silence, and sentenced to wear her mask for\r\nfive months, and not to presume to show her face till the town should\r\nbe empty.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Buzzard, Esq., was indicted for having told the Lady Everbloom\r\nat a public ball, that she looked very well for a woman of her years.\r\nThe prisoner not denying the fact, and persisting before the court that\r\nhe looked upon it as a compliment, the jury brought him in _non compos\r\nmentis_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe court then adjourned to Monday the 11th instant.\r\n\r\n\"_Copia vera._--CHARLES LILLIE.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[224] See Nos. 253, 256.\r\n\r\n[225] A makebate is breeder of quarrels.

These gentlemen were\r\nformerly marked out and distinguished by the little rhinocerical\r\nnose, which was always looked upon as an instrument of derision, and\r\nwhich they were used to cock, toss, or draw up in a contemptuous\r\nmanner, upon reading the works of their ingenious contemporaries. It\r\nis not therefore for this generation of men that I write the present\r\ntransaction:\r\n\r\n          _----Minus aptus acutis\r\n    Naribus horum hominum----_\r\n\r\nbut for the sake of some of my philosophical friends in the Royal\r\nSociety, who peruse discourses of this nature with a becoming gravity,\r\nand a desire of improving by them.\r\n\r\nMany are the opinions of learned men concerning the rise of that fatal\r\ndistemper which has always taken a particular pleasure in venting its\r\nspite upon the nose. I have seen a little burlesque poem in Italian\r\nthat gives a very pleasant account of this matter. The fable of it runs\r\nthus: Mars, the god of war, having served during the siege of Naples in\r\nthe shape of a French colonel, received a visit one night from Venus,\r\nthe goddess of love, who had been always his professed mistress and\r\nadmirer. The poem says, she came to him in the disguise of a sutling\r\nwench, with a bottle of brandy under her arm. Let that be as it will,\r\nhe managed matters so well, that she went away big-bellied, and was at\r\nlength brought to bed of a little Cupid. This boy, whether it were by\r\nreason of any bad food that his father had eaten during the siege, or\r\nof any particular malignity in the stars that reigned at his nativity,\r\ncame into the world with a very sickly look and crazy constitution.\r\nAs soon as he was able to handle his bow, he made discoveries of a\r\nmost perverse disposition. He dipped all his arrows in poison, that\r\nrotted everything they touched; and what was more particular, aimed\r\nall his shafts at the nose, quite contrary to the practice of his\r\nelder brothers, who had made a human heart their butt in all countries\r\nand ages. To break him of this roguish trick, his parents put him to\r\nschool to Mercury, who did all he could to hinder him from demolishing\r\nthe noses of mankind; but in spite of education the boy continued\r\nvery unlucky; and though his malice was a little softened by good\r\ninstructions, he would very frequently let fly an envenomed arrow, and\r\nwound his votaries oftener in the nose than in the heart. Thus far the\r\nfable.\r\n\r\nI need not tell my learned reader that Correggio has drawn a Cupid\r\ntaking his lesson from Mercury, conformable to this poem; nor that the\r\npoem itself was designed as a burlesque upon Fracastorius.[234]\r\n\r\nIt was a little after this fatal siege of Naples that Talicotius[235]\r\nbegan to practise in a town of Germany. He was the first clap doctor\r\nthat I meet with in history, and a greater man in his age than our\r\ncelebrated Dr. Wall.[236] He saw this species extremely mutilated and\r\ndisfigured by this new distemper that was crept into it; and therefore,\r\nin pursuance of a very seasonable invention, set up a manufacture of\r\nnoses, having first got a patent that none should presume to make\r\nnoses besides himself. His first patient was a great man of Portugal,\r\nwho had done good services to his country, but in the midst of them\r\nunfortunately lost his nose. Talicotius grafted a new one on the\r\nremaining part of the gristle or cartilaginous substance, which would\r\nsneeze, smell, take snuff, pronounce the letters _m_ or _n_, and, in\r\nshort, do all the functions of a genuine and natural nose. There was,\r\nhowever, one misfortune in this experiment. The Portuguese's complexion\r\nwas a little upon the subfusk, with very black eyes and dark eyebrows,\r\nand the nose being taken from a porter that had a white German skin,\r\nand cut out of those parts that are not exposed to the sun, it was very\r\nvisible that the features of his face were not fellows. In a word, the\r\nComdè resembled one of those maimed antique statues that has often a\r\nmodern nose of fresh marble glued to a face of such a yellow ivory\r\ncomplexion as nothing can give but age. To remedy this particular for\r\nthe future, the doctor got together a great collection of porters, men\r\nof all complexions, black, brown, fair, dark, sallow, pale, and ruddy;\r\nso that it was impossible for a patient of the most out-of-the-way\r\ncolour not to find a nose to match it.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's house was now very much enlarged, and became a kind of\r\ncollege, or rather hospital, for the fashionable cripples of both\r\nsexes that resorted to him from all parts of Europe. Over his door was\r\nfastened a large golden snout, not unlike that which is placed over\r\nthe great gates at Brasenose College, in Oxford; and as it is usual for\r\nthe learned in foreign universities to distinguish their houses by a\r\nLatin sentence, the doctor writ underneath this great golden proboscis\r\ntwo verses out of Ovid:\r\n\r\n    _Militat omnis amans, habet et sua castra Cupido,\r\n      Pontice, crede mihi, militat omnis amans._[237]\r\n\r\nIt is reported, that Talicotius had at one time in his house twelve\r\nGerman counts, nineteen French marquises, and a hundred Spanish\r\ncavaliers, besides one solitary English esquire, of whom more\r\nhereafter. Though the doctor had the monopoly of noses in his own\r\nhands, he is said not to have been unreasonable. Indeed, if a man\r\nhad occasion for a high Roman nose, he must go to the price of it. A\r\ncarbuncle nose likewise bore an excessive rate: but for your ordinary\r\nshort turned-up noses, of which there was the greatest consumption,\r\nthey cost little or nothing; at least the purchasers thought so, who\r\nwould have been content to have paid much dearer for them, rather than\r\nto have gone without them.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy betwixt the nose and its parent was very extraordinary.\r\n\"Hudibras\" has told us, that when the porter died, the nose dropped\r\nof course, in which case it was always usual to return the nose, in\r\norder to have it interred with its first owner. The nose was likewise\r\naffected by the pain as well as death of the original proprietor. An\r\neminent instance of this nature happened to three Spaniards whose noses\r\nwere all made out of the same piece of brawn. They found them one\r\nday shoot and swell extremely, upon which they sent to know how the\r\nporter did, and heard upon inquiry, that the parent of the noses had\r\nbeen severely kicked the day before, and that the porter kept his bed\r\non account of the bruises it had received. This was highly resented by\r\nthe Spaniards, who found out the person that had used the porter so\r\nunmercifully, and treated him in the same manner as if the indignity\r\nhad been done to their own noses. In this and several other cases it\r\nmight be said, that the porters led the gentlemen by the nose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if anything went amiss with the nose, the porter\r\nfelt the effects of it, insomuch that it was generally articled with\r\nthe patient, that he should not only abstain from all his old courses,\r\nbut should on no pretence whatever smell pepper, or eat mustard; on\r\nwhich occasion, the part where the incision had been made was seized\r\nwith unspeakable twinges and prickings.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman I before mentioned was so very irregular, and relapsed\r\nso frequently into the distemper which at first brought him to the\r\nlearned Talicotius, that in the space of two years he wore out five\r\nnoses, and by that means so tormented the porters, that if he would\r\nhave given £500 for a nose, there was not one of them that would\r\naccommodate him. This young gentleman was born of honest parents, and\r\npassed his first years in fox-hunting; but accidentally quitting the\r\nwoods, and coming up to London, he was so charmed with the beauties of\r\nthe play-house, that he had not been in town two days before he got\r\nthe misfortune which carried off this part of his face. He used to be\r\ncalled in Germany, the Englishman of five noses, and, the gentleman\r\nthat had thrice as many noses as he had ears: such was the raillery of\r\nthose times.\r\n\r\nI shall close this paper with an admonition to the young men of\r\nthis town, which I think the more necessary, because I see several\r\nnew fresh-coloured faces, that have made their first appearance in\r\nit this winter. I must therefore assure them, that the art of making\r\nnoses is entirely lost; and in the next place, beg them not to follow\r\nthe example of our ordinary town rakes, who live as if there was a\r\nTalicotius to be met with at the corner of every street. Whatever young\r\nmen may think, the nose is a very becoming part of the face, and a\r\nman makes but a very silly figure without it. But it is the nature of\r\nyouth not to know the value of anything till they have lost it. The\r\ngeneral precept, therefore, I shall leave with them is, to regard every\r\ntown-woman as a particular kind of siren, that has a design upon their\r\nnoses; and that, amidst her flatteries and allurements, they will fancy\r\nshe speaks to them in that humorous phrase of old Plautus:\r\n\r\n               _Ego tibi faciem denasabo mordicus._[238]\r\n\r\n      \"Keep your face out of my way, or I'll bite off your nose.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[228] Book ii. chap. xxvi.\r\n\r\n[229] Swift's \"Tale of a Tub,\" sect. xi.\r\n\r\n[230] \"You are mistaken in your guesses about _Tatlers_; I did neither\r\nwrite that on noses nor religion [No. 257], nor do I send him of late\r\nany hints at all\" (Swift's \"Journal,\" Jan. 1, 1711).\r\n\r\n[231] Notch or nick.\r\n\r\n[232] \"Hudibras,\" Part i. canto i. 281.

From this observation, and many other which occur to me\r\nwhen I am numbering the good people of Great Britain, I cannot but\r\nfavour any proposal which tends to repairing the losses we sustain\r\nby eminent cures. The best I have met with in this kind, has been\r\noffered to my consideration, and recommended by a letter, subscribed\r\nThomas Clement.[239] The title to his printed articles runs thus:\r\n\"By the Profitable Society at the Wheat Sheaf, over against Tom's\r\nCoffee-house, in Russell Street, Covent Garden, new proposals for\r\npromoting a contribution towards raising two hundred and fifty pounds\r\nto be made on the baptizing of any infant born in wedlock.\" The plan\r\nis laid with such proper regulations, as serves (to such as fall in\r\nwith it for the sake of their posterity) all the uses, without any of\r\nthe inconveniences of settlements. By this means, such whose fortunes\r\ndepend upon their own industry, or personal qualifications, need\r\nnot be deterred by fear of poverty from that state which nature and\r\nreason prescribe to us as the fountain of the greatest happiness in\r\nhuman life. The censors of Rome had power vested in them to lay taxes\r\non the unmarried; and I think I cannot show my impartiality better\r\nthan in inquiring into the extravagant privileges my brother bachelors\r\nenjoy, and fine them accordingly. I shall not allow a single life in\r\none sex to be reproached, and held in esteem in the other. It would\r\nnot, methinks, be amiss, if an old bachelor, who lives in contempt of\r\nmatrimony, were obliged to give a portion to an old maid who is willing\r\nto enter into it. At the same time I must allow, that those who can\r\nplead courtship, and were unjustly rejected, shall not be liable to the\r\npains and penalties of celibacy. But such as pretend an aversion to\r\nthe whole sex, because they were ill-treated by a particular female,\r\nand cover their sense of disappointment in women under a contempt of\r\ntheir favour, shall be proceeded against as bachelors convict. I am not\r\nwithout hopes, that from this slight warning, all the unmarried men of\r\nfortune, taste, and refinement, will, without further delay, become\r\nlovers and humble servants to such of their acquaintance as are most\r\nagreeable to them, under pain of my censures: and it is to be hoped,\r\nthe rest of the world, who remain single for fear of the encumbrances\r\nof wedlock, will become subscribers to Mr. Clement's proposal. By these\r\nmeans we shall have a much more numerous account of births in the year\r\n1711, than any ever before known in Great Britain, where merely to\r\nbe born is a distinction of Providence, greater than being born to a\r\nfortune in another place.\r\n\r\nAs I was going on in the consideration of this good office which Mr.\r\nClement proposes to do his country, I received the following letter,\r\nwhich seems to be dictated by a like modest and public spirit, that\r\nmakes use of me also in its design of obliging mankind:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"In the royal lottery for a million and a half, I had the good fortune\r\nof obtaining a prize. From before the drawing I had devoted a fifth of\r\nwhatever should arise to me to charitable uses. Accordingly I lately\r\ntroubled you with my request and commission for placing half-a-dozen\r\nyouths with Mr. More,[240] writing-master in Castle Street, to whom,\r\nit is said, we owe all the fine devices, flourishes, and the composure\r\nof all the plates, for the drawing and paying the tickets.

Were\r\nI at liberty to discover even all the good I know of many men living at\r\nthis time, there would want nothing but a suitable historian to make\r\nthem appear as illustrious as any of the noblest of the old Greeks or\r\nRomans. The cunning some have used to do handsome and worthy actions,\r\nthe address to do men services, and escape their notice, has produced\r\nso many surprising incidents (which have been laid before me during my\r\ncensorship), as, in the opinion of posterity, would absolve this age of\r\nall its crimes and follies. I know no way to deal with such delicate\r\nminds as these, but by assuring them, that when they cease to do good,\r\nI shall tell all the good they have done already. Let therefore the\r\nbenefactor to the youths above-mentioned continue such bounties, upon\r\npain of being publicly praised. But there is no probability of his\r\nrunning into that hazard; for a strong habit of virtue can make men\r\nsuspend the receiving acknowledgments due to their merit, till they\r\nare out of a capacity of receiving them. I am so very much charmed\r\nwith accidents of this kind, that I have made a collection of all the\r\nmemorable handsome things done by private men in my time. As a specimen\r\nof my manner of noting such actions, take the following fragment out of\r\nmuch more which is written in my Year-Book, on the remarkable will of a\r\ngentleman, whom I shall here call Celamico.\r\n\r\n\"This day died that plain and excellent man, my much honoured friend\r\nCelamico, who bequeathed his whole estate to a gentleman no way related\r\nto him, and to whom he had given no such expectation in his lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a person of a very enlarged soul, and thought the nearest\r\nrelation among men to be the resemblance of their minds and sentiments.\r\nHe was not mistaken in the worth of his successor, who received the\r\nnews of this unexpected good fortune with an air that showed him less\r\nmoved with the benefit than the loss of the benefactor.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\"Notice is hereby given, that on Monday the 11th instant, the case\r\nof the visit comes on, between the hours of ten and eleven, at the\r\nCourt of Honour; where both persons are to attend, the meeting there\r\nnot being to be understood as a visit, and the right of the next\r\nvisit being then to be wholly settled, according to the prayer of the\r\nplaintiff.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[239] See No. 258, _ad fin._ The following advertisement appeared in\r\nNo. 252 of the _Tatler_: \"Two hundred and fifty pounds to be paid\r\non the baptizing of a child, being a new proposal by the Profitable\r\nSociety; the payment of 2s. 6d. for a policy, and 2s. 6d. towards each\r\nclaim, a title to the sum above-mentioned.

The indictment added, that this\r\nproduced an unspeakable confusion in the company; for that the ladies,\r\nwho before had pressed together for a place at the upper end of the\r\ntable, immediately crowded with the same disorder towards the end that\r\nwas quite opposite; that Mrs. Frontly had the insolence to clap herself\r\ndown at the very lowest place of the table; that the Widow Partlett\r\nseated herself on the right hand of Mrs. Frontly, alleging for her\r\nexcuse, that no ceremony was to be used at a round table; that Mrs.\r\nFidget and Mrs. Fescue disputed above half-an-hour for the same chair,\r\nand that the latter would not give up the cause till it was decided by\r\nthe parish register, which happened to be kept hard by. The indictment\r\nfurther said, that the rest of the company who sat down, did it with\r\na reserve to their right, which they were at liberty to assert on\r\nanother occasion; and that Mrs. Mary Pippe, an old maid, was placed by\r\nthe unanimous vote of the whole company at the upper end of the table,\r\nfrom whence she had the confusion to behold several mothers of families\r\namong her inferiors. The criminal alleged in his defence, that what he\r\nhad done, was to raise mirth, and avoid ceremony, and that the ladies\r\ndid not complain of his rudeness till the next morning, having eaten\r\nup what he had provided for them with great readiness and alacrity.\r\nThe Censor frowning upon him told him, that he ought not to discover\r\nso much levity in matters of a serious nature, and (upon the jury's\r\nbringing him in guilty) sentenced him to treat the whole assembly of\r\nladies over again, and to take care he did it with the decorum which\r\nwas due to persons of their quality.\r\n\r\nRebecca Shapely, spinster, was indicted by Mrs. Sarah Smack, for\r\nspeaking many words reflecting upon her reputation, and the heels of\r\nher silk slippers, which the prisoner had maliciously suggested to be\r\ntwo inches higher than they really were. The prosecutor urged, as an\r\naggravation of her guilt, that the prisoner was herself guilty of the\r\nsame kind of forgery which she had laid to the prosecutor's charge,\r\nfor that she, the said Rebecca Shapely, did always wear a pair of\r\nsteel bodice, and a false rump. The Censor ordered the slippers to be\r\nproduced in open court, where the heels were adjudged to be of the\r\nstatutable size. He then ordered the grand jury to search the criminal,\r\nwho, after some time spent therein, acquitted her of the bodice, but\r\nfound her guilty of the rump; upon which she received sentence as is\r\nusual in such cases.\r\n\r\nWilliam Trippitt, Esq., of the Middle Temple, brought his action\r\nagainst the Lady Elizabeth Prudely, for having refused him her hand as\r\nhe offered to lead her to her coach from the opera. The plaintiff set\r\nforth, that he had entered himself into the list of those volunteers\r\nwho officiate every night behind the boxes as gentlemen-ushers of\r\nthe play-house; that he had been at a considerable charge in white\r\ngloves, periwigs, and snuff-boxes, in order to qualify himself for that\r\nemployment, and in hopes of making his fortune by it. The counsel for\r\nthe defendant replied, that the plaintiff had given out that he was\r\nwithin a month of wedding their client, and that she had refused her\r\nhand to him in ceremony, lest he should interpret it as a promise that\r\nshe would give it him in marriage. As soon as their pleadings on both\r\nsides were finished, the Censor ordered the plaintiff to be cashiered\r\nfrom his office of gentleman-usher to the play-house, since it was too\r\nplain that he had undertaken it with an ill design; and at the same\r\ntime ordered the defendant either to marry the said plaintiff, or to\r\npay him half-a-crown for the new pair of gloves and coach-hire that he\r\nwas at the expense of in her service.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Townly brought an action of debt against Mrs. Flambeau, for\r\nthat the said Mrs. Flambeau had not been to see the said Lady Townly,\r\nand wish her joy, since her marriage with Sir Ralph, notwithstanding\r\nshe, the said Lady Townly, had paid Mrs. Flambeau a visit upon her\r\nfirst coming to town. It was urged in the behalf of the defendant,\r\nthat the plaintiff had never given her any regular notice of her being\r\nin town; that the visit she alleged had been made on a Monday, which\r\nshe knew was a day on which Mrs. Flambeau was always abroad, having\r\nset aside that only day in the week to mind the affairs of her family;\r\nthat the servant who inquired whether she was at home did not give the\r\nvisiting knock; that it was not between the hours of five and eight\r\nin the evening; that there was no candles lighted up; that it was not\r\non Mrs. Flambeau's day; and, in short, that there was not one of the\r\nessential points observed that constitute a visit. She further proved\r\nby her porter's book, which was produced in court, that she had paid\r\nthe Lady Townly a visit on the twenty-fourth day of March,[242] just\r\nbefore her leaving the town, in the year 1709-10, for which she was\r\nstill creditor to the said Lady Townly. To this the plaintiff only\r\nreplied, that she was now under covert, and not liable to any debts\r\ncontracted when she was a single woman. Mr. Bickerstaff finding the\r\ncause to be very intricate, and that several points of honour were\r\nlikely to arise in it, he deferred giving judgment upon it till the\r\nnext session day, at which time he ordered the ladies on his left hand\r\nto present to the court a table of all the laws relating to visits.\r\n\r\nWinifred Lear brought her action against Richard Sly for having broken\r\na marriage contract, and wedded another woman, after he had engaged\r\nhimself to marry the said Winifred Lear. She alleged, that he had\r\nogled her twice at an opera, thrice in St. James's Church, and once\r\nat Powell's Puppet-Show,[243] at which time he promised her marriage\r\nby a side glance, as her friend could testify that sat by her. Mr.\r\nBickerstaff finding that the defendant had made no further overture of\r\nlove or marriage, but by looks and ocular engagement; yet at the same\r\ntime considering how very apt such impudent seducers are to lead the\r\nladies' hearts astray, ordered the criminal to stand upon the stage in\r\nthe Haymarket, between each act of the next opera, there to be exposed\r\nto public view as a false ogler.\r\n\r\nUpon the rising of the court, Mr. Bickerstaff having taken one of\r\nthese counterfeits in the very fact as he was ogling a lady of the\r\ngrand jury, ordered him to be seized, and prosecuted upon the statute\r\nof ogling. He likewise directed the clerk of the court to draw up an\r\nedict against these common cheats, that make women believe they are\r\ndistracted for them by staring them out of countenance, and often\r\nblast a lady's reputation whom they never spoke to, by saucy looks and\r\ndistant familiarities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241] See Nos. 253, 256, and 259.\r\n\r\n[242] Then the last day of the year.\r\n\r\n[243] See Nos. 44, 45, 50, 115; and _Spectator_, Nos. 14, 372. Martin\r\nPowell (sometimes called Robert) was a cripple who came to London from\r\nBath in 1710, and set up \"Punch's Theatre\" under the Piazza in Covent\r\nGarden. There he produced puppet plays, burlesquing the operas at the\r\nHaymarket. Defoe, or whoever was the author of the \"Groans of Great\r\nBritain\" (1711), lamented Powell's popularity, and said that he was\r\nrich enough to buy up all the poets of England. In 1715 Thomas Burnet\r\nwrote a satire on Robert Harley under the title of a \"History of Robert\r\nPowell the Puppet-Showman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =No. 263.=             [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Dec. 12_, to _Thursday, Dec. 14, 1710_.\r\n\r\n                 ----Minimâ contentos nocte Britannos.\r\n\r\n                                                      JUV., Sat ii. 161.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment Dec. 13._\r\n\r\nAn old friend of mine being lately come to town, I went to see him\r\non Tuesday last about eight o'clock in the evening, with a design\r\nto sit with him an hour or two and talk over old stories; but upon\r\ninquiring after him, his servant told me he was just gone to bed. The\r\nnext morning, as soon as I was up and dressed, and had despatched\r\na little business, I came again to my friend's house about eleven\r\no'clock, with a design to renew my visit; but upon asking for him,\r\nhis servant told me he was just sat down to dinner. In short, I found\r\nthat my old-fashioned friend religiously adhered to the example of his\r\nforefathers, and observed the same hours that had been kept in the\r\nfamily ever since the Conquest.[244]\r\n\r\nIt is very plain that the night was much longer formerly in this\r\nisland than it is at present. By the night I mean that portion of time\r\nwhich nature has thrown into darkness, and which the wisdom of mankind\r\nhad formerly dedicated to rest and silence. This used to begin at eight\r\no'clock in the evening, and conclude at six in the morning. The curfew,\r\nor eight o'clock bell, was the signal throughout the nation for putting\r\nout their candles and going to bed.\r\n\r\nOur grandmothers, though they were wont to sit up the last in the\r\nfamily, were all of them fast asleep at the same hours that their\r\ndaughters are busy at crimp and basset.[245] Modern statesmen are\r\nconcerting schemes, and engaged in the depth of politics, at the time\r\nwhen their forefathers were laid down quietly to rest, and had nothing\r\nin their heads but dreams. As we have thus thrown business and pleasure\r\ninto the hours of rest, and by that means made the natural night but\r\nhalf as long as it should be, we are forced to piece it out with a\r\ngreat part of the morning; so that near two-thirds of the nation lie\r\nfast asleep for several hours in broad daylight. This irregularity\r\nis grown so very fashionable at present, that there is scarce a lady\r\nof quality in Great Britain that ever saw the sun rise. And if the\r\nhumour increases in proportion to what it has done of late years, it\r\nis not impossible but our children may hear the bellman going about\r\nthe streets at nine o'clock in the morning, and the watch making\r\ntheir rounds till eleven. This unaccountable disposition in mankind\r\nto continue awake in the night, and sleep in sunshine, has made me\r\ninquire, whether the same change of inclination has happened to any\r\nother animals? For this reason I desired a friend of mine in the\r\ncountry to let me know, whether the lark rises as early as he did\r\nformerly? and whether the cock begins to crow at his usual hour? My\r\nfriend has answered me, that his poultry are as regular as ever, and\r\nthat all the birds and the beasts of his neighbourhood keep the same\r\nhours that they have observed in the memory of man; and the same which,\r\nin all probability, they have kept for these five thousand years.\r\n\r\nIf you would see the innovations that have been made among us in this\r\nparticular, you may only look into the hours of colleges, where they\r\nstill dine at eleven, and sup at six, which were doubtless the hours\r\nof the whole nation at the time when those places were founded. But at\r\npresent the courts of justice are scarce opened in Westminster Hall at\r\nthe time when William Rufus used to go to dinner in it. All business is\r\ndriven forward: the landmarks of our fathers (if I may so call them)\r\nare removed, and planted further up into the day; insomuch that I am\r\nafraid our clergy will be obliged (if they expect full congregations)\r\nnot to look any more upon ten o'clock in the morning as a canonical\r\nhour. In my own memory the dinner has crept by degrees from twelve\r\no'clock to three, and where it will fix nobody knows.[246]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought to draw up a memorial in the behalf of supper\r\nagainst dinner, setting forth, that the said dinner has made several\r\nencroachments upon the said supper, and entered very far upon his\r\nfrontiers; that he has banished him out of several families, and in\r\nall has driven him from his headquarters, and forced him to make his\r\nretreat into the hours of midnight; and in short, that he is now in\r\ndanger of being entirely confounded and lost in a breakfast. Those who\r\nhave read Lucian, and seen the complaints of the letter \"t\" against \"s\"\r\nupon account of many injuries and usurpations of the same nature,[247]\r\nwill not, I believe, think such a memorial forced and unnatural. If\r\ndinner has been thus postponed, or (if you please) kept back from\r\ntime to time, you may be sure that it has been in compliance with\r\nthe other business of the day, and that supper has still observed a\r\nproportionable distance. There is a venerable proverb, which we have\r\nall of us heard in our infancy, of \"putting the children to bed, and\r\nlaying the goose to the fire.\" This was one of the jocular sayings\r\nof our forefathers, but may be properly used in the literal sense at\r\npresent. Who would not wonder at this perverted relish of those who are\r\nreckoned the most polite part of mankind, that prefer sea-coals[248]\r\nand candles to the sun, and exchange so many cheerful morning hours\r\nfor the pleasures of midnight revels and debauches? If a man was only\r\nto consult his health, he would choose to live his whole time (if\r\npossible) in daylight, and to retire out of the world into silence and\r\nsleep, while the raw damps and unwholesome vapours fly abroad without a\r\nsun to disperse, moderate, or control them. For my own part, I value\r\nan hour in the morning as much as common libertines do an hour at\r\nmidnight. When I find myself awakened into being, and perceive my life\r\nrenewed within me, and at the same time see the whole face of nature\r\nrecovered out of the dark uncomfortable state in which it lay for\r\nseveral hours, my heart overflows with such secret sentiments of joy\r\nand gratitude as are a kind of implicit[249] praise to the great Author\r\nof Nature. The mind in these early seasons of the day is so refreshed\r\nin all its faculties, and borne up with such new supplies of animal\r\nspirits, that she finds herself in a state of youth, especially when\r\nshe is entertained with the breath of flowers, the melody of birds, the\r\ndews that hang upon the plants, and all those other sweets of nature\r\nthat are peculiar to the morning.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a man to have this relish of being, this exquisite\r\ntaste of life, who does not come into the world before it is in all its\r\nnoise and hurry; who loses the rising of the sun, the still hours of\r\nthe day, and immediately upon his first getting up plunges himself into\r\nthe ordinary cares or follies of the world.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this paper with Milton's inimitable description of\r\nAdam's awakening his Eve in Paradise, which indeed would have been a\r\nplace as little delightful as a barren heath or desert to those who\r\nslept in it. The fondness of the posture in which Adam is represented,\r\nand the softness of his whisper, are passages in this divine poem that\r\nare above all commendation, and rather to be admired than praised.\r\n\r\n    _Now morn, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime\r\n    Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,\r\n    When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep\r\n    Was airy-light from pure digestion bred,\r\n    And temperate vapours bland, which th' only sound\r\n    Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan\r\n    Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song\r\n    Of birds on every bough; so much the more\r\n    His wonder was to find unwakened Eve,\r\n    With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,\r\n    As through unquiet rest: he on his side\r\n    Leaning half-raised, with looks of cordial love\r\n    Hung over her enamoured, and beheld\r\n    Beauty, which whether waking or asleep,\r\n    Shot forth peculiar graces. Then with voice\r\n    Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,\r\n    Her hand soft touching, whispered thus: \"Awake,\r\n    My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,\r\n    Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight;\r\n    Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field\r\n    Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring\r\n    Our tended plants, how blows the citron grove,\r\n    What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,\r\n    How Nature paints her colours, how the bee\r\n    Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.\"\r\n      Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye\r\n    On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake:\r\n      \"O soul! in whom my thoughts find all repose,\r\n    My glory, my perfection, glad I see\r\n    Thy face, and morn returned.\"_----[250]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[244] _Cf._ Pope's \"Epistle to Miss Blount, on her leaving the Town\r\nafter the Coronation\" (1715):\r\n\r\n    \"She went to plain-work, and to purling brooks,\r\n    Old-fashioned halls, dull aunts, and croaking rooks:\r\n    She went from opera, park, assembly, play,\r\n    To morning walks, and prayers three hours a day;\r\n    To part her time 'twixt reading and bohea,\r\n    To muse, and spill her solitary tea;\r\n    Or o'er cold coffee trifle with the spoon,\r\n    Count the slow clock, and dine exact at noon;\r\n    Divert her eyes with pictures in the fire,\r\n    Hum half a tune, tell stories to the squire;\r\n    Up to her godly garret after seven,\r\n    There starve and pray, for that's the way to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n[245] Games at cards. Pope wrote a poem called \"The Basset Table.\"\r\n\r\n[246] Four o'clock was soon the fashionable hour. Mr. Dobson quotes\r\nfrom Swift's \"Journal of a Modern Lady\" (1728):--\r\n\r\n    \"This business of importance o'er,\r\n    And madam almost dressed by four,\r\n    The footman, in his usual phrase,\r\n    Comes up with 'Madam, dinner stays.'\"\r\n\r\n[247] See Lucian's \"Judicium Vocalium.\" Such words as σήμερον and σὺκον\r\nafterwards came to be spelled τήμερον and τὺκον.\r\n\r\n[248] Coal carried by sea from the colliery, as was then the case with\r\nall the coal used in London.

It was\r\nsaid of two ancient authors who had very different beauties in their\r\nstyle, that if you took a word from one of them, you only spoiled\r\nhis eloquence; but if you took a word from the other, you spoiled his\r\nsense. I have often applied the first part of this criticism to several\r\nof these coffee-house speakers whom I have at present in my thoughts,\r\nthough the character that is given to the last of those authors is\r\nwhat I would recommend to the imitation of my loving countrymen:\r\nbut it is not only public places of resort, but private clubs and\r\nconversations over a bottle, that are infested with this loquacious\r\nkind of animal, especially with that species which I comprehend under\r\nthe name of a story-teller. I would earnestly desire these gentlemen\r\nto consider, that no point of wit or mirth at the end of a story can\r\natone for the half-hour that has been lost before they come at it. I\r\nwould likewise lay it home to their serious consideration, whether they\r\nthink that every man in the company has not a right to speak as well\r\nas themselves? and whether they do not think they are invading another\r\nman's property, when they engross the time which should be divided\r\nequally amongst the company to their own private use?\r\n\r\nWhat makes this evil the much greater in conversation is, that these\r\nhumdrum companions seldom endeavour to wind up their narrations into\r\na point of mirth or instruction, which might make some amends for the\r\ntediousness of them, but think they have a right to tell anything that\r\nhas happened within their memory. They look upon matter of fact to be\r\na sufficient foundation for a story, and give us a long account of\r\nthings, not because they are entertaining or surprising, but because\r\nthey are true.\r\n\r\nMy ingenious kinsman, Mr. Humphry Wagstaff,[255] used to say, the life\r\nof man is too short for a story-teller.\r\n\r\nMethusalem might be half an hour in telling what o'clock it was; but\r\nas for us postdiluvians, we ought to do everything in haste; and in\r\nour speeches, as well as actions, remember that our time is short. A\r\nman that talks for a quarter of an hour together in company, if I meet\r\nhim frequently, takes up a great part of my span. A quarter of an hour\r\nmay be reckoned the eight and fortieth part of a day, a day the three\r\nhundred and sixtieth part of a year, and a year the threescore and\r\ntenth part of life. By this moral arithmetic, supposing a man to be in\r\nthe talking world one-third part of the day, whoever gives another a\r\nquarter of an hour's hearing, makes him a sacrifice of more than the\r\nfour hundred thousandth part of his conversable life.\r\n\r\nI would establish but one great general rule to be observed in all\r\nconversation, which is this, that men should not talk to please\r\nthemselves, but those that hear them. This would make them consider,\r\nwhether what they speak be worth hearing; whether there be either wit\r\nor sense in what they are about to say; and whether it be adapted to\r\nthe time when, the place where, and the person to whom, it is spoken.\r\n\r\nFor the utter extirpation of these orators and story-tellers, which\r\nI look upon as very great pests of society, I have invented a watch,\r\nwhich divides the minute into twelve parts, after the same manner\r\nthat the ordinary watches are divided into hours; and will endeavour\r\nto get a patent, which shall oblige every club or company to provide\r\nthemselves with one of these watches (that shall lie upon the table\r\nas an hour-glass is often placed near the pulpit) to measure out the\r\nlength of a discourse.[256]\r\n\r\nI shall be willing to allow a man one round of my watch, that is, a\r\nwhole minute, to speak in; but if he exceeds that time, it shall be\r\nlawful for any of the company to look upon the watch, or to call him\r\ndown to order.\r\n\r\nProvided, however, that if any one can make it appear he is turned of\r\nthreescore, he may take two, or, if he pleases, three rounds of the\r\nwatch without giving offence. Provided also, that this rule be not\r\nconstrued to extend to the fair sex, who shall still be at liberty\r\nto talk by the ordinary watch that is now in use. I would likewise\r\nearnestly recommend this little automaton, which may be easily carried\r\nin the pocket without any encumbrance, to all such as are troubled with\r\nthis infirmity of speech, that upon pulling out their watches, they may\r\nhave frequent occasion to consider what they are doing, and by that\r\nmeans cut the thread of their story short, and hurry to a conclusion. I\r\nshall only add, that this watch, with a paper of directions how to use\r\nit, is sold at Charles Lillie's.\r\n\r\nI am afraid a _Tatler_ will be thought a very improper paper to censure\r\nthis humour of being talkative; but I would have my readers know, that\r\nthere is a great difference between tattle and loquacity, as I shall\r\nshow at large in a following Lucubration,[257] it being my design to\r\nthrow away a candle upon that subject, in order to explain the whole\r\nart of tattling in all its branches and subdivisions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[251] Trajan Boccalini, lawyer and satirical writer, was born in\r\n1556 at Loreto, and died in 1613.

It appeared, that the prosecutor did not think\r\nhimself injured till a few days after the aforesaid blow was given him;\r\nbut that having ruminated with himself for several days, and conferred\r\nupon it with other officers of the militia, he concluded, that he\r\nhad in effect been cudgelled by Mr. Heedless, and that he ought to\r\nresent it accordingly. The counsel for the prosecutor alleged, that\r\nthe shoulder was the tenderest part in a man of honour; that it had a\r\nnatural antipathy to a stick, and that every touch of it, with anything\r\nmade in the fashion of a cane, was to be interpreted as a wound in\r\nthat part, and a violation of the person's honour who received it.\r\nMr. Heedless replied, that what he had done was out of kindness to the\r\nprosecutor, as not thinking it proper for him to appear at the head\r\nof the trained-bands with a feather upon his shoulder; and further\r\nadded, that the stick he had made use of on this occasion was so very\r\nsmall, that the prosecutor could not have felt it, had he broken it on\r\nhis shoulders. The Censor hereupon directed the jury to examine into\r\nthe nature of the staff, for that a great deal would depend upon that\r\nparticular. Upon which he explained to them the different degrees of\r\noffence that might be given by the touch of crab-tree from that of\r\ncane, and by the touch of cane from that of a plain hazel stick. The\r\njury, after a short perusal of the staff, declared their opinion by the\r\nmouth of their foreman, that the substance of the staff was British\r\noak. The Censor then observing that there was some dust on the skirts\r\nof the criminal's coat, ordered the prosecutor to beat it off with his\r\naforesaid oaken plant; \"and thus,\" said the Censor, \"I shall decide\r\nthis cause by the law of retaliation: if Mr. Heedless did the colonel\r\na good office, the colonel will by this means return it in kind; but\r\nif Mr. Heedless should at any time boast that he had cudgelled the\r\ncolonel, or laid his staff over his shoulders, the colonel might boast\r\nin his turn, that he has brushed Mr. Heedless's jacket, or (to use the\r\nphrase of an ingenious author) that he has rubbed him down with an\r\noaken towel.\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin Busy, of London, merchant, was indicted by Jasper Tattle,\r\nEsq., for having pulled out his watch and looked upon it thrice, while\r\nthe said Esquire Tattle was giving him an account of the funeral of\r\nthe said Esquire Tattle's first wife. The prisoner alleged in his\r\ndefence, that he was going to buy stocks at the time when he met\r\nthe prosecutor; and that, during the story of the prosecutor, the\r\nsaid stocks rose above two per cent., to the great detriment of the\r\nprisoner. The prisoner further brought several witnesses, that the said\r\nJasper Tattle, Esq., was a most notorious story-teller; that before he\r\nmet the prisoner, he had hindered one of the prisoner's acquaintance\r\nfrom the pursuit of his lawful business, with the account of his\r\nsecond marriage; and that he had detained another by the button of his\r\ncoat that very morning, till he had heard several witty sayings and\r\ncontrivances of the prosecutor's eldest son, who was a boy of about\r\nfive years of age. Upon the whole matter, Mr. Bickerstaff dismissed the\r\naccusation as frivolous, and sentenced the prosecutor to pay damages to\r\nthe prisoner for what the prisoner had lost by giving him so long and\r\npatient a hearing. He further reprimanded the prosecutor very severely,\r\nand told him, that if he proceeded in his usual manner to interrupt the\r\nbusiness of mankind, he would set a fine upon him for every quarter of\r\nan hour's impertinence, and regulate the said fine according as the\r\ntime of the person so injured should appear to be more or less precious.\r\n\r\nSir Paul Swash, Kt., was indicted by Peter Double, Gent., for not\r\nreturning the bow which he received of the said Peter Double, on\r\nWednesday the 6th instant, at the play-house in the Haymarket. The\r\nprisoner denied the receipt of any such bow, and alleged in his\r\ndefence, that the prosecutor would oftentimes look full in his face,\r\nbut that when he bowed to the said prosecutor, he would take no notice\r\nof it, or bow to somebody else that sat quite on the other side of\r\nhim. He likewise alleged, that several ladies had complained of the\r\nprosecutor, who, after ogling them a quarter of an hour, upon their\r\nmaking a curtsey to him, would not return the civility of a bow.\r\nThe Censor observing several glances of the prosecutor's eye, and\r\nperceiving, that when he talked to the court, he looked upon the jury,\r\nfound reason to suspect that there was a wrong cast in his sight, which\r\nupon examination proved true. The Censor therefore ordered the prisoner\r\n(that he might not produce any more confusions in public assemblies)\r\nnever to bow to anybody whom he did not at the same time call to by his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nOliver Bluff, and Benjamin Browbeat, were indicted for going to fight\r\na duel since the erection of the Court of Honour. It appeared, that\r\nthey were both taken up in the street as they passed by the court, in\r\ntheir way to the fields behind Montague House.[259] The criminals would\r\nanswer nothing for themselves, but that they were going to execute\r\na challenge which had been made above a week before the Court of\r\nHonour was erected. The Censor finding some reasons to suspect (by the\r\nsturdiness of their behaviour) that they were not so very brave as they\r\nwould have the court believe them, ordered them both to be searched by\r\nthe grand jury, who found a breast-plate upon the one, and two quires\r\nof paper upon the other. The breast-plate was immediately ordered to\r\nbe hung upon a peg over Mr. Bickerstaff's tribunal, and the paper to\r\nbe laid upon the table for the use of his clerk. He then ordered the\r\ncriminals to button up their bosoms, and, if they pleased, proceed to\r\ntheir duel. Upon which they both went very quietly out of the court,\r\nand retired to their respective lodgings.\r\n\r\nThe court then adjourned till after the holidays.\r\n\r\n\"_Copia vera._--CHARLES LILLIE.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[258] See Nos. 28, 41, 60, 61, and 79.\r\n\r\n[259] A favourite place for duelling.

The infirmities of this stage of life would be\r\nmuch fewer, if we did not affect those which attend the more vigorous\r\nand active part of our days; but instead of studying to be wiser, or\r\nbeing contented with our present follies, the ambition of many of us\r\nis also to be the same sort of fools we formerly have been. I have\r\noften argued, as I am a professed lover of women, that our sex grows\r\nold with a much worse grace than the other does; and have ever been of\r\nopinion, that there are more well-pleased old women than old men. I\r\nthought it a good reason for this, that the ambition of the fair sex\r\nbeing confined to advantageous marriages, or shining in the eyes of\r\nmen, their parts were over sooner, and consequently the errors in the\r\nperformance of them. The conversation of this evening has not convinced\r\nme of the contrary; for one or two fop women shall not make a balance\r\nfor the crowds of coxcombs among ourselves, diversified according to\r\nthe different pursuits of pleasure and business.\r\n\r\nReturning home this evening a little before my usual hour, I scarce\r\nhad seated myself in my easy-chair, stirred the fire and stroked my\r\ncat, but I heard somebody come rumbling upstairs. I saw my door opened,\r\nand a human figure advancing towards me, so fantastically put together,\r\n'twas some minutes before I discovered it to be my old and intimate\r\nfriend Sam Trusty.[261] Immediately I rose up, and placed him in my\r\nown seat, a compliment I pay to few. The first thing he uttered was,\r\n\"Isaac, fetch me a cup of your cherry brandy before you offer to ask\r\nme any question.\" He drank a lusty draught, sat silent for some time,\r\nand at last broke out: \"I am come,\" quoth he, \"to insult thee for an\r\nold fantastic dotard as thou art in ever defending the women. I have\r\nthis evening visited two widows, who are now in that state I have\r\noften heard you call an after-life:[262] I suppose you mean by it an\r\nexistence which grows out of past entertainments, and is an untimely\r\ndelight in the satisfactions which they once set their hearts upon\r\ntoo much to be ever able to relinquish. Have but patience,\" continued\r\nhe, \"till I give you a succinct account of my ladies, and of this\r\nnight's adventure. They are much of an age, but very different in\r\ntheir characters: the one of them, with all the advances which years\r\nhave made upon her, goes on in a certain romantic road of love and\r\nfriendship which she fell into in her teens; the other has transferred\r\nthe amorous passions of her first years to the love of cronies, pets\r\nand favourites, with which she is always surrounded; but the genius of\r\neach of them will best appear by the account of what happened to me at\r\ntheir houses. About five this afternoon, being tired with study, the\r\nweather inviting, and time lying a little upon my hands, I resolved,\r\nat the instigation of my evil genius, to visit them, their husbands\r\nhaving been our contemporaries. This I thought I could do without much\r\ntrouble, for both live in the very next street. I went first to my Lady\r\nCamomile, and the butler, who had lived long in the family, and seen me\r\noften in his master's time, ushered me very civilly into the parlour,\r\nand told me, though my lady had given strict orders to be denied, he\r\nwas sure I might be admitted, and bid the black boy[263] acquaint his\r\nlady, that I was to wait upon her. In the window lay two letters, one\r\nbroke open, the other fresh sealed with a wafer: the first directed to\r\nthe divine Cosmelia, the second to the charming Lucinda; but both, by\r\nthe indented characters, appeared to have been writ by very unsteady\r\nhands. Such uncommon addresses increased my curiosity, and put me upon\r\nasking my old friend the butler, if he knew who those persons were?\r\n'Very well,' says he: 'this is from Mrs. Furbish to my lady, an old\r\nschoolfellow and great crony of her ladyship's, and this the answer.' I\r\ninquired in what country she lived. 'Oh dear!' says he, 'but just by in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Why, she was here all this morning, and that letter\r\ncame and was answered within these two hours. They have taken an odd\r\nfancy, you must know, to call one another hard names, but for all that\r\nthey love one another hugely.' By this time the boy returned with his\r\nlady's humble service to me, desiring I would excuse her, for she could\r\nnot possibly see me, nor anybody else, for it was opera night.\r\n\r\n\"Methinks,\" says I, \"such innocent folly as two old women's courtship\r\nto each other should rather make you merry, than put you out of\r\nhumour.\" \"Peace, good Isaac,\" says he, \"no interruption I beseech you.\r\nI got soon to Mrs. Feeble's, she that was formerly Betty Frisk; you\r\nmust needs remember her, Tom Feeble of Brasenose fell in love with her\r\nfor her fine dancing. Well, Mrs. Ursula, without further ceremony,\r\ncarries me directly up to her mistress's chamber, where I found her\r\nenvironed by four of the most mischievous animals that can ever infest\r\na family: an old shock[264] dog with one eye, a monkey chained to one\r\nside of the chimney, a great grey squirrel to the other, and a parrot\r\nwaddling in the middle of the room. However, for a while, all was in a\r\nprofound tranquillity. Upon the mantel-tree, for I am a pretty curious\r\nobserver, stood a pot of lambative electuary,[265] with a stick of\r\nliquorice, and near it a phial of rosewater and powder of tutty.[266]\r\nUpon the table lay a pipe filled with betony[267] and coltsfoot a\r\nroll of wax-candle, a silver spitting-pot, and a Seville orange. The\r\nlady was placed in a large wicker-chair, and her feet wrapped up in\r\nflannel, supported by cushions; and in this attitude (would you believe\r\nit, Isaac) was she reading a romance with spectacles on. The first\r\ncompliments over, as she was industriously endeavouring to enter upon\r\nconversation, a violent fit of coughing seized her. This awakened\r\nShock, and in a trice the whole room was in an uproar; for the dog\r\nbarked, the squirrel squealed, the monkey chattered, the parrot\r\nscreamed, and Ursula, to appease them, was more clamorous than all the\r\nrest. You, Isaac, who know how any harsh noise affects my head, may\r\nguess what I suffered from the hideous din of these discordant sounds.\r\nAt length all was appeased, and quiet restored: a chair was drawn\r\nfor me, where I was no sooner seated, but the parrot fixed his horny\r\nbeak, as sharp as a pair of shears, in one of my heels, just above the\r\nshoe. I sprang from the place with an unusual agility, and so being\r\nwithin the monkey's reach, he snatches off my new bob wig, and throws\r\nit upon two apples that were roasting by a sullen sea-coal fire.[268]\r\nI was nimble enough to save it from any further damage than singeing\r\nthe foretop. I put it on, and composing myself as well as I could, I\r\ndrew my chair towards the other side of the chimney. The good lady,\r\nas soon as she had recovered breath, employed it in making a thousand\r\napologies, and with great eloquence, and a numerous train of words,\r\nlamented my misfortune. In the middle of her harangue, I felt something\r\nscratching near my knee, and feeling what it should be, found the\r\nsquirrel had got into my coat pocket. As I endeavoured to remove him\r\nfrom his burrow, he made his teeth meet through the fleshy part of my\r\nforefinger. This gave me an inexpressible pain. The Hungary water[269]\r\nwas immediately brought to bathe it, and gold-beaters' skin applied\r\nto stop the blood. The lady renewed her excuses; but being now out of\r\nall patience, I abruptly took my leave, and hobbling downstairs with\r\nheedless haste, I set my foot full in a pail of water, and down we\r\ncame to the bottom together.\" Here my friend concluded his narrative,\r\nand, with a composed countenance, I began to make him compliments of\r\ncondolence; but he started from his chair, and said, \"Isaac, you may\r\nspare your speeches, I expect no reply: when I told you this, I knew\r\nyou would laugh at me; but the next woman that makes me ridiculous\r\nshall be a young one.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[260] Jeremy Taylor's \"Rule and Exercise of Holy Living and Dying\" was\r\npublished in 1650.\r\n\r\n[261] Perhaps Jabez Hughes, brother of John Hughes.

Such stated times for particular acts of devotion, or\r\nthe exercise of certain religious duties, have been enjoined in all\r\ncivil governments, whatever deity they worshipped, or whatever religion\r\nthey professed. That which may be done at all times, is often totally\r\nneglected and forgotten, unless fixed and determined to some time more\r\nthan another; and therefore, though several duties may be suitable to\r\nevery day of our lives, they are most likely to be performed if some\r\ndays are more particularly set apart for the practice of them. Our\r\nChurch has accordingly instituted several seasons of devotion, when\r\ntime, custom, prescription, and (if I may so say) the fashion itself,\r\ncall upon a man to be serious and attentive to the great end of his\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nI have hinted in some former papers, that the greatest and wisest of\r\nmen in all ages and countries, particularly in Rome and Greece, were\r\nrenowned for their piety and virtue. It is now my intention to show how\r\nthose in our own nation, that have been unquestionably the most eminent\r\nfor learning and knowledge, were likewise the most eminent for their\r\nadherence to the religion of their country.\r\n\r\nI might produce very shining examples from among the clergy; but\r\nbecause priestcraft is the common cry of every cavilling empty\r\nscribbler, I shall show, that all the laymen who have exerted a more\r\nthan ordinary genius in their writings, and were the glory of their\r\ntimes, were men whose hopes were filled with immortality, and the\r\nprospect of future rewards, and men who lived in a dutiful submission\r\nto all the doctrines of revealed religion.\r\n\r\nI shall in this paper only instance Sir Francis Bacon, a man who for\r\nthe greatness of genius, and compass of knowledge, did honour to\r\nhis age and country; I could almost say to human nature itself. He\r\npossessed at once all those extraordinary talents which were divided\r\namongst the greatest authors of antiquity. He had the sound, distinct,\r\ncomprehensive knowledge of Aristotle, with all the beautiful lights,\r\ngraces, and embellishments of Cicero. One does not know which to admire\r\nmost in his writings, the strength of reason, force of style, or\r\nbrightness of imagination.\r\n\r\nThis author has remarked in several parts of his works, that a\r\nthorough insight into philosophy makes a good believer, and that a\r\nsmattering in it naturally produces such a race of despicable infidels\r\nas the little profligate writers of the present age, whom (I must\r\nconfess) I have always accused to myself, not so much for their want of\r\nfaith as their want of learning.\r\n\r\nI was infinitely pleased to find among the works of this extraordinary\r\nman a prayer of his own composing, which, for the elevation of thought,\r\nand greatness of expression, seems rather the devotion of an angel than\r\na man. His principal fault seems to have been the excess of that virtue\r\nwhich covers a multitude of faults. This betrayed him to so great an\r\nindulgence towards his servants, who made a corrupt use of it, that\r\nit stripped him of all those riches and honours which a long series\r\nof merits had heaped upon him. But in this prayer, at the same time\r\nthat we find him prostrating himself before the great mercy-seat, and\r\nhumbled under afflictions which at that time lay heavy upon him, we see\r\nhim supported by the sense of his integrity, his zeal, his devotion,\r\nand his love to mankind, which give him a much higher figure in the\r\nminds of thinking men, than that greatness had done from which he was\r\nfallen. I shall beg leave to write down the prayer itself, with the\r\ntitle to it, as it was found among his lordship's papers, written in\r\nhis own hand; not being able to furnish my reader with an entertainment\r\nmore suitable to this solemn time.[270]\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAYER OR PSALM MADE BY MY LORD BACON, CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\"Most gracious Lord God, my merciful Father; from my youth up my\r\nCreator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou, O Lord, soundest and\r\nsearchest the depths and secrets of all hearts; Thou acknowledgest\r\nthe upright of heart; Thou judgest the hypocrite; Thou ponderest men's\r\nthoughts and doings as in a balance; Thou measurest their intentions as\r\nwith a line; vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid from Thee.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, O Lord! how Thy servant hath walked before Thee; remember\r\nwhat I have first sought, and what hath been principal in my\r\nintentions. I have loved Thy assemblies, I have mourned for the\r\ndivisions of Thy Church, I have delighted in the brightness of Thy\r\nsanctuary. This vine which Thy right hand hath planted in this nation,\r\nI have ever prayed unto Thee, that it might have the first and the\r\nlatter rain, and that it might stretch her branches to the seas, and\r\nto the floods. The state and bread of the poor and oppressed have been\r\nprecious in mine eyes; I have hated all cruelty and hardness of heart;\r\nI have (though in a despised weed) procured the good of all men. If\r\nany have been my enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath the sun\r\nalmost set upon my displeasure; but I have been as a dove, free from\r\nsuperfluity of maliciousness. Thy creatures have been my books, but Thy\r\nScriptures much more. I have sought Thee in the courts, fields, and\r\ngardens, but I have found Thee in Thy temples.\r\n\r\n\"Thousands have been my sins, and ten thousands my transgressions, but\r\nThy sanctifications have remained with me, and my heart (through Thy\r\ngrace) hath been an unquenched coal upon Thine altar.\r\n\r\n\"O Lord, my strength! I have since my youth met with Thee in all my\r\nways, by Thy fatherly compassions, by Thy comfortable chastisements,\r\nand by Thy most visible providence. As Thy favours have increased\r\nupon me, so have Thy corrections; so as Thou hast been always near\r\nme, O Lord! And ever as my worldly blessings were exalted, so secret\r\ndarts from Thee have pierced me; and when I have ascended before men,\r\nI have descended in humiliation before Thee. And now when I thought\r\nmost of peace and honour, Thy hand is heavy upon me, and hath humbled\r\nme according to Thy former loving-kindness, keeping me still in Thy\r\nfatherly school, not as a bastard, but as a child. Just are Thy\r\njudgments upon me for my sins, which are more in number than the sands\r\nof the sea, but have no proportion to Thy mercies; for what are the\r\nsands of the sea? Earth, heavens, and all these are nothing to Thy\r\nmercies. Besides my innumerable sins, I confess before Thee, that I am\r\ndebtor to Thee for the gracious talent of Thy gifts and graces, which I\r\nhave neither put into a napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to exchangers,\r\nwhere it might have made best profit, but misspent it in things for\r\nwhich I was least fit: so I may truly say, my soul hath been a stranger\r\nin the course of my pilgrimage. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my\r\nSaviour's sake, and receive me unto Thy bosom, or guide me in Thy ways.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[270] Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 268.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\n         From _Saturday, Dec. 23_, to _Tuesday, Dec. 26, 1710_.\r\n\r\n                  ----\"O te, Bolane, cerebri\r\n    Felicem!\" Aiebam tacitus; quum quidlibet ille\r\n    Garriret.----\r\n\r\n                                                    HOR., 1 Sat. ix. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment._\r\n\r\nAt my coming home last night, I found upon my table the following\r\npetition or project, sent me from Lloyd's Coffee-house[271] in the\r\ncity, with a present of port wine, which had been bought at a late\r\nauction held in that place:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq., Censor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_Lloyd's Coffee-house, Lombard Street, Dec. 23._\r\n\r\n\"We the customers of this coffee-house, observing that you have taken\r\ninto your consideration the great mischiefs daily done in this city by\r\ncoffee-house orators, do humbly beg leave to represent to you, that\r\nthis coffee-house being provided with a pulpit for the benefit of such\r\nauctions that are frequently made in this place, it is our custom, upon\r\nthe first coming in of the news, to order a youth, who officiates as\r\nthe Kidney[272] of the coffee-house, to get into the pulpit, and read\r\nevery paper with a loud and distinct voice, while the whole audience\r\nare sipping their respective liquors. We do therefore, sir, humbly\r\npropose, that there be a pulpit erected within every coffee-house\r\nof this city and the adjacent parts; that one of the waiters of the\r\ncoffee-house be nominated as reader to the said pulpit; that after\r\nthe news of the day has been published by the said lecturer, some\r\npolitician of good note do ascend into the said pulpit; and after\r\nhaving chosen for his text any article of the said news, that he do\r\nestablish the authority of such article, clear the doubts that may\r\narise thereupon, compare it with parallel texts in other papers,\r\nadvance upon it wholesome points of doctrine, and draw from it salutary\r\nconclusions for the benefit and edification of all that hear him. We\r\ndo likewise humbly propose, that upon any such politician's quitting\r\nthe pulpit, he shall be succeeded by any other orator that finds\r\nhimself moved by the same public spirit, who shall be at full liberty\r\neither to enforce or overthrow what the other has said before him,\r\nand may in the same manner be succeeded by any other politician, who\r\nshall with the same liberty confirm or impugn his reasons, strengthen\r\nor invalidate his conjectures, enlarge upon his schemes, or erect new\r\nones of his own. We do likewise further propose, that if any person, of\r\nwhat age or rank soever, do presume to cavil at any paper that has been\r\nread, or to hold forth upon it longer than the space of one minute,\r\nthat he be immediately ordered up into the pulpit, there to make good\r\nanything that he has suggested upon the floor. We do likewise further\r\npropose, that if any one plays the orator in the ordinary coffee-house\r\nconversation, whether it be upon peace or war, on plays or sermons,\r\nbusiness or poetry, that he be forthwith desired to take his place in\r\nthe pulpit.\r\n\r\n\"This, sir, we humbly presume may in a great measure put a stop to\r\nthose superficial statesmen who would not dare to stand up in this\r\nmanner before a whole congregation of politicians, notwithstanding the\r\nlong and tedious harangues and dissertations which they daily utter in\r\nprivate circles, to the breaking of many honest tradesmen, the seducing\r\nof several eminent citizens, the making of numberless malcontents, and\r\nto the great detriment and disquiet of her Majesty's subjects.\"\r\n\r\nI do heartily concur with my ingenious friends of the above-mentioned\r\ncoffee-house in these their proposals; and because I apprehend there\r\nmay be reasons to put an immediate stop to the grievance complained\r\nof, it is my intention that, till such time as the aforesaid pulpits\r\ncan be erected, every orator do place himself within the bar, and from\r\nthence dictate whatsoever he shall think necessary for the public good.\r\n\r\nAnd further, because I am very desirous that proper ways and means\r\nshould be found out for the suppressing of story-tellers and fine\r\ntalkers[273] in all ordinary conversation whatsoever, I do insist, that\r\nin every private club, company, or meeting over a bottle, there be\r\nalways an elbow-chair placed at the table, and that as soon as any one\r\nbegins a long story, or extends his discourse beyond the space of one\r\nminute, he be forthwith thrust into the said elbow-chair, unless upon\r\nany of the company's calling out to the chair, he breaks off abruptly,\r\nand holds his tongue.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of men, notwithstanding anything that has been\r\nhere said, whom I would exempt from the disgrace of the elbow-chair.\r\nThe first are those buffoons that have a talent of mimicking the speech\r\nand behaviour of other persons, and turning all their patrons, friends\r\nand acquaintance, into ridicule. I look upon your pantomime as a legion\r\nin a man, or at least to be like Virgil's monster, with a hundred\r\nmouths and as many tongues:\r\n\r\n              ----_Linguæ centum sunt, oraque centum_----\r\n\r\nand therefore would give him as much time to talk in, as would be\r\nallowed to the whole body of persons he represents, were they actually\r\nin the company which they divert by proxy. Provided however, that the\r\nsaid pantomime do not, upon any pretence whatsoever, utter anything in\r\nhis own particular opinion, language, or character.\r\n\r\nI would likewise in the second place grant an exemption from the\r\nelbow-chair to any person who treats the company,  and by that means\r\nmay be supposed to pay for his audience. A guest cannot take it ill if\r\nhe be not allowed to talk in his turn by a person who puts his mouth\r\nto a better employment, and stops it with good beef and mutton. In\r\nthis case the guest is very agreeably silenced, and seems to hold his\r\ntongue under that kind of bribery which the ancients called _bos in\r\nlingua_.[274]\r\n\r\nIf I can once extirpate the race of solid and substantial humdrums,\r\nI hope, by my wholesome and repeated advices, quickly to reduce the\r\ninsignificant tittle-tattles and matter-of-fact men that abound in\r\nevery quarter of this great city.\r\n\r\nEpictetus, in his little system of morality, prescribes the following\r\nrule with that beautiful simplicity which shines through all his\r\nprecepts: \"Beware that thou never tell thy dreams in company; for\r\nnotwithstanding thou mayest take a pleasure in telling thy dreams, the\r\ncompany will take no pleasure in hearing them.\"\r\n\r\nThis rule is conformable to a maxim which I have laid down in a late\r\npaper,[275] and must always inculcate into those of my readers who find\r\nin themselves an inclination to be very talkative and impertinent, that\r\nthey should not speak to please themselves, but those that hear them.\r\n\r\nIt has been often observed by witty essay writers, that the deepest\r\nwaters are always the most silent; that empty vessels make the greatest\r\nsound, and tinkling cymbals the worst music. The Marquis of Halifax, in\r\nhis admirable \"Advice to a Daughter,\"[276] tells her, that good sense\r\nhas always something sullen in it: but as sullenness does not only\r\nimply silence, but an ill-natured silence, I wish his lordship had\r\ngiven a softer name to it. Since I am engaged unawares in quotations,\r\nI must not omit the satire which Horace has written against this\r\nimpertinent talkative companion, and which, I think, is fuller of\r\nhumour than any other satire he has written. This great author, who\r\nhad the nicest taste of conversation, and was himself a most agreeable\r\ncompanion, had so strong an antipathy to a great talker, that he was\r\nafraid some time or other it would be mortal to him, as he has very\r\nhumorously described it in his conversation with an impertinent fellow\r\nwho had liked to have been the death of him:\r\n\r\n    _Interpellandi locus hic erat: \"Est tibi mater;\r\n    Cognati, quis te salvo est opus?\" \"Haud mihi quisquam.\r\n    Omnes composui.\" \"Felices, nunc ego resto.\r\n    Confice, namque instat fatum mihi triste, Sabella\r\n    Quod puero cecinit divinâ mota anus urnâ:\r\n    'Hunc neque dira venena, nec hosticus auseret ensis,\r\n    Nec laterum dolor, aut tussis, nec tarda podagra.\r\n    Garrulus hunc quando consumet cunque: loquaces,\r\n    Si sapiat, vitet, simul atque adoleverit ætas._'\"[277]\r\n\r\nThus translated by Mr. Oldham:\r\n\r\n    Here I got room to interrupt: \"Have you\r\n    A mother, sir, or kindred living now?\"\r\n    \"Not one, they all are dead.\" \"Troth, so I guessed;\r\n    The happier they,\" said I, \"who are at rest.\r\n    Poor I am only left unmurdered yet:\r\n    Haste, I beseech you, and despatch me quite,\r\n    For I am well convinced my time is come;\r\n    When I was young, a gipsy told my doom.\r\n    'This lad,' said she, and looked upon my hand,\r\n    'Shall not by sword or poison come to's end,\r\n    Nor by the fever, dropsy, gout, or stone;\r\n    But he shall die by an eternal tongue:\r\n    Therefore, when he's grown up, if he be wise,\r\n    Let him avoid great talkers, I advise.'\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[271] Edward Lloyd's Coffee-house in Tower Street is first heard of in\r\n1688; in 1692 Lloyd moved to Lombard Street, at the corner of Abchurch\r\nLane. Periodical sales were held at his house, which was the resort of\r\nmerchants and shipowners.

The two following epistles\r\nrelate to very great mischiefs in the most important articles of life,\r\nlove, and friendship:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                 _Dorsetshire, Dec. 20._\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"'Tis my misfortune to be enamoured of a lady that is neither very\r\nbeautiful, very witty, nor at all well-natured; but has the vanity to\r\nthink she excels in all these qualifications, and therefore is cruel,\r\ninsolent, and scornful. When I study to please her, she treats me\r\nwith the utmost rudeness and ill manners: if I approach her person,\r\nshe fights, she scratches me: if I offer a civil salute, she bites\r\nme; insomuch, that very lately, before a whole assembly of ladies and\r\ngentlemen, she ripped out a considerable part of my left cheek. This\r\nis no sooner done, but she begs my pardon in the most handsome and\r\nbecoming terms imaginable, gives herself worse language than I could\r\nfind in my heart to do, lets me embrace her to pacify her while she is\r\nrailing at herself, protests she deserves the esteem of no one living,\r\nsays I am too good to contradict her when she thus accuses herself.\r\nThis atones for all, tempts me to renew my addresses, which are ever\r\nreturned in the same obliging manner. Thus, without some speedy relief,\r\nI am in danger of losing my whole face. Notwithstanding all this, I\r\ndote upon her, and am satisfied she loves me, because she takes me for\r\na man of sense, which I have been generally thought, except in this one\r\ninstance. Your reflections upon this strange amour would be very useful\r\nin these parts, where we are overrun with wild beauties and romps. I\r\nearnestly beg your assistance, either to deliver me from the power of\r\nthis unaccountable enchantment, or, by some proper animadversions,\r\ncivilise the behaviour of this agreeable rustic. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n               \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n                                         \"EBENEZER.\"[278]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"I now take leave to address you in your character of censor, and\r\ncomplain to you, that among the various errors in conversation which\r\nyou have corrected, there is one which, though it has not escaped a\r\ngeneral reproof, yet seems to deserve a more particular severity.\r\n'Tis a humour of jesting on disagreeable subjects, and insisting on\r\nthe jest the more it creates uneasiness; and this some men think they\r\nhave a title to do as friends. Is the design of jesting to provoke? Or\r\ndoes friendship give a privilege to say things with a design to shock?\r\nHow can that be called a jest which has nothing in it but bitterness?\r\n'Tis generally allowed necessary, for the peace of company, that men\r\nshould a little study the tempers of each other; but certainly that\r\nmust be in order to shun what's offensive, not to make it a constant\r\nentertainment. The frequent repetition of what appears harsh, will\r\nunavoidably leave a rancour that's fatal to friendship; and I doubt\r\nmuch, whether it would be an argument of a man's good humour, if he\r\nshould be roused, by perpetual teasing, to treat those that do it as\r\nhis enemies. In a word, whereas 'tis a common practice to let a story\r\ndie, merely because it does not touch, I think such as mention one\r\nthey find does, are as troublesome to society, and as unfit for it, as\r\nwags, men of fire, good talkers, or any other apes in conversation;\r\nand therefore, for the public benefit, I hope you'll cause them to be\r\nbranded with such a name as they deserve. I am,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir, yours,\r\n                \"PATIENT FRIENDLY.\"\r\n\r\nThe case of Ebenezer is a very common one, and is always cured by\r\nneglect. These fantastical returns of affection proceed from a certain\r\nvanity in the other sex, supported by a perverted taste in ours. I\r\nmust publish it as a rule, that no faults which proceed from the will,\r\neither in a mistress or a friend, are to be tolerated. But we should be\r\nso complaisant to ladies, to let them displease when they aim at doing\r\nit. Pluck up a spirit, Ebenezer, recover the use of your judgment, and\r\nher faults will appear, or her beauties vanish. \"Her faults begin to\r\nplease me as well as my own,\" is a sentence very prettily put into the\r\nmouth of a lover by the comic poet,[279] but he never designed it for a\r\nmaxim of life, but the picture of an imperfection. If Ebenezer takes my\r\nadvice, the same temper which made her insolent to his love, will make\r\nher submissive to his indifference.\r\n\r\nI cannot wholly ascribe the faults mentioned in the second letter to\r\nthe same vanity or pride in companions who secretly triumph over their\r\nfriends, in being sharp upon them in things where they are most tender.\r\nBut when this sort of behaviour does not proceed from that source,\r\nit does from barrenness of invention, and an inability to support a\r\nconversation in a way less offensive. It is the same poverty which\r\nmakes men speak or write smuttily, that forces them to talk vexingly.\r\nAs obscene language is an address to the lewd for applause, so are\r\nsharp allusions an appeal to the ill-natured. But mean and illiterate\r\nis that conversation where one man exercises his wit to make another\r\nexercise his patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhereas Plagius has been told again and again, both in public and\r\nprivate, that he preaches excellently well, and still goes on to preach\r\nas well as ever, and all this to a polite and learned audience; this\r\nis to desire, that he would not hereafter be so eloquent, except to\r\na country congregation, the proprietors of Tillotson's works having\r\nconsulted the learned in the law, whether preaching a sermon they have\r\npurchased, is not to be construed publishing their copy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Dogood is desired to consider, that his story is severe upon a\r\nweakness, and not a folly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[278] There is a letter by Robin Harper on the same subject in Lillie's\r\n\"Letters sent to the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_,\" i. 326.\r\n\r\n[279] Congreve, \"The Way of the World,\" act i. sc. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       =No. 270.=                                        [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, Dec. 28_, to _Saturday, Dec. 30, 1710_.\r\n\r\n           Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes.\r\n\r\n                                                  HOR., 1 Ep. xviii. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, Dec. 29._\r\n\r\nAccording to my late resolution, I take the holidays to be no improper\r\nseason to entertain the town with the addresses of my correspondents.\r\nIn my walks every day there appear all round me very great offenders\r\nin the point of dress. An armed tailor had the impudence yesterday in\r\nthe park to smile in my face, and pull off a laced hat to me, as it\r\nwere in contempt of my authority and censure. However, it is a very\r\ngreat satisfaction, that other people as well as myself are offended\r\nwith these improprieties.

It is therefore with no small concern, that I behold in\r\ncoffee houses and public places my brethren, the tradesmen of this\r\ncity, put off the smooth, even, and ancient decorum of thriving\r\ncitizens, for a fantastical dress and figure, improper for their\r\npersons and characters, to the utter destruction of that order and\r\ndistinction which of right ought to be between St. James's and Milk\r\nStreet, the Camp and Cheapside.\r\n\r\n\"I have given myself some time to find out, how distinguishing the\r\nfrays in a lot of muslins, or drawing up a regiment of thread laces, or\r\nmaking a panegyric on pieces of sagathy[280] or Scotch plaid, should\r\nentitle a man to a laced hat or sword, a wig tied up with ribbons,\r\nor an embroidered coat. The College[281] say, this enormity proceeds\r\nfrom a sort of delirium in the brain, which makes it break out first\r\nabout the head, and, for want of timely remedies, fall upon the left\r\nthigh, and from thence in little mazes and windings run over the whole\r\nbody, as appears by pretty ornaments on the buttons, button-holes,\r\ngarterings, sides of the breeches, and the like. I beg the favour of\r\nyou to give us a discourse wholly upon the subject of habits, which\r\nwill contribute to the better government of conversation amongst us and\r\nin particular oblige,\r\n\r\n  \"Sir,\r\n               \"Your affectionate Cousin,\r\n                                   \"FELIX TRANQUILLUS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq., Censor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      \"_The humble Petition of Ralph Nab, haberdasher of hats and\r\n             many other poor sufferers of the same trade:_\r\n\r\n\"Showeth--That for some years last past the use of gold and\r\nsilver galloon[282] upon hats has been almost universal, being\r\nundistinguishably worn by soldiers, squires, lords, footmen, beaus,\r\nsportsmen, traders, clerks, prigs, smarts, cullies, pretty fellows, and\r\nsharpers.\r\n\r\n\"That the said use and custom has been two ways very prejudicial to\r\nyour petitioners: first, in that it has induced men, to the great\r\ndamage of your petitioners, to wear their hats upon their heads, by\r\nwhich means the said hats last much longer whole than they would do\r\nif worn under their arms. Secondly, in that very often a new dressing\r\nand a new lace supply the place of a new hat, which grievance we are\r\nchiefly sensible of in the spring-time, when the company is leaving the\r\ntown; it so happening commonly, that a hat shall frequent all winter\r\nthe finest and best assemblies without any ornaments at all, and in May\r\nshall be tricked up with gold or silver to keep company with rustics,\r\nand ride in the rain.\r\n\r\n\"All which premises your petitioners humbly pray you to take into your\r\nconsideration, and either to appoint a day in your Court of Honour,\r\nwhen all pretenders to the galloon may enter their claims, and have\r\nthem approved or rejected, or to give us such other relief as to your\r\ngreat wisdom shall seem meet.\r\n\r\n\"And your petitioners, &c.\"\r\n\r\nOrder my friend near Temple Bar, the author of the \"Hunting-Cock,\" to\r\nassist the court when this petition is read, of which Mr. Lillie to\r\ngive him notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq., Censor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"_The humble Petition of Elizabeth Slender, spinster:_\r\n\r\n\"Showeth--That on the 20th of this instant December, her friend Rebecca\r\nHive and your petitioner walking in the Strand, saw a gentleman before\r\nus in a gown, whose periwig was so long and so much powdered, that your\r\npetitioner took notice of it, and said, she wondered that lawyer would\r\nso spoil a new gown with powder. To which it was answered, that he was\r\nno lawyer but a clergyman. Upon a wager of a pot of coffee we overtook\r\nhim, and your petitioner was soon convinced she had lost.\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioner therefore desires your worship to cite the clergyman\r\nbefore you, and to settle and adjust the length of canonical periwigs,\r\nand the quantity of powder to be made use of in them, and to give such\r\nother directions as you shall think fit.[283]\r\n\r\n\"And your petitioner, &c.\"\r\n\r\nQ. Whether this gentleman be not chaplain to a regiment, and in such\r\ncase allow powder accordingly?\r\n\r\nAfter all that can be thought on these subjects, I must confess, that\r\nthe men who dress with a certain ambition to appear more than they are,\r\nare much more excusable than those who betray, in the adorning their\r\npersons, a secret vanity and inclination to shine in things, wherein if\r\nthey did succeed, it would rather lessen than advance their character.\r\nFor this reason, I am more provoked at the allegations relating to\r\nthe clergyman, than any other hinted at in these complaints. I have\r\nindeed a long time with much concern observed abundance of pretty\r\nfellows in sacred orders, and shall in due time let them know, that I\r\npretend to give ecclesiastical as well as civil censures. A man well\r\nbred and well dressed in that habit, adds to the sacredness of his\r\nfunction an agreeableness not to be met with among the laity. I own\r\nI have spent some evenings among the men of wit of that profession\r\nwith an inexpressible delight. Their habitual care of their character\r\ngives such a chastisement to their fancy, that all which they utter in\r\ncompany is as much above what you meet with in other conversations,\r\nas the charms of a modest are superior to those of a light woman. I\r\ntherefore earnestly desire our young missionaries from the Universities\r\nto consider where they are, and not dress, and look, and move like\r\nyoung officers. It is no disadvantage to have a very handsome white\r\nhand; but were I to preach repentance to a gallery of ladies, I would,\r\nmethinks, keep my gloves on. I have an unfeigned affection to the class\r\nof mankind appointed to serve at the altar, therefore am in danger\r\nof running out of my way, and growing too serious on this occasion;\r\nfor which reason I shall end with the following epistle, which, by my\r\ninterest in Tom Trot the penny-post, I procured a copy of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the Rev. Mr. RALPH INCENSE, Chaplain to the Countess-Dowager of\r\nBrumpton.\r\n\r\n  \"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I heard and saw you preach last Sunday.

This work has indeed for\r\nsome time been disagreeable to me, and the purpose of it wholly lost\r\nby my being so long understood as the author. I never designed in it\r\nto give any man any secret wound by my concealment, but spoke in the\r\ncharacter of an old man, a philosopher, a humourist, an astrologer,\r\nand a censor, to allure my reader with the variety of my subjects, and\r\ninsinuate, if I could, the weight of reason with the agreeableness of\r\nwit. The general purpose of the whole has been to recommend truth,\r\ninnocence, honour, and virtue, as the chief ornaments of life; but I\r\nconsidered, that severity of manners was absolutely necessary to him\r\nwho would censure others, and for that reason, and that only, chose\r\nto talk in a mask. I shall not carry my humility so far as to call\r\nmyself a vicious man; but at the same time must confess, my life is at\r\nbest but pardonable. And with no greater character than this, a man\r\nwould make but an indifferent progress in attacking prevailing and\r\nfashionable vices, which Mr. Bickerstaff has done with a freedom of\r\nspirit that would have lost both its beauty and efficacy, had it been\r\npretended to by Mr. Steele.\r\n\r\nAs to the work itself, the acceptance it has met with is the best proof\r\nof its value; but I should err against that candour which an honest\r\nman should always carry about him, if I did not own, that the most\r\napproved pieces in it were written by others, and those which have been\r\nmost excepted against by myself. The hand[285] that has assisted me in\r\nthose noble discourses upon the immortality of the soul, the glorious\r\nprospects of another life, and the most sublime ideas of religion and\r\nvirtue, is a person who is too fondly my friend ever to own them; but I\r\nshould little deserve to be his, if I usurped the glory of them. I must\r\nacknowledge at the same time, that I think the finest strokes of wit\r\nand humour in all Mr. Bickerstaff's Lucubrations are those for which he\r\nis also beholden to him.\r\n\r\nAs for the satirical parts of these writings, those against the\r\ngentlemen who profess gaming[286] are the most licentious; but the main\r\nof them I take to come from losing gamesters, as invectives against the\r\nfortunate; for in very many of them, I was very little else but the\r\ntranscriber. If any have been more particularly marked at, such persons\r\nmay impute it to their own behaviour (before they were touched upon) in\r\npublicly speaking their resentment against the author, and professing\r\nthey would support any man who should insult him. When I mention this\r\nsubject, I hope Major-General Davenport,[287] Brigadier Bisset,[288]\r\nand my Lord Forbes,[289] will accept of my thanks for their frequent\r\ngood offices,[290] in professing their readiness to partake any danger\r\nthat should befall me in so just an undertaking, as the endeavour\r\nto banish fraud and cozenage from the presence and conversation of\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nBut what I find is the least excusable part of all this work is, that\r\nI have, in some places in it, touched upon matters which concern both\r\nthe Church and State. All I shall say for this is, that the points\r\nI alluded to are such as concerned every Christian and freeholder\r\nin England; and I could not be cold enough to conceal my opinion on\r\nsubjects which related to either of those characters. But politics\r\napart, I must confess, it has been a most exquisite pleasure to me to\r\nframe characters of domestic life, and put those parts of it which\r\nare least observed into an agreeable view; to inquire into the seeds\r\nof vanity and affectation, to lay before my readers the emptiness of\r\nambition: in a word, to trace human life through all its mazes and\r\nrecesses, and show much shorter methods than men ordinarily practise,\r\nto be happy, agreeable, and great.\r\n\r\nBut to inquire into men's faults and weaknesses has something in it\r\nso unwelcome, that I have often seen people in pain to act before me,\r\nwhose modesty only make them think themselves liable to censure. This,\r\nand a thousand other nameless things, have made it an irksome task\r\nto me to personate Mr. Bickerstaff any longer; and I believe it does\r\nnot often happen, that the reader is delighted where the author is\r\ndispleased.\r\n\r\nAll I can now do for the further gratification of the town, is to give\r\nthem a faithful index and explication of passages and allusions, and\r\nsometimes of persons intended in the several scattered parts of the\r\nwork. At the same time, the succeeding volumes shall discover which of\r\nthe whole have been written by me, and which by others, and by whom, as\r\nfar as I am able, or permitted.[291]\r\n\r\nThus I have voluntarily done what I think all authors should do when\r\ncalled upon. I have published my name to my writings, and given myself\r\nup to the mercy of the town (as Shakespeare expresses it) with all my\r\nimperfections on my head.[292] The indulgent readers'\r\n\r\n  Most obliged,\r\n               Most obedient,\r\n                             Humble Servant,\r\n                                            RICHARD STEELE.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[284] \"Steele's last _Tatler_ came out to-day.
