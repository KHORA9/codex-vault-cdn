When men\r\nand women begin to feel that elections and legislatures do not matter\r\nvery much, that politics is a rather distant and unimportant exercise,\r\nthe reformer might as well put to himself a few searching doubts.\r\nIndifference is a criticism that cuts beneath oppositions and wranglings\r\nby calling the political method itself into question. Leaders in public\r\naffairs recognize this. They know that no attack is so disastrous as\r\nsilence, that no invective is so blasting as the wise and indulgent smile\r\nof the people who do not care. Eager to believe that all the world is as\r\ninterested as they are, there comes a time when even the reformer is\r\ncompelled to face the fairly widespread suspicion of the average man that\r\npolitics is an exhibition in which there is much ado about nothing. But\r\nsuch moments of illumination are rare. They appear in writers who realize\r\nhow large is the public that doesn't read their books, in reformers who\r\nventure to compare the membership list of their league with the census of\r\nthe United States. Whoever has been granted such a moment of insight\r\nknows how exquisitely painful it is. To conquer it men turn generally to\r\ntheir ancient comforter, self-deception: they complain about the stolid,\r\ninert masses and the apathy of the people. In a more confidential tone\r\nthey will tell you that the ordinary citizen is a \"hopelessly private\r\nperson.\"\r\n\r\nThe reformer is himself not lacking in stolidity if he can believe such a\r\nfiction of a people that crowds about tickers and demands the news of the\r\nday before it happens, that trembles on the verge of a panic over the\r\nunguarded utterance of a financier, and founds a new religion every month\r\nor so. But after a while self-deception ceases to be a comfort. This is\r\nwhen the reformer notices how indifference to politics is settling upon\r\nsome of the most alert minds of our generation, entering into the\r\nattitude of men as capable as any reformer of large and imaginative\r\ninterests. For among the keenest minds, among artists, scientists and\r\nphilosophers, there is a remarkable inclination to make a virtue of\r\npolitical indifference. Too passionate an absorption in public affairs is\r\nfelt to be a somewhat shallow performance, and the reformer is patronized\r\nas a well-meaning but rather dull fellow. This is the criticism of men\r\nengaged in some genuinely creative labor. Often it is unexpressed, often\r\nas not the artist or scientist will join in a political movement. But in\r\nthe depths of his soul there is, I suspect, some feeling which says to\r\nthe politician, \"Why so hot, my little sir?\"\r\n\r\nNothing, too, is more illuminating than the painful way in which many\r\npeople cultivate a knowledge of public affairs because they have a\r\nconscience and wish to do a citizen's duty. Having read a number of\r\narticles on the tariff and ploughed through the metaphysics of the\r\ncurrency question, what do they do? They turn with all the more zest to\r\nsome spontaneous human interest. Perhaps they follow, follow, follow\r\nRoosevelt everywhere, and live with him through the emotions of a great\r\nbattle. But for the affairs of statecraft, for the very policies that a\r\nRoosevelt advocates, the interest is largely perfunctory, maintained out\r\nof a sense of duty and dropped with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nThat reaction may not be as deplorable as it seems. Pick up your\r\nnewspaper, read the Congressional Record, run over in your mind the\r\n\"issues\" of a campaign, and then ask yourself whether the average man is\r\nentirely to blame because he smiles a bit at Armageddon and refuses to\r\ntake the politician at his own rhetorical valuation. If men find\r\nstatecraft uninteresting, may it not be that statecraft _is_\r\nuninteresting? I have a more or less professional interest in public\r\naffairs; that is to say, I have had opportunity to look at politics from\r\nthe point of view of the man who is trying to get the attention of people\r\nin order to carry through some reform. At first it was a hard confession\r\nto make, but the more I saw of politics at first-hand, the more I\r\nrespected the indifference of the public. There was something\r\nmonotonously trivial and irrelevant about our reformist enthusiasm, and\r\nan appalling justice in that half-conscious criticism which refuses to\r\nplace politics among the genuine, creative activities of men. Science was\r\nvalid, art was valid, the poorest grubber in a laboratory was engaged in\r\na real labor, anyone who had found expression in some beautiful object\r\nwas truly centered. But politics was a personal drama without meaning or\r\na vague abstraction without substance.\r\n\r\nYet there was the fact, just as indisputable as ever, that public affairs\r\ndo have an enormous and intimate effect upon our lives. They make or\r\nunmake us. They are the foundation of that national vigor through which\r\ncivilizations mature. City and countryside, factories and play, schools\r\nand the family are powerful influences in every life, and politics is\r\ndirectly concerned with them. If politics is irrelevant, it is certainly\r\nnot because its subject matter is unimportant. Public affairs govern our\r\nthinking and doing with subtlety and persistence.\r\n\r\nThe trouble, I figured, must be in the way politics is concerned with the\r\nnation's interests. If public business seems to drift aimlessly, its\r\nresults are, nevertheless, of the highest consequence. In statecraft the\r\npenalties and rewards are tremendous. Perhaps the approach is distorted.\r\nPerhaps uncriticised assumptions have obscured the real uses of politics.\r\nPerhaps an attitude can be worked out which will engage a fresher\r\nattention. For there are, I believe, blunders in our political thinking\r\nwhich confuse fictitious activity with genuine achievement, and make it\r\ndifficult for men to know where they should enlist. Perhaps if we can see\r\npolitics in a different light, it will rivet our creative interests.\r\n\r\nThese essays, then, are an attempt to sketch an attitude towards\r\nstatecraft. I have tried to suggest an approach, to illustrate it\r\nconcretely, to prepare a point of view. In selecting for the title \"A\r\nPreface to Politics,\" I have wished to stamp upon the whole book my own\r\nsense that it is a beginning and not a conclusion. I have wished to\r\nemphasize that there is nothing in this book which can be drafted into a\r\nlegislative proposal and presented to the legislature the day after\r\nto-morrow. It was not written with the notion that these pages would\r\ncontain an adequate exposition of modern political method. Much less was\r\nit written to further a concrete program. There are, I hope, no\r\nassumptions put forward as dogmas.\r\n\r\nIt is a preliminary sketch for a theory of politics, a preface to\r\nthinking. Like all speculation about human affairs, it is the result of a\r\ngrapple with problems as they appear in the experience of one man. For\r\nthough a personal vision may at times assume an eloquent and universal\r\nlanguage, it is well never to forget that all philosophies are the\r\nlanguage of particular men.\r\n\r\n                                                  W. L.\r\n\r\n46 East 80th Street, NEW YORK CITY, January 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PREFACE TO POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nROUTINEER AND INVENTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitics does not exist for the sake of demonstrating the superior\r\nrighteousness of anybody. It is not a competition in deportment. In fact,\r\nbefore you can begin to think about politics at all you have to abandon\r\nthe notion that there is a war between good men and bad men. That is one\r\nof the great American superstitions. More than any other fetish it has\r\nruined our sense of political values by glorifying the pharisee with his\r\nvain cruelty to individuals and his unfounded approval of himself. You\r\nhave only to look at the Senate of the United States, to see how that\r\nbody is capable of turning itself into a court of preliminary hearings\r\nfor the Last Judgment, wasting its time and our time and absorbing public\r\nenthusiasm and newspaper scareheads. For a hundred needs of the nation it\r\nhas no thought, but about the precise morality of an historical\r\ntransaction eight years old there is a meticulous interest. Whether in\r\nthe Presidential Campaign of 1904 Roosevelt was aware that the ancient\r\ntradition of corporate subscriptions had or had not been followed, and\r\nthe exact and ultimate measure of the guilt that knowledge would have\r\nimplied--this in the year 1912 is enough to start the Senate on a\r\nprotracted man-hunt.\r\n\r\nNow if one half of the people is bent upon proving how wicked a man is\r\nand the other half is determined to show how good he is, neither half\r\nwill think very much about the nation. An innocent paragraph in the New\r\nYork Evening Post for August 27, 1912, gives the whole performance away.\r\nIt shows as clearly as words could how disastrous the good-and-bad-man\r\ntheory is to political thinking:\r\n\r\n\"Provided the first hearing takes place on September 30, it is expected\r\nthat the developments will be made with a view to keeping the Colonel on\r\nthe defensive. After the beginning of October, it is pointed out, the\r\nevidence before the Committee should keep him so busy explaining and\r\ndenying that the country will not hear much Bull Moose doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nWhether you like the Roosevelt doctrines or not, there can be no two\r\nopinions about such an abuse of morality. It is a flat public loss,\r\nanother attempt to befuddle our thinking. For if politics is merely a\r\nguerilla war between the bribed and the unbribed, then statecraft is not\r\na human service but a moral testing ground. It is a public amusement, a\r\nmelodrama of real life, in which a few conspicuous characters are tried,\r\nand it resembles nothing so much as schoolboy hazing which we are told\r\nexists for the high purpose of detecting a \"yellow streak.\" But even\r\nthough we desired it there would be no way of establishing any clear-cut\r\ndifference in politics between the angels and the imps. The angels are\r\nlargely self-appointed, being somewhat more sensitive to other people's\r\ntar than their own.\r\n\r\nBut if the issue is not between honesty and dishonesty, where is it?\r\n\r\nIf you stare at a checkerboard you can see it as black on red, or red on\r\nblack, as series of horizontal, vertical or diagonal steps which recede\r\nor protrude. The longer you look the more patterns you can trace, and the\r\nmore certain it becomes that there is no single way of looking at the\r\nboard. So with political issues. There is no obvious cleavage which\r\neveryone recognizes. Many patterns appear in the national life. The\r\n\"progressives\" say the issue is between \"Privilege\" and the \"People\"; the\r\nSocialists, that it is between the \"working class\" and the \"master\r\nclass.\" An apologist for dynamite told me once that society was divided\r\ninto the weak and the strong, and there are people who draw a line\r\nbetween Philistia and Bohemia.\r\n\r\nWhen you rise up and announce that the conflict is between this and that,\r\nyou mean that this particular conflict interests you. The issue of\r\ngood-and-bad-men interests this nation to the exclusion of almost all\r\nothers. But experience shows, I believe, that it is a fruitless conflict\r\nand a wasting enthusiasm. Yet some distinction must be drawn if we are to\r\nact at all in politics. With nothing we are for and nothing to oppose, we\r\nare merely neutral. This cleavage in public affairs is the most important\r\nchoice we are called upon to make. In large measure it determines the\r\nrest of our thinking. Now some issues are fertile; some are not. Some\r\nlead to spacious results; others are blind alleys. With this in mind I\r\nwish to suggest that the distinction most worth emphasizing to-day is\r\nbetween those who regard government as a routine to be administered and\r\nthose who regard it as a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nThe class of routineers is larger than the conservatives. The man who\r\nwill follow precedent, but never create one, is merely an obvious example\r\nof the routineer. You find him desperately numerous in the civil service,\r\nin the official bureaus. To him government is something given as\r\nunconditionally, as absolutely as ocean or hill. He goes on winding the\r\ntape that he finds. His imagination has rarely extricated itself from\r\nunder the administrative machine to gain any sense of what a human,\r\ntemporary contraption the whole affair is. What he thinks is the heavens\r\nabove him is nothing but the roof.\r\n\r\nHe is the slave of routine. He can boast of somewhat more spiritual\r\ncousins in the men who reverence their ancestors' independence, who feel,\r\nas it were, that a disreputable great-grandfather is necessary to a\r\nfamily's respectability. These are the routineers gifted with historical\r\nsense. They take their forefathers with enormous solemnity. But one\r\nmistake is rarely avoided: they imitate the old-fashioned thing their\r\ngrandfather did, and ignore the originality which enabled him to do it.\r\n\r\nIf tradition were a reverent record of those crucial moments when men\r\nburst through their habits, a love of the past would not be the butt on\r\nwhich every sophomoric radical can practice his wit. But almost always\r\ntradition is nothing but a record and a machine-made imitation of the\r\nhabits that our ancestors created. The average conservative is a slave to\r\nthe most incidental and trivial part of his forefathers' glory--to the\r\narchaic formula which happened to express their genius or the eighteenth\r\ncentury contrivance by which for a time it was served. To reverence\r\nWashington they wear a powdered wig; they do honor to Lincoln by\r\ncultivating awkward hands and ungainly feet.\r\n\r\nIt is fascinating to watch this kind of conservative in action. From\r\nSenator Lodge, for example, we do not expect any new perception of\r\npopular need. We know that probably his deepest sincerity is an attempt\r\nto reproduce the atmosphere of the Senate a hundred years ago. The\r\nmanners of Mr. Lodge have that immobility which comes from too much\r\ngazing at bad statues of dead statesmen.\r\n\r\nYet just because a man is in opposition to Senator Lodge there is no\r\nguarantee that he has freed himself from the routineer's habit of mind. A\r\nprejudice against some mannerism or a dislike of pretensions may merely\r\ncloak some other kind of routine. Take the \"good government\" attitude. No\r\nfresh insight is behind that. It does not promise anything; it does not\r\noffer to contribute new values to human life. The machine which exists is\r\naccepted in all its essentials: the \"goo-goo\" yearns for a somewhat\r\nsmoother rotation.\r\n\r\nOften as not the very effort to make the existing machine run more\r\nperfectly merely makes matters worse. For the tinkering reformer is\r\nfrequently one of the worst of the routineers. Even machines are not\r\naltogether inflexible, and sometimes what the reformer regards as a sad\r\ndeviation from the original plans is a poor rickety attempt to adapt the\r\nmachine to changing conditions. Think what would have happened had we\r\nactually remained stolidly faithful to every intention of the Fathers.\r\nThink what would happen if every statute were enforced. By the sheer\r\nforce of circumstances we have twisted constitutions and laws to some\r\napproximation of our needs. A changing country has managed to live in\r\nspite of a static government machine. Perhaps Bernard Shaw was right when\r\nhe said that \"the famous Constitution survives only because whenever any\r\ncorner of it gets into the way of the accumulating dollar it is pettishly\r\nknocked off and thrown away. Every social development, however beneficial\r\nand inevitable from the public point of view, is met, not by an\r\nintelligent adaptation of the social structure to its novelties but by a\r\npanic and a cry of Go Back.\"\r\n\r\nI am tempted to go further and put into the same class all those radicals\r\nwho wish simply to substitute some other kind of machine for the one we\r\nhave. Though not all of them would accept the name, these reformers are\r\nsimply utopia-makers in action. Their perceptions are more critical than\r\nthe ordinary conservatives'. They do see that humanity is badly squeezed\r\nin the existing mould. They have enough imagination to conceive a\r\ndifferent one. But they have an infinite faith in moulds. This routine\r\nthey don't believe in, but they believe in their own: if you could put\r\nthe country under a new \"system,\" then human affairs would run\r\nautomatically for the welfare of all. Some improvement there might be,\r\nbut as almost all men are held in an iron devotion to their own\r\ncreations, the routine reformers are simply working for another\r\nconservatism, and not for any continuing liberation.\r\n\r\nThe type of statesman we must oppose to the routineer is one who regards\r\nall social organization as an instrument. Systems, institutions and\r\nmechanical contrivances have for him no virtue of their own: they are\r\nvaluable only when they serve the purposes of men. He uses them, of\r\ncourse, but with a constant sense that men have made them, that new ones\r\ncan be devised, that only an effort of the will can keep machinery in its\r\nplace. He has no faith whatever in automatic governments. While the\r\nroutineers see machinery and precedents revolving with mankind as\r\npuppets, he puts the deliberate, conscious, willing individual at the\r\ncenter of his philosophy. This reversal is pregnant with a new outlook\r\nfor statecraft. I hope to show that it alone can keep step with life; it\r\nalone is humanly relevant; and it alone achieves valuable results.\r\n\r\nCall this man a political creator or a political inventor. The essential\r\nquality of him is that he makes that part of existence which has\r\nexperience the master of it. He serves the ideals of human feelings, not\r\nthe tendencies of mechanical things.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a phonograph and the human voice is that the\r\nphonograph must sing the song which is stamped upon it. Now there are\r\ndays--I suspect the vast majority of them in most of our lives--when we\r\ngrind out the thing that is stamped upon us. It may be the governing of a\r\ncity, or teaching school, or running a business. We do not get out of bed\r\nin the morning because we are eager for the day; something external--we\r\noften call it our duty--throws off the bed-clothes, complains that the\r\nshaving water isn't hot, puts us into the subway and lands us at our\r\noffice in season for punching the time-check. We revolve with the\r\nbusiness for three or four hours, signing letters, answering telephones,\r\nchecking up lists, and perhaps towards twelve o'clock the prospect of\r\nlunch puts a touch of romance upon life. Then because our days are so\r\nunutterably the same, we turn to the newspapers, we go to the magazines\r\nand read only the \"stuff with punch,\" we seek out a \"show\" and drive\r\nserious playwrights into the poorhouse. \"You can go through contemporary\r\nlife,\" writes Wells, \"fudging and evading, indulging and slacking, never\r\nreally hungry nor frightened nor passionately stirred, your highest\r\nmoment a mere sentimental orgasm, and your first real contact with\r\nprimary and elementary necessities the sweat of your death-bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe world grinds on: we are a fly on the wheel. That sense of an\r\nimpersonal machine going on with endless reiteration is an experience\r\nthat imaginative politicians face. Often as not they disguise it under\r\nheroic phrases and still louder affirmation, just as most of us hide our\r\ncowardly submission to monotony under some word like duty, loyalty,\r\nconscience. If you have ever been an office-holder or been close to\r\nofficials, you must surely have been appalled by the grim way in which\r\ncommittee-meetings, verbose reports, flamboyant speeches, requests, and\r\ndelegations hold the statesman in a mind-destroying grasp. Perhaps this\r\nis the reason why it has been necessary to retire Theodore Roosevelt from\r\npublic life every now and then in order to give him a chance to learn\r\nsomething new. Every statesman like every professor should have his\r\nsabbatical year.\r\n\r\nThe revolt against the service of our own mechanical habits is well known\r\nto anyone who has followed modern thought. As a sharp example one might\r\npoint to Thomas Davidson, whom William James called \"individualist à\r\noutrance\".... \"Reprehending (mildly) a certain chapter of my own on\r\n'Habit,' he said that it was a fixed rule with him to form no regular\r\nhabits. When he found himself in danger of settling into even a good one,\r\nhe made a point of interrupting it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch men are the sparkling streams that flow through the dusty stretches\r\nof a nation. They invigorate and emphasize those times in your own life\r\nwhen each day is new. Then you are alive, then you drive the world before\r\nyou. The business, however difficult, shapes itself to your effort; you\r\nseem to manage detail with an inferior part of yourself, while the real\r\nsoul of you is active, planning, light. \"I wanted thought like an edge of\r\nsteel and desire like a flame.\" Eager with sympathy, you and your work\r\nare reflected from many angles. You have become luminous.\r\n\r\nSome people are predominantly eager and wilful. The world does not huddle\r\nand bend them to a task. They are not, as we say, creatures of\r\nenvironment, but creators of it. Of other people's environment they\r\nbecome the most active part--the part which sets the fashion. What they\r\ninitiate, others imitate. Theirs is a kind of intrinsic prestige. These\r\nare the natural leaders of men, whether it be as head of the gang or as\r\nfounder of a religion.\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, this power of being aggressively active towards the\r\nworld which gives man a miraculous assurance that the world is something\r\nhe can make. In creative moments men always draw upon \"some secret spring\r\nof certainty, some fundamental well into which no disturbing glimmers\r\npenetrate.\" But this is no slack philosophy, for the chance is denied by\r\nwhich we can lie back upon the perfection of some mechanical contrivance.\r\nYet in the light of it government becomes alert to a process of continual\r\ncreation, an unceasing invention of forms to meet constantly changing\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThis philosophy is not only difficult to practice: it is elusive when you\r\ncome to state it. For our political language was made to express a\r\nroutine conception of government. It comes to us from the Eighteenth\r\nCentury. And no matter how much we talk about the infusion of the\r\n\"evolutionary\" point of view into all of modern thought, when the test is\r\nmade political practice shows itself almost virgin to the idea. Our\r\ntheories assume, and our language is fitted to thinking of government as\r\na frame--Massachusetts, I believe, actually calls her fundamental law the\r\nFrame of Government. We picture political institutions as mechanically\r\nconstructed contrivances within which the nation's life is contained and\r\ncompelled to approximate some abstract idea of justice or liberty. These\r\nframes have very little elasticity, and we take it as an historical\r\ncommonplace that sooner or later a revolution must come to burst the\r\nframe apart. Then a new one is constructed.\r\n\r\nOur own Federal Constitution is a striking example of this machine\r\nconception of government. It is probably the most important instance we\r\nhave of the deliberate application of a mechanical philosophy to human\r\naffairs. Leaving out all question of the Fathers' ideals, looking simply\r\nat the bias which directed their thinking, is there in all the world a\r\nmore plain-spoken attempt to contrive an automatic governor--a machine\r\nwhich would preserve its balance without the need of taking human nature\r\ninto account? What other explanation is there for the naïve faith of the\r\nFathers in the \"symmetry\" of executive, legislature, and judiciary; in\r\nthe fantastic attempts to circumvent human folly by balancing it with\r\nvetoes and checks? No insight into the evident fact that power upsets all\r\nmechanical foresight and gravitates toward the natural leaders seems to\r\nhave illuminated those historic deliberations. The Fathers had a rather\r\npale god, they had only a speaking acquaintance with humanity, so they\r\nput their faith in a scaffold, and it has been part of our national piety\r\nto pretend that they succeeded.\r\n\r\nThey worked with the philosophy of their age. Living in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury, they thought in the images of Newton and Montesquieu. \"The\r\nGovernment of the United States,\" writes Woodrow Wilson, \"was constructed\r\nupon the Whig theory of political dynamics, which was a sort of\r\nunconscious copy of the Newtonian theory of the universe.... As\r\nMontesquieu pointed out to them (the English Whigs) in his lucid way,\r\nthey had sought to balance executive, legislative and judiciary off\r\nagainst one another by a series of checks and counterpoises, which Newton\r\nmight readily have recognized as suggestive of the mechanism of the\r\nheavens.\" No doubt this automatic and balanced theory of government\r\nsuited admirably that distrust of the people which seems to have been a\r\ndominant feeling among the Fathers. For they were the conservatives of\r\ntheir day: between '76 and '89 they had gone the usual way of opportunist\r\nradicals. But had they written the Constitution in the fire of their\r\nyouth, they might have made it more democratic,--I doubt whether they\r\nwould have made it less mechanical. The rebellious spirit of Tom Paine\r\nexpressed itself in logical formulæ as inflexible to the pace of life as\r\ndid the more contented Hamilton's. This is a determinant which burrows\r\nbeneath our ordinary classification of progressive and reactionary to the\r\nspiritual habits of a period.\r\n\r\nIf you look into the early utopias of Fourier and Saint-Simon, or better\r\nstill into the early trade unions, this same faith that a government can\r\nbe made to work mechanically is predominant everywhere. All the devices\r\nof rotation in office, short terms, undelegated authority are simply\r\nattempts to defeat the half-perceived fact that power will not long stay\r\ndiffused. It is characteristic of these primitive democracies that they\r\nworship Man and distrust men. They cling to some arrangement, hoping\r\nagainst experience that a government freed from human nature will\r\nautomatically produce human benefits. To-day within the Socialist Party\r\nthere is perhaps the greatest surviving example of the desire to offset\r\nnatural leadership by artificial contrivance. It is an article of faith\r\namong orthodox socialists that personalities do not count, and I\r\nsincerely believe I am not exaggerating the case when I say that their\r\nideal of government is like Gordon Craig's ideal of the theater--the\r\nacting is to be done by a row of supermarionettes. There is a myth among\r\nsocialists to which all are expected to subscribe, that initiative\r\nsprings anonymously out of the mass of the people,--that there are no\r\n\"leaders,\" that the conspicuous figures are no more influential than the\r\nfigurehead on the prow of a ship.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the paradoxes of the democratic movement--that it loves a\r\ncrowd and fears the individuals who compose it--that the religion of\r\nhumanity should have had no faith in human beings. Jealous of all\r\nindividuals, democracies have turned to machines. They have tried to blot\r\nout human prestige, to minimize the influence of personality. That there\r\nis historical justification for this fear is plain enough. To put it\r\nbriefly, democracy is afraid of the tyrant. That explains, but does not\r\njustify. Governments have to be carried on by men, however much we\r\ndistrust them. Nobody has yet invented a mechanically beneficent\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nDemocracy has put an unfounded faith in automatic contrivances. Because\r\nit left personality out of its speculation, it rested in the empty faith\r\nthat it had excluded it from reality. But in the actual stress of life\r\nthese frictions do not survive ten minutes. Public officials do not\r\nbecome political marionettes, though people pretend that they are. When\r\ntheory runs against the grain of living forces, the result is a deceptive\r\ntheory of politics. If the real government of the United States \"had, in\r\nfact,\" as Woodrow Wilson says, \"been a machine governed by mechanically\r\nautomatic balances, it would have had no history; but it was not, and its\r\nhistory has been rich with the influence and personalities of the men who\r\nhave conducted it and made it a living reality.\" Only by violating the\r\nvery spirit of the constitution have we been able to preserve the letter\r\nof it. For behind that balanced plan there grew up what Senator Beveridge\r\nhas called so brilliantly the \"invisible government,\" an empire of\r\nnatural groups about natural leaders. Parties are such groups: they have\r\nhad a power out of all proportion to the intentions of the Fathers.\r\nBehind the parties has grown up the \"political machine\"--falsely called a\r\nmachine, the very opposite of one in fact, a natural sovereignty, I\r\nbelieve. The really rigid and mechanical thing is the charter behind\r\nwhich Tammany works. For Tammany is the real government that has defeated\r\na mechanical foresight. Tammany is not a freak, a strange and monstrous\r\nexcrescence. Its structure and the laws of its life are, I believe,\r\ntypical of all real sovereignties. You can find Tammany duplicated\r\nwherever there is a social group to be governed--in trade unions, in\r\nclubs, in boys' gangs, in the Four Hundred, in the Socialist Party. It is\r\nan accretion of power around a center of influence, cemented by\r\npatronage, graft, favors, friendship, loyalties, habits,--a human\r\ngrouping, a natural pyramid.\r\n\r\nOnly recently have we begun to see that the \"political ring\" is not\r\nsomething confined to public life. It was Lincoln Steffens, I believe,\r\nwho first perceived that fact. For a time it was my privilege to work\r\nunder him on an investigation of the \"Money Power.\" The leading idea was\r\ndifferent from customary \"muckraking.\" We were looking not for the evils\r\nof Big Business, but for its anatomy. Mr. Steffens came to the subject\r\nwith a first-hand knowledge of politics. He knew the \"invisible\r\ngovernment\" of cities, states, and the nation. He knew how the boss\r\nworked, how he organized his power. When Mr. Steffens approached the vast\r\nconfusion and complication of big business, he needed some hypothesis to\r\nguide him through that maze of facts. He made a bold and brilliant guess,\r\nan hypothesis. To govern a life insurance company, Mr. Steffens argued,\r\nwas just as much \"government\" as to run a city. What if political methods\r\nexisted in the realm of business? The investigation was never carried\r\nthrough completely, but we did study the methods by which several life\r\nand fire insurance companies, banks, two or three railroads, and several\r\nindustrials are controlled. We found that the anatomy of Big Business was\r\nstrikingly like that of Tammany Hall: the same pyramiding of influence,\r\nthe same tendency of power to center on individuals who did not\r\nnecessarily sit in the official seats, the same effort of human\r\norganization to grow independently of legal arrangements. Thus in the\r\nlife insurance companies, and the Hughes investigation supports this, the\r\nreal power was held not by the president, not by the voters or\r\npolicy-holders, but by men who were not even directors. After a while we\r\ntook it as a matter of course that the head of a company was an\r\nadministrative dummy, with a dependence on unofficial power similar to\r\nthat of Governor Dix on Boss Murphy. That seems to be typical of the\r\nwhole economic life of this country. It is controlled by groups of men\r\nwhose influence extends like a web to smaller, tributary groups, cutting\r\nacross all official boundaries and designations, making short work of all\r\nlegal formulæ, and exercising sovereignty regardless of the little fences\r\nwe erect to keep it in bounds.\r\n\r\nA glimpse into the labor world revealed very much the same condition. The\r\nboss, and the bosslet, the heeler--the men who are \"it\"--all are there\r\nexercising the real power, the power that independently of charters and\r\nelections decides what shall happen. I don't wish to have this regarded\r\nas necessarily malign. It seems so now because we put our faith in the\r\nideal arrangements which it disturbs. But if we could come to face it\r\nsquarely--to see that that is what sovereignty is--that if we are to use\r\nhuman power for human purposes we must turn to the realities of it, then\r\nwe shall have gone far towards leaving behind us the futile hopes of\r\nmechanical perfection so constantly blasted by natural facts.\r\n\r\nThe invisible government is malign. But the evil doesn't come from the\r\nfact that it plays horse with the Newtonian theory of the constitution.\r\nWhat is dangerous about it is that we do not see it, cannot use it, and\r\nare compelled to submit to it. The nature of political power we shall not\r\nchange. If that is the way human societies organize sovereignty, the\r\nsooner we face that fact the better. For the object of democracy is not\r\nto imitate the rhythm of the stars but to harness political power to the\r\nnation's need. If corporations and governments have indeed gone on a joy\r\nride the business of reform is not to set up fences, Sherman Acts and\r\ninjunctions into which they can bump, but to take the wheel and to steer.\r\n\r\nThe corruption of which we hear so much is certainly not accounted for\r\nwhen you have called it dishonesty. It is too widespread for any such\r\nglib explanation. When you see how business controls politics, it\r\ncertainly is not very illuminating to call the successful business men of\r\na nation criminals. Yet I suppose that all of them violate the law. May\r\nnot this constant dodging or hurdling of statutes be a sign that there is\r\nsomething the matter with the statutes? Is it not possible that graft is\r\nthe cracking and bursting of the receptacles in which we have tried to\r\nconstrain the business of this country? It seems possible that business\r\nhas had to control politics because its laws were so stupidly\r\nobstructive. In the trust agitation this is especially plausible. For\r\nthere is every reason to believe that concentration is a world-wide\r\ntendency, made possible at first by mechanical inventions, fostered by\r\nthe disastrous experiences of competition, and accepted by business men\r\nthrough contagion and imitation. Certainly the trusts increase. Wherever\r\npolitics is rigid and hostile to that tendency, there is irritation and\r\nstruggle, but the agglomeration goes on. Hindered by political\r\nconditions, the process becomes secretive and morbid. The trust is not\r\nchecked, but it is perverted. In 1910 the \"American Banker\" estimated\r\nthat there were 1,198 corporations with 8,110 subsidiaries liable to all\r\nthe penalties of the Sherman Act. Now this concentration must represent a\r\nprofound impetus in the business world--an impetus which certainly cannot\r\nbe obliterated, even if anyone were foolish enough to wish it. I venture\r\nto suggest that much of what is called \"corruption\" is the odor of a\r\ndecaying political system done to death by an economic growth.\r\n\r\nIt is our desperate adherence to an old method that has produced the\r\nconfusion of political life. Because we have insisted upon looking at\r\ngovernment as a frame and governing as a routine, because in short we\r\nhave been static in our theories, politics has such an unreal relation to\r\nactual conditions. Feckless--that is what our politics is. It is\r\nliterally eccentric: it has been centered mechanically instead of\r\nvitally. We have, it seems, been seduced by a fictitious analogy: we have\r\nhoped for machine regularity when we needed human initiative and\r\nleadership, when life was crying that its inventive abilities should be\r\nfreed.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt in his term did much to center government truly. For a time\r\nnatural leadership and nominal position coincided, and the administration\r\nbecame in a measure a real sovereignty. The routine conception dwindled,\r\nand the Roosevelt appointees went at issues as problems to be solved.\r\nThey may have been mistaken: Roosevelt may be uncritical in his\r\njudgments. But the fact remains that the Roosevelt régime gave a new\r\nprestige to the Presidency by effecting through it the greatest release\r\nof political invention in a generation. Contrast it with the Taft\r\nadministration, and the quality is set in relief. Taft was the perfect\r\nroutineer trying to run government as automatically as possible. His\r\nsincerity consisted in utter respect for form: he denied himself whatever\r\nleadership he was capable of, and outwardly at least he tried to\r\n\"balance\" the government. His greatest passions seem to be purely\r\nadministrative and legal. The people did not like it. They said it was\r\ndead. They were right. They had grown accustomed to a humanly liberating\r\natmosphere in which formality was an instrument instead of an idol. They\r\nhad seen the Roosevelt influence adding to the resources of\r\nlife--irrigation, and waterways, conservation, the Panama Canal, the\r\n\"country life\" movement. They knew these things were achieved through\r\ninitiative that burst through formal restrictions, and they applauded\r\nwildly. It was only a taste, but it was a taste, a taste of what\r\ngovernment might be like.\r\n\r\nThe opposition was instructive. Apart from those who feared Roosevelt for\r\nselfish reasons, his enemies were men who loved an orderly adherence to\r\ntraditional methods. They shivered in the emotional gale; they obstructed\r\nand the gale became destructive. They felt that, along with obviously\r\ngood things, this sudden national fertility might breed a monster--that a\r\nleadership like Roosevelt's might indeed prove dangerous, as giving birth\r\nmay lead to death.\r\n\r\nWhat the methodically-minded do not see is that the sterility of a\r\nroutine is far more appalling. Not everyone may feel that to push out\r\ninto the untried, and take risks for big prizes, is worth while. Men will\r\ntell you that government has no business to undertake an adventure, to\r\nmake experiments. They think that safety lies in repetition, that if you\r\ndo nothing, nothing will be done to you. It's a mistake due to poverty of\r\nimagination and inability to learn from experience. Even the timidest\r\nsoul dare not \"stand pat.\" The indictment against mere routine in\r\ngovernment is a staggering one.\r\n\r\nFor while statesmen are pottering along doing the same thing year in,\r\nyear out, putting up the tariff one year and down the next, passing\r\nappropriation bills and recodifying laws, the real forces in the country\r\ndo not stand still. Vast changes, economic and psychological, take place,\r\nand these changes demand new guidance. But the routineers are always\r\nunprepared. It has become one of the grim trade jokes of innovators that\r\nthe one thing you can count upon is that the rulers will come to think\r\nthat they are the apex of human development. For a queer effect of\r\nresponsibility on men is that it makes them try to be as much like\r\nmachines as possible. Tammany itself becomes rigid when it is too\r\nsuccessful, and only defeat seems to give it new life. Success makes men\r\nrigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues; tired\r\nof the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism. But\r\nconditions change whether statesmen wish them to or not; society must\r\nhave new institutions to fit new wants, and all that rigid conservatism\r\ncan do is to make the transitions difficult. Violent revolutions may be\r\ncharged up to the unreadiness of statesmen. It is because they will not\r\nsee, or cannot see, that feudalism is dead, that chattel slavery is\r\nantiquated; it is because they have not the wisdom and the audacity to\r\nanticipate these great social changes; it is because they insist upon\r\nstanding pat that we have French Revolutions and Civil Wars.\r\n\r\nBut statesmen who had decided that at last men were to be the masters of\r\ntheir own history, instead of its victims, would face politics in a truly\r\nrevolutionary manner. It would give a new outlook to statesmanship,\r\nturning it from the mere preservation of order, the administration of\r\npolitical machinery and the guarding of ancient privilege to the\r\ninvention of new political forms, the prevision of social wants, and the\r\npreparation for new economic growths.\r\n\r\nSuch a statesmanship would in the '80's have prepared for the trust\r\nmovement. There would have been nothing miraculous in such foresight.\r\nStandard Oil was dominant by the beginning of the '80's, and\r\nconcentration had begun in sugar, steel and other basic industries. Here\r\nwas an economic tendency of revolutionary significance--the organization\r\nof business in a way that was bound to change the outlook of a whole\r\nnation. It had vast potentialities for good and evil--all it wanted was\r\nharnessing and directing. But the new thing did not fit into the little\r\noutlines and verbosities which served as a philosophy for our political\r\nhacks. So they gaped at it and let it run wild, called it names, and\r\nthrew stones at it. And by that time the force was too big for them. An\r\nalert statesmanship would have facilitated the process of concentration;\r\nwould have made provision for those who were cast aside; would have been\r\nan ally of trust building, and by that very fact it would have had an\r\ninternal grip on the trust--it would have kept the trust's inner workings\r\npublic; it could have bent the trust to social uses.\r\n\r\nThis is not mere wisdom after the event. In the '80's there were hundreds\r\nof thousands of people in the world who understood that the trust was a\r\nnatural economic growth. Karl Marx had proclaimed it some thirty years\r\nbefore, and it was a widely circulated idea. Is it asking too much of a\r\nstatesman if we expect him to know political theory and to balance it\r\nwith the facts he sees? By the '90's surely, the egregious folly of a\r\nSherman Anti-Trust Law should have been evident to any man who pretended\r\nto political leadership. Yet here it is the year 1912 and that monument\r\nof economic ignorance and superstition is still worshiped with the lips\r\nby two out of the three big national parties.\r\n\r\nAnother movement--like that of the trust--is gathering strength to-day.\r\nIt is the unification of wage-workers. We stand in relation to it as the\r\nmen of the '80's did to the trusts. It is the complement of that problem.\r\nIt also has vast potentialities for good and evil. It, too, demands\r\nunderstanding and direction. It, too, will not be stopped by hard names\r\nor injunctions.\r\n\r\nWhat we loosely call \"syndicalism\" is a tendency that no statesman can\r\noverlook to-day without earning the jeers of his children. This labor\r\nmovement has a destructive and constructive energy within it. On its\r\nbeneficent side it promises a new professional interest in work,\r\nself-education, and the co-operative management of industry. But this\r\ncreative power is constantly choked off because the unions are compelled\r\nto fight for their lives--the more opposition they meet the more you are\r\nlikely to see of sabotage, direct action, the grève perlée--the less\r\nchance there is for the educative forces to show themselves. Then, the\r\nmore violent syndicalism proves itself to be, the more hysterically we\r\nbait it in the usual vicious circle of ignorance.\r\n\r\nBut who amongst us is optimistic enough to hope that the men who sit in\r\nthe mighty positions are going to make a better show of themselves than\r\ntheir predecessors did over the trust problem? It strains hope a little\r\ntoo much. Those men in Washington, most of them lawyers, are so educated\r\nthat they are practically incapable of meeting a new condition. All their\r\ntraining plus all their natural ossification of mind is hostile to\r\ninvention. You cannot endow even the best machine with initiative; the\r\njolliest steam-roller will not plant flowers.\r\n\r\nThe thought-processes in Washington are too lumbering for the needs of\r\nthis nation. Against that evil muckraking ought to be directed. Those\r\nsenators and representatives are largely irrelevant; they are not\r\nconcerned with realities. Their dishonesties are comparatively\r\ninsignificant. The scorn of the public should be turned upon the\r\nemptiness of political thought, upon the fact that those men seem without\r\neven a conception of the nation's needs. And while they maunder along\r\nthey stifle the forces of life which are trying to break through. It was\r\nnothing but the insolence of the routineer that forced Gifford Pinchot\r\nout of the Forest Service. Pinchot in respect to his subject was a fine\r\npolitical inventor. But routine forced him out--into what?--into the moil\r\nand toil of fighting for offices, and there he has cut a poor figure\r\nindeed. You may say that he has had to spend his energy trying to find a\r\nchance to use his power. What a wanton waste of talent is that for a\r\ncivilized nation! Wiley is another case of the creative mind harassed by\r\nthe routineers. Judge Lindsey is another--a fine, constructive children's\r\njudge compelled to be a politician. And of our misuse of the Rockefellers\r\nand Carnegies--the retrospect is appalling. Here was industrial genius\r\nunquestionably beyond the ordinary. What did this nation do with it? It\r\nfound no public use for talent. It left that to operate in darkness--then\r\nopinion rose in an empty fury, made an outlaw of one and a platitudinous\r\nphilanthropist of the other. It could lynch one as a moral monster, when\r\nas a matter of fact his ideals were commonplace; it could proclaim one a\r\ngreat benefactor when in truth he was a rather dull old gentleman. Abused\r\nout of all reason or praised irrelevantly--the one thing this nation has\r\nnot been able to do with these men is to use their genius. It is this\r\nlife-sapping quality of our politics that should be fought--its wanton\r\nwaste of the initiatives we have--its stupid indifference.\r\n\r\nWe need a new sense of political values. These times require a different\r\norder of thinking. We cannot expect to meet our problems with a few\r\ninherited ideas, uncriticised assumptions, a foggy vocabulary, and a\r\nmachine philosophy. Our political thinking needs the infusion of\r\ncontemporary insights. The enormous vitality that is regenerating other\r\ninterests can be brought into the service of politics. Our primary care\r\nmust be to keep the habits of the mind flexible and adapted to the\r\nmovement of real life. The only way to control our destiny is to work\r\nwith it. In politics, at least, we stoop to conquer. There is no use, no\r\nheroism, in butting against the inevitable, yet nothing is entirely\r\ninevitable. There is always some choice, some opportunity for human\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy. It is far easier to treat life as if it were dead, men as\r\nif they were dolls. It is everlastingly difficult to keep the mind\r\nflexible and alert. The rule of thumb is not here. To follow the pace of\r\nliving requires enormous vigilance and sympathy. No one can write\r\nconclusively about it. Compared with this creative statesmanship, the\r\nadministering of a routine or the battle for a platitude is a very simple\r\naffair. But genuine politics is not an inhuman task. Part of the\r\ngenuineness is its unpretentious humanity. I am not creating the figure\r\nof an ideal statesman out of some inner fancy. That is just the deepest\r\nerror of our political thinking--to talk of politics without reference to\r\nhuman beings. The creative men appear in public life in spite of the cold\r\nblanket the politicians throw over them. Really statesmanlike things are\r\ndone, inventions are made. But this real achievement comes to us\r\nconfused, mixed with much that is contradictory. Political inventors are\r\nto-day largely unconscious of their purpose, and, so, defenceless against\r\nthe distraction of their routineer enemies.\r\n\r\nLacking a philosophy they are defenceless against their own inner\r\ntendency to sink into repetition. As a witty Frenchman remarked, many\r\ngeniuses become their own disciples. This is true when the attention is\r\nslack, and effort has lost its direction. We have elaborate governmental\r\nmechanisms--like the tariff, for example, which we go on making more\r\n\"scientific\" year in, year out--having long since lost sight of their\r\nhuman purpose. They may be defeating the very ends they were meant to\r\nserve. We cling to constitutions out of \"loyalty.\" We trudge in the\r\ntreadmill and call it love of our ancient institutions. We emulate the\r\nmule, that greatest of all routineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE TABOO\r\n\r\n\r\nOur government has certainly not measured up to expectations. Even\r\nchronic admirers of the \"balance\" and \"symmetry\" of the Constitution\r\nadmit either by word or deed that it did not foresee the whole history of\r\nthe American people. Poor bewildered statesmen, unused to any notion of\r\nchange, have seen the national life grow to a monstrous confusion and\r\nsprout monstrous evils by the way. Men and women clamored for remedies,\r\nvowed, shouted and insisted that their \"official servants\" do\r\nsomething--something statesmanlike--to abate so much evident wrong. But\r\ntheir representatives had very little more than a frock coat and a slogan\r\nas equipment for the task. Trained to interpret a constitution instead of\r\nlife, these statesmen faced with historic helplessness the vociferations\r\nof ministers, muckrakers, labor leaders, women's clubs, granges and\r\nreformers' leagues. Out of a tumultuous medley appeared the common theme\r\nof public opinion--that the leaders should lead, that the governors\r\nshould govern.\r\n\r\nThe trusts had appeared, labor was restless, vice seemed to be corrupting\r\nthe vitality of the nation. Statesmen had to do something. Their training\r\nwas legal and therefore utterly inadequate, but it was all they had. They\r\nbecame panicky and reverted to an ancient superstition. They forbade the\r\nexistence of evil by law. They made it anathema. They pronounced it\r\ndamnable. They threatened to club it. They issued a legislative curse,\r\nand called upon the district attorney to do the rest. They started out to\r\nabolish human instincts, check economic tendencies and repress social\r\nchanges by laws prohibiting them. They turned to this sanctified\r\nignorance which is rampant in almost any nursery, which presides at\r\nfamily councils, flourishes among \"reformers\"; which from time immemorial\r\nhas haunted legislatures and courts. Under the spell of it men try to\r\nstop drunkenness by closing the saloons; when poolrooms shock them they\r\ncall a policeman; if Haywood becomes annoying, they procure an\r\ninjunction. They meet the evils of dance halls by barricading them; they\r\ngo forth to battle against vice by raiding brothels and fining\r\nprostitutes. For trusts there is a Sherman Act. In spite of all\r\nexperience they cling desperately to these superstitions.\r\n\r\nIt is the method of the taboo, as naïve as barbarism, as ancient as human\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThere is a law against suicide. It is illegal for a man to kill himself.\r\nWhat it means in practice, of course, is that there is punishment waiting\r\nfor a man who doesn't succeed in killing himself. We say to the man who\r\nis tired of life that if he bungles we propose to make this world still\r\nless attractive by clapping him into jail. I know an economist who has a\r\nscheme for keeping down the population by refusing very poor people a\r\nmarriage license. He used to teach Sunday school and deplore promiscuity.\r\nIn the annual report of the president of a distilling company I once saw\r\nthe statement that business had increased in the \"dry\" states. In a\r\nprohibition town where I lived you could drink all you wanted by\r\nbelonging to a \"club\" or winking at the druggist. And in another city\r\nwhere Sunday closing was strictly enforced, a minister told me with\r\npainful surprise that the Monday police blotter showed less drunks and\r\nmore wife-beaters.\r\n\r\nWe pass a law against race-track gambling and add to the profits from\r\nfaro. We raid the faro joints, and drive gambling into the home, where\r\npoker and bridge whist are taught to children who follow their parents'\r\nexample. We deprive anarchists of free speech by the heavy hand of a\r\npolice magistrate, and furnish them with a practical instead of a\r\ntheoretical argument against government. We answer strikes with bayonets,\r\nand make treason one of the rights of man.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that when you close the dance halls you fill the parks.\r\nMen who in their youth took part in \"crusades\" against the Tenderloin now\r\nadmit in a crestfallen way that they succeeded merely in sprinkling the\r\nTenderloin through the whole city. Over twenty years ago we formulated a\r\nsweeping taboo against trusts. Those same twenty years mark the\r\ncentralization of industry.\r\n\r\nThe routineer in a panic turns to the taboo. Whatever does not fit into\r\nhis rigid little scheme of things must have its head chopped off. Now\r\nhuman nature and the changing social forces it generates are the very\r\nmaterial which fit least well into most little schemes of things. A man\r\ncannot sleep in his cradle: whatever is useful must in the nature of life\r\nbecome useless. We employ our instruments and abandon them. But nothing\r\nso simply true as that prevails in politics. When a government routine\r\nconflicts with the nation's purposes--the statesman actually makes a\r\nvirtue of his loyalty to the routine. His practice is to ignore human\r\ncharacter and pay no attention to social forces. The shallow presumption\r\nis that undomesticated impulses can be obliterated; that world-wide\r\neconomic inventions can be stamped out by jailing millionaires--and\r\nacting in the spirit of Mr. Chesterton's man Fipps \"who went mad and ran\r\nabout the country with an axe, hacking branches off the trees whenever\r\nthere were not the same number on both sides.\" The routineer is, of\r\ncourse, the first to decry every radical proposal as \"against human\r\nnature.\" But the stand-pat mind has forfeited all right to speak for\r\nhuman nature. It has devoted the centuries to torturing men's instincts,\r\nstamping on them, passing laws against them, lifting its eyebrows at the\r\nthought of them--doing everything but trying to understand them. The same\r\npeople who with daily insistence say that innovators ignore facts are in\r\nthe absurd predicament of trying to still human wants with petty taboos.\r\nSocial systems like ours, which do not even feed and house men and women,\r\nwhich deny pleasure, cramp play, ban adventure, propose celibacy and\r\ngrind out monotony, are a clear confession of sterility in statesmanship.\r\nAnd politics, however pretentiously rhetorical about ideals, is\r\nirrelevant if the only method it knows is to ostracize the desires it\r\ncannot manage.\r\n\r\nSuppose that statesmen transferred their reverence from the precedents\r\nand mistakes of their ancestors to the human material which they have set\r\nout to govern. Suppose they looked mankind in the face and asked\r\nthemselves what was the result of answering evil with a prohibition. Such\r\nan exercise would, I fear, involve a considerable strain on what\r\nreformers call their moral sensibilities. For human nature is a rather\r\nshocking affair if you come to it with ordinary romantic optimism.\r\nCertainly the human nature that figures in most political thinking is a\r\nwraith that never was--not even in the souls of politicians. \"Idealism\"\r\ncreates an abstraction and then shudders at a reality which does not\r\nanswer to it. Now statesmen who have set out to deal with actual life\r\nmust deal with actual people. They cannot afford an inclusive pessimism\r\nabout mankind. Let them have the consistency and good sense to cease\r\nbothering about men if men's desires seem intrinsically evil. Moral\r\njudgment about the ultimate quality of character is dangerous to a\r\npolitician. He is too constantly tempted to call a policeman when he\r\ndisapproves.\r\n\r\nWe must study our failures. Gambling and drink, for example, produce much\r\nmisery. But what reformers have to learn is that men don't gamble just\r\nfor the sake of violating the law. They do so because something within\r\nthem is satisfied by betting or drinking. To erect a ban doesn't stop the\r\nwant. It merely prevents its satisfaction. And since this desire for\r\nstimulants or taking a chance at a prize is older and far more deeply\r\nrooted in the nature of men than love of the Prohibition Party or\r\nreverence for laws made at Albany, people will contrive to drink and\r\ngamble in spite of the acts of a legislature.\r\n\r\nA man may take liquor for a variety of reasons: he may be thirsty; or\r\ndepressed; or unusually happy; he may want the companionship of a saloon,\r\nor he may hope to forget a scolding wife. Perhaps he needs a \"bracer\" in\r\na weary hunt for a job. Perhaps he has a terrible craving for alcohol. He\r\ndoes not take a drink so that he may become an habitual drunkard, or be\r\nlocked up in jail, or get into a brawl, or lose his job, or go insane.\r\nThese are what he might call the unfortunate by-products of his desire.\r\nIf once he could find something which would do for him what liquor does,\r\nwithout hurting him as liquor does, there would be no problem of drink.\r\nBernard Shaw says he has found that substitute in going to church when\r\nthere's no service. Goethe wrote \"The Sorrows of Werther\" in order to get\r\nrid of his own. Many an unhappy lover has found peace by expressing his\r\nmisery in sonnet form. The problem is to find something for the common\r\nman who is not interested in contemporary churches and who can't write\r\nsonnets.\r\n\r\nWhen the socialists in Milwaukee began to experiment with municipal\r\ndances they were greeted with indignant protests from the \"anti-vice\"\r\nelement and with amused contempt by the newspaper paragraphers. The\r\ndances were discontinued, and so the belief in their failure is complete.\r\nI think, though, that Mayor Seidel's defense would by itself make this\r\nexperiment memorable. He admitted freely the worst that can be said\r\nagainst the ordinary dance hall. So far he was with the petty reformers.\r\nThen he pointed out with considerable vehemence that dance halls were an\r\nurgent social necessity. At that point he had transcended the mind of the\r\npetty reformer completely. \"We propose,\" said Seidel, \"to go into\r\ncompetition with the devil.\"\r\n\r\nNothing deeper has come from an American mayor in a long, long time. It\r\nis the point that Jane Addams makes in the opening pages of that wisely\r\nsweet book, \"The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets.\" She calls\r\nattention to the fact that the modern state has failed to provide for\r\npleasure. \"This stupid experiment,\" she writes, \"of organizing work and\r\nfailing to organize play has, of course, brought about a fine revenge.\r\nThe love of pleasure will not be denied, and when it has turned into all\r\nsorts of malignant and vicious appetites, then we, the middle-aged, grow\r\nquite distracted and resort to all sorts of restrictive measures.\"\r\n\r\nFor human nature seems to have wants that must be filled. If nobody else\r\nsupplies them, the devil will. The demand for pleasure, adventure,\r\nromance has been left to the devil's catering for so long a time that\r\nmost people think he inspires the demand. He doesn't. Our neglect is the\r\ndevil's opportunity. What we should use, we let him abuse, and the\r\ncorruption of the best things, as Hume remarked, produces the worst.\r\nPleasure in our cities has become tied to lobster palaces, adventure to\r\nexalted murderers, romance to silly, mooning novels. Like the flower girl\r\nin Galsworthy's play, we have made a very considerable confusion of the\r\nlife of joy and the joy of life. The first impulse is to abolish all\r\nlobster palaces, melodramas, yellow newspapers, and sentimentally erotic\r\nnovels. Why not abolish all the devil's works? the reformer wonders. The\r\nanswer is in history. It can't be done that way. It is impossible to\r\nabolish either with a law or an axe the desires of men. It is dangerous,\r\nexplosively dangerous, to thwart them for any length of time. The\r\nPuritans tried to choke the craving for pleasure in early New England.\r\nThey had no theaters, no dances, no festivals. They burned witches\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nWe rail a good deal against Tammany Hall. Reform tickets make periodic\r\nsallies against it, crying economy, efficiency, and a business\r\nadministration. And we all pretend to be enormously surprised when the\r\n\"ignorant foreign vote\" prefers a corrupt political ring to a party of\r\nwell-dressed, grammatical, and high-minded gentlemen. Some of us are even\r\nrather downcast about democracy because the Bowery doesn't take to heart\r\nthe admonitions of the Evening Post.\r\n\r\nWe forget completely the important wants supplied by Tammany Hall. We\r\nforget that this is a lonely country for an immigrant and that the Statue\r\nof Liberty doesn't shed her light with too much warmth. Possessing\r\nnothing but a statistical, inhuman conception of government, the average\r\nmunicipal reformer looks down contemptuously upon a man like Tim Sullivan\r\nwith his clambakes and his dances; his warm and friendly saloons, his\r\nhandshaking and funeral-going and baby-christening; his readiness to get\r\ncoal for the family, and a job for the husband. But a Tim Sullivan is\r\ncloser to the heart of statesmanship than five City Clubs full of people\r\nwho want low taxes and orderly bookkeeping. He does things which have to\r\nbe done. He humanizes a strange country; he is a friend at court; he\r\nrepresents the legitimate kindliness of government, standing between the\r\npoor and the impersonal, uninviting majesty of the law. Let no man wonder\r\nthat Lorimer's people do not prefer an efficiency expert, that a Tim\r\nSullivan has power, or that men are loyal to Hinky Dink. The cry raised\r\nagainst these men by the average reformer is a piece of cold, unreal,\r\npreposterous idealism compared to the solid warm facts of kindliness,\r\nclothes, food and fun.\r\n\r\nYou cannot beat the bosses with the reformer's taboo. You will not get\r\nfar on the Bowery with the cost unit system and low taxes. And I don't\r\nblame the Bowery. You can beat Tammany Hall permanently in one way--by\r\nmaking the government of a city as human, as kindly, as jolly as Tammany\r\nHall. I am aware of the contract-grafts, the franchise-steals, the dirty\r\nstreets, the bribing and the blackmail, the vice-and-crime partnerships,\r\nthe Big Business alliances of Tammany Hall. And yet it seems to me that\r\nTammany has a better perception of human need, and comes nearer to being\r\nwhat a government should be, than any scheme yet proposed by a group of\r\n\"uptown good government\" enthusiasts. Tammany is not a satanic instrument\r\nof deception, cleverly devised to thwart \"the will of the people.\" It is\r\na crude and largely unconscious answer to certain immediate needs, and\r\nwithout those needs its power would crumble. That is why I ventured in\r\nthe preceding chapter to describe it as a natural sovereignty which had\r\ngrown up behind a mechanical form of government. It is a poor weed\r\ncompared to what government might be. But it is a real government that\r\nhas power and serves a want, and not a frame imposed upon men from on\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe taboo--the merely negative law--is the emptiest of all the\r\nimpositions from on top. In its long record of failure, in the\r\ncomparative success of Tammany, those who are aiming at social changes\r\ncan see a profound lesson; the impulses, cravings and wants of men must\r\nbe employed. You can employ them well or ill, but you must employ them. A\r\ngroup of reformers lounging at a club cannot, dare not, decide to close\r\nup another man's club because it is called a saloon. Unless the reformer\r\ncan invent something which substitutes attractive virtues for attractive\r\nvices, he will fail. He will fail because human nature abhors the vacuum\r\ncreated by the taboo.\r\n\r\nAn incident in the international peace propaganda illuminates this point.\r\nNot long ago a meeting in Carnegie Hall, New York, to forward peace among\r\nnations broke up in great disorder. Thousands of people who hate the\r\nwaste and futility of war as much as any of the orators of that evening\r\nwere filled with an unholy glee. They chuckled with delight at the idea\r\nof a riot in a peace meeting. Though it would have seemed perverse to the\r\nordinary pacificist, this sentiment sprang from a respectable source. It\r\nhad the same ground as the instinctive feeling of nine men in ten that\r\nRoosevelt has more right to talk about peace than William Howard Taft.\r\nJames made it articulate in his essay on \"The Moral Equivalent of War.\"\r\nJames was a great advocate of peace, but he understood Theodore Roosevelt\r\nand he spoke for the military man when he wrote of war that: \"Its\r\n'horrors' are a cheap price to pay for rescue from the only alternative\r\nsupposed, of a world of clerks and teachers, of co-education and\r\nzo-ophily, of 'consumers' leagues' and 'associated charities,' of\r\nindustrialism unlimited, and feminism unabashed. No scorn, no hardness,\r\nno valor any more! Fie upon such a cattleyard of a planet!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added: \"So far as the central essence of this feeling goes, no\r\nhealthy minded person, it seems to me, can help to some degree partaking\r\nof it. Militarism is the great preserver of our ideals of hardihood, and\r\nhuman life with no use for hardihood would be contemptible. Without risks\r\nor prizes for the darer, history would be insipid indeed; and there is a\r\ntype of military character which everyone feels that the race should\r\nnever cease to breed, for everyone is sensitive to its superiority.\"\r\n\r\nSo William James proposed not the abolition of war, but a moral\r\nequivalent for it. He dreamed of \"a conscription of the whole youthful\r\npopulation to form for a certain number of years a part of the army\r\nenlisted against _Nature_.... The military ideals of hardihood and\r\ndiscipline would be wrought into the growing fibre of the people; no one\r\nwould remain blind, as the luxurious classes now are blind, to man's\r\nrelations to the globe he lives on, and to the permanently sour and hard\r\nfoundations of his higher life.\" Now we are not concerned here over the\r\nquestion of this particular proposal. The telling point in my opinion is\r\nthis: that when a wise man, a student of human nature, and a reformer met\r\nin the same person, the taboo was abandoned. James has given us a lasting\r\nphrase when he speaks of the \"moral equivalent\" of evil. We can use it, I\r\nbelieve, as a guide post to statesmanship. Rightly understood, the idea\r\nbehind the words contains all that is valuable in conservatism, and, for\r\nthe first time, gives a reputable meaning to that tortured epithet\r\n\"constructive.\"\r\n\r\n\"The military feelings,\" says James, \"are too deeply grounded to abdicate\r\ntheir place among our ideals until better substitutes are offered ...\r\nsuch a conscription, with the state of public opinion that would have\r\nrequired it, and the many moral fruits it would bear, would preserve in\r\nthe midst of a pacific civilization the manly virtues which the military\r\nparty is so afraid of seeing disappear in peace.... So far, war has been\r\nthe only force that can discipline a whole community, and until an\r\nequivalent discipline is organized I believe that war must have its way.\r\nBut I have no serious doubt that the ordinary prides and shames of social\r\nman, once developed to a certain intensity, are capable of organizing\r\nsuch a moral equivalent as I have sketched, or some other just as\r\neffective for preserving manliness of type. It is but a question of time,\r\nof skilful propagandism, and of opinion-making men seizing historic\r\nopportunities. The martial type of character can be bred without war.\"\r\n\r\nTo find for evil its moral equivalent is to be conservative about values\r\nand radical about forms, to turn to the establishment of positively good\r\nthings instead of trying simply to check bad ones, to emphasize the\r\nadditions to life, instead of the restrictions upon it, to substitute, if\r\nyou like, the love of heaven for the fear of hell. Such a program means\r\nthe dignified utilization of the whole nature of man. It will recognize\r\nas the first test of all political systems and moral codes whether or not\r\nthey are \"against human nature.\" It will insist that they be cut to fit\r\nthe whole man, not merely a part of him. For there are utopian proposals\r\nmade every day which cover about as much of a human being as a beautiful\r\nhat does.\r\n\r\nInstead of tabooing our impulses, we must redirect them. Instead of\r\ntrying to crush badness we must turn the power behind it to good account.\r\nThe assumption is that every lust is capable of some civilized\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nWe say, in effect, that evil is a way by which desire expresses itself.\r\nThe older moralists, the taboo philosophers believed that the desires\r\nthemselves were inherently evil. To us they are the energies of the soul,\r\nneither good nor bad in themselves. Like dynamite, they are capable of\r\nall sorts of uses, and it is the business of civilization, through the\r\nfamily and the school, religion, art, science, and all institutions, to\r\ntransmute these energies into fine values. Behind evil there is power,\r\nand it is folly,--wasting and disappointing folly,--to ignore this power\r\nbecause it has found an evil issue. All that is dynamic in human\r\ncharacter is in these rooted lusts. The great error of the taboo has been\r\njust this: that it believed each desire had only one expression, that if\r\nthat expression was evil the desire itself was evil. We know a little\r\nbetter to-day. We know that it is possible to harness desire to many\r\ninterests, that evil is one form of a desire, and not the nature of it.\r\n\r\nThis supplies us with a standard for judging reforms, and so makes clear\r\nwhat \"constructive\" action really is. When it was discovered recently\r\nthat the boys' gang was not an unmitigated nuisance to be chased by a\r\npoliceman, but a force that could be made valuable to civilization\r\nthrough the Boy Scouts, a really constructive reform was given to the\r\nworld. The effervescence of boys on the street, wasted and perverted\r\nthrough neglect or persecution, was drained and applied to fine uses.\r\nWhen Percy MacKaye pleads for pageants in which the people themselves\r\nparticipate, he offers an opportunity for expressing some of the lusts of\r\nthe city in the form of an art. The Freudian school of psychologists\r\ncalls this \"sublimation.\" They have brought forward a wealth of material\r\nwhich gives us every reason to believe that the theory of \"moral\r\nequivalents\" is soundly based, that much the same energies produce crime\r\nand civilization, art, vice, insanity, love, lust, and religion. In each\r\nindividual the original differences are small. Training and opportunity\r\ndecide in the main how men's lust shall emerge. Left to themselves, or\r\nignorantly tabooed, they break forth in some barbaric or morbid form.\r\nOnly by supplying our passions with civilized interests can we escape\r\ntheir destructive force.\r\n\r\nI have put it negatively, as a counsel of prudence. But he who has the\r\ncourage of existence will put it triumphantly, crying \"yea\" as Nietzsche\r\ndid, and recognizing that all the passions of men are the motive powers\r\nof a fine life.\r\n\r\nFor the roads that lead to heaven and hell are one until they part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGING FOCUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe taboo, however useless, is at least concrete. Although it achieves\r\nlittle besides mischief, it has all the appearance of practical action,\r\nand consequently enlists the enthusiasm of those people whom Wells\r\ndescribes as rushing about the country shouting: \"For Gawd's sake let's\r\n_do_ something _now_.\" There are weight and solidity in a policeman's\r\nclub, while a \"moral equivalent\" happens to be pale like the stuff of\r\nwhich dreams are made. To the politician whose daily life consists in\r\ndodging the thousand and one conflicting prejudices of his constituents,\r\nin bickering with committees, intriguing and playing for the vote; to the\r\nbusiness man harassed on four sides by the trust, the union, the law, and\r\npublic opinion,--distrustful of any wide scheme because the stupidity of\r\nhis shipping clerk is the most vivid item in his mind, all this\r\ndiscussion about politics and the inner life will sound like so much\r\nfine-spun nonsense.\r\n\r\nI, for one, am not disposed to blame the politicians and the business\r\nmen. They govern the nation, it is true, but they do it in a rather\r\nabsentminded fashion. Those revolutionists who see the misery of the\r\ncountry as a deliberate and fiendish plot overestimate the bad will, the\r\nintelligence and the singleness of purpose in the ruling classes.\r\nBusiness and political leaders don't mean badly; the trouble with them is\r\nthat most of the time they don't mean anything. They picture themselves\r\nas very \"practical,\" which in practice amounts to saying that nothing\r\nmakes them feel so spiritually homeless as the discussion of values and\r\nan invitation to examine first principles. Ideas, most of the time, cause\r\nthem genuine distress, and are as disconcerting as an idle office boy, or\r\na squeaky telephone.\r\n\r\nI do not underestimate the troubles of the man of affairs. I have lived\r\nwith politicians,--with socialist politicians whose good-will was\r\nabundant and intentions constructive. The petty vexations pile up into\r\nmountains; the distracting details scatter the attention and break up\r\nthinking, while the mere problem of exercising power crowds out\r\nspeculation about what to do with it. Personal jealousies interrupt\r\nco-ordinated effort; committee sessions wear out nerves by their aimless\r\ndrifting; constant speech-making turns a man back upon a convenient\r\nlittle store of platitudes--misunderstanding and distortion dry up the\r\nimagination, make thought timid and expression flat, the atmosphere of\r\npublicity requires a mask which soon becomes the reality. Politicians\r\ntend to live \"in character,\" and many a public figure has come to imitate\r\nthe journalism which describes him. You cannot blame politicians if their\r\nperceptions are few and their thinking crude.\r\n\r\nFootball strategy does not originate in a scrimmage: it is useless to\r\nexpect solutions in a political campaign. Woodrow Wilson brought to\r\npublic life an exceedingly flexible mind,--many of us when he first\r\nemerged rejoiced at the clean and athletic quality of his thinking. But\r\neven he under the stress of a campaign slackened into commonplace\r\nreiteration, accepting a futile and intellectually dishonest platform,\r\nclosing his eyes to facts, misrepresenting his opponents, abandoning, in\r\nshort, the very qualities which distinguished him. It is understandable.\r\nWhen a National Committee puts a megaphone to a man's mouth and tells him\r\nto yell, it is difficult for him to hear anything.\r\n\r\nIf a nation's destiny were really bound up with the politics reported in\r\nnewspapers, the impasse would be discouraging. If the important\r\nsovereignty of a country were in what is called its parliamentary life,\r\nthen the day of Plato's philosopher-kings would be far off indeed.\r\nCertainly nobody expects our politicians to become philosophers. When\r\nthey do they hide the fact. And when philosophers try to be politicians\r\nthey generally cease to be philosophers. But the truth is that we\r\noverestimate enormously the importance of nominations, campaigns, and\r\noffice-holding. If we are discouraged it is because we tend to identify\r\nstatecraft with that official government which is merely one of its\r\ninstruments. Vastly over-advertised, we have mistaken an inflated fragment\r\nfor the real political life of the country.\r\n\r\nFor if you think of men and their welfare, government appears at once as\r\nnothing but an agent among many others. The task of civilizing our\r\nimpulses by creating fine opportunities for their expression cannot be\r\naccomplished through the City Hall alone. All the influences of social\r\nlife are needed. The eggs do not lie in one basket. Thus the issues in\r\nthe trade unions may be far more directly important to statecraft than\r\nthe destiny of the Republican Party. The power that workingmen generate\r\nwhen they unite--the demands they will make and the tactics they will\r\npursue--how they are educating themselves and the nation--these are\r\ngenuine issues which bear upon the future. So with the policies of\r\nbusiness men. Whether financiers are to be sullen and stupid like\r\nArchbold, defiant like Morgan, or well-intentioned like Perkins is a\r\nquestion that enters deeply into the industrial issues. The whole\r\nbusiness problem takes on a new complexion if the representatives of\r\ncapital are to be men with the temper of Louis Brandeis or William C.\r\nRedfield. For when business careers are made professional, new motives\r\nenter into the situation; it will make a world of difference if the\r\nleadership of industry is in the hands of men interested in production as\r\na creative art instead of as a brute exploitation. The economic conflicts\r\nare at once raised to a plane of research, experiment and honest\r\ndeliberation. For on the level of hate and mean-seeking no solution is\r\npossible. That subtle fact,--the change of business motives, the\r\ndemonstration that industry can be conducted as medicine is,--may\r\ncivilize the whole class conflict.\r\n\r\nObviously statecraft is concerned with such a change, extra-political\r\nthough it is. And wherever the politician through his prestige or the\r\ngovernment through its universities can stimulate a revolution in\r\nbusiness motives, it should do so. That is genuinely constructive work,\r\nand will do more to a humane solution of the class struggle than all the\r\njails and state constabularies that ever betrayed the barbarism of the\r\nTwentieth Century. It is no wonder that business is such a sordid affair.\r\nWe have done our best to exclude from it every passionate interest that\r\nis capable of lighting up activity with eagerness and joy.\r\n\"Unbusinesslike\" we have called the devotion of craftsmen and scientists.\r\nWe have actually pretended that the work of extracting a living from\r\nnature could be done most successfully by short-sighted money-makers\r\nencouraged by their money-spending wives. We are learning better to-day.\r\nWe are beginning to know that this nation for all its boasts has not\r\ntouched the real possibilities of business success, that nature and good\r\nluck have done most of our work, that our achievements come in spite of\r\nour ignorance. And so no man can gauge the civilizing possibilities of a\r\nnew set of motives in business. That it will add to the dignity and value\r\nof millions of careers is only one of its blessings. Given a nation of\r\nmen trained to think scientifically about their work and feel about it as\r\ncraftsmen, and you have a people released from a stupid fixation upon the\r\nsilly little ideals of accumulating dollars and filling their neighbor's\r\neye. We preach against commercialism but without great result. And the\r\nreason for our failure is: that we merely say \"you ought not\" instead of\r\noffering a new interest. Instead of telling business men not to be\r\ngreedy, we should tell them to be industrial statesmen, applied\r\nscientists, and members of a craft. Politics can aid that revolution in a\r\nhundred Ways: by advocating it, by furnishing schools that teach,\r\nlaboratories that demonstrate, by putting business on the same plane of\r\ninterest as the Health Service.\r\n\r\nThe indictment against politics to-day is not its corruption, but its\r\nlack of insight. I believe it is a fact which experience will sustain\r\nthat men steal because they haven't anything better to do. You don't have\r\nto preach honesty to men with a creative purpose. Let a human being throw\r\nthe energies of his soul into the making of something, and the instinct\r\nof workmanship will take care of his honesty. The writers who have\r\nnothing to say are the ones that you can buy: the others have too high a\r\nprice. A genuine craftsman will not adulterate his product: the reason\r\nisn't because duty says he shouldn't, but because passion says he\r\ncouldn't. I suggested in an earlier chapter that the issue of honesty and\r\ndishonesty was a futile one, and I placed faith in the creative men. They\r\nhate shams and the watering of goods on a more trustworthy basis than the\r\nmere routine moralist. To them dishonesty is a contradiction of their own\r\nlusts, and they ask no credit, need none, for being true. Creation is an\r\nemotional ascent, which makes the standard vices trivial, and turns all\r\nthat is valuable in virtue to the service of desire.\r\n\r\nWhen politics revolves mechanically it ceases to use the real energies of\r\na nation. Government is then at once irrelevant and mischievous--a mere\r\nobstructive nuisance. Not long ago a prominent senator remarked that he\r\ndidn't know much about the country, because he had spent the last few\r\nmonths in Washington. It was a profound utterance as anyone can testify\r\nwho reads, let us say, the Congressional Record. For that document,\r\nthough replete with language, is singularly unacquainted with the forces\r\nthat agitate the nation. Politics, as the contributors to the\r\nCongressional Record seem to understand it, is a very limited selection\r\nof well-worn debates on a few arbitrarily chosen \"problems.\" Those\r\nquestions have developed a technique and an interest in them for their\r\nown sake. They are handled with a dull solemnity quite out of proportion\r\nto their real interest. Labor receives only a perfunctory and largely\r\ndisingenuous attention; even commerce is handled in a way that expresses\r\nneither its direction nor its public use. Congress has been ready enough\r\nto grant favors to corporations, but where in its wrangling from the\r\nSherman Act to the Commerce Court has it shown any sympathetic\r\nunderstanding of the constructive purposes in the trust movement? It has\r\neither presented the business man with money or harassed him with\r\nbungling enthusiasm in the pretended interests of the consumer. The one\r\nthing Congress has not done is to use the talents of business men for the\r\nnation's advantage.\r\n\r\nIf \"politics\" has been indifferent to forces like the union and the\r\ntrust, it is no exaggeration to say that it has displayed a modest\r\nignorance of women's problems, of educational conflicts and racial\r\naspirations; of the control of newspapers and magazines, the book\r\npublishing world, socialist conventions and unofficial political groups\r\nlike the single-taxers.\r\n\r\nSuch genuine powers do not absorb our political interest because we are\r\nfooled by the regalia of office. But statesmanship, if it is to be\r\nrelevant, would obtain a new perspective on these dynamic currents, would\r\nfind out the wants they express and the energies they contain, would\r\nshape and direct and guide them. For unions and trusts, sects, clubs and\r\nvoluntary associations stand for actual needs. The size of their\r\nfollowing, the intensity of their demands are a fair index of what the\r\nstatesman must think about. No lawyer created a trust though he drew up\r\nits charter; no logician made the labor movement or the feminist\r\nagitation. If you ask what for political purposes a nation is, a\r\npractical answer would be: it is its \"movements.\" They are the social\r\n_life_. So far as the future is man-made it is made of them. They show\r\ntheir real vitality by a relentless growth in spite of all the little\r\nfences and obstacles that foolish politicians devise.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, much that is dead within the movements. Each one\r\ncarries along a quantity of inert and outworn ideas,--not infrequently\r\nthere is an internally contradictory current. Thus the very workingmen\r\nwho agitate for a better diffusion of wealth display a marked hostility\r\nto improvements in the production of it. The feminists too have their\r\natavisms: not a few who object to the patriarchal family seem inclined to\r\ncure it by going back still more--to the matriarchal. Constructive\r\nbusiness has no end of reactionary moments----the most striking, perhaps,\r\nis when it buys up patents in order to suppress them. Yet these\r\ninversions, though discouraging, are not essential in the life of\r\nmovements. They need to be expurgated by an unceasing criticism; yet in\r\nbulk the forces I have mentioned, and many others less important, carry\r\nwith them the creative powers of our times.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that so many political inventions have been made\r\nwithin these movements, fostered by them, and brought to a general public\r\nnotice through their efforts. When some constructive proposal is being\r\nagitated before a legislative committee, it is customary to unite the\r\n\"movements\" in support of it. Trade unions and women's clubs have joined\r\nhands in many an agitation. There are proposals to-day, like the minimum\r\nwage, which seem sure of support from consumers' leagues, women's\r\nfederations, trade unions and those far-sighted business men who may be\r\ncalled \"State Socialists.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, unless a political invention is woven into a social movement it\r\nhas no importance. Only when that is done is it imbued with life. But how\r\namong countless suggestions is a \"cause\" to know the difference between a\r\ntrue invention and a pipe-dream? There is, of course, no infallible\r\ntouchstone by which we can tell offhand. No one need hope for an easy\r\ncertainty either here or anywhere else in human affairs. No one is\r\nabsolved from experiment and constant revision. Yet there are some\r\nhypotheses that prima facie deserve more attention than others.\r\n\r\nThose are the suggestions which come out of a recognized human need. If a\r\nman proposed that the judges of the Supreme Court be reduced from nine to\r\nseven because the number seven has mystical power, we could ignore him.\r\nBut if he suggested that the number be reduced because seven men can\r\ndeliberate more effectively than nine he ought to be given a hearing. Or\r\nlet us suppose that the argument is about granting votes to women. The\r\nsuffragist who bases a claim on the so-called \"logic of democracy\" is\r\nmaking the poorest possible showing for a good cause. I have heard people\r\nmaintain that: \"it makes no difference whether women want the ballot, or\r\nare fit for it, or can do any good with it,--this country is a democracy.\r\nDemocracy means government by the votes of the people. Women are people.\r\nTherefore women should vote.\" That in a very simple form is the\r\nmechanical conception of government. For notice how it ignores human\r\nwants and human powers--how it subordinates people to a rigid formula. I\r\nuse this crude example because it shows that even the most genuine and\r\ndeeply grounded demands are as yet unable to free themselves entirely\r\nfrom a superficial manner of thinking. We are only partially emancipated\r\nfrom the mechanical and merely logical tradition of the Eighteenth\r\nCentury. No end of illustrations could be adduced. In the Socialist party\r\nit has been the custom to denounce the \"short ballot.\" Why? Because it\r\nreduces the number of elective offices. This is regarded as undemocratic\r\nfor the reason that democracy has come to mean a series of elections.\r\nAccording to a logic, the more elections the more democratic. But\r\nexperience has shown that a seven-foot ballot with a regiment of names is\r\nso bewildering that a real choice is impossible. So it is proposed to cut\r\ndown the number of elective offices, focus the attention on a few\r\nalternatives, and turn voting into a fairly intelligent performance. Here\r\nis an attempt to fit political devices to the actual powers of the voter.\r\nThe old, crude form of ballot forgot that finite beings had to operate\r\nit. But the \"democrats\" adhere to the multitude of choices because\r\n\"logic\" requires them to.\r\n\r\nThis incident of the \"short ballot\" illustrates the cleavage between\r\ninvention and routine. The socialists oppose it not because their\r\nintentions are bad but because on this issue their thinking is\r\nmechanical. Instead of applying the test of human need, they apply a\r\nverbal and logical consistency. The \"short ballot\" in itself is a slight\r\naffair, but the insight behind it seems to me capable of revolutionary\r\ndevelopment. It is one symptom of the effort to found institutions on\r\nhuman nature. There are many others. We might point to the first\r\nexperiments aimed at remedying the helter-skelter of careers by\r\nvocational guidance. Carried through successfully, this invention of\r\nProf. Parsons' is one whose significance in happiness can hardly be\r\nexaggerated. When you think of the misfits among your acquaintances--the\r\nlawyers who should be mechanics, the doctors who should be business men,\r\nthe teachers who should have been clerks, and the executives who should\r\nbe doing research in a laboratory--when you think of the talent that\r\nwould be released by proper use, the imagination takes wing at the\r\npossibilities. What could we not make of the world if we employed its\r\ngenius!\r\n\r\nWhoever is working to express special energies is part of a constructive\r\nrevolution. Whoever is removing the stunting environments of our\r\noccupations is doing the fundamentals of reform. The studies of Miss\r\nGoldmark of industrial fatigue, recuperative power and maximum\r\nproductivity are contributions toward that distant and desirable period\r\nwhen labor shall be a free and joyous activity. Every suggestion which\r\nturns work from a drudgery to a craft is worth our deepest interest. For\r\nuntil then the labor problem will never be solved. The socialist demand\r\nfor a better distribution of wealth is of great consequence, but without\r\na change in the very nature of labor society will not have achieved the\r\nhappiness it expects. That is why imaginative socialists have shown so\r\ngreat an interest in \"syndicalism.\" There at least in some of its forms,\r\nwe can catch sight of a desire to make all labor a self-governing craft.\r\n\r\nThe handling of crime has been touched by the modern impetus. The\r\nancient, abstract and wholesale \"justice\" is breaking up into detailed\r\nand carefully adapted treatment of individual offenders. What this means\r\nfor the child has become common knowledge in late years. Criminology (to\r\nuse an awkward word) is finding a human center. So is education. Everyone\r\nknows how child study is revolutionizing the school room and the\r\ncurriculum. Why, it seems that Mme. Montessori has had the audacity to\r\nsacrifice the sacred bench to the interests of the pupil! The traditional\r\nschool seems to be vanishing--that place in which an ill-assorted band of\r\nyoungsters was for a certain number of hours each day placed in the\r\nvicinity of a text-book and a maiden lady.\r\n\r\nI mention these experiments at random. It is not the specific reforms\r\nthat I wish to emphasize but the great possibilities they foreshadow.\r\nWhether or not we adopt certain special bills, high tariff or low tariff,\r\none banking system or another, this trust control or that, is a slight\r\ngain compared to a change of attitude toward all political problems. The\r\nreformer bound up in his special propaganda will, of course, object that\r\n\"to get something done is worth more than any amount of talk about new\r\nways of looking at political problems.\" What matters the method, he will\r\ncry, provided the reform be good? Well, the method matters more than any\r\nparticular reform. A man who couldn't think straight might get the right\r\nanswer to one problem, but how much faith would you have in his capacity\r\nto solve the next one? If you wanted to educate a child, would you teach\r\nhim to read one play of Shakespeare, or would you teach him to _read_? If\r\nthe world were going to remain frigidly set after next year, we might\r\nwell thank our stars if we blundered into a few decent solutions right\r\naway. But as there is no prospect of a time when our life will be\r\nimmutably fixed, as we shall, therefore, have to go on inventing, it is\r\nfair to say that what the world is aching for is not a special reform\r\nembodied in a particular statute, but a way of going at all problems. The\r\nlasting value of Darwin, for example, is not in any concrete conclusion\r\nhe reached. His importance to the world lies in the new twist he gave to\r\nscience. He lent it fruitful direction, a different impetus, and the\r\nresults are beyond his imagining.\r\n\r\nIn that spiritual autobiography of a searching mind, \"The New\r\nMachiavelli,\" Wells describes his progress from a reformer of concrete\r\nabuses to a revolutionist in method. \"You see,\" he says, \"I began in my\r\nteens by wanting to plan and build cities and harbors for mankind; I\r\nended in the middle thirties by desiring only to serve and increase a\r\ngeneral process of thought, a process fearless, critical, real-spirited,\r\nthat would in its own time give cities, harbors, air, happiness,\r\neverything at a scale and quality and in a light altogether beyond the\r\nmatch-striking imaginations of a contemporary mind....\"\r\n\r\nThis same veering of interest may be seen in the career of another\r\nEnglishman. I refer to Mr. Graham Wallas. Back in the '80's he was\r\nworking with the Webbs, Bernard Shaw, Sidney Olivier, Annie Besant and\r\nothers in socialist propaganda. Readers of the Fabian Essays know Mr.\r\nWallas and appreciate the work of his group. Perhaps more than anyone\r\nelse, the Fabians are responsible for turning English socialist thought\r\nfrom the verbalism of the Marxian disciples to the actualities of English\r\npolitical life. Their appetite for the concrete was enormous; their\r\nknowledge of facts overpowering, as the tomes produced by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWebb can testify. The socialism of the Fabians soon became a definite\r\nlegislative program which the various political parties were to be\r\nbulldozed, cajoled and tricked into enacting. It was effective work, and\r\nfew can question the value of it. Yet many admirers have been left with a\r\nsense of inadequacy.\r\n\r\nUnlike the orthodox socialists, the Fabians took an active part in\r\nimmediate politics. \"We permeated the party organizations,\" writes Shaw,\r\n\"and pulled all the wires we could lay our hands on with our utmost\r\nadroitness and energy.... The generalship of this movement was undertaken\r\nchiefly by Sidney Webb, who played such bewildering conjuring tricks with\r\nthe Liberal thimbles and the Fabian peas that to this day both the\r\nLiberals and the sectarian Socialists stand aghast at him.\" Few Americans\r\nknow how great has been this influence on English political history for\r\nthe last twenty years. The well-known Minority Report of the Poor Law\r\nCommission bears the Webb signature most conspicuously. Fabianism began\r\nto achieve a reputation for getting things done--for taking part in\r\n\"practical affairs.\" Bernard Shaw has found time to do no end of\r\ncampaigning and even the parochial politics of a vestryman has not seemed\r\ntoo insignificant for his Fabian enthusiasm. Graham Wallas was a\r\ncandidate in five municipal elections, and has held an important office\r\nas member of the London County Council.\r\n\r\nBut the original Fabian enthusiasm has slackened. One might ascribe it to\r\na growing sense that concrete programs by themselves will not insure any\r\nprofound regeneration of society. H. G. Wells has been savage and often\r\nunfair about the Fabian Society, but in \"The New Machiavelli\" he touched,\r\nI believe, the real disillusionment. Remington's history is in a way\r\nsymbolic. Here was a successful political reformer, coming more and more\r\nto a disturbing recognition of his helplessness, perceiving the\r\naimlessness and the unreality of political life, and announcing his\r\ncontempt for the \"crudification\" of all issues. What Remington missed was\r\nwhat so many reformers are beginning to miss--an underlying philosophical\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallas seems to have had much the same experience. In the midst of a\r\nbustle of activity, politics appeared to have no center to which its\r\nthinking and doing could be referred. The truth was driven home upon him\r\nthat political science is a science of human relationship with the human\r\nbeings left out. So he writes that \"the thinkers of the past, from Plato\r\nto Bentham and Mill, had each his own view of human nature, and they made\r\nthese views the basis of their speculations on government.\" But to-day\r\n\"nearly all students of politics analyze institutions and avoid the\r\nanalysis of man.\" Whoever has read the typical book on politics by a\r\nprofessor or a reformer will agree, I think, when he adds: \"One feels\r\nthat many of the more systematic books on politics by American University\r\nprofessors are useless, just because the writers dealt with abstract men,\r\nformed on assumptions of which they were unaware and which they have\r\nnever tested either by experience or by study.\"\r\n\r\nAn extreme example could be made of Nicholas Murray Butler, President of\r\nColumbia University. In the space of six months he wrote an impassioned\r\ndefense of \"constitutional government,\" beginning with the question, \"Why\r\nis it that in the United States the words politics and politician have\r\nassociations that are chiefly of evil omen,\" and then, to make irony\r\ncomplete, proceeded at the New York State Republican Convention to do the\r\njobbery of Boss Barnes. What is there left but to gasp and wonder whether\r\nthe words of the intellect have anything to do with the facts of life?\r\nWhat insight into reality can a man possess who is capable of discussing\r\npolitics and ignoring politicians? What kind of naïveté was it that led\r\nthis educator into asking such a question?\r\n\r\nPresident Butler is, I grant, a caricature of the typical professor. Yet\r\nwhat shall we say of the annual harvest of treatises on \"labor problems\"\r\nwhich make no analysis of the mental condition of laboring men; of the\r\ntreatises on marriage and prostitution which gloss over the sexual life\r\nof the individual? \"In the other sciences which deal with human affairs,\"\r\nwrites Mr. Wallas, referring to pedagogy and criminology, \"this division\r\nbetween the study of the thing done and the study of the being who does\r\nit is not found.\"\r\n\r\nI have in my hands a text-book of six hundred pages which is used in the\r\nlargest universities as a groundwork of political economy. This\r\nremarkable sentence strikes the eye: \"The motives to business activity\r\nare too familiar to require analysis.\" But some sense that perhaps the\r\n\"economic man\" is not a self-evident creature seems to have touched our\r\nauthor. So we are treated to these sapient remarks: \"To avoid this\r\ncriticism we will begin with a characterization of the typical business\r\nman to be found to-day in the United States and other countries in the\r\nsame stage of industrial development. _He has four traits which show\r\nthemselves more or less clearly in all of his acts._\" They are first\r\n\"self-interest,\" but \"this does not mean that he is steeped in\r\nselfishness ...\"; secondly, \"the larger self,\" the family, union, club,\r\nand \"in times of emergency his country\"; thirdly, \"love of independence,\"\r\nfor \"his ambition is to stand on his own feet\"; fourthly, \"business\r\nethics\" which \"are not usually as high as the standards professed in\r\nchurches, but they are much higher than current criticisms of business\r\nwould lead one to think.\" Three-quarters of a page is sufficient for this\r\npenetrating analysis of motive and is followed by the remark that \"these\r\nfour characteristics of the economic man are readily explained by\r\nreference to the evolutionary process which has brought industrial\r\nsociety to its present stage of development.\"\r\n\r\nIf those were the generalizations of a tired business man after a heavy\r\ndinner and a big cigar, they would still seem rather muddled and useless.\r\nBut as the basis of an economic treatise in which \"laws\" are announced,\r\n\"principles\" laid down, reforms criticized as \"impracticable,\" all for\r\nthe benefit of thousands of college students, it is hardly possible to\r\nexaggerate the folly of such an exhibition. I have taken a book written\r\nby one eminent professor and evidently approved by others, for they use\r\nit as a text-book. It is no queer freak. I myself was supposed to read\r\nthat book pretty nearly every week for a year. With hundreds of others I\r\nwas supposed to found my economic understanding upon it. We were actually\r\npunished for not reading that book. It was given to us as wisdom, as\r\nmodern political economy.\r\n\r\nBut what goes by the name to-day is a potpourri in which one can\r\ndistinguish descriptions of legal forms, charters and institutions;\r\ncomparative studies of governmental and social machinery; the history of\r\ninstitutions, a few \"principles\" like the law of rent, some moral\r\nadmonitions, a good deal of class feeling, not a little timidity--but\r\nalmost no attempt to cut beneath these manifestations of social life to\r\nthe creative impulses which produce them. The Economic Man--that lazy\r\nabstraction--is still paraded in the lecture room; the study of human\r\nnature has not advanced beyond the gossip of old wives.\r\n\r\nGraham Wallas touched the cause of the trouble when he pointed out that\r\npolitical science to-day discusses institutions and ignores the nature of\r\nthe men who make and live under them. I have heard professors reply that\r\nit wasn't their business to discuss human nature but to record and\r\ninterpret economic and political facts. Yet if you probe those\r\n\"interpretations\" there is no escaping the conclusion that they rest upon\r\nsome notion of what man is like. \"The student of politics,\" writes Mr.\r\nWallas, \"must, consciously or unconsciously, form a conception of human\r\nnature, and the less conscious he is of his conception the more likely he\r\nis to be dominated by it.\" For politics is an interest of men--a tool\r\nwhich they fabricate and use--and no comment has much value if it tries\r\nto get along without mankind. You might as well try to describe food by\r\nignoring the digestion.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallas has called a halt. I think we may say that his is the\r\ndistinction of having turned the study of politics back to the humane\r\ntradition of Plato and Machiavelli--of having made man the center of\r\npolitical investigation. The very title of his book--\"Human Nature in\r\nPolitics\"--is significant. Now in making that statement, I am aware that\r\nit is a sweeping one, and I do not mean to imply that Mr. Wallas is the\r\nonly modern man who has tried to think about politics psychologically.\r\nHere in America alone we have two splendid critics, a man and a woman,\r\nwhose thought flows from an interpretation of human character. Thorstein\r\nVeblen's brilliant descriptions penetrate deeply into our mental life,\r\nand Jane Addams has given new hope to many of us by her capacity for\r\nmaking ideals the goal of natural desire.\r\n\r\nNor is it just to pass by such a suggestive thinker as Gabriel Tarde,\r\neven though we may feel that his psychology is too simple and his\r\nconclusions somewhat overdriven by a favorite theory. The work of Gustav\r\nLe Bon on \"crowds\" has, of course, passed into current thought, but I\r\ndoubt whether anyone could say that he had even prepared a basis for a\r\nnew political psychology. His own aversion to reform, his fondness for\r\nvast epochs and his contempt for current effort have left most of his\r\n\"psychological laws\" in the region of interesting literary comment. There\r\nare, too, any number of \"social psychologies,\" such as those of Ross and\r\nMcDougall. But the trouble with them is that the \"psychology\" is weak and\r\nuninformed, distorted by moral enthusiasms, and put out without any\r\nparticular reference to the task of statesmanship. When you come to\r\nspecial problems, the literature of the subject picks up. Crime is\r\nreceiving valuable attention, education is profoundly affected,\r\nalcoholism and sex have been handled for a good while on a psychological\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nBut it remained for Mr. Wallas to state the philosophy of the matter--to\r\nsay why the study of human nature must serve politics, and to point out\r\nhow. He has not produced a political psychology, but he has written the\r\nmanifesto for it. As a result, fragmentary investigations can be brought\r\ntogether and applied to the work of statecraft. Merely by making these\r\nresearches self-conscious, he has made clearer their goal, given them\r\ndirection, and kindled them to practical action. How necessary this work\r\nis can be seen in the writing of Miss Addams. Owing to keen insight and\r\nfine sympathy her thinking has generally been on a human basis. Yet Miss\r\nAddams is a reformer, and sympathy without an explicit philosophy may\r\nlead to a distorted enthusiasm. Her book on prostitution seems rather the\r\nproduct of her moral fervor than her human insight. Compare it with \"The\r\nSpirit of Youth\" or \"Newer Ideals of Peace\" or \"Democracy and Social\r\nEthics\" and I think you will notice a very considerable willingness to\r\ngloss over human need in the interests of an unanalyzed reform. To put it\r\nbluntly, Miss Addams let her impatience get the better of her wisdom. She\r\nhad written brilliantly about sex and its \"sublimation,\" she had\r\nsuggested notable \"moral equivalents\" for vice, but when she touched the\r\nwhite slave traffic its horrors were so great that she also put her faith\r\nin the policeman and the district attorney. \"A New Conscience and an\r\nAncient Evil\" is an hysterical book, just because the real philosophical\r\nbasis of Miss Addams' thinking was not deliberate enough to withstand the\r\nshock of a poignant horror.\r\n\r\nIt is this weakness that Mr. Wallas comes to remedy. He has described\r\nwhat political science must be like, and anyone who has absorbed his\r\ninsight has an intellectual groundwork for political observation. No one,\r\nleast of all Mr. Wallas, would claim anything like finality for the\r\nessay. These labors are not done in a day. But he has deliberately\r\nbrought the study of politics to the only focus which has any rational\r\ninterest for mankind. He has made a plea, and sketched a plan which\r\nhundreds of investigators the world over must help to realize. If\r\npolitical science could travel in the direction suggested, its criticism\r\nwould be relevant, its proposals practical. There would, for the first\r\ntime, be a concerted effort to build a civilization around mankind, to\r\nuse its talent and to satisfy its needs. There would be no more empty\r\ntaboos, no erecting of institutions upon abstract and mechanical\r\nanalogies. Politics would be like education--an effort to develop, train\r\nand nurture men's impulses. As Montessori is building the school around\r\nthe child, so politics would build all of social life around the human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThat practical issues hang upon these investigations can be shown by an\r\nexample from Mr. Wallas's book. Take the quarrel over socialism. You hear\r\nit said that without the private ownership of capital people will lose\r\nambition and sink into sloth. Many men, just as well aware of present-day\r\nevils as the socialists, are unwilling to accept the collectivist remedy.\r\nG. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc speak of the \"magic of property\" as\r\nthe real obstacle to socialism. Now obviously this is a question of\r\nfirst-rate importance. If socialism will destroy initiative then only a\r\ndoctrinaire would desire it. But how is the question to be solved? You\r\ncannot reason it out. Economics, as we know it to-day, is quite incapable\r\nof answering such a problem, for it is a matter that depends upon\r\npsychological investigation. When a professor says that socialism is\r\nimpracticable he begs the question, for that amounts to assuming that the\r\npoint at issue is already settled. If he tells you that socialism is\r\nagainst human nature, we have a perfect right to ask where he proved the\r\npossibilities of human nature.\r\n\r\nBut note how Mr. Wallas approaches the debate: \"Children quarrel\r\nfuriously at a very early age over apparently worthless things, and\r\ncollect and hide them long before they can have any clear notion of the\r\nadvantages to be derived from individual possession. Those children who\r\nin certain charity schools are brought up entirely without personal\r\nproperty, even in their clothes or pocket handkerchiefs, show every sign\r\nof the bad effect on health and character which results from complete\r\ninability to satisfy a strong inherited instinct.... Some economist ought\r\ntherefore to give us a treatise in which this property instinct is\r\ncarefully and quantitatively examined.... How far can it be eliminated or\r\nmodified by education? Is it satisfied by a leasehold or a life-interest,\r\nor by such an arrangement of corporate property as is offered by a\r\ncollegiate foundation, or by the provision of a public park? Does it\r\nrequire for its satisfaction material and visible things such as land or\r\nhouses, or is the holding, say, of colonial railway shares sufficient? Is\r\nthe absence of unlimited proprietary rights felt more strongly in the\r\ncase of personal chattels (such as furniture and ornaments) than in the\r\ncase of land or machinery? Does the degree and direction of the instinct\r\nmarkedly differ among different individuals or races, or between the two\r\nsexes?\"\r\n\r\nThis puts the argument upon a plane where discussion is relevant. This is\r\nno trumped-up issue: it is asked by a politician and a socialist seeking\r\nfor a real solution. We need to know whether the \"magic of property\"\r\nextends from a man's garden to Standard Oil stocks as anti-socialists\r\nsay, and, conversely, we need to know what is happening to that mass of\r\nproletarians who own no property and cannot satisfy their instincts even\r\nwith personal chattels.\r\n\r\nFor if ownership is a human need, we certainly cannot taboo it as the\r\nextreme communists so dogmatically urge. \"Pending ... an inquiry,\" writes\r\nMr. Wallas, \"my own provisional opinion is that, like a good many\r\ninstincts of very early evolutionary origin, it can be satisfied by an\r\navowed pretense; just as a kitten which is fed regularly on milk can be\r\nkept in good health if it is allowed to indulge its hunting instinct by\r\nplaying with a bobbin, and a peaceful civil servant satisfies his\r\ninstinct of combat and adventure at golf.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wallas takes exactly the same position as William James did when he\r\nplanned a \"moral equivalent\" for war. Both men illustrate the changing\r\nfocus of political thought. Both try to found statesmanship on human\r\nneed. Both see that there are good and bad satisfactions of the same\r\nimpulse. The routineer with his taboo does not see this, so he attempts\r\nthe impossible task of obliterating the impulse. He differs fundamentally\r\nfrom the creative politician who devotes himself to inventing fine\r\nexpressions for human needs, who recognizes that the work of\r\nstatesmanship is in large measure the finding of good substitutes for the\r\nbad things we want.\r\n\r\nThis is the heart of a political revolution. When we recognize that the\r\nfocus of politics is shifting from a mechanical to a human center we\r\nshall have reached what is, I believe, the most essential idea in modern\r\npolitics. More than any other generalization it illuminates the currents\r\nof our national life and explains the altering tasks of statesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe old effort was to harness mankind to abstract principles--liberty,\r\njustice or equality--and to deduce institutions from these high-sounding\r\nwords. It did not succeed because human nature was contrary and restive.\r\nThe new effort proposes to fit creeds and institutions to the wants of\r\nmen, to satisfy their impulses as fully and beneficially as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we do not begin to know our desires or the art of their\r\nsatisfaction. Mr. Wallas's book and the special literature of the subject\r\nleave no doubt that a precise political psychology is far off indeed. The\r\nhuman nature we must put at the center of our statesmanship is only\r\npartially understood. True, Mr. Wallas works with a psychology that is\r\nfairly well superseded. But not even the advance-guard to-day, what we\r\nmay call the Freudian school, would claim that it had brought knowledge\r\nto a point where politics could use it in any very deep or comprehensive\r\nway. The subject is crude and fragmentary, though we are entitled to call\r\nit promising.\r\n\r\nYet the fact had better be faced: psychology has not gone far enough, its\r\nresults are still too vague for our purposes. We know very little, and\r\nwhat we know has hardly been applied to political problems. That the last\r\nfew years have witnessed a revolution in the study of mental life is\r\nplain: the effects are felt not only in psychotherapy, but in education,\r\nmorals, religion, and no end of cultural interests. The impetus of Freud\r\nis perhaps the greatest advance ever made towards the understanding and\r\ncontrol of human character. But for the complexities of politics it is\r\nnot yet ready. It will take time and endless labor for a detailed study\r\nof social problems in the light of this growing knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat then shall we do now? Must we continue to muddle along in the old\r\nruts, gazing rapturously at an impotent ideal, until the works of the\r\nscientists are matured?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN RULE AND AFTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be an intolerably pedantic performance for a nation to\r\nsit still and wait for its scientists to report on their labors. The\r\nnotion is typical of the pitfalls in the path of any theorist who does\r\nnot correct his logic by a constant reference to the movement of life. It\r\nis true that statecraft must make human nature its basis. It is true that\r\nits chief task is the invention of forms and institutions which satisfy\r\nthe inner needs of mankind. And it is true that our knowledge of those\r\nneeds and the technique of their satisfaction is hazy, unorganized and\r\nblundering.\r\n\r\nBut to suppose that the remedy lies in waiting for monographs from the\r\nresearch of the laboratory is to have lost a sense of the rhythm of\r\nactual affairs. That is not the way things come about: we grow into a new\r\npoint of view: only afterwards, in looking back, do we see the landmarks\r\nof our progress. Thus it is customary to say that Adam Smith dates the\r\nchange from the old mercantilist economy to the capitalistic economics of\r\nthe nineteenth century. But that is a manner of speech. The old\r\nmercantilist policy was giving way to early industrialism: a thousand\r\nunconscious economic and social forces were compelling the change. Adam\r\nSmith expressed the process, named it, idealized it and made it\r\nself-conscious. Then because men were clearer about what they were doing,\r\nthey could in a measure direct their destiny.\r\n\r\nThat is but another way of saying that great revolutionary changes do not\r\nspring full-armed from anybody's brow. A genius usually becomes the\r\nluminous center of a nation's crisis,--men see better by the light of\r\nhim. His bias deflects their actions. Unquestionably the doctrine-driven\r\nmen who made the economics of the last century had much to do with the\r\nhalo which encircled the smutted head of industrialism. They put the\r\nstamp of their genius on certain inhuman practices, and of course it has\r\nbeen the part of the academic mind to imitate them ever since. The\r\northodox economists are in the unenviable position of having taken their\r\nmorals from the exploiter and of having translated them into the\r\ngrandiloquent language of high public policy. They gave capitalism the\r\nsanction of the intellect. When later, Carlyle and Ruskin battered the\r\neconomists into silence with invective and irony they were voicing the\r\ndumb protest of the humane people of England. They helped to organize a\r\nformless resentment by endowing it with intelligence and will.\r\n\r\nSo it is to-day. If this nation did not show an unmistakable tendency to\r\nput men at the center of politics instead of machinery and things; if\r\nthere were not evidence to prove that we are turning from the sterile\r\ntaboo to the creation of finer environments; if the impetus for shaping\r\nour destiny were not present in our politics and our life, then essays\r\nlike these would be so much baying at the moon, fantastic and unworthy\r\npleas for some irrelevant paradise. But the gropings are there,--vastly\r\nconfused in the tangled strains of the nation's interests. Clogged by the\r\nconfusion, half-choked by stupid blockades, largely unaware of their own\r\npurposes, it is for criticism, organized research, and artistic\r\nexpression to free and to use these creative energies. They are to be\r\nfound in the aspirations of labor, among the awakened women, in the\r\ndevelopment of business, the diffusion of art and science, in the racial\r\nmixtures, and many lesser interests which cluster about these greater\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe desire for a human politics is all about us. It rises to the surface\r\nin slogans like \"human rights above property rights,\" \"the man above the\r\ndollar.\" Some measure of its strength is given by the widespread\r\nimitation these expressions have compelled: politicians who haven't the\r\nslightest intention of putting men above the dollar, who if they had\r\nwouldn't know how, take off their hats to the sentiment because it seems\r\na key to popular enthusiasm. It must be bewildering to men brought up,\r\nlet us say, in the Hanna school of politics. For here is this nation\r\nwhich sixteen years ago vibrated ecstatically to that magic word\r\n\"Prosperity\"; to-day statistical rhetoric about size induces little but\r\nexcessive boredom. If you wish to drive an audience out of the hall tell\r\nit how rich America is; if you wish to stamp yourself an echo of the past\r\ntalk to us young men about the Republican Party's understanding with God\r\nin respect to bumper crops. But talk to us about \"human rights,\" and\r\nthough you talk rubbish, we'll listen. For our desire is bent that way,\r\nand anything which has the flavor of this new interest will rivet our\r\nattention. We are still uncritical. It is only a few years since we began\r\nto center our politics upon human beings. We have no training in that\r\nkind of thought. Our schools and colleges have helped us hardly at all.\r\nWe still talk about \"humanity\" as if it were some strange and mystical\r\ncreature which could not possibly be composed of the grocer, the\r\nstreet-car conductor and our aunts.\r\n\r\nThat the opinion-making people of America are more interested in human\r\nwelfare than in empire or abstract prosperity is an item that no\r\nstatesman can disregard in his thinking. To-day it is no longer necessary\r\nto run against the grain of the deepest movements of our time. There is\r\nan ascendant feeling among the people that all achievement should be\r\nmeasured in human happiness. This feeling has not always existed.\r\nHistorians tell us that the very idea of progress in well-being is not\r\nmuch older than, say, Shakespeare's plays. As a general belief it is\r\nstill more recent. The nineteenth century may perhaps be said to mark its\r\npopularization. But as a fact of immediate politics, as a touchstone\r\napplied quickly to all the acts of statecraft in America it belongs to\r\nthe Twentieth Century. There were any number of people who long before\r\n1900 saw that dollars and men could clash. But their insight had not won\r\nany general acceptance. It is only within the last few years that the\r\nhuman test has ceased to be the property of a small group and become the\r\nconvention of a large majority. A study of magazines and newspapers would\r\nconfirm this rather broad generalization. It would show, I believe, how\r\nthe whole quality of our most impromptu thinking is being influenced by\r\nhuman values.\r\n\r\nThe statesman must look to this largely unorganized drift of desire. He\r\nwill find it clustering about certain big revolts--the unrest of women,\r\nfor example, or the increasing demands of industrial workers. Rightly\r\nunderstood, these social currents would, I believe, lead to the central\r\nissues of life, the vital points upon which happiness depends. They come\r\nout of necessities. They express desire. They are power.\r\n\r\nThus feminism, arising out of a crisis in sexual conditions, has\r\nliberated energies that are themselves the motors of any reform. In\r\nEngland and America voting has become the symbol of an aspiration as yet\r\nhalf-conscious and undefined. What women want is surely something a great\r\ndeal deeper than the privilege of taking part in elections. They are\r\nlooking for a readjustment of their relations to the home, to work, to\r\nchildren, to men, to the interests of civilized life. The vote has become\r\na convenient peg upon which to hang aspirations that are not at all sure\r\nof their own meaning. In no insignificant number of cases the vote is a\r\ncover by which revolutionary demands can be given a conventional front.\r\nThe ballot is at the utmost a beginning, as far-sighted conservatives\r\nhave guessed. Certainly the elimination of \"male\" from the suffrage\r\nqualifications will not end the feminist agitation. From the angle of\r\nstatecraft the future of the movement may be said to depend upon the wise\r\nuse of this raw and scattered power. I do not pretend to know in detail\r\nhow this can be done. But I am certain that the task of leadership is to\r\norganize aspiration in the service of the real interests of life. To-day\r\nwomen want--what? They are ready to want something: that describes fairly\r\nthe condition of most suffragettes. Those who like Ellen Key and Olive\r\nShreiner and Mrs. Gilman give them real problems to think about are\r\ndrafting that energy into use. By real problems I mean problems of love,\r\nwork, home, children. They are the real interests of feminism because\r\nthey have produced it.\r\n\r\nThe yearnings of to-day are the symptoms of needs, they point the course\r\nof invention, they are the energies which animate a social program. The\r\nmost ideally conceived plan of the human mind has only a slight interest\r\nif it does not harness these instinctive forces. That is the great lesson\r\nwhich the utopias teach by their failure--that schemes, however nicely\r\narranged, cannot be imposed upon human beings who are interested in other\r\nthings. What ailed Don Quixote was that he and his contemporaries wanted\r\ndifferent things; the only ideals that count are those which express the\r\npossible development of an existing force. Reformers must never forget\r\nthat three legs are a Quixotic ideal; two good legs a genuine one.\r\n\r\nIn actual life, yes, in the moil and toil of propaganda, \"movements,\"\r\n\"causes\" and agitations the statesman-inventor and the political\r\npsychologist find the raw material for their work. It is not the business\r\nof the politician to preserve an Olympian indifference to what stupid\r\npeople call \"popular whim.\" Being lofty about the \"passing fad\" and the\r\nephemeral outcry is all very well in the biographies of dead men, but\r\nrank nonsense in the rulers of real ones. Oscar Wilde once remarked that\r\nonly superficial people disliked the superficial. Nothing, for example,\r\ncould on the surface be more trivial than an interest in baseball scores.\r\nYet during the campaign of 1912 the excitement was so great that Woodrow\r\nWilson said on the stump he felt like apologizing to the American people\r\nfor daring to be a presidential candidate while the Giants and the Red\r\nSox were playing for the championship. Baseball (not so much for those\r\nwho play it), is a colossal phenomenon in American life. Watch the crowds\r\nin front of a bulletin board, finding a vicarious excitement and an\r\nabstract relief from the monotony of their own lives. What a second-hand\r\ncivilization it is that grows passionate over a scoreboard with little\r\nelectric lights! What a civilization it is that has learned to enjoy its\r\nsport without even seeing it! If ever there was a symptom that this\r\nnation needed leisure and direct participation in games, it is that poor\r\nscrawny substitute for joy--the baseball extra.\r\n\r\nIt is as symptomatic as the labor union. It expresses need. And\r\nstatesmanship would find an answer. It would not let that passion and\r\nloyalty be frittered away to drift like scum through the nation. It would\r\nsee in it the opportunity of art, play, and religion. So with what looks\r\nvery different--the \"syndicalist movement.\" Perhaps it seems preposterous\r\nto discuss baseball and syndicalism in the same paragraph. But that is\r\nonly because we have not accustomed ourselves to thinking of social\r\nevents as answers to human needs. The statesman would ask, Why are there\r\nsyndicalists? What are they driving at? What gift to civilization is in\r\nthe impetus behind them? They are human beings, and they want human\r\nthings. There is no reason to become terror-stricken about them. They\r\nseem to want things badly. Then ostriches disguised as judges cannot deal\r\nwith them. Anarchism--men die for that, they undergo intolerable insults.\r\nThey are tarred and feathered and spat upon. Is it possible that\r\nRepublicans, Democrats and Socialists clip the wings more than free\r\nspirits can allow? Is civilization perhaps too tightly organized? Have\r\nthe irreconcilables a soul audacious and less blunted than our\r\ndomesticated ones? To put it mildly, is it ever safe to ignore them\r\nentirely in our thinking?\r\n\r\nWe shall come, I think, to a different appraisal of agitations. Our\r\npresent method is to discuss whether the proposals are right and\r\nfeasible. We do this hastily and with prejudice. Generally we decide that\r\nany agitation foreign to our settled habits is wrong. And we bolster up\r\nour satisfaction by pointing to some mistake of logic or some puerility\r\nof statement. That done, we feel the agitation is deplorable and can be\r\nignored unless it becomes so obstreperous that we have to put it in jail.\r\nBut a genuine statecraft would go deeper. It would know that even God has\r\nbeen defended with nonsense. So it could be sympathetic to agitations. I\r\nuse the word sympathetic literally. For it would try to understand the\r\ninner feeling which had generated what looks like a silly demand. To-day\r\nit is as if a hungry man asked for an indigestible food, and we let him\r\ngo hungry because he was unwise. He isn't any the less hungry because he\r\nasks for the wrong food. So with agitations. Their specific plans may be\r\nsilly, but their demands are real. The hungers and lusts of mankind have\r\nproduced some stupendous follies, but the desires themselves are no less\r\nreal and insistent.\r\n\r\nThe important thing about a social movement is not its stated platform\r\nbut the source from which it flows. The task of politics is to understand\r\nthose deeper demands and to find civilized satisfactions for them. The\r\nmeaning of this is that the statesman must be more than the leader of a\r\nparty. Thus the socialist statesman is not complete if he is a good\r\nsocialist. Only the delusion that his truth is the whole truth, his party\r\nthe human race, and his program a panacea, will produce that singleness\r\nof vision.\r\n\r\nThe moment a man takes office he has no right to be the representative of\r\none group alone. He has assumed the burden of harmonizing particular\r\nagitations with the general welfare. That is why great agitators should\r\nnot accept office. Men like Debs understand that. Their business is to\r\nmake social demands so concrete and pressing that statesmen are forced to\r\ndeal with them. Agitators who accept government positions are a\r\ndisappointment to their followers. They can no longer be severely\r\npartisan. They have to look at affairs nationally. Now the agitator and\r\nthe statesman are both needed. But they have different functions, and it\r\nis unjust to damn one because he hasn't the virtues of the other.\r\n\r\nThe statesman to-day needs a large equipment. The man who comes forward\r\nto shape a country's policy has truly no end of things to consider. He\r\nmust be aware of the condition of the people: no statesman must fall into\r\nthe sincere but thoroughly upper class blunder that President Taft\r\ncommitted when he advised a three months' vacation. Realizing how men and\r\nwomen feel at all levels and at different places, he must speak their\r\ndiscontent and project their hopes. Through this he will get power.\r\nStanding upon the prestige which that gives he must guide and purify the\r\nsocial demands he finds at work. He is the translator of agitations. For\r\nthis task he must be keenly sensitive to public opinion and capable of\r\nunderstanding the dynamics of it. Then, in order to fuse it into a\r\ncivilized achievement, he will require much expert knowledge. Yet he need\r\nnot be a specialist himself, if only he is expert in choosing experts. It\r\nis better indeed that the statesman should have a lay, and not a\r\nprofessional view. For the bogs of technical stupidity and empty\r\nformalism are always near and always dangerous. The real political genius\r\nstands between the actual life of men, their wishes and their needs, and\r\nall the windings of official caste and professional snobbery. It is his\r\nsupreme business to see that the servants of life stay in their\r\nplace--that government, industry, \"causes,\" science, all the creatures of\r\nman do not succeed in their perpetual effort to become the masters.\r\n\r\nI have Roosevelt in mind. He haunts political thinking. And indeed, why\r\nshouldn't he? What reality could there be in comments upon American\r\npolitics which ignored the colossal phenomenon of Roosevelt? If he is\r\nwholly evil, as many say he is, then the American democracy is\r\npreponderantly evil. For in the first years of the Twentieth Century,\r\nRoosevelt spoke for this nation, as few presidents have spoken in our\r\nhistory. And that he has spoken well, who in the perspective of time will\r\ndeny? Sensitive to the original forces of public opinion, no man has had\r\nthe same power of rounding up the laggards. Government under him was a\r\nthrobbing human purpose. He succeeded, where Taft failed, in preventing\r\nthat drought of invention which officialism brings. Many people say he\r\nhas tried to be all things to all men--that his speeches are an attempt\r\nto corral all sorts of votes. That is a left-handed way of stating a\r\ntruth. A more generous interpretation would be to say that he had tried\r\nto be inclusive, to attach a hundred sectional agitations to a national\r\nprogram. Crude: of course he was crude; he had a hemisphere for his\r\ncanvas. Inconsistent: yes, he tried to be the leader of factions at war\r\nwith one another. A late convert: he is a statesman and not an\r\nagitator--his business was to meet demands when they had grown to\r\nnational proportions. No end of possibilities have slipped through the\r\nlarge meshes of his net. He has said some silly things. He has not been\r\nsubtle, and he has been far from perfect. But his success should be\r\njudged by the size of his task, by the fierceness of the opposition, by\r\nthe intellectual qualities of the nation he represented. When we remember\r\nthat he was trained in the Republican politics of Hanna and Platt, that\r\nhe was the first President who shared a new social vision, then I believe\r\nwe need offer no apologies for making Mr. Roosevelt stand as the working\r\nmodel for a possible American statesman at the beginning of the Twentieth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nCritics have often suggested that Roosevelt stole Bryan's clothes. That\r\nis perhaps true, and it suggests a comparison which illuminates both men.\r\nIt would not be unfair to say that it is always the function of the\r\nRoosevelts to take from the Bryans. But it is a little silly for an\r\nagitator to cry thief when the success of his agitation has led to the\r\nadoption of his ideas. It is like the chagrin of the socialists because\r\nthe National Progressive Party had \"stolen twenty-three planks,\" and it\r\nmakes a person wonder whether some agitators haven't an overdeveloped\r\nsense of private property.\r\n\r\nI do not see the statesman in Bryan. He has been something of a voice\r\ncrying in the wilderness, but a voice that did not understand its own\r\nmessage. Many people talk of him as a prophet. There is a great deal of\r\nliteral truth in that remark, for it has been the peculiar work of Bryan\r\nto express in politics some of that emotion which has made America the\r\nhome of new religions. What we know as the scientific habit of mind is\r\nentirely lacking in his intellectual equipment. There is a vein of\r\nmysticism in American life, and Mr. Bryan is its uncritical prophet. His\r\ninsights are those of the gifted evangelist, often profound and always\r\nnarrow. It is absurd to debate his sincerity. Mr. Bryan talks with the\r\nintoxication of the man who has had a revelation: to skeptics that always\r\nseems theatrical. But far from being the scheming hypocrite his enemies\r\nsay he is, Mr. Bryan is too simple for the task of statesmanship. No\r\nbracing critical atmosphere plays about his mind: there are no cleansing\r\ndoubts and fruitful alternatives. The work of Bryan has been to express a\r\ncertain feeling of unrest--to embody it in the traditional language of\r\nprophecy. But it is a shrewd turn of the American people that has kept\r\nhim out of office. I say this not in disrespect of his qualities, but in\r\ndefinition of them. Bryan does not happen to have the naturalistic\r\noutlook, the complete humanity, or the deliberative habit which modern\r\nstatecraft requires. He is the voice of a confused emotion.\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson has a talent which is Bryan's chief defect--the scientific\r\nhabit of holding facts in solution. His mind is lucid and flexible, and\r\nhe has the faculty of taking advice quickly, of stating something he has\r\nborrowed with more ease and subtlety than the specialist from whom he got\r\nit. Woodrow Wilson's is an elegant and highly refined intellect, nicely\r\nbalanced and capable of fine adjustment. An urbane civilization produced\r\nit, leisure has given it spaciousness, ease has made it generous. A mind\r\nwithout tension, its roots are not in the somewhat barbarous\r\nunder-currents of the nation. Woodrow Wilson understands easily, but he\r\ndoes not incarnate: he has never been a part of the protest he speaks.\r\nYou think of him as a good counsellor, as an excellent presiding officer.\r\nWhether his imagination is fibrous enough to catch the inwardness of the\r\nmutterings of our age is something experience alone can show. Wilson has\r\nclass feeling in the least offensive sense of that term: he likes a world\r\nof gentlemen. Occasionally he has exhibited a rather amateurish effort to\r\nbe grimy and shirt-sleeved. But without much success: his contact with\r\nAmerican life is not direct, and so he is capable of purely theoretical\r\naffirmations. Like all essentially contemplative men, the world has to be\r\nreflected in the medium of his intellect before he can grapple with it.\r\n\r\nYet Wilson belongs among the statesmen, and it is fine that he should be\r\nin public life. The weakness I have suggested is one that all statesmen\r\nshare in some degree: an inability to interpret adequately the world they\r\ngovern. This is a difficulty which is common to conservative and radical,\r\nand if I have used three living men to illustrate the problem it is only\r\nbecause they seem to illuminate it. They have faced the task and we can\r\ntake their measurement. It is no part of my purpose to make any judgment\r\nas to the value of particular policies they have advocated. I am\r\nattempting to suggest some of the essentials of a statesman's equipment\r\nfor the work of a humanly centered politics. Roosevelt has seemed to me\r\nthe most effective, the most nearly complete; Bryan I have ventured to\r\nclass with the men who though important to politics should never hold\r\nhigh executive office; Wilson, less complete than Roosevelt, is worthy of\r\nour deepest interest because his judgment is subtle where Roosevelt's is\r\ncrude. He is a foretaste of a more advanced statesmanship.\r\n\r\nBecause he is self-conscious, Wilson has been able to see the problem\r\nthat any finely adapted statecraft must meet. It is a problem that would\r\nhardly occur to an old-fashioned politician: \"Though he (the statesman)\r\ncannot himself keep the life of the nation as a whole in his mind, he can\r\nat least make sure that he is taking counsel with those who know....\" It\r\nis not important that Wilson in stating the difficulty should put it as\r\nif he had in a measure solved it. He hasn't, because taking counsel is a\r\nmeans to understanding the nation as a whole, and that understanding\r\nremains almost as arduous and requires just as fibrous an imagination, if\r\nit is gleaned from advisers.\r\n\r\nTo think of the whole nation: surely the task of statesmanship is more\r\ndifficult to-day than ever before in history. In the face of a clotted\r\nintricacy in the subject-matter of politics, improvements in knowledge\r\nseem meager indeed. The distance between what we know and what we need to\r\nknow appears to be greater than ever. Plato and Aristotle thought in\r\nterms of ten thousand homogeneous villagers; we have to think in terms of\r\na hundred million people of all races and all traditions, crossbred and\r\ninbred, subject to climates they have never lived in before, plumped down\r\non a continent in the midst of a strange civilization. We have to deal\r\nwith all grades of life from the frontier to the metropolis, with men who\r\ndiffer in sense of fact, in ideal, in the very groundwork of morals. And\r\nwe have to take into account not the simple opposition of two classes,\r\nbut the hostility of many,--the farmers and the factory workers and all\r\nthe castes within their ranks, the small merchants, and the feudal\r\norganization of business. Ours is a problem in which deception has become\r\norganized and strong; where truth is poisoned at its source; one in which\r\nthe skill of the shrewdest brains is devoted to misleading a bewildered\r\npeople. Nor can we keep to the problem within our borders. Whether we\r\nwish it or not we are involved in the world's problems, and all the winds\r\nof heaven blow through our land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a great question whether our intellects can grasp the subject. Are\r\nwe perhaps like a child whose hand is too small to span an octave on the\r\npiano? Not only are the facts inhumanly complicated, but the natural\r\nideals of people are so varied and contradictory that action halts in\r\ndespair. We are putting a tremendous strain upon the mind, and the\r\nresults are all about us: everyone has known the neutral thinkers who\r\nstand forever undecided before the complications of life, who have, as it\r\nwere, caught a glimpse of the possibilities of knowledge. The sight has\r\nparalyzed them. Unless they can act with certainty, they dare not act at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThat is merely one of the temptations of theory. In the real world,\r\naction and thought are so closely related that one cannot wait upon the\r\nother. We cannot wait in politics for any completed theoretical\r\ndiscussion of its method: it is a monstrous demand. There is no pausing\r\nuntil political psychology is more certain. We have to act on what we\r\nbelieve, on half-knowledge, illusion and error. Experience itself will\r\nreveal our mistakes; research and criticism may convert them into wisdom.\r\nBut act we must, and act as if we knew the nature of man and proposed to\r\nsatisfy his needs.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we must put man at the center of politics, even though we\r\nare densely ignorant both of man and of politics. This has always been\r\nthe method of great political thinkers from Plato to Bentham. But one\r\ndifference we in this age must note: they made their political man a\r\ndogma--we must leave him an hypothesis. That is to say that our task is\r\nto temper speculation with scientific humility.\r\n\r\nA paradox there is here, but a paradox of language, and not of fact. Men\r\nmade bridges before there was a science of bridge-building; they cured\r\ndisease before they knew medicine. Art came before æsthetics, and\r\nrighteousness before ethics. Conduct and theory react upon each other.\r\nHypothesis is confirmed and modified by action, and action is guided by\r\nhypothesis. If it is a paradox to ask for a human politics before we\r\nunderstand humanity or politics, it is what Mr. Chesterton describes as\r\none of those paradoxes that sit beside the wells of truth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe make our picture of man, knowing that, though it is crude and unjust,\r\nwe have to work with it. If we are wise we shall become experimental\r\ntowards life: then every mistake will contribute towards knowledge. Let\r\nthe exploration of human need and desire become a deliberate purpose of\r\nstatecraft, and there is no present measure of its possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn this work there are many guides. A vague common tradition is in the\r\nair about us--it expresses itself in journalism, in cheap novels, in the\r\nuncritical theater. Every merchant has his stock of assumptions about the\r\nmental habits of his customers and competitors; the prostitute hers; the\r\nnewspaperman his; P. T. Barnum had a few; the vaudeville stage has a\r\nnumber. We test these notions by their results, and even \"practical\r\npeople\" find that there is more variety in human nature than they had\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nWe forge gradually our greatest instrument for understanding the\r\nworld--introspection. We discover that humanity may resemble us very\r\nconsiderably--that the best way of knowing the inwardness of our\r\nneighbors is to know ourselves. For after all, the only experience we\r\nreally understand is our own. And that, in the least of us, is so rich\r\nthat no one has yet exhausted its possibilities. It has been said that\r\nevery genuine character an artist produces is one of the characters he\r\nmight have been. By re-creating our own suppressed possibilities we\r\nmultiply the number of lives that we can really know. That as I\r\nunderstand it is the psychology of the Golden Rule. For note that Jesus\r\ndid not set up some external fetich: he did not say, make your neighbor\r\nrighteous, or chaste, or respectable. He said do as you would be done by.\r\nAssume that you and he are alike, and you can found morals on humanity.\r\n\r\nBut experience has enlarged our knowledge of differences. We realize now\r\nthat our neighbor is not always like ourselves. Knowing how unjust other\r\npeople's inferences are when they concern us, we have begun to guess that\r\nours may be unjust to them. Any uniformity of conduct becomes at once an\r\nimpossible ideal, and the willingness to live and let live assumes high\r\nplace among the virtues. A puzzled wisdom remarks that \"it takes all\r\nsorts of people to make a world,\" and half-protestingly men accept\r\nBernard Shaw's amendment, \"Do not do unto others as you would that they\r\nshould do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.\"\r\n\r\nWe learn perhaps that there is no contradiction in speaking of \"human\r\nnature\" while admitting that men are unique. For all deepening of our\r\nknowledge gives a greater sense of common likeness and individual\r\nvariation. It is folly to ignore either insight. But it is done\r\nconstantly, with no end of confusion as a result. Some men have got\r\nthemselves into a state where the only view that interests them is the\r\ncommon humanity of us all. Their world is not populated by men and women,\r\nbut by a Unity that is Permanent. You might as well refuse to see any\r\ndifferences between steam, water and ice because they have common\r\nelements. And I have seen some of these people trying to skate on steam.\r\nTheir brothers, blind in the other eye, go about the world so sure that\r\neach person is entirely unique, that society becomes like a row of\r\npacking cases, each painted on the inside, and each containing one ego\r\nand its own.\r\n\r\nArt enlarges experience by admitting us to the inner life of others. That\r\nis not the only use of art, for its function is surely greater and more\r\nultimate than to furnish us with a better knowledge of human nature. Nor\r\nis that its only use even to statecraft. I suggested earlier that art\r\nenters politics as a \"moral equivalent\" for evil, a medium by which\r\nbarbarous lusts find civilized expression. It is, too, an ideal for\r\nlabor. But my purpose here is not to attempt any adequate description of\r\nthe services of art. It is enough to note that literature in particular\r\nelaborates our insight into human life, and, therefore, enables us to\r\ncenter our institutions more truly.\r\n\r\nIbsen discovers a soul in Nora: the discovery is absorbed into the common\r\nknowledge of the age. Other Noras discover their own souls; the Helmers\r\nall about us begin to see the person in the doll. Plays and novels have\r\nindeed an overwhelming political importance, as the \"moderns\" have\r\nmaintained. But it lies not in the preaching of a doctrine or the\r\ninsistence on some particular change in conduct. That is a shallow and\r\nwasteful use of the resources of art. For art can open up the springs\r\nfrom which conduct flows. Its genuine influence is on what Wells calls\r\nthe \"hinterland,\" in a quickening of the sense of life.\r\n\r\nArt can really penetrate where most of us can only observe. \"I look and I\r\nthink I see,\" writes Bergson, \"I listen and I think I hear, I examine\r\nmyself and I think I am reading the very depths of my heart.... (But) my\r\nsenses and my consciousness ... give me no more than a practical\r\nsimplification of reality ... in short, we do not see the actual things\r\nthemselves; in most cases we confine ourselves to reading the labels\r\naffixed to them.\" Who has not known this in thinking of politics? We talk\r\nof poverty and forget poor people; we make rules for vagrancy--we forget\r\nthe vagrant. Some of our best-intentioned political schemes, like reform\r\ncolonies and scientific jails, turn out to be inhuman tyrannies just\r\nbecause our imagination does not penetrate the sociological label. \"We\r\nmove amidst generalities and symbols ... we live in a zone midway between\r\nthings and ourselves, external to things, external also to ourselves.\"\r\nThis is what works of art help to correct: \"Behind the commonplace,\r\nconventional expression that both reveals and conceals an individual\r\nmental state, it is the emotion, the original mood, to which they attain\r\nin its undefiled essence.\"\r\n\r\nThis directness of vision fertilizes thought. Without a strong artistic\r\ntradition, the life and so the politics of a nation sink into a barren\r\nroutine. A country populated by pure logicians and mathematical\r\nscientists would, I believe, produce few inventions. For creation, even\r\nof scientific truth, is no automatic product of logical thought or\r\nscientific method, and it has been well said that the greatest\r\ndiscoveries in science are brilliant guesses on insufficient evidence. A\r\nnation must, so to speak, live close to its own life, be intimate and\r\nsympathetic with natural events. That is what gives understanding, and\r\njustifies the observation that the intuitions of scientific discovery and\r\nthe artist's perceptions are closely related. It is perhaps not\r\naltogether without significance for us that primitive science and poetry\r\nwere indistinguishable. Nor is it strange that latter-day research should\r\nconfirm so many sayings of the poets. In all great ages art and science\r\nhave enriched each other. It is only eccentric poets and narrow\r\nspecialists who lock the doors. The human spirit doesn't grow in\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nI shall not press the point for it would lead us far afield. It is enough\r\nthat we remember the close alliance of art, science and politics in\r\nAthens, in Florence and Venice at their zenith. We in America have\r\ndivorced them completely: both art and politics exist in a condition of\r\nunnatural celibacy. Is this not a contributing factor to the futility and\r\nopacity of our political thinking? We have handed over the government of\r\na nation of people to a set of lawyers, to a class of men who deal in the\r\nmost verbal and unreal of all human attainments.\r\n\r\nA lively artistic tradition is essential to the humanizing of politics.\r\nIt is the soil in which invention flourishes and the organized knowledge\r\nof science attains its greatest reality. Let me illustrate from another\r\nfield of interests. The religious investigations of William James were a\r\nstudy, not of ecclesiastical institutions or the history of creeds. They\r\nwere concerned with religious experience, of which churches and rituals\r\nare nothing but the external satisfaction. As Graham Wallas is\r\nendeavoring to make human nature the center of politics, so James made it\r\nthe center of religions. It was a work of genius, yet no one would claim\r\nthat it is a mature psychology of the \"Varieties of Religious\r\nExperience.\" It is rather a survey and a description, done with the eye\r\nof an artist and the method of a scientist. We know from it more of what\r\nreligious feeling is like, even though we remain ignorant of its sources.\r\nAnd this intimacy humanizes religious controversy and brings\r\necclesiasticism back to men.\r\n\r\nLike most of James's psychology, it opens up investigation instead of\r\nconcluding it. In the light even of our present knowledge we can see how\r\nprimitive his treatment was. But James's services cannot be\r\noverestimated: if he did not lay even the foundations of a science, he\r\ndid lay some of the foundations for research. It was an immense\r\nillumination and a warming of interest. It threw open the gates to the\r\nwhole landscape of possibilities. It was a ventilation of thought.\r\nSomething similar will have to be done for political psychology. We know\r\nhow far off is the profound and precise knowledge we desire. But we know\r\ntoo that we have a right to hope for an increasing acquaintance with the\r\nvarieties of political experience. It would, of course, be drawn from\r\nbiography, from the human aspect of history and daily observation. We\r\nshould begin to know what it is that we ought to know. Such a work would\r\nbe stimulating to politician and psychologist. The statesman's\r\nimagination would be guided and organized; it would give him a\r\nstarting-point for his own understanding of human beings in politics. To\r\nthe scientists it would be a challenge--to bring these facts under the\r\nlight of their researches, to extend these researches to the borders of\r\nthose facts.\r\n\r\nThe statesman has another way of strengthening his grip upon the\r\ncomplexity of life. Statistics help. This method is neither so conclusive\r\nas the devotees say, nor so bad as the people who are awed by it would\r\nlike to believe. Voting, as Gabriel Tarde points out, is our most\r\nconspicuous use of statistics. Mystical democrats believe that an\r\nelection expresses the will of the people, and that that will is wise.\r\nMystical democrats are rare. Looked at closely an election shows the\r\nquantitative division of the people on several alternatives. That choice\r\nis not necessarily wise, but it is wise to heed that choice. For it is a\r\nrough estimate of an important part of the community's sentiment, and no\r\nstatecraft can succeed that violates it. It is often immensely suggestive\r\nof what a large number of people are in the future going to wish.\r\nDemocracy, because it registers popular feeling, is at least trying to\r\nbuild truly, and is for that reason an enlightened form of government. So\r\nwe who are democrats need not believe that the people are necessarily\r\nright in their choice: some of us are always in the minority, and not a\r\nlittle proud of the distinction. Voting does not extract wisdom from\r\nmultitudes: its real value is to furnish wisdom about multitudes. Our\r\nfaith in democracy has this very solid foundation: that no leader's\r\nwisdom can be applied unless the democracy comes to approve of it. To\r\ngovern a democracy you have to educate it: that contact with great masses\r\nof men reciprocates by educating the leader. \"The consent of the\r\ngoverned\" is more than a safeguard against ignorant tyrants: it is an\r\ninsurance against benevolent despots as well. In a rough way and with\r\nmany exceptions, democracy compels law to approximate human need. It is a\r\nlittle difficult to see this when you live right in the midst of one. But\r\nin perspective there can be little question that of all governments\r\ndemocracy is the most relevant. Only humane laws can be successfully\r\nenforced; and they are the only ones really worth enforcing. Voting is a\r\nformal method of registering consent.\r\n\r\nBut all statistical devices are open to abuse and require constant\r\ncorrection. Bribery, false counting, disfranchisement are the cruder\r\ndeceptions; they correspond to those enrolment statistics of a large\r\nuniversity which are artificially fed by counting the same student\r\nseveral times if his courses happen to span two or three of the\r\ndepartments. Just as deceptive as plain fraud is the deceptive ballot. We\r\nall know how when the political tricksters were compelled to frame a\r\ndirect primary law in New York they fixed the ballot so that it botched\r\nthe election. Corporations have been known to do just that to their\r\nreports. Did not E. H. Harriman say of a well-known statistician that he\r\ncould make an annual report tell any story you pleased? Still subtler is\r\nthe seven-foot ballot of stupid, good intentions--the hyperdemocratic\r\nballot in which you are asked to vote for the State Printer, and succeed\r\nonly in voting under the party emblem.\r\n\r\nStatistics then is no automatic device for measuring facts. You and I are\r\nforever at the mercy of the census-taker and the census-maker. That\r\nimpertinent fellow who goes from house to house is one of the real\r\nmasters of the statistical situation. The other is the man who organizes\r\nthe results. For all the conclusions in the end rest upon their accuracy,\r\nhonesty, energy and insight. Of course, in an obvious census like that of\r\nthe number of people personal bias counts for so little that it is lost\r\nin the grand total. But the moment you begin inquiries into subjects\r\nwhich people prefer to conceal, the weakness of statistics becomes\r\nobvious. All figures which touch upon sexual subjects are nothing but the\r\nroughest guesses. No one would take a census of prostitution,\r\nillegitimacy, adultery, or venereal disease for a statement of reliable\r\nfacts. There are religious statistics, but who that has traveled among\r\nmen would regard the number of professing Christians as any index of the\r\nstrength of Christianity, or the church attendance as a measure of\r\ndevotion? In the supremely important subject of literacy, what\r\nclassification yet devised can weigh the culture of masses of people? We\r\nsay that such a percentage of the population cannot read or write. But\r\nthe test of reading and writing is crude and clumsy. It is often\r\nadministered by men who are themselves half-educated, and it is shot\r\nthrough with racial and class prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe statistical method is of use only to those who have found it out.\r\nThis is achieved principally by absorbing into your thinking a lively\r\ndoubt about all classifications and general terms, for they are the basis\r\nof statistical measurement. That done you are fairly proof against\r\nseduction. No better popular statement of this is to be found than H. G.\r\nWells' little essay: \"Skepticism of the Instrument.\" Wells has, of\r\ncourse, made no new discovery. The history of philosophy is crowded with\r\nquarrels as to how seriously we ought to take our classifications: a\r\nlarge part of the battle about Nominalism turns on this, the Empirical\r\nand Rational traditions divide on it; in our day the attacks of James,\r\nBergson, and the \"anti-intellectualists\" are largely a continuation of\r\nthis old struggle. Wells takes his stand very definitely with those who\r\nregard classification \"as serviceable for the practical purposes of life\"\r\nbut nevertheless \"a departure from the objective truth of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take the word chair,\" he writes. \"When one says chair, one thinks\r\nvaguely of an average chair. But collect individual instances, think of\r\narmchairs and reading-chairs, and dining-room chairs and kitchen chairs,\r\nchairs that pass into benches, chairs that cross the boundary and become\r\nsettees, dentists' chairs, thrones, opera stalls, seats of all sorts,\r\nthose miraculous fungoid growths that cumber the floor of the Arts and\r\nCrafts Exhibition, and you will perceive what a lax bundle in fact is\r\nthis simple straightforward term. In co-operation with an intelligent\r\njoiner I would undertake to defeat any definition of chair or\r\nchairishness that you gave me.\" Think then of the glib way in which we\r\nspeak of \"the unemployed,\" \"the unfit,\" \"the criminal,\" \"the\r\nunemployable,\" and how easily we forget that behind these general terms\r\nare unique individuals with personal histories and varying needs.\r\n\r\nEven the most refined statistics are nothing but an abstraction. But if\r\nthat truth is held clearly before the mind, the polygons and curves of\r\nthe statisticians can be used as a skeleton to which the imagination and\r\nour general sense of life give some flesh and blood reality. Human\r\nstatistics are illuminating to those who know humanity. I would not trust\r\na hermit's inferences about the statistics of anything.\r\n\r\nIt is then no simple formula which answers our question. The problem of a\r\nhuman politics is not solved by a catch phrase. Criticism, of which these\r\nessays are a piece, can give the direction we must travel. But for the\r\nrest there is no smooth road built, no swift and sure conveyance at the\r\ndoor. We set out as if we knew; we act on the notions of man that we\r\npossess. Literature refines, science deepens, various devices extend it.\r\nThose who act on the knowledge at hand are the men of affairs. And all\r\nthe while, research studies their results, artists express subtler\r\nperceptions, critics refine and adapt the general culture of the times.\r\nThere is no other way but through this vast collaboration.\r\n\r\nThere is no short cut to civilization. We say that the truth will make us\r\nfree. Yes, but that truth is a thousand truths which grow and change. Nor\r\ndo I see a final state of blessedness. The world's end will surely find\r\nus still engaged in answering riddles. This changing focus in politics is\r\na tendency at work all through our lives. There are many experiments. But\r\nthe effort is half-conscious; only here and there does it rise to a\r\ndeliberate purpose. To make it an avowed ideal--a thing of will and\r\nintelligence--is to hasten its coming, to illumine its blunders, and, by\r\ngiving it self-criticism, to convert mistakes into wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWELL MEANING BUT UNMEANING: THE CHICAGO VICE REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn casting about for a concrete example to illustrate some of the points\r\nunder discussion I hesitated a long time before the wealth of material.\r\nNo age has produced such a multitude of elaborate studies, and any\r\nselection was, of course, a limiting one. The Minority Report of the\r\nEnglish Poor Law Commission has striking merits and defects, but for our\r\npurposes it inheres too deeply in British conditions. American tariff and\r\ntrust investigations are massive enough in all conscience, but they are\r\nso partisan in their origin and so pathetically unattached to any\r\nrecognized ideal of public policy that it seemed better to look\r\nelsewhere. Conservation had the virtue of arising out of a provident\r\nstatesmanship, but its problems were largely technical.\r\n\r\nThe real choice narrowed itself finally to the Pittsburgh Survey and the\r\nChicago Vice Report. Had I been looking for an example of the finest\r\nexpert inquiry, there would have been little question that the vivid and\r\nintensive study of Pittsburgh's industrialism was the example to use. But\r\nI was looking for something more representative, and, therefore, more\r\nrevealing. I did not want a detached study of some specially selected\r\ncross-section of what is after all not the typical economic life of\r\nAmerica. The case demanded was one in which you could see representative\r\nAmerican citizens trying to handle a problem which had touched their\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nVice is such a problem. You can always get a hearing about it; there is\r\nno end of interest in the question. Rare indeed is that community which\r\nhas not been \"Lexowed,\" in which a district attorney or a minister has\r\nnot led a crusade. Muckraking began with the exposure of vice; men like\r\nHeney, Lindsey, Folk founded their reputations on the fight against it.\r\nIt would be interesting to know how much of the social conscience of our\r\ntime had as its first insight the prostitute on the city pavement.\r\n\r\nWe do not have to force an interest, as we do about the trusts, or even\r\nabout the poor. For this problem lies close indeed to the dynamics of our\r\nown natures. Research is stimulated, actively aroused, and a passionate\r\nzeal suffuses what is perhaps the most spontaneous reform enthusiasm of\r\nour time. Looked at externally it is a curious focusing of attention. Nor\r\nis it explained by words like \"chivalry,\" \"conscience,\" \"social\r\ncompassion.\" Magazines that will condone a thousand cruelties to women\r\ngladly publish series of articles on the girl who goes wrong; merchants\r\nwho sweat and rack their women employees serve gallantly on these\r\ncommissions. These men are not conscious hypocrites. Perhaps like the\r\nrest of us they are impelled by forces they are not eager to examine. I\r\ndo not press the point. It belongs to the analyst of motive.\r\n\r\nWe need only note the vast interest in the subject--that it extends\r\nacross class lines, and expresses itself as an immense good-will. Perhaps\r\na largely unconscious absorption in a subject is itself a sign of great\r\nimportance. Surely vice has a thousand implications that touch all of us\r\ndirectly. It is closely related to most of the interests of\r\nlife--ramifying into industry, into the family, health, play, art,\r\nreligion. The miseries it entails are genuine miseries--not points of\r\netiquette or infringements of convention. Vice issues in pain. The world\r\nsuffers for it. To attack it is to attack as far-reaching and real a\r\nproblem as any that we human beings face.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Commission had no simple, easily measured problem before it.\r\nAt the very outset the report confesses that an accurate count of the\r\nnumber of prostitutes in Chicago could not be reached. The police lists\r\nare obviously incomplete and perhaps corrupt. The whole amorphous field\r\nof clandestine vice will, of course, defeat any census. But even public\r\nprostitution is so varied that nobody can do better than estimate it\r\nroughly. This point is worth keeping in mind, for it lights up the\r\nremedies proposed. What the Commission advocates is the constant\r\nrepression and the ultimate annihilation of a mode of life which refuses\r\ndiscovery and measurement.\r\n\r\nThe report estimates that there are five thousand women in Chicago who\r\ndevote their whole time to the traffic; that the annual profits in that\r\none city alone are between fifteen and sixteen million dollars a year.\r\nThese figures are admittedly low for they leave out all consideration of\r\noccasional, or seasonal, or hidden prostitution. It is only the nucleus\r\nthat can be guessed at; the fringe which shades out into various degrees\r\nof respectability remains entirely unmeasured. Yet these suburbs of the\r\nTenderloin must always be kept in mind; their population is shifting and\r\nvery elastic; it includes the unsuspected; and I am inclined to believe\r\nthat it is the natural refuge of the \"suppressed\" prostitute. Moreover it\r\ndefies control.\r\n\r\nThe 1012 women recognized on the police lists are of course the most\r\neasily studied. From them we can gather some hint of the enormous\r\nbewildering demand that prostitution answers. The Commission informs us\r\nthat this small group alone receives over fifteen thousand visits a\r\nday--five million and a half in the year. Yet these 1012 women are only\r\nabout one-fifth of the professional prostitutes in Chicago. If the\r\naverage continues, then the figures mount to something over 27,000,000.\r\nThe five thousand professionals do not begin to represent the whole\r\nillicit traffic of a city like Chicago. Clandestine and occasional vice\r\nis beyond all measurement.\r\n\r\nThe figures I have given are taken from the report. They are said to be\r\nconservative. For the purposes of this discussion we could well lower the\r\n27,000,000 by half. All I am concerned about is in arriving at a sense of\r\nthe enormity of the impulse behind the \"social evil.\" For it is this that\r\nthe Commission proposes to repress, and ultimately to annihilate.\r\n\r\nLust has a thousand avenues. The brothel, the flat, the assignation\r\nhouse, the tenement, saloons, dance halls, steamers, ice-cream parlors,\r\nTurkish baths, massage parlors, street-walking--the thing has woven\r\nitself into the texture of city life. Like the hydra, it grows new heads,\r\neverywhere. It draws into its service the pleasures of the city.\r\nEntangled with the love of gaiety, organized as commerce, it is literally\r\nimpossible to follow the myriad expressions it assumes.\r\n\r\nThe Commission gives a very fair picture of these manifestations. A mass\r\nof material is offered which does in a way show where and how and to what\r\nextent lust finds its illicit expression. Deeper than this the report\r\ndoes not go. The human impulses which create these social conditions, the\r\nhuman needs to which they are a sad and degraded answer--this human\r\ncenter of the problem the commission passes by with a platitude.\r\n\r\n\"So long as there is lust in the hearts of men,\" we are told, \"it will\r\nseek out some method of expression. Until the hearts of men are changed\r\nwe can hope for no absolute annihilation of the Social Evil.\" But at the\r\nhead of the report in black-faced type we read:\r\n\r\n\"Constant and persistent repression of prostitution the immediate method;\r\nabsolute annihilation the ultimate ideal.\"\r\n\r\nI am not trying to catch the Commissioners in a verbal inconsistency. The\r\ninconsistency is real, out of a deep-seated confusion of mind. Lust will\r\nseek an expression, they say, until \"the hearts of men are changed.\" All\r\nparticular expressions are evil and must be constantly repressed. Yet\r\nthough you repress one form of lust, it will seek some other. Now, says\r\nthe Commission, in order to change the hearts of men, religion and\r\neducation must step in. It is their business to eradicate an impulse\r\nwhich is constantly changing form by being \"suppressed.\"\r\n\r\nThere is only one meaning in this: the Commission realized vaguely that\r\nrepression is not even the first step to a cure. For reasons worth\r\nanalyzing later, these representative American citizens desired both the\r\nimmediate taboo and an ultimate annihilation of vice. So they fell into\r\nthe confusion of making immediate and detailed proposals that have\r\nnothing to do with the attainment of their ideal.\r\n\r\nWhat the commission saw and described were the particular forms which a\r\ngreat human impulse had assumed at a specific date in a certain city. The\r\ndynamic force which created these conditions, which will continue to\r\ncreate them--lust--they refer to in a few pious sentences. Their\r\nthinking, in short, is perfectly static and literally superficial. In\r\noutlining a ripple they have forgotten the tides.\r\n\r\nHad they faced the human sources of their problem, had they tried to\r\nthink of the social evil as an answer to a human need, their researches\r\nwould have been different, their remedies fruitful. Suppose they had kept\r\nin mind their own statement: \"so long as there is lust in the hearts of\r\nmen it will seek out some method of expression.\" Had they held fast to\r\nthat, it would have ceased to be a platitude and have become a fertile\r\nidea. For a platitude is generally inert wisdom.\r\n\r\nIn the sentence I quote the Commissioners had an idea which might have\r\nanimated all their labors. But they left it in limbo, they reverenced it,\r\nand they passed by. Perhaps we can raise it again and follow the hints it\r\nunfolds.\r\n\r\nIf lust will seek an expression, are all expressions of it necessarily\r\nevil? That the kind of expression which the Commission describes is evil\r\nno one will deny. But is it the only possible expression?\r\n\r\nIf it is, then the taboo enforced by a Morals Police is, perhaps, as good\r\na way as any of gaining a fictitious sense of activity. But the ideal of\r\n\"annihilation\" becomes an irrelevant and meaningless phrase. If lust is\r\ndeeply rooted in men and its only expression is evil, I for one should\r\nrecommend a faith in the millennium. You can put this Paradise at the\r\nbeginning of the world or the end of it. Practical difference there is\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nNo one can read the report without coming to a definite conviction that\r\nthe Commission regards lust itself as inherently evil. The members\r\nassumed without criticism the traditional dogma of Christianity that sex\r\nin any manifestation outside of marriage is sinful. But practical sense\r\ntold them that sex cannot be confined within marriage. It will find\r\nexpression--\"some method of expression\" they say. What never occurred to\r\nthem was that it might find a good, a positively beneficent method. The\r\nutterly uncriticised assumption that all expressions not legalized are\r\nsinful shut them off from any constructive answer to their problem.\r\nSeeing prostitution or something equally bad as the only way sex can find\r\nan expression they really set before religion and education the\r\nimpossible task of removing lust \"from the hearts of men.\" So when their\r\nreport puts at its head that absolute annihilation of prostitution is the\r\nultimate ideal, we may well translate it into the real intent of the\r\nCommission. What is to be absolutely annihilated is not alone\r\nprostitution, not alone all the methods of expression which lust seeks\r\nout, but lust itself.\r\n\r\nThat this is what the Commission had in mind is supported by plenty of\r\n\"internal evidence.\" For example: one of the most curious recommendations\r\nmade is about divorce--\"The Commission condemns the ease with which\r\ndivorces may be obtained in certain States, and recommends a stringent,\r\nuniform divorce law for all States.\"\r\n\r\nWhat did the Commission have in mind? I transcribe the paragraph which\r\ndeals with divorce: \"The Vice Commission, after exhaustive consideration\r\nof the vice question, records itself of the opinion that divorce to a\r\nlarge extent is a contributory factor to sexual vice. No study of this\r\nblight upon the social and moral life of the country would be\r\ncomprehensive without consideration of the causes which lead to the\r\napplication for divorce. These are too numerous to mention at length in\r\nsuch a report as this, but the Commission does wish to emphasize the\r\ngreat need of more safeguards against the marrying of persons physically,\r\nmentally and morally unfit to take up the responsibilities of family\r\nlife, including the bearing of children.\"\r\n\r\nNow to be sure that paragraph leaves much to be desired so far as\r\nclearness goes. But I think the meaning can be extracted. Divorce is a\r\ncontributory factor to sexual vice. One way presumably is that divorced\r\nwomen often become prostitutes. That is an evil contribution,\r\nunquestionably. The second sentence says that no study of the social evil\r\nis complete which leaves out the _causes_ of divorce. One of those causes\r\nis, I suppose, adultery with a prostitute. This evil is totally different\r\nfrom the first: in one case divorce contributes to prostitution, in the\r\nother, prostitution leads to divorce. The third sentence urges greater\r\nsafeguards against undesirable marriages. This prudence would obviously\r\nreduce the need of divorce.\r\n\r\nHow does the recommendation of a stringent and uniform law fit in with\r\nthese three statements? A strict divorce law might be like New York's: it\r\nwould recognize few grounds for a decree. One of those grounds, perhaps\r\nthe chief one, would be adultery. I say this unhesitatingly for in\r\nanother place the Commission informs us that marriage has in it \"the\r\nelements of vested rights.\"\r\n\r\nA strict divorce law would, of course, diminish the number of \"divorced\r\nwomen,\" and perhaps keep them out of prostitution. It does fit the first\r\nstatement--in a helpless sort of way. But where does the difficulty of\r\ndivorce affect the causes of it? If you bind a man tightly to a woman he\r\ndoes not love, and, possibly prevent him from marrying one he does love,\r\nhow do you add to his virtue? And if the only way he can free himself is\r\nby adultery, does not your stringent divorce law put a premium upon vice?\r\nThe third sentence would make it difficult for the unfit to marry. Better\r\nmarriages would among other blessings require fewer divorces. But what of\r\nthose who are forbidden to marry? They are unprovided for. And yet who\r\nmore than they are likely to find desire uncontrollable and seek some\r\nother \"method of expression\"? With marriage prohibited and prostitution\r\ntabooed, the Commission has a choice between sterilization and--let us\r\nsay--other methods of expression.\r\n\r\nMake marriage difficult, divorce stringent, prostitution impossible--is\r\nthere any doubt that the leading idea is to confine the sex impulse\r\nwithin the marriage of healthy, intelligent, \"moral,\" and monogamous\r\ncouples? For all the other seekings of that impulse what has the\r\nCommission to offer? Nothing. That can be asserted flatly. The Commission\r\nhopes to wipe out prostitution. But it never hints that the success of\r\nits plan means vast alterations in our social life. The members give the\r\nimpression that they think of prostitution as something that can be\r\nsubtracted from our civilization without changing the essential character\r\nof its institutions. Yet who that has read the report itself and put\r\nhimself into any imaginative understanding of conditions can escape\r\nseeing that prostitution to-day is organic to our industrial life, our\r\nmarriage sanctions, and our social customs? Low wages, fatigue, and the\r\nwretched monotony of the factory--these must go before prostitution can\r\ngo. And behind these stand the facts of woman's entrance into\r\nindustry--facts that have one source at least in the general poverty of\r\nthe family. And that poverty is deeply bound up with the economic system\r\nunder which we live. In the man's problem, the growing impossibility of\r\nearly marriages is directly related to the business situation. Nor can we\r\nspeak of the degradation of religion and the arts, of amusement, of the\r\ngeneral morale of the people without referring that degradation to\r\nindustrial conditions.\r\n\r\nYou cannot look at civilization as a row of institutions each external to\r\nthe other. They interpenetrate and a change in one affects all the\r\nothers. To abolish prostitution would involve a radical alteration of\r\nsociety. Vice in our cities is a form of the sexual impulse--one of the\r\nforms it has taken under prevailing social conditions. It is, if you\r\nplease, like the crops of a rude and forbidding soil--a coarse, distorted\r\nthing though living.\r\n\r\nThe Commission studied a human problem and left humanity out. I do not\r\nmean that the members weren't deeply touched by the misery of these\r\nthousands of women. You can pity the poor without understanding them; you\r\ncan have compassion without insight. The Commissioners had a good deal of\r\nsympathy for the prostitute's condition, but for that \"lust in the hearts\r\nof men,\" and women we may add, for that, they had no sympathetic\r\nunderstanding. They did not place themselves within the impulse.\r\nOfficially they remained external to human desires. For what might be\r\ncalled the _élan vital_ of the problem they had no patience. Certain sad\r\nresults of the particular \"method of expression\" it had sought out in\r\nChicago called forth their pity and their horror.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Commission did not face the sexual impulse squarely. The\r\nreport is an attempt to deal with a sexual problem by disregarding its\r\nsource. There are almost a hundred recommendations to various\r\nauthorities--Federal, State, county, city, police, educational and\r\nothers. I have attempted to classify these proposals under four headings.\r\nThere are those which mean forcible repression of particular\r\nmanifestations--the taboos; there are the recommendations which are\r\npurely palliative, which aim to abate some of the horrors of existing\r\nconditions; there are a few suggestions for further investigation; and,\r\nfinally, there are the inventions, the plans which show some desire to\r\nfind moral equivalents for evil--the really statesmanlike offerings.\r\n\r\nThe palliative measures we may pass by quickly. So long as they do not\r\nblind people to the necessity for radical treatment, only a doctrinaire\r\nwould object to them. Like all intelligent charities they are still a\r\nnecessary evil. But nothing must be staked upon them, so let us turn at\r\nonce to the constructive suggestions: The Commission proposes that the\r\ncounty establish a \"Permanent Committee on Child Protection.\" It makes no\r\nattempt to say what that protection shall be, but I think it is only fair\r\nto let the wish father the thought, and regard this as an effort to give\r\nchildren a better start in life. The separation of delinquent from\r\nsemi-delinquent girls is a somewhat similar attempt to guard the weak.\r\nAnother is the recommendation to the city and the nation that it should\r\nprotect arriving immigrants, and if necessary escort them to their homes.\r\nThis surely is a constructive plan which might well be enlarged from mere\r\nprotection to positive hospitality. How great a part the desolating\r\nloneliness of a city plays in seductions the individual histories in the\r\nreport show. Municipal dance halls are a splendid proposal. Freed from a\r\ncold and over-chaperoned respectability they compete with the devil.\r\nThere, at least, is one method of sexual expression which may have\r\npositively beneficent results. A municipal lodging house for women is\r\nsomething of a substitute for the wretched rented room. A little\r\nsuggestion to the police that they send home children found on the\r\nstreets after nine o'clock has varied possibilities. But there is the\r\nseed of an invention in it which might convert the police from mere\r\nagents of repression to kindly helpers in the mazes of a city. The\r\neducational proposals are all constructive: the teaching of sex hygiene\r\nis guardedly recommended for consideration. That is entirely justified,\r\nfor no one can quarrel with a set of men for leaving a question open.\r\nThat girls from fourteen to sixteen should receive vocational training in\r\ncontinuation schools; that social centers should be established in the\r\npublic schools and that the grounds should be open for children--all of\r\nthese are clearly additions to the positive resource of the community. So\r\nis the suggestion that church buildings be used for recreation. The call\r\nfor greater parental responsibility is, I fear, a rather empty platitude,\r\nfor it is not re-enforced with anything but an ancient fervor.\r\n\r\nHow much of this really seeks to create a fine expression of the sexual\r\nimpulse? How many of these recommendations see sex as an instinct which\r\ncan be transmuted, and turned into one of the values of life? The dance\r\nhalls, the social centers, the playgrounds, the reception of\r\nstrangers--these can become instruments for civilizing sexual need. The\r\neducational proposals could become ways of directing it. They could, but\r\nwill they? Without the habit of mind which sees substitution as the\r\nessence of statecraft, without a philosophy which makes the invention of\r\nmoral equivalents its goal, I for one refuse to see in these\r\nrecommendations anything more than a haphazard shooting which has\r\naccidentally hit the mark. Moreover, I have a deep suspicion that I have\r\ntried to read into the proposals more than the Commission intended.\r\nCertainly these constructions occupy an insignificant amount of space in\r\nthe body of the report. On all sides of them is a mass of taboos. No\r\nemotional appeal is made for them as there is for the repressions. They\r\nstand largely unnoticed, and very much undefined--poor ghosts of the\r\ntruth among the gibbets.\r\n\r\nAn inadvertent platitude--that lust will seek an expression--and a few\r\ndiffident proposals for a finer environment--the need and its\r\nsatisfaction: had the Commission seen the relation of these incipient\r\nideas, animated it, and made it the nerve center of the study, a genuine\r\nprogram might have resulted. But the two ideas never met and fertilized\r\neach other. Nothing dynamic holds the recommendations together--the mass\r\nof them are taboos, an attempt to kill each mosquito and ignore the\r\nmarsh. The evils of prostitution are seen as a series of episodes, each\r\nof which must be clubbed, forbidden, raided and jailed.\r\n\r\nThere is a special whack for each mosquito: the laws about excursion\r\nboats should be enforced; the owners should help to enforce them; there\r\nshould be more officers with police power on these boats; the sale of\r\nliquor to minors should be forbidden; gambling devices should be\r\nsuppressed; the midwives, doctors and maternity hospitals practicing\r\nabortions should be investigated; employment agencies should be watched\r\nand investigated; publishers should be warned against printing suspicious\r\nadvertisements; the law against infamous crimes should be made more\r\nspecific; any citizen should have the right to bring equity proceedings\r\nagainst a brothel as a public nuisance; there should be relentless\r\nprosecution of professional procurers; there should be constant\r\nprosecution of the keepers, inmates, and owners of bawdy houses; there\r\nshould be prosecution of druggists who sells drugs and \"certain\r\nappliances\" illegally; there should be an identification system for\r\nprostitutes in the state courts; instead of fines, prostitutes should be\r\nvisited with imprisonment or adult probation; there should be a penalty\r\nfor sending messenger boys under twenty-one to a disorderly house or an\r\nunlicensed saloon; the law against prostitutes in saloons, against\r\nwine-rooms and stalls in saloons, against communication between saloons\r\nand brothels, against dancing in saloons--should be strictly enforced;\r\nthe police who enforce these laws should be carefully watched, grafters\r\namongst them should be discharged; complaints should be investigated at\r\nonce by a man stationed outside the district; the pressure of publicity\r\nshould be brought against the brewers to prevent them from doing business\r\nwith saloons that violate the law; the Retail Liquor Association should\r\ndiscipline law-breaking saloon-keepers: licenses should be permanently\r\nrevoked for violations; no women should be allowed in a saloon without a\r\nmale escort; no professional or paid escorts should be permitted; no\r\nsoliciting should be allowed in saloons; no immoral or vulgar dances\r\nshould be permitted in saloons; no intoxicating liquor should be allowed\r\nat any public dance; there should be a municipal detention home for\r\nwomen, with probation officers; police inspectors who fail to report\r\nlaw-violations should be dismissed; assignation houses should be\r\nsuppressed as soon as they are reported; there should be a \"special\r\nmorals police squad\"; recommendation IX \"to the Police\" says they \"should\r\nwage a relentless warfare against houses of prostitution, immoral flats,\r\nassignation rooms, call houses, and disorderly saloons in all sections of\r\nthe city\"; parks and playgrounds should be more thoroughly policed;\r\ndancing pavilions should exclude professional prostitutes; soliciting in\r\nparks should be suppressed; parks should be lighted with a search-light;\r\nthere should be no seats in the shadows....\r\n\r\nTo perform that staggering list of things that \"should\" be done you\r\nfind--what?--the police power, federal, state, municipal. Note how vague\r\nand general are the chance constructive suggestions; how precise and\r\ndefinite the taboos. Surely I am not misstating its position when I say\r\nthat forcible suppression was the creed of this Commission. Nor is there\r\nany need of insisting again that the ultimate ideal of annihilating\r\nprostitution has nothing to expect from the concrete proposals that were\r\nmade. The millennial goal was one thing; the immediate method quite\r\nanother. For ideals, a pious phrase; in practice, the police.\r\n\r\nAre we not told that \"if the citizens cannot depend upon the men\r\nappointed to protect their property, and to maintain order, then chaos\r\nand disorganization resulting in vice and crime must follow?\" Yet of all\r\nthe reeds that civilization leans upon, surely the police is the\r\nfrailest. Anyone who has had the smallest experience of municipal\r\npolitics knows that the corruption of the police is directly\r\nproportionate to the severity of the taboos it is asked to enforce. Tom\r\nJohnson saw this as Mayor of Cleveland; he knew that strict law\r\nenforcement against saloons, brothels, and gambling houses would not stop\r\nvice, but would corrupt the police. I recommend the recent spectacle in\r\nNew York where the most sensational raider of gambling houses has turned\r\nout to be in crooked alliance with the gamblers. And I suggest as a hint\r\nthat the Commission's recommendations enforced for one year will lay the\r\nfoundation of an organized system of blackmail and \"protection,\" secrecy\r\nand underground chicanery, the like of which Chicago has not yet seen.\r\nBut the Commission need only have read its own report, have studied its\r\nown cases. There is an illuminating chapter on \"The Social Evil and the\r\nPolice.\" In the summary, the Commission says that \"officers on the beat\r\nare bold and open in their neglect of duty, drinking in saloons while in\r\nuniform, ignoring the solicitations by prostitutes in rear rooms and on\r\nthe streets, selling tickets at dances frequented by professional and\r\nsemi-professional prostitutes; protecting 'cadets,' prostitutes and\r\nsaloon-keepers of disorderly places.\"\r\n\r\nSome suspicion that the police could not carry the burden of suppressing\r\nthe social evil must have dawned on the Commission.\r\n\r\nIt felt the need of re-enforcement. Hence the special morals police\r\nsquad; hence the investigation of the police of one district by the\r\npolice from another; and hence, in type as black as that of the ideal\r\nitself and directly beneath it, the call for \"the appointment of a morals\r\ncommission\" and \"the establishment of a morals court.\" Now this\r\ncommission consists of the Health Officer, a physician and three citizens\r\nwho serve without pay. It is appointed by the Mayor and approved by the\r\nCity Council. Its business is to prosecute vice and to help enforce the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nJust what would happen if the Morals Commission didn't prosecute hard\r\nenough I do not know. Conceivably the Governor might be induced to\r\nappoint a Commission on Moral Commissions in Cities. But why the men and\r\nwomen who framed the report made this particular recommendation is an\r\ninteresting question. With federal, state, and municipal authorities in\r\nexistence, with courts, district attorneys, police all operating, they\r\ncreate another arm of prosecution. Possibly they were somewhat\r\ndisillusioned about the present instruments of the taboo; perhaps\r\nthey imagined that a new broom would sweep clean. But I suspect an\r\ninner reason. The Commission may have imagined that the four\r\nappointees--unpaid--would be four men like themselves--who knows, perhaps\r\nfour men from among themselves? The whole tenor of their thinking is to\r\nset somebody watching everybody and somebody else to watching him. What\r\nis more natural than that they should be the Ultimate Watchers?\r\n\r\nSpying, informing, constant investigations of everybody and everything\r\nmust become the rule where there is a forcible attempt to moralize\r\nsociety from the top. Nobody's heart is in the work very long; nobody's\r\nbut those fanatical and morbid guardians of morality who make it a life's\r\nspecialty. The aroused public opinion which the Commission asks for\r\ncannot be held if all it has to fix upon is an elaborate series of\r\ntaboos. Sensational disclosures will often make the public flare up\r\nspasmodically; but the mass of men is soon bored by intricate rules and\r\ntangles of red tape; the \"crusade\" is looked upon as a melodrama of real\r\nlife--interesting, but easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe method proposed ignores the human source: by a kind of poetic justice\r\nthe great crowd of men will ignore the method. If you want to impose a\r\ntaboo upon a whole community, you must do it autocratically, you must\r\nmake it part of the prevailing superstitions. You must never let it reach\r\nany public analysis. For it will fail, it will receive only a shallow\r\nsupport from what we call an \"enlightened public opinion.\" That opinion\r\nis largely determined by the real impulses of men; and genuine character\r\nrejects or at least rebels against foreign, unnatural impositions. This\r\nis one of the great virtues of democracy--that it makes alien laws more\r\nand more difficult to enforce. The tyrant can use the taboo a thousand\r\ntimes more effectively than the citizens of a republic. When he speaks,\r\nit is with a prestige that dumbs questioning and makes obedience a habit.\r\nLet that infallibility come to be doubted, as in Russia to-day, and\r\nnatural impulses reassert themselves, the great impositions begin to\r\nweaken. The methods of the Chicago Commission would require a tyranny, a\r\npowerful, centralized sovereignty which could command with majesty and\r\nsilence the rebel. In our shirt-sleeved republic no such power exists.\r\nThe strongest force we have is that of organized money, and that\r\nsovereignty is too closely connected with the social evil, too dependent\r\nupon it in a hundred different ways, to undertake the task of\r\nsuppression.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the Commission democracy is an inefficient weapon.\r\nNothing but disappointment is in store for men who expect a people to\r\noutrage its own character. A large part of the unfaith in democracy, of\r\nthe desire to ignore \"the mob,\" limit the franchise, and confine power to\r\nthe few is the result of an unsuccessful attempt to make republics act\r\nlike old-fashioned monarchies. Almost every \"crusade\" leaves behind it a\r\ntrail of yearning royalists; many \"good-government\" clubs are little\r\nwould-be oligarchies.\r\n\r\nWhen the mass of men emerged from slavish obedience and made democracy\r\ninevitable, the taboo entered upon its final illness. For the more\r\nself-governing a people becomes, the less possible it is to prescribe\r\nexternal restrictions. The gap between want and ought, between nature and\r\nideals cannot be maintained. The only practical ideals in a democracy are\r\na fine expression of natural wants. This happens to be a thoroughly Greek\r\nattitude. But I learned it first from the Bowery. Chuck Connors is\r\nreported to have said that \"a gentleman is a bloke as can do whatever he\r\nwants to do.\" If Chuck said that, he went straight to the heart of that\r\ndemocratic morality on which a new statecraft must ultimately rest. His\r\ngentleman is not the battlefield of wants and prohibitions; in him\r\nimpulses flow freely through beneficent channels.\r\n\r\nThe same notion lies imbedded in the phrase: \"government must serve the\r\npeople.\" That means a good deal more than that elected officials must\r\nrule for the majority. For the majority in these semi-democratic times is\r\noften as not a cloak for the ruling oligarchy. Representatives who\r\n\"serve\" some majorities may in reality order the nation about. To serve\r\nthe people means to provide it with services--with clean streets and\r\nwater, with education, with opportunity, with beneficent channels for its\r\ndesires, with moral equivalents for evil. The task is turned from the\r\ndamming and restricting of wants to the creation of fine environments for\r\nthem. And the environment of an impulse extends all the way from the\r\nhuman body, through family life and education out into the streets of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nHad the Commission worked along democratic lines, we should have had\r\nrecommendations about the hygiene and early training of children, their\r\neducation, the houses they live in and the streets in which they play;\r\nchanges would have been suggested in the industrial conditions they face;\r\nplans would have been drawn for recreation; hints would have been\r\ncollected for transmuting the sex impulse into art, into social endeavor,\r\ninto religion. That is the constructive approach to the problem. I note\r\nthat the Commission calls upon the churches for help. Its obvious\r\nintention was to down sex with religion. What was not realized, it seems,\r\nis that this very sex impulse, so largely degraded into vice, is the\r\ndynamic force in religious feeling. One need not call in the testimony of\r\nthe psychologists, the students of religion, the æstheticians or even of\r\nPlato, who in the \"Symposium\" traced out the hierarchy of love from the\r\nbody to the \"whole sea of beauty.\" Jane Addams in Chicago has tested the\r\ntruth by her own wide experience, and she has written what the Commission\r\nmight easily have read,--that \"in failing to diffuse and utilize this\r\nfundamental instinct of sex through the imagination, we not only\r\ninadvertently foster vice and enervation, but we throw away one of the\r\nmost precious implements for ministering to life's highest needs. There\r\nis no doubt that this ill-adjusted function consumes quite unnecessarily\r\nvast stores of vital energy, even when we contemplate it in its immature\r\nmanifestations which are infinitely more wholesome than the dumb swamping\r\nprocess. All high school boys and girls know the difference between the\r\nconcentration and the diffusion of this impulse, although they would be\r\nhopelessly bewildered by the use of terms. They will declare one of their\r\ncompanions to be 'in love' if his fancy is occupied by the image of a\r\nsingle person about whom all the new-found values gather, and without\r\nwhom his solitude is an eternal melancholy. But if the stimulus does not\r\nappear as a definite image, and the values evoked are dispensed over the\r\nworld, the young person suddenly seems to have discovered a beauty and\r\nsignificance in many things--he responds to poetry, he becomes a lover of\r\nnature, he is filled with religious devotion or with philanthropic zeal.\r\nExperience, with young people, easily illustrates the possibility and\r\nvalue of diffusion.\"\r\n\r\nIt is then not only impossible to confine sex to mere reproduction; it\r\nwould be a stupid denial of the finest values of civilization. Having\r\nseen that the impulse is a necessary part of character, we must not hold\r\nto it grudgingly as a necessary evil. It is, on the contrary, the very\r\nsource of good. Whoever has visited Hull House can see for himself the\r\nearnest effort Miss Addams has made to treat sex with dignity and joy.\r\nFor Hull House differs from most settlements in that it is full of\r\npictures, of color, and of curios. The atmosphere is light; you feel none\r\nof that moral oppression which hangs over the usual settlement as over a\r\ngathering of missionaries. Miss Addams has not only made Hull House a\r\nbeautiful place; she has stocked it with curious and interesting objects.\r\nThe theater, the museum, the crafts and the arts, games and dances--they\r\nare some of those \"other methods of expression which lust can seek.\" It\r\nis no accident that Hull House is the most successful settlement in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nYet who does not feel its isolation in that brutal city? A little Athens\r\nin a vast barbarism--you wonder how much of Chicago Hull House can\r\ncivilize. As you walk those grim streets and look into the stifling\r\nhouses, or picture the relentless stockyards, the conviction that vice\r\nand its misery cannot be transmuted by policemen and Morals Commissions,\r\nthe feeling that spying and inspecting and prosecuting will not drain the\r\nmarsh becomes a certainty. You want to shout at the forcible moralizer:\r\n\"so long as you acquiesce in the degradation of your city, so long as\r\nwork remains nothing but ill-paid drudgery and every instinct of joy is\r\nmocked by dirt and cheapness and brutality,--just so long will your\r\nefforts be fruitless, yes even though you raid and prosecute, even though\r\nyou make Comstock the Czar of Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hull House cannot remake Chicago. A few hundred lives can be changed,\r\nand for the rest it is a guide to the imagination. Like all utopias, it\r\ncannot succeed, but it may point the way to success. If Hull House is\r\nunable to civilize Chicago, it at least shows Chicago and America what a\r\ncivilization might be like. Friendly, where our cities are friendless,\r\nbeautiful, where they are ugly; sociable and open, where our daily life\r\nis furtive; work a craft; art a participation--it is in miniature the\r\ngoal of statesmanship. If Chicago were like Hull House, we say to\r\nourselves, then vice would be no problem--it would dwindle, what was left\r\nwould be the Falstaff in us all, and only a spiritual anemia could worry\r\nover that jolly and redeeming coarseness.\r\n\r\nWhat stands between Chicago and civilization? No one can doubt that to\r\nabolish prostitution means to abolish the slum and the dirty alley, to\r\nstop overwork, underpay, the sweating and the torturing monotony of\r\nbusiness, to breathe a new life into education, ventilate society with\r\nfrankness, and fill life with play and art, with games, with passions\r\nwhich hold and suffuse the imagination.\r\n\r\nIt is a revolutionary task, and like all real revolutions it will not be\r\ndone in a day or a decade because someone orders it to be done. A change\r\nin the whole quality of life is something that neither the policeman's\r\nclub nor an insurrectionary raid can achieve. If you want a revolution\r\nthat shall really matter in human life--and what sane man can help\r\ndesiring it?--you must look to the infinitely complicated results of the\r\ndynamic movements in society. These revolutions require a rare\r\ncombination of personal audacity and social patience. The best agents of\r\nsuch a revolution are men who are bold in their plans because they\r\nrealize how deep and enormous is the task.\r\n\r\nMany people have sought an analogy in our Civil War. They have said that\r\nas \"black slavery\" went, so must \"white slavery.\" In the various\r\nagitations of vigilance committees and alliances for the suppression of\r\nthe traffic they profess to see continued a work which the abolitionists\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nIn A. M. Simons' brilliant book on \"Social Forces in American History\"\r\nmuch help can be found. For example: \"Massachusetts abolished slavery at\r\nan early date, and we have it on the authority of John Adams\r\nthat:--'argument might have had some weight in the abolition of slavery\r\nin Massachusetts, but the real cause was the multiplication of laboring\r\nwhite people, who would not longer suffer the rich to employ these sable\r\nrivals so much to their injury.'\" No one to-day doubts that white labor\r\nin the North and slavery in the South were not due to the moral\r\nsuperiority of the North. Yet just in the North we find the abolition\r\nsentiment strongest. That the Civil War was not a clash of good men and\r\nbad men is admitted by every reputable historian. The war did not come\r\nwhen moral fervor had risen to the exploding point; the moral fervor came\r\nrather when the economic interests of the South collided with those of\r\nthe North. That the abolitionists clarified the economic interests of the\r\nNorth and gave them an ideal sanction is true enough. But the fact\r\nremains that by 1860 some of the aspirations of Phillips and Garrison had\r\nbecome the economic destiny of this country.\r\n\r\nYou can have a Hull House established by private initiative and\r\nmaintained by individual genius, just as you had planters who freed their\r\nslaves or as you have employers to-day who humanize their factories. But\r\nthe fine example is not readily imitated when industrial forces fight\r\nagainst it. So even if the Commission had drawn splendid plans for\r\nhousing, work conditions, education, and play it would have done only\r\npart of the task of statesmanship. We should then know what to do, but\r\nnot how to get it done.\r\n\r\nAn ideal suspended in a vacuum is ineffective: it must point a dynamic\r\ncurrent. Only then does it gather power, only then does it enter into\r\nlife. That forces exist to-day which carry with them solutions is evident\r\nto anyone who has watched the labor movement and the woman's awakening.\r\nEven the interests of business give power to the cause. The discovery of\r\nmanufacturers that degradation spoils industrial efficiency must not be\r\ncast aside by the radical because the motive is larger profits. The\r\ndiscovery, whatever the motive, will inevitably humanize industry a good\r\ndeal. For it happens that in this case the interests of capitalism and of\r\nhumanity coincide. A propaganda like the single-tax will undoubtedly find\r\nincreasing support among business men. They see in it a relief from the\r\nburden of rent imposed by that older tyrant--the landlord. But the\r\ntaxation of unimproved property happens at the same time to be a splendid\r\nweapon against the slum.\r\n\r\nOnly when the abolition of \"white slavery\" becomes part of the social\r\ncurrents of the time will it bear any interesting analogy to the\r\nso-called freeing of the slaves. Even then for many enthusiasts the\r\ncomparison is misleading. They are likely to regard the Emancipation\r\nProclamation as the end of chattel slavery. It wasn't. That historic\r\ndocument broke a legal bond but not a social one. The process of negro\r\nemancipation is infinitely slower and it is not accomplished yet.\r\nLikewise no statute can end \"white slavery.\" Only vast and complicated\r\nchanges in the whole texture of social life will achieve such an end. If\r\nby some magic every taboo of the commission could be enforced the\r\nabolition of sex slavery would not have come one step nearer to reality.\r\nCities and factories, schools and homes, theaters and games, manners and\r\nthought will have to be transformed before sex can find a better\r\nexpression. Living forces, not statutes or clubs, must work that change.\r\nThe power of emancipation is in the social movements which alone can\r\neffect any deep reform in a nation. So it is and has been with the negro.\r\nI do not think the Abolitionists saw facts truly when they disbanded\r\ntheir organization a few years after the civil war. They found too much\r\ncomfort in a change of legal status. Profound economic forces brought\r\nabout the beginning of the end of chattel slavery. But the reality of\r\nfreedom was not achieved by proclamation. For that the revolution had to\r\ngo on: the industrial life of the nation had to change its character,\r\nsocial customs had to be replaced, the whole outlook of men had to be\r\ntransformed. And whether it is negro slavery or a vicious sexual bondage,\r\nthe actual advance comes from substitutions injected into society by\r\ndynamic social forces.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to press the analogy or over-emphasize the particular\r\nproblems. I am not engaged in drawing up the plans for a reconstruction\r\nor in telling just what should be done. Only the co-operation of expert\r\nminds can do that. The place for a special propaganda is elsewhere. If\r\nthese essays succeed in suggesting a method of looking at politics, if\r\nthey draw attention to what is real in social reforms and make somewhat\r\nmore evident the traps and the blind-alleys of an uncritical approach,\r\nthey will have done their work. That the report of the Chicago Vice\r\nCommission figures so prominently in this chapter is not due to any\r\npreoccupation with Chicago, the Commission or with vice. It is a text and\r\nnothing else. The report happens to embody what I conceive to be most of\r\nthe faults of a political method now decadent. Its failure to put human\r\nimpulses at the center of thought produced remedies valueless to human\r\nnature; its false interest in a particular expression of\r\nsex--vice--caused it to taboo the civilizing power of sex; its inability\r\nto see that wants require fine satisfactions and not prohibitions drove\r\nit into an undemocratic tyranny; its blindness to the social forces of\r\nour age shut off the motive power for any reform.\r\n\r\nThe Commission's method was poor, not its intentions. It was an average\r\nbody of American citizens aroused to action by an obvious evil. But\r\nsomething slipped in to falsify vision. It was, I believe, an array of\r\nidols disguised as ideals. They are typical American idols, and they\r\ndeserve some study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOME NECESSARY ICONOCLASM\r\n\r\n     The Commission \"has kept constantly in mind that to offer a\r\n     contribution of any value such an offering must be, first, moral;\r\n     second, reasonable and practical; third, possible under the\r\n     Constitutional powers of our Courts; fourth, that which will square\r\n     with the public conscience of the American people.\"--The Vice\r\n     Commission of Chicago--Introduction to Report on the Social Evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving adjusted such spectacles the Commission proceeded to look at \"this\r\ncurse which is more blasting than any plague or epidemic,\" at an evil\r\n\"which spells only ruin to the race.\" In dealing with what it regards as\r\nthe greatest calamity in the world, a calamity as old as civilization,\r\nthe Commission lays it down beforehand that the remedy must be \"moral,\"\r\nconstitutional, and satisfactory to the public conscience. I wonder in\r\nall seriousness what the Commission would have done had it discovered a\r\ngenuine cure for prostitution which happened, let us say, to conflict\r\nwith the constitutional powers of our courts. I wonder how the Commission\r\nwould have acted if a humble following of the facts had led them to a\r\nconviction out of tune with the existing public conscience of America.\r\nSuch a conflict is not only possible; it is highly probable. When you\r\ncome to think of it, the conflict appears a certainty. For the\r\nConstitution is a legal expression of the conditions under which\r\nprostitution has flourished; the social evil is rooted in institutions\r\nand manners which have promoted it, in property relations and business\r\npractice which have gathered about them a halo of reason and\r\npracticality, of morality and conscience. Any change so vast as the\r\nabolition of vice is of necessity a change in morals, practice, law and\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nA scientist who began an investigation by saying that his results must be\r\nmoral or constitutional would be a joke. We have had scientists like\r\nthat, men who insisted that research must confirm the Biblical theory of\r\ncreation. We have had economists who set out with the preconceived idea\r\nof justifying the factory system. The world has recently begun to see\r\nthrough this kind of intellectual fraud. If a doctor should appear who\r\noffered a cure for tuberculosis on the ground that it was justified by\r\nthe Bible and that it conformed to the opinions of that great mass of the\r\nAmerican people who believe that fresh air is the devil, we should\r\npromptly lock up that doctor as a dangerous quack. When the negroes of\r\nKansas were said to be taking pink pills to guard themselves against\r\nHalley's Comet, they were doing something which appeared to them as\r\neminently practical and entirely reasonable. Not long ago we read of the\r\nsavage way in which a leper was treated out West; his leprosy was not\r\nregarded as a disease, but as the curse of God, and, if I remember\r\ncorrectly, the Bible was quoted in court as an authority on leprosy. The\r\ntreatment seemed entirely moral and squared very well with the conscience\r\nof that community.\r\n\r\nI have heard reputable physicians condemn a certain method of\r\npsychotherapy because it was \"immoral.\" A woman once told me that she had\r\nlet her son grow up ignorant of his sexual life because \"a mother should\r\nnever mention anything 'embarrassing' to her child.\" Many of us are still\r\nblushing for the way America treated Gorki when it found that Russian\r\nmorals did not square with the public conscience of America. And the time\r\nis not yet passed when we punish the offspring of illicit love, and visit\r\nvengeance unto the third and fourth generations. One reads in the report\r\nof the Vice Commission that many public hospitals in Chicago refuse to\r\ncare for venereal diseases. The examples are endless. They run from the\r\nabsurd to the monstrous. But always the source is the same. Idols are set\r\nup to which all the living must bow; we decide beforehand that things\r\nmust fit a few preconceived ideas. And when they don't, which is most of\r\nthe time, we deny truth, falsify facts, and prefer the coddling of our\r\ntheory to any deeper understanding of the real problem before us.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if a theory were never so active as when the reality behind\r\nit has disappeared. The empty name, the ghostly phrase, exercise an\r\nauthority that is appalling. When you think of the blood that has been\r\nshed in the name of Jesus, when you think of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\n\"neither holy nor Roman nor imperial,\" of the constitutional phrases that\r\ncloak all sorts of thievery, of the common law precedents that tyrannize\r\nover us, history begins to look almost like the struggle of man to\r\nemancipate himself from phrase-worship. The devil can quote Scripture,\r\nand law, and morality and reason and practicality. The devil can use the\r\npublic conscience of his time. He does in wars, in racial and religious\r\npersecutions; he did in the Spain of the Inquisition; he does in the\r\nAmerican lynching.\r\n\r\nFor there is nothing so bad but it can masquerade as moral. Conquerors\r\nhave gone forth with the blessing of popes; a nation invokes its God\r\nbefore beginning a campaign of murder, rape and pillage. The ruthless\r\nexploitation of India becomes the civilizing fulfilment of the \"white\r\nman's burden\"; not infrequently the missionary, drummer, and prospector\r\nare embodied in one man. In the nineteenth century church, press and\r\nuniversity devoted no inconsiderable part of their time to proving the\r\nhigh moral and scientific justice of child labor and human sweating. It\r\nis a matter of record that chattel slavery in this country was deduced\r\nfrom Biblical injunction, that the universities furnished brains for its\r\ndefense. Surely Bernard Shaw was not describing the Englishman alone when\r\nhe said in \"The Man of Destiny\" that \"... you will never find an\r\nEnglishman in the wrong. He does everything on principle. He fights you\r\non patriotic principles; he robs you on business principles....\"\r\n\r\nLiberty, equality, fraternity--what a grotesque career those words have\r\nhad. Almost every attempt to mitigate the hardships of industrialism has\r\nhad to deal with the bogey of liberty. Labor organization, factory laws,\r\nhealth regulations are still fought as infringements of liberty. And in\r\nthe name of equality what fantasies of taxation have we not woven? what\r\ntravesties of justice set up? \"The law in its majestic equality,\" writes\r\nAnatole France, \"forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep in the\r\nstreets and to steal bread.\" Fraternity becomes the hypocritical slogan\r\nby which we refuse to enact what is called \"class legislation\"--a policy\r\nwhich in theory denies the existence of classes, in practice legislates\r\nin favor of the rich. The laws which go unchallenged are laws friendly to\r\nbusiness; class legislation means working-class legislation.\r\n\r\nYou have to go among lawyers to see this idolatrous process in its most\r\nperfect form. When a judge sets out to \"interpret\" the Constitution, what\r\nis it that he does? He takes a sentence written by a group of men more\r\nthan a hundred years ago. That sentence expressed their policy about\r\ncertain conditions which they had to deal with. In it was summed up what\r\nthey intended to do about the problems they saw. That is all the sentence\r\nmeans. But in the course of a century new problems arise--problems the\r\nFathers could no more have foreseen than we can foresee the problems of\r\nthe year two thousand. Yet that sentence which contained their wisdom\r\nabout particular events has acquired an emotional force which persists\r\nlong after the events have passed away. Legends gather about the men who\r\nwrote it: those legends are absorbed by us almost with our mothers' milk.\r\nWe never again read that sentence straight. It has a gravity out of all\r\nproportion to its use, and we call it a fundamental principle of\r\ngovernment. Whatever we want to do is hallowed and justified, if it can\r\nbe made to appear as a deduction from that sentence. To put new wine in\r\nold bottles is one of the aims of legal casuistry.\r\n\r\nReformers practice it. You hear it said that the initiative and\r\nreferendum are a return to the New England town meeting. That is supposed\r\nto be an argument for direct legislation. But surely the analogy is\r\nsuperficial; the difference profound. The infinitely greater complexity\r\nof legislation to-day, the vast confusion in the aims of the voting\r\npopulation, produce a difference of so great a degree that it amounts to\r\na difference in kind. The naturalist may classify the dog and the fox,\r\nthe house-cat and the tiger together for certain purposes. The historian\r\nof political forms may see in the town meeting a forerunner of direct\r\nlegislation. But no housewife dare classify the cat and the tiger, the\r\ndog and the fox, as the same kind of animal. And no statesman can argue\r\nthe virtues of the referendum from the successes of the town meeting.\r\n\r\nBut the propagandists do it nevertheless, and their propaganda thrives\r\nupon it. The reason is simple. The town meeting is an obviously\r\nrespectable institution, glorified by all the reverence men give to the\r\ndead. It has acquired the seal of an admired past, and any proposal that\r\ncan borrow that seal can borrow that reverence too. A name trails behind\r\nit an army of associations. That army will fight in any cause that bears\r\nthe name. So the reformers of California, the Lorimerites of Chicago, and\r\nthe Barnes Republicans of Albany all use the name of Lincoln for their\r\npolitical associations. In the struggle that preceded the Republican\r\nConvention of 1912 it was rumored that the Taft reactionaries would put\r\nforward Lincoln's son as chairman of the convention in order to\r\ncounteract Roosevelt's claim that he stood in Lincoln's shoes.\r\n\r\nCasuistry is nothing but the injection of your own meaning into an old\r\nname. At school when the teacher asked us whether we had studied the\r\nlesson, the invariable answer was Yes. We had indeed stared at the page\r\nfor a few minutes, and that could be called studying. Sometimes the\r\nhead-master would break into the room just in time to see the conclusion\r\nof a scuffle. Jimmy's clothes are white with dust. \"Johnny, did you throw\r\nchalk at Jimmy?\" \"No, sir,\" says Johnny, and then under his breath to\r\nplacate God's penchant for truth, \"I threw the chalk-eraser.\" Once in\r\nPortland, Maine, I ordered iced tea at an hotel. The waitress brought me\r\na glass of yellowish liquid with a two-inch collar of foam at the top. No\r\ntea I had ever seen outside of a prohibition state looked like that.\r\nThough it was tea, it might have been beer. Perhaps if I had smiled or\r\nwinked in ordering the tea, it would have been beer. The two looked alike\r\nin Portland; they were interchangeable. You could drink tea and fool\r\nyourself into thinking it was beer. You could drink beer and pass for a\r\ntea-toper.\r\n\r\nIt is rare, I think, that the fraud is so genial and so deliberate. The\r\nopenness cleanses it. Advertising, for example, would be nothing but\r\ngigantic and systematic lying if almost everybody didn't know that it\r\nwas. Yet it runs into the sinister all the time. The pure food agitation\r\nis largely an effort to make the label and the contents tell the same\r\nstory. It was noteworthy that, following the discovery of salvarsan or\r\n\"606\" by Dr. Ehrlich, the quack doctors began to call their treatments\r\n\"606.\" But the deliberate casuistry of lawyers, quacks, or politicians is\r\nnot so difficult to deal with. The very deliberation makes it easier to\r\ndetect, for it is generally awkward. What one man can consciously devise,\r\nother men can understand.\r\n\r\nBut unconscious casuistry deceives us all. No one escapes it entirely. A\r\nwealth of evidence could be adduced to support this from the studies of\r\ndreams and fantasies made by the Freudian school of psychologists. They\r\nhave shown how constantly the mind cloaks a deep meaning in a shallow\r\nincident--how the superficial is all the time being shoved into the light\r\nof consciousness in order to conceal a buried intention; how inveterate\r\nis our use of symbols.\r\n\r\nBetween ourselves and our real natures we interpose that wax figure of\r\nidealizations and selections which we call our character. We extend this\r\ninto all our thinking. Between us and the realities of social life we\r\nbuild up a mass of generalizations, abstract ideas, ancient glories, and\r\npersonal wishes. They simplify and soften experience. It is so much\r\neasier to talk of poverty than to think of the poor, to argue the rights\r\nof capital than to see its results. Pretty soon we come to think of the\r\ntheories and abstract ideas as things in themselves. We worry about their\r\nfate and forget their original content.\r\n\r\nFor words, theories, symbols, slogans, abstractions of all kinds are\r\nnothing but the porous vessels into which life flows, is contained for a\r\ntime, and then passes through. But our reverence clings to the vessels.\r\nThe old meaning may have disappeared, a new one come in--no matter, we\r\ntry to believe there has been no change. And when life's expansion\r\ndemands some new container, nothing is more difficult than the\r\nrealization that the old vessels cannot be stretched to the present need.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice how in the very act of analyzing it I have\r\nfallen into this curious and ancient habit. My point is that the metaphor\r\nis taken for the reality: I have used at least six metaphors to state it.\r\nAbstractions are not cloaks, nor wax figures, nor walls, nor vessels, and\r\nlife doesn't flow like water. What they really are you and I know\r\ninwardly by using abstractions and living our lives. But once I attempt\r\nto give that inwardness expression, I must use the only weapons I\r\nhave--abstractions, theories, phrases. By an effort of the sympathetic\r\nimagination you can revive within yourself something of my inward sense.\r\nAs I have had to abstract from life in order to communicate, so you are\r\ncompelled to animate my abstractions, in order to understand.\r\n\r\nI know of no other method of communication between two people. Language\r\nis always grossly inadequate. It is inadequate if the listener is merely\r\npassive, if he falls into the mistake of the literal-minded who expect\r\nwords to contain a precise image of reality. They never do. All language\r\ncan achieve is to act as a guidepost to the imagination enabling the\r\nreader to recreate the author's insight. The artist does that: he\r\ncontrols his medium so that we come most readily to the heart of his\r\nintention. In the lyric poet the control is often so delicate that the\r\nhearer lives over again the finely shaded mood of the poet. Take the\r\nwords of a lyric for what they say, and they say nothing most of the\r\ntime. And that is true of philosophers. You must penetrate the ponderous\r\nvocabulary, the professional cant to the insight beneath or you scoff at\r\nthe mountain ranges of words and phrases. It is this that Bergson means\r\nwhen he tells us that a philosopher's intuition always outlasts his\r\nsystem. Unless you get at that you remain forever foreign to the thinker.\r\n\r\nThat too is why debating is such a wretched amusement and most\r\npartisanship, most controversy, so degrading. The trick here is to argue\r\nfrom the opponent's language, never from his insight. You take him\r\nliterally, you pick up his sentences, and you show what nonsense they\r\nare. You do not try to weigh what you see against what he sees; you\r\ncontrast what you see with what he says. So debating becomes a way of\r\nconfirming your own prejudices; it is never, never in any debate I have\r\nsuffered through, a search for understanding from the angles of two\r\ndiffering insights.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, in those more sinister forms of debating, court trials,\r\nwhere the stakes are so much bigger, the skill of a successful lawyer is\r\nto make the atmosphere as opaque as possible to the other lawyer's\r\ncontention. Men have been hanged as a result. How often in a political\r\ncampaign does a candidate suggest that behind the platforms and speeches\r\nof his opponents there might be some new and valuable understanding of\r\nthe country's need?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that we argue and quarrel an enormous lot over words. Our\r\nprevailing habit is to think about phrases, \"ideals,\" theories, not about\r\nthe realities they express. In controversy we do not try to find our\r\nopponent's meaning: we examine his vocabulary. And in our own efforts to\r\nshape policies we do not seek out what is worth doing: we seek out what\r\nwill pass for moral, practical, popular or constitutional.\r\n\r\nIn this the Vice Commission reflected our national habits. For those\r\nearnest men and women in Chicago did not set out to find a way of\r\nabolishing prostitution; they set out to find a way that would conform to\r\nfour idols they worshiped. The only cure for prostitution might prove to\r\nbe \"immoral,\" \"impractical,\" unconstitutional, and unpopular. I suspect\r\nthat it is. But the honest thing to do would have been to look for that\r\ncure without preconceived notions. Having found it, the Commission could\r\nthen have said to the public: \"This is what will cure the social evil. It\r\nmeans these changes in industry, sex relations, law and public opinion.\r\nIf you think it is worth the cost you can begin to deal with the problem.\r\nIf you don't, then confess that you will not abolish prostitution, and\r\nturn your compassion to softening its effects.\"\r\n\r\nThat would have left the issues clear and wholesome. But the procedure of\r\nthe Commission is a blow to honest thinking. Its conclusions may \"square\r\nwith the public conscience of the American people\" but they will not\r\nsquare with the intellectual conscience of anybody. To tell you at the\r\ntop of the page that absolute annihilation of prostitution is the\r\nultimate ideal and twenty lines further on that the method must be\r\nconstitutional is nothing less than an insult to the intelligence.\r\nCalf-worship was never more idolatrous than this. Truth would have slept\r\nmore comfortably in Procrustes' bed.\r\n\r\nLet no one imagine that I take the four preconceived ideas of the\r\nCommission too seriously. On the first reading of the report they aroused\r\nno more interest in me than the ordinary lip-honor we all do to\r\nconventionality--I had heard of the great fearlessness of this report,\r\nand I supposed that this bending of the knee was nothing but the innocent\r\nhypocrisy of the reformer who wants to make his proposal not too\r\nshocking. But it was a mistake. Those four idols really dominated the\r\nminds of the Commission, and without them the report cannot be\r\nunderstood. They are typical idols of the American people. This report\r\noffers an opportunity to see the concrete results of worshiping them.\r\n\r\nA valuable contribution, then, must be _moral_. There is no doubt that\r\nthe Commission means sexually moral. We Americans always use the word in\r\nthat limited sense. If you say that Jones is a moral man you mean that he\r\nis faithful to his wife. He may support her by selling pink pills; he is\r\nnevertheless moral if he is monogamous. The average American rarely\r\nspeaks of industrial piracy as immoral. He may condemn it, but not with\r\nthat word. If he extends the meaning of immoral at all, it is to the\r\nvices most closely allied to sex--drink and gambling.\r\n\r\nNow sexual morality is pretty clearly defined for the Commission. As we\r\nhave seen, it means that sex must be confined to procreation by a\r\nhealthy, intelligent and strictly monogamous couple. All other sexual\r\nexpression would come under the ban of disapproval. I am sure I do the\r\nCommission no injustice. Now this limited conception of sex has had a\r\ndisastrous effect: it has forced the Commission to ignore the sexual\r\nimpulse in discussing a sexual problem. Any modification of the\r\nrelationship of men and women was immediately put out of consideration.\r\nSuch suggestions as Forel, Ellen Key, or Havelock Ellis make could, of\r\ncourse, not even get a hearing.\r\n\r\nWith this moral ideal in mind, not only vice, but sex itself, becomes an\r\nevil thing. Hence the hysterical and minute application of the taboo\r\nwherever sex shows itself. Barred from any reform which would reabsorb\r\nthe impulse into civilized life, the Commissioners had no other course\r\nbut to hunt it, as an outlaw. And in doing this they were compelled to\r\ndiscard the precious values of art, religion and social life of which\r\nthis superfluous energy is the creator. Driven to think of it as bad,\r\nexcept for certain particular functions, they could, of course, not see\r\nits possibilities. Hence the poverty of their suggestions along\r\neducational and artistic lines.\r\n\r\nA valuable contribution, we are told, must be _reasonable_ and\r\n_practical_. Here is a case where words cannot be taken literally.\r\n\"Reasonable\" in America certainly never even pretended to mean in\r\naccordance with a rational ideal, and \"practical,\"--well one thinks of\r\n\"practical politics,\" \"practical business men,\" and \"unpractical\r\nreformers.\" Boiled down these words amount to something like this: the\r\nproposals must not be new or startling; must not involve any radical\r\ndisturbance of any respectable person's selfishness; must not call forth\r\nany great opposition; must look definite and immediate; must be tangible\r\nlike a raid, or a jail, or the paper of an ordinance, or a policeman's\r\nclub. Above all a \"reasonable and practical\" proposal must not require\r\nany imaginative patience. The actual proposals have all these qualities:\r\nif they are \"reasonable and practical\" then we know by a good\r\ndemonstration what these terms meant to that average body of citizens.\r\n\r\nTo see that is to see exposed an important facet of the American\r\ntemperament. Our dislike of \"talk\"; the frantic desire to \"do something\"\r\nwithout inquiring whether it is worth doing; the dollar standard; the\r\nunwillingness to cast any bread upon the waters; our preference for a\r\nsparrow in the hand to a forest of song-birds; the naïve inability to\r\nunderstand the inner satisfactions of bankrupt poets and the\r\nunworldliness of eccentric thinkers; success-mania; philistinism--they\r\nare pieces of the same cloth. They come from failure or unwillingness to\r\nproject the mind beyond the daily routine of things, to play over the\r\nwhole horizon of possibilities, and to recognize that all is not said\r\nwhen we have spoken. In those words \"reasonable and practical\" is the\r\nChinese Wall of America, that narrow boundary which contracts our vision\r\nto the moment, cuts us off from the culture of the world, and makes us\r\nsuch provincial, unimaginative blunderers over our own problems. Fixation\r\nupon the immediate has made a rich country poor in leisure, has in a land\r\nmeant for liberal living incited an insane struggle for existence. One\r\nsuspects at times that our national cult of optimism is no real feeling\r\nthat the world is good, but a fear that pessimism will produce panics.\r\n\r\nHow this fascination of the obvious has balked the work of the Commission\r\nI need not elaborate. That the long process of civilizing sex received\r\nperfunctory attention; that the imaginative value of sex was lost in a\r\ndogma; that the implied changes in social life were dodged--all that has\r\nbeen pointed out. It was the inability to rise above the immediate that\r\nmakes the report read as if the policeman were the only agent of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nFor where in the report is any thorough discussion by sociologists of the\r\nrelations of business and marriage to vice? Why is there no testimony by\r\npsychologists to show how sex can be affected by environment, by\r\neducators to show how it can be trained, by industrial experts to show\r\nhow monotony and fatigue affect it? Where are the detailed proposals by\r\nspecialists, for decent housing and working conditions, for educational\r\nreform, for play facilities? The Commission wasn't afraid of details:\r\ndidn't it recommend searchlights in the parks as a weapon against vice?\r\nWhy then isn't there a budget, a large, comprehensive budget, precise and\r\ninforming, in which provision is made for beginning to civilize Chicago?\r\nThat wouldn't have been \"reasonable and practical,\" I presume, for it\r\nwould have cost millions and millions of dollars. And where would the\r\nmoney have come from? Were the single-taxers, the Socialists consulted?\r\nBut their proposals would require big changes in property interests, and\r\nwould that be \"reasonable and practical\"? Evidently not: it is more\r\nreasonable and practical to keep park benches out of the shadows and to\r\nplague unescorted prostitutes.\r\n\r\nAnd where are the open questions: the issues that everybody should\r\nconsider, the problems that scientists should study? I see almost no\r\ntrace of them. Why are the sexual problems not even stated? Where are the\r\ndoubts that should have honored these investigations, the frank statement\r\nof all the gaps in knowledge, and the obscurities in morals? Knowing\r\nperfectly well that vice will not be repressed within a year or\r\nprostitution absolutely annihilated in ten, it might, I should think,\r\nhave seemed more important that the issues be made clear and the thought\r\nof the people fertilized than that the report should look very definite\r\nand precise. There are all sorts of things we do not understand about\r\nthis problem. The opportunities for study which the Commissioners had\r\nmust have made these empty spaces evident. Why then were we not taken\r\ninto their confidence? Along what lines is investigation most needed? To\r\nwhat problems, what issues, shall we give our attention? What is the\r\ndebatable ground in this territory? The Commission does not say, and I\r\nfor one, ascribe the silence to the American preoccupation with\r\nimmediate, definite, tangible interests.\r\n\r\nWells has written penetratingly about this in \"The New Machiavelli.\" I\r\nhave called this fixation on the nearest object at hand an American\r\nhabit. Perhaps as Mr. Wells shows it is an English one too. But in this\r\ncountry we have a philosophy to express it--the philosophy of the\r\nReasonable and the Practical, and so I do not hesitate to import Mr.\r\nWells's observations: \"It has been the chronic mistake of statecraft and\r\nall organizing spirits to attempt immediately to scheme and arrange and\r\nachieve. Priests, schools of thought, political schemers, leaders of men,\r\nhave always slipped into the error of assuming that they can think out\r\nthe whole--or at any rate completely think out definite parts--of the\r\npurpose and future of man, clearly and finally; they have set themselves\r\nto legislate and construct on that assumption, and, experiencing the\r\nperplexing obduracy and evasions of reality, they have taken to dogma,\r\npersecution, training, pruning, secretive education; and all the\r\nstupidities of self-sufficient energy. In the passion of their good\r\nintentions they have not hesitated to conceal facts, suppress thought,\r\ncrush disturbing initiatives and apparently detrimental desires. And so\r\nit is blunderingly and wastefully, destroying with the making, that any\r\nextension of social organization is at present achieved. Directly,\r\nhowever, this idea of an emancipation from immediacy is grasped, directly\r\nthe dominating importance of this critical, less personal, mental\r\nhinterland in the individual and of the collective mind in the race is\r\nunderstood, the whole problem of the statesman and his attitude toward\r\npolitics gains a new significance, and becomes accessible to a new series\r\nof solutions....\"\r\n\r\nLet no one suppose that the unwillingness to cultivate what Mr. Wells\r\ncalls the \"mental hinterland\" is a vice peculiar to the business man. The\r\ncolleges submit to it whenever they concentrate their attention on the\r\ndetails of the student's vocation before they have built up some cultural\r\nbackground. The whole drift towards industrial training in schools has\r\nthe germs of disaster within it--a preoccupation with the technique of a\r\ncareer. I am not a lover of the \"cultural\" activities of our schools and\r\ncolleges, still less am I a lover of shallow specialists. The\r\nunquestioned need for experts in politics is full of the very real danger\r\nthat detailed preparation may give us a bureaucracy--a government by men\r\ndivorced from human tradition. The churches submit to the demand for\r\nimmediacy with great alacrity. Look at the so-called \"liberal\" churches.\r\nReacting against an empty formalism they are tumbling over themselves to\r\nprove how directly they touch daily life. You read glowing articles in\r\nmagazines about preachers who devote their time to housing reforms, milk\r\nsupplies, the purging of the civil service. If you lament the ugliness of\r\ntheir churches, the poverty of the ritual, and the political absorption\r\nof their sermons, you are told that the church must abandon forms and\r\nserve the common life of men. There are many ways of serving everyday\r\nneeds,--turning churches into social reform organs and political rostra\r\nis, it seems to me, an obvious but shallow way of performing that\r\nservice. When churches cease to paint the background of our lives, to\r\nnourish a Weltanschaung, strengthen men's ultimate purposes and reaffirm\r\nthe deepest values of life, then churches have ceased to meet the needs\r\nfor which they exist. That \"hinterland\" affects daily life, and the\r\nchurch which cannot get a leverage on it by any other method than\r\nentering into immediate political controversy is simply a church that is\r\ndead. It may be an admirable agent of reform, but it has ceased to be a\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nA large wing of the Socialist Party is the slave of obvious success. It\r\nboasts that it has ceased to be \"visionary\" and has become \"practical.\"\r\nVotes, winning campaigns, putting through reform measures seem a great\r\nachievement. It forgets the difference between voting the Socialist\r\nticket and understanding Socialism. The vote is the tangible thing, and\r\nfor that these Socialist politicians work. They get the votes, enough to\r\nelect them to office. In the City of Schenectady that happened as a\r\nresult of the mayoralty campaign of 1911. I had an opportunity to observe\r\nthe results. A few Socialists were in office set to govern a city with no\r\nSocialist \"hinterland.\" It was a pathetic situation, for any reform\r\nproposal had to pass the judgment of men and women who did not see life\r\nas the officials did. On no important measure could the administration\r\nexpect popular understanding. What was the result? In crucial issues,\r\nlike taxation, the Socialists had to submit to the ideas,--the general\r\nstate of mind of the community. They had to reverse their own theories\r\nand accept those that prevailed in that unconverted city. I wondered over\r\nour helplessness, for I was during a period one of those officials. The\r\nother members of the administration used to say at every opportunity that\r\nwe were fighting \"The Beast\" or \"Special Privilege.\" But to me it always\r\nseemed that we were like Peer Gynt struggling against the formless\r\nBoyg--invisible yet everywhere--we were struggling with the unwatered\r\nhinterland of the citizens of Schenectady. I understood then, I think,\r\nwhat Wells meant when he said that he wanted \"no longer to 'fix up,' as\r\npeople say, human affairs, but to devote his forces to the development of\r\nthat needed intellectual life without which all his shallow attempts at\r\nfixing up are futile.\" For in the last analysis the practical and the\r\nreasonable are little idols of clay that thwart our efforts.\r\n\r\nThe third requirement of a valuable contribution, says the Chicago\r\nCommission, is the constitutional sanction. This idol carries its own\r\ncriticism with it. The worship of the constitution amounts, of course, to\r\nsaying that men exist for the sake of the constitution. The person who\r\nholds fast to that idea is forever incapable of understanding either men\r\nor constitutions. It is a prime way of making laws ridiculous; if you\r\nwant to cultivate _lèse-majesté_ in Germany get the Kaiser to proclaim\r\nhis divine origin; if you want to promote disrespect of the courts,\r\nannounce their infallibility.\r\n\r\nBut in this case, the Commission is not representative of the dominant\r\nthought of our times. The vital part of the population has pretty well\r\nemerged from any dumb acquiescence in constitutions. Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nwho reflects so much of America, has very definitely cast down this idol.\r\nNow since he stands generally some twenty years behind the pioneer and\r\nabout six months ahead of the majority, we may rest assured that this\r\nmuch-needed iconoclasm is in process of achievement.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the constitution and just as decadent to-day are the\r\nSanctity of Private Property, Vested Rights, Competition the Life of\r\nTrade, Prosperity (at any cost). Each one of these ideas was born of an\r\noriginal need, served its historical function and survived beyond its\r\nallotted time. Nowadays you still come across some of these ancient\r\nnotions, especially in courts, where they do no little damage in\r\nperverting justice, but they are ghost-like and disreputable, gibbering\r\nand largely helpless. He who is watching the ascendant ideas of American\r\nlife can afford to feel that the early maxims of capitalism are doomed.\r\n\r\nBut the habit of mind which would turn an instrument of life into an\r\nimmutable law of its existence--that habit is always with us. We may\r\noutgrow our adoration of the Constitution or Private Property only to\r\nestablish some new totem pole. In the arts we call this inveterate\r\ntendency classicalism. It is, of course, a habit by no means confined to\r\nthe arts. Politics, religion, science are subject to it,--in politics we\r\ncall it conservative, in religion orthodox, in science we describe it as\r\nacademic. Its manifestations are multiform but they have a common source.\r\nAn original creative impulse of the mind expresses itself in a certain\r\nformula; posterity mistakes the formula for the impulse. A genius will\r\nuse his medium in a particular way because it serves his need; this way\r\nbecomes a fixed rule which the classicalist serves. It has been pointed\r\nout that because the first steam trains were run on roads built for carts\r\nand coaches, the railway gauge almost everywhere in the world became\r\nfixed at four feet eight and one-half inches.\r\n\r\nYou might say that genius works inductively and finds a method; the\r\nconservative works deductively from the method and defeats whatever\r\ngenius he may have. A friend of mine had written a very brilliant article\r\non a play which had puzzled New York. Some time later I was discussing\r\nthe article with another friend of a decidedly classicalist bent. \"What\r\nis it?\" he protested, \"it isn't criticism for it's half rhapsody; it\r\nisn't rhapsody because it is analytical.... What is it? That's what I\r\nwant to know.\" \"But isn't it fine, and worth having, and aren't you glad\r\nit was written?\" I pleaded. \"Well, if I knew what it was....\" And so the\r\nargument ran for hours. Until he had subsumed the article under certain\r\ncategories he had come to accept, appreciation was impossible for him. I\r\nhave many arguments with my classicalist friend. This time it was about\r\nGeorge Moore's \"Ave.\" I was trying to express my delight. \"It isn't a\r\nnovel, or an essay, or a real confession--it's nothing,\" said he. His\r\nwell-ordered mind was compelled to throw out of doors any work for which\r\nhe had no carefully prepared pocket. I thought of Aristotle, who denied\r\nthe existence of a mule because it was neither a horse nor an ass.\r\n\r\nDramatic critics follow Aristotle in more ways than one. A play is\r\nproduced which fascinates an audience for weeks. It is published and read\r\nall over the world. Then you are treated to endless discussions by the\r\ncritics trying to prove that \"it is not a play.\" So-and-so-and-so\r\nconstitute a play, they affirm,--this thing doesn't meet the\r\nrequirements, so away with it. They forget that nobody would have had the\r\nslightest idea what a play was if plays hadn't been written; that the\r\nrules deduced from the plays that have already been written are no\r\neternal law for the plays that will be.\r\n\r\nClassicalism and invention are irreconcilable enemies. Let it be\r\nunderstood that I am not decrying the great nourishment which a living\r\ntradition offers. The criticism I am making is of those who try to feed\r\nupon the husks alone. Without the slightest paradox one may say that the\r\nclassicalist is most foreign to the classics. He does not put himself\r\nwithin the creative impulses of the past: he is blinded by their\r\nmanifestations. It is perhaps no accident that two of the greatest\r\nclassical scholars in England--Gilbert Murray and Alfred Zimmern--are\r\npolitical radicals. The man whom I call here the classicalist cannot\r\npossibly be creative, for the essence of his creed is that there must be\r\nnothing new under the sun.\r\n\r\nThe United States, you imagine, would of all nations be the freest from\r\nclassicalism. Settled as a great adventure and dedicated to an experiment\r\nin republicanism, the tradition of the country is of extending\r\nboundaries, obstacles overcome, and pioneering exploits in which a\r\nwilderness was subdued to human uses. The very air of America would seem\r\nto be a guarantee against formalism. You would think that self-government\r\nfinds its surest footing here--that real autonomy of the spirit which\r\nmakes human uses the goal of effort, denies all inhuman ideals, seeks out\r\nwhat men want, and proceeds to create it. With such a history how could a\r\nnation fail to see in its constitution anything but a tool of life, like\r\nthe axe, the spade or the plough?\r\n\r\nThe West has in a measure carried its freedom over into politics and\r\nsocial life generally. Formalism sets in as you move east and south into\r\nthe older and more settled communities. There the pioneering impulse has\r\npassed out of life into stupid history books, and the inevitable\r\nclassicalism, the fear of adventure, the superstition before social\r\ninvention, have reasserted themselves. If I may turn for a moment from\r\ndescription to prophecy, it is to say that this equilibrium will not hold\r\nfor very long. There are signs that the West after achieving the reforms\r\nwhich it needs to-day--reforms which will free its economic life from the\r\ncredit monopolies of the East, and give it a greater fluidity in the\r\nmarketing of its products--will follow the way of all agricultural\r\ncommunities to a rural and placid conservatism. The spirit of the pioneer\r\ndoes not survive forever: it is kept alive to-day, I believe, by certain\r\nunnatural irritants which may be summed up as absentee ownership. The\r\nWest is suffering from foreignly owned railroads, power-resources, and an\r\nalien credit control. But once it recaptures these essentials of its\r\neconomic life, once the \"progressive\" movement is victorious, I venture\r\nto predict that the agricultural West will become the heart of American\r\ncomplacency. The East, on the other hand, with its industrial problem\r\nmust go to far more revolutionary measures for a solution. And the East\r\nis fertilized continually by European traditions: that stream of\r\nimmigration brings with it a thousand unforeseeable possibilities. The\r\ngreat social adventure of America is no longer the conquest of the\r\nwilderness but the absorption of fifty different peoples. To-day perhaps,\r\nit is still predominantly a question for the East. But it means that\r\nAmerica is turning from the contrast between her courage and nature's\r\nobstacles to a comparison of her civilization with Europe's. Immigration\r\nmore than anything else is drawing us into world problems. Many people\r\nprofess to see horrible dangers in the foreign invasion. Certainly no man\r\nis sure of its conclusion. It may swamp us, it may, if we seize the\r\nopportunity, mean the impregnation of our national life with a new\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\nI have said that the West is still moved by the tapering impulse of the\r\npioneer, and I have ventured to predict that this would soon dwindle into\r\nan agricultural toryism. That prediction may very easily be upset.\r\nFar-reaching mechanical inventions already threaten to transform farming\r\ninto an industry. I refer to those applications of power to agriculture\r\nwhich will inevitably divorce the farmer from the ownership of his tools.\r\nAn industrial revolution analogous to that in manufacture during the\r\nnineteenth century is distinctly probable, and capitalistic agriculture\r\nmay soon cease to be a contradiction in terms. Like all inventions it\r\nwill disturb deeply the classicalist tendency, and this disturbance may\r\ngenerate a new impulse to replace the decadent one of the pioneer.\r\n\r\nWithout some new dynamic force America, for all her tradition, is not\r\nimmune to a hardening formalism. The psychological descent into\r\nclassicalism is always a strong possibility. That is why we, the children\r\nof frontiersmen, city builders and immigrants, surprise Europe constantly\r\nwith our worship of constitutions, our social and political timidity. In\r\nmany ways we are more defenceless against these deadening habits than the\r\npeople of Europe. Our geographical isolation preserves us from any vivid\r\nsense of national contrast: our imaginations are not stirred by different\r\ncivilizations. We have almost no spiritual weapons against classicalism:\r\nuniversities, churches, newspapers are by-products of a commercial\r\nsuccess; we have no tradition of intellectual revolt. The American\r\ncollege student has the gravity and mental habits of a Supreme Court\r\njudge; his \"wild oats\" are rarely spiritual; the critical, analytical\r\nhabit of mind is distrusted. We say that \"knocking\" is a sign of the\r\n\"sorehead\" and we sublimate criticism by saying that \"every knock is a\r\nboost.\" America does not play with ideas; generous speculation is\r\nregarded as insincere, and shunned as if it might endanger the optimism\r\nwhich underlies success. All this becomes such an insulation against new\r\nideas that when the Yankee goes abroad he takes his environment with him.\r\n\r\nIt seems at times as if our capacity for appreciating originality were\r\nabsorbed in the trivial eccentricities of fads and fashions. The obvious\r\nnovelties of machinery and locomotion, phonographs and yellow journalism\r\nslake the American thirst for creation pretty thoroughly. In serious\r\nmatters we follow the Vice Commission's fourth essential of a valuable\r\ncontribution--_that which will square with the public conscience of the\r\nAmerican people_.\r\n\r\nI do not care to dilate upon the exploded pretensions of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGrundy. They are a fairly disreputable couple by this time because we are\r\nbeginning to know how much morbidity they represent. The Vice Commission,\r\nfor example, bowed to what might be called the \"instinctive conscience\"\r\nof America when it balked at tracing vice to its source in the\r\nover-respected institutions of American life and the over-respected\r\nnatures of American men and women. It bowed to the prevailing conscience\r\nwhen it proposed taboos instead of radical changes. It bowed to a\r\ntraditional conscience when it confused the sins of sex with the\r\npossibilities of sex; and it paid tribute to a verbal conscience, to a\r\nlip morality, when, with extreme irrelevance to its beloved police, it\r\nproclaimed \"absolute annihilation\" the ultimate ideal. In brief, the\r\ncommission failed to see that the working conscience of America is to-day\r\nbound up with the very evil it is supposed to eradicate by a relentless\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected. Our conscience is not the vessel of eternal\r\nverities. It grows with our social life, and a new social condition means\r\na radical change in conscience. In order to do away with vice America\r\nmust live and think and feel differently. This is an old story. Because\r\nof it all innovators have been at war with the public conscience of their\r\ntime. Yet there is nothing strange or particularly disheartening about\r\nthis commonplace observation: to expect anything else is to hope that a\r\nnation will lift itself by its own bootstraps. Yet there is danger the\r\nmoment leaders of the people make a virtue of homage to the unregenerate,\r\npublic conscience.\r\n\r\nIn La Follette's Magazine (Feb. 17, 1912) there is a leading article\r\ncalled \"The Great Issue.\" You can read there that \"the composite judgment\r\nis always safer and wiser and stronger and more unselfish than the\r\njudgment of any one individual mind. The people have been betrayed by\r\ntheir representatives again and again. The real danger to democracy lies\r\nnot in the ignorance or want of patriotism of the people, but in the\r\ncorrupting influence of powerful business organizations upon the\r\nrepresentatives of the people....\"\r\n\r\nI have only one quarrel with that philosophy--its negativity. With the\r\nbelief that government is futile and mischievous unless supported by the\r\nmass of the people; with the undeniable fact that business has corrupted\r\npublic officials--I have no complaint. What I object to is the emphasis\r\nwhich shifts the blame for our troubles from the shoulders of the people\r\nto those of the \"corrupting interests.\" For this seems to me nothing but\r\nthe resuscitation of the devil: when things go wrong it is somebody\r\nelse's fault. We are peculiarly open to this kind of vanity in America.\r\nIf some wise law is passed we say it is the will of the people showing\r\nits power of self-government. But if that will is so weak and timid that\r\na great evil like child labor persists to our shame we turn the\r\nresponsibility over to the devil personified as a \"special interest.\" It\r\nis an old habit of the race which seems to have begun with the serpent in\r\nthe Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nThe word demagogue has been frightfully maltreated in late years, but\r\nsurely here is its real meaning--to flatter the people by telling them\r\nthat their failures are somebody else's fault. For if a nation declares\r\nit has reached its majority by instituting self-government, then it\r\ncannot shirk responsibility.\r\n\r\nThese \"special interests\"--big business, a corrupt press, crooked\r\npolitics--grew up within the country, were promoted by American citizens,\r\nadmired by millions of them, and acquiesced in by almost all of them.\r\nWhoever thinks that business corruption is the work of a few inhumanly\r\ncunning individuals with monstrous morals is self-righteous without\r\nexcuse. Capitalists did not violate the public conscience of America;\r\nthey expressed it. That conscience was inadequate and unintelligent. We\r\nare being pinched by the acts it nourished. A great outcry has arisen and\r\na number of perfectly conventional men like Lorimer suffer an undeserved\r\nhumiliation. We say it is a \"moral awakening.\" That is another dodge by\r\nwhich we pretend that we were always wise and just, though a trifle\r\nsleepy. In reality we are witnessing a change of conscience, initiated by\r\ncranks and fanatics, sustained for a long time by minorities, which has\r\nat last infected the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nThe danger I spoke of arises just here: the desire to infect at once the\r\nwhole mass crowds out the courage of the innovator. No man can do his\r\nbest work if he bows at every step to the public conscience of his age.\r\nThe real service to democracy is the fullest, freest expression of\r\ntalent. The best servants of the people, like the best valets, must\r\nwhisper unpleasant truths in the master's ear. It is the court fool, not\r\nthe foolish courtier, whom the king can least afford to lose.\r\n\r\nHostile critics of democracy have long pointed out that mediocrity\r\nbecomes the rule. They have not been without facts for their support. And\r\nI do not see why we who believe in democracy should not recognize this\r\ndanger and trace it to its source. Certainly it is not answered with a\r\nsneer. I have worked in the editorial office of a popular magazine, a\r\nmagazine that is known widely as a champion of popular rights. By\r\npersonal experience, by intimate conversations, and by looking about, I\r\nthink I am pretty well aware of what the influence of business upon\r\njournalism amounts to. I have seen the inside working of business\r\npressure; articles of my own have been suppressed after they were in\r\ntype; friends of mine have told me stories of expurgation, of the\r\n\"morganization\" of their editorial policy. And in the face of that I\r\nshould like to record it as my sincere conviction that no financial power\r\nis one-tenth so corrupting, so insidious, so hostile to originality and\r\nfrank statement as the fear of the public which reads the magazine. For\r\none item suppressed out of respect for a railroad or a bank, nine are\r\nrejected because of the prejudices of the public. This will anger the\r\nfarmers, that will arouse the Catholics, another will shock the summer\r\ngirl. Anybody can take a fling at poor old Mr. Rockefeller, but the great\r\nmass of average citizens (to which none of us belongs) must be left in\r\nundisturbed possession of its prejudices. In that subservience, and not\r\nin the meddling of Mr. Morgan, is the reason why American journalism is\r\nso flaccid, so repetitious and so dull.\r\n\r\nThe people should be supreme, yes, its will should be the law of the\r\nland. But it is a caricature of democracy to make it also the law of\r\nindividual initiative. One thing it is to say that all proposals must\r\nultimately win the acceptance of the majority; it is quite another to\r\npropose nothing which is not immediately acceptable. It is as true of the\r\nnation as of the body that one leg cannot go forward very far unless the\r\nwhole body follows. That is a different thing from trying to move both\r\nlegs forward at the same time. The one is democracy; the other\r\nis--demolatry.\r\n\r\nIt is better to catch the idol-maker than to smash each idol. It would be\r\nan endless task to hunt down all the masks, the will-o'-the-wisps and the\r\nshadows which divert us from our real purpose. Each man carries within\r\nhimself the cause of his own mirages. Whenever we accept an idea as\r\nauthority instead of as instrument, an idol is set up. We worship the\r\nplough, and not the fruit. And from this habit there is no permanent\r\nescape. Only effort can keep the mind centered truly. Whenever criticism\r\nslackens, whenever we sink into acquiescence, the mind swerves aside and\r\nclings with the gratitude of the weary to some fixed idea. It is so much\r\neasier to follow a rule of thumb, and obey the constitution, than to find\r\nout what we really want and to do it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA great deal of political theory has been devoted to asking: what is the\r\naim of government? Many readers may have wondered why that question has\r\nnot figured in these pages. For the logical method would be to decide\r\nupon the ultimate ideal of statecraft and then elaborate the technique of\r\nits realization. I have not done that because this rational procedure\r\ninverts the natural order of things and develops all kinds of theoretical\r\ntangles and pseudo-problems. They come from an effort to state abstractly\r\nin intellectual terms qualities that can be known only by direct\r\nexperience. You achieve nothing but confusion if you begin by announcing\r\nthat politics must achieve \"justice\" or \"liberty\" or \"happiness.\" Even\r\nthough you are perfectly sure that you know exactly what these words mean\r\ntranslated into concrete experiences, it is very doubtful whether you can\r\nreally convey your meaning to anyone else. \"Plaisante justice qu'une\r\nrivière borne. Vérité, au deçà des Pyrénées, erreur au de là,\" says\r\nPascal. If what is good in the world depended on our ability to define it\r\nwe should be hopeless indeed.\r\n\r\nThis is an old difficulty in ethics. Many men have remarked that we\r\nquarrel over the \"problem of evil,\" never over the \"problem of good.\"\r\nThat comes from the fact that good is a quality of experience which does\r\nnot demand an explanation. When we are thwarted we begin to ask why. It\r\nwas the evil in the world that set Leibniz the task of justifying the\r\nways of God to man. Nor is it an accident that in daily life misfortune\r\nturns men to philosophy. One might generalize and say that as soon as we\r\nbegin to explain, it is because we have been made to complain.\r\n\r\nNo moral judgment can decide the value of life. No ethical theory can\r\nannounce any intrinsic good. The whole speculation about morality is an\r\neffort to find a way of living which men who live it will instinctively\r\nfeel is good. No formula can express an ultimate experience; no axiom can\r\never be a substitute for what really makes life worth living. Plato may\r\ndescribe the objects which man rejoices over, he may guide them to good\r\nexperiences, but each man in his inward life is a last judgment on all\r\nhis values.\r\n\r\nThis amounts to saying that the goal of action is in its final analysis\r\næsthetic and not moral--a quality of feeling instead of conformity to\r\nrule. Words like justice, harmony, power, democracy are simply empirical\r\nsuggestions which may produce the good life. If the practice of them does\r\nnot produce it then we are under no obligation to follow them, we should\r\nbe idolatrous fools to do so. Every abstraction, every rule of conduct,\r\nevery constitution, every law and social arrangement, is an instrument\r\nthat has no value in itself. Whatever credit it receives, whatever\r\nreverence we give it, is derived from its utility in ministering to those\r\nconcrete experiences which are as obvious and as undefinable as color or\r\nsound. We can celebrate the positively good things, we can live them, we\r\ncan create them, but we cannot philosophize about them. To the anæsthetic\r\nintellect we could not convey the meaning of joy. A creature that could\r\nreason but not feel would never know the value of life, for what is\r\nultimate is in itself inexplicable.\r\n\r\nPolitics is not concerned with prescribing the ultimate qualities of\r\nlife. When it tries to do so by sumptuary legislation, nothing but\r\nmischief is invoked. Its business is to provide opportunities, not to\r\nannounce ultimate values; to remove oppressive evil and to invent new\r\nresources for enjoyment. With the enjoyment itself it can have no\r\nconcern. That must be lived by each individual. In a sense the politician\r\ncan never know his own success, for it is registered in men's inner\r\nlives, and is largely incommunicable. An increasing harvest of rich\r\npersonalities is the social reward for a fine statesmanship, but such\r\npersonalities are free growths in a cordial environment. They cannot be\r\ncast in moulds or shaped by law. There is no need, therefore, to generate\r\ndialectical disputes about the final goal of politics. No definition can\r\nbe just--too precise a one can only deceive us into thinking that our\r\ndefinition is true. Call ultimate values by any convenient name, it is of\r\nslight importance which you choose. If only men can keep their minds\r\nfreed from formalism, idol worship, fixed ideas, and exalted\r\nabstractions, politicians need not worry about the language in which the\r\nend of our striving is expressed. For with the removal of distracting\r\nidols, man's experience becomes the center of thought. And if we think in\r\nterms of men, find out what really bothers them, seek to supply what they\r\nreally want, hold only their experience sacred, we shall find our\r\nsanction obvious and unchallenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF CREEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first course in philosophy was nothing less than a summary of the\r\nimportant systems of thought put forward in Western Europe during the\r\nlast twenty-six hundred years. Perhaps that is a slight exaggeration--we\r\ndid gloss over a few centuries in the Middle Ages. For the rest we\r\ntouched upon all the historic names from Thales to Nietzsche. After about\r\nnine weeks of this bewildering transit a friend approached me with a sour\r\nlook on his face. \"You know,\" he said, \"I can't make head or tail out of\r\nthis business. I agree with each philosopher as we study him. But when we\r\nget to the next one, I agree with him too. Yet he generally says the\r\nother one was wrong. They can't all be right. Can they now?\" I was too\r\nmuch puzzled with the same difficulty to help him.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later I began to read the history of political theories. It was\r\na less disinterested study than those sophomore speculations, for I had\r\njumped into a profession which carried me through some of the underground\r\npassages of \"practical politics\" and reformist groups. The tangle of\r\nmotives and facts and ideas was incredible. I began to feel the force of\r\nMr. John Hobson's remark that \"if practical workers for social and\r\nindustrial reforms continue to ignore principles ... they will have to\r\npay the price which short-sighted empiricism always pays; with slow,\r\nhesitant, and staggering steps, with innumerable false starts and\r\nbackslidings, they will move in the dark along an unseen track toward an\r\nunseen goal.\" The political theorists laid some claim to lighting up both\r\nthe track and the goal, and so I turned to them for help.\r\n\r\nNow whoever has followed political theory will have derived perhaps two\r\nconvictions as a reward. Almost all the thinkers seem to regard their\r\nsystems as true and binding, and none of these systems are. No matter\r\nwhich one you examine, it is inadequate. You cannot be a Platonist or a\r\nBenthamite in politics to-day. You cannot go to any of the great\r\nphilosophers even for the outlines of a statecraft which shall be fairly\r\ncomplete, and relevant to American life. I returned to the sophomore\r\nmood: \"Each of these thinkers has contributed something, has had some\r\nwisdom about events. Looked at in bulk the philosophers can't all be\r\nright or all wrong.\"\r\n\r\nBut like so many theoretical riddles, this one rested on a very simple\r\npiece of ignorance. The trouble was that without realizing it I too had\r\nbeen in search of the philosopher's stone. I too was looking for\r\nsomething that could not be found. That happened in this case to be\r\nnothing less than an absolutely true philosophy of politics. It was the\r\nold indolence of hoping that somebody had done the world's thinking once\r\nand for all. I had conjured up the fantasy of a system which would\r\ncontain the whole of life, be as reliable as a table of logarithms,\r\nforesee all possible emergencies and offer entirely trustworthy rules of\r\naction. When it seemed that no such system had ever been produced, I was\r\non the point of damning the entire tribe of theorists from Plato to Marx.\r\n\r\nThis is what one may call the naïveté of the intellect. Its hope is that\r\nsome man living at one place on the globe in a particular epoch will,\r\nthrough the miracle of genius, be able to generalize his experience for\r\nall time and all space. It says in effect that there is never anything\r\nessentially new under the sun, that any moment of experience sufficiently\r\nunderstood would be seen to contain all history and all destiny--that the\r\nintellect reasoning on one piece of experience could know what all the\r\nrest of experience was like. Looked at more closely this philosophy means\r\nthat novelty is an illusion of ignorance, that life is an endless\r\nrepetition, that when you know one revolution of it, you know all the\r\nrest. In a very real sense the world has no history and no future, the\r\nrace has no career. At any moment everything is given: our reason could\r\nknow that moment so thoroughly that all the rest of life would be like\r\nthe commuter's who travels back and forth on the same line every day.\r\nThere would be no inventions and no discoveries, for in the instant that\r\nreason had found the key of experience everything would be unfolded. The\r\npresent would not be the womb of the future: nothing would be embryonic,\r\nnothing would _grow_. Experience would cease to be an adventure in order\r\nto become the monotonous fulfilment of a perfect prophecy.\r\n\r\nThis omniscience of the human intellect is one of the commonest\r\nassumptions in the world. Although when you state the belief as I have,\r\nit sounds absurdly pretentious, yet the boastfulness is closer to the\r\nchild's who stretches out its hand for the moon than the romantic\r\negotist's who thinks he has created the moon and all the stars. Whole\r\nsystems of philosophy have claimed such an eternal and absolute validity;\r\nthe nineteenth century produced a bumper crop of so-called atheists,\r\nmaterialists and determinists who believed in all sincerity that\r\n\"Science\" was capable of a complete truth and unfailing prediction. If\r\nyou want to see this faith in all its naïveté go into those quaint\r\nrationalist circles where Herbert Spencer's ghost announces the \"laws of\r\nlife,\" with only a few inessential details omitted.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, no philosophy of this sort has ever realized such hopes.\r\nMankind has certainly come nearer to justifying Mr. Chesterton's\r\nobservation that one of its favorite games is called \"Cheat the\r\nProphet.\"... \"The players listen very carefully and respectfully to all\r\nthat the clever men have to say about what is to happen in the next\r\ngeneration. The players then wait until all the clever men are dead, and\r\nbury them nicely. They then go and do something else.\" Now this weakness\r\nis not, as Mr. Chesterton would like to believe, confined to the clever\r\nmen. But it is a weakness, and many people have speculated about it. Why\r\nin the face of hundreds of philosophies wrecked on the rocks of the\r\nunexpected do men continue to believe that the intellect can transcend\r\nthe vicissitudes of experience?\r\n\r\nFor they certainly do believe it, and generally the more parochial their\r\noutlook, the more cosmic their pretensions. All of us at times yearn for\r\nthe comfort of an absolute philosophy. We try to believe that, however\r\nfinite we may be, our intellect is something apart from the cycle of our\r\nlife, capable by an Olympian detachment from human interests of a divine\r\nthoroughness. Even our evolutionist philosophy, as Bergson shows, \"begins\r\nby showing us in the intellect a local effect of evolution, a flame,\r\nperhaps accidental, which lights up the coming and going of living things\r\nin the narrow passage open to their action; and lo! forgetting what it\r\nhas just told us, makes of this lantern glimmering in a tunnel a Sun\r\nwhich can illuminate the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what most of us do in our search for a philosophy of politics. We\r\nforget that the big systems of theory are much more like village\r\nlamp-posts than they are like the sun, that they were made to light up a\r\nparticular path, obviate certain dangers, and aid a peculiar mode of\r\nlife. The understanding of the place of theory in life is a comparatively\r\nnew one. We are just beginning to see how creeds are made. And the\r\ninsight is enormously fertile. Thus Mr. Alfred Zimmern in his fine study\r\nof \"The Greek Commonwealth\" says of Plato and Aristotle that no\r\ninterpretation can be satisfactory which does not take into account the\r\nimpression left upon their minds by the social development which made the\r\nage of these philosophers a period of Athenian decline. Mr. Zimmern's\r\napproach is common enough in modern scholarship, but the full\r\nsignificance of it for the creeds we ourselves are making is still\r\nsomething of a novelty. When we are asked to think of the \"Republic\" as\r\nthe reaction of decadent Greece upon the conservative temperament of\r\nPlato, the function of theory is given a new illumination. Political\r\nphilosophy at once appears as a human invention in a particular\r\ncrisis--an instrument to fit a need. The pretension to finality falls\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThis is a great emancipation. Instead of clinging to the naïve belief\r\nthat Plato was legislating for all mankind, you can discuss his plans as\r\na temporary superstructure made for an historical purpose. You are free\r\nthen to appreciate the more enduring portions of his work, to understand\r\nSantayana when he says of the Platonists, \"their theories are so\r\nextravagant, yet their wisdom seems so great. Platonism is a very refined\r\nand beautiful expression of our natural instincts, it embodies conscience\r\nand utters our inmost hopes.\" This insight into the values of human life,\r\npartial though it be, is what constitutes the abiding monument of Plato's\r\ngenius. His constructions, his formal creeds, his law-making and social\r\narrangements are local and temporary--for us they can have only an\r\nantiquarian interest.\r\n\r\nIn some such way as this the sophomoric riddle is answered: no thinker\r\ncan lay down a course of action for all mankind--programs if they are\r\nuseful at all are useful for some particular historical period. But if\r\nthe thinker sees at all deeply into the life of his own time, his\r\ntheoretical system will rest upon observation of human nature. That\r\nremains as a residue of wisdom long after his reasoning and his concrete\r\nprogram have passed into limbo. For human nature in all its profounder\r\naspects changes very little in the few generations since our Western\r\nwisdom has come to be recorded. These _aperçus_ left over from the great\r\nspeculations are the golden threads which successive thinkers weave into\r\nthe pattern of their thought. Wisdom remains; theory passes.\r\n\r\nIf that is true of Plato with his ample vision how much truer is it of\r\nthe theories of the littler men--politicians, courtiers and propagandists\r\nwho make up the academy of politics. Machiavelli will, of course, be\r\nremembered at once as a man, whose speculations were fitted to an\r\nhistorical crisis. His advice to the Prince was real advice, not a\r\nsermon. A boss was telling a governor how to extend his power. The wealth\r\nof Machiavelli's learning and the splendid penetration of his mind are\r\nused to interpret experience for a particular purpose. I have always\r\nthought that Machiavelli derives his bad name from a too transparent\r\nhonesty. Less direct minds would have found high-sounding ethical\r\nsanctions in which to conceal the real intent. That was the nauseating\r\nmethod of nineteenth century economists when they tried to identify the\r\nbrutal practices of capitalism with the beneficence of nature and the\r\nWill of God. Not so Machiavelli. He could write without a blush that \"a\r\nprince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which\r\nmen are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to\r\nact contrary to fidelity, friendship, humanity, and religion.\" The\r\napologists of business also justified a rupture with human decencies.\r\nThey too fitted their theory to particular purposes, but they had not the\r\ncourage to avow it even to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe rare value of Machiavelli is just this lack of self-deception. You\r\nmay think his morals devilish, but you cannot accuse him of quoting\r\nscripture. I certainly do not admire the end he serves: the extension of\r\nan autocrat's power is a frivolous perversion of government. His ideal\r\nhappens, however, to be the aim of most foreign offices, politicians and\r\n\"princes of finance.\" Machiavelli's morals are not one bit worse than the\r\npractices of the men who rule the world to-day. An American Senate tore\r\nup the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, and with the approval of the President\r\nacted \"contrary to fidelity\" and friendship too; Austria violated the\r\nTreaty of Berlin by annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Machiavelli's ethics\r\nare commonplace enough. His head is clearer than the average. He let the\r\ncat out of the bag and showed in the boldest terms how theory becomes an\r\ninstrument of practice. You may take him as a symbol of the political\r\ntheorist. You may say that all the thinkers of influence have been\r\nwriting advice to the Prince. Machiavelli recognized Lorenzo the\r\nMagnificent; Marx, the proletariat of Europe.\r\n\r\nAt first this sounds like standing the world on its head, denying reason\r\nand morality, and exalting practice over righteousness. That is neither\r\nhere nor there. I am simply trying to point out an illuminating fact\r\nwhose essential truth can hardly be disputed. The important social\r\nphilosophies are consciously or otherwise the servants of men's purposes.\r\nGood or bad, that it seems to me is the way we work. We find reasons for\r\nwhat we want to do. The big men from Machiavelli through Rousseau to Karl\r\nMarx brought history, logic, science and philosophy to prop up and\r\nstrengthen their deepest desires. The followers, the epigones, may accept\r\nthe reasons of Rousseau and Marx and deduce rules of action from them.\r\nBut the original genius sees the dynamic purpose first, finds reasons\r\nafterward. This amounts to saying that man when he is most creative is\r\nnot a rational, but a wilful animal.\r\n\r\nThe political thinker who to-day exercises the greatest influence on the\r\nWestern World is, I suppose, Karl Marx. The socialist movement calls him\r\nits prophet, and, while many socialists say he is superseded, no one\r\ndisputes his historical importance. Now Marx embalmed his thinking in the\r\nlanguage of the Hegelian school. He founded it on a general philosophy of\r\nsociety which is known as the materialistic conception of history.\r\nMoreover, Marx put forth the claim that he had made socialism\r\n\"scientific\"--had shown that it was woven into the texture of natural\r\nphenomena. The Marxian paraphernalia crowds three heavy volumes, so\r\nelaborate and difficult that socialists rarely read them. I have known\r\none socialist who lived leisurely on his country estate and claimed to\r\nhave \"looked\" at every page of Marx. Most socialists, including the\r\nleaders, study selected passages and let it go at that. This is a wise\r\neconomy based on a good instinct. For all the parade of learning and\r\ndialectic is an after-thought--an accident from the fact that the\r\nprophetic genius of Marx appeared in Germany under the incubus of Hegel.\r\nMarx saw what he wanted to do long before he wrote three volumes to\r\njustify it. Did not the Communist Manifesto appear many years before \"Das\r\nKapital\"?\r\n\r\nNothing is more instructive than a socialist \"experience\" meeting at\r\nwhich everyone tries to tell how he came to be converted. These\r\ngatherings are notoriously untruthful--in fact, there is a genial\r\npleasure in not telling the truth about one's salad days in the socialist\r\nmovement. The prevalent lie is to explain how the new convert, standing\r\nupon a mountain of facts, began to trace out the highways that led from\r\nhell to heaven. Everybody knows that no such process was actually lived\r\nthrough, and almost without exception the real story can be discerned: a\r\nman was dissatisfied, he wanted a new condition of life, he embraced a\r\ntheory that would justify his hopes and his discontent. For once you\r\ntouch the biographies of human beings, the notion that political beliefs\r\nare logically determined collapses like a pricked balloon. In the\r\nlanguage of philosophers, socialism as a living force is a product of the\r\nwill--a will to beauty, order, neighborliness, not infrequently a will to\r\nhealth. Men desire first, then they reason; fascinated by the future,\r\nthey invent a \"scientific socialism\" to get there.\r\n\r\nMany people don't like to admit this. Or if they admit it, they do so\r\nwith a sigh. Their minds construct a utopia--one in which all judgments\r\nare based on logical inference from syllogisms built on the law of\r\nmathematical probabilities. If you quote David Hume at them, and say that\r\nreason itself is an irrational impulse they think you are indulging in a\r\nsilly paradox. I shall not pursue this point very far, but I believe it\r\ncould be shown without too much difficulty that the rationalists are\r\nfascinated by a certain kind of thinking--logical and orderly\r\nthinking--and that it is their will to impose that method upon other men.\r\n\r\nFor fear that somebody may regard this as a play on words drawn from some\r\nultra-modern \"anti-intellectualist\" source, let me quote Santayana. This\r\nis what the author of that masterly series \"The Life of Reason\" wrote in\r\none of his earlier books: \"The ideal of rationality is itself as\r\narbitrary, as much dependent on the needs of a finite organization, as\r\nany other ideal. Only as ultimately securing tranquillity of mind, which\r\nthe philosopher instinctively pursues, has it for him any necessity. In\r\nspite of the verbal propriety of saying that reason demands rationality,\r\nwhat really demands rationality, what makes it a good and indispensable\r\nthing and gives it all its authority, is not its own nature, but our need\r\nof it both in safe and economical action and in the pleasures of\r\ncomprehension.\" Because rationality itself is a wilful exercise one hears\r\nHymns to Reason and sees it personified as an extremely dignified\r\ngoddess. For all the light and shadow of sentiment and passion play even\r\nabout the syllogism.\r\n\r\nThe attempts of theorists to explain man's successes as rational acts and\r\nhis failures as lapses of reason have always ended in a dismal and misty\r\nunreality. No genuine politician ever treats his constituents as\r\nreasoning animals. This is as true of the high politics of Isaiah as it\r\nis of the ward boss. Only the pathetic amateur deludes himself into\r\nthinking that, if he presents the major and minor premise, the voter will\r\nautomatically draw the conclusion on election day. The successful\r\npolitician--good or bad--deals with the dynamics--with the will, the\r\nhopes, the needs and the visions of men.\r\n\r\nIt isn't sentimentality which says that where there is no vision the\r\npeople perisheth. Every time Tammany Hall sets off fireworks and oratory\r\non the Fourth of July; every time the picture of Lincoln is displayed at\r\na political convention; every red bandanna of the Progressives and red\r\nflag of the socialists; every song from \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\"\r\nto the \"International\"; every metrical conclusion to a great\r\nspeech--whether we stand at Armageddon, refuse to press upon the brow of\r\nlabor another crown of thorns, or call upon the workers of the world to\r\nunite--every one of these slogans is an incitement of the will--an effort\r\nto energize politics. They are attempts to harness blind impulses to\r\nparticular purposes. They are tributes to the sound practical sense of a\r\nvision in politics. No cause can succeed without them: so long as you\r\nrely on the efficacy of \"scientific\" demonstration and logical proof you\r\ncan hold your conventions in anybody's back parlor and have room to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\nI remember an observation that Lincoln Steffens made in a speech about\r\nMayor Tom Johnson. \"Tom failed,\" said Mr. Steffens, \"because he was too\r\npractical.\" Coming from a man who had seen as much of actual politics as\r\nMr. Steffens, it puzzled me a great deal. I taxed him with it later and\r\nhe explained somewhat as follows: \"Tom Johnson had a vision of Cleveland\r\nwhich he called The City on the Hill. He pictured the town emancipated\r\nfrom its ugliness and its cruelty--a beautiful city for free men and\r\nwomen. He used to talk of that vision to the 'cabinet' of political\r\nlieutenants which met every Sunday night at his house. He had all his\r\nappointees working for the City on the Hill. But when he went out\r\ncampaigning before the people he talked only of three-cent fares and the\r\ntax outrages. Tom Johnson didn't show the people the City on the Hill. He\r\ndidn't take them into his confidence. They never really saw what it was\r\nall about. And they went back on Tom Johnson.\"\r\n\r\nThat is one of Mr. Steffens's most acute observations. What makes it\r\ndoubly interesting is that Tom Johnson confirmed it a few months before\r\nhe died. His friends were telling him that his defeat was temporary, that\r\nthe work he had begun was unchecked. It was plain that in the midst of\r\nhis suffering, with death close by, he found great comfort in that\r\nassurance. But his mind was so realistic, his integrity so great that he\r\ncould not blink the fact that there had been a defeat. Steffens was\r\npointing out the explanation: \"you did not show the people what you saw,\r\nyou gave them the details, you fought their battles, you started to\r\nbuild, but you left them in darkness as to the final goal.\"\r\n\r\nI wish I could recall the exact words in which Tom Johnson replied. For\r\nin them the greatest of the piecemeal reformers admitted the practical\r\nweakness of opportunist politics.\r\n\r\nThere is a type of radical who has an idea that he can insinuate advanced\r\nideas into legislation without being caught. His plan of action is to\r\nkeep his real program well concealed and to dole out sections of it to\r\nthe public from time to time. John A. Hobson in \"The Crisis of\r\nLiberalism\" describes the \"practical reformer\" so that anybody can\r\nrecognize him: \"This revolt against ideas is carried so far that able men\r\nhave come seriously to look upon progress as a matter for the\r\nmanipulation of wire-pullers, something to be 'jobbed' in committee by\r\nsophistical notions or other clever trickery.\" Lincoln Steffens calls\r\nthese people \"our damned rascals.\" Mr. Hobson continues, \"The attraction\r\nof some obvious gain, the suppression of some scandalous abuse of\r\nmonopolist power by a private company, some needed enlargement of\r\nexisting Municipal or State enterprise by lateral expansion--such are the\r\nsole springs of action.\" Well may Mr. Hobson inquire, _\"Now, what\r\nprovision is made for generating the motor power of progress in\r\nCollectivism?\"_\r\n\r\nNo amount of architect's plans, bricks and mortar will build a house.\r\nSomeone must have the wish to build it. So with the modern democratic\r\nstate. Statesmanship cannot rest upon the good sense of its program. It\r\nmust find popular feeling, organize it, and make that the motive power of\r\ngovernment. If you study the success of Roosevelt the point is\r\nre-enforced. He is a man of will in whom millions of people have felt the\r\nembodiment of their own will. For a time Roosevelt was a man of destiny\r\nin the truest sense. He wanted what a nation wanted: his own power\r\nradiated power; he embodied a vision; Tom, Dick and Harry moved with his\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nNo use to deplore the fact. You cannot stop a living body with nothing at\r\nall. I think we may picture society as a compound of forces that are\r\nalways changing. Put a vision in front of one of these currents and you\r\ncan magnetize it in that direction. For visions alone organize popular\r\npassions. Try to ignore them or box them up, and they will burst forth\r\ndestructively. When Haywood dramatizes the class struggle he uses class\r\nresentment for a social purpose. You may not like his purpose, but unless\r\nyou can gather proletarian power into some better vision, you have no\r\ngrounds for resenting Haywood. I fancy that the demonstration of King\r\nCanute settled once and for all the stupid attempt to ignore a moving\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nA dynamic conception of society always frightens a great number of\r\npeople. It gives politics a restless and intractable quality. Pure reason\r\nis so gentlemanly, but will and the visions of a people--these are\r\nadventurous and incalculable forces. Most politicians living for the day\r\nprefer to ignore them. If only society will stand fairly still while\r\ntheir career is in the making they are content to avoid the actualities.\r\nBut a politician with some imaginative interest in genuine affairs need\r\nnot be seduced into the learned folly of pretending that reality is\r\nsomething else than it is. If he is to influence life he must deal with\r\nit. A deep respect is due the Schopenhauerian philosopher who looks upon\r\nthe world, finds that its essence is evil, and turns towards insensitive\r\ncalm. But no respect is due to anyone who sets out to reform the world by\r\nignoring its quality. Whoever is bent upon shaping politics to better\r\nhuman uses must accept freely as his starting point the impulses that\r\nagitate human beings. If observation shows that reason is an instrument\r\nof will, then only confusion can result from pretending that it isn't.\r\n\r\nI have called this misplaced \"rationality\" a piece of learned folly,\r\nbecause it shows itself most dangerously among those thinkers about\r\npolitics who are divorced from action. In the Universities political\r\nmovements are generally regarded as essentially static, cut and dried\r\nsolids to be judged by their logical consistency. It is as if the stream\r\nof life had to be frozen before it could be studied. The socialist\r\nmovement was given a certain amount of attention when I was an\r\nundergraduate. The discussion turned principally on two points: were\r\nrent, interest and dividends _earned_? Was collective ownership of\r\ncapital a feasible scheme? And when the professor, who was a good\r\ndialectician, had proved that interest was a payment for service\r\n(\"saving\") and that public ownership was not practicable, it was assumed\r\nthat socialism was disposed of. The passions, the needs, the hopes that\r\ngenerate this world-wide phenomenon were, I believe, pocketed and ignored\r\nunder the pat saying: \"Of course, socialism is not an economic policy,\r\nit's a religion.\" That was the end of the matter for the students of\r\npolitics. It was then a matter for the divinity schools. If the same\r\nscholastic method is in force there, all that would be needed to crush\r\nsocialism is to show its dogmatic inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThe theorist is incompetent when he deals with socialism just because he\r\nassumes that men are determined by logic and that a false conclusion will\r\nstop a moving, creative force. Occasionally he recognizes the wilful\r\ncharacter of politics: then he shakes his head, climbs into an ivory\r\ntower and deplores the moonshine, the religious manias and the passions\r\nof the mob. Real life is beyond his control and influence because real\r\nlife is largely agitated by impulses and habits, unconscious needs,\r\nfaith, hope and desire. With all his learning he is ineffective because,\r\ninstead of trying to use the energies of men, he deplores them.\r\n\r\nSuppose we recognize that creeds are instruments of the will, how would\r\nit alter the character of our thinking? Take an ancient quarrel like that\r\nover determinism. Whatever your philosophy, when you come to the test of\r\nactual facts you find, I think, all grades of freedom and determinism.\r\nFor certain purposes you believe in free will, for others you do not.\r\nThus, as Mr. Chesterton suggests, no determinist is prevented from saying\r\n\"if you please\" to the housemaid. In love, in your career, you have no\r\ndoubt that \"if\" is a reality. But when you are engaged in scientific\r\ninvestigation, you try to reduce the spontaneous in life to a minimum.\r\nMr. Arnold Bennett puts forth a rather curious hybrid when he advises us\r\nto treat ourselves as free agents and everyone else as an automaton. On\r\nthe other hand Prof. Münsterberg has always insisted that in social\r\nrelations we must always treat everyone as a purposeful, integrated\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nYour doctrine, in short, depends on your purpose: a theory by itself is\r\nneither moral nor immoral, its value is conditioned by the purpose it\r\nserves. In any accurate sense theory is to be judged only as an effective\r\nor ineffective instrument of a desire: the discussion of doctrines is\r\ntechnical and not moral. A theory has no intrinsic value: that is why the\r\ndevil can talk theology.\r\n\r\nNo creed possesses any final sanction. Human beings have desires that are\r\nfar more important than the tools and toys and churches they make to\r\nsatisfy them. It is more penetrating, in my opinion, to ask of a creed\r\nwhether it served than whether it was \"true.\" Try to judge the great\r\nbeliefs that have swayed mankind by their inner logic or their empirical\r\nsolidity and you stand forever, a dull pedant, apart from the interests\r\nof men. The Christian tradition did not survive because of Aquinas or\r\nfall before the Higher Criticism, nor will it be revived because someone\r\nproves the scientific plausibility of its doctrine. What we need to know\r\nabout the Christian epic is the effect it had on men--true or false, they\r\nhave believed in it for nineteen centuries. Where has it helped them,\r\nwhere hindered? What needs did it answer? What energies did it transmute?\r\nAnd what part of mankind did it neglect? Where did it begin to do\r\nviolence to human nature?\r\n\r\nPolitical creeds must receive the same treatment. The doctrine of the\r\n\"social contract\" formulated by Hobbes and made current by Rousseau can\r\nno longer be accepted as a true account of the origin of society.\r\nJean-Jacques is in fact a supreme case--perhaps even a slight\r\ncaricature--of the way in which formal creeds bolster up passionate\r\nwants. I quote from Prof. Walter's introduction in which he says that\r\n\"The Social Contract _showed to those who were eager to be convinced_\r\nthat no power was legitimate which was guilty of abuses. It is no wonder\r\nthat its author was buried in the Pantheon with pompous procession, that\r\nthe framers of the new Constitution, Thouret and Lièyes and La Fayette,\r\ndid not forget and dared not forget its doctrines, that it was the\r\ntext-book and the delight of Camille Desmoulins and Danton and St. Just,\r\nthat Robespierre read it through once every day.\" In the perspective of\r\nhistory, no one feels that he has said the last word about a philosophy\r\nlike Rousseau's after demonstrating its \"untruth.\" Good or bad, it has\r\nmeant too much for any such easy disposal. What shall we call an idea,\r\nobjectively untrue, but practically of the highest importance?\r\n\r\nThe thinker who has faced this difficulty most radically is Georges Sorel\r\nin the \"Reflexions sur la Violence.\" His doctrine of the \"social myth\"\r\nhas seemed to many commentators one of those silly paradoxes that only a\r\nrevolutionary syndicalist and Frenchman could have put forward. M. Sorel\r\nis engaged in presenting the General Strike as the decisive battle of the\r\nclass struggle and the core of the socialist movement. Now whatever else\r\nhe may be, M. Sorel is not naïve: the sharp criticism of other socialists\r\nwas something he could not peacefully ignore. They told him that the\r\nGeneral Strike was an idle dream, that it could never take place, that,\r\neven if it could, the results would not be very significant. Sidney Webb,\r\nin the customary Fabian fashion, had dismissed the General Strike as a\r\nsign of socialist immaturity. There is no doubt that M. Sorel felt the\r\nforce of these attacks. But he was not ready to abandon his favorite idea\r\nbecause it had been shown to be unreasonable and impossible. Just the\r\nopposite effect showed itself and he seized the opportunity of turning an\r\nintellectual defeat into a spiritual triumph. This performance must have\r\ndelighted him to the very bottom of his soul, for he has boasted that his\r\ntask in life is to aid in ruining \"le prestige de la culture bourgeoise.\"\r\n\r\nM. Sorel's defence of the General Strike is very startling. He admits\r\nthat it may never take place, that it is not a true picture of the goal\r\nof the socialist movement. Without a blush he informs us that this\r\ncentral gospel of the working class is simply a \"myth.\" The admission\r\nfrightens M. Sorel not at all. \"It doesn't matter much,\" he remarks,\r\n\"whether myths contain details actually destined to realization _in the\r\nscheme_ of an historical future; they are not astrological almanacks; it\r\nmay even be that nothing of what they express will actually happen--as in\r\nthe case of that catastrophe which the early Christians expected. Are we\r\nnot accustomed in daily life to recognizing that the reality differs very\r\ngreatly from the ideas of it that we made before we acted? Yet that\r\ndoesn't hinder us from making resolutions.... Myths must be judged as\r\ninstruments for acting upon present conditions; all discussion about the\r\nmanner of applying them concretely to the course of history is senseless.\r\n_The entire myth is what counts...._ There is no use then in reasoning\r\nabout details which might arise in the midst of the class struggle ...\r\neven though the revolutionists should be deceiving themselves through and\r\nthrough in making a fantastic picture of the general strike, this picture\r\nwould still have been a power of the highest order in preparing for\r\nrevolution, so long as it expressed completely all the aspirations of\r\nsocialism and bound together revolutionary ideas with a precision and\r\nfirmness that no other methods of thought could have given.\"\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that this highly sophisticated doctrine was\r\nregarded as perverse. All the ordinary prejudices of thought are\r\nirritated by a thinker who frankly advises masses of his fellow-men to\r\nhold fast to a belief which by all the canons of common sense is nothing\r\nbut an illusion. M. Sorel must have felt the need of closer statement,\r\nfor in a letter to Daniel Halèvy, published in the second edition, he\r\nmakes his position much clearer. \"Revolutionary myths ...\" we read,\r\n\"enable us to understand the activity, the feelings, and the ideas of a\r\npopulace preparing to enter into a decisive struggle; _they are not\r\ndescriptions of things, but expressions of will_.\" The italics are mine:\r\nthey set in relief the insight that makes M. Sorel so important to our\r\ndiscussion. I do not know whether a quotation torn from its context can\r\npossibly do justice to its author. I do know that for any real grasp of\r\nthis point it is necessary to read M. Sorel with great sympathy.\r\n\r\nOne must grant at least that he has made an accurate observation. The\r\nhistory of the world is full of great myths which have had the most\r\nconcrete results. M. Sorel cites primitive Christianity, the Reformation,\r\nthe French Revolution and the Mazzini campaign. The men who took part in\r\nthose great social movements summed up their aspiration in pictures of\r\ndecisive battles resulting in the ultimate triumph of their cause. We in\r\nAmerica might add an example from our own political life. For it is\r\nTheodore Roosevelt who is actually attempting to make himself and his\r\nadmirers the heroes of a new social myth. Did he not announce from the\r\nplatform at Chicago--\"we stand at Armageddon and we battle for the Lord\"?\r\n\r\nLet no one dismiss M. Sorel then as an empty paradoxer. The myth is not\r\none of the outgrown crudities of our pagan ancestors. We, in the midst of\r\nour science and our rationalism, are still making myths, and their force\r\nis felt in the actual affairs of life. They convey an impulse, not a\r\nprogram, nor a plan of reconstruction. Their practical value cannot be\r\nignored, for they embody the motor currents in social life.\r\n\r\nMyths are to be judged, as M. Sorel says, by their ability to express\r\naspiration. They stand or fall by that. In such a test the Christian\r\nmyth, for example, would be valued for its power of incarnating human\r\ndesire. That it did not do so completely is the cause of its decline.\r\nFrom Aucassin to Nietzsche men have resented it as a partial and stunting\r\ndream. It had too little room for profane love, and only by turning the\r\nChurch of Christ into the Church Militant could the essential Christian\r\npassivity obtain the assent of aggressive and masculine races. To-day\r\ntraditional Christianity has weakened in the face of man's interest in\r\nthe conquest of this world. The liberal and advanced churches recognize\r\nthis fact by exhibiting a great preoccupation with everyday affairs. Now\r\nthey may be doing important service--I have no wish to deny that--but\r\nwhen the Christian Churches turn to civics, to reformism or socialism,\r\nthey are in fact announcing that the Christian dream is dead. They may\r\ncontinue to practice some of its moral teachings and hold to some of its\r\ncreed, but the Christian impulse is for them no longer active. A new\r\ndream, which they reverently call Christian, has sprung from their\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nDuring their life these social myths contain a nation's finest energy. It\r\nis just because they are \"not descriptions of things, but expressions of\r\nwill\" that their influence is so great. Ignore what a man desires and you\r\nignore the very source of his power; run against the grain of a nation's\r\ngenius and see where you get with your laws. Robert Burns was right when\r\nhe preferred poetry to charters. The recognition of this truth by Sorel\r\nis one of the most impressive events in the revolutionary movement.\r\nStanding as a spokesman of an actual social revolt, he has not lost his\r\nvision because he understands its function. If Machiavelli is a symbol of\r\nthe political theorist making reason an instrument of purpose, we may\r\ntake Sorel as a self-conscious representative of the impulses which\r\ngenerate purpose.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that respect for the myth is a discovery of\r\nSorel's. He is but one of a number of contemporary thinkers who have\r\nreacted against a very stupid prejudice of nineteenth century science to\r\nthe effect that the mental habits of human beings were not \"facts.\"\r\nUnless ideas mirrored external nature they were regarded as beneath the\r\nnotice of the scientific mind. But in more recent years we have come to\r\nrealize that, in a world so full of ignorance and mistake, error itself\r\nis worthy of study. Our untrue ideas are significant because they\r\ninfluence our lives enormously. They are \"facts\" to be investigated. One\r\nmight point to the great illumination that has resulted from Freud's\r\nanalysis of the abracadabra of our dreams. No one can any longer dismiss\r\nthe fantasy because it is logically inconsistent, superficially absurd,\r\nor objectively untrue. William James might also be cited for his defense\r\nof those beliefs that are beyond the realm of proof. His essay, \"The Will\r\nto Believe,\" is a declaration of independence, which says in effect that\r\nscientific demonstration is not the only test of ideas. He stated the\r\ncase for those beliefs which influence life so deeply, though they fail\r\nto describe it. James himself was very disconcerting to many scientists\r\nbecause he insisted on expressing his aspirations about the universe in\r\nwhat his colleague Santayana calls a \"romantic cosmology\": \"I am far from\r\nwishing to suggest that such a view seems to me more probable than\r\nconventional idealism or the Christian Orthodoxy. All three are in the\r\nregion of dramatic system-making and myth, to which probabilities are\r\nirrelevant.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to leave this point without quoting Nietzsche, who had\r\nthis insight and stated it most provocatively. In \"Beyond Good and Evil\"\r\nNietzsche says flatly that \"the falseness of an opinion is not for us any\r\nobjection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most\r\nstrangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering,\r\nlife-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing....\" Then he\r\ncomments on the philosophers. \"They all pose as though their real\r\nopinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a\r\ncold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic...; whereas, in fact, a\r\nprejudiced proposition, idea, or 'suggestion,' which is generally their\r\nheart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments\r\nsought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not wish to be\r\nregarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices,\r\nwhich they dub 'truths'--and _very_ far from having the conscience which\r\nbravely admits this to itself; very far from having the good taste or the\r\ncourage which goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn\r\nfriend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule.... It has\r\ngradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has\r\nconsisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of\r\ninvoluntary and unconscious autobiography, and, moreover, that the moral\r\n(or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital\r\ngerm out of which the entire plant has always grown.... Whoever considers\r\nthe fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they\r\nmay have acted as _inspiring_ genii (or as demons and cobolds) will find\r\nthat they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that\r\neach one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the\r\nultimate end of existence and the legitimate _lord_ over all the other\r\nimpulses. For every impulse is imperious, and, as _such_, attempts to\r\nphilosophize.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Nietzsche has done here is, in his swashbuckling fashion, to cut\r\nunder the abstract and final pretensions of creeds. Difficulties arise\r\nwhen we try to apply this wisdom in the present. That dogmas _were_\r\ninstruments of human purposes is not so incredible; that they still _are_\r\ninstruments is not so clear to everyone; and that they will be, that they\r\nshould be--this seems a monstrous attack on the citadel of truth. It is\r\npossible to believe that other men's theories were temporary and merely\r\nuseful; we like to believe that ours will have a greater authority.\r\n\r\nIt seems like topsy-turvyland to make reason serve the irrational. Yet\r\nthat is just what it has always done, and ought always to do. Many of us\r\nare ready to grant that in the past men's motives were deeper than their\r\nintellects: we forgive them with a kind of self-righteousness which says\r\nthat they knew not what they did. But to follow the great tradition of\r\nhuman wisdom deliberately, with our eyes open in the manner of Sorel,\r\nthat seems a crazy procedure. A notion of intellectual honor fights\r\nagainst it: we think we must aim at final truth, and not allow\r\nautobiography to creep into speculation.\r\n\r\nNow the trouble with such an idol is that autobiography creeps in anyway.\r\nThe more we censor it, the more likely it is to appear disguised, to fool\r\nus subtly and perhaps dangerously. The men like Nietzsche and James who\r\nshow the wilful origin of creeds are in reality the best watchers of the\r\ncitadel of truth. For there is nothing disastrous in the temporary nature\r\nof our ideas. They are always that. But there may very easily be a train\r\nof evil in the self-deception which regards them as final. I think God\r\nwill forgive us our skepticism sooner than our Inquisitions.\r\n\r\nFrom the political point of view, another observation is necessary. The\r\ncreed of a Rousseau, for example, is active in politics, not for what it\r\nsays, but for what people think it says. I have urged that Marx found\r\nscientific reasons for what he wanted to do. It is important to add that\r\nthe people who adopted his reasons for what they wanted to do were not\r\nany too respectful of Marx's reasons. Thus the so-called materialistic\r\nphilosophy of Karl Marx is not by any means identical with the theories\r\none hears among Marxian socialists. There is a big distortion in the\r\ntransmitting of ideas. A common purpose, far more than common ideas,\r\nbinds Marx to his followers. And when a man comes to write about his\r\nphilosophy he is confronted with a choice: shall the creed described be\r\nthat of Marx or of the Marxians?\r\n\r\nFor the study of politics I should say unhesitatingly that it is more\r\nimportant to know what socialist leaders, stump speakers, pamphleteers,\r\nthink Marx meant, than to know what he said. For then you are dealing\r\nwith living ideas: to search his text has its uses, but compared with the\r\nactual tradition of Marx it is the work of pedantry. I say this here for\r\ntwo reasons--because I hope to avoid the critical attack of the genuine\r\nMarxian specialist, and because the observation is, I believe, relevant\r\nto our subject.\r\n\r\nRelevant it is in that it suggests the importance of style, of\r\npropaganda, the popularization of ideas. The host of men who stand\r\nbetween a great thinker and the average man are not automatic\r\ntransmitters. They work on the ideas; perhaps that is why a genius\r\nusually hates his disciples. It is interesting to notice the explanation\r\ngiven by Frau Förster-Nietzsche for her brother's quarrel with Wagner.\r\nShe dates it from the time when Nietzsche, under the guise of Wagnerian\r\npropaganda, began to expound himself. The critics and interpreters are\r\nthemselves creative. It is really unfair to speak of the Marxian\r\nphilosophy as a political force. It is juster to speak of the Marxian\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nSo when I write of Marx's influence I have in mind what men and women in\r\nsocialist meetings, in daily life here in America, hold as a faith and\r\nattribute to Marx. There is no pretension whatever to any critical study\r\nof \"Das Kapital\" itself. I am thinking rather of stuffy halls in which an\r\nearnest voice is expounding \"the evolution of capitalism,\" of little\r\ngroups, curious and bewildered, listening in the streets of New York to\r\nthe story of the battle between the \"master class\" and the \"working\r\nclass,\" of little red pamphlets, of newspapers, and cartoons--awkward,\r\nbadly printed and not very genial, a great stream of spellbinding and\r\ncontroversy through which the aspirations of millions are becoming\r\narticulate:\r\n\r\nThe tradition is saying that \"the system\" and not the individual is at\r\nfault. It describes that system as one in which a small class owns the\r\nmeans of production and holds the rest of mankind in bondage. Arts,\r\nreligions, laws, as well as vice and crime and degradation, have their\r\nsource in this central economic condition. If you want to understand our\r\nlife you must see that it is determined by the massing of capital in the\r\nhands of a few. All epochs are determined by economic arrangements. But a\r\nsystem of property always contains within itself \"the seeds of its own\r\ndestruction.\" Mechanical inventions suggest a change: a dispossessed\r\nclass compels it. So mankind has progressed through savagery, chattel\r\nslavery, serfdom, to \"wage slavery\" or the capitalism of to-day. This age\r\nis pregnant with the socialism of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nSo roughly the tradition is handed on. Two sets of idea seem to dominate\r\nit: we are creatures of economic conditions; a war of classes is being\r\nfought everywhere in which the proletariat will ultimately capture the\r\nindustrial machinery and produce a sound economic life as the basis of\r\npeace and happiness for all. The emphasis on environment is insistent.\r\nFacts are marshaled, the news of the day is interpreted to show that men\r\nare determined by economic conditions. This fixation has brought down\r\nupon the socialists a torrent of abuse in which \"atheism\" and\r\n\"materialism\" are prevailing epithets. But the propaganda continues and\r\nthe philosophy spreads, penetrating reform groups, social workers,\r\nhistorians, and sociologists.\r\n\r\nIt has served the socialist purpose well. To the workingmen it has\r\nbrought home the importance of capturing the control of industry.\r\nEconomic determinism has been an antidote to mere preaching of goodness,\r\nto hero-worship and political quackery. Socialism to succeed had to\r\nconcentrate attention on the ownership of capital: whenever any other\r\ninterest like religion or patriotism threatened to diffuse that\r\nattention, socialist leaders have always been ready to show that the\r\neconomic fact is more central. Dignity and prestige were supplied by\r\nmaking economics the key of history; passion was chained by building\r\nparadise upon it.\r\n\r\nIn all the political philosophies there is none so adapted to its end.\r\nEvery sanction that mankind respects has been grouped about this one\r\npurpose--the control of capital. It is as if all history converged upon\r\nthe issue, and the workers in the cause feel that they carry within them\r\nthe destiny of the race. Start anywhere, with an orthodox socialist and\r\nhe will lead you to this supreme economic situation. Tyrannies and race\r\nhatred, national rivalries, sex problems, the difficulties of artistic\r\nendeavor, all failures, crimes, vices--there is not one which he will not\r\nrelate to private capitalism. Nor is there anything disingenuous about\r\nthis focusing of the attention: a real belief is there. Of course you\r\nwill find plenty of socialists who see other issues and who smile a bit\r\nat the rigors of economic determinism. In these later days there is in\r\nfact, a decided loosening in the creed. But it is fair to say that the\r\nmass of socialists hold this philosophy with as much solemnity as a\r\nreformer held his when he wrote to me that the cure for obscenity was the\r\ntaxation of land values and absolute free trade.\r\n\r\nSinglemindedness has done good service. It has bound the world together\r\nand has helped men to think socially. Turning their attention away from\r\nthe romanticism of history, the materialistic philosophy has helped them\r\nto look at realities. It has engendered a fine concern about average\r\npeople, about the voiceless multitudes who have been left to pass\r\nunnoticed. Not least among the blessings is a shattering of the\r\ngood-and-bad-man theory: the assassination of tyrants or the adoration of\r\nsaviors. A shallow and specious other-worldliness has been driven out: an\r\nother-worldliness which is really nothing but laziness about this one.\r\nAnd if from a speculative angle the Marxian tradition has shaded too\r\nheavily the economic facts, it was at least a plausible and practical\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nBut the drawbacks are becoming more and more evident as socialism\r\napproaches nearer to power and responsibility. The feeling that man is a\r\ncreature and not a creator is disastrous as a personal creed when you\r\ncome to act. If you insist upon being \"determined by conditions\" you do\r\nhesitate about saying \"I shall.\" You are likely to wait for something to\r\ndetermine you. Personal initiative and individual genius are poorly\r\nregarded: many socialists are suspicious of originality. This philosophy,\r\nso useful in propaganda, is becoming a burden in action. That is another\r\nway of saying that the instrument has turned into an idol.\r\n\r\nFor while it is illuminating to see how environment moulds men, it is\r\nabsolutely essential that men regard themselves as moulders of their\r\nenvironment. A new philosophical basis is becoming increasingly necessary\r\nto socialism--one that may not be \"truer\" than the old materialism but\r\nthat shall simply be more useful. Having learned for a long time what is\r\ndone to us, we are now faced with the task of doing. With this changed\r\npurpose goes a change of instruments. All over the world socialists are\r\nbreaking away from the stultifying influence of the outworn determinism.\r\nFor the time is at hand when they must cease to look upon socialism as\r\ninevitable in order to make it so.\r\n\r\nNor will the philosophy of class warfare serve this new need. That can be\r\neffective only so long as the working-class is without sovereignty. But\r\nno sooner has it achieved power than a new outlook is needed in order to\r\nknow what to do with it. The tactics of the battlefield are of no use\r\nwhen the battle is won.\r\n\r\nI picture this philosophy as one of deliberate choices. The underlying\r\ntone of it is that society is made by man for man's uses, that reforms\r\nare inventions to be applied when by experiment they show their\r\ncivilizing value. Emphasis is placed upon the devising, adapting,\r\nconstructing faculties. There is no reason to believe that this view is\r\nany colder than that of the war of class against class. It will generate\r\nno less energy. Men to-day can feel almost as much zest in the building\r\nof the Panama Canal as they did in a military victory. Their domineering\r\nimpulses find satisfaction in conquering things, in subjecting brute\r\nforces to human purposes. This sense of mastery in a winning battle\r\nagainst the conditions of our life is, I believe, the social myth that\r\nwill inspire our reconstructions. We shall feel free to choose among\r\nalternatives--to take this much of socialism, insert so much syndicalism,\r\nleave standing what of capitalism seems worth conserving. We shall be\r\nmaking our own house for our own needs, cities to suit ourselves, and we\r\nshall believe ourselves capable of moving mountains, as engineers do,\r\nwhen mountains stand in their way.\r\n\r\nAnd history, science, philosophy will support our hopes. What will\r\nfascinate us in the past will be the records of inventions, of great\r\nchoices, of those alternatives on which destiny seems to hang. The\r\nsplendid epochs will be interpreted as monuments of man's creation, not\r\nof his propulsion. We shall be interested primarily in the way nations\r\nestablished their civilization in spite of hostile conditions. Admiration\r\nwill go out to the men who did not submit, who bent things to human use.\r\nWe may see the entire tragedy of life in being driven.\r\n\r\nHalf-truths and illusions, if you like, but tonic. This view will suit\r\nour mood. For we shall be making and the makers of history will become\r\nmore real to us. Instead of urging that issues are inevitable, instead of\r\nbeing swamped by problems that are unavoidable, we may stand up and\r\naffirm the issues we propose to handle. Perhaps we shall say with\r\nNietzsche:\r\n\r\n     \"Let the value of everything be determined afresh by you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RED HERRING\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of every campaign the newspapers tell about secret\r\nconferences in which the candidate and his managers decide upon \"the line\r\nof attack.\" The approach to issues, the way in which they shall be\r\nstressed, what shall be put forward in one part of the country and what\r\nin another, are discussed at these meetings. Here is where the real\r\nprogram of a party is worked out. The document produced at the convention\r\nis at its best nothing but a suggestive formality. It is not until the\r\nspeakers and the publicity agents have actually begun to animate it that\r\nthe country sees what the party is about. It is as if the convention\r\nadopted the Decalogue, while these secret conferences decided which of\r\nthe Commandments was to be made the issue. Almost always, of course, the\r\ndecision is entirely a \"practical\" one, which means that each section of\r\npeople is exhorted to practice the commandment it likes the most. Thus\r\nfor the burglars is selected, not the eighth tablet, but the one on which\r\nis recommended a day of rest from labor; to the happily married is\r\npreached the seventh commandment.\r\n\r\nThese conferences are decisive. On them depends the educational value of\r\na campaign, and the men who participate in them, being in a position to\r\nstate the issues and point them, determine the political interests of the\r\npeople for a considerable period of time. To-day in America, for example,\r\nno candidate can escape entirely that underlying irritation which\r\nsocialists call poverty and some call the high cost of living. But the\r\nconspicuous candidates do decide what direction thought shall take about\r\nthis condition. They can center it upon the tariff or the trusts or even\r\nthe currency.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Roosevelt has always had a remarkable power of diverting the\r\ncountry from the tariff to the control of the trusts. His Democratic\r\nopponents, especially Woodrow Wilson, are, as I write, in the midst of\r\nthe Presidential campaign of 1912, trying to focus attention on the\r\ntariff. In a way the battle resembles a tug-of-war in which each of the\r\ntwo leading candidates is trying to pull the nation over to his favorite\r\nissue. On the side you can see the Prohibitionists endeavoring to make\r\nthe country see drink as a central problem; the emerging socialists\r\ninsisting that not the tariff, or liquor, or the control of trusts, but\r\nthe ownership of capital should be the heart of the discussion. Electoral\r\ncampaigns do not resemble debates so much as they do competing amusement\r\nshows where, with bright lights, gaudy posters and persuasive, insistent\r\nvoices, each booth is trying to collect a crowd; The victory in a\r\ncampaign is far more likely to go to the most plausible diagnosis than to\r\nthe most convincing method of cure. Once a party can induce the country\r\nto see its issue as supreme the greater part of its task is done.\r\n\r\nThe clever choice of issues influences all politics from the petty\r\nmanoeuvers of a ward leader to the most brilliant creative\r\nstatesmanship. I remember an instance that happened at the beginning of\r\nthe first socialist administration in Schenectady: The officials had out\r\nof the goodness of their hearts suspended a city ordinance which forbade\r\ncoasting with bob-sleds on the hills of the city. A few days later one of\r\nthe sleds ran into a wagon and a little girl was killed. The opposition\r\npapers put the accident into scareheads with the result that public\r\nopinion became very bitter. It looked like a bad crisis at the very\r\nbeginning and the old ring politicians made the most of it. But they had\r\nreckoned without the political shrewdness of the socialists. For in the\r\nsecond day of excitement, the mayor made public a plan by which the main\r\nbusiness street of the town was to be lighted with high-power lamps and\r\nturned into a \"brilliant white way of Schenectady.\" The swiftness with\r\nwhich the papers displaced the gruesome details of the little girl's\r\ndeath by exultation over the business future of the city was a caution.\r\nPublic attention was shifted and a political crisis avoided. I tell this\r\nstory simply as a suggestive fact. The ethical considerations do not\r\nconcern us here.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing exceptional about the case. Whenever governments enter\r\nupon foreign invasions in order to avoid civil wars, the same trick is\r\npracticed. In the Southern States the race issue has been thrust forward\r\npersistently to prevent an economic alignment. Thus you hear from\r\nSoutherners that unless socialism gives up its demand for racial\r\nequality, the propaganda cannot go forward. How often in great strikes\r\nhave riots been started in order to prevent the public from listening to\r\nthe workers' demands! It is an old story--the red herring dragged across\r\nthe path in order to destroy the scent.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the evil results we have come to detest a conscious choice of\r\nissues, to feel that it smacks of sinister plotting. The vile practice of\r\nyellow newspapers and chauvinistic politicians is almost the only\r\nexperience of it we have. Religion, patriotism, race, and sex are the\r\nfavorite red herrings of foul political method--they are the most\r\nsuccessful because they explode so easily and flood the mind with those\r\nunconscious prejudices which make critical thinking difficult. Yet for\r\nall its abuse the deliberate choice of issues is one of the high\r\nselective arts of the statesman. In the debased form we know it there is\r\nlittle encouragement. But the devil is merely a fallen angel, and when\r\nGod lost Satan he lost one of his best lieutenants. It is always a pretty\r\ngood working rule that whatever is a great power of evil may become a\r\ngreat power for good. Certainly nothing so effective in the art of\r\npolitics can be left out of the equipment of the statesman.\r\n\r\nLooked at closely, the deliberate making of issues is very nearly the\r\ncore of the statesman's task. His greatest wisdom is required to select a\r\npolicy that will fertilize the public mind. He fails when the issue he\r\nsets is sterile; he is incompetent if the issue does not lead to the\r\nhuman center of a problem; whenever the statesman allows the voters to\r\ntrifle with taboos and by-products, to wander into blind alleys like \"16\r\nto 1,\" his leadership is a public calamity. The newspaper or politician\r\nwhich tries to make an issue out of a supposed \"prosperity\" or out of\r\nadmiration for the mere successes of our ancestors is doing its best to\r\nchoke off the creative energies in politics. All the stultification of\r\nthe stand-pat mind may be described as inability, and perhaps\r\nunwillingness, to nourish a fruitful choice of issues.\r\n\r\nThat choice is altogether too limited in America, anyway. Political\r\ndiscussion, whether reactionary or radical, is monotonously confined to\r\nvery few issues. It is as if social life were prevented from irrigating\r\npolitical thought. A subject like the tariff, for example, has absorbed\r\nan amount of attention which would justify an historian in calling it the\r\nincubus of American politics. Now the exaltation of one issue like that\r\nis obviously out of all proportion to its significance. A contributory\r\nfactor it certainly is, but the country's destiny is not bound up finally\r\nwith its solution. The everlasting reiterations about the tariff take up\r\naltogether too much time. To any government that was clear about values,\r\nthat saw all problems in their relation to human life, the tariff would\r\nbe an incident, a mechanical device and little else. High protectionist\r\nand free trader alike fall under the indictment--for a tariff wall is\r\nneither so high as heaven nor so broad as the earth. It may be necessary\r\nto have dykes on portions of the seashore; they may be superfluous\r\nelsewhere. But to concentrate nine-tenths of your attention on the\r\nsubject of dykes is to forget the civilization they are supposed to\r\nprotect. A wall is a wall: the presence of it will not do the work of\r\ncivilization--the absence of it does not absolve anyone from the tasks of\r\nsocial life. That a statecraft might deal with the tariff as an aid to\r\nits purposes is evident. But anyone who makes the tariff the principal\r\nconcern of statecraft is, I believe, mistaking the hedge for the house.\r\n\r\nThe tariff controversy is almost as old as the nation. A more recent one\r\nis what Senator La Follette calls \"The great issue before the American\r\npeople to-day, ... the control of their own government.\" It has taken the\r\nform of an attack on corruption, on what is vaguely called \"special\r\nprivilege\" and of a demand for a certain amount of political machinery\r\nsuch as direct primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall. The\r\nagitation has a curious sterility: the people are exhorted to control\r\ntheir own government, but they are given very little advice as to what\r\nthey are to do with it when they control it. Of course, the leaders who\r\nspend so much time demanding these mechanical changes undoubtedly see\r\nthem as a safeguard against corrupt politicians and what Roosevelt calls\r\n\"their respectable allies and figureheads, who have ruled and legislated\r\nand decided as if in some way the vested rights of privilege had a first\r\nmortgage on the whole United States.\" But look at the _way_ these\r\ninnovations are presented and I think the feeling is unavoidable that the\r\ncontrol of government is emphasized as an end in itself. Now an\r\nobservation of this kind is immediately open to dispute: it is not a\r\nclear-cut distinction but a rather subtle matter of stress--an impression\r\nrather than a definite conviction.\r\n\r\nYet when you look at the career of Judge Lindsey in Denver the impression\r\nis sharpened by contrast. What gave his exposure of corruption a peculiar\r\nvitality was that it rested on a very positive human ideal: the happiness\r\nof children in a big city. Lindsey's attack on vice and financial jobbery\r\nwas perhaps the most convincing piece of muckraking ever done in this\r\ncountry for the very reason that it sprang from a concern about real\r\nhuman beings instead of abstractions about democracy or righteousness.\r\nFrom the point of view of the political hack, Judge Lindsey made a most\r\ndistressing use of the red herring. He brought the happiness of childhood\r\ninto political discussion, and this opened up a new source of political\r\npower. By touching something deeply instinctive in millions of people,\r\nJudge Lindsey animated dull proposals with human interest. The\r\npettifogging objections to some social plan had very little chance of\r\nsurvival owing to the dynamic power of the reformers. It was an excellent\r\nexample of the creative results that come from centering a political\r\nproblem on human nature.\r\n\r\nIf you move only from legality to legality, you halt and hesitate, each\r\nstep is a monstrous task. If the reformer is a pure opportunist, and lays\r\nout only \"the next step,\" that step will be very difficult. But if he\r\naims at some real human end, at the genuine concerns of men, women, and\r\nchildren, if he can make the democracy see and feel that end, the little\r\nmechanical devices of suffrage and primaries and tariffs will be dealt\r\nwith as a craftsman deals with his tools. But to say that we must make\r\ntools first, and then begin, is to invert the process of life. Men did\r\nnot agree to refrain from travel until a railroad was built. To make the\r\nmanufacture of instruments an ideal is to lose much of their ideal value.\r\nA nation bent upon a policy of social invention would make its tools an\r\nincident. But just this perception is lacking in many propagandists. That\r\nis why their issues are so sterile; that is why the absorption in \"next\r\nsteps\" is a diversion from statesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe narrowness of American political issues is a fixation upon\r\ninstruments. Tradition has centered upon the tariff, the trusts, the\r\ncurrency, and electoral machinery as the items of consideration. It is\r\nthe failure to go behind them--to see them as the pale servants of a\r\nvivid social life--that keeps our politics in bondage to a few problems.\r\nIt is a common experience repeated in you and me. Once our profession\r\nbecomes all absorbing it hardens into pedantry. \"A human being,\" says\r\nWells, \"who is a philosopher in the first place, a teacher in the first\r\nplace, or a statesman in the first place is thereby and inevitably,\r\nthough he bring God-like gifts to the pretense--a quack.\"\r\n\r\nReformers particularly resent the enlargement of political issues. I have\r\nheard socialists denounce other socialists for occupying themselves with\r\nthe problems of sex. The claim was that these questions should be put\r\naside so as not to disturb the immediate program. The socialists knew\r\nfrom experience that sex views cut across economic ones--that a new\r\ninterest breaks up the alignment. Woodrow Wilson expressed this same fear\r\nin his views on the liquor question: after declaring for local option he\r\nwent on to say that \"the questions involved are social and moral and are\r\nnot susceptible of being made part of a party program. Whenever they have\r\nbeen made the subject matter of party contests they have cut the lines of\r\nparty organization and party action athwart, to the utter confusion of\r\npolitical action in every other field.... I do not believe party programs\r\nof the highest consequence to the political life of the State and of the\r\nnation ought to be thrust on one side and hopelessly embarrassed for long\r\nperiods together by making a political issue of a great question which is\r\nessentially non-political, non-partisan, moral and social in its nature.\"\r\n\r\nThat statement was issued at the beginning of a campaign in which Woodrow\r\nWilson was the nominee of a party that has always been closely associated\r\nwith the liquor interests. The bogey of the saloon had presented itself\r\nearly: it was very clear that an affirmative position by the candidate\r\nwas sure to alienate either the temperance or the \"liquor vote.\" No doubt\r\na sense of this dilemma is partly responsible for Wilson's earnest plea\r\nthat the question of liquor be left out of the campaign. He saw the\r\nconfusion and embarrassment he speaks of as an immediate danger. Like his\r\nviews on immigration and Chinese labor it was a red herring across his\r\npath. It would, if brought into prominence, cut the lines of party action\r\nathwart.\r\n\r\nHis theoretical grounds for ignoring the question in politics are very\r\ninteresting just because they are vitalized by this practical difficulty\r\nwhich he faced. Like all party men Woodrow Wilson had thrust upon him\r\nhere a danger that haunts every political program. The more issues a\r\nparty meets the less votes it is likely to poll. And for a very simple\r\nreason: you cannot keep the citizenship of a nation like this bound in\r\nits allegiance to two large parties unless you make the grounds of\r\nallegiance very simple and very obvious. If you are to hold five or six\r\nmillion voters enlisted under one emblem the less specific you are and\r\nthe fewer issues you raise the more probable it is that you can stop this\r\nhost from quarreling within the ranks.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this is a partial explanation of the bareness of American\r\npolitics. The two big parties have had to preserve a superficial\r\nhomogeneity; and a platitude is more potent than an issue. The minor\r\nparties--Populist, Prohibition, Independence League and Socialist--have\r\nshown a much greater willingness to face new problems. Their view of\r\nnational policy has always been more inclusive, perhaps for the very\r\nreason that their membership is so much more exclusive. But if anyone\r\nwishes a smashing illustration of this paradox let him consider the rapid\r\nprogress of Roosevelt's philosophy in the very short time between the\r\nRepublican Convention in June to the Progressive Convention in August,\r\n1912. As soon as Roosevelt had thrown off the burden of preserving a\r\nfalse harmony among irreconcilable Republicans, he issued a platform full\r\nof definiteness and square dealing with many issues. He was talking to a\r\nminority party. But Roosevelt's genius is not that of group leadership.\r\nHe longs for majorities. He set out to make the campaign a battle between\r\nthe Progressives and the Democrats--the old discredited Republicans fell\r\nback into a rather dead conservative minority. No sooner did Roosevelt\r\ntake the stump than the paradox loomed up before him. His speeches began\r\nto turn on platitudes--on the vague idealism and indisputable moralities\r\nof the Decalogue and the Sermon on the Mount. The fearlessness of the\r\nChicago confession was melted down into a featureless alloy.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment from the liquor question which Woodrow Wilson feared\r\ndoes not arise because teetotaler and drunkard both become intoxicated\r\nwhen they discuss the saloon. It would come just as much from a radical\r\nprogram of land taxation, factory reform, or trust control. Let anyone of\r\nthese issues be injected into his campaign and the lines of party action\r\nwould be cut \"athwart.\" For Woodrow Wilson was dealing with the\r\ninevitable embarrassment of a party system dependent on an inexpressive\r\nhomogeneity. The grouping of the voters into two large herds costs a\r\nlarge price: it means that issues must be so simplified and selected that\r\nthe real demands of the nation rise only now and then to the level of\r\npolitical discussion. The more people a party contains the less it\r\nexpresses their needs.\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson's diagnosis of the red herring in politics is obviously\r\ncorrect. A new issue does embarrass a wholesale organization of the\r\nvoters. His desire to avoid it in the midst of a campaign is\r\nunderstandable. His urgent plea that the liquor question be kept a local\r\nissue may be wise. But the general philosophy which says that the party\r\nsystem should not be cut athwart is at least open to serious dispute.\r\nInstead of an evil, it looks to me like progress towards greater\r\nresponsiveness of parties to popular need. It is good to disturb\r\nalignments: to break up a superficial unanimity. The masses of people\r\nheld together under the name Democratic are bound in an enervating\r\ncommunion. The real groups dare not speak their convictions for fear the\r\ncrust will break. It is as if you had thrown a large sheet over a mass of\r\nmen and made them anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe man who raises new issues has always been distasteful to politicians.\r\nHe musses up what had been so tidily arranged. I remember once speaking\r\nto a local boss about woman suffrage. His objections were very simple:\r\n\"We've got the organization in fine shape now--we know where every voter\r\nin the district stands. But you let all the women vote and we'll be\r\nconfused as the devil. It'll be an awful job keeping track of them.\" He\r\nfelt what many a manufacturer feels when somebody has the impertinence to\r\ninvent a process which disturbs the routine of business.\r\n\r\nHard as it is upon the immediate plans of the politician, it is a\r\nnational blessing when the lines of party action are cut athwart by new\r\nissues. I recognize that the red herring is more often frivolous and\r\npersonal--a matter of misrepresentation and spite--than an honest attempt\r\nto enlarge the scope of politics. However, a fine thing must not be\r\ndeplored because it is open to vicious caricature. To the party worker\r\nthe petty and the honest issue are equally disturbing. The break-up of\r\nthe parties into expressive groups would be a ventilation of our national\r\nlife. No use to cry peace when there is no peace. The false bonds are\r\nbest broken: with their collapse would come a release of social energy\r\ninto political discussion. For every country is a mass of minorities\r\nwhich should find a voice in public affairs. Any device like proportional\r\nrepresentation and preferential voting which facilitates the political\r\nexpression of group interests is worth having. The objection that popular\r\ngovernment cannot be conducted without the two party system is, I\r\nbelieve, refuted by the experience of Europe. If I had to choose between\r\na Congressional caucus and a coalition ministry, I should not have to\r\nhesitate very long. But no one need go abroad for actual experience: in\r\nthe United States Senate during the Taft administration there were really\r\nthree parties--Republicans, Insurgents and Democrats. Public business\r\nwent ahead with at least as much effectiveness as under the old Aldrich\r\nring.\r\n\r\nThere are deeper reasons for urging a break-up of herd-politics. It is\r\nnot only desirable that groups should be able to contribute to public\r\ndiscussion: it is absolutely essential if the parliamentary method is not\r\nto be superseded by direct and violent action. The two party system\r\nchokes off the cry of a minority--perhaps the best way there is of\r\nprecipitating an explosion. An Englishman once told me that the utter\r\nfreedom of speech in Hyde Park was the best safeguard England had against\r\nthe doctrines that were propounded there. An anarchist who was invited to\r\naddress Congress would be a mild person compared to the man forbidden to\r\nspeak in the streets of San Diego. For many a bomb has exploded into\r\nrhetoric.\r\n\r\nThe rigidity of the two-party system is, I believe, disastrous: it\r\nignores issues without settling them, dulls and wastes the energies of\r\nactive groups, and chokes off the protests which should find a civilized\r\nexpression in public life. A recognition of what an incubus it is should\r\nmake us hospitable to all those devices which aim at making politics\r\nresponsive by disturbing the alignments of habit. The initiative and\r\nreferendum will help: they are a method of voting on definite issues\r\ninstead of electing an administration in bulk. If cleverly handled these\r\nelectoral devices should act as a check on a wholesale attitude toward\r\npolitics. Men could agree on a candidate and disagree on a measure.\r\nAnother device is the separation of municipal, state and national\r\nelections: to hold them all at the same time is an inducement to prevent\r\nthe voter from splitting his allegiance. Proportional representation and\r\npreferential voting I have mentioned. The short ballot is a psychological\r\nprinciple which must be taken into account wherever there is voting: it\r\nwill help the differentiation of political groups by concentrating the\r\nattention on essential choices. The recall of public officials is in part\r\na policeman's club, in part a clumsy way of getting around the American\r\nprejudice for a fixed term of office. That rigidity which by the mere\r\nmovement of the calendar throws an official out of office in the midst of\r\nhis work or compels him to go campaigning is merely the crude method of a\r\ndemocracy without confidence in itself. The recall is a half-hearted and\r\nnegative way of dealing with this difficulty. It does enable us to rid\r\nourselves of an officer we don't like instead of having to wait until the\r\nearth has revolved to a certain place about the sun. But we still have to\r\nvote on a fixed date whether we have anything to vote upon or not. If a\r\nrecall election is held when the people petition for it, why not all\r\nelections?\r\n\r\nIn ways like these we shall go on inventing methods by which the\r\nfictitious party alignments can be dissolved. There is one device\r\nsuggested now and then, tried, I believe, in a few places, and vaguely\r\nchampioned by some socialists. It is called in German an\r\n\"Interessenvertrag\"--a political representation by trade interests as\r\nwell as by geographical districts. Perhaps this is the direction towards\r\nwhich the bi-cameral legislature will develop. One chamber would then\r\nrepresent a man's sectional interests as a consumer: the other his\r\nprofessional interests as a producer. The railway workers, the miners,\r\nthe doctors, the teachers, the retail merchants would have direct\r\nrepresentation in the \"Interessenvertrag.\" You might call it a Chamber of\r\nSpecial Interests. I know how that phrase \"Special Interests\" hurts. In\r\npopular usage we apply it only to corrupting businesses. But our feeling\r\nagainst them should not blind us to the fact that every group in the\r\ncommunity has its special interests. They will always exist until mankind\r\nbecomes a homogeneous jelly. The problem is to find some social\r\nadjustment for all the special interests of a nation. That is best\r\nachieved by open recognition and clear representation. Let no one then\r\nconfuse the \"Interessenvertrag\" with those existing legislatures which\r\nare secret Chambers of Special Privilege.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is worth looking at for it does do away with the present\r\ndilemma of the citizen in which he wonders helplessly whether he ought to\r\nvote as a consumer or as a producer. I believe he should have both votes,\r\nand the \"Interessenvertrag\" is a way.\r\n\r\nThese devices are mentioned here as illustrations and not as conclusions.\r\nYou can think of them as arrangements by which the red herring is turned\r\nfrom a pest into a benefit. I grant that in the rigid political\r\nconditions prevailing to-day a new issue is an embarrassment, perhaps a\r\nhindrance to the procedure of political life. But instead of narrowing\r\nthe scope of politics, to avoid it, the only sensible thing to do is to\r\ninvent methods which will allow needs and problems and group interests\r\navenues into politics.\r\n\r\nBut a suggestion like this is sure to be met with the argument which\r\nWoodrow Wilson has in mind when he says that the \"questions involved are\r\nsocial and moral and are not susceptible of being made parts of a party\r\nprogram.\" He voices a common belief when he insists that there are moral\r\nand social problems, \"essentially non-political.\" Innocent as it looks at\r\nfirst sight this plea by Woodrow Wilson is weighted with the tradition of\r\na century and a half. To my mind it symbolizes a view of the state which\r\nwe are outgrowing, and throws into relief the view towards which we are\r\nstruggling. Its implications are well worth tracing, for through them I\r\nthink we can come to understand better the method of Twentieth Century\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that that government is best which governs least. It\r\nis equally true that that government is best which provides most. The\r\nfirst truth belongs to the Eighteenth Century: the second to the\r\nTwentieth. Neither of them can be neglected in our attitude towards the\r\nstate. Without the Jeffersonian distrust of the police we might easily\r\ngrow into an impertinent and tyrannous collectivism: without a vivid\r\nsense of the possibilities of the state we abandon the supreme instrument\r\nof civilization. The two theories need to be held together, yet clearly\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nGovernment has been an exalted policeman: it was there to guard property\r\nand to prevent us from quarreling too violently. That was about all it\r\nwas good for. Yet society found problems on its hands--problems which\r\nWoodrow Wilson calls moral and social in their nature. Vice and crime,\r\ndisease, and grinding poverty forced themselves on the attention of the\r\ncommunity. A typical example is the way the social evil compelled the\r\ncity of Chicago to begin an investigation. Yet when government was asked\r\nto handle the question it had for wisdom an ancient conception of itself\r\nas a policeman. Its only method was to forbid, to prosecute, to jail--in\r\nshort, to use the taboo. But experience has shown that the taboo will not\r\nsolve \"moral and social questions\"--that nine times out of ten it\r\naggravates the disease. Political action becomes a petty, futile, mean\r\nlittle intrusion when its only method is prosecution.\r\n\r\nNo wonder then that conservatively-minded men pray that moral and social\r\nquestions be kept out of politics; no wonder that more daring souls begin\r\nto hate the whole idea of government and take to anarchism. So long as\r\nthe state is conceived merely as an agent of repression, the less it\r\ninterferes with our lives, the better. Much of the horror of socialism\r\ncomes from a belief that by increasing the functions of government its\r\nregulating power over our daily lives will grow into a tyranny. I share\r\nthis horror when certain socialists begin to propound their schemes.\r\nThere is a dreadful amount of forcible scrubbing and arranging and\r\npocketing implied in some socialisms. There is a wish to have the state\r\nuse its position as general employer to become a censor of morals and\r\narbiter of elegance, like the benevolent employers of the day who take an\r\nimpertinent interest in the private lives of their workers. Without any\r\ndoubt socialism has within it the germs of that great bureaucratic\r\ntyranny which Chesterton and Belloc have named the Servile State.\r\n\r\nSo it is a wise instinct that makes men jealous of the policeman's power.\r\nFar better we may say that moral and social problems be left to private\r\nsolution than that they be subjected to the clumsy method of the taboo.\r\nWhen Woodrow Wilson argues that social problems are not susceptible to\r\ntreatment in a party program, he must mean only one thing: that they\r\ncannot be handled by the state as he conceives it. He is right. His\r\nattitude is far better than that of the Vice Commission: it too had only\r\na policeman's view of government, but it proceeded to apply it to\r\nproblems that are not susceptible to such treatment. Wilson, at least,\r\nknows the limitations of his philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut once you see the state as a provider of civilizing opportunities, his\r\nwhole objection collapses. As soon as government begins to supply\r\nservices, it is turning away from the sterile tyranny of the taboo. The\r\nprovision of schools, streets, plumbing, highways, libraries, parks,\r\nuniversities, medical attention, post-offices, a Panama Canal,\r\nagricultural information, fire protection--is a use of government totally\r\ndifferent from the ideal of Jefferson. To furnish these opportunities is\r\nto add to the resources of life, and only a doctrinaire adherence to a\r\nmisunderstood ideal will raise any objection to them.\r\n\r\nWhen an anarchist says that the state must be abolished he does not mean\r\nwhat he says. What he wants to abolish is the repressive, not the\r\nproductive state. He cannot possibly object to being furnished with the\r\nopportunity of writing to his comrade three thousand miles away, of\r\ndrinking pure water, or taking a walk in the park. Of course when he\r\nfinds the post-office opening his mail, or a law saying that he must\r\ndrink nothing but water, he begins to object even to the services of the\r\ngovernment. But that is a confusion of thought, for these tyrannies are\r\nmerely intrusions of the eighteenth century upon the twentieth. The\r\npostmaster is still something of a policeman.\r\n\r\nOnce you realize that moral and social problems must be treated to fine\r\nopportunities, that the method of the future is to compete with the devil\r\nrather than to curse him; that the furnishing of civilized environments\r\nis the goal of statecraft, then there is no longer any reason for keeping\r\nsocial and moral questions out of politics. They are what politics must\r\ndeal with essentially, now that it has found a way. The policeman with\r\nhis taboo did make moral and social questions insusceptible to treatment\r\nin party platforms. He kept the issues of politics narrow and irrelevant,\r\nand just because these really interesting questions could not be handled,\r\npolitics was an over-advertised hubbub. But the vision of the new\r\nstatecraft in centering politics upon human interests becomes a creator\r\nof opportunities instead of a censor of morals, and deserves a fresh and\r\nheightened regard.\r\n\r\nThe party platform will grow ever more and more into a program of\r\nservices. In the past it has been an armory of platitudes or a forecast\r\nof punishments. It promised that it would stop this evil practice, drive\r\nout corruption here, and prosecute this-and-that offense. All that\r\nbelongs to a moribund tradition. Abuse and disuse characterize the older\r\nview of the state: guardian and censor it has been, provider but\r\ngrudgingly. The proclamations of so-called progressives that they will\r\njail financiers, or \"wage relentless warfare\" upon social evils, are\r\nsimply the reiterations of men who do not understand the uses of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nA political revolution is in progress: the state as policeman is giving\r\nplace to the state as producer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nREVOLUTION AND CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a legend of a peasant who lived near Paris through the whole\r\nNapoleonic era without ever having heard of the name of Bonaparte. A\r\nstory of that kind is enough to make a man hesitate before he indulges in\r\na flamboyant description of social changes. That peasant is more than a\r\nsymbol of the privacy of human interest: he is a warning against the\r\nincurable romanticism which clings about the idea of a revolution.\r\nPopular history is deceptive if it is used to furnish a picture for\r\ncoming events. Like drama which compresses the tragedy of a lifetime into\r\na unity of time, place, and action, history foreshortens an epoch into an\r\nepisode. It gains in poignancy, but loses reality. Men grew from infancy\r\nto old age, their children's children had married and loved and worked\r\nwhile the social change we speak of as the industrial revolution was\r\nbeing consummated. That is why it is so difficult for living people to\r\nbelieve that they too are in the midst of great transformations. What\r\nlooks to us like an incredible rush of events sloping towards a great\r\nhistorical crisis was to our ancestors little else than the occasional\r\npunctuation of daily life with an exciting incident. Even to-day when we\r\nhave begun to speak of our age as a transition, there are millions of\r\npeople who live in an undisturbed routine. Even those of us who regard\r\nourselves as active in mothering the process and alert in detecting its\r\ngrowth are by no means constantly aware of any great change. For even the\r\nfondest mother cannot watch her child grow.\r\n\r\nI remember how tremendously surprised I was in visiting Russia several\r\nyears ago to find that in Moscow or St. Petersburg men were interested in\r\nall sorts of things besides the revolution. I had expected every Russian\r\nto be absorbed in the struggle. It seemed at first as if my notions of\r\nwhat a revolution ought to be were contradicted everywhere. And I assure\r\nyou it wrenched the imagination to see tidy nursemaids wheeling\r\nperambulators and children playing diavolo on the very square where\r\nBloody Sunday had gone into history. It takes a long perspective and no\r\nvery vivid acquaintance with revolution to be melodramatic about it. So\r\nmuch is left out of history and biography which would spoil the effect.\r\nThe anti-climax is almost always omitted.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is the reason why Arnold Bennett's description of the siege\r\nof Paris in \"The Old Wives' Tale\" is so disconcerting to many people. It\r\nis hard to believe that daily life continues with its stretches of\r\nboredom and its personal interests even while the enemy is bombarding a\r\ncity. How much more difficult is it to imagine a revolution that is to\r\ncome--to space it properly through a long period of time, to conceive\r\nwhat it will be like to the people who live through it. Almost all social\r\nprediction is catastrophic and absurdly simplified. Even those who talk\r\nof the slow \"evolution\" of society are likely to think of it as a series\r\nof definite changes easily marked and well known to everybody. It is what\r\nBernard Shaw calls the reformer's habit of mistaking his private emotions\r\nfor a public movement.\r\n\r\nEven though the next century is full of dramatic episodes--the collapse\r\nof governments and labor wars--these events will be to the social\r\nrevolution what the smashing of machines in Lancashire was to the\r\nindustrial revolution. The reality that is worthy of attention is a\r\nchange in the very texture and quality of millions of lives--a change\r\nthat will be vividly perceptible only in the retrospect of history.\r\n\r\nThe conservative often has a sharp sense of the complexity of revolution:\r\nnot desiring change, he prefers to emphasize its difficulties, whereas\r\nthe reformer is enticed into a faith that the intensity of desire is a\r\nmeasure of its social effect. Yet just because no reform is in itself a\r\nrevolution, we must not jump to the assurance that no revolution can be\r\naccomplished. True as it is that great changes are imperceptible, it is\r\nno less true that they are constantly taking place. Moreover, for the\r\nvery reason that human life changes its quality so slowly, the panic over\r\npolitical proposals is childish.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, for instance, that the recall of judges will not\r\nrevolutionize the national life. That is why the opposition generated\r\nwill seem superstitious to the next generation. As I write, a convention\r\nof the Populist Party has just taken place. Eight delegates attended the\r\nmeeting, which was held in a parlor. Even the reactionary press speaks in\r\na kindly way about these men. Twenty years ago the Populists were hated\r\nand feared as if they practiced black magic. What they wanted is on the\r\npoint of realization. To some of us it looks like a drop in the bucket--a\r\nslight part of vastly greater plans. But how stupid was the fear of\r\nPopulism, what unimaginative nonsense it was to suppose twenty years ago\r\nthat the program was the road to the end of the world.\r\n\r\nOne good deed or one bad one is no measure of a man's character: the Last\r\nJudgment let us hope will be no series of decisions as simple as that.\r\n\"The soul survives its adventures,\" says Chesterton with a splendid sense\r\nof justice. A country survives its legislation. That truth should not\r\ncomfort the conservative nor depress the radical. For it means that\r\npublic policy can enlarge its scope and increase its audacity, can try\r\nbig experiments without trembling too much over the result. This nation\r\ncould enter upon the most radical experiments and could afford to fail in\r\nthem. Mistakes do not affect us so deeply as we imagine. Our prophecies\r\nof change are subjective wishes or fears that never come to full\r\nrealization.\r\n\r\nThose socialists are confused who think that a new era can begin by a\r\ngeneral strike or an electoral victory. Their critics are just a bit more\r\nconfused when they become hysterical over the prospect. Both of them\r\nover-emphasize the importance of single events. Yet I do not wish to\r\nfurnish the impression that crises are negligible. They are extremely\r\nimportant as symptoms, as milestones, and as instruments. It is simply\r\nthat the reality of a revolution is not in a political decree or the\r\nscarehead of a newspaper, but in the experiences, feelings, habits of\r\nmyriads of men.\r\n\r\nNo one who watched the textile strike at Lawrence, Massachusetts, in the\r\nwinter of 1912 can forget the astounding effect it had on the complacency\r\nof the public. Very little was revealed that any well-informed social\r\nworker does not know as a commonplace about the mill population. The\r\nwretchedness and brutality of Lawrence conditions had been described in\r\nbooks and magazines and speeches until radicals had begun to wonder at\r\ntimes whether the power of language wasn't exhausted. The response was\r\ndiscouragingly weak--an occasional government investigation, an\r\nimpassioned protest from a few individuals, a placid charity, were about\r\nall that the middle-class public had to say about factory life. The\r\ncynical indifference of legislatures and the hypocrisy of the dominant\r\nparties were all that politics had to offer. The Lawrence strike touched\r\nthe most impervious: story after story came to our ears of hardened\r\nreporters who suddenly refused to misrepresent the strikers, of\r\npoliticians aroused to action, of social workers become revolutionary.\r\nDaily conversation was shocked into some contact with realities--the\r\nnewspapers actually printed facts about the situation of a working class\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nAnd why? The reason is not far to seek. The Lawrence strikers did\r\nsomething more than insist upon their wrongs; they showed a disposition\r\nto right them. That is what scared public opinion into some kind of\r\ntruth-telling. So long as the poor are docile in their poverty, the rest\r\nof us are only too willing to satisfy our consciences by pitying them.\r\nBut when the downtrodden gather into a threat as they did at Lawrence,\r\nwhen they show that they have no stake in civilization and consequently\r\nno respect for its institutions, when the object of pity becomes the\r\navenger of its own miseries, then the middle-class public begins to look\r\nat the problem more intelligently.\r\n\r\nWe are not civilized enough to meet an issue before it becomes acute. We\r\nwere not intelligent enough to free the slaves peacefully--we are not\r\nintelligent enough to-day to meet the industrial problem before it\r\ndevelops a crisis. That is the hard truth of the matter. And that is why\r\nno honest student of politics can plead that social movements should\r\nconfine themselves to argument and debate, abandoning the militancy of\r\nthe strike, the insurrection, the strategy of social conflict.\r\n\r\nThose who deplore the use of force in the labor struggle should ask\r\nthemselves whether the ruling classes of a country could be depended upon\r\nto inaugurate a program of reconstruction which would abolish the\r\nbarbarism that prevails in industry. Does anyone seriously believe that\r\nthe business leaders, the makers of opinion and the politicians will, on\r\ntheir own initiative, bring social questions to a solution? If they do it\r\nwill be for the first time in history. The trivial plans they are\r\nintroducing to-day--profit-sharing and welfare work--are on their own\r\nadmission an attempt to quiet the unrest and ward off the menace of\r\nsocialism.\r\n\r\nNo, paternalism is not dependable, granting that it is desirable. It will\r\ndo very little more than it feels compelled to do. Those who to-day bear\r\nthe brunt of our evils dare not throw themselves upon the mercy of their\r\nmasters, not though there are bread and circuses as a reward. From the\r\ngroups upon whom the pressure is most direct must come the power to deal\r\nwith it. We are not all immediately interested in all problems: our\r\nattention wanders unless the people who are interested compel us to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nSocial movements are at once the symptoms and the instruments of\r\nprogress. Ignore them and statesmanship is irrelevant; fail to use them\r\nand it is weak. Often in the course of these essays I have quoted from H.\r\nG. Wells. I must do so again: \"Every party stands essentially for the\r\ninterests and mental usages of some definite class or group of classes in\r\nthe exciting community, and every party has its scientific minded and\r\nconstructive leading section, with well defined hinterlands formulating\r\nits social functions in a public spirited form, and its\r\nsuperficial-minded following confessing its meannesses and vanities and\r\nprejudices. No class will abolish itself, materially alter its way of\r\nliving, or drastically reconstruct itself, albeit no class is indisposed\r\nto co-operate in the unlimited socialization of any other class. In that\r\ncapacity for aggression upon other classes lies the essential driving\r\nforce of modern affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this can be tested in the socialist movement. There is a\r\nsection among the socialists which regards the class movement of labor as\r\na driving force in the socialization of industry. This group sees clearly\r\nthat without the threat of aggression no settlement of the issues is\r\npossible. Ordinarily such socialists say that the class struggle is a\r\nmovement which will end classes. They mean that the self-interest of\r\nlabor is identical with the interests of a community--that it is a kind\r\nof social selfishness. But there are other socialists who speak\r\nconstantly of \"working-class government\" and they mean just what they\r\nsay. It is their intention to have the community ruled in the interests\r\nof labor. Probe their minds to find out what they mean by labor and in\r\nall honesty you cannot escape the admission that they mean industrial\r\nlabor alone. These socialists think entirely in terms of the factory\r\npopulation of cities: the farmers, the small shop-keepers, the\r\nprofessional classes have only a perfunctory interest for them. I know\r\nthat no end of phrases could be adduced to show the inclusiveness of the\r\nword labor. But their intention is what I have tried to describe: they\r\nare thinking of government by a factory population.\r\n\r\nThey appeal to history for confirmation: have not all social changes,\r\nthey ask, meant the emergence of a new economic class until it dominated\r\nsociety? Did not the French Revolution mean the conquest of the feudal\r\nlandlord by the middle-class merchant? Why should not the Social\r\nRevolution mean the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie? That\r\nmay be true, but it is no reason for being bullied by it into a tame\r\nadmission that what has always been must always be. I see no reason for\r\nexalting the unconscious failures of other revolutions into deliberate\r\nmodels for the next one. Just because the capacity of aggression in the\r\nmiddle class ran away with things, and failed to fuse into any decent\r\nsocial ideal, is not ground for trying as earnestly as possible to repeat\r\nthe mistake.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of it all, it seems to me, is this: that class interests are\r\nthe driving forces which keep public life centered upon essentials. They\r\nbecome dangerous to a nation when it denies them, thwarts them and\r\nrepresses them so long that they burst out and become dominant. Then\r\nthere is no limit to their aggression until another class appears with\r\ncontrary interests. The situation might be compared to those hysterias in\r\nwhich a suppressed impulse flares up and rules the whole mental life.\r\n\r\nSocial life has nothing whatever to fear from group interests so long as\r\nit doesn't try to play the ostrich in regard to them. So the burden of\r\nnational crises is squarely upon the dominant classes who fight so\r\nfoolishly against the emergent ones. That is what precipitates violence,\r\nthat is what renders social co-operation impossible, that is what makes\r\ncatastrophes the method of change.\r\n\r\nThe wisest rulers see this. They know that the responsibility for\r\ninsurrections rests in the last analysis upon the unimaginative greed and\r\nendless stupidity of the dominant classes. There is something pathetic in\r\nthe blindness of powerful people when they face a social crisis. Fighting\r\nviciously every readjustment which a nation demands, they make their own\r\noverthrow inevitable. It is they who turn opposing interests into a class\r\nwar. Confronted with the deep insurgency of labor what do capitalists and\r\ntheir spokesmen do? They resist every demand, submit only after a\r\nstruggle, and prepare a condition of war to the death. When far-sighted\r\nmen appear in the ruling classes--men who recognize the need of a\r\ncivilized answer to this increasing restlessness, the rich and the\r\npowerful treat them to a scorn and a hatred that are incredibly bitter.\r\nThe hostility against men like Roosevelt, La Follette, Bryan,\r\nLloyd-George is enough to make an observer believe that the rich of\r\nto-day are as stupid as the nobles of France before the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Roosevelt never spoke more wisely or as a better\r\nfriend of civilization than the time when he said at New York City on\r\nMarch 20, 1912, that \"the woes of France for a century and a quarter have\r\nbeen due to the folly of her people in splitting into the two camps of\r\nunreasonable conservatism and unreasonable radicalism. Had\r\npre-Revolutionary France listened to men like Turgot and backed them up\r\nall would have gone well. But the beneficiaries of privilege, the Bourbon\r\nreactionaries, the short-sighted ultra-conservatives, turned down Turgot;\r\nand then found that instead of him they had obtained Robespierre. They\r\ngained twenty years' freedom from all restraint and reform at the cost of\r\nthe whirlwind of the red terror; and in their turn the unbridled\r\nextremists of the terror induced a blind reaction; and so, with\r\nconvulsion and oscillation from one extreme to another, with alterations\r\nof violent radicalism and violent Bourbonism, the French people went\r\nthrough misery to a shattered goal.\"\r\n\r\nProfound changes are not only necessary, but highly desirable. Even if\r\nthis country were comfortably well-off, healthy, prosperous, and\r\neducated, men would go on inventing and creating opportunities to amplify\r\nthe possibilities of life. These inventions would mean radical\r\ntransformations. For we are bent upon establishing more in this nation\r\nthan a minimum of comfort. A liberal people would welcome social\r\ninventions as gladly as we do mechanical ones. What it would fear is a\r\nhard-shell resistance to change which brings it about explosively.\r\n\r\nCatastrophes are disastrous to radical and conservative alike: they do\r\nnot preserve what was worth maintaining; they allow a deformed and often\r\nmonstrous perversion of the original plan. The emancipation of the slaves\r\nmight teach us the lesson that an explosion followed by reconstruction is\r\nsatisfactory to nobody.\r\n\r\nStatesmanship would go out to meet a crisis before it had become acute.\r\nThe thing it would emphatically not do is to dam up an insurgent current\r\nuntil it overflowed the countryside. Fight labor's demands to the last\r\nditch and there will come a time when it seizes the whole of power, makes\r\nitself sovereign, and takes what it used to ask. That is a poor way for a\r\nnation to proceed. For the insurgent become master is a fanatic from the\r\nstruggle, and as George Santayana says, he is only too likely to redouble\r\nhis effort after he has forgotten his aim.\r\n\r\nNobody need waste his time debating whether or not there are to be great\r\nchanges. That is settled for us whether we like it or not. What is worth\r\ndebating is the method by which change is to come about. Our choice, it\r\nseems to me, lies between a blind push and a deliberate leadership,\r\nbetween thwarting movements until they master us, and domesticating them\r\nuntil they are answered.\r\n\r\nWhen Roosevelt formed the Progressive Party on a platform of social\r\nreform he crystallized a deep unrest, brought it out of the cellars of\r\nresentment into the agora of political discussion. He performed the real\r\ntask of a leader--a task which has essentially two dimensions. By\r\nbecoming part of the dynamics of unrest he gathered a power of\r\neffectiveness: by formulating a program for insurgency he translated it\r\ninto terms of public service.\r\n\r\nWhat Roosevelt did at the middle-class level, the socialists have done at\r\nthe proletarian. The world has been slow to recognize the work of the\r\nSocialist Party in transmuting a dumb muttering into a civilized program.\r\nIt has found an intelligent outlet for forces that would otherwise be\r\npurely cataclysmic. The truth of this has been tested recently in the\r\nappearance of the \"direct actionists.\"\r\n\r\nThey are men who have lost faith in political socialism. Why? Because,\r\nlike all other groups, the socialists tend to become routineers, to slip\r\ninto an easy reiteration. The direct actionists are a warning to the\r\nSocialist Party that its tactics and its program are not adequate to\r\ndomesticating the deepest unrest of labor. Within that party, therefore,\r\na leadership is required which will ride the forces of \"syndicalism\" and\r\nuse them for a constructive purpose. The brilliant writer of the \"Notes\r\nof the Week\" in the English New Age has shown how this might be done. He\r\nhas fused the insight of the syndicalist with the plans of the\r\ncollectivists under the name of Guild Socialism.\r\n\r\nHis plan calls for co-management of industry by the state and the labor\r\nunion. It steers a course between exploitation by a bureaucracy in the\r\ninterests of the consumer--the socialist danger--and oppressive\r\nmonopolies by industrial unions--the syndicalist danger. I shall not\r\nattempt to argue here either for or against the scheme. My concern is\r\nwith method rather than with special pleadings. The Guild Socialism of\r\nthe \"New Age\" is merely an instance of statesmanlike dealing with a new\r\nsocial force. Instead of throwing up its hands in horror at one\r\nover-advertised tactical incident like sabotage, the \"New Age\" went\r\nstraight to the creative impulse of the syndicalist movement.\r\n\r\nEvery true craftsman, artist or professional man knows and sympathizes\r\nwith that impulse: you may call it a desire for self-direction in labor.\r\nThe deepest revolt implied in the term syndicalism is against the\r\nimpersonal, driven quality of modern industry--against the destruction of\r\nthat pride which alone distinguishes work from slavery. Some such impulse\r\nas that is what marks off syndicalism from the other revolts of labor.\r\nOur suspicion of the collectivist arrangement is aroused by the picture\r\nof a vast state machine so horribly well-regulated that human impulse is\r\nutterly subordinated. I believe too that the fighting qualities of\r\nsyndicalism are kept at the boiling point by a greater sense of outraged\r\nhuman dignity than can be found among mere socialists or unionists. The\r\nimagination is more vivid: the horror of capitalism is not alone in the\r\npoverty and suffering it entails, but in its ruthless denial of life to\r\nmillions of men. The most cruel of all denials is to deprive a human\r\nbeing of joyous activity. Syndicalism is shot through with the assertion\r\nthat an imposed drudgery is intolerable--that labor at a subsistence wage\r\nas a cog in a meaningless machine is no condition upon which to found\r\ncivilization. That is a new kind of revolt--more dangerous to capitalism\r\nthan the demand for higher wages. You can not treat the syndicalists like\r\ncattle because forsooth they have ceased to be cattle. \"The damned\r\nwantlessness of the poor,\" about which Oscar Wilde complained, the cry\r\nfor a little more fodder, gives way to an insistence upon the chance to\r\nbe interested in life.\r\n\r\nTo shut the door in the face of such a current of feeling because it is\r\noccasionally exasperated into violence would be as futile as locking up\r\nchildren because they get into mischief. The mind which rejects\r\nsyndicalism entirely because of the by-products of its despair has had\r\npearls cast before it in vain. I know that syndicalism means a revision\r\nof some of our plans--that it is an intrusion upon many a glib prejudice.\r\nBut a human impulse is more important than any existing theory. We must\r\nnot throw an unexpected guest out of the window because no place is set\r\nfor him at table. For we lose not only the charm of his company: he may\r\nin anger wreck the house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet the whole nation can't sit at one table: the politician will object\r\nthat all human interests can't be embodied in a party program. That is\r\ntrue, truer than most politicians would admit in public. No party can\r\nrepresent a whole nation, although, with the exception of the socialists,\r\nall of them pretend to do just that. The reason is very simple: a\r\nplatform is a list of performances that are possible within a few years.\r\nIt is concerned with more or less immediate proposals, and in a nation\r\nsplit up by class, sectional and racial interests, these proposals are\r\nsure to arouse hostility. No definite industrial and political platform,\r\nfor example, can satisfy rich and poor, black and white, Eastern creditor\r\nand Western farmer. A party that tried to answer every conflicting\r\ninterest would stand still because people were pulling in so many\r\ndifferent directions. It would arouse the anger of every group and the\r\napproval of its framers. It would have no dynamic power because the\r\nforces would neutralize each other.\r\n\r\nOne comprehensive party platform fusing every interest is impossible and\r\nundesirable. What is both possible and desirable is that every group\r\ninterest should be represented in public life--that it should have\r\nspokesmen and influence in public affairs. This is almost impossible\r\nto-day. Our blundering political system is pachydermic in its\r\nirresponsiveness. The methods of securing representation are unfit\r\ninstruments for any flexible use. But the United States is evidently not\r\nexceptional in this respect. England seems to suffer in the same way. In\r\nMay, 1912, the \"Daily Mail\" published a series of articles by H. G. Wells\r\non \"The Labour Unrest.\" Is he not describing almost any session of\r\nCongress when he says that \"to go into the House of Commons is to go\r\naside out of the general stream of the community's vitality into a corner\r\nwhere little is learnt and much is concocted, into a specialized Assembly\r\nwhich is at once inattentive to and monstrously influential in our\r\naffairs?\" Further on Wells remarks that \"this diminishing actuality of\r\nour political life is a matter of almost universal comment to-day.... In\r\nGreat Britain we do not have Elections any more; we have Rejections.\r\nWhat really happens at a general election is that the party\r\norganizations--obscure and secretive conclaves with entirely mysterious\r\nfunds--appoint about 1200 men to be our rulers, and all that we, we\r\nso-called self-governing people, are permitted to do is, in a muddled\r\nangry way, to strike off the names of about half these selected\r\ngentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nA cynic might say that the people can't go far wrong in politics because\r\nthey can't be very right. Our so-called representative system is\r\nunrepresentative in a deeper way than the reformers who talk about the\r\nmoney power imagine. It is empty and thin: a stifling of living currents\r\nin the interest of a mediocre regularity.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that politics were made responsive--suppose that the forces\r\nof the community found avenues of expression into public life. Would not\r\nour legislatures be cut up into antagonistic parties, would not the\r\nconflicts of the nation be concentrated into one heated hall? If you\r\nreally represented the country in its government, would you not get its\r\npartisanship in a quintessential form? After all group interests in the\r\nnation are diluted by space and time: the mere separation in cities and\r\ncountry prevents them from falling into the psychology of the crowd. But\r\nlet them all be represented in one room by men who are professionally\r\ninterested in their constituency's prejudices and what would you\r\naccomplish but a deepening of the cleavages? Would the session not become\r\nan interminable wrangle?\r\n\r\nNobody can answer these questions with any certainty. Most prophecies are\r\nsimply the masquerades of prejudice, and the people who love stability\r\nand prefer to let their own well-being alone will see in a sensitive\r\npolitical system little but an invitation to chaos. They will choose\r\nfacts to adorn their fears. History can be all things to all men: nothing\r\nis easier than to summon the Terror, the Commune, lynchings in the\r\nSouthern States, as witnesses to the excesses and hysterias of the mob.\r\nThose facts will prove the case conclusively to anyone who has already\r\nmade up his mind on the subject. Absolute democrats can also line up\r\ntheir witnesses: the conservatism of the Swiss, Wisconsin's successful\r\nexperiments, the patience and judgment of the Danes. Both sides are\r\nremarkably sure that the right is with them, whereas the only truth about\r\nwhich an observer can be entirely certain is that in some places and in\r\ncertain instances democracy is admittedly successful.\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute case one way or the other. It would be silly from\r\nthe experience we have to make a simple judgment about the value of\r\ndirect expression. You cannot lump such a mass of events together and\r\ncome to a single conclusion about them. It is a crude habit of mind that\r\nwould attempt it. You might as well talk abstractly about the goodness or\r\nbadness of this universe which contains happiness, pain, exhilaration and\r\nindifference in a thousand varying grades and quantities. There is no\r\nsuch thing as Democracy; there are a number of more or less democratic\r\nexperiments which are not subject to wholesale eulogy or condemnation.\r\n\r\nThe questions about the success of a truly representative system are\r\npseudo-questions. And for this reason: success is not due to the system;\r\nit does not flow from it automatically. The source of success is in the\r\npeople who use the system: as an instrument it may help or hinder them,\r\nbut they must operate it. Government is not a machine running on straight\r\ntracks to a desired goal. It is a human work which may be facilitated by\r\ngood tools.\r\n\r\nThat is why the achievements of the Swiss may mean nothing whatever when\r\nyou come to prophesy about the people of New York. Because Wisconsin has\r\nmade good use of the direct primary it does not follow that it will\r\nbenefit the Filipino. It always seems curious to watch the satisfaction\r\nof some reform magazines when China or Turkey or Persia imitates the\r\nconstitutional forms of Western democracies. Such enthusiasts postulate a\r\nuniformity of human ability which every fact of life contradicts.\r\n\r\nPresent-day reform lays a great emphasis upon instruments and very little\r\non the skilful use of them. It says that human nature is all right, that\r\nwhat is wrong is the \"system.\" Now the effect of this has been to\r\nconcentrate attention on institutions and to slight men. A small step\r\nfurther, institutions become an end in themselves. They may violate human\r\nnature as the taboo does. That does not disturb the interest in them very\r\nmuch, for by common consent reformers are to fix their minds upon the\r\n\"system.\"\r\n\r\nA machine should be run by men for human uses. The preoccupation with the\r\n\"system\" lays altogether too little stress on the men who operate it and\r\nthe men for whom it is run. It is as if you put all your effort into the\r\nworking of a plough and forgot the farmer and the consumer. I state the\r\ncase baldly and contradiction would be easy. The reformer might point to\r\nphrases like \"human welfare\" which appear in his writings. And yet the\r\npoint stands, I believe. The emphasis which directs his thinking bears\r\nmost heavily upon the mechanics of life--only perfunctorily upon the\r\nability of the men who are to use them.\r\n\r\nEven an able reformer like Mr. Frederic C. Howe does not escape entirely.\r\nA recent book is devoted to a glowing eulogy of \"Wisconsin, an Experiment\r\nin Democracy.\" In a concluding chapter Mr. Howe states the philosophy of\r\nthe experiment. \"What is the explanation of Wisconsin?\" he asks. \"Why has\r\nit been able to eliminate corruption, machine politics, and rid itself of\r\nthe boss? What is the cause of the efficiency, the thoroughness, the\r\ndesire to serve which animate the state? Why has Wisconsin succeeded\r\nwhere other states have uniformly failed? I think the explanation is\r\nsimple. It is also perfectly natural. It is traceable to democracy, to\r\nthe political freedom which had its beginning in the direct primary law,\r\nand which has been continuously strengthened by later laws\"; some pages\r\nlater, \"Wisconsin assumed that the trouble with our politics is not with\r\nour people, but with the machinery with which the people work.... It has\r\nestablished a line of vision as direct as possible between the people and\r\nthe expression of their will.\" The impression Mr. Howe evidently wishes\r\nto leave with his readers is that the success of the experiment is due to\r\nthe instruments rather than to the talent of the people of Wisconsin.\r\nThat would be a valuable and comforting assurance to propagandists, for\r\nit means that other states with the same instruments can achieve the same\r\nsuccess. But the conclusion seems to me utterly unfounded. The reasoning\r\nis perilously like that of the gifted lady amateur who expects to achieve\r\ngreatness by imitating the paint box and palette, oils and canvases of an\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nMr. Howe's own book undermines his conclusions. He begins with an account\r\nof La Follette--of a man with initiative and a constructive bent. The\r\nforces La Follette set in motion are commented upon. The work of Van Hise\r\nis shown. What Wisconsin had was leadership and a people that responded,\r\ninventors, and constructive minds. They forged the direct primary and the\r\nState University out of the impetus within themselves. No doubt they were\r\nfortunate in their choice of instruments. They made the expression of the\r\npeople's will direct, yet that will surely is the more primary thing. It\r\nmakes and uses representative systems: but you cannot reverse the\r\nprocess. A man can manufacture a plough and operate it, but no amount of\r\nploughs will create a man and endow him with skill.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of observers have pointed out that the Western States adopt\r\nreform legislation more quickly than the Eastern. Yet no one would\r\nseriously maintain that the West is more progressive because it has\r\nprogressive laws. The laws are a symptom and an aid but certainly not the\r\ncause. Constitutions do not make people; people make constitutions. So\r\nthe task of reform consists not in presenting a state with progressive\r\nlaws, but in getting the people to want them.\r\n\r\nThe practical difference is extraordinary. I insist upon it so much\r\nbecause the tendency of political discussion is to regard government as\r\nautomatic: a device that is sure to fail or sure to succeed. It is sure\r\nof nothing. Effort moves it, intelligence directs it; its fate is in\r\nhuman hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe politics I have urged in these chapters cannot be learned by rote.\r\nWhat can be taught by rule of thumb is the administration of precedents.\r\nThat is at once the easiest and the most fruitless form of public\r\nactivity. Only a low degree of intelligence is required and of effort\r\nmerely a persistent repetition. Men fall into a routine when they are\r\ntired and slack: it has all the appearance of activity with few of its\r\nburdens. It was a profound observation when Bernard Shaw said that men\r\ndread liberty because of the bewildering responsibility it imposes and\r\nthe uncommon alertness it demands. To do what has always been done, to\r\nthink in well-cut channels, to give up \"the intolerable disease of\r\nthought,\" is an almost constant demand of our natures. That is perhaps\r\nwhy so many of the romantic rebels of the Nineteenth Century sank at last\r\ninto the comforting arms of Mother Church. That is perhaps the reason why\r\nmost oldish men acquire information, but learn very little. The\r\nconservative who loves his routine is in nine cases out of ten a creature\r\ntoo lazy to change its habits.\r\n\r\nConfronted with a novelty, the first impulse is to snub it, and send it\r\ninto exile. When it becomes too persistent to be ignored a taboo is\r\nerected and threats of fines and condign punishment are made if it\r\ndoesn't cease to appear. This is the level of culture at which Sherman\r\nAnti-Trust acts are passed, brothels are raided, and labor agitators are\r\nthrown into jail. If the taboo is effective it drives the evil under\r\ncover, where it festers and emits a slow poison. This is the price we pay\r\nfor the appearance of suppression. But if the problem is more heavily\r\ncharged with power, the taboo irritates the force until it explodes. Not\r\ninfrequently what was once simply a factor of life becomes the dominating\r\npart of it. At this point the whole routineer scheme of things collapses,\r\nthere is a period of convulsion and Cæsarean births, and men weary of\r\nexcitement sink back into a newer routine. Thus the cycle of futility is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe process bears as much resemblance to statecraft as sitting backward\r\non a runaway horse does to horsemanship. The ordinary politician has no\r\nreal control, no direction, no insight into the power he rides. What he\r\nhas is an elevated, though temporary seat. Real statesmanship has a\r\ndifferent ambition. It begins by accepting human nature. No routine has\r\never done that in spite of the conservative patter about \"human nature\";\r\nmechanical politics has usually begun by ignoring and ended by violating\r\nthe nature of men.\r\n\r\nTo accept that nature does not mean that we accept its present character.\r\nIt is probably true that the impulses of men have changed very little\r\nwithin recorded history. What has changed enormously from epoch to epoch\r\nis the character in which these impulses appear. The impulses that at one\r\nperiod work themselves out into cruelty and lust may at another produce\r\nthe richest values of civilized life. The statesman can affect that\r\nchoice. His business is to provide fine opportunities for the expression\r\nof human impulses--to surround childhood, youth and age with homes and\r\nschools, cities and countryside that shall be stocked with interest and\r\nthe chance for generous activity.\r\n\r\nGovernment can play a leading part in this work, for with the decadence\r\nof the church it has become the only truly catholic organization in the\r\nland. Its task is essentially to carry out programs of service, to add\r\nand build and increase the facilities of life. Repression is an\r\ninsignificant part of its work; the use of the club can never be\r\napplauded, though it may be tolerated _faute de mieux_. Its use is a\r\nconfession of ignorance.\r\n\r\nA sensitively representative machinery will probably serve such\r\nstatesmanship best. For the easy expression of public opinion in\r\ngovernment is a clue to what services are needed and a test of their\r\nsuccess. It keeps the processes of politics well ventilated and reminds\r\npoliticians of their excuse for existence.\r\n\r\nIn that kind of statesmanship there will be a premium on inventiveness,\r\non the ingenuity to devise and plan. There will be much less use for\r\nlawyers and a great deal more for scientists. The work requires\r\nindustrial organizers, engineers, architects, educators, sanitists to\r\nachieve what leadership brings into the program of politics.\r\n\r\nThis leadership is the distinctive fact about politics. The statesman\r\nacts in part as an intermediary between the experts and his constituency.\r\nHe makes social movements conscious of themselves, expresses their needs,\r\ngathers their power and then thrusts them behind the inventor and the\r\ntechnician in the task of actual achievement. What Roosevelt did in the\r\nconservation movement was typical of the statesman's work. He recognized\r\nthe need of attention to natural resources, made it public, crystallized\r\nits force and delegated the technical accomplishment to Pinchot and his\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut creative statesmanship requires a culture to support it. It can\r\nneither be taught by rule nor produced out of a vacuum. A community that\r\nclatters along with its rusty habits of thought unquestioned, making no\r\ndistinction between instruments and idols, with a dull consumption of\r\nmachine-made romantic fiction, no criticism, an empty pulpit and an\r\nunreliable press, will find itself faithfully mirrored in public affairs.\r\nThe one thing that no democrat may assume is that the people are dear\r\ngood souls, fully competent for their task. The most valuable leaders\r\nnever assume that. No one, for example, would accuse Karl Marx of\r\ndisloyalty to workingmen. Yet in 1850 he could write at the demagogues\r\namong his friends: \"While we draw the attention of the German workman to\r\nthe _undeveloped state_ of the proletariat in Germany, you flatter the\r\nnational spirit and the guild prejudices of the German artisans in the\r\ngrossest manner, a method of procedure without doubt the more popular of\r\nthe two. Just as the democrats made a sort of fetich of the words, 'the\r\npeople,' so you make one of the word 'proletariat.'\" John Spargo quotes\r\nthis statement in his \"Life.\" Marx, we are told, could use phrases like\r\n\"democratic miasma.\" He never seems to have made the mistake of confusing\r\ndemocracy with demolatry. Spargo is perfectly clear about this\r\ncharacteristic of Marx: \"He admired most of all, perhaps, that fine\r\ndevotion to truth as he understood it, and disregard of popularity which\r\nmarked Owen's life. Contempt for popular opinion was one of his most\r\nstrongly developed characteristics. He was fond, says Liebknecht, of\r\nquoting as his motto the defiant line of Dante, with which he afterwards\r\nconcluded his preface to 'Das Kapital':\r\n\r\n'Segui il tuo corso e lascia dir le genti.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is to Marx's everlasting credit that he set the intellectual standard\r\nof socialism on the most vigorous intellectual basis he could find. He\r\nknew better than to be satisfied with loose thinking and fairly good\r\nintentions. He knew that the vast change he contemplated needed every\r\nounce of intellectual power that the world possessed. A fine boast it was\r\nthat socialism was equipped with all the culture of the age. I wonder\r\nwhat he would have thought of an enthusiastic socialist candidate for\r\nGovernor of New York who could write that \"until men are free the world\r\nhas no need of any more literary efforts, of any more paintings, of any\r\nmore poems. It is better to have said one word for the emancipation of\r\nthe race than to have written the greatest novel of the times.... The\r\nworld doesn't need any more literature.\"\r\n\r\nI will not venture a guess as to what Marx would have said, but I know\r\nwhat we must say: \"Without a literature the people is dumb, without\r\nnovels and poems, plays and criticism, without books of philosophy, there\r\nis neither the intelligence to plan, the imagination to conceive, nor the\r\nunderstanding of a common purpose. Without culture you can knock down\r\ngovernments, overturn property relations, you can create excitement, but\r\nyou cannot create a genuine revolution in the lives of men.\" The reply of\r\nthe workingmen in 1847 to Cabet's proposal that they found Icaria, \"a new\r\nterrestrial Paradise,\" in Texas if you please, contains this interesting\r\nobjection: \"Because although those comrades who intend to emigrate with\r\nCabet may be eager Communists, yet they still possess too many of the\r\nfaults and prejudices of present-day society by reason of their past\r\neducation to be able to get rid of them at once by joining Icaria.\"\r\n\r\nThat simple statement might be taken to heart by all the reformers and\r\nsocialists who insist that the people are all right, that only\r\ninstitutions are wrong. The politics of reconstruction require a nation\r\nvastly better educated, a nation freed from its slovenly ways of\r\nthinking, stimulated by wider interests, and jacked up constantly by the\r\nsharpest kind of criticism. It is puerile to say that institutions must\r\nbe changed from top to bottom and then assume that their victims are\r\nprepared to make the change. No amount of charters, direct primaries, or\r\nshort ballots make a democracy out of an illiterate people. Those\r\nportions of America where there are voting booths but no schools cannot\r\npossibly be described as democracies. Nor can the person who reads one\r\ncorrupt newspaper and then goes out to vote make any claim to having\r\nregistered his will. He may have a will, but he has not used it.\r\n\r\nFor politics whose only ideal is the routine, it is just as well that men\r\nshouldn't know what they want or how to express it. Education has always\r\nbeen a considerable nuisance to the conservative intellect. In the\r\nSouthern States, culture among the negroes is openly deplored, and I do\r\nnot blame any patriarch for dreading the education of women. It is out of\r\nculture that the substance of real revolutions is made. If by some magic\r\nforce you could grant women the vote and then keep them from schools and\r\ncolleges, newspapers and lectures, the suffrage would be no more\r\neffective than a Blue Law against kissing your wife on Sunday. It is\r\ndemocratic machinery with an educated citizenship behind it that embodies\r\nall the fears of the conservative and the hopes of the radical.\r\n\r\nCulture is the name for what people are interested in, their thoughts,\r\ntheir models, the books they read and the speeches they hear, their\r\ntable-talk, gossip, controversies, historical sense and scientific\r\ntraining, the values they appreciate, the quality of life they admire.\r\nAll communities have a culture. It is the climate of their civilization.\r\nWithout a favorable culture political schemes are a mere imposition. They\r\nwill not work without a people to work them.\r\n\r\nThe real preparation for a creative statesmanship lies deeper than\r\nparties and legislatures. It is the work of publicists and educators,\r\nscientists, preachers and artists. Through all the agents that make and\r\npopularize thought must come a bent of mind interested in invention and\r\nfreed from the authority of ideas. The democratic culture must, with\r\ncritical persistence, make man the measure of all things. I have tried\r\nagain and again to point out the iconoclasm that is constantly necessary\r\nto avoid the distraction that comes of idolizing our own methods of\r\nthought. Without an unrelaxing effort to center the mind upon human uses,\r\nhuman purposes, and human results, it drops into idolatry and becomes\r\nhostile to creation.\r\n\r\nThe democratic experiment is the only one that requires this wilful\r\nhumanistic culture. An absolutism like Russia's is served better when the\r\npeople accept their ideas as authoritative and piously sacrifice humanity\r\nto a non-human purpose. An aristocracy flourishes where the people find a\r\nvicarious enjoyment in admiring the successes of the ruling class. That\r\nprevents men from developing their own interests and looking for their\r\nown successes. No doubt Napoleon was well content with the philosophy of\r\nthose guardsmen who drank his health before he executed them.\r\n\r\nBut those excellent soldiers would make dismal citizens. A view of life\r\nin which man obediently allows himself to be made grist for somebody\r\nelse's mill is the poorest kind of preparation for the work of\r\nself-government. You cannot long deny external authorities in government\r\nand hold to them for the rest of life, and it is no accident that the\r\nnineteenth century questioned a great deal more than the sovereignty of\r\nkings. The revolt went deeper and democracy in politics was only an\r\naspect of it. The age might be compared to those years of a boy's life\r\nwhen he becomes an atheist and quarrels with his family. The nineteenth\r\ncentury was a bad time not only for kings, but for priests, the classics,\r\nparental autocrats, indissoluble marriage, Shakespeare, the Aristotelian\r\nPoetics and the validity of logic. If disobedience is man's original\r\nvirtue, as Oscar Wilde suggested, it was an extraordinarily virtuous\r\ncentury. Not a little of the revolt was an exuberant rebellion for its\r\nown sake. There were also counter-revolutions, deliberate returns to\r\northodoxy, as in the case of Chesterton. The transvaluation of values was\r\nperformed by many hands into all sorts of combinations.\r\n\r\nThere have been other periods of revolution. Heresy is just a few hours\r\nyounger than orthodoxy. Disobedience is certainly not the discovery of\r\nthe nineteenth century. But the quality of it is. I believe Chesterton\r\nhas hold of an essential truth when he says that this is the first time\r\nmen have boasted of their heresy. The older rebels claimed to be more\r\northodox than the Church, to have gone back to the true authorities. The\r\nradicals of recent times proclaim that there is no orthodoxy, no doctrine\r\nthat men must accept without question.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt they deceive themselves mightily. They have their invisible\r\npopes, called Art, Nature, Science, with regalia and ritual and a\r\ncatechism. But they don't mean to have them. They mean to be\r\nself-governing in their spiritual lives. And this intention is the\r\nhalf-perceived current which runs through our age and galvanizes so many\r\nqueer revolts. It would be interesting to trace out the forms it has\r\ntaken, the abortive cults it has tried and abandoned. In another\r\nconnection I pointed to autonomy as the hope of syndicalism. It would not\r\nbe difficult to find a similar assertion in the feminist agitation. From\r\nMrs. Gilman's profound objections against a \"man-made\" world to the lady\r\nwho would like to vote about her taxes, there is a feeling that woman\r\nmust be something more than a passive creature. Walter Pater might be\r\nquoted in his conclusion to the effect that \"the theory or idea or system\r\nwhich requires of us the sacrifice of any part of experience, in\r\nconsideration of some interest into which we cannot enter, or some\r\nabstract theory we have not identified with ourselves, or what is only\r\nconventional, has no real claim upon us.\" The desire for self-direction\r\nhas made a thousand philosophies as contradictory as the temperaments of\r\nthe thinkers. A storehouse of illustration is at hand: Nietzsche advising\r\nthe creative man to bite off the head of the serpent which is choking him\r\nand become \"a transfigured being, a light-surrounded being, that\r\n_laughed_!\" One might point to Stirner's absolute individualism or turn\r\nto Whitman's wholehearted acceptance of every man with his catalogue of\r\ndefects and virtues. Some of these men have cursed each other roundly:\r\nGeorges Sorel, for example, who urges workingmen to accept none of the\r\nbourgeois morality, and becomes most eloquent when he attacks other\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to suggest too much unanimity in the hundreds of artists\r\nand thinkers that are making the thought of our times. There is a kind of\r\n\"professional reconciler\" of opposites who likes to lump all the\r\nprominent rebels together and refer to them affectionately as \"us\r\nradicals.\" Yet that there is a common impulse in modern thought which\r\nstrives towards autonomy is true and worth remarking. In some men it is\r\nhalf-conscious, in others a minor influence, but almost no one of weight\r\nescapes the contagion of it entirely. It is a new culture that is being\r\nprepared. Without it there would to-day be no demand for a creative\r\nstatesmanship which turns its back upon the routine and the taboo, kings\r\nand idols, and non-human purposes. It does more. It is making the\r\natmosphere in which a humanly centered politics can flourish. The fact\r\nthat this culture is multiform and often contradictory is a sign that\r\nmore and more of the interests of life are finding expression. We should\r\nrejoice at that, for profusion means fertility; where a dead uniformity\r\nceases, invention and ingenuity flourish.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the insistence on the need of a culture in statecraft will seem\r\nto many people an old-fashioned delusion. Among the more rigid socialists\r\nand reformers it is not customary to spend much time discussing mental\r\nhabits. That, they think, was made unnecessary by the discovery of an\r\neconomic basis of civilization. The destinies of society are felt to be\r\ntoo solidly set in industrial conditions to allow any cultural direction.\r\nWhere there is no choice, of what importance is opinion?\r\n\r\nAll propaganda is, of course, a practical tribute to the value of\r\nculture. However inevitable the process may seem, all socialists agree\r\nthat its inevitability should be fully realized. They teach at one time\r\nthat men act from class interests: but they devote an enormous amount of\r\nenergy to making men conscious of their class. It evidently matters to\r\nthat supposedly inevitable progress whether men are aware of it. In\r\nshort, the most hardened socialist admits choice and deliberation,\r\nculture and ideals into his working faith. He may talk as if there were\r\nan iron determinism, but his practice is better than his preachment.\r\n\r\nYet there are necessities in social life. To all the purposes of politics\r\nit is settled, for instance, that the trust will never be \"unscrambled\"\r\ninto small competing businesses. We say in our argument that a return to\r\nthe days of the stage-coach is impossible or that \"you cannot turn back\r\nthe hands of the clock.\" Now man might return to the stage-coach if that\r\nseemed to him the supreme goal of all his effort, just as anyone can\r\nfollow Chesterton's advice to turn back the hands of the clock if he\r\npleases. But nobody can recover his yesterdays no matter how much he\r\nabuses the clock, and no man can expunge the memory of railroads though\r\nall the stations and engines were dismantled.\r\n\r\n\"From this survival of the past,\" says Bergson, \"it follows that\r\nconsciousness cannot go through the same state twice.\" This is the real\r\nnecessity that makes any return to the imagined glories of other days an\r\nidle dream. Graham Wallas remarks that those who have eaten of the tree\r\nof knowledge cannot forget--\"Mr. Chesterton cries out, like the Cyclops\r\nin the play, against those who complicate the life of man, and tells us\r\nto eat 'caviare on impulse,' instead of 'grapenuts on principle.' But\r\nsince we cannot unlearn our knowledge, Mr. Chesterton is only telling us\r\nto eat caviare on principle.\" The binding fact we must face in all our\r\ncalculations, and so in politics too, is that you cannot recover what is\r\npassed. That is why educated people are not to be pressed into the\r\ncustoms of their ignorance, why women who have reached out for more than\r\n\"Kirche, Kinder und Küche\" can never again be entirely domestic and\r\nprivate in their lives. Once people have questioned an authority their\r\nfaith has lost its naïveté. Once men have tasted inventions like the\r\ntrust they have learned something which cannot be annihilated. I know of\r\none reformer who devotes a good deal of his time to intimate talks with\r\npowerful conservatives. He explains them to themselves: never after do\r\nthey exercise their power with the same unquestioning ruthlessness.\r\n\r\nLife is an irreversible process and for that reason its future can never\r\nbe a repetition of the past. This insight we owe to Bergson. The\r\napplication of it to politics is not difficult because politics is one of\r\nthe interests of life. We can learn from him in what sense we are bound.\r\n\"The finished portrait is explained by the features of the model, by the\r\nnature of the artist, by colors spread out on the palette; but even with\r\nthe knowledge of what explains it, no one, not even the artist, could\r\nhave foreseen exactly what the portrait would be, for to predict it would\r\nhave been to produce it before it was produced....\" The future is\r\nexplained by the economic and social institutions which were present at\r\nits birth: the trust and the labor union, all the \"movements\" and\r\ninstitutions, will condition it. \"Just as the talent of the painter is\r\nformed or deformed--in any case, is modified--under the very influence of\r\nthe work he produces, so each of our states, at the moment of its issue,\r\nmodifies our personality, being indeed the new form we are just assuming.\r\nIt is then right to say that what we do depends on what we are; but it is\r\nnecessary to add also, that we are, to a certain extent, what we do, and\r\nthat we are creating ourselves continually.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I have called culture enters into political life as a very powerful\r\ncondition. It is a way of creating ourselves. Make a blind struggle\r\nluminous, drag an unconscious impulse into the open day, see that men are\r\naware of their necessities, and the future is in a measure controlled.\r\nThe culture of to-day is for the future an historical condition. That is\r\nits political importance. The mental habits we are forming, our\r\nphilosophies and magazines, theaters, debates, schools, pulpits and\r\nnewspapers become part of an active past which as Bergson says \"follows\r\nus at every instant; all that we have felt, thought, and willed from our\r\nearliest infancy is there, leaning over the present which is about to\r\njoin it, pressing against the portals of consciousness that would fain\r\nleave it outside.\"\r\n\r\nSocialists claim that because the McNamara brothers had no\r\n\"class-consciousness,\" because they were without a philosophy of society\r\nand an understanding of the labor movement their sense of wrong was bound\r\nto seek out dynamite. That is a profound truth backed by abundant\r\nevidence. If you turn, for example, to Spargo's Life of Karl Marx you see\r\nthat all through his career Marx struggled with the mere\r\ninsurrectionists. It was the men without the Marxian vision of growth and\r\ndiscipline who were forever trying to lead little marauding bands against\r\nthe governments of Europe. The fact is worth pondering: the Marxian\r\nsocialists, openly declaring that all authority is a temporary\r\nmanifestation of social conditions, have waged what we must call a war of\r\nculture against the powers of the world. They have tried to arouse in\r\nworkingmen the consciousness of an historical mission--the patience of\r\nthat labor is one of the wonders of the age. But the McNamaras had a\r\nculture that could help them not at all. They were Catholics, Democrats\r\nand old-fashioned trade-unionists. Religion told them that authority was\r\nabsolute and eternal, politics that Jefferson had said about all there\r\nwas to say, economics insisted that the struggle between labor and\r\ncapital was an everlasting see-saw. But life told them that society was\r\nbrutal: an episode like the shirtwaist factory fire drove them to\r\nblasphemy and dynamite.\r\n\r\nThose bombs at Los Angeles, assassination and terrorism, are compounded\r\nof courage, indignation and ignorance. Civilization has much to fear from\r\nthe blind class antagonisms it fosters; but the preaching of \"class\r\nconsciousness,\" far from being a fomenter of violence, must be recognized\r\nas the civilizing influence of culture upon economic interests.\r\n\r\nThoughts and feelings count. We live in a revolutionary period and\r\nnothing is so important as to be aware of it. The measure of our\r\nself-consciousness will more or less determine whether we are to be the\r\nvictims or the masters of change. Without philosophy we stumble along.\r\nThe old routines and the old taboos are breaking up anyway, social forces\r\nare emerging which seek autonomy and struggle against slavery to\r\nnon-human purposes. We seem to be moving towards some such statecraft as\r\nI have tried to suggest. But without knowledge of it that progress will\r\nbe checkered and perhaps futile. The dynamics for a splendid human\r\ncivilization are all about us. They need to be used. For that there must\r\nbe a culture practiced in seeking the inwardness of impulses, competent\r\nto ward off the idols of its own thought, hospitable to novelty and\r\nsufficiently inventive to harness power.\r\n\r\nWhy this age should have come to be what it is, why at this particular\r\ntime the whole drift of thought should be from authority to autonomy\r\nwould be an interesting speculation. It is one of the ultimate questions\r\nof politics. It is like asking why Athens in the Fifth Century B. C. was\r\nsingled out as the luminous point of the Western World. We do not know\r\nenough to cut under such mysteries. We can only begin to guess why there\r\nwas a Renaissance, why in certain centuries man seems extraordinarily\r\ncreative. Perhaps the Modern Period with its flexibility, sense of\r\nchange, and desire for self-direction is a liberation due to the great\r\nsurplus of wealth. Perhaps the ease of travel, the popularizing of\r\nknowledge, the break-down of frontiers have given us a new interest in\r\nhuman life by showing how temporary are all its instruments. Certainly\r\nplacid or morose acceptance is undermined. If men remain slaves either to\r\nideas or to other men, it will be because they do not know they are\r\nslaves. Their intention is to be free. Their desire is for a full and\r\nexpressive life and they do not relish a lop-sided and lamed humanity.\r\nFor the age is rich with varied and generous passions.",
