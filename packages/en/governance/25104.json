There is, however, no work, so far as I am\r\ninformed, in any country, which treats of Marine Steam Navigation in\r\nits commercial, political, economic, social, and diplomatic bearings,\r\nor discusses so far the theory and practice of navigation as to\r\ndevelop the cost and difficulties attending high speed on the ocean,\r\nor the large expense incurred in a rapid, regular, and reliable\r\ntransport of the foreign mails.\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly suggested to the undersigned by members of\r\nCongress, and particularly by some of the members of the committees on\r\nthe Post Office and Post Roads in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, that there was no reliable statement, such as that\r\nwhich I have endeavored to furnish, on the general topics connected\r\nwith trans-marine steam navigation, to which those not specially\r\ninformed on the subject, could refer for the settlement of the many\r\ndisputed points brought before Congress and the Departments. It is\r\nrepresented that there are many conflicting statements regarding the\r\ncapabilities of ocean steam; the cost of running vessels; the\r\nconsumption of fuel; the extent and costliness of repairs; the\r\ndepreciation of vessels; the cost of navigating them; the attendant\r\nincidental expenses; the influence of ocean mails in promoting trade;\r\nthe wants of commercial communities; the adaptation of the mail\r\nvessels to the war service; the rights of private enterprise; and the\r\nability of ocean steamers generally to support themselves on their own\r\nreceipts.\r\n\r\nWhile this is true, there is no work on this general subject to which\r\npersons can refer for the authoritative settlement of any of these\r\npoints, either absolutely or proximately; and while a simple statement\r\nof facts, acknowledged by all steamship-men, may tend to dispel much\r\nmisapprehension on this interesting subject, it will also be not\r\nunprofitable, I trust, to review some of the prominent arguments on\r\nwhich the mail steamship system is based. That system should stand or\r\nfall on its own merits or demerits alone; and to be permanent, it must\r\nbe based on the necessities of the community, and find its support in\r\nthe common confidence of all classes. I have long considered a wise,\r\nliberal, and extended steam mail system vitally essential to the\r\ncommerce of the country, and to the continued prosperity and power of\r\nthe American Union. Yet, I am thoroughly satisfied that this very\r\ndesirable object can never be attained by private enterprise, or\r\notherwise than through the direct pecuniary agency and support of the\r\nGeneral Government. The abandonment of our ocean steam mail system is\r\nimpossible so long as we are an active, enterprising, and commercial\r\npeople. And so far from the service becoming self-supporting, it is\r\nprobable that it will never be materially less expensive than at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant endeavor to give the best class of authorities\r\non all the points of engineering which I have introduced, as that\r\nregarding the cost of steam and high mail speed; and to this end I\r\nhave recently visited England and France, and endeavored to ascertain\r\nthe practice in those countries, especially in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI desire to return my sincere acknowledgments for many courtesies\r\nreceived from Mr. Charles Atherton, of London, England; Robert Murray,\r\nEsq., Southampton; and Hon. Horatio King, of Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS RAINEY.\r\n\r\nNew-York, _December 9, 1857_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Assumed_ (Section I.) _that steam mails upon the ocean control the\r\ncommerce and diplomacy of the world; that they are essential to our\r\ncommercial and producing country; that we have not established the\r\nocean mail facilities commensurate with our national ability and the\r\ndemands of our commerce; and that we to-day are largely dependent on,\r\nand tributary to our greatest commercial rival, Great Britain, for the\r\npostal facilities, which should be purely national, American, and\r\nunder our own exclusive control:_\r\n\r\n2. _Assumed_ (Section II.) _that fast ocean mails are exceedingly\r\ndesirable for our commerce, our defenses, our diplomacy, the\r\nmanagement of our squadrons, our national standing, and that they are\r\ndemanded by our people at large:_\r\n\r\n3. _Assumed_ (Section III.) _that fast steamers alone can furnish\r\nrapid transport to the mails; that these steamers can not rely on\r\nfreights; that sailing vessels will ever carry staple freights at a\r\nmuch lower figure, and sufficiently quickly; that while steam is\r\neminently successful in the coasting trade, it can not possibly be so\r\nin the transatlantic freighting business; and that the rapid transit\r\nof the mails, and the slower and more deliberate transport of freight\r\nis the law of nature:_\r\n\r\n4. _Assumed_ (Section IV.) _that high, adequate mail speed is\r\nextremely costly, in the prime construction of vessels, their repairs,\r\nand their more numerous employees; that the quantity of fuel consumed\r\nis enormous, and ruinous to unaided private enterprise; and that this\r\nis clearly proven both by theory and indisputable facts as well as by\r\nthe concurrent testimony of the ablest writers on ocean steam\r\nnavigation:_\r\n\r\n5. _Assumed_ (Section V.) _that ocean mail steamers can not live on\r\ntheir own receipts; that neither the latest nor the anticipated\r\nimprovements in steam shipping promise any change in this fact; that\r\nself-support is not likely to be attained by increasing the size of\r\nsteamers; that the propelling power in fast steamers occupies all of\r\nthe available space not devoted to passengers and express freight; and\r\nthat steamers must be fast to do successful mail and profitable\r\npassenger service:_\r\n\r\n6. _Assumed_ (Section VI.) _that sailing vessels can not successfully\r\ntransport the mails; that the propeller can not transport them as\r\nrapidly or more cheaply than side-wheel vessels; that with any\r\nconsiderable economy of fuel and other running expenses, it is but\r\nlittle faster than the sailing vessel; that to patronize these slow\r\nvessels with the mails, the Government would unjustly discriminate\r\nagainst sailing vessels in the transport of freights; that we can not\r\nin any sense depend on the vessels of the Navy for the transport of\r\nthe mails; that individual enterprise can not support fast steamers;\r\nand that not even American private enterprise can under any conditions\r\nfurnish a sufficiently rapid steam mail and passenger marine: then,_\r\n\r\n7. _Conceded_ (Section VII.) _that it is the duty of the Government to\r\nits people to establish and maintain an extensive, well-organized, and\r\nrapid steam mail marine, for the benefit of production, commerce,\r\ndiplomacy, defenses, the public character, and the general interests\r\nof all classes; that our people appreciate the importance of commerce,\r\nand are willing to pay for liberal postal facilities; that our trade\r\nhas greatly suffered for the want of ocean mails; that we have been\r\nforced to neglect many profitable branches of industry, and many large\r\nfields of effort; and that there is positively no means of gaining and\r\nmaintaining commercial ascendency except through an ocean steam mail\r\nsystem:_\r\n\r\n8. _Conceded_ (Section VIII.) _that the Government can discharge the\r\nclear and unquestionable duty of establishing foreign mail facilities,\r\nonly by paying liberal prices for the transport of the mails for a\r\nlong term of years, by creating and sustaining an ocean postal system,\r\nby legislating upon it systematically, and by abandoning our slavish\r\ndependence upon Great Britain:_\r\n\r\n9. _Conceded_ (Section IX.) _that the British ocean mail system\r\nattains greater perfection and extent every year; that instead of\r\nbecoming self-supporting, it costs the treasury more and more every\r\nyear; that English statesmen regard its benefits as far outweighing\r\nthe losses to the treasury; that so far from abandoning, they are\r\nregularly and systematically increasing it; that it was never regarded\r\nby the whole British public with more favor, than at the present time;\r\nthat it is evidently one of the most enduring institutions of the\r\ncountry; that it necessitates a similar American system; that without\r\nit our people are denied the right and privilege of competition; and\r\nthat we are thus far by no means adequately prepared for that\r\ncompetition, or for our own development._\r\n\r\nSection X. _notices each of the American lines, and presents many\r\nfacts corroborating the views advanced in the preceding sections._\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER A.\r\n\r\nPaper A _(page 192) enumerates all the Steamers of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER B.\r\n\r\nPaper B _(page 193) gives a list of all the British Ocean Mail Lines_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER C.\r\n\r\nPaper C _(page 198) presents Projet of Franco-American Navigation_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER D.\r\n\r\nPaper D _(page 199) gives the Steam Lines between Europe and America_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER E.\r\n\r\nPaper E _(page 200) gives many extracts from eminent statesmen,\r\ncorroborating views herein advanced_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER F.\r\n\r\nPaper F _(page 219) gives the Steam Lines of the whole world_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER G.\r\n\r\nPaper G _(page 220) American Mail Lines: Letter of Hon.

The\r\nprogress of Steam, from the days of its first application to lifting\r\npurposes, through all of its gradations of application to railway\r\nlocomotion and steamboat and steamship propulsion down to the present\r\ntime, has been a series of splendid and highly useful triumphs, alike\r\ncreditable to the genius of its promoters, and profitable to the\r\nnations which have adopted it. However great the progress of the\r\nworld, or the prosperity of commercial nations prior to its\r\nintroduction, it can not be doubted that it now constitutes the\r\nlargest, surest, and most easily available means of progress,\r\nprosperity, and power known to civilized nations; or that the\r\ndevelopment, wealth, and independence of any country will be in the\r\nratio of the application of steam to all of the ordinary purposes of\r\nlife. It has been canonized among the sacred elements of national\r\npower, and commissioned as the great laborer of the age. Every\r\ncivilized nation has adopted it as the best means of interior\r\ndevelopment, and as almost the only forerunner of commerce and\r\ncommunication with the outer world. It has thus become an\r\nindispensable necessity of every day life, whether by land or by sea,\r\nto the producer, the consumer, the merchant, the manufacturer, the\r\nartisan, the pleasure-seeker, the statesman, and the state itself, to\r\npublic liberty, and to the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an agent of so great power and influence, is\r\nnecessarily a fact of unusual significance to a nation like the United\r\nStates, which combines within itself in a high degree, the three most\r\nimportant interests, of large Agricultural and Mineral Productions,\r\nextensive and increasing Manufactures, and an immense Foreign Commerce\r\nand Domestic Trade. Our country is essentially commercial in its\r\ntastes and tendencies; our people are, as a result of our common\r\nschools, bold, inquiring, and enterprising; and our constitution and\r\nlaws are well calculated to produce a nation of restless and vigorous\r\nmerchants, traders, and travellers. Foreign commerce is a necessity\r\nof our large and redundant agricultural production. Our extended\r\nsea-coast, and necessarily large coasting-trade between the States,\r\nhave begotten an unbounded spirit of maritime adventure. The ample\r\nmaterial, and other facilities for building vessels, have also\r\ncontributed to this end. As capable as any people on earth of running\r\nvessels and conducting mercantile enterprise, we have found foreign\r\ncommerce a profitable field for the investment of labor, intelligence,\r\nand capital.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any field of trade in the world which we are not\r\nnaturally better calculated to occupy than any other country. Most of\r\nthe great commercial nations employ their ships as common carriers for\r\nother nations, and limit their exports to manufactures alone. Great\r\nBritain is an example of this. She exports no products of the soil,\r\nfor very obvious reasons. The exports of France partake of the same\r\ngeneral character, domestic manufactures, with a small portion of the\r\nproducts of the soil. So, also, with the German States and Holland.\r\nThe United States, to the contrary, have an immense export trade in\r\nthe products of the soil. These exports have the advantage of\r\nembracing every production of the temperate zone, and some few of the\r\nmore profitable of those of the torrid. These constitute a large\r\nsource of wealth, and are daily increasing in quantity, value, and\r\nimportance. Combined with the manufactured productions of the country,\r\nand the yield of the mines, they require a large amount of shipping,\r\nwhich, extending to nearly all nations, opens a diversified and rich\r\nfield of trade. The exchanges of production between our own and other\r\ncountries, are, consequently, very large and general, and must\r\ncontinue to increase to an indefinite extent, as the States and\r\nTerritories of the Union fill up, and as the various new and opening\r\nbranches of domestic industry develop and mature.\r\n\r\nThe extent which this trade will reach in a few generations, its\r\naggregate value, and the influence which it will wield over the world\r\nif judiciously and energetically promoted, and if wisely protected\r\nagainst encroachment from abroad, and embarrassment at home, no human\r\nforesight can predict or adequately imagine. With a larger field of\r\noperations, at home and abroad, than any nation ever possessed before,\r\nwith the pacific commercial policy of the age, and with the aids of\r\nscience, the telegraph, and steam to urge it on, American Commerce has\r\nopened before it a glorious career and an imposing responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut the conquests of this commerce are not to be the bloodless\r\nvictories of power unopposed; not the result of bold adventure without\r\ncheck, or of simply American enterprise without the Government's aid.\r\nOur foe is a wary, well-scarred, and well-tried old warrior, who has\r\nthe unequalled wisdom of experience, and the patient courage that has\r\ntriumphed over many defeats. The field has been in his hands for ten\r\ngenerations, and he knows every byway, every marsh, every foot of\r\ndefense, and the few inassailable points to be preserved and guarded.\r\nGreat Britain, particularly, knows how essential is a large general\r\ncommerce for opening a market for her manufactures. She is dependent\r\non those manufactures, and upon the carrying trade of the world for a\r\nliving; and she fosters and protects them not alone by the reputed and\r\nwell-known individual enterprise and energy of her people, but by a\r\nwise and forecasting policy of state, a mighty and irresistible naval\r\nand military array, a wisely concerted, liberal, well-arranged, and\r\nlong-pursued steam system, and prompt, unflinching protection of\r\nBritish subjects in their rights throughout the world.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is prepared to resist our commercial progress, as she\r\nhas already done, step by step, by all the means within her power. She\r\nhas wisely brought steam to her aid, and now has a system of long\r\nstanding at last well matured. Her diplomacy has ever been conspicuous\r\nthroughout the world, for ability and zeal, whether in the ministerial\r\nor consular service, and for its persistent advocacy of British rights\r\nin trade as well as for its machinations against the extension of the\r\ncommerce or the power of this country. Such action on the part of any\r\nwise rival nation is naturally to be expected; and all that we can\r\nobject to is that, seeing this policy and its inevitable tendency, our\r\ncountry should stand still and suffer her trade to be paralyzed and\r\nwrested from her, without an effort to relieve it, or the employment\r\nof any of those commercial agencies and facilities which experience\r\nshows to be all-efficient in such cases. It is utter folly for us to\r\nmaintain a simply passive competition; we must either progress or\r\nretrograde. It is wrong to be willing to occupy a secondary place,\r\nwhen nature and the common wants of the world so clearly indicate that\r\nwe should occupy the first; for if, as before assumed, foreign\r\ncommerce is our destiny, and if we can not accomplish our highest\r\ncapabilities except by commerce, then if we ever attain our true\r\ndignity and station as a nation, it must be by enlarging,\r\nliberalizing, strengthening, and encouraging our foreign trade, by all\r\nof the proper, efficient, and honorable means within our power. It is\r\nthe duty of the Government, both to itself and to its citizens. (_See\r\nSection VII._)\r\n\r\nThe history of commercial nations admonishes us that no trading people\r\ncan long maintain their ascendency without using all of the most\r\napproved means of the age for prosecuting trade. Portugal was at one\r\ntime the most powerful commercial nation of the globe; and at another\r\nHolland was the mistress of the seas. But while the latter is now only\r\na fourth-rate commercial power, the former has sunk into obscurity,\r\nand is nearly forgotten of men. At that time England and France had\r\nbut a limited foreign trade and scarcely any commercial reputation.\r\nFrance could more easily maintain her existence without a foreign\r\ntrade, than could England; and yet her matured manufactures and her\r\nproducts of the soil became so valuable that she sought a foreign\r\nmarket. England, to the contrary, had not territory enough to remain\r\nat home, and yet be a great power. She matured an immense\r\nmanufacturing system, and needed a market, as well as the raw\r\nmaterial, and food for her operatives. She began to stretch her arms\r\nto the outer world, and had made very considerable strides in foreign\r\ncommerce side by side with France and the German States, and in the\r\nface of the steady young opposition of the American States.\r\n\r\nIt now became a contest for supremacy. Her large navy had enabled her\r\nto conquer important foreign territories, which with the supremacy of\r\nthe seas would make her the mistress of the world. France was still\r\nher equal rival, and the United States were becoming formidable common\r\ncarriers, although they had but little legitimate commerce of their\r\nown, and none that was under their positive control. The commercial\r\nmen of England finding their statesmen ready to aid them in their\r\nefforts for national progress, wealth, and glory, directed their\r\nattention to steam as an agent of supremacy and power, both in the\r\nNavy and the Commercial Marine. They indicated and proved the\r\nnecessity of drawing the bonds between them and foreign countries more\r\nclosely; of shortening the distances between them; of providing the\r\nmeans of rapid, safe, and comfortable transit of English merchants\r\nbetween their homes and foreign lands; of regular, rapid, reliable\r\nBritish steam mails to every point with which Englishmen had business,\r\nor could create it; and of government agency as the only means by\r\nwhich this desirable, this essential service could be rendered to\r\ncommerce and to the country. They readily saw that rapid and reliable\r\npassenger facilities, and the rapid and regular transmission of\r\ncommercial and diplomatic intelligence would give to British merchants\r\nand to British statesmen the certain control of commerce, and the\r\nconformation of the political destinies of many of the smaller nations\r\nof the Eastern and Western hemispheres.\r\n\r\nIt was not a difficult task to convince the British statesman that it\r\nwas his duty to encourage the commerce, on which the wealth, power,\r\nand glory of his country depended, by all the aids known to the\r\nconstitution; and to uphold the hands of the merchant by the use of\r\nthe money which his traffic had brought into the public coffers. There\r\nwas no contest between North and South, East and West. It was the\r\nwhole of England which was to be benefited directly or indirectly; and\r\nthey were willing that it should be any part rather than none. The\r\nevident advantages which the United States possessed in her more\r\nnumerous articles of export, (_see page 16_,) as well as the rapid\r\nstrides which her first clippers were making across the ocean, were\r\nreasons urgent enough for the forecasting statesmen of Britain; and\r\nthey determined to continue or to obtain the profitable dominion of\r\nthe seas, although it might cost a sum of money far beyond the postal\r\nincome. They knew that these postal and passenger facilities were\r\nneeded by every class of community, and that there was no one in the\r\nkingdom who would not be in some way benefited by them; and that the\r\nsums of money paid for them, although not apparently returned, were\r\nyet returned in a thousand indirect channels and by a variety of\r\nreflex benefits not calculable as a transaction of exchange.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, see to-day, as the fruit of that determination, the\r\nproudest and the most profitable postal and mercantile steam marine\r\nthat floats the seas. Several large companies, authorized to transport\r\nthe mails to all parts of the world, were immediately organized, and\r\npaid liberal allowances for their peculiar duties. Where the\r\npracticability of the service was considered doubtful, larger sums\r\nwere paid, and a greater length of time granted for making the\r\nexperiment. The contracts were generally made for twelve years; and\r\nwhen their terms expired they were renewed for another term of twelve\r\nyears, which will expire in 1862. Thus many of the lines have been in\r\noperation for the last nineteen years, and have demonstrated the\r\npracticability, the cheapness, the utility, and the necessity of such\r\nservice. The entire foreign mail service is conducted by fifteen\r\ncompanies, having one hundred and twenty-one steamers, with a gross\r\ntonnage of 235,488 tons; the net tonnage being 141,293, assuming the\r\nengines, boilers, fuel, etc., to be forty per cent of the whole\r\ntonnage, which is altogether too low an estimate. The whole number of\r\nBritish sea-going steamers is sixteen hundred and sixty-nine, with an\r\naggregate tonnage of 383,598 tons, exclusive of engines and boilers,\r\nand of 639,330 tons gross, including engines and boilers. (_See paper\r\nA, page 192._) We must add to this list the new steamer \"Great\r\nEastern,\" whose tonnage is twenty-seven thousand tons, and which will\r\nmake the entire present mercantile steam tonnage of Great Britain\r\n660,330 tons. The greater portion of these steamers, exclusive of\r\nthose engaged in the foreign mail service, are employed in the\r\ncoasting and foreign continental trade; while some few of them run in\r\nthe American merchant service, and many others in the subsidized mail\r\nservice of foreign countries, such as the lines from Hamburgh and\r\nAntwerp to Brazil, and from those cities to the United States. Some of\r\nthem are also engaged in the mail service between Canada and England,\r\nunder the patronage of the Canadian government. (_See paper D, page\r\n199._) If we add to this list the 271 war steamers, the 220 gunboats,\r\nand the Great Eastern, we shall find that the British Mail,\r\nMercantile, and War Marine consists of the enormous number of two\r\nthousand one hundred and sixty-one steamers, exclusive of the large\r\nnumber now building. Nearly all of these are adapted to the ocean, or\r\nto the coasting service, and may be classed as sea-going vessels.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace this rapid progress of steam since its\r\nfirst application to purposes of mail transport in 1833. An\r\nintelligent writer says, \"The rise and progress of the ocean steam\r\nmail service of Great Britain is second in interest to no chapter in\r\nthe maritime history of the world;\" and while we acknowledge a\r\ngrateful pride in the triumphs of our transatlantic brethren, we must\r\nblush with shame at our dereliction in this great, and civilizing, and\r\nenriching service of modern times. The steam marine of the United\r\nStates, postal, mercantile, and naval, is to-day so insignificant in\r\nextent that we do not feel entirely certain that it is a sufficient\r\nnucleus for the growth of a respectable maritime power. The few ships\r\nthat we possess are among the fleetest and the most comfortable that\r\ntraverse the ocean, and have excited the admiration of the world\r\nwherever they have been seen. But their number is so small, their\r\nservice so limited, their field of operation so contracted, that our\r\nlarge commerce and travel are dependent, in most parts of the world,\r\non British steam mail lines for correspondence and transport, or on\r\nthe slow, irregular, and uncertain communications of sailing vessels.\r\nThe question here naturally suggests itself: Have we progressed in\r\nocean steam navigation in a ratio commensurate with the improvements\r\nof the age, or of our own improvement in every thing else? And has the\r\nGovernment of the country afforded to the people the facilities of\r\nenterprise and commercial competition which are clearly necessary to\r\nenable them to enter the contest on equal terms with other commercial\r\ncountries? (_See Section VII._)\r\n\r\nThe Ocean Mail Service of the United States, consists of eight lines,\r\nand twenty one steamers in commission, with an aggregate tonnage of\r\n48,027 tons. Three of these lines are transatlantic; the Collins, the\r\nHavre, and the Bremen. Two connect us with our Pacific possessions,\r\nand incidentally with Cuba and New-Granada. They are however\r\nindispensable lines of coast navigation. One connects the ports of\r\nCharleston, in the United States, and Havana, in Cuba, another\r\nconnects New-Orleans with Vera Cruz, and another connects Havana and\r\nNew-Orleans. Beyond these, we have a line of two steamers running\r\nbetween New-York and New-Orleans, touching at Havana, and one steamer\r\ntouching at the same point between New-York and Mobile. Also four\r\nsteamers between New-York and Savannah, four between New-York and\r\nCharleston, two between New-York and Norfolk, two between Philadelphia\r\nand Savannah, two between Boston and Baltimore, four between\r\nNew-Orleans and Texas, and two between New-Orleans and Key West. All\r\nof these are coast steamers of the best quality; and some few of them\r\nhave a nominal mail pay. We have also several transient steamers which\r\nhave no routes or mail contracts, and which are consequently employed\r\nin irregular and accidental service, or laid up. They are the\r\nEricsson, the Washington and the Hermann, the Star of the West, the\r\nPrometheus, the Northern Light, the Daniel Webster, the Southerner,\r\nthe St. Louis, laid up in New-York; the Uncle Sam, the Orizaba, and\r\nthe Brother Jonathan, belonging to the Nicaragua Transit Company, and\r\nthe California, Panama, Oregon, Northerner, Fremont, and the tow-boat\r\nTobago, belonging to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, all lying in\r\nthe Pacific. Also the Queen of the West, Mr. Morgan's new steamer, in\r\nNew-York. These, like all other American steamers when unemployed on\r\nmail lines, generally lie in port for want of a remunerative trade.\r\n(_See Paper A._)\r\n\r\nThe aggregate tonnage of these fifty-seven steamers is 94,795 tons.\r\nEighteen of them, with an aggregate tonnage of 24,845 tons, are\r\nengaged in no service. Twenty-three of them, with 24,071 tons, are\r\nengaged in our coasting trade. Fourteen of them, with 19,813 tons,\r\n(Gov. register,) are engaged in the California, Oregon, Central\r\nAmerican, Mexican, and Cuban mail service; while eight of them, with\r\n25,178 tons aggregate tonnage, are engaged in the transatlantic mail\r\nservice proper, between this country and Europe. It is thus seen that\r\nwe have in all but 57 ocean steamers, of 94,795 aggregate tons; while\r\nGreat Britain has sixteen hundred and seventy, with 666,330 aggregate\r\ntons; that we have twenty-two of these, of 45,001 tons, engaged in the\r\nforeign and domestic mail service, while she has one hundred and\r\ntwenty-one, of 235,488 aggregate tonnage, engaged in the foreign mail\r\nservice almost exclusively; and that we have thirty-seven steamers\r\nengaged in the coasting trade and lying still, while she has fifteen\r\nhundred and forty-eight steamers engaged in her coasting trade and\r\nmerchant service. (_See page 167_, for length of British and American\r\nmail lines, and the miles run per year.) Comparisons are said to be\r\nodious, but it is more odious for such comparisons as these to be\r\npossible in these days of enlightened commercial enterprise and\r\nthrift; and especially when so greatly to the disadvantage of a\r\ncountry which boldly claims an aggregate civilization, enterprise, and\r\nprosperity equalled by those of no other country on the globe. As\r\nregards our steam navy, it is too small to afford adequate protection\r\nto our commerce and citizens; much less to defend the country in time\r\nof war. We have not steamers enough in the navy to place one at each\r\nof our important seaports; much less to send them to foreign stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF RAPID STEAM MAILS.\r\n\r\n    ARE OCEAN STEAM MAILS DESIRABLE AND NECESSARY FOR A COMMERCIAL\r\n    PEOPLE? THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE DEMANDS THEM: MUTUAL DEPENDENCE OF\r\n    NATIONS: FAST MAILS NECESSARY TO CONTROL SLOW FREIGHTS: THE\r\n    FOREIGN POST OF EVERY NATION IS MORE OR LESS SELFISH: IF WE\r\n    NEGLECT APPROVED METHODS, WE ARE THEREBY SUBORDINATED TO THE SKILL\r\n    OF OTHERS: THE WANT OF A FOREIGN POST IS A NATIONAL CALAMITY:\r\n    OTHER NATIONS CAN NOT AFFORD US DUE FACILITIES: WARS AND ACCIDENTS\r\n    FORBID: THE CRIMEA AND THE INDIES AN EXAMPLE: MANY OF OUR FIELDS\r\n    OF COMMERCE NEED A POST: BRAZIL, THE WEST-INDIES, AND PACIFIC\r\n    SOUTH-AMERICA: MAILS TO THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE BY THE NUMEROUS\r\n    CUNARD VESSELS: CORRESPONDENCE WITH AFRICA, CHINA, THE\r\n    EAST-INDIES, THE MAURITIUS, AND AUSTRALIA: SLAVISH DEPENDENCE ON\r\n    GREAT BRITAIN: DESIRABLE FOR OUR DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE:\r\n    FOR THE CONTROL OF OUR SQUADRONS: CASES OF SUFFERING: NECESSARY\r\n    FOR DEFENSE: FOR CULTIVATING FRIENDLY RELATIONS AND OPENING TRADE:\r\n    THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH WILL REQUIRE FASTER AND HEAVIER MAILS: OUR\r\n    COMMERCE REQUIRES FAST STEAMERS FOR THE RAPID AND EASY TRANSIT OF\r\n    PASSENGERS: MODES OF BENEFITING COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving seen that the ocean steam mail service is largely developed in\r\nsome countries, especially in Great Britain, and that the second and\r\nthird commercial powers of the world, the United States and France,\r\nhave not largely employed this important agent in their commerce, the\r\ninquiry naturally arises, whether fast ocean steam mails are desirable\r\nand necessary to the commercial prosperity of a people. Whether this\r\nquestion be considered in its relative or its natural bearings, the\r\nreply is the same. Relatively considered, a large ocean steam mail\r\nservice is indispensable to a people who are largely commercial,\r\nbecause the most noted commercial rivals of the world employ it, and\r\nthus either force them to its use, or the loss of their commerce, and\r\nthe gradual transference of their shipping and trade into the hands of\r\ntheir rivals. Considered in its natural bearings, in its direct\r\ninfluences and effects _per se_, it becomes even more evidently\r\nnecessary, as the means of a ready and reliable knowledge of the\r\ncondition, wants, and movements of all those with whom a commercial\r\nnation necessarily has business, or could or should create it.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the age demands a more intimate acquaintance and\r\ncommunication than we have hitherto had with the outer world. Our\r\nknowledge of foreign lands has pointed out innumerable wants hitherto\r\nunknown, and suggested innumerable channels of their supply. Nations\r\nhave learned to depend on each other as formerly neighbor depended on\r\nhis neighbor for any little necessary or luxury of life. The luxurious\r\nspirit of the times requires the importation and exportation of an\r\nimmense list of articles with which foreign countries were formerly\r\nunacquainted, but which have now become as indispensable as air, and\r\nlight, and water. And if it is not necessary that these many articles\r\nshall be transported from land to land with the speed of the telegraph\r\nor the fleetness of the ocean steamer, it is at any rate necessary\r\nthat the facts concerning them, their ample or scarce supply, their\r\nhigh or low price, their sale or purchase, their shipment or arrival,\r\ntheir loss, or seizure, or detention, should be made known with all of\r\nthe combined speed of the telegraph, the lightning train, and the\r\nrapid ocean mail steamer. If we possess ourselves these facilities of\r\nrapid, regular, and reliable information to an extent that no other\r\nnation does, we will be the first to reach the foreign market with our\r\nsupplies, the first to bring the foreign article into the markets of\r\nthe world, and the proper recipients of the first and largest profits\r\nof the cream of the trade of every land.\r\n\r\nIf we neglect these precautions, and refuse to establish these\r\nfacilities, because their cost is apparent in one small sum of\r\nexpenditure, while their large returns in profits diffused among the\r\nwhole people are not so palpably apparent to the common eye; if we\r\nleave to the genius and enterprise of the people that which private\r\nenterprise and human skill unaided can never accomplish; in a word, if\r\nwe fail to keep up with the world around us, and to progress _pari\r\npassu_ with our wise, acute, and experienced commercial rivals, then,\r\nas a matter of course, the information which we receive from the\r\nforeign world must come through others, and those our rivals, and must\r\nbe deprived of its value by the advantage which they have already\r\ntaken of it. It is idle to suppose that any commercial nation on earth\r\nwill not so arrange her foreign post as to exclude others than her own\r\ncitizens as much as possible from its benefits. This is a paramount\r\nduty of the government to the citizen. It is therefore apparent that\r\nour commerce must of necessity greatly suffer when its conduct is at\r\nall dependent on foreigners and competitors, and that it is\r\nexceedingly desirable, for the avoidance of such a calamity, that we\r\nshould have independent and ample foreign mail facilities of our own,\r\nwherever it is possible for our people to trade and obtain wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly impossible that other nations should afford these\r\nfacilities, or that our people should have confidence in them if\r\nattempted, or that they could be in any sense reliable in those many\r\ncases of exigency, national disputes, war, and accident, which usually\r\nafford us our best chances of speculation and profit. A dependence on\r\nforeigners for this supply of information, which never reaches us\r\nuntil it is emasculated of its virtues, is extremely hazardous. It\r\nfails just at the point where it is most desirable. Foreign nations,\r\nespecially the commercial European nations, are constantly at war, and\r\nare constantly interrupting their packet service. The late Crimean and\r\nthe present Indian wars are a good illustration. Our country, isolated\r\nfrom the contending nations, and fortified against continual ruptures\r\nby a policy of non-intervention, is peculiarly blessed with the\r\nprivilege and ability to regularly and unintermittingly conduct her\r\ncommerce and reap her profits, even more securely, while her rivals\r\nare temporarily devoting their attention to war. Such being the fact,\r\nit is wholly desirable and necessary to the end proposed that our\r\nsteam post should on all such occasions regularly come and go, even\r\namid the din of battle, and the conflict of our rivals, who for the\r\ntime are powerless to oppose our peaceful and legitimate commerce, and\r\nare generally but too glad to avail its offerings.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of the desirableness and the necessity of the\r\ntransmarine steam post on important lines of foreign communication\r\nwhere we have a large trade, and yet no postal means of conducting it.\r\nOur immense trade with Brazil and other portions of South-America,\r\nwhich if properly fostered would increase with magic rapidity, sends\r\nits news and its freight by the same vessel, or is compelled to use\r\nthe necessarily selfishly arranged, and circuitous, and non-connecting\r\nlines of Great Britain. A letter destined for Brazil, four thousand\r\nmiles distant, must needs go by England, Portugal, the Coast of\r\nAfrica, Madeira, and the Cape de Verdes, a distance of eight thousand\r\nmiles, in a British packet. One destined for the Pacific Coast of\r\nSouth-America must go to Panama and await the arrival of the English\r\npacket, with London letters more recently dated, before it can proceed\r\non to Callao, Lima, or Valparaiso. Letters destined to the West-Indies\r\ncan go to Havana only, by American steamers; but they must there await\r\nthe British line which takes them to St. Thomas, and there be\r\ndistributed and forwarded to the various islands, the Spanish Main,\r\nthe Guianas, Venezuela, and New-Granada by some one of the ten\r\ndifferent British steam packet lines running semi-monthly from that\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nSo with half of our letters which go to the Continent of Europe: they\r\nmust go by the Cunard line to England, and thence by English steamers\r\nto the British Channel, the Baltic, the White Sea, the Mediterranean,\r\nEgypt, Constantinople, or the Black Sea. Those to places along the\r\ncoast of Africa and to the Cape of Good Hope are dependent on the same\r\nEnglish packet transit. For our communication with China, India,\r\nAustralia, the East-Indies generally, and the Islands of the Pacific,\r\nwe are entirely and slavishly dependent, as usual, on Great Britain.\r\nInstead of sending our letters and passengers direct from Panama or\r\nSan Francisco to Honolulu, Hong Kong, Shanghae, Macao, Calcutta,\r\nCeylon, Bombay, Madras, Sydney, Melbourne, Batavia, the Mauritius, and\r\nthe Gulf of Mozambique, by a short trunk line of our own steamers, and\r\nfrom its terminus only, by the British lines, they now go first to\r\nEngland, as a slavish matter of course, then across the Continent or\r\nthrough the Mediterranean to Egypt, thence by land to the Red Sea, and\r\nthence to China and the East-Indies; or from England by her steam\r\nlines around the Cape of Good Hope to Australia and the East-Indies;\r\nor by slow and uncertain sailing packets direct from our own country,\r\neither around Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope. It is evident to\r\nevery reflecting man who has given the subject any attention, that all\r\nof these lines of communication would be very desirable, and very\r\nhighly profitable to our people at large; and that the latter and that\r\nalong the West Coast of South-America could be easily established by\r\ntwo new contracts for that purpose, or in some other way, to the great\r\nand lasting advantage of our countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe transmarine post is very desirable for the better conduct of our\r\nforeign diplomacy and the consular service. It is now almost\r\nimpossible for our ministers and agents abroad to hold any thing like\r\na regular correspondence with the State Department, unless it be those\r\nin Southern and Western Europe. I was told last year by our Minister\r\nin Rio de Janeiro that his dispatches from the Government at home\r\nseldom reached him under four months; and Mr. Gilmer, the Consul of\r\nthe United States at Bahia, reports, in the \"Consular Returns\" now\r\nabout to be published, that his dispatches never come to hand under\r\nfour months, that they are frequently out six months, and that many\r\nare lost altogether. This is the experience and the reiterated\r\ncomplaint of nearly every foreign _employee_ of the Government, who\r\nhas any zeal in prosecuting his country's business, and may find it\r\nnecessary to get instructions or advice from home. Many knowing the\r\ndelays, uncertainty, and irregularity of correspondence, make no\r\nattempt whatever to communicate regularly with the Department. We\r\nfrequently express great surprise that we have no intelligence from\r\nour ministers, special ambassadors, and agents; but do not reflect\r\nthat in the majority of cases dispatches have to be sent by\r\nirresponsible and slow-sailing vessels, or by the steamers of Great\r\nBritain, which it may be safely asserted are in no particular hurry to\r\ndeliver them to us. Three several letters sent by me at separate times\r\nthrough the British mail from Rio de Janeiro for New-York never\r\nreached their destination.\r\n\r\nNor is it better with our squadrons on foreign stations. They receive\r\ntheir orders in the same slow and irregular way, and find it almost as\r\neasy to send a vessel when they wish to communicate with the Navy\r\nDepartment, or await the movements of their dull old storeships, as to\r\nattempt any other means of intercourse. It may be safely said that\r\nthey are not actually under the control of the Department, in many\r\nimportant cases, one time in ten. Whatever the dispute, it is left\r\nentirely at the will of the Commodore, or it remains unsettled\r\naltogether. Our recent accumulated Paraguayan difficulties is a case\r\nin point. American citizens were driven from the country, and their\r\nvaluable property confiscated. They applied to the Commodore for\r\nrelief, but could not obtain it. Our surveying vessel, engaged in a\r\npermitted scientific exploration, was fired into and had some of her\r\nmen killed; and redress being demanded by the Captain from the\r\nCommodore, it was refused. The Commodore feared transcending his\r\ninstructions: he could not communicate with the home authorities much\r\nunder a year; and so the case rested, and yet rests. These wants,\r\npapable as they are in times of peace, become doubly pressing in time\r\nof war. Let a conflict commence with England, or France, on whom we\r\ndepend for mails, or with their allies, and they could easily surprise\r\nand destroy every squadron which we have upon the high seas months\r\nbefore they would necessarily hear of a declaration of war, or know\r\nwhy they were captured. The very contemplation of such possibilities\r\nis intolerable, and should be sufficient of itself, setting aside all\r\nconsiderations of commerce and diplomacy, to arouse our nation to the\r\nadoption of the proper means for its safety and defense.\r\n\r\nAn effective steam postal marine is unquestionably most desirable and\r\nnecessary for the defense of our country, and for the prosecution of\r\nany foreign war. Lord Canning, the British Post-Master General,\r\nrecently said in a report to the House of Lords, that although all of\r\nthe steam mail packets might not be able to carry an armament, or be\r\nrequired in the transport service in time of war, yet the mail\r\nfacilities which they would then afford would be more important and\r\nnecessary than at any other time. He had no idea that because engaged\r\nin a foreign war the postal service would be useless, but to the\r\ncontrary, more than ever indispensable. Such proved to be the fact in\r\nthe late contest in the Crimea, and such is to-day the case with\r\nregard to the troubles in India and China. Their postal vessels have\r\nproven a first necessity in both of these wars, not only for transport\r\nof the troops, but for speedy intelligence also. Without them, England\r\ncould not have entered the Crimean contest, and the French forces\r\nwould have been compelled to remain at home. Turkey would have been\r\noverawed, and Constantinople would have fallen before the Russian\r\nfleet. We are to-day, and always must be, liable to a foreign war. We\r\nhave a great boiling cauldron running over with excitement all along\r\nour southern and south-western borders. Central America, Cuba, the\r\nWest-Indies, and South-America are far more foreign countries to us\r\nthan Europe or the Mediterranean to England. Cuba will no doubt be at\r\nsome day our most important naval station and possession. Even the\r\ndefense of our own coast would require an immense transport service;\r\nfor Texas is nearly four thousand miles from Maine, and California is\r\nseven thousand from the Atlantic seaboard. No better proof can be\r\ngiven of the necessity of a large and extra naval transport service\r\nthan the late Mexican war. But for our steamers it would have taken us\r\nyears to concentrate an army on the shores of Mexico. It was a tedious\r\nprocess at the time; for our ocean mail packets were not then in use.\r\nWe could now land a larger number of men there in one month than we\r\nthen did in a whole year. But our transport facilities are not yet by\r\nany means adequate.\r\n\r\nA large postal steam marine is desirable as a means of cultivating the\r\nsympathies and respect of foreign nations, by bringing them into\r\ncloser friendly and commercial connection with us; and for creating\r\namong them that respect and consideration which the British statesmen\r\nso well know to be an easy means of conducting diplomacy, and an\r\nunfailing source of commercial advantages. It is not necessary that we\r\nshall impose upon foreign countries in these respects by false\r\npretenses; but it is truly desirable, and it would be profitable to an\r\nextent little imagined, to let them know our real importance as a\r\nnation, and understand our pacific policy and _bona fide_ intentions.\r\nThese are important considerations when we wish to carry any point,\r\nestablish any line of policy, remove any prejudice; and nothing will\r\nmore readily produce them, and arouse attention to our articles of\r\nexport, and induce a people to establish a regular business with us,\r\nthan these ever-present, convenient, and imposing mail steamers.\r\nNations as well as individuals estimate us by our appearances; and\r\nwhile it is not desirable that we shall appear more than we are, it is\r\nyet very important that foreign nations with which we have business\r\nshall know our real merits, and respect us for what we are\r\nintrinsically worth. There is evidently no means of our commercial\r\ntriumph over other nations without a liberal and widely extended steam\r\nmail service; and as this triumph is of paramount importance to us,\r\nwho have so many resources, so is the ocean steam mail as the only\r\nmeans of securing it. (_See views of Gen. Rusk, in papers appended._)\r\n\r\nIt has recently been suggested by parties who certainly have not\r\nthought very deeply on the subject, that the completion of the\r\nAtlantic Telegraph, which every body reasonably expects soon to be\r\ncompleted, will so inaugurate a new era in the transmission of\r\nintelligence, that one of its effects will be the supersession of fast\r\nocean mails, and consequently of subsidized steamers. It is a first\r\nand palpable view of this question that much of the important\r\nintelligence between the two countries requiring speedy transmission\r\nwill be sent through the telegraph, notwithstanding the necessarily\r\nhigh prices which will be charged for dispatches. These communications\r\nwill be sententious, summary, and of great variety. The markets,\r\nprices, important political and other events, private personal and\r\nunelaborated intelligence will come over the wires just as they now\r\ncome over existing land lines. The line will create extra facilities\r\nfor operations on both sides, and cause more mutual business to be\r\ndone. It will thus create the necessity for more correspondence than\r\nbefore, for particulars, elaboration, items, bills of lading,\r\nexchanges, duplicates, minute instructions, etc., to which there will\r\nbe no end. The main transaction of any business being made more\r\nquickly, it will be essential for the papers to pass with greater\r\ndispatch. If there were twenty telegraphic wires working day and\r\nnight, which never can be the case from their expensiveness, they\r\ncould not do in a month the correspondence and business done by one\r\nsteamer's mail. Beside this, those who got their dispatches first\r\nwould have a decided advantage over those who would be compelled from\r\nthe mass of business to wait several days. It is an advantage of the\r\nsteam mails that all get their letters and papers at the same time;\r\nand that no one has thus the advantage of the other. It is hardly\r\npossible for one unacquainted with the postal business to conceive how\r\nlarge a mass of mail matter is deposited by each steamer; and it is\r\nonly necessary to see this to realize that the Atlantic Telegraph will\r\nnever materially interfere with the steamers except to require of them\r\ngreater speed and heavier mails.\r\n\r\nIt is the experience on all of our land routes that the thousands of\r\nmiles of telegraph, so far from superseding the mails, have made more\r\nmails necessary, have caused and required them to be much faster, have\r\nnecessitated more correspondence, and induced people to live in more\r\nmutual dependence, to have more communication with one another, and to\r\nmake the home or the business of a man less than formerly his closed\r\ncastle, which none entered, and which no one had any occasion to\r\nenter. The American telegraph has now arrived at great perfection, and\r\nsends its electric throb to every corner of the Union, save California\r\nonly. At the same time, the railroads of the country are taxed to\r\ntheir highest capacity. No period ever witnessed so many, so rapid,\r\nand so well-filled mails. It is evident that no telegraphic system can\r\nproperly do detailed business. First, it is and must ever remain too\r\ncostly. Second, it would require about as many lines as business men,\r\nto give them all equal chances, and no one the profitable precedence.\r\nNext, there is nothing positively accurate and fully reliable. No\r\nsignatures can pass over the line. No transaction can be made final by\r\nit. No bank will pay, or ought to pay, money on public telegraphic\r\ndrafts. And, as in the land service, so in the ocean. The telegraph\r\nacross the ocean will simply create far more business for the mails,\r\nand make it desirable and indispensable that they shall be sent and\r\nreceived by the most rapid conveyance known to the times. Thus, it is\r\nevident that this new and as yet not fully established agent of\r\ninternational communication, so far from obviating our rapid\r\ntransmarine service, will but the more effectually necessitate it.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that our commercial prosperity largely\r\ndepends on the ready and comfortable transit of passengers. The\r\npassenger traffic has increased with astonishing rapidity during the\r\nlast eighteen years. Our smaller merchants can go abroad when mail\r\nsteamers are plenty, and make their own purchases and sales, without\r\npaying heavy commissions and high prices to middlemen; do their\r\nbusiness on less capital; and thus benefit themselves and reduce the\r\nprices to our consumers. Compared with sailing vessels, these few mail\r\nsteamers become the forerunners of trade and commerce, and create an\r\nimmense service for the sail. They enable us to save large sums of\r\ninterest or advances on merchandise consigned, and give to us quick\r\nreturns from the products which we ship abroad. This has long been\r\nevident to Great Britain, and she has acted liberally on the\r\nsuggestion. So desirable is the service for the general prosperity of\r\nher people, that she expends annually for her foreign steam mails\r\nnearly six millions of dollars, while they do not return to the\r\ntreasury much above three. She regards the expenditure as she does\r\nthat for the navy and the army, a necessity for the public\r\npreservation and prosperity.\r\n\r\nAs regards the lines that we now have, they are among the noblest in\r\nthe world. For aggregate comfort, convenience, safety, speed, and\r\ncheapness, they are not equalled by the most famous British lines.\r\nMore luxurious tables, more neatness, cleanliness, and roominess, more\r\ngeneral comforts than have always been characteristic of our Havre,\r\nLiverpool, and California lines, can not be found in the world. The\r\nonly objection to them is, that the service is not sufficient; that\r\nthe trips are not frequent enough; and that the companies are not\r\nenabled to sustain a larger steam marine which would proportionally\r\ncheapen the service, and accommodate more persons and a much larger\r\nclass of interests. Our experiences of the benefits of existing lines,\r\nlimited as those lines are, present an unanswerable argument for the\r\ndesirableness and necessity of a liberal steam postal system, and a\r\nlarge and judicious extension of the present service. (_See views of\r\nSenate Committee, 1852, Paper E._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPABILITIES OF OCEAN STEAM.\r\n\r\n    THE COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES OF OCEAN STEAM: STEAM MAILS ARRIVE AND\r\n    DEPART AT ABSOLUTELY FIXED PERIODS: UNCERTAINTY IS HAZARDOUS AND\r\n    COSTLY: SUBSIDIZED STEAMERS GIVE A NECESSARILY HIGH SPEED TO THE\r\n    MAILS: MONEY CAN NOT AFFORD TO LIE UPON THE OCEAN FOR WEEKS:\r\n    COMPARED WITH SAIL: STEAMERS TRANSPORT CERTAIN CLASSES OF FREIGHT:\r\n    THE HAVRE AND THE CUNARD LINES: THE CUNARD PROPELLERS: STEAMERS\r\n    CAN AFFORD TO TRANSPORT EXPRESS PACKAGES AND GOODS: GOODS TAKEN\r\n    ONLY TO FILL UP: WHY PROPELLERS ARE CHEAPER IN SOME CASES: STEAM\r\n    IN SOME CASES CHEAPER THAN THE WIND: AN ESTIMATE: THE PROPELLER\r\n    FOR COASTING: STEAM ON ITS OWN RECEIPTS HAS NOT SUCCEEDED ON THE\r\n    OCEAN: MARINE AND FLUVIAL NAVIGATION COMPARED: MOST FREIGHTS NOT\r\n    TRANSPORTABLE BY STEAM ON ANY CONDITIONS: AUXILIARY FREIGHTING AND\r\n    EMIGRANT PROPELLERS: LAWS OF TRANSPORT: RAPID MAILS AND LEISURE\r\n    TRANSPORT OF FREIGHT THE LAW OF NATURE: THE PRICE OF COALS RAPIDLY\r\n    INCREASING: ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS AND CHEAPENING IN MARINE\r\n    PROPULSION NOT REALIZED.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelieving that no further arguments or facts are necessary to show\r\nthat a rapid steam mail marine is desirable and essential to the\r\nsuccessful government of the country, to our foreign commerce, and to\r\nthe growth of individual interests and a general prosperity of the\r\npeople, I shall now make some few inquiries concerning the Commercial\r\nCapabilities of steam, as the most effective agent for the rapid\r\ntransit of the ocean, and the most expensive agent for the transport\r\nof goods. After this, it will be necessary to examine into the Cost\r\nof Steam, as a subject closely allied to its general capabilities.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the wind as a cheap agent of locomotion, this\r\nmuch may be safely predicated of steam vessels for the mails; that\r\ntheir time of departure and arrival has an absolute fixity which is\r\nattainable by no other means, and which is highly conducive to the\r\nbest interests of all those for whom commerce is conducted. No\r\nreasoning is necessary to show to the man of business, or even to the\r\npleasure-seeker, the importance of approximate certainty as to the\r\ntime when the mail leaves and when he can receive an answer to his\r\ndispatches. He may not be able to give clearly philosophic reasons for\r\nit; yet he feels the necessity in his business; and it certainly\r\nrelieves him of many painful doubts, if nothing more. Uncertainty in\r\ncommercial operations is always hazardous and costly to the great mass\r\nof the people, who as a general thing pay more for whatever they get,\r\non the principle that we seldom take a venture in an uncertain thing\r\nunless it holds out inducements of large profit, or unless we get a\r\nhigh price for guarantying it. So in commercial correspondence, which\r\nconstitutes the great bulk of the ocean mails. Let uncertainty prevail\r\nfor but three or four days beyond the time when we should have news\r\nfrom abroad, and every body is in doubt, every body speculates, and in\r\nthe end every body is injured.\r\n\r\nNor is this certainty in the time of arrival and departure of the\r\nmails more desirable than their speed. The common sense of the world\r\nhas settled down upon the necessity of rapid mails; and all of the\r\ningenuity of the age is now taxed to its very highest to secure more\r\nspeed in the transmission of intelligence. Many interests demand it.\r\nMoney, which represents labor, is continually lent and borrowed in\r\nbills of exchange, acceptances, deposits, and in actual cash sent\r\nacross the seas. The length of time for passing the bills and\r\ncorrespondence, or the specie itself, thus becomes an exceedingly\r\nimportant item to those who are to use them, and consequently to the\r\nultimate consumer for whom they are conducting the commercial\r\ntransaction. What community would to-day tolerate the idea of sending\r\nthree millions of dollars per week, and five millions of credits\r\nbetween England and the United States on a sailing ship of whatever\r\nquality, with the probability of keeping it lying unproductive on the\r\nocean for thirty days? Extend this to weekly shipments of the same\r\namounts, and have at one time on the waters between the two countries\r\ntwelve million dollars in specie and twenty in credits, tossing about\r\nthe ocean, unproductive and unsafe, and entailing all of the evils\r\nincident to the uncertainty as to the time when it will arrive. But if\r\nthis is not sufficient, extend the inquiry to South-America, and\r\nChina, and India, and see how enormous and useless a waste of money\r\nand interest is incurred in the many millions which by sailing vessels\r\nand slow steamers is fruitlessly gilding the ocean for months. Money\r\nis too valuable and interest too high to keep so many millions of it\r\nlocked up from the world. At two and three per cent a month, the\r\nnation, or, what is the same thing, its commercial and mercantile\r\nclasses, as representing the producing, would soon become bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThe only avoidance of these evident evils is in a rapid transmission\r\nof the mails, specie, and passengers. And herein consists the chief\r\nvalue of the rapid ocean steamer. It is an important case which the\r\nTelegraph, with all of its benefits, can never reach. It can never\r\ntransmit specie; neither the evidences of debt nor of property. The\r\nvoluminous mails, with all of their tedious details, upon which such\r\ntransactions depend, must go and come on steamers, and on steamers\r\nonly. They have the certainty, which will satisfy men and prevent\r\nspeculation, gambling, and imposition; they have the speed, which\r\nshortens credit, keeps specie alway in active use, and enables\r\ncommercial men to know, meet, and supply the wants of the world before\r\nthey become costly or crushing; and they give a rapid and comfortable\r\ntransit to passengers, who can thus look after their business, and\r\nsave much to themselves and to the producer and consumer. Compared\r\nwith sailing vessels their efficiency is really wondrous. Foreign\r\ncorrespondence was formerly very limited, and the interchange of\r\ninterests, feelings, and opinions was slow and tedious. Each nation\r\ndepended solely on itself; and instead of the brotherhood now\r\nprevailing, communicated through the costly channels of war, by\r\nmessages of the cannon, and in powerful, hostile fleets. But the\r\nforeign correspondence of the world is really enormous, and rapidly\r\nincreasing, since the introduction of ocean steamers; and no one will\r\nsay that they have had a small share in producing that fraternal\r\ninternational spirit which is now so widely manifested in Peace\r\nCongresses, Congresses of the Five Powers, explanations, concessions,\r\nand amicable adjustments of difficulties. The peaceful influences and\r\nthe civilization of the times are but another comment on the\r\ncapabilities of steam.\r\n\r\nThere are also certain classes of freights which steam is better\r\ncalculated than sailing vessels to transport; certain rich and costly\r\ngoods which would either damage or depreciate if not brought speedily\r\ninto the market. There are many articles also, as gold and silver\r\nware, jewelry, diamonds, bullion, etc., and some articles of _vertu_\r\nas well as use, which are costly, and have to be insured at high\r\nvalues unless sent on steamers; and which consequently can pay a\r\nrather better price. As in the case of specie, they are too valuable\r\nto be kept long on the ocean; but in the general traffic of the world\r\nthere is so little of this class of freight that steamers can place no\r\nreliance on it as a source of income. These freights have abounded\r\nmost between France and England and the United States. This is the\r\nprincipal reason why the New-York and Havre line of mail steamers has\r\nrun on so unprecedentedly small a subsidy; a sum not more than half\r\nadequate to the support of a mail line but for that class of freights.\r\nThe Cunard line has also derived a large sum of its support from the\r\nsame source. All such articles passing by that line come from England,\r\nIreland, and Scotland, where they are manufactured; and being shipped\r\nby British merchants, are given, as a matter of duty, to their own\r\nsteamers. Another reason for the Cunard line getting most of those\r\nmore profitable freights is that a steamer leaves every week; every\r\nSaturday; and shippers sending packages weekly are not compelled every\r\nother week to hunt up a new line, and open a new set of accounts, as\r\nwould be the case if they attempted to ship by the Collins\r\nsemi-monthly line.\r\n\r\nThese freights have hitherto proven a profitable source of income to\r\nthat line. As there is no manufacturing done in this country for\r\nEurope, the Cunarders and the Havre as well as the Collins and\r\nVanderbilt lines, have no freights that pay the handling from the\r\nUnited States to Europe. And not only has the Cunard line, by starting\r\nfrom home, taken all of these profitable freights from the Collins,\r\nbut it has run a weekly line of propellers from Havre and taken the\r\nfreight over to Liverpool free of charge for its New-York and Boston\r\nsteamers, and thereby shared the freights and greatly reduced the\r\nincome of the Havre line. There being a great superabundance of\r\npropeller stock in Great Britain, which can be purchased frequently at\r\nless than half its cost, and these vessels running the short distance\r\nbetween Havre and Liverpool very cheaply, (_See pages 108-13_,) the\r\nCunarders have cut the Havre freights down from forty to fifteen\r\ndollars per ton, and sometimes for months together to ten dollars per\r\nton. As a matter of course, this price would not pay the handling and\r\ncare of these costly articles; but at fifteen dollars it enabled the\r\nCunard line to fill their ships and derive some profit; as most of\r\nthem, with the exception of the _Persia_, run slowly, use less coal,\r\nand have more freight room. All of these freights are, however, small\r\nin quantity, and not much to be relied on from year to year, as will\r\nbe seen below, in consequence of the action of propellers.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of business which mail steamers can do at\r\nremunerating prices; but which is exceedingly limited anywhere, and\r\nnot at all known on some lines. This is in Express packages. They pay\r\na high price; but seldom reach more than three or four tons under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances. In the early stages of the California\r\nlines, when there was a rush of travel to the gold regions, and a\r\nhurried transit required for a thousand little necessaries of life,\r\nthe New-York and Aspinwall and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's\r\nlines transported a large express freight outward at every voyage,\r\namounting sometimes to two hundred tons; but the golden days of such\r\ncargo have long gone by, and California is now supplied like the rest\r\nof the world by the cheaper and more deliberate transport of sailing\r\nvessels; and the steamers are left to their legitimate business of\r\nmails and passengers. Taking together all of the classes of freights\r\nwhich steamers having mail payment are capable of transporting, they\r\namount at present to but an insignificant part of the income by which\r\nthese steamers can be run. During the last six years these freights\r\nhave reduced more than one hundred per cent; and goods which were then\r\nprofitable to the steamer, are now taken only \"to fill up.\" And the\r\nchief reason for this reduction arises not so much from competition\r\nbetween the steam-lines, which well knew that they could not transport\r\nthese freights when reduced to the present low prices, but from the\r\nintroduction of a large number of propellers, some of which were\r\noriginally designed for this species of trade, and many others which\r\nwere built during the war in the Crimea for the transport of troops.\r\nThese ships were never prosperous anywhere, and are in nearly all\r\ncases at the present found in second hands; the original proprietors\r\nhaving lost a large share of their investment. Thus, purchased\r\ncheaply, and running with simply an auxiliary steam power, and making\r\nthe passages but little shorter than the sailing vessels, and not even\r\nso short as their best passages, they have but little more daily\r\nexpense than the sailing vessels, with all of the deceptive advantages\r\nof being called steamers. They thus get these better freights and a\r\nlarge number of immigrants, which with small interest on prime cost\r\nenables them to live.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may seem, there are yet some cases, even upon the\r\nocean, in which steam can transport freight cheaper than the winds of\r\nheaven. And this species of trade constitutes one of the best\r\ncapabilities of steam power applied to navigation. It is not in the\r\nlong voyage between Europe and America, or between the East and\r\nCalifornia, or yet in the far-off trade among the calms and pacific\r\nseas of the East-Indies and the Pacific Islands; it is not in the\r\nsmooth, lake-like seas of the West-Indies, where there is no freight\r\nwhose transport price will pay for putting it on and taking it off the\r\nsteamer; nor in the trade of Brazil whence a bag of coffee can be\r\ntransported five thousand miles to New-York nearly as cheaply as it\r\ncan from New-York to Baltimore or to Charleston; but it is in the\r\ncoasting trade of almost every country, where the voyage is short. In\r\nthe trade between New-York and Baltimore, between Charleston and\r\nSavannah, between Boston and Portland, or between New-Orleans and Key\r\nWest, or New-Orleans and Galveston, the small sailing vessels spend\r\none half of their time in working in and out of the harbors. Sometimes\r\nthey are two days awaiting winds, to get out of a harbor, two days in\r\nsailing, and two days again in making and entering their port of\r\ndestination; whereas a steamer would make the whole passage in one day\r\nto a day and a half. Now, the distance actually to be run, and for\r\nwhich the steamer will be compelled to burn coal is not very great;\r\nbut the trouble of working the vessel in and out, against adverse\r\nwinds and currents, and amid storms and calms, is sometimes excessive,\r\nwhile the delay and cost are disheartening. They have also the trouble\r\nof warping into and out of the docks, which is not the case with\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nThus, it frequently takes a week for a sailing vessel to do the work\r\nthat a steamer will readily do in twenty-four to thirty-six hours. Say\r\nthat it takes the sail four times as long as the steamer to accomplish\r\na given voyage. To do as much business as the steamer would do in the\r\nsame time, would require four sailing vessels; four times as many men\r\nas one sail requires, or probably twice as many hands in the aggregate\r\nas the steamer would have; and would incur at least twice the expense\r\nof the steamer in feeding them. Now, there is also a much larger\r\naggregate sum invested in these four sail, and the owners pay a much\r\nlarger sum of interest on their prime investment. Or, in other words,\r\nthe steamer with but a few more men, but little greater expense in\r\nliving, a small coal-bill, an engineer and firemen, and a prime outlay\r\nof not more than double the capital, will carry four times the freight\r\nand passengers, without incurring probably so much as three times the\r\nexpense of one of the sail. After the prime cost the most important\r\nitem of expenditure in one of these small steamers is the coal; but\r\nthe distance run being so short, and getting into and out of the\r\nharbor and docks being so easy, the vessel does large execution at\r\nlittle expense. The two most essential benefits, however, of her short\r\nvoyage are, that she is not compelled to carry much fuel, and\r\nconsequently occupies nearly all of her space with freight; and that\r\nthe prices of freight on these short voyages are much larger in\r\nproportion than they are on long voyages. Sailing vessels charge very\r\nlittle more for a thousand miles than they do for five hundred; but a\r\nsteamer may have to charge nearly three times as much; especially if\r\nshe run fast, consume much fuel, and occupy her cargo-room with coal.\r\nThere are distances at which steamers, however large, can not carry a\r\npound of freight; but occupy all their available space with the power\r\nthat drives them. In these long voyages sail becomes much cheaper.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means essential that these small coasting vessels shall be\r\npropellers; for to acquire the same speed they expend the same power\r\nand have the disadvantage of being deeper in the water, and not being\r\nable to go into all harbors with much freight. They have also the\r\nadvantage of carrying more sail, and being generally better able to\r\nstand coast storms than a side-wheel of light draught of water. They\r\nare not quite so expensive in prime construction, but generally\r\nrequire more repairs, and must be on the docks much oftener. They are,\r\nhowever, much better suited than side-wheel vessels to voyages where a\r\nmedium speed is required, and where the steam can be used at pleasure\r\nsimply as an auxiliary power. In such cases there is a profitable\r\neconomy of fuel. But speed has generally been deemed essential in this\r\ncountry, and the side-wheel is everywhere used. But entirely the\r\ncontrary is the case in Great Britain and France. There the coasting\r\nbusiness is conducted by screws almost altogether; and the speed does\r\nnot transcend the limit of economy and commercial capability. They\r\ndistinguish between the extremely fast carriage of mails and\r\npassengers on the one hand, and freights on the other; and although\r\nthey wish the speed and certainty of steam, yet it is not the costly\r\nspeed. When they know that a given quantity of fuel will carry freight\r\neight knots per hour, they would consider it wasteful and foolish to\r\nconsume twice that quantity of fuel just to carry it ten knots; and\r\nmore especially so, when, in addition to the extra quantity of fuel,\r\nthey would lose just its bulk in paying freight room. England is thus\r\nemploying most of her vast fleet of coasting ocean steamers in her own\r\ntrade, or in the foreign trade lying within a few hundred miles of her\r\nports. And the voyages being short, her coals being cheap and\r\nconvenient, frequently not above three dollars per ton to the\r\ncoasters, and in addition to this, the prime cost of these vessels\r\nbeing smaller than in this country, as both iron and labor are\r\ncheaper, she has found them very profitable at home, and is\r\ninsinuating them into all the short routes wherever she can get a\r\nfoothold. It was not until she attempted the same species of\r\nself-supporting steam navigation with distant countries, that her\r\npropeller system failed her and involved her citizens in loss.\r\nMeanwhile it is more than probable that within the next fifteen years\r\nwe shall find five hundred propellers scattered along the coasts of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the eminent capabilities of steam when applied to\r\ncoast navigation, or to the fluvial navigation of the interior, it has\r\nfailed to make the same triumphs in the carriage of freights and\r\npassengers upon the ocean. And it is not alone because the voyage is\r\nlong and the freights low in price. Steamers carry freights up the\r\nMississippi river two thousand miles from New-Orleans, and find it\r\nprofitable. Some run even as high as three thousand miles up that\r\nriver and the Missouri; a voyage nearly as long as to Europe, and make\r\nmoney by it. But the circumstances are very different. They do not\r\nleave the dock at New-Orleans with even more than enough fuel on board\r\nfor the whole trip, as the ocean steamers do. If they did they could\r\ncarry no freight. But they stop every twelve to eighteen hours and\r\ntake on wood just as they need it, fifty to a hundred cords at a time;\r\nand instead of occupying all of their available room with wood, they\r\nhave the steamer full of cargo, and have on board only fifty or sixty\r\ntons of fuel at a time, and only half that weight on an average. None\r\nof the best steamers on those rivers could take enough wood on board\r\nfor the whole three thousand miles, even though they should not have a\r\nton of freight. And compared with ocean steamers of the same engine\r\npower, they do not cost half of the money, I might say generally, not\r\none third of the money. There is no reason, then, why these steamers\r\nshould not carry large quantities of freight and make large sums of\r\nmoney by it. They have the great elements, fuel, freight capacity, and\r\nprime cost in their favor.\r\n\r\nThere is a large class of freights which are not transportable by\r\nsteam on long ocean voyages under any conditions. We will grant that\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances, where rich and costly articles\r\nare transported in small bulk, that propellers running at a low rate\r\nof speed, or just fast enough to anticipate sailing vessels, will make\r\na living. But change the class of these freights into the great\r\naverage class of those filling the thousands of sailing vessels, and\r\ndeprive these screw vessels of an immense emigrant passenger traffic,\r\nand they would not pay their running expenses by fifty per cent. This\r\nstyle of freights, sailing vessels in their great competition have\r\nreduced to the lowest paying figure. The margin left for profit is so\r\nsmall that our ship-owners constantly complain that unless there are\r\nchanges they must go into other business; and many of them say this\r\nhonestly, as is shown by the hundreds of ships which of late years we\r\ncan always find lying up, awaiting improvement in business. Now, let\r\neven the slowest and cheapest running screw vessel attempt to carry\r\nthe same freights, to say nothing of fast side-wheel mail vessels, and\r\nwe shall see against what odds the screw or other steamer has to\r\ncontend. In the first place, her engines, boilers, coal, etc., occupy\r\nat least forty per cent of her total registered tonnage. Grant that\r\nthe additional expense of a steamer over a sail, that is, wages for\r\nengineers, firemen, coal passers, etc., and finding the same in food\r\nand rooms, costs even no more than the loss of an additional ten per\r\ncent of her freight room. In other words, considering her steam\r\nmachinery, fuel, extra expenses, etc., to be equal to half of her\r\nfreight room, it is evident that she would carry only half as much\r\nfreight as a sailing vessel of the same size, and that she would get\r\nbut half as much money for it.\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear, I think, that there is a certain class of ocean\r\nfreights which steam can not transport under any conditions so long as\r\nthere are sailing vessels on the ocean; and in that class are\r\ncomprehended all the great standard and staple articles of the world,\r\nconstituting in sum seventeen twentieths of all the freight passing\r\nupon the ocean. This being so, it is utterly idle to suppose that\r\nsteam in any form can take the place of sail upon the ocean, even\r\nthough the present prices for the carriage of standard articles should\r\nincrease three hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nThere are many considerations which affect this question. The ordinary\r\naverage passages of the ocean on long voyages are now very rapid; and\r\nsome of the clippers have attained a speed which no freighting steamer\r\nmay ever be expected to do on the high seas. They do not maintain this\r\nhigh speed as an average, but it is sufficiently high for all of the\r\nordinary purposes of transport in the standard articles of commerce,\r\nand where the business of the clipper is done by a fast mail steamer.\r\nThere is no positive necessity for the speedy transport that some have\r\nattempted to give to articles, whose presence in the markets, as the\r\nordinary supplies of life, to-day, next month, or a month later, is a\r\nmatter of total indifference to every one except the ship-owner\r\nhimself. It but little concerns the public whether a cargo of cotton,\r\nor beef or pork, or corn is one month or forty-five days between the\r\nUnited States and England, so that it is safe in the end. It is an\r\nannual production that must have an annual transit, and however\r\nunnecessarily fast we may become, we can not send more than one crop\r\nin the year. The world frequently becomes too fast in every thing; and\r\ncrises, panics, and bankruptcies follow as legitimate consequences.\r\nWhen a fictitious value is given to every thing, and every globule of\r\nair which one has breathed comes puffing out, a splendid bubble, a\r\nmagnificent speculation, and when men have to go so fast that they\r\nneed a telegraph to ride them through the world lest they get behind\r\nthe heated times, no wonder that the shipper can not sit quietly down\r\nin his office and wait thirty days for a load of corn to reach\r\nEngland, or a load of iron to appear in the harbor in return. And it\r\ndoes not matter to him that it may not be used there in six months. He\r\nwishes to finish the \"operation,\" to close up the \"transaction\" before\r\nhe goes up town in the evening.\r\n\r\nThere is a rational distinction between the necessary and the\r\nunnecessary which we must learn to make, and a limit which safety\r\nassigns to every operation. There are some things which must be done\r\nrapidly, and others which may be done at leisure. Between the freight\r\ncargo, and the correspondence which controls it there is a great\r\ndifference. Rapid transport of letters, intelligence, and passengers,\r\nand leisure transport of freight, is the law of nature, and to attempt\r\nto reverse it is but to attempt that which will never be successfully\r\ndone, simply because wholly unnecessary in any permanent economic\r\nsense. And not only is higher speed than that of clippers unnecessary\r\nin ordinary freight transport, but it is clearly impossible in any\r\nnormal condition of trade. Circumstances may, and doubtless often will\r\nexist, which will require some sluggish article to be transported a\r\nlong distance in a short time, as in the case of the famine in\r\nIreland, and which may insure rates at which steam vessels can take\r\nsmall quantities of such freights; but such occasions will ever be\r\naccidental, and the support of vessels depending on them the\r\nquestionable support of expedients, and capricious in the extreme. It\r\nwill ever be just as impossible to hurry gross freights across the\r\nocean in a healthy state of commerce as it will to prevent rapid\r\nmails, or forego the comforts of quick passenger transit.\r\n\r\nTo say nothing of a vessel which is half filled with its own power,\r\nattempting to compete, in the ordinary freights of the world, with one\r\nwhich fills every square foot with paying cargo, it is equally\r\nimportant that we should look at the question of fuel. The coals of\r\nthe world are not so plentiful or so cheap that we should consume\r\nwhole pits in a year in unnecessary and unproductive service. They are\r\nalready beginning to fail in many parts of the world, or to the same\r\neffect, are mined and brought to market at such increasing cost, and\r\napplied to so many new purposes day by day, that in a few years the\r\nprice will place them entirely beyond the reach of commercial purposes\r\nupon the ocean. It is contended, however, that the science of\r\nengineering is also rapidly advancing, and that we shall soon have\r\nsome discovery by which we can have heat without fuel, and power\r\nwithout heat. But I have heard of those imaginary engineering hopes so\r\nlong that I begin to believe them vague, and that we shall yet for a\r\nfew generations measure the power applied by the number of pounds of\r\ncoal consumed. From past experiences and present indications we can\r\npredicate nothing with more certainty of fuel than that it will\r\nindefinitely increase in price. I am satisfied, therefore, that with\r\nall of the capabilities of steam it can never be applied to general\r\nocean transportation; first, because undesirable; and second, because\r\nimpossible even if desirable. But to show more clearly that it is\r\nimpossible, I will now make some inquiries concerning the cost of\r\nocean steam, which is the cardinal point of interest in marine\r\npropulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nCOST OF STEAM: OCEAN MAIL SPEED.\r\n\r\n    MISAPPREHENSION OF THE HIGH COST OF STEAM MARINE PROPULSION: VIEWS\r\n    OF THE NON-PROFESSIONAL: HIGH SPEED NECESSARY FOR THE DISTANCES IN\r\n    OUR COUNTRY: WHAT IS THE COST OF HIGH ADEQUATE MAIL SPEED: FAST\r\n    STEAMERS REQUIRE STRONGER PARTS IN EVERY THING: GREATER OUTLAY IN\r\n    PRIME COST: MORE FREQUENT AND COSTLY REPAIRS: MORE WATCHFULNESS\r\n    AND MEN: MORE COSTLY FUEL, ENGINEERS, FIREMEN, AND COAL-PASSERS:\r\n    GREAT STRENGTH OF HULL REQUIRED: ALSO IN ENGINES, BOILERS, AND\r\n    PARTS: WHY THE PRIME COST INCREASES: THEORY OF REPAIRS: FRICTION\r\n    AND BREAKAGES: BOILERS AND FURNACES BURNING OUT: REPAIRS TWELVE TO\r\n    EIGHTEEN PER CENT: DEPRECIATION: SEVERAL LINES CITED; USES FOR\r\n    MORE MEN: EXTRA FUEL, AND LESS FREIGHT-ROOM: BRITISH TRADE AND\r\n    COAL CONSUMPTION:\r\n\r\n    THE NATURAL LAWS OF RESISTANCE, POWER, AND SPEED, WITH TABLE: THE\r\n    RESISTANCE VARIES AS IS THE SQUARE OF THE VELOCITY: THE POWER, OR\r\n    FUEL, VARIES AS THE CUBE OF THE VELOCITY: THE RATIONALE:\r\n    AUTHORITIES CITED IN PROOF OF THE LAW: EXAMPLES, AND THE FORMULAE:\r\n    COAL-TABLE; NO.

IV.: MR.\r\n    ATHERTON'S VIEWS OF FREIGHT TRANSPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing arguments bring us to the conclusion that steam,\r\nhowever desirable, can not be profitably employed in commerce\r\ngenerally as an agent of transport; and that it is best applicable to\r\nthe rapid conveyance of the mails, passengers, specie, and costly\r\nfreights only. That this fact may be presented in a clearer light, and\r\nthat we may see the almost incredibly high cost of rapid steaming, or\r\nthe attainment of a speed sufficiently high for the carriage of\r\nimportant mails, it will be necessary to make some critical inquiries\r\nconcerning the working cost of steam power, under any conditions, as\r\napplied to marine propulsion. Much misapprehension prevails on this\r\npoint among nearly all classes of the people, and even among the\r\nrulers of the country whose action controls the destiny and uses of\r\nthis valuable power. It is hardly to be expected, however, that\r\ngentlemen engaged actively in the all-engrossing pursuits of business\r\nor of public life, with a thousand different sets of ideas to be\r\nmatured on a thousand different subjects, such as demand the attention\r\nof Congress, and the Departments of the Executive Government, should\r\nbe practically or even theoretically acquainted with a profession\r\nwhich requires years of close application and study, and a wide field\r\nof practical, daily observation and experience. It would be as absurd\r\nfor unprofessional gentlemen of any class, as well from the walks of\r\nstatesmanship and the Government as from those of quiet private life,\r\nto assume an acquaintance with the theory and practice of navigation,\r\nand the cost, embarrassments, and difficulties attending steamship\r\nenterprise, as it would for any two or three of them to enter an ocean\r\nsteamer for the first time of their lives, and essay to work the\r\nengines and navigate the ship across the seas. The skill and knowledge\r\nrequisite for such a task would require years of application; and it\r\ncan not be reasonably supposed that those entirely unacquainted with\r\nthe theory and parts of an engine, should know much about its\r\ncapabilities, or the cost attending its use.\r\n\r\nBut there are approximate conclusions, readily applicable to\r\npractice, at which even the unprofessional can arrive with certainty\r\nand security on a proper presentation of the prominent facts and\r\ntheories concerned; and that these may be given to the public in a\r\nreliable and intelligible form, for the removal of the doubts and\r\nobscurities which have hung around the subject, is the chief object of\r\nthis publication. This inquiry becomes the more important as the speed\r\nof American steamers is proverbially beyond that of any other steam\r\nvessels in the world. From the first conception of fluvial and marine\r\nsteam propulsion by Fitch and Fulton, the public and the inventors\r\nthemselves regarded the new application of this power with the more\r\nfavor as it promised to be a means of shortening the long distances\r\nbetween the different parts of our own large country. And the same\r\nobject has acted as a stimulus ever since to that increase of speed\r\nwhich has placed localities all over this country, hitherto days\r\napart, now, probably, but as many hours. The slow trip through marshes\r\nand rivers, over hills and mountains, and by the meandering roads of\r\nthe country, between New-York and Albany, once required from four to\r\nsix days; but the attainment of twenty-five miles per hour in our fast\r\nriver steamers has at length placed that capital within six hours of\r\nthe Metropolis. And, as in this instance, so has the effort been\r\nthroughout our whole country, and upon the ocean, until we have\r\nattained, both upon the rivers and the high seas, the highest speed\r\nyet known, notwithstanding the important fact that steamship building\r\nis a new and not fully developed species of enterprise in this\r\ncountry. We have already seen how imperatively the spirit of the age\r\nand the genius of our people demand rapid steam mails by both land and\r\nsea, and a rapid conveyance of passengers; and it would be\r\nunreasonable to suppose that if we required these for the development\r\nof our youth, they would be less necessary for the fruitful uses of\r\nmanhood and maturity. It is abundantly evident that the American\r\npeople are by nature and habit a progressive and unusually hurrying\r\npeople; and it is not to be supposed that they will reverse this\r\nconstitutional law of their nature in their attempts at ocean\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nTo answer the question, \"What is the cost of high, adequate mail\r\nspeed?\" requires something more than an inquiry into the quantity of\r\nfuel consumed; although this is the principal element of its cost. We\r\nmust consider that the attainment and maintenance of high speed depend\r\nupon the exertion of a high power; and that,\r\n\r\nI. High speed and power require stronger parts in every thing: in the\r\nship's build, the machinery, the boilers, and all of the working\r\narrangements:\r\n\r\nII. High speed and power require a larger outlay in prime cost, in\r\nmaterial and building, for the adequate resistance required by such\r\npower:\r\n\r\nIII. High speed and power require more frequent and costly repairs:\r\n\r\nIV. High speed and power require more watchfulness, a more prompt\r\naction, and consequently more persons:\r\n\r\nV. High speed and power require more fuel, more engineers, more\r\nfiremen, and more coal-stokers.\r\n\r\n1. These propositions are nearly all self-evident to every class of\r\nmind. That a high speed attained through the exertion of a high power\r\nwill require stronger parts in every thing that exerts a force or\r\nresists one, is as manifest as that a force necessary to remove one\r\nton of weight will have to be doubled to remove two tons. In the prime\r\nconstruction of the hull this is as requisite as in any other part.\r\nThe resistance to a vessel, or the concussion against the water, at a\r\nlow rate of speed, will not be very sensibly felt; but if that speed\r\nis considerably increased and the concussion made quicker without a\r\ncorresponding increase in the strength of the frame and hull of the\r\nship generally, we shall find the ship creaking, straining, and\r\nyielding to the pressure, until finally it works itself to pieces, and\r\nalso disconcerts the engines, whose stability, bracing, and keeping\r\nproper place and working order depend first and essentially on the\r\npermanence and stability of the hull. If the resistance to a vessel in\r\npassing through the water increases as the square of the velocity, and\r\nif in addition to this outward thrust against the vessel it has to\r\nsupport the greater engine power within it, which has increased as the\r\ncube of the velocity, then the strength of the vessel must be adequate\r\nto resist without injury these two combined forces against which it\r\nhas to contend.\r\n\r\nThe same increased strength is necessary also in the engines and\r\nboilers. It is admitted by the ablest engineers, and verified by\r\npractice, as will be shown in another part of this Section, that to\r\nincrease the speed of a steamer from eight to ten knots per hour, it\r\nis necessary to double the power, and so on in the ratio of the cubes\r\nof the velocity. Suppose that we wish to gain these two knots advance\r\non eight. It is evident that, if the boilers have to generate, and the\r\nengines to use twice the power, and exert twice the force, they must\r\nhave also twice the strength. The boiler must be twice as strong and\r\nheavy; the various working parts of the engine must be twice as\r\nstrong: the shafts, the cranks, the piston and other rods, the beams,\r\nthe cylinders, the frame work, whether of wood or iron, and even the\r\niron wheels themselves, with every thing in any way employed to use\r\nthe power, overcome the resistance, and gain the speed. There is no\r\nworking arrangement in any way connected with the propulsion of the\r\nship that does not partake of this increase; every pump, every valve,\r\nevery bolt connected directly or indirectly with the engine economy of\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\n2. In the second place, seeing that much greater strength of parts is\r\nrequired to overcome the increased resistance, it is equally evident\r\nthat this high speed and power thus require a larger outlay in every\r\npoint of the prime construction of the vessel and engines by which the\r\nspeed is to be attained. The hull's heavier timbers cost a higher\r\nprice according to size than the direct proportion of size indicates.\r\nLarge and choice timbers are difficult to get, and costly. The hull\r\nmust also be strengthened to a large extra extent by heavy iron\r\nstrapping and bracing, which, unlike the rest, cost in the ratio of\r\nthe material used. So with the engines. The shaft, which weighs twice\r\nas much, does not cost only twice as much, but frequently three or\r\nfour or five times as much. This arises not from the weight of the\r\nmetal, as is evident; but from the difficulty of forging pieces that\r\nare so large. The persons engaged in the forging and finishing of the\r\nimmense shafts, cranks, pistons, etc., used in our first class\r\nsteamers, frequently consider that the last and largest piece is the\r\n_chef d'oeuvre_ of the art, and that it will never be transcended,\r\neven if equalled again. They have expended all of their skill and\r\ningenuity in the task, and have not succeeded sometimes until they\r\nhave forged two or three new pieces. When a great work of this kind is\r\ndone, it may be discovered in the turning, polishing, and fitting up,\r\nthat it has at last a flaw, and that it will not do for the service\r\nintended. As a matter of course, it must be thrown aside and a new\r\npiece forged. This was but recently the case with one of the shafts of\r\nthe \"Leviathan,\" in England. So with the shafts of the new Collins'\r\nsteamer \"Adriatic.\" They were forged in Reading, Pennsylvania, and in\r\naddition to their enormous prime cost had to incur that of shipment\r\nfrom the interior of Pennsylvania to the city of New-York. In all such\r\ncases the prime cost increases immensely, and to an extent that would\r\nhardly be credited by those not practically familiar with the subject.\r\n\r\n3. Again, high or increased power and speed require more frequent and\r\nmore costly repairs. Friction arises from the pressure of two bodies\r\nmoving in opposite directions, and pressure results from the exertion\r\nof power, and in the ratio of the power applied. The amount of\r\nfriction, therefore, is in the ratio of the power expended and of the\r\nextra weight of parts required for that power. But the effects of\r\nfriction require a higher ratio when the power is greatly multiplied,\r\nas in the case of high speed. An immensely heavy shaft exerting an\r\nunusual force is certain to greatly heat the journals and boxes, and\r\nthus wear them away far more rapidly. Also a rapid motion of heavy\r\nparts of machinery, and the necessarily severe concussions and\r\njarrings can not fail destroying costly working parts in the engine,\r\nand necessitating heavy and expensive repairs and substitutions. An\r\nordinary engine working at a slow and easy rate, will not require one\r\ntenth the repairs necessary if it were working up to a high power and\r\naccomplishing a high speed. With any little derangement the engines\r\ncan stop and the injury can be repaired before it reaches any\r\nmagnitude. But with rapid mail packets the engines must run on, and\r\nthe derangement which at first is small, will amount in the end, when\r\nthe voyage is completed and the mails are delivered, to a sum probably\r\nten or twenty times as great as in the case of the vessel that stops\r\nand makes her repairs as she requires them. The exertion of a high\r\nmail power causes many costly parts to burn out from unrelieved\r\npressure and friction, which would not be the case under other\r\nconditions. It is also nearly impossible for the best built engines in\r\nthe world to make fast time without breaking some important part at\r\nevery trip or two, or so cracking and injuring it from the continued\r\nstrain, that a wise precaution requires its removal to make the\r\nsteamer perfectly sea-worthy. Every practical man knows these\r\ndifficulties, and every steamship owner estimates their importance\r\naccording to the immense bills they occasion month by month, or the\r\ndelays and losses which they cause unless he has expended large\r\namounts of capital in providing other ships to take their place on\r\nsuch occasions of derangement.\r\n\r\nNor is the burning out of heavy brass, and composition, and steel\r\npieces, or the breaking of large and troublesome parts in the engine\r\nthe only source of repairs on a steamship. The boiler department is\r\nparticularly fruitful in large bills of repairs, especially if it be\r\nnecessary to attain a good mail speed. It stands to reason that if the\r\nwhole ship can not be filled with boiler power, which with reasonably\r\nhigh fires, would give enough steam, then the boilers which are used\r\nmust be exerted to their highest capacity, or the rapid speed can not\r\nbe attained. Many suppose that the boilers may generate twice the\r\nquantity of steam without any appreciable difference in the wear and\r\ntear; but this is a decided error. For high speed, and what I mean by\r\nhigh speed is simply that which gives a sufficiently rapid transit to\r\nthe mails, the fires must be nurtured up to their highest intensity\r\nand every pound of coal must be burned in every corner of the furnaces\r\nwhich will generate even an ounce of steam. This continued heat\r\nbecomes too powerful for the furnaces and the boilers, and they begin\r\nto oxidize, and burn, and melt away, as would never be the case under\r\nordinary heat. When the ship comes into port it is found that her\r\nfurnaces must be \"overhauled,\" her grate bars renewed, her braces\r\nrestored, her boilers patched, sometimes all over, several of their\r\nplates taken out, thousands of rivets removed and supplied, and\r\nprobably dozens of tubes also removed and replaced with new ones. But\r\nthis is not all. The best boilers can not long run in this way. After\r\nsix to seven years at the utmost, they must be removed from the ship\r\naltogether, and new ones must be put into their place. This is also a\r\nmost expensive operation. The boilers constitute a large share of the\r\ncost of the engine power. To put a new set of boilers in one of the\r\nCollins steamers will cost about one hundred and ten thousand dollars,\r\nand this must be done every six years. The boilers of the West-India\r\nRoyal Mail Steamers, which run very slowly, last on an average, six\r\nyears.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Statement by Mr. Pitcher, builder, before the Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons. Murray on the _Steam Engine_, p. 170, Second\r\nEdition.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. To restore the boilers, a ship has to be torn\r\nliterally almost to pieces. All of the decks in that part must be\r\nremoved and lost; the frame of the ship cut to pieces; large and\r\ncostly timbers removed, and altogether an expense incurred that is\r\nfrightful even to the largest companies. To insure perfect safety and\r\nto gratify the wish of the public, this is generally done long before\r\nit is strictly necessary, and when the boilers are in a perfectly good\r\ncondition for the working purposes of ordinary speed. But precaution\r\nand safety are among the prerequisites of the public service, and must\r\nbe attained at whatever cost. On slow auxiliary freighting steamers\r\nthis would be by no means necessary. But the extent and cost of these\r\nrepairs on steamers far exceed any thing that would be imagined. They\r\nare supposed to be twelve per cent. per annum of the prime cost of a\r\nvessel of ordinary speed, taking the whole ship's life together at\r\ntwelve years at the utmost. Atherton in his \"Marine Engine\r\nConstruction and Classification,\" page 32, says of the repairs of\r\nsteam vessels doing ordinary service in Great Britain, where all such\r\nwork is done much cheaper than in this country: \"By the Parliamentary\r\nevidence of the highest authorities on this point, it appears to have\r\nbeen conclusively established, that the cost of upholding steamship\r\nmachinery has of late years amounted, on the average, to about L6 per\r\nhorse power per annum, being about 12 per cent. per annum, on the\r\nprime cost of the machinery, which annual outlay is but one of the\r\ngrand points of current expense in which steamship proprietors are\r\nconcerned.\" Now, if these were the repairs of the slow West-India\r\nRoyal mail steamers, which ran but 200 days in the year, and that at a\r\nvery moderate speed, and in the machine shops of England, where at\r\nthat time (previous to 1852) wages were very low, they can not be less\r\nin this country, on rapid mail steamers, where wages and materials are\r\nvery high, and where marine engineering was then in its infancy.\r\n\r\nThere are some facts on this subject which prove the positions here\r\ntaken. The Collins steamers have been running but six years, and yet\r\ntheir repairs have amounted in all to more than the prime cost of the\r\nships, or to about eighteen per cent. per annum. They were as well and\r\nas strongly built originally as any ships in the world, as appears\r\nfrom the report which Commodore M. C. Perry made to the Department\r\nregarding them, and from the fine condition of their hulls at the\r\npresent time. Their depreciation with all of these repairs has not\r\nbeen probably above six per cent. per annum. They will, however,\r\nprobably depreciate ten per cent. during the next six years, and at\r\nthe age of twelve or fourteen years be unfit for service. The steamers\r\nWashington and Hermann, which had strong hulls, have been run eight\r\nyears, and are now nearly worthless. Their depreciation has been at\r\nleast ten per cent. The steamers Georgia and Ohio, which Commodore\r\nPerry and other superintending navy agents pronounced to be well-built\r\nand powerful steamers, (_See Report Sec. Navy_, 1852,) ran only five\r\nyears, and were laid aside, and said to be worthless. With all of the\r\nrepairs put upon these ships, which were admitted to be capable of\r\ndoing first class war service, as intended, they depreciated probably\r\nseventeen per cent.; as it is hardly possible that their old iron\r\nwould sell for more than fifteen per cent. of their prime cost. These\r\nsteamers paid much smaller repair bills than the Collins, and were not\r\nso well constructed, or at so high a cost. American steamers do not,\r\nupon the average, last above ten years; but if they reach twelve or\r\nfourteen, they will pay a sum nearly equal to twice their cost, for\r\nrepairs and substitutions. Nor is this all. The life of a steamer ends\r\nwhen her adaptation to profitable service ceases. She may not be\r\nrotten, but may be so slow, or of so antiquated construction, or may\r\nburn so much more fuel than more modern competitors, that she can not\r\nstand the test of competition.\r\n\r\n4. We thus see that not only are the requisite repairs most extensive\r\nand costly, but of such magnitude as to greatly reduce the earnings of\r\nany class of steam vessels. But this is not the last costly\r\nconsequence of mail speed. It requires more cautious watchfulness of\r\nthe engines, the boilers, the deck, and of every possible department\r\nof the navigation, even including pilotage. It requires also more\r\npromptness and dispatch in every movement, and hence a much larger\r\naggregate number of men. More men are necessary to keep up high fires;\r\ntwice as many men are necessary to pass twice as much coal; twice as\r\nmany engineers as under other circumstances are necessary for the\r\nfaithful working of the engines, and any accidents and repairs which\r\nare indispensable on the ocean; and a larger number of sailors and\r\nofficers is necessary to all of the prompt movements required of the\r\nmail steamer. The Havre mail steamers, the \"Arago\" and \"Fulton,\" never\r\ncarry less than six engineers each, although they could be run across\r\nthe ocean with three under a hard working system. But this number\r\ninsures the greater safety of the ship under ordinary circumstances,\r\nand is absolutely necessary in any case of accident and danger. It is\r\nthe same case with the firemen. When, in a heavy storm, the fire\r\ndepartment may be imperfectly manned, the ship has taken one of the\r\nfirst chances for rendering the engines inefficient, and being finally\r\nlost. And all of these extra and indispensable _employees_ make an\r\nextra drain on the income of the ship, and add to the extreme\r\ncostliness of a high adequate mail speed.\r\n\r\n5. It is clear, then, that an adequate mail speed requires more fuel,\r\nmore engineers, more firemen, more coal-stokers, and more general\r\nexpense. The question of fuel is, however, alone the most important of\r\nall those affecting the attainment of high speed, and the item whose\r\neconomy has been most desired and sought, both by those attempting to\r\ncarry freight, and those who carry the mails and passengers. The\r\nprincipal points of interests concerning it are, the enormous quantity\r\nwhich both theory and practice show to be necessary to fast vessels;\r\nthe large sum to be paid for it, and the steadily increasing price;\r\nand the paying freight room which its necessary carriage occupies. In\r\nfast steaming, the supply of coal to the furnaces frequently arrives\r\nat a point where many additional tons may be burned and yet produce no\r\nuseful effect or increase of power. The draft through the furnaces and\r\nsmoke stacks is so rapid and strong as to take off a vast volume of\r\nheat; and this, coupled with a large quantity of heat radiated from\r\nthe various highly heated parts and surfaces, requires a consumption\r\nof fuel truly astonishing. If we reflect that at the twelve principal\r\nports of Great Britain in the year of 1855, the tonnage entered was\r\n6,372,301, and departed 6,426,566, equal to 12,798,867 total, and this\r\nduring the war, that a large part of this was steam tonnage, and that\r\nthe total imports and exports of Great Britain for 1856 were\r\n1,600,000,000 dollars, we can somewhat appreciate the present and\r\nfuture uses of coal, and its inevitably large increase in price. The\r\ntwo hundred and seventy steamers in the British Navy, with about\r\n50,000 aggregate horse power, consumed in 1856, according to a report\r\nmade to a Committee of the \"British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience,\" this year, by Rear-Admiral Moorsom, 750,000 tons of coal.\r\nThe difficulty and cost of mining coal, its distance from the\r\nsea-shore, and the multifarious new applications in its use among our\r\nrapidly increasing population, as well as its almost universal and\r\nincreasing demand for marine purposes, all conspire to make it more\r\ncostly from year to year; while, as a propelling agent, it is already\r\nbeyond the reach of commercial ocean steam navigation. Coal has gone\r\nup by a steady march during the last seven years from two and a half\r\nto eight dollars per ton, which may now be regarded as a fair average\r\nprice along our Atlantic seaboard. And that we may see more clearly\r\nhow essentially the speed and cost of steam marine navigation depend\r\nupon the simple question of fuel alone, to say nothing further of the\r\nimpeding causes heretofore mentioned, I will now present a few\r\ninquiries concerning\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL LAWS OF RESISTANCE, POWER, AND SPEED,\r\n\r\nWITH TABLES OF THE SAME.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to bodies moving through the water increases as the\r\nsquare of the velocity; and the power, or coal, necessary to produce\r\nspeed varies or increases as the cube of the velocity. This is a law\r\nfounded in nature, and verified by facts and universal experience. Its\r\nenunciation is at first startling to those who have not reflected on\r\nthe subject, and who as a general thing suppose that, if a vessel will\r\nrun 8 miles per hour on a given quantity of coal, she ought to run 16\r\nmiles per hour on double that quantity. I think that it may be safely\r\nasserted that in all cases of high speed, and ordinary dynamic or\r\nworking efficiency in the ship, the resistance increases more rapidly\r\nthan as the squares. The _rationale_ of the law is this: the power\r\nnecessary to overcome the resistance of the water at the vessel's bow\r\nand the friction increases as the square; again, the power necessary\r\nto overcome the natural inertia of the vessel and set it in motion,\r\nincreases this again as the square of the velocity, and the two\r\ntogether constitute the aggregate resistance which makes it necessary\r\nthat the power for increasing a vessel's speed shall increase as the\r\ncube of the velocity. But whatever the _rationale_, the law itself is\r\nan admitted fact by all theoretical engineers, and is proven in\r\npractice by all steamships. In evidence of this, I will give the\r\nfollowing opinions.\r\n\r\nIn his treatise on \"The Marine Engine,\" Mr. Robert Murray, who is a\r\nmember of the Board of Trade in Southampton, England, says in speaking\r\nof the \"Natural law regulating the speed of a steamer,\" page 104:\r\n\"These results chiefly depend upon the natural law that _the power\r\nexpended in propelling a steamship through the water varies as the\r\ncube of the velocity_. This law is modified by the retarding effect of\r\nthe _increased resisting surface_, consequent upon the weight of the\r\nengines and fuel, so that the horse power increases in a somewhat\r\nhigher ratio than that named.\" It must be understood that when he\r\nspeaks of power, horse power, etc., it is simply another form of\r\nrepresenting the quantity of coal burned; as the power is in the\r\ndirect ratio of the quantity of fuel.\r\n\r\nBourne, the great Scotch writer upon the Screw Propeller, in his large\r\nvolume published by Longmans, London, page 145, says, in concluding a\r\nsentence on the expensiveness of vessels: \"Since it is known that the\r\nresistance of vessels increases more rapidly than the square of the\r\nvelocity in the case of considerable speeds.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, at page 236, on \"the resistance of bodies moving through the\r\nwater,\" he says: \"In the case of very sharp vessels, the resistance\r\nappears to increase nearly as the square of the velocity, but in case\r\nof vessels of the ordinary amount of sharpness the resistance\r\nincreases more rapidly than the square of the velocity.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on page 231, in speaking of the folly of a company attempting\r\nto run steamers sufficiently rapidly for the mails at the price paid\r\nfor them, he says: \"At the same time an increased rate of speed has to\r\nbe maintained, which is, of course, tantamount to a further reduction\r\nof the payment. In fact, their position upon the Red Sea line is now\r\nthis, that they would be better without the mails than with them, as\r\nthe mere expense of the increased quantity of fuel necessary to\r\nrealize the increased speed which they have undertaken to maintain,\r\nwill swallow up the whole of the Government subvention. _To increase\r\nthe speed of a vessel from 8 to 10 knots it is necessary that the\r\nengine power should be doubled._\" This work of Mr. Bourne is now the\r\nstandard of authority on the subject of which he treats, the world\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. James R. Napier, of London, known as one of the largest and\r\nmost skilled engine-builders in Great Britain, in the discussion of\r\nthe dynamic efficiency of steamships in the proceedings of the\r\n\"British Association\" in 1856, page 436, says: \"_The power in similar\r\nvessels, I here take for granted, at present varies as the cube of the\r\nvelocity._\" The power simply represents the coal; in fact, it is the\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Atherton, the able and distinguished Chief Engineer of Her\r\nMajesty's Royal Dock Yard, at Woolwich, has published a volume, called\r\n\"Steamship Capability,\" a smaller volume on \"Marine Engine\r\nClassification,\" and several elaborate papers for the British\r\nAssociation, the Society of Arts, London, the Association of Civil\r\nEngineers, and the Artisans' Journal, for the purpose of properly\r\nexposing the high cost of steam freight transport as based on the law\r\nabove noticed, and the ruinous expense of running certain classes of\r\nvessels of an inferior dynamic efficiency. When but a few weeks since\r\nin London, I asked the Editor of the \"Artisan,\" if any engineer in\r\nEngland disputed the laws relative to power, on which Mr. Atherton\r\nbased his arguments. He replied that he had never heard of one who\r\ndid. I asked Mr. Atherton myself, if in the case of the newest and\r\nmost improved steamers, with the best possible models for speed, he\r\nhad ever found any defect in the law of, the resistance as the\r\nsquares, and the power as the cubes of the velocity. He replied that\r\nhe had not; and that he regarded the law as founded in nature, and had\r\neverywhere seen it verified in practice in the many experiments which\r\nit was his duty to conduct with steam vessels in and out of the Royal\r\nNavy. I think, therefore, that with all of these high authorities, the\r\ndoctrine will be admitted as a law of power and speed, and\r\nconsequently of the consumption of coal and the high cost of running\r\nsteamers at mail speeds.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose here to discuss this law, or treat generally or\r\nspecially of the theory of steam navigation. It will suffice that I\r\npoint out clearly its existence and the prominent methods of its\r\napplication only, as these are necessary to the general deduction\r\nwhich I propose making, that rapid steamships can not support\r\nthemselves on their own receipts. The general reader can pass over\r\nthese formulae to p. 69, and look at their results.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. TO FIND THE CONSUMPTION OF FUEL NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE SPEED OF\r\nA STEAMER.\r\n\r\nSuppose that a steamer running eight miles per hour consumes forty\r\ntons of coal per day: how much coal will she consume per day at nine\r\nmiles per hour? The calculation is as follows:\r\n\r\n8^3 : 9^3 :: 40 : required consumption, which is, 56.95 tons. Here the\r\nspeed has increased 12-1/2 per cent., while the quantity of fuel\r\nconsumed increased 42-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nSuppose, again, that we wish to increase the speed from 8 to 10, and\r\nfrom 8 to 16 miles per hour. The formula stands the same, thus:\r\n\r\n    Miles.  Miles.  Tons Coal.       Tons Coal.\r\n     8^3  :  10^3  ::  40  :  _x_,  =  78.1\r\n     8^3  :  16^3  ::  40  :  _x_,  =  320.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. TO FIND THE SPEED CORRESPONDING TO A DIMINISHED CONSUMPTION OF\r\nFUEL.\r\n\r\nMurray has given some convenient formulae, which I will here adopt.\r\nSuppose a vessel of 500 horse power run 12 knots per hour on 40 tons\r\ncoal per day: what will be the speed if she burn only 30 tons per day?\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n               40 : 30 :: 12^3 : V^3 (or cube of the required velocity,)\r\n  Or, reduced,  4 :  3 :: 1728 : V^3,\r\n  Equation,     3 x 1728 = 5184 = 4V^3,\r\n                       Or, 5184/4 =\r\n              Cube root of 1296 = 10.902 knots = V, required velocity.\r\n\r\nThus, we reduce the quantity of coal one fourth, but the speed is\r\nreduced but little above one twelfth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. RELATION BETWEEN THE CONSUMPTION OF FUEL, AND THE LENGTH AND\r\nVELOCITY OF VOYAGE.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of fuel on two or more given voyages will vary as the\r\nsquare of the velocity multiplied into the distance travelled. Thus,\r\nduring a voyage of 1200 miles, average speed 10 knots, the consumption\r\nof coal is 150 tons: we wish to know the consumption for 1800 miles at\r\n8 knots. Thus:\r\n\r\n    150 tons : C required Consumption :: 10^2 knots x 1200 miles : 8^2,\r\n             Knots x 1800 miles.\r\n    Then,   C x 100 x 1200 = 150 x 64 x 1800,*\r\n    Or,        C x 120,000 = 17,280,000\r\n    Reduced to           C = 1728/12 = 144 tons consumption.\r\n\r\nSuppose, again, that we wish to know the rate of speed for 1800 miles,\r\nif the coals used be the same as on another voyage of 1200 miles, with\r\n150 tons coal, and ten knots speed:\r\n\r\nWe substitute former consumption, 150 tons for C, as in the equation\r\nabove, marked *, and V^2 (square of the required velocity) for 64, and\r\nhave,\r\n\r\n        150 x 100 x 1200 = 150 x V^2 x 1800,\r\n    Or,          120,000 = 1800V^2,\r\n    Reduced,     1200/18 = V^2,\r\n    And                V = square root of 66.66 = 8.15 knots.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing easily intelligible formulae we can ascertain with\r\napproximate certainty the large quantity of coal necessary to increase\r\nspeed, the large saving of coal in reducing speed, as well as the\r\nmeans of accommodating the fuel to the voyage, or the voyage to the\r\nfuel. It is not necessary here to study very closely the economy of\r\nfuel, as this is a question affecting the transport of freight alone.\r\nWhen the mails are to be transported, economy of fuel is not the\r\nobject desired, but speed; and, consequently, we must submit to\r\nextravagance of fuel. This large expenditure of coal is not necessary\r\nin the case of freights, as they may be transported slowly, and,\r\nconsequently, cheaply. But one of the principal reasons for rapid\r\ntransport of the mails is that they may largely anticipate freights in\r\ntheir time of arrival, and consequently control their movements.\r\n\r\nI recently had an excellent opportunity of testing the large quantity\r\nof fuel saved on a slight reduction of the speed, and give it as\r\nillustrative of the law advanced. We were on the United States Mail\r\nsteamer \"Fulton,\" Captain Wotton, and running at 13 miles per hour.\r\nSome of the tubes became unfit for use in one of the boilers, and the\r\nfires were extinguished and the steam and water drawn off from this\r\nboiler, leaving the other one, of the same size, to propel the ship.\r\nAn intelligent gentleman who happened to know that we were using only\r\none boiler, and consequently, but half the power, remarked to me that\r\nit was very strange that the ship was still going about eleven miles\r\nper hour, without any sail. He said: \"It is strange, sir; two boilers\r\nof equal size drove us thirteen miles per hour; and here now but one\r\nboiler drives us nearly eleven miles, or nearly as fast; when\r\ncommon-sense teaches that the one boiler would drive us only six and a\r\nhalf miles per hour. How is that?\" I then explained to him very\r\nclearly the natural law relative to power and speed, (_See Rule II.,\r\npage 68_,) which he at once comprehended and admitted, but with the\r\nremark: \"Indeed, sir, I would have testified that she ought with one\r\nboiler to have gone at only half the speed; or that going at six miles\r\nwith one boiler, she would go twelve with two.\"\r\n\r\nAs it will be interesting to the general reader to examine the details\r\nof the increased consumption of fuel at increased rates of speed, I\r\npresent the following elaborate table recently prepared by Mr.\r\nAtherton for his new edition of \"Steamship Capability,\" according to\r\nthe formula above noticed, and the performance of the best type of\r\nvessel in the Royal Navy, the steamer \"Rattler.\" Mr. A. found a higher\r\nefficiency in this vessel per horse power than any other in the Navy,\r\nand consequently based the consumption of coal in the table on the\r\nassumption that the mail and passenger vessels generally should be of\r\nas good contractive type as \"Rattler.\" I shall present also another\r\ntable showing a much larger consumption of fuel by an inferior type of\r\nvessel. I use these tables because they are thoroughly correct, and\r\nquite as perfect as any that I could construct on the same formula;\r\nand because they carry with them the weight of probably the highest\r\nauthority in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL TABLE: No. I.\r\n\r\n_Displacement,[B] Speed, and Fuel consumed per Day, for Mail,\r\nPassenger, and Freight Steamers, whose locomotive performance is equal\r\nto that of the best class of ocean steam vessels; assuming the\r\nconsumption of fuel to be 4-1/2 lbs. per indicated horse power per\r\nhour, equal to 33,000 lbs. raised one foot in one minute.

Let us\r\nfind in the left hand column a vessel of 2,500 tons displacement.\r\nPursuing the line along to the right we find in the second column 8.89\r\ntons of coal, which a steamer of this displacement would burn in 24\r\nhours, if running, as indicated at the head of the column, 6 Nautical\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nIn the next column, under the head of 7 Nautical miles per hour, we\r\nfind that she would burn in one day 14.1 tons; or one and a half times\r\nas much coal to gain one sixth more speed:\r\n\r\nAgain, at 8 miles per hour she burns 21.1 tons; nearly three times as\r\nmuch as at six miles:\r\n\r\nAt 9 miles she burns 30 tons: above twice as much as at 7, and nearly\r\nfour times as much as at 6, although the speed is but half doubled:\r\n\r\nAt 10 miles per hour she burns 41.2 tons; about twice as much as at 8\r\nmiles, although the speed is increased only one fourth. At 10 she\r\nburns 34 per cent. more than at 9, although the increase of speed is\r\nonly eleven per cent. (_See pages 67 and 68_):\r\n\r\nAt 11 miles per hour she will burn 54.8 or 55 tons; nearly three times\r\nas much as at 8 miles per hour, and six times as much as at 6 miles\r\nper hour:\r\n\r\nAt 12 miles per hour she will burn 71.2; about thirty per cent. more\r\nthan at eleven miles per hour, although gaining but 9 per cent. in\r\nspeed; nearly twice as much as at ten miles per hour, three and a half\r\ntimes as much as at 8, five times as much as at 7, and above eight\r\ntimes as much as at 6 miles per hour. It is here seen that to double\r\nthe speed the consumption of fuel has increased eight-fold, which\r\nverifies my statements hitherto made on this subject. We have already\r\nseen that to gain two miles of speed on any stated speed, it was\r\nnecessary to double the quantity of fuel used.\r\n\r\nAt 13 miles per hour she burns 90.5 tons. This is burning two and a\r\nfourth times as much coal as if she ran only 10 miles per hour. Now,\r\nat this speed, the steamer will reach Southampton or Liverpool in 10\r\ndays and 6 hours, which is equivalent to 10 days and 12 hours burning\r\nfuel, allowing six hours for heating and starting, and which would\r\nmake an aggregate consumption of 950 tons of coal for the passage of\r\nthis steamer of 2,500 displacement or probably 3,000 tons register.\r\n\r\nAt 14 miles per hour she burns 113 tons. This is nearly three times as\r\nmuch as 10 miles per hour. At this speed the steamer would reach\r\nSouthampton or Liverpool in 9 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes,\r\nsupposing the distance to be 3,200 miles from New-York, or say 9 days\r\n18-1/2 hours coal-burning time, and would consume an aggregate of\r\n1,104-1/2 tons. As this is but little above the distance from New-York\r\nto Southampton, and under that from Panama to California, and about\r\nthe tonnage of the steamers running, the time being within eleven days\r\ngenerally, it will be seen how large is the cost of running the\r\nsteamers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, those on the European\r\nroutes, and also those between New-York and Aspinwall. As the route of\r\nthe Havre and Bremen steamers is much longer, they are compelled to\r\nrun slightly slower, or they would be filled up with their own fuel\r\nand power. Taking a Collins steamer of 3,000 tons, which we find in\r\nthe line below, and we see that in running 14 miles per hour as they\r\nhave frequently done, the consumption would be 128 tons per day, or\r\n1,252 tons for the passage. And yet, one of those steamers could make\r\n12 miles per hour on 80.4 tons per day, or at 11 miles per hour on\r\n61.9, or less than half that used at 14. But pursuing this table we\r\nsee that,\r\n\r\nAt 15 miles per hour she would burn 139 tons, or three and a half\r\ntimes as much as at 10 miles.\r\n\r\nAt 16 miles per hour she would burn 169 tons, or precisely eight\r\ntimes as much as at 8 miles per hour. Here again doubling the speed is\r\nfound to be an enormous expense.\r\n\r\nAt 17 miles per hour she burns 202 tons per day.\r\n\r\nAt 18 miles per hour the consumption is 240 tons per day.\r\n\r\nAt 19 miles per hour she burns 283 tons coal per day; and\r\n\r\nAt 20 miles per hour she burns 329 tons per day. At 20 miles per hour\r\nshe would run 480 miles per day, a thing as yet wholly unheard of, and\r\nwould consume on the voyage of 6 days and 16 hours, say 6 days and 22\r\nhours, 2,276 tons of coal. It would be clearly impossible for her to\r\ncarry her own fuel; as the immense boiler and engine power necessary\r\nto secure this speed would of itself fill a ship of this size, to say\r\nnothing of the fuel which also would nearly fill it. Then, we may\r\nnever expect any such ship to attain any such speed as seventeen,\r\neighteen, or twenty miles per hour on so long a voyage without\r\nrecoaling.\r\n\r\nSeeing thus the enormous increase in the consumption of fuel for a\r\nmoderate increase in the speed, we are enabled the better to\r\nappreciate the large expense incurred in running ocean steamers\r\nsufficiently rapidly for successful mail and passenger purposes. We\r\nwill further pursue these inquiries by examining in this table the\r\nconsumption for vessels of 6,000 tons, which would make the\r\ndisplacement of the ship nearly 5,000 tons, such as the \"Adriatic,\"\r\nthe \"Vanderbilt,\" and the \"Niagara.\" It appears that at 8 miles per\r\nhour they would consume 33 tons per day; at 10 miles, 65 tons; at 12\r\nmiles, 113 tons; at 13 miles, 144 tons; at 14 miles, 179 tons; at 15\r\nmiles, 221 tons; and at 16 miles, 268 tons per day. This is supposing\r\nthis speed to be maintained on an average across the ocean, in all\r\nkinds of weather, which this size of steamer could not do without\r\nmore engine and boiler power than any of them have. With such\r\nadditional power the ships noticed would have scarcely any available\r\nroom for freight or any thing else. One thing is very clear from this\r\ntable, that when steamers run at very moderately slow rates of speed,\r\ntheir consumption of fuel is very small; and that when they leave this\r\nlow freighting speed, for that of the necessarily rapid mails and\r\npassengers, the consumption increases to an extent and with a rapidity\r\nthat would seem almost incredible at first view.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL TABLE: No. II.\r\n\r\n_The following coal table is constructed in all respects as the\r\npreceding, but for a lower type of vessels, or those whose coefficient\r\nof Dynamic performance is inferior to that upon which the previous\r\ntable is estimated.

There is also given the working\r\nor indicated horse power, and the nominal horse-power, or that of\r\n33,000 lbs. raised a foot in a minute, which is the general basis of\r\nmaking contracts. It is a fact, however, that engines generally work\r\nup to three or four times their nominal horse power; so that the word\r\nhorse power has no positive or useful meaning. Vessels called one\r\nhundred nominal horse-power have been known to work up to six hundred.\r\n\r\nLet us take a ship of 5,000 tons. We find that at 8 miles per hour the\r\nhorse power is 436; but at 12 miles it is 1,472, nearly four times as\r\ngreat. At 13 miles, it would be nearly 1800 horse, and at 14 it would\r\nbe above 2100. So, also, with the weight of engines, boilers, etc. At\r\n8 miles per hour they would weigh 1,109 tons; but at 12 they would\r\nhave to weigh, to be large and strong enough, 1,368 tons. At 14 miles,\r\nthey would weigh nearly 1,600 tons.\r\n\r\nNow, see the columns \"cargo\" and \"coal,\" and observe how rapidly that\r\nof coal increases, while that of cargo decreases in the inverse ratio\r\nof the coal, the engine, the boiler, and the hull weight combined. The\r\ncargo has come from 1,209 down to 717 tons; and if the speed were\r\nincreased to 13 or 14 miles per hour, the cargo would be so reduced as\r\nto be unworthy of notice.\r\n\r\nThe next column shows how much greater the quantity of water displaced\r\nas the speed increases. This extra displacement requires extra power.\r\n\r\nIn the last column it is observable how rapidly the speed enhances\r\nthe cost price of transporting cargo. At 13 miles per hour the cost\r\nwould be about six pounds sterling per ton, and at 14 knots speed it\r\nwould be higher than was ever paid a steamer in the most flush periods\r\nof even the best qualities of freights. Freights were about L8 per ton\r\non the Cunard line before the establishment of the Collins; but they\r\nsoon came down, and are not now L3, or $15, on an average. So with\r\npassage. The \"Great Western\" charged L45, the \"British Queen\" L50; the\r\nCunarders, until the Collins competition, L40, 19_s._ The Collins\r\nsteamers put the price down to L35, and have since reduced it to L30\r\nhomeward, and L24 outward. This is but little above half the fare of\r\nthe Great Western, and something over two thirds of that formerly\r\ncharged by the Cunard line. The Report to the House of Commons \"on\r\nSteam Communications with India,\" No. 372 of 1851, second volume, page\r\n395, says, that the average speed of the Cunard line was 10.443 knots,\r\nof the Collins line 11 knots, and of the Havre and Bremen lines 9.875\r\nknots per hour. The Collins line had then just started, and has since\r\nmade the average passages one and a half days quicker than those of\r\nthe Cunard line. This being the case, it is easy to estimate the gains\r\nof a steamer at such rates, when this column shows us that at 12 miles\r\nspeed per hour and an average trip of 11 days, the actual prime cost\r\nof moving the freight is much above that which is received for it. It\r\nis therefore taken in small quantities only to assist in paying the\r\nrunning expenses of the steamer.\r\n\r\nThis table shows another thing very conclusively, that large ships\r\nrunning the same number of miles per hour, run cheaper and transport\r\nfreight more cheaply than smaller vessels. It presupposes, however,\r\nthat they go full both ways. The engine power and general outlay do\r\nnot increase as rapidly as the tonnage of the vessel and her capacity\r\nfor carrying. While a ship 2,500 tons at 12 miles per hour on a\r\npassage of 3,250 miles would make the cost per ton for the\r\ntransportation of freight $22.75, one of 20,000 tons, under the same\r\nconditions would reduce it to $9 per ton. Yet it is hardly probable\r\nthat we shall ever profitably employ steamers of over 10,000 tons\r\ntonnage in the passenger, mail, and freight business.\r\n\r\nAgain, a ship of 2,500 at 12 miles, running 6,500 miles could not\r\ntransport cargo at less than $115; one of 5,000 tons would transport\r\nit at $52; one of 10,000 tons would transport it at $33 per ton; and\r\none of 20,000 tons burthen, as for instance the \"Leviathan,\" would\r\ntransport it at $24 per ton. And while none of the three first named\r\nsizes of vessels would transport it 12,500 miles, the one of 20,000\r\ntons, running 12 miles per hour, would transport it at $80 per ton;\r\nand running 14 miles per hours, at $430 per ton. Two things must,\r\nhowever, not be forgotten in this; that the ship to do this must\r\nalways run entirely full and have no waste room; and that these prices\r\nare comparisons between different steamers, and not with sailing\r\nvessels, which, running much more slowly and with but little expense,\r\ntransport the freight far more cheaply.\r\n\r\nThe following table will set forth very clearly in a summary view, the\r\nTime, Horse-power, Coal, and Cargo for a steamer of good average\r\nquality running on passages of 1,000 miles, 2,000 miles, and 3,000\r\nmiles, and at a speed varying from 6 to 18 miles per hour. It will be\r\nobserved that a steamer of 3,000 tons can not take power and coal\r\nenough to run on a 2,000 miles passage above 17 knots per hour, and\r\nthat one of 3,000 tons also can not run on a 3,000 miles passage at a\r\nspeed above 16 knots per hour. Observe the small quantity of cargo and\r\nthe large quantity of coal for a steamer of 3,000 tons on a 3,000\r\nmiles passage at 16 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL AND CARGO TABLE: No. IV.\r\n\r\n_Calculated for the mean Displacement of 3,000 Tons._\r\n\r\n KEY:\r\n A: SPEED--PER HOUR.\r\n B: HORSE-POWER.\r\n C: WEIGHT OF HULL AND ENGINES.\r\n D: PASSAGE 1,000 NAUTICAL MILES.

It\r\nappears that the vessel of 5,000 tons' mean displacement, if fitted\r\nto run at the speed of EIGHT NAUTICAL MILES per hour, will require 172\r\nH.P., and a cargo of 2,738 tons will be conveyed 1,000 miles in five\r\ndays five hours; being equivalent to one day's employment of 33/100\r\nH.P. _per ton_ of goods.\r\n\r\n\"If fitted to run at TEN NAUTICAL MILES an hour, the vessel will\r\nrequire 336 H.P., the cargo will be reduced to 2,524 tons, and the\r\ntime to four days four hours; being equivalent to one day's employment\r\nof 55/100 H.P. _per ton_ of goods nearly.\r\n\r\n\"If fitted to run at TWELVE NAUTICAL MILES an hour, the vessel will\r\nrequire 581 H.P., the cargo will be reduced to 2,217 tons, and the\r\ntime to three days eleven hours; being equivalent to one day's\r\nemployment of 91/100 H.P. _per ton_ of goods.\r\n\r\n\"If fitted to run at FOURTEEN MILES an hour, the vessel will require\r\n923 H.P., the cargo will be reduced to 1,802 tons, and the time to two\r\ndays twenty-three hours; being equivalent to one day's employment of\r\n1-52/100 H.P. _per ton_ of goods.\r\n\r\n\"If fitted to run at SIXTEEN MILES per hour, the vessel will require\r\n1,377 H.P., the cargo will be reduced to 1,264 tons, and the time to\r\ntwo days fourteen hours; being equivalent to one day's employment of\r\n2-86/100 H.P. _per ton_ of goods.\r\n\r\n\"If fitted to run at EIGHTEEN MILES per hour, the vessel will require\r\n1,961 H.P., the cargo will be reduced to 585 tons, and the time to two\r\ndays eight hours; being equivalent to one day's employment of 7-75/100\r\nH.P., _per ton_ of goods.\r\n\r\n\"And if fitted to run at TWENTY MILES per hour, there will be no\r\ndisplacement available for mercantile cargo.\r\n\r\n\"Assuming, now, that the COST per ton of goods will be in proportion\r\nto the amount of power and tonnage employed to do the work, it appears\r\nthat the cost _per ton of goods_ of performing this passage of 1,000\r\nmiles, at the respective speeds of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 miles,\r\nwill be proportional to the numbers--33/100, 55/100, 91/100, 1-52/100,\r\n2-86/100, and 7-75/100, which are proportional to the numbers 33, 55,\r\n91, 152, 286, and 775, or nearly as 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 23.\r\n\r\n\"Hence it appears, that in the case of the ONE THOUSAND MILES passage\r\nabove referred to, the cost of freight _per ton of goods_ at TEN MILES\r\nper hour, will require to be nearly the _double_ of the rate at EIGHT\r\nMILES per hour.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at TWELVE MILES per hour will require to be _three\r\ntimes_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at FOURTEEN MILES per hour will require to be _five\r\ntimes_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at SIXTEEN MILES per hour will require to be _nine\r\ntimes_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at EIGHTEEN MILES per hour will require to be\r\n_twenty-three times_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"And at TWENTY MILES per hour there will be _no displacement_\r\navailable for mercantile cargo.\r\n\r\n\"By applying the same process of calculation to a ship of 5,000 tons'\r\nmean displacement, making a passage of THREE THOUSAND MILES, we shall\r\nfind that, at TEN MILES an hour, the cost of freight per ton will\r\nrequire to be double the rate of freight at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at TWELVE MILES will require to be three times the\r\nrate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at FOURTEEN MILES will require to be six times the\r\nrate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at SIXTEEN MILES will require to be twenty times the\r\nrate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"And at EIGHTEEN MILES per hour there will be _no displacement_\r\navailable for mercantile cargo.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, by applying the same process of calculation to a ship of\r\n5,000 tons' mean displacement on a passage of 6,000 miles, it will be\r\nfound that the cost of freight per ton at TEN MILES per hour will\r\nrequire to be _double_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at TWELVE MILES per hour will require to be about\r\n_five times_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"The cost per ton at FOURTEEN MILES per hour will be about _sixteen\r\ntimes_ the rate at EIGHT MILES.\r\n\r\n\"And at SIXTEEN MILES per hour there will be _no displacement_\r\navailable for mercantile cargo.\r\n\r\n\"Hence, it appears, that for voyages of 1,000 miles and upwards,\r\nwithout re-coaling, the speed of ten nautical miles per hour would\r\ninvolve about _double_ the cost _per ton_ of eight miles, and may,\r\ntherefore, be regarded as the extreme limit that can be generally\r\nentertained for the mercantile purpose of goods' conveyance; and that\r\nthe attainment on long passages of a higher rate of speed than ten\r\nmiles (though admissibly practicable) would involve obligations\r\naltogether of an exceptional character, such as the special service of\r\ndispatches, mails, passengers, specie, and the most valuable\r\ndescription of goods can only meet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nOCEAN MAIL STEAMERS CAN NOT LIVE ON THEIR OWN RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n    INCREASE OF BRITISH MAIL SERVICE: LAST NEW LINE AT $925,000 PER\r\n    YEAR: THE SYSTEM NOT BECOMING SELF-SUPPORTING: CONTRACT RENEWALS\r\n    AT SAME OR HIGHER PRICES: PRICE OF FUEL AND WAGES INCREASED FASTER\r\n    THAN ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS: LARGE SHIPS RUN PROPORTIONALLY CHEAPER\r\n    THAN SMALL: AN EXAMPLE, WITH THE FIGURES: THE STEAMER \"LEVIATHAN,\"\r\n    27,000 TONS: STEAMERS OF THIS CLASS WILL NOT PAY: SHE CAN NOT\r\n    TRANSPORT FREIGHT TO AUSTRALIA: REASONS FOR THE SAME: MOTION HER\r\n    NORMAL CONDITION: MUST NOT BE MADE A DOCK: DELIVERY OF FREIGHTS:\r\n    MAMMOTH STEAMERS TO BRAZIL: LARGE CLIPPERS LIE IDLE: NOT EVEN THIS\r\n    LARGE CLASS OF STEAMERS CAN LIVE ON THEIR OWN RECEIPTS: EFFICIENT\r\n    MAIL STEAMERS CARRY BUT LITTLE EXCEPT PASSENGERS: SOME HEAVY EXTRA\r\n    EXPENSES IN REGULAR MAIL LINES: PACIFIC MAIL COMPANY'S LARGE EXTRA\r\n    FLEET, AND ITS EFFECTS: THE IMMENSE ACCOUNT OF ITEMS AND EXTRAS: A\r\n    PARTIAL LIST: THE HAVRE AND COLLINS DOCKS: GREAT EXPENSE OF\r\n    FEEDING PASSENGERS: VIEWS OF MURRAY AND ATHERTON ON THE COST OF\r\n    RUNNING STEAMERS, AND THE NECESSITY OF THE PRESENT MAIL SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing Section it is evident that the cost of running\r\nocean steamers is enormous, and that in the chief element of\r\nexpenditure it increases as the cube of the velocity. This, although\r\ntrue, is certainly a startling ratio of increase, and calculated to\r\narouse attention to the difficulties of postal marine navigation.\r\nSeeing that ocean speed is attainable at so high a cost, we naturally\r\nconclude that fast mail steamers can not live on their own receipts\r\nupon the ocean.\r\n\r\nSince Great Britain established her first ocean steam mail in 1833,\r\nshe has gone on rapidly increasing the same facilities, until her\r\nnoble lines of communication now extend to every land and compass\r\nevery sea. The last great contract which she conceded was last year,\r\nto the \"European and Australian Company,\" for carrying the mails on a\r\nsecond line from Southampton _via_ Suez to Sydney, in Australia, at\r\nL185,000, or $925,000 per year. And although her expenditures for this\r\nservice have gradually gone up to above five millions of dollars per\r\nannum, she continues the service as a necessity to her commerce, and a\r\nbranch of facilities and accommodations with which the people of the\r\nKingdom will not dispense. The British Government set out with the\r\ndetermination to have the advantages of the system, whether it would\r\npay or not. They believed that the system would eventually become\r\nself-supporting, by reason of the many important improvements then\r\nproposed in the steam-engine, and they have ever since professed to\r\nbelieve the same thing. But their experience points quite the other\r\nway; and while the service is daily becoming more important to them in\r\nevery sense, it is also becoming year by year more expensive.\r\n\r\nContracts which the Admiralty made with several large and prominent\r\ncompanies in 1838 they renewed at the same or increased subsidies,\r\nafter twelve years' operations, in 1850, for another term of twelve\r\nyears. And so far from those companies with their many ships on hand\r\nbeing able to undertake the service for less, they demanded more in\r\nalmost every case, and received it from the government. The\r\nimprovements which they anticipated in the marine engine were more\r\nthan counterbalanced by the rise in the price of fuel and wages all\r\nover the kingdom and the world. In fact, those improvements have been\r\nvery few and very small. It still takes nearly as much coal to\r\nevaporate a pound of water as it then did; and the improvements which\r\nhave been made were generally patents, and costly in the prime cost of\r\nconstruction to a degree almost preclusive of increased benefits to\r\nthe general service. At any rate, the latest steam adaptations and\r\nimprovements have proven unequal to the end proposed, and the cost of\r\nthe ocean service is now far heavier than it ever has been before,\r\nsimply because of the greater speed required by the public for the\r\nmails and passage.\r\n\r\nIt had long been hoped that this difficulty of increasing cost in\r\nrunning ocean steamers might finally be overcome by another means; and\r\nthe whole available engineering and ship-building talent of Great\r\nBritain and the United States has been directed not entirely to the\r\nengine department, but to the hulls and to the production of a large\r\nclass of ships, which are admissibly cheaper in proportion to size and\r\nexpense of running when compared with smaller vessels, if they are\r\nalways employed and have full freights and passage. It is well\r\nestablished that large steamers run proportionally cheaper than small\r\nones. (_See Table III., page 76._) This arises from the important fact\r\nthat the length increases far more rapidly than the breadth and depth.\r\nConsequently the tonnage of the vessel increases much faster than the\r\nresistance. In passing through the water the vessel cuts out a canal\r\nas large as the largest part of its body, which is at the middle of\r\nthe ship. If the vessel be here cut in two, the width and depth, or\r\nthe beam and hold being multiplied together will give the square\r\ncontents of the midship section. Now, when a vessel is doubled in all\r\nof its dimensions, this midship section and consequently the size of\r\nthe canal which it cuts in the water, does not increase as rapidly as\r\nthe solid contents of the whole ship, and consequently, as the\r\ntonnage. Hence, the resistance to the vessel in passing through the\r\nwater does not increase so rapidly as the tonnage which the vessel\r\nwill carry.\r\n\r\nTo make this clearer, let us suppose a vessel of good proportion,\r\nwhose length is seven times the beam, or 280 ft. long, 40 ft. wide,\r\nand 30 feet deep. The midship section will be 40 x 30 = 1,200 square\r\nfeet: the solid contents will be 40 x 30 x 280 = 336,000 solid feet.\r\nAgain, let us double these dimensions, and the ship will be 80 ft.\r\nwide, 60 ft. deep, and 560 feet long. The midship section will be 80 x\r\n60 = 4,800 square feet: the solid contents will be 80 x 60 x 560 =\r\n2,688,000 solid feet. Now, comparing the midship sections, and also\r\nthe said contents in each case we have,\r\n\r\n    Midship Section, 4,800\r\n                     ----- = 4 to 1. Increase as the squares:\r\n    Midship Section, 1,200\r\n\r\n    Solid Contents, 2,688,000\r\n                    --------- = 8 to 1. Increase as the cubes.\r\n    Solid Contents,   336,000\r\n\r\nThus, the midship resistance has increased as four to one, or as the\r\nsquare, while the solid contents, representing the tonnage, have\r\nincreased as eight to one, or as the cube. It is evident that the ship\r\nhas but four times the mid-section resistance, while she has eight\r\ntimes the carrying capacity. Therefore the engine power, and the coal\r\nand weight necessary to propel a ship of twice the lineal dimensions,\r\nor eight times the capacity, would have to be only four times that of\r\nthe smaller vessel, speaking in general terms; and as a consequence,\r\nthe price of freight, considering the vessels to run at equal speed,\r\nwould be but half as much in the larger as in the smaller vessel.\r\n\r\nThe attempt has been made to seize the evident advantages thus offered\r\nby increasing the size of the hull, until our clippers now reach an\r\nenormous size, and our steamers are stopping but little short of\r\n30,000 tons. The splendid steamer \"Leviathan\" was built on this idea,\r\nand must prove a splendid triumph in comparative cheapness if she can\r\nonly get business so as to run full, and keep herself constantly\r\nemployed in her legitimate business, running. But it is hardly\r\npossible that she should be always filled with either freight or\r\npassengers. Some of our large clipper ships have experienced this\r\ndifficulty. The time necessary to load and unload is too great for\r\nshort routes, although they are well calculated for long passages. If\r\none of these large steamers fail to get plenty of business the losses\r\nbecome exceedingly severe. The prime cost is immense; the interest on\r\nthe capital and the insurance are very large; and the current expenses\r\nare even beyond those necessary for the government of some cities.\r\nThese hazards all taken together more than neutralize the benefits\r\nwhich arise from extra size and extra proportional cheapness; so that\r\nnotwithstanding all of the hopes which some have entertained for the\r\ncheapening of transport in this way, they are probably doomed to\r\ndisappointment in the end; and ocean steaming continues as expensive\r\nas ever, and is growing even more expensive than it has ever been\r\nknown since its first introduction. (_See Coal Tables, pp. 71 and\r\n75._)\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, notwithstanding all of the advantages to be gained\r\nfrom increased size, steamers can not support themselves upon the\r\nocean. Let us examine further the case of such a ship as the\r\n\"Leviathan.\" I can not see that there is any normal trade in which she\r\ncan run successfully. She may transport 6,000 tons of measurement\r\ngoods to Australia; but it will be at the expense of fourteen to\r\nsixteen thousand tons of coals if the passage is made in fair time. If\r\nnot, sailing vessels will subserve all purposes except travel quite as\r\nwell. And certainly there is no class of freight for Australia or any\r\nother portion of the world, which will pay such an enormous coal-bill,\r\nand so many other expenses, and the interest and insurance on three\r\nand a half to four millions of dollars, just to save a few days in so\r\nlong a voyage. And if the steamer is to do a freighting as well as\r\npassenger business, then a long voyage is essential to her.\r\n\r\nRunning is the legitimate business of a steamer. Her costly engines\r\nare put in her for locomotion. Her large corps of engineers, firemen,\r\nand coal-passers, are employed for running her, and are of no use when\r\nshe is lying still, although necessarily on full pay. Her condition is\r\nabnormal and unnatural every day that she is lying at the docks, and\r\ntaking or discharging freight; and hence, every day that she is thus\r\nemployed she is not performing her proper functions. A sailing ship\r\ncan better afford to lie still for weeks and await a freight, or\r\nslowly receive or discharge cargo; as she must pay only the interest\r\non her investment, her dockage, the captain, and watchmen, and perhaps\r\nher depreciation. The prime investment is much less. She has no costly\r\nengines and boilers. So are her current expenses. She has none of the\r\ncostly _employees_ that I have named, and who can never leave a\r\nsteamer for a day. But eternal motion, flush freights, flush business,\r\ngood prices, and constant employment, are everywhere essential to the\r\nsteamer.\r\n\r\nSuppose the \"Leviathan\" steamer running between Liverpool and\r\nNew-York. She would be occupied ten days at least in receiving her\r\nfreight, ten days in running and making port or docks, and ten days in\r\ndischarging. Then, she would be employed only one third of her time in\r\nthe business for which she was constructed, running; while during two\r\nthirds of it she would be acting simply as a pier or dock, over which\r\nfreight would be handled. Now, with her costly engines, and costly and\r\nnecessarily idle _employees_, she can not afford to be a dock; neither\r\ncan she afford to lie still so long. Nor can she on such conditions\r\nget the freight necessary to her support. The community on neither\r\nside of the water would wish fifteen thousand tons of any class of\r\nfreights which she could transport dumped down upon the docks at one\r\ntime. They wish it to arrive a little and a little every day, as it is\r\nwanted, just enough to supply the market; and will not lie out of the\r\nmoney which they pay for it, and have it nearly a month in market\r\nbefore they need it, just to have it come on the \"Leviathan.\" It must\r\ncome along in small lots, just as they need it, and it must be shipped\r\nthe day that it is bought, and delivered as soon as the ship is in,\r\nwithout being the last lot of fifteen thousand tons, and without\r\nkeeping the owners so long out of their money. Suppose that A. puts\r\nthe first lot of freight in at London: he will be the last to receive,\r\nit in New-York. A smaller steamer taking another lot two days after,\r\nwill deliver it before the large ship gets half way over. Or, again,\r\nthe small steamer may leave London with it when the large steamer has\r\nnearly arrived at New-York, and deliver the lot here to the owner in\r\nadvance. Beside not wishing so large a lot at once, they do not wish\r\nit all in one place. The double advantage of a great number of small\r\nvessels is, that they bring cargo along as it is wanted, and at the\r\nsame time distribute it at all of the hundreds of large and small\r\nports, without first delivering it at some great mammoth terminus, and\r\nthen reshipping and distributing it to its final destination.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, who is a prominent statesman, recently seriously advised\r\nme not to think of establishing a line of mail steamers between the\r\nUnited States and Brazil, for the accommodation of the hundreds of\r\nsailing vessels engaged in that trade, but to get up a mammoth company\r\nand run five or six thirty thousand ton steamers, like the Leviathan,\r\nbetween Norfolk and Rio de Janeiro. He said that the increased size of\r\nthe steamer would enable me to carry freight cheaper than sailing\r\nvessels. The reasoning was neither very clear nor convincing to me on\r\nbehalf of the mysterious capacities which he attributed to large\r\nsteamers. I suggested that, in the first place, there was no cargo\r\npassing either way between the United States and Brazil which could\r\nafford to pay steam transportation under any circumstances; that so\r\nlarge a cargo could never be obtained at once in Rio de Janeiro or\r\nelsewhere; that the merchants of this country did not wish it all\r\nlanded at one place; that it would cost as much to remove it from\r\nNorfolk to the place of consumption, as it would from Rio de Janeiro\r\nto its final destination; that they did not wish it delivered all at\r\nonce, but in small lots at a time, and distributed where it was\r\nneeded; and that, even if it were at all practicable, which no\r\nbusiness man could for a moment believe, the people would not be\r\nwilling to have a fruitful field of industry in shipping occupied by\r\nsome great overgrown company, with a great coffee monopoly, which\r\nwould surely follow. Too much has been expected of large ships. The\r\nclipper \"Great Republic\" is not freighted half of her time. The\r\n\"Leviathan\" can not pay in freighting unless she runs to Australia and\r\nthe East-Indies, and runs slowly, on very little coal. She may do very\r\nwell with a voluntary cargo, which will load and unload itself in a\r\nhurry, such as a cargo of emigrants, and not steaming at too a high a\r\nspeed. But it would require a dozen steamers as tenders to bring these\r\nemigrants from Ireland, Bremen, Havre, Hamburgh, Amsterdam, and other\r\nEuropean cities, to her central depot in England. She would, however,\r\nbecome a most useful if not indispensable transport vessel for the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nIf the large class of steamers can not live on their own receipts,\r\nmuch less can the small. An adequate speed for the mails leaves no\r\navailable space for cargo. The ship may carry two or three hundred\r\ntons of freight; but it pays perhaps but little more than the handling\r\nand the extra coal necessary to transport its extra weight. As a\r\ngeneral thing, it may be safely said that when a vessel is well\r\nadapted to the mails and passengers she is filled with her own power,\r\nthat is, with heavy engines, large boilers, and a large quantity of\r\nfuel, as also with her provisions and baggage. We have already seen\r\nhow the size and weight of engines and boilers must increase, as well\r\nas the bulk and cost of the fuel, to gain a little speed. But it is\r\nnot generally known how large a quantity of consumable stores and\r\nbaggage go in a well-supported mail packet. The greater the postal\r\nefficiency of a steamer the less is it able to carry freight; and the\r\ntime will doubtless soon come when the fast mail packets will take\r\nnothing except a few express packages. The Persia now takes scarcely\r\nany freight, and the Vanderbilt can not think of doing it when she\r\nmakes fast trips. It is very probable that the whole system of the\r\nocean will be materially changed; and that while clippers and slow\r\npropellers carry the fine freights, fast vessels filled with their own\r\npower will carry the mails and passengers. And in doing this, they can\r\nnot, of course, support themselves; neither will they conflict with\r\nprivate enterprise in freight transport. It is now the case to a large\r\nextent on most of our American lines.\r\n\r\nWhile the ocean mail steamer must be fast and costly, for the better\r\nacceleration of correspondence and the accommodation of passengers,\r\nshe must also go at the appointed hour, whether she is repaired or\r\nnot, and wholly irrespective of her freight and passenger list. There\r\nmust be no delays for a lot of freight, or for a company of fifty\r\npassengers who have been delayed by the train. She has the mails, and\r\nmust go at the hour appointed, whatever it may cost the company, and\r\nhowever large a lot of costly stores may have to be thrown away. This\r\npunctuality, while it is the means of securing small lots of freight,\r\nprevents also the accommodation of the ship's day of sailing to\r\narrangements which might otherwise be profitable. This punctuality in\r\nsailing always necessitates large extra expense in repairs. It\r\nfrequently happens that companies of men work through the nights and\r\non Sundays; getting much increased prices for such untimely labor, and\r\nbeing far less efficient in the night than in the day. If the steamer\r\nhas had a long passage from whatever causes, she discharges whatever\r\nshe has and takes in her coal in a hurried and costly way, frequently\r\nat fifty per cent. advance on the cost necessary for it if she had\r\nample time. The only means of avoiding these exigencies is by having\r\nspare ships, which cost as much as any others, but which add nothing\r\nwhatsoever to the company's income. It may be safe to say that in\r\nevery mail company it is necessary to have one spare, and consequently\r\nunproductive, ship for every three engaged in active service. This\r\nthirty-three per cent. additional outlay would not be necessary except\r\non a mail line, where punctuality was positively demanded. Yet, it is\r\none of the heavy items of expense to be incurred by every company\r\ncarrying the mails, and with which they can not in any wise dispense,\r\nhowever well their ships may be built. The \"Pacific Mail Steamship\r\nCompany\" in running their semi-monthly line from Panama to California\r\nand Oregon, keep constantly at their docks eight unemployed steamers\r\nand one tow-boat, ready for all exigencies and accidents, and could\r\nkeep their mails going if nearly their whole moving fleet should be\r\nsunk at once. No wonder that they have never missed a single trip, or\r\nlost a single passenger by marine accident since they first started in\r\n1850. But there is another class of costs in running ocean steamers,\r\nwhich amount to large sums in the aggregate, and of which the people\r\nare generally wholly ignorant. I allude to the items, and what may be\r\ncalled \"odds and ends.\" It is easily imaginable that a company has to\r\npay only the bills for wages, for fuel, and for provisions, and that\r\nthen the cash-drawer may be locked for the voyage. Indeed, it is\r\ndifficult for those accustomed to the marine steam service to sit down\r\nand enumerate by memory in one day the thousand little treasury leaks,\r\nthe many wastages, the formidable bill of extras, and the items which\r\nare necessary to keep every thing in its place, and to pay every body\r\nfor what he does. The oil-bill of a large steamer would be astonishing\r\nto a novice, until he saw the urns and oil-cans which cling to every\r\njournal, and jet a constant lubricating stream. The tools employed\r\nabout a steamer are legion in number, and cost cash. We hear a couple\r\nof cannon fired two or three times as we enter and leave port, or pass\r\na steamer upon the ocean, and consider it all very fine and inspiring;\r\nbut we do not reflect that the guns cost money, and that pound after\r\npound of powder is not given to the company by the Government or the\r\npublic. The steamer carries many fine flags and signals, which cost\r\ncash. An anchor with the chain is lost; another costs cash. Heavy\r\nweather may be on, and it takes some hours to get into the dock. The\r\nextra coal and the tow-boat cost cash. The wheel-house is torn to\r\npieces against the corner of the pier, and the bulwarks are carried\r\naway by heavy seas; but no one will repair the damage for any thing\r\nshort of cash. A large number of lights are by law required to be kept\r\nburning on the wheel-houses and in the rigging all night; but no one\r\nreflects that it took money first to purchase them, and a constant\r\noutlay to keep them trimmed and burning. People suppose that the\r\ncaptain, or steward, or some body else can take a match and set the\r\nlamp off, and have it burn very nicely; but there are only a few who\r\nknow that it takes one man all of his time to clean, fill, adjust,\r\nlight, and keep these lamps going, as well as have them extinguished\r\nat the proper time.\r\n\r\nI saw to-day a case in point as regards accidental expenses. The\r\nsplendid steamship Adriatic sailed at 12. The wind was very high from\r\nthe south, and almost blowing a gale. She was lying on the southern\r\nside of the dock, while the Atlantic was lying with her stern at the\r\nend of the dock, near where the Adriatic had to pass in going out. At\r\nthe moment of starting, three strong tow-boats were attached to her\r\nbow, and endeavored as she went out to draw her head against the wind,\r\ndown stream. But they proved insufficient to the task. The vessel\r\ncrushed down the corner of the dock, ran into the Atlantic, and\r\ncarried away her stern bulwarks, crushed one of her own large and\r\ncostly iron life-boats, and damaged one of her wheel-houses. Now, who\r\nof the two hundred thousand spectators that lined the docks, would pay\r\nthe two thousand dollars for the life-boat, a thousand for repairing\r\nthe dock and vessels, and the bill for the three tug-boats for two\r\nhours each?\r\n\r\nMoreover, we see a pilot get on the steamer at New-York, another at\r\nSouthampton, and a third at Havre; but we seldom reflect that the\r\nsteamer has to pay a large price to each one of them, both going and\r\ncoming. Take the coasting steamers, running between New-York and\r\nSavannah, or Charleston. It appears singular that the New-York pilot\r\ngoes all the way to Savannah, that the Savannah pilot comes all the\r\nway to New-York, and that the steamer pays for both of these men all\r\nthe time, and feeds them on board all of the time. Yet it is so. Such\r\nis the law; and it amounts to a good many thousands during the year.\r\nAnd all this, the company must pay, as a part of those items which\r\ntake cash, but for which the company never gets any credit from the\r\npublic or the Government. Whenever a little accident occurs to the\r\nsteamer, it must be towed a few miles at a high price by a tug-boat.\r\nWhenever the Government or friends and visitors come on board, they\r\nexpect to be liberally entertained; yet the company must pay for it,\r\nor be considered mean and unworthy of the Government's patronage. Each\r\nship must have an experienced surgeon, whose wages must be paid like\r\nthose of other persons employed, and an apothecary's room and outfit.\r\nThe ship must be painted and varnished, and overhauled at every trip;\r\nthe upholstering and furnishing must be often renewed; stolen articles\r\nmust be replaced; and the breakages of table-wares constantly renewed.\r\nAll of this costs cash.\r\n\r\nThe steamer also has to pay light dues and port charges wherever she\r\ngoes. Many of these are exorbitant and unreasonable. In Havre the\r\n\"Fulton\" and \"Arago\" must pay nearly twenty-four hundred dollars each\r\non every departure, or they will not be permitted to leave the docks.\r\nThis is no small item for each steamer on every passage that she\r\nmakes. At New-York she pays wharfage again. It is not so high, but it\r\nis a large item, and requires the cash. Again, there is the great\r\nshore establishment which every steam company must maintain. Large\r\ndocks, and warehouses, and coaling arrangements, staging, watchmen,\r\nporters, and messengers, and a shore-captain equal to those on board,\r\nmust all be maintained. The Havre Company pays to the city $4,000 per\r\nyear for its dock, $1,200 for its annual repairs, and also for sheds,\r\nfixtures, etc., extra. They keep also two watchmen at $40 each per\r\nmonth, and other persons in the dock service. The Collins Company have\r\na necessarily very costly dock both in New-York and Liverpool. That in\r\nNew-York would rent for $15,000 per annum. The one in Liverpool is far\r\nmore costly. On each they keep a large number of men, with watchmen,\r\ngatekeepers, runners, porters, and clerks, and always keep an office\r\nopen. Beside this, is the whole paraphernalia of the office of the\r\ncompany. There must be offices, clerks, bookkeepers, porters, runners,\r\netc.; a president, treasurer, and secretary; an attorney, agents, and\r\nagencies; and newspaper advertising, and a hundred little things which\r\nno man can mention. I do not pretend to be able to give an adequate\r\nconception of the innumerable items which so swell the large actual\r\nworking expenses of regularly running steamers. Even the charities of\r\na decently managed company are large. Firemen and engineers become\r\ndisabled and must be supported; or they are killed in the service of\r\nthe ship, leaving families which no decent company can disregard. The\r\namount which the West-India Royal Mail Company pays in this way, and\r\nwhich our noble American lines advance to the deserving, are beyond\r\nall conception of the mere theorist.\r\n\r\nThere is another source of loss which prevents, mail packets\r\nespecially, from paying their expenses on their freight and passenger\r\nearnings. The table on all of our steamships has become exceedingly\r\nexpensive, as it has in our hotels. Perhaps there is more necessity\r\nfor it on steamers than in the hotels, as passengers are generally\r\nsea-sick, and need every delicacy of life to keep them up. The\r\nsupplies which our fine mail packets carry for this purpose are of\r\nalmost incredible extent and costliness. No vegetable, fruit, game, or\r\nother rarity that can be kept fifteen days in large masses of ice, is\r\nneglected; so that the table of every steamer is necessarily both\r\nluxurious and expensive. Indeed, it has become so much so, and the\r\nprice of passage fare has been reduced so low on all of the prominent\r\nlines, that as a general rule the steamers are not now making much\r\nclear money on their passengers. The expense of keeping passengers was\r\nnot half so great six years ago, as it is now; and there appears to be\r\nno safe means of permanent retrenchment. Nothing has been said of\r\nInsurance. This is a most costly item. The Havre Company pay on their\r\ntwo ships, which are worth about $900,000, nine and a half per cent.\r\nper annum; and Mr. Collins pays on his three ships, which are worth\r\nabout $2,200,000, nine per cent. per annum. On the Havre steamers this\r\namounts to $85,500 per year, which is nearly as much as the mail pay;\r\nand on the Collins, to $198,000 per annum. And these are among what we\r\ncall the items of mail steamship expenditure. I do not know the sums\r\npaid by the United States Mail, or by the Pacific Mail Companies.\r\n\r\nI will here give the views of Messrs. Murray and Atherton on the cost\r\nof steam, as they replied to letters of inquiry, which I addressed\r\nthem Sept. 14, 1857. Mr. Murray says in answer to\r\n\r\n_Query 2_. \"It is certainly my impression that ocean steamers of\r\nsufficient speed to carry the mails with any thing like regularity,\r\nwill not pay upon any route with which I am acquainted, without\r\nassistance from Government.\"\r\n\r\n_Query 5_: Can Parliament do better in economy than in her present\r\nmail contracts, all things considered? Mr. Murray replies:\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how Parliament can avoid paying the large subsidies she\r\ndoes for the mail contracts under present circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n_Query 4_: Is the steamship stock of Great Britain, subsidized or\r\nunsubsidized, paying stock, and is there much disposition among\r\ncapitalists to invest, even in the stock of subsidized companies? He\r\nreplies:\r\n\r\n\"I do not think the steamship stock of Great Britain to be in a very\r\nnourishing condition: in fact, I know of only one company (the\r\nPeninsular and Oriental) in which I should like to invest money.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Atherton replies to a query regarding the cost of running steamers\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"As to whether the effective performance of high speed mail service is\r\ncompatible with ordinary mercantile service without government\r\nsubsidy, I am of opinion that the mutual relation of Speed and Cost in\r\nconnection with long sea-voyages has never yet been duly appreciated\r\nby owners, managers, or agents in charge of steam shipping affairs.\r\nAn acceleration of steaming speed involves an increase of cost\r\nexpenses, and a decrease of mercantile earnings, as dependent on\r\n_freight per ton weight_ far beyond what is generally supposed.\"\r\n\r\nHe further says in reply to Query 9, which is as follows:\r\n\r\nDo you know of any disposition in the Government to cut down the ocean\r\nmail service, as an unproductive expenditure? He says:\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to estimate the national value of an effective mail\r\nservice throughout the whole globe; the breaking of one link, though\r\napparently of trivial consequence, impairs the whole system. I can not\r\nimagine that there is any disposition to impair the completeness of\r\nthe mail system.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing considerations it is palpable that fast ocean\r\nsteamers can not live on their own receipts. And the same will in most\r\ncases hold true of freighting and other steamers of all classes, which\r\ndepend entirely on steam as their agent of locomotion. Propellers will\r\nhardly form an exception to this rule. If the power and the passengers\r\nfill the hull, if the coal bill and other expenses increase as rapidly\r\nas indicated for mail packets, if engineering improvements do not\r\nadvance as rapidly as the price of coals, if larger and more cheaply\r\nrunning ships can not get an adequate support in business, if there\r\nare the many leakages and expenses indicated, and if all of the\r\nexpenses of running steamers are continually increasing from year to\r\nyear rather than diminishing, then we may never expect to see the mail\r\nand passenger steamers of the ocean become self-supporting, or less\r\ndependent than now, on the fostering care of the Government and the\r\nnational treasury.[C]\r\n\r\n[C] Since this was written, Mr. Drayton has shown me the receipt for\r\nthis year's _taxes_ on the Havre Company, which are $7,782, the two\r\nships being valued at $500,000 only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nHOW CAN MAIL SPEED BE ATTAINED?\r\n\r\n    THE TRANSMARINE COMPARED WITH THE INLAND POST: OUR PAST SPASMODIC\r\n    EFFORTS: NEED SOME SYSTEM: FRANCE AROUSED TO STEAM: THE\r\n    SAILING-SHIP MAIL: THE NAVAL STEAM MAIL: THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE\r\n    MAIL: ALL INADEQUATE AND ABANDONED: GREAT BRITAIN'S EXPERIENCE IN\r\n    ALL THESE METHODS: NAVAL VESSELS CAN NOT BE ADAPTED TO THE MAIL\r\n    SERVICE: WILL PROPELLERS MEET THE WANTS OF MAIL TRANSPORT, WITH OR\r\n    WITHOUT SUBSIDY: POPULAR ERRORS REGARDING THE PROPELLER: ITS\r\n    ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES: BOURNE'S OPINION: ROBERT MURRAY:\r\n    PROPELLERS TOO OFTEN ON THE DOCKS: THEY ARE VERY DISAGREEABLE\r\n    PASSENGER VESSELS: IF PROPELLERS RUN MORE CHEAPLY IT IS BECAUSE\r\n    THEY ARE SLOWER: COMPARED WITH SAIL: UNPROFITABLE STOCK: CROSKEY'S\r\n    LINE: PROPELLERS LIVE ON CHANCES AND CHARTERS: IRON AS A MATERIAL:\r\n    SENDING THE MAILS BY SLOW PROPELLERS WOULD BE AN UNFAIR\r\n    DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SAILING VESSELS: INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISE CAN\r\n    NOT SUPPLY MAIL FACILITIES: THEREFORE IT IS THE DUTY OF THE\r\n    GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to prove in the foregoing Section that ocean mail\r\nsteamers can not live on their own receipts. The question now arises,\r\nhow can we secure speed for the mails and passengers upon the ocean?\r\nWith so many expenses and so small an income the fast ocean steamer\r\ncan not become profitable to even the most thoroughly organized and\r\nbest administered companies. Much less can it be successfully run by\r\nindividuals and individual enterprise, which has never so many\r\nreliable resources at command as a strong, chartered company. It is\r\ntrue that there are a few prominent transatlantic routes where\r\nsteamers can run as auxiliary propellers; but the number of them is\r\nsmall, and the speed attained will by no means prove sufficient for\r\npostal purposes. The transmarine postal service has been a source of\r\nconstant annoyance to almost every commercial nation. The overland\r\nmails have generally been self-supporting, and it has been a favorite\r\nidea that those on the sea should be so also; although there is no\r\njust reason why either should be necessarily so any more than in the\r\ncases of the Navy and the Army; branches of the service which entail\r\nlarge expenses on the Government, and yet without a moiety of the\r\nbenefits which directly flow from the postal service to all classes of\r\ncommunity. No nation except Great Britain has come up to the issue and\r\nfaced this question boldly. Almost every other country, not excepting\r\nour own, has been hanging back on the subject of the transmarine post,\r\n\"waiting, like Mr. Micawber, for something to turn up,\" in the\r\nimprovements of ocean steam navigation, which might obviate the\r\nnecessity of paying for the ocean transit. But every hope has been\r\ndisappointed; and instead of realizing these wishes the case has been\r\ngrowing worse year by year, until we are at last compelled to move in\r\nthe matter, or lose our commerce, our ocean _prestige_, and sink down\r\ncontented with a second or third-rate position among commercial\r\nnations, and acknowledge ourselves tributary to the far-seeing and\r\nfar-reaching, and superior policy of our competitors.\r\n\r\nThe United States have indeed become galvanically aroused now and\r\nthen, as in 1847 and '8, to a self-protecting and a self-developing\r\nsystem; but as soon as one faint effort has been made, we have,\r\ninstead of pursuing that effort and developing it fully, relapsed back\r\ninto our old indifference, and given the whole available talent of the\r\nGovernment either to the administration, or to the everlasting\r\ndiscussion of petty politics. During the time that President Buchanan\r\nwas Secretary of State, some of our noblest efforts for the\r\nestablishment of ocean mails were made, with his fullest countenance\r\nand aid; but the policy then inaugurated with prospects so hopeful for\r\nour commercial future, and which has operated so healthfully ever\r\nsince, is now half abandoned, or left without notice to take care of\r\nitself; until it may be to-day said that we have no steam policy, and\r\nrun our ocean mails only by expedients. This ever has been and ever\r\nwill be unfortunate for us, and costly. Individuals and companies\r\nbuild steamers for the accidents of trade, let them lie still a year\r\nor two, then pounce upon some disorganized trade, suck the life-blood\r\nfrom it like vampires, and at last leave it, the very corpse of\r\ncommerce, lying at the public door. All such irregular traffic is\r\ninjurious to the best interests of the country, destroys all generous\r\nand manly competition, and proves most clearly the want of a\r\nGovernment steam mail system. France has been awaiting the issues of\r\ntime, and under a too high expectation for the improvements of the\r\nage, until she finds that unless she inaugurates and sustains a\r\nliberal steam policy, and becomes less dependent on foreigners for her\r\nmails, she will have the commerce of the world swept from her shores\r\nas by a whirlwind of enterprise. She has now become aroused, and has\r\ndetermined to establish three great lines of communication, one with\r\nthe United States, one with the West-Indies, Central America, the\r\nSpanish Main, and Mexico, and one with Brazil and La Plata. She has\r\nfound, that it will no longer do to abandon her mails to fate, and\r\nthat in the end it will be far more profitable to pay even largely for\r\ngood mails than to do without them. Hence, her offer to give to the\r\nAmerican, West-Indian, and Brazilian service named an annual\r\nsubvention of fourteen million _Francs_, or nearly three million\r\ndollars, to be continued for twenty years, which the Government deems\r\na sufficient period for the establishment and test of a system. (_See\r\n_projet_ of Franco-American Navigation, page 198._)\r\n\r\nAmong the many expedients adopted for the transmission of the foreign\r\npost are those of employing ordinary sailing vessels on the one hand,\r\nor the vessels of the war marine on the other. Both systems have been\r\neffectually and forever exploded and abandoned. The objections to\r\nsailing vessels are very numerous. They are, in the first place, too\r\nslow. They are too uncertain in their days of sailing and arrival.\r\nThey can never be placed under the direction of the Department because\r\nthey are private property, devoted to private uses, and generally\r\naccomplish their ends by private means; one of the most prominent of\r\nwhich is, to keep back all letters except those going to their own\r\nconsignees. If a merchant runs his ship for personal gain it is not to\r\nbe supposed that he will carry the letters of his commercial\r\ncompetitors, and thus forestall his own speculations. Sailing vessels\r\nhave no proper accommodations for the mails, and can not fairly be\r\nforced either to transport or to deliver them. The uncertainties of\r\ncargo are such that they can not sail on fixed days with punctuality.\r\nBut the great difficulty is their want of speed and the uncertainty of\r\ntheir progress or arrival. Whenever they have been employed by the\r\nBritish Government for postal service they have always proven\r\nthemselves inefficient and unreliable. Whenever they have been\r\nsuperceded by steamers, the postal income, before small, has gone up\r\nrapidly to five, ten, or twenty times the former income. This was well\r\nillustrated in the British and Brazilian lines. The Parliamentary\r\nreturns for 1842, when postal service with Brazil and La Plata was\r\nperformed by a line of fine sailing packets, give the total income\r\nfrom postages at L5,034, 13_d_, 6_s_ Lord Canning, the British Post\r\nMaster General, stated that, in 1852, two years after the Royal Mail\r\nSteam Packets commenced running to Brazil and La Plata, the income\r\nfrom postages was L44,091, 17_s_, or nearly nine times as much as when\r\nthe mails went by sailing vessels.[D] Ship owners have a strong\r\naversion to receiving letters for the places to which their ships are\r\nbound. As a barque was about sailing from New-York for Demerara in\r\n1855, I called on the owner, who was on the dock, just before the\r\nvessel got under way, and asked that some letters which I held in my\r\nhand, might be taken to Georgetown. He said that he could not take\r\nthem; that he sailed his vessel to make money; and that he could not\r\ndo other people's business. As I walked away from him rather abruptly,\r\nhe called to me and wished to know to whom the letters were addressed.\r\nI told him, to Sir Edmund Wodehouse, the Governor of the Province; and\r\nthat they related to the establishment of steam mail facilities\r\nbetween this country and that Province. He at once begged my pardon\r\nand explained; asked that I would let him send the letters; and said,\r\nmoreover, that he would at any time be glad to give me a passage there\r\nand back on that business.\r\n\r\n[D] See Parliamentary Papers for 1852-3, postal affairs, Report of\r\nLord Canning, July 8, 1853.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of employing the steamers of the Navy in the postal\r\nservice has been very fully made by Great Britain. After attempts on a\r\nconsiderable number of lines, and extending over a period of ten\r\nyears, this service has been found inefficient, cumbrous, and more\r\ncostly, and has been entirely abandoned. Murray, page 172, says that\r\nMr. Anderson, Managing Director of the Peninsular and Oriental\r\nCompany, said before the Parliamentary Committee as follows: \"The\r\npostal communication can be done much cheaper by private contract\r\nsteamers than by Government boats, because of the merchandise and\r\npassengers carried. The steam communication between Southampton and\r\nAlexandria, with vessels of 300 to 400 horse power, was done for 4_s_\r\n6_d_, per mile. From Suez to Ceylon, Calcutta, and Hong Kong, with\r\nvessels of 400 to 500 horse power, for 17_s_, 1_d_ per mile. The\r\nEast-India Company's line (of naval vessels) between Suez and Bombay\r\nwith vessels of only 250 to 300 horse power, cost 30_s_ per mile. Her\r\nMajesty's vessels in the Mediterranean cost about 21_s_ per mile.\"\r\nFrance also tried the experiment, but soon abandoned the system, as\r\nfruitless and exceedingly annoying. It is quite a plausible idea that\r\nour mails should go under the flag of the country, with power to\r\nprotect them, and that vessels generally supposed to be idle should be\r\nengaged in some useful service. But this presupposes a fact which does\r\nnot exist. No vessels in the world are more actively employed than\r\nthose of the American navy, and there are many stations on which we\r\ncould employ twice as many as we have with excellent effect on our\r\ncommerce and foreign relations generally. We constantly hear the\r\ncomplaint that the Secretary of the Navy has no steamer for some\r\nimmediately necessary or indispensable service. But if he had, and if\r\ntwo dozen steamers were lying all the time idle in our navy yards,\r\nthey would probably not be installed six months in the postal service\r\nuntil they would be positively demanded in some way in that of the\r\nnation, and this diversion would at once frustrate all of the postal\r\nand commercial plans of the country.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties in the way of this service are so numerous as to\r\nbe readily palpable to all who examine it. No vessel that is well\r\nfitted for naval service is well adapted to that of the post. The post\r\nrequires great speed, and hence, full-powered vessels. The navy does\r\nnot require so great speed, and hence, the steamers are seldom more\r\nthan auxiliaries. They are built heavier and fuller, and are not so\r\nadapted to speed. Filling them with the power necessary to drive them\r\nwith sufficient rapidity for mail packets would unfit them for the\r\nefficient service of war. Naval vessels are, moreover, filled and\r\nweighted down with guns, stores, men, and a thousand things which\r\nwould be in the way if they were employed for the mails. They have no\r\nstate-rooms, cabins, saloons, etc.; and if they had them so as to\r\naccommodate passengers, they would be unfit for the war service.\r\nUnless so fitted they could not accommodate passengers, as they will\r\nnot lash themselves up in hammocks under the deck, as thick as grass,\r\nas man-of-war's men will. If they are to be strictly naval vessels\r\nwhile running, they will be filled with their own men, and could not\r\ntake passengers even if they had state-room accommodations for them.\r\nThey would thus be deprived entirely of this source of income. Again,\r\nthey could take no freight; and if a passenger mail steamer has to\r\ndepend upon both freight and passengers for an income to meet the\r\nlarge expenses, which are generally three, five, and often even ten\r\ntimes the sum of subsidy received from the Government, then the naval\r\nvessel running in the postal service will be deprived of both these\r\nsources of income, and must fall back on the department for all of its\r\nexpenses, which would be three, five, and even ten times as much as\r\nthe sum paid private companies for carrying the mail.\r\n\r\nThe average round trips of the Pacific mail steamers from Panama to\r\nSan Francisco and Olympia, and back, are, beyond doubt, enormously\r\nexpensive; while they receive from the Government only $14,500. This\r\nis, consequently, but a small fractional part of their income. The\r\ntrip of the \"Arago,\" or \"Fulton,\" to Havre and back, costs about\r\n$45,000, while the mail pay was only $12,500, under the old contract,\r\nand is now probably not above $7,500 per round trip.[E] These\r\nestimates are made exclusive of insurance, which is 9-1/2 per cent.;\r\nrepairs, 10 per cent.; and depreciation, at least five per cent.\r\nHere, again, the Government gives but a meagre part of the large sum\r\nnecessary to keep those packets running. Now, if naval vessels were\r\ncarrying the same mails, and were deprived of the income which they\r\nreceive for freight and passengers, it would evidently cost the\r\nGovernment six to eight times as much to carry the mails as it now\r\ndoes, saying nothing about the income from the mails, which is\r\ntrifling. But this class of vessels never could subserve the purposes\r\nof rapid correspondence. If they could carry freight and passengers,\r\nthe difficulties would still be insuperable. It would cost twice as\r\nmuch for the department to accomplish the same object through its\r\nofficers and its routine as it would for private companies or\r\nindividuals, who have but the one business and the one purpose in\r\nrunning their vessels. No man, company, or even department of the\r\nGovernment, can accomplish two important and difficult ends by the\r\nsame agency at the same time. Either the one or the other must suffer\r\nand be neglected, or both will be but imperfectly and ineffectively\r\nperformed. Many structures of this kind fall of their own\r\nsuperincumbent weight and clumsiness. If naval vessels thus running\r\neven had passengers they would never be satisfied or well treated. A\r\ncaptain and crew, to be agreeable and satisfactory to passengers, must\r\nfeel themselves under obligation to them for their patronage, and\r\nwould be compelled to exert themselves to merit the best feelings of\r\ntheir patrons. This could never be the case with naval gentlemen, who\r\nwould be dependent for their living on the department only. It is\r\nprobable that no one seriously entertains such a plan as this for the\r\npostal service, as this must be a distinct, partly self-supporting,\r\nunbroken, and continuous service, while that of the Navy must also be\r\ndistinct, independent, and efficiently directed to one great cardinal\r\nobject. Therefore, we can not secure postal service by this means.\r\n\r\n[E] This line receives the total postages, ocean and inland, which in\r\n1856 were, according to the Post Master General's report, $88,483.99,\r\nor $7,373.33 per round voyage. (_See Letter of the Hon. Horatio King,\r\n1st Asst. Post Master General._)\r\n\r\nAs much has been said of Propellers during the few years past, I\r\npropose examining the question with the view of ascertaining whether\r\nthey are adapted to the mail service, and whether we can secure from\r\nthem sufficient speed without a subsidy from the Government. It is\r\nwell known that the British are a far more steady-going people than\r\nourselves, and not being so rushing do not require so much speed. They\r\nhave had an easy control of the European and foreign commerce\r\ngenerally around them; and when competition aroused them to additional\r\nefforts they did not endeavor to outstride themselves, but took merely\r\nan additional step of progress and speed, and adopted the propeller\r\nfor their coasting business, because it was a little faster than wind,\r\nand yet cheaper than full steam. And because so many propellers have\r\nbeen built for the peculiar short-route trade of Great Britain, many\r\npeople in this country can not see why we do not adopt the propeller\r\nfor our foreign trade. I have already shown (_See page 44_) that there\r\nare some short routes on which steam is cheaper than the wind, and\r\nthat on others of greater length steamers can not transport freight\r\nunder any conditions. (_See latter part of Section IV., on the Cost of\r\nSteam._) I do not propose making the Screw Propeller in any way an\r\nexception to the position stated; and shall consequently maintain that\r\nit will never be the means of attaining a rapid and yet cheap mail\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThere are no greater errors entertained by the public on any subject\r\nconnected with steam navigation than concerning the Screw Propeller.\r\nIt is generally supposed that it is a more economical and effective\r\napplication of power than the side-wheel, which is a mistake: it is\r\ngenerally supposed that, with the same amount of power and all other\r\nconditions equal, the propeller will not run as rapidly as the\r\nside-wheel, which is true of steaming in a sea-way or against a\r\nhead-wind, but a mistake as regards smooth water: it is generally\r\nsupposed that the engines weigh less, take up less room, and cost\r\nless, which is all a mistake. The best authors on this subject and the\r\nmost eminent builders generally agree, that in England and Scotland,\r\nwhere the propeller has attained its greatest perfection, the\r\ndifference between the side-wheel and the propeller as an application\r\nof power is very slight and hardly appreciable; or that the same\r\nnumber of tons of coal will drive two ships of the same size at the\r\nsame speed in smooth water; but that the side-wheel has greatly the\r\nadvantage in a head-sea or during rough weather generally. Many\r\npersons who do not understand the subject, have theorized in just the\r\ncontrary direction. They say that in rough weather the screw has the\r\nadvantage, because it is alway in the water, etc. Experience shows\r\njust the reverse; and theory will bear the practice out. If, in the\r\nside-wheel one wheel is part of the time out, the other has, at any\r\nrate, the whole force of the engines, and the floats sink to and take\r\nhold on a denser, heavier, and less easily yielding stratum of water;\r\nso that the progress is nearly the same. The back current or opposing\r\nwave can not materially affect it, because the float is at the extreme\r\nend of the arm where the travel is greatest, and is always more rapid\r\nthan the wave. It is not so with the screw. The blade which meets the\r\nwave is not placed at the end of a long arm where the travel is very\r\nrapid and the motion more sudden than that of the wave. This blade\r\nextends all the way along from its extreme end, where the motion is\r\nrapid, to the centre, or the shaft, where there is no motion; and all\r\nintermediate parts of this blade move so slowly, that the wave of\r\ngreater rapidity counteracts it, and checks its progress. The\r\nside-wheel applies its power at the extreme periphery, where the\r\ntravel is greatest, while the screw applies it all along between the\r\npoint of extreme rapidity, and the stationary point in the shaft.\r\nThere is, moreover, much power lost as the oblique blades of the screw\r\nrise and fall in a vertical line while the vessel is heaving.\r\n\r\nIn the new edition (1855) of \"Bourne on the Propeller,\" he says in the\r\npreface:\r\n\r\n\"Large vessels, we know, are both physically and commercially more\r\nadvantageous than small vessels, provided only they can be filled with\r\ncargo; but in some cases in which small paddle vessels have been\r\nsuperseded by large screw vessels, the superior result due to an\r\nincreased size of hull has been imputed to a superior efficiency of\r\nthe propeller. No fact, however, is more conclusively established than\r\nthis, that the efficiency of paddles and of the screw as propelling\r\ninstruments is very nearly the same; and in cases in which geared\r\nengines are employed to drive a screw vessel, the machinery will take\r\nup about the same amount of room as if paddles had been used, and the\r\nresult will be much the same as if paddles had been adopted. When\r\ndirect acting engines, however, are employed, the machinery will\r\noccupy a much less space in screw vessels than is possible in paddle\r\nvessels, and the use of direct acting engines in screw propellers is\r\nnecessary, therefore, for the realization of the full measure of\r\nadvantage, which screw propulsion is able to afford.\"\r\n\r\nAtherton says of the propeller in his \"Marine Engine Construction and\r\nClassification,\" page 45:\r\n\r\n\"Its operation has been critically compared with that of the\r\npaddle-wheel, under various conditions of engine power, and experience\r\nhas shown that, under circumstances which admit of the screw propeller\r\nbeing favorably applied, it is equal to the paddle-wheel as an\r\neffective means of applying engine power to the propulsion of the\r\nvessel.\" Again:\r\n\r\nI recently addressed to Mr. Atherton the following question: \"Taking\r\ntwo ships of the same _size, displacement, and power, or coal_, the\r\none a side-wheel, the other screw: What will be their relative _speed\r\nand carrying capacity_ in smooth water? What in a sea-way, or in\r\nregular transatlantic navigation?\" He replied under address, \"Woolwich\r\nRoyal Dock Yard, 14 Sept., 1857:\r\n\r\n\"It is my opinion, based on experiment, that a well-applied screw is\r\nquite equal to the paddle-wheel for giving out the power by which it\r\nis itself driven, that is, in smooth water. I can not say from\r\nobservation or experience what is the comparative operation at sea.\"\r\n\r\nI addressed the same inquiry to Mr. Robert Murray, of Southampton, who\r\nhas written an able work, entitled, \"The Marine Engine,\" and who is\r\nconsidered excellent authority, and have from him the following reply,\r\ndated Southampton, 19 Sept., 1857:\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the relative efficiency of the paddle-wheel and screw\r\nfor full-powered mail steamers, I am disposed to prefer the\r\npaddle-wheel for _transatlantic_ steaming, in which the vessel has to\r\ncontend with so much rough weather and heavy sea, and the screw for\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Pacific routes.\r\n\r\n\"For auxiliary steamers of any kind the screw has manifestly the\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the actual speed obtained from each mode of propulsion\r\nin vessels of the same power and form, and with the propeller in its\r\nbest trim, I am disposed to prefer the paddle-wheel, either in smooth\r\nwater, or when steaming head to wind, but in other conditions the\r\nscrew.\" What he means by \"other conditions,\" is evidently when the\r\nscrew is running with a fair wind, which is seldom, so as to use her\r\nsails. Bourne also states very clearly in two places that the\r\npropeller is by no means so efficient in a sea-way, as a side-wheel\r\nsteamer, and admits that when a vessel is steaming at eleven or twelve\r\nknots per hour, the sails not only do not aid her, but frequently\r\nmaterially retard her motion. (_See Bourne, page 237._)\r\n\r\nAll of these authorities agree that the application of a given power\r\nproduces about the same effect, whether through the side-wheel or the\r\nscrew; and if so, it is evident that the screw can not attain the same\r\nspeed as the side-wheel, without burning as much fuel, and having as\r\ncostly and as heavy engines and boilers. Indeed, taking the whole\r\nevidence together, it appears well settled by these authorities, that\r\nthe screw is equal to the side-wheel only in smooth water, and that,\r\nas a consequence of this distinction, it is not equal to it in general\r\nocean navigation. It has been seen that much of its power is lost when\r\nit contends with head-winds and seas, and that when it has attained a\r\nfair average mail speed, the wind will help it very little, if any,\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances. It is, therefore, reasonable\r\nto infer that it would cost more to attain a high average mail speed\r\nwith the propeller than with the side-wheel. If in attaining this\r\naverage mail speed the advantages are clearly in favor of the\r\nside-wheel, there is no hope that we shall accomplish the mail service\r\nat cheaper rates than heretofore, as this agency can not be introduced\r\ntoward that end; for not only is the prime cost of the steamer the\r\nsame, as also the consumption of fuel per mile, but there are other\r\nand numerous disadvantages connected with the propeller, which are\r\nwholly unknown to the side-wheel.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that propellers are compelled to be placed\r\nupon the docks three or four times as often as side-wheels. The screw\r\neither breaks, and must be replaced by another, or it cuts the boxes\r\nout, or works the stern of the vessel to pieces. Any one of these\r\nrequires that the steamer shall be docked, however great the expense;\r\nand as these accidents are constantly occurring in even the best\r\nconstructed and best regulated propellers, it follows that they must\r\nbe constantly on the docks. This species of vessel being built\r\nnecessarily narrower than the side-wheel, it rolls more, and is found\r\nto be an exceedingly disagreeable passenger vessel. Propellers have\r\nbecome deservedly unpopular the world over; and if it were possible\r\nfor them to be faster than the side-wheel, it is hardly probable that\r\nfirst-class passengers would even then go by them, as they are known\r\nto be so exceedingly uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe propeller, I have before said, is erroneously supposed to run more\r\ncheaply than the side-wheel. I think that I have shown that as a mail\r\npacket it will cost more to run it at a given speed. But there are\r\ncertain cases in which it does run more cheaply; these are, however,\r\nonly where the speed is low, and the machinery not geared, and where,\r\nas a consequence, sail can be used to more advantage than on a\r\nside-wheel. The economy is not the result of the application of the\r\npower by the screw, as compared with the side-wheel, but of the sail\r\nalone; and this economy is more or less, just as canvas is employed\r\nmore or less in the propulsion. The screw is the better form of\r\nsteamer for using sail; and the low speed at which propellers\r\ngenerally run, is a means of making that sail more effective. We have\r\nalready seen, in the section on the cost of steam, that it generally\r\nrequires twice the original quantity of fuel to increase the speed\r\nfrom eight to ten knots per hour in either style of steamer. Now, it\r\nis a well-known fact that the transatlantic propeller lines are on the\r\naverage more than two knots per hour short of the speed of the\r\nside-wheels, which makes their passages across the Atlantic from two\r\nto six days longer than by the mail packets. They thus save from one\r\nhalf to two thirds of the fuel, and deducting its prime cost from the\r\nbill of expenses, they add to that of receipts the freight on the\r\ncargo, which occupies the space of the coal saved. They consequently\r\nrun on much smaller expenses; but only when their speed is less than\r\nthat of the side-wheels, and far too low for effective postal\r\nservice. Economy thus purchased at the expense of speed may do for\r\nfreight, and enable propellers to derive some profits from certain\r\ncargoes; but it can never subserve the purposes of mails and\r\npassengers. It must alway be recollected that the effective speed of\r\nthe propeller is reduced just in the ratio of the greater economy as\r\ncompared with the side-wheel.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that with any appreciable economy the propeller must\r\nbe slower than the side-wheel; and that with any considerable economy\r\nit can be but little faster than sail. It has, however, the advantage\r\nover sail of being rather more reliable and punctual, and can make\r\narrivals and departures rather more matters of certainty. This at the\r\nsame time secures to it a better class of freights as well as vast\r\nnumbers of emigrants which together, enable it to incur the extra\r\nexpense over a sailing vessel. The cargo is less in the propeller than\r\nin the sail, as much of the room is occupied by the engines, boilers,\r\nand fuel. Hence, the prices must be proportionally higher to meet the\r\ndeficit arising from the smaller quantity. But there are very few\r\ntrades in which propellers can run as noticed on so long a voyage as\r\n3,000 to 4,000 miles; and these lie between a few countries in Europe\r\nand the ports of the United States. Their support arises chiefly from\r\nthe emigrant trade; as without this their freights would not on any\r\nknown lines enable them to run one month. And this is not simply an\r\nassumption of theory, but the experience of all the European lines. I\r\nwas recently told in England and France by many persons who had no\r\ninterest or desire to deceive me, that propeller stock was invariably\r\na burthen to every body having any thing to do with it, and could\r\ngenerally be bought at sixty to seventy cents on the dollar, while\r\nmuch of it would not bring half of its cost price. They cited as an\r\nevidence the fact that no line of propellers is permanent, unless in\r\nsome way connected with a subsidized company, as in the case of the\r\nCunard screws running between Liverpool and New-York. The Glasgow line\r\nis also an exception, and is said to pay dividends. The screw lines\r\nare always hunting a home and a new trade. (_See views of Mr. Murray,\r\npage 111._)\r\n\r\nThe only way in which some lines can run is by getting their stock at\r\nhalf its value and thus having to pay the interest on a smaller sum.\r\nThe \"General Screw Steam shipping Company\" is an example. The Company\r\nhad from the first lost money, although they had nine fine steamers,\r\nand were compelled finally to close up and sell out. Mr. Croskey, the\r\nUnited States Consul at Southampton, supposed that they might be put\r\ninto a new trade and make a living on a smaller capital stock; that\r\nis, if the new company should get them at half their value. The\r\ntransfer was made and the \"European and American Steamship Company\"\r\nwas established. Some of the vessels were put into the trade between\r\nBremen and London, Southampton, and New-York; some between Antwerp and\r\nBrazil; and some between Hamburg and Brazil. None of these lines have\r\npaid, except, perhaps, the New-York, which has had large cargoes of\r\nemigrants; and Mr. Croskey freely acknowledges that the new Company\r\nwould have been ruined but for the Indian Revolt, which enabled him to\r\ncharter five of the vessels to the Government at good prices, for the\r\nconveyance of troops by way of the Cape of Good Hope to India. Had the\r\nlines on which they were running been profitable they would never have\r\nbeen chartered to the Government. But like the whole propeller service\r\nof the world, this Company took the chances; and it may be safely\r\nasserted that but for the opportunities which vessels of this class\r\nfind for chartering to the Government they could not live on their own\r\nenterprise three years. The number of these vessels is now very\r\nunnecessarily large; and many of them have been built to supply labor\r\nto the establishments, and for taking the chances of Government\r\nemployment at high prices. Their largest employment results from\r\ncasualties rather than from the pursuit of legitimate trade. But the\r\nbusiness is overdone, even for the English market, when foreign war is\r\nrather the rule, and peace the exception. But few propellers are now\r\nbuilding; these few being small and intended for the coasting, or the\r\nshort-line Continental trade, where they will readily pay. (_See page\r\n42 for propeller stock; also pages 44 and 45 for the propeller\r\ncoasting service._)\r\n\r\nIt does not materially alter the complexion of this question to say\r\nthat propellers are generally constructed of iron. There is not such a\r\ndifference in their prime cost or their stowage capacity as to enable\r\nthem to take the large receipts necessary to their support; while\r\ncertainly there is no advantage to be gained in speed from iron as a\r\nmaterial of construction. The iron propeller can be constructed\r\ncheaper than the wooden in Great Britain, because of the great\r\nscarcity of timber and the large and redundant quantity of iron; and\r\nan iron vessel has some advantage in being able to stow a larger\r\ncargo, from the fact that her sides and bottom are not so thick as\r\nthose of wooden vessels; but these considerations do not very\r\nmaterially affect the consumption of fuel, and the quantity necessary\r\nto carry a ton of freight. Iron is probably a better material than\r\nwood for the construction of propellers, as the part about the stern,\r\nwhere the screw works, can be made stronger, and as all iron vessels\r\ncan be rather more readily divided into water-tight compartments by\r\nbulkheads. Yet as a material of construction it offers no transcendent\r\nadvantages over the side-wheel for transatlantic navigation, while it\r\nis not probably so safe, or so comfortable for passengers. Yet, it\r\nwill be well for us to adopt the propeller largely in our coasting\r\ntrade, and iron as the material of its construction.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen that to save fuel and carry freight, the speed of\r\nthe propeller must be low; indeed very low, if it is to live on its\r\nown receipts. It is therefore clearly impossible that with such\r\ncomparatively low speed it should carry the mail. Neither can it\r\nsupport itself except by this low speed. By running thus but a\r\nfraction faster than the sailing vessel, it can command on a few\r\nprominent lines a large freight; but to give vessels of such speed a\r\nsubsidy for carrying the mails would be both to render the mail\r\nservice inefficient, and to enable the propeller to compete with the\r\nsailing lines of the country at very undue advantage, which would be\r\nan unfair discrimination against all sailing interests. Should the\r\npropeller, like the side-wheel, run fast enough on the average trips\r\nof the year to carry the mails, which would certainly be at the\r\nexpense and abandonment of any considerable freighting business, then\r\nthe Government might with propriety pay for the mails, as these\r\nsteamers would not injure the freighting business of sailing vessels.\r\nThe outcry by sail owners against steamers as competitors can not be\r\nagainst the mail packets; for these carry but little freight; but\r\nagainst these slow screws which should be treated like all other\r\nfreighting vessels, notwithstanding the fact that some of their owners\r\nhave had the impudence to propose them for the paid mail service and\r\nto ask a subsidy from the Government, but the better to cripple the\r\ninterests of sailing vessels. As well might Government subsidize fast\r\nclippers, because they are a little faster than regular, ordinary\r\nsailers. When the steamer runs with sufficient rapidity for the mails,\r\nthe sailing ship has nothing to fear from competition, and has all the\r\nbenefits of the more rapid correspondence. Thus, Government must pay\r\nonly where there is a fast mail, whether it be in a side-wheel or\r\npropeller; otherwise it destroys individual competition and cripples\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\nIf, as we have seen from all the facts regarding the expense of\r\nrunning steamers, individual enterprise can not supply adequately\r\nrapid ocean postal facilities, and if such facilities are yet wholly\r\nindispensable to the commerce, the people, and the Government, the\r\nonly alternative presented is for the Government to pay for them, and\r\nto require, as it has of all the American lines, such a speed as to\r\nprevent injurious competition to sailing vessels and private\r\nenterprise. Much capital is made by certain ship owners out of what\r\nthey call the undue discrimination of subsidies against their vessels;\r\nbut they can never lay this charge at the door of the fast and very\r\nexpensive mail packets, or elsewhere than upon the slow auxiliary\r\npropellers which any of them have a right to attempt to run, and which\r\nthe Government never did and never will subsidize. This is the source\r\nand the only source of all the vaunted injurious effects of steam on\r\nthe sailing stock of the country. It is a question with which the\r\nGovernment has nothing to do, and which must be settled between\r\npropeller owners and sail owners themselves, and with reference,\r\nperhaps, to the wishes of their customers. Mail steamers have enough\r\nto do to get money to pay their coal, provision, repair, and\r\ninnumerable extras bills, without wrangling over the freighting\r\nbusiness. And, from all this we conclude that the only means of the\r\nGovernment securing an adequate mail speed is by paying for it. (_See\r\nremarks of Committee on this subject, Paper E._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE?\r\n\r\n    RESUME OF THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS AND ARGUMENTS: IT IS THE DUTY OF\r\n    THE GOVERNMENT TO FURNISH RAPID STEAM MAILS: OUR PEOPLE APPRECIATE\r\n    THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCE, AND OF LIBERAL POSTAL FACILITIES: THE\r\n    GOVERNMENT IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE: IT MUST\r\n    FOSTER THEIR INTERESTS AND DEVELOP THEIR INDUSTRY: THE WANT OF\r\n    SUCH MAILS HAS CAUSED THE NEGLECT OF MANY PROFITABLE BRANCHES OF\r\n    INDUSTRY: AS A CONSEQUENCE WE HAVE LOST IMMENSE TRAFFIC: THE\r\n    EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING SYSTEM AND OURS: FIELDS OF TRADE NATURALLY\r\n    PERTAINING TO US: OUR ALMOST SYSTEMATIC NEGLECT OF THEM: WHY IS\r\n    GREAT BRITAIN'S COMMERCE SO LARGE: CAUSES AND THEIR EFFECTS: HER\r\n    WEST-INDIA LINE RECEIVES A LARGER SUBSIDY THAN ALL THE FOREIGN\r\n    LINES OF THE UNITED STATES COMBINED: INDIFFERENCE SHOWN BY\r\n    CONGRESS TO MANY IMPORTANT FIELDS OF COMMERCE: INSTANCES OF MAIL\r\n    FACILITIES CREATING LARGE TRADE: THE PENINSULAR AND ORIENTAL\r\n    COMPANY'S TESTIMONY: THE BRITISH AND BRAZILIAN TRADE: SOME\r\n    DEDUCTIONS FROM THE FIGURES: CALIFORNIA SHORN OF HALF HER GLORY:\r\n    THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT MISERS: THEY WISH THEIR OWN PUBLIC\r\n    TREASURE EXPENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR INDUSTRY: OUR\r\n    COMMERCIAL CLASSES COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE\r\n    PRIVILEGE OF COMPETING WITH OTHER NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Conceded_ (Section I.) _that steam mails upon the ocean control\r\nthe commerce and diplomacy of the world; that they are essential to\r\nour commercial and producing country; that we have not established the\r\nocean mail facilities commensurate with our national ability and the\r\ndemands of our commerce; and that we to-day are largely dependent on,\r\nand tributary to our greatest commercial rival, Great Britain, for the\r\npostal facilities, which should be purely national, American, and\r\nunder our own exclusive control:_\r\n\r\n2. _Conceded_ (Section II.) _that fast ocean mails are exceedingly\r\ndesirable for our commerce, our defenses, our diplomacy, the\r\nmanagement of our squadrons, our national standing, and that they are\r\ndemanded by our people at large:_\r\n\r\n3. _Conceded_ (Section III.) _that fast steamers alone can furnish\r\nrapid transport to the mails; that these steamers can not rely on\r\nfreights; that sailing vessels will ever carry staple freights at a\r\nmuch lower figure, and sufficiently quickly; that while steam is\r\neminently successful in the coasting trade, it can not possibly be so\r\nin the transatlantic freighting business; and that the rapid transit\r\nof the mails and the slower and more deliberate transport of freight\r\nis the law of nature:_\r\n\r\n4. _Conceded_ (Section IV.) _that high, adequate mail speed is\r\nextremely costly, in the prime construction of vessels, their repairs,\r\nand their more numerous employees; that the quantity of fuel consumed\r\nis enormous, and ruinous to unaided private enterprise; and that this\r\nis clearly proven both by theory and indisputable facts as well as by\r\nthe concurrent testimony of the ablest writers on ocean steam\r\nnavigation:_\r\n\r\n5. _Conceded_ (Section V.) _that ocean mail steamers can not live on\r\ntheir own receipts; that neither the latest nor the anticipated\r\nimprovements in steam shipping promise any change in this fact; that\r\nself-support is not likely to be attained by increasing the size of\r\nsteamers; that the propelling power in fast steamers occupies all of\r\nthe available space not devoted to passengers and express freight; and\r\nthat steamers must be fast to do successful mail and profitable\r\npassenger service:_\r\n\r\n6. _Conceded_ (Section VI.) _that sailing vessels can not\r\nsuccessfully transport the mails; that the propeller can not transport\r\nthem as rapidly or more cheaply than side-wheel vessels; that with any\r\nconsiderable economy of fuel and other running expenses, it is but\r\nlittle faster than the sailing vessel; that to patronize these slow\r\nvessels with the mails the Government would unjustly discriminate\r\nagainst sailing vessels in the transport of freights; that we can not\r\nin any sense depend on the vessels of the Navy for the transport of\r\nthe mails; that individual enterprise can not support fast steamers;\r\nand that not even American private enterprise can under any conditions\r\nfurnish a sufficiently rapid steam mail and passenger marine: then,_\r\n\r\nThe inference is clear and unavoidable, and we come irresistibly to\r\nthe conclusion, that it is the duty of the Government to its people to\r\nestablish and maintain an extensive, well-organized, and rapid steam\r\nmail marine, for the benefit of production, commerce, diplomacy,\r\ndefenses, the character of the nation, and the public at large; and as\r\nthere is positively no other source of adequate and effective support,\r\nto pay liberally for the same out of any funds in the national\r\ntreasury, belonging to the enterprising, liberal, and enlightened\r\npeople of the Republic. There is no clearer duty of the Legislative\r\nand Executive Government to the industrious people of the country than\r\nthe establishment of liberal, large, and ready postal facilities, for\r\nthe better and more successful conduct of that industry, whether those\r\nfacilities be upon land or upon the sea. It is sometimes difficult to\r\nextend our vision to any other sphere than that in which we move and\r\nhave our experiences; and thus there are many persons who, while they\r\nwould revolt at the idea that the Government should refuse to run\r\nfour-horse coaches to some little unimportant country town, would be\r\nwholly unable to grasp the great commercial world and the wide oceans\r\nover which their own products are to float, and from whose trade the\r\nGovernment derives the large duties which prevent these same persons\r\nhaving to pay direct taxes. They do not understand the necessity of\r\ncommerce, to even their own prosperity, or of the innumerable steam\r\nmail lines which must convey the correspondence essential to the safe\r\nand proper conduct of that commerce. But the great mass of the\r\nAmerican people understand these questions, understand the reflex\r\ninfluences of all such facilities, and knowing how essential they are\r\nto the proper development of enterprise and industry in whatever\r\nchannel or field, boldly claim it as a right that easy postal\r\ncommunication shall be afforded them as well upon the high seas as\r\nupon the interior land routes.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that the government of a country is\r\nestablished for the benefit of the people; and constitutions\r\nconflicting with this purpose are simply subversive of justice and\r\nliberty. If labor is a thing so desirable and so noble in a people\r\nthat the protection of its rewards in the form of property becomes one\r\nof the highest attributes of good government, then it is equally an\r\nindisputable attribute of that protecting and fostering government to\r\nafford those facilities to labor, which experience shows that it\r\nneeds, and which the people can not attain in their individual\r\ncapacity, or without the intervention of the government. It is idle\r\nfor a government to say to the people that they are free, when it\r\ndenies to them the ordinarily approved means of making and conserving\r\nwealth. The common experience of mankind points to commerce as the\r\nnext great means to production in creating national and individual\r\nwealth. It equally shows us that foreign commerce can not flourish\r\nwithout liberal foreign mail facilities, and the means of ready\r\ntransit of persons, papers, and specie. It also clearly indicates\r\nthat the most successful means of accomplishing this, is the\r\nemployment of subsidized national mail steamships. It therefore\r\nbecomes obviously the duty of a paternal government to an industrious,\r\nenterprising, producing, and trading people, to give them the rapid\r\nocean steam mails necessary to the profitable prosecution of their\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nWe have for many years neglected many important fields of foreign\r\ntrade, and many profitable branches of industry and art, which we\r\ncould easily have nurtured into sources of income and wealth, by\r\nadopting the foreign mail system, so wisely introduced and extended by\r\nGreat Britain. And in the absence of such efforts on our part, a large\r\nand remunerative traffic has been swept from us, and this suicidal\r\nneglect has been the means of our subordination to so many controlling\r\nforeign influences. We are at this very hour commercially enslaved by\r\nEngland, France, Brazil, and the East. How is it that the trade of the\r\nworld is in the hands of Great Britain; that she absorbs most of every\r\nnation's raw material; and that she and France supply the world with\r\nten thousand articles of industry, that should furnish work to our\r\nmanufacturers, and freight to our ships? There are some who will say\r\nthat it is because of her manufacturing system. Grant it. But how did\r\nshe establish that imperious, and overshadowing, and powerful system,\r\nand how does she keep it up? Her energetic people have ever had the\r\nfostering care of her government. Their steam mail system has been\r\nestablished for twenty-four years. It has furnished the people with\r\nthe means of easy transport, rapid correspondence, the remittance of\r\nspecie, and the shipment of light manufactured goods to every corner\r\nof the world; it has invited foreigners from every land to her shores\r\nand her markets; and it has been the means of throwing the raw\r\nmaterial of the whole world into the lap of the British manufacturer\r\nand artisan, and enabling them thus to control the markets in every\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBut we can get along, it is said, without such a manufacturing system\r\nand such an ubiquity of trade. This is a mistake. The productions of\r\nour soil are not sufficiently indispensable to the outer world to\r\nbring us all of the money we need for importing the millions of\r\nforeign follies, to which our people have become attached. It is not\r\nright or best for us that while our \"Lowell Drillings\" stand\r\npreeminent over the world, we should so far neglect the Brazilian, La\r\nPlatan, New-Granadian, Venezuelan, and East-Indian trade, that\r\nManchester shall continue, as she now does, to manufacture an inferior\r\nfabric, post it off by her steamers, forestall the market, and cheat\r\nus out of our profits; and that, by means of the reputation which our\r\nskill has produced. And a few more crises like the one through which\r\nwe have just begun to pass, will open our eyes to the necessity of\r\ndoing something ourselves to make money, and show that foreign trade\r\nin every form, and the sale of every species of product known to the\r\nindustry of a skillful people, must be watched with jealous national\r\nand individual care, and nurtured as we would nurture a young and\r\ntender child. There are many fields of trade which may be said to\r\npertain naturally to this country, and which we have as wholly\r\nneglected and yielded to Great Britain, as if she had a divine right\r\nto the monopoly of the entire commerce of the world. No one can\r\nbelieve that the trade of the islands which gem the Carribbean Sea and\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, or the great Spanish Main, or the Guianas, or the\r\nOrinoco and Amazon, or the extended coast of Brazil, the Platan\r\nRepublics, or Mexico, and the Central American States lying just at\r\nour door, belongs naturally to Europe, or that their productions\r\nshould be transported in European ships, or that their supplies come\r\nnaturally five thousand miles across the ocean, rather than go a few\r\nhundred miles from our own shores, in our own ships, and for the\r\nbenefit of our own merchants and producers. Yet, such is the\r\nimpression which our apathy of effort in those regions would produce.\r\nWe have acted as if our people had no right of information concerning\r\nthe West-Indies and South-America, until it had gone to Europe and\r\nbeen emasculated of all its virtues.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of the Pacific South-American, the Chinese, and\r\nthe East-Indian trade. That of the Pacific coast is not half so far\r\nfrom us, as it is from Europe; that of China, and the East-Indies, and\r\nAustralia, is by many thousand miles nearer to us; and yet the greater\r\nportion of the commerce of all three of those great fields is\r\ntriumphantly borne off by Great Britain alone. And why is all this?\r\nWhy is her foreign trade sixteen hundred millions of dollars per year,\r\nwhile ours is only seven hundred millions? Causes can not fail to\r\nproduce their effects; and prime causes, however little understood in\r\ntheir half obscure workings, are yet made manifest as the sun at\r\nnoon-day by effects so brilliant and important as these. Here, as\r\never, the tree is known by its fruits. The tree of knowledge, of\r\nBritish wisdom, \"whose mortal taste brought death into our world,\" our\r\nWestern world of commerce, \"with loss of Eden,\" and many a fair\r\nparadise of enterprise and effort, has filled the bleak little islands\r\nof Britain with the golden fruits of every clime, and scattered\r\nbroadcast among its people the rich ambrosia of foreign commerce. When\r\nit was necessary to command the trade of the West-Indies, Central\r\nAmerica, and Mexico, lying at our southern door, she established the\r\nRoyal Steam Packet service with thirteen lines and twenty steamers,\r\nand paid it for the first ten years L240,000, and for the present\r\ntwelve years L270,000 per annum. In addition to this she pays L25,000\r\nper annum for continuing the same lines down the west coast of\r\nSouth-America to Valparaiso, and contracts to pay the Royal Mail\r\nCompany an annual addition of L75,000 in the event of coal, freight,\r\ninsurance, etc., being at anytime higher than they were at the date of\r\nthe contract in 1850. This aggregate sum of L295,000, or $1,475,000,\r\nto say nothing of the increased allowance of L75,000 probably now paid\r\nto this one branch alone of the British service, is considerably\r\ngreater than that paid for the entire foreign mail service of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a very extraordinary fact that, with such a field of\r\ncommerce lying along the sunny side of our republic, and with such an\r\narray of facilities for converting it into European channels, our\r\nGovernment has done literally nothing to protect the rights of its\r\ncitizens and give them the means, which they do not now possess, of a\r\nfair competition with other countries for this rich and remunerative\r\ntrade. Yet such is the fact; all of the petitions and memorials of the\r\nseaboard cities to the contrary notwithstanding. The same is the case\r\nwith the Pacific and East-India trade before noticed. While we have a\r\nnoble chain of communication between the Eastern States and California\r\nand Oregon, which is manifestly essential to the integrity of the\r\nUnion and the continued possession of our rich Western territory;\r\nwhile California is admirably situated to command the trade of those\r\nvast regions and concentrate it in the United States; while the\r\nBritish have several lines to China, the Indies, Australia, and\r\nSouthern as well as Western Africa; and while our citizens have\r\npetitioned Congress year after year for even the most limited steam\r\nmail facilities to those regions, which could be afforded at the\r\nsmallest price, it is truly astonishing that these facts and petitions\r\nhave hitherto been treated with contempt, and almost ruled out of\r\nCongress as soon as presented. Such has been the course of action\r\nthat, instead of fostering foreign commerce and encouraging the\r\nenterprise and industry of the people, the Government has really\r\nrepressed that enterprise, and practically commanded the intelligent\r\ncommercial classes of this country to look upon foreign trade as\r\nforbidden fruit which it was never intended should be grown upon our\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disputed that foreign mail steamers, by creating\r\nalmost unlimited facilities for the conduct of trade, greatly increase\r\nthe commerce of the nation with the countries to which they run. The\r\nevidences of this position are patent all around us, and too evident\r\nto need recital. The growth of our trade with Germany, France,\r\nSwitzerland, and Great Britain since the establishment of the Bremen,\r\nHavre, and Liverpool lines of steamers has been unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of our commerce. That with California has sprung up as by\r\nmagic at the touch of steam, and has assumed a magnitude and\r\npermanence in eight years which but for the steam mail and passenger\r\naccommodations created, could not have been developed under thirty\r\nyears. The mail accommodations have wholly transformed our commerce\r\nwith Havana and Cuba, until they are wrested from foreign commercial\r\ndominion, as reason suggests that they must ere long be from foreign\r\npolitical thraldom. As well might Europe attempt to attach the little\r\nisland of Nantucket to some of her own dynasties as to deprive the\r\nUnited States of the control of the trade of Cuba so long as her steam\r\nlines are continued to that island.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson, the Managing Director of the Peninsular and Oriental\r\nCompany, recently testified before a Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, that, \"the advantages of the communication (between England\r\nand Australia) should not be estimated merely by the postage. After\r\nsteam communication to Constantinople and the Levant was opened, our\r\nexports to those quarters increased by L1,200,000 a year. The actual\r\nvalue of goods exported from Southampton alone, last year, (1848-9,)\r\nby those steamers is nearly L1,000,000 sterling. Greek merchants\r\nstate that the certainty and rapidity of communication enable them to\r\nturn their capital over so much quicker. Forty new Greek\r\nestablishments have been formed in this country since steam\r\ncommunication was established. The imports in that trade, fine raw\r\nmaterials, silk, goats' hair, etc., came here to be manufactured.\r\nSupposing the trade to increase one million, and wages amount to\r\nL600,000, calculating taxes at 20 per cent., an income of revenue of\r\nL120,000 would result from steam communication.\"\r\n\r\nI am prepared to speak from my own observation, and from the reliable\r\nstatistics of the Brazilian Government, from the pen of the late Prime\r\nMinister, the _Marquis of Parana_, a few facts of the same nature\r\nrelative to the trade between Great Britain and the Brazilian Empire.\r\nIn a paper which I prepared for the New-York Historical Society, and\r\npublished in \"_Brazil and the Brazilians_,\" Philadelphia, Childs &\r\nPeterson, I said, at page 618, in speaking of the trade of Great\r\nBritain:\r\n\r\n\"From 1840 to 1850 her total imports from Brazil made no increase. In\r\n1853, they had advanced one hundred and fifty per cent. on 1848; and,\r\nin 1855, they had advanced over 1848--or the average of the ten years\r\nnoticed--about three hundred per cent. This, however, it must be\r\nrecollected, was in coffee, for reexportation; a trade which was lost\r\nto our merchants and to our shipping. Her total exports to Brazil from\r\n1840 to 1850 were stationary at about two and a half million pounds\r\nsterling annually. In 1851--the first year after steam by the Royal\r\nMail Company--they advanced forty per cent.; and, in 1854, they had\r\nadvanced one hundred and two per cent. on 1850. Thus, her exports have\r\ndoubled in five years, from a stationary point before the\r\nestablishment of steam mail facilities; whereas ours have been\r\nthirteen years in making the same increase. The total trade between\r\nBrazil and Great Britain has increased in an unprecedented ratio. The\r\ncombined British imports and exports, up to 1850, averaged L3,645,833\r\nannually; but, in 1855, these had reached L8,162,455. Thus, _the\r\nBritish trade increased two hundred and twenty-five per cent. in five\r\nyears after the first line of steamers was established to Brazil_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the analysis of the tables presenting these facts I had occasion to\r\nmake the following deductions, page 619:\r\n\r\n\"We see, from a generalization and combination of these tables and\r\nanalyses, that our greatest advance in the Brazilian trade has arisen\r\nfrom imports instead of exports; whereas the trade of Great Britain\r\nhas advanced in both; and particularly in her exports, which were\r\nalready large; the tendency being to enrich Great Britain and to\r\nimpoverish us: that until 1850 her exports were stationary, while ours\r\nwere increasing; due, doubtless, to the superiority of our clipper\r\nships at that period, which placed us much nearer than England to\r\nBrazil: that she is now taking the coffee-trade away from us, and\r\ngiving it to her own and other European merchants and shipping: that\r\nshe is rivalling us in the rubber-trade; wholly distancing us in that\r\nof manufactures: and that from 1850 to 1855 she has doubled a large\r\ntrade of profitable exports, and increased her aggregate imports and\r\nexports two hundred and twenty-five per cent.; whereas it has taken us\r\nthirteen years to double a small trade, composed mostly of imports: it\r\nbeing evident that, with equal facilities, we could outstrip Great\r\nBritain in nearly all the elements of this Brazil trade, as we were\r\ndoing for the ten years from 1840 to 1850.\r\n\r\n\"It will hardly be necessary to suggest to the wise and reflecting\r\nmerchant or statesman the evident causes producing this startling\r\neffect. It is the effect of steamship mail and passenger facilities,\r\nso well understood by the wise and forecasting British statesmen who\r\nestablished the Southampton, Brazil, and La Plata lines; not as a\r\nmeans of giving revenue to the General Post-Office, but of encouraging\r\nforeign trade and stimulating British industry. If England by steam\r\nhas overtaken and neutralized our clippers and embarrassed our trade,\r\nthen we have only to employ the same agent, and, from geographical\r\nadvantages, we feel assured that we will soon surpass her as\r\ncertainly, and even more effectually, than she has us. She sweeps our\r\nseas, and we offer her no resistance or competition. Not satisfied\r\nwith the Royal Mail lines, it is reported that she is making a\r\ncontract with Mr. Cunard to run another line along by the side of the\r\nRoyal Mail, from Liverpool to Aspinwall, and from Panama to the\r\nEast-Indies and China. She gains in these seas an invaluable trade,\r\nbecause she employs the proper means for its attainment and promotion,\r\nwhile we do not. Hence, although much farther off she is practically\r\nmuch nearer. Suppose that Great Britain had no steamers to the great\r\nsea at her threshold, the Mediterranean; and we had the enterprise to\r\nrun a great trunk-line to Gibraltar and Malta, and nine branches from\r\nthese termini to all the great points of commerce in Mediterranean\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa. Would we not soon command the trade of all\r\nSouthern Europe, of Western Asia, and of Africa? But we find her\r\nwisely occupying her own territory, and that it is impossible for us\r\nto get possession. If we had been there, she would soon have given us\r\ncompetition. But Great Britain did not wait for competition to urge\r\nher to her duty to her people. She could easily have continued the\r\ntrade already possessed; but she could enlarge and invigorate it by\r\nsteam, and she did it; not from outside pressure, but for the\r\nadvantages which it always presents _per se_. For the same reason we\r\nshould have established steam to the West-Indies, Brazil, the Spanish\r\nMain, and La Plata long since; to foster a trade naturally ours, but\r\npractically another's. It is preeminently necessary now when steam,\r\nunder the system of Great Britain, is ruining our trade; whereas, by a\r\nsimilar process, we could reestablish ours, if not paralyze theirs.\r\nNeutrality is impossible. Indifference to the present posture of\r\naffairs only leads to the ruin of our interests. We must advance and\r\ncontend with Great Britain and Europe step by step, and employ the\r\nmeans of which we are generally so boastful, or we will be forced to\r\nretreat from the field, and be harassed into ignominious submission.\"\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Brazil and La Plata so is it in that of the Pacific\r\nSouth-American States, and the great fields of Australia, China, and\r\nthe East-Indies generally, as before noticed. The trade of Great\r\nBritain with those regions has gone on at a rate of progression truly\r\nastonishing. Ours has continued just as much behind it as the slow and\r\nuncertain sailing vessel is behind the rapid and reliable mail\r\nsteamer. Our Pacific possessions have been shorn of half their glory\r\nand power by the refusal of those steam aids which would by the\r\npresent time have converted half the commerce of the fields mentioned\r\ninto the new channels of American enterprise and transport. The\r\ninjustice has operated equally against the people of California and\r\nOregon, and against ourselves of the East; while there is no good and\r\nvalid reason for thus making the Pacific coast the _ultima thule_ of\r\ncivilized, steam enterprise. The people of the United States, of\r\nwhatever class, are far from being misers. They do not desire an\r\neconomy of two or three millions of dollars per year, which would give\r\nthem great opportunities of obtaining wealth and power, merely that\r\nthe sum so economized may be squandered, with twenty or thirty\r\nmillions more, on schemes of doubtful expediency, and of no real or\r\npressing necessity. They do not, indeed, ask that these mail\r\naccommodations may be paid for simply because much money is uselessly\r\notherwise spent; but because these accommodations are necessary to\r\nthemselves, to the development of their enterprise and labor, and to\r\nthe general good of all the active and industrial, and, consequently,\r\nall of the worthy classes. It is a question of little importance to\r\nthe great people of this country, whether the Government expends forty\r\nmillions per year or eighty millions. But it would be a delightful\r\nconsolation to them to know that while they might be paying ten,\r\ntwenty, or thirty millions per year more than strictly necessary,\r\nthree or four millions of it at least were so appropriated as to\r\nbetter enable them to pay the large general tax for the aggregate sum.\r\nNo one hears any complaint regarding the sum necessary to support the\r\nGeneral Government, except by those in remote districts, who have but\r\nan infinitesimal interest involved, but an imaginary part of the sum\r\nto pay, and who, producing but little, and having nothing to do,\r\nassume the right to manage the affairs of those who really have\r\nsomething at stake. The American people are willing and anxious that\r\ntheir money shall be expended for their own benefit, for the benefit\r\nof those who are to come after them, and for the glory of our great\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe many instances of our dereliction in the establishment of steam\r\nmail facilities, and the failure to establish locomotive\r\naccommodations for our merchants and other business classes call\r\nloudly for a change in our affairs, and the establishment of a\r\nnational steam policy in the place of the accidental and irregular\r\nsupport hitherto given to foreign steam enterprise. The nation demands\r\nthe means of competing with other nations. We have lost much of the\r\ntrade of the world without it. The commercial men of this country\r\ncomplain bitterly that the Government gives them no facilities for\r\nconducting our trade or cultivating the large fields of enterprise\r\nsuccessfully which I have named, and competing, on fair terms, with\r\nforeign merchants. They see the West-Indies, the Spanish-American\r\nRepublics, Brazil, Central America, and Mexico, lying right at our\r\nsouthern door, and the whole Pacific coast, the East-Indies, China,\r\nthe Mauritius, Australia, and the Pacific Islands but half as far from\r\nCalifornia as from England, all much nearer to us than to Great\r\nBritain and other European countries, and offering us a trade which\r\nlarge as it necessarily is to-day, is yet destined within the coming\r\ngeneration to transcend that of all other portions of the globe\r\ncombined, in extent, in richness, and in the profits which it will\r\nyield. The capacity of these great fields for development and\r\nexpansion is indefinite and almost boundless. There is no doubt that\r\nan American trade could be developed in those regions within the next\r\nthirty years whose opulence and magnificence would rival and far\r\nsurpass our entire commerce of the world at the present time, and give\r\nto our nation a riches and a power which would enable it to shape the\r\ndestinies of the entire civilized world.\r\n\r\nOur commercial classes complain not so much that Great Britain has the\r\n_monopoly_ of this trade, which naturally belongs to the United\r\nStates; not so much that she conducts that trade by _steam\r\nfacilities_, to the detriment of us who have none; not so much that\r\nshe has _lines of steamers_ by the dozen, and weekly communication, as\r\nwell as the advantage and use of all the other European lines; but\r\nthat the citizens of the United States are not permitted to enter into\r\na fair competition for this trade. Our people probably surpass every\r\nother people in the world in individual and aggregate enterprise and\r\nenergy. They ask as few favors of the Government as any people on\r\nearth; doing every thing that is practicable, and that energy and\r\ncapital can accomplish, without the intervention of the Government.\r\nBut there are some things that, with the entire concentrated skill and\r\nability of the nation, her citizens can not accomplish; and one of\r\nthese is the maintenance of steamship mail lines upon the ocean. In\r\nordinary enterprises competition necessitates improvement; and\r\nmechanical improvement and skill, in due course of time, enable\r\nindividuals to compass ends otherwise deemed impracticable and\r\nunattainable. These attempts have all been made, in every form, with\r\nocean steam navigation. It was supposed, as elsewhere stated, that, by\r\nsuperior engines and great economy of fuel, a speed high enough for\r\nall ordinary mail purposes could be attained, and yet leave enough\r\nroom for freight and passengers to enable the income from these, at\r\nrates much higher than on sailing vessels, to pay for fuel,\r\nengineering, and the great additional cost of running a steamer. Vast\r\nengineering skill and ability have been directed to this point both in\r\nthis country and Europe; and this object has been declared the\r\ncommercial desideratum of the age. But all of these efforts have\r\nfailed in their design; so much so that there is not, to-day, more\r\nthan one permanent steam line upon the high seas of the whole world\r\nwhich is not sustained by a subsidy from some government. Many\r\nattempts have been made by British merchants to do a freighting and\r\npassenger business in _propellers_, without any mail pay, and\r\ndepending on their receipts alone. These, too, have all failed. No\r\npermanent line of these propellers has been established to any of our\r\nAmerican cities, except by subsidized companies, owning side-wheel\r\nsteamers also.\r\n\r\nThe only trade in which it has ever been supposed that steamers of any\r\ndescription whatever could carry freight is that between Europe and\r\nthe United States, where there are large quantities of rich, costly\r\ngoods, in small and valuable packages, which pay an extra rate of\r\nfreight, as express goods; but, even here, the steam freighting\r\nsystem without governmental aid has proved a failure. There have been\r\none or two cases where a steamer could make money in carrying freight\r\nand passengers alone, as between this country and California during\r\nthe early part of the gold crisis, and owing to the great distance\r\naround the Horn, as well as an unnaturally large passenger trade.\r\nThis, however, was a state of commerce wholly abnormal and of short\r\nduration, and such as is not likely to occur once in a century, or\r\nlast very long; or prove more than an infinitesimal exception to the\r\ngreat general laws of freighting and commercial transport.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has learned this doctrine from experience, and is\r\nprofiting by it. Her wise merchants and statesmen know that commerce\r\ncan be accommodated only by rapid steam mails, which have regular and\r\nreliable periods for arrival and departure; and that, although these\r\nmails cost the Government and the people something more than those\r\nslow and uncertain communications which depend on sailing vessels and\r\noverland transit, yet they are enabled, by the facilities which they\r\nafford, to monopolize and control the commerce of the world, and\r\ndivert it from even the most natural channels into the lap of British\r\nwealth. It is in this view of the subject that our merchants so justly\r\ncomplain that our Government, by refusing to give them the facilities\r\ncommensurate with the demands of the age, _deprives_ them of the\r\n_power_ or _privilege_ of competing with foreign nations, and palsies\r\ntheir hands, simply because they are not able, individually and by\r\ntheir associated capital, to do that which the Government only can do.\r\nThe reason why our mail steamers require the aid of our Government is\r\nthat foreign Governments subsidize their lines; hence our individual\r\nenterprise can not compete with their individual enterprise and that\r\nof their Government combined. The reason why foreign Governments thus\r\nsubsidize their mail lines is, that _those lines can not depend upon\r\ntheir own receipts for support, or run without Governmental aid_. This\r\nis also the prime reason for Governmental aid in running our lines.\r\nThese facts are undisputed by steamshipmen and merchants, and are\r\nverified by the practice of the whole world, and the great number of\r\nfailures in attempting to sustain steamers, from year to year, on\r\nregular lines, by their receipts alone.\r\n\r\nBeing thus unable to compete with other countries under our present\r\nlimited steam arrangements, and considering the startling expenses\r\nwhich attend the running of steamers, such as their fuel, their extra\r\nprime cost, their large repairs, their depreciation, their wages,\r\ntheir insurance, their dock charges and light dues, their shore\r\nestablishments, and the long list which comes under the head of items\r\nand accidents, it is unquestionably the duty of the Government to meet\r\nthis question in a frank and resolute manner, and afford to the people\r\nall those necessary facilities which they can get in no other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nHOW SHALL THE GOVERNMENT DISCHARGE THIS DUTY?\r\n\r\n    WE NEED A STEAM MAIL SYSTEM: HOW OUR LINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED:\r\n    AMERICAN AND BRITISH POLICY CONTRASTED: SPASMODIC AND ENDURING\r\n    LEGISLATION: MR.

I trust that it will be admitted that we can not rely on\r\nthe Sailing-ship mail, or the Naval steam mail, or the Private\r\nEnterprise mail; while it is equally evident that we can not depend on\r\nthe Foreigner's mail, or should not if we could.\r\n\r\nA first step toward this important end, and one which every interest\r\nof the country demands, is the establishment of a governmental steam\r\nmail system, a fixed steam policy, based upon common-sense, and guided\r\nby the dictates of justice to the enterprising citizen, at the same\r\ntime that it is productive of certain efficiency toward the people. It\r\ncan not be denied that our legislation on this subject has hitherto\r\nbeen that of expedients, and merely temporary arrangement. We have had\r\nno wise, immutable purpose, no great fixed rule of action. We have\r\nlaid no broad foundations for a system which should extend itself\r\nwherever our trade extended, and work equitably with all of the large\r\ninterests of the American people. When, by a spasmodic effort, we\r\nopened communication in one direction, and found that we had a few\r\nsteamers running, we became self-complacently satisfied with our\r\naction, shut our ears to all other equally urgent claims and appeals,\r\nforgot that we had simply commenced instead of having finished, and\r\ncontented ourselves with the appearance of a mail system rather than\r\nits realization. When we established the two lines to Europe, which\r\nwere positively necessary to commerce, it was not so much because\r\nthose were the only necessary lines, but because they were urged by\r\nparties who stood ready to build the ships, and run them in the\r\nservice. The California lines were established because the people\r\nwould not longer tolerate the neglect of our large and important\r\ninterests in the Pacific. But there were several other lines which\r\nwere of the greatest importance to our commerce and manufactures,\r\nextending to fields where we could have established the richest trade,\r\nbut which never enlisted the attention of Congress, simply because\r\nthere was no one who made it his special business to press them. This\r\nof itself manifested great want of a matured steam mail system, which\r\nshould operate equally on all of the great interests of the country,\r\nand extend its facilities wherever American industry and enterprise\r\ncould find a footing.\r\n\r\nWe need not only a steam system, but a fixed steam policy that shall\r\nextend from generation to generation, and operate equally, as well at\r\nall times and in all fields of American enterprise, as upon all\r\nclasses. No such system can be built up in one year or in ten years;\r\nmuch less by one spasmodic steam effort, even in the right direction,\r\nfollowed by an eternal sleep, or a total indifference. It is the work\r\nof ages. It is not a system which, if set in motion, will work on\r\nperpetually of itself, without assistance. It needs constant care and\r\nfostering; and its results prove it worthy of all the care and\r\nattention that can be expended on it. The mature system of Great\r\nBritain has not grown up in a day. It has been constantly before the\r\nBritish public during twenty-four years, and has never been neglected\r\nfor an hour. There has been no hiatus in it; for this would have\r\ndisrupted the system, broken the chain, and resulted in disastrous\r\nfailure. Neither has the one great purpose been changed every few\r\nyears to suit the caprice of some new cabinet. It was a great cardinal\r\nidea, founded in reason and justice, that has gone on maturing from\r\nyear to year; and none had the hardihood to touch it, or trifle with\r\nthe people's purpose in establishing it; not even so far as to make it\r\na passing text for demagoguery. It composed and yet composes a part of\r\nthe far-reaching and controlling policy of the British crown; a\r\npurpose limited not to the visions of to-day, or the financial crises\r\nand panics of to-morrow, or to some new field of British effort, to\r\nbe developed in a year or two; but limited to that time only, when men\r\nshall cease the strife of commerce, abandon the pursuit of wealth,\r\nyield the palm of enterprise, and unlearn the love of money and its\r\npower. There has been nothing spasmodic in this; nothing fitful,\r\nalluring, and evanescent; nothing that held out a hope to the\r\nenterprising man, and deceived him in all the essential conditions of\r\nits fulfillment in the end. It was founded in reason, founded in\r\nnecessity; and it was well determined that it should endure.\r\n\r\nIt is creditable to the administration of President Polk, that there\r\nwas one effort made in this country to found a similar judicious and\r\nfruitful system. We had until that time taken no notice whatever of\r\nmarine steam navigation; and British steamers swarmed around our coast\r\nnorth and south, thick as cruisers in a blockade. (_See Paper E._)\r\nIndeed, it was a veritable blockade of our commerce, and told most\r\ndisastrously upon our enterprise and independence. The Cabinet of Mr.\r\nPolk, headed by our present venerable Chief Magistrate of the Nation,\r\ndetermined to reverse this system, and did it as effectually as any\r\nthing can be accomplished in a country, where a given policy, however\r\nwisely inaugurated, has no guaranty or safeguard against the\r\nrevolutionary changes of new administrations. They established a basis\r\nof action, and inaugurated three steam lines under contracts which\r\nplaced them beyond the attacks of the capricious; well knowing that if\r\nthe system had merits, they would be manifested to the country within\r\nten years by the fruits of these lines. The period was shorter than\r\nthat designated by Great Britain; yet with the immensely rapid\r\ndevelopment of our people it inwrought itself into the affections of\r\nthe public so effectually, even in this short time, that none will\r\ndare risk his reputation by attacking it boldly, or by other means\r\nthan an indirect and harassing guerrilla warfare. But here the effort\r\nended, and the system, deprived of the aids and new lines which\r\nCongress should have extended it, and of that continued development\r\nwhich was necessary to its perfection and usefulness, has been left to\r\nwork itself out and die, until it may be resurrected by another great\r\ndemonstration of public sentiment, and by an administration bold\r\nenough and far-seeing enough to grasp the interests of the whole\r\ncountry, and do itself and the people justice. It is due, however, to\r\nthe reputation of a lamented and departed statesman, the large-minded\r\nand noble Gen. Rusk, of Texas, to say that he made a manly and\r\nsystematic effort in 1852, after seeing the fruitful workings of the\r\nthree lines noticed, to extend, enlarge, and fortify the good\r\nbeginnings of President Polk and Secretary Buchanan, by inaugurating\r\nseveral new lines, and establishing a permanent and recognized basis\r\nof action. But in all this he was thwarted by the machinations of\r\nnarrow-minded men, who deemed it a higher effort to agitate the\r\ncountry and endeavor to separate the North and the South, than\r\nestablish and secure those mighty aids to industry which should give\r\ndevelopment, wealth, strength, and security to the whole American\r\nUnion, and check the fratricidal blow of the disunionist.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that we shall have in this country a policy on this\r\nsubject, which shall remain untouched under the changes of\r\nadministrations, just as standard commercial laws and regulations\r\nremain untouched. No system of such magnitude can mature or cheapen\r\nwhen but a few years are assigned to it, and when there is no\r\ncertainty that it will survive the life of a single ship. Companies\r\nundertaking the mail service under such circumstances must be paid\r\nlarger sums for their general establishment, that they may be enabled\r\nto meet the exigencies and caprices of irregular legislation, which\r\nmay at the close of their contracts suddenly throw a dozen good ships\r\nout of employment. Every well-regulated and efficient company\r\nnecessarily builds new steamers through all the stages of its\r\nexistence; and when the term of its service expires, necessarily has\r\nseveral partially new ships. If the term of service is to be short,\r\nand if there is no rule by which those who do good service on a line\r\nare to have, in renewing contracts, the preference of new and untried\r\nparties, then it is reasonable to infer that they can not themselves\r\nincur the expense of so large an establishment of new and useless\r\nvessels, and that their service is either to be inefficient and\r\nunreliable, or that the department must pay a larger price than\r\nnecessary under a judicious and fixed system. The want of a reliable\r\nsystem operates injuriously both on the department and on the\r\ncontractors. It subjects us to expedients, and to all of the evils of\r\nconstant lobbying and legislation on the subject. And one of the first\r\nwants of this system is an extension of the term of contracts. The\r\nperiod hitherto assigned has not been long enough for the proper\r\ndevelopment of the service. The short term is a constant premium for\r\nbuilding an inferior class of vessels, which shall have become\r\nworthless by the time that the contract expires, so as not to entail\r\nloss upon the company. Such vessels are ever unfit for the mails or\r\npassengers. Short terms also keep the subject continually before\r\nCongress and the Executive Government, and foster that extensive and\r\ndepraved lobbying which has wrought so injuriously on our legislation.\r\nMoreover, there is no reason why the term of service should not be\r\nextended, when it will certainly simplify and cheapen it, if, as I\r\nhave assumed, the progress of engineering is not such as to throw\r\nwell-built ships out of use within twelve years, or in any way\r\nintroduce improvements by which the Government could get the service\r\nat lower rates. Nor have we any reliable hope for the future. We wait\r\nuntil commerce has been perverted into unnatural channels, and then\r\nbecome suddenly and galvanically aroused, when it is too late to\r\neffect a change until two or three years have expired in building\r\nships. We thus find ourselves in the midst of the difficulty without\r\nhaving foreseen it, and without being prepared for it. The wise man\r\nplanned the campaign before others had even contemplated any\r\ndisturbance of the peace. As a matter of course he controlled the\r\nbattle, and brought up the victory in his own way.\r\n\r\nThe only effectual means of accomplishing the foreign mail service in\r\nthis country is by liberally subsidizing private companies for a long\r\nterm of years, such as will induce them to provide first-class ships,\r\nrun them rapidly, and fit them for the most comfortable conveyance of\r\npassengers. Lord Canning in his Report to both houses of Parliament on\r\nthe contract packet system in 1853, says, after showing that the naval\r\nvessels have been abandoned for the mail service: \"There is no\r\npeculiarity in this branch of business which renders it an exception\r\nto the general rule, that work is done more cheaply by contract than\r\nby Government agency.\" But when the idea of performing the mail\r\nservice by naval vessels was wholly abandoned in 1837, another\r\nquestion of equal importance arose, as to how far the mail steam\r\npackets might be made efficient as vessels of war in times of\r\nemergency. As a consequence of the discussion nearly all of the mail\r\ncontracts made from that day until this by Great Britain contained\r\nstipulations requiring the vessels to be capable of carrying an\r\narmament, in addition to the requirements of speed and punctuality.\r\nThe same thing was done in this country in 1846-7; and one of the\r\nprincipal means of carrying the Collins bill through Congress was the\r\nself-deception of making the steamers equivalent to vessels of war. It\r\nwas a plea to which statesmen and enterprising business men resorted,\r\nand was used as a means of securing those commercial facilities which\r\nconstitutional quibblers would not vote for directly, but which they\r\nwould afford if allowed the subterfuge of \"defenses\" as a means of\r\nprotecting them against a certain set of constituencies who foolishly\r\nopposed the extension of commerce. Many of these would not grant one\r\ndollar for the aid of that commerce on which the revenues of the\r\ncountry and their own real prosperity and wealth depended; but they\r\nwere willing to suffer long and bleed freely at the old and just,\r\nthough unrenewable war-cry: \"The British and the Hessians.\" Our case\r\nwas rather different from that of Great Britain which had a large\r\nsteam navy while we had neither naval nor commercial steamers. There\r\nwas, consequently, and there yet is, more propriety in demanding a\r\ncapacity for the naval service in our vessels than in the case of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this very proper spirit we produced some of the\r\nnoblest vessels that ever floated. Stronger vessels than the Collins,\r\nAspinwall, and Pacific Mail Steamers were never built in any country.\r\nAnd although we have fortunately not been compelled to test their\r\ncapacity in naval transport or in action, yet there is no doubt that\r\nthey would do honorable and efficient service in both, and by no means\r\nsully the glory of the American colors. The establishment of these and\r\nthe Havre and Bremen lines, certainly gave an impulse to shipbuilding\r\nand the manufacture of steam machinery in this country which could\r\nhave been given in no other way, and which in a few short years has\r\ndemonstrated that we are behind no people on earth in capacity for\r\nthese noble and difficult arts. And although we are yet but in our\r\ninfancy in experience, as compared, especially with Great Britain, yet\r\nthe increasing demand for mail facilities, the necessity for a large\r\nwar marine, and the rapidly increasing coast steam service, all\r\nindicate that we shall require a large amount of this class of work\r\nand a mechanical skill to which our ingenious countrymen have thus\r\nproven themselves entirely adequate. And although it is certainly\r\nindispensable that we shall ever be provided adequately against all\r\nthe exigencies of foreign war, yet it is to be trusted that bold and\r\nfearless statesmen will support and extend our steam mail service on\r\nthe tenable grounds of its necessity to commerce and our citizens at\r\nlarge, and that its productive services will not be obscured by or\r\nsubordinated to the subterfuges and deceits of the war marine feature.\r\nLet us have steam mail facilities on high and independent grounds, and\r\nfor their benefits _per se_. The system is abundantly tenable on this\r\nground alone; on this only ground that it will probably ever\r\npractically occupy. Let us also have our war marine, efficiently\r\nseparate, as it should be. Let both systems be perfect, both\r\nindependent, both mutually conducive to the prosperity and the defense\r\nof the country. But there is no doubt that these vessels would do\r\nexcellent service in a conflict. They could swarm any particular coast\r\nwith troops in a few days. They could easily run away from dangerous\r\nvessels, or pursue and overtake others when necessary. They are alway\r\nneeded for transport, while the time will probably never again come\r\nwhen mail steamers will not be even more necessary during war than in\r\ntimes of peace. But this is not all. They fit and train a large number\r\nof marine engineers who are ever ready at a day's warning to enter\r\nefficiently on the naval service. This is a point of greater\r\nimportance than is generally supposed. Engineers, however skilled in\r\nthe shops, are wholly unfit for the service at sea until they have had\r\nmonths of experience, and become accustomed to sea-sickness. When one\r\nof our first American mail steamers sailed for Europe, no practised\r\nmarine engineer could be found to work her engines. They took a\r\nfirst-class engineer and corps of assistants from one of the North\r\nRiver packets; but as soon as the ship got to sea, and heavy weather\r\ncame on, all the engineers and firemen were taken deadly sick, and for\r\nthree days it was constantly expected that the ship would be lost.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly evident from all of the testimony, that most of the\r\nmail packets are capable of carrying a handsome armament. Mr. Atherton\r\nsays to me in his letter: \"Many of our ocean steamers are fit for\r\nnaval service of every description; and they are generally fit for all\r\ntransport service.\" The Report of Lord Canning, the British Post\r\nMaster General, to which I have referred, was made in 1853, in\r\nobedience to a Treasury Minute issued by the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, who directed the Post Master General to form a committee,\r\nand report to both houses, on the propriety of continuing and\r\nextending the mail steam packet system; as there had been suggestions\r\nthat the sum expended for the mail service was large. These gentlemen\r\nafter a lengthy investigation of several months, the examination of a\r\ngreat number of witnesses, and the record of their testimony in\r\nshorthand, made their report, accompanied by the evidence in a large\r\nvolume. At page 5 of the report, in speaking of the requirements for\r\nnaval efficiency, they say:\r\n\r\n    \"In arranging the terms of these contracts, the Government seized\r\n    the opportunity of requiring that the vessels should be\r\n    constructed in a manner that would render them as serviceable for\r\n    national defense in war as steam-packets belonging to the Crown\r\n    would have been if employed in their stead. A provision to this\r\n    effect was first inserted in the contract with the Royal Mail\r\n    Company in 1840; and in most of the existing contracts\r\n    stipulations are to be found requiring that the vessel should be\r\n    of a construction and strength fit to carry such an armament as\r\n    the Admiralty may think proper. In several cases they must be\r\n    built of wood and not of iron; and there are some contracts which\r\n    confer on the Admiralty the right of taking the ships at a\r\n    valuation when it may be thought desirable to do so.\r\n\r\n    \"Generally speaking, these stipulations have been fulfilled, as\r\n    appears from a return which has been laid before us by the\r\n    Surveyor of the Navy, showing the number, tonnage, and power of\r\n    the vessels constructed by the various companies under contract\r\n    with the Admiralty for the conveyance of the mails,\r\n    distinguishing those built of wood from those built of iron, and\r\n    stating whether the companies have in any cases violated the terms\r\n    of the contracts, and if so, whether any authority has been given\r\n    by the Board of Admiralty for the deviation. It results from this\r\n    return that out of 98 vessels which had been surveyed by the\r\n    Government officers, one only (the 'Australian') has been reported\r\n    as incapable of carrying guns if required, and two iron vessels\r\n    (the 'Levantine' and the 'Petrel') have been accepted instead of\r\n    wooden vessels, on Mr. Cunard's Halifax and Bermuda line. Two\r\n    other vessels--one belonging to the Australian Royal Mail Company,\r\n    and the other to Mr. Macgregor Laird's West Coast of Africa\r\n    line--had also been accepted (temporarily) by Admiralty authority,\r\n    although of less tonnage and power than the contracts prescribed.\r\n\r\n    \"The Surveyor's report upon most of these vessels, as regards\r\n    their fitness for war purposes, is in the following terms: 'Not\r\n    fitted for armament, but capable of carrying guns when so fitted.'\r\n    This report accords with the opinion expressed by the Committee of\r\n    Naval and Artillery officers upon the vessels which have come\r\n    under their notice. It appears, however, from the statements of\r\n    that Committee, that although the packets they have examined are\r\n    for the most part of sufficient strength to carry and fire a\r\n    certain number of guns, the expense of the alterations which would\r\n    be necessary before they could be got ready for service would be\r\n    very considerable, and that even when such alterations had been\r\n    made, the efficiency of the vessels would be very small in\r\n    proportion to their size, and that they could not encounter\r\n    hostile vessels of equal tonnage without endangering the honor of\r\n    the British flag.\r\n\r\n    \"With reference to future contracts, we are decidedly of opinion\r\n    that no expense should be incurred for the sake of imposing\r\n    conditions for giving a military character to the postal vessels.\r\n    We believe the imposition of such conditions to be a measure of\r\n    false economy. _Should a war suddenly break out, the immediate\r\n    demand for mail steamers would probably be greater than ever, and\r\n    it might be exceedingly inconvenient to withdraw them at such a\r\n    time from their legitimate use for the purpose of arming them for\r\n    battle._ Moreover, the high charge for the packet service has been\r\n    borne with the greater readiness, because it has been supposed by\r\n    some to include a provision of large but unknown amount, for the\r\n    defense of the country; while on the other hand the Naval\r\n    Estimates have sometimes been complained of as excessive, on the\r\n    ground that the force provided for was in addition to the large\r\n    reserve of postal war steamers. We accordingly recommend that for\r\n    the future the contracts for the conveyance of the mails should be\r\n    wholly free from stipulations of the nature we have been\r\n    describing, though it may be desirable in some cases to retain the\r\n    power in the Government to take possession of the vessels in the\r\n    event of national emergency.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _resume_, after considering each of the British lines\r\nseparately, the committee say:\r\n\r\n    \"An erroneous impression appears to have prevailed among the\r\n    public as to the efficiency of our postal steamers for direct\r\n    purposes of warfare. We do not believe that those who are charged\r\n    with the direction of the military affairs of the country have\r\n    ever regarded them as likely to be of any great service in an\r\n    engagement; but their advantages as an auxiliary force will be\r\n    very considerable. They will be available, in the event of the\r\n    breaking out of hostilities, for the rapid conveyance of\r\n    dispatches, of specie, and, to a certain extent, of troops and\r\n    stores. Their speed will be such as probably to secure them from\r\n    the risk of capture, and will render them highly valuable for\r\n    procuring intelligence of hostile movements. They may also be\r\n    expected to furnish the Queen's ships with men trained to\r\n    steam-navigation, and possessing an amount of local knowledge\r\n    which can not fail to be valuable in several ways.\"\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at about the same conclusions in this country as those\r\npresented by the British Post Master General to Parliament in 1853, on\r\nthis subject. And yet, with our small navy we may at any time need all\r\nof our steam packets for actual service, and the Government should\r\nalways have the right to demand them for transport service. We have\r\nabundant evidence that our mail packets are well fitted for carrying\r\nan armament, and being highly efficient in war duty. The testimony of\r\nCommodore M. C. Perry, Mr. Cunningham, and others, as published in the\r\nSpecial Report of the Secretary of the Navy, 1852, is conclusive on\r\nthis point. They found that they were built with extraordinary\r\nstrength and of good materials.\r\n\r\nMany expedients have been proposed for the transmission of our foreign\r\nmails. It is said that the late Post Master General entertained the\r\npurpose of paying some of the foreign screw lines to carry the mails,\r\nif Congress would permit it; but however all parties disapprove of the\r\ncontracted policy proposed by that gentleman, I can not believe that\r\nhe entertained any purpose so unpatriotic, and so subversive of\r\nAmerican shipping interests. It is true, however, that, as he\r\nfrequently said, he would prefer returning to the old packet system,\r\nand carrying the mails by sail, if private enterprise could not carry\r\nthem across the ocean without a subsidy. But it is a consoling\r\nreflection that these singular views of that worthy gentleman never\r\nanywhere took root in Congress. Certainly there is no reason why this\r\ngreat, and rich, and proud nation should resort, like some little\r\nseventh rate power, to expedients in the carriage of our ocean mails.\r\nWe are not so poor as to have to live by practices; not so degraded as\r\nto be willing to catch at any little thing that may pass along for\r\nresources. We have a teeming prosperity, an abundant wealth, unending\r\nresources, and a people everywhere clamorous for liberal expenditures\r\nfor adequate mails. Why shall we degrade ourselves by depending upon\r\nothers for our mail facilities? It alway humbles and mortifies me to\r\nsee one human being lick the hand of another; one who acknowledges\r\nhimself a stupid drone that must needs have a master to direct and\r\nprotect him. And so with our nation when she stoops to subserviency\r\nand begging, for even so much as the postal charities of other\r\nenterprising and commanding nations.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the Government could secure the transit of\r\nthe mails on the receipts, taking both ocean and inland postage; and\r\nindeed a temporary arrangement was made with two of our contending\r\ncompanies running to Europe, to transport them on these terms; but\r\nsuch arrangements are temporary only, and can not be made the basis of\r\nregular action. They would operate most unequally on different lines.\r\nWhile on the European lines they would pay probably one half the sum\r\nof subsidy required, on many other, and especially on new and untried\r\nlines, they would not at first pay probably one tenth. And granting\r\nthat on a given line, the receipts during fifteen years would amount\r\nto as much as the whole subsidy required for that time; yet no company\r\ncould live on them, as for the first few years the receipts from the\r\nmail would be very small, while the general income of the line from\r\npassengers and freight would also be smaller than at any other time.\r\nMoreover, almost every steam company has to borrow money largely\r\nduring its first years, in anticipation of the larger income from\r\nincreased trade during the last years of its existence. Thus, while\r\nthe system of the receipts would operate most unequally, the same\r\naggregate sum given in the form of a regular annual subsidy operates\r\nas an assurance for the company and keeps it alive. But the postal\r\nreceipts are not adequate to the support of any ocean line. In the\r\nreport before cited, the Committee say, at page 5, that the sum of\r\nsubsidy then paid was L822,390 per annum, whereas the postal receipts\r\nwere only L443,782, or but a fraction over one half. There is probably\r\nno regular service in the world where the postal receipts would pay\r\nfor the transport, especially where competition existed.\r\n\r\nIn making our contracts common-sense must dictate the lines necessary,\r\nand the general treasury should pay for them. There is no good reason\r\nwhy the sums of subsidy to be paid for mail transportation should be\r\nchargeable on the Post Office Department. Nor is it really of much\r\nconsequence where the account is settled, as the general treasury must\r\nafter all meet the bills. It may create some misapprehension as to the\r\nservices on which the sums annually voted are bestowed. But the\r\nservice, whether sea or inland, is alike incapable of sustaining\r\nitself, and is alike beneficial to every citizen of the Republic. And\r\nas this service so greatly benefits commerce, it is well that it\r\nshould be paid from the general revenues of the country; from the\r\nduties which it creates. At any rate, almost every Post Master General\r\nwill feel better disposed to subsidize ocean mail steamers adequately\r\nif the bills are payable by the treasury department, and not\r\nchargeable upon his own.\r\n\r\nIt would be well in all new contracts that the law of Congress\r\nauthorizing them should require strength of vessel, a fair dynamic\r\nefficiency of performance, water-tight bulkheads for the safety both\r\nof the vessel, and passengers and mails, and all those other\r\nsafeguards compatible with speed and mail efficiency. But the most\r\nessential point is the mode of making the contracts. We have pursued\r\ntwo system in this country, that of the lowest bidder, and that of\r\nCongressional contracts. Some have supposed that as the land mails are\r\nsubmitted to the lowest bidder, so those of the ocean ought to be\r\nalso. But the cases are very unlike. The land service is a familiar\r\nthing, which every farmer understands, because running a wagon is one\r\nof the first things in life that he learns. Every body is familiar\r\nwith the land service, and every body has more or less experimented in\r\nit, or in something very similar to it. But it is far otherwise with\r\nthat of the ocean. Steamshipping is a comparatively new, a very\r\ndifficult, and a very little understood science. But few who know its\r\ndifficulties will undertake its hazards. Steam power and its expenses\r\nare by no means understood by the people; and the first mistake made\r\nby those unacquainted with it is in supposing it much cheaper than it\r\nreally is. This mistake leads to fatal consequences in bidding for the\r\nocean service, as most of those unacquainted with the business would\r\nengage to perform a given service for less than the actual price that\r\nit would cost them, and certainly for much less than practical,\r\nexperienced men would. And herein consists one of the evils of the\r\nlowest bidder system, that inexperienced persons taking such contracts\r\neither perform them inefficiently, or appeal constantly to Congress\r\nfor relief, or for increase of their pay. Such cases are exceedingly\r\nnumerous. Post Master General Campbell said that the lowest bidder\r\nsystem was \"a nuisance.\" Senator Mallory declared in a debate about\r\nthe close of the last Congress, that it was a system which never\r\nwrought efficiently, which never gave final satisfaction, and which\r\ngenerally brought in a set of adventurers. The department and members\r\nof Congress had experienced the annoyance and inefficiency of the\r\nsystem in the contract for carrying the mails between Key West and\r\nNew-Orleans through the Gulf. It was several times given to the\r\nlowest bidder, and as often fell through; being finally awarded by\r\nprivate arrangement to other parties, at more than double the prices\r\nof the lowest bidders.\r\n\r\nIn the elaborate Report made in 1852 to the Senate by Gen. Rusk, as\r\nChairman of the Committee on the _Post Office and Post Roads_, of\r\nwhich Messrs. Soule, Hamlin, Upham, and Morton were members, in\r\nspeaking on this subject the Committee said:\r\n\r\n    \"Contracts to carry the ocean mail should, like all other\r\n    contracts made by the Government, be the subjects of a fair\r\n    competition, and granted with reference to the public good, due\r\n    regard being had to the excellence of the proposals made, under\r\n    all the circumstances of the cases which may present themselves.\r\n    Your committee are aware that it has been too much the practice to\r\n    regard the _lowest_ as the _cheapest_ bid; but experience has\r\n    taught them that _lowness of price_ and _cheapness in the end_,\r\n    are not convertible terms, as the daily applications, from _low\r\n    bidders_, to Congress for indemnity against losses incurred in the\r\n    public service, will amply demonstrate. For examples of the kind\r\n    the committee would respectfully refer to the numerous\r\n    applications for remuneration, in connection with the public\r\n    printing, which have for years past occupied the time and\r\n    attention of Congress, and threaten to continue to do so to a most\r\n    alarming extent, involving, in the end, an accumulation of expense\r\n    infinitely beyond the cost that would have attended the\r\n    performance of the work, at a fair and liberal compensation. This\r\n    may be, by some, called economy, but it is the very worst sort of\r\n    economy. It excludes the honest workman, who knows the real value\r\n    of the service to be performed, and is unwilling to undertake to\r\n    do his duty well, at the expense of himself and family; while it\r\n    lets in the needy and greedy speculator who, having nothing to\r\n    lose in point of character or money, will readily undertake what\r\n    he can not perform, and become dependent upon the magnanimity of\r\n    Congress for remuneration for his losses, real or fictitious. An\r\n    honest and fair liberality should characterize the dealings\r\n    between the Government and individuals, just as much as those\r\n    between private citizens; and, when contracts are made, they\r\n    should be entered into in the spirit of good faith, and with a\r\n    full knowledge of the risks to be run, and the expenses to be\r\n    incurred.\"\r\n\r\nIt is claimed on the other hand that in contracts made by Congress the\r\ntwo Committees have every opportunity of testing the value of the\r\nservice to be performed, of ascertaining the sum of subsidy really\r\nnecessary to its support, of giving to every applicant a fair and\r\nimpartial hearing, and of presenting to Congress any case of doubt\r\nand difficulty, or of contested right. When the committees take any\r\nline into consideration it is in effect inviting competition and\r\nproposals from every one else than the projector who supposes that he\r\nhas better claims to it, or can perform the service at cheaper rates.\r\nSuch proceedings are always open and advertised to the world for\r\nmonths and sometimes for years. And there are many persons who will\r\ncome forward and make a low bid for a service after some one else has\r\nbrought it to the attention of the Government and labored it through\r\nCongress, who would not turn their fingers over, or risk a dollar in\r\nbringing it before the nation, and securing for it a due\r\nconsideration. These are the adventurers who never produce any thing\r\nthemselves by a legitimate and honest effort, but who alway stand back\r\nto take the chances of wresting from some enterprising, more\r\nfar-seeing, and more industrious person the fruits of the toil perhaps\r\nof years. There are many enterprises in which the public have taken no\r\ninterest because ignorant of the facts. Some enterprising individual\r\ngoes zealously to work, travels thousands and tens of thousands of\r\nmiles, ascertains all of the facts bearing upon the question,\r\ndetermines its feasibility or its impracticability, spends years of\r\ntime and toil, and many thousands of dollars of money, indoctrinates\r\nthe people of his country with the new and interesting facts, travels,\r\nwrites, labors day and night for years, finally secures the attention\r\nof the Government and Congress, and asks a fair and reasonable\r\ncompensation for the necessary service which he proposes performing\r\nfor the public. He has contended with every species of opposition,\r\novercome unwonted embarrassments, foiled the machinations of selfish,\r\ninterested parties who would through all time mislead the public if\r\nthey could but continue a monopoly of trade, and finally succeeded in\r\ngetting a bill through Congress for the establishment of the\r\nlong-sought line.\r\n\r\nThis done, he supposes that he is of course to be rewarded for the\r\neffort, the toil, and the expenditure of years, and that he will have\r\nan opportunity of indemnifying himself for his losses and sacrifices.\r\nHe hears many beautiful apostrophes to the principles of equal justice\r\nand right which are said to characterize the legislation of his\r\ncountry, and control the action of the Government; but he is not\r\nprepared to hear that some adventurer has carried off his prize simply\r\nbecause by chance or by concert he has made his bid one thousand or\r\nten thousand dollars lower than the prime projector. He becomes\r\ndisheartened; finds that the country neither appreciates nor desires\r\nhonorable effort and enterprise; that it will not reward the citizen\r\nin his self-sacrificing attempts to benefit the country and himself\r\ntogether; and that it will look on with careless indifference while\r\nhis almost vested, his equitably vested rights, are neglected or\r\nstricken down. This is certainly one of the practical and demoralizing\r\neffects of the lowest bidder system, which respects no rights, however\r\nsacred, simply because based upon a dogma which is technically true.\r\nThe system of the lowest bidder is technically correct, but\r\npractically wrong. It can not be carried out in practice without\r\nabandoning equity and honest rights under the plea of technicalities\r\nand the action of chances. It is in reality but a species of gambling,\r\na miserable lottery, in which those who are most honest and truthful\r\nare invariably sacrificed. It is proper, then that Congress should not\r\nonly establish the postal routes, but also determine either\r\nspecifically or proximately the compensation to be paid; or leave this\r\nentirely to the discretion and the largest liberty of action of the\r\nPost Master General. Responsibility must attach somewhere if justice\r\nis obtained. With the lowest bidder system it rests and operates\r\nnowhere; and the most important operations of the Government are taken\r\nout of the hands of a wise public functionary and the intelligent\r\nlegislators of the country, and put into a great wheel of fortune,\r\nwhere the proper person has, probably, but one chance in a hundred.\r\nThis although true in every case of contract, is eminently so in cases\r\nof untried lines, where the experiment is to be made, and where it is\r\ngenerally necessary that an individual shall have spent years in\r\nbringing it to light.\r\n\r\nI come to the conclusion, therefore, that the Government can discharge\r\nthe clear and unquestionable duty of affording liberal mail facilities\r\nto the people, only by establishing all of the lines which the\r\ncommerce and convenience of the country and the Government require; by\r\nmaintaining them as a fixed policy of the country from generation to\r\ngeneration; by encouraging enterprising companies to continue\r\nwell-performed services, and enterprising citizens to open new avenues\r\nof trade and wealth; and by paying for the same from the general\r\ntreasury of the people, and from the revenues which these postal\r\nfacilities, more than any other series of influences, conspire to\r\nproduce and to conserve.

CANADA AND THE INDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that it is the clear and unquestionable duty of the\r\nGovernment to establish ample foreign mail facilities for the nation,\r\nand that the only means of accomplishing this is by guaranteeing a\r\nliberal allowance for a long term of years for the transport of the\r\nmails, and paying for the same from the general treasury of the\r\ncountry. We will, therefore, now examine the British ocean steam mail\r\nsystem, and shall see that the practice of that great nation fully\r\ncorroborates and sustains the views which have been advanced in the\r\npreceding chapters.\r\n\r\nThe steamship policy of that nation has not been treated as a matter\r\nof slight or secondary importance. British statesmen from the earliest\r\ndays of the development of marine steam power saw the influence which\r\nit was likely to exert in the revolutions of commerce and the control\r\nof the nations of the world, and determined, with the sagacious\r\nforesight and the firm, fixed purpose for which they are\r\ndistinguished, that it should be at once inaugurated as the great\r\ninstrument of individual wealth and national power. They properly\r\nconceived that the nation which used this transforming agent most\r\nfreely in commerce, defenses and diplomacy would unquestionably exert\r\na high controlling influence over the nations of the earth, and make\r\nevery land tributary to its wealth and power. The end justifies the\r\neffort, and the few temporary sacrifices and insignificant\r\nexpenditures which have been made. The British nation launched at once\r\ninto an extended foreign mail system which has been twenty years\r\nmaturing and untouched, and which, on a small annual expenditure, has\r\ngiven it the profitable control of every trade and every market on the\r\nface of the globe. It was wisely conceded that a long period would be\r\nnecessary to make the great experiment of marine steam mails, and that\r\nterm was granted in the outset. When the first term of twelve years\r\nhad ended, the contracts were renewed for another term of twelve\r\nyears, in every instance with the companies first authorized, and the\r\nsums of subsidy were in every case increased. Not only thus. New lines\r\nwere established all along the course of these experiments, in a quiet\r\nexecutive way, without agitation, without lobbying, without\r\ncorruption, just as the Post Master General would put some short and\r\nnecessary land route into operation. The last of these lines\r\nestablished was that in 1856, between Southampton and Australia for\r\nseven years, at an annual subsidy of L185,000, or $925,000. And this\r\nline was established, not because there was no postal communication;\r\nfor the Government already had a semi-monthly line to China, India,\r\nand Australia, and another around Africa; but because the increased\r\ndemands of British trade, and convenience to the British public, made\r\nit necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring all of this time the system has operated with unbroken\r\nregularity. Established on a great general principle, as well as the\r\nhighest possible expediency, it has been regarded as a fixed policy of\r\nthe Government and the people, and has been suffered to do its\r\nexcellent work quietly and undisturbed. The legislation introducing it\r\nwas not an accident. It was not a spasm of generosity to the people;\r\nbut it was a fixed purpose of the British public; the wise and only\r\nadequate means adapted to accomplish an important, an indispensable\r\nend. The first contract for carrying the mails in steamers, was made\r\nby the Post Master General in 1833, with the \"Mona Isle Steam\r\nCompany,\" to run semi-weekly between Liverpool and the Isle of Man at\r\nL850 per annum. This Company has run the line ever since, a period of\r\ntwenty-four years, and at the same price per annum. After this, a\r\ncontract was made in 1834 with the \"General Steam Navigation Company,\"\r\nfor the semi-weekly conveyance of the mails between London and\r\nRotterdam, and London and Hamburg, at L17,000 per year. The contract\r\nwas not annulled until 1853, nineteen years, when it was found best to\r\nsend the mail by a new route; that is, to Ostend, and over the\r\nrailways of Belgium. The first contract for a long voyage was made\r\nwith Richard Bourne, in 1837, to convey the mails weekly from Falmouth\r\nto Vigo, O Porto, Lisbon, Cadiz, and Gibraltar, for L29,600 per annum.\r\nThe contract was transferred in 1843 to the \"Peninsular and Oriental\r\nCompany,\" Southampton was substituted for Falmouth, the weekly trips\r\nwere changed to three per month, and the subsidy was reduced\r\naccordingly, or to L20,500 per annum. The service has been performed\r\non these terms ever since. The Aberdeen and Shetland contract was made\r\nin 1840, at L900 per year, after a failure to run on L600, by a\r\nprevious arrangement. It now continues as then made.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the first passage across the Atlantic was made in the\r\nAmerican steamer \"Savannah,\" which left Savannah, Georgia, on the 25th\r\nMay, 1819, and at the end of twenty-two days arrived in Liverpool,\r\nsteaming only fourteen days of the time. The Savannah was only 350\r\ntons tonnage, and had an engine of ninety horses' power. Captain Moses\r\nRogers was her commander. The \"Sirius\" arrived in New-York on the 23d\r\nof April, 1838. The steamer \"Great Western\" next followed, in the same\r\nyear. And although this was only nineteen years ago, it is instructive\r\nto notice the observations which the _London Times_ made at that day.\r\nThat journal said, March 31, 1838:\r\n\r\n\"There is really no mistake in this long-talked of project of\r\nnavigating the Atlantic ocean by steam. There is no doubt of the\r\nintention to make the attempt, and to give the experiment, as such, a\r\nfair trial. The Sirius is actually getting under way for America.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1839, the British Government entered into a\r\ncontract with Samuel Cunard of Halifax for a semi-monthly mail line\r\nbetween Liverpool, and Halifax, and Boston, at the sum of L60,000 or\r\n$300,000 per annum. That contract inaugurated a new era in our\r\nAmerican commerce with the old world, and gave an impulse to those\r\ninternational interests and those commercial amities which have bound\r\nGreat Britain and the United States in the bonds of enduring\r\nfriendship and mutual, neighborly dependence. Boston soon proved\r\ninadequate to the support of the entire line, and half of the steamers\r\nwere sent to New-York; and thus they continue to run to this day. It\r\nis a singular fact that since that contract was made, eighteen years\r\nago, there has never been one transatlantic steamer except those of\r\nMr. Cunard running to or from that port. This contract was renewed\r\nwith Mr. Cunard in 1850, when weekly trips were required for the\r\ngreater portion of the year, and the subsidy was advanced, not in the\r\nratio of the service, which was only doubled, but as three to one,\r\nfrom L60,000 to L173,340, or from $300,000 to $866,700. The experience\r\nof twelve years had demonstrated both the necessity of continuing the\r\nline, and of increasing the subsidy which the Government paid, to such\r\na sum as would secure good steamers, regularity of trips, and\r\nefficiency of service. The Company now has nine steamers, with 18,406\r\ntons aggregate tonnage, and 6,418 horses' power. The contract, which\r\nis to continue for twelve years, until 1862, was so altered in 1852 as\r\nto provide for a weekly service as well in winter as in summer; and it\r\nwill continue in force from 1862 until twelve months after notice may\r\nbe given for the discontinuance of the line. The compensation for the\r\nsame is at the rate of 11_s_ 4-1/2_d_ per mile. Lord Canning's Report\r\nto Parliament in 1853, before noticed, in particularizing on this\r\nline, said:\r\n\r\n\"An additional allowance, _within certain limits_, is to be made to\r\nthe contractors in the event of an increase in the rate of insurance\r\non steam vessels, or in the freight or insurance of coals, as compared\r\nwith the rates payable at the date of the contract, if proved to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\"\r\n\r\nThus, instead of abandoning this line after an experiment of twelve\r\nyears, and finding that it could never be self-supporting, the British\r\nGovernment wisely determined to let their policy produce its full\r\nfruits, and continued it for another similar term of years, with three\r\ntimes the former subsidy, for only twice the old service. (_See\r\nCollins and Cunard Lines, Sec. X._)\r\n\r\nA contract was made in 1840 for steam to Malta, Corfu, and Alexandria,\r\nand the service was extended in 1845 to Suez, Bombay, Ceylon,\r\nCalcutta, Hong Kong, and Shanghae. It was renewed again in 1853,\r\nterminable in 1862, or after twelve months' notice, with a service\r\nbetween Sydney and Singapore, with the \"Peninsular and Oriental\r\nCompany;\" and the subsidy for the whole service was increased from\r\nL199,600 or $998,000 per annum, to $1,224,000 per annum. The Company\r\nhave thirty-nine vessels of 48,835 tons, and 12,850 horses' power, and\r\nrun 796,637 annually, at 6_s_ 1-3/4_d_ per mile. The steamers run the\r\nwhole service of 796,637 miles annually, at this low rate because much\r\nof the service is confined to the Mediterranean, as for example, their\r\nline from Southampton to Vigo, O Porto, Lisbon, Cadiz, and Gibraltar;\r\nand also that between Marseilles and Malta. This is but like the\r\ncoasting trade at the utmost, and is not ocean navigation proper.\r\nBefore the contract was renewed the same company got for the service\r\nbetween Hong Kong and Ceylon, 12_s_ 7_d_ per mile, and for that\r\nbetween Suez and Calcutta, L1, 0_s_ 1-1/2_d_ per mile.\r\n\r\nThe contract with the \"West-India Royal Mail Packet Company\" was made\r\nin 1840 for a semi-monthly service to the West-Indies, Central\r\nAmerica, and Mexico, at L240,000, and for 547,296 nautical miles per\r\nannum. The contract was renewed on the same terms in 1846, and again\r\nin 1850, when the Brazil service was added, and the subsidy increased\r\nto L270,000 or $1,350,000 per annum, for twelve years, or until 1862,\r\nand one year after notice shall have been given. The length of the\r\nroutes now run by the Company is 37,000 nautical miles, with\r\nthirty-four stopping places. The West-India service of 393,432 miles,\r\nis performed at the rate of 10_s_ 10-1/2_d_ per mile, under special\r\ncontract; no advertisement ever having been made for tenders. The\r\nBrazilian portion of the service embraces 153,864 miles annually. Pay\r\nper mile for the whole Royal Mail service is 9_s_ 10_d_ per mile. This\r\nCompany has twenty steamers, of 29,454 tons, and 9,308 horses' power.\r\nOn the Brazil portion of the service the touches are at Lisbon,\r\nMadeira, Teneriffe, St. Vincent, Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janiero,\r\nMonte Video, and Buenos Ayres. On the West-India division, St. Thomas\r\nis the central depot, after touching at the Azores. Ten branch lines\r\nradiate from St. Thomas to Antigua, Barbados, Blewfields, Carriacou,\r\nCarthagena, Aspinwall, (which they call Colon,) Demarara, Dominica,\r\nGrenada, Greytown, Gaudaloupe, Havanna, Honduras, Jacmel, Jamaica,\r\nMartinique, Porto Rico, St. Kitt's, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Santa\r\nMartha, Tampico, Tobago, Trinidad, and Vera Cruz. Lord Canning says:\r\n\r\n\"It is stipulated that if at any time, from causes recognized by the\r\nLords of the Treasury as being of a 'distinctly public and national\r\ncharacter,' the insurance on steam vessels shall rise above 6_l_ 6_s_\r\nper cent., the freight of coals above 1_l_ 2_s_ 6_d_ per ton, and the\r\ninsurance on coals above 2_l_ 2_s_ per cent., the Company shall\r\nreceive an additional sum, to be settled by arbitration, but not to\r\nexceed 75,000_l_ a year in the whole.\"\r\n\r\nThe special contract for the West Coast of South-America, with the\r\n\"Pacific Steam Navigation Company,\" for three round trips per month\r\nbetween Panama and Valparaiso, touching at Buenaventura, Guayaquil,\r\nPayta, Lambayeque, Huanchaco, Santa, Pisco, Islay, Arica, Iquique,\r\nCobija, Copiapo, Huasco, and Coquimbo, was made in 1845, at L20,000,\r\nor $100,000 per annum, for five years. It was renewed in 1850 for ten\r\nyears; and hence, expires in 1860, if notice may be given to that\r\neffect; the trips being only semi-monthly, and the subsidy increased\r\nto L25,000 per annum. The Company has seven steamers, of 5,719 tons,\r\nand 2,396 horses' power. (_See List of British Mail Lines, Paper B,\r\npage 193._)\r\n\r\nThe contract for running fast packets between Holyhead and Kingston,\r\nin Ireland, was made in 1848 with the \"City of Dublin Steam Packet\r\nCompany,\" for L25,000 per annum, and is terminable at twelve months'\r\nnotice after 1860. The line is run twice every day. The service to the\r\nChannel islands, from Southampton to Jersey and Guernsey, was\r\nestablished in 1848, at L4,000 per annum, for three trips per week.\r\nThat of the West Coast of Africa was established in 1852, at L21,250\r\nper annum. Leaving Plymouth, the steamers touch at Madeira, Teneriffe,\r\nGoree, Bathurst, Sierra Leone, Monrovia, Cape Coast Castle, Accra,\r\nWhydah, Badagry, Lagos, Bonny, Old Calabar, Cameroon, and Fernando Po.\r\nThis contract was made with the \"African Steamship Company,\" for a\r\nmonthly service, and terminates in 1862 if twelve months' notice be\r\ngiven. There must be three steamers of 700 tons each, and the pay is,\r\nfor 149,880 miles annually, at 2_s_ 6_d_ per mile. The contract with\r\nthe \"General Screw Steamshipping Company,\" for service semi-monthly\r\nfrom Plymouth to the Cape of Good Hope and Calcutta, touching on the\r\nreturn voyage at St. Vincent, Ascension, Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius,\r\nPoint de Galle, Madras, and St. Helena, for L50,000 per year, to be\r\nreduced after two years to L40,000 annually, and that to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and Port Natal, touching at Mossel and Algoa bays, Buffalo,\r\nand Port Francis, for L3,000 per annum, with the same Company, were\r\nboth made in 1852; but the service was found impracticable on the\r\nterms, and was abandoned. That from Plymouth every two months to\r\nSydney and New South Wales, with the \"Australian Royal Mail Steam\r\nNavigation Co.,\" for L26,000 per annum, and touching at St. Vincent,\r\nSimon's Bay, or Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope, King George Sound, Port\r\nPhilip, and St. Helena, was made also in 1852; but was likewise soon\r\nabandoned, as the subsidy in each case was too small.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Chancellor of the Exchequer requested a thorough\r\ninvestigation into the foreign steam packet system. This was made in\r\nthe most searching manner in 1853; and such was the effect that it was\r\ndetermined not only to sustain all of the existing lines in all of\r\ntheir integrity, but to extend the system and afford additional\r\nfacilities to British commerce and the British people. Accordingly, a\r\nnew contract was made last year, 1856, with the \"European and\r\nAustralian Mail Steam Packet Company\" for a monthly service between\r\nSouthampton, Marseilles, Malta, Alexandria, Suez, and Sydney, at an\r\nannual subsidy of L185,000, or $925,000. The Company has seven\r\nsteamers of 13,410 tons, and 3,290 horses' power. They run 336,000\r\nmiles per annum, and receive 11_s_ per mile from the Government. It\r\nmust be borne in mind, too, that when this line was established there\r\nwere already two lines to the East-Indies and China, and one to\r\nAustralia. This makes two to Australia, and three to the East\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nThere is also a contract, made in 1850 with Mr. Cunard, for running\r\nmonthly between Halifax and Newfoundland, and Halifax, Bermuda, and\r\nNew-York, as well as between New-York and Bermuda and St. Thomas.\r\nNew-York was soon dropped from the list, doubtless because the British\r\nsteamers yielded us more advantage than was gained by the mother\r\ncountry or the Provinces, and the line is now continued, at the\r\noriginal compensation, L14,700, or $73,500, between Halifax and\r\nNewfoundland, and Halifax, Bermuda, and St. Thomas, connecting with\r\nthe Cunard steamers. The steamers are small coasters, and run at the\r\nrate of 3_s_ per mile. Hence, they make 98,000 miles per annum.\r\n\r\nThe ocean mail steamers of Great Britain run 2,532,231 miles per year,\r\nat a total cost to the Admiralty of L1,062,797, or $5,333,985. The\r\nocean mail steamers of the United States run 735,732 miles per year,\r\nat a total charge on the Post Office Department of $1,329,733. The\r\nBritish steamers run three and a half times as many miles as ours do,\r\nand receive for it a sum more than four times as large. The average\r\nprice paid to their principal companies, as the West-India Royal Mail,\r\nthe Cunard, the Australian, and the Peninsular and Oriental, including\r\nits Mediterranean coasting service, is 9_s_ 7_d_, or $2.39 per mile;\r\nwhile the average price paid by us, or for the Collins, Havre, Bremen,\r\nAspinwall, and Panama, San Francisco and Oregon, is $1.80-3/4 per\r\nmile. The highest sum paid per mile by the British Government is 11_s_\r\n4-1/4_d_, or $2.83-1/2, to the Cunard Company, $2.75 to the\r\nAustralian, and $2.46 to the West-India; and the lowest, 6_s_\r\n1-3/4_d_, or $1.53-1/2 to the Peninsular and Oriental, much of whose\r\nservice is coasting. This is saying nothing of the Pacific and the\r\nAfrican coasting lines. The highest sum which we pay is to the Collins\r\nline, $3.10-1/2 per mile; and the lowest to the Havre, $1.00-1/2 per\r\nmile; while the sums paid to all of the other companies range but\r\nlittle above the last figures. The lowest rate per mile paid to any of\r\nthe lines under the contract, was to the Pacific Mail, $1.70. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that the low rates per mile of the Havre and Bremen\r\nresult from those lines taking the postages, since their contracts\r\nexpired; a sum by no means adjusted to the service done. They had\r\nships that they could not let lie idle. Under their regular contracts\r\nthe pay per mile of the Bremen line was $2.08, and of the Havre\r\n$1.76-1/2. While the British Government pays to four of her principal\r\ntransmarine services an average of $2.39 per mile, we pay to five of\r\nours an average of $1.80-3/4 only, or but about two thirds as much as\r\nshe does. While our total annual expenditure for foreign mails is\r\n$1,329,733, a sum by $20,267 less than that paid to the single service\r\nof the West-India Royal Mail Company, that of Great Britain is\r\n$5,333,985. And, while our total income from transmarine postages is\r\n$1,035,740, a sum but little short of that paid in subsidy, taking the\r\npresent Bremen and Havre services at the estimates of last year for\r\nsea and inland postages combined, the income from the whole\r\ntransmarine service of Great Britain, including ocean and inland\r\npostage, was, when the last report was made in 1853, L591,573, or\r\n$2,957,865; but little above half the sum paid in subsidy, and\r\nincluding the French, Belgian, and Dutch routes, where the postal\r\nyield was much greater than from the ocean lines. The estimates which\r\nI present below have been made with great care from distances and\r\nsubsidies furnished me by the reliable First Assistant Post Master\r\nGeneral, Hon. Horatio King, from the last report of the late Post\r\nMaster General, and from the report of the British Post Master\r\nGeneral, Lord Canning, before noticed.

Average of four principal lines, $2.39.\r\n\r\n[F] The Peninsular and Oriental Company run twice per month between\r\nSouthampton and Alexandria, and between Suez and Calcutta and Hong\r\nKong; twice per month between Marseilles and Malta; between Singapore\r\nand Sydney every two months; and three times per month between\r\nSouthampton and Gibraltar, touching at Vigo, O Porto, Lisbon, and\r\nCadiz.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be expected that the lines of this country should run\r\nat cheaper rates than those of Great Britain, as the prime cost of\r\nships and their repairs, fuel, wages, insurance, etc., are much\r\ncheaper there, and as they have more paying freights, in their\r\nmanufactured goods. It only explains to us, what has alway seemed a\r\nmystery; that while the regular companies in England were making\r\nmoney, nearly all of those in the United States not only had not made\r\nmoney, but were embarrassed more or less, and were selling their\r\nstocks at sixty to eighty cents on the dollar.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing and instructive to examine the steam mail service of\r\nGreat Britain, and see the gradual, unfaltering progress that she has\r\nmade from year to year, since 1833; increasing the mail facilities and\r\nthe sums paid for them by constant accretion based on system, rather\r\nthan by any spasmodic legislation, or the ruling caprices of the\r\nmoment. These improvements have not come all in a mass, or in any one\r\nyear. Neither have they been abandoned at times of financial\r\nembarrassment, or commercial depression. At such periods they have\r\nbeen as regularly fostered as in the times of the most flush\r\nprosperity; and have ever been properly considered one of the prime\r\nagents and necessities for restoring commerce to its normal condition\r\nand a safe equilibrium. The transmarine service, which cost but\r\nL583,793, or $2,918,965, per annum until 1850,[G] now costs\r\nL1,062,797, or $5,333,985; within a fraction of double the sum. While\r\nthe increase has not been slow, it has been steady and systematic,\r\njust as it was necessary to meet the wants of British commerce\r\nthroughout the world. The language of the Hon. Senator Rusk on this\r\nsubject, in his Report made to the Senate, Sep. 18th, 1850, found in\r\nSenate Ex. Doc. No. 50, 1st Session of 32d Congress, in Special Rep.\r\nSecretary of the Navy, 1852, is forcible and worthy of remembrance. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n[G] See Second Report, Steam Communication with India, 1851. Appendix,\r\npage 419.\r\n\r\n    \"The importance of the steam mail service, when considered with\r\n    reference to the convenience which it affords to the social\r\n    intercourse of the country, is as nothing when compared with its\r\n    vast bearing upon the commerce of the world. Wherever facilities\r\n    of rapid travel exist, trade will be found with its attendant\r\n    wealth. Of the truth of this proposition, no country, perhaps,\r\n    affords a more forcible illustration than Great Britain, as none\r\n    has ever availed itself, to so great an extent, of the benefits of\r\n    easy and rapid intercommunication between the various portions of\r\n    her almost boundless empire. The commercial history of England has\r\n    shown that mail facilities have uniformly gone hand in hand with\r\n    the extension of trade; and wherever British subjects are found\r\n    forming communities, there do we find the hand of the government\r\n    busy in supplying the means of easy and safe communication with\r\n    the mother country. With a view to this, we have beheld England\r\n    increasing her steam marine at an enormous expense, and sustaining\r\n    packet lines connecting with every quarter of the globe, even in\r\n    cases where any _immediate_ and _direct_ remuneration was out of\r\n    the question. The great object in view was, to draw together the\r\n    portions of an empire upon which the sun never sets, and the\r\n    martial airs of which encircle the globe, and to make British\r\n    subjects who dwell in Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and even\r\n    Oceanica, all feel alike that they are Britons.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Thomas Butler King, formerly Chairman of the Naval Committee,\r\nin a speech in the House, 19th July, 1848, said on this subject:\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1840 a contract was made by the Admiralty with the\r\n    Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, at two hundred and forty thousand\r\n    pounds sterling, or one million two hundred thousand dollars per\r\n    annum, for fourteen steamers to carry the mails from Southampton\r\n    to the West-Indies, the ports of Mexico in the Gulf, and to\r\n    New-Orleans, Mobile, Savannah, and Charleston. These ships are of\r\n    the largest class, and are to conform in all respects, concerning\r\n    size and adaptation to the purposes of war, to the conditions\r\n    prescribed in the Cunard contracts. They are to make twenty-four\r\n    voyages or forty-eight trips a year, leaving and returning to\r\n    Southampton semi-monthly.\r\n\r\n    \"Another contract has recently been entered into, as I am\r\n    informed, for two ships to run between Bermuda and New-York. The\r\n    West-India line, in consequence of some disasters during the first\r\n    years of its service, was relieved from touching at the ports of\r\n    the United States; but in the spring of last year it was required\r\n    to resume its communication with New-Orleans, and is at any time\r\n    liable to be required to touch at the other ports on our coast\r\n    which I have named. Thus it will be perceived that this system of\r\n    mail steam-packet service is so arranged as not only to\r\n    communicate with Canada and the West-Indies, the ports on the\r\n    Spanish Main and the Gulf coast of Mexico, but also to touch at\r\n    every important port in the United States, from Boston to\r\n    New-Orleans.\r\n\r\n    \"These three lines employ twenty-five steamers of the largest and\r\n    most efficient description, where familiarity with our seaports\r\n    and the whole extent of our coast would render them the most\r\n    formidable enemies in time of war. It is scarcely possible to\r\n    imagine a system more skillfully devised to bring down upon us, at\r\n    any given point, and at any unexpected moment, the whole force of\r\n    British power. More especially is this true with respect to our\r\n    _southern_ coast, where the great number of accessible and\r\n    unprotected harbors, both on the Atlantic and the Gulf, would\r\n    render such incursions comparatively safe to them, and terrible to\r\n    us. And when we reflect that the design of this system is, that it\r\n    shall draw the means of its support from our own commerce and\r\n    intercourse, we should surely have been wanting in the duty we\r\n    owed to ourselves and to our country, if we had failed to adopt\r\n    measures towards the establishment of such an American system of\r\n    Atlantic steam navigation as would compete successfully with it.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to the renewal of the several foreign mail contracts, in\r\n1850, the Treasury ordered, 26th April, 1849, the formation of a\r\nCommittee in these words: \"_Ordered_, that a Select Committee be\r\nappointed to inquire into the CONTRACT PACKET SERVICE.\" That Committee\r\nwas composed of Sir James Hogg, Mr. Cardwell, Sir Wm. Clay, Mr.\r\nCowper, Mr. Alderman Thompson, Mr. Fitz Roy, Mr. Hastie, Mr. Mangles,\r\nMr. Thomas Baring, Mr. Bankes, Mr. William Brown, Mr. Childers, Mr.\r\nWilcox, Mr. Crogan, and Mr. Henley. Mr. Elliot was added in the place\r\nof Mr. Baring. The Committee sat seventeen days, and examined fifteen\r\nwitnesses under oath, many of these being commanders in the Navy,\r\nSecretaries, Presidents, and engineers of the Companies, and other\r\neminent men in steam. Mr. Cunard was among the witnesses. After taking\r\nevidence and papers extending over about seven hundred and\r\neighty-three octavo pages, they said in their report, after\r\nrecommending that great care should be exercised in making all future\r\ncontracts:\r\n\r\n\"1. That so far as the Committee are able to judge, from the evidence\r\nthey have taken, it appears that the mails are conveyed at a less cost\r\nby Hired Packets than by Her Majesty's Vessels.\r\n\r\n\"2. That some of the existing Contracts have been put up to public\r\ntender, and some arranged by private negotiation; and that a very\r\nlarge sum beyond what is received from postage is paid on some of the\r\nlines; but considering that at the time these contracts were arranged\r\nthe success of these large undertakings was uncertain, Your Committee\r\nsee no reason to think that better terms could have been obtained for\r\nthe public.\"\r\n\r\nThis investigation was made to enable the Government to proceed\r\nintelligently with the many contracts which were to expire in 1850;\r\nand its immediate consequence was, not only the renewal of all the old\r\ncontracts with the same parties at the same or larger pay, but the\r\nestablishment of several new services.\r\n\r\nThe British system had operated to the very highest satisfaction of\r\nthe public and the Government for twenty years, until 1853, as it has\r\ndone ever since; but at that time it was put to a second and very\r\nsevere test. It had been suggested, probably by the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, who had to pay the bills from the Naval fund, that the\r\npacket system was too costly, and should be remodelled, and perhaps\r\nreduced. Complaint was thus made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nwho, in a Treasury Minute, dated March 1, 1853, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Important as it is to secure rapid and certain communication with\r\n    the remote dependencies of this country, and with other distant\r\n    states, for national purposes, it is doubtless, under all common\r\n    circumstances, from commercial considerations that such facility\r\n    of correspondence derives its highest value.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Her Majesty's Government conceive the time to have arrived when\r\n    the entire charge of the packet service should be deliberately\r\n    examined and reviewed, with joint reference to the questions--how\r\n    far the purposes with which the present system was begun have been\r\n    accomplished--how far the total amount of service rendered to the\r\n    State is adequate to the total annual expense--how far there may\r\n    be cause for a more than commonly jealous and scrupulous\r\n    consideration of such further schemes of extension of the system\r\n    as particular interests or parties may press, or even such as\r\n    public objects may recommend from time to time; lastly, how far,\r\n    on account of the early period at which certain of the contracts\r\n    are terminable, or on account of requisitions put in by the\r\n    contractors themselves for the modification of the terms, or for\r\n    any other reason, it may be prudent to entertain the question of\r\n    any revision of those terms, or of laying down any prospective\r\n    rules with regard to them; such only, of course, as may comport\r\n    with the equitable as well as the legal rights of the parties, and\r\n    may avoid any disappointment to the just expectations of those\r\n    classes who may have felt a peculiar interest in the establishment\r\n    and extension of these great lines of communication.\"\r\n\r\nAfter remarking that some of the vessels of some few Companies were\r\nunfit for purposes of war, the \"Minute of the Treasury,\" in\r\ninstructing the Committee, further says:\r\n\r\n    \"At the same time, it is not to be conceived that, on account of\r\n    this failure in a portion of the design, the country has cause to\r\n    regret having paid a larger price than was intended to be paid\r\n    simply for the establishment of these noble chains of\r\n    communication, which well nigh embrace the world. The organization\r\n    of a complete postal system upon the ocean, with absolute fixity\r\n    of departures, and a general approach to certainty in arrivals,\r\n    was a great problem, of high interest and benefit, not to England\r\n    only, but to all civilized countries; and this problem may now be\r\n    said to have been solved by England, for the advantage of mankind\r\n    at large. It was to all appearance altogether beyond the reach of\r\n    merely commercial enterprise; and if the price paid has been high,\r\n    the object has been worthy, and the success for all essential\r\n    purposes complete.\"\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this \"Minute,\" the Lords Commissioners of Her\r\nMajesty's Treasury appointed a Committee, consisting of Viscount\r\nCanning, Post Master General of Great Britain, as President; Hon. Wm.\r\nCowper, on behalf of the Board of Admiralty; Sir Stafford H.\r\nNorthcote, Bart.; and Mr. R. Madox Bromley, Secretary to the Board of\r\nAudit. The Committee organized, examined the Evidence and Report of\r\nthe Committee of 1849, also the three large volumes of Evidence and\r\nReport taken by the Committee in 1851 on \"Steam Communication with\r\nIndia and Australia,\" and the many elaborate documents of this class\r\npublished by the Admiralty. After discussing thoroughly all of the\r\npolitical, financial, commercial, ethical, and social questions\r\nconnected with rapid steam mail communication, they made an elaborate\r\nand detailed examination of all the contracts existing with the\r\nGovernment, and of the affairs of the various companies, with a view\r\nto deciding whether the ocean mail service should be abridged, or\r\ncontinued, or extended. They reported to both Houses of Parliament,\r\nJuly 8th, 1853. The conclusion of the Committee was, not only that the\r\npresent service was demanded by every interest of the country and\r\nshould be sustained, but that it should be judiciously extended, so as\r\nto meet all of the wants of the British public of whatever class. As\r\nelsewhere remarked, the new line established last year to Australia\r\nand India, at a cost of $925,000 per annum, for seven years, was a\r\nlegitimate result of that test and that report, made in the most\r\nsearching manner by the very ablest men of the kingdom; and this,\r\nnotwithstanding the reports purposely circulated in this country every\r\nfew years that Great Britain intends abandoning her steam mail system.\r\nShe will abandon that system, as her practice plainly indicates, only\r\nwhen her people shall have discovered some means of making and\r\npreserving wealth without effort, enterprise, commerce, or\r\nmanufactures. (_See page 99, Mr. Atherton's Reply._) The Report says:\r\n\r\n    \"Before the application of steam to the propulsion of ships, the\r\n    contracts were often made for short periods, the Government being\r\n    able to find, among the vessels already employed in trade, some of\r\n    speed sufficient for the purpose; but when it became requisite to\r\n    dispatch the mails by steam, the ordinary supply of trading\r\n    vessels would no longer suffice, and the Government had to call\r\n    into existence a new class of packets.\r\n\r\n    \"The postal service between England and the adjacent shores of\r\n    Ireland, France, and Belgium, was at first performed by steam\r\n    packets belonging to the Crown; but for the longer voyages it was\r\n    thought better to induce commercial companies to build steamers;\r\n    and with that view the contracts were at first made for periods\r\n    which, unless previously terminated by failure to fulfill their\r\n    engagements, would secure to the company the full benefit of their\r\n    original outlay, by continuing the employment of their vessels\r\n    until they might be expected to require extensive repairs, or to\r\n    become unfit for continued service. In 1837 steam communication\r\n    was created with Portugal and Gibraltar; in 1840 with Egypt, with\r\n    the West-Indies, and with North-America.\r\n\r\n    \"When the public interest requires the establishment of a postal\r\n    line on which the ordinary traffic would not be remunerative for\r\n    steamers, the subsidy to be allowed in the contract may be\r\n    ascertained either by the test of public competition, or by\r\n    calculating the amount which, on an estimate of the probable\r\n    receipts and expenditure, will cover the deficiency of receipts,\r\n    or by comparing it with the cost of war vessels if employed for\r\n    the same purpose.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The objects which appear to have led to the formation of these\r\n    contracts, and to the large expenditure involved, were--to afford\r\n    a rapid, frequent, and punctual communication with those distant\r\n    ports which feed the main arteries of British commerce, and with\r\n    the most important of our foreign possessions; to foster maritime\r\n    enterprise; and to encourage the production of a superior class of\r\n    vessels which would promote the convenience and wealth of the\r\n    country in time of peace, and assist in defending its shores\r\n    against hostile aggression.\r\n\r\n    \"These expectations have not been disappointed. The ocean has been\r\n    traversed with a precision and regularity hitherto deemed\r\n    impossible--commerce and civilization have been extended--the\r\n    colonies have been brought more closely into connection with the\r\n    Home Government--and steamships have been constructed of a size\r\n    and power that, without Government aid, could hardly, at least for\r\n    many years, have been produced.\r\n\r\n    \"It is not easy to estimate the pecuniary value of these results,\r\n    but there is no reason to suppose that they could have been\r\n    attained at that time at less cost.\"\r\n\r\nAfter noticing the objects of the postal contracts, the Report says,\r\nin speaking of their results:\r\n\r\n    \"To show what the system is capable of accomplishing, it will be\r\n    sufficient that we should call attention to the two great lines of\r\n    communication which have been opened, the one between this country\r\n    and India, the other between this country and America. The mails\r\n    are dispatched twice a month in the one case, and once a week in\r\n    the other, and are conveyed to their destination with a regularity\r\n    and rapidity which leaves nothing to be desired. The time occupied\r\n    in the voyage to and fro between England and Bombay, which, before\r\n    the establishment of the Overland Route, averaged about 224 days,\r\n    is now no more than 87 days; and the time occupied in the voyage\r\n    to and fro between England and the United States, which before\r\n    1840 varied from 45 to 105 days, is now reduced to an average\r\n    period of 24 days. Nor is the service simply rapid, it is also\r\n    regular; and the mercantile community can reckon with the utmost\r\n    certainty on the punctual departure of the mails at the appointed\r\n    times, and can also calculate with great precision the times of\r\n    their arrival.\r\n\r\n    \"The same results have not been so conspicuous on some other\r\n    postal lines; but, taking the service as a whole, it has\r\n    undoubtedly been brought to a high state of excellence, and its\r\n    value to the country, both politically and commercially, is very\r\n    considerable.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking further of the objects of the Government postal service,\r\nafter inquiring whether the foreign mail service should be extended\r\nany further, it says:\r\n\r\n    \"The object of the Government in undertaking the transmarine\r\n    postal service, whether by packets or by the system of ship\r\n    letters, is to provide frequent, rapid, and regular communication\r\n    between this country and other states, and between different parts\r\n    of the British Empire. The reasons for desiring such communication\r\n    are partly commercial and partly political. In cases where the\r\n    interests concerned are chiefly those of commerce, it is generally\r\n    more important that the postal service should be regular, than\r\n    that it should be extremely rapid, though of course rapidity of\r\n    communication, where it can be obtained without sacrificing other\r\n    objects, is of great advantage. It would clearly be the interest\r\n    of persons engaged in an important trade, provided there were no\r\n    legal impediment in the way, to establish a regular postal\r\n    communication in connection with it, even without aid from the\r\n    state. This, however, would not extend to many cases in which\r\n    there are political reasons for maintaining such services, while\r\n    the commercial interests involved are of less magnitude. _Nor is\r\n    it probable that private communications would be nearly so rapid\r\n    as those directed by the Government; for a high rate of speed can\r\n    only be obtained at a great expense, which will generally be found\r\n    to be disproportionate to the benefits directly received from it,\r\n    unless under peculiar circumstances of passenger traffic._ Lastly,\r\n    it is to be considered that there are several services which, if\r\n    they were not carried on by the British Government, would probably\r\n    be undertaken by the Governments of foreign states, and that it is\r\n    not likely that private individuals or associations would in such\r\n    cases enter into competition with them.\r\n\r\n    \"From these considerations we infer that, even upon the lines in\r\n    the maintenance of which the greatest commercial interests are\r\n    involved, private enterprise can not be depended upon for\r\n    providing a complete substitute for Government agency; while it is\r\n    clear that in others, where regular communications are desired\r\n    solely or chiefly for political purposes, such agency is\r\n    absolutely indispensable. _It is, however, obvious, that to\r\n    establish a Government system in some cases, and to leave others\r\n    wholly to private persons, would cause much inconvenience._ The\r\n    conclusion therefore follows, that it is right that the Government\r\n    should have the management of the whole of the transmarine postal\r\n    communication, as it also has that of the communication within the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    \"In undertaking this duty, the Government will in the first place\r\n    have regard to the national interests, whether political, social,\r\n    or commercial, involved in the establishment and maintenance of\r\n    each particular line. Care must, however, be taken, in cases where\r\n    the communication is desired chiefly for commercial purposes, to\r\n    guard against an undue expenditure of public money for the benefit\r\n    of private merchants. The extension of commerce is undoubtedly a\r\n    national advantage, and it is quite reasonable that Parliamentary\r\n    grants should occasionally be employed for the sake of affording\r\n    fresh openings for it, by establishing new lines of communication,\r\n    or introducing new methods of conveyance, the expense of which,\r\n    after the first outlay has been incurred, may be expected to be\r\n    borne by the parties availing themselves of the facilities offered\r\n    them. But this having once been done, and sufficient time having\r\n    been allowed for the experiment, the further continuance of the\r\n    service, unless required for political reasons of adequate\r\n    importance, should be made to depend upon the extent to which the\r\n    parties chiefly interested avail themselves of it, and upon its\r\n    tendency to become self-supporting.\"\r\n\r\nNoticing the greater or less sums at which private companies may be\r\ninduced to undertake short line postal service, and stating that the\r\nline is both benefited and injured by the necessity of punctual\r\nsailing hours, the Report states the reason why subsidies are\r\nrequired, thus:\r\n\r\n    \"The vessels now under contract with the Government are, however,\r\n    for the most part, required to maintain high rates of speed. The\r\n    contractors are also subject to a variety of conditions, designed\r\n    partly to secure the efficiency of the postal service, and partly\r\n    to render their vessels available for other national purposes\r\n    wholly unconnected with that service. In return, they are in the\r\n    receipt of subsidies largely in excess of the amount of revenue\r\n    derived from the mails they carry, and those subsidies are\r\n    guaranteed to them for terms of years varying from four to twelve,\r\n    most of which have at the present time not less than seven or\r\n    eight years to run. An Estimate printed in the Appendix, will show\r\n    that while the amount of the subsidies to foreign and colonial\r\n    lines, as contracted for in the past year, was no less than\r\n    L822,390, the sums received for postage upon these lines can not\r\n    be estimated at more than L443,782.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report further says, as to the mode by which postal communication\r\ncan be procured, \"where frequent and rapid communication already\r\nexists, it is only necessary for the Government to secure from time to\r\ntime the services of vessels already engaged in private traffic.\" But\r\nas there are no such cases in the transmarine routes, and as private\r\nenterprise supplies the demand of steam lines only on the short\r\nroutes, like the inter-island service of Great Britain, or that to the\r\nContinent, or the service of the Sound, the North River, short coast\r\nroutes, etc., in the United States, the Report goes on to say:\r\n\r\n    \"There still remain, however, some cases in which there exists no\r\n    private communication sufficient to render such a mode of\r\n    proceeding practicable. Where this is so, and where a\r\n    communication has to be created, it will be necessary that\r\n    contracts of longer duration should be made, _for it is\r\n    unreasonable to expect that any person or association of persons\r\n    should incur the expense and risk of building vessels, forming\r\n    costly establishments, and opening a new line of communication at\r\n    a heavy outlay of capital, without some security that they will be\r\n    allowed to continue the service long enough to reap some benefit\r\n    from their undertaking. It must be borne in mind, that the\r\n    expensive vessels built for the conveyance of the mails at a high\r\n    rate of speed are not in demand for the purposes of ordinary\r\n    traffic, and can not therefore be withdrawn and applied to another\r\n    service at short notice_. It is, then, fair, that on the first\r\n    opening of a new line, contracts should be made for such a length\r\n    of time as may encourage the building of ships for the purpose, by\r\n    affording a prospect of their employment for a considerable number\r\n    of years. But we see no sufficient reason for continually renewing\r\n    such contracts for periods equally long, after the object has once\r\n    been attained.\"\r\n\r\n(_For the views of the Committee on the adaptation of the mail packets\r\nto naval service, see pages 146 and 147._)\r\n\r\nThe Committee in summing up, presents the result of the investigation\r\nand the fruits of the service in the following impressive light:\r\n\r\n    \"The value of the services thus rendered to the State can not, we\r\n    think, be measured by a mere reference to the amount of the postal\r\n    revenue, or even by the commercial advantages accruing from it. It\r\n    is undoubtedly startling, at first sight, to perceive that the\r\n    immediate pecuniary result of the Packet System is a loss to the\r\n    Revenue of about L325,000 a year; but, although this circumstance\r\n    shows the necessity for a careful revision of the service, and\r\n    although we believe that much may be done to make that service\r\n    self-supporting, we do not consider that the money thus expended\r\n    is to be regarded, even from a fiscal point of view, as a national\r\n    loss.\"\r\n\r\nIt has never been a favorite idea with British statesmen that the\r\npacket service should be self-sustaining; nor have they had any\r\nevidence to believe that steam companies could live on the postal\r\nreceipts. It is evident from the following that the packet system is\r\nsustained without any reference whatever to the postal income, and for\r\ncommercial, political, and social purposes alone; only using the\r\nincome so far as it goes as a part of the contributions by the people\r\nto the general treasury. It says:\r\n\r\n    \"Your Lordships have seen from our Report that in framing these\r\n    contracts various objects have entered into the consideration of\r\n    the Government, the cost of which ought not in our opinion to be\r\n    charged upon the revenues of the General Post Office. A simple\r\n    comparison of the receipts and expenditure upon some of the lines\r\n    is in itself sufficient to prove this. If the Post Office is to be\r\n    considered as a department producing revenue, it is not to be\r\n    supposed that a line of vessels which costs the State L240,000 a\r\n    year, and brings in no more than L56,002, (as is the case with the\r\n    West-Indian packets,) or one for which L25,000 is annually paid,\r\n    and which returns little more than one fifth of that sum, (as the\r\n    Pacific line,) can be maintained as a part of its machinery; and,\r\n    in fact, the contracts for many of the services have been made\r\n    without reference to any estimate or opinion on the part of the\r\n    Post Master General of their probable value as postal lines.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes abundantly evident from the Reports of Parliamentary\r\nCommittees, from the \"Acts of Parliament,\" and from the practice of\r\nthe Admiralty and Post Office Departments, as well as from the\r\nunvarying experiences of twenty-four years, that the steam mail packet\r\nsystem of Great Britain was primarily adopted, and ever since\r\nsustained as the choicest means of giving to that nation the\r\nirresistible control of the world. Watching this system from the germ\r\nto its present maturity, we have seen the overshadowing tree reach\r\nhigher and higher, and the circle of each year's growth expand more\r\nand more, until the outer ring now embraces the whole civilized and\r\nsavage world. An additional evidence of this arrives this very day.\r\nThe Atlantic brings intelligence (_New-York papers, Nov. 22d_) that\r\nGreat Britain has just completed another mail contract, by which the\r\nPeninsular and Oriental Company are to run a third semi-monthly\r\nservice to India and China; so that the Government and people of Great\r\nBritain shall have a weekly communication with those regions, while we\r\nhave none except through them, although we are many thousand miles\r\nnearer to those countries.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that we should not attempt to run the postal and\r\ncommercial race with Great Britain. Why not? Because she has many\r\ncolonies, and must needs keep up communication with them. And why have\r\nsteam instead of sail to them? Because steam is the means of more\r\nreadily _controlling_ them. Grant it; and for the very same reason we\r\nwish steam with all the world; not that we may control the world, for\r\nthis is costly and unremunerative, as Great Britain finds; but to\r\nconform it, and especially to _control_ its commerce. Great Britain\r\nhas possessions in the West-Indies; but they are of the most\r\ninsignificant importance when compared with the trade of the many\r\nislands and countries near them, which she does not possess, and with\r\nthe Central American, Californian, Mexican, Peruvian, Chilian,\r\nNew-Granadian, Venezuelan, and Spanish markets, which she controls and\r\nuses. So with India and the Mauritius. It is a matter of sore\r\nsatisfaction that she is compelled to govern them as a means of\r\nreaching their rich trade, which, however rich, is far less important\r\nthan that of China for which she so strives. So also with Canada. She\r\nwas told some years since that, if she wished to secede from the\r\nKingdom, because the Government would not assist in building a certain\r\nrailroad, she might go, and carry peace, also, with her. The\r\nGovernment would scout the idea of running the Cunard line to Canada\r\nalone, and would not touch even at Halifax, except that the ships are\r\ncompelled to go in sight of the place; as the \"great circle\" on which\r\nthey sail nearly cuts the city. Great Britain runs that line because\r\nher trade with the United States requires it. That trade is worth to\r\nher every year twenty of her Canadas, as that of the West-Indies is\r\nworth a dozen of all the possessions which she has there. As to\r\nrunning the race of commerce with her, it is simply a _sine qua non_,\r\non which there is no difference of opinion among Americans who love\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nTHE MAIL LINES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n    THE MAIL LINES OF THE UNITED STATES: THE HAVRE AND BREMEN, THE\r\n    PIONEERS: THE BREMEN SERVICE RECENTLY GIVEN TO MR. VANDERBILT:\r\n    BOTH LINES RUN ON THE GROSS RECEIPTS: THE CALIFORNIA LINES:\r\n    WONDROUS DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PACIFIC POSSESSIONS: THE PACIFIC MAIL\r\n    STEAMSHIP COMPANY: ITS HISTORY, SERVICES, LARGE MATERIEL, AND\r\n    USEFULNESS: THE UNITED STATES MAIL STEAMSHIP COMPANY: ITS RAMIFIED\r\n    AND LARGE EXTRA SERVICE: EFFECT UPON THE COMMERCE OF THE GULF: ITS\r\n    HEAVY LOSSES, AND NEW SHIPS: STEAMSHIP STOCKS GENERALLY AVOIDED:\r\n    CONSTANTLY FAR BELOW PAR: THE COLLINS LINE: A COMPARISON WITH THE\r\n    CUNARD: ITS SOURCES OF HEAVY OUTLAY, AND ITS ENTERPRISE: THE\r\n    AMERICAN MARINE DISASTERS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY HUMAN\r\n    FORESIGHT: THE VANDERBILT BREMEN LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to notice the various lines in detail, or in\r\nany wise become their apologist, eulogist, or prosecutor. As a general\r\nthing they have discharged their obligations to the Government and the\r\npeople in the most creditable manner; in a much better manner than\r\ncould have been expected of them, considering the novelty of such\r\nenterprises in this country and our total want of experience either in\r\nsteamship building or ocean steam navigation. It is a cause of great\r\ngratulation and satisfaction that springing into the great arena of\r\nthe mail and passenger strife at a single bound, our steamers at once\r\ntook the lead in the race, and have ever since distanced those of the\r\nwhole world in speed, comfort, general accommodations, and cheap\r\ntransit. This may be asserted as a rule without a single exception.\r\nThe Collins steamers and the steamer \"Vanderbilt\" have beaten the\r\nCunarders by nearly a day and a half on the average voyages; the Havre\r\nand Bremen steamers make just the same time as the Cunarders; and the\r\nCalifornia steamers of both lines have signally beaten those of all\r\nthe English lines in the West-Indies, the Mediterranean, and the\r\nPacific and Indian oceans. Indeed the triumphs of our steamers\r\ngenerally and specially have been so decided in every valuable point\r\nthat we have great reason to be proud of the attainments to which the\r\nlegislation of 1846 and '47 led. We have nothing to record to the\r\ncredit of our legislation since that period.\r\n\r\nThe Havre and Bremen services were the first established in the United\r\nStates; and as the pioneers in our mail steamshipping they have both\r\nproven themselves valuable to the country. The Bremen line went into\r\nthe hands of Mr. Vanderbilt during the present year, on the expiration\r\nof the old contract; the \"Ocean Steam Navigation Company\" being\r\nunwilling to attempt the performance of the service on the small mail\r\npay of the gross ocean and inland postages, even with their old ships.\r\nMr. Vanderbilt having three ships wholly out of employment, determined\r\nto try the service. How far it will prove remunerative we shall not be\r\nable to determine until the steamers shall have run through one or two\r\nwinters as well as summers.\r\n\r\nThe Havre service was continued in the old hands. Mr. Livingston had\r\ntwo fine new ships, which had been running but little over one year,\r\nand which, adapted specially to the mail, passenger, and transport\r\ntrade of France, could not easily be withdrawn from the business for\r\nwhich they were built; while it would have been quite impossible to\r\nfind for them employment in any other trade. He, consequently, made a\r\ntemporary arrangement with the Department for one year, agreeing to\r\ntransport the mails, as during the old contract, for the gross ocean\r\nand inland postages. With this small remuneration the Havre line gets\r\na smaller pay than any other running; but one dollar per mile. The\r\nCompany have deserved well of the Government for their untiring\r\nefforts to perform their contract; one of the greatest sacrifices\r\nbeing the necessity of building two costly new steamers just as their\r\ncontract was about to expire. They suffered most severely from\r\ndisaster. Both of their fine and fast steamers, the \"Franklin\" and the\r\n\"Humboldt,\" were lost; and they were compelled to supply their places\r\nby chartering at exorbitantly high prices, until they built the two\r\nexcellent vessels now running, the \"Arago\" and \"Fulton.\" These two\r\nsteamers run probably more cheaply than any ever built in any country;\r\notherwise, being as large as they are, about twenty-six hundred tons\r\neach, they could by no means live on the small mail pay now given\r\nthem. It may be that both these and the Vanderbilt Bremen steamers are\r\nlosing money; although the latter vessels are much smaller, and have\r\nthe advantage of an immense emigrant trade. I have no means of knowing\r\nthe position of affairs in either company.\r\n\r\nBut no loss to the Havre Company has ever been so great as that of its\r\nlate President, Mr. Mortimer Livingston. An honorable and just man in\r\nhis dealings, both with individuals and the Government, he eschewed\r\nevery attempt by which some sought to pervert and deprave the\r\nlegislation of the country, and presented all of his views in\r\nsteamshipping on high, honorable, and tenable grounds. He pursued the\r\nprofession in an enlarged spirit of enterprise, and was not unmindful\r\nof his duties to his country, while he endeavored to establish\r\nlegitimate trade and preserve a profitable private business which had\r\nbeen well founded long before the introduction of ocean steam. He was\r\na worthy and most honorable gentleman, and is a loss to the whole\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nProminent among the steamship enterprises of the country stand the two\r\nlines which connect the Atlantic and Gulf seaboard with our large and\r\nrich possessions in the Pacific, California, and Oregon. Established\r\nat a time when California was held by military government, and when\r\nOregon was a wild untamed wilderness, these lines became the means of\r\ndeveloping the richest portion of the American continent, and binding\r\nthe far distant western world in close connection with the old\r\nconfederacy, notwithstanding the mighty Cordilleras and Rocky\r\nMountains which rose like forbidding barriers between them. Important\r\nas these possessions were, naturally and geographically, they acquired\r\na new interest about the time that the Pacific and the Aspinwall\r\nSteamship Companies were established. The contracts which were made\r\nwith these companies would certainly have ruined them but for the\r\ndiscovery of gold in California. This opened a new and brilliant field\r\nof effort, and the opportunities offered by these companies soon\r\ndetermined tens of thousands of our hardy and enterprising countrymen\r\nto enter and develop it.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing in this connection to trace the almost mysterious\r\nprogress of our Pacific territory during the past eight years, and the\r\nagencies producing it. Among these agencies none have been so\r\neffectual as the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. That Company was\r\ncompelled to form an establishment of the most effective character\r\nfour to five thousand miles away from home, and as it was at the\r\ntime, thirteen thousand miles distant. The country was wholly new, so\r\nmuch so that it was, in most parts of the field which it had to\r\noccupy, extremely difficult to procure ordinary food for their\r\noperatives. Their ships had to make a voyage more than half of that\r\naround the world before they arrived at their point of service; and\r\nthey found themselves without a home when there. The steamer\r\n\"California,\" which left New-York on the 6th October, 1848, was the\r\nfirst to bear the American flag to the Pacific ocean, and the first to\r\nsalute with a new life the solitudes of that rich and untrodden\r\nterritory. She was soon followed by the \"Panama\" and \"Oregon,\" and in\r\ndue course of time by the \"Tennessee,\" the \"Golden Gate,\" the\r\n\"Columbia,\" the \"John L. Stephens,\" the \"Sonora,\" the \"Republic,\" the\r\n\"Northerner,\" the \"Fremont,\" the \"Tobago,\" the \"St. Louis,\" and the\r\n\"Golden Age.\" From a small beginning that Company now has the finest\r\nsteam fleet in the United States, although the difficulties in forming\r\nit were probably much greater than any of our other companies had to\r\ncontend with.\r\n\r\nThese steamers found nothing ready to receive them in the Pacific. The\r\nCompany was compelled to construct large workshops and foundries for\r\ntheir repair, and now have at Benicia a large and excellent\r\nestablishment where they can easily construct a marine engine. They\r\nhad also to build their own Dry Dock; for that of the Government at\r\nMare Island was not ready until 1854. Theirs has ever been most useful\r\nto the United States, as it furnished the only accommodations of that\r\nclass in the Pacific. They had also to make shore establishments at\r\nPanama, San Francisco, and Astoria, which, with coal depots, etc.,\r\nwere extremely costly, owing to materials having to be transported so\r\nfar, and labor at the time being so high. The price of labor in\r\nCalifornia at all times depends on the profits which can be made by\r\ndigging gold, and the prices paid for this species of labor have ever\r\nbeen enormous. Beyond this most unusual price of labor along the\r\nPacific seaboard, the coals which they have used, whether from the\r\nEastern States or from England, have been invariably shipped around\r\nCape Horn, and have never cost less than twenty dollars per ton. For a\r\nlarge portion of the time the Company had to pay thirty dollars per\r\nton for coal, and in one instance fifty dollars. Coal, like all other\r\nprovisions of the steamers, has generally been purchased from those\r\nwho sent it out on speculation, and took all the advantages of the\r\npeculiar market. Twelve dollars per ton is a low price for freight to\r\nCalifornia or Panama. In addition to this, the cost price of the coal,\r\nthe handling, the wastage, and the insurance, will amount to about\r\neight dollars per ton, making it never less than twenty dollars\r\ndelivered. I have frequently seen coals sell even in Rio de Janeiro,\r\nwhich is but about one third of the distance from us, at eighteen to\r\ntwenty-four dollars per ton. The nine steamers running consume about\r\n35,000 tons of coal annually. If the vessels transporting it be of\r\n1,000 tons each, it will employ something near thirty-five of these\r\nvessels at profitable rates, in this one item of their business alone.\r\nSuch expenditures are not necessary to any other steam company in the\r\nworld. The British lines in the Indian Ocean and the China Seas are\r\nsupplied with domestic coal which comes at very reasonable prices, and\r\nis shipped but a short distance.\r\n\r\nYet this Company performs this distant and difficult service with\r\ngreat regularity and at a low price. They have never lost a trip, a\r\nmail-bag, or a passenger by marine disaster during the eight years\r\nthat they have been running in the Pacific. This results from the fact\r\nof the Company having thirteen steamers. If all of the steamers now in\r\ncommission were sunk, they could supply their place from their reserve\r\nfleet and have no hiatus in their service. Such a spare fleet is an\r\nenormous expense; but it is positively indispensable to regular and\r\nhighly efficient service. It is singular that under these\r\ncircumstances they can perform the service at $1.70 cents per mile. It\r\nis a notorious fact that these steamers could not have supported\r\nthemselves in 1854-55 without the aid which they obtained from the\r\nGovernment for the services which they performed. They never have\r\ntransported much freight, as it would not bear the transhipment at\r\nPanama. The small quantity which they had was during the first years\r\nafter the discovery of gold, and then only. They have never at any\r\ntime brought any eastward. The Panama Railroad was a splendid\r\nconsummation of which the world had dreamed for years, and toward\r\nwhose completion this Company was highly instrumental. Yet it did not\r\nenable the steamers to transport freight, and it never will.\r\n\r\nThese steamers run the 3,300 miles between Panama and San Francisco by\r\na time-table. They arrive at either end within a very few hours of\r\nthirteen and a half days, including all of the stoppages, which are\r\nalso made at specified hours. Thus the average speed of the steamers\r\nis about 254 miles per day. They touch at Acapulco and Mazanilla, and\r\nsupply San Diego, Monterey, San Pedro, Santa Barbara, San Luis, and\r\nObispo, ports of California, from Panama by a branch line. This is an\r\nextra service, and is not taken into account in calculating the\r\nmileage paid the Company.\r\n\r\nThe steamers have carried probably 175,000 passengers to California,\r\nand have brought back about $200,000,000 in gold. They have also by\r\ntheir semi-monthly line from San Francisco to Oregon assisted in\r\npopulating that rich and beautiful agricultural district, and making\r\nit available for useful purposes as a part of the United States. They\r\nhave converted the wilderness of California into a smiling garden, and\r\nwill ere long produce the same effect on Oregon. With that coast\r\ncomparatively unprotected, and with the small standing army sustained\r\nin this country, they become very important as a ready means of\r\nconcentrating on the Pacific coast a large army in a few days. They\r\nalso afford a ready transit for the changing crews of our national\r\nvessels, which, when once around the Horn, may remain there several\r\nyears; having to change their crews only.\r\n\r\nThe large property of this Company in the Pacific can be made\r\navailable for no other purpose than that for which it was created. Any\r\ncompany to be thoroughly effective there, must create its own stock,\r\nand support works on the same general plan as those created by the\r\nBritish East-India Company. Their success in building up this large\r\nestablishment on the Pacific was simply an accident; and that accident\r\nthe discovery of gold. But for this the Company would have failed in\r\ntwo years, or gone back pleading to Congress for relief. But the gold\r\ncrisis saved it, and the enterprise was very remunerative for the\r\nfirst few years; but since 1853 the profits have been limited, while\r\nfor one or two years the Company have sustained actual loss. They\r\ncalculated too largely on the prospective business with California,\r\nand have too large a sum invested to make much for the future. And\r\nyet, with a smaller investment they could not perform the service,\r\nexcept in that dangerous, cheap, indecent way, of innumerable wants\r\nand deprivations, which the American people have begun to despise.\r\nThey have had some few disasters, but none of those of a fatal\r\ncharacter in the Pacific. The \"Winfield Scott\" was lost in entering\r\nthe harbor of Acapulco; the \"Tennessee\" in entering that of San\r\nFrancisco in a dense fog. The \"San Francisco\" was lost, as will be\r\nremembered, on this side, near our coast, as she sailed with troops\r\nfor the Pacific. The Nicaragua Transit Company fared much worse with\r\ntheir steamers in the Pacific. They lost the \"North America,\" the\r\n\"Independence,\" the \"S. S. Lewis,\" the \"Pioneer,\" and the \"Yankee\r\nBlade.\" Mr. Wm. Brown also lost his steamer \"America,\" which he was\r\nrunning between San Francisco and Oregon. She was burned.\r\n\r\nTheir dividends for four years have been but twelve per cent. And\r\nshould they be at any time thrown out of the service, more than half\r\nof their property would be irretrievably lost. This percentage of\r\ndividend would be large enough but for such possibilities as these,\r\nwhich may soon reduce it to a deficit and a loss. Thus it is that\r\nsteam stock should declare three times the dividend of other stocks,\r\nto be eventually equal to them. And hence it is that, with the clear\r\nrecord of this Company before the Government, and with an investment\r\nof between three and four millions of dollars, being at the same time\r\nfree from debt, the stock of the Company is selling at thirty-three\r\nper cent. below par. This is a good exemplification of my views in the\r\npreceding Sections regarding the costs, and hazards, and low values of\r\nocean steam stocks generally. Nor are the stocks of this Company kept\r\nfrom the public. They are advertised and sold at public auction at\r\nthese reduced rates every day in the year in this city; and no one of\r\nthe five hundred and four stockholders, among whom these interests are\r\ndiffused, seems anxious to put \"his all\" in the enterprise. And yet\r\nthere are some people who call such companies a monopoly. If a\r\nmonopoly, why do they not come forward, buy the stocks, keep them in\r\ntheir own hands, and profit by them; especially as a monopoly must be\r\ndoubly good when it can be bought for two thirds the cash originally\r\npaid for it!\r\n\r\nI have noticed this Company thus fully, because its extent of stock,\r\nand large field of operation, make it a fit illustration of the views\r\nwhich I have advanced throughout this work. I have no desire to\r\ndepreciate the stock, or in any other way injure the Company, as my\r\nown enterprise gives me quite enough to do.\r\n\r\nMany of the views advanced with regard to the Pacific Mail Company\r\nwill apply to the United States Mail Steamship Company. That Company,\r\nat the outset, built very fine steamers, and ran them incessantly,\r\nuntil they were unfit for duty. They have constantly supplied their\r\nplace, and have at all times, by building and by chartering at the\r\nhighest prices, kept up a large and costly fleet for their ramified\r\nservice. The service contemplated in their original contract, at\r\n$1.88-3/4 cents per mile, is but about two thirds of that actually\r\nperformed. The contract required them to run 3,200 miles semi-monthly,\r\nbut they actually perform semi-monthly 5,200. (_See Mr. King's Letter,\r\nPaper G._) The actual service has required nearly twice the number of\r\nsteamers necessary to do that for which they contracted, although a\r\npart of it is in the coasting trade. Consequently the steamers have\r\nbeen rapidly worn out, from too heavy duty, and the stock of the\r\nCompany has never paid as well as it should. The Company have,\r\nmorever, suffered severely from disaster. The \"Crescent City\" was lost\r\non the Bahama Banks, in 1855; all hands saved. The \"Cherokee\" was\r\nburned when in active service, in 1853; and the \"George Law,\" or\r\n\"Central America,\" but recently foundered at sea in a terrible gale.\r\nThey were all good ships; but like those other excellent ships, the\r\n\"Arctic\" and \"Pacific,\" they could not defy the powers of pure\r\naccident. In the same gale the \"Empire City\" was dismantled, having\r\nall of her upper works swept off, while the \"Illinois\" was injured by\r\nbeing on the Colorado Reef. They have both been undergoing most costly\r\nrepairs for several weeks. While writing this, the \"Philadelphia\" is\r\nalso in the shop. She recently broke her shaft and her cross-tail, and\r\nhad to put into Charleston. All of these repairs cost an immense sum\r\nof money, and are calculated, with the severe losses which the Company\r\nhas sustained, to dishearten the most hopeful and enterprising. Yet,\r\nsince these disasters, and the completion of the \"Moses Taylor,\" the\r\nCompany are about laying the keel of another fine ship. This is\r\nanother verification of my statement that the mail companies are in\r\nnearly every instance compelled to build new steamers in the very last\r\nyears of their contracted service. The new \"Adriatic\" attests the same\r\nfact on the part of the Collins Company. (_See pages 141 and 142._)\r\n\r\nThe Company have had at various times the \"Falcon,\" \"Ohio,\" \"Georgia,\"\r\n\"Crescent City,\" \"El Dorado,\" \"Cherokee,\" \"Empire City,\" \"Illinois,\"\r\nand \"Philadelphia,\" and now have the three last-named ships, the\r\n\"Granada,\" the \"Star of the West,\" and the new steamer \"Moses Taylor.\"\r\nThe benefits conferred by the Company's lines on the trade of the\r\ncountry generally, and especially on our southern seaboard and Gulf\r\nconnections, have been almost incalculable. They found all of these\r\nports in the undisputed possession of the British, whose steamers\r\nfurnished the only mail and locomotive facilities of the times. By\r\ntheir superior speed and accommodations the \"Georgia\" and the \"Ohio\"\r\nsoon drove those enterprising steamers from our coast, and confined\r\nthem to the foreign countries of the Gulf and the Carribean Sea, where\r\nthey yet rule triumphant in news, transport, and commerce. Our\r\nsouthern harbors are no longer filled with British cruisers, while in\r\ntheir stead we have built up a noble war marine, inured thousands of\r\nAmericans to the ocean steam service, and made one most effective\r\nmovement in the direction of successful defenses. (_See Letter of Hon.\r\nEdwin Croswell, Paper E, page 200._)\r\n\r\nOf the Collins Company it is hardly necessary that I should speak.\r\nThey have received much the largest subsidy from the Government; but\r\nthey have had a most difficult task to perform. Their ships have never\r\nbeen surpassed in any country, whether as to the excellent style of\r\ntheir prime construction, their large size, or their very unusual\r\nspeed. They have literally been engaged in a continual race across the\r\nocean for seven years, determined at whatever cost and hazard to far\r\nexcel those of the Cunard line. And this they have done most signally\r\nin all points of accommodation and speed. They have gained one and a\r\nhalf days the advantage over the Cunard line on their average voyages\r\nfor the seven years. And this was no small achievement. By reference\r\nto Section IV. it will be seen how great is the cost of attaining and\r\nmaintaining such speed with a steamer. The Collins ships, being so\r\nmuch larger than the Cunarders, the four present an aggregate tonnage\r\nnearly equal to the eight by which they run their weekly line. It is,\r\nmoreover, not proportionally so expensive to maintain seven or eight\r\nships on a line as four. The prime cost and repairs are by no means so\r\ngreat when engines are duplicated, or two sets built from the same\r\npatterns. Again, the general outlay in docks, shore establishment,\r\noffices, company paraphernalia, advertising, and innumerable items, is\r\nas great for a small as for a large fleet of steamers. The Collins\r\nline has to contend against all this. It also found the Cunard line\r\nlong and well established, and inwrought into the public favor. It had\r\nthe business, and most important of all, it monopolized the only\r\nfreights passing between the two countries; those from England to\r\nAmerica, which British shippers gave of course to British ships. They\r\nhave had also to pay much larger prices for construction, repairs,\r\nwages, etc., than the Cunard Company; and not having so large a\r\nservice and so large a fleet, they have not had so many reserve ships\r\nto fall back upon; but have been compelled frequently to send their\r\nships off but half repaired, which of itself entailed immensely heavy\r\nexpenses in ultimate repairs. There is very much to be said in favor\r\nof this Company, which has endeavored to build the finest ships in\r\nthe world, and navigate them the most rapidly. If they have\r\nprominently failed in any thing it is in building larger ships,\r\nrunning them faster, and being far more enterprising with them than\r\nwas required of the Company by the contract with the Government. Their\r\ndisasters have been saddening and severe; and yet they have resulted\r\nfrom nothing which could have been controlled by human foresight.\r\nThere is a great error in supposing that there are more marine\r\ndisasters among American than among British ships. Such is not the\r\ncase, as a careful examination of the lists will show.\r\n\r\nOf the mail line belonging to Mr. Vanderbilt, between New-York and\r\nBremen, _via_ Southampton, it is impossible now to say any thing. The\r\nsteamers \"North Star\" and \"Ariel,\" the one of 1,867-60/95 tons, and\r\nthe other of 1,295-28/95 tons, have but recently commenced the\r\nservice, on the gross mail receipts. Whether Mr. Vanderbilt desires to\r\nmake the service permanent or not, I am not advised.\r\n\r\nThe service of the Charleston and Havana line has been performed with\r\ngreat regularity; and although the return from it in the form of\r\npostages has been small, yet it has been of essential service to the\r\nSouth, in opening communications toward the Gulf, and in establishing\r\nmuch needed travelling facilities between Charleston, Savannah, and\r\nKey West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER A.\r\n\r\nLIST OF AMERICAN OCEAN STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mail service has 8 lines, and 21 steamers in commission, of 48,027\r\nregistered tonnage.

Iselin, of Havre, kindly furnished me the following:\r\n\r\n    \"The French Government has offered the following contracts:\r\n\r\n    \"Havre to New-York, 26 voyages a year, fr.3,100,000, or $620,000.\r\n\r\n    \"Bordeaux to Rio Janeiro, touching at Lisbon, Goree, Bahia, or\r\n    Pernambuco, and a branch line from Rio Janeiro to Montevideo and\r\n    Buenos Ayres, 24 voyages a year, fr.4,700,000, or $940,000. The\r\n    Government now requires 13 departures from Bordeaux and 13 from\r\n    Marseilles at the same price.\r\n\r\n    \"Nantes to St. Thomas, thence to Guadalupe, and thence to\r\n    Martinique, with the following branch lines:\r\n\r\n    \"No. 1.

From Martinique to Cayenne.\r\n\r\n    \"The subvention offered is fr.6,200,000, or $1,400,000.\r\n\r\n    \"The total amount of subvention offered for the 3 lines is\r\n    therefore 14 millions of francs per annum, or $2,800,000.\r\n\r\n    \"The Messageries Imperiales have given a tender for the Brazil\r\n    lines.\r\n\r\n    \"William Iselin of Havre, in connection with Mr. Calley St. Paul,\r\n    for the Havre and New-York line; the necessary capital of\r\n    $3,200,000 is subscribed; their intention is to have a weekly\r\n    departure from Havre to New-York, by making the fortnightly\r\n    departures of the French boats alternate with American Havre and\r\n    Bremen boats.\r\n\r\n    \"For the line from Nantes to the West-Indies the Company Gautier\r\n    is said to have given a tender; but it is doubtful if they can\r\n    make up their capital.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Messageries Imperiales_ is one of the largest and strongest\r\ncompanies in all Europe. They have the following different lines: the\r\nItalian, the Constantinople direct, the Levant, the Egyptian, the\r\nSyrian, that of the Archipelago, the Anatolia, the Thessalian, the\r\nDanubian, the Trebizond, the Algiers, the Oran, and the Tunis lines,\r\nand forty-seven sea-steamers. They have already obtained the Brazilian\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMr. Iselin and others have proposed for the United States line, and\r\nwill doubtless get it.\r\n\r\nThe Company Gautier may not get the West-India service, it is said.\r\nThey had the line from Havre to New-York, with the steamers Alma,\r\nCadis, Barcelona, Franc-Contois, Vigo, and the Lyonnaise, and without\r\nsubvention. They found it impossible to run it without subsidy, and\r\nhence, sought a new home for their steamers. They attempted to run\r\nfrom Havre to New-Orleans; but this again failed, after four voyages.\r\nThey had also the 1,800 ton ether ships, \"Francois Arago,\" and\r\n\"Jacquart,\" which broke down. These ether engines were built on the\r\nprinciple of De Tremblay; but the Company are now substituting steam\r\nfor the ether engines. Thus, the experience of this Company proves two\r\nimportant positions which I have taken; that ocean mail steamers can\r\nnot run on their receipts, and that many of the gazetted improvements\r\non steam propulsion and the ordinary methods are valueless.\r\n\r\nThe _Compagnie Gautier_ have a contract with Spain, for semi-monthly\r\nvoyages between Cadiz and Havana, and receive $25,000 per round voyage\r\nfor each steamer. They are all English built, iron vessels, of about\r\n1,800 tons each.

Edwin Croswell, will\r\npresent in detail a strong corroboration of the views which I have\r\ntaken in the preceding Sections. I copy first from the Report of 1852.\r\nThe Committee was composed of Hon. Thomas J. Rusk, Chairman, and\r\nMessrs. Soule, Hamlin, Upham, and Morton. The Report says:\r\n\r\n    \"Your Committee desire to have it understood at the outset, that,\r\n    regarding the ocean mail service as the offspring of the wants of\r\n    all of the producing classes of the country, they have not felt at\r\n    liberty to consider the propositions which have been presented to\r\n    them, in any other point of view than as connected with and\r\n    subservient to the general policy of the government, which\r\n    embraces alike every section of the country, and can not know nor\r\n    recognize any personal or local influence.\r\n\r\n    \"The system of ocean steam navigation was adopted by the\r\n    Government for the joint purpose of extending and advancing the\r\n    commercial and other great interests of the country, and, at the\r\n    same time, providing a marine force which might be easily made\r\n    available for the protection of American rights, in the event of a\r\n    collision with foreign powers. The attainment of this double\r\n    object was the motive which, in the opinion of Congress, justified\r\n    the advance of public funds in aid of private enterprise,\r\n    inasmuch as it was calculated to insure to the country the\r\n    acquisition of a powerful means of maritime defense, with little\r\n    or no expense, eventually, as the money so advanced was to be\r\n    reimbursed in money or in mail service at the option of the\r\n    parties concerned, while commerce and the arts would be promoted\r\n    during the time of peace.\r\n\r\n    \"At the time when this system was commenced, the ocean mails along\r\n    our whole Southern coast were in the hands of foreign carriers,\r\n    sustained and encouraged by the British Government, under the\r\n    forms of contracts to carry the British mails; while the Cunard\r\n    line between Liverpool and Boston, _via_ Halifax, constituted the\r\n    only medium of regular steam mail communication between the United\r\n    States and Europe. In this way the commercial interests of the\r\n    United States were, on the one hand, entirely at the mercy of\r\n    British steamers which plied along our Southern coast, entering\r\n    our ports at pleasure, and thereby acquiring an intimate knowledge\r\n    of the soundings and other peculiarities of our harbors--a\r\n    knowledge which might prove infinitely injurious to us in the\r\n    event of a war with Great Britain; and on the other, of a foreign\r\n    line of ocean mail steamers, which, under the liberal patronage of\r\n    the British Government, monopolized the steam mail postage and\r\n    freights between the two countries. Under such a state of things,\r\n    it became necessary to choose whether American commerce should\r\n    continue to be thus tributary to British maritime supremacy, or an\r\n    American medium of communication should be established through the\r\n    intervention of the Federal Government, in the form of advances of\r\n    pecuniary means in aid of individual enterprise. It had been found\r\n    to be impossible for our merchants to contend successfully, single\r\n    handed, against the joint efforts of the British Government and\r\n    British commercial influence. Our noble lines of packet ships\r\n    which had far outstripped the sailing vessels of all other\r\n    nations, in point of beauty and swiftness, had been superseded by\r\n    the introduction of steamers, the power and capacity of which\r\n    recommended them, as the best means of inter-communication by\r\n    mail, and of transportation for lighter and more profitable\r\n    freights, and American interests were becoming every day more and\r\n    more tributary to British ascendency on the ocean.\r\n\r\n    \"Under the circumstances above stated, it was impossible for\r\n    Congress to hesitate for a moment which course to pursue, and it\r\n    was determined to adopt a policy which, while it would be in\r\n    strict accordance with the spirit of our free institutions, should\r\n    place the country in its proper attitude, and render its commerce\r\n    and postal arrangements independent of all foreign or rival\r\n    agencies.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the correctness of this determination, experience has\r\n    furnished the most ample evidences in the results which thus far\r\n    have attended the prosecution of the system. The line between\r\n    New-York and Chagres _via_ New-Orleans and its auxiliaries, have,\r\n    by their superiority in point of swiftness and accommodation,\r\n    already superseded the British steamers which had previously plied\r\n    along our Southern maritime frontier, and the United States mails\r\n    for Mexico, South-America, and our possessions on the Pacific are\r\n    no longer in the hands of foreign carriers, but are transported in\r\n    American steamers of the first class, convertible, at a very small\r\n    expense, into war steamers, should occasion require, which have\r\n    commanded the admiration of the world by their fleetness and the\r\n    elegance of their accommodations for the travelling public. Our\r\n    Southern ports are, consequently, no longer frequented by British\r\n    steamers, commanded by officers of the British crown, whose\r\n    legitimate business it is to collect intelligence respecting the\r\n    approaches to and defenses of the harbors which they visit, to be\r\n    made available for their own purposes, in the event of the\r\n    existence of hostile relations.\r\n\r\n    \"A similar result has, to a certain extent, attended the\r\n    establishment of the American, or Collins line, between New-York\r\n    and Liverpool. Previously to the commencement of this line, the\r\n    transportation of the United States mail matter, as well as the\r\n    finer and more destructible descriptions of merchandise, requiring\r\n    rapidity of transmission to and from Europe, had been monopolized\r\n    by the British Cunard line; and the British Government had, within\r\n    the short space of six years, from the postage on this route\r\n    alone, derived a _clear income_ of no less than five million two\r\n    hundred and eighty thousand eight hundred dollars, after deducting\r\n    the amount paid to the concern under the contract to carry the\r\n    mails.\r\n\r\n    \"Since the establishment of the Collins line, notwithstanding the\r\n    combined efforts of the British Government and commercial\r\n    interests to confine their freights and postages to the Cunard\r\n    line, the revenue to the Post Office Department of the United\r\n    States has amounted to several hundreds of thousands of dollars\r\n    per annum, whilst a large proportion of the money for freights has\r\n    been received by American citizens. The effects of this measure\r\n    have, it is true, thus far been but partial, because the trips of\r\n    this line have been but twice a month, while those of its rival\r\n    have, for a considerable portion of the time been weekly. During\r\n    the intervals between the trips of the American line, the postages\r\n    and freights must, of necessity, enure to the advantage of the\r\n    British, and, consequently, the evil referred to has been but\r\n    partially remedied.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the large steamers built, the Report says:\r\n\r\n    \"It is not to be supposed that engines of such vast dimensions\r\n    could have been constructed in a country where there were, as yet,\r\n    no workshops adapted to the purpose and where labor is very high,\r\n    as cheaply as in a country where every appliance of the kind\r\n    already existed and where the prices of labor are proverbially\r\n    low. Nor can it be reasonably imagined that vessels of this\r\n    description could have been navigated on as good terms, by men\r\n    taken from this country, where there was little or no competition\r\n    in this peculiar branch of maritime service, as by those who were\r\n    easily to be found in a country in which the density of population\r\n    and consequent competition for employment, caused the wages to be\r\n    small.\r\n\r\n    \"An attempt seems to have been made, in certain quarters, to\r\n    create an impression that the aid heretofore extended by the\r\n    Government to the individuals engaged under contracts to carry the\r\n    ocean mail, has been induced by feelings of personal friendship,\r\n    on the part of members of Congress. Such is not the case. The\r\n    friends of the system of ocean mail steam navigation, have, so far\r\n    as your Committee are advised, considered this important subject\r\n    as a matter of great national concern and independently of the\r\n    very secondary motive of individual interest. The question\r\n    presented to their minds has not been whether A, B, or C should\r\n    have a privilege extended to him, but whether the commerce,\r\n    manufactures, and agriculture of the country would be benefited by\r\n    the performance of a public service through the instrumentality of\r\n    individual enterprise, under proper conditions and restrictions.\r\n    As matters stood at the period when the system was adopted, Great\r\n    Britain was exerting herself, successfully, to make the United\r\n    States, in common with the rest of the world, tributary to her\r\n    maritime supremacy. She possessed the monopoly of steam connection\r\n    between the United States and Europe, the West-Indies and\r\n    South-America. There was not a letter sent by ocean steam\r\n    conveyance, in these quarters, which did not pay its tribute to\r\n    the British crown, and not a passenger nor parcel of merchandise\r\n    transported, by the agency of steam, upon the ocean, which did not\r\n    furnish profit to the British capitalist. Great Britain asserted\r\n    her right to be the 'queen of the ocean,' and, as such, she levied\r\n    her imposts upon the industry and intelligence of all of the\r\n    nations that frequented that highway of the world.\r\n\r\n    \"In this condition of affairs, the law instituting the system of\r\n    American ocean mail steam transportation in its present form was\r\n    enacted, as the best, if not the only means of correcting a great\r\n    evil, and, at the same time, building up a naval force which\r\n    should be available for national defense in the event of a war.\r\n    The system so instituted was deemed to be not only calculated to\r\n    draw forth and reward the enterprise of American citizens, but it\r\n    avoided the difficulty of keeping upon hand, in time of peace, a\r\n    large and, for the moment at least, useless military marine, which\r\n    could only be preserved in a condition for effective service by a\r\n    vast annual outlay of the public money.\r\n\r\n    \"_It was right and proper, then, in the opinion of your\r\n    Committee, that these ocean steam facilities should exist, through\r\n    the intervention of the Government, more especially as they were,\r\n    in all probability, beyond the reach of private means._\r\n\r\n    \"The transportation of the ocean mails, with the greatest possible\r\n    advantage to the important interests of the country at large, is\r\n    an object of paramount importance; but which, however desirable,\r\n    can only be effected at great expense. It is a matter of\r\n    comparatively small moment at what precise time this expense is to\r\n    be paid, provided that the end in view can be attained with\r\n    certainty. The temporary loan of a part of the means required,\r\n    under proper securities for reimbursement, appears to be the\r\n    readiest mode by which the purpose can be effected. How is this\r\n    security to be acquired? Simply, by taking due care that the funds\r\n    advanced shall be faithfully and honestly applied to the object\r\n    for which they are intended, and then holding a lien upon the\r\n    ships, for the construction of which they are appropriated, in\r\n    such a manner as to insure the reimbursement of the sums advanced\r\n    in the form of mail service or money; or, should circumstances\r\n    require, of ships suitable for national purposes, as war steamers.\r\n    This has been done. In all cases the contractors for the\r\n    transportation of the ocean mails, have been required to cause\r\n    their ships to be built and equipped under the immediate\r\n    superintendence of experienced naval officers and under the\r\n    direction of naval constructors, appointed by the Government, in\r\n    such manner as to be convertible, at the smallest possible\r\n    expense, into war steamers of the first class.\r\n\r\n    \"Nor has experience caused any regret, on the part of the friends\r\n    of the system, further than that in some cases, owing to the\r\n    increase in the tonnage and power of the ships and other\r\n    circumstances, the expenses incurred by the contractors have\r\n    outrun the receipts, and they have incurred heavy losses, which\r\n    might even prove ruinous, if they were forced to sell the property\r\n    acquired in this form. It should always be borne in mind, however,\r\n    that in these cases, the increase of expenditure thus incurred has\r\n    been caused by a laudable ambition on the part of the proprietors\r\n    of these lines to do even more than they were required to do under\r\n    their contracts, with a view to secure the confidence of the\r\n    Government and the public. It should also be remembered that in\r\n    thus increasing the cost and consequent value of their ships,\r\n    these companies have enlarged the security of the Government for\r\n    the money loaned, and promoted the safety and comfort of\r\n    passengers. It has, in no instance, been charged that the\r\n    companies referred to have, in any way, misapplied the aid\r\n    extended to them, or given to it an improper direction. The\r\n    products of their expenditures, even admitting them to have been\r\n    greater than they might have been, show for themselves, in placing\r\n    the American steam mail service, as far as it has gone, at the\r\n    head of all others, in point of accommodation, elegance, strength,\r\n    and swiftness. Nor is this all. The establishment of these lines\r\n    is not to be regarded merely with reference to the immediate\r\n    profits arising from the system, in connection with the\r\n    transportation of the mails. Millions of money have been saved to\r\n    American citizens, which, in the absence of these ocean steam\r\n    lines, would have gone to fill foreign coffers. The Committee will\r\n    refer to one fact in illustration of the truth of this\r\n    proposition. Before the Collins line was established, the Cunard\r\n    line was receiving L7 10_s_ sterling per ton for freights; at\r\n    present (1852) the rate is about L4 sterling. By whom were these\r\n    L7 10_s_ sterling paid? By the _American consumer_, in most\r\n    instances, upon articles of _British manufacture brought to this\r\n    country by a British line_. At present the American consumer pays\r\n    but L4 sterling per ton; and, presuming that the American merchant\r\n    makes his importations in the American line, this freight is paid\r\n    to our own people and goes to swell the sum of our national\r\n    wealth. Thus, it will be seen that, formerly, the American\r\n    consumer paid _very nearly twice as much for the service_, and\r\n    enriched the British capitalist; whereas, at present, he not only\r\n    saves _one half of the former cost of freight to himself_ but, in\r\n    paying the remaining half, benefits his fellow citizen, who in\r\n    return aids in consuming perhaps the very merchandise which he has\r\n    imported.\r\n\r\n    \"Under these circumstances, can any reasonable man doubt the\r\n    propriety, even in a pecuniary point of view, of sustaining the\r\n    present system, which, at its very commencement, has given such\r\n    ample proofs of its usefulness? Your Committee think not, and do\r\n    not hesitate to give it as their opinion that, _merely as a matter\r\n    of dollars and cents_, the service in question should be liberally\r\n    sustained by Congress, and will in the end make ample returns.\r\n\r\n    \"But your Committee regard this proposition as one, the mere money\r\n    feature of which is of minor consequence, when brought into\r\n    comparison with other more important considerations. The question\r\n    is no longer whether certain individuals shall be saved from loss\r\n    or enabled to make fortunes, but whether the _American_ shall\r\n    succumb to the British lines, and Great Britain be again permitted\r\n    to monopolize ocean mail steam transportation, not only between\r\n    Europe and America, but throughout the world. We are aspiring to\r\n    the first place among the nations of the earth, in a commercial\r\n    point of view--a place which belongs to us as a matter of\r\n    right--and are we to suffer ourselves to be overcome by British\r\n    commercial capitalists under the auspices of the British crown?\r\n    Shall it be said that, at the very moment when our steamships are\r\n    admitted to excel those of any other people on the face of the\r\n    globe, our enterprising citizens have been forced to relinquish\r\n    the proud position they have attained, for the want of a few\r\n    thousands of dollars, when the national treasury is full to\r\n    overflowing? Let this end be attained and our great commercial\r\n    rival will have postages and freights all her own way, while we\r\n    shall be compelled to contribute, as heretofore, to her undisputed\r\n    supremacy.\r\n\r\n    \"With a view to a full and fair understanding of this important\r\n    subject, your Committee have communicated, through their Chairman,\r\n    with the Executive Departments of the Government and the\r\n    presidents of the various companies engaged in carrying the ocean\r\n    mail by steam, and will now proceed to lay before the Senate the\r\n    results of their careful inquiries. It may not be improper here\r\n    again to note, by way of illustration, the benefits to be derived\r\n    from ocean steam mail transportation, when in successful\r\n    operation, as manifested in the case of the British Cunard line,\r\n    under the auspices of the British Government. During the first six\r\n    years of its existence, the line above named received from the\r\n    Government no less than $2,550,000, while the Government received\r\n    from the Company, in the form of postages, the enormous sum of\r\n    $7,836,800, or $5,826,800 net revenue.\r\n\r\n    \"The Government has paid to the line, (the Collins,) for mail\r\n    service, in the two years, $770,000, and has received from the\r\n    line $513,546.80. If the receipts be deducted from the outlay, the\r\n    balance against the Government is $256,453.20 for the whole time,\r\n    or $128,226.60 per annum.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus it appears, that from a fair statement of the account\r\n    current between the line and the Government, the latter is out of\r\n    pocket, at the end of the two first years of the undertaking and\r\n    under circumstances the most disadvantageous to the line,\r\n    $256,453.20, or in other words, has paid $128,226.60 per annum,\r\n    for carrying the ocean mail by steam over about six thousand miles\r\n    of the greatest commercial thoroughfare in the world, for which,\r\n    as yet, it has received nothing in return. But your Committee\r\n    would ask, what has _the country_ received in return for this\r\n    $256,453.20? They will furnish the answer. The country has\r\n    received through the proprietors of this line, in the form of\r\n    freights and passage money, a no less amount than $1,979,760.85,\r\n    in cash; and, if the reduction in the prices of freight formerly\r\n    paid to the British line be taken into account, nearly as much\r\n    more, by saving the difference in freights and passage money, to\r\n    say nothing of the general advantages derived by all of our\r\n    producing interests from the existence of this American line,\r\n    which, as your Committee believe, are incalculable. The money\r\n    account will then stand as follows: Government debtor to\r\n    $256,453.80; Country creditor to $1,979,760.85 _in cash_; and if\r\n    the former be deducted from the latter, the balance in favor of\r\n    the country will stand $1,723,307.05, _in cash alone_, leaving out\r\n    of view the duties on increased importations caused by the\r\n    establishment of the American line.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Pacific Mail Steam Company, the Report says:\r\n\r\n    \"It will be seen from the above, that the total cost of the six\r\n    vessels which have been accepted by the officers whose duty it was\r\n    to supervise them and decide whether they had been built in\r\n    accordance with the requisitions of the law and terms of the\r\n    contract, and whose decision is presumed, by your Committee, to be\r\n    conclusive in the premises, has been $1,555,069, and that their\r\n    aggregate tonnage is 7,365 tons, instead of 5,200 tons, the amount\r\n    agreed for. In addition to these ships, as your Committee are\r\n    informed, the company has in the Pacific seven steamers, with an\r\n    aggregate tonnage of five thousand tons, not yet accepted by the\r\n    Government. The additional steamers are, and have been, always\r\n    kept ready to replace the mail steamers in the event of detention.\r\n    The cost of these additional steamers has been, it is stated,\r\n    about two thirds of that of the accepted steamers of the same\r\n    class, say about $1,036,712, making in all an outlay for\r\n    steamships alone, of $2,518,337.\r\n\r\n    \"It appears that the whole number of passengers, of all classes,\r\n    transported by the Pacific Mail Ship Company, the line in\r\n    question, previously to December 31, 1851, from Panama northward,\r\n    has been 17,016, and from Oregon southward, 13,332. The prices of\r\n    passage have constantly fluctuated, but, on the date above named,\r\n    the 31st of December, 1851, the average rates were, for the first\r\n    cabin, two hundred and twenty-two dollars; second cabin, one\r\n    hundred and sixty dollars, and steerage, one hundred and seven\r\n    dollars, between Panama and San Francisco. In the early stages of\r\n    emigration the prices were increased in consequence of the\r\n    enormous prices of labor and supplies on that comparatively\r\n    unsettled coast, but were subsequently reduced. At the\r\n    commencement of the undertaking, the Company incurred, of\r\n    necessity, vast expenses in the selection of proper harbors for\r\n    taking in provisions, water, coal, etc., and in the construction\r\n    of _depots_; and even at present, coal and supplies of every\r\n    description are sent to the Pacific _via_ Cape Horn, a distance of\r\n    from thirteen thousand to fifteen thousand miles.\r\n\r\n    \"The freights from Panama northward, have been small in amount,\r\n    and confined to the lighter descriptions of articles sent by\r\n    express, while the mails have been very large, amounting in some\r\n    instances to one hundred and fifty bags, each, and, together with\r\n    coal, water, etc., occupying all of the space not required for\r\n    passengers. From California, the freights southward, have\r\n    consisted of treasure, amounting, it is supposed, to the value of\r\n    seventy millions of dollars, but it is extremely difficult to\r\n    compute the worth accurately, as a large portion of the gold,\r\n    etc., sent has been in the possession of passengers, and the value\r\n    does not appear in the manifests.\"\r\n\r\nIn noticing the Panama Railroad and the California lines, the Report\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"Nearly two millions of dollars have already, as your Committee\r\n    are informed, been expended on this important work, by a company\r\n    possessed of ample means, and the completion of it can not fail to\r\n    open the way for a vast commerce, between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\n    oceans, and at the same time cause our fellow-citizens in\r\n    California and Oregon no longer to be regarded as exiles. This\r\n    road being once opened, the passage of the Isthmus, now so much\r\n    dreaded, will be effected with perfect ease and comfort in a\r\n    couple of hours, instead of two or three days, as at present, and\r\n    families, instead of individuals, will be enabled to seek homes in\r\n    the fertile valleys of our possessions on the Pacific coast. The\r\n    value of the lines of ocean steamers, of which your Committee have\r\n    been speaking, to the commercial and other great interests of our\r\n    country and the world at large, can not well be estimated until\r\n    this road shall have been finished and put into full operation.\r\n    When such shall be the case, the trade between California and\r\n    Oregon, as well as that of China and the islands of the Pacific\r\n    and Indian oceans and the Atlantic States and Europe, which now\r\n    passes around Cape Horn, a distance of some fifteen thousand\r\n    miles, will be enabled to take a direct course across the Isthmus\r\n    of Panama, the passage of which will require but two or three\r\n    hours. The United States mail, from San Francisco to New York, has\r\n    already been transported within the space of twenty-five days and\r\n    eighteen hours, a day less than the time claimed to have been\r\n    taken by any other route, at a period, too, when there were but\r\n    seven or eight miles of the road in operation. On a late occasion,\r\n    five hundred government troops were sent to California by this\r\n    route, and were placed at the point of their destination in a\r\n    little more than thirty-five days, without any serious desertion\r\n    or accident of any kind. A similar operation by the way of Cape\r\n    Horn would have occupied six months at least. The store-ship\r\n    Lexington, which sailed from New-York for San Francisco, during\r\n    the last year, arrived at the latter place on the last day of\r\n    February, 1852, after a passage of _seven months and one day_. In\r\n    a country the military establishment of which is so small as that\r\n    of the United States, facilities of concentrating troops at points\r\n    distant from each other, in a short time, are of incalculable\r\n    value, and may be said to add manifold to the efficiency of the\r\n    military force.\r\n\r\n    \"From what has been already said, it will be seen that the Pacific\r\n    Mail Steamship Company, independently of the associate line on\r\n    this side of the Isthmus, and without taking into view the cost of\r\n    the railroad, has expended in the construction of mail steamers\r\n    alone $2,518,337; and if to this be added $2,606,440.45, the\r\n    expense incurred for a similar purpose by the Company on the\r\n    Atlantic side of the Isthmus, the entire cost of steamships, to\r\n    the two companies engaged in the transportation of the California\r\n    and Oregon mails, has been $5,124,777.\r\n\r\n    \"It is no more than sheer justice that your Committee should state\r\n    that the California lines, east as well as west of the Isthmus of\r\n    Panama, have proved themselves worthy in all respects of the\r\n    confidence of the country. In no single instance has an accident\r\n    occurred involving loss of life or serious injury in any way to\r\n    the travelling public. Such is the strength of the vessels\r\n    employed, that on two several occasion when, owing to dense fogs\r\n    and under-currents, cooperating with the defectiveness of the\r\n    charts of the Pacific coast, one of the ships of the Aspinwall\r\n    line struck, at one time, upon a soft bottom, and, at another,\r\n    upon a hard sandy bar, she was steamed off, after thumping,\r\n    without the slightest injury whatever. Facts such as these are the\r\n    more important, inasmuch as several steamers have lately been lost\r\n    on the same coast with a great sacrifice of human life, evidently\r\n    owing to a want of the strength necessary to resist, effectually,\r\n    the force of the winds and waves. In the opinion of your\r\n    Committee, the security afforded to travellers by the strong\r\n    fastenings and heavy timbers of the ocean mail steamers, built as\r\n    they are, under the supervision of naval officers, who are\r\n    selected on account of their thorough acquaintance with and\r\n    experience in such matters, and made capable of sustaining heavy\r\n    armaments, is a matter of the greatest moment. Experience has\r\n    shown that, in the race after gain, our countrymen are, perhaps,\r\n    more regardless of risk to human life than the people of any other\r\n    country in the world. Scarcely a day passes without fresh\r\n    evidences of the truth of this proposition. The river, as well as\r\n    the sea-going steamers, are generally built with reference to\r\n    speed and lightness, coupled with smallness of draft of water, and\r\n    hence, in case of touching the ground, or of violent storms, it is\r\n    found that if one portion of the frame gives way, the breaking up\r\n    of the entire structure follows with a rapidity that is but too\r\n    well calculated to show the slight manner in which these vessels\r\n    are constructed. Your Committee think that the additional\r\n    expenditure of a few hundreds of thousands of dollars is a matter\r\n    not worthy of consideration, when brought into comparison with the\r\n    loss of life, and would rather see even millions devoted to the\r\n    construction of _strong steamers_, than witness the sudden and\r\n    heart-rending ruptures of the dearest ties of our nature, caused\r\n    by the accidents that so frequently occur. Such is their feeling\r\n    of stern disapprobation of the reckless indifference respecting\r\n    the safety of passengers, daily manifested by some of the\r\n    proprietors and officers of steam lines, that they are resolved,\r\n    so far at least as they are concerned, not in any way to\r\n    countenance, directly or indirectly, such a course of proceeding.\r\n    In the extension of the system of ocean mail transportation which\r\n    they propose to recommend, care will be taken, that the steamers\r\n    which carry the Government mails shall be regarded as national\r\n    ships, to a certain extent, and as such, under the charge of the\r\n    law-making power, and be so built as to secure safety to\r\n    travellers; and that, in all contracts, this consideration shall\r\n    be regarded as one of paramount importance.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding a few sailing-ship owners in New-York and Boston, who had\r\nmemorialized Congress against the Collins and other lines, the Report\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"The memorialists are loud in their complaints respecting the\r\n    alleged improper interference of the Government with matters that\r\n    should be left, as they say, entirely to individual enterprise,\r\n    which in their opinion becomes paralyzed under the effects of\r\n    Government patronage bestowed upon some to the exclusion of\r\n    others. If the authors of this memorial will take a fair and\r\n    dispassionate view of the matter, they will, as your Committee\r\n    think, be convinced that they are wrong in their supposition, and\r\n    that the Government has not gratuitously meddled in concerns with\r\n    which it should have nothing to do. The merchants and ship-owners\r\n    referred to seem to forget, in the first place, that the system of\r\n    ocean steam mail navigation is intended to secure adequate\r\n    protection for our commerce from foreign aggression in the event\r\n    of war; and in the second, that it was instituted at a moment when\r\n    the fine packet ships, to which the memorialists refer with such\r\n    becoming pride, had in fact been driven from the ocean to a\r\n    certain extent by the overwhelming power of a British mail steam\r\n    line, sustained by the British Government, which had monopolized\r\n    ocean mail and passenger steam transportation, as well as the\r\n    freights of lighter and more perishable descriptions of\r\n    merchandise. If, as these gentlemen have stated, the sailing ships\r\n    have been made to succumb, it has been under the force of an\r\n    agency more certain and not less powerful than the one named by\r\n    them--wielded by foreign capitalists and directed by a foreign\r\n    government claiming for itself the supremacy of the ocean. The\r\n    Cunard line of ocean steamers had been in possession of a monopoly\r\n    of freights, letter postage, and passage money for years, in\r\n    despite of the attempts of the memorialists to resist,\r\n    successfully, before the Government of the United States, seeing\r\n    that American interests were made tributary to foreign capital,\r\n    aided by a foreign government, adopted the wise course of\r\n    correcting the evil by kindred means, and placing, at least, to a\r\n    certain extent, American interests under the auspices of American\r\n    intelligence and enterprise. What would have been the condition of\r\n    the New-York lines and other ships had not the Government of the\r\n    United States thought proper to extend its aid to the\r\n    establishment of the Collins line? Would it have been any better\r\n    than at present? or rather would it not have been infinitely\r\n    worse? Had the Cunard line continued to prosper, as it must have\r\n    done in the natural course of things, would it not in all\r\n    probability have increased its number of ships until it would have\r\n    monopolized every description of ocean transportation? Would not\r\n    the trade with the United States have been entirely carried on in\r\n    British steamers, navigated at small expense, and therefore able\r\n    to do the carrying trade at low prices? Again, what would have\r\n    been the condition of the Southern coasting business, so far as\r\n    mails, passengers, and light freights, at least, are concerned,\r\n    had the fourteen British steamers then employed been permitted to\r\n    operate, unchecked by the American line of mail steamers, between\r\n    New-York and Chagres? Would it not have been entirely at the mercy\r\n    of the commissioned agents of the British crown, who so well know\r\n    how to avail themselves of opportunities to promote their own\r\n    interests by advancing those of their government? To carry the\r\n    inquiry further, what would have been the condition of our\r\n    possessions on the Pacific coast, visited as they would have been\r\n    by British steamers--for where is the spot on the inhabited or\r\n    inhabitable globe to which they do not bear the union jack of old\r\n    England--had not the Aspinwall line been established? Such is the\r\n    universal pervasion of the money power in British hands, that at\r\n    present, as is well known, the Cunard line has extended a branch\r\n    to Havre, to transport goods to England almost free of cost, with\r\n    a view to appropriate to itself the freights from that quarter,\r\n    and thus not only crush the American line of steamers to Havre,\r\n    but be enabled to underbid the Collins line, and, if possible,\r\n    again monopolize the trade with the United States over that route.\r\n    Would all this have raised the prices of freights in American\r\n    sailing vessels, and given an advantage to the memorialists in\r\n    question, who had at one time monopolized to themselves the\r\n    freights, postage, and passage money in sailing ships? or would\r\n    not, on the contrary, such a state of things have operated so to\r\n    give a British tendency to trade everywhere, and to furnish\r\n    freights to British ships, at prices at which the American ship\r\n    owners could not afford to navigate their vessels?\r\n\r\n    \"What, the Committee would ask, has the Government of the United\r\n    States done in the premises? Having under its charge the control\r\n    and direction of the United States mails upon land and sea, it has\r\n    thought proper to say that it would pay for the transportation of\r\n    the mails in _American steamers_, which can, if necessary, be\r\n    converted, at a small expense, into war steamers, and adopted, if\r\n    need be, into the navy proper, at an appraised value, and thereby\r\n    become efficient protectors of American commerce in the event of a\r\n    war. This is the head and front of the Government's offending, and\r\n    has, forsooth, aroused the ire of the commercial monopolists of\r\n    New-York, Boston, and elsewhere, because they can not any longer\r\n    enjoy the gains which, for more than a quarter of a century, they\r\n    had wrested from the mass of consumers throughout the land, north,\r\n    south, east, and west. Your Committee must say that, in their\r\n    opinion, such complaints come with a bad grace from such quarters,\r\n    and it is to be feared that victorious steam will ere long,\r\n    without the aid of the Federal Government, supersede the sailing\r\n    ships of the memorialists, through the instrumentality of the\r\n    discoveries daily in progress, whereby the navigation of vessels\r\n    propelled by that power will be made a matter of comparatively\r\n    small cost.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of steam communication with Para and Rio de Janeiro, the\r\nReport further says:\r\n\r\n    \"When the almost unbounded capacity for trade of the basins of the\r\n    La Plata and Amazon is taken into view, embracing as it does a\r\n    great variety of useful products which may be advantageously\r\n    exchanged for the manufactures and agricultural productions of our\r\n    own country, the mind is at a loss what limit to assign to the\r\n    trade to which civilization and the extension of commercial\r\n    facilities must eventually give rise. Nor are the advantages of\r\n    this great prospective commerce to be confined to the immediate\r\n    intercourse between this country and the regions to which we\r\n    refer. While the prevalence of certain winds, and the form of the\r\n    coast of South-America, are favorable to a direct trade with the\r\n    continent of North-America, they are such as to compel the\r\n    commerce with Europe to pass along our shores, and thus constitute\r\n    our Atlantic seaports so many stopping places at which the ships\r\n    of the old world may touch in their voyages to and fro. Heretofore\r\n    the policy of the governments which occupy the regions watered by\r\n    the La Plata and the Amazon, and their respective tributaries, has\r\n    been so exclusive in its character as to trammel, if not entirely\r\n    prevent, their intercourse with distant nations. The different\r\n    sovereignties which have sprung into existence since South-America\r\n    became independent of European control, have been so jealous of\r\n    each other that they have appeared to try which should be most\r\n    succesful in expelling foreign commerce, lest it might bring to\r\n    some one of them benefits which others did not and could not\r\n    possess. A wiser policy, however, appears to be about to prevail\r\n    since the fall of Rosas, and there is good reason to believe that,\r\n    hereafter, the commerce of those communities with the rest of the\r\n    world, will be placed upon a more liberal foundation. Should such\r\n    be the case, Rio de Janeiro can not fail to become the great\r\n    centre of a largely increased trade in the southern hemisphere.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Should it be preferred to limit the extent of the American line\r\n    to Para, at the mouth of the Amazon, the largest river in the\r\n    world, there is at present a Brazilian line between that point and\r\n    Rio de Janeiro, which, with the lines between Rio and the mouth of\r\n    the La Plata, will render the connection complete.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the Amazon, it is proper to state that it is navigable by the\r\n    largest vessels, and presents a line of shore of not less than\r\n    six thousand miles, abounding in every description of product,\r\n    with climates of all temperatures and soils adapted to all sorts\r\n    of vegetable growth. As the regions through which this vast river\r\n    passes are peopled by communities to which manufacturing is\r\n    unknown, it will at once be seen what an immense market will be\r\n    opened to American industry in the various departments of the\r\n    useful arts. The proposed connection would, together with the\r\n    intercourse by steam, which will inevitably be established on the\r\n    Amazon, draw to that river the trade of the interior, which at\r\n    present passes over the Andes on the backs of sheep and mules to\r\n    the Pacific ocean, and constitutes a large portion of the\r\n    commodities that are transported around Cape Horn. With a view to\r\n    this river navigation, Brazil has already entered into a boundary\r\n    treaty with Peru, by which she has engaged to establish steamboat\r\n    navigation on the Peruvian tributaries of the Amazon, and is\r\n    preparing to put seven steamers upon the river, where none have\r\n    heretofore been.\r\n\r\n    \"The experience of the world has shown that nations do not become\r\n    commercial or manufacturing, so long as the products of the soil\r\n    are sufficiently abundant to yield them wealth; and, hence, it may\r\n    be reasonably inferred that the carrying trade to and from\r\n    South-America will, if proper measures be taken, fall into the\r\n    hands of American ship-owners. By way of ascertaining what the\r\n    extent of this trade will be, if reference be had to the interior\r\n    or back country as the standard of the commercial resources\r\n    furnished by rivers, it will be found that the total area drained\r\n    by the rivers of the world is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                               _Sq.

If Great Britain be suffered to\r\n    monopolize commerce as she has heretofore done by her steam\r\n    navigation, her people will enjoy this great boon; but if, on the\r\n    contrary, the United States take advantage of circumstances as\r\n    they should, the prize will be won by Americans.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Your Committee would remark, in concluding this Report, that,\r\n    regarding as they do the existence and rapid extension of the\r\n    system of ocean mail steam navigation, as absolutely essential to\r\n    the dignity and permanent prosperity of the country, and as the\r\n    only means, consistent with the genius and policy of our free\r\n    institutions, of acquiring a maritime strength, which, by keeping\r\n    pace with the improvements of the age, shall place us upon an\r\n    equal footing with other civilized countries of the world, without\r\n    the necessity of an overgrown and expensive naval establishment\r\n    proper, in time of peace, they would feel themselves derelict in\r\n    the performance of their duties, did they not recommend the\r\n    measure, with the earnestness which its importance demands.\r\n\r\n    \"Circumstances indicate, with a clearness not to be misunderstood,\r\n    that in any future struggle for superiority on the ocean, the\r\n    contest will be decided by the power of steam. With a view to this\r\n    result, England has applied herself with even more than her wonted\r\n    energy to the construction of a regular steam navy which shall be\r\n    superior to all others. The number of ships which Great Britain\r\n    has of this kind, is at present two hundred and seventy-one, and\r\n    there are no less than nine royal war steamers in progress of\r\n    construction, to say nothing of the mail and other steamers which\r\n    are being built. The course thus pursued by the great commercial\r\n    rival of the United States, renders a corresponding energy and\r\n    activity on our part absolutely necessary, in a national point of\r\n    view; a steam navy must be provided for future emergencies in the\r\n    way proposed by the Committee, or war steamers must be built at an\r\n    enormous outlay of public money and kept ready in the navy yards,\r\n    or in commission, at an expense which is appalling to every lover\r\n    of judicious economy, or the stripes and stars of our country,\r\n    which have heretofore floated so triumphantly on every sea, must\r\n    grow dim, not only before the 'meteor flag of England,' but the\r\n    standards of the secondary powers of Europe. If members of\r\n    Congress are prepared to adopt either of these latter two\r\n    alternatives, let them say so, and let a system which promises,\r\n    under an honest and faithful discharge of duty on the part of the\r\n    executive branch of the Government, to realize the most sanguine\r\n    expectations of its friends, be at once abandoned. Let Great\r\n    Britain be again the guardian of our commercial interests and the\r\n    beneficiary of American trade. Let the Liverpool, Bremen, Havre,\r\n    California, and other lines, which have furnished twenty-four as\r\n    noble sea steamers as ever floated, be abandoned to their fate,\r\n    and let the Cunard line and other British steam mail lines and\r\n    royal steamers supply their places on the Atlantic and Pacific\r\n    oceans, and our Southern seas.\r\n\r\n    \"Your Committee would again repeat that the question to be\r\n    considered is not one of mere dollars and cents, or whether\r\n    certain individuals are to be sustained, or not, but one of\r\n    infinitely greater consequence--whether this proud republic shall\r\n    now and hereafter exist as a power competent to maintain her\r\n    rights upon the ocean. The present condition of political affairs\r\n    in Europe is such as, in the opinion of many, to threaten a\r\n    general war among the nations of that quarter of the globe, and\r\n    the United States should stand ready, and able too, to protect the\r\n    rights of her citizens upon the ocean, in such an event. Were such\r\n    a crisis to take place to-morrow, or the next year, or within the\r\n    next five years, is the country prepared for it? The steam navy\r\n    proper amounts to sixteen steamers of all classes, which, together\r\n    with the twenty-four ocean mail steamers in the employ of the Post\r\n    Office Department, would give us a steam naval force not exceeding\r\n    forty in all. Is this the position we should occupy, while Great\r\n    Britain has at command upwards of three hundred war and mail\r\n    steamers? France has, it is believed, upwards of a hundred, and\r\n    the secondary powers of Europe have naval steam armaments in\r\n    proportion, most of them exceeding our own. This question will be\r\n    decided by the continuation or rejection of the system under\r\n    consideration, which, with all the difficulties attendant upon new\r\n    enterprises and under the most embarrassing circumstances, has\r\n    gone very far to sustain itself, and promises, at no distant\r\n    period, to become a source of large revenue to the Government, and\r\n    incalculable commercial advantages, pecuniarily and otherwise, to\r\n    the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is copied from the Report made by Mr. Rusk in 1850, and\r\npublished in Special Report of the Secretary of the Navy, 1852.\r\nSpeaking of the services of the mail steamers in our system of\r\ndefenses, the Report says:\r\n\r\n    \"The truth is, that, in the opinion of your Committee, the temper\r\n    of the times requires that we shall keep pace with the rapid\r\n    improvements of other nations in their commercial and military\r\n    marine, and that the only choice is, whether it is to be done by\r\n    constructing vessels for the packet service, at a boundless\r\n    expense to the Government, or by aiding private enterprise, and\r\n    thus not only eventually avoiding expense, but adding largely to\r\n    the revenues of the country. It will be seen from the above\r\n    extract from Mr. King's speech, that, in the course of five years,\r\n    the balance in favor of the Government from the Cunard line alone\r\n    was $5,286,000. The New-York and Liverpool and Bremen lines will\r\n    come in for a large, if not by far the greater, share of the\r\n    postage and freightage heretofore enjoyed by the Cunard line; and\r\n    the line to Chagres, for the advantages that have, up to the time\r\n    of its partial commencement, been in the exclusive possession of\r\n    the British packet establishment in that direction. Nor are the\r\n    freightage and postage moneys the only sources of profit. In\r\n    proportion to the increase of these facilities will be the\r\n    extension of trade, and consequently the Government will receive\r\n    the duties payable upon all foreign merchandise brought into the\r\n    country. Besides, persons _in transitu_ will leave much money in\r\n    our cities and along their routes, to say nothing of the porterage\r\n    and costs of transportation of goods. To benefit our people is to\r\n    benefit our Government; as the more we enrich the former, the more\r\n    able are they to contribute to the support of the latter.\r\n\r\n    \"To construct ships and keep them in our navy-yards, subject to\r\n    the injuries of time and casualties, does not consist with the\r\n    notions of the American people, on the score of economy; nor is it\r\n    in accordance with received opinions in regard to the propriety of\r\n    placing excessive patronage in the hands of the General\r\n    Government. At the same time, it is in perfect unison with the\r\n    spirit of our free institutions that the arts of peace shall be\r\n    made tributary to the purposes of defense, and the same energies\r\n    which extend the commerce and manufactures of our country shall,\r\n    in the event of necessity, be capable of being made use of for our\r\n    protection. While the crowned heads of the Old World keep in\r\n    constant pay vast armies and navies sustained by the heart's blood\r\n    of the oppressed people, for the protection and preservation of\r\n    their unhallowed power, it is the proud boast of our country that\r\n    our soldiers are our citizens, and the sailors, who, in time of\r\n    peace, spread the canvas of our commercial marine throughout the\r\n    world, are the men who, in time of war, have heretofore directed,\r\n    and will continue to direct, our cannon against our foes.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The simple fact that the ships employed in it [the mail service]\r\n    _may hereafter, if the Government thinks proper_, be purchased and\r\n    commissioned as regular war steamers, to be officered and manned\r\n    as ships of war, should not and can not prevent the construction\r\n    of steam or sailing vessels for ordinary naval purposes. Your\r\n    Committee are of opinion that, so far from being an impediment to\r\n    the proper increase of the Navy, the prosperity of the ocean steam\r\n    packet service must operate in favor of an enlargement of the\r\n    naval force, the necessity for which is increased in proportion to\r\n    the extension of our commercial relations with foreign countries.\r\n    The routes upon which lines of steam packets can be sustained and\r\n    made profitable to the owners are comparatively few, when we take\r\n    into view the infinitely diversified ramifications of trade. Great\r\n    Britain, with her vast colonial and general commerce, had, in\r\n    1848, but fifteen lines in which national or contract vessels were\r\n    employed, including the home stations, as they are called, or\r\n    points of connection between the British islands. Nor has the\r\n    ocean steam packet system hindered, in the slightest degree, her\r\n    progress in the construction of steam or sailing vessels for the\r\n    naval service. In speaking of steam vessels available for naval\r\n    service, Captain W. H. Hall, of the British Navy, in the course of\r\n    his examination before the special Committee of the House of\r\n    Commons, hereinbefore referred to, says: 'I some time ago sent to\r\n    the Admiralty a plan for making the whole of the merchant steamers\r\n    available in case of need; and if there were an Act of Parliament\r\n    that these ships should be strengthened forward and aft to carry\r\n    guns, it might be then done with a very trifling expense; that\r\n    would give this country more power than any other country in the\r\n    world. We have nearly one thousand steam vessels, half of which,\r\n    at least, might be made available in case Government required\r\n    their services. Our mercantile steamers are some of the finest in\r\n    the world, and five hundred of them might be turned to account.\r\n    They should all be numbered and classed, so that Government would\r\n    merely have to ask for the number of vessels they wanted, when\r\n    they might go to Woolwich, or other places, and put the guns on\r\n    board, and then they would be ready for service.'\r\n\r\n    \"Here is the opinion of a _captain in the British Navy_ with\r\n    reference to the availability of steam vessels for national\r\n    defense; and what a lesson does it teach to us in America, where\r\n    steam navigation is found penetrating every portion of the Union,\r\n    and spreading itself on our maritime and lake frontier in every\r\n    direction! Here is found no expression of apprehension lest the\r\n    mercantile steamers might interfere with the growth or efficiency\r\n    of the Navy to which the witness belonged. This opinion, moreover,\r\n    is expressed in a country where, according to the testimony before\r\n    the Committee already named, there were, in 1848, 174 _war\r\n    steamers, with an aggregate horse-power of_ 44,480 _horses_; and\r\n    where Mr. Alexander Gordon states, in a letter addressed to the\r\n    same Committee, the Steam Navy had then cost the country\r\n    L6,000,000 sterling, or $30,000,000, '_exclusive of all\r\n    reinstatements and expenses during commission_;' the same\r\n    gentleman also alleging that the annual repairs amounted\r\n    to                                              L108,000\r\n    Annual cost for coals,                           110,000\r\n    Depreciation at a moderate allowance,            600,000\r\n                                                   ---------\r\n        Making the total amount of annual cost,     L818,000\r\n        Or                                        $4,094,000\r\n                                                 ===========\r\n\r\n    \"The regular employment of the best engineers on board of contract\r\n    vessels, and the great experience they would acquire from being\r\n    constantly on active duty, would furnish to the naval service, in\r\n    the event of a war, a corps that would be invaluable. In speaking\r\n    of the superiority of the engineers on board of contract vessels\r\n    in the employ of the British Government over those on board of the\r\n    Queen's ships, a witness before the select Committee of the House\r\n    of Commons says: 'Last year there was a universal complaint of the\r\n    inferiority of the engineers and all persons connected with steam\r\n    employed in her Majesty's service. It was explained, and very\r\n    easily explained, by the superior advantages in the merchant\r\n    service, and particularly the high wages paid. In all contract\r\n    steam packets, they have men on board the vessels who are\r\n    competent to superintend any alterations or repairs in the\r\n    machinery which may be required.'\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Graham said on this subject to the Senate Committee, 20\r\nMarch, 1853:\r\n\r\n    \"While their discussions [mail steamers] justify the conclusion\r\n    that vessels of this description can not be relied on to supersede\r\n    those modelled and built only for purposes of war, it is\r\n    respectfully suggested that a limited number of them, employed in\r\n    time of peace in the transportation of the mails, would be found a\r\n    most useful resource of the Government on the breaking out of war.\r\n\r\n    \"If conforming to the standards required by these contracts, their\r\n    readiness to be used at the shortest notice, their capacity as\r\n    transports for troops and munitions of war, and their great\r\n    celerity of motion, enabling them to overhaul merchantmen, and at\r\n    the same time escape cruisers, would render them terrible as\r\n    guerrillas of the ocean, if fitted with such armaments as could be\r\n    readily put upon them in their present condition.\"\r\n\r\nPost Master General Collamer also said on this subject, June 27, 1850:\r\n\r\n    \"There are three modes which have been mentioned of transporting\r\n    the mail. The first is by naval steamships, conducted by the Navy,\r\n    as a national service. This will occasion so enormous an expense\r\n    that it is not probable the project will be entertained.\r\n\r\n    \"The next mode suggested is the sending the mails, from time to\r\n    time, by the fastest steamers which are first going. This has one\r\n    advantage: it gives occasional aid to the enterprising; but there\r\n    are many and great objections to it:\r\n\r\n    \"1st. It is entirely inconsistent with fixed periods of departure\r\n    and arrival.\r\n\r\n    \"2d. It makes all connections on or with the route uncertain.\r\n\r\n    \"3d. A price must be fixed, to prevent undue exactions of the\r\n    Government; and yet no one would be under obligation to take the\r\n    mail at the price, so that it would be uncertain of going at all.\r\n\r\n    \"4th. It would be impracticable to send agents with all those\r\n    mails, to take care of them and make distributions, except at an\r\n    enormous cost.\r\n\r\n    \"5th. There would be constant difficulty with slow and unsafe\r\n    boats.\r\n\r\n    \"6th. The great object of obtaining steamships, so constructed,\r\n    under the inspection of the Navy Department, as to be suitable for\r\n    war vessels, and subject to exclusive appropriation and use as\r\n    such, would be sacrificed.\r\n\r\n    \"The third project is the making of contracts, for a stated term\r\n    of years, _upon proposals advertised for in the ordinary method\r\n    adopted for mail-coach service_. This would not answer for ocean\r\n    steam service, unless provision were made for security, in the\r\n    strength, capacity, and adaptation of the vessels, with their\r\n    machinery, etc.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding our steam service in the Gulf, and in reviewing the contract\r\nmade by the United States Mail Steamship Company, the Hon. Edwin\r\nCroswell, and associates, in a letter to the Chairman of the Senate\r\nPostal Committee, presented the following important reflections:\r\n\r\n    \"As early as the year 1835, the attention of the British\r\n    Government was directed to the plan of changing the mode of\r\n    conveying the mails by the ships of the East-India Company and the\r\n    Government, and adopting the contract system with individuals and\r\n    companies, with a view to combining the essential properties of a\r\n    naval and commercial steam marine.\r\n\r\n    \"In consequence of the Report of the Commissioners appointed by\r\n    Parliament to inquire into the management of the English Post\r\n    Office Department in 1836, the mail steam packet service was\r\n    transferred to the Admiralty. The Report stated the conviction of\r\n    the Commissioners of Inquiry that 'the advantages which a System\r\n    of contract must generally secure to the public over one of the\r\n    establishment, however well conducted, were such that they wish\r\n    they could have felt justified in recommending that it should be\r\n    universally and immediately adopted.'\r\n\r\n    \"The Secretary of the Admiralty stated that, 'in acting upon this\r\n    opinion, the Admiralty entered into contracts for conveying the\r\n    mails by steam vessels to and from Spain and Portugal, and\r\n    subsequently between Alexandria and England, with the Peninsular\r\n    and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Contracts were also entered\r\n    into for the conveyance of the mails between England and\r\n    North-America, and England and the West-Indies and Mexico.' That\r\n    'the execution of all these contracts, with the exception of the\r\n    latter, had given general satisfaction. But for this exception,\r\n    the extent and complication of the plan at its commencement\r\n    afforded some apology.' That 'the spirit in which the steam\r\n    contractors had generally executed their contracts merited notice,\r\n    as they had in almost every instance exceeded the horse-power\r\n    stipulated in their agreements, and thus insured an accuracy in\r\n    the delivery of mails which experience has shown, if the letter of\r\n    the contract had been adhered to by them, would not have been the\r\n    case.' And that 'the contract system had been generally\r\n    satisfactory to the Admiralty and the public, and had tended\r\n    largely to increase the steam tonnage of this country, (England,)\r\n    to encourage private enterprise in scientific discovery, and the\r\n    regulation and economical management of steam.'\r\n\r\n    \"Such, certainly, were among the valuable results of the system;\r\n    but these were not the only considerations that led to its\r\n    adoption. The English Government, with the forecast for which that\r\n    far-reaching power is distinguished, saw the advantages which an\r\n    extended steam marine would give to its commerce over that of\r\n    every other nation in the world. It saw also the value of\r\n    connecting this great branch of the national service with the\r\n    commercial and practical skill of the country. It soon formed and\r\n    matured its plan, embracing within its scope nearly the entire\r\n    commercial world. Steam lines, as stated in the preceding extract\r\n    from the Admiralty Report, were established, radiating from\r\n    England to all the prominent European ports, to the Mediterranean,\r\n    to Egypt, the East-Indies and China, the West-India Islands,\r\n    South-America and Mexico, the ports in the Gulf of Mexico and\r\n    Havana, the United States and the English colonial possessions in\r\n    North-America, and to the islands and ports in the Pacific ocean.\r\n    This vast chain of intercourse was not only completely\r\n    established, but it became a matter of national policy to enlarge,\r\n    strengthen, and maintain it. By it much of the commerce of the\r\n    world by steam, and nearly all the letter-carrying by steam\r\n    between this continent and the European ports, and even the\r\n    distant parts of our own territory, were engrossed by British\r\n    ships.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Important national considerations, aside from the design to\r\n    engross for British bottoms and British capital the trade and\r\n    intercourse of the commercial world, and especially with the\r\n    American continent and islands, entered into the Government plan.\r\n    It was ascertained to be a far less expensive mode of maintaining\r\n    a naval steam force adapted to the purposes of Government, and to\r\n    any emergency that might require these ships for other than mail\r\n    purposes, than to build, equip, and keep in service national\r\n    steamships of war. The experiment has proved its adequacy to the\r\n    intended object; and it continues not only to receive the approval\r\n    of the Admiralty and Government of England, but to be continually\r\n    undergoing enlargement and expansion.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The West-India mail steam line was proposed to the British\r\n    Government in April, 1839, by sundry merchants of London. A\r\n    charter was granted to the contractors in that year, under the\r\n    title of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. It embraced the\r\n    following routes:\r\n\r\n    \"1. _Outward Atlantic Route._--From Southampton to Madeira,\r\n    Barbados and Grenada--steamer, every 15 days.\r\n\r\n    \"2. _Trinidad Route._--From Grenada to Trinidad and\r\n    Barbados--steamer, every 15 days.\r\n\r\n    \"3. _Demarara Route._--From Grenada to Courland Bay,\r\n    (Tobago)--steamer, every 15 days.\r\n\r\n    \"4. _Northern Islands Route._--From Grenada to St. Vincent, St.\r\n    Lucia, Martinique, Dominique, Guadalupe, Antigua, Montserrat,\r\n    Nevis, St. Kitt's, Tortola, St. Thomas, and St. John's, (Porto\r\n    Rico)--steamer, every 15 days.\r\n\r\n    \"5. _Jamaica and Mexican Route._--From Grenada to Jacmel, (Hayti,)\r\n    Kingston, Havana, Vera Cruz, and Tampico--steamer, every 30 days.\r\n\r\n    \"6. _Jamaica and St. Iago de Cuba Route._--From Grenada to Jacmel,\r\n    Kingston, St. Iago de Cuba, St. Juan's, (Porto Rico,) and St.\r\n    Thomas--steamer, every 30 days.\r\n\r\n    \"7. _Bermuda, Havana, and Jamaica Route._--From St. Thomas to\r\n    Bermuda, Nassau, Havana, Kingston, Jacmel, St. Juan's, and St.\r\n    Thomas--steamer, every 30 days.\r\n\r\n    \"8. _Homeward Fayal Route._--From St. Thomas to\r\n    Southampton--steamer, every 30 days.\r\n\r\n    \"9. _Laguayra Route._--From Grenada to Laguayra, Porto Cabello,\r\n    and St. Thomas--steamer, every 30 days.\r\n\r\n    \"10. _Panama and St. Iago de Cuba Route._--From Kingston (Jamaica)\r\n    to Santa Martha, Carthagena, Chagres, and St. Juan de\r\n    Nicaragua--steamer, every 30 days.\r\n\r\n    \"11. _Honduras Route._--From Havana to Balize, (Honduras)--sailing\r\n    schooner, every 30 days.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The contract system, combining the efficient features of an\r\n    extended commercial and Government steam marine, was thus adopted\r\n    after full investigation on the subject by the Board of Admiralty,\r\n    the Treasury, and the different Government Departments, including\r\n    the Post Master General. The merits and benefits of this system\r\n    have been tested by England. That Government was the first to\r\n    engage in it, and, as we have already stated, fully approve, and\r\n    are constantly extending it. The Committee of Inquiry of\r\n    Parliament, as we have already quoted, say truly that it 'had\r\n    tended largely to increase the steam tonnage of that country, to\r\n    encourage private enterprise in scientific discovery, and the\r\n    regulation and economical management of steam.' After an\r\n    examination of it in the most scientific and practical manner,\r\n    that Government regards it as altogether more economical for the\r\n    nation, and for the general public interests, than the exclusive\r\n    employment of Government vessels. The ships built by the contract\r\n    companies have far exceeded in speed and other essential qualities\r\n    the ships constructed by Government. A far greater amount of\r\n    service was obtained, at a cost much less than would be incurred\r\n    by Government in building, equipping, manning, and running\r\n    national vessels for even a partial performance of the same\r\n    service. Individual and associated skill, enterprise, and capital\r\n    were called into requisition, and, aided by Government means,\r\n    contributed to enlarge, extend, and fortify the naval and\r\n    commercial power of England.\r\n\r\n    \"The practical operation of this great system of steam lines was\r\n    to place within the reach of English vessels, of a semi-national\r\n    character, and ready to be converted into ships of war, our entire\r\n    Southern coast and harbors, besides yielding to them the foreign\r\n    trade, commerce, and letter-carrying, by steam, to and from all\r\n    parts of our country. To meet and counteract this state of things,\r\n    became the object and duty of the American Congress and\r\n    Government. It was the more obvious at that time particularly,\r\n    engaged as we were in a war with Mexico, and our only means of\r\n    coast defense of any force being a single steamer, and she not\r\n    capable of entering the Southern harbors, while English steam\r\n    fleets literally filled and occupied our waters. To counteract, so\r\n    far as was demanded by the requirements of our own commerce, and\r\n    the defense of our coast, a monopoly so formidable, which had\r\n    grown up under the direct and liberal cooperation of the English\r\n    Government, and the supposed superiority of English machinery,\r\n    required the aid of Congress; for it was evident that unaided\r\n    American enterprise and capital could not cope with it.\r\n    Accordingly, at the close of the session of 1847, the Congress of\r\n    the United States passed an act authorizing the Secretary of the\r\n    Navy to contract with sundry parties and different steam lines for\r\n    the construction of ocean steamships, as part of the plan of a\r\n    combined naval and commercial steam marine, in connection with the\r\n    mail service.\"\r\n\r\nAfter enumerating the various lines established by Congress, he\r\nfurther says:\r\n\r\n    \"These (with the previously authorized line from New-York to\r\n    Bremen) were the various parts of a complete and important plan\r\n    adapted to the growing wants of the public service, and for\r\n    providing an adequate steam marine, whenever the exigencies of\r\n    the country might require it, and for facilitating intercourse and\r\n    the transmission of the mails between remote parts of our own\r\n    country and other nations. For the due performance of it in all\r\n    its ramifications, it required a large aggregate of capital,\r\n    skill, and intelligent enterprise. After a lapse of nearly three\r\n    years, portions of the undertaking have gone into efficient\r\n    operation; and already the fruits of it--its utility, and its\r\n    advantages and benefits to the American government and\r\n    people--have been demonstrated. When the various parts shall be\r\n    completed, and the plan in all its features shall be in full\r\n    operation, its immediate practical results, aside from its\r\n    prospective effectiveness in furnishing a class of war steamers\r\n    for any ultimate purpose of the American Government, will be found\r\n    fully to justify the action of Congress and the participation and\r\n    favor of the Government, and confirm the public confidence in its\r\n    great utility and value.\"\r\n\r\n    \"When it came to the knowledge of the English government that\r\n    Congress had entered into contracts establishing steam lines to\r\n    Chagres, Havana, and New-Orleans, its first movement to counteract\r\n    or discourage the proposed American line in that direction was to\r\n    run branches of the Royal West-India mail line from Bermuda to\r\n    New-York, and from Jamaica to New-Orleans and Mobile. Now that the\r\n    American line to Chagres has gone into full operation, and the\r\n    news from the Pacific comes by this line to New-York, and thence\r\n    to Liverpool, some fifteen days sooner than the same news brought\r\n    by the British line,[J] the English government has revised,\r\n    enlarged, and extended its West-India line. It has entered into a\r\n    new contract with the Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company, a material\r\n    feature of which is to run a mail line direct from Southampton to\r\n    St. Thomas, and thence to Chagres and back, twice a month, with\r\n    steamers of larger capacity and power, and with a proposed speed\r\n    of from twelve to fourteen miles per hour. For this line, five or\r\n    six new steamships are, under the contract, to be built, while the\r\n    old vessels are to form branches from this main line or trunk to\r\n    other of the routes of this great and extended plan of steam\r\n    intercourse and letter-carrying; at the same time that government\r\n    will withdraw its branches to the Balize, Mobile, and New-York,\r\n    extend its line to Rio de Janeiro, and enlarge its line in the\r\n    Pacific, from Panama to Valparaiso, converting it from a monthly\r\n    to a semi-monthly route. These movements show not only the\r\n    immediate results of American enterprise in ocean steamships, and\r\n    the important consequences, aside from any purposes of coast and\r\n    harbor defense, to which it has already led, but the strong public\r\n    reasons on the part of our Government to foster, continue, and\r\n    encourage it. It has already counteracted the best efforts of the\r\n    large and long-established English steam lines, and transferred\r\n    the commerce and letter-carrying so long exclusively enjoyed by\r\n    them to American ships. If promoted and favored by the Congress of\r\n    the United States, it will still meet and counteract the new\r\n    efforts of the English Government to recover the ground which\r\n    American skill, enterprise, and capital, aided by the Government,\r\n    have won from them.\r\n\r\n    [J] \"By the contract of 1846 with the West-India Royal Mail\r\n    Steam-Packet Company, the voyage from Chagres to Southampton is\r\n    performed in 33 days. By the United States Mail Steamship Company\r\n    the voyage from Chagres to New-York, and thence to Liverpool, is\r\n    performed in 22 days.\r\n\r\n    \"In relation to the comparative cost to the two governments by\r\n    which these lines of ocean steamers, in connection with the naval\r\n    and mail service, are maintained, it will be seen that the British\r\n    Government pays as much for its single West-India and Chagres line\r\n    as the American Government pays for all its lines--Liverpool and\r\n    New-York, New-York and Bremen, New-York and Havre, New-York,\r\n    Havana, New-Orleans, and Chagres, and Panama and San Francisco.\r\n    The entire annual payments by the British Government amount [This\r\n    was in 1850.--T.R.] to $3,180,000. Those by the American\r\n    Government, when all its lines shall be in full service, will be\r\n    $1,215,000. The British-West India Mail Steam-Packet Company are\r\n    paid $3.08 per mile for mail service: the United States Mail\r\n    Steamship Company, $1.88 per mile.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee presented some few queries to Commodore M.C. Perry on\r\nthe capabilities of the postal steamers for war purposes, to which he\r\nreplies thus:\r\n\r\n    \"I now proceed to reply to the first division of the inquiry, as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Question first: 'Whether the steamships employed in the\r\n    transportation of the United States mail, under contract with the\r\n    Navy Department, or any other steamships employed in the\r\n    transportation of our foreign mails, are, in all respects,\r\n    suitable for immediate conversion into steamers for war purposes,\r\n    capable of carrying the armament or battery appropriate to the\r\n    class specified in the contract?'\r\n\r\n    \"In answer to the foregoing (first) question, I am of opinion that\r\n    they are _not_ 'in all respects suitable.'\r\n\r\n    \"Question second: 'And if not suitable for such immediate\r\n    conversion, whether they could be altered so as to make them\r\n    efficient war steamers?'\r\n\r\n    \"Answer: The following named Atlantic steamers maybe converted, by\r\n    slight alteration, into war steamers of the first class:\r\n\r\n    \"_Of Collins's line._ The Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, and Baltic.\r\n\r\n    \"_Of Law's line._ The Ohio, Georgia, and Illinois.\r\n\r\n    \"_Of Mortimer Livingston's line._ The Humboldt and Franklin.\r\n\r\n    \"_Pacific steamers--of Aspinwall's line._ First class, the Golden\r\n    Gate. Second class, the Panama, Oregon, California, and Columbia.\r\n\r\n    \"The foregoing vessels of the respective contracts are variously\r\n    constructed as to materials, fastening, strength, and model.\r\n\r\n    \"Question third: 'And if so, what alterations would be necessary\r\n    to be made, and at what expense, to make them war steamers of the\r\n    first class:'\r\n\r\n    \"Answer: If these vessels had been originally constructed\r\n    comformably to the _spirit_ (though it was not called for by the\r\n    letter) of the contracts, as they should have been, and all\r\n    English mail steamers now are, _in anticipation of their possible\r\n    conversion, into war vessels_, the cost of converting them would\r\n    be much less.\r\n\r\n    \"Most of them were completed before I was ordered to their\r\n    supervision; but I lost no time, after entering upon the duty, in\r\n    calling the attention of the contractors to this important\r\n    consideration, an observance of which would not have added more\r\n    than one per cent upon the cost of construction.\r\n\r\n    \"In altering these vessels so as to make them available for war\r\n    purposes, the most simple, expeditious, and economical plan would\r\n    be to razee them, or cut off their upper decks and cabins forward\r\n    and abaft the wheel-houses; not by tearing them to pieces and\r\n    defacing the costly ornamental work, which, though of no value to\r\n    the Government, still need not be destroyed.\r\n\r\n    \"The razeeing should be effected by sawing the top timbers, and\r\n    cutting off by sections the whole of the upper dock, excepting the\r\n    space between the wheel-houses, thus leaving the greater part of\r\n    the main deck exposed and for the accommodation of the armament,\r\n    and enough of the sides above that deck to answer for bulwarks and\r\n    side-ports.\r\n\r\n    \"Below, it would only be necessary to remove the state-rooms not\r\n    wanted for the accommodation of the officers, and convert the\r\n    after-hold and fore and main orlops into magazines, store-rooms,\r\n    shot and shell lockers, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    \"According to my calculation, the cost of the conversion of either\r\n    of the before mentioned vessels, exclusive of armaments, repair of\r\n    machinery and ordinary repair, would not, or certainly _ought_\r\n    not, exceed, for steamers of the first class, $20,000, and for\r\n    those of the second class, $15,000; and it could be readily done\r\n    for this at any of our navy yards, provided that _useless_\r\n    alterations were not made.\r\n\r\n    \"It should be taken into view that those mail steamers, if called\r\n    into service as war vessels, would be considered as forming an\r\n    auxiliary force to the regularly constructed ships, and hence the\r\n    impolicy of expending much money on them. The requisites of sound\r\n    hulls and powerful engines, with efficient armaments, should\r\n    alone be considered, leaving superfluous ornament out of the\r\n    question.\r\n\r\n    \"The armaments of the respective vessels would, of course, be a\r\n    separate cost; and to arrange the guns on the upper deck, it would\r\n    only be required to close up three or four of the hatches or\r\n    sky-lights; to strengthen the deck by additional beams and\r\n    stanchions; to cut ports, and construct the pivot and other\r\n    carriages; probably it might be desirable to shift the capstan and\r\n    cables.\r\n\r\n    \"With respect to the description and weight of the respective\r\n    armaments, I am clearly of opinion that the first-class steamers\r\n    already named could easily carry each _four_ 10-inch Paixhan guns\r\n    on pivots, two forward and two aft, of the weight of those in the\r\n    Mississippi; _ten_ 8-inch Paixhans, as side-guns, ditto.\r\n\r\n    \"The _second-class_ steamers could with equal ease carry each\r\n    _two_ 8-inch Paixhans on pivots, one forward and one aft, and\r\n    _six_ 6-inch ditto, as side-guns.\r\n\r\n    \"With the additional strengthening recommended, I am perfectly\r\n    satisfied that the armaments suggested would not, in the least,\r\n    incommode the vessels. Indeed, the weight of armament would be\r\n    actually less than that which would be taken away by the removal\r\n    of the upper decks and cabins, and the miscellaneous articles\r\n    usually stowed on one or the other of two decks--such, for\r\n    instance, as ice, of which not less than forty tons is generally\r\n    packed in one mass; nor would the munitions and provisions\r\n    required for the war vessel be of greater weight than the goods\r\n    now carried as freight, saying nothing of the provisions and\r\n    stores carried by the steamers for an average of 150 to 250 souls,\r\n    including crew and passengers.\r\n\r\n    \"It may again be remarked, that steamers thus brought into service\r\n    would be far inferior to regularly constructed and appointed war\r\n    vessels; yet in the general operations of a maritime war, they\r\n    would render good service, and especially would they be useful,\r\n    from their great speed, as dispatch vessels, and for the\r\n    transportation of troops, always being capable of attack and\r\n    defense, and of overhauling or escaping from an enemy.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Skiddy, the Special Naval Constructor appointed by the\r\nGovernment to superintend the building of all the mail packets, says\r\nin a letter to Com. Perry:\r\n\r\n    \"In reply I will commence with the first-class ships, which are\r\n    the 'Atlantic,' 'Pacific,' 'Baltic,' and 'Arctic,' of Collins'\r\n    Liverpool line; the 'Franklin' and 'Humboldt' of Mortimer\r\n    Livingston's Havre line.\r\n\r\n    \"These ships, although equal in strength, probably, to any\r\n    steamships afloat, are not suitable for _immediate_ war purposes,\r\n    but can be made efficient in four or six weeks, capable of\r\n    carrying the armament or battery of a first-class frigate--say\r\n    four ten-inch guns and twelve eight-inch guns. These alterations\r\n    would consist of a removal of the deck-houses, spar or upper deck,\r\n    forward and abaft the paddle-wheel boxes, fitting the after and\r\n    forward bulwarks in sections, cutting port-holes, fitting hammock\r\n    cloths or nettings, putting in extra beams and knees, and\r\n    stanchions, moving the windlass below, building magazines,\r\n    shell-rooms, officers' rooms, etc., etc. The cost of all these\r\n    alterations and fixtures would not exceed ($15,000 or $20,000)\r\n    twenty thousand dollars each ship. These ships would then be\r\n    relieved of about one hundred and fifty tons weight, or nearly\r\n    double the weight of guns and carriages, with less resistance to\r\n    water and wind, adding an increase to their already great speed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of all these steamers, that is, of the Havre and Bremen,\r\nthe Collins, the Aspinwall, and the Pacific lines, Commodore Perry\r\nreported that they \"_were capable of being easily converted into war\r\nsteamers of the first class_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER F.\r\n\r\nOCEAN STEAM LINES OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n ------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+--------\r\n LINE.                         |SERVICE.                        |Ships.|Tonnage.\r\n ------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+--------\r\n Cunard, Paddle-wheel,         |Liverpool, New-York, Boston, and|     8|  12,000\r\n                               |Halifax,                        |      |\r\n    \"    Screw,                |    \"         \"        \"      \" |     4|   4,800\r\n North Atlantic Steamship Co., |St. John's and Portland,        |     3|   4,800\r\n European and American S.
