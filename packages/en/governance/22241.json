Only a few thousand people can get into a convention. A\r\nhundred million can get into a book. All in the same two hours, by\r\ntwenty million lamps thousands of miles apart, the people can crowd\r\ninto a book.\r\n\r\nSo in this book, as I have said, I am merely acting as the secretary or\r\nemployee of the hundred million people. I am writing a book a hundred\r\nmillion people would write if they could, expressing for them the kind\r\nof President for the next four years of our nation--the most colossal\r\nfour years of the world, the people have ordered in their hearts.\r\n\r\nWe are weary of politicians' politicians. We want ours. Politicians may\r\nnot be so bad but during the war they do not seem to us to have done as\r\nwell as most people. In the dead-earnest of the war, with our Liberty\r\nLoan and Red Cross and Council of Defense, and our dollar a year men we\r\nhave half taken over the government ourselves and we feel no longer awed\r\nby the regular political practitioners or government tinkerers. They are\r\nnot all alike, of course, but we have turned our national glass on them\r\nand have come to see through them--at least the worst ones and many\r\nthousands of them--all these busy little worms of public diplomacy\r\nbuilding their faint vague little coral islands of bluff and unbelief\r\nfar far away from us, out in the great ocean of their nothingness all by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nUnless the more common run of our typical politicians see through\r\nthemselves before the conventions come, and see that the people see\r\nthrough them, and see it quick, their days are numbered.\r\n\r\nInstead of patronizing us and whispering to one another behind their\r\nhands about us, their time has come now--in picking out the next\r\nPresident to begin gazing up to the countenance of the people, to begin\r\nlistening to the people's prayer to God.\r\n\r\nThe people are a new people since the war. Out of the crash of empires,\r\nout of threats in every man's door-yard the people are praying to God.\r\n\r\nAnd they are voting to God, too.\r\n\r\nThe sooner the two great political parties reckon with this, the sooner\r\nthey push around behind themselves out of sight all the funny little\r\nwould-be Presidents, and all the little shan't-be politicians running\r\naround like ants under the high heaven of the faith of a great people\r\npicking up tidbits they dare to believe--and put forward instead a live\r\nbelieving hot and cold human being, a man who will give up being\r\nPresident for what he believes, the sooner they will find themselves\r\nwith a President on their hands that can be elected. Whichever party it\r\nis that does this, and does it first and does it best, will be the one\r\nthat will be underwritten by the people.\r\n\r\nThe people of this country are to-day in a religious mood toward the\r\ngreat coming political conventions and the questions and the men that\r\nwill come up in them. We are on the whole, in spite of the low estimate\r\nthe majority of politicians have of us, straight-minded and free-hearted\r\npeople, shrewd, masterful and devout, praying with one hand and keeping\r\nfrom being fooled with the other and we want our public men to have\r\ncourage and vision for themselves and for us. We give notice that\r\nthousands of our most complacently puttering, most quibbly and fuddly\r\npoliticians are going to be taken out by the people, lifted up by the\r\npeople, and dropped kindly but firmly over the edge of the world. This\r\nnation is facing the most colossal, most serious and godlike moment any\r\nnation has ever faced, and it does not propose in the presence of forty\r\nnations, in the presence of its own conscience, its own grim appalling\r\nhope, to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nSo far as any one can see with the naked eye the quickest and surest way\r\nto get past the politicians, to remind the politicians of the real\r\nspirit of the people, to loom up the face of the people before their\r\neyes and make them suddenly take the people more seriously than they\r\ntake themselves, is with a book. In a book a President can be nominated\r\nby acclamation--by a kind of silent acclamation. In a book, without\r\ngiving any name or pointing anybody out at least the soul of a President\r\ncan be ordered by a people.\r\n\r\nWe will publish upon the housetops the hopes and the prayers and the\r\nwills of the people.\r\n\r\nThen let the conventions feel the housetops looking down on them when\r\nthey meet.\r\n\r\nIn a book published in a hundred newspapers one week, wedged into covers\r\nacross a nation another, the people with one single national stroke can\r\nput what they want before the country--a hundred million people in a\r\nbook can rise to make a motion.\r\n\r\nWe will not wait to be cornered by our politicians into a convention to\r\nwhich we cannot go. We will not wait to be told three months too late,\r\nto pick out--out of two men we did not want, the man we will have to\r\ntake. The short-cut way for us as the people of this country to take the\r\ninitiative with our politicians and to make the politicians toe our\r\nline, instead of toeing theirs, is for the people to blurt out the\r\ntruth, write a book, get in early beforehand their quiet word with both\r\ngreat parties and tell them whatever his name is, whatever his party is,\r\nthe kind of President they want.\r\n\r\nSo here it is, such as it is, the book, a little politically\r\ninnocent-looking thing perhaps, just engaged in being like folks instead\r\nof like politicians, just engaged in being human--in letting a nation\r\nspeak and act as a human being speaks and acts, in a great simple\r\nsublime human crisis in which with forty nations looking on, we are\r\nmaking democracy work--making a loophole for the fate of the world.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nI am trying to answer three questions.\r\n\r\nWhat shall the new President believe about the people and expect of the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nWhat shall the new people--people made new by this war, expect of\r\nthemselves and expect of their new President?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a President, with what kind of a personality or temperament\r\ndo the people feel would be the best kind of a President to pull them\r\ntogether, to help the people do what the people have to do?\r\n\r\nI have wanted to bring forward a way in which the things the new President\r\nwill expect the people to do, can be done by the people.\r\n\r\nWhat the people want done, especially with regard to the Red Flag,\r\npredatory capital, predatory labor, and the fifty-cent dollar cannot\r\nbe done by the President for them, and they are not going to do it\r\nthemselves lonesomely and individually by yearning, or by standing\r\naround three thousand miles apart or in any other way than by\r\nvoluntarily agreeing to get together and do it together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nWHAT THE PEOPLE EXPECT OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGIST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crowd is my Hero.\r\n\r\nThe Hero of this book is a hundred million people.\r\n\r\nI have come to have the feeling--especially in regard to political\r\nconventions, that it might not be amiss to put forward some suggestions\r\njust now as to how a hundred million people can strike--make themselves\r\nmore substantial, more important in this country, so that we shall really\r\nhave in this country in time a hundred million people who, taken as a\r\nwhole, feel important in it--like a Senator for instance--like Senator\r\nLodge, like sugar even, or like meat or like oil, like Trusts that won't\r\ntrust, and Congressmen that won't play and workmen that won't work--I am\r\nthinking out ways in this book in which the hundred million people can\r\ncome to feel as if it made a very substantial difference to somebody what\r\nthey wanted and what they thought--ways in which the hundred million\r\npeople shall be taken seriously in their own country, and like a\r\nProfiteer, or like a noble agitator, or like a free beautiful labor\r\nunion,--get what they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE LONESOMEST JOB ON EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is going to happen to the next President the day after he is\r\ninaugurated, a few minutes after it, when he goes to the place assigned\r\nto him, or at least that night?\r\n\r\nThe Ghost in the White House.\r\n\r\nThe White House is haunted by a vague, helpless abstraction, a kind of\r\nghost of a nation, called the people.\r\n\r\nThe only way the Nation, in the White House, gets in, is as a spirit. The\r\nman who lives there, if he wants to be chummy (as any man we want there\r\nwould), has to commune with a Generalization.\r\n\r\nWhat we really do with a President is to pick him deliberately up out of\r\nhis warm human living with the rest of us, with people who, whatever else\r\nis the matter with them, are at least somebody in particular, lift him\r\nover in the White House, shut him up there for four years to live in\r\nwedlock with An Average, to be the consort day and night of Her Who Never\r\nWas, and Who Never Is--a kind of vague, cold, intellectual, unsubstantial,\r\nlonely, Terrible Angel called the People.\r\n\r\nJust a kind of light in Her eyes at times.\r\n\r\nThat is all there is to Her.\r\n\r\nIt is a good deal like reducing or trying to reduce the Aurora Borealis\r\nto 2 and 2 = 4, to go into the White House for four years, warm up to\r\nthis cold, passionately talked about, passionately believed in Lady. It\r\ndoes not give any real satisfaction to anybody--either to the hundred\r\nmillion people or to the President.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is not a pleasant or thoughtful thing for a hundred million\r\npeople to do to a President--to be a Ghost.\r\n\r\nIt is not efficient.\r\n\r\nNaturally--much of the time anyway, all the Ghost of a people can get or\r\nhope to get (however hard he tries) is the Ghost of a President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT AND THE GHOST\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things about going into the White House the next\r\nfour years and being the Head Employee of a hundred million people, that\r\nare going to make it, unless people do something about it, the lonesomest\r\njob on earth.\r\n\r\nThe new President on entering the mansion and taking up his position as\r\nthe Head Employee of the hundred million people is going to find he is\r\nexpected to put up, and put up every day, with marked and embarrassing\r\nidiosyncrasies or personal traits in his Employer, that no man would ever\r\nput up with, from any other employer in the world.\r\n\r\nAbsent-mindedness.\r\n\r\nNon-committalness.\r\n\r\nHalfness, or double personality.\r\n\r\nBodilessness.\r\n\r\nBig, impressive-looking Fool Moments.\r\n\r\nCumulus clouds of Slow Sure Conceit with Sudden Flops of Humility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Irresponsibleness.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps most trying of all in being the employee of a hundred million\r\npeople, is the almost daily sense that the employee has that the\r\nEmployer--like some strange, kindly, big Innocent, is going to be made a\r\nfool of before one's eyes and do things and be made to do things by\r\nunworthy and designing persons for which he is going to be sorry.\r\n\r\nThe man who is conscientious in the White House has an Employer whose\r\nimmediate and temporary orders he must disobey to his face, sometimes in\r\nthe hope that he will be thanked afterwards.\r\n\r\nOnce in a great while the man who has been put on the job as the expert,\r\nas the captain of the ship, has to tell the Owner of the Line, when the\r\nstorm is highest, that he must not butt in.\r\n\r\nThe restful and homelike feeling one has with the average employer that\r\none is just being an employee and that one's employer is being\r\nresponsible, is lacking in the White House, where one is practically\r\nexpected to undertake at the same time being both one's own employee and\r\none's own employer.\r\n\r\nBut while this little trait of general irresponsibleness in the\r\nPresident's Employer may be the hardest to bear, there are more dangerous\r\nones for the country.\r\n\r\nI am dwelling on them long enough to consider what can be done about\r\nthem. I have believed they are going to be removed or mitigated the\r\nmoment the Employer can be got to see how hard some of the traits are\r\nmaking it for the President to do anything for him.\r\n\r\nBodilessness is the worst. The man to whom the hundred million people are\r\ngiving for the next four years the job of being their Head Employee, is\r\nnot only never going to see his Employer, but he has an Employer so\r\nlarge, so various, so amorphous, so mixed together and so scattered apart\r\nhe could never hope in a thousand years to get in touch with It.\r\n\r\nServing It is necessarily one long monstrous strain of guesswork, a\r\ntrying daily, nightly, for four years to get into grip with a mist, with\r\na fog of human nature, an Abstraction, a ghost of a nation called the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nIt is this bodilessness in the Employer--this very simple rudimentary\r\nwhiffling communion the Employer has with his usually distinguished and\r\naccomplished Head Employee, which the Head Employee finds it hardest to\r\nbear. The only thing his Employer ever says to him directly is (once in\r\nfour years) that he wants him or that he does not want him and even then\r\nhe confides to him that he only half wants him. He says deliberately and\r\nout loud before everybody, so that everybody knows and the people of\r\nother nations, \"Here is the man I would a little rather have than not.\"\r\nThat is all. Then he coops him up in the White House, drops away\r\nabsently, softly into ten thousand cities, forgets him, and sets him to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAny man can see for himself, that having a crowd for an Employer like\r\nthis, a crowd of a hundred million people you cannot go to and that\r\ncannot come to you, puts one in a very vague, lonesome position, and when\r\none thinks that on top of all this about forty or fifty millions of the\r\npeople one is being The Head Employee of (in the other party) expect one\r\nto feel and really want one to feel lonesome with them, and that at the\r\nutmost all one can do, or ever hope to do is to about half-suit one's\r\nEmployer--keep up a fair working balance with him in one's favor, it will\r\nbe small wonder if the man in the White House feels he has--especially\r\nthese next most trying four years, the lonesomest job on earth.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister of England has a lonesome job of course, but he is the\r\nhead of his own party, has and knows he has all the while his own special\r\ncrowd, he is allowed and expected, as a matter of course, to snuggle up\r\nto. This special and understood chumminess is not allowed to our\r\nPresident. He has to drub along all day, day in and day out, sternly, and\r\nbe President of all of us.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that it has not always looked like the lonesomest job on\r\nearth and, of course, when Theodore Roosevelt had it, the job of being\r\nPresident considerably chirked up, but in the new never-can-tell world\r\nAmerica is trying to be a great nation in now, the next four years of our\r\nnext President, between not making mistakes with a hundred unhappy,\r\nsenile, tubercular railroads and two hundred thousand sick and unhappy\r\nfactories at home, and not making mistakes with forty desperate nations\r\nabroad, the man we put in the White House next is going to have what will\r\nbe the lonesomest job this old earth has had on it, for four thousand\r\nyears--except the one that began in Nazareth--the one the new President\r\nis going to have a chance to help and to move along in a way which\r\nlittle, old, queer, bent, eager St. Paul with his prayers in Rome and his\r\nsermons in Athens, never dreamed of.\r\n\r\nIt does seem, somehow, with this next particular thing our new President\r\nand a hundred million people and forty nations are all together going to\r\ntry to do, as if it were rather unpractical and inefficient at just this\r\ntime for our President to have a ghost for an Employer.\r\n\r\nAll any man has to do to see how inefficient this tends to make a\r\nPresident, is to stop and think. If you have an employer who cannot\r\ncollect himself and you cannot collect him, if all day, every day, all\r\nyou do before you do anything for him is to guess on him and make him\r\nup--what is there--what deep, searching and conclusive and permanent\r\naction is there, after all, the man in The White House can take in his\r\nemployer's behalf when his employer has no physical means of telling him\r\nwhat he wants and what he is willing to do with what he gets? What can\r\nthe man in the White House hope to accomplish for a people with whom it\r\nis the constitutional and regular thing to be as lonely as this?\r\n\r\nI have wanted to consider what can be done, and done now not to have a\r\nlonely President the next four years.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to pick out in the next conventions and the next\r\nelection a man for the White House a great-hearted direct and free people\r\nwill not feel lonely with, and then set to work hard doing things that\r\nwill back him up, that will make him daily feel where we stand, and not\r\nlet him feel lonely with us.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of helplessness, of bodilessness--the feeling the Public has\r\nevery day in the White House and in the Senate, of being treated, and\r\ntreated to its own face as if it was not there, is a feeling that works\r\nas badly one way as it does the other.\r\n\r\nThe President does not want a Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe people do not want to be treated as a Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to resent--to expose to everybody as unfair\r\nand untrue and destroy forever the title I have written across the front\r\nof it, \"The Ghost in The White House.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to take its own title back, to put itself out\r\nof date, to make people in a generation wonder what it means to save, to\r\ntry to save a great people in the greatest, most desperate moment of all\r\ntime, with forty nations thundering on our door before the whole world,\r\nfrom being an inarticulate, shimmering, wavering, gibbering Ghost in its\r\nown House.\r\n\r\nThere must be things--broad simple things about Capital and Labor people\r\ncan do and do every day in this country, that will make a President\r\ntimidly stop guessing what they want.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to take as it does now, a genius for a President or a seer\r\nfor a President to know what the people want. A man of genius--a seer, a\r\nman who can read the heart of a nation--especially in politics, comes not\r\nonly not once in four years, but four hundred years and it is highly\r\nunlikely when he does that the Republican Party, or the Democratic Party\r\nin America will know him offhand and give people a chance to have him in\r\nthe White House.\r\n\r\nThe best the people can hope for in America now is to have a body--to\r\nfind some way to express ourselves in our daily workaday actions without\r\nsaying a word--express ourselves so plainly that without saying a word\r\nour President, our Politicians--even the kind of men who seem to put up\r\nnaturally with having to be in the Senate--the kind of men who can feel\r\nhappy and in their element in a place like Congress will see what the\r\nPeople--the real people in this country are like.\r\n\r\nI am trying to put forward ways of forming body-tissues for a people so\r\nthat we the people in America, at last, in the days that lie ahead,\r\ninstead of being a Ghost in our own House, shall have things that we can\r\ndo, material, business things that we can do, so that we shall be able to\r\nprove to a President what we are like and what we want--so that each man\r\nof us shall feel he has something tangible he can make an impression on a\r\nPresident with--something more than a vague, faint, little ballot to hurl\r\n(like an Autumn leaf) at him, once in four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nREAL FOLKS AND THE GHOST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man speaks of The City National Bank he speaks of it as if he\r\nmeant something and knew what he meant.\r\n\r\nWhen the same man in the same breath speaks of The People, watch him\r\nbewhiffle it.\r\n\r\nWhen a good hearty sensible fellow human being we all know speaks of\r\nBusiness he speaks of it in a substantial tone, with some burr in it, and\r\nwhen in the same half minute he speaks of the Country, he drops in some\r\nmysterious way into a holy tone of unrealness, into a kind of whine of\r\nThe Invisible.\r\n\r\nBusiness talks bass. Patriotism is an AEolian harp.\r\n\r\nDuring the war this was changed. We found ourselves every day treating\r\nAmerica, treating The Country, treating The People as a bodily fact.\r\n\r\nI would like to see what can be done now in the next President's next\r\nfour years, to give America this magnificent sense of a body in peace.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that we have in America a body for Germans, and then wilt down\r\nin a minute after Chateau-Thierry into bodilessness for ourselves, into\r\ntreating and expecting everybody else to treat The People, the will, the\r\nvision, the glory, the destiny of The People as a Ghost--unholy,\r\ncowardly, voiceless, helpless--just a light in its eyes--just a vast\r\nnational shimmer at a world, without hands and without feet.\r\n\r\nMillions of people every day in this country are very particular to\r\nsalute the flag, sing the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" and ship Bolshevists,\r\nbut let them speak to you in conversation, of an industrial body like the\r\nSteel Trust or the Pennsylvania Railroad and they act as if something\r\nwere there. Bring up the Body-Politic and it's a whiff.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be considered treason to think or to speak of The Country in\r\nthis vague, breathy way.\r\n\r\nThe next immediate, imperative need of America is to see what can be done\r\nand done in the next President's next four years to make the Body-Politic\r\npeople take the Body-Politic and what happens to the Body-Politic as if\r\nit were as substantial as a coal strike--as what happened at Ypres,\r\nCambrai and Chateau-Thierry.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we are a nation of whiners and yearners and are not what we\r\npretend to be at all, and the only logical thing the Germans and the rest\r\nof the world can do, is to protect themselves from democracy.\r\n\r\nI believe that the best things the Old World has said about us and hoped\r\nfor us, to the effect that we are a disinterested nation and a nation of\r\nidealists, are true to the American character and real.\r\n\r\nBut they are not actual. We are the world's colossal tragic Adolescent.\r\nForty nations are depending on us--are waiting for us--in the world's\r\nlong desperate minutes--waiting for America to grow up.\r\n\r\nThis nation has just as much spirituality, just as much patriotism and\r\nreligion as it expresses bodily in its business in the conduct of its\r\ndaily producing, buying and selling, and no more. Any big beautiful\r\nevaporated Body-Politic we have or try to think we can have aside from\r\nthis body--this actual working through of our patriotism, our democracy\r\nand our patriotism into our business, is weak, unholy, unclean and\r\nthreatens in its one desperate and critical moment the fate of a world.\r\n\r\nAll really religious men and all real patriots know this.\r\n\r\nIn a democracy like ours a religion which is not occupied all day every\r\nday in this year of our Lord 1920 in making democracy work, a religion\r\nthat loafs off into a pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night, a\r\nreligion that cannot be used to run steel mills so that men won't go to\r\nhell in them and to run coal mines so that men won't be in hell already,\r\nis not a religion at all. And a nation that sheds tears over three\r\nhundred thousand disabled and crippled soldiers, who gave up their jobs\r\nand sailed six thousand miles to die for them, and that has finally\r\nmanaged to get new jobs for just two hundred and seventeen of the three\r\nhundred thousand and taken nineteen months to do it, illustrates what it\r\nmeans--in just one simple item--for a hundred million people, to try to\r\nbe good without a body.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in behalf of its helplessness with the President I am\r\ngroping in these pages for a body for the Public.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the Public in dealing in its daily business with powerful\r\npersons of any kind--whether good or bad, whether a President or anybody,\r\nis taken advantage of and does not get what it wants, is that the Public\r\nis a Ghost.\r\n\r\nTheoretically all powerful persons, predatory Trusts, profiteering labor\r\nunions and the wrong kind of politicians always speak respectfully to the\r\nPublic, but when they want something that belongs to the Public they find\r\nthe Public is an Abstraction and help themselves. They act when with the\r\nPublic, as if the Public was not there.\r\n\r\nThe only way this is ever going to be stopped is for us to make a\r\nspontaneous voluntary popular start in this country toward having a body\r\nfor people in general, towards giving a hundred million people in dealing\r\nwith their politicians, their trusts and labor unions, less bodilessness.\r\nWe propose to give a hundred million people a face, a voice, a presence,\r\na backbone, a grip.\r\n\r\nThen all the people we ask things of who think we can be whoofed away,\r\nwill pay attention to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE GHOST RECEIVES AN INVITATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing allowed to live a week to-day means as much as being allowed to\r\nlive a whole life four years ago or perhaps four years from now.\r\n\r\nWe are being allowed to live in the splendid desperate moment of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nInternational war ending to-night.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow morning a thousand civil wars breaking out in a thousand\r\nnations--between classes--unless we all do our seeing and do our living\r\nswiftly and do it together swiftly to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen one-tenth of the people of America tell the President of the United\r\nStates and nine-tenths of the people that they cannot have any coal\r\nunless they do what the one-tenth say; when another one-tenth of the\r\npeople tell the nine-tenths that they cannot have anything to eat, and\r\nanother one-tenth tell them that they cannot have anything to wear until\r\nthe one-tenth get what they want, just how much more democratic America\r\nis than Germany it is difficult to say; and just why anybody should\r\nsuppose the emergency is over it is difficult to say. The idea of getting\r\nwhat you want by hold-up which has been taught to labor by capital, is\r\nnow getting ready to be used by labor and capital both, and by everybody.\r\n\r\nThe really great immediate universal emergency to-day in America is the\r\nholdup. We get rid of one Kaiser other people have three thousand miles\r\naway, to get instead five thousand Kaisers we have to live with next door\r\nhere at home, that we have to ask things of and say \"please\" to every\r\ntime we cook, every time we eat, every time we buy something to wear.\r\n\r\nThe emergency is not only immediate but it is universal, all the people\r\nare concerned in meeting it all the time. We have said to one another and\r\nto everybody for four years that what we have all been sacrificing for\r\nand dying for these four years is to make the world safe for democracy.\r\n\r\nThis was our emergency. We were right. The emergency we are meeting now\r\nis to make democracy safe for the world. If the Kaiser wanted to dream\r\nhis wildest dream of autocratic sneer and autocratic hate he would have\r\ndreamed US; he would have dreamed what we will be unless the men and\r\nwomen of America--especially the men and women of America formerly active\r\nin the Red Cross, shall meet the emergency and undertake in behalf of the\r\npeople to prove to the people how (if anybody will go about and look it\r\nup) industrial democracy in America in distinction from industrial\r\nautocracy, really works.\r\n\r\nIf it works for some of us in some places, let twenty million people--Red\r\nCross people get up and say across this land in every village, town and\r\ncity, it shall work now in all places for all of us. And then take\r\nsteps--all of them every morning, every afternoon, getting together as\r\nthey did in the Red Cross, to see to it that the whole town and everybody\r\nin it does something about it.\r\n\r\nWhen the soldiers of the American army we were all helping in the Red\r\nCross stop fighting the Germans, come home, divide off into classes and\r\nbegin fighting one another, why--because now the soldiers we have been\r\nhelping need us more, because now all day every day they need us more\r\nthan they ever dreamed of needing us when they were merely fighting\r\nGermans--why should we stop helping them?\r\n\r\nOn the day after the armistice--the very day when our war with just\r\nGermans was over, when the deeper, realer, more intimate, more desperate\r\nwar Germany had precipitated upon all nations with themselves, begins,\r\nwhy should the men and women who had been working every afternoon for the\r\nmen of this nation, in the Red Cross, talk about reducing to a peace\r\nbasis?\r\n\r\nThe people in the Red Cross have been having in the last three years the\r\nvision of backing up an army of four million men fighting for the\r\nliberties of the world, but the vision that is before us now--before the\r\nsame people--that we must meet and meet desperately and quickly is the\r\nvision of backing up an army of a hundred million men, women and children\r\nfighting for their own liberties in their own dooryards, fighting for the\r\nliberty to eat at their own tables, to sleep in their own beds, and to\r\nwear clothes on their backs, in a country which we have told the Germans\r\nis the greatest machinery of freedom, the greatest engine of democracy in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nI will not believe that the men and women of all classes who have made\r\nthe Red Cross what it was, who have made the Red Cross the trusted\r\nrepresentative of American democracy in all nations, who now find\r\nthemselves facing both at home and abroad the most desperate, sublime,\r\nmost stupendous chance to save democracy and to present democracy to a\r\nworld, I will not believe that these men and women are going to lose\r\ntheir grip, wave their vision for a people away, forsake forty nations,\r\nforsake the daily heaped-up bewildered fighting of the fighters they have\r\nhelped before.\r\n\r\nThe logical thing at this great moment for the people who made the Red\r\nCross to do--the thing they alone have the record, the teamwork-drill,\r\nthe experience, the machinery, the momentum to do, is to keep on\r\nfollowing the fighters, rendering first aid to the fighters moving on\r\nwith their first-aid from fighters for the rights of the people not to be\r\nbullied by kings, to fighters for the rights of all classes of people not\r\nto be bullied by everybody, not to be bullied by one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWHAT A BODY FOR THE GHOST WOULD BE LIKE\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always wanted to write a book an employer and a workman could read\r\nlooking over each other's shoulders. I would have two chapters on every\r\nsubject. In one chapter I would tell the employer things his workman\r\nwants him to know, and in the next chapter I would tell the workman\r\nthings that for years the employer has been trying to get him to notice.\r\nI would begin each chapter in such a way that no employer or workman\r\nwould ever know which was which, or which was his chapter, until he had\r\ngot in quite a little way; and I would do my best to have everybody read\r\neach other's chapters all through the book. An employer would be reading\r\nalong in his chapter as innocent as you please, and slap his leg and say,\r\n\"THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! It does me good to think my workmen are reading\r\nthis!\" And then he would turn over the leaf and he would come plump full\r\nhead on into three paragraphs about himself and about how the public\r\nfeels about him, and about how his workmen feel about him, and about what\r\nGod is going to do to him, and about what all the people who read my book\r\nare going to help God to do to him, that will make him think. The first\r\nthing he will think of perhaps will be to lay down the book. Then before\r\nhe knows it he will see another of those things he wants his workmen to\r\nread softly poking itself out of the page at him. Then he will slap his\r\nleg and think how I am making his workmen think. So he will go through\r\nthe book slapping his leg and shouting \"Amen\" in one chapter, and sitting\r\nstill and thinking in the next.\r\n\r\nThis is the gist of what I propose a new organization shall do on a\r\nnational scale.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a rather simple-minded way to describe what I propose a great\r\naggregation of American men and women on the scale of the Red Cross,\r\nshould do, but the soul, the spirit, the temperament, even the technique\r\nof what I have in mind--in miniature, is in it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that it would be a certain satisfaction of course to an author\r\nto prove to employers and employees that they could get on better\r\ntogether than they could apart, even if they got on together better only\r\nin a kind of secret and private way in the pages of his own book; and it\r\nis true that a book in which I could make an employer and an employee\r\nwork their minds together through my own little fountain pen would count\r\nsome. I would at least be dramatizing my idea in ink.\r\n\r\nBut people do not believe ideas dramatized in ink.\r\n\r\nThe thing for an author or a man who has ideas to do if he must use\r\nwords, is to use words to make his ideas happen.\r\n\r\nThen let him use words about them and write books about them to advertise\r\nthat they have happened.\r\n\r\nPeople are more impressed with things that have happened than they are\r\nwith things that are perhaps going to. Instead of having employers and\r\nemployees go over the same ideas together in a book, I propose that\r\ntwenty million people, in ten thousand cities shall make them go over the\r\nsame ideas together in the shop.\r\n\r\nAre capital and labor going to use the holdup on each other to get what\r\nthey want when six million dead men, still almost warm in their graves,\r\nhave died to prove that the holdup, or German way of getting things, does\r\nnot work? What the new League will be for will be to put before the\r\nworld, before every nation, before every village and city in its local\r\nbranch, a working vision of how different classes and different groups of\r\npeople can get what they want out of each other by trying things out\r\ntogether, by touching each other's imaginations and advertising to each\r\nother instead of blowing out each other's brains. The way to keep in\r\nplace our Bolshevists of America is to show them that we the combined\r\npeople of America, combined and acting together as one in the\r\norganization I am sketching in this book, know what they want, and that\r\nwe can get the thing they essentially want for them better than they can\r\nget it. The three great groups in American life--the employing class, the\r\nlaboring class, and the consumer--have all belonged to the Red Cross\r\ntogether, they have all worked together and sacrificed themselves, and\r\nsacrificed their class, to work for the Red Cross. What the New League\r\nwill stand for in the name of all of them will be the thing that they\r\nhave already demonstrated in the Red Cross that they can do. Three\r\nclasses can get a thing for one class better than one class can get it.\r\n\r\nThis is the content of the League's vision of action.\r\n\r\nThe method of it will be advertising with enormous campaigns never\r\ndreamed of before what the three-class vision is and how it works. Then\r\nwe will have factories dramatize it. Then we will advertise the\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nThen when we have democracy working in a thousand factories, we will\r\nadvertise and transplant our working democracy, our factory democracies,\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nPeople who have learned that democracy works in their daily work can be\r\ntrusted to believe democracy will work even in their religion, even in\r\ntheir politics.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe idea I have in mind is already foreshadowed in the city of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the people of Cleveland has already rebelled against being\r\ntreated as a ghost--against being whoofed at by Labor unions and trusts.\r\n\r\nAlways before this, when incompetent manufacturers and incompetent labor\r\nunions, for the mere reason that they had not the patience to try very\r\nhard and were incompetent to understand one another and do their job,\r\nheld up the whole city--five hundred thousand people--and calmly made\r\nthem pay for it, the city of Cleveland like any other city would venture\r\nto step in sweetly and kindly, look spiritual and intangible a minute,\r\nsuggest wistfully that they did feel capital and labor were not being\r\nquite fair to Cleveland and would they not please stop interrupting\r\nCleveland several million dollars a day. All that ever would come of it\r\nwould be the yowls of Labor at the Ghost of Cleveland, the noble whines\r\nof manufacturers at the Ghost of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nCleveland was treated as if it was not there.\r\n\r\nCleveland now swears off from being a ghost and proposes to deal bodily\r\nand in behalf of all, with its own lockouts and its own strikes in much\r\nthe same way I am hoping the nation will, according to the news in my\r\npaper this morning.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Paul Pfeiss, an eminently competent manufacturer, recognizing\r\nthe incompetence of his own group as partly responsible for the holdups\r\npracticed on the city and with Mr. Warren S. Stone, an eminently\r\ncompetent labor union leader, recognizing the incompetence of his own\r\ngroup as being also partly responsible--with these two men, one the\r\nofficial representative of the Capital group, and the other the official\r\nrepresentative of the Labor group, both championing the Public group and\r\nstanding out for Cleveland against themselves, taking the initiative and\r\nacting respectively as President and Secretary of the Public group, the\r\nGhost of the city of Cleveland publicly swears off from being a ghost and\r\nbegins precipitating a body for itself.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to hamper my own statement of my idea of a body for the\r\npeople of the United States by linking it up with a definite undertaking\r\nin Cleveland which may or may not prove to be as good an illustration of\r\nit as I hope, but the spirit and the understanding of what has got to\r\nhappen, seems to be in Cleveland--and I stop in the middle of my chapter\r\nwith greetings to Paul Pfeiss and to Warren Stone. In my book the Ghost\r\nof the People of Cleveland salutes the Ghost of the People of the United\r\nStates!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE GHOST GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nA body usually begins with an embryo, and the tissue and skeleton come\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nA book does, too. I prefer not exposing a skeleton much, myself, and am\r\ninclined to feel that the ground plan of a book like the ground plan of a\r\nman, should be illustrated and used, should be presented to people with\r\nthe flesh on, that a skeleton should be treated politely as an inference.\r\n\r\nBut I am dealing with the body of democracy. And people are nervous about\r\ndemocracy just now, so much boneless democracy is being offered to them.\r\n\r\nSo I begin with the principles--the skeleton of the body of democracy for\r\nwhich this book stands.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding features of the body of democracy are the brain, the\r\nheart and the hand.\r\n\r\nWith the brain of democracy goes the right to think.\r\n\r\nWith the heart goes the right to live.\r\n\r\nWith the hand goes the right to be waited on.\r\n\r\nWith these three rights go three greater rights, or three duties, some\r\npeople call them.\r\n\r\nWith the right to think goes the right to let others think.\r\n\r\nWith the right to live goes the right to let others live.\r\n\r\nWith the right to be waited on, goes the right to serve. To call the\r\nright to serve a duty is an understatement. I doubt if the people who\r\nhave succeeded best and who have really attained the largest amount of\r\ntheir three greater rights, have thought of them very often as duties.\r\n\r\nI end this chapter with the three questions America is in the world\r\nto-day to ask, to find out her own personal three answers to in the sight\r\nof the nations.\r\n\r\nI am putting with the three questions the three answers I am hoping to\r\nhear my country give, before I die.\r\n\r\nWhat determines what proportion of his right to think, each man shall\r\nhave?\r\n\r\nHis power to get attention and let others think.\r\n\r\nWhat determines what proportion of his right to live, each man shall\r\nhave?\r\n\r\nHis power to let others live.\r\n\r\nWhat determines what proportion of his right to be waited on, each man\r\nshall have?\r\n\r\nHis power to serve.\r\n\r\nThese are the principles of the new League--the voluntary, spontaneous\r\norganization of the men and women of America to meet the emergency in\r\nAmerica of our war with ourselves, on the same scale and in the same\r\nspirit as the Red Cross met the emergency of our war with other nations,\r\nan organization which I hope to show ought to be formed, and which I am\r\nrising to make the motion to form, in this book.\r\n\r\nI put these principles forward as the by-laws of America's faith in\r\nitself, as the principles that should govern the brain, the heart and the\r\nhand of each man in a democracy, toward all other men and that should\r\ngovern all other men toward him--the skeleton of the body of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHREE RIGHTS OF MAN IN A DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nI--THE RIGHT TO THINK\r\n\r\n\r\nI am entitled to one one-hundred millionth of President Wilson's time in\r\na year.\r\n\r\n1/100,000,000th.\r\n\r\nIf I want 2/100,000,000ths of President Wilson's time in a year I must\r\nshow him why. I must also show the other 99,999,999 people who think I\r\ndeserve no more than my regular 1/100,000,000th why I should have two.\r\nNot allowing for the President's sleeping nights, my precise share of his\r\ntime would be one-third of a second once a year. Why should I have\r\ntwo-thirds of a second?\r\n\r\nI have to show.\r\n\r\nThe success of democracy as a working institution turns on\r\nsalesmanship--upon every man's selling himself--his right to the\r\nattention of the Government.\r\n\r\nA democracy which considers itself a queue of a hundred million people\r\nstanding before the window of the President's attention to be waited upon\r\nby the President in the order in which they are born or in which they\r\ncome up, would be a helpless institution. The success of democracy--that\r\nis, the success of a government in serving the will of the hundred\r\nmillion people in the queue, turns on sorting people in the queue out,\r\nturns on giving attention to what some people in the queue want before\r\nothers. The man who gets out of line and walks up ahead of people who\r\nhave been standing in line longer than he has, must get the permission of\r\nthe queue. He must make the people in the queue feel he represents them\r\nwith the President if he steps up ahead. Then they let him have their\r\nturn. They are glad to let him have hours with the President if they feel\r\nhe is giving hours' worth of representation to their minutes. All each\r\nman wants to feel is that in letting Gompers, for instance, or Schwab, go\r\nup ahead, he is getting with the President a minute an hour long. Miles\r\nof people in rows say to a man like this, who can give them and their\r\ninterests with the President a minute an hour long, \"You first, please.\"\r\n\r\nPolitical democracy, if it works, turns on getting the attention of the\r\nqueue and then going with it to the window.\r\n\r\nPolitical democracy, in other words, turns on advertising.\r\n\r\nSo does industrial democracy.\r\n\r\nIndustrial democracy in a factory of five thousand men consists in making\r\narrangements for the five thousand men to appreciate each other,\r\nappreciate the Firm, and to feel the Firm appreciating them; arrangements\r\nfor having the five thousand men get each other's attention in the right\r\nproportions at the right time so that they work as one.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that is coming in industrial democracy is getting skilled\r\ncapital and skilled labor to appreciate each other's skill. A skilled\r\ncapitalist can not fairly be called a skilled capitalist or, now that\r\nthis war is over, unless he knows how to keep his queue appreciating his\r\nskill, keep his five thousand men standing in line for his attention\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe difference between an industrial autocracy and an industrial\r\ndemocracy is that in an industrial autocracy you keep your queue in line\r\nwith a club, or with threats of bread and butter, and in an industrial\r\ndemocracy you have your queue of five thousand men, each man in the row\r\ncheering you while he sees you giving one minute a week of your attention\r\nto him and one hour a day of your attention to others. Still you find him\r\ncheering you.\r\n\r\nThe skilled employer is the employer who so successfully advertises his\r\nskill to his employees and so successfully advertises their skill to\r\nthemselves and to one another that they hand over to him in their common\r\ninterest the right to sort them over. They hand over to him deliberately,\r\nin other words, in their own interests, the right not to treat them\r\nalike. Democracy consists in keeping people in line without a club.\r\nDemocracy is a queueful of people cutting in ahead of one another fairly\r\nand in a way that the queue stands for.\r\n\r\nIf a man standing in a queue before a ticket window wants to cut in ahead\r\nof five people, the way for him to do it is to show the five people\r\nsomething in his hand that makes them say, \"You first, please.\" He must\r\nshow why he should go first, and that he is doing it in their interest.\r\n\r\nThe other day as I was standing in a long line of people before the\r\nticket window in the Northampton station, I noticed on a guess that half\r\na dozen of the people were standing in line to buy a ticket to New York\r\non the express due in half an hour, and a dozen and a half were standing\r\nin line to buy tickets to Springfield on the local going in three\r\nminutes. I was number thirteen. I wanted to get a ticket for Springfield.\r\nThe thing for me to do, of course, to rise to the crisis and make\r\ndemocracy work, was to jump up on my suitcase and address the queue who\r\nwere ahead of me: \"Ladies and gentlemen! Eighteen or twenty of you in\r\nthis line ahead of me want tickets to Springfield on the train going in\r\nthree minutes, and the rest of you want tickets on the train going in\r\nhalf an hour. If you people who are hoping you can get your tickets in\r\ntime to go to Springfield will let me cut in ahead of you out of my turn\r\nand get my ticket, I will buy tickets for all of you with this ten dollar\r\nbill in thirty seconds, and you can get your tickets of me on the train,\r\nand in this way we will all catch it.\"\r\n\r\nI did not do it, of course, but it would have been what I call democracy\r\nif I had.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem of labor and capital, and of political and industrial\r\nfreedom, from now on after this war would have been solved in miniature\r\nbefore that window--if I had. My invention for the future of the Red\r\nCross is that it should do what I tried to do at that window, for the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nDemocracy is a form of government in which the people are essentially\r\nautocrats. The difference between an autocracy and a democracy is that\r\nthe people select their autocrats. The more autocracy the more\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nA people can not have the autocracy they need to get what they want\r\nunless they are willing to give over to their representatives the\r\nnecessary trust pro tem., the necessary ex officio right to be autocrats\r\nin their behalf. Democracy is autocracy of the people, for the people, by\r\nthe people--that is, by the people in spirit to their representatives who\r\nexpress their spirit.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the people can not keep the people's autocracy for\r\nthem unless they keep in touch with the people--that is, unless they\r\nadvertise to the people and the people feel that they can advertise to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn an autocracy the autocracy of the ruler is based on forcing people's\r\nattention. In a democracy the autocracy is based on touching men's\r\nimaginations, on making people want to fall into line in the right order.\r\nIf the Kaiser had done this in Germany, Germany would have been the\r\ngreatest democracy in the world and the greatest nation. If the Kaiser\r\nhad had the power and genius for advertising of the modern kind, if he\r\nhad had the power of making people want things in distinction from making\r\nthem meek and making them take them whether they wanted them or not, he\r\nwould have invented and set up a working model for America.\r\n\r\nObviously, the more the people desire to form in line the better and more\r\nsuccessful all the people in the line will be in getting what they want\r\nat the window. The more autocracy people know enough to give their\r\nrepresentatives, the better democracy works. In the last analysis the\r\nfate of democracy in modern life turns on having autocrats on\r\nprobation--autocrats selected for their positions by advertising, and\r\nkept in position as autocrats as long as they can advertise to the people\r\nand as long as the people feel that they can advertise to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nII--THE RIGHT TO BE WAITED ON\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocracy is a form of government in which the people are supposed to be\r\nwaited on in the way kings are, and in which the people arrange to have\r\nthings done for them so that they won't have to hold up their work and\r\ntake the time off to do them themselves.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThree Rights to Be Waited on\r\n\r\n1. Skilled labor has the right to be waited on by skilled capital.\r\n\r\nSkilled labor, being preoccupied as it naturally is by its highly\r\nspecialized knowledge and skill, can not take the time off to do for\r\nitself what skilled capital could do in providing work, and providing\r\nmarkets for skilled labor. It cannot, on the other hand, take the time\r\noff to understand skilled capital and what it is doing in detail. Even if\r\nit could take the time off, and if five thousand hands in a factory all\r\ndevoted themselves all day to understanding the work the Office is doing,\r\nthe five thousand would make poor work of understanding.\r\n\r\nArrangements have got to be made in one way or another for skilled\r\nlabor's trusting the Office, for its feeling that the autocracy it\r\nintrusts to the Office is being used fairly in its interest.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important skill of skilled capital, of course, is its\r\nskill in doing for its employees and for its customers what it is\r\nsupposed to do.\r\n\r\nBut the second skill of capital must be skill in being believed in and\r\nfinding means of being believed in by its employees. The more it is\r\nbelieved in, the more power to serve will be accorded to it. In other\r\nwords, the second function of skilled capital is advertising to its\r\nskilled labor, and in making exchange arrangements with its skilled\r\nlabor, for being advertised to.\r\n\r\n2. Skilled capital has a right to be waited on by skilled labor.\r\n\r\nThe first skill of skilled labor must be with its machines and its tools,\r\nand in making its product, but the second skill must be its skill in\r\nbeing believed in. The skilled capital it is supposed to be waited on by\r\nis preoccupied with its skill, and unless labor makes special and very\r\nthorough provision to be understood and to keep understood by skilled\r\ncapital, and by the public and the people who buy the goods, and unless\r\nskilled labor tries to keep in touch all around and do teamwork all\r\naround with all concerned so that it can do its work, it can not fairly\r\nbe called skilled labor at all. Skilled labor has to have skill in\r\nputting its skill with others to produce a result.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the second skill of skilled labor is skill in making\r\narrangements for being believed in and believing in others. Its second\r\nskill is in advertising and in being advertised to.\r\n\r\n3. The other group concerned in industry is one which I like to call the\r\nSkilled Consumers.\r\n\r\nThe people have a right to have capital skilled in considering them, and\r\nlabor skilled in considering them, at every point.\r\n\r\nThe people are the employers of all employers and of all employees.\r\n\r\nThe saying among business men and merchants in case of quarrel, \"The\r\ncustomer is always right,\" has to be in the long run treated in a\r\ndemocracy as if it were approximately true.\r\n\r\nWhat the consumers have to do in a democracy, however, in a singular\r\ndegree is to live up to it. The consumers must make, and I believe are\r\ngoing to make, elaborate arrangements for being skilled consumers.\r\n\r\nSkilled capital has organized.\r\n\r\nSkilled labor has organized.\r\n\r\nAnd now the consumers, or the people, if they are to be skilled, and if\r\nthey are to get out of skilled capital and skilled labor what they want,\r\nwill organize their skill to get it. They will organize to help the best\r\nskilled capital at the expense of the worst, to help the best skilled\r\nlabor at the expense of the worst.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the secret of industrial democracy and of making\r\nindustrial democracy work, lies in making the people skilled in conveying\r\ntheir wishes to the skilled capital and skilled labor waiting on them.\r\n\r\nSkilled capital has a right to be waited on by skilled consumers, who\r\nwill support it when it is right and punish it when it is wrong, by the\r\nway they buy and sell.\r\n\r\nSkilled labor has a right to be waited on by skilled consumers, who will\r\ndefend it from skilled capital that pretends to be skilled and is not.\r\n\r\nTrue and sincere skilled capital and true and sincere skilled labor\r\ncannot keep on doing what they try to do as long as the supposedly\r\nskilled consumers they have a right to, back away from their job and\r\nlazily and foolishly buy and sell in the markets in such a way as to\r\nreward capital for doing wrong to labor, or labor for doing wrong to\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the second function of the skilled consumers after\r\ntelling skilled capital and labor what they want to eat and wear, is to\r\nmake arrangements to advertise to capital and labor and to have capital\r\nand labor advertise to them, so that they can be skilled in knowing how\r\nto help them work together, and skilled in buying in such a way as to\r\nhelp in making capital and labor more skilled instead of less in dealing\r\nwith themselves and one another and with the people.\r\n\r\nI have summed up the three Rights to Be Waited On. All of these rights\r\nturn on skilled advertising and on the science of being believed in, the\r\nscience of being allowed to be autocrats, the science of being allowed by\r\nthe people to make their democracy work.\r\n\r\nI would like to illustrate this in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIII--THE RIGHT TO WHISPER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe employees in the stockyards in ---- have been trying to get the\r\nattention of Mr. John Doe, the young man who inherited the business, to\r\nthe fact that the least a family can live on now is $1388 a year.\r\n\r\nMr. Doe, who has never tried being bitterly poor and whose attention can\r\nnot be got to what can be done in a year for a wife and five children\r\nwith $1388 until he tries it, is rather discouraging to deal with.\r\n\r\nThere is no known way of getting him to try it, and in the meantime he\r\nthinks he knows without trying, and he thinks his attention is got when\r\nit is not. He tells the workmen that two pairs of shoes ought to last a\r\nchild a year--and goes home in his limousine.\r\n\r\nThat is the end of it.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be the end of it.\r\n\r\nWho can get Mr. Doe's attention?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that Mr. Doe's employees do not succeed in getting Mr. Doe's\r\nattention?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that Mr. Doe has so little difficulty in getting theirs? Why is\r\nit that Mr. Doe's employees, when he speaks of the two pairs of shoes a\r\nyear, hang on his words?\r\n\r\nBecause Mr. John Doe is their employer.\r\n\r\nWho are the people whose words Mr. Doe would hang on and would be obliged\r\nto hang on?\r\n\r\nMr. Doe's employers.\r\n\r\nWho are Mr. Doe's employers?\r\n\r\nAll the people in America who eat meat.\r\n\r\nOf course if one had just come from Mars yesterday and was looking about\r\nstudying things, the first thing one would ask would be, Why do not the\r\npeople in America who eat meat, and who keep on Mr. Doe in his position,\r\nat once mention to him that they wish him to look into the matter of the\r\ntwo pairs of shoes a year?\r\n\r\nBecause the People Who Eat Meat--Mr. Doe's employers--have no way of\r\nmentioning it to Mr. Doe.\r\n\r\nIf the People Who Eat Meat would but barely whisper to Mr. Doe it would\r\nget his attention as much as a whole year's shouting would from his\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nBut the People Who Eat Meat in America have no whisper. In other words,\r\nit is because Mr. Doe's employers are absolutely dumb, and Mr. Doe is\r\nabsolutely deaf to any one except his employers, that two pairs of shoes\r\nare not enough for the workmen's children.\r\n\r\nIt is for the purpose of letting the People Who Eat Meat in\r\nAmerica--whisper and learn to whisper in this country that the new League\r\norganized to operate as a kind of People's Advertising Guild or\r\nConsumers' Advertising Club, with its national office in New York and its\r\nlocal branches in ten thousand towns and cities, now offers its services\r\nto all people who eat meat in America.\r\n\r\nThe employers of America have organized to do anything with their\r\nbusiness, and anything with their workmen, and anything with the country\r\nthat they like.\r\n\r\nThe workmen of America have organized to do now, and are deliberately\r\nplanning to do anything with their work, and anything with their\r\nemployers, and anything with the country that they like.\r\n\r\nThe new national League is now to be organized as the voice of the\r\nAmerican people, as the whisper of the will of the consumer in every\r\nindustry in America.\r\n\r\nThe people to get the attention of employers are the employers of the\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nEvery civil war we are having in this country can be settled and the\r\nattention of the fighters on both sides can be got, and the country can\r\nwork as one man in making democracy safe for the world, the moment the\r\nemployers of the employers whisper.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe way I would like to end this chapter--with the blanks filled in, of\r\ncourse, would be this.\r\n\r\nAnybody who wants to be a part of this whisper, who knows of any industry\r\nhe would like to see a whisper from the people tried in, or who wishes as\r\nan Associate Member to join the Air Line League--a League for the direct\r\naction of the people in what concerns them all, is invited to send five\r\ndollars as membership fee and his name and address, to ----, Treasurer\r\nNational Office of The Air Line League, Number ---- Street, New York.\r\n\r\nBut the chapter cannot end in this way.\r\n\r\nThis is merely the pattern of the way I would like to have it end later,\r\nand while I have put the name--The Air Line League--down and am going to\r\nuse it for the convenience of this book, I only do so, leaving it open to\r\nthe people who have the vision of The League and who put the vision into\r\naction, to change the name if they want to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TO WHISPER TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery man like all Gaul is divided into three parts. He is an employee of\r\nsomebody, an employer of somebody, and a consumer.\r\n\r\nThe natural employer left to himself is apt to suppose, if he is making\r\nshoes, that his consumers ought to pay more for shoes, and that his\r\nemployees ought to be paid less. As regards hats, and umbrellas, and\r\novercoats, and underwear, the same man is a rather noble impartial person\r\ntowards employers and employees. He wants them to listen to each other\r\nand lower the cost of living by not having strikes and lockouts, and by\r\nnot fighting each other ten hours a day.\r\n\r\nIn 999 out of 1000 labor quarrels a consumer is naturally a fair-minded\r\nperson and the best-located person to control and determine how any\r\nparticular business shall be run.\r\n\r\nThe League proposed is planned to operate in its national and local\r\nfunctions as a national Consumers' Club, with working branches in every\r\ntown which shall be engaged in doing specific things every day toward\r\nmaking the employers and employees in that town listen to each other in\r\nthe interests of the consumer public.\r\n\r\nIt is always to the interests of the consumer-public to see to it that\r\npeople who have particular interests in a business should be compelled to\r\nlisten to the others' interests.\r\n\r\nConsumers naturally prefer experts to run things for them, but if they do\r\nnot run them for them, they are the natural people to make them do it.\r\n\r\nIn the last resort the right to control is with the consumers.\r\n\r\nWe are going to look to them very soon now as the natural Central\r\nTelephone Exchange in business. It is the consumers who connect everybody\r\nup. They are the switchboard of the World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TO TRUST SOMEBODY\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocracy--as perhaps my reader will have heard me say before--democracy\r\nis a form of government in which the people are supposed to be waited on\r\nin just the way kings are and in which the people arrange to have things\r\ndone for them so that they won't have to hold up their work and take the\r\ntime off to do them themselves.\r\n\r\nI try to go to the polls as I should. But I resent being obliged by my\r\ndear native country to stand up in a booth by myself with a lead pencil\r\nand know all there is to know and in a few minutes, about seventy-five\r\nmen on a ticket. I do not like to feel that I am swaying the world with\r\nthat yellow pencil, and that the ignorant way I feel when I am putting\r\ndown crosses beside names, is the feeling other people have, that this\r\nfeeling I have--in those few brief miserable moments I spend with the\r\nyellow pencil--is the feeling that this country is being governed with.\r\n\r\nI met a man the other day as he came out from the polls who asked me who\r\nsomebody was he had voted for, and he said he went on the general\r\nprinciple when he was up in one of those stalls of ignorance and was\r\nbeing stood up faithfully with nothing in his head to rule the\r\ncountry--he went on the general principle that every time he came on the\r\nname of a man he knew, he just voted for the other.\r\n\r\nAs a democrat and as a believer in crowds I resent the idea that being\r\nstood up and being made to vote on seventy-five names I cannot know\r\nanything about is democracy. It is tyranny. It is a demand that I do\r\nsomething no one has a right to make me do. I have other things every man\r\nknows I can do better and so has the man in the booth next to me, than\r\nknowing all there is to know about seventy-five names on a ticket--Smiths\r\nand Browns and Smiths and Smiths--it is a thing I want to have done for\r\nme, I want experts--engineers in human nature that I and my fellow\r\ncitizens can hire to pick out my employees, _i.e._, the employees of the\r\nstate that I want and that I have a right to and that I would have if I\r\nhad time to stop work, study them and find them. Very often the way we\r\ndon't go to the polls in America is to our credit. It is the protest of\r\nour intelligence against the impossibility of being intelligent toward so\r\nmany subjects and detectives toward so many people.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to stop doing things we know we know, and know we can do,\r\nto vote on expert questions we don't even want to know anything about,\r\nhuge laundry-lists of people that God only knows or could know and that\r\ncan only be seen through anyway by large faithful hard-working committees\r\nwho devote their time to it.\r\n\r\nIf we spent nine hours a day in doing nothing else but reading papers and\r\nwatching and going up and down our laundry-list of valuable persons day\r\nand night we couldn't keep track or begin to keep track of the people we\r\nput in office. It is not our business to, it seems to many of us. Perhaps\r\nI should merely speak for myself. I can at least be permitted to say that\r\nit is not my business. If the state will give me ten men to watch, men in\r\nprominent places where they can be watched more or less naturally and\r\neasily, I will undertake to help watch them and then vote on them. What I\r\ndemand and have a right to as a democrat and as a man who wants to get\r\nthings for the people is that these ten men shall look after the other\r\nsixty-five and let me attend to business. The other sixty-five have a\r\nright to be looked after, criticized and appreciated by people who can do\r\nit, by men who can devote themselves to it, by men we all elect\r\nintelligently to do it for us--by men we have all looked through and\r\nthrough and trust.\r\n\r\nThe last year or so I have been getting about three long communications a\r\nweek from the ---- Railway which has been trying to make me over into an\r\nexpert on all the details of its relation to the Government. I wish I had\r\ntime to know all about it. Some of us will have to. Things are so\r\narranged just now in this country that probably if a lot of us whose\r\nbusiness it is to travel on the railroads instead of running them don't\r\ntake a hand at it for a while and butt in in behalf of both the railroads\r\nand the Government, there won't be any railroads or there won't be any\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut I resent having this crisis put up to me personally. I resent having\r\na pile a foot high of things I have got to know before I can help the\r\nGovernment to be fair to the railroads--or the railroads to be fair to\r\nthe Government. I am better anyway at writing books. I don't want to be\r\njerked into a judge--or a corporation lawyer because I am a voter.\r\nRailroads always bewilder me. Even the simplest things railroads tell\r\neverybody about themselves are hard for me to understand--time-tables for\r\ninstance; and why should a man who is always innocently taking Sunday\r\ntrains on Monday afternoon be called on to butt in on an expert auditor's\r\njob in this way, beat his Congressman on the head with the poor penitent\r\nrailroads--with all the details about their poor insides--and with all\r\ntheir back bills and things?\r\n\r\nThere must be other voters who feel about this as I do.\r\n\r\nIs this Democracy?\r\n\r\nThis is what Democracy is to me--Democracy is a belief in the\r\nfaithfulness, ability and shrewd good-heartedness of crowds and their\r\npower to select great and true leaders.\r\n\r\nThe essential fundamental principle of the democratic form of government\r\nis supposed to be that more than any other form of government on the face\r\nof the earth it trusts people. A democracy that does not trust its\r\nleaders, that does not trust even its best men, is not as democratic as a\r\nmonarchy that does. Some of us seem to think that all that people can be\r\ntrusted to do is to pick out men we can keep from leading us, that it's a\r\nkind of religion to us to select men we can stop and bother. They have\r\nsettled down to the idea that this is what we are like--as if the main\r\nqualification of a candidate in America is a gift of making people, of\r\nmaking in fact almost anybody, feel superior to him. I believe I am\r\nliving in a democracy that will dare to elect experts in subjects, that\r\nwill take being a statesman seriously--as a special and skilled\r\nprofession, an expert engineering job in human nature, and in getting\r\nthings out of people, and for people. We are getting ready for great and\r\ntrue leaders in America. Our people are getting ready to stake their fate\r\nin picking them out. Even our banks are. Our labor unions are. In our\r\npolitics it is the masterful servants we are taking to most. Anybody can\r\nsee it. There are particular things and men we want, and the first leader\r\nwe have in this country who is shrewd enough about us to see that we, the\r\npeople of this country, are not as vague or cartilaginous as we look, who\r\ntreats us like fellow human beings, who dares to expect things of us and\r\ndares to expect to be trusted by us and who dares to keep still long\r\nenough to do things for us, will show what America is like, in spite of\r\nwhat she looks like, and will bring America out.\r\n\r\nAnd America instead of being a kind of big slovenly adolescent,\r\nperpetually thirteen-year-old nation going around with its big innocent\r\nmouth open, will be grown up at last among the nations of the earth, will\r\nbe a great clear-cut, clear-headed, firm-knit, sinewy nation that knows\r\nwhat it wants, and gets it--and does not say much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TO VOTE ALL DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis principle which I have applied in this last chapter to political\r\ndemocracy applies still more forcibly to democracy in industry, and to\r\nthe right of the people to be waited on by skilled labor and by skilled\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to bother to know everything about how everything I buy\r\nevery day is made, but I do want to have arrangements made through a\r\nnational league to which I belong, for instance, so that I can\r\npractically know about the conditions under which anything is made, the\r\nmoment I wish to.\r\n\r\nThere should be as it were a card catalogue or authority in my town that\r\nI can go to and consult, which represents me and a hundred million\r\npeople. This is my conception of what the National League through its\r\nlocal branches could do and do for everybody. It would only cost a few\r\ncents more to have a hundred million men know about a particular article\r\nwhat ten, twenty or a hundred or a thousand know, the moment they happen\r\nto need it, by looking it up in the League's national opinion of it and\r\nnational experience with it, in a card catalogue or what would operate\r\npractically as a card catalogue.\r\n\r\nWe all have the right in this country to spend our money intelligently.\r\nIf people want to get our thousand dollars a year, or two thousand a\r\nyear, or three, five, or ten thousand a year, they must show cause why\r\nthey should have it, dollar for dollar. We want our dollars to help\r\npeople to help us, laborers who are helping the country and capitalists\r\nwho are helping the country. Every time I spend ten cents I want to know\r\nthat I am getting ten cents' worth of democracy, ten cents' worth of\r\nskilled capital and skilled labor working for all of us. I propose to\r\nvote with my money on the fate of my country and the fate of democracy\r\nwith silver coins and with dollar bills every day. The other kind of\r\nballot, the paper ballot, I can only use in the nature of the case once\r\nor twice a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE SKILLED CONSUMER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way to control the world and govern the well-being of men is not\r\nthrough the time they have left over, or the time they choose to lay one\r\nside for it, but directly and through their most important engagements\r\nand things they do and are sure to do all the time.\r\n\r\nA man's first important engagement in this world is with his own breath.\r\n\r\nHis second engagement is with his own stomach.\r\n\r\nHis third is with the night and with sleep.\r\n\r\nHis fourth is with posterity, with the unborn, with his children and\r\nchildren's children.\r\n\r\nHis fifth is with his ancestors and with God.\r\n\r\nIn nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand things a man needs to\r\nhave to keep these engagements--things he has to have if he is alive at\r\nall, he is a consumer.\r\n\r\nWhat the new League will say to the consumer is something like this:\r\n\r\n\"In nine hundred and ninety-nine things out of a thousand you have to\r\nhave to live, the Air Line League is organized to stand by you, express\r\nyou and get the attention of everybody to what you want; and in the one\r\nthing you make for everybody it is going to express everybody to you and\r\nget your attention to what everybody wants of you.\"\r\n\r\nThis would seem to most of us to be fair all around.\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks of it, why should one-thousandth part of what a man has\r\nand has to have, in order to live his life--the part he makes himself--be\r\nseen everywhere in this world in every man's life holding up and\r\nbullying, making him pay high prices for, the other nine hundred and\r\nninety-nine thousandths?\r\n\r\nLet the nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of a man's life take\r\npossession of the one thousandth part of him. Then we will have a\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nOr at least the nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of him will\r\npersuade the one thousandth of him to cooeperate.\r\n\r\nWe have had autocracy of capital because on the whole in the world until\r\nmachinery came in, capital kept close enough to labor and to the consumer\r\nto know what the workmen and the people wanted.\r\n\r\nNow that Capital has lost its grip, Labor announces that it is going to\r\nbe after this war the autocrat, and represent capital and the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League is here to ask, Why should not the consumer represent\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\nCapital has tried and failed and has said, \"Let the public be damned.\"\r\nNow Labor has tried and failed, and is saying hoarsely in a thousand\r\ncities, \"Let the public be damned.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League is for is to advertise the people together, and\r\nlet the consumers represent themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat we have been fighting for essentially in this war is the control of\r\nthe consumers in the world in all nations.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of democracy and of organizing the will of the people, what\r\nwe really mean is organizing the will of the consumers.\r\n\r\nOrganizing the will of the consumers is not a holdup. A holdup by all the\r\npeople of all the people for all the people is Liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nSAMPLE DEMOCRACIES\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not want to delay or bother people with my definition of democracy,\r\nbut I do not mind confiding to them where I have seen some.\r\n\r\nOne is always coming upon bits or dots of democracy in America. It is\r\nthese bits or dots of rough more or less unfinished democracy we have in\r\nAmerica which make most of us believe in the people of this country.\r\n\r\nEverybody in America knows of them.\r\n\r\nThere are at least forty-four dots of democracy--little marked-off\r\nplaces--what might be called safety zones (everybody knows of them), even\r\nin New York. There are usually white globes in front of them, and a short\r\nname written in long plain slanting white letters across a huge piece of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nIf anybody wants to see just what democracy is like in business all he\r\nhas to do is to go into the nearest Childs restaurant, order some\r\ngriddle-cakes, sit down and eat and think. All he really needs to do is\r\nto study the menu, but of course a menu is more thoroughly studied by\r\neating some of it.\r\n\r\nOne soon finds that a menu may be a little modest every-day magna charta\r\nof democracy or it may not.\r\n\r\nWhat a menu has long been for in the typical restaurant is to find a way\r\nof browbeating and bewildering a customer into spending more money for\r\nhis luncheon than he intends to when he comes in.\r\n\r\nRows of grieved and vaguely disturbed people can be seen in restaurants\r\nevery day--being mowed down by menus.\r\n\r\nIn a Childs restaurant business success is based on turning the whole\r\nidea of a menu around, and instead of the customer's coming in and\r\nstudying the menu, the menu studies him.\r\n\r\nThe consumer in a Childs restaurant is there to economize and the\r\nrestaurant is there to help him do it, the whole menu being constructed\r\nby experts in foods for the express purpose of telling the customer more\r\nthan he knows about his food and his money, persuading him and\r\npractically tricking him into spending less money on his luncheon than he\r\nintends to.\r\n\r\nA business may be said to be a big vital and winning business in any line\r\nin proportion as one sees the consumers in it--practically running\r\nit--running it in spirit. A democratic business is one which is being run\r\nas the consumers would run it if they knew how.\r\n\r\nA business may be said to be a democratic business in proportion as one\r\nsees experts in it expressing crowds. One sees great crowds going to and\r\nfro and up and down in it acting for all practical purposes like\r\ngeniuses, like skilled angels doing every day offhand inspired and\r\ninspiring difficult adventurous things as a matter of course--like\r\ntackling the high cost of living.\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League is for is to make the consumers of America--the\r\nall-class class, class-conscious--is to organize the consumers of America\r\nlocally and nationally so that the comparative cooeperation of crowds and\r\ngeniuses and experts as in Childs' restaurants, can be assured in all\r\nlines of business, taken over, improved, standardized, established as the\r\nlabel of modern successful business life.\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League definition of democracy would be this:\r\n\r\nA democracy may be said to be a state of society in which the consumers\r\nor the people who want things, have the complete and whole-hearted expert\r\nattention of the men who make them.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of America and of the other democracies during the war has\r\nbeen that they have proved that crowds can have and can be depended upon\r\nto have, experts, fifty thousand dollar men or anybody they want, to wait\r\non them while they whip the Germans.\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League proposes to do (Further details later) is to\r\narrange through its local and national branches to answer the sneer of\r\nthe Germans that crowds and experts in democracy can not find a way to\r\nkeep this up.\r\n\r\nIs it true or is it not true that the moment this war is over all our\r\nexperts drop away--permanently drop away from waiting on crowds--are\r\nreally going back now for fifty or a hundred thousand a year, to waiting\r\non themselves in just the way the Germans said they would?\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League will stand for will be that experts and crowds\r\ncan be found waiting on each other and having the mutual convenience and\r\npower of waiting on each other during peace as well as war.\r\n\r\nWhy should we put up with the idea of having these conveniences and\r\npowers for a mere little sidesteppish interrupting thing like whipping\r\nthe Germans and not having them all the while, every day, for ourselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN PENDULUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League in its local, national and international branches\r\nwill act as a Listening Machine.\r\n\r\nA Listening Machine may be said to work two ways, backward and forward.\r\nWorked forward, it listens to people until they feel understood. When the\r\nsame machine is turned around and worked the other way, it makes people\r\nlisten until they understand.\r\n\r\nThere are people in every town and in every local branch of the League\r\nwho have what I like to call sometimes, pendulum temperaments. People in\r\nmotion are not as reliable and as calculable as brass. People have wills,\r\nvisions, individual emotions and lurchings of their own. When a man with\r\na pendulum temperament sees a colossal pendulum made of crowds of\r\npeople--crowds of employers and crowds of workmen--swinging from one\r\nextreme to another, the first thing he wants to do as each issue comes\r\nup, local or national, is to see to it that his own mind and each other\r\nman's mind in these two crowds on each side of the question should go\r\ntwice through the middle, to going once to the extremes at either end.\r\n\r\nIn other words, The National Air Line League will act to bring extremes\r\ntogether--twice through the middle to once at each end--and local clubs\r\nwill act as attention-swinging machines--as attention-forcing machines\r\nbetween classes.\r\n\r\nI might give an illustration:\r\n\r\nThe National League in its central office in New York gets a report from\r\nthe local branch in the town where Smith safety razors are made that the\r\nSmith Works are in a chronic state of strikes and sabotage and sustained\r\nugliness and inefficiency. The Central Office, after quietly looking into\r\nit, hearing both sides and finding the charge is true, sends through its\r\nlocal branches reports to the ten million men shaving with Smith blades\r\nevery morning that the workmen and managers of the Smith factories, who\r\nare working a nominal nine hours a day, are spending three hours a day in\r\nfighting with each other as to how Smith blades should be made for the\r\npublic, and six hours a day in making the blades. The consumer is told by\r\nthe League that he is paying for nine hours' work a day on his blades and\r\nonly getting six, and that if the employers and employees in the Smith\r\nfactories could be got to listen to each other and to work together the\r\nblades could be had for three cents less apiece.\r\n\r\nThe League will then proceed through its local branch in the Smith town\r\nto arrest the attention of the Smith workmen and the Smith employers. It\r\nwill suggest that they get each other's point of view and sit down very\r\nearnest and hear everything that the other side has to say and everything\r\nthe other side wants to do, until they find some way of getting together\r\nand being efficient and knowing how to make Smith blades.\r\n\r\nIf necessary in order to get the attention of the workmen and employers\r\nat the Smith Works to the desirability of their listening to each other,\r\nthe users of Smith blades throughout the country will shave themselves\r\nwith their fathers' razors for three weeks.\r\n\r\nIf the Government says that this is conspiracy, and that shutting up a\r\nfactory to make the people in it listen to each other and listen to the\r\nconsumers is against the law of the land, all the people in America who\r\nshave will turn the Government out of office and have the law changed.\r\n\r\nA strike by workmen in a particular business is a holdup of all the other\r\nworkmen in the country, raises the cost of living for everybody, and is\r\nundemocratic and unfair.\r\n\r\nA lockout of employers in a particular business is a holdup of all other\r\nemployers and workmen, and is undemocratic and unfair.\r\n\r\nIn a country of a hundred million people a holdup conducted by a hundred\r\nmillion people for the hundred million people is democracy.\r\n\r\nI employ this rather threatening illustration of the possible action of\r\nthe League in certain cases because it suggests the power of democracy\r\nwhen experts and crowds act together--the fact that democracy can really\r\nbe made to work, that democracy can be as forcible, as immediate and\r\npractical in dealing with autocratic classes, as autocracy can.\r\n\r\nBut only two or three per cent of what the League in its local and\r\nnational branches would really do would be like the illustration I have\r\nused. The power the League would have to do things like this would make\r\ndoing them unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe regular work of the League would largely consist in accepting\r\ninvitations from factories, and in supplying and training experts for the\r\npurpose of conducting in a factory mutual advertising campaigns, or\r\nstudies in attention between workmen and employers, adapted to different\r\ntypes of factories.\r\n\r\nThe way out for democracy in dealing with predatory wealth which\r\norganizes to hold up the consumers, and with predatory labor which\r\norganizes to hold up the consumers, is for the consumers to organize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL LISTENING MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople are so much more apt to bear in mind in proportion, the power of\r\nan organization to be ugly, than they are its power not to need to be\r\nugly--to get what it wants with people by combining with them instead of\r\nfighting them, that perhaps it might be well to dwell a moment on the\r\nfact that the power of the consumers of the country as organized in the\r\nAir Line League, to make it uncomfortable for predatory labor or\r\npredatory capital, will never be abused.\r\n\r\nIf what an organization is for, is to put the soul and body of a people\r\ntogether it is compelled as a matter of course, to get its own way with\r\nthe same quietness, dignity and power it is telling other people to. The\r\nfirst business of the Air Line League is going to be, to be believed in\r\nby everybody. The way to be believed in by everybody is for the League to\r\ndo itself the thing that it talks about doing. If in this way the League\r\nsoon gets itself believed in by everybody, the first thing people will\r\nnotice about the Air Line League will soon be that it is an organization\r\nthat can lick anybody in sight with its little finger. The next thing\r\npeople will notice is that it never gets so low that it has to do it.\r\n\r\nThe power of labor unions and employers' associations has frequently been\r\nabused because they have many of them organized their power for the\r\nexpress purpose of abusing it.\r\n\r\nIt is highly unlikely that people will need to be afraid of the power of\r\nthe Air Line League. An organization which exists for the express purpose\r\nof driving out of business people who get what they want by holdups, the\r\nentire activities of which are devoted to proving to people how much more\r\nholding out a hand gets for people in business than sticking out a fist,\r\nsoon gets its fist trusted.\r\n\r\nIf the Air Line League abuses its power it will commit suicide so fast\r\nthat people will feel suddenly safe.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIf I were writing a platform for the Air Line League, it might be put\r\nperhaps for all practical purposes in one sentence.\r\n\r\nSubject--War.\r\n\r\nObject--Stopping it.\r\n\r\nPredicate--What we believe about war.\r\n\r\nVerb--What we propose to do about what we believe about war.\r\n\r\nAdverb--How we propose to do it.\r\n\r\nPeriod--Peace.\r\n\r\nThe main trouble with the sentence forty nations are trying to stutter\r\nout now, is that there is no predicate, no verb, no spinal column of\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nThe spinal column of belief in the Air Line League--the gist of our\r\nplatform--is this one sentence:\r\n\r\nPEOPLE FIGHT BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET OTHER'S ATTENTION.\r\n\r\nEverything we believe and propose to do follows from this.\r\n\r\nThe way to stop war is to advertise, to provide and set up in full sight\r\nand in working order before people who are trying to get what they want\r\nby war, a substitute for war which gets what they want for them quicker\r\nand better.\r\n\r\nThe way to keep people who fight from fighting is to stand over them,\r\nadvertise to them and dramatize to them how much more people can get by\r\nlistening to each other. Then compel them to listen.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe in fighting on the one hand nor in an anaemic and\r\ntemporary thing like arbitration on the other. All that men really do in\r\narbitration is to hire their listening done for them by other people.\r\n\r\nListening which men were created to do themselves, which is done for them\r\nby others, only lasts a minute.\r\n\r\nThe three plain spiritual brutal facts that capital and labor have to\r\nreckon with and conform to in dealing with human nature to-day are these:\r\n\r\nDisputes can not be fought out--not even by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nDisputes can not be arbitrated out by other people for them.\r\n\r\nAll other people are for in a fight is to compel the fighters to listen\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nDoing anything less than compelling the fighters to listen to each other,\r\nis visionary, cowardly, temporary and impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe moment people stop fighting, begin listening to each other and begin\r\nfeeling listened to, nobody can hire them to organize to fight each\r\nother. They organize to listen to each other.\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League is for in every nation, in every city, town and\r\nvillage where a branch is set up, is to organize people to listen to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI do not think any one is going to feel obliged to feel afraid of the\r\npower of a League, that puts daily before its own face, before\r\neverybody's face--before every letter it writes, and before everything it\r\ndoes, across its letter-head, this chapter in nine words.\r\n\r\nPEOPLE FIGHT BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET EACH OTHER'S ATTENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE NATIONAL LISTENING MACHINE WILL WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nNine people out of ten who do wrong in business, do it because they feel\r\nthat if they do not do the wrong to some one else, some one else will do\r\nthe wrong to them. In the last analysis, some way of bringing about\r\nconscription for universal service in business is the only way in which\r\nwe can be assured that the criminals and exploiters in any particular\r\nline of industry will not, at least temporarily, control and ruin the\r\nbusiness. What the Air Line League would do practically would be to\r\norganize American business-men into a kind of \"I Won't If You Won't\"\r\nClub. A very large majority of men daily see that certain things ought\r\nnot to be done. It is not right-mindedness in people that is needed so\r\nmuch as the organization of the right-mindedness so that those who are\r\nwrong can be crowded out. My idea of the general policy of the Air Line\r\nLeague would be to bring the public to cooeperate with the best men in\r\neach industry in such a way as to drive the worst ones out. Probably from\r\na publicity point of view the best way to do would be for the League to\r\npick out the nine best factories in the country in which the laborers\r\nhave a working understanding and a practical listening arrangement with\r\ntheir employers, and help the laborers in these nine factories advertise\r\nto other laborers in the country, at specific times and places, and to\r\ncapital throughout the country, how they like it. One factory in ten, if\r\nnecessary, could be selected for national discipline. A notorious factory\r\ncould be picked out in which the laborers had the worst listening\r\narrangement, and in which both the employers and employees were imposing\r\nupon each other to their own detriment and the detriment of their\r\ncustomers the most; and could be publicly disciplined by the National\r\nLeague acting through its local clubs everywhere. Cooperating with nine\r\nfactories and disciplining one would be my idea of the best way to get\r\nresults. All that would need to be done would be to make a list of all\r\nthe industries in the country and keep the buyers of the country informed\r\nabout them through the local Clubs.\r\n\r\nIndustrial democracy is coming in this country one industry at a time.\r\nEach industry is going to work out its own salvation by emancipating and\r\nfreeing the hands of the men who can run it best in the interests of the\r\npublic--that is, run it with the lowest prices to the public, the highest\r\nprices to the wage earners, and a surplus for improvements, inventions\r\nand experiments in rendering its product of more service to all.\r\n\r\nI am not in favor of having capitalists try to convince labor as a class,\r\nnor having labor try to convince capital as a class. The skilled labor\r\nwhich has been convinced by capital should convince the others through\r\nthe services of twenty thousand local Clubs, and skilled capital which\r\nhas succeeded in being believed in by its labor will do the same in\r\nconvincing other capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nMAKING A RIGHT START\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the idea I have in mind might be imagined as a kind\r\nof civic federation club, a super-consumers' league, and a\r\nsuper-advertising club rolled into one. Rolling these three ideas into\r\none is a temperament, and the men who are full of the vision of what can\r\nbe done with them rolled into one, and of what is the matter with them if\r\nthey are not rolled into one, must be the controlling powers in the new\r\norganization. The Civic Federation has been a safe plodding vague\r\ninstitution because it has not had a vigorous vision of itself, and has\r\nnot been conducted by men who have a personal genius for conceiving and\r\ncarrying out cooeperation between capital and labor. It has been weak,\r\ntheoretical, and full of generalization because it has not had the\r\ndriving force that such a man as Schwab--some Schwab in publicity instead\r\nof steel--could have given it.\r\n\r\nThe Consumers' League has been a useful, suggestive institution, and has\r\ndone work of value (as it would doubtless say itself) in a more or less\r\nnagging and sporadic way, but it has had no national militant vision or\r\nsense of thoroughness in what it could do because it lacked the\r\nadvertising clinch, the advertising willfulness and irresistibleness that\r\nputs things through.\r\n\r\nThe new organizations--as a super-consumers' league, a super-advertising\r\nclub--will converge these two ideas into a huge momentum, into a national\r\norganized drive or vision of making men see together and act together,\r\nuntil we work out social democracy in every man's business, in every\r\nman's store, and the daily work of every man's life. Programs which have\r\nmerely been yearned at before, which have been sleazily groped at and\r\ngeneralized over and guessed at before, will be gathered up, articulated,\r\nmelted into a huge common national action by men who have the consuming\r\npassion and genius for touching the imaginations of others. The selection\r\nand articulation of these men in all communities is all that is\r\nnecessary. Everything is waiting and ready. First we will get the men\r\ntogether who have the fire. Then we will put fire under the boilers of\r\nthe nation and turn the drive-wheels of a world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nUP TO THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons which, as it seems to me, show that my plan is\r\nnot visionary, and that the skilled consumers who organize their skill in\r\nthe way I have outlined, are bound to succeed in doing what now most\r\nneeds to be done for high production and team-work in the industries of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n1. The consumer class is practically everybody.\r\n\r\n2. The consumer class is the most disinterested, and is identified with\r\nboth capital and labor. It is the natural umpire between them. Its line\r\nof least resistance is to act fairly.\r\n\r\n3. The interests of the consumer class lead it not only to act fairly but\r\nto act energetically. The consumer class as a class will want to pay\r\nextra for as few quarrels between the people it is paying to make things\r\nfor it as possible. The consumer always pays for all quarrels, and\r\nanything that is good for the employers and employees in the long run can\r\nnot but be good for the consumer in the long run.\r\n\r\n4. In the last analysis, the consumers in any given industry, if duly\r\norganized as capital and labor are now, will not only have the\r\ndisposition to act fairly in a quarrel between the people who are making\r\nsomething that they buy, and the disposition to act quickly and have the\r\nfight over with, but they will have as buyers the power as a last resort\r\nto choose the factories they will deal with; to do their buying naturally\r\nand cheaply, and from factories that are entirely in the business of\r\nmaking goods and not half in the business of making goods and half in the\r\nbusiness of making civil war. The nationally organized consumers will\r\nnaturally advertise to people which firms take the least time off for\r\nfighting, and put all their work into the goods they expect the people to\r\npay for.\r\n\r\nThis national advertising campaign will be operated through national\r\nheadquarters, cooeperating with local branches organized in all\r\nmanufacturing towns and cities. The national headquarters will act as a\r\nclearing house for the materials, facts, illustrations and demonstrations\r\nwhich the local centers collect and distribute and apply, proving that\r\ndemocracy works.\r\n\r\nEverything turns, in getting a thing done to-day, on seeing to it that\r\nthe people who take it up are the people who can best get the attention\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nThe consumer class cannot fail because they are the best people in the\r\ncountry to compel everybody to listen.\r\n\r\nThe consumers are the best people to get everybody to listen because they\r\nare the best listeners.\r\n\r\nThe consumers are the best people to start anything in America and keep\r\nit going because everybody in America cares what the consumers think,\r\nwants to be on good terms with them, and to please them, wants to be\r\nheard by them and wants to hear what they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE WAY FOR A NATION TO SPEAK UP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League is not visionary. The people of this country have\r\nexpressed an idea. They can do it again.\r\n\r\nNot long after the American part in the war was under way our Government\r\nhad the idea--which it had not had at all when it began--that if America\r\nwas going to do her part in defeating the Germans, or if we were to come\r\nanywhere near defeating the Germans, it would only be possible through an\r\nunexpected degree of self-sacrifice on the part of our people all day,\r\nevery day until the war was over.\r\n\r\nOur people did not believe this idea.\r\n\r\nHow could our Government get through to each man in America that winning\r\nthe war depended on him? Get through to each woman and each child that\r\nsomething must be given up by each of us to defeat the Germans? The\r\nGovernment not only wanted to advertise to the people how desperately the\r\ncountry needed them--every man of them--but it wanted also to inspire the\r\npeople and to let the people see their power themselves. They wanted to\r\nteach the nations nation-conscience, world-conscience, and prove to the\r\npeople and to the world how reverently the men, women and children of\r\nAmerica could be depended upon to respond to an appeal to defeat the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nI fell asleep in Maine one night not long ago, and woke up in the Grand\r\nCentral Station. I came out into that first gasolineless, dreamlike\r\nSunday we had during the war.\r\n\r\nA single, forlorn, drooping fifty-dollar horse, which I could have had\r\nfor a few minutes perhaps for a hundred dollars, greeted me.\r\n\r\nI mocked the driver a little, and walked on, feeling irreverent about\r\nhuman nature. I went over and stood and looked up Madison Avenue and\r\nlooked down Madison Avenue.\r\n\r\nI had come from communing with the sea, from communing with a hundred\r\nthousand lonely spruces, and I found myself upon what seemed to me the\r\nloneliest, the stillest, the most dreamlike place I had ever seen upon\r\nthe earth--a corner of Madison Avenue. It seemed like a kind of vision to\r\nstand and look up and down that great, white, sunny, praying silence. I\r\nlooked up at the sign on the corner. It really was Madison Avenue.\r\n\r\nIt was as if the hand of a hundred million people had reached out three\r\nthousand miles. It was as if a hundred million people had met me at the\r\ncorner and told me--one look, one silence: \"Here is this street we offer\r\nup that the will of God should go by. We are going to defeat the Germans\r\nwith the silence on this street.\"\r\n\r\nI stood and looked at the silent empty pavement crowded with the\r\ninvisible--a parade of the prayers of a mighty people; and it came over\r\nme that not only this one street, but ten thousand more like it, were\r\nreaching, while I looked, across the country. I saw my people hushing a\r\nthousand cities, making the thunder-thinking streets of Chicago, of San\r\nFrancisco and New York like the aisles of churches.\r\n\r\nThere was no need of church bells the first gasolineless Sunday,\r\nreminding one noisily, cheerily, a little thoughtlessly--the way they\r\ndo--that God was on the earth.\r\n\r\nOne could watch two thousand years turning on a hinge. But the first\r\ngasolineless Sunday--five hundred thousand miles of still roads lifted\r\nthemselves up under the sky on the mountains, out on the plains, saying\r\nfor a hundred million people, \"God still reigneth.\" And twenty million\r\nlittle birds stood on the edges of the trees and stared down at five\r\nhundred thousand miles of still white country roads wondering what had\r\nhappened!\r\n\r\nI cannot quite express, and never shall be able to, the sense I had when\r\nI waked up in the Grand Central Station that morning, when out of\r\ncommuning with the sea, with a hundred thousand lonely spruces, and out\r\nof the great roaring dark of the night I stepped into the street, into\r\nthe long, white silent prayer of my people--and prayed with a hundred\r\nmillion people its silent prayer for a world. I saw the mighty streets of\r\na nation, from Maine to California, lifted up as a vow to God.\r\n\r\nWe have learned one thing about ourselves and our attention during the\r\nwar. One gasolineless Sunday attracts more attention to this country, to\r\nthe great wager it had put up on whipping the Germans, than twenty-four\r\nfull page ads in a thousand papers could do.\r\n\r\nMr. Garfield may not have turned out to be a genius in mining coal, but\r\nin undermining the daily personal habits of a hundred million people--in\r\nadvertising to people wholesale, so that people breathe advertisement,\r\neat advertisement, make the very streets they walk on and the windows\r\nthey look out of into advertisements of the fate of their country, into\r\nprayers for a world--Mr. Garfield had few equals.\r\n\r\nTo advertise a religion or a war, stop the intimate daily personal habits\r\nof a hundred million people. Select something like being warmed or like\r\nbeing sweetened that does not leave out a mortal soul or slight a single\r\nstomach in the country.\r\n\r\nTo advertise history, to advertise the next two hundred years to a\r\nhundred million people--go in through the kitchen door of every house\r\nwith ten pounds of flour when they want twenty, with two pounds of sugar\r\nwhen they ordered eight.\r\n\r\nMake every butcher boy a prophet. Make people sip their coffee thinking\r\nof the next two hundred years. Make streets into posters. Make people\r\nlook out of their windows on streets--thousands of miles of streets that\r\nstretch like silent prayers, like mighty vows of a great people to defeat\r\nthe Germans!\r\n\r\nWe learned during the war that the way to get the attention of a hundred\r\nmillion people, the way to turn our own attention in America, the\r\nattention of our very cats and dogs to whipping Germany--was to interrupt\r\npeople's personal daily habits.\r\n\r\nThe way for a great free people to express an idea is to dramatize it to\r\nthe people to whom we are trying to express it.\r\n\r\nThe way for the American people to express our feelings to capitalists\r\nand laborers who seem to think we make no difference is to think up and\r\nset at work some form of dramatizing the idea in what we are doing, so\r\nthat the people we want to reach will look up and can forget us hardly an\r\nhour in the day.\r\n\r\nThe moral from America's first gasless Sunday for the American people, in\r\nexpressing themselves to business men who say they are serving us, is\r\nplain. I whisper it in the ears of a hundred million consumers as one of\r\nthe working ideas of the Air Line League.\r\n\r\nOur general idea of the way to deal with people who will not listen is\r\nnot to speak to them, but to do things to them that will make them wish\r\nwe would, do things to them that will make them come over and ask us to\r\nspeak to them. Let a hundred million people do something to the people\r\nwho take turns in holding us up, that will make them look up and wonder\r\nwhat the hundred million people think.\r\n\r\nThe true way to advertise is to make the people you advertise to, do it.\r\nTo get an idea over to the Germans do something to them that will make\r\nthem come over to us--come all the way over to us and extract it. The\r\nsame principle is going to be applied next by the Public Group in\r\nindustry. We will do something that will make them--capital and\r\nlabor--say: \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nThen let them study us and search us and search their own minds and find\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nWHAT EACH MAN EXPECTS OF HIMSELF\r\n\r\nG. S. L. TO HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nG. S. L. TO HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important and necessary things a man ever says sometimes, are\r\nthe things he feels he must say particularly to himself.\r\n\r\nIn what I have to say about this nation I have stripped down to myself.\r\n\r\nOf course any man in expressing privately his own soul to himself, may\r\nhit off a nation, because of course when one thinks of it, that is the\r\nvery thing everybody in a nation would do, probably if he had time.\r\n\r\nBut that may or may not be. All I know is that in this book, and in a\r\ngrave national crisis like this I do not want to tell other people what\r\nthey ought to do.\r\n\r\nA large part of what is the matter with the world this minute is the way\r\ntelling other people what they ought to do, is being attended to.\r\n\r\nI do not dare, for one, to let myself go. I am afraid I would be among\r\nthe worst if I got started joining in the scrimmage of setting everybody\r\nright.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three months, the more desperate the state of the world\r\ngets from day to day, the more I feel that the only safe person for me to\r\nwrite to or for me to give good advice to, is myself.\r\n\r\nI have always carried what I call a Day Book in my pocket and if anything\r\nhappens to my mind or to my pocket book--in a railway station, in a\r\ntrolley car, or on a park bench, or up on Mount Tom--wherever I am, I put\r\nit down--put it down with the others and see what it makes happen to me.\r\n\r\nAs the reader will see, the things that follow are taken out bodily from\r\nthis book to myself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I want to say deliberately before anybody goes any\r\nfurther and in order to be fair all around, this is a book or rather part\r\nof a book a hundred million people would write if they had time. It has\r\nbeen written to express certain things a hundred million people want\r\nduring the next four years from the next President, and with the end in\r\nview of getting them, I am bringing up in it certain things I have\r\nthought of that I would do, and begin to do, next week if I were the\r\nhundred million people.\r\n\r\nI do not think I could deny in court on a Bible, if driven to it, that if\r\nthe hundred million people were to sit down and write a book just now, I\r\nreally believe it would be--at least in the main gist and spirit of it,\r\nlike mine.\r\n\r\nNearly every man in the hundred million people--in what we call\r\nhelplessly \"the public group\" and looking on at strikes would be ready,\r\nexcept in his own strike, to write a book like this.\r\n\r\nI cannot prove this about my book, but the hundred million people can\r\nprove it and do something that will prove it.\r\n\r\nAnd the two great political parties in their coming conventions--one or\r\nboth of them, I believe, is going to be obliged to give them a chance to\r\ntry. But it is not up to me. Copying off this book is as far as I go with\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAnd the book is not to them. It is not even for them. This book is to me.\r\nI have been trying to save my soul with it in the cataclysm of a world.\r\nIt is easy and light-hearted, but take it off its guard every laugh is a\r\nprayer or a cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIF I WERE A NATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomics, I suspect, are much simpler than they look.\r\n\r\nThe soul of a people is as simple, direct and human in getting connected\r\nup with a body and having the use of a body, in this world, as a man is.\r\n\r\nWhy should I propose, if I were a nation--just because I am being a\r\nhundred million people instead of one, to let myself be frowned down as a\r\nhuman being, by figures, muddled by the Multiplication Table--by a really\r\nsimple thing like there being so many of me?\r\n\r\nI am human--a plain fellow human being--and if the United States would\r\nact more like me or act as practically almost any man I know would act,\r\nwhen it is really put up to him--forty nations in his yard waiting for\r\nhim to do what he ought to do, our present view of our present problem\r\nwould at once become direct and deep and simple.\r\n\r\nAll that is the matter with it is that so many Senates have sat on it.\r\n\r\nReduce it to its lowest terms, boil it down, boil even a Senate down to\r\none human being being human--boil it down to a baby even--and what it\r\nwould do would be deep, direct and wise. A baby would at least keep on\r\nbeing human and close to essentials.\r\n\r\nAnd that is all there is to it.\r\n\r\nThe other things that awe us and befuddle us all come from our not being\r\nas human as we are, from our being more like Senators and from being on\r\nCommittees.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe other day in Russia a thousand employees took their employer away\r\nfrom his desk, chucked him into a wheelbarrow at the door, rolled him\r\nhome through the crowds in the streets and told him to stay there.\r\n\r\nThe crowds laughed. And the thousand employees went back saying they\r\nwould run the factory themselves.\r\n\r\nA little while afterward, when the thousand employees had tried running\r\nthe factory without the employer they sent a Committee up to the house to\r\nask him to come back to his desk.\r\n\r\nHe told the Committee he would not return with them. He said that a\r\ncommittee could not get him. The thousand men had rolled him away through\r\njeers in the streets in a wheelbarrow, and now if the thousand men wanted\r\nhim they could come with their wheelbarrow and roll him back.\r\n\r\nThe thousand came with their wheelbarrow and rolled him back.\r\n\r\nThe crowds laughed.\r\n\r\nBut the thousand men and their employer were sober and happy--had some\r\nimagination about each other and went to work.\r\n\r\nIf I were a nation, the first question I would ask would be, \"Why bother\r\nwith wheelbarrows, and with being obliged in this melodramatic Russian\r\nway to act an idea all out in order to see it?\"\r\n\r\nIn America we propose to come through to this same idea by being human,\r\nby using our brains on our fellow human beings, by hoeing each other's\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nThe issue on which our brains have got to be used is one which grows\r\nlogically out of the two main new characteristic elements in our modern\r\nindustrial life.\r\n\r\nThese are the Mahogany Desk and the Cog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWHAT THE MAHOGANY DESK IS GOING TO DO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old employer in the days before machinery came in used to hoe in the\r\nnext row with his employee.\r\n\r\nThe next problem of industrial democracy consists in making a man at a\r\nmahogany desk with nothing on it, look to a laborer as if he were hoeing\r\nalongside him in the next row.\r\n\r\nTo get the laborer to understand and do team work a man must find some\r\nway of visualizing, or making an honest impressive moving picture of what\r\nhe does at his desk.\r\n\r\nA polished mahogany desk with nothing on it does not look very laborious\r\nto a laboring man.\r\n\r\nIn order to have democracy in business successful, what an employer has\r\nto do is to find a substitute for hoeing in the next row.\r\n\r\nHis workman wants to keep his eye on him, watch him hoeing faster than he\r\nis and see the perspiration on his brow.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the employer in other words to-day, is how to make his\r\nmahogany desk sweat. It really does for all practical purposes of course,\r\nbut how can he make it look so?\r\n\r\nIn the book a hundred million people would write if they had time, the\r\nfirst ten chapters should be devoted to searching out and inventing in\r\nbehalf of employers and setting in action in behalf of employers, on a\r\nmassive and national scale, ways in which employers can dramatize to\r\nworkmen the way they work.\r\n\r\nVery soon now, everywhere--much harder than hoeing in the next row--with\r\nthe sweat rolling off their brows, employers will sit at their desks\r\nhoeing their workmen's imaginations.\r\n\r\nThe other main point in the book the hundred million people would write\r\nif they could, would be the precise opposite of this one. I would devote\r\nthe second ten chapters I think, not to Mahogany Desks, or to the buttons\r\non them directing machines, but to Cogs.\r\n\r\nThe second great point the hundred million people will have to meet and\r\nwill have to see a way out for in their book, is the way a Cog feels\r\nabout being a Cog.\r\n\r\nIf a Cog in a big locomotive could take a day off and go around and watch\r\nthe drivewheel and pistons--watch the smoke coming out of the smokestack\r\nand the water scooping up from between the rails--watch the three hundred\r\nfaces in the train looking out of the windows and the great world booming\r\nby, and if the Cog could then say, \"I belong with all this and I am\r\nhelping and making it possible for all these people to do and to have all\r\nthis!\" And if the Cog could then slip back and go on just being a\r\ncog,--the cog would be being the kind of a cog a man is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nHe would be being the kind of a cog a man is supposed to be in a\r\ndemocracy-machine in distinction from a king-machine.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, if a Cog did this, or if arrangements were studied out for\r\nsome little inkling of a chance to do it, he would be making his job as a\r\nCog one third easier and happier and three times as efficient.\r\n\r\nA man is created to be the kind of Cog that works best when it is allowed\r\nto do its work in this way. God created him when He drove in one rivet to\r\nfeel the whole of the ship. It is feeling the whole of the ship that\r\nmakes being a Cog worth while.\r\n\r\nThe great work of the American people in the next four years is to work\r\nout for American industry the fate of the Cog in it.\r\n\r\nThe fate of democracy turns next on our working out a way of allowing a\r\nCog some imagination, or some substitute for imagination in its daily\r\nwork--something that the rest of the Cog--the whole man in the Cog can\r\nhave, which will bring his spirit, his joy and his power to bear on his\r\ndaily work.\r\n\r\nThis is the second of the two main points the hundred million people\r\nwould make in their book if they had time.\r\n\r\nThese two main points--getting labor to see how a mahogany desk\r\nsweats--getting the mahogany desk to put itself in the place of a Cog,\r\nknow how a Cog feels and what makes a Cog work--are points which are\r\ngoing to be made successfully and quickly in proportion as they are taken\r\nup in the right spirit and with a method--a practical human working\r\nmethod which so expresses and dramatizes that right spirit that it will\r\nbe impossible for people not to respond to it.\r\n\r\nI am not undertaking in this part of my book to make an inquiry as to\r\nwhat the right spirit is, or what the right method is that a hundred\r\nmillion people ought to adopt.\r\n\r\nI am a somewhat puzzled and determined person and I am instituting out\r\nloud a searching inquiry as to what I am going to do myself and what the\r\nprinciples and methods are that I should be governed by in doing my\r\npersonal part, and conducting my own mind and judgment toward the\r\nmovements and the men about me.\r\n\r\nTo avoid generalizing, I might as well give my idea the way it came to\r\nme--one man's idea of how one man feels he wants to act when being lied\r\nto.\r\n\r\nI do not say in so many words, I _was_ lied to. I do not know. A great\r\nmany people every day find themselves in situations where they do not\r\nknow. The question I am asking of myself is, how can a man or a public\r\ntake a fair human and constructive attitude when one does not know and\r\ncannot know for the time being, all that it is to the point to know?\r\n\r\nA stupendous amount of red-flagism, unrest and expensive unreasonableness\r\nwould be swept away in this country if we all had in mind to use for\r\nourselves when called for the following rules for being lied to.\r\n\r\n(Not that I am going to lumber people's minds up by numbering them as\r\nrules out loud. They are all here--in what follows--the spirit of them,\r\nand people can make their own rules for themselves as they go along.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nRULES FOR BEING LIED TO\r\n\r\n(Charles Schwab or Anybody)\r\n\r\n\r\n---- dropped in, in the rain the other night, and sat by my fireplace and\r\nsaid: \"Charles Schwab is the Prince of Liars. He says one thing about\r\nlabor and does another.\" He went on to say things he said other people\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThere are two courses of action to take about Charles Schwab's being the\r\nPrince of Liars.\r\n\r\nOne way is to expose what he says.\r\n\r\nThe other way is to help him make what he says true.\r\n\r\nI would rather do what I can to help Charles Schwab practice what he\r\npreaches than to stop his preaching.\r\n\r\nEverything turns for the American people to-day on being constructive, on\r\ndealing with facts as they are, on using the men we have, and on getting\r\nthe most out of the men we have.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of Charles Schwab throw around him expectation and\r\nmalediction and then let him take his choice.\r\n\r\nCharles Schwab in saying what he says about the new spirit in which\r\ncapital has got to deal with labor is rendering a great, unexpected,\r\nsensational and indispensable service to labor and to capital. It is a\r\npity to throw this public confession of capital to labor, and in behalf\r\nof labor away. It would be a still greater pity to see labor itself\r\nthrowing it away.\r\n\r\nIf I could let myself be cooped up as a writer in any one class in this\r\ncountry to-day, and if it were my special business to take sides with\r\nlabor, the thing I would try to do first with Charles Schwab, instead of\r\nundermining what he says and making what he says mean nothing--would be\r\nto cooeperate with him--back him up--back him up with the public--back him\r\nup with the stockholders and the people in his mills, until he makes what\r\nhe says mean three times as much.\r\n\r\nThen I would see to it if I could, that he says four times as much. I\r\nwould try, if I could, to keep Charles Schwab steadily at it, claiming\r\nmore and more for labor. Then catching up more and more to Charles\r\nSchwab, doing more and more, and compelling his partners to do more and\r\nmore of what he says.\r\n\r\nCharles Schwab has fifty or a hundred thousand or so partners, of\r\ncourse--stockholders he has to educate.\r\n\r\nThey have to be educated in public. He is not insincere because he has\r\nnot educated them all in a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGETTING ONE MAN RIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain facts which make me believe in Schwab as an asset for\r\nthe nation and for labor and capital both, that must not be thrown away.\r\nThere are all manner of facts about Schwab and his mills which I do not\r\nyet know which I could look up and use, but the most valuable facts to\r\nuse and use first, are facts anybody can get and get without looking up,\r\nby just sitting down and thinking.\r\n\r\nGetting one man right and being fair to one man is the way to begin to be\r\nfair to a nation.\r\n\r\nIf Charles Schwab is what ---- says he is, if Charles Schwab is doing or\r\nwinking while it is being done at the thing ---- says he is--he is an\r\nincredibly under-witted man--stupid about the public, about labor and\r\nabout capital--and, what is the most reckless of all--stupid in behalf of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt is rather a hard nut to crack--Charles Schwab's being stupid. I cannot\r\nunderstand why people--why a man like ---- would apparently rather\r\nbelieve that Charles Schwab is stupid than to believe that there must be\r\nsome other way of explaining him and of explaining what he has heard said\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nIf what ---- says is true about Mr. Schwab, he is not only a stupid man\r\nbut a ruined man.\r\n\r\nIn the colossal outbreak of public knowledge coming to us now, nothing\r\nwill be able to keep Charles Schwab from to-morrow on, from being a\r\nstupendous tragedy as long as he lives, and a by-word after he is dead.\r\n\r\nThe alternatives are:\r\n\r\nThe assertions about Mr. Schwab's real attitude toward labor are not\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIf true, they are qualified by facts and by delaying conditions for which\r\nall intelligent men whether identified with capital or labor would be\r\nglad to allow.\r\n\r\nIf true they are due to delegated authority.\r\n\r\nIf a large organization does not hand over authority it is inefficient.\r\n\r\nIf it does not make experiments with men and methods it is inefficient.\r\n\r\nIf it does not make a certain proportion of mistakes in its experiments\r\nwith men and methods its experiments are fake experiments.\r\n\r\nPeople who do things soon stop being harsh in judging people who do\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nGETTING FIFTY MEN RIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience is that extreme reactionaries and extreme radicals and\r\nreformers are the same kind of people turned around. Take any extreme\r\nradical and begin operating him other end to, and you have an extreme\r\nconservative. In the one thing that determines what a man amounts to and\r\nwhat a man does, viz.: his intuition and judgment with regard to human\r\nnature, extreme conservatives and extreme reformers are a marked people\r\nand make and have the habit of making singularly stupid, harsh and\r\nself-mutilating judgments of human nature. They are always getting wrong\r\nthe cold actual facts as to what particular people mean--what they are\r\nlike, and capable of being like and are soon going to show they are like.\r\n\r\nThe quick way to deal with the industrial situation is to expose the\r\nextreme reactionaries and the extreme radicals who have created it. The\r\nquick way to do this and to get the reactionaries and radicals to come to\r\nterms and get together, scatter their fear and their panic about one\r\nanother, bone down to team work, join with the rest on a big constructive\r\njob on the fate of the world, is to pick out certain strategic human\r\nbeings in business, see to it that the extremists on both sides are held\r\nup and held up close to the cold scientific facts about what these human\r\nbeings are, and what they mean, and what they are driving toward, by\r\nengineering experts in human nature and in interpreting human nature.\r\n\r\nThese personalities to unlock a nation with--to make a hundred million\r\nmen believe together and act together should be picked out, men like\r\nCharles Schwab everybody is looking at and men not looked at yet\r\neverybody ought to look at, and will like to look at when they know them.\r\n\r\nIntensive publicity extensively applied.\r\n\r\nThen with a printing press and a postage stamp multiply it by a hundred\r\nmillion. Make true beliefs about picked out men--typical men we have\r\nthousands of duplicates of, the daily habit of people's lives.\r\n\r\nIf the American people can come to know and interpret fifty men--if they\r\ncan get fifty sample men right--they will then be able to use these fifty\r\nmen every day of their lives as keys to unlock understanding with, unlock\r\nteam work with, with all the others. People will have something to work\r\nfrom and something to work toward, in judging what they can do with\r\nemployers and with workmen around them.\r\n\r\nThen we will have team work and civilization--we will have a democracy\r\nthe Germans would like to be asked to belong to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nENGINEERS IN FOLKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most gravely important, unbusinesslike and unscientific blunders\r\npeople make in economics, are their judgments of facts about people. The\r\nother facts than the facts about people--about how people feel and are\r\ngoing to feel inside, are comparatively accurate and obtainable.\r\nComparatively ordinary experts, or experts with rather routine training\r\nand education can deal with the other facts than the facts about people.\r\nThe facts about labor, capital and superproduction, that we fail to get\r\nmost, are the psychological facts about the way people are judging one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWe have strikes because on one side or the other, or both, people are off\r\non their facts about one another. One of the first things business men\r\nare going to generally arrange for is to have these facts about human\r\nnature, like all other engineering facts in business, dealt with by\r\nexperts--by the general recognition and employment of experts in human\r\nnature--of human engineers, of natural and trained interpreters of men to\r\none another.\r\n\r\nIf everybody will begin dealing to-morrow morning with people as they\r\nreally are, our economics in America will be as simple as a primer,\r\nbefore night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NEW PROFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nEn Route, New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R.\r\n\r\nJanuary 19, 1920.\r\n\r\nDined at the ----'s last night. Judge ---- was there. Two other lawyers.\r\nWe sat after dinner and talked very late.\r\n\r\nThree lawyers are too many for a dinner.\r\n\r\nI do not know what it is, but I never spend the evening with a lawyer,\r\nwithout talking back to him in my mind all the next day.\r\n\r\nProbably, if at this late date I were picking out what I would be in the\r\nworld, and had to be one thing rather than another, I would pick out\r\nbeing a lawyer backwards.\r\n\r\nThe usual standard idea of what a lawyer is, is that he is an expert in\r\nconducting people's fights for them.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that the whole thing should be turned around and that in the\r\nspecial state the world is in just now, a new profession should at once\r\nbe started--a profession in which any man who went into it, would be\r\noccupied in being a lawyer backwards.\r\n\r\n(I think this would be perhaps the best way to put it because to most\r\npeople, being a lawyer backwards is inspiring to think of--because\r\neverybody would see--a whole nation would see all in one unanimous\r\nminute, just what the new profession I have in mind would be like.)\r\n\r\nEverybody knows about lawyers. They are always being advertised by the\r\nthings they do and get the rest of us to do. The most conspicuous\r\nad.--their huge national international display ad. just now of what a\r\nlawyer is like--of just how nice being a lawyer backwards would be, is\r\nthe United States Senate.\r\n\r\nIt would be the most alluring spectacle we could have in America to most\r\npeople, if we could have the spectacle in our country of two or three\r\nhundred thousand men being lawyers backwards--two or three hundred\r\nthousand men stationed strategically in ten thousand cities, as experts\r\neverybody went to, to keep them out of fights.\r\n\r\nYou see a man's sign up over his door and you go in and pay him a fee, or\r\npay him so much a year for making you love your enemies. And of course he\r\nwill change your enemies some for you in spots so that you can put it\r\nover. Then by putting in a little touch here and there on you perhaps, it\r\nis not impossible he will make your enemies love you.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that this idea should be presented to people not for what it\r\nis worth--not as a high moral idea or as a spiritual luxury but as a\r\nplain practical every day convenience in our world as it is, for getting\r\nthe things done one wants to do, and for getting what one wants.\r\n\r\nIf I were hiring a man to help me get what I want out of other people and\r\nif I had my choice between hiring a man who is a skilled expert in making\r\npeople understand me and hiring a man who is a skilled expert in making\r\npeople afraid of me, it would not take me long to say which would be the\r\nmore practical thing for me to do.\r\n\r\nIf I could go down town and engage a man at so much a year who would be\r\nan expert in making me understand myself and in making me make fun of\r\nmyself, so that I could get myself into fairly good shape for other\r\npeople to understand, it would be still more practical.\r\n\r\nI would soon find myself after the first few seances with the man I was\r\nhiring to sit down with me and be a lawyer backwards to me--I would soon\r\nfind myself having things done to me that would be so plain, so pointed,\r\nso sensible, so scientific and matter of fact and thorough that I would\r\nbe able in a minute to cut down to the quick with any man I met,--cut\r\ndown to the quick and get what I wanted on any subject I took up, because\r\nnobody could fool me, because I couldn't even be fooled by myself.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long it is going to take but I do know that if the\r\nworld is going to be reformed it is going to be by men who--either by\r\ndoing it personally, or by hiring somebody else to help them do it, have\r\nreformed themselves.\r\n\r\nMy own personal observation is, so far, that when I set out to see things\r\nagainst myself I seem to need somehow, a great deal of assistance.\r\n\r\nIn such a naturally disagreeable mussy job of course, instead of going to\r\nmy friends, to people one goes out to dine with, I feel there ought to be\r\nsome regular professional person one could go to, some more noble refined\r\nsort of spiritual hired man--make an appointment by telephone, go down to\r\na room down town on the way to one's office and then just as a plain\r\nmatter of course be done off for the day, be done over, be put in shape\r\nfor one's fellow human beings to get on with.\r\n\r\nThen one could go out into the midst of the people and keel over a world.\r\n\r\nAfter one had hired some one to be a lawyer backwards to one and got used\r\nto it, one would soon be in shape to go to one's employers and let them\r\nput in some touches, go to one's employees, go to anybody and everybody\r\nright and left. One would soon get so that one could learn something from\r\neverybody. One would take points even from relatives.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty in a thing like this would be one that would come at\r\nthe start, the difficulty of getting people to look upon undergoing the\r\ntruth about themselves, respectfully and seriously and like an operation.\r\n\r\nNo amateur or friend could get anybody started. The only way to begin is\r\nto have some special expert to go to, some special expert with a long\r\nstring of notable moral patients, men who have succeeded in business by\r\nseeing through themselves more, and seeing through themselves quicker and\r\noftener than other people do. You hear of some especially good man who is\r\nbeing a lawyer backwards practicing regularly with great success. You\r\nobserve his patients from day to day and see how the truth works. Then\r\nyou go down to his office, plank down your money and get the truth.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe trouble with truth from friends and relatives is that even when they\r\ntell it, nobody pays for it. Most people neither take the truth nor\r\nanything else in this world seriously if it is free. People get more, the\r\nmore they want it. And the more they want it, the more they show it by\r\nwanting to pay for it.\r\n\r\nThis is why I suspect that being a lawyer backwards will have to be a\r\nregular profession. There is going to be a tremendous demand for going\r\ndown town and getting a disagreeable truth, the moment people see how\r\ngoing down and getting one and digesting one makes one get on with people\r\nin one's work.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers who are hired to fight out for him, a man's lies about\r\nhimself, will soon be crowded out of business by the lawyers who free a\r\nman from himself, who knock a man out from a kind of cramp or neuritis of\r\nhimself and present him a world with the truth.\r\n\r\nThis idea should be presented to people just as plain common sense.\r\nPeople should not be asked to take it up not as an ideal but as an\r\noperation. If a man goes down town to hire a doctor to tell him how he\r\nhas got to eat in order to live, why should he not go down town to a\r\nman's office and hire him to tell him what he has got to be like in order\r\nto have any one willing to let him live?\r\n\r\nWe have operations on all our other inner organs. The things that are\r\ndone to us at these times are usually to say the least intensely personal\r\nand intimate things. And if people will let themselves be cut open and\r\noperated on so that they can eat, why should there not be men--hundreds\r\nof thousands of men everywhere in offices, people can go to to be\r\noperated on so that they can earn something to eat? Nine out of ten of\r\nthe things that keep people from earning a living as they should or as\r\nthey might, are truths against themselves that have never been operated\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nGETTING PEOPLE TO NOTICE FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing the man in the White House for the next four years is\r\ngoing to have to face is the problem of dealing with people as they\r\nreally are.\r\n\r\nIf I were writing a book for the next president to run for president on,\r\none of the first things I would put into it would be a definite statement\r\nof what the president and the government proposed to do and what policy\r\nthey proposed to adopt to keep Labor and Capital from being off on their\r\nfacts about each other.\r\n\r\nThere are two policies to choose from.\r\n\r\nFirst Policy: Have Capital tell Labor what is the matter with Labor, and\r\nhave Labor tell Capital what is the matter with Capital. (Results:\r\nStrikes heaped on lockouts and lockouts heaped on strikes.)\r\n\r\nSecond Policy: Turn the whole truth-telling policy around.\r\n\r\nThe way to make a truth count is to get the utmost possible attention to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe way to get the utmost possible attention to a truth is to have people\r\none does not expect it from telling it. The way to advertise the sins of\r\nCapital is to have Capital tell them. Employers and capitalists can\r\nattract twenty times as much attention in telling things that are the\r\nmatter with them, and will be believed forty times as much. And they not\r\nonly can tell the facts against themselves more fairly, but while they\r\nare telling the facts against themselves they are in a position to change\r\nthem. They can tell facts against themselves with one hand and change\r\nthem with the other. Or they can begin changing them--begin getting labor\r\nto help them change them.\r\n\r\nIf I had to save the world in a week or rather get assurance in a week\r\nthat it could be saved, I would get all the people in it to agree for a\r\nyear to read each other's papers. Have every man read two papers. We\r\nwould start up for America the national Parallel Column Habit. Each man\r\nby himself daily putting his own little world and other people's world\r\nalongside until they got used to it, and then together.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to what reading the wrong papers would not do for this\r\nnation. It is not a matter to argue about. It is a mere plain matter of\r\nfact in ordinary every day psychology. The veriest tyro in human\r\nengineering can see it,--that the way to get a truth noticed about\r\nCapital or Labor, the way to make a truth of some use and get it believed\r\nand acted on, is to have the wrong people tell it.\r\n\r\nJudge Gary could say some of the things Mr. Gompers is saying a great\r\ndeal better than Mr. Gompers could.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I am going to do when I put this up to the people. I\r\nam not going to let them think I am putting it up to them as a Christian.\r\nThe way to introduce the idea is to speak as a plain practical engineer\r\nin folks and in the way human nature works. I don't know as I would mind\r\npeople having fine religious feelings about it, when they did it, if they\r\nliked, but I would prefer to call it and prefer to introduce it as\r\nsimple, plain, hard-headed publicity.\r\n\r\nThe most natural quick universal short-cut to peace, to different groups\r\nof people in America getting their facts right and getting them quick and\r\ndealing with each other as they really are, is to have people go around\r\nin America from now on, telling truths everywhere, who have just got\r\nthem--people the truths look prominent on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE FOOL KILLERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gist of the labor problem simmers down to our making some adequate\r\nuniversally understood provision, generally resorted to by everybody as a\r\nmatter of course, for people's not being fooled about themselves.\r\n\r\nIf people do not fool themselves nobody else can fool them.\r\n\r\nAnd they do not go around fooling others.\r\n\r\nThe next thing employers and employees who are being fooled by themselves\r\nand who are trying to fool one another, are going to observe, is that\r\ntheir competitors in their own industry--the employers and employees in\r\ntheir own industry who are not fooled by themselves and who are not\r\ntaking time to fool one another, are producing more, cheaper and better\r\ngoods than they can.\r\n\r\nThings that take years to straighten out, straighten out in weeks when\r\npeople on both sides who have stopped fooling themselves, get together\r\nand look at the facts over each other's shoulders. All that is necessary\r\nis to get the thing started--looking at the facts over each other's\r\nshoulders. People who do not want to start to look at facts in this way\r\nshould call in a specialist until they do.\r\n\r\nLabor human nature is not one kind of human nature and capital human\r\nnature another. They both believe on both sides what they want to, unless\r\nthey go to a specialist and get a practical, matter-of-fact, profitable\r\nhabit started of making a deliberate, desperate effort not to.\r\n\r\nThe world is not being run from day to day by the truth. It is run by\r\nwhat people believe is the truth. It is what the I. W. W. extremists\r\nbelieve is the truth, which constitutes the important fact--the fact\r\nwhich has to be looked up, considered and seriously dealt with. The truth\r\nabout Judge Gary's attitude or Charles Schwab's, toward labor unions,\r\nmakes no difference if nobody believes it, or if the labor unions don't\r\nbelieve it. As long as the labor unions are fooling themselves and\r\nbelieving what they want to believe, the only serious matter of fact way\r\nto deal with them is to consider how they manage to do it. The\r\nfundamental thing that is the matter with people is that they are off on\r\ntheir facts about themselves and believe what they want to about\r\nthemselves. Naturally having begun with this they branch out and believe\r\nwhat they want to about anybody.\r\n\r\nTo this end in our present industrial deadlock, the first thing we have\r\nobviously got to make provision for in modern American life, is\r\npractically a new profession--regular professional persons everywhere in\r\nall cities, and in all the different industries and in the highly\r\nspecialized groups each with their special and different techniques, who\r\nare experts in saving people from the consequences to themselves and\r\nothers of believing what they want to about themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE WHISPERERS\r\n\r\n\r\nA very considerable proportion of the things that labor unions are in the\r\nhabit of saying against their employers, the employers lock their office\r\ndoors and sit down and whisper to one another against themselves.\r\n\r\nA very considerable proportion of the thing that employers are in the\r\nhabit of saying against their workmen, the workmen of the more efficient\r\ntype are whispering around to one another against themselves.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help thinking what it would mean, in our present industrial\r\ndeadlock, if the people who are whispering would shout, and the people\r\nwho are shouting would shut up.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it does not matter so much what the shouters shout.\r\n\r\nThe first moment the shouters suspect what the whisperers are\r\nwhispering,--the whisperers on the other side--they will stop shouting to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nThe whole industrial situation narrows down to this,--might be put into\r\ntwo words by a hundred million people to-day, to Capital and Labor, \"Swap\r\nWhispers!\"\r\n\r\nThe tumult and the shouting die.\r\n\r\nIt is with the whisperers, we will save the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nMR. DOOLEY, JUDGE GARY AND MR. GOMPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal that we have a new profession--a group of specialists to go\r\nto, to straighten out our souls so that we can get on with other people\r\nand be competent in business, comes to one's mind at first perhaps as a\r\nkind of good humored, whimsical way of treating a serious and almost\r\ntragical subject. But something has made me want to begin my idea in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn strained situations between people--situations in which one sees\r\npeople getting all worked up and fine, noble and wild-eyed about\r\nthemselves, I am not so sure but that the best, most pointed, most\r\nimmediate and thorough thing that can be done, is for some one--some one\r\nwho feels like it, to start up a little, mild, good-natured and careless\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nTo start up something careless even for a minute, whether it laughed or\r\nnot, would be practical.\r\n\r\nMr. Dooley in our present tightened up hysterical situation between\r\nCapital and Labor, could really do more than Savonarola.\r\n\r\nAnd Life could do more than the Christian Register. It was not frivolous\r\nin Abraham Lincoln in the deepest and most tragic hour this nation ever\r\nhad, to try to make way with his Cabinet, for his Emancipation\r\nProclamation, by introducing it with Artemus Ward. It was the pathetic\r\nhumanness, the profound statesmanship of the loneliest man of his time,\r\nin the loneliest moment of his life smiling his way through to his God.\r\n\r\nI am not sure but that if Peter Finley Dunne could have been appointed on\r\nthe President's Industrial Conference and could have got off some nice\r\ncosy relaxed human little joke just in the nick of time--just as Mr.\r\nGompers and his Labor Children like so many dear little girls said they\r\nwould not play any more, took their dollies and their dishes and went\r\nhome--stuck their heads up and majestically walked from the room--if Mr.\r\nDooley and Hennessy could have been present and got in a small deep\r\nlighthearted human word, all in one half minute the President's\r\nConference might have been saved.\r\n\r\nThe broad every day human fact about the Conference was, that seen from\r\nthe point of view of God or of common people, many of the men in\r\nit,--most of the men in it, for the time being, were really being very\r\nfunny and childish about themselves. So far as the public could see\r\nthrough the windows, the only real grown-ups in the Conference who\r\nconducted themselves with dignity, with serenity, with some sense of fact\r\nabout human nature and humor, some sense of how the Conference would look\r\nin a week, were the men in The Public Group. There were doubtless lively\r\nand equally disconcerning individuals in the Capital group and the Labor\r\ngroup, but they were voted down and hushed up, and not allowed to look to\r\nthe public outside, any more like intelligent fellow human beings than\r\ncould be helped.\r\n\r\nThe President's Conference, at that particular moment, like our whole\r\nnation to-day, had worked itself up into a state of spiritual cramp--a\r\nstate in which it did not and could not make any difference what anybody\r\nthought, and nobody had the presence of mind at the moment apparently, or\r\nthe willfulness of love for his kind, or the quickness to do what Lincoln\r\nwould have done, slip in a warm homely joke that would have got people\r\nstarted laughing at one another until they got caught laughing at\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gompers and the labor people with tragic and solemn dignity, as\r\nif they were making history and as if a thousand years were looking on,\r\nwalked out of the room, I do not claim that if they had met Oliver\r\nHerford or Mr. Dooley in the hall, they would have come back, but I do\r\nclaim that if some one just beforehand had made a mild kindly remark\r\nrecalling people to a sense of humor and to a sense of fact, Mr. Gompers\r\nand the labor group would have found it impossible to be so romantic and\r\ngrand and tragic about themselves, they would have seen that the ages\r\nwere not noticing them, that they were off on their facts, that they were\r\nnot making history at all, or that the history they were making would all\r\nhave to be made over in a week. They had the facts wrong about the\r\ncapital group, and wrong about the public group, and like dear little\r\ngirls were believing in their dear little minds what they thought was\r\nprettiest, about themselves.\r\n\r\nOf course it is only fair to say that Capital, while it did not do\r\nanything so grand, was probably responsible for the grandeur of Labor's\r\nemotions and actions, and was equally believing what it wanted to believe\r\nabout itself.\r\n\r\nWith Capital not yet grown up--not yet really capable (as the really\r\nmature have to be in the rough and tumble of life) of making a creative\r\nuse of criticism,--incapable of self-confession, self-discipline and of\r\nmaking fun of itself, it naturally follows that with Labor in the same\r\nundeveloped state, the President's Conference was mainly valuable as a\r\nnational dramatization,--a rather loud and theatrical acting out before\r\nan amazed people of the fact that Capital and Labor in this country as\r\ninstitutions were as petulant, as incapable, as full of fear,\r\nsuperstitions and childishness about one another as the monotonous\r\nstrikes and lockouts they have dumped on us, and made us pay for forty\r\nyears, had made us suspect they were!\r\n\r\nFor forty years Capital and Labor have taken out all the things that\r\nbothered them, their laziness in understanding one another, their moral\r\ngarbage, their moral clinkers, tin cans and ashes, and dumped them in\r\nwhat seems to them apparently to be a great backyard on this\r\nnation--called The Public. And we have carted it all away and paid for\r\ncarting it away without saying a word.\r\n\r\nThere are three courses we can take in the Public Group now.\r\n\r\nWe can try to discipline Capital and Labor into producing together by\r\npassing laws and heaping up embarrassments and penalties.\r\n\r\nWe can let them see how much better they can make things by sticking them\r\non to one another and letting them discipline one another.\r\n\r\nWe can make fun of both of them quietly to themselves, keep\r\nquiet-hearted, matter of fact, full of realism, humor, relaxation and\r\nnaturalness and deal with Capital and Labor as Lincoln would, by getting\r\nlaughing and listening started.\r\n\r\nThen let them laugh at themselves.\r\n\r\nAmerica should arrange to have Judge Gary, Mr. Dooley and Mr. Gompers get\r\ntogether on a desert island and face things out.\r\n\r\nA great deal of capital in this country--especially the best of it, is\r\nalready seeing, and already acting on facts about itself it has not\r\nwanted to believe. It is already seeing that it cannot carry off with\r\nLabor or with the Public any longer the idea of looking pure and noble,\r\nstanding before people in a kind of eternal moral-Prince-Albert coat,\r\none's hand in one's bosom, and with the same old pompous-looking face,\r\nwithout looking ridiculous. It is seeing that it would rather laugh at\r\nitself, in a pinch, than to have other people laughing at it, that the\r\nonly thing left to it to do now is to get serious, scientific and\r\neconomic, smile at its airs with Labor and the public, and lay them\r\naside.\r\n\r\nIf Capital sees how it really looks, laughs at itself, goes in quietly\r\nfor self-criticism, self-confession and self-discipline, Labor will.\r\n\r\nIf Labor does it, Capital will.\r\n\r\nWhichever side does it first, and does it best,--does it in the most\r\nhuman, attractive and contagious way will find a hundred million people\r\nhanding over to it the power and the leadership of the country.\r\n\r\nTo whichever side it comes first, to show the most shrewdness, the most\r\nfearlessness, the most generosity in seeing facts against itself, will\r\ncome the honor of the first victory.\r\n\r\nThe first victory either side will be allowed by the people, is its\r\nvictory over itself.\r\n\r\nPeople in this country who are not fooled by themselves, who are capable\r\nof self-criticism, self-confession and self-discipline, can have anything\r\nthey want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nFOOLING ONESELF IN POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same thing that everybody can see is going to happen in business in\r\nthis country from now on--the pushing forward--the victory over all\r\nothers in business of the men who are not fooled about themselves is\r\ngoing to be seen happening ten times over in politics.\r\n\r\nThe leading symptom of the mood of the people, the magnificent blanket\r\npolitical secret that covers all the other secrets of the coming\r\nconventions and elections, the dominating fact of the next man's next\r\nfour years in The White House, is the thing that is going to be done by\r\nthe people from to-day on, to politicians who are fooled about\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOne has but to mention one or two and a nation sees it.\r\n\r\nAny little natural impression my fellow citizens may have had at the\r\nbeginning of this article that in putting forward my idea of being a\r\nlawyer backwards, or the idea that we must all practice at being lawyers\r\nbackwards to ourselves, I am putting forward just a gay pleasant\r\nthoughtlet, instead of a grave and pressing national issue, an issue on\r\nwhich the fate of a people is at stake, fades away when one really begins\r\nto think of how the idea would really work out if tried on particular\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nEverybody can pick out his own of course, but I am inclined to believe\r\njust at the moment, that if there was a good man everybody in this nation\r\nknew of who was being a lawyer backwards--say in New York or London--a\r\nman who had a big practice and who had a fine record in bracing men up to\r\nfight themselves and not to be fooled about themselves, the man that most\r\npeople in this country would like to take up a national collection for,\r\nhave sent to him and done over at once, no matter what it cost, would be\r\nHenry Cabot Lodge.\r\n\r\nFor six long weary months now, the main and international fact America\r\nand the world have had to get up and face every morning is the way a man\r\ncalled Henry Cabot Lodge is being fooled by himself.\r\n\r\nNinety-nine million out of a hundred million people can see,--their very\r\ncats and dogs can see, and the little birds in the trees in Washington\r\ncan see, that the main particular uncontrollable force that grips Henry\r\nCabot Lodge in a vise all day every day for six months is his desire to\r\nmake Woodrow Wilson ridiculous, to set Woodrow Wilson down hard in a\r\nlonely back seat of the World.\r\n\r\nBut Henry Cabot Lodge does not see what the cats and dogs of a hundred\r\nmillion people and the little birds in the trees see about Henry Cabot\r\nLodge. He does not see what it means about himself, that he trembles like\r\nan aspen leaf from soul to stern when the thought of Wilson crosses his\r\npale mind, that he has to go to bed for an hour after anybody mentions\r\nWilson's name to him, and that all that has really happened to him or to\r\nthe world after all is that he--Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, has\r\ntaken the one single elemental dammed up (and not unnatural) desire to\r\nsit Woodrow Wilson down hard and made a great national and international\r\nemotion out of it--every day one more morning he gets out of bed,\r\nelevates his own private emotion into a transfiguration--into a great\r\nnational stained-glass window for the Monroe Doctrine, sees twenty\r\ngenerations like attendant angels hovering around him--around Henry Cabot\r\nLodge in the Window, like Saint George with the dragon, blessing him for\r\nsaving Columbia from being crunched in the wandering fire-breathing jaws\r\nof a prowling League of Nations!\r\n\r\nIt is the most stupendous spectacle in the most stupendous and public\r\nmoment of the world, of sheer romanticism and sentimentality, of one\r\nsingle man with God and forty nations looking on, prinking his soul\r\nbefore the twisted mirror of himself that could be conceived.\r\n\r\nIt would be of no use to argue--not even for a hundred million people to\r\nargue with Henry Cabot Lodge, because what they would really have to do\r\nto argue to the point would be not to argue about Henry Cabot Lodge's\r\nidea about the subject, but about Henry Cabot Lodge's idea of himself.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass--a nation confronted with a man whom none can stop, a\r\nman who believes what he wants to believe about himself, a man\r\nmagnificently obsessed--a man holding himself ready any minute of any day\r\nin the year, following the bogey of his wraith of Wilson to the precipice\r\nof the end of the world, with forty nations in his pocket, jumps off....\r\n\r\nWho would have believed that a man who was writing history, who was\r\nmeasuring off calm perspectives of things to happen, and little leagues\r\nof nations of his own twenty years ago--who would have believed that a\r\nman with a proud, controlled and cultivated mind could let his mind in\r\nthis way be seized from the sub-cellar of its own passions and its own\r\ndesires, and at the expense of his party, to the humiliation of his\r\nnation and the weariness of the world, let itself be warped into a\r\nnational, into an international helplessness like this?\r\n\r\nMy own feeling is that the best possible use of Henry Cabot Lodge at the\r\npresent moment is as a national symptom, as a lesson in the\r\npsycho-analysis of nations, a suggestion of what nations that want to get\r\nthings, must look out for and from, be on the lookout for next, and from\r\nnow on, in the men they choose to get them.\r\n\r\nThe ways in which great employers and labor unions are being fooled about\r\nthemselves at the expense of all of us, in the industrial world, are\r\nmatched on every side in the world of politics.\r\n\r\nThe personal trait of great political as well as industrial value for\r\nwhich the people of this country are going to look in the men they allow\r\nto be placed over them--the men they give power and command to, is the\r\nquality in a man of being sensitive about facts, especially facts in\r\npeople. What we are going to look for in a man is having an engineering\r\nand not a sentimental attitude toward his own mind and the minds of\r\nothers. We are going to give power and place to the man who has a certain\r\neagerness for a fact whatever it does to him, who has a certain\r\nsuppleness of mind in not believing what he wants to. The man we are\r\ngoing to look past everybody for and pick to be a President or a Senator\r\nafter this, is the man who is not hoodwinked or polarized by his own\r\nparty or by his own class, who is not fooled about himself, who keeps\r\nwithout swerving, because he likes it and prefers it, to the main trunk\r\nline of the interests of all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nSWEARING OFF FROM ONESELF IN TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the new profession of being a lawyer backwards is established, and\r\nbefore very many offices have really been opened up where one can go in\r\nand have one's mind changed ten dollars' worth instead of having it\r\npoured, soothed and petted, a good many of us are going to find it\r\nnecessary to practice on ourselves and in a humble way as amateurs, do\r\nany little odd jobs we can on ourselves at home.\r\n\r\nWe nearly all of us have it in us--we the hundred million people--to be\r\nlike Henry Cabot Lodge, on a less national scale, any minute.\r\n\r\nI say over to myself breathlessly between these very words while I write\r\nthem down about Henry Cabot Lodge, that beautiful thought John Bunyan\r\nhad, \"Except for the grace of God\" a wife, five friends and a sense of\r\nhumor, there goes Gerald Stanley Lee!\r\n\r\nI have made myself say this over practically every day while writing this\r\narticle (I have had to write it), and when I was in the same town Henry\r\nCabot Lodge is, last week, saw him snooping around the Senate, so pure\r\nand high and from the Back Bay, so serene in his courtly chivalrous dream\r\nabout himself, I got taken up every time--I do not deny it--on the same\r\nmonotonous big beautiful wave of feeling superior followed by the same\r\nmonotonous sweeping, sinking undertow of humbleness, and then I would\r\nstand there (He is my own Senator) with his pass for The Senate in my\r\npocket ... I would stand and watch him,--watch him walking through the\r\nlordly corridors quoting over to myself that same beautiful thought John\r\nBunyan had about the murderer, \"Except for the grace of God there goes\r\netc., etc.\" Everybody fill in for himself!\r\n\r\nThe essential fact in any fundamental workable truth about human nature\r\nis that all the people who have any are very much alike. The best we can\r\ndo about it--most of us--is to recognize the fact that in spite of the\r\nthought of the people it mixes us up with, the best of us probably are\r\ngoing to be fooled about ourselves, and that the only practical working\r\ndifference between us in the end is that some of us have caught ourselves\r\nin the act more often than others, have wrought out a livelier, more\r\ndesperate self-consciousness, and have made rather elaborate and regular\r\narrangements, perhaps,--when something in us starts us up into being\r\nLodges,--for catching up to ourselves and for swearing off from ourselves\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nHere is Charles Evans Hughes for instance, who from the day he was born\r\nhates a Socialist from afar off,--a man who never had in his younger days\r\nperhaps, like some of us, a streak of being one, and yet the first thing\r\nCharles Evans Hughes does before anybody can say Jack Robinson, the very\r\nfirst minute he reads in his paper that the New York Assembly has refused\r\nto give their seats to five Socialist members because they are\r\nSocialists, is to be a lawyer backwards to himself, with a big national\r\njerk draw his national self together, and before the country is half\r\nwaked up at breakfast the next morning, we have the spectacle of an act\r\nof sympathy and protest on behalf of American Socialists from the last\r\nman most people would think it of, an open letter insisting that the\r\nnarrow partisans of the Assembly itching with superiority, sweating with\r\npropriety, sitting in a kind of ooze of patriotism in their great Chamber\r\nin Albany, should take the Socialist members they had waved out of the\r\nroom simply for belonging to the Socialist party, and conduct them back\r\nto their seats as the accredited representatives (until proved\r\nindividually unfit) of citizens of the United States and let them sit\r\nthere as a national exhibit of the way in which a great and free people,\r\nwho are believing in themselves every day, can believe in themselves\r\nenough to listen to anybody, to make regular arrangements in Albany and\r\neverywhere as a matter of course for listening to people with whom they\r\ndo not agree, without fear and without frothing at the mouth.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes is as anxious to do anything he can during one lifetime to\r\ndiscourage Socialism as Henry Cabot Lodge is to discourage Woodrow\r\nWilson, but the reason that the American people have been glad to have\r\nCharles Evans Hughes as Justice of the Supreme Court, the reason that\r\nthey came within three inches of making him President of the United\r\nStates is that in an eminent degree he is a man who has made elaborate,\r\nconclusive and habitual arrangements with his own mind for not being\r\ndeceived by Charles Evans Hughes, for being a lawyer backwards, for\r\nfighting himself, for stepping up out of being a mere lawyer and sitting\r\nsternly on the Bench of the Supreme Court, against himself.\r\n\r\nOf course I am not writing this article to point out to a hundred million\r\npeople with this fountain pen of mine dripping in its sins, how superior\r\nI and a hundred million other people are to Henry Cabot Lodge and to the\r\nway for the last six months he is mooning about in his mind and being\r\ninternationally fooled about himself. The special point I seek to make is\r\nthat as we are all in danger on one subject or another, of breaking out\r\ninto millions of Lodges any minute, that we should make the most of our\r\nnew national chance of our power as a people just now--just before the\r\ntwo great national conventions of the parties to which we mostly belong,\r\nto make deliberate and national arrangements to be on our guard against\r\nourselves, to see to it that we nominate and elect to The White\r\nHouse,--from whatever walk of life he comes,--a man who will have himself\r\nmagnificently in hand, a man who will not trickle off before the people\r\ninto his own private temperament, pocket himself up in his own class, or\r\nput down the lid of his own party gently but firmly over his soul--a man\r\nwho will be the President of all the people everywhere all the time.\r\n\r\nWhen the members of The Bar Association of the City of New York who\r\nbacked Mr. Hughes, were presenting to the world, our slowly enlightened\r\nworld, the spectacle of several hundred lawyers rising to the occasion\r\nand being lawyers backwards to themselves, it probably would not be fair\r\nto divide off crudely the sheep from the goats, and to say that those who\r\nvoted to back Mr. Hughes were, and those who did not, were not equally\r\nexposed to being fooled about themselves. Mr. Hughes and his followers\r\nwere probably men who are more on their guard, who have regular and\r\nstanding arrangements with themselves against themselves and who acted\r\nmore quickly than others in this case in the way they should wish they\r\nhad acted in three weeks, three years or three lifetimes.\r\n\r\nIn the extraordinary struggle our nation is now making in the next four\r\nyears to justify democracy--to justify the power of the human spirit to\r\nbe free, generous, noble and just in self-government, the power of men of\r\ndiffering classes, of differing groups and interests to live in orderly\r\ngood will and mutual understanding together, until we make at last a\r\ngreat nation together in the sight of nations that say we cannot do\r\nit,--all this is going to turn for this country, not upon our not being a\r\nblind people, or on our not being a prejudiced people, or upon our not\r\nbeing full of the liability to be deceived about ourselves, but on what\r\nwe do about it when we are, upon our making arrangements beforehand for\r\nseeing through ourselves in time, upon our putting forward men to\r\nrepresent us who shall not be demagogues, who shall lead us as we are,\r\nwith clear eyes to what we are going to be, men who shall lead us by\r\nopening our imaginations by touching, or our vision instead of petting us\r\nin our sins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE FOR NOT BEING FOOLED BY ONESELF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next twenty-eight pages of this book might be entitled: \"An Article\r\nthat Expected to Appear in the _Saturday Evening Post_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the twenty-eight pages, which had been conceived and written to be\r\nread in this way, were completed, they were too late to submit to the\r\n_Post_, and too late to change.\r\n\r\nThe reader is therefore requested to bear in mind (as I do) that he is\r\ngetting the next eleven chapters for nothing--that they have not been\r\npaid for and it can only be left to people's imaginations whether the\r\n_Saturday Evening Post_ would approve or believe what I believe, or\r\nfeel hurt if other people believe it.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that before the new profession of being a lawyer backwards\r\nis started we shall all try in the present crisis of the nation, doing\r\nwhat we can as amateurs, putting in at once any little odd jobs of\r\ncriticism on ourselves which may come our way, brings up the whole matter\r\nof an amateur technique for not being fooled by oneself.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to talk pleasantly about a man's power of\r\nself-criticism or of self-discipline as the source of ideas, as a secret\r\nof increased production in factories, or power over others in business,\r\nand as a general rule for success whether in trade or in statesmanship, I\r\nsay it is, but what is there anybody can really do after all about having\r\nor exercising this power of self-criticism?\r\n\r\nIf the readers of the _Saturday Evening Post_ were to come to me in a\r\nbody in this part of my book and ask me what there is, if anything,\r\nthey--the readers of the _Saturday Evening Post_ can do, and do now to\r\nacquire a technique--a kind of general amateur technique for not being\r\nfooled about themselves, I am afraid I would have a hard time in holding\r\nback from giving good advice. Even at this moment without being asked at\r\nall, I have a faint hopeful idea--I feel it at this moment floating about\r\nmy head--a kind of nimbus of wanting to tell other people what they ought\r\nto do about not being fooled by themselves. But I have ripped the Thing\r\noff. I cannot believe that only this far--in a few pages or so about it,\r\nI have made people's not being fooled by themselves alluring enough to\r\nthem. It has occurred to me that perhaps if I want to have people in this\r\ncountry really allured by the prospect of not being fooled by themselves,\r\nthe best thing for me to do is to pick out some man in the country\r\neverybody knows who is especially lacking in a technique for not being\r\nfooled by himself--some one man all our people have a perfect\r\npassion,--almost an epidemic of not wanting to be like, and try to make\r\nmy idea alluring with him.\r\n\r\nNaturally of course I have picked out Mr. Albert Sidney Burleson of\r\nAustin, Texas, Postmaster Imperturbable of The United States.\r\n\r\nIt is true that other readers of the _Saturday Evening Post_ besides\r\nMr. Burleson might have been picked out. But everybody knows Mr.\r\nBurleson. Everybody writes letters. Mr. Burleson is the great daily\r\ncommon intimate personal experience of a hundred million people.\r\nEverybody who puts letters into Mr. Burleson's Post Office--everybody who\r\nwaits for his letters to get to him after Mr. Burleson is through with\r\nthem, must feel as I do, that Mr. Albert Sidney Burleson of Austin,\r\nTexas, as a kind of national pointer to this nation of things that other\r\npeople do not want to have the matter with them, could hardly be\r\nexcelled.\r\n\r\nI am using Mr. Burleson gratefully for a few moments as an example of\r\nthree things of personal importance to all amateurs interested in the\r\ntechnique of self-criticism.\r\n\r\n1st. What Mr. Burleson could get out of criticizing himself.\r\n\r\n2nd. What Mr. Burleson could get out of letting other people criticize\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3rd. How he could get it. Technique and illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the autobiography of a letter trying to work its way through from\r\nPhiladelphia to Northampton, Massachusetts, could be written down--if all\r\nthe details of just what happened to it slumped into corners on\r\nplatforms--what happened to it in slides, in slots and pigeon-holes, in\r\nmail bags on noisy city sidewalks, in freight cars on awful silent\r\nsidings in the night, in depots, in junctions--if all the long story of\r\nthis one letter could be written like the Lord's Prayer on a thumb nail\r\nand could be put in that little hole of information stamped on the\r\nenvelope--what is it that the little autobiography of the letter would do\r\nto Albert Sidney Burleson?\r\n\r\nThe autobiography of one letter put with millions of others like it every\r\nday, put with flocks of letters from along the Ohio, from along the\r\nMississippi, from the Grand Canyon, the Tombigbee and the Maumee, waving\r\ntheir autobiographies across a nation from Maine to California, would\r\npoint to Albert Sidney Burleson and with one great single wave of\r\nunanimity all in a day, would put him out of his office in Washington by\r\nten-thirty A.M., start him off from the station by his own rural parcel\r\npost to Austin, Texas, before night.\r\n\r\nI say by rural parcel post because he would probably arrive there quicker\r\nthan if he were sent like a mere letter.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that if one were trying to think up some way in these present\r\nquarrelsome days, of making a hundred million people all cheerful all in\r\na minute, all sweet and harmonious together, the most touching, the most\r\nnational thing the hundred million people could be asked to do would be\r\nto take up gently but firmly and replace carefully in Austin, Texas, the\r\nmost splendidly mislaid man, at the moment anyway, this country can\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nBecause Mr. Burleson is the kind of man who believes what he wants to\r\nbelieve and who keeps fooled about himself.\r\n\r\nAn entirely worthy man who had certain worthy parlor store ideas about\r\nhow money could be saved in business, made up his mind that if he was\r\nplaced by the people at the head of the people's Post Office, he would\r\nsave their money for the people instead of running their Post Office for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis is all that has happened. This was Mr. Burleson's preconception of\r\nwhat he was for and what a Post Office was for and not a hundred million\r\npeople could pry him out of it. Mr. Burleson ran his Post Office to suit\r\nhimself and his own boast for himself, and the people naturally in being\r\nsuited with their Post Office had to take anything that was left over\r\nthat they could get after Mr. Burleson was suited with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Burleson has had a certain hustling automatic thoughtless conception\r\nof Albert Sidney Burleson and what he is like and what he can do, and so\r\nfar as anyone can see he has not spent three minutes in seven years in\r\nthinking what other people's conceptions of him are.\r\n\r\nI am as much in favor as any one of saving money in a Post Office. But I\r\nwant my letters delivered, and I feel that most people in America would\r\nagree with me that the main thing we want from a Post Office is to have\r\nit, please, deliver our letters for us.\r\n\r\nIf the manuscript of this article, which is sure to be rushed at the last\r\nminute and which should plan to leave New York for Philadelphia Wednesday\r\nnight and be (with a special delivery stamp on it) in Philadelphia in the\r\ncompositor's hands on Thursday morning--should take as has happened\r\nbefore, from one and a half days to two days or three days (with its\r\nspecial ten cents on it to hurry it) to get there, what would any one\r\nsuppose I would do?\r\n\r\nOf course I could ask to have the article back a week and put in another\r\ncolumn on Mr. Burleson.\r\n\r\nBut I am not going to. Mr. Burleson and the readers of the _Post_ are\r\nboth going to get out of that extra column.\r\n\r\nI am going to do what I have done over and over before.\r\n\r\nInstead of mailing as one would suppose this manuscript at nine o'clock\r\nWednesday evening and having it in the compositor's hands the next\r\nmorning with eight cents for postage and ten cents for special delivery,\r\nI am going to go down to the Pennsylvania Station in the afternoon at six\r\no'clock, with my eighteen-cent letter in my hand, buy a three dollar\r\nticket to Philadelphia for it, hire a seat in the Pullman for it, hire a\r\nseat in the dining-car for it, put it up at the Bellevue-Stratford for\r\nthe night and then go out and lay it on the editor's desk myself in the\r\nmorning, see it in his hand myself and get a receipt from his eye.\r\n\r\nThen I am going to pay my letter's bill at the Bellevue-Stratford, buy a\r\nthree dollar ticket to New York and a place in the Pullman for myself, G.\r\nS. L. on return, as the human envelope Mr. Burleson has required me to\r\nbe, ship myself back to New York as the empty, as the container this\r\narticle came in, and one more intimate painful twelve dollars and\r\nthirty-seven cents worth of an eighteen-cent experience with Albert\r\nSidney Burleson will be over.\r\n\r\nLast time I did this I was early for my train at the Pennsylvania Station\r\nand walked out at the Eighth Avenue end, looked up wistfully at Mr.\r\nBurleson's new Greek Palace he puts up in when he comes to New York and I\r\ncame with deep feeling upon the following Beautiful Emotion Mr. Burleson\r\nhas about himself--four or five hundred feet of it, in letters four feet\r\nhigh all across the top.\r\n\r\nNEITHER SNOW NOR RAIN NOR HEAT, NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT STAYS THESE COURIERS\r\nFROM THE SWIFT COMPLETION OF THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS.\r\n\r\nOf course I realized in a minute that this was said by Herodotus, or\r\nHomer or somebody, and was intended as a courteous reference probably to\r\ncamels and not as would be supposed to Burleson and his forty thousand\r\nmighty locomotives hurrying his orders up and down three thousand miles\r\nof sunsets across the land.\r\n\r\nBut I must say that what Herodotus claimed for the camels when I read it\r\nas I did that day in huge marble letters four feet high from Thirtieth to\r\nThirty-second Street, seemed just a little boastful for Mr. Burleson as I\r\nstood there and gazed at it holding tight my letter in my hand I was\r\nspending twenty-four hours and twelve dollars to keep him from mailing\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE MAN FIFTY-THREE THOUSAND POST OFFICES FAILED ON\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I find when I am writing in a national magazine,\r\ntrying to express myself on an idea I would like to believe but do not\r\nwant to be fooled about, to four or five million people. I can not help\r\nfeeling that out of all these four or five million people, at the very\r\nleast anyway there really must be three million and five hundred thousand\r\nwho are being very much less fooled about me and about my idea than I am.\r\nEvery day as I sit down to write one more chapter I try to catch up to\r\nthem. Of course anybody can see I am not equal to it, but it does give\r\none a chance, and it gives the book a chance before I am through, to have\r\nsome sense in it.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking what Albert Sidney Burleson, who has a hundred\r\nmillion people to choose from, who has millions of people who are less\r\nfooled about him than he is, to catch up to every day, after all these\r\nseven long years they have put on him, ought to amount to.\r\n\r\nAnd what his Post Office ought to amount to.\r\n\r\nOf course we are all human and know how it is, in a way. We know that the\r\nfirst thought that would come to Mr. Burleson as to any man when he finds\r\nhe is being criticized--that people in fifty-three thousand Post Offices\r\nare criticizing him and acting with him as if he were fooled about\r\nhimself, is the automatic thought of self-defense. The second thought,\r\nwhich is what one would hope for from a General, even a Postmaster\r\nGeneral, is that one resents it in oneself, that in an important opening\r\nfor a man like being called foolish, one stops all one's thinking-works,\r\nand slumps ingloriously, automatically and without a quaver into\r\nself-defense.\r\n\r\nOne would think a man who could get to be a Postmaster General would have\r\nthe presence of mind when he says \"Ouch!\" to a nation that steps on his\r\ntoes, to fix his face quick, smile and say, \"Thank you! Thank you! I will\r\nsee what there is in this!\"\r\n\r\nWhy should a man when God is blessing him as he does Mr. Burleson, even\r\nout of the mouths of his enemies, butt in in the way he does and\r\ninterrupt truths with enough juice in them to make one Burleson, even one\r\nBurleson into twenty great men before a nation's eyes?\r\n\r\nA whole Cabinet--at least a whole Democratic Cabinet--could have been\r\nmade time and time again out of the great-man-juice, the truth-pepsin\r\ngreat men are made out of, this country has wasted on Burleson in the\r\npast seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF BEING FOOLED ABOUT ONESELF\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to give a diagnosis of this quite common disease, touch on\r\nthe causes and see how they can be removed.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be, speaking roughly and as far as my own observation of\r\npsychology goes, six main ways in which the average man is fooled about\r\nhimself and needs to change his mind about himself.\r\n\r\nHe is possessed with loco-mindedness or spotty-mindedness, sees things as\r\nthey look to one kind or group of people--sees things in spotlights of\r\npersonality, of place or time--all the rest black.\r\n\r\nOr he suffers from what one might call Lost-Mindedness--is always getting\r\nlost in anything he does, somewhere between the end and the means. He\r\neither loses the means in contemplating with unholy contemplation the\r\nend, like an idealist, or he loses the end in contemplating the means.\r\n\r\nThe Habit of Flat-Thinking--of not thinking things out in four\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nThe Habit of Evaporated Thinking. If I were to generalize in what I have\r\nto say about men who are fooled by themselves instead of rounding my idea\r\nout with some particular man everybody knows, like Mr. Burleson for\r\ninstance, it would be evaporated thinking.\r\n\r\nThe Habit of Not Having any Habits--leaving out standardized elements in\r\nthings and not being machine-minded enough.\r\n\r\nAutomatism, or Machine-Mindedness.\r\n\r\nThese six forms of being fooled by oneself all boil down in the end--in\r\ntheir final cause, I suspect to the last one, to automatism or lack of\r\nconscious control of the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nLOCO-MINDEDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nLoco-mindedness in a Post Office consists in Mr. Burleson's running the\r\nPost Office for one kind of people--the kind of people he has noticed.\r\n\r\nThere are supposed to be various kinds of people who use a Post Office.\r\n\r\nThere are the people who write hundreds of letters a day--letters that\r\nare being waited for accurately and by a particular mail--like telegrams.\r\n\r\nThere are people who sit down with a pen and a piece of paper, stick out\r\ntheir tongues and chewing on one end of the pen, and slaving away and\r\nsweating ink on the other, scrooge out a letter once in three weeks that\r\nthey have put off six months.\r\n\r\nI have no grudge against these people, but it seems to me that running a\r\nPost Office exclusively for them as Mr. Burleson does, is a mistake. Even\r\nif they constitute ninety-eight per cent of the people, they only mail\r\none-tenth of one per cent of the letters. They may not care whether or\r\nnot their letters arrive as a matter of course, the way they used to in\r\nour Post Office until a little while ago, as accurately as telegrams in\r\ntheir first mail in the morning, but probably they would not feel hurt if\r\nthey did. But millions of people in business who write scores or hundreds\r\nof letters a day, who find themselves being put off with a Post Office\r\nthat is run apparently for people who write two letters a month, are\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nIn Northampton, Massachusetts, the letter from New York one used to\r\nreceive at breakfast, hangs around a junction somewhere now, waits for a\r\nletter three hundred miles away--a letter from Pittsburgh to catch up to\r\nit, and they both come together sweetly and with Mr. Burleson's smile on\r\nafter luncheon at half past two in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that from the narrower business point of view of running a\r\nPost Office the way some women would run--or rather used to run a parlor\r\nstore--with a bell on the door, there is something to be said for Mr.\r\nBurleson's philosophy. Nor do I deny that a store can be run and run\r\nsuccessfully and rightly on how much of its customer's money it can save\r\non each purchase.\r\n\r\nBut the point is that if I go into a store in Northampton and cannot get\r\nthe things I want there I go into some other store.\r\n\r\nI cannot go out from our Post Office in Northampton and go over and get\r\nwhat I want at some other Post Office a little further down the street.\r\n\r\nWhen I and people in fifty-three thousand Post Offices, say Aouch! Mr.\r\nBurleson says Pooh!\r\n\r\nBusiness correspondence between Washington and New York which used to be\r\na twenty-four hour affair is now half a week.\r\n\r\nLetters thousands of men in New York used to receive in their offices in\r\nthe early morning before interviews began and when they had time to read\r\nletters and to jot an answer to them at the foot of the page, are not\r\nreceived and placed before them for their answers until the late morning\r\nor early afternoon when they have other things to do and cannot even read\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo one's letters wait over a day--a night and a day, or until one gets\r\nback from Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhy is it Mr. Burleson takes millions of dollars' worth a day out of the\r\nconvenience, out of the profit and out of the efficiency of business in\r\nAmerica and then with a huge national swoop of compliment to himself\r\npoints out to people how he has saved them fifty cents?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that Mr. Burleson charges us a thousand dollars apiece, in our\r\nown private business, to save us fifty cents apiece in public?\r\n\r\nWho asked him to?\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are people in America who really prefer to do\r\nbusiness at a puttering kind of a store no matter how much time it costs\r\nthem. They take naturally to a cash and carry store or to a store that\r\nlovingly saves one forty cents' worth of money by taking four dollars'\r\nworth of one's time.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that some people want a cash and carry freight-car\r\nPost Office and want Mr. Burleson to save their money for them. Millions\r\nof people would make more money by not having their Post Office save\r\nmoney for them. Mr. Burleson insists his business is to save people's\r\nmoney for them whether they can afford to have him save it or not.\r\n\r\nThe first cause of Mr. Burleson's being fooled about himself is that he\r\nis spotty-minded about people, the fact that he has been running the Post\r\nOffice with reference to one special slow canal-minded kind of America.\r\nHis mind is jet black about all the rest.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Burleson is not the only one of us in America who is\r\nloco-minded or spotty-minded in business, who is running his business\r\ninto the ground by noticing only one kind of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nFLAT-THINKING\r\n\r\nTHINKING IN ME-FLAT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nature seems to have really intended, is that human beings should do\r\ntheir thinking in four dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe thickness is what I think.\r\n\r\nThe breadth is what other people think.\r\n\r\nThe length is what God thinks.\r\n\r\nThen when a man has taken these three and put them together and sees them\r\nas a whole, that is to say when I have taken what I think, and what I\r\nthink other people think, and what I think God thinks, and put them\r\ntogether as well as I can, the result is--who I am and what I amount to.\r\n\r\nMost people tend most of the time, unless very careful, to think in the\r\nfirst or \"I think\" dimension, stop on the way to God in the \"I think\"\r\nthickness, and get lost in it, or they get lost in the \"They Think\"\r\nbreadth, lost in what other people think and never get to God at all.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the Post Office has been that Mr. Burleson likes to\r\nthink in the first or \"I think\" dimension, does not care what other\r\npeople think and skips right past them straight to God.\r\n\r\nProbably it would be unfair to say that the Post Office is egotistical,\r\nself-centered, sitting and looking at its own navel full of the bliss and\r\nself-glorification of Mr. Burleson's being the Hero of economy and\r\nwinning his boast of saving the money of the people, but it does seem as\r\nif it would cool off the Post Office some in its present second-rate\r\nbusiness idea--its idea of freeing the letter-making business from doing\r\nanything more for the people than can be helped--if Mr. Burleson would\r\nstop and sit down and have a long serious think about what fifty thousand\r\nPost Offices think.\r\n\r\nThere have been days--with my half-past two letters when if I had Roger\r\nBabson's gift for being graphic I would have charted Mr. Burleson's Post\r\nOffice like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                    |-----|\r\n                    |     |\r\n                    |     |\r\n                    |     |\r\n                    |     |\r\n                    |     |\r\n                    |     |\r\n                    |     |\r\n      |-----|       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |       |-----|\r\n      |     |       |     |       |     |\r\n      |     |       |     |       |     |\r\n      |-----|       |-----|       |-----|\r\n        U.S.           ME           The\r\n        P.O.                       People]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nLOST-MINDEDNESS\r\n\r\nOR LOSING THE END IN THE MEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have wanted, before dropping the causes of people's being fooled about\r\nthemselves, to dwell for a moment on lost-mindedness, or losing the end\r\nin the means.\r\n\r\nTo avoid evaporated thinking or generalizing I am illustrating my idea\r\nonce more from Mr. Burleson as the great common experience of all of us\r\nwhich we daily have together, Mr. Burleson makes us see so many things\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI wish something could be done to get our Postmaster General to sit down\r\nseriously with a two-cent stamp and look at it and study it.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to me that Mr. Burleson has ever thought very much about\r\nthe two-cent stamp, that he quite understands what, in a country like\r\nthis, a two-cent stamp means.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then when I take one up and hold it in my hand, I look at\r\nit before putting my tongue to it and think what a two-cent stamp\r\nbelieves. It has come to be for me like a little modest seal for my\r\ncountry--like a flag or a symbol. A two-cent stamp is the signature of\r\nthe nation, the tiny stupendous Magna Charta of the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nAs an elevator makes forty stories in a sky-scraper as good as the first\r\none, the two-cent stamp represents the right of one town in this country,\r\nso far as the United States is concerned, to be as convenient and as well\r\nlocated as another. Three miles or three thousand miles for two cents.\r\n\r\nIn physical things it is true that America because it cannot help it has\r\nto put a penalty on a man in Seattle for being three thousand miles from\r\nNew York, but so far as the truth is concerned, so far as thinking is\r\nconcerned, it costs a man no more to think three thousand miles than to\r\nthink three. The country pays for it for him.\r\n\r\nAmerica tells people millions of times a day on every postage stamp that\r\nit is the thought, the prayer, the desire of this country to have every\r\nman, no matter where his body is held down in it or how far his freight\r\nfor his body has to be sent to him, as near in his soul to Washington as\r\nRock Creek Park and as near to New York as Yonkers.\r\n\r\nThe two-cent stamp is the Magna Charta of the spiritual rights, the\r\npatriotic forces and the intellectual liberties of the people and when\r\nAlbert Sidney Burleson, of Austin, Texas, by establishing a zone system\r\nfor ideas, for conveying the ideas of the great central newspapers and\r\nmagazines in which a whole nation thinks together--with one huge national\r\nthoughtless provincial swish of his own provincial mind coolly takes ten\r\nthousand cities that like to do their thinking when they like, in New\r\nYork or in Philadelphia, Washington and Chicago, jams them down into\r\ntheir own neighborhoods, glues them to their own papers, tells all these\r\nthousand of cities that they have got to be, no matter how big they are,\r\nvillages in their thinking, cut off from the great common or national\r\nthinking, Mr. Burleson commits a wrong against the unity, the\r\nsingle-heartedness and great-mindedness of a great people struggling to\r\nthink together and to act together in the welter of our modern world, the\r\npeople will never forget.\r\n\r\nWhy in a desperate crisis of the world when of all times this nation has\r\ngot to be pulled together, should people who are accustomed to taking a\r\nbird's-eye view of the nation like the _Literary Digest_ be fined for it?\r\nWhy fine the readers of the _Review of Reviews_ or _Collier's_ or\r\n_Scribner's_ for living in one place rather than another? I like to think\r\nof it Saturday night, half the boys of a nation three thousand miles\r\nreading over each other's shoulders the same pages together in the\r\n_Youth's Companion_.\r\n\r\nEvery man is entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness--that\r\nis to life, to the liberty to live where he wants to and to the happiness\r\nof not being fined for it.\r\n\r\nA man's body by reason of being a body has to put up with the\r\ninconvenience of not being everywhere, but his soul--what he knows and\r\nfeels and believes and sees in common with others, has a right not to be\r\ntold it cannot see things the rest of us are seeing all together, has a\r\nright not to be told he will have to read something published within a\r\nrim of five hundred miles of his own doorbell--that his soul has got to\r\nlive with a Seattle lid on, or a Boston lid on.\r\n\r\nAs a symbol of the liberty and unity of the people in this country, the\r\nflag is pleasant of course to look at, and it flourishes a good deal, but\r\nit does not do anything and do it all day, every day, the way the little\r\nhumble pink postage stamp does, millions of it a minute, to make people\r\nfeel close to one another, make people act in America as if we were in\r\nthe one same big room together, in the one great living-room of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThere is not anything it would not be worth this people's while to pay\r\nfor making men of all classes and of all regions in this country think\r\nand hope and pray together in the one great living-room of the\r\nnation--some place where three million people act as one.\r\n\r\nIt is what we are for in this country to prove to a world that this thing\r\ncan be done, and that we are doing it, to have some place like a great\r\nnational magazine where three million people can show they are doing it.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr. Albert Sidney Burleson, of Austin, Texas, steps up to a great\r\nnational magazine, a great hall where a nation thinks the same thought,\r\nholds a meeting once a week together like the _Saturday Evening Post_,\r\nlike _Collier's_--dismisses two or three million people from everywhere\r\nwho get together there every Saturday night, and tells them to go home\r\nand read the _Hampshire County Gazette_.\r\n\r\nIt is not a worse case perhaps of lost-mindedness or of losing the end in\r\nthe means than the rest of us are guilty of, but with such an inspiring\r\nexample of what not to do, and of how it works to do it--to lose the end\r\nin the means, I have to mention it--not in behalf of Mr. Burleson, but in\r\nbehalf of all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not intended to illustrate my idea of amateur technique in\r\nself-criticism quite so much with Mr. Burleson, especially as I stand for\r\na bi-partisan point of view. I wish there were some way of dealing with\r\nMr. Burleson as a Republican for fifteen minutes and then as a Democrat\r\nfor fifteen minutes, and in dealing as I am, in what might be called a\r\nnationally personal subject, a technique for self-criticism in all of us,\r\nI only hope my Democratic friends will give me credit for making use of\r\nMr. Burleson not as a Democrat (it is just their luck that he's a\r\nDemocrat), but as a specimen human being I am trying to get hundreds of\r\nthousands of Republicans that are just like him, not to be like any\r\nlonger. I have only used our Postmaster General in this rather personal\r\nfashion because he is so close and personal to us, because in a time when\r\nwe are all in peculiar danger of being fooled by ourselves he\r\nconstitutes, in plain sight a kind of national Common Denominator of the\r\nsins of all of us.\r\n\r\nWe are all concerned. We all want to know.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to say pleasantly as if it settled something that the\r\nreason Mr. Burleson keeps doing things and keeps picking at most people\r\nso through fifty-three thousand Post Offices day after day, all day, and\r\nnight after night, all night, is that he is fooled about himself.\r\n\r\nBut why? What are the causes and the remedies people in general can look\r\nup and have the benefit of? When we are being fooled about ourselves,\r\nwhen we believe what we want to believe, and are not willing to change\r\nour minds about ourselves, what is there we can do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nSELF-DISCIPLINE BY PROXY\r\n\r\n\r\nMy own experience is that my own faults really impress me most when I see\r\nthem in other people.\r\n\r\nI cannot help feeling hopefully that out of the five or six million\r\npeople who are supposed to read a national magazine, there may be a few\r\nscattered hundred thousands who will catch themselves suspecting they may\r\nhave moments of being like me in this.\r\n\r\nSelf-discipline sets in, as far as I can make out, in most of us in a\r\nrather weak and watery way--that is: we usually begin with seeing how\r\nunbecoming other people make our faults look. Then we begin disciplining\r\nour faults in other people, get our first faint moral glow, and then\r\nbefore we know it, having once got started chasing up our faults in other\r\npeople we get so interested in them we cannot even leave them alone in\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nDisciplining other people in itself as an object almost never does any\r\ngood. Mr. Burleson is not going to get anything much out of this article,\r\nbut I am the better man for it, and there are others, a million or so\r\nperhaps, who are helping me chase up our faults in him, who will chase\r\nthem back to their own homes from the Post Office.\r\n\r\nThere are few of us who do not have, certain people, certain times, and\r\ncertain subjects, with which we can be trusted to be unerringly fooled\r\nabout ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd when we consider how Albert Sidney Burleson has missed his chance,\r\nwhen we consider what he could have got out of fifty-three thousand\r\nwistful silenced Post Offices in the way of pointers in not being fooled\r\nabout himself, we cannot but take Mr. Burleson very gravely and a little\r\npersonally. We cannot but be grateful to Mr. Burleson in our better\r\nbusiness moments as America's best, most satisfactory, most complete\r\nexhibit of what is the matter with American business.\r\n\r\nI leave with the reader the Thought, that probably the majority of men\r\nwho have been watching Mr. Burleson for seven years wasting fifty-three\r\nthousand Post Offices, and all the fifty-three thousand Post Offices\r\ncould do for him to make a successful man out of him, will go down to\r\ntheir offices next Monday morning, and instead of worming criticism out\r\nof everybody in sight, instead of using their business and everybody who\r\napproaches them in the business to produce goods, will use the business\r\nto produce the impression that they are perfect and that nobody can tell\r\nthem anything--will just sit there all glazed over with complacency\r\ncemented down into their self-defending minds, imperious, impervious, as\r\nhard to give good advice to, as hard to make a dent in as beautiful\r\nshining porcelain-lined bathtubs.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIt would be only fair and would save a good deal of time in business for\r\nsome of us who like to try new ideas, if there were some way of telling\r\nthese men--if some warning could be given to us not to bother with\r\nthem--if these men with brilliantly non-porous minds, could be fitted up\r\nso that one could tell them at sight--by their heads looking the way they\r\nare--by their being bald--by their having brilliantly non-porous\r\nheads--just nice perfectly plain shiny knobs of not-thinking.\r\n\r\nOne could tell them across a room.\r\n\r\nBut the man with the most refreshingly eager mind toward new ideas, I\r\nknow, the mind the most brilliantly open--which fairly glistens inside\r\nwith eagerness, glistens outside, too.\r\n\r\nThe only thing there is to go by, in telling a man with a non-porous\r\nmind, is to try gently--changing it, and see what happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nMACHINE-MINDEDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various forms I have mentioned of the malady of being fooled by\r\noneself, all practically boil down to one in the end--one cause which we\r\nhave to recognize and avoid--automatism, the lack of conscious control of\r\nthe mind--letting oneself be rolled under the little wheels in one's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe main central cause operating with people when they are being fooled\r\nabout themselves, is machine-mindedness.\r\n\r\nA man's body being a great storehouse of psycho-mechanical processes and\r\nhabits makes his mind react automatically, and when some one calls him a\r\nfool or acts with him as if possibly he might have moments of being\r\nfooled about himself, the man's whole nature like a spring snaps his mind\r\nback into self-defense, and instead of being grateful and thoughtful as a\r\nrational or second-thought person always is, he lets his subconscious\r\nself take hold of him, tumtum him along into showing everybody how\r\nperfect he is.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows how it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nNEW BRAIN TRACKS IN BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking roughly, there are two kinds of men who are markedly successful\r\nin business--the men who give people what they want, and the men who make\r\npeople want things they have thought they did not want before. Moving\r\npictures, watermelons, pianolas, telephones, forks, flying machines and\r\nlocomotives, appendicitis, Christianity and chewing gum, umbrellas and\r\neven babies--have all been brought to pass by convincing other human\r\nbeings that they do not know what they want, by a process which is\r\nessentially courting, that is: by a combination of fighting and affection\r\nwhich arrests, holds and enthralls people into adding new selves to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI confess to a certain partiality for men who get rich by making people\r\ndifferent because I am an evolutionist and the chances are that anything\r\nyou do to most people that makes them different, improves them.\r\n\r\nBut comparisons are irrelevant and I am not willing to back down from my\r\ngood opinion of American human nature in business and admit that men who\r\nprosper by making people want telephones, or things they have not wanted,\r\nare the business superiors of men who prosper by just piling up on people\r\nmore and more and better--things they want already.\r\n\r\nThe superior business man is the man who has a superior knowledge of\r\nhimself, who searches out and uses the gift he is born with in himself\r\nand who gets other people to use theirs. Because it happens that I am an\r\ninventor, or what is called an artist, and because though I cannot\r\nremember, without the slightest doubt, I began, to advertise that I was\r\nhere, or about to be here, before I was born, and because I would be\r\nbored to death handing out to people things I know they want, or\r\npresenting to people truths they merely believe already, it would be\r\nshallow for me to say that the men in American business who do not make\r\npeople want things, and who just heap up on them what they want, are not\r\nsuccessful men, are not equally important, equally essential to the state\r\nand are not doing for themselves and others just what the country, if it\r\nwas a wise country and was around asking people to do things, would ask\r\nthem to do.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that in the present new tragic economic\r\ncrisis with which all kinds of business men, whatever they are like, are\r\nbeing brought sharply face to face at a time when new brain tracks in\r\nbusiness are especially called for--a time when practically millions of\r\npeople have got to have them and use them whether they want to or not, I\r\nhave thought it would be to the point to consider in the chapters that\r\nfollow, what new brain tracks are like, how they work, and what people\r\nwho have been accustomed not to have new brain tracks or to find them\r\nawkward, can do to get them and to make them work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE FOR A NATION'S GETTING ITS WAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBIG IN LITTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nA nation, in order to be a safe nation for itself, or safe for other\r\nnations in this world, must have a technique for getting and for getting\r\na world to want it to get--its own way.\r\n\r\nI am interested in a technique for a nation's getting its way and\r\ndeserving to get its way because I want to get mine, and because being\r\nhuman and having quite a good deal of human nature taken out of the same\r\nstuff--out of the same mixed hot and cold ingredients as other people's,\r\nI have quite naturally come to think that what works for me, if I cut\r\ndown to the quick and am honest with myself, in getting what I want, will\r\nprobably, with proper shadings, of course, work for anybody.\r\n\r\nI have thought I would see if I could not work out in this book, a\r\ntechnique which could be used modestly by one man, tried out in miniature\r\nas it were--a technique for getting and deserving to get one's own way.\r\n\r\nI pick out one man, to try out the principle on, because it is safer and\r\nfairer to try out a principle other people are supposed to be asked to\r\nrisk, on one man first.\r\n\r\nBecause I happen to know him better than I know anybody else, and because\r\nmy experience is, he will stand more from me than anybody else, I have\r\npicked out myself.\r\n\r\nWhen the technique has been tried out on one man the people who know him\r\nwill believe it and try it. Then we will try it on one hundred men one\r\nafter the other. Then as I have been working it out in this book, try it\r\non the body-politic, the soul and body of a nation, try it on a hundred\r\nmillion people.\r\n\r\nThen with a technique for having a body and for not being fooled by\r\nourselves and having some substance in what we say and what we do, we\r\nwould have the spectacle of a hundred million people making themselves\r\nfelt in political conventions, making themselves felt in The White House\r\nand even being noticed perhaps in time at the other end of Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue by the great I AM, or I CAN'T, or I WON'T tucked under the come of\r\nall of us--called The United States Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCONSCIOUS CONTROL OF BRAIN TRACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience is that the first thing for me to attend to and know, in\r\ngetting people to let me have my way, is to know when and how to discover\r\nand open up in people new brain tracks and when and how to make my main\r\ndependence on their old ones.\r\n\r\nGetting what one wants from people turns on seeing the situation--the\r\nbrain track situation in one's own mind at a particular time, and in\r\nother people's, as it really is.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the way to get one's way with people is to know and\r\nextend one's consciousness down deeper into one's subconsciousness in\r\none's own mind, so that one draws on the conscious and the subconscious\r\nin one's own mind at will, so that gradually having the habit of drawing\r\non the conscious and the subconscious in one's own mind at will, one soon\r\nmakes oneself master of the conscious and the subconscious in the minds\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nI do not precisely know this, of course, because I have never practiced\r\nhaving my own way with other people as much as I would like, but my\r\ntheory and my observation of others who have practiced on me leads me, in\r\nspeaking for all of us to believe this: The way for a man to do who wants\r\nto get his own way with people is to heighten his consciousness, deepen\r\nhis consciousness down into his subconsciousness, live more abundantly in\r\nsoul and body, deeper down and higher up and further over into himself\r\nthan others. Then he gets his way with others because everybody wants him\r\nto, almost without knowing it or anybody's else knowing it.\r\n\r\nA man who does this becomes like any other great force of nature. The\r\nindication seems to be that what the artist in a man or the engineer in\r\nhim does with the genius in him namely: the driving down of an artesian\r\nwell of consciousness into his subconsciousness, the using of his new\r\nbrain tracks and old ones together--is the secret of getting one's way\r\nfor all of us, whether with Nature or with one another.\r\n\r\nOf course, the hard part of this program to arrange for is the new brain\r\ntracks to put with the old ones both in getting our own way with other\r\npeople and with ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis part of my book deals with what is a very personal problem for most\r\nof us--what new brain tracks are really like, how they work, and what\r\npeople can do to get them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWHAT IS CALLED THINKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one special trait that stands out in all new brain tracks in common,\r\nis that nobody wants them. The way people really act--even the best of\r\nus, when some one steps up to them with new tracks for their brains, is\r\nas if they had no place to put them.\r\n\r\nThe plain psychological facts about them when one fronts up with them are\r\nrather appalling. They first appear when one begins to observe closely\r\nwhat one actually does with one's own personal listening and what other\r\npeople, when one checks them up, do with their listening to us.\r\n\r\nIn making as I have tried to make during the last six months, a few\r\nspecial studies in not being fooled by myself, studies in changing what I\r\ncall my mind, I have come to feel that any man who will try several hours\r\neach day a few harmless experiments on his friends and on himself and his\r\nother enemies, will come to two or three thoughts about Man as a rational\r\nbeing which would have seemed dreams to him six months ago.\r\n\r\nThe first fact is this:\r\n\r\nNearly everything that is the matter with the world can be traced back to\r\nthe fact that people have, when one studies them closely, two sets of\r\nears--one set that they look as if they used, put up more or less showily\r\nbefore everybody on the outside, and another entirely secret or real set\r\ninside, that they seriously connect up with their souls and themselves\r\nand really do their living with.\r\n\r\nI first came on them--on these two sets of ears, in my experiences as a\r\nyoung man in speaking to audiences. In the vague helpless way a young\r\nlecturer has, I studied as well as I could what seemed to me to be\r\nhappening to my audiences--what they seemed to be doing to themselves,\r\nbut it was a good many years before I really woke up to what they were\r\ndoing to me, to the way their two sets of ears made them treat me.\r\n\r\nI would watch people sometimes all suddenly in the middle of a sentence\r\nshutting up their real ears or inside ears at me and then holding their\r\noutside ones up at me kindly as if I cared, or as if I doted on them--on\r\noutside ears, on ears of any kind if I could get them and I would feel\r\nhurt but I did not wake up to what it meant.\r\n\r\nAs I remember it the first thing that made me really wake up to the truth\r\nabout ears was the fact that I never seemed to want to speak if I could\r\nhelp it, to an audience all made up of women, like a Woman's Club, or all\r\nmade up of men, or to an audience all made up of very young people or of\r\nvery old people, or of people who presented a solid front of middle age.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with a one-sexed audience or a one-classed audience seems to\r\nbe that they all stop right in the middle of the same sentence sometimes\r\nand change to their outside ears all at once and before one's eyes. In\r\nany audience representing everybody when any one person feels like it,\r\nand goes off on some strange psychological trail of his all alone, one\r\ncan keep adjusted and one soon begins to find that an audience of men and\r\nwomen both is easier to stand before than one which gives itself up to\r\neasy one-sex listening, because the ducks and dodges people make in one's\r\nmeaning, the subterranean passages, tunnels and flights people go off on,\r\nfrom what one says, all check each other up and are different. When the\r\nwomen go under the men emerge. The same seems to be true in speaking to\r\nmixed ages. Fewer passages are wasted. Middle-aged people who remember,\r\nand look forward in listening always help in an audience because they\r\nseem to like to collect stray sentences cheerfully thrown away by people\r\nwho have not started remembering much yet, or by people who do not do\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nI do not want, in making my point, to seem to exaggerate, but so far as\r\nwhat people do to me is concerned if people would get up and go out of a\r\nhall each sentence they stop listening or stop understanding, it would\r\nnot be any worse--the psychological clang of it--than what they do do. It\r\nwould merely look worse. The facts about the way people listen, about the\r\nway they use their two sets of ears on one, snap one out of their souls,\r\nswitch one over from their real or inside ears to their outside ones, in\r\nthree adjectives, are beyond belief. And they all keep thinking they are\r\nlistening, too. One almost never speaks in public without seeing or\r\nexpecting to see little heaps of missed sentences lying everywhere all\r\naround one as one goes out of the hall.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of one's words to people one can keep one's eye on, is still\r\nmore true of words in books.\r\n\r\nIf I could fit up each reader in this book with a little alarm clock or\r\nmusic box in his mind, that would go off in each sentence he is skipping\r\nwithout knowing it, nobody would disagree with me a minute for founding\r\nwhat I have to say in this book about changing people's minds upon the\r\nway people do not listen except in skips, hops and flashes to what they\r\nhear, the way they do not see what they look at, or the way they think,\r\nwhen they think, when they think they think.\r\n\r\n(For every time I say \"they\" in the last paragraph will the reader kindly\r\nread \"we.\")\r\n\r\nIf there were some kind of moody and changeable type all sizes, kinds and\r\ncolors, and if this book could be printed with irregular, up and down and\r\nsidling lines--printed for people the way they are going to read it, if\r\nthe sentences in this chapter could duck under into subterranean passages\r\nor could take nice little airy swoops or flights--if every line on a page\r\ncould dart and waver around in different kinds and colors of type, make a\r\nperfect picture of what is going to happen to it when it is going through\r\npeople's minds, there is not anybody who would not agree with me that all\r\nthese people we see about us who seem to us to be living their lives in\r\nstops, skips and flashes probably live so, because they listen so.\r\n\r\nIf the type in the pages in this book dealing with Mr. Burleson could be\r\nmore responsive, could act the way Mr. Burleson's mind does when he reads\r\nit--that is if I could have the printer dramatize in the way he sets the\r\ntype what Mr. Burleson is going to do with his mind or not do with his\r\nmind with each pellucid sentence as it purls--even Mr. Burleson himself\r\nwould be a good deal shocked to see how very little about himself in my\r\nbook, he was really carrying away from it.\r\n\r\nIf in Mr. Burleson's own personal copy of this book, I were to have this\r\nnext chapter about him that is going to follow soon--especially the\r\nsentences in it he is going to slur over the meaning of or practically\r\nnot read at all--printed in invisible ink and there were just those long\r\npale gaps about him, so that he would have to pour chemical on them to\r\nget them--so that he would have to dip the pages in some kind of nice\r\nliterary goo to see what other people were reading about him, he would\r\nprobably carry away more meaning than I or any one could hope for in\r\nordinary type like this, which gives people a kind, pleasant, superficial\r\nfeeling they are reading whether they are reading or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLIVING DOWN CELLAR IN ONE'S OWN MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I saw a little three-year-old girl the other day doing with her\r\ndolly--dragging its flaxen-haired head around on the floor and holding on\r\nto it dreamily by the leg, is what the average man's body can be seen\r\nalmost any day, doing to his mind.\r\n\r\nOne feels almost as if one ought to hush it up at first until a few\r\nmillion more men have made similar practical observations in the\r\npsychology and physiology of modern life when one comes to see what our\r\ncivilization is bringing us to--what it really is that almost any man one\r\nknows, including the man of marked education--take him off his guard\r\nalmost any minute--is letting his body do to his mind.\r\n\r\nA very large part of even quite intelligent conversation has no\r\norigination in it and is just made up of phonograph records. You say a\r\nthing to a man that calls up Record No. 999873 and he puts it in for you,\r\nstarts his motor and begins to make it go round and round for you. He\r\njust tumtytums off some of his subconsciousness for you. Whether he is\r\nselling you a carpet sweeper or converting your soul, it is his body that\r\nis using his brain and not his brain that is using his body.\r\n\r\nWith the average man one meets, his body wags his brain when he talks, as\r\na dog wags his tail. The tongue sends its roots not into the brain but\r\ninto the stomach. (Probably this is why Saint Paul speaks of it so sadly\r\nand respectfully as a mighty member--because of its roots.)\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty a man has in having a new brain track, or in being\r\noriginal or plastic in a process of mind is the way his body tries to\r\nbully him when he tries it. The body has certain tracks it has got used\r\nto in a mind and that it wants to harden the mind down into and then\r\ntumtytum along on comfortably and it does not propose--all this blessed\r\nmeat we carry around on us, to let us think any more than can be helped.\r\n\r\nI saw some wooden flowers in a florist's window on The Avenue the other\r\nday--four or five big blossoms six inches across--real flowers that had\r\nbeen taken from the edge of a volcano in South America--real flowers that\r\nhad chemically turned to wood--(probably from having gas administered to\r\nthem by the volcano!)--and I stood there and looked at them thinking how\r\ncurious it was that spiritual and spirited things like flowers instead of\r\ngoing out and fading away like a spirit, had died into solid wood in that\r\nway. Then I turned and walked down the street, watching the souls and\r\nbodies of the people and the people were not so different many of them as\r\none looked into their faces, from the wooden flowers, and I could not\r\nhelp seeing, of course, no one can--what their bodies--thousands of\r\nthem--were apparently doing to their souls. After all the wooden flowers\r\nwere not really much queerer for flowers than the people--many of\r\nthem--were for people.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the freedom and the plasticity of the human\r\nmind, from the point of view of spiritual mastery, of securing new brain\r\ntracks in men and women and the consciousness of power, of mobilizing the\r\nbody and the soul both on the instant for the business of living, it is\r\nnot a little discouraging after people are twenty-one years old to watch\r\nwhat they are letting their bodies do to them.\r\n\r\nLeft to itself the body is for all practical purposes so far as the mind\r\nis concerned a petrifaction-machine, a kind of transcendental concrete\r\nmixer for pouring one's soul in with some Portland Cement and making\r\none's living idea over into matter, that preserve them and statuefy them\r\nin one--just as they are. Unless great spiritual pains are taken to keep\r\nthings moving, the body operates practically as a machine for petrifying\r\nspiritual experiences, mummifying ideas or for putting one's spiritual\r\nexperiences on to reels and nerves that keep going on forever.\r\n\r\nThere is ground for belief (and this is what I am trying to have a plan\r\nto meet, in these chapters) that the reason that most of us find talking\r\nwith people and arguing with them and trying to change their minds so\r\nunsatisfactory, is that we are not really thorough with them. What we\r\nreally need to do with people is to go deeper, excavate their sensory\r\nimpressions, play on their subconscious nerves, use liver pills or have a\r\nkidney taken out to convince them. Talk with almost any man of a certain\r\ntype, no matter what he is, a banker, a lawyer, or a mechanic, after he\r\nis thirty years old, and his mind cannot really be budged. He is not\r\nreally listening to you when you criticize him or differ with him.\r\n\r\nThe soul--the shrewder further-sighted part of a man, up in his periscope\r\nhas a tendency to want to think twice, to make a man value you and like\r\nyou for criticizing him and defend himself from you by at least knowing\r\nall you know and keep still and listen to you until he does, but his body\r\nall in a flash tries to keep him from doing this, hardens over his mind,\r\nclaps itself down with its lid of habit over him. Then he automatically\r\ndefends himself with you, starts up his anger-machine, and nothing more\r\ncan be said.\r\n\r\nWhat a man does his not-listening with is not with his soul, but with his\r\nmachine. The very essence of anger is that it is unspirited and\r\nautomatic. The spirited man is the man who has the gusto in him to\r\nlisten, in spite of himself to what his fists and his stomach do not want\r\nto let him hear.\r\n\r\nOf course when a man keeps up a thing of this sort for a few years--say\r\nfor twenty or thirty years--the inevitable happens and one soon sees why\r\nit is that the majority of people--even very attractive people one goes\r\naround talking with and living with, after thirty years, become just\r\nsplendid painted-over effigies of themselves. One has no new way of being\r\nfond of them. One looks for nothing one has not had before. They go\r\nabout--even the most elegant of them--thinking with their stomachs.\r\n\r\nThoughts they get off to us sweetly and unconsciously as if they were\r\nfresh from heaven--as if they had just been caught passing from the music\r\nof the spheres, are all handed up to them on dumb waiters from below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBEING HELPED UP THE CELLAR STAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us feel that the national crisis that lies just ahead calls in a\r\nsingular degree for new and creative ideas and brain paths, both for our\r\nleaders and our people.\r\n\r\nWe realize--whatever our personal habits may be that the great mass of\r\nthe driving ahead that is to be done in this nation in its new\r\nopportunity, must come whether in business, invention or affairs, from\r\npicked men here and there in every business and in every calling, who\r\ninsist on thinking with their heads instead of with their stomachs.\r\n\r\nThe question of how these men who seem to strike out, who seem to do more\r\nof their thinking above the navel than others, manage to do it--the\r\nquestion of how other people--a hundred million people can be got to\r\nfollow in these new brain tracks for a nation--these new ways for a\r\nnation to get its way, is a question of such immediate personal and\r\nnational concern to all of us, that I would like to try to consider for a\r\nlittle what can be done toward giving new brain tracks to the nation and\r\nwhat kind of people can do it.\r\n\r\nThe men who do it, who are going to begin striking down through the\r\nautomaton in all of us, are going to begin taking hold of people's minds\r\nand re-routing and recooerdinating their ideas and are going to be the\r\nmore important and most typical men of our time. The man I know who comes\r\nnearest to doing it, to practicing the new profession of being a lawyer\r\nbackward, who has a technique for giving his clients real inspirations in\r\nbelieving what they do not like to believe about themselves, in seeing\r\nthrough themselves, is P. Mathias Alexander, in the extraordinary work he\r\nis doing in London, for people in the way of reeducating and\r\nrecooerdinating their bodies.\r\n\r\nI took home from a bookshop one day not long ago, after reading an\r\narticle about it by Professor James Harvey Robinson in the _Atlantic_,\r\nMr. Alexander's quite extraordinary book, which after starting off with\r\nan introduction by Professor John Dewey, of Columbia, leads one into a\r\nnew world, to the edge, almost the precipitous edge of a new world.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the deepest and most penetrating knowledge\r\nof that curious and delicate blend of spirit and clay we call a human\r\nbeing, and the most masterful technique for getting conscious control of\r\nit and of the helpless civilization in which it still is trying to live,\r\nare going to be found before many years to be in the brain and the hand\r\nof Mathias Alexander. It is hard to keep from writing a book about him\r\nwhen one thinks of him, but as I cannot write a book about him in the\r\nmiddle of this one, I am going to touch for a moment on the principle\r\nAlexander employs in breaking through new brain tracks in persons, and\r\nthen try to apply the same principles to breaking through new brain\r\ntracks for a nation.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Alexander does with people I have already hinted at in what I\r\nhave said about our having a new profession in America--the profession of\r\nbeing a lawyer backward. Of course Mr. Alexander could not say of himself\r\nthat he was in the profession of being a lawyer backward, but he does\r\npractically the same thing in his field that a lawyer backward would do.\r\nHe makes it his business to change people's minds for them instead of\r\npetting their minds and he does the precise thing I have in mine except\r\nthat he confines himself in doing it to what he calls psycho-mechanics--to\r\na single first relation in which a man's mind needs to be changed--the\r\nrelation of a man's mind to his body.\r\n\r\nIf a man's mind gets his body right, it will not need to be changed about\r\nmany other things in which it is wrong. The first thing a man's mind\r\nshould be changed about usually is his body.\r\n\r\nThis is the principle upon which Mathias Alexander in the very extraordinary\r\nwork he is doing in London, proceeds.\r\n\r\nWhen you are duly accepted as a client and have duly given credentials or\r\nshown signs that you want all the truth about yourself that you can get\r\nno matter how it hurts, or how it looks, you present yourself at the\r\nappointed time in Alexander's office, or studio, or laboratory, or\r\noperating room--whatever the name may be you will feel like calling it\r\nby, before you are finished, and Alexander stands you up before the back\r\nof a chair. Then he takes you in his hands--his very powerful, sensitive\r\nand discerning hands and begins--quite literally begins reshaping you\r\nlike Phidias. You begin to feel him doing you off as if you were going to\r\nbe some new beautiful living statue yourself before very long probably.\r\n\r\nThen he stands off from you a minute, takes a long deep critical gaze at\r\nyou--just as Phidias would, studies the poise and the stresses of your\r\nbody, X-rays down through you with a look--through you and all your inner\r\nworkings from the top of your head to the soles of your feet.\r\n\r\nThen he lays hands on you once more and works and you feel him working\r\nslowly and subtly on you once more, all the while giving orders to you\r\nsoftly not to help him, not to butt in soul and body on what he is doing\r\nto them with your preconceived ideas--ideas he is trying to cure you of,\r\nof what you think you think when you are thinking with what you suppose\r\nis your mind, and what you suppose you are doing with what you suppose is\r\nyour body. In other words, he gives you most strenuously to understand\r\nthat the one helpful thing that you can do with what you call your mind\r\nor what you call your body is to back away from them both all you can. As\r\nit is you and your ideas mostly that are what is the matter with your\r\nmind and body, and with the way you admit they are not getting on\r\ntogether, Alexander's first lessons with you you find are largely\r\noccupied in getting your mind--your terrible and beautiful mind which\r\ndoes such queer things to you, to back away. What he really wants of you\r\nis to have you let him make a present to you outright of certain new\r\npsycho-physical experiences, which he cannot possibly get in, if you\r\ninsist on slipping yours in each time instead. So he keeps working on\r\nyou, you all the while trying to help in soul and body by being as much\r\nlike putty--a kind of transcendental putty as you can, or as you dare,\r\nwithout falling apart before your own eyes. Then when you have removed\r\nall obstructions and preconceptions in your own mind--and will stop\r\npreventing him from doing it, he places your body in an entirely new\r\nposition and subjects you to a physical experience in sitting, standing\r\nand walking, you have never dreamed you could have before.\r\n\r\nThis goes on for as many sittings as are necessary and until you walk out\r\nof the studio or the operating room during the last lessons feeling like\r\nsomebody else--like somebody else that has been lent to you to\r\nbe--somebody else strangely and inextricably familiar that you will be\r\nallowed to wear or be or whatever it is for the rest of your life.\r\nIncidentally you are somewhat taller, your whole body is hung on you in a\r\nnew way, a mile seems a few steps, stairs are like elevators, you find\r\nyourself believing ideas you believed were impossible before, liking\r\npeople you thought were impossible before--even including very\r\nconveniently much of the time, yourself. He has changed your mind about\r\nyour body. You are no longer fooled about what you are actually doing\r\nwith your subconscious or what it is actually doing with you.\r\n\r\nIt is not a psychic process ignoring mechanical facts in the mind, nor a\r\npurely physical process ignoring the psychic facts in the body. It is a\r\nputting of the facts in a man's mind and the facts in his body\r\ninextricably together in his consciousness--as they should be, in that he\r\nis no longer letting himself be fooled by his subconsciousness, swings\r\nfree, and feels able to stop when he is being fooled about himself.\r\n\r\nI have been reading over this chapter and all I can say to my readers is,\r\nas a substitute for leaving it out, that I hope it sounds to them like a\r\nfairy story. I like to think when I am going on from chapter to chapter\r\nin a book--I like to keep thinking of my readers how rational they are.\r\nThe principles underlying what Mr. Alexander does with new brain tracks\r\nand what I am trying to do can be discussed in this book. The facts can\r\nbe looked up and are suitable subjects not for books but for affidavits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS ON THE STAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a not unfamiliar experience for a man to go to a dentist, get into\r\na chair and point to a toothache in the upper right or northeast corner\r\nof his mouth and have the dentist tell him that the toothache he thinks\r\nhe is having there is really in the root of a tooth in the right lower or\r\nsouthwest corner. Then he pulls the southwest corner tooth and the\r\nnortheast corner toothache is over.\r\n\r\n(These figures or rather points of the compass may not be literally\r\nright, but the fact that they point to is.) Nearly every man has had\r\nthings happen to him not very different from this. You have a bad\r\nlameness in your right knee and the wise man you go to, tells you that\r\nyou are deceived about the real trouble being in your right knee, calls\r\nyour attention to a place three and a half feet off way up on the other\r\nside of you, says you should have a gold filling put in a tooth there and\r\nyour right knee will get well.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be true of people is that though in a less glaring and more\r\nsubtle fashion, there are very few of us who are not subject either all\r\nor part of the time to more or less important and quite unmanageable\r\nillusions about things with which we are supposed to be--if anybody\r\nis--the most intimately acquainted. One keeps hearing every few days\r\nalmost, lately, of how people's inner organs are not doing what they\r\nthink they are, of how very often--even the most important of them have\r\nbeen mislaid--a colon for instance being allowed to do its work three\r\ninches lower than it ever ought to be allowed to try, and all manner of\r\nother mechanical blunders that are being made, grave mechanical\r\ninconveniences which are being daily put up with by people, when they\r\nmove about or when they lie down, of which they have not the slightest\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nThe sensory impressions of what is really happening to us, of where it is\r\nhappening and how and why are full--in many people of glaring and not\r\ninfrequently dangerous illusions, but these physical illusions which we\r\nhave are reflected automatically in our spiritual and intellectual ones.\r\nAll kinds of false ideas people have about one another which we are not\r\nseeing about us on every hand, false philosophies and religions, heresy\r\ntrials, lockouts and strikes--all the irrational things people say and do\r\nto each other thousands of miles away are being produced by the way\r\npeople are being fooled by their own precious insides. Each man is doing\r\nthings that are unfair and wrong thousands of miles away, because he is\r\noff on his facts as to what is going on the first few feet off, because\r\nthe first hundred and fifty pounds of consciousness which have been\r\nassigned to him to know about personally and attend to personally he is\r\nletting himself be fooled with every day.\r\n\r\nA man who is being fooled near by, regularly all the time, fooled from\r\nthe sole of his poor tired feet to the poor helpless nib at the top of\r\nhim which he calls his head, is naturally hard to argue with about the\r\nimmortality of the soul, or the League of Nations. Reforms and reformers\r\nwhich overlook these facts must not be surprised if they seem to some of\r\nus a little superficial.\r\n\r\nOf course the moral of all this is--as regards changing society or\r\npersuading and convincing persons, get down to first principles. Stop\r\nflourishing around with fine and noble philosophies and phrases on the\r\nsurface of men's souls. See that their souls and their bodies are both\r\nintricately divinely stupendously blended together and get at them both\r\ntogether. If you are arguing with a man and do not make much headway,\r\nstop arguing with him. Cut out his tonsils.\r\n\r\nOr it may be something else. Or send him to Alexander and have his back\r\nironed out, if necessary so that his tonsils will work as they are.\r\n\r\nThen argue with him afterwards and quote Shakespeare and the Bible to\r\nhim, stroke his soul and see how it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nHELPING OTHER PEOPLE UP THE CELLAR STAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is getting almost dangerous to talk to me. I lay violent hands on\r\npeople, when they disagree with me and send them to Alexander.\r\n\r\nEverybody, anybody, my wife, my pastor, every now and then an editor,\r\nwhole shoals of publishers.... I think what it would be like for us all,\r\nto ship The United States Senate in a body to him. On every side it keeps\r\ncoming to me that the short, quick and thorough way for me to install my\r\nidea, to get my idea started and to install my idea of new brain tracks,\r\nnew ways for this nation to get its way and deserve its way, is to have\r\npeople the minute they don't agree with me, alexandered, at once.\r\n\r\nHere is this book for instance. The proper course for me to take to get a\r\nman to accept the new brain track in it, is to send him a copy of the\r\nbook to say yes or no to. Then if he does not agree with me and I am\r\ntempted to argue with him, I will drop the matter with him at once, send\r\nhim to Alexander, have Alexander set him in a chair, tap him on the back,\r\npoke him thoughtfully, psycho-mechanically in the ribs, unlimber his mind\r\nfrom his body, untangle him psycho-physically, put him in shape so that\r\nhe can think free, listen without obsessions and mental automatism--that\r\nis, get him so that he can set his mind on a subject instead of setting\r\nhis stomach on it, and then I will ask him to read my book again.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, of course, I should be going to Alexander and rewriting\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nBy the time the gentleman was cured I would have a cured book to send\r\nhim, we would both be in a position to believe what we don't want to\r\nbelieve, to listen to each other indefinitely and we would be in a\r\nposition to do team work together at once and take steps to install new\r\nbrain tracks for nations immediately.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the two horns of my dilemma.\r\n\r\nIn installing new brain tracks for nations it is not practicable for me\r\nto take up people who disagree with me--say a hundred million people or\r\nso and ship them to Alexander in London and have them done over by\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best possible substitute arrangement that can be made for\r\nhaving a whole nation put into perfect psycho-mechanical shape by\r\nAlexander so that it will take the first new brain tracks kindly?\r\n\r\nThe principles for giving people new brain tracks toward their own bodies\r\nwhich Mr. Alexander has so successfully demonstrated, are the same\r\nprinciples which I have been trying for a long time to express and apply\r\nto ideas and to all phases of the personal and the national life.\r\n\r\nWhere I have been studying for years as an artist, the art of changing my\r\nown mind and other people's about ideas, of working out new spiritual\r\nexperiences for myself and other people, Alexander in his workroom in\r\nLondon has been engaged in changing people's minds toward their bodies,\r\nin giving men new brain tracks toward their own bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that these principles--Alexander's principles for\r\ninstalling new physical experiences and mine for installing new spiritual\r\nones, must be if they are fundamental or are worth anything, the same.\r\n\r\nMy own feeling is that if anybody can go to Alexander and can be done\r\nover by Alexander personally in London that is the best thing to do. But\r\nit is inconvenient for a hundred million people to crowd into Alexander's\r\noffice in London, and it is comparatively convenient and roomy for a\r\nhundred million people if they want to, to crowd into a book. Before\r\ngiving the principles, I would like to state the question--What are the\r\nsteps we all can use--those of us who are not Alexander--to install new\r\nbrain tracks in this nation?\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which, as it seems to me, new brain tracks for this\r\nnation should be installed and which I would like to deal with are these:\r\n\r\nFirst. Get people first to recognize with regard to new brain tracks, the\r\nfact that they do not want them.\r\n\r\nSecond. Get their attention to what people with new brain tracks seem to\r\nbe able to do in the way of getting in our present moving world, the\r\nthings they want. People go to Alexander and ask him for new brain\r\ntracks. Something corresponding to this has to be got from people before\r\noffering them new brain tracks in a convention or in a book.\r\n\r\nThird. Pick out the people next to the people the proposed new brain\r\ntracks are for, who seem to be the particular kind of people best\r\ncalculated to make the necessary excavations in their brains, to loosen\r\nup ideas, or any hard gray matter there may be there, so that something\r\ncan be put in.\r\n\r\nThe fourth step when we recognize that we want the facts against\r\nourselves and see what we can do with them, is to ask people to let us\r\nhave them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nHELPING A NATION UP THE CELLAR STAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League is a national organization of millions of American\r\nmen and women belonging to all classes and all social and industrial\r\ngroups, who become members of the League for the express purpose of\r\nasking people to help to keep them, in their personal and industrial\r\nrelations, from being off on their facts, from being fooled by their\r\nsubconscious and automatic selves.\r\n\r\nUnless one is practically asked, it is not an agreeable experience\r\ntelling a man how he looks, handing over to him the conveniences for his\r\nbeing objective, for his being temporarily somebody else toward himself,\r\nand yet if one can persuade any one to do it, it is probably the most\r\ntimely and most priceless service rendered in the right spirit, any one\r\nman or group of men can ever render another.\r\n\r\nThe best way to secure the right people for this service is to ask them.\r\nThe people who do not need to be asked and who would be only too cheerful\r\nto do it, who are lying awake nights to do it to us whether we want them\r\nto or not, are not apt to do it in a practical way.\r\n\r\nThe best way to ask the best people is to place oneself in a position, as\r\nin joining the Air Line League, where people will feel asked without any\r\none's saying anything about it.\r\n\r\nThis is the first principle we propose to follow in the League. By the\r\nact of joining the League, by the bare fact that we are in it, we\r\nannounce that we are askers, and listeners, that as individuals, and as\r\nmembers of a class, or of our capital groups or our Labor groups, we are\r\nas a matter of course open and more than open to facts--facts from any\r\nquarter we can get them which will help to keep us in what we are doing\r\nfrom being fooled about ourselves.\r\n\r\nHaving agreed to our principle, whether as individuals or groups, of\r\nbeing unfooled about our subconscious and automatic selves, who are the\r\nbest people in a nation constituted like ours, to unfool us the most\r\nquickly, to get our attention the most poignantly, and with the least\r\ntrouble to us and to themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE FOR LABOR IN GETTING ITS WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best people to advertise a truth are the people the truth looks\r\nprominent on--the people from whom nobody expects it.\r\n\r\nIn my subconscious or automatic self the decision has apparently been\r\nmade and handed up to me, that there are certain books, I do not need to\r\nread.\r\n\r\nMy attention has never been really got as yet, to the importance of my\r\nreading one of Harold Bell Wright's novels. But if I heard to-morrow\r\nmorning that Henry Cabot Lodge and President Wilson during the last few\r\npeaceful months had both read through Harold Bell Wright's last novel, I\r\nwould read it before I went to bed.\r\n\r\nOr Judge Gary and Mr. Gompers. Any common experience which I heard in the\r\nlast few weeks Judge Gary and Mr. Gompers had had, a novel by Harold Bell\r\nWright or anything--I would look into, a whole nation would look into\r\nit--the moment they heard of it--at once.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do in making a start for new brain tracks for America\r\nis to pick out persons and brain tracks that set each other off.\r\n\r\nEven an idea nobody would care about one way or the other becomes\r\nsuddenly and nationally interesting to us when we find people we would\r\nnot think would believe it, are believing it hard and trying to get us to\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nSuppose for instance that next Fourth of July (I pick out this day for\r\nwhat I want to have happen because I have so longed for years to have\r\nsomething strong and sincere said or done on it that would really\r\ncelebrate it)--suppose for instance that next Fourth of July, beginning\r\nearly in the morning all the Labor leaders of America from Maine to\r\nCalifornia, acting as one man broke away--just took one day off, from\r\ndoing the old humdrum advertising everybody expects from them--suppose\r\nthey proceeded to do something that would attract attention--something\r\nthat would interest their friends and disappoint their enemies--just for\r\ntwenty-four hours? Suppose just for one day all the Labor leaders instead\r\nof going about advertising to themselves and to everybody the bad\r\nemployers and how bad employers are in this country would devote the\r\nFourth of July to advertising a few good ones?\r\n\r\nThen suppose they follow it up--that Labor do something with initiative\r\nin it--the initiative its enemies say it cannot have, something\r\nunexpected and original, true and sensationally fair, something that\r\nwould make a nation look and that a hundred million people would never\r\nforget?\r\n\r\nWhat does any one suppose would happen or begin to happen in this\r\ncountry, if Labor; after the next Fourth of July, started a new national\r\ncrusade for four weeks--if the fifty best laborers in the Endicott\r\nJohnson Mills where they have not had a strike for thirty years should go\r\nin a body one after the other to a list of Bolshevist factories,\r\nfactories that have ultra-reactionary employers, and conduct an agitation\r\nof telling what happens to them in their Endicott Johnson mills, an\r\nagitation of telling them what some employers can be like and are like\r\nand how it works until the Bolshevist workmen they come to see are driven\r\nby sheer force of facts into being non-Bolshevist workmen, and their\r\nBolshevist or their reactionary employers are driven by sheer force of\r\nfacts into being Endicott Johnsons, or into hiring men to put in front of\r\nthemselves, who will be Endicott Johnsons for them.\r\n\r\nAll that is necessary to start a new brain track in industrial agitation\r\nin America to-day is some simultaneous concerted original human act of\r\nlabor or capital, some act of believing in somebody, or showing that\r\neither of them--either capital or labor--is thinking of somebody,\r\nbelieving in somebody, and expecting something good of somebody besides\r\nthemselves. Millions of individual employers and individual laborers\r\nabout have these more shrewd, these more competent practicable and\r\ndiscriminating beliefs about employers and employees as fellow human\r\nbeings, and all we need to do to start a new national brain track is to\r\narrange some signal generous conclusive arresting massive move together\r\nto show it.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of work the Air Line League proposes on a national scale\r\nlike the Red Cross to arrange for and do.\r\n\r\nThe common denominator of democracy in industry is the human being, the\r\nfellow human being--employer or employee.\r\n\r\nThe best, most practicable way to make it unnecessary for America in\r\nshame and weakness to keep on deporting Bolshevists, is to arrange a\r\nnational advertisement, a parade or national procession as it were in\r\nthis country soon, of team work in industry and of how--to anybody who\r\nknows the facts--it carries everything before it.\r\n\r\nThe best possible national parade or pageant would be up and down through\r\nten thousand cities to expose every laborer to long rows of employers who\r\nstand up for workmen, expose every employer to long rows of workingmen\r\nfrom all over the country who stand up for employers.\r\n\r\nOf course this is physically inconvenient, but it would pay hundreds of\r\ntimes over to conduct a national campaign of having laborers bring other\r\nlaborers into line and of having employers shame other employers into\r\ncompetence.\r\n\r\nThe best substitute for this national demonstration, this national\r\nphysical getting together like this, is as I have said before, a book\r\nread by all, by employers and employees looking over each other's\r\nshoulders, each conscious as he reads that the other knows he reads,\r\nknows what he knows and is reading what he knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE FOR CAPITAL IN GETTING ITS WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nI should hate to see Capital, in the form of a National Manufacturers'\r\nAssociation, realizing the desperateness of the labor situation and that\r\nsomething has got to be done at last which goes to the bottom, slinking\r\noff privately and confessing its sins to God.\r\n\r\nI would rather see a confession of the sins of Capital toward Labor for\r\nthe last forty years and of its sins to-day made by Capital in person to\r\nLabor.\r\n\r\nGod will get it anyway--the confession--and it will mean ten times as\r\nmuch to Him and to everybody if He overhears it being given to Labor.\r\n\r\nOf course Labor has been doing of late wrong things that it is highly\r\ndesirable should be confessed and naturally Capital thinks that a good\r\nway to open the exercises would be with a confession from Labor to\r\nCapital to the effect that Labor admits that Labor like the Trusts before\r\nit had had moments or seizures in which it has held up the country,\r\nbroken its word, betrayed the people and acted the part the people hate\r\nto believe of it--of the bully and the liar.\r\n\r\nNot only the Capital Group but the Public Group feel that a confession\r\nfrom Labor before we go on to arrange things better is highly to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nBut the practical question that faces us is--supposing that what is\r\nwanted next by all, is a confession from Labor, what is the practical way\r\nfrom now on, to get Labor to confess?\r\n\r\nSome supposing might be done a minute.\r\n\r\nSuppose I have a very quick temper and five sons and suppose the oldest\r\none has my temper and is making it catching to the other sons, what would\r\nany ordinary observer say is the practical course for the poor wicked old\r\nfather to take with the boy's temper of which he has made the boy a\r\npresent?\r\n\r\nMy feeling is when my boy loses his temper with me at dinner for instance\r\nin the presence of the other boys, that poking a verse in a Bible feebly\r\nout at him and saying to him, \"He that keepeth his temper is greater than\r\nhe that taketh a city,\" would be rude. The way for me to give him good\r\nadvice about losing his temper is to sit there quietly with him while he\r\nis losing his, and keep mine.\r\n\r\nIf Capital wants to get its way with Labor--and thinks that the way to\r\nbegin with the industrial situation in this country, after all that has\r\nhappened, is with a vast national spectacle of Labor confessing its sins,\r\nthe most practical thing to do is for Capital to give Labor an\r\nillustration of what confessing sins is like, and how it works.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists among us who are the least deceived by their subconscious\r\nor automatic minds, are at the present moment not at all incapable of\r\nconfiding to each other behind locked doors that the one single place,\r\nextreme labor to-day has got its autocracy from, is from them.\r\n\r\nLabor is merely doing now with the scarcity of labor, the one specific\r\nthing that Capital has taught it to do and has done for forty years with\r\nthe scarcity of money and jobs.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me visionary and sentimental and impracticable for Capital to\r\ntry to fix things up now and give things a new start now, by slinking off\r\nand confessing its sins to God.\r\n\r\nLabor will slink off and confess its sins to God, too.\r\n\r\nThat will be the end of it.\r\n\r\nIt may be excellent as far as it goes, but in the present desperate\r\ncrisis of a nation, with the question of the very existence of society\r\nand the existence of business staring us in the face, it really must be\r\nadmitted that as a practical short cut to getting something done, our all\r\ngoing out into a kind of moral backyard behind the barn and confessing\r\nour sins to God, is weak-looking and dreamy as compared with our all\r\nstanding up like men at our own front doors, looking each other in the\r\neye and confessing our sins to one another.\r\n\r\nI am not saying this because I am a moral person. I am not whining at\r\nthirty thousand banks pulling them by the sleeves and saying please to\r\nthem and telling them that this is what they ought to do.\r\n\r\nI am a practical matter of fact person, speaking as an engineer in human\r\nnature and in what works with human nature and saying that when\r\ncapitalists and employers stop being sentimental and off on their facts\r\nabout themselves and about other people, when they propose to be\r\npractical and serious, and really get their way with other people they\r\nare going to begin by being imperfect, by talking and acting with labor,\r\nlike fellow-imperfect human beings.\r\n\r\nIn the new business world that began the other day--the day of our last\r\nshot at the Germans, the only way a man is going to long get his way is\r\nto be more human than other people, have a genius for being human in\r\nbusiness, for being human quick and human to the point where others have\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nPHILANDERING AND ALEXANDERING\r\n\r\n\r\nBy philandering I mean fooling oneself with self-love.\r\n\r\nBy Alexandering I mean going to one's Alexander whoever he or she or it\r\nis, some one person--or some one thing, which either by natural gift or\r\nby natural position is qualified to help one to be extremely disagreeable\r\nto oneself--and ask to be done over--now one subject and now another.\r\n\r\nNearly all men admit--or at least they like to say when they are properly\r\napproached, or when they make the approach themselves, that they make\r\nmistakes and that they are poor miserable sinners. Everybody is. They\r\nrather revel in it, some of them, in being in a nice safe way, miserable\r\nsinners. The trouble comes in ever going into the particulars with them,\r\nin finding any particular time and place one can edge in in which they\r\nare not perfect.\r\n\r\nThis fact which seems to be true of employers and employees, of capital\r\nand labor in general, brings out and illustrates another general\r\nprinciple in making the necessary excavations in one's own mind and other\r\npeople's for new brain tracks--another working principle of technique for\r\na man or a group in a nation to use in getting and deserving to get its\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThere are various Alexandering stages in the technique of not being\r\nfooled by oneself.\r\n\r\nSelf-criticism.\r\n\r\nAsking others to help--one's nearest Alexander.\r\n\r\nSelf-confession to oneself.\r\n\r\nSelf-discipline.\r\n\r\nAsking others to help.\r\n\r\nThe way to keep from philandering with one's own self-love or with one's\r\nown group or party--is to look over the entire field--the way one would\r\non other subjects than being fooled by one's own side, strip down to the\r\nbare facts about oneself and facts about others for one's vision of\r\naction and fit them together and act.\r\n\r\nIn getting one's way quickly, thoroughly, personally--_i.e._, so that\r\nother people will feel one deserves it and will practically hand it over\r\nto one, and want one to have it, the best technique seems to be not only\r\nto utilize self-criticism or self-confession, as a part of getting one's\r\nway, but self-confession screwed up a little tighter--screwed up into\r\nself-confession to others.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I am not throwing this idea out right and left to\r\nemployers with any hopeful notion that it will be generally acted on\r\noffhand.\r\n\r\nIt is merely thrown out for employers who want to get their way with\r\ntheir employees--get team work and increased production out of their\r\nemployees before their rivals do.\r\n\r\nIt is only for employers who want their own way a great deal--men who are\r\nin the habit of feeling masterful and self-masterful in getting their own\r\nway--who are shrewd enough, sincere enough to take a short-cut to it, and\r\nget it quick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE FACTORY THAT LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a man at the head of a factory not a thousand miles away, I wish\r\nthirty thousand banks and a hundred million people knew, as I know\r\nhim--and as God and his workmen know him.\r\n\r\nSome thirty years ago his father, who was the President of the firm,\r\nfailed in health, lost his mind slowly and failed in business. The\r\nfactory went into the hands of a receiver, the family moved from the big\r\nhouse to a little one--one in a row of a mile of little ones down a side\r\nstreet, and the sixteen year old son, who had expected to inherit the\r\nbusiness stopped going to school, bought a tin dinner pail and walked\r\nback and forth with the tin dinner pail with the other boys in the street\r\nhe lived in, and became a day laborer in the business he was brought up\r\nto own.\r\n\r\nIn not very many years he worked his way up past four hundred men, earned\r\nand took the right to be the President of the business he had expected to\r\nhave presented to him.\r\n\r\nEight or ten years ago he began to have strikes. His strikes seemed\r\nuglier than other people's and singularly hopeless--always with something\r\nin them--a kind of secret obstinate something in them, he kept trying in\r\nvain to make out. One day when the worst strike of all was just on--or\r\nscheduled to come on in two days, as he looked up from his desk about\r\nfive o'clock and saw four hundred muttering men filing out past his\r\nwindows, he called in Jim--into his office.\r\n\r\nJim was a foreman--his most intimate friend as a boy when he was sixteen\r\nyears old. He had lived in the house next door to Jim's and every morning\r\nfor years they had got out of bed and walked sleepily with their tin\r\ndinner pails, to the mill together talking of the heavens and the earth\r\nand of what they were going to do when they were men.\r\n\r\nThe President had some rather wild and supercilious conversation with\r\nJim, about the new strike on in two days and it ended in Jim's dismissing\r\nthe President from the interview and slamming himself out of the door,\r\nonly to open it again and stick his head in and say, \"The trouble with\r\nyou, Al, is you've forgotten you ever carried a dinner pail.\"\r\n\r\nThe President lay awake that night, came to the works the next morning,\r\ncalled the four hundred men together, asked the other officers to stay\r\naway, shut himself up in the room with the four hundred men and told them\r\nwith a deep feeling, no man present could even mistake or ever forget,\r\nwhat Jim had said to him about himself--that he had forgotten how he felt\r\nwhen he carried a dinner pail, told them that he had lain awake all night\r\nthinking that Jim was right, that he wanted to know all the things he had\r\nforgotten, that they would be of more use to him and perhaps more use\r\nthan anything in the world and that if they would be so good as to tell\r\nhim what the things were that he had forgotten--so good as to get up in\r\nthat room where they were all alone together and tell him what was the\r\nmatter with him, he would never forget it as long as he lived. He wanted\r\nto see what he could do in the factory from now on to get back all that\r\nsixteen-year-old boy with the dinner pail knew, have the use of it in the\r\nfactory every day from now on to earn and to keep the confidence the\r\nsixteen-year-old boy had, and run the factory with it.\r\n\r\nJim got up and made a few more remarks without any door-slamming. Fifteen\r\nor twenty more men followed with details.\r\n\r\nThis was the first meeting that pulled the factory together. In those\r\nthat followed the President and the men together got at the facts\r\ntogether and worked out the spirit and principles and applied them to\r\ndetails. The meetings were held on company time--at first every few days,\r\nthen every week, and now quite frequently when some new special\r\napplication comes up. Nine out of ten of the difficulties disappeared\r\nwhen the new spirit of team work and mutual candor was established and\r\neverybody saw how it worked.\r\n\r\nNo one could conceive now of getting a strike in edgewise to the factory\r\nthat listened to Jim.\r\n\r\nI am not unaccustomed to going about factories with Presidents and it is\r\noften a rather stilted and lonely performance. But when I first went\r\nthrough this factory with the President that listened to Jim, stood by\r\nbenches, talked with him and his men together, felt and saw the\r\nunconscious natural and human way conversations were conducted between\r\nthem, saw ten dollars a day and a hundred dollars a day talking and\r\nlaughing together and believing and working together, it did not leave\r\nvery much doubt in my mind as to what the essential qualities are that\r\nbusiness men to-day--employers and workingmen--are going to have and have\r\nto have to make them successful in producing goods, in leading their\r\nrivals in business and in getting their way with one another.\r\n\r\nNaturally as a matter of convenience and a short cut for all of us, I\r\nwould like to see Capital take what is supposed to be its initiative--be\r\nthe side that leads off and makes the start in the self-discipline,\r\nself-confession and conscious control of its own class, which it thinks\r\nLabor ought to.\r\n\r\nWhichever side in our present desperate crisis attains self-discipline\r\nand the full power in sight of the people not to be fooled about itself\r\nfirst, will win the leadership first, and win the loyalty and gratitude\r\nand partiality and enthusiasm of the American people for a hundred years.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe first thing for a man to do to get his way with another man--install\r\na new brain track with him that they can use together, is to surprise the\r\nman by picking out for him and doing to him the one thing that he knows\r\nthat you of all others would be the last man to do.\r\n\r\nIt looks as if the second thing to do is to surprise the man into doing\r\nsomething himself that he knew that he himself anyway of all people in\r\nthe world, is the last man to do.\r\n\r\nFirst you surprise him with you. Then with himself. After this of course\r\nwith new people to do things, both on the premises, the habit soon sets\r\nin of starting with people all manner of things that everybody knew--who\r\nknew anything--knew the people could not do.\r\n\r\nThis is what the President of the factory not a thousand miles away\r\naccomplished all in twenty-four hours by not being fooled about himself.\r\nHe took a short cut to getting what he wanted to get with his employees,\r\nwhich if ten thousand other employers could hear of and could take\r\nto-morrow would make several million American wage earners feel they were\r\nin a new world before night.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe thing that seemed to me the most significant and that I liked best\r\nabout the President of the Company who listened to Jim, was the discovery\r\nI made in a few minutes, when I met him, that unlike Henry Ford, whom I\r\nmet for the first time the same week, he was not a genius. He was a man\r\nwith a hundred thousand duplicates in America.\r\n\r\nAny one of a hundred thousand men we all know in this country would do\r\nwhat he did if he happened on it, if just the right Jim, just the right\r\nmoment, stuck his head in the door.\r\n\r\nHere's to Jim, of course.\r\n\r\nBut after all not so much credit to Jim. There are more of us probably\r\nwho could have stuck our heads in the door.\r\n\r\nThe greater credit should go to the lying awake in the night, to the man\r\nwho was practical enough to be inspired by a chance to quit and quit\r\nsharply in his own business, being fooled by himself and who got four\r\nhundred men to help.\r\n\r\nIncidentally of course though he did not think of it, and they did not\r\nthink of it, the four hundred men all in the same tight place he was in\r\nof course, of trying not to be fooled about themselves, asked him to help\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOf course with both sides in a factory in this way pursuing the other\r\nside and asking it to help it not to be fooled, everything everybody says\r\ncounts. There is less waste in truth in a factory. Truth that is asked\r\nfor and thirsted for, is drunk up. The refreshment of it, the efficiency\r\nof it which the people get, goes on the job at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nLISTENING TO JIM\r\n\r\n(A Note on Collective Bargaining)\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to say to begin with that I believe in national collective\r\nbargaining as it is going to be in the near future--collective bargaining\r\nexecuted on such subjects and with such power and limitations and in such\r\nspirit as shall be determined by the facts--the practical engineering\r\nfacts in human nature and the way human nature works.\r\n\r\nI do not feel that collective bargaining has been very practical about\r\nhuman nature so far. The moment that it is, the public and all manner of\r\npowerful and important persons, who are suspicious or offish or\r\nunreasonable about collective bargaining now, are going to believe in it.\r\n\r\nA book entitled \"A Few Constructive Reflections on Marriage\" by a man who\r\nhad had a fixed habit for many years of getting divorces,--a man whose\r\nex-wives were all happily married would not be very deep probably. A\r\nsymposium by his ex-wives who had all succeeded on their second husbands\r\nwould really count more. Most candid people would admit this as a\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThe same principle seems to hold good about what people think in National\r\nAssociations of Employers and national associations of workingmen in\r\nlabor unions.\r\n\r\nThinking a thing out nationally on a hundred million scale which is being\r\ndone by people who cannot even think a thing out individually or on a\r\ntwo-person, or five-person scale, is in danger of coming to very\r\nsuperficial decisions.\r\n\r\nCapital has been in danger for forty years and labor is in danger now, of\r\nbeing fooled by its own bigness. Because it is big it does not need to be\r\nright, and because it does not need to be right it might as well be wrong\r\nabout half the time.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the illusion of bigness is that it is not content with\r\nthe people who are in the inside of the bigness who are having it. Other\r\npeople have it.\r\n\r\nWhen a man looks me in the eye and tells me with an air, that two times\r\ntwo equals four and a half, he does not impress me and I feel I have some\r\nway of dealing with him as a human being and reasoning with him. But when\r\nI am told in a deep bass national tone that 2973432 multiplied by 2373937\r\nis 9428531904456765328654126178 I am a little likely to be impressed and\r\nto feel that because the figures are so large they must be right. At all\r\nevents, on the same principle that very few of my readers are going to\r\ntake a pad out of their pockets this minute and see if I have multiplied\r\n2373937 by 2173937 right, or if I have even taken half a day off to\r\nmultiply them at all, I am rather inclined to take what people who talk\r\nto me in a deep bass seven figure national tone, at their word.\r\n\r\nLabor unions and trusts in dealing with the American public have been\r\nfooled by their own bigness and have naturally tried to have us fooled by\r\nit a good many years.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather natural un-self-conscious innocent thing to do I suppose,\r\nat first, but as the illusion is one which of course does not work or\r\nonly works a little while, and does not and cannot get either for capital\r\nor labor what they want it does not seem to me we have time,--especially\r\nin the difficulties we are all facing together in America now, to let\r\nourselves be fooled by bigness, our own or other people's, much longer.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties we have to face between capital and labor are all\r\nessentially difficulties in human nature and they can only be dealt with\r\nby tracing them to their causes, to their germs, looking them up and\r\ngetting them right in the small relations first where the bacilli begin,\r\ndealing at particular times and in particular places with particular\r\nhuman beings. In the factory that listened to Jim, no order from a\r\nnational Collective Bargaining Works could have begun to meet the\r\nsituation as well as Jim did and the factory did.\r\n\r\nIf Jim had stuck his head in the door by orders from Indianapolis, or if\r\nthe President of the Company had had a telegram giving him national\r\ninstructions to lie awake that night, what would it have come to?\r\n\r\nI believe in national or collective bargaining as a matter of course, in\r\ncertain aspects of all difficulties between capital and labor. But the\r\ncauses of most difficulties in industry are personal and have to be dealt\r\nwith where the persons are. The more personal things to be done are, the\r\nmore personally they have to be attended to.\r\n\r\nIf the women of America were to organize a Childbirth Labor Union, say\r\nnext Christmas--and if from next Christmas on, all the personal relations\r\nof men and women and husbands and wives--the stipulations and conditions\r\non which women would and would not bear children were regulated by\r\nnational rules, by courtship rules and connubial orders from\r\nIndianapolis, Indiana, it would be about as superficial a way to\r\ndetermine the well-being of the sexes, as foolish and visionary a way for\r\nthe female class to attempt to reform and regulate the class that has\r\nbeen fenced off by The Creator as the male class, as the present attempt\r\nof the labor class to sweep grandly over the spiritual and personal\r\nrelation of individual employers and individual workmen and substitute\r\nfor it collective bargaining from Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing about women. It would never have occurred to the women\r\nof this country as it has to the men to get up a contraption for doing a\r\nthing nationally that they could not even do at home.\r\n\r\nFor every woman to allow herself to be governed from the outside in the\r\nmost intimate concerns and the deepest and most natural choices of her\r\nlife is not so very much more absurd than for a man in his business, the\r\nmain and most important and fundamental activity in which he lives, the\r\none that he spends eight hours a day on, to be controlled from a distance\r\nand from outside.\r\n\r\nThe whole idea, whether applied to biology or industry is a half dead,\r\nmechanical idea and only people who are tired or half alive, are long\r\ngoing to be willing to put up with it.\r\n\r\nAs the mutual education of marriage is an individual affair,--as the more\r\nindividualness, the more personalness there is in the relation is what\r\nthe relation itself is for, the mutual education of employers and\r\nemployees is going to be found to have more meaning, value and power, the\r\nmore individual and personal--that is to say, the more alive it is.\r\n\r\nAll live men with any gusto or headway in them, or passion for work, all\r\nemployers and employees with any headway or passion for getting together\r\nin them are as impatient of having the way they get together their\r\npersonal relations in business governed from outside, as they would be in\r\nthe sexual relation and for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nIf it was proposed to have an audience of all the women in America get\r\ntogether in a vast hall and an audience of all the men in America get\r\ntogether in another, and pass resolutions of affection at each other,\r\nrules and bylaws for love-strikes and boycotts, and love-lockouts, how\r\nmany men and women that one would care to speak to or care to have for a\r\nfather or mother, would go?\r\n\r\nOnly anaemic men and women in this vast vague whoofy way would either make\r\nor accept national arrangements made in this labor-union way for the\r\nconditions of their lives together.\r\n\r\nAnd in twenty years only anaemic employers and anaemic employees and\r\nworkmen are going to let themselves be cooped up in what they do\r\ntogether, by conventions, by national committees, are going to have eight\r\nhours a day of their lives grabbed out of their hands by collective\r\nbargaining and by having what everybody does and just how much he does of\r\nit determined for him as if everybody was like everybody, as if locality,\r\npersonality and spirit in men did not count, as if the actual daily\r\ncontacts of the men themselves were not the only rational basis of\r\ndetermining and of making effective what was right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE NEW COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nI met a wagon coming down the street yesterday, saying across the front\r\nof it--half a street away, American Experience Co.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get in.\r\n\r\nOf course it turned out to be as it got nearer, The American Express Co.,\r\nbut I couldn't help thinking what it would mean if we had an equally\r\nwell-organized arrangement for rapid transit of boxes--boxes people have\r\ngot out of or got into, as we have for conveying other boxes people are\r\nmixed up with. (Fixes were called boxes when I was a boy. We used to\r\nspeak of a man having a difficult experience, as being in a box.)\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League proposes to be The American Experience Company--a big\r\nnational concern for shipping other people's experiences to people, so\r\nthat unless they insist on it, they will have the good of them without\r\nhaving to take their time and everybody else's time around them to go\r\nthrough them all over again alone and just for themselves.\r\n\r\nOf course there are people who tumtytum along without thinking, who will\r\nmiss the principle and insist on having a nice private misery of doing it\r\nall over again in their own home factory for themselves. But there are\r\nmany million people with sense in this country--people as good at making\r\nsense out of other people as they are in making money out of them, and\r\nthe Air Line League proposes that to these people who have the sense,\r\nwhen they want them, when they order them, experiences shall be shipped.\r\nAnd when they get orders--they can ship theirs.\r\n\r\nIf some of the experience the Labor unions in England have had and got\r\nover having, could be shipped in the next few weeks, unloaded and taken\r\nover by the Americans, anybody can see with a look, ways in which the Air\r\nLine League or American Experience Company, if it were existing this\r\nminute, could bring home to people what they want to know about what\r\nworks and what does not, what they long to have advertised to them--at\r\nonce. Experiences--or date of experiences shipped from England would not\r\nonly make a short-cut for America in increasing production in this\r\ncountry, lowering the cost of living, but would give America a chance in\r\nthe same breath by the same act, to win a victory over herself and to\r\nturn the fate of a world.\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League proposes to do is to act--particularly through\r\nthe Look-Up Club--as the American Shipping Experience Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTY-CENT DOLLAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is itself--so far as it goes, a dramatization of the idea of\r\nthe Look-Up Club.\r\n\r\nThe thing the book--between its two bits of pasteboard does on paper--a\r\nkind of listening together of capital and labor, the Look-Up Club of The\r\nAir Line League is planned to do in the nation at large and locally in\r\nten thousand cities--capital, labor and the consumer listening to each\r\nother--reading the same book as it were over each other's shoulders,\r\nstudying their personal interests together, working and acting out\r\ntogether the great daily common interest of all of us. The Look-Up Club,\r\nacting as it does for the three social groups that make up The Air Line\r\nLeague and having an umpire and not an empire function, operates\r\nprimarily as a Publicity or Listening organization.\r\n\r\nI might illustrate the need the Look-Up Club is planned to meet and how\r\nit would operate by suggesting what the Club might do with a particular\r\nidea--an idea on which people must really be got together in America\r\nbefore long, if we are to keep on being a nation at all.\r\n\r\nMillions of American laborers go to bed every night and get up every\r\nmorning saying:--\r\n\r\n\"The American employer is getting more money than he earns. We are going\r\nto have our turn now. Nobody can stop us.\"\r\n\r\nResult: Under-production and the Fifty-Cent Dollar.\r\n\r\nThe cure for the American laboring man's under-production and working\r\nmerely for money is to get the American laboring man to believe that the\r\nAmerican employer is working for something besides money--that he is\r\nearning all he gets, that he is working to do a good job--the way he is\r\nsaying the laboring man ought to do. If the American laboring man can be\r\ngot to believe this about his employer, we will soon see the strike and\r\nthe lock-out and the Fifty-Cent Dollar and the economic panic of the\r\nworld all going out together.\r\n\r\nI know personally and through my books and articles hundreds of employers\r\nwho look upon themselves and are looked on by their employees as\r\ngentlemen and sports--men who are in business as masters of a craft,\r\nartists or professional men, who are only making money as a means of\r\nexpressing themselves, making their business a self-expression and\r\nputting themselves and their temperaments and their desires toward others\r\ninto their business as they like.\r\n\r\nIf all employers and all employees knew these men and knew what their\r\nlaborers thought of them and how their laborers get on with them the face\r\nof Labor toward Capital--the face of this country toward the world and\r\ntoward itself and toward every man in it would be changed in a week.\r\n\r\nSuppose I propose to take one of these men and write about him until\r\neverybody knows about him, and to devote the rest of my life to seeing\r\nthat everybody knows these men, and start to do it to-morrow; what would\r\nbe the first thing I would come upon?\r\n\r\nThe first thing I would come upon would be a convention. It is one of the\r\nautomatic ideas or conventions of business men--not to believe in\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE BUSINESS MAN, THE PROFESSIONAL MAN, AND THE ARTIST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is it that if a professional man or an artist does or says a certain\r\nthing--people believe him and that if a business man does or says\r\nprecisely the same thing--most business men are suspicious?\r\n\r\nWhen I say in the first sentence of an article on the front page of the\r\n_Saturday Evening Post_--as I did awhile ago--\"I would pay people to read\r\nwhat I am saying on this page,\"--everybody believes me. As people read on\r\nin one of my articles in the _Post_, they cannot be kept from seeing how\r\negregiously I am enjoying my work. Anybody can see it--that I would pay\r\nup to the limit all the money I can get hold of--my own, or anybody's--to\r\nget other people to enjoy reading my stuff as much as I do. Nobody seems\r\ninclined to deny that if I could afford to--or, if I had to--I would pay\r\nten cents a word to practically any man, to get him to read what I write.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the way I feel about an article in the _Saturday Evening Post_\r\nso fortunate as to be by me--or, about a book written by g.s.l., a man I\r\nknow very well--W. J. ---- feels about a house or about a bank created by\r\nW. J. ----. But if W. J., a designer--contractor--a builder--pretends he\r\nenjoys his creative work in building as much as I enjoy writing--if W.\r\nJ., a business man, were to go around telling people or revealing to\r\npeople that he would like to hire them to be his customers by handing\r\nback to them twenty, thirty or forty per cent of his agreed upon profits\r\nwhen he gets through (which is what he practically does over and over\r\nagain) there are very few business men who would not say at first sight\r\nthat W. J. is a man who ought to be watched.\r\n\r\nAnd he is too, but for precisely turned around reasons most people have\r\nto be watched for. W. J. in designing and constructing a house, or a bank\r\nfor a client, sets as his cost estimate a ten per cent maximum profit for\r\nhimself, as a margin to work on; aiming at six or five per cent profit\r\nfor himself, on small contracts and at a four, three or two and one-half\r\nper cent profit for himself on million dollar ones. Changes and\r\nafterthoughts from his clients in carrying out a contract are inevitable.\r\nW. J. wants a margin on which to allow for contingencies and for his\r\ncustomers' afterthought.\r\n\r\nThe three things that interest W. J. in business are: his work on a\r\nperfect house, his work on a perfect customer and his work on making\r\nenough money to keep people from bothering his work.\r\n\r\nA perfect house is a house built just as he said it would be which comes\r\nout costing less than he said it would cost--possibly a check on his\r\nclient's dinner plate the first night he dines in it.\r\n\r\nA perfect customer is a customer who is so satisfied that he cannot\r\nexpress himself in words but who cannot be kept from trying to--who\r\ncannot be kept from coming back and who cannot be kept from sending\r\neverybody to W. J. he can think of.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of mean typical business men--even men who do this\r\nthemselves, when I tell them about a man like this, is to wonder what is\r\nthe matter with the man and then wonder what is the matter with me.\r\n\r\nThis is what is the matter with the country--the conventional automatic\r\nassumption that millions of men--even men who are not in business merely\r\nto make money themselves--make in general, that we must arrange to run a\r\ncivilization and put up with doing our daily working all day, every day,\r\nin a civilization in which most people are so underwitted, so little\r\ninterested in life, so little interested in what they do, that they are\r\nmerely working for money.\r\n\r\nIf we all stopped believing that this is so, or at least believe it does\r\nnot need to be so, that the country is full of innumerable exceptions and\r\nthat these exceptions are and can be and can be proved to be the rulers\r\nand the coming captains of the world, holding in their hands the fate of\r\nall of us--we would be a new nation in a week.\r\n\r\nIn a year we would increase production fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nThis has happened over and over again in factories where this new spirit\r\nof putting work first and money second, caught from the employers, has\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\nNaturally, inasmuch as W. J. as all people who know him know, has made a\r\nvery great business success of running his business on this principle, of\r\nmaking it a rich, happy and efficient thing, and of doing more things at\r\nonce than merely making money--running a business like any other big\r\nprofession, one of the first things I think of doing is to write\r\nsomething that will make everybody know it. Well, as I have said, the\r\nfirst fact I come on is that many business men do not approve of\r\nbelieving in themselves or in business or in what I say about its being a\r\nprofession, any more than they can help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE NEWS-MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI have recently come in my endeavors as a publicist, as a self-appointed,\r\nself-paid employee of the American people, upon what seems to me a very\r\nastonishing and revolutionary fact.\r\n\r\nI have come to put my faith for the world in its present crisis into two\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n1. The industrial and financial fate of America and the world turns in\r\nthe next few years--or even months, on news--on getting certain people to\r\nknow in the nick of time that if they do not do certain things, certain\r\nthings will happen.\r\n\r\n2. News, in order to be lively and contagious must not be started as a\r\ngeneralization or as a principle. To make news compelling and conclusive\r\none has to say something in particular about somebody in particular.\r\n\r\nHere is the fact I have come on in acting on these principles.\r\n\r\nWhen I find news done up in a man to save a nation with, if I make\r\neverybody know him, the fact I face about my country is this.\r\n\r\nA generalized--that is--a sterilized idea is free. A fertilized or\r\ndramatized idea--an idea done up and dramatized in a man so that\r\neverybody will understand it and be interested in it, is hushed up.\r\n\r\nI am not blaming anybody. I am laying before people and before myself a\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nSuppose that I think it is stupendously to the point just now to\r\nadvertise as a citizen or public man, without profit or suspicion of\r\nprofit to myself and without their knowing it, certain men it would make\r\na new nation for a hundred people to know?\r\n\r\nSuppose that with considerable advantages in the way of being generally\r\ninvited to write about what interests me, instead of indulging in a kind\r\nof spray or spatter work of beneficial publicity--instead of getting off\r\nideas at a nation with a nice elegant literary atomizer, I insist on\r\nmaking ideas do things and I plan on having my ideas done up solidly in\r\nten solid men who will make the ideas look solid and feel catching?\r\n\r\nSuppose inasmuch as in the present desperate crisis of underproduction, a\r\nman who dramatizes--makes alluring, dramatic and exciting the idea of\r\nincreased production or superproducing, seems to the point--suppose I\r\nbegin with W. J.?\r\n\r\nWhat does anyone suppose would happen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nW. J.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf W. J. were dead, or were to die to-morrow, it would be convenient. In\r\nbearing upon our present national crisis it would be thoughtful and\r\npractical of W. J. to die.\r\n\r\nIf W. J.'s worst enemy were to push him off the top of the fortieth story\r\nof the Equitable Building to-morrow morning all I would have to do would\r\nbe to write an article about him in some national weekly, _Saturday\r\nEvening Post_ or _Collier's_, which would be read by four million people.\r\n\r\nBut the _Saturday Evening Post_ or _Collier's_ has no use for W. J. until\r\nhe is dead. It would like to have, of course, but it would not be fair to\r\nthe business men who are paying ten thousand dollars a page to be\r\nadvertised in it, for the _Saturday Evening Post_ to let any other\r\nman--any man who is not dead yet, be advertised in it.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason for the Look-Up Club, a national body--the gathering\r\ntogether of one hundred thousand men of vision to advertise W. J. to--who\r\nwill then turn--the hundred thousand men of vision--and advertise him to\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nThen other men, strategic men like W. J.--men who are dramatizing other\r\nstrategic ideas will be selected to follow W. J. for the one hundred\r\nthousand men of vision to advertise to a hundred million people.\r\n\r\nBy writing a book and having my publisher distribute through the\r\nbookstores a book, I would reach, at best, only one hundred thousand\r\npeople, and I am proposing to reach a hundred million people--to organize\r\na hundred thousand salesmen scattered in five thousand cities and reach\r\nwith my book, the hearts and minds, the daily eight-hour-a-day working\r\nlives of a hundred million people.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Look-Up Club is for. It is an organized flying wedge of\r\none hundred thousand salesmen who have picked each other out for driving\r\ninto the attention of a nation, national ideas.\r\n\r\nThe fate of America and the fate of the world at the present moment turns\r\nupon free advertising written by men who could not be hired to do it--in\r\nbooks distributed by a hundred thousand men who could not be hired to\r\ndistribute them. We are setting to work a national committee of a hundred\r\nthousand men, to unearth in America, advertise, make the common property\r\nof everybody the men who dramatize, who make neighborly and\r\nmatter-of-fact the beliefs a great people will perish if they do not\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nTHE LOOK-UP CLUB LOOKS UP\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are drawing in the next few months in America the plans and\r\nspecifications for a great nation and a new world.\r\n\r\nWe want a Committee of a Hundred Thousand.\r\n\r\nWe are proposing to gather a Look-Up Committee of a hundred thousand men\r\nof constructive imagination in business and other callings, in ten\r\nthousand cities, who will work out together and place before the people,\r\nplans and specifications of what this nation proposes to be like--a\r\npicture of what a hundred million people want.\r\n\r\nThe situation we are trying to meet is one of providing new brain tracks\r\nfor a hundred million people. It will not seem to many people, too much\r\nto say that the quick way to do this, is to form a Club--a Committee in\r\nthis country, of a hundred thousand men to ask to be told about these new\r\nbrain tracks, who will then tell them to the hundred million.\r\n\r\nThe Look-Up Club is a Publicity and Educational Organization for the\r\npurpose of focusing and mobilizing the vision of the people acting as a\r\nclearing house of the vision of the people--gathering, cooerdinating,\r\npooling and determining and distributing the main points in their order\r\nof what the American people believe.\r\n\r\nThe first subject we act in our Publicity Organization as our Listening\r\nConspiracy--our Cooeperative news-service to our members--is the subject\r\nof how cooeperation between capital and labor works. Our first news-service\r\nwill be planned to increase production, decrease the cost of living, stop\r\nstrikes and lockouts, drive out civil war and substitute cooeperation as a\r\nmeans of getting things in American life.\r\n\r\nEvery man who is nominated to membership in the Look-Up Club naturally\r\nasks four questions.\r\n\r\n1. How can I belong?\r\n\r\n2. What does it cost?\r\n\r\n3. What do I undertake to do for the Club?\r\n\r\n4. What do I get--what does the Club do for me?\r\n\r\nThe idea is for each man who is deeply interested, to pick out, to\r\nnominate any fifty men--I put down for instance on my list Franklin P.\r\nLane--among forty-nine others, ask Mr. Lane who the men are he knows in\r\nthis nation, men he has come on in his business in the course of twenty\r\nyears, who are characterized either by having creative imagination\r\nthemselves or by marked power to cooeperate with men who have it.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Lane had given me his fifty, I would ask each of Mr. Lane's\r\nfifty for their fifty and each in turn for their fifty until we had\r\ncovered the country and had picked out and introduced to each other from\r\nMaine to California the men of creative imagination in America.\r\n\r\nOther members will of course be nominated by members of the Air Line\r\nLeague in their respective communities and everybody who is invited to\r\nnominate for the Look-Up section of the Air Line League will be asked to\r\nnominate in three lists--(1) those he thinks of as representing invention\r\nin the nation at large, (2) those he knows or deals with in his own\r\nbusiness or line of activity--all over the country, who have creative\r\nimagination or power of discovery and planning ideas, and (3) those he\r\nknows in his own home-community that he and his neighbors would like to\r\nsee in the Look-Up Club, on the nation's honor roll of men of vision in\r\nthe nation representing his own community.\r\n\r\nThe cost is to be determined by the Club, but is planned as a small\r\nnominal sum--nominal dues for expense of correspondence and conducting\r\nthe activities of the Club.\r\n\r\nWhat a man gets by joining the Club is the association with two or three\r\nthousand members from all over the land at any given time who will be in\r\nthe Club headquarters in a skyscraper hotel of its own, when he comes to\r\nNew York and the advantage of common action and common looking at the\r\nsame things at the same time with the other members of the Club, through\r\nthe activities of the Club by mail.\r\n\r\nThe Look-Up Club Bulletins, pamphlets and little books containing news of\r\ncritical importance and timeliness to all members--news not generally\r\nknown or not available in the same concentrated form in the daily press,\r\nwill be sent to all members for their own use and for distribution to\r\nothers at critical times and places and with strategic persons--labor\r\nunions and employers and public men.\r\n\r\nWhat the Look-Up Club does for a man is to give him the benefit of a\r\nfriendly candid national conspiracy between a hundred thousand men, to\r\nget the news and to pass on the news that counts and to do it all at the\r\nsame time instead of in scattered and meaningless dabs.\r\n\r\nIf the thing each man of a hundred thousand sees once a year in a little\r\nlonely dab of vision all by himself could be seen by all of us by\r\nagreement the same week in the year, we will do the thing we see.\r\n\r\nAnything we see will have to happen. The only reason the thing we see\r\ndoes not happen now, is that we make no arrangements to see it together.\r\n\r\nSeen together, news that looks like a rainbow acts like a pile driver.\r\n\r\nA man becomes a hundred thousand times himself. In the Look-Up Club what\r\na man gets for his own use, is hundred thousand man-power news.\r\n\r\nWhat does a man when he joins the Look-Up Club, undertake to do?\r\n\r\nSend in news when he knows some, and use news when he gets it.\r\n\r\nI do not undertake to say just what each member of the Look-Up Club will\r\nundertake to do with news when he receives it.\r\n\r\nWhen a man receives live news which immediately concerns him and his\r\nnation in the same breath, the way he feels about it and acts about\r\nit--about real news he applies to himself and to his work and the people\r\naround him, will seem to him to come, not under the head of duties to the\r\nClub, but under the head of the things the Club will tempt him to do and\r\nthat he cannot be kept from doing.\r\n\r\nIf a hundred thousand picked men in this country in all walks of life all\r\nget the same news the same week, and then use the news the week they get\r\nit, and put it where other people will use it, we will all know and\r\neverybody else will know what the Look-Up Club is for.\r\n\r\nWe will be carrying out in the Look-Up Club what might be called a\r\nselective draft of vision.\r\n\r\nWe will mobilize and bring to action the vision and the will of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nPROPAGANDY PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI am weary and sad about the word propaganda. I am weary of being\r\npropaganded, or rather of being propaganded at and as regards\r\npropagandafying others myself, or propagandaizing them, whatever it is\r\npublicists and men who are interested in public ideas suppose they do, I\r\nam sad at heart. There is a prayer some one prayed once one tired New\r\nYear's Eve, which appeals to me.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me my Christmases as I forgive them that have Christmased\r\nagainst me.\"\r\n\r\nI could pray the same model outline for a prayer. But for Christmasing,\r\nsubstitute propagandy-izing.\r\n\r\nThe word somehow itself in its own unconscious beauty dramatizes the way\r\nI feel about it. I have written many hundred pages of what I believe\r\nabout reformers--about people who are trying to get other people's\r\nattention, and about advertising, but the brunt of what I believe now is\r\nthat most people if they would stop trying to get other people's\r\nattention and try to get their own, would do more good.\r\n\r\nThe advertising in which I believe is the advertising that is asked for.\r\nI believe in getting a few million people to ask to be advertised to and\r\nto give particulars.\r\n\r\nMore good would be done this way than by turning the whole advertising\r\nidea around and working it wrong end to as we do now.\r\n\r\nFor instance at this present moment I want to know everything about\r\nmyself and against myself, my enemies know. I do not see why I should put\r\nup with my enemies being the ones of all others to know things against me\r\nthat if I knew would be the making of me. What I want to do is to find a\r\nway--make arrangements if I can, to get them to tell me--tell me\r\npolitely--if they can, but tell me.\r\n\r\nIf every person, or party, or group in America to-day would do this,\r\nCapital, Labor, bankers, socialists, Republicans and Democrats, America\r\nwould quit being merely a large nation at once, and begin being a great\r\none. People who have organized to be advertised to will read advertising\r\nmore poignantly, even sometimes perhaps (as I would) more desperately.\r\nThey will get ninety-three per cent value out of advertising they read\r\nwhere now they get three and a half. Everybody who has read advertising\r\nhe has asked for and advertising that has butted in on him whether or no\r\nthe same day, and who has compared for one minute how he has felt about\r\nthem and how he has acted about them, knows that this is true.\r\n\r\nIt is a platitude.\r\n\r\nA platitude that nobody has expressed and that nobody has acted on is a\r\ngreat truth.\r\n\r\nWhat the Air Line League is for, one of the things it is for, is to act\r\non this truth.\r\n\r\nThrough the three branches, the Look-Up Club, the Try-Out Club and the\r\nPut-Through Clan, the Air Line League is an organization not for\r\nasserting or for pushing advertising, but for nationally sucking\r\nadvertising. With its thirty million people joining it, asking to be\r\nadvertised to, and giving particulars, it is to be the National Vacuum\r\nCleaner for Truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE SKILLED CONSUMERS OF PUBLICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the consumers of publicity is that they are not skilled.\r\nThey are not organized to get what they want.\r\n\r\nWe should organize the Consumers of Publicity, make it possible for the\r\npeople of America as readers, to be skilled readers in getting what they\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nWe should make arrangements which would be the equivalent of organizing\r\nSkilled Readers' Labor Saving Unions.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of attaining a power of national listening\r\ntogether--through the press and through pamphlets and books, are so great\r\nthat they can only be overcome practically and immediately, by our having\r\nan organization the members of which join it as they will join the Air\r\nLine League for the express purpose not of advertising--but of being\r\nadvertised to.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental activity of the Air Line League in the present\r\ncrisis of the nation is to be the superimposing upon the advertising of\r\nthe ordinary kind we already have, of free advertising by men who have\r\ncertain ideas and certain types of men they want to advertise to a\r\nspecific twenty or thirty million people who contract with them (as I\r\nwould have often wished my readers would contract with me) to have these\r\nsame men or types of men and ideas, advertised to them.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to overemphasize or overestimate the power of an\r\norganization that exists not to advertise but to be advertised to.\r\n\r\nI say again--if I may be forgiven for the still small voice of\r\nplatitude--a platitude because nobody acts as if he believes it--the most\r\neffective advertising is advertising that is asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNIQUE OF A NATION'S GETTING ITS WAY WITH OTHER NATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFOURTH OF JULY ALL THE YEAR ROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be very convenient for the other nations in the world to-day if\r\nAmerica--being the biggest, the freshest and the most powerful after the\r\nwar and having the other nations for the time being most dependent on it,\r\ncould be the one that they felt most deserved to lead them and have its\r\nway with them.\r\n\r\nIt is almost the personal necessity of forty other nations to-day that\r\nAmerica should be a success, that America instead of instantly\r\ndisappointing the other nations, should instantly prove itself worthy of\r\nthe leadership they would like to place in her hands. \"America's success\r\nis the world's success,\" people keep saying. This has a prettified and\r\npleasant sound--in speaking of a great, or rather of a big, nation.\r\n\r\nBut what of it? What is the fact? What do we wish we could believe is the\r\nfact? What is there--either in our own interests or the interests of\r\nothers that can really be done and done now about the fact--if it is a\r\nfact--by any real person or body of persons in America? As a practical\r\nand not a Fourth of July institution,--or rather as an institution for\r\ncelebrating the Fourth of July all the year round, the Air Line League\r\nlooks upon direct action to be taken by the American people to meet the\r\nworld's particular situation at this time, as follows:\r\n\r\nIf America is to get its way--the way, as we like to think, of democracy\r\nand freedom, with other nations, there are certain things about us the\r\nother nations want to know.\r\n\r\nThe other nations want to know that America has a technique for getting\r\nits way with itself.\r\n\r\nThe nation that has the most self-control will be the nation that as a\r\nmatter of course and of common safety will be asked in the crisis, by the\r\nother nations, to take the lead in controlling order, in controlling or\r\ninsuring the self-control of others.\r\n\r\nThe other nations want to know--if they are going to let us have our way\r\nwith them--put over what we like to call our superior democratic open way\r\nupon them, that we have a vision--a vision of human nature and of modern\r\nlife which is better, clearer, more practical and timely than their\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nThe other nations want to know,--if we are to have our way, that we not\r\nonly have a vision of what our way is--a national vision, but a technique\r\nfor expressing and embodying that national vision. To deserve our way\r\nwith them they must know we have a vision which can be proved, which is\r\nhistoric--the facts of which--specifications, dates, names and places,\r\ncan be placed in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe other nations if they are going to let us have our way with them,\r\nwill want to know by observation that America has not only a vision and a\r\ntechnique for embodying a vision, but that when her vision proves to be\r\nwrong (as during the war) America has a technique for being born again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE VISION AND THE BODY\r\n\r\n\r\nI have dwelt already on what a body for the people would be like and how\r\nit would work.\r\n\r\nI would now like to touch on two facts--the fact that there is a\r\nparticular and desperate need of a vision for the soul of the American\r\npeople at this time, and the fact that the body to express the vision\r\ngrows logically out of what already is and that this body is going to be\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe success of a nation in getting its way with other nations turns on\r\nits having a technique for getting the attention of other nations--on its\r\ngetting connected up with a body through which its spirit can really be\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nThe technique for a nation getting the attention of other nations turns\r\non a nation's getting its own attention, upon the nation's becoming\r\nself-conscious, upon its having a conception, upon its having a vision of\r\naction developing within itself from which a body implacably comes forth.\r\n\r\nThis fact is not supposed to be open to argument. It is a biological\r\nfact--the mysterious and boundless platitude of life. Everybody knows, or\r\nthinks that he thinks that he knows it, but only a few people here and\r\nthere at a time for a short time, in America--inventors, great statesmen,\r\nchildren and lovers are ever caught acting as if they believed it.\r\n\r\nEverything about America that is lively, or powerful, or substantial and\r\nmaterial begins in imaginative desire, in somebody's vision or somebody's\r\nfalling in love and becoming conscious of his own desire.\r\n\r\nThe first thing this nation has to do to have a body is to get its own\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the people of America in the Red Cross achieved a body,\r\nis that some one had a body for--the vision that if all the different\r\nkinds of people we had in America who had never dreamed of doing a thing\r\ntogether before, could be got together to do one thing together now the\r\nworld war could be won.\r\n\r\nThis spectral and visionary-looking idea somehow in the Red Cross, was\r\nnot only the thing that started the Red Cross, but it was the daily\r\nmomentum, the daily mounting up in the hearts of the people that made it\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Red Cross--Mr. Davison and the men he gathered about\r\nhim had a vision of what could be done which other people did not dare to\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the Red Cross was that it was a vision-machine, a machine\r\nfor multiplying one man's vision a millionfold, working out in the sight\r\nof the people three thousand miles a vision greater than the people would\r\nhave thought they could have.\r\n\r\nThis vision which the Red Cross had, which it advertised to people and\r\nmade other people have, is what the people liked about it. The people\r\nthrew down their jewels for it--for something to believe about themselves\r\nand do with themselves greater than they had believed before. They threw\r\ndown their creeds for it. They threw down their class prejudices for\r\nit--a huge buoyant serious daily vision of action in which all classes\r\nand all creeds of people could live and dream and work together every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNo more matter of fact conclusive demonstration of the implacable\r\nsplendid brutal power of vision, of the power of vision to precipitate\r\nacross three thousand miles a body for the souls and the prayers of a\r\npeople, could be imagined than the Red Cross during its great days in the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross became capable of doing what it did because it touched the\r\nimagination of the average humdrum man rich or poor and made him think of\r\nsomebody besides himself. The Red Cross did this by what was practically\r\nan advertising campaign, the advertising of different sets of people, to\r\nall of the others.\r\n\r\nThe result was what looked and felt like a miracle--a kind of apocalypse\r\nof people who have outdone themselves.\r\n\r\nNaturally the people liked it. And naturally people who have watched\r\nthemselves and one another outdoing themselves, can do anything.\r\n\r\nMy own experience is that when I set out to find the real truth about\r\npeople whether it pets me in my feeling about them or not, people turn\r\nout to be incredibly alike. They are all more full of good than they seem\r\nto want me to believe. The only difference is that some of them are more\r\nsuccessful in keeping me from believing in them than others.\r\n\r\nI have taken some satisfaction in seeing in the Red Cross, a nation\r\nbacking me up in this experience with human nature in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE CALL OF A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nearest the American people have come to getting their way in other\r\nnations--to having a vision and a body with which to do it and deserve to\r\ndo it--is in the Red Cross, and in our Food Distribution. In both of\r\nthese organizations we succeeded in getting the attention of others to\r\nwhat we could do for them--and with them--by getting our own attention\r\nfirst and by making our own sacrifice at home first.\r\n\r\nWe were allowed to administer food abroad because we had shown\r\nself-control and sacrifice about food at home and were given headway in\r\nemergency and rescue abroad because millions of people here had a vision\r\nfor others and gave a body to their vision at home.\r\n\r\nI have been filled with sorrow over the way millions of men and women in\r\nthe American Red Cross, their daily lives geared to a great issue, living\r\nevery day with a national international vision suffusing their minds and\r\nhearts and touching everything they said and did, suddenly disappeared as\r\nthe people that they really were and that they seemed to be, from sight.\r\n\r\nI have never understood it, how twenty million men and women out of that\r\none common colossal daily vision of a world, almost in a day, almost in\r\nan hour, across a continent as on some great national spring, snapped\r\nback into the little life.\r\n\r\nI do not know as I would have minded them--three thousand miles of them\r\ngoing back into the convolutions of their own individual lives, but I\r\nhave wished they could have kept the vision, could have taken steps to\r\nmove the vision over, could have taken up the individual lives they had\r\nto go back to and had to live, and live them on the same level, and\r\ndriving through on the same high common momentum of purpose, live them\r\ndaily together.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the every-day individual lives we all are interested in\r\nliving--the necessity of the actual personal things we all are daily\r\ntrying to do, is a necessity so much more splendid and tragic, so much\r\nmore vivid, personal and immediate, so much more adapted to a high and\r\nexhilarating motive and to a noble common desire than the rather\r\nrudimentary showy stupid necessity the Germans thrust upon us could ever\r\ndream of being, that it is hard to understand the way in which the\r\nleaders of the Red Cross in the supreme critical moment when the mere war\r\nwith Germany was being stupendously precipitated into forty wars of forty\r\nnations with themselves, at the very moment when with one touch of a\r\nbutton the new vision of the people could have been turned on instead of\r\nthe old one and the hundred million people stood there asking them,\r\nsnapped off the light, dismissed the hundred million people--clapped them\r\nback into their ten thousand cities into the common life.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent self discovery, the colossal single-heartedness lighting\r\nup the faces of the people whiffed out by one breath of armistice! Who\r\nwould have believed it or who can forgive it?... The Red Cross--the\r\nredeemer, the big brother of nations, holding steady the nerves of a\r\nwhole world--not meeting the emergency of a whole world--the whole world\r\nyesterday tightened up into war, and to-day falling apart into colossal\r\ncomplicated, innumerable, hemming and hawing, stuttering Peace!\r\n\r\nWhat people used to think wealth was, what they used to think might was,\r\nthe power of attracting the whole attention of millions of people is.\r\n\r\nIn the Red Cross a hundred million people--American people, had looked at\r\nthe same thing at the same time with their eyes, they had heard the same\r\nthing at the same time with their ears and they had been doing the same\r\nthing in a thousand ways with their hands. In the Red Cross the feet of a\r\nhundred million people became as the feet of one man.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross had hunted out, accumulated, mounted up and focused the\r\nattention of forty nations. It had in its hands the trigger of a ninety\r\nmile long range gun aimed at the spoilers of the world and the day the\r\narmistice begins we see it deliberately letting the gun go and taking up\r\nin its hand at the very moment the real war of the war was beginning, a\r\npocket pistol instead. Because the war suddenly was everywhere instead of\r\nthe north of France, it reduced to a peace basis. At the very moment when\r\nit had touched the imaginations of forty nations, at the very moment when\r\nit had people all over the world all listening to it and believing in it,\r\nat the very moment when the forty nations could have been turned on to\r\nany problem with it, it let the forty nations go.\r\n\r\nIf I could imagine a hundred million people sitting in a theater as one\r\nman--a hundred million man-power man who could not see anything with his\r\nopera glass, if I were sitting next to him I would suggest his turning\r\nthe screw to the right slowly. I would say, \"Do you see better or worse\r\nas you turn it to the right?\" If I found he saw worse I would tell him to\r\nturn it to the left and then I would leave him to try between the two\r\nuntil he found it.\r\n\r\nThe day after the armistice, this was the chance the Red Cross had. It\r\nhad the chance to turn the screw for us, to avoid for us the national\r\nblank look.\r\n\r\nNaturally after looking at the stage in the hall with our national blank\r\nlook, it was not very long before everybody got up and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was a Focus--a hundred million man-power vision, even if it was only\r\nof bandages, that had made America a great nation a few minutes, and not\r\nunnaturally after a few weeks of armistice had passed by, keeping the\r\nfocus, stopping the national blank look has become the great national\r\ndaily hunger of our people. A hundred million people can be seen asking\r\nfor it from us, every morning when they get up--asking for it as one man.\r\n\r\nTo one who is interested in the economics of attention, and especially in\r\ngetting the attention of nations, it is one of the most stupendous and\r\namazing wastes of sheer spiritual and material energy the world has ever\r\nknown--this spectacle of the way the Red Cross a few months ago with its\r\nmighty finger on the screw of the focus of the world, with its finger on\r\nthe screw of our national opera glass, with its chance to keep a hundred\r\nmillion people from having a blank look, let its chance go.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Air Line League is that it shall take up where it\r\nstopped, the Red Cross vision--the Red Cross spirit.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Air Line League as a matter of fact was first invented as\r\na future for the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross at the end of the war had said it wanted a future invented\r\nfor it, and the first form my idea took (almost page for page in this\r\nbook as the reader will find it) was that this new organization of a body\r\nfor the people, I have in mind, should be started as a New Division for\r\nthe Red Cross.\r\n\r\nBut I soon discovered that what I wanted from the Red Cross for my\r\npurpose was not the organization nor the equipment but the people--the\r\nrank and file of the people in the Red Cross who had made themselves the\r\nsoul of it and who would make the soul of anything--particularly the men\r\nand women who partly before and partly after the armistice, had come to\r\ncool a little--had come to feel the lack of a compelling vision to set\r\nbefore the people of America, which if duly recognized and duly stated by\r\nthe leaders of the Red Cross would have swept over all of us--would have\r\nkept us all actively engaged in it, could have drawn into daily active\r\nlabor in the Red Cross, the day the armistice was signed, ten men and\r\nwomen for victory of a great people over themselves, where in the mere\r\nstress of merely beating Germans, there had been one before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE CALL OF A WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference between a first class nation and a second class nation\r\nmight be illustrated by the history of almost any live man in any live\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nDentists at first pulled teeth and put in new ones. Then they began\r\nfilling them. Now people are paying dentists high prices for keeping them\r\nso that they have no teeth to fill.\r\n\r\nOrthopedic practice has gone through the same revolution. A bone doctor\r\nused to be called in after a leg was broken, and set it. To-day we see a\r\ndoctor in a hospital take up a small boy, hold him firmly in his hands,\r\nand break his legs so that he will have straight legs for life. The next\r\nstage probably will be to begin with bow-legged babies, take their bones\r\nand bend them straight when they are soft, or educate their mothers--to\r\nkeep them from walking too soon.\r\n\r\nThe essential thing that has happened to dentistry is that they now kill\r\nthe germs that decay the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe first natural thing for the Red Cross to do would be the day after\r\nthe armistice to go back to war germs.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross with its branches in every town and every nation in the\r\nworld would announce that from that day on, through a vast new division,\r\nit would occupy itself with germs--with the germs of six inch guns, with\r\nthe germs of submarines. It would deal with the embryology of war.\r\n\r\nThe germs of war between nations, breed in wars between classes, and the\r\ngerms of class war breed in the wars between persons, and the germs of\r\nwar between men and men breed in each man's not keeping peace with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt is when I am having a hard time getting on with Stanley Lee that I am\r\nlikely to have a row with Ivy Lee. It is a colossal understatement to say\r\nthat charity begins at home. Everything does. If a man understands\r\nhimself he can understand anybody. If he gets on with himself the world\r\nwill fall into his hands.\r\n\r\nThe great short cut to stopping war between peoples is to stop war\r\nbetween capital and labor. This is a feat of personality and of\r\nengineering in human nature. It is a home-job, and when we have done it\r\nat home we can sow all nations with it. If I wanted to stop a war between\r\nIvy Lee and me I would have to pick out a series of things to do to Ivy\r\nLee and to say to him which he would like to have me do and say to him.\r\nThen I would pick out in myself things that Ivy Lee does not like to have\r\nme do to him and say to him, and which possibly when I study on them I\r\nwill not want to do.\r\n\r\nUp to Ivy to do the same to me.\r\n\r\nThis is a science. It is not merely a vision or a religion. Removing the\r\ncause of fighting may be a less exact science of mutual study and\r\nself-study, but it is approximately exact. It is also a fascinating and\r\ncontagious science. We master the embryology of war between persons--the\r\nembryology of war between classes, and then between nations. The\r\nprinciples which we demonstrate and set up working samples of in one of\r\nthese problems will prove to be the principles of the others.\r\n\r\nIf people do not believe in germs enough and are more afraid of fire, I\r\nwould change the figure.\r\n\r\nWe are proposing to follow up at once, the Red Cross, which was run as a\r\nfire engine to put or help put out fires between nations, with the Air\r\nLine League which is to be run as a machine for not letting fires between\r\nnations get started.\r\n\r\nEdward A. Filene of Boston in trying to have a successful department\r\nstore found the women behind his counters got very tired standing in the\r\nstreet cars night and morning on the way home and took up with a will\r\ngetting new rapid transit for Boston. He found he could not get rapid\r\ntransit for Boston without helping to get a new government and that he\r\ncould not get a new government without helping to get a new Boston.\r\n\r\nHe then found he could not help get a new Boston without getting new\r\ntrade and industrial conditions in Boston and that he could not help get\r\nnew ideals working in trade and industry in Boston without helping in the\r\nideals of a nation. He then found he could not get a new nation without\r\ntrying to help make several new nations. Then came the International\r\nChamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nSomething like this seems to happen to nearly every man I know who really\r\naccomplishes anything.\r\n\r\nOr any nation.\r\n\r\nFrederick Van Eeden of Holland began life as a painter with marked\r\nsuccess but being a lively and interested man he could not help wondering\r\nwhy people were not getting out of paintings in Holland--his own and\r\nother people's, what they ought to and what they used to, and became a\r\ncritic. He found people did not respond to his ideas of how they ought to\r\nenjoy things and then won distinction as a poet, but why did not more\r\npeople get more out of the best poetry? He then wrote one or two novels\r\nof high quality which Holland was proud of and which were read in several\r\nlanguages, but why did not the people read novels of a high character as\r\nmuch as they did the poorer ones?\r\n\r\nHe decided that it was because people were physically underorganized and\r\nnot whole in body and mind--like the Greeks, and became a physician.\r\n\r\nHe thought he was being thorough when he became a physician but soon\r\nfound that he was not getting down to the causes after all, of people's\r\nnot having whole bodies and fine senses capable of appreciating the finer\r\nthings and soon came to the conclusion that for the most part what was\r\nthe matter with their bodies was due to what was wrong in their habits of\r\nthought and in their minds, and became an alienist and founded the first\r\npsycho-therapeutic hospital in Holland.\r\n\r\nHe then found that in what was the matter with people's minds, he was\r\nstill superficial and that people's minds were wrong because of the\r\nsocial and industrial conditions, ideals and institutions under which\r\nthey were conceived and born, and had to live.\r\n\r\nHe then devoted himself to being a publicist and sociologist, had charge\r\nof bread for the poor during the great bread riots in Amsterdam and is\r\nnow engaged in grappling nationally and internationally with industrial\r\nand civil war as the cause of all failures of men and nations to express\r\nand fulfill their real selves in the world.\r\n\r\nAny nation that wants to be a great nation and to fulfill and express\r\nitself and be a first class nation will sooner or later find that it has\r\nto go on from one individual personal interest to another until it finds\r\nit is doing practically what Frederick Van Eeden did.\r\n\r\nThe only way to look out for, or to express oneself is to try to help\r\neverybody else to.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross at the end of the war in making elaborate and international\r\narrangements to run a pleasant and complimentary ambulance to the relief\r\nof disease in society that society was deliberately creating every day,\r\ninstead of taking advantage at the end of the war of the trust all\r\nclasses had in it, and taking advantage of the attention of forty\r\nnations, of society's best and noblest need, to keep society from causing\r\nthe disease, chose to be superficial, faced away from its vision, fell\r\nbehind the people, absconded from the leadership of the world.\r\n\r\nThe aches and pains of society with which since the war, the Red Cross so\r\npolitely and elegantly deals, which with white kid gloves and without\r\nhurting our feelings it spends our money to relieve are all caused by the\r\nthings we daily do to each other to make the money.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the common people in America recognizes this and recognized\r\nit instantly at the end of the war. The hearts of the men and women of\r\nAmerica to-day, are at once too bitter, too deep and too hopeful not to\r\ninstantly lose interest in a Red Cross which asks them to help run it as\r\na beautiful superficial ambulance to the evils people are doing to one\r\nanother instead of as a machine to help them not to do them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMISSOURI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best service America can render other nations to-day is be\r\nherself--fulfill and make the most of herself.\r\n\r\nSenator Reed of Missouri would probably agree with me in this.\r\n\r\nWhere I differ with Senator Reed is in what America should propose to do\r\nto make the most of herself.\r\n\r\nSenator Reed of Missouri judging from reports of his speeches in the\r\nSenate wants America in the present distraction of nations to stop\r\nthinking of the others, wizen up and be safe.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if America were to cut herself off from the rest of\r\nthe world in its hour of need and just shrivel up into thinking of\r\nherself she would fail to fulfill herself and be like herself. She would\r\njust be like Senator Reed of Missouri.\r\n\r\nNothing could be less safe for America just now than to be like Senator\r\nReed of Missouri.\r\n\r\nSenator Reed puts forward a patriotism which is sincere but reckless. In\r\nthe Senate of fifty states, Reed says \"I'm from Missouri.\" In the\r\ncongress of nations, Reed says \"America ueber Alles.\" \"The world for\r\nAmerica.\" \"America for Missouri.\" \"Missouri for Me!\"\r\n\r\nFor America just at the present moment in the world it has got to belong\r\nto, to turn away and stop being interested in the whole world and in\r\neverybody in it and in what everybody is going to do and be kept from\r\ndoing--is like a man's shutting himself up in his own stateroom and being\r\ninterested in his own port hole in a ship that is going down. It seems\r\nmore sensible for America--even from the point of view of looking out for\r\nherself--not to go down with Senator Reed and moon around in his\r\nstateroom with him, but to be deeply interested in the whole ship, and in\r\nthe engines, the wheelhouse and the pumps.\r\n\r\nPatriotism that just shuts a nation up into a private stateroom nation by\r\nitself or that makes a nation just live with its own life preserver on,\r\nto preserve its own life preserver, can end either for Senator Reed or\r\nfor America in but one way.\r\n\r\nIt's going to end in a plunge of the ship.\r\n\r\nIt is going to end in Senator Reed's running out, and running up to the\r\ndeck the last minute.\r\n\r\nI do not know how other people feel about it, but it seems to me that\r\nfrom the point of view of intelligent self-interest, the spectacle of\r\nSenator Reed of Missouri, tying Missouri like a millstone around his neck\r\nand then casting himself, Missouri and all, into the sea, while it may\r\nhave a certain tragic grandeur in it, can hardly be said to be a\r\npractical or business-like example for his country.\r\n\r\nI would like to show if I can that Senator Reed is wrong, and to present\r\nthe alternative patriotism we propose to stand for in the Air Line\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have said (and have spent forty billion dollars in saying it)\r\nthat democracy cannot be made to work. They sneered at us during the war\r\nand said to England, America and the rest of us that we could not make\r\ndemocracy work in running an army and keep up with Germans in war, and\r\nthey are sneering at us now that we cannot make democracy work in\r\nindustry and keep up with Germans in peace.\r\n\r\nForty nations half-believe that the Germans are right about industrial\r\ndemocracy, about democracy's not being a real, sincere, every day thing,\r\na thing every man can have the good of all day every day of his life, and\r\na good many people in America--extreme reactionaries and extreme\r\nradicals, agree or act as if they agreed with the Germans.\r\n\r\nIf the Germans are right about this, it is very absent-minded for America\r\nto pay very much attention just now to her industries. If America is\r\nliving in a world as insane as Germany says it is, the one thing ahead\r\nfor us to do, and do for the next thirty years, with all the other forty\r\nnations, is to breed men-children, and train men-children fast enough and\r\ngrimly enough to be ready to murder the young men of other nations before\r\nthey murder ours.\r\n\r\nEverything must be geared and geared at once to the Germans' being right.\r\n\r\nOr it must be geared and geared at once to their being wrong, to\r\nchallenging the Germans--to telling them that they are as fooled about\r\nwhat industrial democracy can do in peace, as they were with what it\r\ncould do in war.\r\n\r\nThe one thing we can do in America now to get the Germans or anybody else\r\nto believe us about industrial democracy is to make American democracy in\r\nindustry whip German militarism in industry out of sight in our own labor\r\nunions and in our own factories. Then we will whip German militarism in\r\nindustry out of the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nIf the quickest way for the American people to get a decent world--a\r\nworld we want to do business in, is to whip German militarism in\r\nindustry, and if the quickest way to whip German militarism abroad is to\r\nwhip it at home, why is it we are not everywhere opening up our\r\nfactories, calling in our money and our men and settling down to work?\r\n\r\nWhat is it that is scaring capital and labor away and holding back money\r\nand men?\r\n\r\nThe fear of the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nThe fear and coma of war in all nations, among the men who furnish money\r\nand men who furnish labor, while awaiting for the United States Senate\r\nand other governments not to be afraid of war.\r\n\r\nThe first item on the business schedule of every nation to-day is to stop\r\nthis fear.\r\n\r\nThe first way to stop this fear we have of other nations abroad is to\r\nstop our fear of one another at home, is to watch people we know all\r\nabout us, at desks, at benches and machines on every side, who all day\r\nevery day are making peace work between classes, better than war does.\r\nMaking democracy work in business is the first condition, for America and\r\nthe world of having any business.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely in behalf of other nations, but in behalf of ourselves,\r\nthat I am advocating the direct action of the people welded together into\r\none mass organization, to secure by the direct daily action of the three\r\nclasses together the rights of industrial democracy for each of them. The\r\nAir Line League is proposed not as a bearing-on organization but as a\r\nstanding-by or big-brother organization guarding the free initiative, the\r\nvoluntary self-control of labor and capital and the public, the team work\r\nand mutual self-expression and self-fulfillment of all classes.\r\n\r\nThe whole issue is all folded up in this one issue of industrial\r\ndemocracy--in proving to people by advertising it to them and by\r\ndramatizing it to them that industrial democracy works.\r\n\r\nIt is because the Germans believe that men who have been forced against\r\ntheir wills to do team work, are more efficient, can produce more and\r\ncompete more successfully than enthusiastic and voluntary men doing team\r\nwork because they understand and want to, that Germany is a second-class\r\nnation and that the German people have had to put up for forty years with\r\nbeing second-class human beings. They have a ruling majority of\r\nsecond-class human beings in Germany because they have the most complete\r\nand most exhaustive arrangements any nation has ever dreamed of, for\r\nmaking second-class human beings out of practically anybody--arrangements\r\nfor howling down to people, for telling people what they have got to do\r\nas a substitute for the slower, deeper, more productive course of making\r\nthem want to do it.\r\n\r\nTaking the line of least resistance--the mechanical course in dealing\r\nwith human nature, makes America's being a second-class nation a matter\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nWhat we have always been hoping for in America is that in due time we are\r\ngoing to be a first-class nation--a nation crowded with men and women\r\nwho, wherever they have come from, or whether or not they were first\r\nclass when they came, have been made first class by the way that all day\r\nevery day in their daily work they have been treated by the rest of us\r\nwhen they come to us, and by the way they treat one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nA VICTORY LOAN ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMay 10, 1919\r\n\r\nTHE BOY WHO STUCK HIS FOOT IN\r\n\r\n\r\nA small boy the other day walked up to one of those splendid marble\r\npillars before the The Victory Arch and stuck his foot in.\r\n\r\nI went over and stooped down and felt of the crust. It was about an inch\r\nand a half thick.\r\n\r\nThen I stood in the middle of The Avenue, all New York boiling and\r\nswirling round me and looked up at The Arch of Victory--massive, majestic\r\nwhite and heavenly and soaring against the sky, and my heart ached!\r\n\r\nSomething made me feel suddenly close to the small boy.\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted to know with his foot, was what this splendid Victory Arch\r\nhe had watched his big brave brothers march under and flags wave under,\r\nand bands play through four hours, was made of; how much it amounted\r\nto--how deep the glory had struck in.\r\n\r\nI thought what a colossal tragical honest monument it was of our victory\r\nover the Germans ... forty nations swinging their hats and hurrahing and\r\neighty-seven million unconquered sullen Germans before our eyes in broad\r\ndaylight making a national existence from now on, out of not paying their\r\nbills! ... eighty-seven million Germans we have all got to devote\r\nourselves nationally to sitting on the necks of six hundred years.\r\n\r\nI am not sorry the small boy stuck his foot in. Millions of Americans\r\nthough in a politer way are doing it all this week. We want to poke\r\nthrough to the truth. We want something more than a theater property\r\nVictory Arch, our soldier boys marching under it as if it were a real\r\none!\r\n\r\nWe want four and a half billion dollars this week to make it honest--to\r\ntake down our lath and plaster Arch and put it up in marble instead.\r\n\r\nWe make this week a wager to the world,--a four and a half billion dollar\r\ndare or cry to God that we are not a superficial people, that the\r\nAmerican people will not be put off with a candy victory, all sugar and\r\nhurrahs and tears and empty watery words--that we will chase Peace up,\r\nthat we will work Victory down into the structure of all nations--into\r\nthe eternal underpinning of a world.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime this glorious alluring, sneering beckoning Victory Arch,\r\nall whipped cream and stone froth, a nation's gigantic tragic angel cake,\r\nwith its candy guns and its frosting on it and before our eyes the grim\r\nunconquered souls of eighty-seven million Germans marching through!\r\n\r\nWe will let it stand haunting us, beckoning us along to a victory no\r\nsmall boy, no Bolshevik nation can stick its foot in!\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWhen I corrected the proof of this advertisement--it was the last\r\nadvertisement of the last week of the last Liberty Loan in New York--it\r\nwas not as true of our victory and of the world's victory over the\r\nGermans as it is now. And The Arch of Victory in Madison Square has\r\nmelted away into roar.\r\n\r\nBut the truth I have spoken has not melted away.\r\n\r\nWhat The Air Line League is for in its national and international\r\norganization of the will of a free people to make democracy work, is to\r\nanswer the boy who stuck his foot in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNIQUE OF A NATION'S BEING BORN AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI started this book taking the Crowd for my hero--that faint bodiless\r\nphantasmagoric presence, that helpless fog or mist of humanity called the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nI have proceeded upon two premises.\r\n\r\nA spirit not connected with a body is without a technique, without the\r\nmechanical means of self-expression or self-fulfillment. It is a ghost\r\ntrying to have a family.\r\n\r\nA body not connected with its spirit is without a technique for seeing\r\nwhat to do. It is without the spiritual means of self-expression and\r\nself-fulfillment. It is like a sewing-machine trying to have a family.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers will remember a diagram in \"Crowds\" in which I divided\r\npeople off roughly into\r\n\r\n       Inventors          Artists               Hewers\r\n          or                or\r\n       See-ers           Engineers\r\n                                              Those who work\r\n    Men who invent    Men who invent          out and finish\r\n    things to do.     ways and means          what the see-ers\r\n                      and make it possible    and engineers\r\n                      to do them.             have begun.\r\n\r\nI have based what I have to say in the next few chapters on this anatomy\r\nor rather this biology of a nation's human nature.\r\n\r\nIn the next few pages I am dealing not with the reconstruction but with\r\nthe reconception of a nation.\r\n\r\nReconstruction is a dead difficult laborious thing to try to put off on a\r\nboundless superabundant ganglion of a hundred million lives like the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nIn the crisis that confronts America to-day not only the most easy, but\r\nthe most natural and irresistible way for this nation to be a great\r\nnation is to fall in love.\r\n\r\nI am enlarging in these next few pages upon how crowds and experts--that\r\nis: crowds and their men of vision and engineers can come to an\r\nunderstanding and get together.\r\n\r\nI wish to state certain particular things I think are going to be done by\r\nthe people--that the people may be conscious of themselves, may be drawn\r\ninto the vision of the world and of themselves, that in this their great\r\nhour in history, a great people may be born again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nA man in being born the first time is the invention of others. Being born\r\nagain is the finding of oneself, oneself,--the spiritual invention of\r\none's own life.\r\n\r\nBeing born again is far more intelligent than being born the first time.\r\n\r\nAll one has to do to see this, is to look about and see the people who\r\nhave done it.\r\n\r\nWhen one is being born the first time one does not even know it. One is\r\nnot especially intelligent the first time and could not really help it.\r\nAnd nobody else could help it.\r\n\r\nWhen one is being born again it takes all one can know and all one can\r\nknow and do, and all everybody around one knows, and all everybody around\r\ncan do, to help one do it. In 1776 when America was being born first,\r\nAmerica did not have the slightest idea of what was happening. It has\r\ntaken one hundred and forty-four birthdays to guess.\r\n\r\nA nation is born the first time with its eyes shut.\r\n\r\nBut in this terrible 1920 when America is being born again, she can only\r\nmanage to be born again by knowing all about herself, by disrobing\r\nherself to be born again, by a supreme colossal act of self-devotion,\r\nself-discovery, self-consciousness and consciousness of the world, naked\r\nbefore God, reading the hearts of forty nations, a thousand years and the\r\nunborn, and knowing herself,--slipping off her old self and putting on\r\nher new self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE AIR LINE LEAGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing a spirit in this world usually does to find a body is to\r\nselect a father and mother. The American people if it is to be embodied\r\nand have the satisfaction and power of making itself felt and expressing\r\nitself, can only do so by following the law of life.\r\n\r\nA hundred million people can only get connected with a body, acquire a\r\npresence--find itself as a whole, the way each one of the hundred million\r\npeople did alone.\r\n\r\nIn a nation's being born again three types of mind are necessarily\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe minds in America that create or project, the inventors.\r\n\r\nThe minds that bring up.\r\n\r\nThe minds that conceive and bring to the birth.\r\n\r\nThese three classes of spiritual forces are concerned in America in\r\nmaking the people stop being a ghost, in making their American people as\r\nan idea, physically fit.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be arranged for America to make the people quit being\r\na ghost in The White House, is to form into three bodies or\r\norganizations, these three, groups of men--make these three groups of men\r\nclass-conscious, self-conscious, conscious of their own power and purpose\r\nin America--and have everybody in America conscious of them. I propose\r\nthree organizations to stand for these three life-forces, three\r\norganizations which will act--each of which will act with the other two\r\nand will follow out for a nation, as individuals do for individuals, the\r\nlaw of life--of producing and reproducing the national life.\r\n\r\nThe minds that are creative will discover and project a national idea for\r\nthe people--the inventors, will act as one group.\r\n\r\nThe minds that conceive and bring the idea to the birth, that bring the\r\nidea to pass, called engineers, will act as another, and the minds that\r\nteach, bring up, draw out and apply the idea and relate the idea to\r\nlife--will act as another.\r\n\r\nI propose a club of fifty thousand creative men be selected and act\r\ntogether--that a nation may be conceived.\r\n\r\nI propose that fifty thousand engineers or how-men, men who think out\r\nways and means, be selected and act together, that the nation that is\r\nconceived may be born.\r\n\r\nThese two Clubs will have their national headquarters together in a\r\nskyscraper hotel of their own in New York and will act together--in\r\nbringing an idea for the people into the world.\r\n\r\nThe third Club--twenty or thirty million people, on the scale of the Red\r\nCross--in ten thousand cities, will apply and educate the idea, bring it\r\nup and put it through.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nWhat one's soul is for, I suppose, is that one can use it when one likes,\r\nto contemplate and to enjoy an Idea.\r\n\r\nWhat one has a body for with reference to an idea is to take it up, try\r\nit out and put it through.\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League proposes to cooerdinate these three functions and\r\noperate as a three in one club.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to call the first of the clubs, the club of inventors,\r\nthe Look-Up Club. The second, a club of how-men and engineers, the\r\nTry-Out Club, and the third--the operating club of the vast body of the\r\npeople taking direct action and putting the thing through locally and\r\nnationally would be called The Put-Through Clan.\r\n\r\nThe Air Line League through these three clubs will undertake to help the\r\npeople to stop being an abstraction, to swear off from being a Ghost in\r\ntheir own house. The great working majority of the American people--of\r\nthe men and the women who made the Red Cross so effective during the war,\r\nwhich came to the rescue of the people of the nation with the people of\r\nother nations, will come to the rescue now, during the war the people are\r\nhaving and that the classes of people are having with one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE LOOK-UP CLUB LOOKS UP\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. _For Instance._\r\n\r\nSuch a crisis as this nation has now, Springfield, Massachusetts, had\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nSpringfield a few years ago, all in a few weeks, threw up the chance of\r\nbeing Detroit because two or three automobile men who belonged in\r\nSpringfield and wanted to make Springfield as prosperous as Detroit, were\r\npractically told to go out to Detroit and find the men who would have the\r\nimagination to lend them the money--to make Springfield into a Detroit.\r\n\r\nNaturally when they found bankers with imagination in Detroit they stayed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Springfield is what is going to happen to America if we\r\ndo not make immediate national arrangements for getting men who have\r\nimagination in business in this country, men who can invent manpower, to\r\nknow each other and act together.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five hundred dollars Frank Cousins of Detroit recognized Henry\r\nFord with, a few years ago, he gave back the other day to Henry Ford for\r\ntwenty-nine million dollars.\r\n\r\nPeople say as if that was all there was to it, that the fate of this\r\nnation to-day turns on our national manpower.\r\n\r\nBut what does our national man-power turn on?\r\n\r\nIt turns on people's knowing and knowing in the nick of time, a man when\r\nthey see one.\r\n\r\nMan-power in a democracy like ours turns on having inventors, bankers and\r\ncrowds act together.\r\n\r\nSometimes banks hold things back by being afraid to cooeperate with\r\ninventors or men of practical imagination.\r\n\r\nThis is called conservatism.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is the crowds and laborers who hold things back by being\r\nafraid to cooeperate with leaders or men of imagination.\r\n\r\nBut the fate of all classes turns upon our having men of creative\r\nimagination believed in by men who furnish money, and believed in by men\r\nwho furnish labor.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Look-Up Club is that men of creative imagination shall be\r\ngot together, shall be made class-conscious, shall feel and use their\r\npower themselves and put it where other people can use it.\r\n\r\nHow much time and how many years of producing-power would it have saved\r\nAmerica if Alexander Graham Bell had known or could have had ready to\r\nappeal to, America's first hundred thousand picked men of imagination,\r\nwhen he was trudging around ringing doorbells in Boston, trying to supply\r\npeople with imagination enough to see money in telephones?\r\n\r\nIf William G. McAdoo, when he had invented with his tunnels, a really\r\ngreat conception of the greater New York, and was fighting to get people\r\nin New York to believe in it, and act on it, had had an organization of\r\none hundred thousand picked men of imagination in the nation at large to\r\nappeal to--one hundred thousand men picked out by one another to put a\r\npremium on constructive imagination when they saw some, instead of a\r\npenalty on it, how much time would it have saved New York and saved\r\nMcAdoo? How much time would a national Club like this save this nation\r\nto-day and from now on in its race with the Germans?\r\n\r\nWhy should our men of practical creative imagination to-day waste as much\r\ntime running around and asking permission of people who had none, as\r\nMcAdoo had to?\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIf a hundred thousand silver dollars--just ordinary silver dollars--were\r\nput together in a row in New York on a sidewalk, everybody going by would\r\nhave imagination at once about the one hundred thousand silver dollars\r\nand what could be done with them.\r\n\r\nBut put one hundred thousand picked men--or men of exceptional power\r\ntogether in a row in New York--and why is it everybody is apt to feel at\r\nfirst a little vague and troubled about them, stands off around the\r\ncorner and wonders what can be done with one hundred thousand immortal\r\nhuman beings?\r\n\r\nI wish people would have as much imagination about what could be done\r\nwith one hundred thousand fellow human beings picked out and got together\r\nfrom the men of this nation, as they would have about one hundred\r\nthousand silver dollars.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the first things the Look-Up Club is for, to get people to\r\nbe inspired by a hundred thousand men put together, in the same way that\r\nthey are by a hundred thousand dollars put together.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nI went out last night and walked up the Great White Way and looked at the\r\nlittle flock of hotels that are standing to-day on the site of my faith\r\nin these hundred thousand men--the site of the new hotel--the little\r\nsleeping shelf in the roar of New York for the hundred thousand men to\r\nhave on Broadway.\r\n\r\nI stood and looked at the five or six hotels now standing there waiting\r\nto be torn down for us, and ---- told me that the seventeen parcels of\r\nland in the block that he had labored on forty-seven people to get them\r\nto make up their minds to put their lots together, were worth only a\r\nmillion and a half of dollars, either to them or to anybody else, while\r\nthey were making up their minds to let their lots be put together. And\r\nnow that he had got their minds made up for them and had got all these\r\nfoolish, distracted seventeen parcels of land together into one, the land\r\ninstead of being worth one million and a half dollars, was appraised by\r\n---- the other day as worth four and a half million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the hundred thousand men of practical imagination\r\nscattered in five thousand cities, twiddling on the fate of a nation\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is going to happen to the value of the men that has\r\nhappened to the separate lumps of sand and clay they called real estate\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nWhat can I manage to accomplish alone in trying to get to Chicago\r\nto-morrow morning?\r\n\r\nAll I could do alone would be to walk.\r\n\r\nAs it is, I stand in line a minute at a window in the Grand Central\r\nStation, make a little arrangement with several hundred thousand men and\r\nwith a slip of paper I move to Chicago while I go to sleep.\r\n\r\nThis power for each man of a hundred thousand men is what I am offering\r\nin this little book to the nine hundred and ninety thousand others.\r\n\r\nWhat will we do, what ideas will we carry out?\r\n\r\nGet one hundred thousand picked men together and what can they not do,\r\nwhat ideas can they not carry out?\r\n\r\nWhat is hard, what is priceless, is getting the men and getting the men\r\ntogether. Everybody who has ever done anything knows this.\r\n\r\nWhat we are doing is not to get values together, but the men who keep\r\ncreating the values.\r\n\r\nThe men who have created already the values of five thousand cities,\r\nshall now create values for a nation.\r\n\r\nI am not writing to people--to the hundred thousand men who are going to\r\nbe nominated to the Look-Up Club--to ask them whether they think this\r\nidea of mine--of having the first hundred thousand men of vision of this\r\ncountry in a Club, is going through or not.\r\n\r\nI am writing them and asking them if--if it is going through--they want\r\nto belong to it.\r\n\r\nVery few men can speak with authority--even if they would, as to what the\r\nother ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine men will possibly\r\ndo or not do with my idea in this book. But any man can speak with\r\nauthority and speak immediately when he gets to the end of it, as to how\r\nhe feels himself, whether he wants or likes the idea, and wants to count\r\none to bring the idea to pass.\r\n\r\nI speak up for myself in this book. Anybody can see it. If every man will\r\nconfine himself in the same way, and will stake off himself and attend to\r\nhimself at the end of this book and say what he wants--we will all get\r\nwhat we want.\r\n\r\nThe proposition looks rather big, mathematically, but looked at humanly,\r\nit is a simple straight human-nature question. All I really ask of each\r\nman who is nominated is,\r\n\r\n\"If the first hundred thousand men who have imagination in business are\r\nbeing selected and brought together out of all the other business men in\r\nAmerica, do you want to be one of them? Who are the ten, twenty or fifty\r\nmen of practical vision in business--especially young men, you think\r\nought not to be left out?\"\r\n\r\nIt is all an illusion about numbers and sizes of things.\r\n\r\nThe way to be national is to be personal, for each man to take sides with\r\nthe best in himself.\r\n\r\nSuddenly across a nation we look in a hundred thousand faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. _Why the Look-Up Club Looks Up._\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not provide for an Imagination Department for the\r\nUnited States Government.\r\n\r\nIt has judicial, executive and legislative departments, but a department\r\nmade up of men of vision to create, conceive and reconceive, go deeper\r\nand see further than law and restraints can go, does not exist in our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWe have a Judicial Department to decide on whether what is born has a\r\nright to live--a Legislative Department to pass rules under on how it\r\nshall be obliged to live--and an Executive Department to make it\r\nmind--but the department to create and to conceive for the people is\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nGovernment at best is practically a dear uncle or dear maiden-aunt\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nGovernment as a physical expression is without functions of reproduction.\r\n\r\nGovernment--contrary to the theory of the Germans--from the point of view\r\nof sheer power in projecting and determining the nature and well-being of\r\nmen--the fate of men and the world--is superficial, is a staid,\r\nstandardized, unoriginal affair--devoted to ready-made ideas like the Red\r\nCross during the war.\r\n\r\nThis is what is the matter with a Government's posing in this or any\r\nother nation as a live body for the people.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneous uprising of business men during the war--the spectacle of\r\nthe dollar a year men overwhelming and taking over the government, the\r\nbreaking in of the National Council of Defense--the spontaneous\r\ncombustion of millions of free individuals into one colossal unit like\r\nthe Red Cross--all the other outbreaks of the creative vital power of the\r\nsuperior people of the nation, all point to the fact that when new brain\r\ntracks are called for, the natural irresistible way is to find individual\r\npersons who have them, who make them catching to other individual\r\npersons, and who then give body to them across the nation.\r\n\r\nIts whole nature and action of a Government tend to make Government and\r\nmost of the people in it mechanical.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things and especially in the nature of human nature,\r\nthis nation--if its new ideas and its new brain tracks are to come to\r\nanything at all, they must have a spontaneous willful and comparatively\r\nfree origin and organization of their own.\r\n\r\nHence the Look-Up Club cooeperating with the Try-Out Club to act as an\r\ninformal Imagination Department for the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE TRY-OUT CLUB TRIES OUT\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. _I_ + _You_ = _We._\r\n\r\nIf Darius the Great had put the eunuchs of his court in charge as Special\r\nCommissioners for controlling the social evil in Babylon, they would have\r\nmade very sad work of what they had to do because they would not have\r\nunderstood what it was all about. They would not have had the insight\r\nnecessary to measure their job, to lay out a great engineering project in\r\nhuman nature, determine the difficulties and the working principles and\r\ngo ahead.\r\n\r\nWhat makes a man a man is the way he takes all the knowledge, the\r\npenetrating lively enriching knowledge his selfishness gives--his vision\r\nof what he wants for himself, and all the broadening enriching knowledge\r\nhis unselfishness gives--his imagination about what he wants for others,\r\nand pours the two visions together.\r\n\r\nThe law of business is the law of biology--action--reaction--interaction.\r\nI + You = We.\r\n\r\nIt is getting to be reckless for the people in other nations to sit\r\naround and gossip about how bad it is for the Germans to be so selfish.\r\nIt is reckless for capital to gossip about how selfish labor is--and for\r\nlabor to putter away trying to make capital pure and noble like a labor\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThere are far worse things than selfishness in people.\r\n\r\nBeing fooled about oneself is worse because it is more difficult to get\r\nat, meaner, more cowardly and far more dangerous for others.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThis chapter has been written so far on a pad in my pocket while\r\ninhabiting or rather being packed in as one of the bacilli with twenty\r\nother men, in the long narrow throat or gullet of a dining-car. When I\r\nwas swallowed finally and was duly seated, the man who was coupled off\r\nwith me--a perfect stranger who did not know he was helping me write this\r\nchapter in my book, reached out and started to hand himself the salt and\r\nthen suddenly saw I might want it too and passed it to me.\r\n\r\nHe summed up in three seconds the whole situation of what democracy is,\r\nthe whole question between the Germans and the other peoples of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWith one gesture across a little white table he settled the fate of a\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHis selfishness, his own personal accumulated experience with an egg,\r\nmade him see that he wanted salt in it.\r\n\r\nHis unselfishness made him see that I must be sitting there wanting salt\r\nin an egg as much as he did.\r\n\r\nSo he took what his selfishness made him see on the one hand and what his\r\nunselfishness made him see on the other, put them together and we had the\r\nsalt together.\r\n\r\nIncidentally he finished this chapter and dramatized (just as I was\r\nwishing somebody would before I handed it in) the idea I am trying to\r\nexpress in it. This in a small way is a perfect working model of what I\r\ncall civilization. Unselfishness in business is not a civilization at\r\nall. It is a premature, tired, sickly, fuddle-headed heaven.\r\n\r\nImagination about other people based upon imagination about what one\r\nwants oneself, is the manly, unfooled, clean-cut energy that rules the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe appetites in people which make them selfish supply them with such a\r\nrich big equipment for knowing what other people want, that if they\r\nreally use this equipment in a big business way for getting it for them,\r\nno one can compete with them.\r\n\r\nA righteous man if he has any juice in him at all and is not a mere\r\ngiver, a squush of altruism, a mere negative self-eliminating,\r\nself-give-up, self-go-without person--is a selfish person and an\r\nunselfish person mixed. What he calls his character is the proportion in\r\nwhich he chooses to mix himself.\r\n\r\nHalf the trouble with this poor foolish morally dawdling old world to-day\r\nis that it is still hoping fondly it is going to be pulled straight into\r\nthe kingdom of heaven by morally sterilized, spiritually pasteurized\r\npersons, by men who are trying to set the world right by abolishing the\r\npassions instead of by understanding them, instead of taking the\r\nselfishness and unselfishness we all have, controlling them the way other\r\nantagonisms in nature are controlled and making them work together.\r\n\r\nPeople in other nations are as selfish in their way as the Germans are in\r\ntheirs--capital is as selfish as labor, or labor as capital. The\r\nfundamental virtue in modern business men, the spiritual virility that\r\nmakes for power is their gift of using their selfishness to some purpose,\r\nin understanding people with whom they deal and learning how to give them\r\nwhat they want.\r\n\r\nIt takes more brains to pursue a mutual interest with a man than to slump\r\ndown without noticing him into being an altruist with him. Any man can be\r\na selfish man in a perfectly plain way and any man can be an altruist--if\r\nhe does not notice people enough, but it takes all the brains a man has\r\nand all the religion he has to pursue with the fear of God and the love\r\nof one's kind, a mutual interest with people one would like to give\r\nsomething to and leave alone.\r\n\r\nThis is what I call the soul of true business and of live salesmanship.\r\n\r\nI put it forward as the moral or spiritual basis on which the engineers\r\nin the Try-Out Club, of the Air Line League, propose to act.\r\n\r\nThe way for America to meet the German militaristic and competitive idea\r\nof business and of the business executive--the idea that brought on the\r\nwar, is for America and the rest of the world to put forward something\r\nand put forward something quick, as a substitute for it, sell to\r\nthemselves, sell to one another and to the Germans before it is too late,\r\na substitute for it.\r\n\r\nThe American engineers of business or great executives--the how-men and\r\ninventors of how to bring things to pass, must put forward the pursuit of\r\nmutual interests in the largest sense, pursuit of mutual interests\r\ngenerously and finely conceived, the selfishness and unselfishness mixed,\r\nas this substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. _The Engineer At Work._\r\n\r\nThe crowning glory of a nation is the independence and the spiritedness\r\nof its labor.\r\n\r\nI rejoice daily that the war has made a man expensive, has made it\r\nimpossible for men to succeed in business any longer as employers who do\r\nnot love work, who cannot make other men love their work, and who have\r\nnothing in themselves or in their job or the way they make the job\r\ncatching--who cannot get men to work for them except by offering them\r\nmore money than they can earn.\r\n\r\nThe fact that no man is so cheap he can be had by merely being paid\r\nmoney--the fact that no man is so unimportant but he has to be approached\r\nas a fellow human being and has to be persuaded--and given something\r\nhuman and real, is the first faint flush of hope for our modern world. It\r\nlets in an inkling at last that the industrial world is going to be a\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIf men were made of india-rubber, or reinforced concrete, or wood or\r\nsteel, no one could hope for better or more efficient men to manage big\r\nbusiness than the typical big business men of the phase of American\r\nindustry now coming to an end.\r\n\r\nBut of course in the crisis business is facing now, which turns on the\r\nputting forward of men who understand and can play masterfully upon the\r\nmotives, temptations and powers of ordinary human nature the typical man\r\nwe know at the Mahogany Desk, who has a machine imagination, who sees men\r\nas dots and dreams between piles of dollars and rows of machines, is a\r\nsingularly helpless person and can only hold his own in his own business\r\nby giving way and putting forward in place of himself, men who are\r\nmasters in human nature, experts and inventors in making men want to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the business world that is passing out and the one\r\nthat is coming in, is that the masters of the world who have been proud\r\nbefore, to be called the captains of industry, are going to think of\r\nthemselves and want others to think of them as the fathers of industry.\r\nThe man who orders can no longer order. People will only work and work\r\nhard for the man who fills them with new conceptions, who stirs the\r\ndepths of their lives with desire and hope.\r\n\r\nThe reason that reactionary capital is having trouble with labor, is that\r\nit is putting forward men who order instead of putting forward fathers\r\nand inventors.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the I. W. W. and other labor organizations are having\r\ntrouble with capital, is that their leaders are not inventors. They are\r\ntired conventional men governed by automatic preconceptions, merely doing\r\nover again more loudly and meanly against society, the things that\r\ncapital has already tried and has had to give up because it could not\r\nmake them work.\r\n\r\nOnly inventors--executives who invent and fertilize opportunity for\r\nothers--men who invent ways of making men see values--men who create\r\nvalues and who present people with values they want to work out, are\r\ngoing to get anything--either money or work, from now on, out of anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. _The Engineer and the Game._\r\n\r\nThe time has gone by when a man can say any longer he is not in business\r\nfor the fun of it. He finds he cannot long compete with the men about him\r\nwho are, with engineers and others who are in business for the great game\r\nof producing results, of doing difficult things, of testing their\r\nknowledge, their skill and their strength.\r\n\r\nMaking men want to work has come to be the secret of success in modern\r\nbusiness and the employer who has nothing but wages to offer, nothing in\r\nhis own passion for work which he can make catching to others, can only\r\nget second-rate, half-hearted men and plodders about him. A factory in\r\nwhich the workmen merely work for wages, cannot hope to compete with a\r\nfactory fitted up with picked men proud of their work.\r\n\r\nIt is not going to be necessary to scold people into not being selfish,\r\nor whine people into loving their work. A man who is so thin-blooded that\r\nthe one way he can get work out of himself is to make money--the man who\r\ngrows rich by ordering, by gobbling, and by hiring gobblers and plodders,\r\ncannot function under the new conditions. The guarantee that we are going\r\nto have a civilization now, that business with joy in it and personal\r\ninitiative and motive in the work itself, is going to take possession of\r\nthe markets of the world is based on the fact that labor has to have its\r\nimagination touched in order to work efficiently, and an entirely new\r\nlevel and new type of man--the man who can touch men's imaginations, is\r\nbeing put forward in business to do it.\r\n\r\nThe Engineer is going to have somewhat the quieting effect upon\r\ninstitutions and upon the spirit of unrest in the people, when he is\r\nknown to be in control of the great employers and has made them dependent\r\non him, that the matter of fact and rather conclusive taxi meter in a cab\r\nhas on the man inside, who wants to quarrel with his cabman.\r\n\r\nA business world largely in control of men who have the spirit and the\r\ntechnique of engineers will make unrest more awkward, will make the red\r\nflag look stranger, feel stranger and lonelier every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. _The American Business Sport._\r\n\r\nIf any man ever again in this world finds like Methuselah, the secret of\r\neternal youth, the secret will be found to consist in being, I suspect,\r\nwhat the best American business man already is--what I would call a fine\r\nall-round religious sport.\r\n\r\nSport has certain well-known disadvantages. So has religion. The man who\r\nonce grasps the secret of modern life as practiced by a really big\r\nengineering genius, insists upon having his business allowed all the\r\nadvantages of sport and religion both.\r\n\r\nTo have something on which one spends ten hours a day, which has all the\r\nadvantages without the disadvantages of being a sport, and all the\r\nadvantages without the disadvantages of being a religion, is a find.\r\n\r\nThe typical engineer, like any other thorough-going man treats what he\r\ndoes as a sport. That is, he puts his religion for the fun of it into his\r\nbusiness. His business becomes the continual lark of making his religion\r\nwork. He dramatizes in it his belief in human nature and in God, his\r\nbelief that human nature is not crazy and that God has not been outwitted\r\nin allowing so much of it to exist.\r\n\r\nIt has looked especially reckless during the last four years for God to\r\nlet human nature try to keep on being human nature any longer. Now is the\r\ntime of all others, and Germany is now the country of all others, to show\r\nwith a whole world looking on how essentially sound human nature really\r\nis, and how being human (especially being human in a thing which\r\neverybody cares about and which everybody notices, like business) really\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThere has never been such a chance dreamed of for a nation before in\r\nhistory, the chance America has now of dramatizing to Germans, and\r\ndramatizing through the Germans to everybody, an idea of business\r\nefficiency that shall be in itself not only in its spirit but in its very\r\nsubstance, peace come into the world.\r\n\r\nPeople shall not put up with mere leagues and truces, arbitration boards,\r\nfight-dove-tailings. They shall not sit at tables and twirl laws at\r\npeople--to make them peaceful....\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe only men in modern business who can now hope to get to the top are\r\nthe men who are in a position to hire men who do not work for wages.\r\n\r\nMaking men want to work is the secret of the engineer in production.\r\n\r\nThe secret of modern industry is the secret of the man who loves his\r\nwork. To the sporting man, the gentleman, the man who loves the game, the\r\nprize goes now in competition with Gobblers and Plodders.\r\n\r\nThe Engineer or Winner instead of the Compeller of Men is going to draw\r\nout new kinds and new sizes of laboring men in industry at every point.\r\nThe Engineer we count on in the Try-Out Club is the man who superimposes\r\nupon the normal and suitable motive in his business of being selfish\r\nenough to make money to keep the business up, the motive of the\r\ngentleman, the professional man, the artist, the engineer, the sport--the\r\nmotive of doing a thing for its own sake, and because one likes it.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"I am not in business for the fun of it\" is going by.\r\n\r\nWhat we are going to do with the mere half-alive profit-plodders--the\r\nmere wage gobblers, is not to improve them by making moral eyes at them,\r\nor discipline them by putting down lids of laws over them or by firing\r\ntaxes at them. We are going to discipline men like these by driving them\r\ninto the back streets of business, as anaemic, second-rate and inefficient\r\nmen in bringing things to pass.\r\n\r\nA man who in a tremendous and absorbing adventure like real business is\r\nso thin-blooded or thick-headed that all he can get work out of himself\r\nfor is money, will only be able to get the plodding kind of second-rate\r\nworkers to work for him, _i.e._, he will be able to get only plodders who\r\nmerely work for money, by paying higher wages than other people have\r\nto--by paying higher wages than they can earn.\r\n\r\nIn other words, civilized business, business with joy in it and personal\r\ninitiative and human interest in the work itself, is going to drive\r\nuncivilized plodding half-hearted business out of the markets of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe men who are expressing through the hearts of the people their best,\r\nmore lasting and more powerful selves, in business, who are gathering\r\naround them other people who are doing it, the men who try out their best\r\nselves in business--who invent ways as executives to make their best\r\nselves work for them and for others, are having to-day before our eyes,\r\nthe world placed in their hands. Men who represent vital forces like\r\nthese, are as solid, unconquerable in human life as the force of gravity,\r\nthe multiplication table they are. They find themselves dominating like\r\nradium, penetrating like fresh air, drawing all things to them like the\r\nsky, the stars, like spring, like the love of women and of children and\r\nthe love of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe idea of having imagination about a customer and studying a customer\r\nas a means of winning his trade, his personal enthusiasm and confidence,\r\nis not considered sentimental.\r\n\r\nHaving imagination about one's employees so that they will work in the\r\nsame spirit as the other partners, is no longer considered sentimental\r\nexcept by the type of employer now being driven to the wall because he\r\nhas no technique for making anybody want to work for him. As things go\r\nto-day it is the leader in industry who is trying to keep up a fine\r\ncomfortable feeling of being a captain of industry--the man who feels he\r\nowns everything and owns everybody in sight, who is visionary and\r\nsentimental, who is the Don Quixote of business now.\r\n\r\nThe employer who feels superior to individuals, who looks at men as dots\r\nand dreams--and who expects to deal with a man subconsciously and get on\r\nwith him as if he were not there--the employer who is an absentee in soul\r\nand body, and who gives an order to his men and then goes off and leaves\r\nthem like pumps, hydraulic rams, that of course cannot help slaving away\r\nfor him until they are stopped--the employer who during the first stupid\r\nstages of our new machine-industry, has been allowed to be prominent for\r\na time, now stands exposed as too wooden and incompetent to conduct the\r\nintimately personal, difficult and human institution a factory has got to\r\nbe if it succeeds (in a country with men like ours) in producing goods.\r\n\r\nFrom now on the big man in business is the man who gets work out of\r\npeople that money cannot buy. The man who cannot get the work that money\r\ncannot buy in a few years now, is not going to stand the ghost of a\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nPeople will not believe you if you tell them what the world was like when\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nMastering others so that they have to do what one says is superficial,\r\nmerely a momentarily successful-looking way a man has of being a failure.\r\nThis master has been tried. He has failed. He is the half-inventor of\r\nBolshevism.\r\n\r\nThe real master is not the man who masters men, but who makes them master\r\nthemselves. The masterful man in getting out of people what he wants, is\r\nthe man who makes the people want him to have what he wants--makes them\r\nkeep giving it to him fresh out of their hearts every day.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale national and international criticism the Red Cross workers\r\nmade in the latter months of the Red Cross activities, of the\r\ntouch-the-button and hand-down-the-order methods of many of the business\r\nmen who controlled the activities at home and abroad--of the millions of\r\nworkers in the Red Cross, has been itself a kind of national education in\r\nwhat certain types of American business men placed in power fell\r\ninadvertently into, in trying to treat millions of free people on the\r\nemployer and employee plan.\r\n\r\nBut these men and their whole idea are going by. We are getting down to\r\nthe quick, to the personal and the human, to the sense all good workers\r\nhave of listening and being listened to and of not being overridden. Big\r\nbusiness after this is going to be big in proportion as it makes people\r\nfeel--employees and customers both, that they are listened to, that they\r\nare being dealt with as individual human beings and not as fractions of\r\nindividuals, or as part of some big vague bloodless lump of humanity.\r\n\r\nStudying one's customers so as to make them want to trade with one is\r\nhere to stay.\r\n\r\nTo speak of studying with the best expert skill in the country one's\r\nemployees so as to make them want to work, as humanity, is not quite\r\nbright. It is not humanity. It is business.\r\n\r\nMaking people trade with one instead of making them want to trade with\r\none is recognized as second-rate business. So is making people work for\r\none instead of making them want to work. The business man who depends for\r\nhis business, on customers, or on workers who want to get away and are\r\ngoing to the first minute they can, naturally goes under first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE PUT-THROUGH CLAN PUTS THROUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. _What._\r\n\r\nWe are a people who think in action. Our way of making other nations\r\nthink and of thinking ourselves is to do things.\r\n\r\nThe people who swept into and took over the Red Cross, who dramatized the\r\nAmerican people in the war abroad--are the people who are going to make\r\nwar at home impossible.\r\n\r\nThe big spiritual or material fact about the Red Cross is that it has\r\nbeen a dramatic organization, that for four years it has been an\r\norganization for acting out the feelings, desires, wills and beliefs of a\r\ngreat people toward men who were fighting for liberty.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross has been a great emotional epic play, an expression in\r\naction, of the heart and brain of a mighty nation.\r\n\r\nEmotions by great peoples have been spectacular before, and they have\r\nbeen sentimental and they have been occupied with enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nBut in the Red Cross twenty million people have been as inspired as Saint\r\nFrancis and as practical as a Steel Trust in the same breath.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the future of the Put-Through Clan that lies ahead is that\r\nit shall keep on dramatizing these qualities in the American character at\r\nhome, selecting things to do which shall dramatize our people to one\r\nanother, to themselves and to the people of other nations.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe way to make democracy work is for the people to use their brains,\r\ntheir spirit and their imagination to do team-work with the inventors and\r\nengineers who help express their democracy for them.\r\n\r\nThe platform of the Put-Through Clan is the right of all to be waited on.\r\n\r\nSkilled labor has a right to be waited on by skilled capital.\r\n\r\nSkilled capital has a right to skilled labor in return.\r\n\r\nThe new and stupendous force in modern life from now on is to be the\r\nskilled consumer--the organization of the consumer-group to cooeperate\r\nwith skilled capital and skilled labor, to make it impossible as it is\r\nnow, for unskilled capital, capital which has not the skill to win the\r\npublic, or to win its own labor, and for unskilled labor, labor which\r\ncannot earn its money and takes it whether it earns it or not, to compel\r\nthe consumer by force and by holdups to buy goods they do not want at\r\nprices they are not worth from men with whom they do not want to deal.\r\nThe skilled consumer will organize his skill and deal with the people he\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nAll the people of this country--the consumers (the real employers of all\r\nemployers) have to do, is to whisper in one national whisper through a\r\nhundred thousand grocery stores and other stores what kind of employers\r\nand workmen, what kind of goods and factories they like, and the buyers\r\nand consumers of America instead of taking what is poked out at them\r\nbecause they have to, and being the fools and the slaves of capital and\r\nlabor, will get with a whisper what they request, and we will return and\r\nwill let employers and workmen return, to the status of human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. _How._\r\n\r\nThe test of a man's truth is his technique.\r\n\r\nWhat Mathias Alexander believes about conscious control and making\r\nself-discipline work is true because he does not have to say it. He\r\ndramatizes it.\r\n\r\nAlexander is right in his fundamental idea of giving conscious control to\r\npeople through new brain tracks toward their bodies because they get up\r\nand walk away from him when they have been with him, with their new brain\r\ntracks on. New habits--new psycho-physical habits, like Culebra cuts are\r\nput right through them.\r\n\r\nThe man who conceives or invents may be wrong, the man who experiments or\r\ntries out, may need to be watched, but the man who puts through is\r\ninviolable.\r\n\r\nThe program, the spirit and the function of the Put-Through Clan in a\r\ntown, is to embody truth so baldly and with such a shameless plainness\r\nthat no matter how hard they try, people cannot tug away from it.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThere are three courses we might take in the Put-Through Clan in dealing\r\nwith our town. (1) We can stand for disciplining capital and labor into\r\nshape by passing laws and heaping up penalties. (2) We can let them see\r\nhow much better they can make things by sicking them on to each other and\r\nhaving them discipline each other. (3) We can make fun of both of them\r\nuntil they make fun of themselves and each class begins disciplining\r\nitself. Then general self-discipline will set in. We propose to\r\nindulge--each group of us in the Put-Through Clan--the labor group in the\r\ntown, the employer group and the public group, in self-disciplining\r\nourselves, until the thing is made catching out of sheer shame and\r\ndecency in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. _Psycho-Analysis._\r\n\r\nThe scientific basis for psycho-analysis for a town, or for a labor\r\nunion, or for a Republican or Democratic Party, is found in the facts\r\nthat have been stated by Mathias Alexander in his book and demonstrated\r\nby his work.\r\n\r\nProfessor John Dewey in his introduction to Mr. Alexander's book speaks\r\nof what Mr. Alexander stands for, as Completed Psycho-analysis.\r\n\r\nAs Alexander's technique for pulling one particular man, soul and body,\r\ntogether, is precisely the technique I have in mind for pulling a nation\r\ntogether, I want to dwell on it a moment longer before applying it to the\r\nPut-Through Clan.\r\n\r\nThe first thing a man is always fooled about is his own body and in\r\neverything else he is fooled about, he just branches out from that.\r\n\r\nThe Put-Through Clan proceeds upon the idea that this is as true of his\r\npolitical or social or industrial body to which he belongs as it is of\r\nhis first one.\r\n\r\nReform must be self-reform first.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that the majority of ideas and decisions most people think\r\nthey make with their minds are really made for them and handed up to them\r\nby their bodies--if it is true that what people quite commonly use their\r\nminds for is to keep up appearances, to give rational-looking excuses and\r\nreasons for their wanting what their stomachs and livers and nerves make\r\nthem want, the way to persuade people nowadays is to do what Christ\r\ndid--get their minds out from under the domination of their bodies.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that when a man goes to his dentist with a toothache, he\r\nfinds he does not know which side of his mouth it is on, it is likely to\r\nbe still more true of all the rest of his ideas about himself--his ideas\r\nabout his ideas.\r\n\r\nIf everything about us, about most of us is more or less like this, as\r\nAlexander says--wires or nerves all twisted, sensory impressions upside\r\ndown, half of what is inside our bodies mislaid half the time, the way to\r\nchange people's minds is to change them toward the bodies they are with\r\nand that they are nearest to, first. Then we can branch out and educate\r\nothers--even educate ourselves.\r\n\r\nMillions of grown people, in religion, business and politics to-day in\r\nAmerica can be seen thinking automatically of the world about them in the\r\nterms of themselves, in the terms of their own souls sadly mixed up with\r\ntheir own bodies. We all know such people. The world is just an\r\nextension, a kind of annex or wing, built out from themselves full of\r\nreflections from their own livers, and fitted up throughout with air\r\ncastles, dungeons, twilights, sunrises, after-glows, from their own\r\nprecious interior decorations and bowels and mercies.\r\n\r\nThe basic fact about human nature the Put-Through Clan acts on is the\r\nsimplest thing in the world. We are always having moments of seeing it.\r\nWe all see how true it is in babies we have personally known. We\r\nrecognize it without a qualm in a baby, that his emotions and reflections\r\nabout life, about Time and Eternity, and about things in general are just\r\nreflections of a milk bottle he has just had, or of a milk bottle he has\r\nnot just had and wants to know why.\r\n\r\nI have often tried to translate a baby's cry in his crib, into English.\r\nAs near as I can come to it, it is\r\n\r\n\"I don't think my mother knows WHO I AM!\"\r\n\r\nWhat a baby is really doing is disciplining other people.\r\n\r\nNot so very different after all from Senator Lodge pivoting as he has for\r\nsix months a whole world on himself and on his having his own little way\r\nwith it, disciplining the rest of the Senate, forty nations and a\r\nPresident, and everybody in sight--except himself.\r\n\r\nIf a patient nation could put him in a crib, everybody would understand.\r\nMany people apparently are deceived by his beard, or by his degree at\r\nHarvard, or other clothes. But it is the same thing. What is really\r\nhappening to him--to Senator Lodge is really a kind of spiritual\r\nneuritis. He is cramped, or as the vulgar more perspicuously and\r\ntherefore more fittingly and elegantly put it, his mind is stuck on\r\nhimself. He is imbedded in his own mereness and now as anybody can see\r\nthere is nothing that can be done by anybody with anything, not with a\r\nwhole world for a crowbar, to pry Lodge off himself.\r\n\r\nMost of us know other people like this. Most of us have moments and\r\nsubjects on which as we have remembered afterwards we have needed to be\r\npried off. The same is true, of course, of a political body like the\r\nRepublican or Democratic Party, or of a labor union.\r\n\r\nThe best that most of us--whole towns of us--can do is to get up as we\r\npropose for a whole town to do in the Put-Through Clan on the same\r\nplatform, stand there cheerfully all together on the great general\r\nplatform and admit in chorus sweetly, that we are all probably this\r\nblessed moment and every day being especially fooled more or less by\r\nourselves about ourselves, about the things nearest to us--especially our\r\nown personal bodies and political and industrial souls and bodies. The\r\nonly difference between people who are put into insane asylums and those\r\nof us who are still allowed from day to day a little longer to stay out,\r\nis that we can manage, if we try, some of us, to be more limber about\r\ncalling ourselves fools in time. For all practical purposes in this\r\nworld, it may be said that the people who are wise and deep about keeping\r\nthemselves reminded that they may be crazy any minute, are sane.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to people--to most people when they are grown up is that\r\nthey stop being simple and honest like a baby. But they all have\r\npractically the same essential thought when they are being disagreeable.\r\nThey are trying to make the world around them toe the line to their own\r\ninterior decorations. What they think, what they feel, what they do in\r\nthe little back parlors of their own minds must be daubed on the ceiling\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe joy of toleration, of new ideas, of rows and tiers of their\r\nnon-selves, and of their yet-selves reaching away around them that they\r\ncan still know and share and can still take over and have the use of in\r\naddition to the mere self they already have, they hold off from.\r\n\r\nThis is where the baby has the advantage of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. _Psycho-Analysis for a Town._\r\n\r\nWhen a man thinks of himself and wants other people to think of him as an\r\ninstitution--as a kind of church--of course it makes him very unhappy to\r\nbelieve he is wrong, but the minute he thinks of himself as a means to an\r\nend, thinks of his personality as a tool placed in his hand for getting\r\nwhat he wants or what a world wants--the minute a man thinks of himself\r\nas a kind of spirit-auger, or chisel of the soul, or as a can-opener to\r\ntruth, which if it is a little changed one way or the other, or held\r\ndifferently, will suddenly work--changing himself toward himself, and\r\nbelieving what he would rather not, becomes like any other invention or\r\ndiscovery, a creative pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn saying that the main thing the Put-Through Clan is for in a town, is\r\nto act as town-headquarters for the town's seeing through itself, as a\r\nmeans of making the town the best, the happiest town in the state--as a\r\nmeans of making it a town that deserves anything it wants, I am merely\r\nsaying that the act of self-invention--the act of recreation once entered\r\ninto as a habit is so refreshing and so extraordinary in itself, and so\r\npractical in its results, that when people once see how it really\r\nworks--when towns and parties and industrial groups get once started in\r\nself-discipline, in self-confession, in psycho-analysis and in taking\r\nadvantage of opposite ideas--there is going to be an epidemic in this\r\ncountry, a flu of truth.\r\n\r\nA whole city or a whole town indulging in psycho-analysis finds it less\r\nembarrassing and not more embarrassing than one man does.\r\n\r\nWhen it becomes the thing for a city or for a capital or labor group to\r\nsee through itself and then collect on the benefit of it, the main\r\nthought cities and labor unions and employee managers will have about it\r\nwill be a wonder they had not thought of it and done it before.\r\n\r\nAnd it will be economical, too, if people take the seeing through them\r\nthat has to be done by some one, and do it themselves.\r\n\r\nThree per cent of the conveniences--the public X-ray machines for keeping\r\npeople from being fooled about themselves will be enough.\r\n\r\nThe minute we begin turning the X-ray outfit around and begin trying it\r\nmodestly on ourselves, a small cheap outfit will do.\r\n\r\nIt is a mere phonograph-record to say that nobody likes self-discipline.\r\nWhat people do not like, is trying it, or getting started.\r\n\r\nThere is a sense in which it is possible for a town like\r\nNorthampton--twenty-five thousand people, to have--if it once gets\r\nstarted, almost an orgy of seeing what is the matter with it. It is\r\neasier to be humble in a crowd that is being humble, and a whole town\r\ndisciplining itself instead of being more difficult to imagine, Would be\r\neasier, once start the novelty of one man's doing it.\r\n\r\nWhy should people think that a man who is capable of disciplining himself\r\nis doing it because he thinks he ought to, or why should they be sorry\r\nfor him?\r\n\r\nNo one really thinks of being sorry for Marconi or Edison or Wilbur\r\nWright, or Bell, or any big inventor in business or even for a detective\r\nlike Sherlock Holmes, the whole joy and efficiency of whose life is the\r\nway he steals a march on himself.\r\n\r\nThe very essence and power of being an inventor or a detective or a\r\ndiscoverer, is the way it makes a man jump out around himself, the way he\r\nkeeps on the qui vive not to believe what he likes, goes out and looks\r\nback into the windows he has looked out of all his life.\r\n\r\nPeople must not take the liberty of being sympathetic with a man who does\r\nthis and of thinking he is being noble and doing right.\r\n\r\nIt has never seemed to me that people who look noble and feel noble when\r\nthey are doing right, can ever really do it. I am not putting forward in\r\nthe present tragic crisis of my nation, the idea of self-criticism, of\r\nself-confession, and of self-discipline, with any weak little wistful\r\nidea that beautiful and noble people will blossom up in business all over\r\nthe country and practice them. I am offering self-discipline as a\r\nsubstitute for disciplining other people in business, as a source of\r\noriginality, power and ideas, and as a means of getting and deserving to\r\nget everything one wants. I am offering self-discipline because it works.\r\nPeople who get so low in their minds and who so little see how\r\nself-discipline works that they actually have the face to feel noble and\r\nbeautiful about it when they are having some, cannot make it work. They\r\nmust be leaving most of theirs out....\r\n\r\nThe psychology of self-discipline is the psychology of the inventor.\r\n\r\nThe inventor is the man who lives in the daily habit of criticising his\r\nown mind, and disciplining himself. The source of his creative and\r\noriginal power is that more than other men he keeps facing necessities in\r\nhimself, keeps casting off old selves, old preconceptions and breaking\r\nthrough to new ones.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual and intellectual source of the grip of the inventor upon\r\nmodern life, is that he is a scientist in managing his own human nature\r\nand his own mind, that he had a relentless rejoicing habit of\r\ndisciplining himself.\r\n\r\nIn every renaissance, revival or self-renewal the world has had, people\r\nhave had the time of their lives. The great days of history have been the\r\neras of great candid truth-facing, self-discipline. Self-discipline and\r\nself-discovery go together.\r\n\r\nThere is a greater return on the investment in being born again, in\r\ngetting what one wants, than in anything else in the world.\r\n\r\nIf one sees through himself, he can see through anybody. It explains and\r\nclears up one's enemies and clears one's own life for action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5. _To-morrow._\r\n\r\nI am not writing a beautiful wistful work on how I wish human nature\r\nwould work or hope it is going to work, in America.\r\n\r\nI am recording a grim, matter-of-fact, irresistible, implacable law in\r\nthe biology of progress.\r\n\r\nI am not nagging, teasing or apologizing. I am not saying what I say as\r\nreligion or as the Lord said unto Moses, or even \"as it seems to me.\"\r\n\r\nI am not dealing in what I want to have happen.\r\n\r\nI am dealing in truth as a force and not as a property.\r\n\r\nI am foretelling what has got to happen. People who do not believe it\r\nwill have to get out of the way of it.\r\n\r\nThe conscious control of capital, the conscious control of labor, the\r\nconscious control of the public group--the arrival and the victory of the\r\nmen who get their way by self-control and who are invited by all to have\r\ncontrol of others because they have control of themselves, is a law of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI am not preaching or teasing.\r\n\r\nI am not asking people's permission in this book for certain events.\r\n\r\nThis book is not an attempt to answer the question, \"What is day after\r\nto-morrow's news?\"\r\n\r\nIt is put forth as a prospectus of what has got to happen.\r\n\r\nThe truth is taking hold of us and is seizing us all.\r\n\r\nIt is for us to say.\r\n\r\nThis book is a scenario of a play for a hundred million people to put on\r\nthe stage, and for five hundred million people to act.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6. _Who._\r\n\r\nPeople will be unfair to themselves and unfair to me and will cheat a\r\nnation if any attempt should ever be made to take this book as a\r\nprogram--a program for anybody--and not a spirit.\r\n\r\nThe spirit is the program, and the people who naturally gather around the\r\nspirit and who secrete it will have to be the ones to embody and give it\r\nin the Put-Through Clan, its local and its national expression.\r\n\r\nPicked persons, picked out by all for their known temperament and gift\r\nfor team-work--that is for their put-through spirit or spirit of\r\nthoroughness in getting the victory over themselves and combining\r\nthemselves with others, will need to be the dominating people.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the Clan is that it is to be vivified and penetrated\r\nthroughout with personality, and with respect for personality.\r\n\r\nThis means automatically that the Put-Through Clan is not going to be\r\ndominated by people who will make it a moral-advice, do-you-good,\r\nhand-you-down-welfare institution.\r\n\r\nThe essential point in its program is self-discipline and any discipline\r\nthere may be for others will wait until it is asked for and will be a\r\nby-product of the discipline we are giving ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of the Clan there are certain persons and types of\r\npersons to whom the Clan is always going to be distinctly partial. It is\r\nnever going to treat people alike. People are not--for the time\r\nbeing--alike and are going to be treated as they are.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is impossible as long as people are not treated with\r\ndiscrimination--as long as people cannot feel and do not like to feel\r\nthat what they are, makes a difference in what they get.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that to begin with that the Put-Through Clan, composed as\r\nit is to be of the leading people in all groups--the people whose time\r\nhas a premium placed on it in their own private business, will have a\r\nregular practice of giving the most attention and giving the most power,\r\napproval and backing to those persons with whom the least time brings\r\nthe greatest return.\r\n\r\nThis means automatically extreme reactionaries and extreme revolutionists\r\nin industry in getting what they want through the Put-Through Clan, will\r\nhave to stand further down the queue than others.\r\n\r\nI am only speaking for myself of course, as one person, as\r\nrepresentative--possibly more possibly less of others in the Clan. Any\r\nscintilla or fleck of truth I can pick off from a revolutionary, I take\r\nbut I will not take him. The same is true of a standpatter or\r\nreactionary. I want to know all he knows. If I take his truth I can use\r\nit, if I take him I will find him cumbersome. Life is too short to spend\r\nten hours on him when ten minutes would do as much with some one who\r\ncould listen or converse or with whom one could exchange thoughts and\r\nactions instead of papal bulls, orders and explosions.\r\n\r\nPeople who do not listen--extreme reactionaries and extreme\r\nrevolutionists, really ought, in getting the attention and the backing\r\nthey want in the Put-Through Clan, to have what comes last and what is\r\nleft over from the day's work.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair that people should get attention in proportion as a\r\nlittle attention goes a great way.\r\n\r\nIf people do not listen it takes too much time to deal with them. Besides\r\nwhich, of course, giving what they want to people who do not listen--to\r\npeople who in the very face of it, cannot be trusted to notice or\r\nconsider others--people who are always getting up and going out, who move\r\nin an idle thoughtless rut of ultimatums, is dangerous.\r\n\r\nPeople who are in the mood and the habit of ultimatums will naturally be\r\npicked out by the Put-Through Clan as the last people they will hurry\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nExtreme reactionaries and extreme revolutionaries apparently will have to\r\nbe carried and supported by society, kept on as it were on the spiritual\r\ntown farm or under surveillance, or in the workhouse or slave pen of\r\nthinking they prefer, until they can come out and listen and treat the\r\nrest of us as fellow human beings.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nOn the same principle of time economy and of being fair to all, the\r\nPut-Through Clan will find itself coming to its decisions and giving its\r\nbacking to people--to capital groups and labor groups in proportion as\r\nthey are spirited.\r\n\r\nThe people who give the most return on the investment--the people who\r\ngive the most quick thorough and spirited response--in the general\r\ninterests of a world that is waiting to be decent must be the ones who\r\nshall be waited on first.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to see why it is so generally supposed that people\r\nwho have so little spiritual power that they cannot even summon up enough\r\nspirit not to be ugly, should be spoken of as spirited.\r\n\r\nI would define spirited labor as labor which uses its imagination, labor\r\nwhich thinks and tries to understand how to get what it wants instead of\r\nmerely indulging in wild destructive self-expression and worship of its\r\nown emotion about what it does not want.\r\n\r\nSpirited labor is inventive and constructive toward those with whom it\r\ndisagrees and wants to come to terms.\r\n\r\nRevolutionaries and reactionaries are tired and automatic, tumtytumming\r\npeople--who do not want to think.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that spiritually tired people are to blame for being\r\ntired. I am pointing out a fact to be acted on.\r\n\r\nTired people always want the same thing. They want a thing to stay as it\r\nis--or they want it to stay just as it is--upside down. The same\r\ninefficiency, fear and weakness, meanness--merely another set of people\r\nrunning the inefficiency and trying to make fear, weakness, meanness\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis is where the Put-Through Clan of the Air Line League comes in. The\r\nPut-Through Clan will throw the local and national influence of twenty\r\nmillion consumers on to the side of spirited or team-work capital and\r\nlabor, and will discourage, make ridiculous and impossible, the scared\r\nfighting capital and the scared fighting labor with which we are now\r\nbeing troubled.\r\n\r\nThe real line of demarcation in modern industry is not between capital\r\nand labor, but between spirited capital and labor that want to work,\r\ncreate and construct, on the one hand, and unspirited capital and labor,\r\nworking as little and thinking as little as they can, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe majority of revolutionaries are people who without taking any trouble\r\nto study or understand anything, or to change anything, just turn it\r\nthoughtlessly upside down--substitute their inefficiency for the other\r\nman's.\r\n\r\nExtreme revolutionaries generally talk about freedom, but until they can\r\nget us to believe they are going to allow freedom to others, the world is\r\nnot going to let them--of all people, have any.\r\n\r\nThe bottom fact about revolutionary labor like revolutionary capital is\r\nthat it is tired. Revolutionary labor is not spirited. It is as\r\nsoggy-minded, thoughtless and automatic to be a revolutionist to-day as\r\nit is to be a Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nIt takes originality to construct and to change things and change the\r\nhearts and minds of people and the spirit of a nation.\r\n\r\nAnybody can be a revolutionist or a reactionary. All one has to do is to\r\nstop thinking and sag, or stop thinking and slash.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe mills of the gods grind slowly because they grind fine. The main\r\ndifference between men and the gods is that when men do things on a large\r\nscale they are apt to slur things over and be mechanical, do things in\r\nhuge empty swoops--pass over details and particular persons, and the gods\r\nwhen they do things on a large scale pay more attention to details, to\r\nmicrobes and to particular persons than ever.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIn national issues of capital and labor, the opinions of employers and\r\nworkmen who have worked out a way of meeting the crisis on a smaller\r\nscale, who understand one another on a five or six hundred scale instead\r\nof a two or three million scale, would be treated by the Air Line League\r\nas probably weighty and conclusive. Those classes of employers and\r\nemployees who in a marked degree have failed to have the brains to\r\nunderstand each other even in the flesh and at hand with both persons in\r\nview themselves, must expect to have their national opinions about\r\nnational labor and national capital discounted by the Clan. The\r\nPut-Through Clan nationally will grade the listening and ranking of the\r\ndemands of industrial groups upon the assumption that people who slur\r\nover what is next door are not apt to be deep about things that are\r\nfurther away.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 7. _The Town Fireplace._\r\n\r\nThe outstanding fact about our modern machine civilization and its\r\ntroubles is that crowd-thinking has seized the people--that people see\r\nthings and do things gregariously. We have herds of fractions of men,\r\nacting as fractions of men and not as human beings.\r\n\r\nEach fraction is trying to get the whole country to be a fraction. Being\r\na fraction themselves they want a fraction of a country.\r\n\r\nTen differing men can get together and agree.\r\n\r\nTen differing crowds of men--of the same men, will get together and\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nCrowds are self-hypnotized. A man who would not be hypnotized off into a\r\nfraction of a man alone, with enough men to help him becomes a thousandth\r\nor ten thousandth of a man in twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nIf five crowds of a hundred thousand men each could sit down together\r\naround a fireplace and listen to the others--if each crowd of a hundred\r\nthousand could feel listened to absolutely--listened to by the other four\r\nhundred thousand, for one evening, democracy would be safe for the world\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nAs it is, each crowd sits in Madison Square Garden alone--holds a vast\r\nlonely reverie all alone, hypnotizes itself and then goes out and fights.\r\n\r\nOf course there are the crowds on paper, too. Ink-mobs roam the streets.\r\n\r\nCrowds do not get on as individual persons do, because individual crowds\r\ncannot get physically and humanly together.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally noted that the best radical labor leaders who come\r\ninto definite personal contact with employers grow quite generally\r\nconservative and that the best conservative leaders become what would\r\nhave once seemed to them radical when they really learn how to lead.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that when they begin to learn as leaders how things really are,\r\nthey are so often impeached by the crowds they represent--by capital and\r\nlabor?\r\n\r\nThe moment there are conveniences for crowds--for the rank and file of\r\ncrowds to catch up to their leaders, to see things whole, too--the moment\r\nwe have the machinery for crowds being able to have the spiritual and\r\npersonal experiences their leaders have with the other side, crowds will\r\nstop dismissing their leaders--the moment they see both sides, and get\r\npractical, too.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the local chapter of the Put-Through Clan, is to find a\r\nmeans in each town of getting all crowds and groups together regularly as\r\none group revealing themselves, listening and being listened to, and\r\nconfiding themselves to team-thinking and to doing team-work together.\r\n\r\nThe Put-Through Clan headquarters in a town will be the Town Fireplace\r\nfor Crowds. It will be the warmest, liveliest, manliest, most genial\r\nresort in town--where all the live men and real men who seek real\r\ncontacts and care about men who do, will get together. The refreshing and\r\nemancipating experience many men had in army camps will be carried on and\r\nbecome a daily force in the daily life of every town in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 8. _The Sign on the World._\r\n\r\nI looked up yesterday and saw a sign on a church in New York. I like it\r\nbetter every time I go by.\r\n\r\nTHIS CHURCH IS OPEN ALL DAY EVERY DAY FOR PRAYER, MEDITATION AND\r\nBUSINESS.\r\n\r\nI have been wondering just who the man is who had the horse-sense and\r\npiety to take up the secret of business and the grip of religion both,\r\ntelegraph them into ten words like this, and make a stone church say them\r\nat people a thousand a minute, on the busiest part of the busiest street\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nWhoever the man is, he stands for the business men we want for the\r\nPut-Through Clan first.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things the Put-Through Clan is going to dramatize is\r\nthis sign on the Marble Collegiate Church.\r\n\r\nThe men in America in the next twenty years who are going to carry\r\neverything before them in business, drive everybody and everything out of\r\ntheir way, take possession of the great streets and the great factories\r\nin the name of God and the people, are the men who practice daily the\r\nspirit of this sign, the men in business who refuse to go tumtytumming\r\nalong in a kind of thoughtless inertia of motion, doing what everybody's\r\ndoing in business--the men who turn one side (by whatever name they call\r\nit) to pray, to snuggle up to God and think.\r\n\r\nMen who have success before them in business are the men who have the\r\nmost imagination in business.\r\n\r\nImagination with most of us consists in taking time to see things before\r\nother people do, in connecting up what we do with its larger, deeper,\r\nmore permanent relations, relating what we do to ourselves, to others, to\r\nour time and generation, to the things we have done before and to the\r\nthings that must be done next.\r\n\r\n\"Prayer, Meditation and Business.\"\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how these words, when one comes on a man who does not say\r\nanything about it and puts them together, tone each other up.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the Put-Through Clan is going to do in a town in this\r\npresent tipply and tragic world, is to stand by and help make known to\r\neverybody across a continent the men in business who stand by these\r\nwords--who mix them so people cannot tell them apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nWHAT THE PEOPLE EXPECT OF THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE BIG BROTHER OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were writing a book to be used during a Presidential campaign, used\r\nas a handbook of the beliefs of the people--a book in the next few weeks\r\nfor a nation to say yes or no to, for a great people to go before their\r\nconventions with, the first belief I would put down for the new President\r\nto run on would be the belief that every man in this country is a bigger,\r\nbetter and truer man than the present arrangements of our industrial and\r\nsocial life seem willing to let him express.\r\n\r\nWe are all practically waiting in crowds to-day, all over this\r\ncountry--in held-in and held-back crowds, to act better than we look.\r\n\r\nThis belief is the first belief--the first practical working belief the\r\nnext President of this country should have about the people.\r\n\r\nPutting this belief forward as a hardheaded every-day working belief\r\nabout human nature in America, is going to be the way to get a President\r\nfor our next President who shall release the spirit of the nation, and\r\nreveal to a world not only in promise but in action that the people of\r\nAmerica are as great a people, as true, level-eyed and steady-hearted a\r\npeople as the spent and weary peoples of Europe have hoped we were.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with America in her own eyes and the eyes of the world\r\nto-day, is not that we are not what has been hoped of us, but that the\r\nindustrial machine we have heaped up on our backs, does not let us\r\nexpress ourselves to ourselves or to others as we really are.\r\n\r\nThe first moment we find that as clear-cut conclusive and perfect\r\narrangements are made for people's being good as are now being made for\r\ntheir being bad, the goodness in each man and in each class in America,\r\nwhich now takes the form of telling other men and other classes, they\r\nought to be good--the goodness in each man which in our present system he\r\nbottles up until a more convenient season, or lets peter out into good\r\nadvice, will under our new machine or our modified system, be allowed to\r\nthe man himself. No man with things as they are now going, can feel quite\r\nsafe just now with his own private goodness. He has to run to the labor\r\nunions or the Manufacturers' Association to make sure he has a right to\r\nbe as good or as human or as reasonable as he wants to be. No man feels\r\nhe can let himself go and be as good as he likes, because nobody else is\r\ndoing it and because there is no provision for what happens to a man now,\r\nand happens to him quick, who is being more good than he has to be.\r\n\r\nThe mean things we are doing on a large scale to one another just now in\r\nAmerica, are not mean things it is our nature to do. We have let our\r\nmachines get on top of us and wave our meanness at people over our heads.\r\nOur machines which capital and labor have for expressing us as employers\r\nand workmen to one another, caricature us.\r\n\r\nAll one has to do to see this, is to look about and observe the way in\r\nwhich our present machines of trusts and labor unions are working\r\ntogether to make a dollar worth fifty cents.\r\n\r\nThe reason the dollar is only worth fifty cents is that nearly everybody\r\nwho has anything to do with the dollar feels conscientiously that he owes\r\nit to himself and to his class to furnish as little work for a dollar as\r\nhe dares and take a dollar for fifty cents' worth of work.\r\n\r\nEach man sees this several times a day, but he belongs to a vast machine\r\nfor getting something for nothing. Every man knows in his heart that the\r\ncure for everybody's trying to get something for nothing is everybody's\r\nat once getting to work doing more than he has to for the money. Then the\r\nAmerican dollar will quit being worth fifty cents.\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't he do it? Because the machinery he belongs with and that\r\neverybody belongs with consists of two great something-for-nothing\r\nmachines. Both of these stupendous machines of capital and labor are\r\ngeared for backing in producing and not for going forward. All that has\r\nto be done with them is to run them the other way round and we have what\r\nwe want.\r\n\r\nPeople on both sides admit in a vague anonymous scattered fashion that\r\nthe way to meet a situation in which prices are too high is for everybody\r\nto produce more and to charge less for what he produces.\r\n\r\nBut labor will not do this if capital does not do it.\r\n\r\nCapital will not do this if labor does not do it.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be done by one man getting up all alone and saying he will get\r\non with half a profit or half a wage when he sees everybody about him\r\ngetting on with twice as much.\r\n\r\nThe only way it can be done is by organizing, by arranging machines for\r\nmutual frank expression, confession and cooeperation--mutual confession\r\nand cooeperation by the men in each industry saying, \"I will if you will,\"\r\nuntil we cover the nation.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the first things anti-Bolshevik capital and anti-Bolshevik\r\nlabor are going to stand for--the organizing and advertising in their own\r\nindustry of a voluntary understanding and professional producing among\r\nmen who produce.\r\n\r\nThe men who are increasing the cost of flour by having too high wages in\r\nflour mills, will say to men who are increasing the cost of cotton by too\r\nhigh wages in cotton mills, \"We will make cheaper cotton for you, if you\r\nwill make cheaper flour for us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not a matter of meanness in American human nature we are dealing\r\nwith, it is a matter of agreement between men--hundreds and thousands and\r\nmillions of men, who do not feel mean or want to be mean and who are\r\ntrying to slink out of it.\r\n\r\nThe thing cannot be done without mutual agreement and the agreement\r\nprobably cannot be made without voluntary contagious publicity, without\r\norganizing a national \"I will if you will\" between capital and labor. The\r\nmen who produce with their minds will say to those who work with their\r\nhands, \"We will agree to take less profits and reduce the prices that you\r\npay for goods, if you will agree to take less wages and produce more.\"\r\n\r\nCapital will say to labor, \"If you will produce ten per cent more, we\r\nwill scale down prices, make your dollar buy twenty per cent more. For\r\nevery sacrifice by which you make a dollar buy more, we will make twice\r\nthe sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nHaving a larger margin and more time to think things out than men who\r\nwork with their hands have to think things out, many employers are going\r\nto feel that it is up to them not to ask their men to do anything they do\r\nnot do twice as much of themselves. They will have machinery for being\r\nconfidential with the men and for letting the men see they are doing it.\r\n\r\nInstead of having everybody rushing wildly around organizing to say \"I\r\nwon't if you won't\" we will arrange to have a hundred thousand picked\r\ncapitalists and picked laboring men in ten thousand cities, who will set\r\ngoing everywhere a huge public voluntary national \"I WILL IF YOU WILL.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of proceeding from now on to assume that we are a mean people in\r\nAmerica, and making larger and more handsome arrangements for being\r\nmeaner than ever, still mightier engines for bracing against each other,\r\nwe will turn to all together and make in the next four years a machine\r\ntogether that will express our better natures as well as our present one\r\ndoes our worst ones.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing we propose to stand out for and that we do not intend\r\nto be wheedled out of, in our next two political conventions and during\r\nour next President's next four years, and that is that our two great\r\nmachines in this country, our industrial one and our political one, shall\r\nbe taken out of the hands of men who are fooled about themselves and who\r\nwill not listen to others.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that there is anything essentially the matter with what\r\nis called our capitalistic system or our labor union system except\r\nmen--the men who think they belong in the front ranks of capital and the\r\nfront ranks of labor.\r\n\r\nThe scared men and the men who are fooled about themselves in politics\r\nand business and who are trying to fool the rest of us, who are trying to\r\nmake a great, simple, clean-hearted, clear-eyed, generous country like\r\nours look and act every few weeks or every few days as if all the people\r\nin it could really do to express themselves to one another and to the\r\nworld, was with lockouts, strikes, political deadlocks, minority holdups\r\nand party threats--shall be turned out of office by the people and\r\nhuddled away out of sight.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial and political expressing and acting machines on every\r\nhand we give notice we are going to pick men out, men who shall make our\r\nmachines express us, our freedom, our justice, our steadiness of heart,\r\nand our belief in America, in ourselves, in one another, or our desire to\r\nlisten to those who disagree with us, our human sporting instinct about\r\nour party and ourselves, and the victory of the people, the common sense\r\nand good will of common human nature in America and the world.\r\n\r\nTo the great capitalists who instead of being fellow laborers, are still\r\nmooning absent-mindedly about in the last century, still prinking\r\nthemselves as the owners of their world, and still thinking of themselves\r\nas the captains or military leaders of industry--to the labor union Dukes\r\nand Dictators that capitalists like this have created to fight them--the\r\nhundred million people appointed to run this country, give notice.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nI would like if I could to publish this book with blank pages for a few\r\nmillion signatures--and a place for the new President or proposed\r\nPresident to sign, too.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential candidate we want, would have it in him to put his name\r\ndown with the rest--with something like this, perhaps--\"I do not say I\r\ncould sign every paragraph in this book, but the general idea and program\r\nof organizing and giving body to the will of the people as expressed in\r\nthis book--the spirit and direction of it and in the main the technique\r\nfor getting it, I sign for.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that the American people when they know in reality, as they do\r\nknow at heart, what I am believing in this book, would be inclined in\r\nlooking up their candidate for President to pick out a President who\r\nwould have written this book--the gist of it--if he had had time.\r\n\r\nAt all events here it is--this program or handbook of the beliefs for a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI put it forth as being more concrete than political party platforms\r\nare--and as a practical and plain way for a nation to look over a\r\nPresident, find him out, and follow him up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO CARRIES THE BUNCH OF KEYS FOR THE NATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowds have to be unlocked to each other. The temperament of our\r\nPresident for the next four years, in its bearing on the mood of the\r\nnation, is to be the temperament of unlocking the crowds to each other.\r\n\r\nAt present it looks as if our President for the next four years would be\r\nperhaps the loneliest President America ever had. When our next\r\nPresident, when he gets into the White House, looks at our people and\r\nhears what they say and watches what they do, he could not but have times\r\nof being lonely with the people. The people are lonely with one another.\r\nAnybody can go out into the street anywhere in America to-night and be\r\nlonely about the peace treaty, the world war, or civil war. Any man can\r\ntake any crowded street and see for himself. He can pass miles of men who\r\nin their hearts are calling him a coward because he has one idea of how\r\nto defend America and they have another. If one were to take any ten\r\nblocks of Broadway and let all the people walking along stop just where\r\nthey are and begin talking with the men right next to them about what we\r\nought to do in this war, they will begin thinking they are not Americans,\r\nwanting to throw each other off over the edge of the country--partitioning\r\neach other off into mollycoddles, traitors, pussy-foots, safety-firsts,\r\nbullies, braggarts and Bolshevists and pacifists--and while they might\r\nkeep up appearances and try to be polite on the surface with strangers,\r\nthat whole section of Broadway would be mad all through for ten blocks.\r\nOne would have ten blocks of feeling superior and despising people--every\r\nman looking askance at every other man for having a different idea of\r\nAmerica from his idea of America.\r\n\r\nIf the President were to steal along through the ten blocks and overhear\r\nthe people, he would feel lonely with them. The only way not to feel\r\nlonely on ten blocks of Broadway just now would be to put up signs and\r\nlabels over doors of theaters and announce speakers and check people off\r\nas they go along, into separate audiences. The League of Nations or the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor would sort out a thousand people on Broadway\r\nand coop them up in a hall to agree with each other, and the I. W. W.\r\ncould sort out another thousand and coop them up in a hall to agree with\r\neach other, but if there ever were any way of holding down a whole\r\nhallful of people and making them listen hard to another whole hallful of\r\npeople, all that would be left after a minute of listening would be each\r\naudience shouting pooh! pooh! to the other audience and saying \"You are\r\nnot America. We only are America!\"\r\n\r\nThis makes the President lonely. We elected him a few months ago to be\r\nPresident of all of us. It is slow work being President, being a good\r\nmixer, when there are ten groups of people who will not listen and who\r\nall turn on you and hate you, rend you if you try to get them to listen\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nThe way the President is going to meet this issue and insist until we all\r\nthank him for it--on being President of all of us, is with his\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S TEMPERAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were writing a book for the next President to run for President\r\non--a thing I have guilty moments of hoping I am doing--the first thing I\r\nwould arrange for in the book, would be to put down in it two platforms\r\nfor him to run on--one platform on what he believes and the other\r\nplatform--the way he believes it and gets other people to believe it.\r\n\r\nThe way the next President we pick out, does his believing, the way he\r\nkeeps from believing weakly what he wants to, and from being fooled about\r\nhis party and about himself, the clean-cutness and honesty of his mind,\r\nthe tone, the ring in which he believes in himself and gets other people\r\nto believe in him, is going to be, from the point of view of his getting\r\nfor this country at home and abroad, what it wants, the most important\r\nthing about him.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the next President's platform is going to be,\r\nin the eyes of the people, his character, his temperament, the way his\r\npersonal traits and habits dramatize what he says, the way he lives what\r\nhe believes.\r\n\r\nThe American people may not be shrewd about seers, or about historians or\r\nphilosophers, but they are very likely any minute to be deep about\r\npeople. When Henry Cabot Lodge draws a rough sketch in chalk of history\r\nhe wants a hundred million people to help him make, and when he is being\r\nfooled about it and is all out of perspective the people may defer to\r\nhim, may feel Mr. Lodge is too deep for them, but the moment they see Mr.\r\nLodge being fooled about himself, they find Mr. Lodge easy.\r\n\r\nIn a trait in human nature like this, with which they are familiar every\r\nday, a hundred million people--without trying, are deep.\r\n\r\nIf a hundred million people could sit down and write a book--a book or\r\nopen letter addressed in the next two months to those two big vague,\r\nwhoofy Nobodies we call our Political Parties, and tell them in so many\r\nwords the kind of President the people want and understand--the kind of\r\nPresident the people would sweep in unspeakably into the White House when\r\nthey saw him, no matter what any politician said, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve it would be found--when the book by the hundred million people\r\nwas out, that our people feel on the whole that we could not have\r\nanything better in our country for our next President than a man who\r\nwould be a lawyer backwards.\r\n\r\nWhat the platform of personality we want our next President to have\r\namounts to, is this--Know everything a lawyer knows. Have everything a\r\nlawyer has--and just turn it around and use it the other way and be\r\nanother kind of man about it.\r\n\r\nThe fate of America and the fate of the world may be said to be turning\r\nto-day on the degree during the next four years, during the next\r\nPresident's administration, the American people and all groups of the\r\npeople, stop believing weakly what they want to believe and face the\r\nfacts about themselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to be efficient, in order to be free or even to have enough to\r\neat, millions of American men and women of all groups and classes of the\r\npeople have got to be capable and show that they are capable of changing\r\ntheir minds about themselves.\r\n\r\nEverything we are hoping to do turns upon our recognizing as a people,\r\nstanding out from the rest and pushing forward to lead us, men who know\r\nmore than most of us know, men who are practiced in keeping their own\r\nminds open and can therefore open ours.\r\n\r\nInstead of having for the next President of this country a man who braces\r\npeople, who tightens people up in their convictions, or who drives the\r\nold beliefs they want to believe further down into them and makes them\r\nbelieve them harder, we are going to put in our demand for a President\r\nwho is the engineer of the will of the people, who draws people out, who\r\nhas the common sense, the reality, the sense of humor and the humanness\r\nto look facts and folks in the eyes, who keeps people on all sides who\r\nhave dealings with him from being fooled about themselves, a man who\r\nmakes people real when they are with him, who makes them when they even\r\nthink of him, real with themselves and real with one another, and real in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nI mean by a man's being real in politics, being a politician backwards,\r\nkeeping open to facts acting and preferring to act as children and strong\r\nmen act, with the deepness and directness of the child.\r\n\r\nThe hundred million people in the book they would write if they had time,\r\nput in their demand for a big simple fellow human being in the White\r\nHouse, a man anybody can understand, a man who does things with people\r\nand gets things out of people because he makes people feel they know him.\r\n\r\nThe political parties cannot help themselves the moment the people speak.\r\nThey would rather slide in a man who does not see through them if they\r\ncould, perhaps, but the great political party that sees first and sees\r\nbest, that only a man who sees through it and who will go into the White\r\nHouse to keep on seeing through it, can be elected, will sweep this\r\ncountry as clean as a whistle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S RELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always given homage as probably to the best men of their time, to\r\nthe old monks of the Middle Ages, who climbed up on mountain tops and\r\nlived in monasteries alone with God. If I felt just as they felt about\r\nbeing superlatively religious and wanted to pick out and proceed to live\r\nthe most deeply, intricately religious life I could think of I would\r\nrefuse to look like a saint and be President of the American Board of\r\nCommissioners for Foreign Missions, and would pick out the most difficult\r\nbusiness with the most difficult class of men to compete with in the\r\nUnited States. Then I would go into it, put all my money and all my\r\nreligion together into it.\r\n\r\nThe principles and standards that actually obtain in competition\r\nconstitute in any nation the core of the religion of the people. One\r\nmight say cooeperation of course, but what makes cooeperation powerful and\r\nwhat selects the people who shall lead cooeperation--what gives it\r\ncharacter, dignity and power, is the thing in each man which inspires him\r\nto find a way to do or not to do certain things--when he competes.\r\n\r\nCompetition--the way a man threads his way through the men who compete\r\nwith him--would constitute the highest, purest test of a man's sense of\r\nspiritual values--the real monastery of modern life.\r\n\r\nAll any man can do, all society can do with some people is either to\r\nrefuse to compete with them, ostracize them, socially and industrially,\r\nor clap them into jail.\r\n\r\nThere always must be these people who cannot stand in line in a queue and\r\nbe fair. The Government, the police and the draft have to deal with them.\r\nAs for the rest of us, competition--fair, manly, sporting competition,\r\nkeeps us straight, gives us the manlier and nobler virtue, the knowledge\r\nof ourselves and others that make cooeperation a noble as well as\r\npractical course of procedure.\r\n\r\nThe way a man runs a church or any disinterested enterprise is not to be\r\ncompared as a test of the man's real spiritual or religious value to the\r\nstate--to the way he runs an interested enterprise or business.\r\n\r\nIf I were the rich young man in the New Testament I would not have sold\r\nall my goods to feed the poor--as that particular person (being what he\r\nwas) was advised to. I would hold on to my money--and found a religious\r\norder with it. I would make a whip of cords of my money and my brains\r\nwoven together and would drive out the peddlers, the economic fiddlers,\r\nthe moral and business idiots out of the Temple. I would do it not by\r\nbeing a pure, sterilized, holy-looking person, but by having more\r\nimagination in business, by using higher levels and higher voltage of\r\nhuman motive power in business than they can use, by having more brains\r\nabout human nature than they have, and by my power to get the public to\r\nbe religious, _i.e._, my power as a sheer matter of business, to make the\r\npublic prefer, as a matter of course, my way of competing in business\r\nuntil it drives out and makes absent-minded, mooning, feeble and\r\nshortsighted, theirs.\r\n\r\nThis is not the kind of thing that I happen to have the natural technique\r\nor gift to do--to found a live deep natural religious order like this,\r\nbut there are thousands of men I know and that other men know in America,\r\nwho have the natural typical American technique for putting their higher\r\ngifts to work in business and who are crowding to the wall men who can\r\nonly use their lower ones, and the power, the opportunities that go with\r\nthese men are daily being outlined by events and daily being sketched out\r\nbefore our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe way to be a prophet and to interpret and establish in a nation is to\r\nlead in the business world to-day in establishing principles of\r\ncompetition, which exalt and interpret human nature, free the common\r\nsense, the will, the glory and the religion of the people.\r\n\r\nThe way to be a President, the next four years, is to use the White House\r\nand all the resources of the Government to cooeperate with and back up\r\nthis type of American business man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE RED FLAG AND THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first qualification the next President should run for the Presidency\r\non is his vision or program for the nation with regard to backing up men\r\nin American life--democracy and the Red Flag.\r\n\r\nThe first thing a President should see about the Red Flag is that the Red\r\nFlag is up to the people and not up to the White House--up to the people\r\nin five hundred thousand factories and offices and stores, up to the\r\npeople on both sides of a hundred thousand counters, up to everybody who\r\nbuys a paper of pins or a pound of cheese while they are buying it, up to\r\neverybody who buys a house or a watch or a cake of soap, a safety razor\r\nor a railroad, up to everybody while he is producing, while he is buying\r\nand selling, up to everybody individually and collectively to see that in\r\nevery ten cents they spend in this country and every ten minutes they\r\nwork in this country, the Red Flag--the civil war flag, is stamped on.\r\n\r\nOnly the people can head off the Red Flag--all of the people working on\r\nit on their daily job all of the time.\r\n\r\nThe more our President believes that the work of dealing with the Red\r\nFlag in this country is up to the people the more he gets the people to\r\nbelieve it, puts the work off on the people, the better the work will be\r\ndone, the further the Red Flag will be from getting hold of the country\r\nand the longer the President will be in the White House.\r\n\r\nWe call our President our Chief Executive. What we put him in the White\r\nHouse and make him our chief executive for is that he shall have\r\nimagination about a hundred million people besides himself, that he shall\r\nhave imagination about what the people can do and imagination about\r\ngetting them to do it.\r\n\r\nAn executive is a man whose work is making other people work.\r\n\r\nWe call the place in which we have our President live the Executive\r\nMansion. The best man to elect to live in it is the man who can make a\r\nhundred million people work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Ghost in the White House, by Gerald Stanley Lee",
