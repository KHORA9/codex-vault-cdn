Branch) went into the law office of\r\nMr. Seely, in Fulton street, who, being absent, I awaited his\r\nreturn. He had an interesting boy to open his office and run\r\nerrands. I asked him if he was a native of the city, and he said\r\nyes, and told me that his father and mother were dead, and that\r\nhis grandmother had recently died, and that his only surviving\r\nrelative was an aunt, who was an actress, and travelling over\r\nthe country, and that she seldom visited the city, which made\r\nhim feel very lonely and unhappy. I asked him if he would like\r\nto have me teach him gratuitously, and he said he would—that he\r\nwas at school in Connecticut before his grandmother died, and was\r\nobliged to close his studies in consequence of her death—and\r\nthat he would have travelled with his aunt, after his grandmother\r\ndied, if she had not made him promise on her bed of death, that\r\nhe would never become an actor. I saw genius in the youth, and\r\nstrongly sympathised with his loneliness and misfortunes, and\r\nsoon began to teach him during his leisure hours. His aunt was\r\nlong absent, and sent him no money, and the lady with whom he\r\nboarded got uneasy, and I took him to board with me, at Mrs.\r\nMitchell’s, in Broadway, with whom Otto Dressel, the Reverend\r\nDoctor George Potts’ music teacher, subsequently boarded in\r\nBond, and at the corner of Houston and McDougal streets. While\r\nwe boarded with Mrs. Mitchell, an English boy came there, and\r\nformed his acquaintance, who had recently come to America with\r\na German traveller. They were about the same age, and congenial\r\nfrom mutual loneliness, and they immediately formed a devoted\r\nfriendship. I taught them, both in English and Latin, and I\r\ndearly loved them. I did all I could to please them, and improve\r\ntheir minds, and I took them to Flushing, and Newark, and Albany,\r\nfor pastime. The English boy left the city with the German\r\ntraveller, and was absent several months. I got the American\r\nboy situations in lawyers’ offices and dry goods stores, where\r\nhe seldom stayed long, and he became a great tax on my limited\r\nmeans, but I clung to him in my darkest hours. He told me that he\r\ndesired to dine at the Astor House, with the son of a lawyer,\r\nin whose employ he had been. I rather doubted his story, but let\r\nhim go. Soon afterwards, he requested me to let him go again,\r\nand I did so, going myself, soon after he left me, and took a\r\nposition near the door, after the gong had summoned the boarders\r\nto dinner. On emerging from the dining room after dinner, I asked\r\nhim where the son of the lawyer was. He said that he was in the\r\ndining hall. I told him that I would like an introduction to him.\r\nHis cheeks were naturally as red as a rose, but my unexpected\r\npresence, and request for an introduction to the lawyer’s son,\r\nmade his face as pale as a ghost’s, and I saw that he had stolen\r\nhis dinner, which he slowly acknowledged, and admitted that he\r\nhad dined twice at the Astor without an intention to pay for his\r\ndinners, and that he knew no son of a lawyer residing at the\r\nAstor House. I violently upbraided him, and told him that he\r\nwould ultimately become the tenant of a prison, and perhaps die\r\non the scaffold, if he did not check his thievish propensities.\r\nHe said that I observed small things, which so provoked me,\r\nthat I told him I must abandon him,—that he was in the bud and\r\nblossom of the precarious Spring, and easily blighted for ever by\r\na frost or tempest,—that even the mighty oak, that has defied\r\nthe storms of centuries, is felled to the earth by a blast of\r\nlightning,—and that the towering avalanche, which is formed from\r\nsilent and solitary flakes of snow, could bury the largest city\r\nof the globe. He evinced great sorrow, and cried bitterly, and\r\nassured me that he would never steal another meal. I then paid\r\nfor both dinners, and left the Astor, and kept a close guard\r\nover his movements. In about three weeks, he was arrested for an\r\nattempt to rifle a man’s pocket in Wall street. The gentleman\r\ndid not appear against him, and he was discharged. I then went\r\nto an actor to ascertain in what part of the country his aunt\r\nwas, and immediately wrote to her, and she came to the city, and\r\nI surrendered the thievish boy to her future protection. She got\r\nhim a boarding place, and left the city to fulfil her theatrical\r\nengagement. He urged me afterwards to give him a recommendation\r\nto the extensive wholesale dry goods firm of Fearing & Hall, in\r\nExchange Place. I told him that I would do them great injustice,\r\nas he might steal, and then they would hold me responsible. But\r\nhe said his aunt had not sent him money for a long time, and\r\nthat he had nowhere to live, and wept aloud, in Chatham street,\r\nand so wrought upon my feelings, that I consented to recommend\r\nhim. During my interview with Mr. Fearing, (who was the senior\r\npartner of the firm,) he said that out of one hundred responses\r\nto his advertisement for a clerk, he had chosen my young friend,\r\nbecause he was pleased with his appearance and address, and that\r\nhe was the only boy out of the one hundred who had removed his\r\nhat on entering his counting room. I had a year previous told\r\nthe boy to always remove his hat when he entered the presence of\r\na lady or gentleman, and this was the propitious fruit of his\r\nrecollection and exercise of the politeness I had imparted. Mr.\r\nFearing also said that although he could get the boys of affluent\r\nparents for nothing, (who deemed the knowledge of business they\r\nwould acquire as a compensation for their services,) yet he was\r\nso pleased with my young friend, that he would give sufficient\r\nmeans to support him, if he proved industrious, and displayed\r\nthe talents he thought he discovered in him. I left, and the boy\r\nwent on the following day as a clerk of this extensive firm, who\r\nsoon informed me that their anticipations were realised as to the\r\ncapacity of the boy,—that he was as quick as a flash, in all\r\nhis movements, and was more valuable to them than any boy they\r\never had. Mr. Fearing made him presents of apparel, and paid his\r\nboard, and gave him pocket money, and treated him like his own\r\nson. He soon got into the habit of attending balls, and places\r\nof amusement. Money was missed, and although traced to him, yet\r\nMr. Fearing kindly forgave him. More soon disappeared, and was\r\nfastened upon him, and he was discharged, amid the tears of Mr.\r\nFearing, who fondly loved him. He alternately boarded in Fulton\r\nand John streets, and borrowed an elegant pair of tight dancing\r\npantaloons of a fellow boarder and companion, named Robert M.\r\nStrebeigh, who is now the first book-keeper, and one of the\r\nproprietors of the _New York Tribune_, and a near relative of\r\nMr. McElrath. He wore the pants to a ball, and stained them,\r\nand burst them, and never returned them, which sorely troubled\r\npoor Strebeigh for a long time, and I often have a laugh with\r\nStrebeigh at this remote day about those pants, but he can never\r\nsmile when I allude to the loss of his fancy ball pantaloons.\r\nSome months later, he was arrested for stealing clothing, and had\r\nan accomplice, who escaped. He was arrested at the Battery, while\r\ngetting into an omnibus, and strove to bribe the officer with\r\nmoney. I went to the Tombs to see him, and wrote to his aunt, who\r\ncame to the city. She was (and is) an actress of uncommon talent,\r\nand enacted the leading characters of Shakespeare. I had often\r\nseen her elicit tears from a vast assemblage, with her affected\r\npathos. But now I beheld her unaffected sorrow, and heard her\r\npiercing cries for the deliverance of her nephew from his dreary\r\nand degraded confinement. And her strong, clear, and musical\r\nvoice, and large, dark, penetrating eyes, and uplifted arms,\r\nand dishevelled hair, and rapid pace too and fro, and furious\r\ngesticulation, and frenzied glances, harrowed my feelings beyond\r\nendurance, and I had to shield myself as far as possible from her\r\npitiful and overwhelming presence. I went to the Tombs, and saw\r\nthe boy, and told him his aunt had arrived, and he desired to\r\nsee her. I returned and told her his request, and she exclaimed:\r\n“I know he wants to see his beloved aunt—the dear, dear boy,\r\nwith no father, nor mother, and his kind old grandmother also\r\ndead—I know he yearns to see his only surviving relative—the\r\ndear, darling, unfortunate boy, and I will go to see him, and\r\nkiss him, and comfort him in his dreary dungeon, and die with\r\nhim, in his captivity, if necessary,” and thus she soliloquised\r\nand wept in tones of strangulation, while arranging her shawl\r\nand bonnet before the glass, and I cried also, and besought her\r\nnot to go, as I did not desire to witness the harrowing prison\r\nscene between herself and beloved nephew. But she assured me\r\nthat she would control her feelings, and would not weep, nor\r\nevince extraordinary emotion in his cell, if I would accompany\r\nher. I doubted her power of dissimulation, when she beheld her\r\nnephew, in his narrow cell, with a stone and block for his\r\nbed and pillow, and restrained of his liberty by locks, bars,\r\nbolts, and chains. But she most earnestly assured me that she\r\ncould master her sympathies, and appealed to her control of her\r\npassions on the stage, as evidence of her ability to subdue her\r\nfeelings in a prison. She did not convince, but smiled like\r\nan angel through her tears, and persuaded me to go in accents\r\nthat would have conquered and melted a fiend into submission.\r\nOn our arrival at the Tombs, her eyes were excited with fear,\r\nand as we ascended the steps that led to the cell, she trembled\r\nlike a little girl, and hoped I would pardon her tremulation,\r\nas it was her first appearance in a real prison, and trusted it\r\nwould be the last. I tranquilized her fears, and we enter his\r\ncell, and when she beholds his pale and sad and lovely face, she\r\nscreams, and embraces, and hugs, and kisses him, until it seems\r\nshe will strangle and devour him. After the shock, she slowly\r\nrecovers herself, and adheres, as far as possible, to her pledge\r\nto check her agony, until we arise to leave him, when I behold\r\na scene between herself and nephew, far more affecting than I\r\never witnessed on the stage of a theatre, or in human life.\r\nShe raved and pulled her hair, and pressed him to her panting\r\nbosom, as though she was bidding him an eternal farewell, prior\r\nto his immediate departure for the scaffold. The boy becomes\r\nalarmed, as she had almost suffocated him with affection, and in\r\nhis herculean efforts to extricate his neck from her terrible\r\nBearish embraces, they both fell violently on the floor of the\r\ncell, when I implored her to release her grasp, lest she would\r\nstrangle him. But she was in a trance of affection, and was\r\nutterly unconscious, and the boy soon cries for instant succor,\r\nor he must die, when I seize her with all the strength I could\r\nsummon, and after a severe struggle (in which I tear the apparel\r\nof both, and scratch their faces,) I separate them, and in\r\nhalf an hour, through the most tender persuasion, I effect her\r\nemergence from the cell, amid an avalanche of renewed embraces,\r\nand mutual kisses, and parting words. On leaving the cell, a\r\ncaptive (who had the freedom of the prison, and whose heart was\r\nmoved by the noise in the cell, and the touching presence of\r\nthe lady,) beckoned me aside, and told me that a friend of his\r\ngot out of prison the day before for thirty dollars, and that\r\nhe expected to obtain his liberty the following day for twenty\r\ndollars, which was all the money he could raise. I asked him how\r\nit could be done. He said that Abraham D. Russell was the lawyer\r\nof himself and friend, and got a great many guilty persons out\r\nof prison for a small sum of money, and that if I would consult\r\nhim, he could easily get my young friend out in a day or two. I\r\nthanked him kindly, and left the prison with the boy’s aunt, and\r\nto restrain her tears, I immediately imparted to her the pleasing\r\nnews I had heard. She was almost frantic with joy, and said that\r\nalthough she had not much money in consequence of the great\r\nexpense attending her suit, then pending for divorce, against her\r\nbrutal husband, yet she would pawn her jewelry and theatrical\r\nwardrobe, if necessary, to release her nephew from his dreadful\r\nincarceration. I told her the prisoner said that it would cost\r\nonly thirty dollars, which she promised to raise as soon as she\r\ncould send the servant to the pawnbrokers. I escorted her to the\r\nboarding house, and left her to procure the money, while I went\r\nto Mr. Russell’s office, to ascertain if the prisoner told the\r\ntruth. Mr. Russell was absent, but his boy, Theodore Stuyvesant,\r\n(recently a member of the New York Legislature,) said he would\r\nsoon return, and in about ten minutes he came into the office.\r\nI briefly stated the case, and he said that for thirty dollars\r\nin advance, he would have the boy restored to liberty. I ran to\r\nthe boy’s aunt, and told her the precious news, and she let me\r\nhave thirty dollars, which she borrowed from the stage manager\r\nof a theatre in this city, and thus saved the wounded heart and\r\ncruel sacrifice that are the sure result of forced dealings with\r\npawnbrokers. I hastened to Mr. Russell’s office, and cheerfully\r\ngave him the thirty dollars, and went to the prison and told the\r\nboy what I had done, who was wild with delight. On the following\r\nmorning, I went early to the Court of Sessions, and a gang of\r\nthieves made their appearance, and were huddled like sheep in\r\na corner of the Court Room. I had firmly refused the request\r\nof the boy’s aunt to be present, and if I had not, I think she\r\nwould never have survived the awful scene. To behold a youth\r\nso beautiful and classical, amid a group of ugly burglars of\r\nall hues, and of either sex, was a spectacle that painfully\r\ndisgusted me, and made me almost sick of life, but I disguised\r\nmy feelings as far as I could, and rivetted my eyes on the boy\r\nand the officer who called the prisoners for trial and sentence,\r\nwhich were nearly simultaneous. The boy’s name was near the close\r\nof the list, and was not called that day, and he was remanded\r\nto his cell. Throughout the painful scene, I was writhing with\r\nsuppressed anger, at the absence of Mr. Russell, and after the\r\nboy was remanded to prison, I rushed to Russell’s office in\r\nterrible anger. I demanded why he had abandoned the boy after\r\nreceiving thirty dollars, and that if three more prisoners had\r\nbeen called to appear in front of the Judge for trial, my young\r\nfriend’s name would have been reached on the list of culprits,\r\nand he doubtless would have been condemned and sentenced to the\r\nStates Prison for the want, perhaps, of a lawyer to defend him.\r\nRussell said that he was busy, and could not be in the Court of\r\nSessions to defend him; but that he would certainly be there on\r\nthe following day, and save him. As he had got the thirty dollars\r\nin his relentless grasp, I deemed it expedient to restrain my\r\nanger, and try his integrity once more. The morning came, and\r\nthe thieves were again driven like cattle into the Court Room,\r\nand I soon discovered the bright eyes and noble features of my\r\nyoung friend among the hideous and wretched criminals. But Mr.\r\nRussell was not there, and I inquired for him, and a young\r\nlawyer told me that he was in the ante-room, whither I literally\r\nflew, and asked him why he did not come into the Court Room, and\r\nhe prepared to defend the boy, as the Judge was in his seat, and\r\nthe prisoners were about to be called and tried. He told me not\r\nto be in such a flurry, and that he should come when he pleased,\r\nand not before, which so exasperated me, that I cried out: “Then\r\ngive me the thirty dollars I gave you to effect his liberty.”\r\nHe stared at me with his bad and revengeful eyes, like an owl\r\nin a midnight tempest, but he breathed not a syllable. Several\r\npersons heard my voice in the Court Room, and came into the\r\nante-room. I then exclaimed: “You black looking rascal, restore\r\nthe thirty dollars instantly, or I will tear you to pieces.” This\r\nterrified him, and he gently took my arm, and besought me, in\r\nGod’s name, to be silent, and not expose him, and most solemnly\r\ndeclared that he would go immediately into the Court Room, and\r\nhave the boy’s trial postponed, and that he would get his sacred\r\nfriend, Frederick A. Tallmadge, the Recorder, to permit him to\r\nbe discharged on bail in a few days. This pacified me, and he\r\nwent into the Court Room, where I watched his movements as a cat\r\ndoes a rat, and presently he caught the eye of the Judge, and\r\nsmiles and winks were simultaneously exchanged, and the boy’s\r\ntrial was postponed, and he was again conducted to his gloomy\r\ncell. On the second day following, Mr. Russell, myself, the boy’s\r\naunt, and a well clad, and very genteel one-arm man, went to the\r\noffice of Frederick A. Tallmadge, the Recorder, and the Straw\r\nBail Court was opened, in whose infamous proceedings I enacted\r\nas vile a part as Russell or Tallmadge, or the neatly attired,\r\nand otto-perfumed, and sleek haired one-arm man, who was engaged\r\nby Russell to be the spurious bail, although my motives were on\r\nthe side of humanity, and theirs on the side of gilded lucre.\r\nThe Recorder said: “Well, Mr. Russell, please state your case,”\r\nand Russell said: “A lad is confined in the Tombs on a charge of\r\nstealing clothing. That he is guilty of theft is not yet proved,\r\nas he has not had his trial. But his aunt and friends are here\r\nin deep affliction, in whose name I most devoutly pray that\r\nyour honor will release the boy on bail, with a solemn pledge\r\nfrom his aunt and friends that he will immediately be sent to\r\nsea.” A few winks, and blinks, and intelligent smiles, graced\r\nthe eyes, and lips, and cheeks, and temples of several persons\r\npresent, while the Recorder was considering the merits of the\r\ncase, with his perturbed and thoughtful visage buried within his\r\nhands, which he anon removed, and desired the friend of the boy\r\nto come forward, who was prepared to be his bail, and presto!\r\nthe long-haired, and smiling, and smooth-faced, and fragrant,\r\nand well dressed one-arm man, appeared in front of the Recorder,\r\nand with a great display of New York or London assurance, he\r\nsigned the document that restored to liberty one of the shrewdest\r\nlittle rogues of the age. The boy’s aunt thanked Mr. Russell and\r\nthe Recorder, and the one-arm man and myself went through the\r\nsame formality, (I apologising to Russell for my harsh words at\r\nthe Tombs,) and we separated, and the boy’s aunt went home in\r\nan omnibus, and I went to the Tombs, to witness the discharge\r\nof the culprit captive boy. He was released from his cell, and\r\nboth Turnkey and Russell warned me to beware of the Judge, and\r\nwe descended the prison steps, and I shall never forget the\r\nshock we received as we were passing through the prison yard,\r\nat meeting the Sessions Judge, who had just got information of\r\nRussell’s operations, and would doubtless have detained the boy\r\nuntil he got his share of the thirty dollars from Russell. But\r\nthe boy adroitly, and like lightning, turned his head, and the\r\nJudge passed on without recognising or suspecting that the boy\r\nwas already on his way to liberty. We paused a moment at the\r\nprison gate and desk, where the boy’s name was carefully examined\r\non the books, and the boy severely scrutinised, and the clerks\r\nimparted their sly and extremely expressive leers, and the last\r\nprison gate was opened, and the boy was free, and went to his\r\naunt’s boarding house, and rushed into her arms, who swooned,\r\nand fell like a corpse to the floor, and was with difficulty\r\nrestored to consciousness. Like the pure and noble Socrates, I\r\nalways conceived it a monstrous crime to illegally effect the\r\nliberation of captives, and I repeat, that in all this violation\r\nof law, and stupendous villainy, I knew that I was enacting as\r\nvile a part as Russell and Tallmadge, and the One-Arm Straw Bail\r\nScamp, but it has always been a pleasing solace to know that\r\nsympathy, and not money, led me to embark in a plot to effect\r\nthe liberation of a notorious little convict. Lawyer Russell\r\nand Recorder Tallmadge subsequently became (and are now) the\r\nCity Judge and Superintendent of Police of the great commercial\r\nmetropolis of the Western World, and the one-arm man I recently\r\nsaw in Broadway, and on the steps of the Tombs, as glossy as\r\never with sweet oil and broadcloth, and who always reminded me\r\nof that class of conspirators under the monster Cataline, whom\r\nCicero describes as past all hope of a restoration to private or\r\npublic virtue. I subsequently learned that the one-arm man was a\r\npenniless and cunning and thievish vagabond, and had subsisted\r\nfor years from what he got from straw bail lawyers, for being\r\nbail to prisoners. I do not positively know that the Recorder\r\nknew he was utterly irresponsible, and even if he did, he may\r\nhave accepted him as bail, from motives of the purest humanity,\r\nalthough, in doing so, he must have known that he was violating\r\nand degrading his position as a leading City Magistrate, and\r\nthat he was treacherous and ungrateful to the people who kindly\r\nelected him to protect their lives and property from the thieves\r\nand murderers of the metropolis. But we are of the opinion that\r\nRussell powerfully aided Tallmadge in his election as Recorder,\r\nand that there was collusion between them, and that they both\r\nknew what a miserable scamp and outcast the straw bail one-arm\r\nman was and is to this day. It now devolved on me to send the\r\nboy to sea, and the aunt signified her readiness to aid me, and\r\nto procure his sea clothes, and the boy was willing to go, and\r\nI went on board of several vessels, and at last obtained him a\r\nsituation as cabin boy, but his health was very delicate, and\r\nI feared he would die, and I could not let him go to sea. I\r\nthen proposed that he should visit the village in Connecticut,\r\nwhere he went to school before his grandmother died, in order\r\nto recruit his health, and his aunt gave him some money, and\r\nhe left for the country, to return in the autumn, and obtain a\r\nsituation in some respectable pursuit. His aunt left the city,\r\nto join her theatrical company, and I continued in my business\r\nas teacher of colored and Irish and other servants. I soon\r\nreceived a letter from the boy, informing me that he was in a\r\nvery melancholy mood—that his old school mates had all left the\r\nvillage, and the people with whom he formerly boarded had learned\r\nof his thefts through the newspapers, and he desired to return to\r\nthe city. I wrote immediately, and directed him to come to the\r\ncity, and I would strive to get him a place to learn a trade,\r\nand did so, but he soon left, and got into vicious society, and\r\nI had to let him pursue his own course, as I was very poor and\r\nill, and he had nearly worn me to the grave. The next I heard of\r\nhim, was that he had been arrested in Philadelphia, and taken to\r\nBoston, where he had committed forgery, in connection with an\r\nold convict. He wrote me several letters from the Boston jail,\r\nwhich I could scarcely read, in consequence of their melancholy\r\ncharacter. I wrote to his aunt in vain, as she either did not\r\nreceive my letters, or, if she did, concluded to leave him to his\r\nawful fate. He turned State’s evidence, and thus got his term\r\nof punishment reduced from five to three years. I visited him\r\nat the prison in Charlestown, and I was the only person of his\r\nacquaintance, who went to see him during his long imprisonment.\r\nI also, by his request, sent him the New York _Evangelist_ and\r\n_Observer_, and other New York papers. The kind Superintendent\r\nof the Prison often wrote me, that the boy was popular with the\r\nofficers of the Prison, and also with the prisoners in the Sunday\r\nschool, and prayer meetings, and in the debating Society of the\r\ncaptives, and was a leader in all the religious and musical and\r\nliterary exercises of the prison. His time expired, and he came\r\nto New York, and immediately flew to me. I gave him money, and\r\nhe soon ascertained in what part of the country his aunt was\r\nengaged in her profession of theatricals, and he soon found her,\r\nand became an actor, although he had promised his Grandmother on\r\nher dying bed that he would never be an actor. He subsequently\r\nperformed in this city, at Burton’s in Chamber street, and\r\nBurton discharged him and leveled a revolver at his head, for a\r\nsuspected intimacy with an actress. He went to Providence, where\r\nwe saw him perform at the Theatre in Westminster street. The New\r\nYork _Police Gazette_ attacked him and exposed his antecedents,\r\nwhose publication he assured me Burton obtained and paid for,\r\nto injure him and drive him from this section of the country,\r\nand I told him he had no right to cast affectionate glances at\r\nBurton’s actress; that Burton was justified in his revenges\r\neven unto death, and I advised him to leave New England and the\r\ncentral States, and he did, and got married, and had children,\r\nand I recently saw his affable and accomplished aunt, who told me\r\nthat her nephew had risen to the summit of his profession, and\r\nthat he was a good husband and father, and that he was rapidly\r\naccumulating a splendid fortune. And now, dear reader, you may\r\nenjoy this exciting and truthful narrative, but I do not. And\r\nI will tell you the reason why. This boy has become a valuable\r\nmember of society, and entertains multitudes of his species,\r\nand excites their mirth and grateful sadness, and arouses their\r\nhatred of dishonor and oppression, and is, like every meritorious\r\nactor, an honor and a benefactor of his race. And hence it is\r\nmost acutely painful to array his past sad career before his\r\nvision and the world. And yet I had to disclose his melancholy\r\nstory, in order to expose the rascality of the officials of\r\nthis Metropolis. And here again I am in sack cloth. For Judge\r\nRussell is the ardent friend of James Gordon Bennett, who has\r\nclung to me in days of illness and penury and gloom, when I\r\noften expected to drop dead in the streets of New York. And\r\nthen again, Wm. Curtis Noyes married the favorite daughter of\r\nSuperintendent Frederick A. Tallmadge, and Mr. Noyes has been\r\nlike a brother to me, and has loaned me money to buy bread and\r\nshoes during my recent pecuniary calamities, when nearly every\r\nbeing on the face of God’s earth refused to loan me a farthing\r\nto save my trembling frame from starvation. I weep (as few ever\r\nwept, over these melancholy lines), to find myself compelled to\r\nhold up to wasteless scorn, the friends and relatives of Wm.\r\nCurtis Noyes and James Gordon Bennett, but I would trample the\r\nbones and ashes of my father in his coffin, if I knew that he\r\ndied with the odium on his forehead, that will pursue Russell and\r\nTallmadge to their graves, and forever degrade their unfortunate\r\nposterity. If murder is never out-lawed, these crimes are still\r\nfresh, and the culprits should be punished. And shall friendship\r\nscreen those public monsters, who render New York a purgatory,\r\nthrough their official protection of thieves and assassins, and\r\nthe whole catalogue of human devils? Nothing but a voice from\r\nHeaven could have saved the head of Benedict Arnold, if George\r\nWashington had got him in his clutches. And shall Russell and\r\nTallmadge and other traitors to justice and the people, be\r\nscreened from the public execration, because I love the humanity\r\nand private succor of their friends and kindred? No, no. In tones\r\nof thunder and earthquakes, and the crash of a trillion worlds,\r\nno, no, no. I now have a Press to expose the public villains, and\r\nI will stab down to ignominious graves, and to hell itself, all\r\nthe plunderers and murderers and accursed traitors of my adored\r\ncountry. And I defy the Universe in arms to paralyze the Will\r\nthat dissects the precocious monsters of this pernicious age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, MAY 29, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEGRADATION.—Mayor Tiemann walked arm in arm with\r\nGeorge W. Matsell, in front of the City Hall, (while the former\r\nreviewed the Eighth Ward Police,) to the disgust of private\r\ncitizens and the policemen themselves. We recently intimated that\r\nPeter Cooper, James W. Gerard, Ambrose C. Kingsland, and Mayor\r\nTiemann were afraid of Matsell’s Black Book. Tiemann’s review\r\nof the Police, leaning on the arm of Matsell, (with Tallmadge\r\n]coldly neglected in the background,) partially corroborates\r\nour assertion with reference to the Mayor. And we believe that\r\nMatsell could make Tiemann take his arm and parade in worse\r\nlocalities than the Park, and could make him kiss his big toe, or\r\nforce him to degrade himself, or distribute his vast patronage\r\nas the alien perjurer, and inhuman abjurer of his native land\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat induced Frank Leslie to attack the Milkmen? To make money\r\nfrom the sale of his nauseous pictures. And thus benificence\r\nflows from mercenary minds. Leslie is a British alien, and cares\r\nfar less about American cows and milk, and poisoned infants,\r\nthan the American dollar. The town is in a perfect uproar about\r\nrat’s bane milk, but all will soon be as placid as a summer sea.\r\nGilded metal will soon heal the human palm of all its ills. We\r\nhave witnessed these milk spasms all our days, and we lived near\r\nthe Sixteenth street depot, many years ago, and nearly died\r\nfrom the poisonous atmosphere. Let fathers and mothers, and\r\ngrandfathers and grandmothers assemble at these murderous depots,\r\nand saturate the guts of the proprietors with their bloody and\r\nscabby milk poison, and then put them in a pillory, and pelt\r\nthem with rotten eggs, and then tie them to a whipping post, and\r\ngive them a thousand lashes, with cow tails, until their hacks\r\nare raw down to their bone and marrow. And we doubt if even this\r\nterrible scourge would drive them from their fatal avocation. For\r\nyears on years our most respectable citizens have petitioned the\r\nCommon Council to destroy these poisonous milk establishments,\r\nbut their proprietors have always united and bought a majority of\r\nthe members of the Common Council to refuse their just and humane\r\npetitions. And where is Ex-Mayor Havemeyer, who has resided\r\nwithin a stone’s throw of the Sixteenth street cow establishment\r\nfor twenty successive years? He, alone, could have released those\r\npoor dumb animals, and have saved the lives of ten thousand\r\ninfants. And we had rather incur the perils of twenty murderers\r\nat the bar of God, than the mysterious and incredible leniency\r\nof Ex-Mayor Havemeyer towards the milk assassins, who have\r\ncommitted their deeds of hell under his very nostrils at the foot\r\nof Sixteenth street during a third of his mortal career. God’s\r\nwrath on him should and will be terrible indeed for his inhuman\r\ndereliction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Mayor Tiemann or Peter Cooper inform us who originated the\r\nWard Island speculation, through which the city has been and will\r\nbe plundered till doomsday? We will bet heavily, that Tiemann and\r\nCooper know more about the Ward Island purchases than they would\r\nlike to disclose. We shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe approach our career as a lover in the next chapter of our\r\n“Life.” We dread this, as it is nearly the only portion of the\r\npast that we review with sadness. But we must commence the\r\npainful task in the next number of the Alligator, which will\r\nelicit many a tear and smile from the curious children of Adam\r\nand Eve, but there will be more tears than smiles from us, as we\r\nrecord, for coming ages, our most extraordinary domestic history.\r\nThe Turks and Mormons and descendants of the amorous patriarchs\r\nwill wildly stare, when they peruse our legal relations with\r\nhuman divinities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was the confidential friend of Joseph S. Taylor? Mayor\r\nTiemann.—Who was forever prowling around the Street\r\nCommissioner’s Office in the days of Jo. Taylor? Mayor\r\nTiemann.—Who boasted that he could always control the vote of\r\nEx-Governor Tiemann? Jo. Taylor. And who always did control the\r\nvote of Ex-Governor Tiemann? Jo. Taylor!—O Moses!\r\n\r\n\r\nA young scamp sends us a threat. His surname begins with K.,\r\nwhich is the initial of “Knell!” Knave! Dost thou understand?\r\n\r\n  Go to thy work,\r\n  With probe and fork,\r\n  And earn thy pork,\r\n  And pay thy debts,\r\n  And cease thy threats,\r\n  And Godless frets.\r\n\r\nCoward! Save your ink and paper and valuable time, and bring your\r\nthreat, and we will spank you, or we are no American.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome complain of the length of our articles, but let all read\r\nthem understandingly, and they will find them short and sweet as\r\n’lasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n  In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n  States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome students met to play a game of cards, when one proposed\r\nto bet some money, which was accepted. This led to universal\r\nbetting. Cauldwell, of Virginia, proposed a heavy bet, which I\r\naccepted and won. Cauldwell then asked me to accompany him to\r\nhis room, where we could play by ourselves, and I went, and we\r\ngambled several nights, including Sunday. We were about even,\r\nand I proposed to play a limited number of games and stop, as I\r\nloathed gambling, and feared it might lead to a gambler’s fate.\r\nMy proposition was accepted, and at the close of the games, he\r\nowed me about eighty dollars, which he paid me the following\r\nday, which closed my gambling at Cambridge. I seldom attended\r\nthe recitations at the Law School of Judge Story and Professor\r\nGreenleaf, but rode fast horses with the Southern students, and\r\naccompanied them to the opera of Mr. and Mrs. Wood, in Boston,\r\nand other places of amusement and dissipation. My sojourn at\r\nCambridge cost my father a large sum, for which I acquired\r\nnothing. And, disgusted with myself and lamenting my ingratitude\r\nto my father, I proposed to leave Cambridge, and return to\r\nAndover, to which, to my surprise, my father readily acceded.\r\nI engaged excellent board and parlor, and hired a horse daily\r\nfor exercise, and employed three private teachers in English,\r\nGreek, and Latin, and I studied fifteen hours a day for six\r\nmonths, and acquired a more critical knowledge of principles\r\nthan I had obtained in all my life. I gave my English teacher two\r\ndollars an hour, who devoted four hours a day in recitation and\r\nexplanation. I gave my Greek and Latin teachers two dollars an\r\nhour, who each taught me two hours a day. I permitted no one to\r\nvisit me, save my teachers, and my only recreation was a ride,\r\non horseback every day. Large as my bills were, my noble father\r\npaid them without a murmur. The only serious mistake I made\r\nduring my residence at Andover, was a journey to Washington, by\r\ninvitation of Nathaniel P. Causin, Jr., who, during his visit\r\nto Providence, while I was in the Post Office, was introduced\r\nto me by Tristam Burges, Jr. I thought young Tristam neglected\r\nCausin, and I introduced him to the students and pretty girls of\r\nProvidence, for which he often expressed the warmest gratitude in\r\nletters from Washington, and I at length favorably responded to\r\nhis frequent importunities to visit him. So fond was Causin of\r\nme, that while I was in the Law School at Cambridge, he desired\r\nto join me in my class, and room with me, and actually packed\r\nhis trunks at Washington for his departure to Cambridge, but\r\nI advised him to go to the New Haven Law School, as I did not\r\ndare have him come to Cambridge while I had the itch, lest he\r\nmight catch it, through our constant intimacy. I left Andover\r\nwith one hundred dollars, and was warmly received by Causin on\r\nmy arrival in Washington. He accompanied me to the President’s,\r\nto either House of Congress, to the Executive Departments, and\r\nto Mount Vernon, where we fertilized the tomb of Washington with\r\nour tears. And he now proposes a dinner in honor of me, to which\r\nthe distinguished ladies and gentlemen of Washington are to be\r\ninvited, which made me nervous, and I send a note affecting\r\nsudden illness, when Causin comes and implores me to accompany\r\nhim in a carriage to his father’s. I feared to go as the lion\r\nof such a gay and polished throng, as doubtless would be there,\r\nbut I yield to his irresistible persuasion, and assure him\r\nthat I will come in the evening. Causin departs, and I repair\r\nto the abode of a Virginian in Washington, who was a famous\r\nlinguist at Cambridge, and inform him that I am invited to an\r\nintellectual festival, at which would be the genius and beauty\r\nof Washington, and that as it was a compliment to me, I trembled\r\nlest I should be forced to give a toast or make a speech, or be\r\npropounded questions which I could not answer with fluency and\r\naccuracy. My friend sympathises, and consents to go, and talk\r\nto them, if necessary, in six languages, and give them toasts,\r\nand speeches, and answer all the questions they could ask in\r\nthe whole range of the sciences, and freely partake of all the\r\nliquids and solids they could place before him. And he directs me\r\nto be sure and sit close beside him, and when I get cornered, to\r\npinch him, and he will monopolise the conversation, and keep up\r\nsuch a loud and everlasting chatter, that I can have no possible\r\nchance to respond to the questions of the guests. Young Causin’s\r\nfather was the physician of Henry Clay, and other Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, and when I enter the parlor and behold Clay\r\nhimself towering above the assembled intelligence and dazzling\r\nmagnificence of our National Capital, I thought I should fall,\r\nand leaned firmly on the arm of my accomplished companion for\r\nsupport. With Causin as our faithful guide, we passed around,\r\nand bowed to the intellectual guests, and their lovely wives\r\nand daughters, who gleamed with jewels, and formed a brilliant\r\nconstellation. My Virginia friend was perfectly at home, and\r\nshook the hand of Clay with as much nonchalence as if he had been\r\nhis own father, and saluted the wives and virgin coquettes like\r\nhis own mother and sisters; and one glorious and irresistible\r\ncreature, I thought he would kiss and conquer on the spot, so\r\ninterminably did their tongues revel in French, Spanish, and\r\nItalian. But I was giddy, and asked Causin for water, and through\r\nthis happy pretext, emerge from the gorgeous display. My friend\r\ndesires to linger, but I twitch and coax him to leave with myself\r\nand Causin, as I fear he might seat himself at the approaching\r\ndinner beside some black-eyed maiden, and thus place me in the\r\ndilemma I had sought to avoid by inviting him to the festival.\r\nWe descend the stairs, and drink wine, and smoke segars until\r\nthe gong summons us to the banquet. Causin clings to me, and I\r\nto the Virginian, and we seat ourselves in the centre of the\r\ntable with myself between Causin and my guest. The covers are\r\nremoved, and the posterity of about all the ducks, and hens, and\r\nroosters, and flocks, and herds, that were preserved in the Ark\r\nare in the arms of death before us, for their last grind and\r\nannihilation. But as I was a professed invalid, I dared not eat,\r\nalthough my stomach craved the ducks and venison most acutely.\r\nAfter the poor animals were hacked and devoured, the pastry,\r\njellies, cream, and fruits appear in such profusion, that it\r\nseemed as though Java, Madeira, the tropics, Indies, and all\r\nof the Mediterranean isles had been pillaged and desolated to\r\nappease our palates, and corks flew like rockets, and rivalled\r\nthe reverberations of rifles in a siege. I drank some wine, but\r\nwas extremely cautious, and more than once besought Causin to let\r\nme retire, but he peremptorily refused. And now the majestic form\r\nof Clay arises, who addresses the ladies in a strain of fervor\r\nand exhilaration that fascinated every heart. He then addressed\r\nthe gentlemen, and when about to close, rests his searching eyes\r\non me. I begin to tremble, and when he articulates my name as\r\nthe distinguished guest of the occasion, I can scarcely breathe,\r\nand unconsciously take a glass of brandy (for water) which was\r\ndesigned for my Virginia friend, and which nearly choked me, and\r\nplunged me in deeper misery. The great Kentuckian closed with\r\na glowing eulogium on Rhode Island, and her manufactures, and\r\nwarriors, and statesmen, and lingered on the genius, and valor,\r\nand eloquence, and patriotism of Greene and Perry, and Tristam\r\nBurges. All eyes are now upon me, and I pinch the Virginian\r\nin vain, and fear paralysis, unless he instantly relieves me.\r\nSo, having a gold toothpick in my hand, I plunge it into his\r\nleg as far as it would go, and up he sprang as though suddenly\r\ngalvanised, and breathed a strain of eloquence worthy of the\r\nbest days of old Virginia. He extenuated my non-response to the\r\npleasing remarks of the distinguished Kentuckian, on the ground\r\nof indisposition, and, after happy allusions to the patriotism\r\nof Rhode Island, Virginia, and Kentucky, in the darkest period\r\nof American history, he rivetted his piercing eyes on the\r\nmagnificent array of female loveliness, and entranced the sweet\r\nangels with language as luxuriant as Antony’s to Cleopatra, in\r\nthe high antiquity of Roman and Egyptian splendor. The matrons\r\nsmiled and the virgins clapped their tiny and lily fingers, and\r\nthe gentlemen struck the table, and stamped their feet, and rose,\r\nand ejaculated bravo! Senators, and Representatives, and scholars\r\nspoke in strains of powerful eloquence, and elicited enthusiastic\r\npraise. All now arise, and repair to the parlors, where vocal and\r\ninstrumental music, and dancing, and waltzing, and intellectual\r\ncommunion of the most solid and brilliant minds of our country,\r\nclose the pleasing exercises of the memorable occasion. The\r\nVirginian departs for his abode near the President’s, and Causin\r\nand myself go to Gadsby’s. While strolling on Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, on the following evening, Causin said: “Branch, in yonder\r\nmarble edifice is a band of gamblers, where many a promising\r\nyouth and meritorious gentleman have been ruined for ever.” I\r\naccompany Causin to his residence, and listen to the delightful\r\nmusic of his sister, and invite him to dine with me on the\r\nfollowing day, and leave for Gadsby’s, and halt at the portal of\r\nthe gambler’s den, and thus soliloquise: “My expenses have been\r\nmore than I anticipated, and I have hardly sufficient funds to\r\npay my bills, and reach Cambridge, and a week must elapse ere I\r\ncan obtain money from my father. I have always been fortunate in\r\nthe half a dozen times I have gambled, and I will try my luck\r\nonce more, and for the last time,” and I enter the gamester’s\r\nhell, and drink some delicious wine, and eat some turkey and\r\npickled oysters, and advance to the gaming table, and in one hour\r\nI am penniless. I return to Gadsby’s, and retire, but cannot\r\nsleep, rolling from side to to side like a ship in a howling\r\ntempest. Causin and his cousin dine with me, and after dinner,\r\nwe stroll in the beautiful paths around the noble Capitol, and\r\nvisit some lovely girls in the evening, whom Causin had known\r\nfrom childhood, and we separated at nearly midnight. I then go to\r\nthe gamester, and beseech him to restore a portion of the money I\r\nhad lost, to convey me to my distant home, which he refuses with\r\nthe glances of a demon. I then go to a Member of Congress from\r\nRhode Island, who was a friend of my father, and ask him to loan\r\nme sufficient to pay my bills and defray my expenses to Andover,\r\nwhich he readily vouchsafes. On the following morning, I go to\r\nCausin’s, and bid himself and father and mother and sister a warm\r\nadieu, and depart for Andover by way of Hartford and Worcester.\r\nI knew the son of the Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum\r\nat Worcester while he was a student at Brown University, in\r\nProvidence, and am anxious to see him, and leave my hotel about\r\n10 P. M. for the Asylum, which was in the suburbs of Worcester.\r\nOn arriving at the gate, I am permitted to enter after a brief\r\ndelay, and proceed to the Institution. I had not gone far, when\r\nI am attacked by two huge Newfoundland dogs. I coax one, and\r\nintimidate the other, and advance. On reaching the front entrance\r\nof the Institution, I find it closed, and pass round to the rear,\r\nand enter the basement, where I find a solitary candle emitting\r\nits last beams, and a stout lunatic is seated in the corner, who\r\ninstantly approaches me with distended tongue, ejaculating: “Lar,\r\nlar,” about a dozen times in rapid succession, when I inquired:\r\n“Is young Mr. Clark at home,” to which he responds, with both\r\nhands on my shoulders: “Lar, lar, chick-a-de-dee.” and his eyes\r\nrolled fearfully, and his tongue appears and disappears with the\r\nvelocity of an angry rattle snake’s. I am alarmed, and strive\r\nin vain to extricate my shoulders from his giant grasp, when\r\nhe knocks off my hat, and grabs my hair, and pulls it so hard\r\nthat I cry murder, and he releases his hand, and kisses me, with\r\nboth arms around my neck. While picking up my hat, he grabs me\r\nagain around the waist, and belches his infernal “lar, lar,” and\r\nprotrudes his tongue, and laughs like thunder, and again incloses\r\nmy neck with his long arms, and evinces the affection of a bear,\r\nand squeezes me so hard, that I can scarcely speak or breathe,\r\nwhen I summon all the vigor that God and Nature gave me, and cast\r\nhim fearfully to the floor, and run for my life, with the lunatic\r\nand both dogs close at my heels. I proceed not far, when a ball\r\ncomes whizzing by, which is fired by a sentinel from the window\r\nof the Asylum, which increases my speed, and presently down I\r\ngo all sprawling into a vault, that was partially cleansed that\r\nday, or I would have been instantly drowned from a most awful\r\nsuffocation. I crawl out, with the aid of the man at the gate,\r\nwho comes to my rescue when he hears the report of the rifle,\r\nand the bark of the dogs. Presently the sentinel comes, and I\r\naccompany them into the dreary basement of the Asylum, where\r\nthe candle is in its final throes, when young Clark makes his\r\nappearance, and, after recognising my voice, is about to embrace\r\nme, when I most solemnly warn him to stand off, and, for God’s\r\nsake, to forbear until I am scraped and washed, and freshly\r\nclad. He runs to his bed room, and brings apparel, and a tub,\r\nand soon I am clean as mountain snow, and we eat and drink and\r\nsmoke and sing and laugh until the daylight does appear; and at\r\nmeridian, I leave Worcester for Andover, resolving never to leave\r\nagain, until I close my intellectual career in its sacred and\r\nmellifluous groves.\r\n\r\n(To be continued to our last roam.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegislative Robbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a small tornado in the coffee-pot about the scamps\r\nwho bought a majority of the Municipal and Rural Legislative\r\nMembers to vote them a lease of the Washington Market property.\r\nWords and threats and Legislative and Court appeals are all\r\nmoonshine.—When the scoundrels who lobbied the obnoxious Bill\r\nthrough the Legislature with gold appear in Washington Market,\r\nlet the butchers and fishermen and hucksters seize them and\r\nput a cable around their necks, and carry them to the piers’\r\nextremities, where big sharks often roam, and sink them to the\r\nwater’s bed, and draw them to the surface very slowly, and\r\nlet them blow as long as a porpoise, and sink them again, and\r\nyet again, trebly and quadruply, until they relinquish their\r\nDev-lin-ish claim to the market property, and swear on the\r\nsurface of the chilly waters, that they will never shadow the\r\nCapitol with their odious carcases during their natural lives.\r\nThis is the only mode, in these degenerate days, of foiling\r\nthe thievish propensities of the leading traffic rogues of the\r\nRepublican, American, and Democratic parties.
