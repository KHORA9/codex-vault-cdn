All loyal Americans love and honor him, the\r\ngreatest man in the history of the Republic.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia, where the Potomac\r\nRiver flowed past his father's farm. The farm-house, called \"Wakefield,\"\r\nwas burned, but the United States Government built a monument to mark\r\nthe place where it stood.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Wakefield\" was destroyed, the family lived for a time in a home,\r\nlater called Mount Vernon, in Fairfax County. But the real boyhood home\r\nof George Washington was a farm overlooking the Rappahannock River,\r\nwhere his parents went when he was about eight years old. His father,\r\nAugustine Washington, was a prosperous Virginia planter, and owned\r\nseveral fine estates.\r\n\r\nHis mother's name was Mary Ball. She was a beautiful and sensible woman,\r\nand a wise, firm and loving mother. She was his father's second wife and\r\nthere were two little lads already in the home, Lawrence and Augustine,\r\nwhen she came to take the place of their mother who had died. Besides\r\nthese two half-brothers, George had two sisters and three brothers. The\r\ntwo older sons were sent to England to school.\r\n\r\nWhen George was eight years old, Lawrence returned home, having finished\r\nhis studies. A great affection at once sprang up between them. George\r\nwas a fine, manly little fellow whom any big brother could love, and he\r\nlooked up to Lawrence as a model. Before long, Lawrence went away to the\r\nwars, serving under Admiral Vernon in the West Indies. His letters\r\nfilled George with admiration and he at once became commander-in-chief\r\nof all the boys at school; they had parades and battles in imitation of\r\nthose Lawrence wrote about.\r\n\r\nGeorge's father died when he was twelve years old, but, fortunately, he\r\nhad a wise and careful mother. She taught him respect and obedience to\r\nauthority; justice and courtesy to others; loyalty to God and his\r\ncountry. He had a high temper and a spirit of command, which she taught\r\nhim to control. A few times only in his life, when greatly provoked, did\r\nhis anger get beyond bounds. He loved and honored his mother deeply and\r\nnever forgot her teachings.\r\n\r\nGeorge and his younger brothers were educated in the country schools of\r\nVirginia. George soon showed that he had a practical mind, caring little\r\nfor poetry and literature. He liked mathematics and wanted to know about\r\nbusiness and keeping accounts. He spent hours copying into a book the\r\nexact forms of legal papers of all kinds. He was very neat and accurate\r\nin his school work and learned the value of system and order. He never\r\nbegan a thing without finishing it. He never did anything without\r\nknowing the reason why. When he grew up, these fine principles and this\r\nskill and accuracy, fitted him to take a great part in the history of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAll boys in those early days knew how to handle guns and manage horses.\r\nGeorge was an expert rider and loved the life of the woods. Being\r\nexceptionally tall and strong, he was the champion athlete at school. It\r\nis said he could throw a stone farther than any man in Virginia.\r\nBesides, he was so fair-minded that the boys always let him settle their\r\ndisputes and quarrels, knowing he would give every one a square deal. He\r\nwas the admired and trusted leader of them all.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his mother's care, George soon had the loving advice and\r\ndevoted friendship of his brother Lawrence. The war was over and that\r\nsplendid young gentleman had come home, and had married the charming\r\nAnne Fairfax. His house, willed to him by his father, stood upon a hill\r\noverlooking the beautiful Potomac River. To this lovely home, surrounded\r\nby lawns and stately trees, Lawrence gave the name Mount Vernon, in\r\nhonor of the Admiral under whom he had served. George spent as much time\r\nas possible here, where he met many persons of education and refinement.\r\n\r\nWhile he was still a young boy, he wrote out for himself a long list of\r\nrules of politeness and good behavior. He had observed that older people\r\ndo not like careless children, who forget the comforts and rights of\r\nothers. As a result, he was well liked by his brother's friends. Among\r\nthem were often military and naval officers, who told him stories of war\r\nand adventure in foreign lands. When he was fourteen, one of these\r\nofficers would have appointed him midshipman in the British navy. He was\r\neager to go, but his mother needed his help in the management of their\r\nproperty. So he continued two years more at school, studying\r\nmathematics, engineering and surveying.\r\n\r\nThe country was then new and wild and there was much work for land\r\nsurveyors, whose business it was to measure off boundaries and describe\r\nthe positions of rivers, mountains and forests in a piece of land.\r\nGeorge learned to do this so well that by the time he was sixteen, he\r\nwas appointed public surveyor of his county. His chief work for the next\r\nthree years was on the vast tracts of land owned by Lord Fairfax, the\r\nuncle of Lawrence Washington's wife. Though very young, George was a\r\ngreat favorite with his lordship, who often took him fox hunting.\r\nGeorge was a bold and skillful horseman and rode well after the hounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Surveying]\r\n\r\nThe estate of Lord Fairfax, lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock\r\nrivers and extending to the Alleghany Mountains, had been given to his\r\ngrandfather by King Charles II. These lands had never been settled nor\r\nsurveyed. People known as squatters were now moving in and taking\r\npossession of the best places without permission. It became necessary to\r\nhave the land surveyed, and these settlers either driven out or made to\r\npay for certain definite parts. Lord Fairfax knew no one who could do\r\nthis so well as George Washington, for he was strong and fair enough to\r\ndeal wisely with the rough settlers. It was just what George wanted to\r\ndo, and he gladly accepted the offer.\r\n\r\nIn March, George set out for his first trip into the wilderness. He was\r\njust sixteen years old, and it was his first big undertaking. George\r\nFairfax, Anne's brother, went with him. They crossed the mountains into\r\nthe lovely valley of the Shenandoah River. George's letters home were\r\nfull of the beauty of the country and the richness of the land. After\r\nthe first night, they found it more comfortable to sleep out under the\r\nsky than in the poor, untidy lodgings of the settlers. They lived on\r\nwild turkey and other game. They did their own cooking, roasting the\r\nmeat on sticks over the fire and eating it on broad, clean chips.\r\n\r\nThey met a party of war-painted Indians, and for the first time George\r\nsaw an Indian war dance. He studied the Indians carefully, for he wanted\r\nto understand their ways so that he might know how to deal with them.\r\nAll through his life, he was kind and just in his treatment of these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe work of surveying grants of land took them long distances among the\r\nmountains and through the valleys. They traveled on horseback over the\r\nwoodland trails, for there were as yet no roads. Sometimes they found\r\nthe rivers so high that they crossed in canoes, their horses swimming.\r\n\r\nGeorge returned in a month, well pleased with his adventures, and Lord\r\nFairfax, delighted with his success, paid him well.\r\n\r\nThe cordial, friendly, free life of Virginia pleased Lord Fairfax more\r\nthan did the life in England. When he heard the account of the\r\nfertility and beauty of the Shenandoah Valley, he decided to make his\r\nhome there. George laid out for him a fine farm of ten thousand acres.\r\nThe long stone farm-house, surrounded by servants' quarters, stables and\r\nkennels, was located on a charming hillside. The place was called\r\n\"Greenway Court,\" and visitors always found a warm welcome, whether\r\nIndians, woodsmen, or friends from the cities. Here George stayed when\r\non his surveying trips and during the hunting seasons.\r\n\r\nUntil he was nineteen, George spent his time at his work, or at home\r\nwith his mother or at Mount Vernon with Lawrence. The society of his\r\nhome and friends kept him from being spoiled by the roughness of the\r\nwilderness. He was now six feet, two inches in height, with a fresh,\r\nout-door complexion, blue eyes and brown hair. He had attractive\r\nmanners, he was careful about his dress, and presented a pleasing\r\nappearance. Through all his life, George Washington was a true\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nHe was so well paid for his work that he was able to buy several pieces\r\nof fine land. His noble character gave him a high place among the\r\nleading men of his colony. When he was nineteen, he was appointed one of\r\nfour military officers in the colonies, with the rank and pay of a\r\nmajor, $750 a year--a considerable sum at that time.\r\n\r\nTroubles had now arisen between the French and the English about the\r\nownership of lands west of the Alleghany Mountains. The Indians,\r\nregarding the lands as theirs, took part in the disturbance. To protect\r\nher frontiers, Virginia was divided into four districts, each under a\r\nleader, whose duty it was to organize and drill militia. George at once\r\nbegan to study military tactics and the arts of war. This was\r\ninterrupted by a trip to the West Indies with his beloved brother\r\nLawrence, who was ill of consumption.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly arrived there when George had a severe attack of\r\nsmallpox; though he soon got well, his face was scarred for life. He\r\nwrote home about the beauty of the island, the wonderful trees and\r\nfruits, and his social pleasures--dinners, parties and drives. For the\r\nfirst time in his life, he attended a theater. He visited the courts of\r\njustice and the fortifications; studied the laws, the soil and the\r\ncrops, learning all that could be learned about the island. The trip\r\nresulted in no lasting good for Lawrence, however, for he died the\r\nfollowing summer, beloved and honored by the colonists.\r\n\r\nGeorge was only twenty, but Lawrence left Mount Vernon in his charge,\r\nand the care of his wife and little daughter. The farm on the\r\nRappahannock had been given to George by their father. These two fine\r\nestates, with the property he had bought for himself, made George a\r\nlarge land owner when still a very young man. The care of all this\r\nproperty and his military duties kept him busy.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the trouble with the French had grown more serious.\r\nThe English, having settled the eastern sea-coast, claimed the lands to\r\nthe west for their settlers. The French claimed the same lands by reason\r\nof having explored them first. The rich country lying west of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, between the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, was\r\nthe region in question. The French were planning to hold it by a line of\r\nforts from the Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, and near the eastern end of\r\nLake Erie, they had built two forts.\r\n\r\nGovernor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia decided to send a message to the\r\nFrench commandant, Saint Pierre, warning him to keep off English soil.\r\nHe needed someone brave and strong enough to travel in the winter,\r\nthrough hundreds and hundreds of miles of forests and across mountains\r\nand swift rivers; who knew how to take care of himself in the woods; who\r\ncould get along with the Indians, and meet the French officers with\r\ncourtesy and wisdom.\r\n\r\nOf all the men in Virginia, the Governor chose George Washington, only\r\ntwenty-one years old, for this dangerous and important journey!\r\n\r\nSo, late in the autumn of 1753, Major Washington set out for the Ohio\r\nRiver, accompanied by Christopher Gist, a brave and daring frontiersman,\r\nand an Indian chief called Half King, as guides, together with\r\ninterpreters and a small company of trusted men. They traveled on\r\nhorseback, and took with them tents and supplies for the journey.\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded, cold weather overtook them and the forests became\r\nalmost impassable from snow. Traveling was so difficult that, when they\r\nreached the Monongahela River, they sent two men down the river in a\r\ncanoe with their baggage. These men waited for them at the fork where\r\nthe Allegheny River joins the Monongahela to form the Ohio. As soon as\r\nWashington saw this fork, he marked it as a splendid location for a\r\nfort, of which we shall learn more later.\r\n\r\nPushing on a little farther, Washington and his men reached a little\r\nsettlement on the Ohio River, where Indian chiefs met him in council. He\r\ntold them he had a letter for the French commandant and asked for their\r\nadvice and help. Indians are very dignified and slow in their councils.\r\nThey kept Washington waiting for several days. Then three of the\r\ngreatest chiefs went with him to the French forts. These were in what is\r\nnow northwestern Pennsylvania. It was a journey of many miles through\r\nsnow and mud and took nearly a week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starting for the French Camp]\r\n\r\nIt was almost the middle of December before Washington delivered his\r\nmessage to the French commandant, Saint Pierre. He was politely\r\nreceived by the French officers, with whom he discussed matters very\r\ntactfully. It took some days to prepare the reply to the Governor of\r\nVirginia. While they waited, the French tried, with presents and liquor,\r\nto coax Washington's Indian friends to leave him. At this time, the\r\nIndian tribes were in a difficult position. Both the French and the\r\nEnglish were trying to get their lands and each seeking to win their\r\nalliance against the other. Washington reminded the chiefs that he had\r\ntheir word of honor and so kept them with him.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the French reply, the party started back home, going as\r\nfar as possible in canoes. The rivers were swollen and full of ice,\r\nmaking the water-trip extremely dangerous. On Christmas Day, Washington\r\nbegan his long journey home--nearly a thousand miles through almost\r\ntrackless forests. The horses became so tired that he and Christopher\r\nGist decided to hurry on foot, in advance of the others, to the fork of\r\nthe Ohio, leaving their horses to be brought later. They tramped several\r\ndays, camping in the forests at night. An Indian met them and offered to\r\nshow them a short cut. But he was treacherous and guided them out of\r\ntheir way and tried to shoot them. They escaped, traveling as fast as\r\nthey could all night and all the next day.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall they came to the Allegheny River, expecting to find it\r\nfrozen over, but it was full of floating ice and they had no way to\r\ncross. After working a whole day, with only a small hatchet, they made a\r\nraft. In trying to pole this across the swift current, Washington was\r\nthrown into the water and was nearly drowned, but he managed to get on\r\nthe raft again and they reached an island, where they spent the night.\r\nIt was so intensely cold that Gist's hands and feet were frozen. The\r\nnext morning, they got ashore on the chunks of ice and by suppertime\r\nwere in the warm house of a trader named Frazier. In a few days, they\r\nwere rested enough to go on to Gist's home, where the Major bade his\r\ncompanion good-by and went on alone on horseback, through constant snows\r\nand bitter cold.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of January (1754), Major Washington delivered the\r\nFrench reply to Governor Dinwiddie. He had been absent almost three\r\nmonths on his perilous journey, and you can imagine that his mother and\r\nfriends were glad to see him safe at home again.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and the colonists were very proud of the way Washington had\r\nperformed his errand. His wisdom in his dealings with the Indians and\r\nthe French, his firmness, his courage and daring in the face of peril,\r\nhad indeed been marked. He had not only done well what he had been sent\r\nto do, but he had thoroughly examined the French forts and made notes of\r\nthe best places for English defenses. From that time, he was trusted\r\nwith important duties.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the reply from the French commandant stated\r\nthat the land belonged to French settlers and that they intended to keep\r\nit. It was Washington's opinion that the French intended in the spring\r\nto take possession of the whole country. The Governor of Virginia tried\r\nto interest other colonies to help fight the French. When they refused,\r\nVirginia sent Captain Trent to raise a company of men in the western\r\ncountry and to build a fort at the fork of the Ohio River, where the\r\ncity of Pittsburgh now stands.\r\n\r\nWashington, now Colonel, was ordered to raise three hundred men and\r\nbuild a road to this fort for cannon and supplies. He succeeded in\r\ngetting together one hundred and fifty men, who were poorly equipped,\r\nand without training. They built the road as far as Cumberland. Here, in\r\nApril, 1754, they met Captain Trent's men in retreat. A French force of\r\nthree hundred men had surprised them by suddenly paddling down the river\r\nin canoes, and planting their guns before the fort, with a summons to\r\nsurrender in an hour. One young officer and fifty men could not hold out\r\nagainst so many. So they surrendered and marched back over the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nEvery day traders and settlers came by, hurrying eastward. They said the\r\nFrench had taken the place at the fork of the Ohio and were building a\r\nstrong fort. They were coaxing the Indians, with fine presents, to fight\r\nthe English. If the British were to succeed against the French, they\r\nrequired a good road over which to march an army. So Colonel Washington\r\nhurried the road building as much as possible, but at best he could make\r\nonly slow progress in such mountainous country.\r\n\r\nHe received a message from the friendly chief Half King, telling him\r\nthat a French force was on its way to attack him. With a little band of\r\nmen, Washington made his way by night through the forest, in a heavy\r\nrain, to the camp of Half King. Indian scouts tracked the Frenchmen to a\r\nforest near a place called Great Meadows, where, in May, Washington and\r\nhis men attacked them on one side and the Indians on the other. The\r\nColonel was in the thickest of the fight and, for the first time, heard\r\nbullets whistling about his head. Ten Frenchmen were killed and\r\ntwenty-one taken prisoners. Half King sent the scalps of the dead men,\r\nwith tomahawks and strings of black wampum (small beads made of shells\r\nand sometimes used by the Indians as money), to all his allies and asked\r\nthem to join the English.\r\n\r\nThis was Washington's first skirmish and it opened the French and Indian\r\nWar that lasted seven years. Washington now encamped at Great Meadows\r\nwhere he dug rude trenches, which he called Fort Necessity. Supplies of\r\nfood and ammunition were slow in reaching him. He had been reenforced\r\nwith troops from the command of Colonel Fry, who had died on the way,\r\nand Washington was now made commander of the joint forces of about three\r\nhundred men.\r\n\r\nThe French finished their fort, which they called Duquesne (doo-cane).\r\nThen about nine hundred French and Indians attacked Washington. The\r\nEnglish fought bravely, but Half King and his men deserted Washington.\r\nBeing greatly outnumbered, he was obliged to surrender.\r\n\r\nColonel Washington led his beaten and discouraged men home, trying to\r\ncheer them while sharing their hardships. The campaign, fought against\r\nsuch odds, had not been successful, but Washington was publicly thanked\r\nfor his bravery and hard work.\r\n\r\nHe resigned his commission and went to look after his mother's affairs.\r\nHe soon settled at Mount Vernon and began work on his farm. His greatest\r\ndesire was to devote himself to country life, but he was needed too much\r\nby the colony to be allowed to live as a private man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON APPOINTED A MEMBER OF GEN. BRADDOCK'S STAFF--FRENCH AND\r\n     INDIAN WAR--WASHINGTON MADE COMMANDER OF VIRGINIA FORCES--CAUSES OF\r\n     THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION--WASHINGTON A MEMBER OF THE FIRST\r\n     CONTINENTAL CONGRESS--1755-1775\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (1775), England sent out General Braddock\r\nand a thousand soldiers, trained in battle, to take Fort Duquesne and\r\ndrive the French from the Ohio Valley. Washington was appointed a member\r\nof his staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Indians fell upon their flanks]\r\n\r\nGeneral Braddock was a brave and experienced soldier, but he knew\r\nnothing of warfare in a new country, amid great forests and savage foes.\r\nHe knew but one way to fight, which he had learned in the orderly camps\r\nand wide fields of Europe, and felt that nobody could defeat his\r\nwell-drilled soldiers. He thought Washington too young to give advice,\r\nand paid no attention to what he said. He looked with contempt upon the\r\nqueerly dressed, untrained Virginia troops, whom he called \"raw\r\nrecruits.\" Instead of being friendly and generous with the Indians,\r\nBraddock treated them coldly and they left him.\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty, the army and its supplies were brought over the\r\nmountains and approached Fort Duquesne early in July. As they drew near\r\nit, Braddock's men put on their scarlet uniforms and forded the river,\r\nwith bands playing and colors flying. It was the first time Washington\r\never saw a regular, well-disciplined army and he enjoyed the sight,\r\nalthough he wondered how their orderly ranks were going to fight among\r\nthe rocks and trees. Fearing an attack from the woods, he wanted to send\r\nIndian scouts and Virginia rangers ahead. General Braddock admired\r\nWashington, but could not help laughing at his fears. So he sent his\r\nsoldiers gayly forward.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, they were attacked in front! With hideous yells, the Indians\r\nfell upon their flanks. All that General Braddock had learned of warfare\r\nwas of little use to him now in the wilderness, but he was courageous\r\nand determined. Four horses were shot under him and he was fatally\r\nwounded. Before he died, he praised the Virginians, like a brave and\r\ntrue gentleman, and apologized to Washington for not heeding his advice.\r\nHe left to him his horse and his servant. All the staff officers were\r\nkilled but Washington. His splendid height and broad shoulders made him\r\na fine target, as he rode about the field trying to rally the men. His\r\nhorses were killed under him and his clothing was torn by bullets. An\r\nIndian chief said, \"A Power mightier than we shielded him. He cannot die\r\nin battle!\" The contest ended in a terrible defeat for the English. The\r\nregulars were useless and frightened. The despised Virginians were brave\r\nbut too few in number to meet the enemy alone. The survivors retreated\r\nwith the wounded to Fort Cumberland (Maryland).\r\n\r\nWashington had been twice defeated, but his courage and wisdom were so\r\ngreat that Virginia had made him Commander-in-Chief of her forces. His\r\ntasks were heavy for so young a man--he was only twenty-three at that\r\ntime! He did the best he could under many difficulties and raised and\r\ndrilled a force of militia.\r\n\r\nWhile facing a common danger, the colonies were not united then in any\r\nway, except under a Governor General sent out from England by the King.\r\nWashington had no authority over troops from any other colony, nor would\r\nofficers commissioned by the King take orders from him. Naturally, all\r\nsorts of disputes arose and finally Washington decided to go to Boston\r\nto put all these questions before Governor General William Shirley.\r\n\r\nTwo other young Virginia officers rode with him. It was midwinter. They\r\nhad hundreds of miles of mud roads to travel. They had fine horses and\r\nwere attended by mounted black servants in livery. The story of\r\nWashington's bravery in Braddock's defeat was known throughout the\r\ncountry. When these three handsome young officers reached the cities\r\nalong the way, they were splendidly entertained, for every one wanted to\r\nhonor Washington. He wore fine clothes and his appearance and manners\r\ndelighted all who met him. General Shirley received him with favor and\r\ngranted his requests.\r\n\r\nWord was brought that the French and Indians were attacking the settlers\r\nbeyond the mountains. Washington hurried back to his command at\r\nWinchester. He was anxious to have the forces and supplies necessary to\r\nattack Fort Duquesne at once. But while the people were clamoring for\r\nprotection, Washington was unable to help them on account of the unfair\r\ntreatment of Governor Dinwiddie, and the indifference of England. His\r\nforce was too small and untrained to make an attempt against the French;\r\nbut he remained patient and cheerful and for almost two years, he stood\r\nby the people who depended upon him. Then William Pitt became prime\r\nminister of England (1757) and at once took an interest in the defense\r\nof the colonies.\r\n\r\nWashington was ordered to proceed against Fort Duquesne. That French\r\ngarrison had been weakened by taking men and supplies to the\r\nbattle-front on the north, where they were being defeated by the\r\nBritish. Before Washington reached the fort, the commandant set fire to\r\nit and fled. Washington planted the British flag upon the still smoking\r\nruins and on the same site built Fort Pitt, which he named in honor of\r\nthe great English statesman. This is where the city of Pittsburgh now\r\nstands. Thus ended the French occupation of the Ohio Valley.\r\n\r\nThe many cares and hardships Washington had suffered had made him ill\r\nand he returned to Mount Vernon, hoping that his military life was over.\r\nHe was greatly loved and honored by his soldiers and his fellow\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington was twenty-seven years old, he married a charming young\r\nwidow, Mrs. Martha Custis. The wedding took place January 6, 1759.\r\n\r\nMrs. Custis had a little girl, Martha, four years old, and a little boy,\r\nJohn, who was six. Washington dearly loved these children, whom he\r\ntaught and trained with great care. He and his wife were great favorites\r\nsocially and at their home (Mount Vernon) they entertained many guests.\r\nHere the Custis children met many of the prominent men of those days.\r\n\r\nOne of these visitors was Louis Philippe, the exiled King of France.\r\nNoticing how many letters Washington wrote, he asked him if he were not\r\nafraid of writing something he might regret. Washington answered that he\r\nwas careful never to do or say a thing he could afterward be sorry for.\r\n\r\nWashington kept fine horses and dogs and was very fond of hunting.\r\nAlthough busy with the care of his great farms and his wife's large\r\nestate, he found time to follow the hounds. His wisdom and honesty were\r\nso trusted that, aside from his own affairs, other people gave him\r\ncharge of theirs. He was often called upon to settle disputes, thus\r\npreventing law-suits. He was a member of the Virginia Legislature, then\r\ncalled the House of Burgesses, of which he attended every meeting and\r\nwas careful to know all about the affairs of the colony. When he first\r\ntook his seat in the Legislature, he was thanked for his military\r\nservice to the colony. He rose to reply, but could only blush and\r\nstammer. The speaker said, \"Sit down, Mr. Washington, your modesty\r\nequals your valor!\"\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years, Washington led a peaceful and happy life with his\r\nfamily. He was kept busy looking after his vast estates. But then again,\r\nthe country began to claim his attention. George III was King of\r\nEngland. Under his rule, unjust laws were made for the colonies, which\r\nthe wise men of America knew would destroy their rights. The colonies\r\nwere not represented in the British Parliament (where the laws were\r\nmade) and so claimed that Parliament had no right to tax them. Needing\r\nmoney, England laid heavy taxes on the colonies, which they would not\r\npay. After much trouble, all the taxes were taken off except the one on\r\ntea. That was left to prove England's right to tax the colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1773, several ships were sent over loaded with tea,\r\nwhich was to be sold very cheaply. But the colonists refused to have tea\r\nat any price rather than submit to \"taxation without representation.\"\r\nThere can be no freedom in a land whose people may be taxed without\r\ntheir consent. From several ports, the ships were sent back. In Boston,\r\na party of citizens dressed as Indians, boarded the ships at night,\r\nDecember 16, and threw all the tea into the harbor. This is called the\r\nBoston Tea Party. The same violence occurred at Annapolis, Maryland. To\r\npunish the city of Boston, Parliament passed a law that no ship should\r\ncome in or go out of her harbor. The port was closed and business\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Boston Tea-Party]\r\n\r\nNews of this was carried to the other colonies. In Virginia, a day of\r\nfasting and prayer was appointed. The people did not want to give up\r\ntheir liberties, for which many had come to America. It seemed, on the\r\nother hand, very dreadful to go to war with the mother country. The\r\ncolonies were independent of one another, but knew they must stand\r\ntogether against the injustice of England. Meetings were held in each\r\ncolony to talk matters over, and it was decided to hold a General\r\nCongress, made up of men selected by each colony.\r\n\r\nIn the Virginia Convention, Washington was one of the first to say that\r\nthe colonies ought to be allowed to govern themselves, make their own\r\nlaws and decide their own taxes. He was usually very quiet in all that\r\nhe said and did, but the wrongs of Boston had so stirred him that he\r\nmade a fiery speech. He said he would raise a thousand men, pay them\r\nhimself and march at their head to the relief of Boston. He said he had\r\nhoped there would be no break with England and he shrank from the horror\r\nof war, but now he began to feel that it could not be avoided and if so,\r\nno sacrifice was too great to preserve the liberties of America for the\r\nmillions who would some day call it their home.\r\n\r\nHe was one of several delegates chosen to represent Virginia in the\r\nGeneral Congress, which was held at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia,\r\nSeptember 5, 1774. There were fifty-two members, the ablest men of all\r\nthe colonies. Someone asked Patrick Henry who was the greatest man among\r\nthem and he said, \"Colonel Washington, if you speak of solid information\r\nand sound judgment.\" These men met, not as members of separate colonies,\r\nbut as Americans with one country and one cause. Each meeting was opened\r\nwith a prayer. Not often, in the whole history of the world, have men\r\nhad to decide more important and difficult questions.\r\n\r\nFor almost two months, they discussed all the points in which they\r\nbelieved they were wronged by England. They were careful and just in all\r\nthat they said. They wanted to keep peace. None of them wished to be\r\nindependent of England. Neither were they willing to submit to\r\ninjustice and the loss of their rights and privileges. They wrote a\r\npetition to the King and letters to the people of England and of Canada.\r\nThese papers were very fair and wise and showed the noble minds and\r\nloyal hearts of these early great Americans. They were not rebelling,\r\nthey were simply declaring their rights. In reply, England only passed\r\nmore unjust laws. The spirit of revolt spread through the colonies.\r\nMilitia was organized; some were called \"Minute Men\" because they\r\npromised to leave everything and go to war at a minute's notice. Months\r\npassed in active preparations. Military stores were collected. The\r\npatriots were determined to face death rather than submit longer to\r\nBritish oppression.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the British General Gage, stationed in Boston with four\r\nthousand British soldiers, decided to surprise and take, by night, the\r\nsupplies of the militia in Concord, twenty miles away. Dr. Joseph\r\nWarren, one of the patriots, heard of it and secretly sent Paul Revere\r\ngalloping out of Boston on a fast horse to awaken the people along the\r\nway and carry the alarm to Concord. When the British reached Lexington\r\n(about nine miles from Boston), they found seventy or eighty citizens\r\narmed and waiting for them in the darkness!\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 19th of April, 1775, the first battle of the\r\ngreat American Revolution was fought (the Battle of Lexington). The\r\ntrained soldiers of England soon scattered the handful of patriots at\r\nLexington and Concord, but, as the day wore on, they were joined by\r\nother patriots, and by the night of April 20th, General Gage found\r\nhimself besieged in Boston by a rustic army of 16,000 men. The news of\r\nthe battle spread rapidly and spurred the colonies to instant and bitter\r\nwar. Washington said that the once happy America must be drenched in\r\nblood, or inhabited by slaves, and that no true man could hesitate to\r\nchoose death for himself rather than slavery for his country. He was at\r\nMount Vernon when the sad news came, getting ready to attend the second\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Israel Putnam]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION--WASHINGTON MADE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF\r\n     THE CONTINENTAL ARMY--BRITISH FORCED TO LEAVE BOSTON--1775-1776\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Ragged Continental]\r\n\r\nAt the second Continental Congress, held May 10, 1775, Washington was\r\nmade chairman of committees for getting ammunition, supplies and money\r\nfor the war. His military knowledge and experience enabled him to make\r\nrules and regulations for an army, and he advised what forts should be\r\ngarrisoned. (Troops placed in a fort for defense.) It was necessary for\r\nCongress to take care of the army of 16,000 patriots that had hastily\r\ngathered in the neighborhood of Boston, and to appoint a\r\nCommander-in-Chief of all the forces of the colonies. They had to decide\r\nas to who in all the country, could best be trusted with this important\r\nand responsible position. All eyes turned to Washington. When his name\r\nwas first mentioned for this place, he, with his usual modesty, slipped\r\nout of the room. But he was chosen Commander-in-Chief by the unanimous\r\n(all agreeing) vote of Congress. When told of his appointment, he\r\naccepted, though he said he did not think he was \"equal to the command\r\nhe was honored with.\" He refused to take any pay for his services,\r\nsaying that no money, nor anything else but duty and patriotism could\r\ntempt him to leave his home. Having one of the loveliest homes in\r\nAmerica, he gave up his comfort and happiness and risked all he had for\r\nhis country. Congress also appointed four major-generals--one of them\r\nthe brave old Israel Putnam--and eight brigadier-generals.\r\n\r\nThere were many men in Congress at that time whose names Americans can\r\nnever forget. They did many wise things, but none was more fortunate\r\nthan this choice of a Commander-in-Chief for the Continental Army. One\r\nof the members, John Adams, called him \"the modest and virtuous, the\r\ngenerous and brave George Washington.\"\r\n\r\nWashington's early life and training fitted him in a wonderful way for\r\nthis great and difficult post. As a young surveyor, he had learned much\r\nabout the country and how to make his way through forests and mountains.\r\nLater, as a commander, he had learned how to fight in the woods, and all\r\nthe secrets of frontier warfare. With Braddock, he had learned that\r\nsoldiers drilled on the parade grounds and battle-fields of Europe did\r\nnot know what to do when hemmed in by rocks and brush and savage\r\nenemies in a new and uncleared country. He had also learned how to value\r\nand how to handle the independent, though rough-looking, soldiers of the\r\nbackwoods. With all this knowledge and experience, with his clear mind\r\nand high courage, Washington was the most dangerous foe the British\r\ncould have.\r\n\r\nIn June (1775), Washington, as Commander-in-Chief of the army, left\r\nPhiladelphia for Boston. There was no time to visit Mount Vernon. He\r\nwrote to his wife, telling her to be brave and that he trusted God would\r\nsoon bring him safely home. General Philip Schuyler and General Charles\r\nLee and a light horse troop went with him. As they galloped along the\r\nway, people came out of the farms and villages to see the great General.\r\nWashington, now forty-three years old, was very splendid and dignified\r\nin his bearing, yet always modest and quiet--a gentleman and a soldier.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles from Philadelphia, they met a messenger from Boston\r\nriding a fleet horse and bearing dispatches to Congress. They stopped\r\nand heard from him the news of the Battle of Bunker Hill, which had just\r\nbeen fought (June 17, 1775). The British had been victorious, but not\r\nuntil more than half their number had been killed and the patriots had\r\nfired their last round of ammunition. When Washington was told how\r\nbravely the militia had stood their ground, he said, \"The liberties of\r\nthe country are safe!\" He was not troubled by the triumph of the\r\nBritish, because he felt sure the Americans would win when properly\r\narmed and drilled. This news made him more anxious to reach the scene\r\nof action and he traveled on as fast as he could. He left General\r\nSchuyler to command the patriot forces in New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Charge at Bunker Hill]\r\n\r\nOn July second, he reached his headquarters in Cambridge, where he was\r\nreceived with cheers and the thunder of cannon. The men had so little\r\npowder that they could not give him a great salute, but they spared all\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 3, 1775, Washington took command of the Continental\r\nArmy under a large elm tree, which still stands on the Cambridge Common.\r\nThe patriot army was a rather discouraging sight. The 16,000 men had\r\nbeen called together without any preparation. They were farmers,\r\nfishermen and shop-keepers. They had very little discipline or order\r\nand were in need of everything--arms, ammunition, food, clothing, tents,\r\nshoes. As yet they were not one army, but a collection of separate\r\ncompanies from the different New England colonies. Each had its own\r\nregulations, its own officers and its own interests. There were jealousy\r\nand often misunderstanding among them. After reviewing this army,\r\nGeneral Washington visited the American forts strung in an irregular\r\nsemi-circle around Boston, within which the British forces were\r\nbesieged.\r\n\r\nHe found the men camped in rough board shacks, or shelters made of turf\r\nand brush, and dressed in the clothes they wore on their farms and in\r\nthe villages. Here and there was a tent. No wonder the British, in their\r\norderly tents and fine scarlet uniforms, thought they could soon scatter\r\nthis mixed crowd! There was but one exception. General Nathanael Greene,\r\nof Rhode Island, had raised and drilled a body of men and brought them\r\nto Boston under fine discipline, with good tents and clothing. His camp\r\nshowed what could be done. General Greene became one of Washington's\r\nmost faithful and lifelong friends, and was one of the greatest generals\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the undisciplined, ragged Continental troops were the\r\ntrained British soldiers, commanded by experienced generals. They were\r\nwell fortified in Boston and the harbor was defended by their warships.\r\nThey felt no fear of the irregular line of posts with which the\r\nAmericans thought to hem them in.\r\n\r\nWashington at once began the task of organizing the army and teaching\r\nand training the men. In this he showed skill beyond almost any other\r\nman in history. He was beset with many difficulties, among them the\r\njealousy and discontent of some of the officers. There was one general,\r\nhowever, who was always ready to serve in any place and put the cause\r\nabove himself. This was Israel Putnam, the brave man who was plowing in\r\nhis field when he heard of the Battle of Lexington. He left his plow in\r\nthe furrow, unhitched his horses and galloped sixty-eight miles that day\r\nto Cambridge! He was nearly sixty years of age at the time. He was much\r\nloved by the army for his bravery and generosity and all were glad when\r\n\"Old Put\" was appointed Major-General.\r\n\r\nWashington formed the army into six brigades of six regiments each. He\r\nwrote to Congress to appoint at once officers to help him. He wanted an\r\nadjutant-general to train and discipline the troops; a quartermaster to\r\narrange for all supplies, and an officer to look after enlistments. The\r\nmen had enlisted for only a short time and numbers returned home after\r\nthis term of enlistment expired; so it was hard to keep the army up to\r\nfighting strength. The lack of powder was also a very serious matter and\r\nWashington sent to the southern colonies, asking for what they had in\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nHe at once began to improve the defenses and strengthen the weak places.\r\nSoon a strong line of fortifications surrounded the city. The strictest\r\ndiscipline was required and Washington visited the forts every day. The\r\narrival of fourteen hundred riflemen from Pennsylvania, Virginia and\r\nMaryland was a great help; among these were the stalwart sharp-shooters\r\nunder Colonel Daniel Morgan, whom Washington had known in the French\r\nwar. They were six feet tall and over, and dressed in hunting shirts and\r\nwide-brimmed hats. They had marched six hundred miles in three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed in drilling the army and trying to get powder.\r\nWashington was besieging Boston without any powder, though the British\r\nlittle thought that was the reason he did not attack them! All he could\r\ndo was to cut them off from nearby supplies of food, but they sent out\r\nwarships with men who plundered the coasts of New England. The people\r\ndrove their cattle inland and fought the invaders boldly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Washington set out for Cambridge]\r\n\r\nKnowing that he could not return home, General Washington sent for his\r\nwife to come to Cambridge. Mrs. Washington set out on the long journey\r\nin her carriage, drawn by four horses, and accompanied by her son and\r\nhis wife. (Her daughter had died in the meantime.) Colored servants in\r\nscarlet and white liveries rode beside the carriage. Escorts of\r\nhorsemen brought them from city to city, until they arrived in camp,\r\njust before Christmas. It had been more than half a year since the\r\nGeneral had seen his family and his work was made easier by having with\r\nhim those he loved. The Craigie house in Cambridge (later the home of\r\nthe poet Longfellow), was Washington's headquarters. Here Mrs.\r\nWashington helped him entertain officers and members of Congress. The\r\nGeneral was so busy that he was often obliged to leave his guests at the\r\ntable, while his own meal remained unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe plundering attacks by the British upon the New England coast became\r\nso violent that, without waiting for Congress to act, Washington had\r\nseveral armed vessels fitted out. They were commanded by such brave sea\r\ncaptains as John Manly and John Paul Jones and were ordered by the\r\nGeneral to defend the coast and capture British ships bringing supplies\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks passed, it grew more difficult to keep up the numbers of\r\nthe army. The men grew tired of the long and uncomfortable encampment\r\nwithout any fighting. Had there been any powder, their General would\r\ngladly have given them fighting enough! All through the war, Washington\r\nwas troubled and handicapped by these short enlistments, as he had to be\r\nconstantly training new recruits.\r\n\r\nIn December, some Connecticut troops decided to go home without even\r\nremaining for their full time. Some took their guns and ammunition. This\r\ndesertion was a bad thing for the discipline of the army, and sorely\r\ndistressed Washington. On their way home, these men were made to feel\r\nwhat the people thought of their conduct, for no one would give them\r\nfood, and their friends would not receive them kindly when they arrived.\r\nThe day after they walked off, something happened that put new life into\r\nthe camp. A long train of wagons came lumbering and jolting into\r\nCambridge, with flags flying and an escort of soldiers and horsemen.\r\nWhat was in the wagons?--Cannon! and thousands of guns and shot and\r\nthirty-two tons of musket balls! Captain John Manly, of the ship\r\n_Essex_, had captured a large British brigantine and taken her cargo of\r\nmunitions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Washington's efforts to appeal to their patriotism, the\r\nsoldiers still wanted to go home. They were sick of the discomforts of\r\ncamp. By January (1776), only ten thousand men were left, and there was\r\ndanger of the poorly defended lines being taken. But for some reason,\r\nthe British made no attack. During this disheartening time, General\r\nGreene was a great help, with his courage and patriotism and\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\nIn February, Colonel Henry Knox returned from the forts on Lake\r\nChamplain with a long train of forty-two ox-sleds, carrying artillery\r\nand ammunition. He had gone in midwinter after the supplies of cannon\r\nand lead captured from the British the year before and had performed his\r\nerrand with daring and faithfulness. Then ten regiments of militia\r\narrived and at last, Washington and his generals thought they had men\r\nand ammunition enough to attack the British.\r\n\r\nGeneral Putnam had fortified a hill north of the city of Boston. Troops\r\nwere sent, on the night of March 4, to fortify Dorchester Heights, to\r\nthe south from which Boston and the harbor could be swept by guns. That\r\nthe British might not hear the noise of the wagons and pickaxes, the\r\npatriots bombarded the city all night. The ground was deeply frozen and\r\nthe work hard. But Washington was with the men, everywhere helping and\r\nencouraging them.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, the British looked upon four forts raised as if by\r\nthe magic of an Aladdin's lamp! General Sir William Howe determined to\r\nattack these new works. A storm of great fury arose and he waited. The\r\nstorm continued all night and all day. The patriots used this time to\r\nstrengthen their forts, and the British saw they could not hold the city\r\nagainst them; so they prepared to leave, taking everything with them\r\nthat could be of use to the \"rebels.\" They were allowed to embark upon\r\ntheir ships without being fired on, to prevent their burning the city.\r\nThey sailed away to Halifax. After being besieged ten months, Boston\r\nfell into Washington's hands without a battle! Washington was thanked by\r\nCongress and given a gold medal in honor of the capture of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE SIGNED--BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND--BATTLE\r\n     OF WHITE PLAINS--WASHINGTON CROSSES THE DELAWARE AND SURPRISES THE\r\n     HESSIANS AT TRENTON--1776-1777\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now consider some events which had taken place elsewhere in the\r\ncountry. Before Washington had been made Commander-in-Chief, Ethan\r\nAllen, with the \"Green Mountain Boys\" (so-called because they came from\r\nVermont, the \"Green Mountain State\"), had surprised and taken, without a\r\nfight, Fort Ticonderoga in eastern New York. Shortly after, Crown Point\r\non Lake Champlain was captured by Colonel Benedict Arnold. The capture\r\nof these two British forts opened the way to Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Liberty Bell]\r\n\r\nWhile Washington was building up the army and besieging Boston, an\r\nexpedition against Montreal and Quebec was planned. General Richard\r\nMontgomery, who commanded a force on Lake Champlain, marched up to\r\nMontreal, which surrendered (November, 1775) without a struggle.\r\nBenedict Arnold was sent, with about twelve hundred men from Boston, to\r\njoin Montgomery's forces in the attack on Quebec. They were to make\r\ntheir way up the Kennebec River and through the dense Maine woods.\r\nArnold was a brave soldier and led his men through hardships and perils,\r\nthrough snow and ice and over frozen mountains, until they reached\r\nQuebec. On the last day of December, with the ground frozen and covered\r\nwith snow, the two American armies made a combined attack on the city;\r\nbut Quebec did not surrender, though the patriots fought with desperate\r\ncourage and daring. The gallant Montgomery led his men up the heights,\r\ndashing forward with the cry, \"Push on, my brave boys! Quebec is ours!\"\r\nA volley from a cannon killed him and scattered his men. The Americans\r\nsuffered terrible losses. In the death of General Montgomery, America\r\nlost one of her bravest soldiers and truest gentlemen. He was deeply\r\nmourned in England as well as in America.\r\n\r\nBenedict Arnold also was beaten back; his leg was shattered by a musket\r\nball, but he bravely fortified his position and with five hundred men\r\nbesieged Quebec. He wrote, \"I am in the way of my duty and I know no\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\nAs the weeks passed, the men grew weary and homesick. They suffered\r\nuntold hardships from want of food, clothing and shelter, and from the\r\nbitter cold of the Canadian winter. Though Arnold and his men fought\r\nbravely, Quebec did not fall into the hands of the Americans. Their\r\nattacks were repulsed by the British forces in command of the city.\r\n\r\nShortly after the capture of Boston, Washington brought his army to New\r\nYork, as he feared the British might take that city. He sent General\r\nPutnam to fortify New York and the Hudson River, and he followed,\r\ngathering troops on the way. When he arrived, he fortified Brooklyn\r\nHeights, Long Island, and put General Greene in command. He had only\r\nabout eight thousand men to garrison the forts about New York.\r\n\r\nThe same troubles from short enlistments, lack of discipline and\r\nsupplies had to be met. Washington was freely giving himself to the just\r\nand righteous cause of American freedom, and he would not be discouraged\r\neven by want of spirit and obedience in his troops. There was another\r\ndifficulty. All over the country and especially in New York, many\r\npersons, called Tories, were still loyal to King George III, and\r\nWashington feared treachery from them.\r\n\r\nThe British fleet, however, had not gone to New York, but up to Halifax.\r\nGeneral Howe and his army waited in Halifax for ships and men from\r\nEngland. With their help, he expected to drive the Americans out of New\r\nYork and away from the Hudson River. England intended to crush the\r\ncolonies and hired German troops, called Hessians, in addition to her\r\nown forces. It was now a year since the Battle of Lexington was fought\r\nand Washington feared that the war would be a long one.\r\n\r\nHe went to Philadelphia to consult with Congress. To succeed against the\r\nBritish, the colonies, he knew, must work together in earnest for their\r\ncommon liberty. The army must have regular pay and supplies, and the men\r\nmust promise to serve as long as needed. Congress established a war\r\noffice and ordered that the term of enlistment be for three years.\r\n\r\nWashington returned to New York and soon afterwards a conspiracy (plot)\r\namong the Tories was discovered. Many arrests were made. A member of\r\nWashington's body-guard was found to be in the plot and he was hanged.\r\nWhile this was going on, the British fleet arrived in the harbor. There\r\nwere one hundred and thirty ships. The troops--30,000--were landed on\r\nStaten Island. Washington was very uneasy with this large force before\r\nhim and he knew not how many treacherous Tories about him.\r\n\r\nFor a year, the Americans had been fighting on account of unjust laws\r\nand taxes. But England had grown still more severe and unfair, until\r\nmany began to believe that the only hope for peace and prosperity in the\r\ncolonies was in their union with one another and their separation from\r\nEngland. Washington had hoped that the trouble with the mother country\r\nmight be peaceably settled. But the time had now come when he urged\r\nCongress to declare the independence of the colonies and throw off the\r\nBritish yoke. While he, in New York, was facing foes within and without,\r\nCongress in Philadelphia was discussing this great question behind\r\nlocked doors. Anxious throngs crowded the streets waiting for the\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 4th of July, 1776, the Liberty Bell in the State House\r\ntower rang out the glad tidings that Congress had adopted the\r\nDeclaration of Independence! Washington was overjoyed when a messenger\r\nbrought him the word. On the evening of July 9, he had his army drawn up\r\nto hear the Declaration read before each brigade. He said he hoped that\r\nit would inspire each man to live and act with courage, \"as became a\r\nChristian soldier defending the dearest rights and liberties of his\r\ncountry.\" The people of New York tore down a statue of King George and\r\nmelted it into bullets for the army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The British fleet arrived]\r\n\r\nThere was not much time for rejoicing, however, considering that the\r\nBritish ships were in New York harbor. Among them was the flagship of\r\nLord Richard Howe, Admiral of the British Navy and brother of General\r\nHowe. He came with a proposal of peace from England and tried to\r\ndeliver it in the form of a message addressed to \"George Washington.\"\r\nWashington, resenting this insult, refused to receive the message and\r\ndid not accept it until it was returned properly addressed to \"General\r\nGeorge Washington.\" Congress thanked him for making the British respect\r\nthe dignity of his office.\r\n\r\nAmerica had decided to be free at any cost, and while her cause did not\r\nlook very promising, it was too late to talk about peace. Washington\r\nknew his forces were not strong enough to defend New York. The enemy had\r\nits great fleet, and thousands of men already on land with thousands\r\nmore coming.\r\n\r\nWashington had brought the army up to fifteen thousand men, but\r\nhesitated to rely on this force. He was still troubled by jealousies\r\namong the officers and among the troops from the different colonies,\r\nalthough he tried to show them that honor and success depended on\r\nself-forgetfulness and working together for the cause. The militia could\r\nnot be counted on and could be called out only for special occasions.\r\nWhole companies would leave at the end of their enlistment, even though\r\nthey were greatly needed. We cannot always be proud of this fighting\r\nforce, though it showed splendid courage when really in action. The men\r\nhad not learned that a brave soldier does not quit, but patiently\r\nendures hardships. At best, Washington's army was too small to strongly\r\nfortify any one place about New York. He had no idea where the British\r\nwould attack first, and so had spread the army out until it was a long,\r\nweak line.\r\n\r\nOn August 26 and 27 (1776), the enemy surrounded the fortifications at\r\nBrooklyn on Long Island. The Americans fought with great bravery, but\r\nwere outnumbered and defeated. About two thousand were killed, wounded\r\nor captured. Regiments had hurried to their help from points nearby and\r\nmost of the army was finally on Long Island. Fearing his whole force\r\nwould be destroyed, Washington decided to withdraw to New York, which he\r\ndid in the night, under cover of heavy rain, wind and fog. He had not\r\nslept for two days and nights and had hardly been out of the saddle, but\r\nhe watched the men embark with all their belongings, and he himself went\r\nin the last boat. When the British soldiers awoke in the morning, they\r\nwere amazed to find that the whole American army had disappeared!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nathan Hale]\r\n\r\nIt was important for Washington to know what the next move of the\r\nBritish would be. Captain Nathan Hale, a fine young officer, volunteered\r\nto act as spy. He succeeded in passing through the enemy's lines and\r\nmaking notes and drawings, but on his way back, he was captured by the\r\nBritish. On Sept. 22, 1776, this noble patriot was hanged. His last\r\nwords, while standing on the scaffold, were, \"I only regret that I have\r\nbut one life to lose for my country.\"\r\n\r\nThe army in New York was in great danger of being surrounded and\r\ncaptured by the British, whose gunboats bombarded all the forts. More\r\nthan half of the population of the city were Tories and several thousand\r\nof the militia had deserted. Washington was kind of heart and did not\r\nblame them too much, but he knew that his force was too small to hold\r\nthe city of New York; so he began to withdraw to the northern end of\r\nManhattan Island. The British moved upon the city and found it easy to\r\nland, because the soldiers, left to defend the first fort they attacked,\r\nran off in confusion. Washington, hearing the shots, galloped into their\r\nmidst and tried to rally them, but they scattered like frightened\r\nrabbits. Washington lost his temper, and throwing his hat on the ground,\r\nhe exclaimed, \"Are these the men with whom I am to defend America?\" He\r\nwould have been killed or captured by the oncoming British, if one of\r\nhis officers had not seized the bridle of his horse and dragged him\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the American army soon assembled in a strong camp on\r\nthe rocky heights near King's Bridge, defended by Fort Washington. Here\r\nthey were attacked by the British (September, 1776), when the regular\r\nContinental troops fought valiantly and proved victorious, wiping out\r\nthe disgrace of the retreat which put General Howe in possession of New\r\nYork. This success greatly strengthened the army.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had repulsed the British at King's Bridge, but Lord Howe\r\nsent gunboats up the Hudson River to cut off Washington from his\r\nsupplies, which were stored in Connecticut. Washington thought he might\r\nbe forced to surrender if he remained, so he decided to leave a garrison\r\nat Fort Washington and take the army into camp at White Plains (New\r\nYork). A great many of his men were sick or wounded, and the hospital\r\narrangements were poor and insufficient. The disabled men were lying in\r\ncrowded sheds, stables and any other places of shelter that could be\r\nfound. Washington did all he could to relieve their sufferings, and in a\r\nletter to Congress, he begged for better pay for the men and better\r\nsupplies. He also urged that a call be made for men who would enlist for\r\nthe entire term of war, however long it might be. A British officer\r\nwrote to a friend in London: \"The rebel army is so wretched! I believe\r\nno nation ever saw such a set of tatterdemalions (ragged fellows). There\r\nare few coats among them but are out at the elbows and in a whole\r\nregiment, there is hardly a sound pair of breeches. How they must be\r\npinched by the winter! We, who are warmly clothed, feel it severely.\"\r\n\r\nThe camp at White Plains was attacked by the British, with heavy loss on\r\nboth sides, and Washington again withdrew his men in the night and\r\nentrenched himself at North Castle on the east side of the Hudson. The\r\nBritish did not follow him, and this left Washington in doubt as to what\r\ntheir next move would be. He left a part of the troops in camp,\r\nstationed a strong force in the Highlands to defend the Hudson River,\r\nand with the rest of his army, crossed into New Jersey, opposite Fort\r\nWashington. From this point, he saw General Howe capture Fort\r\nWashington and, without power to prevent it, beheld his brave men\r\nbayoneted by the cruel German soldiers. The supplies and the survivors\r\nof the garrison--about twenty-eight hundred men--fell into the hands of\r\nthe enemy (November 16, 1776). Following this, Lord Charles Cornwallis\r\nled six thousand British across the river and attacked Washington's\r\nforces, obliging him to retreat across New Jersey, over the Delaware\r\nRiver and into Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWashington had with him but three thousand soldiers, ragged and half\r\nstarved, but they loved their Commander and were ready to make any\r\nsacrifice for him and their country. He had sent orders to General\r\nCharles Lee to bring reinforcements from the north, but Lee was in no\r\nhurry to obey. Lord Howe, who was anxious for peace, issued an order for\r\nall Americans to lay down their arms and go home; for Congress to break\r\nup, and he promised pardon for every one if the order was obeyed. A\r\ngreat many were faint-hearted enough to give up, even though America had\r\nsacrificed so much for freedom. But Washington was undaunted and\r\nremained true to his purpose to free the colonies. He cheered his\r\nsuffering soldiers and, after securing reenforcements from the militia\r\nof New Jersey and Pennsylvania, he took his stand at a point across the\r\nDelaware River opposite Trenton. He seized all the boats on the river\r\nand when Lord Cornwallis marched into Trenton, there were no boats for\r\nhis troops and they could not cross the river to attack the Americans.\r\nLeaving Hessian troops to guard Trenton, Cornwallis withdrew to wait\r\nuntil ice should bridge the river for him. These German--or\r\nHessian--soldiers were hated by the Americans on account of their\r\ncruelty and because they were fighting for pay.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the British intended to attack Philadelphia and\r\nGeneral Putnam was sent to defend it. Congress took fright and moved to\r\nBaltimore. The British held New York and Washington knew the people\r\nwould lose heart if Philadelphia should also be taken.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee's forces at last arrived, though the General himself,\r\nbecause of his carelessness and laziness, had been captured on the way.\r\nWith this reenforcement and with forces commanded by Generals Gates and\r\nSullivan, which had joined him, Washington intended to surprise the\r\ngarrison in Trenton. He divided his army into three detachments and\r\nplanned to cross the Delaware on Christmas night, because he knew the\r\nGerman soldiers would be drinking and frolicking on that holiday.\r\nWashington himself led about twenty-four hundred men, with artillery, to\r\na crossing at a point nine miles up the river. The night was dark and\r\nstormy. It was hailing and snowing and bitter cold. The river was filled\r\nwith drifting cakes of ice, which imperiled the boats. The crossing was\r\nextremely dangerous and it took more than ten hours to get the troops\r\nand their guns on the other side. When he arrived, Washington found the\r\nother two detachments had not started, so his forces alone surprised the\r\nHessians completely, captured Trenton and took a thousand prisoners!\r\n\r\nMessengers were dispatched to call the army from the Hudson and to\r\ngather the New Jersey militia. When these forces were assembled,\r\nWashington again crossed the icy river into Pennsylvania, but returned\r\nand occupied Trenton a few days later. Lord Cornwallis, who had come\r\ndown in a hurry from Princeton, planned to \"bag the fox in the morning.\"\r\nBut he found the \"fox\" had been too sly for him, for Washington, leaving\r\nhis camp fires burning, had quietly led his army off at dead of night,\r\nby a rough and roundabout way, to Princeton. At sunrise (Jan. 3, 1777),\r\nhe surprised and put to flight the regiment of British which had started\r\nout from Princeton to help Cornwallis at Trenton.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cornwallis awoke to find his \"fox\" gone and he set out for\r\nPrinceton, arriving just as the patriots had completed the destruction\r\nof the bridge leading to the town. Washington pushed on, destroying the\r\nbridges as he went. His men were nearly exhausted when at last they\r\nreached camp at Morristown, where Washington established headquarters,\r\nso he could guard the road between New York and Philadelphia, and keep\r\nCornwallis shut up in New Brunswick and Amboy (New Jersey).\r\n\r\nCongress thanked Washington, and great soldiers all over the world\r\npraised him for the wonderful way in which he had led his soldiers out\r\nof the enemy's pitfalls and turned defeat to victory. Many colonists,\r\nwho had seen no hope of success, now believed that Washington's\r\ngeneralship would triumph. Congress gave him full military authority and\r\nhe issued a proclamation, ordering all who were loyal to the King to go\r\nto the British camp and all others to take the oath of allegiance to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     RECAPTURE OF FORT TICONDEROGA BY GEN. BURGOYNE--BATTLE OF\r\n     BRANDYWINE--BATTLE OF GERMANTOWN--BURGOYNE'S SURRENDER AT\r\n     SARATOGA--WASHINGTON AT VALLEY FORGE--ALLIANCE WITH\r\n     FRANCE--1777-1778\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis de La Fayette]\r\n\r\nThe fame of the American cause reached Europe and many foreign officers\r\ncame over, asking to be allowed to give their help. Among them was\r\nThaddeus Kosciusko, a military engineer from Warsaw (Poland). Washington\r\nasked him, \"Why do you come?\" \"To fight for American Independence,\" he\r\nsaid. \"What can you do?\" asked General Washington. \"Try me!\" was the\r\nbrief reply. Washington \"tried him,\" and he proved a valuable help\r\nthroughout the Revolution. Another who volunteered his services was\r\nWashington's devoted friend, the young French nobleman, the Marquis de\r\nLafayette. Though scarcely twenty years of age, Lafayette loved human\r\nliberty more than home and friends and the easy life of the French\r\ncourt, and at his own expense, he fitted out a ship, loaded with\r\nmilitary stores, and sought to aid the Americans in their struggle.\r\nWashington loved him for his fine spirit, charming manner and soldierly\r\nbearing. He became a member of the Commander's family and his name is\r\nhonored by every American.\r\n\r\nThe year 1777 was a very hard and trying one. Washington's forces were\r\ntoo weak to fight regular battles with the British. He used every device\r\nto make General Howe think he had a strong army, and at the same time,\r\ntried to convince Congress that he could not act for want of men and\r\nsupplies. The British kept him guessing about what they would do next.\r\nWould they attack Philadelphia or the fort on Lake Champlain? He did not\r\ndare to withdraw troops from either place to strengthen the other.\r\n\r\nGeneral John Burgoyne, one of Howe's lieutenant-generals, arrived from\r\nEngland in the summer of 1777. He landed at Quebec and marched with\r\neight thousand men, British, Germans and Indians, to Fort Ticonderoga.\r\nThe garrison of thirty-five hundred men surrendered. Valuable stores\r\nwere taken and the presence of this new army discouraged the Americans.\r\nBut Washington only said, \"We should never despair. If new difficulties\r\narise, we must only put forth new exertions.\" He could not leave his own\r\nposition, but he showed the greatest wisdom in arranging and locating\r\nthe forces in the North. He sent his valued Virginia riflemen, under\r\nColonel Daniel Morgan, to help fight Burgoyne's Indians.\r\n\r\nFor months, Washington had watched the British fleet in New York harbor\r\nand now it put to sea with eighteen thousand men on board. Would it go\r\nto Boston or to Philadelphia? Washington led his army toward\r\nPhiladelphia, believing this would be the British point of attack, and\r\nsoon after, the fleet appeared while Washington was camped at\r\nGermantown, near Philadelphia. The fleet sailed away, however, without\r\nmaking an attack and the summer passed in marching troops here and\r\nthere--calling them out and sending them home again. Washington had a\r\nbusy time watching Burgoyne on the Hudson and the lakes, watching Howe,\r\nwho was occupying New York and New Jersey, and guarding the coast.\r\n\r\nThe fleet finally disappeared and, after a council of war, the American\r\nofficers decided to leave Philadelphia and all march north together to\r\nattack the British forces in New York. This was such an important move\r\nthat a letter was sent to Congress asking permission. The messenger who\r\ncarried the letter was Alexander Hamilton, a mere youth, though he was\r\ncaptain of artillery. He was very small but so brave that they called\r\nhim \"the little lion\" and Washington addressed him affectionately as \"my\r\nboy.\" Congress approved of the plan to attack New York and the army was\r\nabout to march, when it was reported that the British fleet was sailing\r\nup the Chesapeake Bay. Washington's army halted near Philadelphia. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief knew that there were people in Philadelphia who did\r\nnot favor the cause of American freedom, thinking it foolish for the\r\npoorly equipped Continental troops to fight the British. To encourage\r\nthe people of Philadelphia, Washington decided to parade the army\r\nthrough the city. He rode at the head with his staff. The men were\r\npoorly clad and had no uniforms, but their guns were bright and they\r\ncarried them well. They made a brave showing and after the parade,\r\nmarched into camp on the Brandywine Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington and Alexander Hamilton]\r\n\r\nThe British landed at Elkton, Maryland--about fifty miles from\r\nPhiladelphia. Washington sent troops of light horse to ride about the\r\ncountry and annoy them in every way possible. One young commander, Henry\r\nLee, of Virginia, was so daring that they called him \"Light Horse\r\nHarry.\" He was another of the brave young officers whom Washington\r\nloved to have about him and who helped him overcome the difficulties\r\nthat beset him at every turn. Washington spent most of his time in the\r\nsaddle, watching the march of the British. His troops were unequal to\r\nthe enemy in every way, and though the war had lasted more than two\r\nyears, he had never dared to risk a real battle. The time had come when\r\nhe must make a stand in the open or acknowledge to the world the\r\nweakness of his army. He had about eleven thousand men, while the\r\nBritish numbered about eighteen thousand. He appealed to his soldiers to\r\ndo their best and make a firm stand in defense of their national capital\r\n(Philadelphia). The battle of the Brandywine was fought on September 11,\r\n1777, and the Americans were badly defeated. Following this, Congress\r\nmoved to Lancaster (Pa.) and the British, under Cornwallis, took\r\npossession of Philadelphia, which they entered dressed in their bright\r\nscarlet uniforms, the bands playing \"God Save the King.\" What a contrast\r\nto the ragged Continentals who had marched there a few weeks before!\r\n\r\nWashington did not despair. His courage and determination grew stronger\r\nin the face of defeat and he firmly believed his fortunes would take a\r\nturn. After resting his troops, he made a surprise attack on General\r\nHowe at Germantown. He was in a fair way to success, when a heavy fog\r\ncame on. The Americans could not tell their own soldiers apart from the\r\nenemy and a panic took place. But Washington, who was in the hottest of\r\nthe fight, was not discouraged even at this disaster. He had proved to\r\nthe world that his troops were not afraid of the British army, and his\r\nmen, in spite of their losses, were encouraged by this encounter with\r\ntrained European soldiers. The English had looked down on the American\r\npatriots, but they were now beginning to find them worthy foes.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the army in the North had been busy. General Burgoyne\r\nhad sent a force to Bennington, Vermont, to seize cattle and supplies,\r\nbut General John Stark, at the head of the New England militia,\r\ncompletely routed them. He captured a quantity of guns and ammunition\r\nand hundreds of prisoners. At the same time, west of the Hudson, another\r\nbody of British was defeated and their tents and stores taken by the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nThis was joyful news to Washington, and these victories served to keep\r\nup the spirits of the patriots and also to disgust the Indians with\r\ntheir British commanders. The militia, too, gained confidence,\r\novercoming their fears and finding they were a match for the British and\r\nthe Germans. Recruits flocked to the American camp in the North and\r\nBurgoyne was soon surrounded. In the great battle near Saratoga (N. Y.),\r\nhe was completely defeated and surrendered to General Horatio Gates on\r\nOctober 17, 1777.\r\n\r\nThis splendid victory gave the Americans large quantities of military\r\nstores, but most of all, it gave them confidence, for they had at last\r\nbeaten the British forces. The experience of actual warfare and the\r\nexample of the trained soldiers had taught them how to fight. One of\r\nBurgoyne's officers said that when the Continental troops were drawn up\r\nto receive the surrender, they stood like soldiers, though dressed as\r\nif they had come from the farm or the shop. He was surprised to see how\r\nstraight and strong and fine they were! General Gates ordered his men\r\nnot to cheer or show any desire to humiliate their beaten foes, and this\r\ncourtesy tendered him by General Gates was reported to Parliament by\r\nGeneral Burgoyne when he returned to England. He was especially touched\r\nby it because he had needlessly burned some of the beautiful homes of\r\nthe very officers who were so gracious to him. This courtesy was very\r\nfine in Gates, but he failed in his duty to his Commander-in-Chief, and\r\nin many ways was unreliable. He did not report the victory to\r\nWashington, as was his duty, and paid no attention to his commands. He\r\ndid not send the troops to Philadelphia, as he was ordered, and he did\r\nnot even return the company of Virginia riflemen until it was too late.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates and his friends were doing all in their power to destroy\r\nthe good name and the authority of Washington. They kept back troops\r\nWashington needed and then criticized him for not fighting a decisive\r\nbattle. But Washington endured their fault-finding in silence, for he\r\nknew that an open battle with such a powerful foe meant certain defeat,\r\nand patriotism so filled his heart that it left no room for selfish\r\nambition. He was not seeking personal glory, but independence for\r\nAmerica. If General Howe had attacked him, he would have fought bravely,\r\nbut he and his fellow officers knew it was unwise to attack the British.\r\nIn many skirmishes, however, his troops showed courage and\r\nsteadfastness, and proved they were making progress in the arts of\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nA few months before this, Congress had made some changes in the\r\nquartermaster (the officer who attends to supplies) and in the\r\ncommissary (food) departments, although Washington had opposed the\r\nchanges. The result was a bad mix-up in getting supplies to the army,\r\nand food and clothing spoiled and went to waste for want of wagons to\r\ncarry them to the camp.\r\n\r\nWinter set in, and the troops were poorly clad and worn out from\r\nhardships. There were not enough blankets to go around, and many of the\r\nmen were obliged to sit by the camp fires all night and thus got very\r\nlittle rest. Washington decided to go into winter quarters in the\r\nvillage of Valley Forge, about twenty miles from Philadelphia. From\r\nhere, he could watch General Howe's movements and be ready, if\r\nnecessary, to defend Congress, which now met at York. On the march to\r\nValley Forge, many of the soldiers were barefooted and they left a trail\r\nof blood on the frozen ground. To add to their suffering, someone\r\nblundered, and they were several days without food. Washington was\r\nblamed for going into winter quarters and not driving the enemy out of\r\nPhiladelphia. He wrote to Congress, giving a full account of how he had\r\nbeen annoyed and hindered by those who should have helped him. He told\r\nthem that nearly three thousand of his men were unfit for duty because\r\nthey were almost naked, and two thousand more were sick for want of food\r\nand shelter.\r\n\r\nDuring this cruel winter of 1777-1778, many men froze and starved to\r\ndeath in camp and hundreds of horses were lost. Washington, who was\r\nalways careful about other people's property, was sometimes obliged to\r\nlet his men seize food from the farmers. Congress did not stand by him.\r\nSome of the members were jealous of his power and his influence. General\r\nGates was the popular hero after the victory of Saratoga, and a plot\r\nhatched by officers and members of Congress almost succeeded in putting\r\nhim in Washington's place. Though Washington's plan had made the defeat\r\nof General Burgoyne possible, Gates claimed all the credit. Washington\r\nbore all this fault-finding and unfairness with patient courage. He kept\r\nhis temper and devoted himself to his suffering men, whose endurance\r\ntouched his heart. Fortunately for America, the conspiracy against\r\nWashington failed and the only result was to make his name and fame\r\nbrighter and more widespread.\r\n\r\nWhile the Americans in camp at Valley Forge were so miserable, the\r\nBritish, twenty miles away, were spending a gay winter in the homes of\r\nthe people of Philadelphia. Why they did not attack and destroy the\r\nwretched patriot army was a mystery. After awhile, provisions and other\r\nnecessities were secured and the camp became more cheerful. Mrs.\r\nWashington and the wives of some of the other officers came to join\r\ntheir husbands.\r\n\r\nBaron Frederick von Steuben, a German officer, who had served in several\r\nwars and received great honors, was sent to America by friends in Paris.\r\nHe offered to fight for the colonists without rank or pay. Congress\r\nsent him to Washington, who realized that his experience would be\r\nvaluable, and who asked him to drill and discipline the troops. Steuben\r\nwas a wonderful soldier and after a few weeks under his direction, the\r\narmy learned something of real military tactics, and how to work\r\ntogether like a great machine. He not only drilled them, but looked\r\nafter their comforts and won their love by his kindness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benjamin Franklin was at the French Court]\r\n\r\nNot all the work for freedom was done on the battle-fields and in the\r\ncamps. While Washington and his soldiers were skirmishing with the\r\nBritish and while they were encamped at Valley Forge, Benjamin Franklin,\r\none of the foremost thinkers and statesmen of the time, was in Europe\r\nmaking friends for the American cause and asking help for the struggling\r\ncolonists. The King of France made a treaty of alliance with him, which\r\nCongress signed May 4th, 1778. Three days later, it was celebrated in\r\ncamp with thanksgiving and parades, and the news that France was to help\r\nthe American cause thrilled every patriot's heart with joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n     BATTLE OF MONMOUTH--PATRIOTS RECEIVE AID FROM FRANCE--RECAPTURE OF\r\n     FORT AT STONY POINT BY GEN. ANTHONY WAYNE--WASHINGTON AT\r\n     MORRISTOWN--SURRENDER OF CHARLESTON, S. C., TO THE BRITISH--TREASON\r\n     OF BENEDICT ARNOLD--1778-1780\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Molly Pitcher]\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe had spent a pleasant winter and spring holding\r\nPhiladelphia, but he had done nothing in the way of military service. He\r\nwas now ordered home and Sir Henry Clinton took his place and was told\r\nto leave the city. While Washington was in doubt as to what move\r\nClinton would make, messengers came from England with offers of peace\r\nfor the colonies. They offered a large bribe to General Joseph Reed, a\r\nmember of Congress. His scornful answer was, \"I am not worth purchasing,\r\nbut such as I am, the King of Great Britain is not rich enough to do\r\nit!\" This was the spirit that won freedom for America.\r\n\r\nIn June (1778), General Clinton withdrew his army from Philadelphia and\r\nWashington marched his troops out of Valley Forge and followed him. Near\r\nMonmouth, New Jersey, Washington decided to make an attack. He sent\r\nGeneral Charles Lee (who, by this time, had been released by the\r\nBritish) with six thousand men to start the battle, while he brought up\r\nthe main division. General Lee, who never would take orders from\r\nWashington, commanded his men to retreat. Immediately Washington heard\r\nof this disobedience, he galloped forward, sternly ordered Lee to the\r\nrear, and with hot words rallied the men, stopped the retreat and saved\r\nthe day. His presence and the courage he displayed ended the disorder\r\nand put new life into the men. An officer, who saw him at the time, said\r\nhis anger was splendid and he \"swore like an angel from heaven.\"\r\n\r\nWashington spent the night upon the field, his head pillowed on the\r\nroots of a tree. At daybreak he arose to renew the attack, but the enemy\r\nhad learned one of his own tricks and, as Washington himself put it,\r\n\"had stolen off in the night as silent as the grave.\" It was at this\r\nbattle of Monmouth that Molly Pitcher became a heroine. She had been\r\ncarrying water to the men in action. At one gun, six men had been\r\nkilled, the last one her husband. As he fell, she seized the ramrod from\r\nhis hand and took his place. Washington was proud of her courage and\r\ngave her the rank and pay of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe love and respect in which the army held Washington were increased by\r\nhis magnificent daring and splendid generalship in this battle. Congress\r\nthanked him \"for his great good conduct.\" General Charles Lee, who had\r\nalways been disrespectful to Washington and who had tried his best to\r\nharm him, was court-martialed for insubordination (disobedience) and\r\ndeprived of his command. (Charles Lee was not connected with the Lees of\r\nVirginia.) General Lee was really a brilliant soldier, but he was ruined\r\nby his own jealous disposition. Washington treated him and all other\r\nenemies with the kindness of a great mind and a true heart.\r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of Monmouth, Clinton took up his quarters in New York\r\nand Washington remained in New Jersey. Soon he received word that the\r\nFrench King had sent a fleet of eighteen ships and four thousand\r\nsoldiers to help the colonists. The Americans were very glad of this,\r\nthinking that the British fleet would now be destroyed; but the attack\r\nof the French (August, 1778) was unsuccessful and they sailed away\r\nwithout having done much good.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken several times of the Tories who sided with the British.\r\nWhen the war broke out, the patriot settlers in the Wyoming Valley,\r\nPennsylvania, decided they would join in the defense of the country and\r\nthey drove all the Tories out of the Valley. Just after the Battle of\r\nMonmouth (June 28, 1778), while all the fighting men were away, these\r\nTories got together seven hundred Indians and attacked the women and\r\nchildren. Before Washington could send aid, the whole Valley was laid\r\nwaste. All the homes were burned. Hundreds were killed by the Indians\r\nand many more died trying to reach places of safety. This was followed\r\nby night attacks in different places, when sentinels were surprised and\r\nmurdered by Indians and Tories. Indeed, all through the war, the most\r\ncruel enemies the patriots had were their Tory neighbors.\r\n\r\nTo guard against such attacks, and to be ready to meet the British at\r\nany point, Washington distributed his troops in a long line of camps and\r\ngot ready to defend the country from Boston to Philadelphia. The Hudson\r\nRiver was guarded by a fortress at West Point. In order to call the\r\nmilitia out, he arranged a system of signals. On a high hill overlooking\r\nthe British camp, sentries kept constant watch. If the enemy moved,\r\nwarning was to be given by firing a big gun. When the gun boomed, fires\r\nwere to be lighted on the hills within hearing. As soon as these were\r\nseen from more distant hills, other fires were to be lighted, until\r\nevery hilltop blazed and all the countryside was roused and men warned\r\nto hurry to their rallying places.\r\n\r\nThough General Clinton had a great army, he did not offer battle. He\r\ncarried on an annoying form of warfare by sending out small bodies of\r\nmen to distant places, to attack and destroy. In this way he plundered\r\nand burned villages on the shores of the Chesapeake and in New England\r\nand captured valuable stores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne]\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening, Washington planned to recapture the\r\nfort at Stony Point on the Hudson, which had been taken by Sir Henry\r\nClinton, May 31, 1779. His plan was entrusted to General Wayne, called\r\n\"Mad Anthony\" Wayne because of his dashing bravery. Wayne took a small\r\nbody of light-armed, fearless men, marched through the mountains and at\r\nmidnight on July 16, stormed the fort and captured it. This feat was so\r\nwell done that it is considered one of the great events of the war.\r\nCongress thanked Washington for the victory and gave Wayne a medal for\r\nhis courage and success.\r\n\r\nThe swift and daring young scout, \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, was with this\r\nexpedition. After it was over, he asked permission to lead an attack on\r\nthe garrison of Paulus Hook (now Jersey City), right under the guns of\r\nNew York. Washington, who always admired courageous deeds, allowed him\r\nto make the attempt. Lee surprised the fort at night, captured a number\r\nof prisoners and made a successful retreat while the guns from the\r\nbattleships were sounding the alarm. These two daring attacks increased\r\nthe confidence and spirit of the Americans and gave the British more\r\nrespect for them. Still, it was tiresome for the troops to remain month\r\nafter month in camp, wondering what the enemy would do next.\r\n\r\nWashington had more serious troubles. Congress was slow and often unwise\r\nin its acts. The people grew tired of the war, because business was\r\nsuffering and the farms were neglected, and nothing seemed to be gained\r\nby it. Officers resigned from the army and men deserted. Washington was\r\nlaughed at by the Tories and criticized by his friends. But he was\r\npatient and said, \"We must not despair! The game is yet in our hands; to\r\nplay it well is all we have to do.\"\r\n\r\nWashington's greatness is shown not only by his skill in action, but by\r\nthe patience with which he could wait. He simply would not be\r\ndiscouraged. Under such trials, he became \"the best among the great.\"\r\n\r\nThe winter came and Washington took part of his army into a camp of log\r\nhuts at Morristown, New Jersey. The sad story of Valley Forge was\r\nrepeated here and the winter (1779-1780) was the coldest ever known in\r\nthe colonies.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, there was, of course, no American money.\r\nCongress had put out some paper money called \"Continental Currency,\" but\r\nit was worth so little that it took a great deal of it to buy anything.\r\nWashington was obliged to ask the states to give the army grain and\r\ncattle. New Jersey, where a part of the army was stationed, was very\r\ngenerous and the women knitted socks and made clothes for the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe British went on surprising and killing small garrisons and\r\nplundering the country. In December, 1779, General Clinton sailed, with\r\nGeneral Cornwallis and a strong army, to attack Charleston, South\r\nCarolina. They landed at Savannah, Georgia, and marched overland.\r\nWashington dared not go to the help of the Southern troops and leave the\r\nHudson unguarded against the British army from Canada, which might\r\ndescend upon it. General Benjamin Lincoln and Commander Whipple were,\r\ntherefore, left alone to defend Charleston, which they did bravely,\r\nthough it was bombarded on all sides by the British. They held out until\r\ntheir guns were destroyed and their provisions gone. The people were\r\nfrightened into submission and on May 12, 1780, the city of Charleston\r\nsurrendered, and Lincoln and his army became prisoners of war.\r\nConsidering South Carolina conquered, General Clinton went back to New\r\nYork, leaving Lord Cornwallis in command, with orders to subdue North\r\nCarolina and Virginia.\r\n\r\nAfter their success in the South, the British made an attempt to capture\r\nWashington's headquarters at Morristown. The patriots of New Jersey\r\nrallied to the help of the army and drove off the British, who withdrew,\r\nburning houses and killing people as they went. Soon after this, the\r\nAmericans were encouraged by the arrival (July 10, 1780) of a large\r\nFrench force under Count de Rochambeau (ro-sham-bo), who came to help\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year (January, 1780), Washington had had the unpleasant\r\nduty laid upon him by Congress of rebuking General Benedict Arnold, who,\r\nthough he was very brave and fought gallantly, had been guilty of\r\nseveral unwise acts. Washington greatly admired General Arnold and made\r\nhis reproof so gentle that it was almost a compliment. But being called\r\nto account at all was more than Arnold could bear. He felt hurt, too,\r\nthat Congress had promoted others and had only blame for him. This so\r\nenraged him that he proved false to the trust Washington had placed in\r\nhim and false to his country.\r\n\r\nAfter his rebuke, feeling that he had been treated unfairly, Arnold\r\nbegan writing letters to Major John Andre, a popular young British\r\nofficer, in which he offered to betray the fortress of the Hudson. At\r\nArnold's own request, Washington gave him command of West Point and an\r\nimportant part in a plan to attack the British with the help of the\r\nFrench. Washington had gone to consult with the French commander in\r\nNewport (R. I.), when Major Andre and General Arnold met. At dead of\r\nnight, September 21, 1780, they went to a house in the forest to make\r\narrangements for the betrayal of West Point. With letters and plans of\r\nthe fort hidden in his boots, Major Andre rode back alone to New York.\r\nHe was caught and searched by three young farmers, who were guarding\r\ntheir cattle against the outlaws who overran the neighborhood. They\r\nfound the letters and knew he was a spy. Andre begged them to release\r\nhim and made them all kinds of offers if they would, but they marched\r\nhim off ten miles to the nearest fort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Messenger came to Benedict Arnold]\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington came back from Newport two days earlier than he was\r\nexpected. Lafayette, Count Rochambeau and Hamilton rode with him and\r\nthey planned to go at once to West Point. Arnold was living with his\r\nfamily in a house several miles from the fort and Washington sent word\r\nthey would have breakfast with him. This was the very day for the fort\r\nto be given up and the sudden return of Washington frightened Arnold.\r\nJust before his guests arrived, a messenger brought word of Andre's\r\ncapture. Hastily bidding his wife good-by, he flung himself on his horse\r\nand galloped away. After breakfast, Washington went on with Rochambeau\r\nto the fort. No salute welcomed them. General Arnold was not there and\r\napparently they were not expected. While wondering at his absence,\r\nWashington had no thought of treachery. Then Hamilton brought him the\r\ndreadful news. \"Whom can we trust now?\" was all he said. Hamilton rode\r\nhard after Arnold, but he escaped to the British ship which was lying in\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nMajor Andre endeared himself to everybody by his charming manners,\r\nintelligence and bravery. The young officers loved him and the British\r\nmade every effort to save him, but honorably refused to give up General\r\nArnold in exchange for him. Washington treated Andre with the greatest\r\nkindness, but justice to America required that this fine young officer\r\nshould die and he suffered the shameful death of a spy (October 2,\r\n1780). His body was later sent to England and he was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey. General Arnold was made an officer in the British\r\narmy, but nobody trusted him, and the men hated his command. Twenty\r\nyears afterward (1801), he died, poor and broken-hearted, in a foreign\r\nland. It is said that, on his death-bed, he called for his old American\r\nuniform and asked to be allowed to die in it. \"God forgive me,\" he\r\ncried, \"for ever putting on another!\"\r\n\r\nCount Rochambeau had told a pretty story about his journey from Newport\r\nwith General Washington. One evening, as they passed through a large\r\ntown, the people came out to greet their General. Throngs of children\r\ncarrying torches crowded about him, touching his hands and calling him\r\n\"Father.\" He was very kind and gentle to all these people, but the\r\npatriotism of the children pleased him most. He said Great Britain\r\ncould never conquer a country whose children were taught to be loyal.\r\n\r\nAnother French officer said of Washington's horses, \"They are as good as\r\nthey are beautiful, and all perfectly trained. He trains them all\r\nhimself. He leaps the highest barriers and rides very fast.\" At one\r\ntime, early in the war, when the Virginia riflemen first came north,\r\nsome Marblehead (Mass.) fishermen laughed at their fringed hunting\r\nshirts and a fight followed. Washington heard of it, jumped on his horse\r\nand galloped into camp. His colored servant was going to let down some\r\nbars for him, but he leaped over them and dashed into the midst of the\r\nfight. He seized the two biggest riflemen and shook them, commanding\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nWashington, as usual, was prevented, through lack of men and supplies,\r\nfrom giving the British a blow. Months passed without much being done,\r\nexcept dashing skirmishes now and then. The two camps watched each\r\nother, wondering what the other would do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     GENERAL GATES DEFEATED AT CAMDEN, S. C.--BATTLE OF KING'S\r\n     MOUNTAIN--WASHINGTON SENDS AID TO THE SOUTH--SIEGE OF\r\n     YORKTOWN--SURRENDER OF LORD CORNWALLIS--PEACE TREATY\r\n     SIGNED--WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL TO HIS OFFICERS--1780-1783\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThough Washington did not have any encounters with the British for a\r\nlong time, the Americans were engaged in bitter fighting in the South.\r\nLord Cornwallis angered the people of South Carolina by hanging a number\r\nof prisoners at Charleston and by the cruel raids of General Tarleton\r\nand his dragoons, who rode about the country, slaying innocent people.\r\nGeneral Thomas Sumter, who was nicknamed the \"Game Cock,\" gathered\r\ntogether a few men. Those who had no guns sharpened their saws into\r\nswords and fastened hunting knives on long poles and thus armed, these\r\nsoldiers gave the British a great deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Lincoln was still held a prisoner of war and the\r\npeople were very glad when they heard that General Gates, the hero of\r\nSaratoga, had been sent to take command of the Southern forces of the\r\nAmerican army. Gates was very headstrong, however, and thought he knew\r\nmore than any one could tell him and would take no advice from officers\r\non the ground. He did the worst thing he could do--he rushed at once\r\ninto an open battle with Lord Cornwallis (August 16, 1780) and met with\r\na terrible defeat at Camden, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nCornwallis now marched into North Carolina to subdue that State. Her\r\nScotch-Irish people, always brave, had declared themselves independent\r\nof Great Britain a whole year before Congress had dared to do so.\r\nCornwallis found himself in a \"hornets' nest.\" Sharp-shooters and bold\r\nriders cut off his messengers and foraging parties. In the western part,\r\nthe mountain people gathered, who were used to Indian fighting. They\r\nwere joined by rugged men from all parts of the South. Each man was\r\ndressed in homespun, with a deer's tail or bit of green stuck in his\r\nhat. Each carried a long rifle, hunting knife, knapsack and blanket. At\r\nKing's Mountain (on the border line between North and South Carolina),\r\nthis little army overtook and destroyed a British and Tory force under\r\nGeneral Ferguson. Soon after, Lord Cornwallis retreated to South\r\nCarolina again.\r\n\r\nThe victory at King's Mountain aroused all the patriotism of the\r\nmountain folk. Francis Marion, one of the bravest soldiers of the South,\r\ntook the field with a brigade of friends and neighbors. Armed with\r\nknives and rude swords, he, like Sumter, would surprise and capture\r\nBritish posts and then gallop back to the woods, while the enemy would\r\nbe at a loss to know where he came from. The British called him the\r\n\"Swamp Fox.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Colonel William Washington, a kinsman of the General,\r\nwith a few horsemen, surprised a body of Tories who had made their\r\nheadquarters in a log barn. He put the trunk of a tree on two wagon\r\nwheels, painted it to look like a cannon, and pointed it at the barn.\r\nThen he sent a messenger with a white flag of truce to tell them to\r\nsurrender or be blown to pieces. Their leader and one hundred and twelve\r\nmen surrendered! They felt very foolish when they saw the cannon and\r\nwere laughed at all over the State.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates, broken-hearted over his defeat at Camden, was trying to\r\ngather up his scattered army. To add to his sorrow, he received word\r\nthat his only son was dead, and soon after, he was notified that\r\nCongress had given his command to General Greene and ordered an\r\ninvestigation of his defeat. These troubles were almost more than he\r\ncould bear, but his feelings were soothed by a letter from General\r\nWashington, full of tender sympathy and expressions of confidence. The\r\nletter so comforted him that he was found in his room kissing the words.\r\nGeneral Greene was also very considerate, and the proud heart of Gates,\r\nwho had wronged both these men, was melted, by their kindness, into\r\nlasting love for them.\r\n\r\nGeneral Greene found the army small and discouraged, but he soon\r\ninspired the men with renewed hope. He had with him the famous Virginia\r\nRifles under General Daniel Morgan, who had served bravely at Quebec and\r\nSaratoga. This division was attacked at Cowpens (S. C.) January 17,\r\n1781, by Tarleton and his large force, but Morgan was so daring and\r\nskillful that he routed the British, who lost 800 of their 1100 men.\r\n\r\nCornwallis tried to attack General Greene, who knew his army was too\r\nsmall to risk a battle; so he led Cornwallis a long chase through\r\nforests and mountains, while his light horse troops under Harry Lee\r\nannoyed the British like wasps that sting and fly away to return and\r\nsting again! Greene was at last overtaken and defeated, but the effect\r\nof the battle so crippled the British that there was nothing for them to\r\ndo but retreat to the nearest sea-coast town, where they might get aid\r\nfrom their fleet. General Greene marched hard after them, turning his\r\ndefeat into a victory, and so hampering Cornwallis that he lost hope.\r\n\r\nCornwallis now turned northward into Virginia and Greene gave up the\r\nchase and marched into South Carolina. He, with Lee, Marion, Sumter,\r\nWade Hampton and other daring officers, fought battle after battle until\r\nthey had regained from the British most of Georgia and the Carolinas\r\n(September, 1781).\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, Lafayette and \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne kept annoying Cornwallis\r\nas he marched to Portsmouth on the James River.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Washington, while giving advice and directing the campaigns in\r\nthe South, where he had sent some of his most brilliant generals, was\r\nwatching General Clinton. Ever since the Battle of Monmouth (N. J.), he\r\nhad remained in the neighborhood of New York. Though he was needed with\r\nhis army in the South, he dared not leave the Hudson unguarded. At last,\r\nhowever, he planned to help the South by causing the British to recall\r\nsome of their troops. He had the French forces come and encamp near his\r\narmy, and appear to be making arrangements for laying siege to New York.\r\nEven the soldiers thought they were going to try to take the city.\r\nGeneral Clinton fell into the trap and wrote to Cornwallis for all the\r\nregiments he could spare. Troops were hurried aboard ship and set sail\r\nfor New York.\r\n\r\nClinton found out, too late, how completely he had been deceived, for\r\nWashington and Rochambeau slipped out of their camps and marched their\r\narmies across New Jersey! He took his revenge by sending Benedict\r\nArnold, who was now a British officer, to his native State, Connecticut,\r\nto plunder and lay waste the country and murder the garrisons. This\r\nbrutality was Arnold's last act in America, and shortly after, he went\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nWhen the French and Continental armies reached Philadelphia, they were\r\nreceived with rejoicing. Washington was entertained in the home of\r\nRobert Morris, a patriot banker, without whose help, in raising money,\r\nWashington could not have saved the country and who more than once had\r\ncome to the aid of the army. At this time, he loaned the government\r\n$20,000 in gold, and at about the same time, France sent the colonists\r\nmore than a million dollars in coin.\r\n\r\nThe Continental army paraded through Philadelphia (August 30, 1781),\r\ndusty and ragged, but keeping step to the fife and drum. The next day,\r\nthe French troops marched through, jaunty in white and green uniforms,\r\nwith bands playing. Lafayette, who was in Virginia, sent word to\r\nWashington that the British troops had landed at Yorktown (instead of\r\ngoing to New York), and that Cornwallis was strongly fortified there.\r\nThe British battleships lay in the river before the town. Cornwallis\r\nthought his only enemy was Lafayette, of whom he had little fear.\r\nLafayette carefully arranged his troops to cut off any retreat from\r\nYorktown, and waited for Washington. A powerful French fleet arrived\r\nfrom France and bottled up Cornwallis in the York River. The American\r\nand French armies marched on from Philadelphia, Washington taking time\r\non the way to visit Mount Vernon, which he had not seen for six years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington spent the first night under a mulberry tree]\r\n\r\nCornwallis felt very safe and snug in Yorktown (Va.) till he saw the\r\nFrench ships, and then he decided to retreat. But every way was\r\nblocked. The allied armies (American and French) entrenched themselves\r\nclose about the town. Washington spent the first night among his men\r\nsleeping under a mulberry tree. On the night of October 6th (1781), the\r\nsiege of Yorktown began, Washington himself putting the match to the\r\nfirst gun. A week later, two strong British redoubts (forts) were\r\nstormed and taken, one by an American company under Colonel Hamilton and\r\nthe other by the French. The British kept up a constant bombardment of\r\nthe American lines, and Washington was often in the greatest peril. On\r\none occasion, an officer spoke of his danger and Washington said, \"If\r\nyou think so, you are at liberty to step back.\" He was never afraid and\r\nwhat the Indian had said of him years ago seemed indeed true.--\"A mighty\r\nPower protected him and he could not die in battle!\"\r\n\r\nThe Americans pounded the British fortifications to pieces. Cornwallis\r\nlooked in vain for help from New York. He was surrounded on all sides\r\nand all hope of escape was gone. On the 19th of October, 1781, in order\r\nnot to sacrifice the lives of any more of his brave men, Lord Cornwallis\r\nsurrendered to General Washington. The whole country went wild with joy\r\nover this great victory, and the Americans did not forget that the\r\nFrench, with their men, money and ships, made it possible for them to\r\nwin. The troops held services of thanksgiving in camp, and Congress\r\nnamed a day when all the people should thank God. When Cornwallis\r\nsurrendered, Washington treated the British with great kindness and\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe English were now having so much trouble in Europe that it was\r\ndifficult for them to carry on the war in America; but they were not\r\nwilling to make peace on terms that America would accept. Washington\r\nthought that the only way to secure a glorious and lasting peace was to\r\nbe prepared to carry on the war. If the British should see the colonists\r\nweak and unprepared, they would either conquer them or offer them an\r\ninglorious peace. He, therefore, fortified his forces at Newburgh on the\r\nHudson, where they were joined by the French.\r\n\r\nThe entire year 1782 was spent in camp. The men soon became\r\ndiscontented. Congress and the States were slow, as usual, in furnishing\r\nsupplies. But Washington's patience and fair dealing kept the men loyal\r\nto him and the country.\r\n\r\nThe first articles of peace were signed in France, November 30, 1782,\r\nbut it was not until September 3, 1783, that the final treaty of peace\r\nwith England was signed at Paris.\r\n\r\nOn April 19th (1783), just eight years after the Battle of Lexington,\r\nWashington proclaimed to his troops that the war was over; but the\r\nBritish did not leave New York until November, and then Washington and\r\nthe Governor marched in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Betsy Ross]\r\n\r\nOn December 4, at Fraunce's Tavern, New York City, he said good-by to\r\nthe officers and men who had served and suffered so long with him; there\r\nwere tears in his eyes and theirs, as he shook their hands and bade them\r\nfarewell. A ship carried him to Annapolis, Maryland, where he\r\nsurrendered his commission to Congress. He said, \"I close this last act\r\nof my official life by commending the interests of our dearest country\r\nto the protection of Almighty God and those who have the superintendence\r\nof them to His holy keeping.\" He sheathed his sword after years of\r\nfaithful and honorable service. Through good and evil fortunes, he had\r\nalways held firmly to ideals of truth, courage and patriotism, and he\r\nretired from public life admired and loved by his countrymen. He arrived\r\nat Mount Vernon on Christmas eve (1783).\r\n\r\nThe United States now had a place among the nations of the world. She\r\nhad a flag of her own, the beautiful Stars and Stripes, created in the\r\ndark days of the war. For a hundred and fifty years, the colonies had\r\nused the flag of Great Britain. When the Revolution broke out, each\r\nState and regiment had its own flag; but in 1777, Congress appointed\r\nWashington, Robert Morris and Colonel Ross a committee to devise a flag.\r\nThey were in Philadelphia at the time, and it was in the house of Betsy\r\nRoss (which still stands) that the first American flag was made,\r\nconsisting of thirteen red and white stripes, with a circle of thirteen\r\nwhite stars on a blue field, \"representing a new constellation.\" (A\r\ngroup of fixed stars.) This flag was accepted by Congress on June 14,\r\nthe day that is now celebrated in the United States as Flag Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON RETIRES TO MOUNT VERNON--INAUGURATED AS FIRST PRESIDENT\r\n     OF THE UNITED STATES--HIS REELECTION--HIS DEATH AT MOUNT\r\n     VERNON--1783-1799\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dome of the Capitol at Washington]\r\n\r\nThere are many things to be remembered about the Revolution. Its objects\r\nwere to gain liberty, equality and a fair chance for everybody. It was\r\nwon by the patience and courage of patriots, ill-fed, ill-clad and\r\nill-paid. Its armies were too weak for the glory of many great battles.\r\nYears afterward, Lafayette said to Napoleon, \"It was the grandest of\r\ncauses, won by the skirmishes of sentinels and outposts.\"\r\n\r\nWashington laid aside his sword and spent five happy years at Mount\r\nVernon. He was a brave soldier, but he loved best the quiet life of the\r\nfarm. He once said, \"How pitiful is the ambition which desolates the\r\nworld with fire and sword for the purpose of conquest and fame, compared\r\nto making our neighbors and fellowmen happy!\"\r\n\r\nHis home was filled with guests whom he loved to entertain and who were\r\nalways sure of a courteous and dignified welcome. The two little\r\nchildren of Mrs. Washington's son (who had died of fever during the\r\nwar), Nelly and George, made the place merry and the General joined in\r\ntheir play and enjoyed the change from camp to home life. Those who were\r\nwith him constantly say that he never spoke of himself and never\r\nreferred to any of his battles. He had done his work and done it well.\r\nNow he left it behind him and looked forward to the joy of his home. At\r\nthe close of the war, some of his friends had wanted to make him king,\r\nbut he would not hear of it. He had fought to make America a free land,\r\nand not for his own glory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington spent five happy years at Mount Vernon]\r\n\r\nThe thirteen States were loosely bound together in a Confederation. As\r\ntime went on, the rights of different States came into conflict.\r\nWashington, from his fireside, watched the interests of his country. He\r\nbelieved with other great Americans that only a strong central\r\ngovernment could keep harmony among the States. In 1787, a convention\r\nwas called in Philadelphia to talk the matter over. Each State sent its\r\nmost brilliant and thoughtful men, among them, of course, being\r\nWashington. After four months of careful consideration and labor, they\r\noffered to the American people the glorious Constitution, upon which has\r\nbeen built up the great Republic of the United States. Washington said\r\nthey had God's help in \"laying the foundation for tranquillity and\r\nhappiness.\" The people accepted the Constitution and turned to\r\nWashington for their first President. No one else was thought of, and he\r\nwas unanimously elected. New York was chosen for the capital.\r\n\r\nBefore he left Virginia, Washington went to say farewell to his mother,\r\nknowing he would never see her again. She was old and feeble, but happy\r\nto see her son so useful and so honored. She always said, \"He is a good\r\nson and has done his duty as a man.\"\r\n\r\nAs Washington journeyed to New York, people thronged the roadsides.\r\nBells rang and cannon roared. Soldiers and citizens escorted him from\r\ncity to city. At the lower end of New York Bay, he was received on a\r\nsplendid barge, which led a procession of boats gay with flags and\r\nmusic. At the pier, he was met by the Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 1789, Washington took the oath of office on the open\r\nbalcony of Federal Hall, in Wall Street, in the presence of a great\r\nmultitude. Then he walked to St. Paul's church and devoutly kneeling,\r\nprayed to God for strength and guidance.\r\n\r\nWashington had need to pray, for he was facing difficulties and problems\r\ngreater than any he had known. He was at the head of a government, such\r\nas had never been tried before, and the eyes of the world were upon him.\r\nThe peoples of down-trodden lands looked to him for the success of\r\nfreedom. He said truly, \"I walk untrodden ground,\" for there was no\r\ngreat republic in history whose example he could follow. His heavy task\r\nwas to bring into harmony the differences of widely separate States; to\r\nmake fair laws; to create a national money; to organize the different\r\ndepartments of government--in short, to make one nation out of thirteen.\r\n\r\nWashington never flinched from responsibility. He took up his new work\r\nwith methodical patience, and was most fortunate in having the help of\r\ngreat men. The States sent their best men to Congress. John Adams was\r\nVice-President. The first Secretary of State was Thomas Jefferson, who\r\nhad written the Declaration of Independence. General Knox was made\r\nSecretary of War. The still youthful Alexander Hamilton was appointed\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; the country owes much to him for its success\r\nand prosperity, for he was the one who made the financial plans, without\r\nwhich the government could not exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Federal Hall]\r\n\r\nWashington's family joined him in New York, where they lived. The city\r\nstreets were dirty and dark at this time and only one was paved. Negro\r\nslaves carried all the water for the household from the river, in tubs\r\nbalanced on their heads, while drinking water was sold from wagons, as\r\nthere was only one pump in the city. The President traveled about in a\r\ncream-colored coach with pictures painted on the doors and panels. It\r\nwas drawn by cream-colored horses with white manes and tails. Sometimes\r\non Saturday afternoons, this coach, which was well known to all the\r\npeople, was sent to bring playmates to drive with Nelly and George.\r\n\r\nWashington drove to the first meeting of Congress in a coach drawn by\r\nsix horses, with a coachman and footman in scarlet and white liveries,\r\nand with an escort mounted on prancing white steeds. Such style really\r\nwas not uncommon in those days and the six horses were not so much for\r\nshow as they were needed to draw the heavy carriage over the bad roads.\r\nThe fear that our country might become a monarchy had not entirely\r\ndisappeared, so Washington lived as simply as he could and avoided\r\neverything that suggested the pomp of a king.\r\n\r\nThe President and Mrs. Washington often went on foot to call on their\r\nfriends, and that the people might meet them freely, they held public\r\nreceptions on Friday evenings from eight to ten. While always reserved\r\nand dignified, Washington was gracious and attentive to his guests. His\r\nwife was the same sweet hostess as at Mount Vernon. At dinner, if no\r\nchaplain was present, Washington asked the blessing himself. Sunday was\r\nalways strictly observed in the Washington household. In the morning,\r\nthe President went to church, and the rest of the day he spent quietly\r\nwith his family. In the autumn after his election, he wrote the first\r\nProclamation setting aside a Thursday in November for Thanksgiving. From\r\nthat time to this, in November of each year, America gives thanks to God\r\nfor her liberties.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Lafayette was fighting for the cause of liberty in France.\r\nWhen the terrible Bastille prison in Paris was torn down at his command,\r\nhe sent its huge key to Washington, because he believed the same love of\r\nliberty, for which Washington had fought, had also destroyed this state\r\ndungeon of tyranny, where many good people had suffered unjustly.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems Washington had to meet was the warlike attitude of\r\nthe Indians, with whom there was some border fighting. He always treated\r\nthem fairly and often entertained them. When they came, he impressed\r\nthem by a great show of elegance and style. Once a great chief and\r\ntwenty-eight warriors from Alabama came to make a treaty. The President\r\ngave them a splendid dinner at his house. Then he showed them a full\r\nlength, oil portrait of himself. They looked at it, touched it and\r\nlooked behind it. Finding it flat, they grunted in disgust and not one\r\nof them would allow his picture to be made! Dressed in his handsomest\r\nclothes, the President took them, in their full dress of feathers and\r\npaint, for a walk down Broadway, which he enjoyed as much as they.\r\n\r\nWashington liked to slip away from his cares and go fishing. He was a\r\ngood fisherman and it was said \"all the fish came to his hook.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern States were not pleased with the choice of New York as the\r\ncapital, as they thought it too far away; so the seat of government was\r\nmoved to Philadelphia. Washington wanted to move quietly. On a summer\r\nmorning, he and his family were all up by candle light, expecting to\r\nsteal away in their carriages, when, suddenly, a military band began to\r\nplay under their windows! The people came running from all directions.\r\n\"There, we are found out!\" said the President. \"Well, they must have\r\ntheir way.\" So his party walked to the pier between rows of loving\r\npeople, and were rowed to the Jersey shore, while cannon boomed and the\r\nmultitude shouted. Six horses were needed to drag their coach over the\r\npoor roads and the occupants of the coach were in danger of being upset.\r\n\r\nThe house of Robert Morris, in Philadelphia, was taken for Washington,\r\nwho paid the rent himself. Pennsylvania built a President's Mansion, but\r\nit was so big and fine that Washington refused to live in it, and so it\r\nwas used for the Pennsylvania University.\r\n\r\nWhile his furniture was coming by sea from New York, Washington had time\r\nfor a short visit to Mount Vernon, but he and his family were settled in\r\nhis new home when Congress met the first Monday in December.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, two political parties began to form in the United\r\nStates. The Federalists, who were led by Hamilton, wanted to make a\r\nstrong central government, which would develop the country and be\r\nrespected abroad. The Democratic-Republicans, who were led by Jefferson,\r\nwanted the States to hold the chief power, because they were afraid a\r\nstrong central government might be turned into a monarchy. Both parties\r\nhad the good of the country at heart. Jefferson's party is the\r\nDemocratic Party of the present day and the Federalists live still in\r\nthe Republican Party.\r\n\r\nJefferson and Hamilton were bitterly opposed to each other's ideas and\r\ndisputed with their usual fighting quality. Washington quietly heard\r\neach side and did his best to keep the two men at peace, for the country\r\nneeded both.\r\n\r\nIn the spring and summer of 1791, Washington made a tour of the Southern\r\nStates. It was a trip covering eighteen hundred and seventy-five miles.\r\nThe same horses made the entire journey and kept up their spirits until\r\nthey trotted back into their stalls at home! The President returned very\r\nhappy about the condition of the country and delighted with its\r\nconfidence in the new government.\r\n\r\nThe end of his term of four years drew near and Washington looked\r\nforward to the comfort of private life. He was growing quite deaf and\r\nhad had several severe illnesses. He was tired of the load of care, and\r\nof the strife of opposing parties. But four years were not time enough\r\nto establish so great a government. Washington alone held the faith and\r\nconfidence of the people, and they begged him to give them four years\r\nmore. He wanted to retire, as he feared that, after another term, he\r\nwould not be able to carry out his plans for Mount Vernon; but he\r\nfinally consented.\r\n\r\nWashington's second term was filled with great difficulties. Indians\r\nattacked the western frontiers, and Algerian [Algeria is in northern\r\nAfrica] pirates seized American ships and imprisoned American citizens.\r\nFrance and England were at war and it was difficult to keep America out\r\nof the quarrel. These and other problems, besides disputes among public\r\nmen, kept Washington's heart weary and sore. Through it all, he said,\r\n\"There is but one straight course and that is to seek truth and pursue\r\nit steadily.\" His only wish was to \"lead the country to respectability,\r\nwealth and happiness.\" He paid no attention to his own comfort or\r\ndesire. Though often misunderstood and ridiculed by men who did not\r\nagree with him, he never failed to do what he thought was right. His\r\nwisdom and justice were so great that, in all these years, the wisest\r\nmen have found little in the actions of Washington they would change.\r\nJefferson said of him that no motive of interest or friendship or hatred\r\ncould influence him; \"he was in every sense of the word a wise, a good\r\nand a great man.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of his second term, 1797, Washington insisted upon\r\nretiring, and he counted the days until he might lay aside the cares of\r\noffice and seek his rest. He sent his Farewell Address to Congress, and\r\nit has been said that nothing finer has ever been written than his last\r\ngreat message to his countrymen.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1797, John Adams was inaugurated as the second\r\nPresident of the United States. But the thought and love of the great\r\nassembly at the inaugural ceremony were turned toward Washington, the\r\nwhite-haired soldier who had led the country through war to prosperous\r\npeace. The people followed him to his door, where, with tears in his\r\neyes, the \"Father of his Country\" waved farewell to them and to all\r\nbeloved citizens of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, Washington was at home again upon his farm. He spent his\r\ntime riding over his plantations, looking after his crops and horses and\r\ncattle. Often he took out his surveying instruments and spent a day\r\nlaying out his land, or he planted trees and vines about his house and\r\nlawns. To the country folks, he was a beloved neighbor and friend.\r\nVisitors came frequently to his home, while Nelly and George and their\r\nyoung friends kept the place lively. Under the care of her Grandmother,\r\nNelly had grown into a beautiful and well educated young lady. Her wit\r\nand sweetness of temper were a great joy to Washington, who loved her\r\ndearly. She had many suitors, but delighted Washington by choosing his\r\nfavorite nephew, Lawrence Lewis, for her husband. They were married on\r\nWashington's birthday and the General wore his old Continental uniform\r\nof buff and blue, though he had a new and finely embroidered one that\r\nNelly wanted him to put on.\r\n\r\nThe quiet life of Mount Vernon was broken before long. The new President\r\ngot into such trouble with France that the country was threatened with\r\nwar. Washington was asked to take his old position of Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the army and he accepted. He organized an army, but, fortunately,\r\npeace was made without bloodshed, and he was glad to go back to Mount\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\nOne winter day, while riding, Washington was caught in a heavy storm of\r\nrain and snow. He was used to all kinds of weather and thought nothing\r\nof the exposure, even though he was hoarse and had a severe cold the\r\nnext day. Before morning of the third day, he was very ill and when the\r\ndoctors came, they bled him. It was the stupid practice of those days\r\nand in a few hours Washington was so weakened as to be past hope of\r\nrecovery. He died on December 14, 1799, as bravely as he had lived. His\r\nwife praying beside him was as brave and calm as he. He had asked that\r\nhis funeral might be a simple one, and so it was. None was there but\r\nfriends and neighbors. The casket was carried out upon the veranda that\r\nall might see his face. Troops from Alexandria, (Va.) with solemn music\r\nled the funeral procession. Four clergymen in white followed. The\r\nGeneral's favorite horse, with saddle and bridle, was led by two negro\r\ngrooms. The casket, borne by Free Masons and army officers, was followed\r\nby his family, and by friends and neighbors. While minute guns were\r\nfired from a warship in the river below, the procession wound along the\r\nlovely paths of Mount Vernon to the family tomb on the hillside. Here\r\nthe body was laid to rest with religious and Masonic ceremonies.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached the people that Washington was dead, the whole\r\ncountry went into deepest mourning. In Europe, the sorrow was true and\r\nsincere. The British fleets put their flags at half-mast and Napoleon\r\nordered crepe put upon the banners of France. Though Washington was born\r\nand educated in America and belongs truly to Americans, he was such a\r\nfriend to humanity, such a champion of liberty, that the whole world\r\nclaims him as a model.\r\n\r\nHis will provided that, after the death of his wife, all his slaves\r\nshould be free and he left money for those who could not earn a living.\r\nHis able management had made Mount Vernon a great estate of nine\r\nthousand acres. Beside this, he held forty-four other tracts of land in\r\nnine different States, and he was one of the greatest land owners in\r\nAmerica. Believing that the Republic would stand secure only upon a\r\nfoundation of education, courage and conscience, he left money for a\r\ngreat American University. In this, he wanted the young people to be\r\ntrained in the principles of true Americanism. He wanted the\r\nintelligence of the country to guide its politics. It is unfortunate\r\nthat, to the present day, the university has not been founded, although\r\nthere is now every likelihood that such a National University will be\r\nestablished in Washington and vast sums contributed to the fund\r\nWashington had left for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe site of the city of Washington was selected for the Federal Capital\r\nin 1790, and ten years later, the seat of government was moved from\r\nPhiladelphia to Washington. President Washington himself headed the body\r\nof commissioners who chose the site and arranged for the purchase of the\r\nland. The city was named in his honor. It is beautifully laid out with\r\nmagnificent avenues, parks, fountains and stately buildings, and is one\r\nof the finest and most comfortable cities in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the house at Mount Vernon, there was a little attic room, hot in\r\nsummer, bitter cold in winter. But its one window was the only one that\r\nlooked upon the tomb on the hillside, and so Mrs. Washington, after the\r\ndeath of her husband, moved into this little room. Two and a half years\r\nlater, she died there and her body was laid beside that of Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington's Tomb at Mount Vernon]\r\n\r\nYears passed and the beautiful house began to fall into ruin. A new and\r\nsimple tomb was erected to Washington, but it also was neglected.\r\nNothing was done to restore Mount Vernon until the women of the country\r\nbought the place. They rebuilt the walls and porches, brought back the\r\nold furniture, planted vines about the tomb, and still keep it as\r\nWashington would have wished, as a shrine for all to visit, where\r\nrespect can be paid to the memory of the \"Father of his Country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's George Washington, by Calista McCabe Courtenay",
